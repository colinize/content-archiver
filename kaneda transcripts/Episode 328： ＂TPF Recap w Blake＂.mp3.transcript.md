[00:00] I'm a Jew now, like a Jew, you're all the same with my hand.

[00:08] Welcome to episode 328 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] I'm your host, Canada, the only pinball podcast with two Twippy Awards.

[00:29] Thank you again, everybody who voted for this podcast, for a favorite pinball podcast.

[00:34] I truly appreciate it.

[00:35] You made my weekend very, very special.

[00:38] You made everybody who's friends and family of me very, very happy.

[00:42] Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

[00:44] Now look, I did a little T.P.F. recap show with Blake Dumasnell.

[00:49] Blake did the artwork for T.P.F.

[00:51] So if you were walking around the show and you bought a T-shirt, you were wearing Blake's

[00:55] creation.

[00:56] A little bit of a run over of the entire show, what we saw there, what our thoughts were

[01:00] of T.P.F.

[01:01] We had a great time.

[01:02] I enjoyed meeting so many of you in person.

[01:05] So thank you again to Kim and Ed for putting on an amazing show.

[01:09] And thank you to everybody who came up to me at the show this weekend.

[01:13] It was just a great time.

[01:14] I can't tell you how special it was.

[01:16] Now look, here's the deal.

[01:17] I want to do something.

[01:18] I want to sort of turn a page before I air this interview and talk about moving forward

[01:23] in this hobby.

[01:24] There's a lot of really exciting stuff going on in 2019 that we can't wait to hear

[01:28] about.

[01:29] Speaking of, I heard that tonight at 9 o'clock Eastern time, Stern, I think Gary Stern,

[01:35] Stern is going to brief all of their distributors tonight on what Steve Richie's next game is going

[01:41] to be.

[01:42] And that's going to happen at 9 p.m. tonight, which lends a lot of credibility to the rumor

[01:47] that the entire game will be announced tomorrow.

[01:50] Because we all know that distributors have loose lips and one Stern briefs them on the

[01:54] title.

[01:55] They are going to leak that information to their buyers.

[01:59] And so I fully expect to hear what Steve Richie's next game is with an announcement from

[02:05] Stern tomorrow.

[02:06] Now if we don't get the official announcement from Stern tomorrow, I do think we will start

[02:10] to hear in the rumor mail just a confirmation of what it is.

[02:13] And I do think it's going to be black night 3000.

[02:16] Okay.

[02:17] So we're exciting week, right?

[02:18] So we're just coming out of a show and a whole new game is coming out.

[02:22] So that's awesome.

[02:24] That is really awesome.

[02:25] But I just want to say this.

[02:26] And I've been looking at the Twippy thread and I want to say this.

[02:29] I want everybody to just do me a favor and let's put the negative aspect of that show

[02:34] behind us and move on.

[02:35] And by that, I mean, the guy who was building me when the favorite pinball podcast award

[02:40] was announced, it's okay.

[02:42] I know who he is.

[02:43] I'm not going to out him on this show.

[02:44] I forgive him.

[02:46] I think he still wants to punch me for what happened in New York.

[02:48] And look, not everyone is going to, going to like me.

[02:51] Not some people just might hate me forever.

[02:53] I can't change that.

[02:55] But I just want all of you guys to do me a favor.

[02:57] Let's move on and let's celebrate all of the great achievements that were recognized

[03:02] during that amazing show Saturday night.

[03:04] And let's talk about it.

[03:05] I think it's a really interesting debate to talk about game of the year, animations, call

[03:10] outs, all of those things where the community voted is really interesting.

[03:14] And that's where the bulk of the conversations should take place.

[03:18] And let's leave the one negative thing.

[03:21] Let's just cut it out.

[03:22] Okay?

[03:23] And I know it's hard for Pinside sometimes to just do that and not focus on that.

[03:27] But here's the thing.

[03:28] I forgive that guy for doing what he did.

[03:29] I think he probably feels bad about it.

[03:31] If you could go back, he wouldn't do it again.

[03:34] And I think he should apologize to all the people of the show.

[03:37] But now let's talk about all the great pinball that was recognized at the show itself.

[03:41] There are some surprises about what was left out of awards that we talk about with Blake

[03:46] on this episode.

[03:48] But really, really, really.

[03:49] I'm really impressed at how pinball is starting to like develop such amazing content.

[03:55] Right?

[03:56] Awards shows all the amazing podcasts that are out there, all the amazing pinball streamers

[04:00] that are out there.

[04:01] This hobby when I got into it, it was like there was very few things you could engage

[04:06] with if you were really into pinball.

[04:08] And I think right now what excites me about 2019 and 2020 is just all of the awesome personalities

[04:15] and content and manufacturers that are out there that are making stuff for you if you

[04:21] are into pinball.

[04:22] I mean, it is much more robust now than it ever was before.

[04:25] And does it also feel like we've sort of moved past that era of like all the failed boutiques

[04:31] of the skitbies and the Dutch pinballs and the highway pinballs?

[04:35] And I know like minus my stupid rumors a week ago, there's a lot of real stuff happening.

[04:41] Real games going into real boxes that can go into your real home and take your real money.

[04:46] Now, I know that doesn't like absolve the people who are still in pain from the mishaps

[04:53] of yesterday years with some of these companies.

[04:56] But man, it is an awesome time to speculate and to wonder and dream about what's coming

[05:00] up in pinball.

[05:02] And I have the same advice to all my friends because just wait the next six months, you're

[05:06] going to see so many new titles.

[05:08] So it's an awesome time to wait.

[05:09] So everyone, thank you again for all of the kind notes and all of the remarks on social

[05:15] media, all the emails I got.

[05:16] I'm going to call out some of you guys, you know, in future episodes for what you've

[05:20] said.

[05:21] And I have to give it very sort of just the one that really also just meant so much to

[05:24] me last night.

[05:25] And I wasn't expecting it.

[05:27] I haven't heard from him in a while.

[05:28] And I got a really nice note from Lyman Sheets just saying, you know, keep up the good

[05:33] work and keep speaking the truth.

[05:36] And it meant so much.

[05:37] It meant so much because I respect him.

[05:38] He's such a class act.

[05:40] And I had a lot of good conversations with people at Stern Pinball at the show as well

[05:45] that meant a lot to me.

[05:46] And I think that's important is that we're all sort of looking for ways to better ourselves

[05:50] and better the show and better the content.

[05:52] And just better how we can entertain all of you as you turn to this Canadian Spinball

[05:57] Podcast for your pinball enjoyment and hopefully some education on pinball.

[06:02] So without a doubt, let me let me air this interview.

[06:05] I think you're going to enjoy it.

[06:06] We do a recap and I want to hear from you what your thoughts were on T.P.F.

[06:10] email me at canadapinballadgemail.com.

[06:13] Here's to an exciting, optimistic 2019 in pinball.

[06:18] I think we all should be positive and really excited about what's to come down the road

[06:21] in pinball.

[06:22] Have a great day, everybody.

[06:24] All right.

[06:25] Back in our respective homes, Blake, Doom the Snow and Canada, we were bunk buddies

[06:31] at T.P.F.

[06:32] Blake, right?

[06:33] Yeah.

[06:34] Yeah, worked out fine.

[06:35] And now the campaign begins to win the third Twippy to be the best pinball podcast of

[06:41] 2019.

[06:42] So let's not mess it up in our first show as the campaign begins for that.

[06:46] All right.

[06:47] No pressure.

[06:48] All right.

[06:49] So Blake, we're going to recap T.P.F. this year and we both were there.

[06:53] What were your overall thoughts of the show?

[06:55] And it's usually like one of the most anticipated shows, one of the biggest shows.

[06:59] Let's start with just your overall thoughts and then we'll go into the specific manufacturers

[07:02] and what they did at the show.

[07:05] Overall I thought the show was an even greater improvement on the last couple of years

[07:10] since they really had been polishing it up even more.

[07:14] They had moved the tournament out of the main hall this year into a separate space and

[07:20] I think that that actually ended up working well to the benefit of the show.

[07:25] It kind of eliminated some bottlenecks up near the front entrance and it opened up

[07:30] a lot more space for vendors and there were a lot more new vendors at this show this year

[07:35] than I think we've ever seen before.

[07:37] So I think people realize that T.P.F. really is the go-to show and it's kind of a replacement

[07:43] to the Chicago Expo at this point.

[07:46] Right.

[07:47] Yeah.

[07:48] I did notice that last year when you walked in there was this huge tournament section

[07:52] and this year they sort of relegated it off to the side sort of like on your way to the

[07:57] seminar room.

[07:58] It was off to the right there.

[08:00] So the show, like were you disappointed that there wasn't a deep route presence after

[08:05] last year's they were advertising heavily that this would be the five days of deep route?

[08:09] I was disappointed from the standpoint that it was a missed opportunity.

[08:16] I think this was the perfect year for them to really roll in with a big presentation

[08:21] and show something really impressive because going into it there really wasn't much new

[08:29] being revealed this year.

[08:30] And so I understand if they weren't ready that that was smart on their part to just

[08:36] wait it out and we'll get to see it when they're absolutely ready to show it to us.

[08:40] But I think that they could have made a huge splash this year.

[08:43] Right.

[08:44] And I noticed I was reading Pinside today and there's a lot of debate about whether or

[08:48] not a manufacturer's presence at a show like Tpf is important when it comes to revealing

[08:54] a new game.

[08:55] Do you think like that a show like that is a prime opportunity to reveal or do you think

[09:01] it doesn't matter if they just skip it and do it some other time?

[09:06] So I think that it matters depending on the company.

[09:10] I think that a company like Stern that's proven time and time again that they're reliable

[09:15] they can build these games crank them out.

[09:18] We know what we're getting in terms of quality from them.

[09:21] They can go reveal these games via IGN or any of the other news outlets that they want

[09:26] to online and it's not going to be that big of a deal.

[09:29] I think it makes sense that they're not wanting to step on the sales of their current

[09:36] hot title which of course there's a monster for this particular show and reveal a new

[09:41] game.

[09:42] But in the case of Deeproot, this is a company that hasn't shown anything to anybody.

[09:47] People have zero trust or faith or anything established with this company at this point

[09:53] and I think it's critical for them to have a presence at a show and to allow people

[09:58] to see that in person versus just revealing things online and then people are like, well,

[10:04] this looks good but let's see what the product actually looks like in person.

[10:08] So I think it really depends on the company.

[10:11] Right.

[10:12] Well, I guess what I'm always interested or curious, I guess is the better word.

[10:15] I'm curious though.

[10:16] Imagine this scenario.

[10:17] Imagine Deeproot doesn't spend all the money to sort of, I mean, Texas made sense because

[10:23] it was in their backyard.

[10:24] But now that Texas is over, if you're them, does it make sense to spend all the money to

[10:29] ship games and ship employees and do all that stuff or do they just fly a few marquee

[10:38] media outlets into their factory to reveal it on a bigger scale.

[10:45] And that because they know, they must know that the first people that are prone to like

[10:51] this and want to buy it are going to be the pinball fanatics that really don't need

[10:55] much more, right?

[10:57] Then some images and some trusted people to step on a game and stream it for them.

[11:01] I mean, we've seen people buy games Blake with much less.

[11:04] Well, that's true.

[11:07] It's a valid point.

[11:08] I think that especially with a variety of manufacturers out there, both large and small,

[11:17] they're still concerned about quality and what quality these machines are that people

[11:21] are getting.

[11:22] I think that you can put together a machine that looks excellent and it can be a horrible

[11:27] build quality and vice versa.

[11:28] You could have a game that may be terrible looking, but it could actually be built like a tank.

[11:33] So, I do think that especially where Deeproot is pushing this concept of evolving the manufacturing

[11:42] process and really reinventing it, I think that's something people are going to want to

[11:47] see in person.

[11:49] The internet's powerful and it gets information to people immediately nowadays and so you

[11:55] absolutely could fly some media outlets out there and probably accomplish the same thing,

[12:02] but depending on the price points of these games and what they're asking people, I do

[12:07] think that people are going to want to see something in person before they trust them.

[12:13] That also goes back to just the connection to Zidware.

[12:17] That's a good point.

[12:18] At the shows, when you flip a game like Thunderbirds and then you flip a game like Pirates of the

[12:23] Caribbean, you can tell which one is the Cadillac and which one is the Civic.

[12:32] You feel it and you only can get that if you actually are flipping the game.

[12:36] Back to TPS, I think we all agree that Deeproot not being there was the lack of presence

[12:44] there was felt by people who booked their travel to the show like a year ago because we

[12:48] all were expecting it.

[12:50] In terms of who was there, who do you think had the most impressive presence on the show

[12:56] floor?

[12:59] I think that Stern continues to have a very solid presence due to the sheer number of

[13:06] games that they've got on the floor at any of these shows.

[13:10] I really attribute that to Marco.

[13:12] The Marco folks go above and beyond showcasing Stern's products and they do it in a very grandiose

[13:20] manner with the way their booth looks and everything.

[13:24] There were, I don't even know how many monsters machines were on the floor at the show this

[13:28] weekend.

[13:29] I mean, just count it.

[13:31] It had to have been at least at least 20 games.

[13:38] I think that they were probably closer to like 25 or 30.

[13:43] I think that there were over 12 to 15 premiums alone.

[13:49] I think this was one of the first real opportunities for everybody to see what the premium looked

[13:56] like in person, which was good that they had that many of them.

[14:00] I thought the premiums.

[14:02] I think Chicago Gaming also had a strong presence.

[14:06] I thought they had a really sizable booth and they had a lot of models of each of their

[14:11] games for people to check out.

[14:13] No, was Chicago Gaming to the right of Kingpin Games or not?

[14:18] Is that right?

[14:21] No, Chicago Gaming.

[14:24] They were kind of tucked over in a little cul-de-sac area up near Spooky's booth.

[14:28] They were more in the front left portion of the exhibit hall.

[14:32] Gotcha.

[14:33] I feel like I missed them.

[14:35] I don't know how I missed that section.

[14:39] Mark, go ahead and tell me games.

[14:39] What did you think of Monsters Premium?

[14:41] I thought it looked amazing.

[14:42] I was like, wow, I don't think anyone who gets a premium is going to be disappointed.

[14:47] As soon as I saw those games coming out of the boxes the other day and then especially

[14:51] when they lit them up, the Monsters Premium, in my opinion, is hands down the premiere

[14:58] model of all three Monsters games.

[15:02] This is artwork and color looks absolutely spectacular and I see why people gravitated

[15:07] towards it.

[15:08] But the black and white is just so unique.

[15:12] Most people that have a lineup of games that are all in color, this is something that's

[15:16] going to stand out as something special, I think.

[15:20] I was very impressed by it.

[15:22] The game is still a lot of fun.

[15:23] I played it a few times and I look forward to getting on it some more.

[15:28] The black and white was amazing.

[15:31] Let's talk about the games that were sort of like the first experiences with some titles.

[15:37] There weren't that many.

[15:38] I mean, usually I feel like there's a little bit more reveals and sort of announcements

[15:43] of new titles.

[15:44] I will say the show this year was very void of new games and announcements and reveals

[15:51] of titles.

[15:52] We didn't have a significant amount.

[15:56] Maybe when you think about it, what were the new titles that were announced or revealed?

[16:02] Cosmic Carnival, that's already been announced.

[16:07] They just showed it and had it on the floor.

[16:09] That's Suncoast Pimball, right?

[16:11] Yeah.

[16:12] I would consider that a new reveal because I don't think anybody has publicly seen that

[16:18] game in person up until the show this weekend.

[16:21] What does it think of it?

[16:24] The game is absolutely beautiful.

[16:27] Once again, Dirty Donny just knocked it out of the park.

[16:31] I think he gave the game a lot of personality.

[16:34] It's obviously very much his style.

[16:36] He did a lot of different things in the character designs that he wasn't able to do with like

[16:41] Aerosmith or Metallica.

[16:44] I think that the value that's truly in that game is going to stem from how cool the artwork

[16:52] is that he did.

[16:54] I'll say this.

[16:57] I don't know if the ramps were prototype plastic ramps.

[17:00] They seemed a little flimsy.

[17:03] However, I was checking out the cabinet and the game is it's built almost identically

[17:08] like a stern game in terms of the size, the proportions, the size of the LCD.

[17:16] I actually was very impressed with the build quality.

[17:19] The lockdown bar, everything felt solid.

[17:22] It felt at least as good as a stern machine did.

[17:27] I don't really know how well the mechanics of the game are going to hold up necessarily.

[17:32] In terms of just the overall cabinet build and everything, I thought it was pretty good.

[17:37] It was not bad.

[17:38] I thought that honestly for a new game that a lot of people had not seen, the game made

[17:42] a very good showing.

[17:43] I felt like when I saw it that Dirty Donny has a leftover box of crayons that he had when

[17:53] he made the Aerosmith game.

[17:55] I was just a little surprised that the color selection was so identical to the Aerosmith

[18:01] package.

[18:02] I almost felt like it was too identical.

[18:04] It was the exact same purple I felt.

[18:07] I wish they would have differentiated it from Aerosmith knowing that that was his last

[18:11] project and it just felt so similar.

[18:16] That is a very fair assessment and I do agree with that.

[18:18] It visually does look a lot like Aerosmith.

[18:21] It's kind of a cross between Aerosmith and the Cancressher machine.

[18:28] I think that when you think of carnivals, I think of more yellows and reds and warmer

[18:35] tones and there probably could have been more use of those colors.

[18:41] I guess they gravitated towards the cooler tones to tie it into the space theme.

[18:51] I get the mindset behind that decision but I agree with you.

[18:54] There probably could have been a little bit more contrast.

[18:58] When you say when I think carnival, I think of rides and toys and merry arounds and roller

[19:06] coasters and all sorts of fun stuff, all sorts of things that are moving and animated

[19:11] and coming to life.

[19:13] I looked at the game and it's beautiful.

[19:16] It is beautiful but there's no movement.

[19:19] There's no mechanisms in it.

[19:21] There's scopes that are really cool.

[19:24] There are those squiggly ramps but I don't think there's any real moving mechanisms, toys

[19:30] or gimmicks in it.

[19:32] Am I missing those or?

[19:34] No, no, I don't think you're reaching any goal.

[19:38] The game is like a, I consider it to be a very modernized futuristic take on comment.

[19:47] Basically.

[19:48] I think people are saying that's a ramps or similar.

[19:50] The ramps are similar.

[19:51] I think that the simplicity of the game, if you will, in terms of just, there's not a lot

[19:57] of height to the game.

[20:00] You've just got those ramps that are both the same height and everything.

[20:02] It's a very symmetrical game.

[20:05] I think that that does make it feel more like the 80s era games.

[20:12] That's not necessarily a bad thing.

[20:14] How much is it?

[20:16] I thought I heard somebody say that it was going to be around 6 grand, 6 to 7 somewhere.

[20:23] I don't know if it's truly closer to the 6th mark or the 7th mark but do you feel like

[20:30] you're getting a lot of game for that price point?

[20:33] Honestly, I don't really think so.

[20:34] I think that you can go get a Chicago gaming machine or go get an American pinball machine

[20:41] for around the same price and you're getting a lot more to the game.

[20:47] It makes Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle look like a JJP compared to it.

[20:53] I think it's going to be a tough sell.

[20:54] I think these games, these boutiques, and this is not me being a jerk but I think they're

[21:01] almost like making this stuff.

[21:03] Their target audience is just for the guy who just absolutely needs something that's different.

[21:09] But I don't know if I look at this stuff and say they're improving upon what is already

[21:14] available and I think it's going to be hard.

[21:16] I think it's going to be a hard sell.

[21:17] You said it earlier Blake, if the most valuable thing people are getting from a pinball machine

[21:23] is just the artwork, that's not going to work anymore because we have so much good art

[21:29] across the board.

[21:30] We're everywhere now.

[21:31] I want to give the suncoast guys credit from the standpoint that they showed up to

[21:39] T.P.F. and actually looked like a polished professional company in terms of just the way

[21:46] that their brand was spread across their booth, the merch that they had, not that that's

[21:51] hard to make t-shirts and stuff.

[21:53] But I thought overall the presentation of it was very professional and the game absolutely

[21:58] didn't look like a home brew.

[22:00] It was at least polished enough that it looked like it could be professionally built.

[22:07] A little some pipe and draping, a black table with a table cloth and two games facing away

[22:12] from each other and all of a sudden you're a legitimate professional pinball company now.

[22:16] Let's talk about the one company that really needed to have a great showing was American

[22:23] Pinball with October Fes.

[22:24] This is sort of the moment in which people were getting their hands on the final production.

[22:29] People played October Fes a lot.

[22:31] I want to share first Blake what you thought of the game and how you think AP did at T.P.F.

[22:37] Okay.

[22:38] Well, you're absolutely right.

[22:40] American Pinball needed to come to T.P.F. swinging for the fences with this because I think

[22:47] that they knew from the initial reactions online that the theme was not going to resonate

[22:51] with a lot of people in that they needed to rely on the fun factor of the game.

[22:57] They had a great setup.

[22:59] I think they had at least six October Fes.

[23:01] Actually, maybe seven October Fes on the floor.

[23:07] American Pinball definitely looks like a professional company.

[23:11] They carry themselves very well and I always saw Josh and Joe and those guys interacting

[23:17] with everybody and explaining the game.

[23:19] Overall, I was going into the show honestly not feeling that excited about seeing October

[23:24] Fes. Just simply because what we've seen of it so far didn't seem to do a whole lot for me.

[23:31] The theme certainly didn't really click, but I will say that Joe has really put together

[23:39] another fantastically unique layout that was a lot of fun to shoot.

[23:44] The game is a lot of fun to shoot.

[23:47] If you can get past the theme and some of the animations and stuff like that and

[23:54] some of the art direction decisions, it is a very unique layout.

[24:00] It's definitely not a fan layout.

[24:02] There were some really cool aspects of the game that I think it would take a while to

[24:07] master those things and then in a home environment that creates more longevity.

[24:13] Right.

[24:14] So you enjoyed it?

[24:16] I actually enjoyed it way more than I thought I was going to.

[24:19] No, and I've been reading and I've been following what people have been saying about the

[24:23] game from the show and I've heard a lot of positive stuff.

[24:26] I do think American Pimball had a really good showing with October Fes.

[24:31] They had a bunch in their booth.

[24:32] There was also one in Cointaker's booth.

[24:35] There was one in Zach's booth and flipping out Pimball.

[24:38] So distributors had it.

[24:40] You were able to jump on October Fes.

[24:44] Pretty frequently.

[24:45] I can't even talk right now.

[24:46] I don't know what to have.

[24:47] Maybe it's the jet.

[24:48] I can't even blame it on jet lag.

[24:50] Look, I think the game shoots really well.

[24:52] I do.

[24:53] I agree.

[24:54] It's a different layout.

[24:55] A lot of people who are looking for something different, I think we'll appreciate that it doesn't

[24:59] feel sort of like the typical, I don't even want to say like Stern fan layout, but it is.

[25:05] It's a complete opposite of a Stern fan layout.

[25:10] I'm just curious to see how orders will go for the game and this is my whole thing is

[25:15] I think the game shoots well.

[25:17] It's going to come down to a few things for me.

[25:20] It's going to come down to the theme.

[25:23] Is this a game people want to own?

[25:25] I think when you're talking about owning a game, will people want to have this as a theme

[25:29] that they purchase?

[25:30] I do wish the artwork was a little bit better.

[25:33] I think the artwork for me, it's not that it's bad, right?

[25:36] It's very layered.

[25:37] There's a lot of it.

[25:38] There's a lot of art, right?

[25:39] It doesn't look like bad, like a game of Thrones bad or Star Trek bad, but there's just

[25:47] something about the art that doesn't make me smile or doesn't sort of pull me in.

[25:52] I just wish there was a little bit more of cohesiveness to the art package.

[25:56] Other than that, I had fun shooting it.

[25:59] I had fun shooting it.

[26:00] I just still think it's going to be a little difficult given the fact that it's $7,500

[26:06] to win out where the current landscape is with what's available for that much money.

[26:12] I do wish them luck.

[26:13] I look forward to having Josh come on the show and talk more about the game, see how far

[26:18] long the game is.

[26:20] Just to see what their plans are for this and moving forward, because we know AP, they're

[26:25] also starting to ramp up the ability to contract, manufacture, additional games within their

[26:31] facility, which is exciting when you think about it.

[26:36] This doesn't sound like this game is going to make or break them.

[26:38] It sounds like you're going to keep going.

[26:40] Yeah, I think so.

[26:45] Seeing Joe interact with folks over the weekend, I think that he's very happy with where they're

[26:49] at and what they're doing.

[26:52] This was a game that he had been pushing for over 20 years.

[26:55] It sounds like.

[26:58] I think that they're definitely moving ahead regardless of how well a game does.

[27:05] Obviously all companies want their games to do well.

[27:08] I think that what I took away from October, Fest the most was that this game may be similar

[27:15] in how people react to it as they did with Dildan in terms of you've got this very vibrant

[27:22] colorful world that they've built.

[27:25] There wasn't much in terms of the music and the collots and stuff that really drew any

[27:30] excitement for me while I was playing it.

[27:33] The layout of the game was exciting to play.

[27:36] It was a lot of fun hitting the roller coaster ramps and all that kind of stuff.

[27:41] I want the game to talk to me, interact with me.

[27:45] The music to be catchy and you want to be drawn into that world.

[27:49] I'm not saying that it can't be done, but so far I'm not really getting that vibe from

[27:55] it.

[27:56] We'll see.

[27:58] It's always hard.

[27:59] We should have said this.

[28:00] A little bit of the caveat is playing these games at the show is always difficult to get

[28:05] in the universe and the experience.

[28:07] I cheated and I snuck in there at 7 a.m. to turn on, October Fest and turn on Alice Cooper's

[28:12] Nightmare Castle and other stuff because once the show is going forget it, don't ever

[28:17] take a review from someone who's reviewing a game in the middle of a crowded show like

[28:22] TPM.

[28:23] The only thing you'll be able to really review are the shots.

[28:27] Even then, if the game's not set up right, if there's power drain on the machine, you're

[28:31] not going to really understand how the game would play in a home environment.

[28:37] Take everything we say with a little bit of a grain of salt.

[28:41] Let me just ask you a hypothetical, Blake, and I'll give you my answer as well.

[28:45] How many October Fest do you think they're going to sell?

[28:51] I think that they're going to be lucky.

[28:55] This may sound really bad, but I think they're going to be lucky to get 1,000 units sold.

[28:59] I think they would consider that successful, 1,000 units at 7,500 a pop.

[29:04] It's not a bad payday.

[29:06] It was a 7.5 million.

[29:08] Yeah, it's not bad in terms of the numbers.

[29:11] That doesn't sound like a huge hit in terms of unit sold and really getting the game out

[29:17] there.

[29:19] But I think that for a theme that has been polarizing to people, I think that American

[29:26] pinball could consider that a success.

[29:29] I don't think it'll go that high.

[29:31] I'm not sure how many who deenie sold.

[29:34] Just knowing what's coming out and knowing there's a lot happening soon.

[29:37] We're probably going to see Steve Richie's game Tuesday.

[29:43] I think it's going to be probably around half that.

[29:45] I think 500 to 750 is more of the reality.

[29:51] I think what's interesting, and this is a good segue, as they think about putting

[29:56] another line in action at American pinball.

[29:59] One of the seminars I went to, we're going to bleed everything together in this chat about

[30:04] T.P.F. was Kingpin by Circus Pinball.

[30:10] And is it Circus Pinball?

[30:12] Pinball Circus?

[30:13] It's Pinball Circus.

[30:14] Circus Maximus.

[30:15] Circus, okay.

[30:16] See, there's too many, I always get confused with that, right?

[30:20] Okay.

[30:21] Circus Maximus, they are making Python, Angelo's Pinball Circus.

[30:25] They are also remaking Kingpin now.

[30:27] What was really interesting in their seminar is they're pretty much, it sounds like they're

[30:32] nearing the finish line, and they are now talking to contract manufacturers in the

[30:37] Chicago area.

[30:39] That means they're probably talking to American Pinball, Chicago gaming, and maybe even

[30:44] Stern.

[30:45] Stern hasn't really contract manufactured a game since medieval madness.

[30:48] I don't know if they're still going to do it.

[30:51] Do you think there's a chance that Kingpin could be a title that American Pinball puts

[30:57] on the line alongside of October Fest to at least hedge their bets a little bit?

[31:03] I think that there's enough positive history with Kingpin in terms of, it's a game that

[31:10] a lot of people have wanted to see.

[31:14] It's a great layout, honestly.

[31:16] Mark Richey is a wonderful designer.

[31:20] I shot it this past week and I really enjoyed it once again.

[31:24] I could see them going after it.

[31:27] It's a flushed out enough game that I could see them feeling comfortable putting that on

[31:31] the line and helping offset some things.

[31:34] Yeah.

[31:35] Right.

[31:36] I mean, they're going to have to do it.

[31:37] I don't think there's any other option.

[31:38] I don't think American Pinball is going to be very successful if they go all in on these

[31:45] original themes, and they're not like original themes, but they're like IPP.

[31:50] IPP's that don't require trademarks per se.

[31:53] So it was Sherlock Holmes and Robin Hood and Valkyrie and what was it?

[31:59] Poker Run.

[32:00] The other four titles we saw them trademarking, I mean, it just has me a little bit worried

[32:05] that they don't have a theme or a title that's a little bit of take my money now.

[32:09] And I think Kingpin is a game that would get a lot of attention from the pinball world.

[32:16] Because I do want to see these new companies.

[32:18] Like I do think they have to make a game in which people want a lot of them.

[32:24] And you know, I'm talking like at least 2000 machines, you know, to really become a viable

[32:32] player in the pinball market.

[32:34] So we'll see what happens.

[32:36] October Fest should be shipping, I think as early as April.

[32:40] So if you are interested in one, I know they're getting ready to throw that game on the line

[32:44] if it's not on the line already.

[32:47] So moving on, probably the strangest reveal, not strange, but just sort of underwhelming

[32:53] reveal was Jersey Jack's presence at the show.

[32:55] And I talked a little bit about it on a couple of my previous podcasts this past weekend.

[33:01] But Jack sort of walked in there.

[33:03] We knew he was going to talk about the Yellow brick road edition.

[33:06] And then Blake, we were in the seminar and what did you think of how that all went down?

[33:12] Well, everybody knew that it was coming.

[33:15] And I think that the expectation was, all right, they're going to do this, they're going

[33:21] to do yet another run of this game.

[33:23] They're going to put some new armor on it and stuff like that, give it a new name.

[33:28] I think we all knew that they were going to be removing at least one or possibly multiple

[33:32] mechanisms turned out it was just a flying monkey mechanism.

[33:37] What I certainly wasn't expecting.

[33:38] I don't think anybody else was expecting was that they made the game more expensive after

[33:44] having removed one of the key mechanisms that's featured in all the other models.

[33:50] And so they also really didn't change the armor column game that much.

[33:55] I mean, it's not a different enough version, in my opinion, to the other LEDs that are

[34:01] out there already to justify the cost.

[34:04] And so that's why the reaction from everybody this whole weekend, I mean, every time the

[34:09] you and I would talk to somebody about that reveal, everyone was shaking their heads like,

[34:15] what was that about?

[34:17] Why are they doing this?

[34:19] This doesn't make sense.

[34:20] It's not smart.

[34:22] It's just milking the license yet again when there's already been enough versions made

[34:28] of it.

[34:29] And then on top of that, Jack couldn't even say we are only going to make 200 or 250 of

[34:37] these games and that's it.

[34:39] He still left the door open for the number to go up, depending on however many they feel

[34:46] like they want to make.

[34:47] And then he said, we might even go back and do the Ruby Red Edition again.

[34:53] Yeah.

[34:54] It's like, oh my God.

[34:57] Yeah.

[34:58] And when he said that, that it's almost like nothing is sacred in Jersey Jack promises

[35:04] around limited editions.

[35:06] And it's almost become a little bit of a running joke in the pinball world.

[35:11] It's just like, just wait.

[35:12] He's going to make a black pearl edition.

[35:13] Just wait.

[35:14] He'll make another version.

[35:16] And it's a little unfortunate because you can't do that.

[35:20] You can't do it in this kind of hobby because the people are just too smart.

[35:26] I say that and then I start laughing because are we too smart when people buy games,

[35:30] site unseen and people are buying $25,000 magic girls that don't even work.

[35:35] We'll talk a little bit about that because there was one at the show.

[35:37] But I think Jack didn't really have a plan for this game other than it was a business

[35:43] plan.

[35:44] It was a business decision.

[35:45] We need to put something on the line to fill the gap between pirates of the Caribbean

[35:51] production and Willy Wonka production.

[35:53] And this was, this made the most sense, right?

[35:55] It was like, it was just a fill in that gap of a couple of months because we can't have

[36:00] nothing on the line for two to three months with that kind of company, right?

[36:05] They just, they can't survive.

[36:07] I bet dialed in, orders have stopped.

[36:11] I bet there's no more hobbits to be run.

[36:14] And so Jack is just going back to the one game that has constantly had demand and that's

[36:19] wizard of Oz.

[36:20] Now, you're right.

[36:21] And I can't fault him for that either.

[36:23] You know, I kind of even got the vibe from him after they did the reveal that he knows

[36:30] this isn't what anybody wants to see.

[36:32] Just yet another addition of a game that's been made for seven years now.

[36:37] But yeah, it just seemed like it was to pacify time and to just get something on the line.

[36:43] But my big issue is this.

[36:44] And I have no problem with rerunning was and I was reading one guy on Pinside and he said,

[36:49] like I sold my Emerald city because I wanted to get this new one.

[36:54] And for a lot of people out there, if was is a great game that you love and was is a game

[36:59] that is a keeper for you.

[37:01] I think a lot of those people like we're looking at this reveal and saying, if it's going

[37:07] to be truly limited and if it's going to be really special, you know, with the new light

[37:11] boards and the new cabinet, if Jack gives enough value in this game, I'm okay.

[37:16] Like trading up to this one and making this the permanent was that's in my home.

[37:21] And I think those people were severely disappointed by losing the monkey mechanism.

[37:28] For me too, this is the one thing.

[37:30] I didn't even mention this on my other podcast when I talked about it.

[37:34] You just go look at the top or on this thing for $11,500.

[37:40] It's just like, it's just an afterthought.

[37:43] You know, there's nothing about that top or that shows that that feels special.

[37:49] And when you start getting above $10,000 for a pinball machine, I do think it needs to

[37:54] start having more details and more special items on it that justify it.

[38:01] And they just yank stuff out.

[38:02] I mean, there was nothing really put in.

[38:05] You're paying for the new cabinet layout, the sparkle and the yellow.

[38:12] It looks like roller coaster tycoon with all that yellow.

[38:14] I just don't even like the yellow on the wire forms that much.

[38:18] So here's the other thing to be like.

[38:22] And I'm just going to be honest with the listeners of the show because this is what you expect

[38:25] from the show.

[38:27] The distributors all knew that Jack was going to make 500 of them.

[38:31] And yet he got up there and said, it's going to be 200 and then we're going to assess

[38:36] things and go from there.

[38:38] And then so the first thing a buyer is going to do is go to his distributor and say,

[38:42] why are they going to make more?

[38:44] And the distributors are like, yep, they're making 300 more next year.

[38:47] And it's just like, well, why not just say it's one of 500 if you buy one today and just

[38:53] cap it at that because the problem is if Jack sells all 500, you know what he's going

[38:57] to do is going to run another run.

[38:59] He's going to call it something else, the 10 man edition.

[39:03] You know, and it's just at some point, it needs to stop.

[39:06] And they need to be more honest with their customers about what's limited and what's

[39:12] not.

[39:13] And if it's not limited, stop calling it limited.

[39:14] You can't have three different limited editions.

[39:16] I mean, you can, but it just seems so silly and it just gets ridiculous at this point.

[39:24] So the other big thing was this, the ceasing production of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[39:30] And I think that was a little bit of a dark cloud over Jersey Jack's presence at T.P.F.

[39:35] It definitely seemed like it was impacting Eric, even though he's never, you know, he

[39:40] always has that little bit of a deadpan demeanor.

[39:43] He did seem bummed out.

[39:44] And what were your thoughts, Blake, when you saw him address that and then have to sit

[39:50] through how wise was made again, that's seven years old.

[39:55] Yeah, I think that that's a fair assessment.

[39:58] Eric was, you could tell that he poured a lot of blood sweat and tears into Pirates of

[40:05] the Caribbean.

[40:06] And I think that it was probably, it's been wearing on him from the standpoint that it

[40:11] did not get produced nearly quickly enough, like it was supposed to, you know, they had

[40:17] to remove the rings, which was a major element that while it didn't really bother me that

[40:24] they removed it when they announced it, it really does affect the gameplay.

[40:28] In terms of the single disc just doesn't really do anything, but the three discs was a tremendous

[40:34] feature that had a lot of interaction with the ball.

[40:38] And so you do feel like that a masterpiece that this guy's worked on for so long has been

[40:44] kind of chopped down a little bit and now all of a sudden, you know, the game's just

[40:51] being stopped, you know, no more production of it.

[40:54] And so that's got to be a little disheartening.

[40:57] Why are you burning him now, though, right?

[40:59] So it's burning him now.

[41:00] And I think people have gotten over discate and they've gotten over the treasure chest,

[41:05] not opening and closing.

[41:07] I think what's got to burn him inside now is, there's a, okay, this is the total number

[41:12] of Pirates that have been built.

[41:13] There are 1,000 of these games built.

[41:16] That is the number that Jersey Jack has produced.

[41:18] That is how many parts they had ordered for games.

[41:22] Now that 1,000 of these games are out in the world.

[41:26] It seems like the unanimous feedback on this game from almost everyone who owns it is

[41:31] they love it.

[41:32] And they think it's great.

[41:33] And we saw I get a lot of Twippy awards and we saw a lot of, you know, owners who wouldn't

[41:38] stop beating my door down to convince me it was the greatest game of all time.

[41:43] So the game is getting high accolades and great word of mouth.

[41:47] But the problem is this, right?

[41:50] Jack had to make a decision and the decision was very simple.

[41:53] Do I order more parts for Pirates in bulk?

[41:57] Because you have to order in bulk.

[41:58] I would say he would have to order at least 500 to 1,000 parts to make it worthwhile.

[42:05] He had to make a decision.

[42:06] Do I do that?

[42:07] And the other problem they ran into Blake was, for Jack to have made that decision, to

[42:11] order those parts, he would have had to have done it months ago to get the parts in

[42:17] time to keep the game going now.

[42:21] That's what they ran into.

[42:25] And so no more Pirates.

[42:27] Yeah, it's unfortunate and it's, I do think that the game probably had more life in

[42:37] it in terms of sales.

[42:39] I think that it was really just starting to get the exposure that it needed, especially

[42:44] now that production has started on the game for it to really catch on with people.

[42:52] So it could end up being one of those games that has a fairly low production run and

[43:00] will always be loved by people and being high to man.

[43:05] Right, so if you have one, you now have the rarest Jersey Jack game of all time.

[43:12] It's going to be hard to get right now.

[43:14] And I saw someone list one for sale and it was basically 8,500.

[43:18] They were charging pretty much what they bought it for.

[43:22] It's curious to see, you know, because there's a lot of fear of missing out happening around

[43:27] pirates right now.

[43:28] A lot of my friends who are collectors and love Jersey Jack games, they're really, really

[43:34] nervous that they're all going to be gobbled up and they won't be able to get one.

[43:39] And so I keep telling them the same advice.

[43:41] I said, look, just wait.

[43:43] It's wait and see because once Willy Wonka and Toy Story and Guns and Roses are out,

[43:49] I think what you're going to see is some of the, you know, a good percentage, not a good

[43:54] percentage, but maybe like 10 to 20% of original pirates of the Caribbean owners might list

[43:59] their games for sale to get one of the newer Jersey Jack games, right?

[44:03] So, and then, you know, that could be another 100, 200 come on the market for sale.

[44:09] And I don't know.

[44:10] I don't know if they're going to go back and remake it.

[44:13] Do you ever think they're going to go back and remake this game?

[44:17] Well, we've seen that nothing's out of the question when it comes to new additions of

[44:24] Jersey Jack games.

[44:25] So, but you bring up a valid point in terms of the parts that are needed and, you know,

[44:32] going back and re-running Wizard of Oz makes sense because it's been a proven hit.

[44:37] Parts to care being may very well be more, it probably is a more expensive game to manufacture

[44:42] than Wizard of Oz is.

[44:44] Therefore, the parts are probably more expensive.

[44:45] And so, they may not be as inclined to rerun it with that being the case.

[44:53] But I'm not ruling anything out in terms of that game being rerun.

[44:57] Now, what you, what you did say before that is a very valid point that I think when these

[45:02] other games that people know are coming and have a huge fan base behind them, do arrive.

[45:09] I think that you're going to see a lot of parts show up on the second hand market.

[45:14] I just got this sense and this is just me.

[45:17] Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but they just seemed really tired as a team and they

[45:23] seemed like there's a lot of weight on their shoulders, Jersey Jack.

[45:27] And it didn't seem like they were carrying themselves as if they knew they had just like

[45:34] this juggernaut hit in Willy Wonka around the corner and they just couldn't wait to

[45:39] show us.

[45:40] I just didn't get that vibe from them.

[45:43] And so that kind of makes me a little nervous that I'm not sure how confident they are.

[45:49] Not that Wonka is not like an awesome game, but that they've figured out the issues when

[45:55] it comes to manufacturing, when it comes to the quality control issues that they had with

[46:01] Pirates of the Caribbean.

[46:03] I'm just a little nervous for them that they may not have solved all of those production

[46:09] woes and they are sort of anxiously moving towards Wonka versus sort of just doing backflips

[46:17] and where they can't wait to get us the game.

[46:19] And we're supposedly supposed to see Wonka sometime soon.

[46:22] People kept saying it was going to be at the Midwest gaming classic, but Jack is in France

[46:27] during that show.

[46:29] So I doubt you would see a New Jersey Jack game revealed if Jack is not even there, but

[46:35] maybe Pat Lawler will be there to pull the curtain off it.

[46:38] But we'll see.

[46:39] I think they need Jack because they need to show him and Pat's a great designer.

[46:42] He's not the best revealer of a product.

[46:46] So yeah, that's, yeah, that's a fair point.

[46:49] All right, let's talk about spooky because I think spooky had a nice showing with Alice

[46:54] Cooper.

[46:55] As I said in my last podcast, I thought the game came a long way in a year and I actually

[47:00] enjoyed it a lot.

[47:01] And I was surprised.

[47:02] I thought the game, when you can hear it, which I don't know if you got to play it

[47:07] Blake without all the noise of the show, but the game has really come a long way.

[47:13] Did you get a chance to jump on it?

[47:15] Yeah, I did.

[47:17] I was very impressed with the game.

[47:19] I mean, I think that, I think that even though it's been a year since they unveiled it,

[47:25] when they did that last year, it clearly was a huge step up for spooky.

[47:30] And it really looked like even at that time that it was by far their best game.

[47:35] And I think a year later, with all the work they've done to it, and they're now starting

[47:38] to get them out the door that it absolutely is their best game today.

[47:42] So you know, it's just an overall great package.

[47:46] The artwork is absolutely gorgeous.

[47:48] The animations are gorgeous.

[47:51] You know, I even, the more I played it with the time that I got on it last night, I really

[47:57] started to get a feel for the geometry on the game and getting some of that muscle memory.

[48:01] And you could get more flow going on that game than I think a lot of us initially got

[48:08] last year when we had one or two balls to be able to try it out with.

[48:14] Right.

[48:15] You know, I really like to.

[48:16] And the game, you know, it's still a tight game, but it's a shot for makeable.

[48:20] I was making everything.

[48:22] The thing that I do like about the spooky package, and this might sound weird.

[48:27] I haven't really talked about this, but it's one area of the stern game that I just always

[48:31] annoys me in terms of design.

[48:33] I just don't like the stern speaker grill area at all.

[48:39] I think it looks like, like just like an air filter there.

[48:43] It doesn't have any design element.

[48:45] And I do actually think the spooky speaker area just looks much better.

[48:51] And it's got similar size LCD.

[48:52] I think they're the same size.

[48:53] They look the same size.

[48:55] Yeah.

[48:56] But I think that, you know, for $6,500, which is where our scoopers coming in at, it does

[49:02] feel like it fits in perfectly between a stern pro and a stern premium's price point.

[49:08] Right.

[49:09] It's just it sort of slides right in there, but they're giving you a lot of art.

[49:13] They're giving you a lot of game.

[49:15] And the animations I keep saying are I'm surprised that that was not in the top three for

[49:22] the Twippies for best animation.

[49:24] I was shocked.

[49:25] But I guess it's because most people haven't received the game yet.

[49:28] And there's no real exposure to it because it's, you know, most people haven't played

[49:32] this game.

[49:33] Yeah.

[49:34] I was incredibly disappointed that that game was not nominated for best animations because

[49:40] I think that it had some of the most unique and fresh animations that, you know, not

[49:48] only the animations themselves, but the menu design as well in terms of, they don't

[49:54] cram too much information in there.

[49:55] They get your score in there.

[49:56] They let you know where you are in terms of modes and stuff.

[49:59] But there's still a lot of room for just the cool visuals like we would get on the old

[50:05] DMDs, you know.

[50:06] So I think it was very, very well done.

[50:11] I want to give a shout out to my friend, David Van Es, who also lives here in Houston.

[50:16] He's the one who did the animations for that game.

[50:18] And he is an incredibly talented guy.

[50:23] Even if the Twippies didn't recognize his work, I think a lot of people are going to

[50:26] recognize that that game has got some gorgeous work on it.

[50:30] So one thing that really stood out to me playing it again last night was the game's got

[50:37] a lot of depth to it in terms of, you know, it's, it's challenging enough that you're

[50:43] not just going to blow through mode after mode and work your way through the game even

[50:47] like you can on a game like Adam's family where you're just very easily touring the mansion

[50:51] and going room to room with Alice Cooper, you know, you've actually got to really fight

[50:57] and work your way through each of these rooms.

[50:59] And even though it's got a lot of depth to it, I think people can walk up to it and understand

[51:04] that they're essentially playing a game of clue with this machine in terms of going from

[51:09] room to room, they're collecting weapons, collecting items to fight these monsters with.

[51:14] The story line is pretty straightforward and it's not that convoluted.

[51:20] But you still have to pay attention to what you're doing, you know?

[51:23] So I do think pins needs.

[51:26] I think pins need a storyline and I just love, I love the magnetic ball save between

[51:30] the flippers.

[51:31] It like all the lights on the machine go red and you hear this, like electric and then

[51:36] it just shoots the ball straight up the middle.

[51:38] I love, I just wish pinball had more of that in every game.

[51:41] If I were a designer, I wouldn't make sure there was just something like that that was

[51:45] a surprise element, especially when it balls about the drain.

[51:48] There's nothing more exciting than having an extra life like that, but it happens in

[51:52] such a cool physical way like that.

[51:55] So look, they're all 500, I think, are spoken for and if they weren't, I would assume they're

[52:00] going to be spoken for after the show.

[52:04] So happy to see that game really come a long way in a year.

[52:08] All right, what else?

[52:09] So multi-morphic.

[52:10] So same place, same, Jerry gets the same spot every year.

[52:14] He's right there sort of like near the front.

[52:16] You come around the corner and there he is.

[52:18] He's got his games networked.

[52:20] That was the big thing this year.

[52:21] They had four machines networked together with Cosmic Cart Racing and we jumped on and we

[52:29] played a network game.

[52:30] Blake, what were your thoughts?

[52:34] I like Cosmic Cart Racing a lot as far as I think it's their most innovative upper playfield

[52:41] that they've gotten on all the games.

[52:45] The networking was a lot of fun and I see a lot of potential with that.

[52:50] I think the thing I wanted to see the most was maybe more and maybe you code this into

[52:55] the lighting.

[52:57] Maybe you could do it with a shaker motor, but I'd like to see more visual interaction

[53:02] on your own machine coming from the other players that you're playing against.

[53:06] So for example, if another cart bumps into you or interacts with you, passes you something,

[53:14] I feel like there should be some indication on the game that says that while you're playing

[53:19] it.

[53:20] But the concept of playing head to head competitively like that, it's fantastic and it's amazing

[53:26] that companies haven't done something to that effect other than some of the old school

[53:32] games like Joust which I still consider Joust to be one of the greatest pinball machines

[53:37] of all time even though it's completely different from any normal machine.

[53:41] Right.

[53:42] Yeah.

[53:43] I mean, so the one thing I noticed when we were networking is that it reminded me of Daytona

[53:48] USA back in the arcade where like all of them were linked up and you're all waiting for

[53:52] racers to all sit down and go at the same time.

[53:56] I did notice that there was like a little bit of a lag on one of the machines where like

[54:02] it was like a half a second off when it was counting down but we were all in the same

[54:05] race and so I was like, well, is that just the Wi-Fi or I don't know what was there?

[54:10] I noticed that part of it but I do agree with you when you're in the race, I just think

[54:16] there needed to be, I didn't feel like I was racing other people more than I was just

[54:20] trying to hit the ramps and get the power boost.

[54:25] The problem I have as a from a player standpoint when I was playing, you're so focused on

[54:31] looking down the play field like to the top of it where the, you know, you're trying

[54:36] to hit the shots that are in the upper area of the play field.

[54:39] And so everything is happening on the screen, you can't even see, like you can't even

[54:44] pay attention to it because you're trying to aim your shot ahead of that, like further

[54:49] up the play field.

[54:50] And so that's where I'm just like, I think they need to think about that because there's

[54:54] just too much stuff that is going on but you can't really look at all of it and do you

[55:02] need it?

[55:03] Like do you need all that stuff on the screen or can you make that a little bit of like

[55:07] less functionality because that's the only thing is I just didn't feel like I knew

[55:12] it was happening on the screen and the screen that I was looking at was the back box that

[55:16] told you what place you were in like one through four.

[55:19] Yeah.

[55:20] And even there, I just didn't get a sense of like how I really sped up other than just

[55:25] hitting the ramps.

[55:27] So I don't know.

[55:28] Yeah.

[55:29] Yeah.

[55:30] No, I think you're absolutely right.

[55:31] I mean, that was, you know, without getting a, you know, rundown of the rules and what

[55:36] we really should be doing, that was the gist of it.

[55:39] That was what I got out of it and certainly what I was trying to.

[55:42] Yeah.

[55:43] You know what I didn't need it just like to be easier was because there was all those beautiful

[55:46] lights on the ramp and I think they would go like I said, I think there's a lot of potential

[55:49] there.

[55:50] Yeah.

[55:51] Yeah.

[55:52] Um, I think that I think that once again, there's some great ideas there.

[55:58] I can only imagine what that game could be like if you had, let's say Mario Kart as

[56:06] a theme wrapped around that concept, you know, where you could be using the Playfield LCD

[56:11] to like shoot the turtle shells and, you know, fire the banana peels and stuff like that.

[56:17] And maintain that interactivity between machines.

[56:19] I think it could be a huge hit.

[56:21] I mean, it's a really interesting concept.

[56:25] I think that it's just going to blow down to the execution.

[56:27] I mean, we know that Jerry can really innovate and engineer some fantastic mechanisms.

[56:33] I mean, I think that that magnet ball lock that's on cosmic car racing is still one of

[56:39] the most innovative mechanisms that I've seen in the game in the last five years easily.

[56:45] Right.

[56:46] Look, the Jerry's on to something, whether or not this is the best implementation of it,

[56:52] but network pinball and internet connected machines are going to radically change pinball.

[56:59] Mark my words.

[57:00] And Stern is starting to do it and people are underestimating the game changer.

[57:05] This will be when it happens when you have machines connected to each other.

[57:10] The what that opens up in terms of player versus player opportunities is going to enhance

[57:17] the fun of pinball like never before.

[57:20] And I can't wait because I think people think pinball needs to, you know, can't do that.

[57:26] But it can.

[57:27] It's so, I mean, it's so awesome that if I hit a shot on my machine, that could somehow

[57:33] impact your machine, Blake.

[57:35] And I could send balls that, you know, you could have a game where like you're trying

[57:39] to get rid of the balls and only have one ball in play and I can keep feeding you more

[57:43] balls.

[57:44] And it's just there's so much opportunity to create player versus player experiences that

[57:50] is so untapped.

[57:51] And I can't wait to that happens.

[57:52] It's going to happen in the next couple of years.

[57:53] You'll see.

[57:54] Can you can you imagine if you took a game like Batman 66 and you had two machines that

[58:01] were remotely linked to each other and one player was fighting as Batman and Robin while

[58:07] the other player was getting to play as the villains trying to foil the other opponent?

[58:12] Absolutely.

[58:13] I mean, how cool would that be?

[58:15] I mean, that would be a really interesting dynamic, you know, between two people.

[58:19] And it wouldn't be hard, right?

[58:20] So you're Batman and Robin and you've got to hit, you know, you let's say there's like

[58:24] a mode where it's like it's a five minute car chase and do you capture the Joker?

[58:29] Does he get away?

[58:30] Right.

[58:31] Right.

[58:32] And then during that, you got to hit your shots.

[58:33] I got to hit my shots to escape.

[58:34] And whoever is more successful wins.

[58:38] It'd be so much fun.

[58:40] And I think it creates infinite storytelling as well.

[58:43] It's like a choose your own adventure.

[58:44] Absolutely.

[58:45] The type of a layout.

[58:46] You know, so you know what it also does, like which pinball doesn't have now.

[58:50] Because right now if you think about a pinball experience, you play a game and you kind

[58:54] of have to play through the three balls in the way the game is coded to, you know, progress

[59:01] through the game.

[59:02] But here's the thing, if I only have 10 minutes and I want to play pinball or like, let's

[59:06] say a five minutes and I want to play pinball and you do too.

[59:09] And I'm like, Hey man, like why don't you play a quick game of like Batman, Joker chase?

[59:14] Like we could.

[59:15] We could jump in and start the mode and just play and see who wins and then that's it.

[59:20] You can have a quick player versus player experience.

[59:24] You can't do that in pinball right now.

[59:26] You're always on the same journey every time you you plunge.

[59:30] Absolutely.

[59:31] Yeah.

[59:32] I mean, there is a lot of potential.

[59:33] And like you said, Jerry is definitely on to something, whether it's in this format or

[59:38] some other format, you know, his ideas are definitely headed in the right direction.

[59:45] Right.

[59:46] So something I was a little disappointed in at T.P.

[59:48] And this is nothing to do with the show.

[59:50] There were just no surprises.

[59:51] There was like no surprises.

[59:53] Yeah.

[59:54] That's I got the same feeling and you know what that that was a feeling that I had going

[59:59] into the show.

[01:00:00] Honestly, there was there was nothing that I was just super excited to see at the show.

[01:00:05] Honestly.

[01:00:06] And I have to admit that the most exciting thing that happened this whole weekend, you know,

[01:00:13] the show is a fantastic show and the vendors are awesome.

[01:00:15] I was very pleased to see how many great new vendors they had there.

[01:00:19] But the Twippies were freaking hilarious, amazingly organized and executed.

[01:00:26] And I think that that was the highlight of the whole weekend for me, honestly.

[01:00:30] It was awesome.

[01:00:31] And we do have to congratulate again, Zach, Greg and Jeff and all the presenters and all

[01:00:36] the people who worked behind the scenes to make that show what it was.

[01:00:41] I think once they aired the opening sequence, everyone realized that we were in for a treat.

[01:00:46] I mean, it was it was so well done and it was so much fun being there.

[01:00:52] You know, were there any surprises and we'll talk a little bit about, you know, the

[01:00:56] favorite pinball podcast surprise.

[01:00:57] But were there any surprises in terms of who won what that you thought could have gone

[01:01:03] another way?

[01:01:05] There were a couple of categories and I can't remember which one specifically, but there

[01:01:10] were a few categories that I just really assumed were going to go in favor of Iron

[01:01:14] Maiden and Deadpool ended up winning.

[01:01:16] Right.

[01:01:17] Best call out was I was shocked that Iron Maiden did not win.

[01:01:21] Like even when they gave the examples, the Iron Maiden ones were incredible and the Deadpool

[01:01:24] ones were so corny and Deadpool one.

[01:01:27] Yeah, I thought there might be some backlash on Deadpool winning for call outs because

[01:01:32] everybody wanted a more R rated version of those call outs, you know.

[01:01:37] So I actually, I actually really thought that that was going to hurt Deadpool winning that

[01:01:41] award a lot.

[01:01:42] Actually, the biggest surprise to me and this wasn't for a game that won the award, but I

[01:01:50] was shocked that parts of the Caribbean was in the top three for best artwork.

[01:01:56] I really was because I assumed we knew that Deadpool and Iron Maiden were going to be

[01:02:02] two of the three.

[01:02:03] But I really thought that the Beatles might have been the third machine that was going

[01:02:07] to be in the running.

[01:02:09] Right.

[01:02:10] You know what I think happened to the Beatles?

[01:02:12] I think people are just so when the voting was happening, right?

[01:02:15] When the trippy voting was happening, I think people like were originally really down on

[01:02:20] the Beatles because of the price gouging, it seemed.

[01:02:23] And I think that hurt it.

[01:02:24] I mean, it's crazy how that hurts that shouldn't take away from the artistic work that

[01:02:29] Franchie did on the game.

[01:02:32] But that's kind of what the trippy's are, you know.

[01:02:34] It is a little bit of just how are you feeling?

[01:02:37] It's a popularity contest for all these categories.

[01:02:41] And if you don't catch a game when the mood is right, when voting is going on, it kind

[01:02:48] of doesn't matter.

[01:02:49] You know, people might go again, something even if it deserves to be there.

[01:02:52] Yeah.

[01:02:53] And look, I mean, you know, I don't want, I'm not saying that the artwork on parts is

[01:02:59] bad.

[01:03:00] It's actually for it being Photoshop together and airbrushed and whatnot, it's actually

[01:03:05] very beautifully executed.

[01:03:08] I just think that when you're comparing that to the true artistic talent that Chris has

[01:03:16] got in terms of hand drawing and painting and, you know, doing all the work he does for

[01:03:23] his machines, I was surprised to see that something involving Photoshop would, you know,

[01:03:29] would take a third place spot essentially over the work that he's done.

[01:03:34] So, but I really sincerely hope that it's going to be Chris's year this year.

[01:03:38] I think that, you know, he really came out of the gate swinging in 2019 with the monster's

[01:03:43] art package.

[01:03:44] I mean, they're absolutely gorgeous.

[01:03:46] So, but overall, I was surprised at Pirates, got an artwork nomination that I mean.

[01:03:53] It's going to be hard for him to win this year because I don't know if he has another

[01:03:56] stern game in the hopper for this year.

[01:03:58] I don't think monsters, you know, monsters just came out and there are so many more titles

[01:04:03] coming out.

[01:04:04] We'll people vote for monsters come like 9, 10, 11 months from now.

[01:04:09] So we'll see, we'll see, but it doesn't take away from how awesome the monsters look.

[01:04:13] The biggest surprise to me in the Twippies was, Pirates of the Caribbean winning for best

[01:04:19] theme integration.

[01:04:21] Yeah.

[01:04:23] That also has no choice from the movie.

[01:04:26] How did it integrate the theme in the best way?

[01:04:31] The category wasn't you did the best with the assets you had category.

[01:04:37] It was best theme integration.

[01:04:40] Right.

[01:04:41] It was, that was once again, I think, I think when the voting was going on, I think people

[01:04:48] were very much on riding on a high on Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:04:53] And I think that to your point about the Beatles, kind of leaving a bad taste in people's

[01:04:57] mouths at the time voting was going on.

[01:05:00] I think the same thing may have happened in Pirates's favor as well.

[01:05:04] Well, here's what happened.

[01:05:05] I think what happened was this.

[01:05:07] I think, you know, Iron Maiden, obviously humongously popular at the Twippies and people

[01:05:14] love the game.

[01:05:15] It was really hard to vote for Iron Maiden as best theme integration on, you know, why?

[01:05:19] Because everyone knows it was archer.

[01:05:22] Everyone knows that it was just a re-skin of an older game.

[01:05:25] Right.

[01:05:26] So I don't think people wanted to vote for that game as theme integration.

[01:05:29] And I think Deadpool with the PG call outs felt like you couldn't vote for that for theme

[01:05:36] integration, which is ironic because it won for best call outs.

[01:05:40] And then if you were to ask me in terms of theme integration, I think kind of Pirates

[01:05:47] sort of snuck in there because all the, you know, the stern ones sort of kind of killed

[01:05:52] themselves in weird ways.

[01:05:54] And I would look at Beatles like maybe I think supreme actually was the best theme integration

[01:05:59] when you think about it.

[01:06:00] Like all supreme is when you think about integrating a theme into pinball.

[01:06:04] That's all supreme is is the big logo.

[01:06:06] Yeah.

[01:06:07] Yeah.

[01:06:08] Well, you do bring up a really good point that I honestly hadn't thought about too much.

[01:06:13] And that is the fact that Pirates for lack of assets, even the way that they have specifically

[01:06:21] focused on elements from the movies and custom design mechanisms around those elements.

[01:06:30] From that standpoint, it really is a great theme integration, you know, even even aside

[01:06:35] from the lack of the characters and the dialogue and stuff, you know, a rocking pirate ship

[01:06:42] makes sense for parts of the Caribbean game.

[01:06:45] But you're right, the stern games just more or less, they integrate a theme around whatever

[01:06:51] fan layout that they can modify, you know, without really adding a custom mechanism necessarily.

[01:06:59] Sure.

[01:07:00] Sure.

[01:07:01] I mentioned at the beginning when we started talking that I would talk about the booing

[01:07:06] incident when they announced the favorite pinball podcast.

[01:07:08] And here's what I want to do.

[01:07:09] I don't really want to talk about that much anymore.

[01:07:12] You know, I think it only gives attention to the person who did that.

[01:07:16] I think, you know, the person who did it.

[01:07:18] And I know who it is.

[01:07:19] I'm not going to out them on this show.

[01:07:22] There are tournament player from New York.

[01:07:25] It's I think that person just should apologize to Greg, Zach and Jeff.

[01:07:30] And for all the people that got disrupted by but mainly to the guys who ran the show.

[01:07:34] And I just want to say I wasn't expecting that.

[01:07:37] I think some of this is just payback for what happened at the New York City pinball thing.

[01:07:41] And again, I apologize to all the people involved with that.

[01:07:45] I keep apologizing.

[01:07:46] Someone even said I should apologize on stage for that again.

[01:07:49] But let's let's just all move forward.

[01:07:51] I mean, I hope we all can forgive and look, I forgive the guy who booed me at the Twippies.

[01:07:55] I don't I it wasn't respectful.

[01:07:58] But I forgive you man.

[01:07:59] If you have a problem with me, I'll happily talk to you about it.

[01:08:02] You might just hate my guts and not want to do anything with me ever.

[01:08:04] And that's cool.

[01:08:05] But let's not let's not ever again take it to a level where we're disrespecting other

[01:08:11] people's hard work.

[01:08:13] You know, you want to come up and say something to me that's cool.

[01:08:16] But there are so many people that worked really hard on the show.

[01:08:19] And I think they deserve the respect of not having someone to do something like that.

[01:08:25] And I'll leave it at that.

[01:08:26] And we'll start a new error in pinball where we can all respect each other and stop doing

[01:08:33] stuff that is disrupting people's good time in the hobby.

[01:08:37] That sound fair Blake.

[01:08:38] I think that's fair Chris.

[01:08:40] You know, I think, you know, if what he did last night was really due to the incident

[01:08:47] in New York, you know, then all right, let's call it a wash and move on.

[01:08:53] I mean, I think that, you know, you were certainly wrong in what happened in New York, but

[01:08:58] you have manned up and you've, you know, apologized and realized that that was not something

[01:09:03] to be proud of.

[01:09:05] And I hope that this guy as mug as he was, I hope that he realizes that that was a very,

[01:09:11] you know, just a full thing to do, especially, you know, when you've got people like Jeff

[01:09:17] and Greg and Zach who are some of the nicest people in this hobby that have worked their

[01:09:22] asses off, you know, organizing this.

[01:09:24] I mean, those guys were running around like crazy yesterday, making sure that everything

[01:09:29] was organized and ready to go for those awards.

[01:09:33] And they, you know, I think everybody saw they did a phenomenal job saying, yeah.

[01:09:39] And just to clarify two things for people because I hear people talking about this.

[01:09:43] First thing, the Christopher Franchi smashing of zombie yeti's award.

[01:09:47] So this, I've heard so many different takes on this.

[01:09:50] I think, I think when people saw it over the internet, it didn't come across as well.

[01:09:56] And they thought it was real.

[01:09:58] And then they thought it was like a really awkward moment.

[01:10:00] And I don't know if Greg and Zach were in on the joke.

[01:10:03] And I think it didn't translate very well for people.

[01:10:06] What did you think when that happened?

[01:10:08] Okay.

[01:10:09] So I got the whole rundown after the fact of what, what happened.

[01:10:14] Greg, Zach and Jeff, all of them were in on it.

[01:10:17] Okay.

[01:10:18] They knew about it.

[01:10:19] The only person who wasn't in on it was Mike Vinicar, who was up there receiving the

[01:10:24] award, you know, on behalf of the Stern team.

[01:10:29] My initial thought, I happened to be sitting right behind Mike.

[01:10:34] And after that whole thing went down, I did think that initially I thought Chris was just

[01:10:41] joking because I had heard that they were going to do some sort of gag stuff.

[01:10:47] And it was going to be kind of an inside joke type thing.

[01:10:49] So I knew that Chris wasn't being serious, especially because he just went back to his seat

[01:10:55] in the audience.

[01:10:56] I mean, if he was really serious, he would have stormed out of the room.

[01:10:57] But anyways, the only reason I thought maybe it was real was because as Mike was coming

[01:11:04] back to his seat, he just had a look on his face.

[01:11:08] And he was just shaking his head like, what the hell was that all about?

[01:11:12] And it made sense that, you know, it was a joke.

[01:11:16] It just wasn't in on it, unfortunately.

[01:11:19] And I think that they had also agreed before the show that Mike and Chris were going to

[01:11:25] kind of stagger who was receiving what awards and Chris originally was supposed to be the

[01:11:30] one to receive Jeremy's award.

[01:11:32] In fact, he had talked to Jeremy about it a couple of weeks ago.

[01:11:37] And also, by the way, the trophy that was destroyed was an extra trophy that they had.

[01:11:43] It was not Jeremy's real trophy.

[01:11:45] Jeremy will be getting his real Twippy train.

[01:11:47] Right.

[01:11:48] So I think what happened to is if you were watching it across the internet or on TV, it

[01:11:55] was out of frame when he stomps it.

[01:11:58] So people were just like, wait, what's going on?

[01:11:59] Because you couldn't see it.

[01:12:00] I think everyone in attendance got more of the full picture.

[01:12:05] So it was clearly a joke.

[01:12:06] So everyone, if you think that was real, Christopher Franci is not a bastard.

[01:12:10] It was a joke.

[01:12:11] It might not have gone over as well.

[01:12:13] And I think everyone was learning too when these live shows, it just takes, there's an

[01:12:17] approach to getting humor and getting people laughing and getting the room going.

[01:12:21] It's not as easy as it seems.

[01:12:26] The other thing that was just a joke just to clarify that George Gomez is not my informant

[01:12:30] that hands me terrible information.

[01:12:33] That was a joke.

[01:12:34] OK.

[01:12:35] So I think some people thought that George Gomez actually did tell me that Chicago gaming

[01:12:39] company was making alien.

[01:12:41] He did not.

[01:12:42] So if you didn't pick up on that sarcasm, make God help you.

[01:12:47] So Blake, anything else I think we're at the hour point now.

[01:12:49] I just want to know if there was any final thoughts you had about the show.

[01:12:52] And then we'll wrap it up.

[01:12:54] Yeah.

[01:12:56] What other highlight from the Twippies?

[01:12:57] I got to say, I kind of thought this was a big deal because these two people definitely

[01:13:03] didn't have to do this, especially for a first ever pinball award show that was live.

[01:13:08] But how cool was it that they got John Reese Davies of Indiana Jones and Worthy Rings

[01:13:13] fame and Butch Patrick from the Monsters to actually go up and present two of the awards?

[01:13:19] It was great.

[01:13:20] I thought that was amazing.

[01:13:21] It was awesome.

[01:13:22] I mean, to hear John Reese Davies give his jackpot call outs in person was awesome.

[01:13:30] You know what I don't.

[01:13:31] Yeah.

[01:13:32] And it was such a great night.

[01:13:33] That room was packed.

[01:13:34] There were people standing outside of the doors watching this ceremony.

[01:13:38] And on top of that, it wasn't all just a big joke.

[01:13:42] I know when the Twippies, when Jeff started the Twippies last year, it kind of initially

[01:13:46] seemed like it was just kind of a joke.

[01:13:48] And, you know, nobody was going to take it quite as seriously.

[01:13:51] But I'll say this, you know, every manufacturer that had a horse in the race last night, they

[01:13:58] were in the room.

[01:14:00] They were watching it.

[01:14:01] And the people that didn't win, I think they still, you know, they wanted to win.

[01:14:07] It was an honor to win an award last night and to have your machine and all of your hard

[01:14:12] work recognized.

[01:14:14] And I thought it was phenomenal how they kicked off the ceremony with the highlight reel

[01:14:19] of every machine that had been voted on.

[01:14:22] Because unfortunately, you know, a lot of those machines didn't get mentioned another

[01:14:28] time throughout the rest of the ceremony.

[01:14:30] But I think it just goes to show you that there are a lot of people putting a lot of work

[01:14:35] into these things.

[01:14:36] And it's not just some stupid little plastic trophy that it actually matters to people that

[01:14:41] the peers, that their peers and their customers who were so passionate about these things feel

[01:14:49] so strongly and positive about the work that these guys have done.

[01:14:53] So it was an awesome event.

[01:14:55] I really, really hope that Jeff and Greg and Zach will do this again live next year.

[01:15:01] Even if it's not a T.P.F. if they try to do it in another show to kind of spread the

[01:15:06] wealth a little bit, I think that, you know, people will really enjoy seeing this stuff

[01:15:11] in person.

[01:15:12] Absolutely, absolutely.

[01:15:13] I mean, it was a terrific evening.

[01:15:15] Thank you again for letting me crash in your room at T.P.F.

[01:15:17] It's becoming an annual thing.

[01:15:20] It's always a pleasure hanging out at T.P.F.

[01:15:23] And for those of you out there, you know, we didn't even say this on this episode, but

[01:15:27] the shows are all about the people.

[01:15:28] It's all about hanging out with your pinball friends and making new pinball friends.

[01:15:32] It's not even about the games because at the end of the day, all these games, they're

[01:15:35] only fun when friends come over your house and you enjoy the hobby with other people.

[01:15:40] And that's why we're in it.

[01:15:41] We get to meet all these awesome people and geek out over pinball.

[01:15:44] So Blake, thank you for coming on.

[01:15:46] I know we're both exhausted.

[01:15:48] Let's get some rest and recharge.

[01:15:50] Thanks Chris.

[01:15:51] I appreciate it.

[01:15:52] Great hanging out with you this weekend.

[01:15:54] And for everybody else that was at T.P.F.

[01:15:57] I sincerely hope that you guys had fun for those of you that went for the first time.

[01:16:02] I helped put that show together too.

[01:16:04] And I know everybody that volunteers and works their butts off to make it happen is truly

[01:16:10] dedicated to putting on a fantastic show.

[01:16:14] So support your local shows, create new local shows and help share pinball with the whole

[01:16:21] new generation of people.

[01:16:22] All right.

[01:16:23] Well said.

[01:16:24] Everyone have a great night.

[01:16:25] We'll be back with more of Canada's pinball podcast soon later.
