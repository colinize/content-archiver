[00:00] I knew this would happen. I knew this would happen. I knew I would put up a podcast Tuesday morning and I would get to work and dead pool

[00:25] would be revealed to the world which means I would have to do what I always do on Canadian Pimbal Podcasts and that's get up in immediate response to a new Pimbal machine from Stern Pimbal. So let's talk about on this little mini episode of Canadian Pimbal Podcasts my thoughts and reactions to seeing dead pool for the first time. Now first I lost the bed. I thought the bobblehead of dead pool would not make its way

[00:55] into the game. I thought Stern was just taking the piss out of us but I have to say this I have to say this after seeing it in the game it really doesn't annoy me the same way that the tie fighter on a spring drove me crazy because I actually think they're going to work into the game the fact that there is a dead pool on a spring in the game because when you look at this game and you look at how Stern is marketing this game.

[01:25] I think it's pretty genius. I really do. I think the entire game is going to be in hilarious journey and almost like making fun of the fact that you're playing a dead pool Pimbal machine and I think there's going to be a lot of that just like taking the piss out of Pimbal. Now so let's talk about what we know so far about the game and we know what the game looks like and I think collectively.

[01:52] Collectively everyone is having the same reaction to the artwork in the game and that is that Zambi Yeti is a god that the man is able to make I think one of the most gorgeous Pimbal machines ever and and you could argue that this is his finest creation to date and I'm actually looking at the photos right now and I have to say it's pretty effing amazing.

[02:22] I mean when I first saw it really just looks like you're jumping into a comic book world. I mean I don't see how you cannot get excited by the amount of detail and stuff going on in the game itself.

[02:37] Now I did see some people have some reservations saying that they thought the art might have been too busy and I just want to say that I could see how people might say that you know that you really can't see the art is not guiding you on what to shoot.

[02:53] It kind of just feels like there's art everywhere but I also don't feel that that takes away at all from this game because I think it's pretty clear.

[03:04] What to shoot at and the shots in the game and what I love about the game here too when I look at the artwork you know with the big dead pool.

[03:13] In the middle with his arms like a behind his back grabbing his katana blades and then you've got let's see you've got the.

[03:21] Let's see we've got Colossus we've got I'm trying to read all these characters like is it so on it's the T-rex the meglodon.

[03:31] You've got mystique in the middle what's interesting about this art is it's actually a little bit different than the photo that leak remember the photo that leaked we had I believe it was Colossus is where juggernaut was and and also we had a big Wolverine on the right side that is now somewhere else on the playfield so there have been some changes to the original concept art but I have to say I mean the colors.

[04:00] The vibrancy the just the way zombie Eddie when he's allowed to sort of bring his style into the comic book genre.

[04:12] I think the game just looks absolutely phenomenal and I do I didn't get so much detail here that it's really hard to know even where to where to focus and where to talk about.

[04:24] So what I want to do is just say I think we all should be super thankful where we're at when it comes to the kind of artworks turn is putting into pinball machines I mean it's at the point now where these new machines I mean iron maiden you know Christopher

[04:40] French Batman and Guardians of the galaxy dirty don his work on Erasmith and on Metallica these games are now we have to we have to say that these are probably some of the nicest pinball artwork games we've ever seen in the history of pinball in the history of

[05:00] Pumble I mean I really do I think this game puts almost every you know every other generation pinball artwork a little bit to shame in terms of the detail that is on this playfield and and and I love it I love it I mean it's you know me I'm I'm I'm a fan of artwork I do think that when games are off they are works of art that sit in our house and how could you not how could you not

[05:26] sort of look at this and just you know how could it not bring a smile to your face on all the different things going on and I love the details like I love the little phrases I love that you know down by the flipper area you know he did pull saying I'm glad this is not another movie themed pin you know it's and I love the phrase like you know I it's something about like the world under glass hold on I'm going to zoom in here it's so freaking funny yeah at least this is not another movie

[05:56] themed pin and then in the outland area it says like pinball to me something like pinball to me is glass above a world you know and it's just like they're totally taking the piss out of pinball and out of all the criticisms of of always making movie themes and even knowing that they were not making a movie

[06:20] theme of Deadpool I think they're taking the piss out of it with this game and it you know you might be able to hear that I'm excited because I do I think this game

[06:28] absolutely looks phenomenal I actually think it looks even better than iron maiden and then that's not to take anything away from iron maiden in fact I kind of wish there was more space between zombie yeti releases and the reason I say that is they are these incredible works of art and they are things that I think

[06:50] are highly anticipated in the pinball world and I think it's kind of like it's not unfortunate I just wish we would have had more time between the two because you know I could I'll tell you why because I think a lot of people out there are going to want both and I kind of think people want a little bit more time

[07:09] before they have to you know they feel compelled to buy another game but if you were to look at this game just from a visual standpoint and say does this make you want to buy it I think the answer is

[07:20] yes now the other part that's really cool about this game is what's done is doing with the LCD animations and I know there's been a lot of debate back and forth on

[07:29] pin sight about this but again I think people are out of their minds if they don't think it's really cool to have sort of that throwback retro like 16 bit arcade game graphics

[07:39] is going to be what's in the game and it's not only going to be that it's not only going to be that but it makes total sense for for deadpool to have sort of like throwback graphics that are sort of like irrelevant which is kind of like the theme of his character

[07:54] in the marvel universe is that he's always battling relevancy and then I also heard from George Gomez in the great interview he did with Nate shivers that that's not the only thing you're going to see on the LCD that you're actually going to have

[08:09] like high res visuals of Deadpool when he breaks the fourth wall and talks to you as you're playing the game and I've just heard from some people at Stern that I know that actually still talk to me that once you hear the music

[08:24] once you hear the call outs once you see how it's all integrated this is going to go down as quite possibly one of the most fun and enjoyable pinball machines Stern has ever put out there now first and

[08:38] foremost let's just let's just table that for a minute because you know hype from people that work there you can't really believe it right I want to see what other people say when they play the game and

[08:50] their objective but the game looks a lot of fun it you can't deny the fact that the layout looks great it's George Gomez design game and I always love when I hear George talk about how he just makes sure that the game shoots really well

[09:07] before he does anything else and and and if you've been listening to this podcast and you've been listening to my criticisms of some of the new boutique offerings in Alice Cooper and in

[09:18] Houdini you know I've always said like I just think a lot of these games they needed to have more work done to the design of the geometry of the game before they started

[09:30] doing the artwork and before they moved on from the geometry because I think a lot of them just don't shoot well and I think when you look at Deadpool it really does look like a game that's going to be fun to shoot

[09:41] there's no denying that I mean I love the sword lock on the right side where the ball gets locked in the handle of the katana it just looks fucking cool

[09:51] and that's the other thing about stern is that they just know how to make themes that look fnc all their kind of edgy themes that are perfect for the male demographic they're going after I mean does this not look like the kind of game that a grown man would want to put in his or her

[10:12] as her a grown a grown man in his or her that the kind of game that someone would want to put in their like man cave or in their arcade room I mean it's like is perfectly that kind of thing you know I don't think

[10:26] you're getting that same kind of enthusiasm when you think about pirates with the Caribbean right I think Rob Zombie was

[10:33] even a cooler theme than Alice Cooper even was.

[10:36] But I think, you know, those rock and roll metal bands work.

[10:40] You know, Willie Wonka is that as cool of a theme as like a Deadpool?

[10:44] I don't know.

[10:45] I don't know.

[10:46] But, you know, I'm saying that this game is exactly the kind of theme and it has the

[10:54] exact kind of like edginess that dudes want.

[10:58] I love the crystal ball.

[11:00] I love the disco ball.

[11:01] The disco ball that's floating, you know, over the ramp that is hit by the right orbit.

[11:07] I heard that the lights are going to go off.

[11:10] The GI is going to go off in the game and just the disco ball is going to be illuminated.

[11:16] It this game just like without even shooting it, without even seeing it being played really,

[11:21] it just looks fun.

[11:24] Like it just looks like it's going to be a campy fun ride.

[11:28] And I know that they got the voice actor that did the Deadpool games.

[11:33] So it's going to be, you know, I think that's also good news.

[11:37] Like I'm really not hearing anything that is problematic about the game itself right now.

[11:43] Again, we're very early on in Deadpool.

[11:46] All right.

[11:47] So let's talk about the features of the Ellie because I was talking earlier about the

[11:53] features of the Ellie and what we thought was going to be in it.

[11:56] So I want to read for you guys the feature matrix.

[11:59] So here is what you get on the Ellie.

[12:02] You get one of 500 machines.

[12:05] You get a certificate of authenticity signed by Gary Stern.

[12:09] All right.

[12:10] That's worthless.

[12:11] You get an autographed by game designer, George Gomez.

[12:14] That's not really any value.

[12:16] I'm trying to put this into the context of what actually is more money going into the

[12:20] machine.

[12:21] You get a serialized number plate.

[12:23] That's not worth anything.

[12:24] You get high definition anti reflection pinball glass.

[12:27] Okay.

[12:28] That has some value.

[12:29] You get high powered speaker system with three channel amplifier.

[12:32] Okay.

[12:33] That has some value.

[12:34] Now these are all things are Ellie only.

[12:36] You get illuminated speaker rings in Deadpool red.

[12:39] Deadpool red as opposed to red.

[12:41] Okay.

[12:42] I'm sure whatever.

[12:44] Limited edition mirrored back glass featuring hand drawn art by Zambi Yeti.

[12:49] All right.

[12:50] We get that.

[12:51] I don't think the limited edition artwork on the translate is any different than the

[12:57] translate art that's on the premium.

[13:01] Let me see if I can confirm that right now.

[13:04] I'm looking.

[13:05] Oh wait.

[13:06] No, we hold on pro premium and L.E.

[13:12] Yeah.

[13:13] They're the same.

[13:14] They're the same, I believe.

[13:15] But I do like on the L.E. on the plaque.

[13:19] It says like, ooh, you're fancy something like that.

[13:22] I'm a little surprised.

[13:24] I'm a little surprised that you don't get a different translate art on the L.E.

[13:29] Let's see.

[13:30] You also get the T.Rex time travel quest themed cabinet art by Zambi Yeti.

[13:35] You get the L.E. model exclusive art blades.

[13:39] You get the powder coated metal flag Deadpool red side armor hinges legs in front lockdown

[13:44] molding.

[13:45] A shaker motor and music from the original Deadpool soundtrack, a 12 inch vinyl LP featuring

[13:52] 11 original music tracks with cover art by Zambi Yeti, which is really cool.

[13:56] Is this in response to Scott Denese giving people a mixtape with total nuclear annihilation?

[14:03] Now, maybe.

[14:04] There is a lot of speculation that Stern feels a little bit burned that Denese went with

[14:10] spooky instead of letting Stern make TNA.

[14:13] Maybe this is a little bit of a jab at that.

[14:16] I don't know.

[14:17] I don't really think so.

[14:18] I don't think they really care.

[14:19] That is all of what separates the L.E.

[14:22] There's a whole bunch of other stuff.

[14:23] I'm not going to read the whole matrix list.

[14:26] How do I think about the T.Rex artwork on the L.E.?

[14:32] I think it looks cool.

[14:34] I think it looks cool.

[14:36] At first, I was like, wait, Deadpool is not even on it, but it kind of looks like he is

[14:39] riding next to the T.Rex and I think he is grabbing something or his tongue or I don't

[14:45] know.

[14:46] It's kind of hard to see.

[14:47] We didn't really get high-res images, but I think it's going to look really freaking

[14:51] dope.

[14:52] I love the red and the yellow and everything going on there.

[14:57] Look, I just think Zambi Yeti knocked it out of the park.

[15:01] I think Stern has another spectacular looking game on its hands.

[15:06] I love the 16-bit LCD graphics.

[15:09] I love that there's this image I'm looking at where Deadpool is standing next to the

[15:15] L.E. game and in the background are like old Stern arcade machines and there's a sea

[15:19] which pinball machine.

[15:21] I just think the whole thing has this sort of like campiness to it that is perfect for

[15:27] pinball.

[15:28] I'm just like in comparison.

[15:32] It's like, I heard people saying Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle has some of the best

[15:36] artwork in pinball and it has great artwork.

[15:39] But man, look at this now.

[15:42] Look at the bar that keeps getting raised and I think that Zambi Yeti has now just officially

[15:49] just, he is the best pinball artist going right now.

[15:54] I think it's just, I love it because I think it's healthy competition.

[15:58] I know that Franchie and Donnie, I know all the guys over there.

[16:03] They enjoy watching what each other do but they also compete to be the best and I do

[16:08] think this game is absolutely phenomenal and is going to go down as just like an amazing

[16:15] visual pinball machine.

[16:17] Look at it because I haven't played the game.

[16:19] So we really don't have that much to go on.

[16:23] Let's talk about, as I look at the game here, I'm trying to think about the drop targets

[16:30] are neat.

[16:31] The sword lock is really neat.

[16:33] I like the fact that there's like drop targets that you hit and then you hit like a target

[16:38] to move the, you know, the deadpool figure.

[16:42] Would I have liked there have been an actual bash figure in this game?

[16:47] Absolutely.

[16:48] I think if you, if you were to look at this game and ask yourself, is there one glowing

[16:54] emission from this game and I think you have to say there really isn't a toy in the game

[17:02] that interacts with the ball that feels like completely like original and magical.

[17:09] You know, I don't even think there's any magnets in this game.

[17:12] So there's like definitely a lack of mech design going on at Stern lately and I just,

[17:22] I just wish there was a little bit something more for the ball to interact with and I say

[17:27] that because, you know, I think when you look at some of their old games, like, you know,

[17:30] and just having like, you know, the magneto figure or the Wolverine character that you

[17:36] bashed or like the incredible Hulk figure that banged his arms, I think we're really

[17:41] lacking in that category and I could do one of two things.

[17:46] I could endlessly complain about that and say I'm not going to go in on a game like this

[17:50] or I'm not excited about this or I could play the game and see how it is and do those

[17:55] things really, really matter.

[17:57] Now you know me, you know me, you've listened to the show.

[18:00] I'm a fan of toys.

[18:02] I am.

[18:03] I think toys in Pimbal Machine, in Pimbal Machines like really separate it and make Pimbal

[18:09] come to life and then rather there'd be more toys than no toys in a game and I think,

[18:15] you know, Iron Maiden to me was a game that didn't really have a lot of toys, Deadpool's

[18:19] now a game that didn't have a lot of toys.

[18:22] And what's going to be interesting, you know, if this game comes out in the next few

[18:26] weeks which it is, when you look at George Gomez's other game that he'll, it's funny because

[18:31] Gomez is going to be competing against Gomez for sales at the same time.

[18:36] A little, you know, he probably didn't think that 20 years later, Monster Bash would be

[18:40] competing against his brand new game.

[18:43] But Monster Bash is a game with nothing but toys, right, with nothing but mechanisms

[18:48] that interact with the ball, nothing but toys that move around the play field, things

[18:53] that you hit physically.

[18:55] So completely, completely different kinds of games, you know, coming out years apart,

[19:03] years apart.

[19:04] So I think it's a good day for Pimbal.

[19:07] I think people, I'm reading the comments, I think people are really excited about this

[19:11] machine.

[19:12] I think that people are starting to realize that, you know, Stern is just on a roll.

[19:19] I mean, it is no longer like the, you know, the hit and then the miss and then the miss

[19:26] and then the head.

[19:27] I think that Stern is, they found a groove.

[19:31] They found a groove.

[19:32] They found a groove by getting some of the best artists in the world to join their ranks.

[19:37] They found a groove by getting a design team and a coding team on board so that we're

[19:43] no longer getting, you know, empty products.

[19:47] I do think this game is going to sell well.

[19:51] Will it sell out?

[19:52] Will the Ellie sell out?

[19:53] Well, they haven't already.

[19:56] They haven't already and so that is, you know, Iron Maiden sold out in one day.

[20:03] Other games have sold out in one day like Ghostbusters.

[20:06] You know, this one hasn't.

[20:09] But I think here's what's going to happen.

[20:11] I think once people see more of the gameplay footage of this game, I think all the Ellie

[20:17] 's are going to be gobbled up.

[20:19] I just do.

[20:20] I think people are going to want the nicest version.

[20:23] A lot of you guys out there that I think that's what you like to have.

[20:27] But it's just getting hard, man, because here's what's hard for guys out there.

[20:32] What if Stern makes four great games here?

[20:34] You want to own all them.

[20:35] Like, that's getting close to like $40,000.

[20:39] You're going to shell out for Pimball machines in a single year.

[20:43] And that's tough.

[20:44] But I don't see them stopping.

[20:46] I don't think anything stops this momentum that they have.

[20:49] You know, I think again, whenever Stern shows stuff like this, it can't be a good day for

[20:56] spooky Pimball.

[20:57] It can't be a good day for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[21:00] It can't be a good day for American Pimball.

[21:03] It can't be.

[21:04] And you know, these games will hurt them more than those companies can hurt Stern because,

[21:13] you know, people are going to buy this game.

[21:15] You know, people are going to buy this game over other games.

[21:18] And you know, again, like I just think like look at the hand drawn artwork on this game.

[21:23] Now go look at the artwork on Pirates of the Caribbean.

[21:27] And you tell me, you tell me, you know, which one's got nicer art.

[21:33] And I get it.

[21:34] You know, I think Pirates is going for very much like the photo realism of the movie artwork.

[21:40] But what I love about this game and I think this is rare.

[21:42] This is rare in Pimball and George Gomez keeps saying this is they were much more free

[21:48] to do what they wanted to do with this game.

[21:51] And it feels like Marvel was really chill with the Deadpool license and let's turn have

[21:56] a lot of freedom to just have some fun and go crazy with it.

[22:00] And I think Deadpool is a property's always been sort of like that red headed stepchild

[22:04] of Marvel where they've kind of just been like, effort, you know.

[22:08] Now there won't be an R rated mode in the game.

[22:11] I got confirmation on that.

[22:13] It's going to be PG 13.

[22:15] Now does that mean there'll be some curse words?

[22:17] I believe you can curse in PG 13 movies, but I'm not sure how they're going to integrate

[22:23] it into the pen, but there will be no R rated Deadpool in this game.

[22:30] So there's that.

[22:31] So that that kind of is a bummer for people who want to have a little bit more of a

[22:35] racey humor with Deadpool.

[22:38] You know, something I've been thinking about when we know this game is designed to, you

[22:42] know, to be funny and to make you laugh is how long do jokes stay funny and pimple and

[22:48] how repetitive will things get after a while and will it still have long term appeal if

[22:56] it is designed to sort of, you know, just be like a comedy show.

[23:00] I'm just curious about that.

[23:02] I'm also curious as to what the storyline is.

[23:04] I'm also excited that this game doesn't have to follow the narrative of a set script because

[23:11] of a film and that they're creating their own original storyline based upon the world

[23:16] of Deadpool.

[23:17] Now I have to be honest, I don't really know the Deadpool comic world so much.

[23:21] I know the character, but I didn't know he went back in time and fought like T-Rex's

[23:26] and Meg Lodons and all this stuff.

[23:29] So news to me that that is part of the Deadpool universe.

[23:34] All right, anything else going on?

[23:36] I mean, again, I just think like my prediction is this.

[23:39] I think this game is going to be on a lot of people's radars.

[23:43] I also think, you know, once we see Monster Bash remake, once we see that game, we're going

[23:50] to have a lot of titles competing for dollars in August.

[23:54] I do think that it's going to be tough for spooky to keep everyone in on Alice Cooper

[24:00] Nightmare Castle with games like this coming out at the same exact time and you're going

[24:04] to be able to get it quicker.

[24:05] See, that's the thing.

[24:06] It's like, if you want to get Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, how long do you have to wait?

[24:11] How long do you have to wait?

[24:12] But if you want to go get a Deadpool, Ellie or a pro, you're going to be able to get it

[24:18] like within probably a month.

[24:20] And you're not waiting a year, not waiting six months.

[24:23] You're not, your money's not locked in.

[24:24] You get a game.

[24:25] You know, that's the same thing with Jersey Jack.

[24:27] It's like, how long do you have to wait?

[24:29] Like where is Pirates production?

[24:31] I thought they were on the line.

[24:32] Like where are the first games?

[24:34] Like, why aren't they going out?

[24:36] You know, these companies are competing.

[24:38] And this is why I gave Charlie some shit earlier in my previous podcast.

[24:43] Make no mistake.

[24:45] You guys are all in a horse race to get people's money this summer.

[24:49] I mean, it is a fiercely competitive pinball landscape these days.

[24:55] And nobody is like doing this to help anyone else out.

[24:59] Like, companies are going to succeed and companies are going to fail.

[25:03] And that is just the way it is.

[25:05] You know, and when I listened to other podcasts where they just want to celebrate everything

[25:10] and they don't want to talk about the realities of what will happen in this hobby, I think

[25:15] people are missing, you know, the realities of what will happen in the hobby, which is

[25:20] you can't just cheerlead companies and they're going to succeed.

[25:24] Companies will fail.

[25:25] There is not, there are not enough new inbox pinball buyers to ensure all these companies

[25:33] survive.

[25:34] They're just not.

[25:35] And Stern is just on a freaking roll that I wouldn't want to go up against them.

[25:40] I mean, I want it.

[25:42] I mean, shit, like, imagine if Zombielli did a Godzilla game with that art and that penmanship

[25:51] sometime next year, right?

[25:53] Imagine if Zombielli did the artwork for Willy Wonka, how freaking sick it would look.

[25:58] You know, imagine, you know, I, again, I just, I just think that I'm kind of like, fuck,

[26:04] like, I don't know if we need this many pinball machines.

[26:06] I got to be honest, I just don't need, no, if we need this many games every year, I just

[26:12] don't think it's sustainable.

[26:13] I'm loving it.

[26:15] Don't get me wrong.

[26:16] I'm f in loving it, but I also would be paranoid as hell or anxious as hell.

[26:23] If I was anyone competing against a jug or not like this, I just, I just would be.

[26:27] I, I, I, I think you'd have to like up your Annie significantly to win.

[26:33] And that's the thing too is like, look how much you get for a Stern pro.

[26:38] Look, look at, look at the game.

[26:39] I mean, it's pretty much the same game.

[26:40] You lose like a diverter, you lose some figures, you can easily replace those plastic with

[26:44] those figures easily.

[26:46] And you've got pretty much like the same game.

[26:49] The diverters might change the gameplay a bit.

[26:51] And I know people have said like the Stern pricing has gone up a little bit, but not by

[26:55] much, a few hundred bucks, but look what you're getting.

[26:58] I mean, DMD games are dead now.

[27:00] I mean, I'm sorry, DMD error games.

[27:03] Who wants them?

[27:04] Who wants them?

[27:05] They look so dated.

[27:06] I don't care what anyone says.

[27:08] Like, I think all the like the Tron Elis, the, the ACDC limited editions, nobody's going

[27:13] to want that stuff.

[27:15] They're all going to lose a couple thousand dollars because of how much better these LCD

[27:20] games look and how much more they can do on the screen that just makes the experience better.

[27:26] And I think Stern's got the right size LCD and I think they understand that they're not

[27:30] trying to detract too much from the action on the play field.

[27:33] All right.

[27:34] I've stopped before it become too much of like a Stern's show, right?

[27:37] I'm not showing.

[27:38] I'm not showing.

[27:39] All right.

[27:40] Let me read an email or two and then I'll let you guys go.

[27:42] So I got an email from someone that's from Ed Owens that said, questioning the phrase

[27:49] world under glass.

[27:50] I want to read this one and then I'll let you guys go.

[27:52] Chris, I'm a casual listener.

[27:54] I enjoy the hobby updates and cutting edge news.

[27:57] I also like the way you get a podcast out quickly, commenting on new events, not being restricted

[28:03] to schedule timeline allows you that flexibility.

[28:06] I do have a few turn off about your show as well.

[28:09] For instance, can you go an entire episode without mentioning Batman 66 directly or in

[28:15] reference?

[28:16] Well, Ed, I could.

[28:17] It's the only machine I own and I don't talk about it in every episode.

[28:21] He then goes on to say, but I'm not emailing you to tear you apart.

[28:25] I'm really am interested in your claim to the phrase world under glass.

[28:29] This isn't even more fresh because Deadpool obviously is making fun of the phrase, but

[28:34] it is you or just the hobby in general.

[28:38] You lay claims of being a reporter and ask for access from companies to information to

[28:42] report on.

[28:43] But what I'm asking you is what your claim to the statement world under glass is, did you

[28:48] claim to have coined it or just use it nonstop that the hobbies should associate the

[28:53] phrase with you?

[28:54] To me, it sounds like Dr. Evil's father that invented the question mark.

[28:58] Where are you trying to get a market style interest in the phrase to make people think

[29:03] canada?

[29:05] Personally, I enjoy using the phrase, but when I hear it, I know I think canada.

[29:09] I agree it's a great way to describe modern pinball.

[29:12] All right.

[29:13] So, Ed, I did not coined the phrase world under glass, nor will I take credit for that

[29:19] phrase whatsoever.

[29:21] World under glass has been a phrase that has been used to describe pinball machines for

[29:25] many, many years.

[29:26] In fact, one of the individuals that uses that phrase that we're trying to create a world

[29:30] under glass is George Gomez.

[29:32] And I think I first heard it from him.

[29:34] I use it repeatedly on this show because I do think creating a world under glass is the

[29:39] most important thing about what makes pinball special.

[29:45] To me, it's what makes pinball different than a video game, then other forms of entertainment,

[29:51] their toys, then mobile gaming, you can actually create a physical world under that glass.

[29:57] And that's why I think games like Star Wars suck so hard because when you look down at

[30:03] Star Wars, it doesn't feel like a world under glass.

[30:06] If I were to say, what is Stern's greatest world under glass game that they've ever made,

[30:13] its Ghostbusters?

[30:14] Like, look at that pin.

[30:16] I wanted it to be so good, but it looks like the Ghostbusters world under glass.

[30:21] There's other games that accomplish that, but that's what I want.

[30:24] I want sculpts, I want toys, I want art, I want all of it to look like I'm stepping

[30:28] into that world that we all know and love.

[30:32] This is a short little 30 minute episode of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[30:36] I hope all you guys enjoy the fact that we're living in a new golden era of pinball.

[30:41] And Deadpool looks freaking sweet.

[30:43] We can't wait to Jack Danger.

[30:44] Place it next week.

[30:45] More to come on this pin as we see more of it.

[30:48] But I think you have to be loving what we're seeing so far.

[30:51] Have a good night everybody.
