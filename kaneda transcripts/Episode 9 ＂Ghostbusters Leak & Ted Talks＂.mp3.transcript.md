[00:00] Hehehehehehehehe

[00:03] Kind of got carried away there

[00:05] Uh...

[00:06] Tetsuo, you, you mean...

[00:09] You killed him?

[00:10] Huh?

[00:11] Canada sends his warmers for guards

[00:14] Canada, where is he?

[00:16] I guess he must be dead now

[00:18] Let's...

[00:19] Oh...

[00:20] Oh...

[00:21] Oh...

[00:22] Oh...

[00:23] Oh...

[00:24] Oh...

[00:25] Oh...

[00:26] Oh...

[00:31] Oh...

[00:32] Oh...

[00:33] Oh...

[00:34] There's something strange in the neighborhood tonight

[00:38] It's Canada's pinball podcast episode nine

[00:41] And this is, we're back to back right now people

[00:44] We gave our first impressions of the Hobbit pinball machine last night

[00:48] They're going to Brooklyn to play it

[00:50] Uh...

[00:51] I think I...

[00:53] Probably spoke way too long on the fact that the game played a little slow

[00:56] But I think all that's gonna be remedied with some...

[00:59] Some stronger flipper power

[01:01] We'll see how that game knits out

[01:02] We're gonna definitely play it a bunch more before giving our final review of the game

[01:06] But today I want to do two things

[01:09] Ha-ha-li-luya, I have my first guest on this show tonight

[01:13] I have SPFX Ted

[01:15] Uh...

[01:16] From Pinside, who's gonna join us later on

[01:18] Just to talk, talk a little bit about who he is and what he does, what he's into, and chat a little pinball

[01:24] Uh...

[01:25] And then we're gonna talk about the other thing

[01:26] That's just blowing up all over Pinside

[01:28] And that is the fact that the Ghostbusters secret leaked information

[01:33] That a few Pinsiders have kept to themselves has finally got out in the world

[01:38] And let's talk about that

[01:41] I don't know since worrying about it now

[01:43] Why worry?

[01:44] Each of us is worrying an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back

[01:48] It's been about two weeks since the Ghostbusters sort of threat has been blowing up with maybe even longer since people have been hyping this pen to no end

[01:59] He's saying it's gonna bring 10 times innovation and whatnot

[02:02] So today, finally, the damn broke

[02:06] And this information that a few people had seen and been bragging about, uh, got out there

[02:11] And I just wanna say, it was really, really annoying as an outsider looking in

[02:17] And I know the majority of Pinside was outsiders looking in to hear this sort of like little inner circle of people brag about having seen stuff and then not sharing it

[02:32] I just have no love for people who behave that way

[02:38] And I love how two people are like, well, I'm doing that respect for Stern employee who send it to me and whatnot

[02:45] I'm sorry guys, once the information's out there, the way it's been out there, it's no longer about protecting a Stern employee who sent it out

[02:53] Whoever that person is, I think is probably in big trouble

[02:58] After today's leak, I was like, I called up Gary Stern and I'm like, Gary, like, are you, are you trying to find the person who did this and he said this is what he told his employees

[03:10] Bring me everyone, bring me everyone

[03:15] Gary Stern is not happy people

[03:19] Some people think this is a coordinated leak by Stern, no way was Stern behind this at all

[03:29] Gary is a professional and he runs his business properly

[03:33] I think the only one he runs is Pimbal Company really properly when it comes to keeping information tight and close to the vast

[03:40] And I mentioned this on a thread, Stern reveals its Pimbal machines the right way and uses a mass media outlet like IGN to exclusively break the news of what their next Pimbal machine is going to be

[03:53] They do not want this kind of information floating around the inner webs, but it's out there

[04:01] And I have to say, you know, I really want to thank one person in particular, he was so helpful in getting us all the information

[04:09] He had to remind us multiple times how he was sent the information three times and he, you know, he's so inside that inner circle of trust

[04:20] You know, why snow? I really just have this to say when it comes to the way you treated this leak

[04:26] Give me a C, give me an H, give me an A and P, what's that spell? Everybody champ!

[04:34] I love these guys, I really do. I say that with total sarcasm when I, you know, neg them a little bit

[04:42] But I do find it funny how wise snow and rare hero, you know, these hyper vocal members of Pimbal have all put Canadian on ignore

[04:51] And they can't go a thread without reminding people to do the same. I don't think so guys, you pretend to have such thick skin

[04:59] And want to be part of the dialogue, but it really seems like you guys are cowardly running from the actual dialogue that's taking place

[05:06] And only want to talk to the people you want to talk to. So I hope you guys take me off ignore and listen to Canada and engage again

[05:15] Don't hide, there's nothing to fear here. So the information is out there and what do we see here?

[05:22] We've seen, it seems like most people have seen the zombie at the back class. I mean it looks great. It really does

[05:29] And I can't wait to see what he does with the entire game. We've seen, there's like a white wood, there's a CAD design that has a lot more

[05:39] The buildings dropped in. There's the Ellie with a slimer on it with the green apron and green legs

[05:49] And then there's the pro that has the Ecto 1 on it. I think a lot of people are saying they prefer the Ecto 1 artwork over the slimer

[05:59] I don't know yet. I have to see everything and how the final packages are delivered. What isn't clear yet is what will be the difference between the LE premium and pro

[06:14] Will all the features be in the pro or are they going to pull the game and throw it on us and remove a quintessential or major part of the game?

[06:24] Will they take a mech out for the pro? There's a little, little, little drawing of Playfield art where it says extra ball. We see this sort of cool image of two Ghostbusters with their photon blasts

[06:39] And I'll say this. I'll say this. We're going to get a completely hand drawn game of Ghostbusters. I can't wait. I can't wait.

[06:51] After hearing all that hoopla about how Fox wouldn't let any hand drawn art go into Alien. I'm not sure I even buy that story guys. We're going to see is a real artist here. Go to town.

[07:03] An artist that we know can create unbelievable artwork for pinball. So I know people are talking about the shots and it doesn't have magnetic slings and subway system in the game.

[07:18] And all this stuff all I know is I think Stern is is is upping their game big time from what I've seen in in in this leak. There is there's awesome buildings or stay puff man. There's there's a lot of just really really cool stuff going on right.

[07:41] This is this excites me to know I really feel like Stern has been mailing it in for a few years with with what they're dropping into a game. But I think they really have heard the feedback. I think the competition has really forced them to raise their game. And what I love about Stern is when they raise their game they they can do it.

[08:01] And they can really make beautiful machines. It almost feels like they're going back to making and putting the kind of fun stuff we saw in games that were 15 years ago, 10 years ago.

[08:13] But every time I look at a Simpson's pinball party I'm like I don't understand this game is so much more just stuff in it than modern Stern's well what it's like they went backwards. But I think they they've heard the feedback.

[08:26] The one thing I think is still going to be a little bit of an issue of concern is is the screen is it going to be dots if we've just he dots from movie clips I think that just could be so devastating considering how much beauty is going on at the bottom you know on the play field itself.

[08:44] So here's the thing and I know there's a lot of back and forth about the images and and I understand Robin and the pinside moderation team having to prevent people from sharing on the site itself the images.

[09:00] And I saw too that the Reddit link and the the image or link has been taken down now all these requests to take down lead me to believe that Stern is in crisis mode trying to get this information under control which leads me to believe that they did not leak this purposely they're they're really an active mode trying to control the spread of it so

[09:28] it's out there I think this reinforces for people that this game looks like it's going to be a hit this game looks damn fun especially coming out of playing the hobbit last night where there wasn't that much to shoot at I look at ghostbusters and I'm just seeing a ton of stuff to shoot at.

[09:47] And I think that's what pinball should be I think you should look down at the universe of of a game and a theme and feel like you're in that world and this looks like it's going to be like you're you're in that ghostbusters world in an incredible way.

[10:02] So let's see what happens I thought this wouldn't stuff start leaking that this would for Stern to come out with official details soon than later people were expecting February but the rumor now is that that's been pushed back to March so we'll see what happens and I think it's a great day when we get to have a little bit information I want to apologize to the pinside moderation team for telling people the PM me and I would share the goods.

[10:30] I before that I knew that that was a league I really didn't know that we weren't allowed to at least let people know like hey hit me up and I'll hook you up and I hope to you know some people and I'm glad I did and I think that when people have information they shouldn't keep it to themselves and and they should go out of their way to you know share it with the community and make everyone feel feel part of the moment instead of really making people.

[11:00] You know feel like they're on the outside but it happened alright let me end tonight's ghostbusters talk with one thing the stay puff Marshmallow man I love it love it love it I really was hoping it would be like a bash toy like ball rock that would swing out and you can hit him but he's in the upper right corner and I was wondering if that's the best place to put stay puff.

[11:20] And so I instead of speculating like we all do I call up Gary's turn I said Gary Gary I love love love what I'm seeing with ghostbusters but stay puff all the way back to the right hand corner is that where you wanted to put stay pop and and why why did you put stay puff in the upper right corner here's what he had to say about that.

[11:40] But don't you see that's what she was there for that was the plan to give you a boner and you got one congratulations you're human.

[11:48] Alright now I've been since I've starved this podcast my one of my goals has been to get guests on the show and I've tried and tried for a few weeks to get call burner to work with Skype I couldn't get it to work.

[12:01] Why finally figured out the technological hurdles of making this work and ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce tonight my first my inaugural chat with one of

[12:17] Pinsides coolest members most mellow dudes SP SPFX Ted I got to sit down with him tonight and just talk pinball and and a little bit about his background and I want to just sort of air that interview with you guys and I hope you enjoy it and I want to say this for those of you out there I'd love to have you guys on whether you're collectors whether you're just in a pinball whether you want to tell me to to F off and I just want to have a dialogue about the things we talk so passionately about on pinside.

[12:46] So just hit me up at canada pinball that's K.A. and EDA pinball at gmail.com I've already gotten a few of you guys to respond and we're going to have some interesting people on the show soon but let's turn it over to Ted and talk pinball.

[13:03] I want to welcome SPFX Ted to canada pinball podcast he is the first and the most unlucky guest of all to actually have the bravado to join this podcast so Ted welcome to the show.

[13:19] Actually this isn't Ted this is Tiki. Tiki okay.

[13:25] So Ted I know you're one of the most I would say this like one of the most chill and cool dudes on pinside which is a form with a lot of strong personalities and for those who don't know you can you give just a quick background I know you've got you're a film producer or writer or director what I know you have a really interesting sort of history so can you quickly

[13:48] tell us like just who you are.

[13:51] Well in the 70s and 80s I started a film production company called Film One Communications and we started the first feature film called The Deadly Spawn which hit the theaters in 1983 and from 1980 until about 1990 or 90.

[14:11] Now actually 1994 that's all I did was make a series of low and medium budget films you know a lot of them you know horror science fiction films like the regenerated man or Deadly Spawn.

[14:23] Metamorphosis the alien factor that I went and did a mob film called this thing of ours which we had an all star cast you know James Con, Vince a Pesto or Frank Vincent, Chargisito, Pat Cooper was a lot of fun and did a musical called Destination Fame.

[14:36] Another low budget you know horror film called Hell on Earth and and now I do you know I still do that and I also do graphics for a company as a hobby I publish a magazine called Special Effects Magazine SPF.

[14:49] And you know in the rest of the time is just you know smoke as a guards and having fun.

[14:54] Right so I actually had that you well know yeah I had the pleasure of driving out to New Jersey to the Porter House to have some cigars and some whiskey with Ted and his friends at the Porter House.

[15:05] And I got to scare you right with a little little help cat ride. Have you recovered from that experience yet?

[15:12] The hell cat was fun. One of the guys in there actually had one and in his divorce he had to give it up.

[15:18] Oh no. He was thrilled that you actually got to take him out on a ride and I had to keep saying don't go over 150 miles an hour because you know the cop we're drinking whiskey all night.

[15:30] He's taking people out in the hell cat you know going 150 miles an hour on the road so it was yeah it was a little scary. I'd pee a little I have to admit.

[15:39] Right right. Throughout your you know your movie producer you've worked on a lot of sci-fi and horror stuff and how did you get into Pimball? What year did Pimball sort of grab you?

[15:50] Yeah it was probably about maybe 20 years ago I just saw a Pimball machine for sale a friend of mine said I know this guy selling a Pimball machine and I think the first one was Pimball.

[16:03] And I ended up getting that and yeah again Pimball is not my you know my main hobby there's a lot of other things I collect besides that.

[16:11] The most Pimball machines I've ever had at one time was probably six and at one point when the price is one crazy I mean I got them very cheap.

[16:20] I mean the first time I bought scared stiff which is my favorite game of all time. I think I paid like $2,500 for it or something.

[16:28] So what did it go for now? It scared stiff and good condition.

[16:31] The last one I think I saw for I think it was in the sevens or something. Wow.

[16:36] I just couldn't turn down the money and there's a lot of new stuff coming out. I mean look at what's going on out there now.

[16:42] Right. This aliens and ghost busters and I mean it's just tons of cool stuff coming out.

[16:46] Right and I want to ask you about some of these new titles coming out in a little bit and get your opinion on them.

[16:51] When you got into Pimball did you get into it as a collector? So did the first thing you got the Pimball did you buy that back 20 years ago?

[17:00] Yeah I just had a game room and in the game room I wanted everything. I had the Arkanoid video thing.

[17:06] I was like the master of Arkanoid. We used to go down to the Jersey Shore and people would watch me go through all the levels to see the little thing at the end where you bounce the bricks on them.

[17:17] So I mean that was really cool. So I had one of those in the game room. I wanted a pinball machine. I wanted just a few different machines in the house.

[17:26] I wanted one of those swami things that tells you fortune and all that kind of crazy stuff.

[17:31] And then after a while you know I just ended up selling it and getting other stuff. And then I forgot about pinball for a while.

[17:37] And it goes back in the early days used to play it down in Wallawood down the shore. That was the big thing.

[17:42] I mean people used to line up for hours on the boardwalk waiting to play a pinball game. I mean like when Xenon came out or I remember the first time when Superman or it was that big, it was that huge game.

[17:54] Hercules. Hercules. I mean I think he was like hold he's just looking at this thing.

[18:00] Right. Right. And it was a terrible game. But it just everyone to play.

[18:04] I feel like hercules is still one of the best earners on location after all these years simply because of the novelty of the whole thing.

[18:11] Oh they still exist. Oh yeah. There was one at Expo this year and there's one actually I was just up in near Boston at a boardwalk and there was just one sitting there.

[18:21] And it it's like you have to play it just because of the curiosity around the size of the thing. But you're right it's an absolutely terrible game.

[18:28] And when actually just sold on eBay this week for I think like $3,000 or something like that.

[18:35] Wow. But I'd hate to have to move that thing.

[18:37] Yeah. Well there are key games that we're down the shore. I mean like when Gorgar came out, you know, this game that talked when Xenon came out.

[18:44] I mean everyone was like oh my god. Right. Play that. Right. And you played over and over again. Right.

[18:49] I mean those times were fantastic. Every time you get down the shore they'd be a new game. You know coming in because they just I guess they made some.

[18:56] Well what I miss about that error just from from growing up in the 80s and the 90s in the arcade was was the element of surprise that you never you would go back all the time to and there be a new game there.

[19:07] That game became popular like you said people lined up but there wasn't the internet right people weren't speculating there was no leaks and there's no idea what the game might be right.

[19:17] Just show up there and then this would be the new game. Right never know what it was the only way you know.

[19:22] There's somebody would be down there and they call right. Oh my god. You gotta get down here. Right. Right. That would be it. That's the only way you know there was no internet.

[19:28] There was none of this kind of stuff. And there wasn't any conversation about how the lack of code in the game.

[19:34] You never heard that back then ever. We didn't know what code was right. I had no idea what code was probably until a few years ago.

[19:43] There was a simpler time. I just put the money in your plate. Right. So you right now you're you're called you don't have any pinball machines right now right.

[19:50] You're right. I had I had the last few pinball. He's a guy came down to buy I think it was my Jurassic Park or something.

[19:56] And he said, oh, how much is the electronomo how much is the TT how much is the and I should celebrate those I said they're not for sale. He goes, what can I make you know for I said sure I can he goes I have my truck here.

[20:07] He maybe know for on the machines except I kept two machines which was about three times what I paid for that was ridiculous. I couldn't turn down the money. Right.

[20:16] So I just got rid of him and the last one was scared stiff when I was offered thousands more than I paid. So I said, you know what let me just sell all these machines now because all these new ones are coming out and I'm looking into either an alien or ghost busters or I mean there's a lot of cool stuff that's going to be coming out of the next year or two.

[20:33] So yeah, I wanted to talk to you. So right now you've got sort of like space for some pins and what what are you looking forward to most I know we were talking a little bit about alien and how excited you are by that theme.

[20:45] If knowing what's on the horizon with aliens ghost busters, Lebowski, you know there's Jurassic World's rumor to be coming out star wars. What what what one has you most excited right now.

[20:58] Probably aliens ghost busters star wars that kind of thing. I don't have much interest in Lebowski. I mean again I thought it was a good film. I didn't think it was a phenomenal film. It was okay.

[21:13] But the theme really isn't what I really collect. I'm really looking for the science fiction.

[21:18] Ty Sheens or the things you know or horror. I mean ghost busters would be a perfect type machine to get aliens you know would be good.

[21:25] But you know again I'm not into this pre thing you know like everybody else I almost I was very lucky I almost got burned on the on the predator thing and it scared a lot of people.

[21:36] So you know what there's no machine out there that I have to have that I can't wait to see you know what it's like before buying it and if I have to spend an extra thousand dollars to get it after it comes out I'll do that.

[21:46] Right right. So I'd rather just see it first and see you know see what it's like.

[21:50] Right it's much nicer to see the money in your own checking account or your own savings account than being locked into the pre orders because that model sort of really sort of taken off in the last few years where people are just locking up you know thousands of dollars

[22:05] and waiting years for this stuff without even knowing if the game's good last night I went to play the hobbit for a few hours and it is it is a beautiful game but it is a game that you would want to spend a bunch of time on I think before making up your mind to buy it.

[22:20] So it is interesting that people are going all in on stuff without ever even having plunged a single game.

[22:26] So I think you're doing the smart thing Ted of waiting because I think I've recommended this for a lot of people who are rushing to buy stuff right now is now is not the time especially not to buy even like older games I think the next six months are going to release some incredible

[22:41] innovative pins so it's a good time to just sort of wait sit on your money and see what comes out.

[22:45] Absolutely there's going to be a lot of people selling there you know not the first you know the first tier of machines I like but after that they're going to be dropping them because they're going to want all these new machines I mean there's a lot of real

[22:55] real cool stuff come out but you know again you know pinball is not my main hobby so that's another reason I can wait a lot of the guys on

[23:02] pin side this is like their main hobby they had a fake I know you know New Jersey gecko taught me how to change a light bulb I didn't have

[23:09] a change of hope right the game I'm pulling the thing out of this no no those are those I said I'm twisting those aren't the ones you turn you know so I had no idea how to do this but

[23:16] but there's these guys on pin side this is their main hobby so when this kind of thing comes out they want to be the first one to get it

[23:22] they want to have it in their house first that's a big deal to them it's not such a big deal to me it's like I want to get it play it and then I want to buy it

[23:30] so when one game I want to talk about and I know that it's been blowing up today on the forum is Ghostbusters and for the last couple

[23:39] of weeks that we've been hearing a lot of speculation and rumors about the pin itself and it was clear that certain people

[23:47] had seen some information and visuals and images of the game itself and it looks like that information was leaked from from

[23:56] stern to some individuals and today the the the gasket or the dam just blew open I mean it everyone seems to now be have

[24:06] access to those images and someone actually posted those images on reddit have you been able to take a look and see what's what is sort of

[24:14] the the leaked information and do you have any thoughts on on what you saw and yeah I saw them in two groups I saw the pictures a while ago

[24:24] when when they first came out someone had sent them to me and I and I look at them and there was a second badge that was sent to me that had had even

[24:30] more you know that play field and everything that was like semi-populated right I mean it's you know I said I it's a big drama

[24:38] there I really couldn't care less it's like oh did stern leak it did an employee leak it out of this guy who cares

[24:46] when machine is revealed it's going to be revealed when they show us the video we'll see the video right I mean when it's done

[24:52] it's done you know it's like the big thing like the habit I mean it's just a hundred pages of bullshit I mean it's done and it's

[24:59] working correctly it'll come out and that's why anybody want it rushed or want it before it's ready I have no clue I mean I

[25:07] understand they have the money into it whatever but that's the nature of it they know they know this they know they do it going into it

[25:13] so if you're not willing to plunk down that money and wait one two or three years or whatever then don't do it

[25:18] wait till it comes out pay the extra money and buy the machine but and hey it comes out it comes out right and I think there's like and we

[25:24] were talking about this earlier with the arcades I think people almost spoil it for themselves when they it's you know a phrase

[25:31] we've heard used a bunch of times when we heard this on the alien thread is you know watching the sausage being made and here's the

[25:38] process of making a pinball machine and here here's the machine you know even like I'm looking at the ghost busters images right now

[25:44] and even seeing it without any of the zombie Eddie artwork on it isn't really doing anyone any favors right I mean you can

[25:52] speculate on the shots you get a sense of the layout but I think seeing this stuff early ultimately leads people to

[25:59] thinking about it too much speculating too much and then when it actually does come out there's almost like this

[26:06] anti-climatic disappointment that sweeps over people because I think everyone has the perfect pin in their head but

[26:12] you know I think to your point it would be great if everyone would just wait until stuff was revealed and then

[26:19] made up their mind and even better like went to play a pin before dropping everybody has an opinion on the thing and

[26:27] you know what they say opinions like assholes it's like everybody you know if you can't if you put 10 people in a room and

[26:33] said what should we have on ghost busters you get 10 10 different opinions you're never going to make everybody happy

[26:38] someone's looking at the back glass saying it's crap but they don't like it someone else say this they don't like someone

[26:43] say this is the greatest thing ever saw someone say it's terrible so you're never going to get everybody to agree you know I

[26:49] would like to I mean personally if you could just find people it would be constructive and not just you know a bunch of

[26:56] whack jobs to show people stuff and get opinions like what happened with with Jersey Jack with with the Hobbit there was some

[27:02] opinions you know brought out and they made some changes now if it can be used like that constructive it's great

[27:08] but not when you get these people and then they're not there for any reason other than to just stir the pot and just be

[27:15] you know right right right well yeah nothing it right it's and most of the people that normally are the most

[27:21] vocal to are not even in on the game and that's I mean that's just the reality of forms are right is that you

[27:28] you don't have to be a buyer for these expensive pins anymore just to come in and give your opinion because opinions

[27:34] are free right and that's what they're saying I mean these guys don't nuts when you're saying hey you have no

[27:39] skill in the game you're not getting the game you don't ever intend to get the game why are you here bashing this or

[27:44] and you know I get it to the pinion and it's an opinion thread I understand that right but you know what if they

[27:51] were doing let's say a arosmith pinball and I have absolutely zero interest in getting that game if I had zero

[27:59] interest in how it played and I know I'm never going to be a buyer of it I wouldn't go into the arosmith thread

[28:05] and start posting all the stuff about how I feel about this or that or whatever because I really have absolutely no

[28:10] interest in the game so right people get involved in something they have no they're never going to get I don't know

[28:15] right and I saw to in the in the discussion around the next music pin I think it's Hendrix iron made in an

[28:22] arosmith and then someone started talking about the artwork for the new pan and it might be the Metallica artist and then

[28:27] someone chimed in and just like I hate Metallica their music sucks and that's all it takes right is like then that sets

[28:32] off everyone who likes Metallica to go nuts so I want to what if you hate Metallica go to the other thread

[28:39] yeah it's like why bother Ted so what is we'll go back to pinball and say but what is your number one like collector

[28:47] your collection right now the thing that you're most passionate about is what well I mean I collect movie posters

[28:55] you know from the 50s you know for you know for the planet you know worth a world of years did still

[29:00] which I am talking to some people now about you know maybe a machine along those lines and also

[29:08] someone about the the Ray Harryhausen pinball which we'll find out more about this later on mid year maybe

[29:15] so a machine I mean a machine inspired by one of those films or a machine using the artwork or what's

[29:21] inspired by the films would be like maybe I'm maybe a seven voyage or something like that I mean because

[29:25] there's you know there's a lot of people out there I mean these these stop motion

[29:30] people Ray Harryhausen fans there's a lot of very wealthy people I mean practically everybody at ILM

[29:36] wouldn't buy a machine so you probably have hundreds of people right there that would definitely get this right so a machine like that would

[29:42] would definitely be something that would be given just for the for the listeners of of Canadian's

[29:47] podcast all hundred and ten of us give a range of prices because some of these movie

[29:54] posters right we talk about pinball pricing all the time and people are shocked by what machines are you know

[29:59] the prices and how high they're getting personally I look at them start collecting movie posters right I mean what I

[30:06] think the mummy solve for like 450,000 and that's like a half sheet there's been you know posters the war

[30:13] the world's a half sheet poster goes for you know 50 you know 60 grand right so there are posters out there

[30:19] that are expensive I mean even some of the you know the regular ones seven or eight you know grand for

[30:24] posters don't be deal forbidden plan you can't get fear under 10 grand so it's you know that that's pretty expensive

[30:30] I also like to collect the original artwork I commission artists to do you know to do paintings you know like it did for our

[30:36] cigar club I have the creature of the black lagoon you know smoky a cigar and you know so I mean I collect watches I mean

[30:42] there's a number of different things I collect besides you know range pinball what do you think of pinball art

[30:48] yeah are you you know there it seems to be that the the crit a lot of the criticism or the critique of machines

[30:55] I do think that pinball machines are in itself a work of art they are a piece of furniture in your house and

[31:01] especially for a guy like me who's just got one in his living room it is it is the focal point of my living room

[31:07] and the artwork and and what goes on the cabinet and the play field are you you know are you are you excited

[31:15] by what you're seeing to be like a new sort of step forward and pinball art with some of the new machines that have been revealed

[31:21] yeah you know I have a I don't know pinball art I wish there was a way that easily changed the art I'd like to have the

[31:31] side panels be some kind of way that you would just have the art you would slip it into a sleeve or attach it to the

[31:38] side I have different you know translates or back glasses you know to be able to swap this stuff out and be able to change it to

[31:45] different things I sort of like that but no one seems to agree with me and I'm right and highway is trying to do

[31:50] something like that but I have to say I wish it was the whole side of the cabinet that you could change

[31:57] out so it was flush with the like the overall the like fill the whole space I know with their their system

[32:04] you're going to be able to swap out the there's like a smaller art panel on the sides you can switch the game as well

[32:10] but it's see what they tell me is this don't they tell me it doesn't make a difference you go sandwich these these games three four 10 20

[32:17] in a row so you're never really going to see that right right you know that you really see as the back and I get that I

[32:22] understand that but for there's some people only have one of two machines you know that art maybe maybe

[32:27] important right well it's it's it's interesting because spooky looks like they really you know they're going all in on on the

[32:33] artwork for Rob Zombie what are your thoughts on the Rob Zombie game I mean I know and we didn't talk about this

[32:38] ship I know you're a big fan of or you've been heavily involved with Chiller Theater and I've been the

[32:43] Chiller Theater a few times for those of you who haven't been the Chiller

[32:47] Ted what what's it just a quick like 10 second explanation of what Chiller Theater is just a it's a three day party

[32:55] and there's people there from movie stars television stars rock from people from rock bands and people are there from the

[33:04] the doors people there from pretty much every band you could possibly imagine there's playboy bunnies there's

[33:10] everything artists writers it's really a conglomeration of just thousands it's usually a hunt between a hundred and 150 guests it's just a

[33:19] two shows once in April once in October and then at night we go out there and from like nine o'clock at night until three four five in the

[33:26] morning we're sitting outside you know drinking the smoking cigars just bullshit and about you know films and stuff so you

[33:32] know anybody wants to come down you know let me know it's at the precipitate uh Sheraton the one looks like a big castle and it's it's just a it's

[33:40] just a great show right and that's in precipitating you Jersey Wednesday April show because that one's coming up soon

[33:45] what's right now I think there's they they have like two or three reunion so far I mean there's only probably

[33:51] 40 50 guests it's only not even half have done yet okay because I think it's at the end of April I think it's like the 21st

[33:57] 20 seconds something like that okay good yeah I was just hoping it didn't overlap with my guns and roses concert in Vegas April

[34:03] eighth and ninth I haven't forbidden yeah that's it but Rob Zombie what are your thoughts on that game it seems like a

[34:09] theme that like you know guy who's in into sort of harm sure you know what it's a it's a great thing I just support

[34:16] spooky I mean Rob Zombie game is is I don't know if it's a game I'll keep or whatever I'll probably just end up you know having

[34:25] someone that likes a theme more than me but I support spooky and I missed out on the Americans most haunted

[34:31] because I just wasn't I made a mistake I wasn't really crazy about the artwork on that on that game and I just never

[34:38] got chance to play it and then I got chance to play it and then it's really fantastic game I really really love the game

[34:44] well you can't that time it was too late to get in but I really want to support you know pretty much anything that's

[34:49] what he does well you can go get a new in box one for for $10,000 one just appeared on a I'd rather have a forbidden

[34:56] plan of poster right right I was going to ask you you know with and I know that you know you're

[35:03] saving up for for for a new game that comes out sometime in 2016 but what would be the most amount of

[35:09] money you would ever spend on a on a pinball machine and this is just personally you I know that you

[35:14] would much rather spend that money maybe on something else but what's your like max dollar that you know how

[35:20] much pinball machines cost at one time because you know again I was just I didn't know much about big bang bar

[35:26] which everyone think that's a great thing for me and it would be and we went over to a friend's house

[35:31] because you know during the summer we usually sometimes we get five to to twelve pin fighters together and we

[35:36] have these parties you know which are which are great and by the way nobody mouths off like they do on the

[35:41] internet when we're all together everybody argues they can disagree but everyone is respectful and there's no

[35:47] no there's kind of crazy shit going on because someone would get a beating so so it's always a very great

[35:51] and also we go down to Allentown all these guys are down there and they're like the nicest guys in the

[35:56] world that we have a great great time versus a lot of drinking about but anyway so we went to this

[36:01] one guy's house one time and he had a big bang bar and I'm playing this thing and I never played it

[36:04] before and I thought it was it was phenomenal so I went up to him and I said you know I know this is

[36:09] kind of crazy but if you ever think of selling this game I would give you like 10 grand for it right there's like this

[36:14] like awkward silence last you know what they mean if you went

[36:17] 10 I've actually turned down 20,000 I go 20,000

[36:22] so I mean my limit would probably be like a 10th I mean let's put it in I know they're working on

[36:30] forbidden planet if that forbidden planet game came out that site unseen I don't get how it played I

[36:36] would put down some pretty money on that right because everybody has their no matter what they say

[36:40] everybody has their game that you know of course is no object I want that game right

[36:45] yeah my my game is a Jean-Claude Mondes line heart movie if they make that I'm all in I don't care 100 grand

[36:52] I don't think I have anything to worry about your money is safe right right well I think it's a good point

[36:57] because you know it's it's interesting you bring a big bang bar to and and that game

[37:03] the story the backstory on it and I kind of vaguely remember they offered it up right and people didn't think it was going to get

[37:10] made and I think it was only like five thousand dollars and they were going to make a couple hundred of them

[37:15] and they took years and it finally came out but those games came out right when like it was only

[37:21] stern really making games right and people there wasn't J.J.P there wasn't anyone else in the game

[37:26] and I think I just saw a big bang bar sell for 15,000 so my theory is with all these new games coming

[37:34] out in the next six months remakes to like everything is going to go down that's used for why it's going to be like

[37:42] you know it reminds me and I'm going to use a car you may even know people hate it but when when Ford came back out with the Shelby

[37:48] I think it was I want to say 2000 and like six people were paying 20,000 over they thought it was going to be a collectible

[37:56] and be worth with the old Shelby's were worth but they just kept making Shelby's better and better since then

[38:01] and I think that's what's going to happen at Pimball if it stays as popular as it does now and then there's and I think

[38:08] from what I've seen at Expo and I think I've seen it other shows there's enough rich dudes and I to support the volume

[38:16] of Pimball machines because to your point and I'm not going to name names but someone in my personal life is just going to get one car

[38:24] that's going to cost 220,000 dollars one car and if that guy was in the Pimball which there's thousands of collectors

[38:32] well that's enough to buy 15 Pimball machines for the premium price.

[38:36] Yeah, I'm going to buy these people buying paintings for a hundred million dollars so I mean everybody you know there's a lot of collectors out there

[38:42] granted you know a lot of the collectors they have they have some money I mean I'm looking so these guys collections

[38:47] they've got well into a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of you know Pimball machines there

[38:51] and it's like you know but that's their thing that's their you know that's their big thing so you know I think it's

[38:58] it's just it's fun if you have the money to do it like I said for me it's not the you know the biggest thing

[39:04] but I think it's I think it's a lot of fun I can't wait to have another you know Runeful Pimball machines again.

[39:10] Right well I may take you up to because I have no more room so if I get a couple more machines

[39:16] take am I allowed to store some at your place is that sure is it okay sure I'm looking I want to be charging

[39:23] well what I didn't tell you is I'm going to have the the dollar mechanism hooked up to it so you're going to have to pay to play them when they're there so

[39:30] oh sorry so I think anything else Ted what would I would I'd love to do and and I'll just I'll edit this out this is just a unit talking now

[39:42] but are you cool tell like coming on the show like every few weeks to just talk about like some of the latest stuff that's been popping on the

[39:48] form or yes and no yes because you know it's a lot of fun and I like talking about but I don't think people are really going to

[39:57] care as much what I think because I'm not that big a collector like like some of these guys are like I said I just

[40:03] learned to change a light bulb so I mean what my opinion is may not be as valuable as some of these guys that you know

[40:09] they can tear it entire machine now I would get Greg on here you know and say get go you know he's like that's from me this guy has ripped

[40:18] down a time machines and put them back together again he said dozens of machines he has his partner now they have their

[40:23] store and everything and this would be a guy that would be perfect great I would love you have you could connect us I think I

[40:29] I think I was talking to my while back when I was looking to buy I think he was selling like a tron or new in

[40:35] trying to leave one point or something like that but if you could connect us to be awesome I'd love to have him on

[40:40] to you and talk about you know from a collector's point of view a guy who's got a lot of stuff in his

[40:45] yeah he knows all about the stuff he's in the business he knows how to you know work on the machines so his opinion

[40:51] about the stuff would be you know probably different you know from mine where you know for me I do you know I'd like a

[40:56] machine that looks great even even before the play but still hate scared stiff I can't wait to get another one of those

[41:03] back again because I actually missed the game you know that you might just think is is perfect in every aspect it's just a fun

[41:10] game so okay so let's go back to like I'm gonna just record a couple more things then I'll let you go have dinner

[41:16] said so you're so you're just saying if there was one game you could have if there was one game you could have

[41:21] back which which which pin would that be that you just kind of regret letting go a lot of be scared stiff without a doubt I

[41:27] mean I'd love to get attacked from Mars if they do a remake on that I mean it seems like these you know the

[41:33] remakes are holding up pretty good the medieval madness seems to be the people that have them you know they

[41:38] seem to be they seem to be good me having a machine like that now it all new stuff in it you know brand new you

[41:43] know but again what you pay for it I mean I'm in at 65 7000 but I'm certainly wouldn't pay eight or

[41:50] nine thousand dollars for a for a attack from Mars but right now I would just love to get a good scared

[41:57] stiff back again just to you know to be able to play it that's the one game I regret selling it I probably should

[42:03] was over right right I think we I think everyone has and you know sellers remorse no matter whenever you collect

[42:09] anything right I was I collect transformer toys the original ones and I still regret selling a couple

[42:16] and there's because there's always those hard to find ones that you just feel like oh great I'm going to have to

[42:19] spend the next 20 years my life trying to get it back or just pay a fortune to to require it well Ted I want

[42:26] to thank you for for taking some time out to talk to us about the the pinball community and and and what's

[42:34] going on on Pinside and I do thank you to for being one of the the most mellow and chill guys on the

[42:41] forum I love your approach and I think it settles down a lot of the drama there and you're you're

[42:48] take on things is much appreciated yeah I just don't take it too seriously except when people get kind

[42:54] of crazy I mean you know I would love to see you know and I love the site but you know I had you

[42:59] know friends of mine that are you know guys that have 20 30 machines their collection they have big

[43:04] you know big houses up so I sent them to the site they said they went on there for 10 minutes I said

[43:08] listen to these guys they they they said they would never go back so it's like you know if they got

[43:13] rid of just a bunch of the people are obviously on there for no other reason than just to just start

[43:18] trouble or whatever and you know who they are I mean it's the same people there's only the same

[43:23] ex-anon of people they're pretty much posting every every thread so I mean and so many more people

[43:29] would come on there I mean at the one point I had this problem there I got tons of emails you

[43:34] know to my regular account explaining saying I'd love to go on pizza I'd love to say something I'm just

[43:39] afraid these people you get so nasty and I'm afraid to open my you know they're afraid to open their mouth

[43:43] right right pretty much what it is so I'd like to see that open up and people not the same

[43:48] 20 people but but other people that are just in the background is there's how many hundreds or

[43:53] thousands of people on the inside I would love some of these people to come up and really get you're

[43:58] involved in in in in Pinside because it's it's it's a lot of fun there's there's some people

[44:04] on there that are really really funny people I mean I literally they say you know spit out your

[44:09] coffee they have literally been times what I'm seeing at my desk with a donut and coffee and I'm

[44:14] reading to this and I actually do spray right right there is some funny people on Pinside we

[44:20] won't mention it right and I think those are some great words were up advice and yeah I the site is

[44:25] has got a lot of great personalities and I do wish to that the personal attacks is a thing that

[44:30] just always gets to me it's even you know we can have fun and we can banter and we can call

[44:34] each other names around like you know what our machine what what our favorite machines are and

[44:39] and discussing pinball and all that's fun in games but sometimes it just gets you know people

[44:43] are really taking personal shots like today someone sent me a private message to go drink some bleach

[44:49] and I was and I said I'll I'll let you apologize before let the mod team here about this and they

[44:58] responded to go fuck myself so there's those pleasantries always always make it feel like a home but you

[45:07] know I understand why I get a lot of that victory all but you're gonna you're gonna get a

[45:10] percentage no matter what hey look you're you're no angel without a doubt but but why you're always

[45:17] gonna get a percentage if you throw a thousand people on you're always gonna get that two or

[45:21] three percent that are gonna be you know they're gonna be you know whack jobs and that's just the nature

[45:26] that's pretty much you know anywhere you know so you know again I'd like to see some

[45:31] different you know voices you know on pinsoid but you know it's it's hey it's it's I probably the
