[00:00] Just remember when a dream appears, you belong to me.

[01:30] So keep a lookout for that, it's going to happen sometime this week and it's going to be a lot of fun.

[01:35] Alright, so what is going on in pinball right now? I'm noticing something. There are just not as many

[01:41] games for sale as there used to be and I think that is indicative of the end of the year. It's

[01:49] the holidays, a lot of people are buying stuff for themselves. The art of like giving a gift to

[01:55] yourself is real and I think a lot of people have been buying pinball machines at the end of the

[02:02] year. It is a time of year in which we think about purchasing things and so you know when I look at

[02:08] games for sale it might shock some of you to see some of the titles that have been easy to get for

[02:15] a long time are no longer readily available. Now the two hottest new games were obviously Winchester's

[02:23] Mystery House. Can't find a single one of those things for sale anywhere. I am still so shocked.

[02:30] I'm looking at you Derek Musket. I'm still shocked that none of my friends are just testing the waters

[02:37] on that game. Listed for 8000. See if someone bites. I mean some of these big whales. I was reading a

[02:43] story about a guy that just got a dune. He lives in New York City. He's been in the hobby for

[02:49] three years and has like 30 pinball machines that he keeps in like an art studio in New York City.

[02:57] A guy like that who might not have a Winchester. What's $8000 to a man whose rent or like mortgage

[03:05] might be like 15,000 a month. You know what I'm saying people. They got the cheddar. They got the

[03:10] cheddar but nobody. Nobody and that is really really amazing to me. Good job barrels of fun.

[03:18] I mean you found a unique theme that nobody knew about. You sold out in two days and nobody is

[03:26] willing to give up their spot. I think that is hugely indicative of how the collectors in this

[03:33] hobby just want something unique. Want something different. We're going to talk about dune and

[03:38] how you've just got like two more days. The order one or you might not be able to get it again.

[03:44] Is it a sleeper hit. Will dune go the same way that pirates of the Caribbean went all those years

[03:50] ago. Remember they couldn't sell pirates for like an entire year. I think it's radically different

[03:57] times in the hobby and I think they are radically different games. We're going to talk about

[04:02] what some of the similarities are but also really what the differences are between pirates

[04:08] and this game and whether or not we think in the future we're going to see dune machines selling

[04:13] for a lot more than MSRP. So it is really really interesting to me when I was in the

[04:20] John Wick thread because the John Wick code is getting closer to 1.0. I think Stern pinball

[04:26] has said they would like to get D&D uncanny X-Men and John Wick code to 1.0 sometime in January.

[04:35] I think you know those three titles especially I think they just want to move beyond them. I think

[04:40] they want to be done with them. They need to allocate those software teams to new games and

[04:46] that's like the blessing in the curse of Stern because they have so many games coming out every

[04:51] year. You know even though you're excited about where the code is going to go there's going to

[04:56] come a time where the sales of these games will not justify them continuing to put resources

[05:03] towards each of these games and they will have to move on to the next games especially with X-Men

[05:09] and John Wick. Those games didn't sell very well at all. D&D sold better and Dwight is definitely

[05:16] committed to D&D but there's still three titles now that are yesterday's news. There's not a lot of

[05:22] demand for any of these games new in box and if Stern were to run these games again I don't think

[05:27] they're ever going to run either of those games again or all three of them will not have another

[05:32] run. I think this is it. I think they've made all the money they're going to make on them

[05:36] and that is why you might not get more code updates in the future but what was surprising

[05:42] when I was in the John Wick thread a few things. So John Wick has been this game that some of my

[05:46] fans Chris L I'm looking at you they love it like they swear by it like they think John Wick is a

[05:53] sleeper hit. They think John Wick was unfairly criticized because of the gun gate issue. They

[06:00] think the game came out and the code wasn't there and so a lot of people just dismissed it and now

[06:06] people are playing this game and I will say the John Wick owners are having a lot of fun. It does

[06:11] seem like the only version of the game you need to have to have all the fun because it's faster

[06:17] and you still get all the excitement of the code is the pro version of the game. So I think those

[06:22] John Wick pro owners are absolutely having a ball for people who bought the LE new in box for $13,000.

[06:29] I mean you basically lost about $5,000 in value so you know but here's the thing if I were to ask

[06:35] you right now how many John Wick LEs are there for sale as of today on Pinside do you know what the

[06:43] answer is zero. There's none. There's none to be had anywhere. There's no distros listing them for

[06:50] sale. There's no games up there new in box. There's nothing. They've all been gobbled up and a lot of

[06:57] them got gobbled up at really good prices. I think a lot of people bought LEs for less than $10,000.

[07:04] Some people bought them for like $8,500 but there are zero for sale. If I were to ask you how many

[07:11] uncanny X-Men LEs are there for sale right now on Pinside for obviously a discounted price

[07:18] there's nine of them. Okay well you know look nine's not a lot when you think they made what

[07:23] 866 of those X-Men's Jaws LE. They made a thousand Jaws LEs right. How many Jaws LEs are for sale

[07:30] right now? There used to be a point where there were zero. Now there are seven. Now again not a lot

[07:36] in the scheme of things but still easy to get. There are seven people out there that want to sell

[07:42] the game and the fact that they're still available for sale means that the tens of thousands of people

[07:48] on Pinside there are not seven people that want one of those games right now. So right now the

[07:54] supply outweighs the demand for the game. A lot of demand for Winchester zero for sale. Now with zero

[08:02] John Wick's for sale are there any wanted ads for John Wick and yes there are. So I think this game

[08:09] is having a little bit of a second life and I think a lot of us who are pinball curious may be

[08:16] thinking that this is a game that maybe I passed up and I should get some time on it. I think there

[08:24] are a lot of games like that. They have terrible launches and because the launches are not great

[08:31] the hype and the enthusiasm for the game sort of is dead on arrival. John Wick was one of those games.

[08:39] X-Men was kind of one of those games. The X-Men code was atrocious at the launch and once we

[08:47] tasted that atrocious code people did not want to go back. They did not want the game and so yeah

[08:54] X-Men was another game that had a terrible terrible launch. It was rushed out. It had both code issues

[09:01] and physical mechanical issues and because of that it never recovered. We are now in a point

[09:08] where it's really hard for a game to recover because we've got 13 pinball companies making games

[09:14] and why do I want to go over here and buy something new that's got issues or is incomplete.

[09:19] I'd rather buy a short thing. I'd rather buy something I know I want and I know is great.

[09:25] Dune was another game. It came out and had a terrible launch. It tried to sort of sneak out and be

[09:33] there and be present when Harry Potter was coming out and King Kong. So they launched the game too

[09:39] early. The code was really incomplete and they didn't have really manufacturing going. So you've

[09:46] got like this triple whammy where well maybe even like four whammies. It wasn't a theme. People really

[09:52] want it. The code was incomplete and there were two other games that had more excitement than it

[09:59] and then your manufacturing wasn't really on and you couldn't get the game in front of people.

[10:04] So you've got four things working against it and by the time you reveal the game you really

[10:10] didn't reveal the right game. You revealed an early version of something that would become much better.

[10:17] You only get one chance to make a first impression. So we've had a lot of pinball machines that have

[10:22] launched this way and it does beg the question. Can a game really have a second life when there's

[10:29] so much happening in pinball by so many other companies that are also launching in a much

[10:34] better way like Harry Potter launched in a much better way. King Kong maybe you know you could

[10:41] argue there was nothing wrong with the Kong launch. I just think the game itself was underwhelming

[10:47] and the art turned people off and the lack of assets really did turn people off. When we look at

[10:52] a game like Beetlejuice phenomenal launch. I mean the game was like sold out before they even did

[10:58] the launch. They didn't even need to do a launch video but they did. We got a great launch video.

[11:04] The way the orders happened. It was like really fun to be part of the Beetlejuice reveal and those

[11:10] of you who got a spot you know what I'm talking about. Those of you who didn't you might still be

[11:15] angry but look they did a great launch and now the Beetlejuice games are going to be on the

[11:21] line in January and people are going to start getting their games. So when you look at a game

[11:26] like Dune though. Do I think Dune is going to have like a second life. So the numbers right now are

[11:34] they've sold around five hundred and sixty of the title and you know there's two more days where the

[11:41] order banks are open and the number that they're floating around is they're going to make somewhere

[11:47] around six hundred of these games. So give or take maybe 10 or 20 units. So imagine if Dune

[11:54] after all of the IP assets they got after all of the theme integration they've got all the actors

[12:01] they've got the orchestra they've got that sandworm mech that's pretty amazing and they've got like

[12:06] the screen under the glass like it is a really beautiful pin and yet it's been overlooked for

[12:13] some reason. Now imagine they only make six hundred of these games forever and in total

[12:21] all of a sudden now it starts to feel like wow there is some FOMO now if they commit to that. Now

[12:27] they still have not committed that this is it. They said this is likely it but they have not

[12:34] committed that this is it and never anymore. I think the number they said they were going to make

[12:38] was around a thousand. They're not going to get anywhere near that. So is this going to be a pirate

[12:45] to the Caribbean situation like a year from now getting a Dune is going to be impossible and anyone

[12:52] who has one new in a box is going to be getting like twenty to thirty thousand dollars for the game.

[12:57] It's quite easy for me to say no that's not going to happen and I think people forget the reason why

[13:05] pirates sort of had this crazy journey and it's so much different than Dune. When pirates launched

[13:12] you got to remember this when pirates launched and revealed itself to the world everybody loved it

[13:19] everybody wanted one the triple spinning discs the treasure chest that open and closed everybody

[13:26] thought the game was like the next greatest thing everyone had one on order I did most people did

[13:31] and then what happened they didn't make the game for eight months they took out the triple spinning

[13:38] disc and the treasure chest mech they stream the game for eight months to the point where nobody

[13:45] wanted one anymore and then by the time it came out everybody was over it and for those people

[13:51] who played it you know it's a mixed bag gameplay experience you got to select from twenty two

[13:57] characters it's this wide body game it's not for everybody and when you play that game on location

[14:04] it was often broken and it didn't play right it was a game that was very problematic for a lot of

[14:10] people at the beginning with problem solving and issues and it also didn't have any of the real

[14:16] assets from the pirates of the Caribbean movie and so people passed on it and then Jersey Jack did

[14:22] the unthinkable they said we're never making any more ever again and once they said that then yeah

[14:28] the demand went through the roof but there was initial demand and this is the thing that's

[14:33] different from Dune there was initial incredible demand for the game when Dune came out there wasn't

[14:42] any of that and because that never existed there's no way to really manufacture that now even if the

[14:50] game is good I would argue that Dune is probably as good of a game as Pire to the Caribbean I think

[14:59] Pire to the Caribbean I gotta be honest I do think it is one of the most overrated pinball

[15:05] machines based on what people think it's worth I think it's only worth that because of the rarity

[15:12] I love the Pire to the Caribbean movies the Jack Sparrow all the humor from Johnny Depp none of

[15:19] that is in the game and I get that it's sort of like a game inspired by the films it doesn't even

[15:25] have the theme song to me it feels like such a half-baked version of Pire to the Caribbean whereas

[15:32] like if you love Dune everything you want is in this game I don't think there's as much crossover

[15:40] between the people that love the Dune movies and the people that buy pinball machines but it's still

[15:46] a stunning machine here's my take on what I think is going to happen with Dune pinball moving forward

[15:52] I think once there's no more being made and I think once people start getting Winchester I do think

[16:00] there is going to be demand for more Dune machines what I mean by that is I think there's going to

[16:06] be more people that want a Dune than Dunes that are available for sale which means that I'm being

[16:12] fair here that I don't think Dune is going to go down in price I just don't I've been studying this

[16:19] hobby for 12 years and I've been wrong a few times I was wrong on the Winchester demand nobody saw

[16:26] that coming I only had a few days to react to it like most of you but hey when the Winchester

[16:31] demand went through the roof I called it like it was you got to get one or you're not going to get

[16:35] one and that's where people are at I tried to get people on the Beetlejuice list for like a year

[16:40] and those who listen got one but I think Dune is going to be just fine I think if you buy a Dune

[16:46] over the next two days I don't think you're going to lose a single penny I think if anything your

[16:53] game is going to go up in price and let me explain why because we are now in a pinball space where

[17:00] nothing by the major manufacturers is really collectible really has any scarcity I mean Jersey

[17:07] Jack's new business model is they're going to make as many CEs as people order okay that's great

[17:13] but that kills like any real collectability it also will in the future hurt the second hand value

[17:21] of the games when there's like three to four thousand Harry Potter CEs out there you know Harry

[17:27] Potter is not the real test of whether or not that's the right move it's going to be Sonic the Hedgehog

[17:32] and you know look Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be amazing the CE is going to be incredible all I'm

[17:37] going to say right now is the CE cabinet is going to blow you away but the thing is this the thing

[17:43] is this there's no FOMO though unless you need it right away there's no FOMO they're going to make

[17:48] that game I think they're going to do the same unlimited nature so I'm looking at the pinball

[17:52] landscape now and I'm saying to myself okay all right there's thousands of people with pinball

[17:57] collections but I do think there is a lot of people out there that just want to have something a little

[18:03] bit different in their game room and so Dune becomes that Winchester becomes that Evil Dead becomes

[18:12] that Beetlejuice becomes that not everyone's going to have one you're not going to see him on

[18:17] location everywhere and I think that's going to be sort of like the nice position for all these

[18:24] boutique companies who make between like 500 and a thousand games total their products will have

[18:31] some baked in scarcity forever and I think that's exciting I like where we're at now where we got

[18:37] sort of Stern and Jersey Jack now are not really making anything truly collectible anymore like

[18:44] nobody wants these Stern at least I think Stern out of all the companies they blew it like they

[18:49] really blew it they had a chance to have both like the mass volume games and the collectible games

[18:56] that everybody wanted and they absolutely blew it they treated their customers that collected

[19:02] their games like crap and they're never going to get them back I mean it they're never going to get

[19:06] them back it's too late now everyone's moved on the competition has gotten so good and the

[19:13] competition is giving you way more for your money when it comes to unique rare collectible games

[19:19] because the great thing about Winchester the great thing about Dune you know what it is

[19:24] if I buy one of 600 dunes I have one of 600 dunes forever and it's beautiful and this is it like

[19:31] every single one is in le every single one is a collector's edition same thing with Winchester

[19:37] same thing with Beetlejuice you know what Beetlejuice Dune and Winchester and Evil Dead will never have

[19:44] they will never have a premium version of the game that those companies will make for years

[19:50] Harry Potter CE is so awesome you know but they're gonna make the wizard edition forever and

[19:55] they're gonna make the CE forever you know what I'm saying we've never seen anyone else do this

[20:00] before this sort of unlimited nature of something that's also supposed to be collected and have a

[20:06] name like collector's edition and have a name like limited edition and yet for some reason

[20:12] none of that feels special anymore so the boutiques are really in a great position to sort of build

[20:18] their companies to the right size get like a certain number of buyers every single year and then

[20:24] you'll be good this whole world now like everyone needs to grow everything needs to keep getting

[20:28] bigger and bigger it's ruining the world we're so tired like we've all seen Wally if everything just

[20:36] keeps growing and becoming mass mass mass bigger bigger bigger more profits make the shareholders

[20:42] happy at what expense at what expense that is not what pinball is that is not what pinball will

[20:50] ever be and that is the big problem over at stern pinball is they need to be that mass

[20:56] monstrosity that is all about profit and the bottom line to keep their investors happy at the cost

[21:05] of making their pinball customer happy and we've seen it and we've seen it for four years now so

[21:10] will stern be able to like turn a corner with pokemon transformers and fallout so to put a pin on it

[21:18] i think if you're on the fence about ordering dune i think you should get it i really do i'm also

[21:25] like thinking about it man because i've seen this game with the alternative trans light and it is one

[21:31] of the most stunning machines i've ever seen and again i'm just looking at what happened to winchester

[21:37] and i think everybody who has a winchester who doesn't have a dune is maybe gonna want one after

[21:44] and then it might be too late so all i'm saying is this i think your money is safe on dune machines

[21:49] holding value or going up post december 31st that is if they only make the 600 or so games and that

[21:58] is only if david comes out and says this is it no more ever but if he keeps the door open

[22:05] because that's 400 more new games that might be made that will cause the games to go down in value

[22:12] so i think a lot of what happens over the next three days will determine what the future value

[22:19] is of these dune machines and you got to stick to your guns right and i'm proud of these guys

[22:24] that they didn't do any show games with winchesters you know i'm still upset that spookies doing 80

[22:31] show games for beetle juice like that is the biggest garbage move ever bug and luke no i hate it

[22:37] it was so garbage to do that i've never seen another pinball company make 10 more games basically

[22:45] because there was demand i mean come on the last time that happened is when stern said there was

[22:50] going to be 500 monsters and then they knocked it up to 600 after they said 500 it's stupid nobody

[22:57] likes it you don't need to do it you don't need to be greedy just stick with what you said you

[23:01] were gonna do and do it now speaking of sticking with what you said you were gonna do before i

[23:07] talk about fallout at the end want to talk about real quickly this ridiculous dude who's now been

[23:14] blacklisted from the pinball community he goes by the name mr christopher scully thompson and long

[23:22] story short is he bought a foo fighter topper second hand and nobody would help him out getting it

[23:29] fixed until i believe it was orange county pinball dealer and distro helped him get the topper fixed

[23:37] from stern pinball they sent the topper to stern stern repaired it sent it back to this guy okay

[23:45] that's where the story should end christopher scully thompson should have been happy that

[23:50] oce pinball helped him out went the extra mile and that's how the story should end but no

[23:57] something else happened by mistake stern pinball mailed him a brand new inbox $2,000

[24:06] foo fighter topper by mistake so they must have got messed up and not recorded that they fixed and

[24:13] sent back the other one they might have thought they were just sending him a replacement and so

[24:18] this guy gets the new topper the reason why oce pinball knows this is they get an invoice from

[24:24] stern that they sent the new topper to christopher scully thompson and when the dealer asks him

[24:33] did you get the topper he says no he never got it he says he never received it in the mail okay so

[24:40] right there he got it he knew he got it and he lied and fedex had the photos of the box on his

[24:48] front porch and so it could have ended there where he could have just like said i never got it and

[24:55] rode off into the sunset and nobody would be trying to crucify this man but he didn't stop there

[25:02] he then lists the topper for sale on pin side for $1,300 and i think he sells it instantly of

[25:12] course because he's selling it for such a low price he took what he knew was not his he got one for

[25:19] free and he decides to sell it and everybody sees this oce pinball sees this robin sees it

[25:26] everybody sees it and even after getting caught right he gets caught doing this he deactivates his

[25:33] account doesn't come clean and doesn't offer to return the topper or the money to all the parties

[25:41] involved whether sending it back to stern or sending it back to the dealer and now they have this

[25:46] guy's information they have the company he works for they have his linked in and they're going after

[25:52] him and look i'm just gonna say this like first of all the guy's a scumbag like that is a scummy

[25:58] scummy move and there's one thing to do something and try to get away with it but once you get caught

[26:05] like come out and just say yeah you know what it's been a rough few months i thought i could just

[26:12] you know use the money and i did this i shouldn't have done it i'm sorry here you go here's the money

[26:17] back here's the product back but no man to double down on being a jackass like this is unreal but

[26:27] let me ask you a question knowing that he did this and people are now posting where he works and people

[26:34] are saying call his employer that is where i'm like come on like that's going too far as far as i'm

[26:41] concerned this is now an issue between the dealer this gentleman and stern pinball and yes

[26:49] maybe pinside because that's where the sale happened and robin has banned him from pinside

[26:57] and deactivated his account but now the mob wants more they want blood they want to go after this guy

[27:05] he is a member of the pinball community what i really don't get and i try hard to understand

[27:10] people's motivations you know there's a lot of crooks out there john poppadoog robert mueller

[27:15] kevin coolick we've seen our fair share of crooks and pinball damien over at haggis you know where

[27:21] people are like purposely misleading people to try to survive and and that often leads them to lying

[27:29] i wouldn't say stealing money but they're disingenuous and everything they do and say

[27:34] because they're trying to survive but this is a guy that doesn't need this topper to survive

[27:40] he's not trying to keep his pinball company afloat in fact it's the dealer who's a small business

[27:45] that's trying to survive and should not have to eat a two thousand dollar topper because this guy

[27:52] is a thief now that being said going after someone's employment because of something they do

[28:00] off to the side in pinball it's something i've had to deal with a few times in my career and and by

[28:06] some people that are still on pinside by some people that are still on pinside and i'm not going

[28:11] to name names because i don't want to bring it up again but these are some people that are still

[28:15] part of the pinball community you see them at shows you see them on pinside and they literally

[28:21] called up my employer and tried to get me fired uh one of which did it when i had a newborn baby

[28:27] okay so this is some of the the characters we're dealing with in pinball and i think for each

[28:32] and every one of us you know you learn in life that as a good person with good values whether you're

[28:38] a person who believes in god or you're religious it doesn't matter if you are or not if you're just

[28:43] a good person there comes a point where if your mama and daddy raised you right you do the right

[28:50] thing and it's crazy to me that someone would sell their reputation their parents's reputation

[28:59] their family name would be sullied mr scully over two thousand dollars you know you had an

[29:06] opportunity to steal something an opportunity to give it back and even if you got caught stealing

[29:13] you still double down on the lie and i think it's really embarrassing for him we won't see him anymore

[29:20] i was almost thinking of doing a fundraiser for oc pinball from the canada community

[29:25] to make this guy whole maybe we should do that you guys think we should do that should we do a

[29:29] alive this week and raise enough money to erase the damages of this loser in the pinball community

[29:37] but don't call up his job don't try to dox people and trust me karma will always get these individuals

[29:45] he will live with this shame forever and look some people don't feel shame like i don't think

[29:50] robert meuller feels any shame stealing 61 million dollars from old ladies to try and

[29:56] build a pinball machine i don't i don't think marty feels any shame and what he was doing with damien

[30:01] and telling people everything was fine when they weren't i don't think they feel the shame

[30:06] i don't i really think there's people out there that absolutely are narcissistic sociopaths

[30:12] that feel no shame whatsoever and they justify this behavior somehow okay but for the rest of us

[30:18] out there just do the right thing okay just do the right thing all right let me end this podcast

[30:24] by talking quickly about fallout so i've been watching the fallout tv show and i've been enjoying it

[30:30] and i was having a good time and then i got an email from someone i'm sorry i forgot your name

[30:35] who said chris you have to go look at the reality of the fallout franchise and for people who love

[30:42] the video game they absolutely despise the tv show because the tv show has bastardized the lore

[30:50] of what fallout is all about and for lack of a better term you know they turn the show into more

[30:56] of like a woke dee i version of fallout is what people are saying on the youtube's of the world

[31:01] and look i'm enjoying the show i never really played the video game and i just want to say this

[31:08] if you watch the fallout tv show having never played the video game that's not a crime a lot of

[31:16] people are gonna do that it is inspired by the video game and i'm just so desensitized by now

[31:23] to all of the whole like woke ism in hollywood it's everywhere now i don't even care anymore

[31:28] like you now know that everything you see is gonna have every ethnicity represented there's

[31:35] gonna be biracial couples everywhere there's gonna be trans characters everywhere i don't even care

[31:40] anymore you know it's at the point now where like i really don't care all i want now is a good story

[31:45] if you give me a good story you can put whoever you want in the damn character roles i don't even

[31:50] care because remember when that stuff was like a distraction it doesn't even distract me anymore

[31:54] it's just like okay but it's a story good and i will say having watched season one over the last

[32:00] week i really was pulled into the storyline around fallout so i think they've done a good job

[32:07] i don't have any frame of reference into what they bastardize i'm just going off of the show

[32:12] now that being said do i think after watching this show and getting through season one do i think

[32:20] that fallout pinball is a good theme for pinball and will be successful and you know maybe maybe

[32:28] and i'll explain why because it is such a unique world under glass and i think first and foremost

[32:34] i think one of the most important things is creating that world under glass so i think the

[32:39] fallout world this post apocalyptic world in all of its mixtures of like 1950s americana

[32:48] and sort of mad max post apocalyptic wasteland is really really awesome to create that world

[32:55] under glass but the reason why i think this game is going to fail as a stern pinball game

[33:01] is i think stern pinball will try to make that world under glass using flat plastic and making

[33:09] it cheap because if they have to spend the money on the license they're not going to spend it on

[33:14] making a true world under glass and that is why i think if stern does fall out keith elwin's going

[33:24] to make it shoot great but i think it's going to come across looking a lot cheaper than it should

[33:30] and i think stern pinball if you were to ask me this would be the game where they really need to

[33:36] start putting in 3d scopes like miniature neon signs like stuff that is real stuff that is molded

[33:47] stuff that is sculpted no more flat plastic screws everywhere with the part number on it

[33:54] the storyline is there you know what i like about the show in terms of making it into a pinball machine

[33:59] it's a journey and within each episode you could see the modes of the game the other thing is would

[34:06] they have season two which is airing right now it's not complete would that be in the game i think

[34:11] that would be important you know i'm watching stranger things season five right now and stern's

[34:16] game only goes up to the first two seasons i don't know about you i'm kind of over stranger things

[34:22] i'm like watching the last episode or the last the second the last episode and i feel like the whole

[34:27] damn show is them huddling about what they're gonna do them actually doing it takes like 30 seconds

[34:35] but the whole thing is them figuring out what the plan is and it's like six different side quests

[34:41] going on at the same time where everyone's just trying to talk about what the plan is

[34:46] and i don't really care anymore i just want to get to the end of the show everybody thank you for
