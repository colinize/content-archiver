[00:00] Well they did it.

[00:13] They got you to pay ten to fifteen thousand dollars for a pinball machine before you even

[00:20] saw it flipped.

[00:22] How do you feel now after watching El Vira flipped for the first time last night?

[00:27] Let's talk about that after we hear Axe or Rose's weirdest song ever right here.

[00:57] Alright I'm just going to come out of the gates swinging on episode was this 403 of

[01:13] Canadian pinball podcasts.

[01:15] I just spent an hour watching the Jack Danger stream of El Vira House of Horrors and I'm

[01:22] just going to be honest.

[01:23] I walked away from that stream saying to myself, I can't

[01:27] believe people spent ten to fifteen thousand dollars on this machine that fifty of these

[01:34] games went for fifteen grand before people even saw the game played and I feel disappointed.

[01:41] I just feel an overall disappointment in this hobby that this is the most expensive pinball

[01:48] machine that has ever been sold from the factory ever right.

[01:54] This and Batman 66 super limited edition are the two most expensive games that have

[01:58] ever been sold and put in a box ever and do you really walk away feeling like this is

[02:05] the greatest example of pinball and this should be the highest price pinball game ever.

[02:10] I'm sorry but I just can't get over the fact that this was already served to us at such

[02:17] a premium price right this exclusive like limited game El Vira and come on can you walk

[02:24] away from this game without feeling like the I don't know unless you're like the biggest

[02:30] diehard El Vira fan who loves all these campy movies that El Vira was a part of how are

[02:37] you really going to get into this game.

[02:40] I mean when they were explaining it first of all like it was like a twenty minute explanation

[02:46] of how to play this game.

[02:49] You know me I am not a fan of things that take way too long to explain.

[02:55] I mean when you explain Batman 66 it's so simple it's like you shoot each villain shot

[03:00] twice and you start the mode.

[03:02] Then you just light the TV mode to get the minor villains and you're in you can explain

[03:06] the whole game of Batman so quickly when they're going over the explanation of how to play

[03:11] this game my head is spinning and you know people look at this play field like all the

[03:16] inserts and all the stuff that Lyman is going to do and I'm just looking at like well this

[03:21] is kind of silly.

[03:23] Why does a game have to be so like have so much going on in it and look that's that's

[03:28] we all know Lyman is going to make the game awesome but here's my thing here's my thing

[03:34] if you don't love El Vira and you don't love these like be campy movies that she's

[03:39] a part of I don't think you're going to really appreciate this game and enjoy it and I

[03:44] think a lot of people ran to this game and I think a lot of people I bet all those 50

[03:50] guys who spend 15 thousand dollars have never ever seen any of these movies they have no

[03:55] idea at all they it just they they just love like El Vira and you know and and here's

[04:01] thing I'm watching the stream and I'm just going to be honest here in Canada's Bimball

[04:05] Podcast because I don't care about getting Dennis Norman or Lyman sheets on the show

[04:11] here's El Vira in most of the clips I mean she's like she's barely in it and maybe more

[04:16] those are to come but she's in it for a little bit and she explains some of the modes

[04:21] but for the most part I don't know this game is just like it's like this walk through

[04:26] these movies that nobody cares about and you're telling me that that's going to be an

[04:32] amazing pinball experience and here's the thing and I'm just going to say it and I've said

[04:36] it so many times over the last three years for 15 thousand dollars for a pinball game

[04:43] all right is it too much to ask one simple question and this is the thing that I think

[04:47] should start out every single pinball machine when it's designed what does the ball do in

[04:54] this game that's magical okay can I just ask that question tell me I just watched the

[05:00] game being flipped for an hour what is the ball do in El Vira House of horrors that is magical

[05:07] that is like oh my god did you just see the ball do that did you just see that happen not a

[05:13] nothing it's look it's it's it's what you expect everything in this game is what we expected it

[05:20] to be there's nothing there's no like crazy surprises and awesome things happening there's no

[05:26] I'm just going to say it magic what I'm ready to just just hang up this show and I mean that

[05:33] because I'm just so tired of people spending all this money on products that just don't have

[05:42] anything magical happening on the damn game and it's so much to freaking ask we've had so many

[05:48] years of you can use magnets you can use vertical up kicks you can have disappearing magnets you can

[05:53] have subway systems you can have all the stuff that a pinball that a physical pinball could do

[05:59] and you're telling me that when you look at this game you see something magical happening I

[06:07] don't get it I don't get it and then we we have to fall back on what's on the screen and the code

[06:12] and all this stuff but that's the problem with this game you're not going to fall back on like

[06:17] clips like Batman that you love because you love the Joker you love the penguin you love the

[06:21] riddler you know that when I'm watching these clips you I don't know about you but there's like zero

[06:26] there's zero emotional connection to anything happening in the universe of Elvira and I think

[06:33] so many of you out there just got like you just you just got suckered into buying this thing because

[06:40] it was just the new shiny toy and starting to genius think about it for a minute they've locked in

[06:46] 50 of you are committed to buying this game for 15,000 dollars and there's no backing out now

[06:54] there's no backing out now 400 of you have already bought this game for like $10,000 and there's

[07:03] no backing out now you're you're committed and I don't know how how you wake up as a fan of

[07:11] pinball and as a fan of like all that's possible in a pinball game and you can tell me with a straight

[07:17] face that you think it's worth that how how how did it come to this you know Stern has done an

[07:24] amazing thing they've used marketing tactics that normally that normally are justified by the end

[07:32] product but they don't even need to worry about that this game looks like it should be like every

[07:38] other Stern game like there should be a pro version without maybe one little mecanid and it

[07:43] should be like $6,000 and then it should be like it just feels like a $7,500 game and it is like

[07:49] right it is and they know that and they know it's just another Stern but they just made some arbitrary

[07:56] different decisions with the art package and then you guys all fell for it like a bunch of suckers

[08:02] and I know on the show like can you blame them you know can you blame the guy who's going to be happy

[08:06] look I get it I get it if you're happy and you bought this game cool but I just think this hobby

[08:13] deserves more and as someone who covers the pinball hobby I'm not slamming the game I think it's

[08:19] what I'm doing is I'm slamming the fact that this game costs so much money I'm slamming the fact

[08:25] that so many of you out there felt so compelled to buy something you never saw like it's stupid right

[08:32] think about it like this buying this game that you never saw flipped before for so much money

[08:38] it's like the equivalent of investing in something before you even hear the sales pitch before

[08:44] you even know what's in it it's like giving a movie a glowing review before you ever seen it

[08:51] like when you hand Stern and its distributors all that money millions of dollars right

[08:56] millions of dollars like those at least are roughly four million dollars and the signature additions

[09:02] is another god knows how much 800 thousand or whatever right when you hand them that much money

[09:09] without even seeing the game flipped what do you think they do do you think they go back into the room

[09:15] and say hey we got it we got to add more magic to the games we got to we got to do more no they gave

[09:20] you less and you paid more for it so I'm here to say that as long as people keep buying this way

[09:29] you can pretty much guarantee that you're not going to get more for your money that you're not

[09:35] going to see more pinball magic if you act that way you know in in every other hobby I follow and

[09:42] every other category I'm interested in it's the complete opposite then the companies have to

[09:48] keep improving and giving you more for the money and actually the prices go down as stuff gets

[09:54] better the pinball is complete opposite it's not even you know what this isn't even about pinball

[10:00] anymore it's like it's it's weird you know I went to an art gallery last night it was my birthday

[10:05] my friend it took me to an art gallery before you went to dinner and I'm looking at art and it's

[10:10] like eight thousand five thousand ten thousand I told her I'm like you know this is kind of like

[10:14] pinball it's no longer about the game and about making the best games ever it's just like

[10:21] stern pinball is just making artwork that is playable that they will sell to you and the more

[10:27] limited the art pieces the more they can charge and it doesn't and nothing else matters it doesn't

[10:32] matter it doesn't matter if if something's being done for the first time it doesn't matter if

[10:38] if they're raising the bar on any level they they just have you in this gallery of pinball

[10:44] and these rich guys just feel compelled to run to it and that's how I feel I feel like we deserve more

[10:52] and I feel like the companies that are trying the hardest they're not finding the buyers

[10:57] because they're also making so many stupid mistakes I mean let's be honest here I mean the stern

[11:01] is not dumb Elvira has a following Elvira has a fan base and but I still don't think that most

[11:08] of you who bought this game I I don't think most of you have seen these movies I don't think you

[11:13] know what you got yourself into I think you you ran to the flame you jumped in you gave your money

[11:19] and this is what you got now and I don't think all the coding in the world is not going to make people

[11:24] have any emotional connection to any of those clips in Elvira pinball and and I'm just going to say

[11:30] the final note on it is this it doesn't feel that campion fun it just doesn't have the the level

[11:38] of personality in the other as the other Elvira games do so this is what you get and I wish I

[11:46] could look at this game differently right because here's the thing that this game wasn't you know

[11:51] delivered to us with these premium price points with all this like signature series and a piece of

[11:57] the couch and 15,000 for nothing if it wasn't delivered to us like this I would look at it differently

[12:04] right do you look at a hundred thousand dollar car differently than a thirty thousand dollar car

[12:10] absolutely do you look at a you know a fifty dollar piece of steak differently than a five dollar

[12:16] hamburger absolutely so if stern wants to serve this up to us at these price points I'm going to

[12:22] look at it differently and I'm going to expect it to be one of the greatest pinball experiences ever

[12:28] and it should blow us away with what's mechanically in the game and come on people wake the f up are you

[12:34] being blown away by anything you see here the trunk looks cheap the house you know I like whatever

[12:41] it's just it's all whatever that that that is so not as cool the house is nowhere near as cool as

[12:50] the medieval madness castle nowhere near as cool nowhere near as functional and the medieval

[12:55] madness castle was twenty years ago wake the f up people why is it twenty years ago we got such a

[13:03] better mechanism and you know how much medieval madness cost if you wanted to buy it back then

[13:08] probably like thirty five hundred bucks this game is twelve thousand dollars more in the signature

[13:15] series than medieval madness was originally and this is what you get you get my point is stern

[13:21] and everybody they want you to live in this little bubble of like here and now buy what's

[13:27] available here and now don't think about what else is available it kills me to be a fan of this hobby

[13:32] and know that fifty suckers out there paid fifteen thousand dollars you could get you could get for

[13:39] fifteen thousand dollars a mint restored brass played it theater of magic and and a tails of

[13:47] the Arabian nights for fifteen thousand dollars both games have so much more magic than a virus

[13:54] or you could just buy this because there's only fifteen it's the rarest game and everybody fell

[13:58] for the hype everybody did distributors were doing it they were calling up everybody there's only

[14:02] fifty it's going to sell out and and where where where's the outcry where is it where is where

[14:09] where is the other pinball media saying this is BS they're not doing it they're they're just going

[14:14] to like they're they're going to allow everyone to come on the show they're just going to listen to

[14:18] the stern people you're going to have nature's do is stern podcast where just like let's interview

[14:23] everybody let's let's celebrate this moment and I'm here to tell you why the effort we celebrating a

[14:29] moment in which the most expensive pinball machine ever it is this and we're celebrating that

[14:35] this hobby is so silly lately like we're congratulating Dwight on finishing ghost buses three

[14:41] years after the game came out three years three years later a game is finally finished and we're

[14:49] supposed to be happy about that you bought it you bought an incomplete product three years ago

[14:55] all right this is this is stupid it's stupid and maybe some of us need to all just wake up

[15:01] and and realize Elvira looks like it's going to be a good game it doesn't look like it's going to be

[15:07] the greatest game ever it doesn't look like it's going to pull you in emotionally it doesn't look

[15:12] like it's I don't think it's going to be better than Metallica or walking dead or Batman because

[15:16] those are better themes Elvira is is weird to me it's like she is an iconic figure but what she's

[15:25] associated with is is crap those movies are crap they're can't be crap they are not good and how

[15:33] how much of that are you going to really get excited to see like wouldn't you rather see like

[15:38] your favorite movie or your favorite TV show come to life then that absolutely all right

[15:44] god canada what's wrong after your birthday we had an amazing omelcase dinner Brenda is incredible

[15:52] I'm really just looking out for you guys I really am I want you to get the best products

[15:58] imaginable you're spending so much more money than I know it doesn't mean a lot to many of you

[16:04] but to most of you it does most of you who listen to this show are not multi-millionaires

[16:10] you you you really want to get the most for your money and I just don't hear anybody else asking

[16:17] for you to get that I don't you know it's like Marty had head to head pinball like Marty's

[16:22] a rich guy apparently just buys every Ellie and me mean the Australian blokes who buy these games

[16:27] are super loaded over in Australia these games are like $15,000 for for an Ellie right so the

[16:34] a virus signature over in Australia is like over 20 grand and they buy them and and and and and

[16:41] and but but it's like they don't even care or expect more or want more and and I'm just here to say

[16:48] like if if I walked in front of an a virus signature edition and someone told me that was $15,000

[16:54] I would spit my drink out laughing it's just not there so why aren't we asking for more you know

[17:00] we got a company like Jersey Jack trying to do so much more put so much more in the pinball and

[17:04] there it is it is a level above these sterns it is you don't it is we all know that now you you know

[17:10] me I know that Jack always finds amazing new ways to like mess it up all the time but why why is all

[17:17] this is it like this is this is the hobby we're in like this is we can't have someone why can't

[17:23] someone just do it Dutch pinball did right upper plate of lower plate field magic all throughout the

[17:28] game well the pinball goes bowling for the first time ever in a in a pinball machine in such a

[17:33] cool way like that game is awesome like the car pops out you bash the car right there's a reason

[17:40] why people fell in love with that game and why can't these companies with all these resources just

[17:45] do something like that you know the fact that people spent more money on Elvira than big Lebowski's

[17:53] is insane and when you look at people buying Elvira for 15k then what's Lebowski worth

[17:59] way it's got way more in it it's a theme people like more unbelievable where we're at now maybe

[18:06] I should like what do you think I want you guys to email me can you to pinball gmail.com am I being

[18:10] unfair am I am I like am I am I my raining on your parade should I just step back and let you guys

[18:16] enjoy your elis I'm going to say it I think if you went all in on this expensive Elvira I just think

[18:22] and if and if you don't love Elvira to death and know all these movies and I think you're a

[18:28] sucker I really do I think you just like I think you're probably waking up to the fact that this

[18:33] isn't going to going to be as enjoyable as you thought it would be it is so deep into the Elvira

[18:39] world all right what else is going on on Gnados pinball podcast we're gonna move on we're gonna

[18:45] move on here's what I would also talk about deep route because something occurred to me when you

[18:50] read what they said and how they they will happily license their stuff to other manufacturers out

[18:57] there I think we all should be pretty worried because does that mean that they're going to patent

[19:06] troll other companies like did Robert did he apply for patents on basic things that are in

[19:14] pinball machines that manufacturers are using and will he then go after them so we'll save that

[19:20] happens I hope that doesn't happen you know jump pop it was like this he used to file all these

[19:26] patents like to protect all these things like jump pop it because of patent for using a screen

[19:32] underneath the glass like he he owns the patent for that and so when you see like little LCD screens

[19:39] in games like Willie Wonka you when you see it in Wizard of Oz when you see it in Star Wars

[19:45] potentially jump pop it you might be able to sue for using a screen in that manner in a pinball

[19:52] game now what I what I hope happens is this I just hope deep route deep route makes amazing games

[19:58] and the games stand on their own and they don't start to go down in ugly road of of of using legal

[20:05] threats to get other pinball companies to change what they put in their games I don't I don't want

[20:12] that in this hobby I don't think there's a place for that in pinball so let's see if that happens

[20:17] or not I need to give a huge shout out first of all to Craig young Craig Craig donated a hundred

[20:23] dollars to Canadian pinball podcast patreon page and I'm looking at Brenda right now we're like Craig

[20:29] thank you so much that will pay for one one of our homocases in New York City now if you don't

[20:37] know what homocassie is it's way better than pinball homocassie is when the chef at a Japanese

[20:42] restaurant selects each piece of sushi at a time and it's like zero dreams of sushi and they put it

[20:48] in front of you and you quickly eat it and you get like 15 pieces over an hour to two hours it's

[20:53] amazing I highly suggest that you people out there who spent 15 thousand dollars on Elvira

[21:00] cancel your order and spend the 15 thousand dollars on homocassie and I guarantee you will enjoy

[21:07] the homocassie more so thank you so much Craig I also got a new patreon donator Nicholas

[21:15] Nicholas and Agnesto I just brooted your name Nicholas you're I think you're Greek like me

[21:20] thank you so much for the donation guys patreon canate a pinball let's do this to 2500 listeners

[21:28] I knew each of you guys out there who listens can donate at least a dollar a month I mean see

[21:33] think about how little that is oh my god okay what else is going on in the pinball world guys

[21:39] here's the thing here's the thing I just want the games to be as great as they can be right

[21:44] I want to I want all the pinball media out there to stop being like everything is awesome you know

[21:50] everything is great let's get these coders and designers on the shows you know most of you guys

[21:56] out there make way more money than these coders and designers and you when you when you prop them

[22:01] up to be like pinball gods it was weird to like seeing Dennis Nordman there like isn't he working

[22:06] at deep route like what's he doing there like you know part of these just like does any like I don't

[22:11] know they're just something strange about it all it's like pinball tries you know stern is really

[22:16] trying to bury everybody and they're going to I mean don't get me wrong stern pinball is going to

[22:21] clobber the entire industry next year it's over it's already over like we know this you know this I

[22:27] know this internet connectivity is coming John Borg's next game in 2020 the first game of the year

[22:33] is going to put everyone else like under it's happening it's going to happen you know from what

[22:38] I hear stern has in the works and from what I've been told it's over it's like it's like it's

[22:42] comical that these other companies are trying to compete you know jack needs to get toy story out

[22:47] in front of guns or roses he just does it's just like Jersey Jack has a chance he's had so many

[22:53] chances I I think he's trying hard or he is but like it's just it's painful to me to watch like

[22:59] stern just clobber everybody and no one can understand you know here's what's painful is like

[23:03] what stern does is not like revolutionary it's just smart they're just really smart at what they do

[23:10] they give you just enough to be a customer and they keep you coming back but here's what they

[23:17] always do they announce a game they get you the game they and and you get it within a month or two

[23:23] they don't allow you enough time to back out they don't allow you enough time to even play the

[23:29] game they don't allow you enough time to see the finished code they've already got you they don't

[23:34] give a crap like think about it why would they care I'm surprised they even went back to Ghostbusters

[23:40] why do they care they sold every single one they sold thousands of Ghostbusters with the way it

[23:45] was designed and coded which I think was terribly designed the game is one of the worst designs ever

[23:51] and yet you all bought it because it's Ghostbusters like you can't not buy it it's Ghostbusters

[23:56] and so stern so smart and I love watching what they do as a marketer I am fascinated by Mr.

[24:03] George Gomez I am fascinated by the way Gary and company run that business it always it always

[24:11] amazes me how they're able to get the reaction from the community they do with what they give

[24:19] because everybody deep down like it's like deep down you know it's like when you date a girl like

[24:23] deep down inside you know you don't really love but you constantly tell her you lover you know

[24:28] you know that I know you gentlemen out there you know that feeling it's like it's like deep down

[24:32] inside we know we don't really love stern pinball games but we keep telling them we love them because

[24:39] they're like they're good enough right it's like that girl that's just good enough to date for

[24:43] a lot of years and what we're really all looking for is like that that girl that's just gonna like

[24:49] that we lust over that we just want to like you know ripper close off that's the you know jump

[24:55] across the table and you can't keep your hands off her that's what everybody is searching for in

[25:00] pinball and you've been searching for it for so long and we thought it was jersey jack right we

[25:05] thought jersey jack would be like the porn star that would like make us all go crazy and it didn't

[25:10] really materialize that way and that's all we want in this hobby we want the pinball machine that

[25:16] makes us want to jump across the table and just go at it and are you telling me that these games are

[25:23] that no stern is like the good long term relationship that's like you just always want to have around

[25:28] because at least you have somebody right that's to me that's stern it's like at least we have

[25:33] some company that keeps giving us pinball machines and you can't knock them right that girl just

[25:39] keeps coming back and they keep you know they're always there it's a constant but it doesn't really

[25:46] in your soul make you feel like these are the best games we can get this is pinball love at its

[25:52] fine it's it's not there it's not there you know no show notes no editing just me talking about

[25:59] this hobby in a way that I just don't hear anyone else talking about it and I don't know why like

[26:06] why did why is everything about this hobby covered across the board on such a surface level all

[26:13] this money all this energy that you apply to pinball and and I feel like everyone is just looking at

[26:20] like like skin deep like that's it the no one wants to go deeper and actually like feel

[26:25] a soft like think about this hobby a little bit and I hope we do this on this show I hope that's

[26:31] why you listen I hope that's why we get your twippy vote and I hope we I hope we win the

[26:36] twippy three years in a row I think that would be awesome because this is the only show think about

[26:41] it this is the only pinball podcast that's not listed on pin sides list of pinball podcasts they

[26:49] band they ban this show from even being on the list this is the only show in which manufacturers

[26:56] are afraid they're afraid to come on and talk about their pinball games they're afraid to do it

[27:02] they won't do it right and this is the only show that two years in a row was voted number one by
