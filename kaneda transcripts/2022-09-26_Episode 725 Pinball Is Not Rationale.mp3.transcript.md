[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadi's Pinball Podcast, the world's number one feel good pinball podcaster.

[00:18] First and foremost, thank you for all of the birthday wishes this weekend.

[00:22] It was awesome.

[00:23] I have the best fans in all of pinball.

[00:27] If you haven't listened to what anyone else says, you guys and gals are the greatest crew ever assembled when it comes to pinball content creator fans.

[00:35] I mean, I think we're almost at 560 club members.

[00:39] Keep going people, like I said, just invite a friend and we're gonna get to a thousand one day.

[00:43] But it was a great birthday weekend.

[00:45] It was so much fun doing the James Bond to Ellie Raffle.

[00:49] Michael Bryan won it.

[00:51] I don't even know if he really wants it that bad.

[00:53] We called over to him and he was like out doing gardening work.

[00:56] He wasn't even watching the Facebook live, but we did it fair and square.

[01:00] Everybody's name went into the box and my beautiful little boy, Killian, picked the winning names out and we did it really fun.

[01:08] We picked seven names out and they became the seven finalists and then we picked the winner.

[01:13] So congratulations, Mike.

[01:15] You're gonna get the right to buy a James Bond, Ellie for like $14,000 plus taxes and whatnot from Mike over at Automated.

[01:25] I want to say thank you to Mike for giving us an allocation of an Ellie to do the raffle.

[01:30] So here are my thoughts about what's going on in pinball right now.

[01:33] I was thinking like, what do I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast?

[01:38] Because we're all still waiting for James Bond gameplay.

[01:41] We're waiting to see the 60th anniversary game.

[01:44] How much is it really going to cost us?

[01:47] And I've just been sort of perusing pin side.

[01:49] I always like to sort of capture what's going on in the community.

[01:53] What's the vibe?

[01:54] How are people thinking about pinball right now?

[01:56] And it's pretty divided.

[01:58] Like there are people out there that think the prices are crazy and that no one's gonna buy at these prices.

[02:03] And then I'm hearing from distributors, James Bond, Ellie at $13,000 sold out like right away.

[02:11] That there are none to be had, that you cannot call around and find a single distributor to sell you a game for $13,000.

[02:18] Now, some will raise the price.

[02:20] You will find distributors selling this game now for $14,500, $15,000, $16,000 firm.

[02:27] You know, there are going to be dealers out there that are going to hold back their allotment.

[02:31] I wouldn't be surprised if almost every distro now just holds one game back.

[02:37] And then six months from now, the only place on planet earth you can find a new inbox,

[02:41] James Bond, Ellie is with one of these distributors.

[02:45] And it's just more money in the bank.

[02:48] Every dollar over $13,000 is going into the pocket of the distributor.

[02:54] And it's hard to blame them for doing this because now in pinball,

[02:59] even though the prices are going up and up and up, the demand is greater than it's ever been.

[03:04] And so have we hit a ceiling?

[03:06] The answer is we have not.

[03:08] Now, but here's the thing.

[03:09] It's not about how rich you are and how many games you can afford and how much room you have in your McMansion.

[03:14] The whole point is this.

[03:16] I think each and every one of us are in this hobby to just enjoy it.

[03:20] And our enjoyment level has its limits.

[03:23] And I want to talk about that on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[03:26] because I think some of us and some of you out there, you overthink this stuff.

[03:31] You get too emotionally wrapped up in the moment.

[03:34] So I'm like looking at pinside.

[03:35] I'm seeing a lot of people like saying a lot of depressing things about the price of the game,

[03:41] about how horrible they think it is that Stern's doing this 60th anniversary edition.

[03:46] This and that and everything that could be wrong or everything that's upsetting you.

[03:50] And I'm just thinking to myself, here we are, most of us, we're all still alive on planet earth.

[03:54] If we're reading pinside, we're all into this niche community in which 99.9% of people aren't into it.

[04:01] And so why would you follow pinball in a way that makes you upset?

[04:06] I know pinside is a subculture within pinball, because I still think a lot of people who buy these machines,

[04:13] they don't know what pinside is.

[04:15] They don't know what canade is pinball podcast is.

[04:18] They don't listen to pinball media.

[04:20] They simply walk into a distributor's showroom and they buy a game,

[04:24] or they might be on Facebook and they see an ad for a pinball machine.

[04:28] And they're like, hey, honey, wouldn't it be fun if we put Toy Story 4 in the basement?

[04:32] And they have no idea.

[04:34] They have no idea that this is not what it's supposed to cost.

[04:37] And for them, it's just a normal thing.

[04:39] All right, I'm going to spend $12,000 on a pinball machine.

[04:42] These people weren't around when Stern LEs were like $6,500.

[04:46] They don't even care what an LE is.

[04:48] They don't even really care who the designers are.

[04:50] They don't even know who these coders are.

[04:52] For most people who buy these machines, it's just a pinball machine.

[04:56] And we can't lose track of that.

[04:58] We always have to remind ourselves these are entertainment devices meant to entertain us and give us joy.

[05:05] It's not meant to stress us out.

[05:06] And here's the thing that I think we always have to remind ourselves.

[05:09] No matter what new game comes out, no matter what a company wants to charge for a pinball machine,

[05:15] no matter what happens in the pinball world, you have the power.

[05:20] You have the power to decide whether or not you want to buy the game or not.

[05:24] You have the power to decide whether or not you want to get overly invested in a thread

[05:29] about it that's making everybody stressed out.

[05:31] You have the power to say, I'll just wait.

[05:33] See, when I look at these prices, like $13,000 for 1000 LEs and then $9,700 for the premium,

[05:40] and then $500 of a single level game for like, who knows what, like $20,000 is Keith Elwin machine.

[05:48] I just, every time I look at the 60th anniversary edition, I don't see a $20,000 pin.

[05:53] I don't see a $15,000 pin.

[05:56] I don't see a $10,000 pin.

[05:58] And for those of you out there who are like, well, it's going to go for a lot, a lot of money, that's fine.

[06:03] You know, guess what?

[06:04] Like this thing is designed for like very wealthy James Bond fanatics.

[06:09] And maybe there are enough of them out there to want a single level game for this much money,

[06:13] but it's not worth it to me.

[06:15] You know, it just doesn't make any sense to me, especially since there's already this like fully

[06:19] featured Gomez game that's going to be a lot cheaper, a lot easier to play, a lot easier to access.

[06:26] I think it's going to be more enjoyable.

[06:28] I just think everything about the Gomez pin is going to be a lot more special.

[06:32] And so why would I get all upset that I also can't have one of these Keith Elwin versions of James Bond?

[06:38] It was a really interesting marketing move that Stern did this.

[06:42] I don't think we've really ever seen this done before.

[06:45] And the whole thing has been a very strange reveal, right?

[06:48] Because they don't have the games on the line right now.

[06:51] They don't have games to show us right now.

[06:54] And I don't even know if the game is done yet.

[06:56] And so what we're seeing now is they were contractually obligated to get these games out

[07:01] to coincide with the James Bond anniversary.

[07:04] But we haven't really seen this from Stern in a very long time.

[07:07] All of Stern's most recent releases over the last couple years,

[07:11] the game has been shown when the game is already shipping basically.

[07:16] On the day of reveal, pros are heading out to operator locations, right?

[07:21] They usually stream like a premium with Jack Danger in just like a few days.

[07:25] Now we're seeing this game for weeks and we're hearing that they might not even go on the line

[07:30] until November.

[07:31] And so it's a long wait.

[07:33] This is going to be a really interesting gap because most of us out there, we're not used to this.

[07:39] We're not used to distributors asking us to pay for a game we're not going to get for like a few

[07:43] months from Stern.

[07:44] Stern has usually made it so that the Ellie buyers have their machines within two months.

[07:50] Not sure that's going to be the case.

[07:52] But there's just so much like back and forth discussion around these games.

[07:56] And what we don't know is how do the games shoot?

[07:59] We don't know if the games are going to be that much fun.

[08:02] We don't know how the games are coded.

[08:03] We don't know much about the game.

[08:06] We've been looking at the mechs.

[08:07] We've been looking at the artwork.

[08:09] But pinball is a kinetic experience.

[08:13] It's a game in motion.

[08:15] It's a game in which hardware and software really need to talk to each other in the right way to make it special.

[08:21] And I think this game, look, I do think this game is going to be a really cool game.

[08:26] I do.

[08:26] I think when we see the mechanisms like in those trailer videos, the reason why they're

[08:31] underwhelming is they're not accompanied by like the mode in the game.

[08:36] They're not accompanied by any music or call outs.

[08:38] And so I think when that stuff actually happens in gameplay itself, it's going to be a lot more exciting.

[08:45] But right now, right?

[08:46] Right now on this Monday morning, there's just something about this James Bond reveal

[08:51] that has me feeling just a little bit like all I want to tell each and every one of you

[08:57] is just be patient.

[08:59] We really need to see a lot more before we emotionally make any of these declarative statements.

[09:05] But there is one statement that I do agree with that these games are getting much too expensive for what you're getting.

[09:13] And I think everybody would most likely agree with that.

[09:16] You know, why would we want these things to be more money?

[09:19] Why?

[09:20] Why would anyone root for these things to be more money?

[09:23] We're not investors in Stern pinball.

[09:25] We're not going to see a cut of this if these games keep going up and up in price.

[09:30] But the market is spoken, everybody.

[09:32] The market is spoken and the demand for James Bond at $13,000 is sky high.

[09:38] I use this analogy on one of my Facebook lives.

[09:41] I said, look, I do OK for myself in my career and I can buy the most expensive pinball machine in the world.

[09:47] Like I could easily buy the most expensive pinball machine in the world.

[09:51] And so could you for the most part, right?

[09:53] Can I buy the most expensive watch in the world?

[09:56] I can't.

[09:57] Can I buy the most expensive car?

[09:59] Nope.

[09:59] The most expensive house?

[10:01] Nope.

[10:01] The most expensive artwork?

[10:02] Nope.

[10:03] The most expensive bottle of wine?

[10:05] Nope.

[10:05] The most expensive sneakers?

[10:07] Well, maybe sneakers, but I wouldn't want to.

[10:09] I mean, who'd want to drop like $100,000 on sneakers?

[10:12] But my point is this.

[10:14] As a niche hobby, while pinball is a lot more expensive than it used to be,

[10:20] it's still so much more accessible and approachable than so many other hobbies that people are into.

[10:28] Then so many other collector spaces people are into.

[10:32] Can I buy the most expensive video game?

[10:35] Nope.

[10:35] The most expensive video game sold for like $3 million.

[10:38] You know, a sealed Super Mario Brothers or something like that.

[10:41] And that's my point is while it was nice all those years we were buying these stern machines

[10:47] for what now seem like a wholesale price, we are never going back.

[10:52] And I don't think the world economy is going to change anything.

[10:56] I think for people who buy pinball machines,

[10:59] nothing that happens out in the real world is affecting the money that they use for the most part

[11:06] to buy these machines.

[11:07] And so this is it.

[11:09] This is just the new norm.

[11:10] Like a year from now, we will probably be like, oh, you remember the good old days when stern

[11:14] LEDs were $13,000?

[11:17] But I don't lose sleep over it.

[11:18] I wouldn't run the pin side and be so upset about it because I would just decide for myself personally,

[11:25] now that everything is this much money, the only way I would ever buy a machine when it first comes

[11:31] out is if I absolutely loved it and needed to have it now.

[11:36] And it was a theme in which I absolutely needed the Ellie of it.

[11:40] Because why else would you buy one right now?

[11:43] The other versions of the games will go down in price over time.

[11:48] And we all know the dirty little secret about collecting pinball machines.

[11:52] It's that most pinball collectors don't even play their games very much.

[11:57] So when you buy it used, it will ostensibly still be a brand new pinball machine.

[12:04] And you'll save yourself a bunch of money.

[12:06] The other thing is this, there are so many games coming out.

[12:09] This isn't the end.

[12:10] This isn't the last machine that you got to go all in on.

[12:14] If you like the 1960s James Bond franchise, by all means, I think you're going to want this game.

[12:19] It's not a dream theme for me.

[12:21] I mean, I was born in 1976.

[12:23] So like James Bond, Sean Connery isn't really my jam.

[12:27] My mom loves Sean Connery and so does my dad.

[12:30] But this isn't a dream theme for me.

[12:32] Now if they came out with like fifth element or they came out with top gun or they came out with G1

[12:39] Transformers, the movie or Big Trouble in Little China or Akira, yes, then I would be all in on

[12:45] whatever Stern would want for that LE.

[12:48] Well, anything south of maybe, I don't know, 20 grand.

[12:51] And this is why people, everything about pinball is just an emotional decision.

[12:56] None of what we're doing here, none of it.

[12:57] None of it is rational and no rational way can you ever really justify that any of us

[13:02] need stuff like this.

[13:03] You don't need it.

[13:04] And for most of you out there who already have a lot of really great pinball machines,

[13:09] how can you even rationalize that you need any more?

[13:13] I understand like bar operators like John and Jack Bar, like it makes sense that John would

[13:18] want every new game because he could rationalize it, that brand new games bring people into my bar.

[13:25] And that's my livelihood.

[13:26] It makes sense for distributors to want to sell you every new game because that's how they make

[13:31] their livelihood.

[13:32] But I think for a lot of us out there, yes, you're going to slow down a little bit.

[13:35] You're going to pump the brakes.

[13:37] You just can't own every machine that comes out.

[13:41] You just can't, you can't cycle these games through your house anymore the way you used

[13:46] to like five years ago.

[13:48] And guess what?

[13:49] I think everyone will easily adjust to that new way of experiencing pinball.

[13:54] I also think for a lot of us out there, we're going to go play pinball on location more.

[13:59] And that's a good thing.

[14:00] It's really actually much more fun if you ask me to take 50 bucks and enjoy James Bond versus

[14:07] spending $15,000 and having it in my house every single day in which, you know, everyone's

[14:13] going to put less than 200 plays on it before they sell it.

[14:16] So just, I think everyone just needs to chill out a little bit.

[14:19] I think everybody will.

[14:20] I think Pinside sometimes paints a picture that's not totally accurate.

[14:25] I think a lot of us have more balanced lives and we don't overinvest in every new thing that

[14:30] happens in pinball.

[14:31] All right.

[14:31] So speaking of new things that have happened in pinball, there's not too much news,

[14:35] but at the tailgating party, the coin taker tailgating party with the super awesome pinball

[14:40] show, I am hearing that Christopher Franci showed some people.

[14:44] I think it was the speaker panel artwork on the new game coming out from AP.

[14:49] I believe it is going to be called galactic tank force.

[14:53] And I'm hearing the artwork is like this 1950s sort of throwback fun, campy sort of sci-fi

[14:59] meets pinball awesomeness meets Dennis Norman's ramps meets tanks.

[15:04] And here's what I heard.

[15:05] I heard the artwork is absolutely incredible.

[15:09] I heard what people saw like blew them away.

[15:12] I also heard that some people were shown some populated playfield images and I'm hearing it's

[15:18] got some crazy Dennis Norman ramps, some really fun mechs and the game itself is absolutely gorgeous.

[15:27] If you like attack from Mars on crack, you're going to love this game is what I'm hearing.

[15:32] I'm also hearing that Christopher Franci redesigned the American pinball logo,

[15:37] which is good.

[15:37] The original was designed by John Papadook.

[15:40] So it's a good thing they redesigned it.

[15:43] And best news, I heard they now redesign the cabinets.

[15:47] So we're no longer going to get those like ugly, squirrely, like back box cabinets.

[15:52] I think they're going to put this into a much more attractive looking package.

[15:57] The other part I heard was that the game was most likely going to be on the line in December.

[16:02] So does that mean we will see it at pinball expo at the end of October?

[16:06] Or does it mean it's a little bit delayed?

[16:09] Obviously there's still delays with every single major pinball company.

[16:14] So I don't know.

[16:15] I don't even know if they've built all the legends of the Hollas.

[16:19] So is this game ready for the line or do they need to finish making those games first?

[16:24] I'm excited to see this game.

[16:25] You know, it's going to take a lot to find buyers when you're making an original IP game.

[16:31] But Dennis Nordman is an amazing designer.

[16:34] Christopher Franci is an amazing artist.

[16:37] And could this be the American pinball game we've been waiting for?

[16:41] Could this be that beautiful game that shoots like butter,

[16:45] that has fun toys, that is super sexy and doesn't stand out like a sore thumb when you look at the

[16:52] cabinet in a lineup, right?

[16:54] The old AP games just didn't look good in a lineup compared to Stern and JJP.

[16:59] I'm really happy that this game is going to mix things up a little bit.

[17:03] American pinball does build a good game.

[17:05] So the quality is there.

[17:07] So I think a lot of people, especially with the sticker shock happening over at Stern

[17:12] and the sticker shock over at JJP.

[17:14] I think a lot of people are starting to get a little bit frozen in this hobby and they're

[17:19] going to wait for something unique.

[17:21] Here's where I think American pinball.

[17:23] I'm going to give David Fix the best advice ever.

[17:25] Here's where I think American pinball can win.

[17:28] I do think they need to limit the number of games they're going to make.

[17:31] And I think they should just make a thousand and that's it.

[17:35] And make these really awesome, quirky and different and unique games that are just unique,

[17:42] right? Because every single game that JJP makes and Stern makes,

[17:46] they're going to make thousands of them, like thousands of them.

[17:49] Like none of them are super rare, right?

[17:51] All the rarity is just arbitrary with like the plaques other than the, you know,

[17:54] the L-1 one, which is 500.

[17:56] We'll see where that one goes.

[17:57] But I would say, look, we're going to make a thousand Galactic Tank Force games

[18:01] and then move on to another game.

[18:03] Like just do that.

[18:04] And I think if they do that and they price it right,

[18:08] I do think they can find buyers for this game.

[18:10] I don't think it's going to be dead on arrival.

[18:12] I really don't.

[18:13] This isn't home pin.

[18:15] Dennis Nordman knows how to make great games.

[18:18] Christopher Franci knows how to make a work of art.

[18:20] And I think if you put those two things together,

[18:23] I do think now that this is going to be the game that completely erases

[18:28] what American pinball has done in the past.

[18:30] And if they were smart, stop making Houdini's Oktoberfest,

[18:34] stop looking towards the past, give us new stuff.

[18:38] All right, everybody.

[18:39] So look, that's really it.

[18:40] There's not much else going on.

[18:43] I think everyone just needs to take a deep breath, be patient,

[18:47] don't rush in unless you absolutely have to have that LE.

[18:51] And you'll be much happier.

[18:53] We all know this.

[18:54] Like if you turn off pin side for like a few weeks,

[18:57] you'll probably be a lot happier than if you stay in these threads

[19:01] where there's so much negativity.

[19:03] Thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[19:05] There's a lot more news coming,

[19:07] but there's not much happening right now.

[19:09] We're just waiting to see if this James Bond game

[19:12] is going to live up to all the Bond fanatics hype.

[19:15] And I'm interested.

[19:16] I can't wait to see this game in motion.

[19:18] Like, like, are there going to be clips?

[19:20] Like, how the call-out's going to be?

[19:21] Like, did they get Sean Connery for anything before he passed away?

[19:24] Like, all of this stuff, all of these question marks,

[19:27] like, what's the code going to be?

[19:29] Like, is that rocket going to be rewarding or annoying?

[19:32] Like, there's a lot left on this game.

[19:35] And we're going to hear and see all of it very soon.

[19:38] We're also going to see this Keith Owen game real soon.

[19:40] Is it going to be worth it?

[19:41] Because if there's not that much in the game,

[19:45] I just can't see people spending $20,000 plus when there's 500 of them.

[19:51] People that never used to be a super LE number.

[19:54] That used to be just the basic numbers of LEs they may.

[19:57] Now it's like this super limited to 500.

[20:01] But I get it.

[20:02] It's only one version of the game.

[20:04] There's no other version.

[20:05] So this is probably one of the most limited games Stern has ever made.

[20:10] But man, I just can't see anything north of like $12,000

[20:14] when I look at that package on that 60th anniversary version.

[20:18] Everybody, have a great day.

[20:19] We'll talk to you soon.

[20:34] I want to be with you everywhere.
