[00:00] I love the girl, man.

[00:04] And say you've got a broken heart.

[00:10] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to a late night edition of Canatus Pimball podcast.

[00:15] Bubba's trying to sleep. Baby Killian. Brenda. They're all trying to get some Z's right now.

[00:21] It's 11.02 in New York City. And I've got nothing better to do than to give you

[00:28] some Pimball rumors about Brian Eddie and Keith LWIN's next game. This is the kind of stuff you're

[00:35] not really going to hear on other shows. Now I know these are just rumors, so take this with a grain

[00:41] of salt, but these are coming to me from some very decent sources. And the reason why I like doing

[00:49] this stuff is you've been following Canatus Pimball podcast over the years and it's fun to get

[00:54] excited about these games. It's fun to close your eyes and imagine what can be in these games.

[01:00] For some reason we're never really satisfied with the games we have today. We're never really

[01:06] satisfied with the current inventory in Pimball. Almost all of you out there suffer from the same

[01:13] thing I do. We somehow think that the greatest Pimball machine that will ever come out is the one

[01:20] that's coming out tomorrow. It's not one that is currently available and it's not one from years

[01:27] ago. Now speaking of games from years ago and then I'll get to the rumors and the things you really

[01:32] want to hear. I put up an image on my Facebook page today that really showcases the reality of the

[01:39] Pimball world, the Pimball manufacturers and the Pimball marketplace. And this image captures

[01:45] all of the different Pimball machines that have shipped since the year 2015. So six years in the

[01:52] Pimball hobby. And what I did was I showcased how many games came out from each manufacturer

[02:00] between 2015 and today. Now here's the crazy part. I'm going to read for you the total number of

[02:08] games that have shipped from each manufacturer. And we're going to go from the worst to the best.

[02:15] I think that's the best way to do it. Okay, we're going to start with Deeproot Pimball. Over the last

[02:20] five or six years, Deeproot Pimball has shipped zero games. Now don't forget that Deeproot Pimball once

[02:28] said that they were going to ship more games in one year than every manufacturer combined. Let's

[02:35] remember that. The next on our list is Zidware Zero Games since 2015. Skit B zero games. Now I know

[02:43] two games went out that were prototypes of Predator, but zero games. We then have circus Maximus

[02:50] zero games. They still have not shipped Pimball circus and they still have not shipped King Pim. We

[02:55] then have team Pimball who made the Mafia game. They have shipped one game. I think they made like

[03:01] 10 of them and they went out of business. We then have Pimball adventures with the punny factory.

[03:06] I'm not even sure if they've shipped that game yet, but they've revealed it. But we'll count that. I

[03:10] don't think. And I think they're also going to sell just one game. So who knows who's going to buy

[03:15] that product? We then have Suncoast Pimball who made Cosmic Carnival one game, one game and Cosmic

[03:21] Carnival then closed its doors. Haggis Pimball one game, Celts. Pimball Brothers has shipped an

[03:29] alien to Coin takers. So we're going to count Pimball Brothers with one game, Home Pin, one game has

[03:35] shipped Thunderbirds. Dutch Pimball one game over the six year period, Big Lebowski, Highway Pimball,

[03:43] two games went out the door, Alien and Fault Rado, P3 Multimorphic. I think I have to add one here

[03:50] because I had three games for them, Lexi Light Speed, Cosmic, Cart Racing and Heist. But I think

[03:55] also the Canon Lagoon game was also another modular thing that they could put in. But also,

[04:02] these are just the top one third of the game. So I don't consider each one of those to be

[04:07] shipping an entirely new game, but we'll give it to them. We then have American Pimball with three

[04:13] games since 2015, Houdini, Octoberfest and Hot Wheels, Chicago gaming company, just three games as well

[04:21] with Monster Bash, Medieval Madness and Attack from Mars, Jersey Jack Pimball with five games since

[04:27] 2015, Hobbit Dialding, Pirates of the Caribbean, Willy Wonka and Guns and Roses, and even topping them

[04:35] is Spooky Pimball since 2015. The Tiny Little Boutique company from Benton, Wisconsin is the second

[04:45] most efficient Pimball company in the world. Let me repeat that. The Tiny Little Company from Benton

[04:54] , Wisconsin is the number two most efficient Pimball manufacturer since 2015. Now they have shipped

[05:03] Domino's, Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper, the Jetsons, TNA and Rick and Morty with six games. Now I know what

[05:10] you're saying right now. I know what you're saying. It's a little bit skewed because Jersey Jack and

[05:15] Chicago gaming company have them beat on number of games shipped. So take it for what it's worth in

[05:22] terms of total games though that have been designed, put in a box and sent to customers Spooky Pimball

[05:30] actually tops JJP. Now six is the second most efficient in terms of number of games. How many games

[05:38] do you think Stern Pimball has shipped to customers new in box and this is not even taking into

[05:44] consideration all the different vaults and reruns. It's also not taking into consideration that they

[05:50] have you know three models for each game. The number of games that Stern Pimball has shipped to

[05:55] customers since 2015 is 28 games. 28 and I'm not going to read them all for you but 28 games. Talk

[06:07] about absolute Pimball world domination. The market share they have they're in a completely different

[06:15] universe than everybody else and the other thing is when you put up Stern's themes against

[06:21] everybody else in Pimball. That is where they also just clobber everybody. I mean just looking at it

[06:28] you're seeing Jurassic Park, Stranger Things, Ninja Turtles, Beatles, Supreme, Iron Maiden, Star Wars,

[06:37] Batman, Ghostbusters, Kiss, Game of Thrones, WWE, Guardians of the Galaxy. It is absolutely

[06:46] incredible how much variety they have over at Stern. And if you've been following Pimball for

[06:54] the last six years, Stern Pimball is going to give themes to people of all age groups,

[07:00] all demographics and all interest and passion points. I mean absolutely incredible. Now I would

[07:07] say this that quantity does not equal quality and I would argue that even though Stern has

[07:15] made 28 games, they have not made 28 masterpieces. They have barely made any masterpieces amongst those

[07:23] 28 games. Other companies like Jersey Jack Pimball, like Spooky, like Chicago Gaming Company,

[07:30] like American Pimball. Those companies can focus all of their efforts each year on just one title,

[07:38] on just one title where Stern is doing four or five or six games a year that they're manufacturing.

[07:45] Imagine if the talent and the resources over at Stern all got together and worked collectively

[07:52] on just one major Pimball launch a year. Now they would never do that. Nothing they're doing

[07:59] from a financial standpoint is incorrect. They are clobbering the market. They are making so

[08:05] much money. But unfortunately their success and their efficiencies has also led to a product which

[08:12] isn't really pushing the envelope, which isn't really trying to innovate. I mean here we are.

[08:18] It is March of 2021 and with all of this success, with all of this money, how is it that we still

[08:26] do not have internet connectivity amongst any of these companies games other than P3 multi-morphic

[08:33] right now other than Jersey Jack Pimball with Wi-Fi downloadable code and scorebit tracking of your

[08:39] game progress. That's all we've got. I can't play against people on a Jersey Jack machine.

[08:45] I can't play against people on anyone else's machine other than P3 but hardly anybody has P3

[08:51] so no one's really playing against each other on the P3. How amazing would it have been if Ninja

[08:56] Turtles was connected and you and three friends out there in the world who all had the game could

[09:01] go on at the same time and have a Ninja Turtles experience. So this is the thing about this stat

[09:07] and this data. Is Wall Stern is clobbering everybody? If you were to ask me who's making the greatest

[09:15] masterpieces in Pimball that is a much more interesting topic to debate and we will do it at a

[09:22] later date. Now this is a good segue to the rumors I'm hearing about Brian Eddie and Keith Lwynn

[09:28] because as I've been saying Stern Pimball year after year has continued to improve. They

[09:35] listen to the feedback. They know what people are saying as much as Gary and the investors are

[09:41] making so much money. Down on the design floor. Down at the level in which these games are being made

[09:47] the teams that are making these games. They want to make the best Pimball possible. I absolutely believe

[09:54] that. I absolutely believe that the design teams and the people making these Pimball machines

[09:59] over at Stern are fighting senior management to get more into the games and I'm here to tell you

[10:06] right now you're about to get a Stern machine unlike any other. There is a Stern machine that is going

[10:14] to come out this year that is going to be the most ambitious, the most innovative and the most

[10:21] far reaching and probably the biggest risk Stern has done in a long time because if there's one

[10:28] thing this company hasn't really done a lot of it hasn't really pushed the envelope mechanically

[10:35] in their games and whenever they try to do new things mechanically that is usually where Stern falls

[10:42] down and so what have they done as a company right I think they hide a lot of the lack of mechanical

[10:47] stuff in their games they hide a lot of that by putting a lot of beautiful artwork on their games

[10:53] right zombie yeties our packages are incredible there's so much detail but then you kind of step back

[10:57] and you realize well there's not a lot in the game though like where's the mechanisms where's

[11:02] the movement where's the magic that's physical under the glass not just the beautiful art but the

[11:09] physical world and I'm here to tell you right now the game is going to come out in this year that you

[11:15] are going to want to be on the list for it you're going to want to be telling your distributor tomorrow

[11:20] hey put me down for this game it's going to be a game that's going to sell out in just a few

[11:26] hours because if what I'm hearing about this game is accurate it is going to be the most ambitious

[11:31] Stern machine maybe of all time okay how's that for lowering expectations for you guys out there

[11:37] okay so let's start with the two things I'm talking about today Brian Eddie and Keith Owlin now we'll

[11:42] start with Brian Eddie Brian Eddie is next up at the plate for Stern Pimball Brian Eddie's title will

[11:49] most likely be revealed in April which is next month now Stern is backlogged on orders so it

[11:57] might be April but it might also be May and knowing Stern it may even slip to June but I fully

[12:04] expect to see it sometime in April now I've been unsuccessful in trying to get the title and the

[12:11] theme which I know is the main thing you want that is always the main thing people want what is

[12:16] it going to be is it going to be a theme I want do I want to hold off on buying any machine right

[12:21] now because that's the theme that I've been waiting for what we know about it is this and I've said

[12:27] it before it's a contemporary theme and what I mean by that it's not an nostalgic title it's not

[12:34] something from the 60s from the 70s from the 80s maybe from the 90s I don't think so I'm hearing

[12:41] it's a contemporary title and what my source is telling me is that means it's something newish

[12:47] and it's also something that's kind of a geek property I got confirmation that it is not

[12:53] it is not going to be a music pin so that is music to everybody's ears before I go on to the last

[13:00] bit of information I have about Brian Eddie's new title that I think is going to excite all of you

[13:06] let's for a moment just try and think what could it be what could be a contemporary theme that geeks

[13:13] that's not nostalgic but has some contemporary value and a lot of people are into and also my

[13:20] source said Chris you're going to want it which is like great great then what is it I know it's not

[13:26] the justice league because I threw that out there and he's like nobody likes the justice league

[13:30] and he's probably right get prepared ladies and gentlemen for four hours of a stinking

[13:35] turd in Zack Snyder's justice league movie it's going to be horrible it's absolutely going to bomb

[13:41] they're taking a horrible movie and they're trying to make it better it's going to still be horrible

[13:45] the one that everyone wants it to be the one that everybody wants it to be and we know they have

[13:51] a partnership with Disney we know they want it to be the Mandalorian I mean this is the one

[13:57] everybody wants Mando and baby Yoda and Boba Fett that show is the number one show streaming right

[14:06] now everybody wants Mandalorian now I definitely think Mandalorian is coming but I have a hard

[14:13] time believing this is going to be the Mandalorian I just I just don't picture being the Mandalorian

[14:18] so what else could it be we know that he just did stranger things which is a Netflix show and if

[14:25] they have a partnership with Netflix what show is popping on Netflix right now that might make sense

[14:31] for a contemporary newish theme that I would want to own is it Cobra Kai can you consider Cobra Kai

[14:39] to be contemporary it is from the 80s but Cobra Kai is the contemporary reinterpretation

[14:47] of that franchise now the problem is I just don't think Cobra Kai would make for a good pinball

[14:52] machine I don't want a Cobra Kai pinball machine if I were to choose I would want a pinball machine

[14:58] that is based on the original karate kid movie and not Cobra Kai so what about the other older

[15:04] theme that has a contemporary version coming out what about Maverick top gun is about to come

[15:12] into theaters do you think it will be that I don't think it will be Maverick top gun simply because

[15:18] Maverick the movie is not even coming out until July 4th I think so there's no way the pinball

[15:24] machine would scoop it starting to feel like we're running out of options with Brian Eddie here

[15:29] now what about this I know that Brian Eddie is a really big car enthusiast do you think

[15:35] it could finally be the most popular automotive franchise in the history of automotive franchises

[15:43] and we know pinball people love their carguments what about the fast and the furious could Brian

[15:50] Eddie be working on a fast and the furious pinball machine for some of you out there you're

[15:55] probably like no please don't be fast and the furious and I'm here to tell you to I don't

[16:01] really want a fast and the furious pinball machine because there's like nine movies and I don't

[16:07] know how you would do it all and it's almost like that franchise went through so many different

[16:12] crazy sort of films to the point where they're like jumping cars out of buildings it just got so

[16:18] out of control the first one is the iconic one and then I I loved like five and six

[16:25] a Tokyo drift is is also really cool but you know what I mean it's like I don't need a fast

[16:30] and the furious pinball machine now I think that franchise is sort of exhausted there is also

[16:37] a new James Bond movie coming out right around the corner now we've been hearing James Bond for

[16:42] a very long time so could this be the new Daniel Craig James Bond movie in pinball form I again

[16:49] I highly doubt it and I'll tell you why when I looked at those five years of stern releases I have

[16:56] not seen a single stern release that has been synced up with a single new movie they don't do it

[17:03] like this anymore stern doesn't want to do it like that you know why because they don't want to spend

[17:07] the money to work on a game privately behind closed doors and pay for all the assets and all the

[17:13] actors to contribute stuff they don't want to have to do that so I don't think we're going to see

[17:19] any brand new movie in stern pinball format that syncs up with the film itself so I guess my takeaway

[17:26] on all of this if I were to hope and wish and dream it could be one thing the franchise that is

[17:34] contemporary it's not too throwback there's a new one coming out and it would be completely awesome

[17:41] if they did this and it's never been done before so it might be a great way to remind people of

[17:46] the first three versions of this franchise if canadie could have his dream with zombie Eddie on art

[17:52] that's the other part I am hearing zombie Eddie is the artist would be making the matrix so I don't

[18:00] know if that's going to come true but that would be my dream so here's the other part I know about

[18:04] the brine Eddie game that's about to come out we heard a lot of complaints with stranger things

[18:10] and I know some of you out there are now saying stranger things is a great game and I'm here to tell

[18:15] all of you who feel that way from the rest of us in the community we don't care we don't care

[18:21] that you're enjoying it we don't care that it has that one more play field to it we don't care

[18:26] that every time you go on pinside you have to remind us that your stranger things gets the most

[18:32] place in your game room that's not going to change people's point of view on the game I'm sorry

[18:38] it's just not the game was a miss for what could have been stranger things this game does not

[18:45] create the magic of that show it just doesn't it just doesn't so here's the thing though the real

[18:50] complaint was that brine Eddie was just doing another fan layout he's used a fan layout successfully

[18:57] with medieval madness and attack from Mars and we got another sort of like fan layout in

[19:02] stranger things now I'm here to tell you on canadus pinball podcast and I'm not using the word

[19:07] exclusive anymore I said this on my Facebook post today I think all the pinball media we need to

[19:12] just stop and I see it on other shows and I see it all over the place we've got the exclusive

[19:17] this the exclusive that the exclusive of this the video of alien this that let's all just stop

[19:22] for a minute and realize we're all just a bunch of losers talking about pinball and telling people

[19:29] out there the two to three thousand people that actually care out of the eight billion people on

[19:33] the planet some little tidbit about pinball and can we stop trying to make it sound like oh we've

[19:39] got the exclusive and look I could get real boastful and say oh this is an exclusive rumor of stuff

[19:44] I'm hearing I don't care it's not it's not this is just something fun that I think you'll enjoy

[19:49] and I think you'll enjoy chewing on this this bit of information so the rumor I'm hearing it's not

[19:54] a fan layout I'm hearing that brine Eddie heard that feedback I'm hearing that brine Eddie is going

[20:01] to go and make a game that is going to be much more reminiscent and much more the style of from a

[20:08] design standpoint of the shadow so go google image search brine Eddie's this shadow and you're

[20:17] going to see a game that's going to look more like that and less like a fan layout I'm also hearing

[20:22] the game will have an upper play field I don't know if the upper play field will be like the shadows

[20:28] upper play field but look for a upper play field both in the premium and Ellie version of brine

[20:35] Eddie's next title I'm really looking forward to brine Eddie's next game he's still one of the

[20:40] greatest pinball designers ever he sort of took it on the chin with stranger things his come back

[20:46] to pinball was not the glorious return that he probably thought it would be but I really do think

[20:52] that what he comes out with next could really be something very exciting and awesome and I think

[20:58] people are going to maybe sleep on it so we'll see what happens with that title now brine Eddie's

[21:04] game is next I am not sure if john borg follows him which would make sense if you think about it

[21:11] it went stranger things ninja turtles and then avengers so what is the order going to be this time

[21:19] is it going to be brine Eddie and then john borg or will it be brine Eddie and then Keith Lwynn

[21:28] now I have absolutely no clue what john borg is working on the game I was describing earlier

[21:35] on this podcast the most ambitious game that is going on at stern pinball right now right fully

[21:41] so is being designed by Keith Lwynn and can you blame stern for bringing out the checkbook for

[21:48] Keith Lwynn Keith Lwynn has turned stern pinball around he has he's turned this company around and

[21:55] delivered games that brought fresh new thinking to stern pinball his approach to design we finally

[22:02] got games that just were designed with more creativity and even though iron maiden was a re-skin of

[22:09] archer it still just felt new it felt different it was refreshing for everybody to jump on that game

[22:15] and play a stern that didn't play similar to so many other sterns out there and stern had

[22:21] gotten into a point where so many other designers were just cookie cuttering their ideas over and

[22:26] over and over again and so Keith Lwynn was like the new guy who wanted to make a name for himself

[22:32] and then he follows up iron maiden with Jurassic Park I believe both of these games won game of the

[22:38] year when they were up for twippies I believe so so he's two for two in game of the year the guys

[22:44] on a roll he then follows up Jurassic Park with avengers I don't think avengers is going to win

[22:50] game of the year it's gonna lose out to guns and roses I believe and it should lose to guns and

[22:54] roses because guns are roses is more than just another pin it it is just a masterpiece like no

[23:00] other music pin we've ever seen in the history of pinball it's not to take anything away from

[23:04] avengers but I think you all would agree that avengers is a really really good pin it's a very very

[23:10] solid effort but guns and roses is a game changer on so many levels but there's no denying the fact

[23:16] that Keith Lwynn games are the stern machines that people anticipate with the most excitement his

[23:23] games have sold very well he's got a huge following in the community to the point where you can't

[23:28] even say anything bad about a Keith Lwynn game now leave it to canada to do that so I'll share a

[23:34] little bit of feedback that people tell me about Keith Lwynn games because you can't air this

[23:38] up on pinside you can never say it publicly but I'll say it because people already hate me enough

[23:44] the one big drawback that I hear about Keith Lwynn games they're too hard to progress through the

[23:50] games because he's such a good player his games are almost designed around his skill set and making

[23:56] it so it's hard to get to the end with the player of his ability and then you add in guys like

[24:02] Raymond Davis and doing the code on these things and all of a sudden you realize you're never ever

[24:07] ever gonna get past a certain point in these games unlike a lime and sheets who knows how to

[24:13] code a game like Batman where even if you're not one of the best players in the world you will

[24:19] see it all if you play it long enough and there's just enough difficulty to get to the things that

[24:25] are very exciting so that's the one knock I hear on Keith is that sometimes he just makes these

[24:30] games where most players out there will hit a wall they'll get frustrated they can't get past that

[24:36] wall in terms of their progress and then they kind of want to get on with the game and move onto

[24:42] something else so here's what I'm hearing about this Keith Lwynn game that is going to be one of

[24:47] the most ambitious games in the history of Stern Pimball so first and foremost I'm hearing the

[24:52] theme is Godzilla it's almost like this is one of the worst kept secrets in all the Pimball that is

[24:57] the rumor but I am hearing from so many people every time I attribute Godzilla to somebody else

[25:04] people hit me up and say no it's Keith Lwynn and every time I say Keith Lwynn is working on something

[25:09] other than Godzilla people hit me up and say no it's Godzilla so whoever is out there in the

[25:15] Stern world who's working on this Godzilla project with Keith Lwynn someone's talk someone has

[25:21] let people know what's going on with this game and I also think someone has probably shown someone

[25:27] some of the stuff in the game or at least described it because I'm about to give you because I'm

[25:33] about to give you right now what I am hearing and this is a rumor and I know Zach Sharp right now

[25:39] is like what the hell is he gonna say this is how this is how you win twippies you talk about stuff

[25:45] like this for all you out there who want to win a twippy in the Pimball podcasting world you've got

[25:50] to talk about this kind of stuff every once in a while and get the people excited see I don't think

[25:55] this is going to harm anything with the game I don't think it's going to ruin anything they reveal

[25:59] because it's Godzilla we know it's Godzilla okay so here is what I'm hearing about this game here

[26:04] the rumors and this is why I'm so excited and I think you're gonna be so excited so first and

[26:09] foremost in Keith Lwynn's Godzilla rumor number one you are going to play as Godzilla Godzilla is the

[26:18] player so what does that mean if you're playing as Godzilla well first I hope with everyone who buys a

[26:26] limited edition version of this game I hope Stern is listening to me right now Stern marketing

[26:32] department if you play this game as Godzilla please package with every L.E. a Godzilla costume

[26:40] so people can wear it as they play the game think of all the great social content you will get

[26:47] Stern with all of your fans dressed up as Godzilla playing Godzilla Pimball okay I don't know if

[26:54] that's happening that's just canada giving them a free idea that will actually make owning these

[26:59] games even more fun okay so you're playing as Godzilla so now that you know that is the structure

[27:06] of this game then you can start to think about the realities of what could be under glass and here is

[27:13] the rumor I am hearing the second rumor I'm hearing about this Godzilla game is that it is going to

[27:20] have a mechanism like we haven't seen before in a Stern machine that rises up out of the playfield

[27:28] and I heard that it might rise up multiple times all a doctor who not sure if that part is right

[27:35] but we are going to see a mechanism rise from underneath the playfield and it is not going to be a

[27:42] crappy spinner that rises up so what could that be in the world of Godzilla what could rise up from

[27:51] underneath the ground it's not Godzilla because remember your Godzilla but also some of the other

[27:57] Godzilla monsters that are in the universe this is rumor number three that you are going to be

[28:03] physically battling the monsters of the Godzilla universe in this game so I know for a fact rumor

[28:10] number four I keep saying fact but this is rumor rumor number four is this number four I don't know

[28:14] is that mecha Godzilla will be in the game so fully expect if your Godzilla under the glass will be

[28:21] physical monsters that you will be battling one of which will be mecha Godzilla there will be

[28:27] something amazingly mechanical that rises up from underneath the playfield their other rumor I'm

[28:33] hearing is there are going to be elements in this game and things in this game that can give the

[28:39] ball a crazy amount of pathways to go down so we are going to see a game that's not just going to

[28:47] be a static layout design like there is going to be something that manipulates the pathway of the

[28:53] ball how exciting does that sound I kind of get this visual of of of Tokyo or a city in these

[29:00] monsters and you've got to go different pathways to battle these different monsters and like mecha

[29:05] Godzilla I'm not even going to try to pronounce the Godzilla monster names because I don't really know

[29:12] too well the other rumor I'm hearing and again this sort of leads me to believe it is like a city

[29:17] that is like under destruction because that is so much of the Godzilla universe is this city like

[29:23] crumbling around you as these megabees battle it out I'm hearing that in the Godzilla game there's

[29:30] going to be a bridge ramp that breaks that isn't crappy like the one in the old Avengers game

[29:37] that's another thing I'm hearing in this title so these are the rumors I'm hearing on this game

[29:42] now these are all just rumors and I know that people are going to run the pin side and say

[29:47] came from canada and he's full of sh it all but this is a rumor but this is coming from a very very

[29:53] good source the things that I'm certain about is the big mech lifting up the bridge that breaks

[30:00] the different pathways the ball can go battling mecha Godzilla and battling the monsters all of that

[30:06] I'm certain about if you're Godzilla or not I'm not 100% sure about that but that seems to be

[30:12] the logical way to approach this game you as the player assume the role of Godzilla make sense

[30:18] so when is Godzilla coming out well they're gonna miss the window which would have been great

[30:22] right now because we've got the King Kong versus Godzilla movie which is coming out like any

[30:27] week but I would expect to see this game same time as Avengers sometime August September maybe

[30:35] it will be the end of the year stern highlight title because if what they're trying to do in this

[30:41] game is what I'm hearing it is going to be the most mechanically complex game stern is done in a

[30:47] really long time we know that stern does not do mechanical complexities very often and we do

[30:54] know that they don't do them very well so I hope if this thing is true and what I'm hearing is true

[31:01] I hope that stern is actually taking adequate time to quality test this product because the last

[31:08] thing I would hate for them to do is create this epic Godzilla world under glass game that everyone's

[31:15] gonna want and they don't properly test it and then people get the game and there's a bunch of

[31:21] mechanical headaches with the game stern are you listening to me send one to canada I promise I

[31:29] won't leak any photos and you know I'm probably the best pinball quality tester on the planet I'll

[31:36] put it through its paces you can trust me I'll let you know everything that's wrong with this game

[31:40] that's what I do best right kid it is the one who lets every pinball company know what they're

[31:45] doing wrong so super exciting I think stern's gonna have a juggernaut year as you can tell by the

[31:51] numbers I talked about earlier it doesn't matter this company is the Godzilla of pinball they have

[31:58] stomped on every single pinball company in the last like 20 years nobody's even touched them stern

[32:06] is killing everybody killing everybody there are no pinball companies out there that they're worried

[32:12] about nobody's making them feel any dent in their wallet I think stern is probably feeling some

[32:18] of the pressure when they see games like guns and roses I bet they go into their design room and

[32:24] they say well why can't we do something that shows everybody in the world what we're capable of

[32:31] and that's really all I want from stern pinball moving forward I don't need all of your games to be

[32:36] great I don't need all of your games to be masterpieces but when it comes down to its stern at least

[32:43] once a year you should create a game that is a level above anything you've ever done before and

[32:50] you should continue to show us what your talented people over there are capable of when I see the

[32:58] design sketches that George Gomez has done over the years I'm in awe of the talent of that man

[33:04] I'm in awe of the talent in that building but the truth is George and the truth is stern pinball

[33:11] you have not unshackled your talented people you haven't you haven't shown us a game recently

[33:19] that's the best of what all of you could do and I'm hoping Godzilla is that game and I'm hoping

[33:26] that moving forward at least once a year stern says let's raise the bar again it's not only about

[33:34] the money stern you've made enough money now's the time to at least make masterpieces this is your

[33:42] legacy this isn't gonna last forever people the economy's not gonna be this good forever people

[33:48] are not gonna be making money on bitcoin and game stop and AMC shares forever those of you out there

[33:54] you're not gonna have your health forever you're not gonna have time in your life to play pinball

[33:59] forever life is short the time we have on this planet is very short I'll never understand why

[34:06] people need like 30 40 50 pinball machines or in their collections I don't get it you only have

[34:12] a certain amount of time when you're playing pinball you can't possibly play all these games you

[34:16] can't possibly have all this time for me personally give me four to five pinball masterpieces

[34:24] based upon themes I love and that's all I need and if other great masterpieces come out great I'll

[34:31] go to a friend's house and play him or find a bar to play them I don't need to own them all I'm

[34:36] not as rich as some of you I don't have room like a lot of you but that's my thing I want games like

[34:42] guns and roses I want Godzilla to be the next guns and roses I want stern pinball to give us

[34:48] Harry Potter or back to the future in a way that blows us away because that's when pinball gets fun

[34:53] and when you make these masterpieces you know the other thing that happens and I've noticed this

[34:58] when you put all these boutique companies to the side all the ones that have ripped people off all

[35:04] the ones that have created all the drama when you forget about them all right let's say the other

[35:09] thing I didn't mention guess how many pinball companies have tried to make pinball games over the

[35:14] last five years or six years 18 let me repeat that 18 companies have thrown their hat into the pinball

[35:24] ring 18 of which only four to five have delivered customer games on time and out of those how many

[35:32] have been masterpieces well the list gets really short so I want masterpieces because the other

[35:38] thing that happens when we forget about these failed boutiques and we forget about all the

[35:43] pinside moaning and groaning all you rich guys out there that have to tear each other's heads off

[35:48] you know who you are you sound stupid doing it all the time every day what is this this is the

[35:52] best thing you can do with your time is go on the pinside every day and argue about pinball stupid

[35:57] stupid use of time when you make a masterpiece game here's what happens there's no drama there's no

[36:03] arguing there's no fighting there's no calling it stupid people are not going on the pinside saying

[36:09] Adam's family sucks going on the pinside saying medieval madness sucks they're not going on the

[36:14] pinside saying tales of the Arabian night sucks they're not doing it because when you make

[36:18] again that's a masterpiece we celebrate it and I want more games to be masterpieces and they

[36:24] should be because these prices are so high when you make games this expensive there's no room for

[36:31] mediocrity and I know this is not the popular stance by some of the other people out there who

[36:36] make content who just want to celebrate everything that's going on in pinball but I do think we need

[36:40] voices like canadas that's going to tell you if we're not aiming for the stars if we're not aiming

[36:46] to make pinball masterpieces what the hell are we doing here I mean stern pinball has 17 other

[36:53] companies that are trying to make pinball machines use 17 companies that were out there why did you

[36:58] even bother unless you could make a masterpiece what did you think was going to happen that someone

[37:04] was not going to buy Star Wars and was going to go buy like Thunderbirds no the only way you should

[37:11] jump into the ring is if you have a masterpiece in mind okay this has been episode 565 of canadas

[37:18] pinball podcast I don't know how many shows I'm going to do I know I keep doing them because I
