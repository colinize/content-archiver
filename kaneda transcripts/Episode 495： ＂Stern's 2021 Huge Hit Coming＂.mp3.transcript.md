[00:00] Welcome to episode 495 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that doesn't

[00:23] need stupid segments.

[00:25] We don't need stupid puppet pals.

[00:27] We don't need to jump the shark and try a million different ways to serve you up pinball

[00:31] content.

[00:32] We just tell you the pinball news you want to hear.

[00:35] On this episode, we are going to reveal, and I think confirm for you, the big stern title

[00:43] or one of the big stern titles of 2021.

[00:46] Now I have inside information that this title is confirmed.

[00:51] It's coming out.

[00:52] Now I will present it as a rumor because I haven't seen it.

[00:55] But my sources on this one are very, very tight.

[00:59] So I'm going to present it as a rumor.

[01:02] But I think you should believe this rumor.

[01:04] So you're going to have to wait to hear that in a little bit.

[01:07] But before we reveal, the stern title coming out that I hear is like the first title of 2021.

[01:13] And I'm going to speculate on it a little bit when you hear what it is.

[01:17] And I think I might, I don't know, I'm going to tell you what I think about it.

[01:21] But before we do that, what else is going on in pinball?

[01:24] So tomorrow you should check out the dead flip stream of American pinball's Hot Wheels

[01:30] game.

[01:31] Now there's a great deep dive on the Hot Wheels game over at this weekend pinball.

[01:36] So I recommend you check it out.

[01:38] It seems like there's a lot of lights in this game.

[01:41] And the modes are really interesting.

[01:43] I think they're going to make this game deep.

[01:46] We will see how this game shoots tomorrow.

[01:49] So I'm going to keep an open mind.

[01:51] Now I am hearing stuff from other people out there about the state of American pinball.

[01:57] And I keep hearing the same thing that they're really cheap.

[02:00] Even though they have money, they don't want to spend money, that they don't listen to advice.

[02:05] They don't take feedback from the distributors and from the community very well.

[02:10] So I read someone say like it's great to see American pinball firing on all cylinders.

[02:16] And I'm like, what are you talking about?

[02:19] This company again, I give them so much crap because as I said on the Poor Man's pinball

[02:25] podcast, I believe in American pinball.

[02:27] I just think they need to get the right management in place and get the right visionaries over

[02:33] there.

[02:34] And this company should be cranking out games that are as good if not better than stern

[02:38] machines.

[02:39] They should be cranking out amazing pinball by now.

[02:42] You don't get like three to four chances at the plate without a home run.

[02:46] So will Hot Wheels be that home run?

[02:48] I don't know.

[02:49] I don't know.

[02:50] The game I bet is going to be fun to shoot.

[02:52] I bet it's going to be fast.

[02:54] It's going to be very colorful.

[02:56] The light show looks amazing, but I still think it falls a little bit short, a little bit

[03:01] short in bringing the Hot Wheels world to life, especially because Hot Wheels has such

[03:06] iconic things that could have made it in to the pinball experience.

[03:10] But we'll see.

[03:11] We'll see.

[03:12] We're going to keep an open mind and see tomorrow more about that game.

[03:15] The other thing that happened at American pinball is they fired Jim Pat Law.

[03:20] Now Jim has a history in pinball.

[03:22] We talked about Jim being hired over there at American pinball and he was supposed to

[03:26] be like their new George Gomez.

[03:28] So what does it mean that Jim Pat Law was let go at American pinball?

[03:32] I believe it was last Friday.

[03:34] And so this again, just to me highlights that American pinball is bringing in industry

[03:41] veterans.

[03:42] So I've been in this industry for decades and those people are being shown the door.

[03:46] So I really just I won't have full faith in AP until they put someone in charge who

[03:53] knows what they're doing.

[03:55] And they've got all this money, but they just don't have the right leadership and they

[04:00] don't have the right vision.

[04:02] And I think until they get those people in place, we're still going to see this company

[04:07] no pun intended spin its wheels.

[04:09] Okay.

[04:10] What else is going on in pinball?

[04:12] So instead of buying pinball machines as investments, I saw this in the news today.

[04:16] There is a pinball painting and I forget the artist's name, but it's going up for auction.

[04:21] It's a guy who paints everyday items like cake and cupcakes and he painted a painting

[04:26] called I think it's called for pinball machines.

[04:29] It's sold in 1981.

[04:31] I want to say it's sold in 1981.

[04:34] I think it was for a hundred and like eighty three thousand dollars in 1981.

[04:39] It is about to hit the Christie's auction block and is expected to bring twenty four million

[04:46] dollars for a painting of four pinball machines.

[04:51] So let's cry about six hundred dollar toppers a little bit more ladies and gentlemen.

[04:55] No, I think we're finally done with the DLC topper conversation.

[05:00] Ultimately, if you think there's value there and you want it, go ahead and buy it.

[05:06] No one's going to stop you.

[05:07] Nobody really cares.

[05:09] It's not that nice of a topper anyway.

[05:11] It's not even that nice of a mode anyway.

[05:13] And you know how I feel about it.

[05:15] I think it's the wrong move for pinball and I think for an Ellie buyer, he should get

[05:19] everything in that game for the amount of money.

[05:22] And I'm so tired of people saying, you know, I just want to support Stern.

[05:25] I want to keep Stern in business.

[05:27] Stern is in business.

[05:29] Stern is making so much money.

[05:30] You want to know why because all of you people, you have to, I don't understand what people

[05:34] can't comprehend this.

[05:36] You are buying machines that only cost them like $3,000 to make.

[05:41] They are selling these machines for double, double and a half and triple what it cost

[05:46] them to make the game.

[05:48] So just buying the machine, buying the machine should get you all of that stuff.

[05:54] Okay, it shouldn't be additional and they are, they are very, very financially healthy

[06:00] because of how much money they're charging for a product that they're not spending that

[06:05] much to make.

[06:06] And if you don't believe that, then I don't know what to tell you.

[06:09] It's like when people, and I saw someone say this, like spooky gave people free toppers

[06:13] on Rick and Morty.

[06:14] Yeah, but Rick and Morty is pretty expensive for a spooky machine.

[06:17] So you pay for it.

[06:18] You're paying for it when you drop $7,500 on a Rick and Morty.

[06:22] Okay.

[06:23] Now, I've had Rick and Morty for an entire week.

[06:26] I know I shared some images of dimples in the game and people are like, Chris, you're

[06:30] a hypocrite.

[06:31] You, someone said you slander the other companies by saying that spooky machines are, are better

[06:37] than stern machines in play field quality.

[06:39] And I want to tell you people out there, like yes, was I wrong that there are no dimples

[06:44] on a spooky machine?

[06:45] Absolutely.

[06:46] And I take full responsibility for being wrong on that notion.

[06:50] Now, is this machine much nicer than the stern machines after a few hundred plays?

[06:55] And I went back to Jack Barr.

[06:57] I looked at it next to their stranger things because I think that's a good indication of

[07:01] what a machine will look like after a lot of plays.

[07:04] And so yes, the spooky quality is far better.

[07:07] It's far better.

[07:08] And I know the debate rages on on like if you want a game with no dimples, you can go

[07:13] cruise men for $700.

[07:15] Now keep in mind, I asked spooky about this.

[07:17] It takes 14 weeks to get it.

[07:19] It's $700.

[07:21] And for some reason, it voids your warranty with spooky pimple.

[07:25] But sure why that would void the warranty adding a different clear coat process.

[07:30] But that's what it does.

[07:32] I think they are maybe trying to persuade people not to go that route.

[07:36] It's probably a little bit of a headache for them to do it.

[07:40] But it's nice that they will allow you to do it.

[07:42] I won't lie.

[07:43] I won't lie.

[07:44] If I was getting my Guns and Roses collector's edition and the option was there to have

[07:48] cruise men do the play field for $700, I would do it.

[07:53] I didn't do it on Rick and Morty because I don't know this game's a keeper.

[07:55] I'm still getting used to it.

[07:57] And it's a lot of money.

[07:58] It's a lot of money.

[07:59] I didn't want to spend that much money on a game right away.

[08:03] Now and look, you can always get a spare play field clear coated by cruise men if it means

[08:08] that much to you.

[08:09] But I am.

[08:10] I'm serious.

[08:11] I am trying to shed the OCD behavior in my mind and just enjoy these games.

[08:18] It's a process.

[08:19] Being OCD is a little bit of a disease that those of us who have it, we fight against

[08:25] it every day.

[08:26] But you know what I'm talking about, right?

[08:28] You get like a few dimples on a game or you have a little nick in your cabinet and every

[08:32] time you walk by your machine, you look at it.

[08:35] You stare at it.

[08:36] Everyone else you know won't even notice it.

[08:38] But you notice it.

[08:40] It's like a tiny little ding on your car.

[08:42] You just, you can't get over it.

[08:44] And there's just something about getting over it.

[08:47] But it's easier to work on your mind sometimes than to spend so much money trying to keep things

[08:52] perfect.

[08:53] But look, I think the game is great.

[08:55] I'll tell you this.

[08:56] My only complaints about Rick and Morty so far have been having to adjust the scoop.

[09:01] I think I got it to the right place.

[09:04] I wish they gave a bubble leveler on the game so that if you're setting it up to six

[09:09] and a half degrees, you know, I had more, you know, the levelers I have, they don't tell

[09:13] you the degrees.

[09:14] I had to buy a digital one, but why not just put that little bubble on the right side?

[09:19] I think that's something they should do in games moving forward.

[09:22] The other big thing I think spooky needs to do in this game.

[09:26] And otherwise I love the package.

[09:27] They need to tilt the screen.

[09:30] So for some reason they have the screen like completely perpendicular.

[09:34] Like it's just straight up.

[09:36] And by doing that, when you look, when you're standing and playing the game, it really

[09:40] washes out the LCD.

[09:42] Like black.

[09:43] Let no black when you look at the screen.

[09:47] All the black turns to like a light gray.

[09:49] Now if you bend down and you put your chin on the lockdown bar and you look at the screen,

[09:55] it turns to black.

[09:56] And so they really need to figure out a way to angle it the way Stern does and angle it

[10:01] up so that when you're standing at the pinball height to play, it really makes the LCD look

[10:08] the best.

[10:09] And the colors have the best contrast.

[10:11] And right now it really is washed out and it's a little bit of a shame because the colors

[10:15] in the cartoon are so vibrant and you really want that contrast and you don't get it.

[10:21] And so I think that's something that spooky should work on.

[10:25] I'm not sure if there's a way to mod the game to angle it back more.

[10:28] I don't think so.

[10:29] And the other thing too is the speaker lights, the speaker lights reflect so badly into the

[10:36] game.

[10:37] Even with I have PDI glass, the best non reflective glass, even with that, the speaker lights,

[10:42] they just appear like these hovering lights over the upper left and upper right side of

[10:48] the game.

[10:49] I look, those are minor things, but those are things I think spooky should work on.

[10:52] Otherwise I really am loving this game.

[10:54] And what I really do love about this game is the way they're coding it.

[10:58] And I will say this, it reminds me a lot of Batman and I mean it in this way.

[11:02] This game doesn't have like a lot of like amazing shots.

[11:06] They're not amazing shots.

[11:08] They're fun shots.

[11:09] They're shots that you have to learn.

[11:12] They're rewarding when you combo them up.

[11:13] My favorite is backhanding the right ramp, having the ball come around and then immediately

[11:19] hitting the left ramp.

[11:20] When you can do that one, two punch and you start an adventure that way as you get through

[11:25] the adventure cards, it's so rewarding.

[11:28] But it's also so damn hard.

[11:30] Like it's so hard.

[11:31] And in Batman, you could go back and forth between those two ramps and combo them so nicely.

[11:36] I do wish Scott would have made it a little bit easier.

[11:40] And I mean it's a little bit easier to have a few more combos in this game.

[11:44] And I think that's just going to come with time.

[11:46] It's going to come with patience.

[11:48] It's going to come with studying really how to make a game flow better.

[11:52] And I mean that.

[11:53] I mean that.

[11:54] And it's constructive criticism.

[11:55] This game would be more fun if it were easier to hit some of these combos and they weren't

[12:00] so damn difficult.

[12:01] And I know I can already hear some of the people who are always making apology for Scott.

[12:07] It comes with experience.

[12:09] Making a game where combos are so rewarding is a skill set.

[12:13] And I think Scott should have made some of it a little bit easier to hit.

[12:17] Now that being said, when you do hit it, it's a ton of fun.

[12:21] And the jury's still out on whether or not over time, I will learn these shots more.

[12:26] The issue I always have.

[12:27] And I'm just going to say this is always my issue.

[12:30] When you're playing a game and you're learning the shots, here's what always happens to me

[12:33] in Pimball and it probably happens to you.

[12:35] You get in a group.

[12:36] You get in a rhythm.

[12:37] You learn the shots.

[12:38] You learn the shots.

[12:39] And you're hitting the shots in the first 15, 20 minutes of playing.

[12:42] But something happens in a Pimball machine.

[12:45] And as you're playing, the more you're playing, I always feel like the coils lose a little

[12:49] strength.

[12:50] And so then as you're playing or if the game's been on for a while, you then don't have

[12:54] as much zip on the coils and on the flippers as you did when you started.

[12:59] So then where the shots are on the flipper might change a little bit.

[13:04] And so the near timing has to adjust as the machine is adjusting a little bit.

[13:09] The power that's going through it is that maybe I'm just making that up.

[13:13] But that's how I feel things happen when I play Pimball.

[13:16] And over time, if you're playing in an hour or two hours, you know, the game starts to

[13:21] adjust a little bit and you have to adjust with it.

[13:24] That being said, my favorite part of this game is the coding.

[13:27] Like I said, it's like Batman because while the shots are not the most amazing, the code

[13:32] is incredible.

[13:33] The theme integration is incredible.

[13:35] The callouts are better than Batman.

[13:37] The modes are more fun than Batman.

[13:39] They just are.

[13:40] There's so much variety.

[13:42] My favorite thing they did in this game is when you start an adventure and then you go

[13:47] into a dimension.

[13:49] That is where the secret sauce of why this game is so magical comes to life.

[13:54] When you start, I love it when you start like an adventure like Roy and then you go into

[13:59] a dimension.

[14:00] That's like human music.

[14:01] I like it.

[14:02] And they're just like this weird beep sound like beep beep.

[14:04] And it's like so then all the Roy music stops.

[14:07] You just hear the dimension beep, but all the callouts are the same as the adventure would

[14:13] normally roll out.

[14:14] And it's like, it's just so fun because you just, you just can start to see all the different

[14:19] combinations that they can put into this game.

[14:22] And it's still very early on.

[14:24] There still needs to be a lot more adventures added, a lot more dimensions added.

[14:29] Like there's dimensions where it just all farting noises, dimensions where every switch

[14:33] is a scream.

[14:35] And it's going on in conjunction with the normal adventure.

[14:39] And I just love that.

[14:40] That combination of adventures and dimensions is really what's going to separate this

[14:45] game from what I think is any other pinball machine in the way it's coded and the experience

[14:51] you get playing it.

[14:52] And that's why I think people are going to find this game to be extremely, extremely rewarding.

[14:58] Even though it has frustrating shots, even though there's some clonkiness, even though

[15:02] it has some things you just have to learn to live with like the scoop up, I think it's

[15:07] that all that stuff is going to be a distant memory when people see the way they brought

[15:12] the Rick and Morty world to life in this game.

[15:15] And it's already super, super impressive.

[15:19] And we know that they're going to keep coding this thing to make it one of the most memorable

[15:23] coded games of all time.

[15:26] And I mean that like I played Batman, I played Walking Dead, but you know, Lyman Sheets

[15:30] is incredible.

[15:31] But what they're doing in this game, I think is even more creative and hasn't really

[15:36] been done in a pinball game before.

[15:39] And I'm not just saying that because I own it.

[15:41] It really is a unique pinball experience that I think you're going to have a lot of fun

[15:46] with.

[15:47] Okay.

[15:48] So what else is going on in pinball?

[15:49] So remember when I told you that Jersey Jack pinball was no longer Jersey Jacks, well

[15:54] it hasn't been Jersey Jacks for a really long time.

[15:56] And now we have sort of confirmation that the owner of Jersey Jack pinball, haven't listened

[16:02] to it yet.

[16:03] Someone just sent me this.

[16:04] The owner of Jersey Jack pinball is Brett Abyss.

[16:07] So Leonard Abyss's son is the owner of Jersey Jack pinball.

[16:12] It must be nice.

[16:13] I mean, I won't lie.

[16:14] I wish my dad was a billionaire.

[16:16] I wish my dad could buy me a pinball company.

[16:18] And I wish I could own a pinball company in which none of it happened because of me.

[16:24] It just happened because of my money.

[16:26] Now look, we live in a world of nepotism.

[16:28] We live in a world of favoritism.

[16:30] We live in a world of privilege.

[16:32] I mean, it's kind of ironic in the middle of all of what's going on in the world.

[16:36] I mean, this is the epitome of privilege.

[16:38] Is it not?

[16:39] But it's okay.

[16:40] Like, I don't fault people for being successful.

[16:42] I don't fault people for working hard.

[16:45] I don't fault people for making a lot of money.

[16:48] We're also living in a weird time now where there's a lot of accusatory fingers being pointed

[16:53] at everybody.

[16:54] I'll say this.

[16:56] If you said something stupid on Twitter in 2012, you better go find it and erase it because

[17:02] you might be fired today.

[17:04] I mean, there is a witch hunt going on in culture right now like I've never seen before.

[17:10] What makes me a little bit sad is that we are living in a world.

[17:13] And it's a weird thing.

[17:14] It's an ironic thing.

[17:15] We have one side of society asking for empathy, asking for learning and asking for understanding.

[17:22] And I fully agree with that.

[17:24] But we also can't live in a world where if you make a mistake or you say something stupid

[17:28] like eight years ago and someone records it that eight years later, when you might have

[17:34] a family, when you might have kids, when you might have a career that you really need,

[17:38] when you might, when you might have changed as a human being and learned from your mistakes,

[17:43] that eight years later, something you said stupidly when you were drunk on social media,

[17:50] eight years ago, will now come back and just ruin your entire life.

[17:55] And there's no forgiveness.

[17:57] There's no understanding.

[17:58] There's no listening.

[18:00] There's no nothing.

[18:01] It's just we are immediately jumping to being an executioner of people.

[18:06] And it sucks because you know, like I get it.

[18:07] We're trying to weed out the bad seeds, the Harvey Weinstein's, the races, the bigots,

[18:12] the sexes.

[18:13] I get it.

[18:14] But in the process of going after them, right?

[18:16] A lot of people who just made a silly mistake are going to be casualties of this witch hunt

[18:22] in society.

[18:23] All I'm going to say is this, I think people need to be forgiven at times.

[18:28] I think people need to have empathy, but it goes both ways.

[18:32] You can't ask people to have empathy over here, but then not apply empathy to them as

[18:37] they're trying to explain to you the transformation they went through.

[18:41] Because if you want people to learn and you want to change people's minds, you have to

[18:45] accept the fact that not everybody has started off thinking the way you do.

[18:52] And that's the issue I have is the extremists.

[18:55] And it's usually on the far left.

[18:57] They don't want to accept the fact that you might have thought differently than them.

[19:03] And if you ever thought differently from them, they will crucify you immediately.

[19:08] Okay, now don't get me started on the far right there.

[19:10] Just as crazy.

[19:11] They're just as crazy.

[19:12] Get all those rebel flags off of all those cars.

[19:14] No more number of jokes of hazards pin is in the works.

[19:17] All right, let me go back to Pimble.

[19:19] That was enough of the soapbox from Canada.

[19:20] So he owns the company now.

[19:23] It is Brett Abbas's company.

[19:25] He owns the company now.

[19:26] There's a podcast.

[19:27] I'm going to listen to it.

[19:28] Now speaking of Jersey Jack Pimble, I got someone in my inbox yesterday who said, guns and

[19:33] roses is going to be revealed next week.

[19:35] And I heard from a distributor that it's going to be revealed next week.

[19:38] Okay, so you know, I love it.

[19:39] I love it when people test Canada.

[19:42] And people know I have the guns and roses images.

[19:44] And people keep asking me, when are we going to see guns and roses?

[19:47] And I'm here to tell you right now, guns and roses is nowhere near the line.

[19:52] It's not going to be revealed next week.

[19:54] It's not going to ship in July.

[19:56] And I shared on my Facebook page today exclusive images of inside the Jersey Jack Pimble factory

[20:03] inside the factory this week.

[20:06] Go there to my Facebook page and you can see those images.

[20:09] They are nowhere near.

[20:11] They are nowhere near getting guns and roses on the line.

[20:14] And before they get guns and roses on the line, they have to finish building the remaining

[20:20] willy-wanker orders.

[20:22] Now you have to understand this.

[20:24] Some people might say like, oh well, you know, wonka sales have dried up.

[20:27] There's no more wonka.

[20:28] No, no, no, it doesn't work like that.

[20:29] Jersey Jack Pimble ordered all these wonka parts.

[20:32] Jersey Jack Pimble has all these wonka parts.

[20:35] Jersey Jack Pimble needs to run and make all those wonka games, put them in boxes and make

[20:40] them.

[20:41] That's how it works.

[20:42] The wonka line still needs to finish what the wonka production was supposed to be.

[20:47] And then they'll move on to guns and roses.

[20:49] But I think it's safe to say that you are not going to see guns and roses next week.

[20:53] I doubt if you'll see it anytime soon.

[20:56] If they show you it, looking at where the line is right now, if they show you guns and roses

[21:02] any time in the next few weeks, I don't know.

[21:04] I hope they don't show it too early.

[21:07] This line is, they haven't even set it up for wonka yet.

[21:10] So it's basically a skeleton line right now with none of the stuff on it yet.

[21:16] Now look, I still think we're going to see G&R by August, but I don't expect it before

[21:21] then.

[21:22] I could see it in August and I can see the game shipping by October.

[21:26] That is my prediction of guns and roses, but I'm not, I know the original plan was to

[21:32] have the game on the line in July, originally, originally, originally.

[21:35] If you go all the way back, because I've been talking to people over there, this game

[21:38] was supposed to ship November of 2019, okay?

[21:42] So take that for what you will.

[21:44] But again, nothing's ever delayed if you've never given a release date.

[21:48] So without a release date, guns and roses is not delayed.

[21:51] Toy Story is not delayed.

[21:52] They never said it would be out on a date.

[21:55] So you have to cut them some slack.

[21:57] Now it does, it does make this teaser campaign seem a little misguided or ill timed or confusing

[22:06] if you will.

[22:07] Now I don't pretend to understand what goes on inside the heads of pinball marketers,

[22:12] like Zach Sharp, we got Michael Granite AP, Ken Cromwell over at JJP.

[22:17] I'm not quite sure how these guys do what they do.

[22:21] I'm not quite sure there are backgrounds in marketing.

[22:23] I'm not quite sure they understand how marketing fully works.

[22:27] They really, they haven't, you gotta remember, these guys have not had experience with product

[22:31] launches.

[22:32] They have not had experience with product rollouts.

[22:36] They've only had experience as consumers and fans of pinball.

[22:40] I'm telling you, those are two separate things.

[22:43] Those are two separate things and there is a skill set to how you launch a product.

[22:47] There is.

[22:48] And stern pinball thinks they know it all but they don't either.

[22:51] Like they really don't.

[22:52] Like stern just thinks like if we reveal and ship and have it in our caves on one day,

[22:57] that's the best you can do.

[22:58] It's not.

[22:59] That's not the best you can do in drumming up hype.

[23:02] That's not.

[23:03] Do you think Hollywood does that?

[23:04] Or video game councils do that?

[23:05] Or video games do that?

[23:06] You think they, they don't even tell you what the title is until the day it's out?

[23:09] No, they don't do it that way.

[23:11] The only reason pinball does it that way is they don't want you to know what's next.

[23:16] They don't want you to know what's in the lineup coming up because they don't want you

[23:19] to hold your money and wait for the next game.

[23:22] Now unfortunately for stern pinball, I'm gonna tell you what's coming out from this company

[23:27] in 2021 and it's gonna make you wanna maybe hold on to your money and it might make some

[23:32] of you not wanna buy an interturtles and that's why they don't do it.

[23:35] But unfortunately, canada exists.

[23:38] Any spoils their plans once again.

[23:41] Now go call up your PR agency, Zach Sharp and get them to try to take down this entire

[23:45] show.

[23:46] Nothing you can do, my man.

[23:48] Nothing you can do.

[23:49] Freedom of speech, Zach.

[23:50] Freedom of speech.

[23:51] You're in the wrong job, man.

[23:52] I get you love pinball.

[23:54] I get your family as pinball royalty.

[23:56] But you're in the wrong job if you're trying to like ban people from talking about your

[24:01] products.

[24:02] It's just not the way it works, man.

[24:03] It's pinball.

[24:04] You gotta lighten up.

[24:05] I'm always gonna have the scoop, man, because people like you guys are in, you're so far

[24:11] in front, you're so far in front and people give you so much money, you don't deserve to

[24:15] be cranky.

[24:16] You gotta play that.

[24:17] If you smiled when you played that Ninja Turtles act, I would have been so much different

[24:23] in my approach.

[24:24] But you couldn't even muster a smile to play a Ninja Turtles game.

[24:29] If that makes you upset, man, I'd hate to see you on like the walking dead.

[24:34] There's something with some serious subject matter.

[24:37] He's so upset with the most jovial game on the planet.

[24:40] I don't get it.

[24:41] Lighten up, bro.

[24:42] It's just pinball.

[24:43] Alright, what else is going on before we tell you the stern title?

[24:46] I'm trying to think we got a P-covered.

[24:48] Dutch pinball is sending people their games.

[24:51] We've got Jersey Jack covered for now.

[24:53] Oh, let's see.

[24:55] There's my computer chiming.

[24:57] Alright, I wanna read some one person's feedback as I said I put it on air, because he emailed

[25:03] me on my Facebook and he said, you delete it my comment.

[25:06] And I had explained to him that when you send Kaneda a message on his Facebook page, it

[25:11] doesn't delete it.

[25:13] Your comment doesn't go up on my main page.

[25:16] That's so people just can't flood my page with whatever is in their mind.

[25:21] So let me read this for you.

[25:23] And I wanna respond to it.

[25:24] And then I'm going to tell you what stern title is coming out in 2021.

[25:31] And I heard it's in Q1 and I heard it's one of their cornerstone titles.

[25:35] So let me read this.

[25:36] Alright, so this comes from Joseph Bauer and he says, hello, I'm really enjoying your

[25:41] podcast.

[25:42] It is like you say, people listen to it because you are the only one who is also pointing

[25:48] things out.

[25:49] What are not so cool.

[25:50] I'm listening to every show.

[25:52] Well thanks, Joseph.

[25:53] I think the puppet pals, I think the puppet pals is gonna also do that.

[25:56] I can't wait.

[25:57] I can't wait.

[25:58] First we had Macho and now we have puppet pals.

[26:00] But finally, seeing you setting up a pinball machine and making all those newbie mistakes,

[26:06] like it's your first machine calling the support more than once for things Google and

[26:12] Pinside could easily help you out.

[26:16] Seems really strange to me.

[26:17] Alright, I'm gonna stop there, Joseph.

[26:18] So when I set up my machine, here are the things that I was doing.

[26:23] I was trying to level it and I was using a digital leveler yesterday and I haven't used

[26:29] a digital leveler in a game before because I haven't had to because every game I've owned

[26:35] since I've been in pinball has had the bubble on the shooter lane and you can just put the

[26:41] bubble where it needs to be and that's a lot easier.

[26:44] Now, I also think doing the digital leveler, Joseph, is like a little awkward because I

[26:50] got one measurement between the flippers.

[26:52] I got another measurement in the middle of the play field and another measurement at

[26:56] the top of the play field.

[26:57] So yeah, I mean, I am a newbie when it comes to using a digital leveler on a pinball machine,

[27:03] so I'll give you that.

[27:04] But the other stuff in terms of the scoop rejects, in terms of some of the issues I was having

[27:09] with the game, I'm telling you, there was nothing on Pinside that really was going in depth

[27:14] into the scoop rejects and the conversation I started around the scoop reject was honest

[27:20] and once I started saying it and people started sharing photos, what happened?

[27:25] People started discussing it more because not many games are out there and I think I've

[27:29] done a fair job of highlighting an issue that every owner is going to face along with the

[27:34] dimples as well.

[27:35] Okay, he goes on to say, you have all this nice political inside info, know all those

[27:41] famous pin guys and don't know how to set up a game and you are often very critical of

[27:46] things just because you have no experience or simply don't know better.

[27:51] But after learning it, you do at least admit you are wrong.

[27:55] If you don't know about certain things, it is okay.

[27:58] But then also act like it and get information experience before you judge.

[28:03] It's your big mouth negative prejustice.

[28:06] I don't like, I think it means prejudice or prejustice, I don't know.

[28:10] Just think of all the drama we went through listening to your opinion on dimples, spooky,

[28:15] scot denisi argument, bad shots, bad scoop, ball guide fix, scoop fix.

[28:21] So much was unnecessary in the end.

[28:24] You just could have done some research and don't piss off people and make them friends

[28:29] again afterwards.

[28:31] But I guess that's also your business model.

[28:34] I agree with most things you say, but the way we get there, er, I'm playing pinball for

[28:39] just a year now, that's me being critical Joseph.

[28:42] Well, Joseph, first of all, thank you for the note.

[28:44] I appreciate it.

[28:45] I really do.

[28:46] And first thank you for listening.

[28:47] I'm glad you choose Canadian pinball podcasts.

[28:49] And look, the way I do my show and I do a lot of research, my man.

[28:53] And it's not my business model because I don't make much money doing this.

[28:57] If you knew how much time I put into researching this stuff, finding information for you guys

[29:03] that no one else has, talking to people on a daily basis to stay in the loop.

[29:07] And then if you saw what I make on my Patreon account, which is hardly anything, 200 bucks

[29:13] maybe a month for all the work I do, a month, a month for all the hours I put into this

[29:19] show, I make almost double that in hour in terms of what we build out to clients in hour.

[29:25] So one month of pinball podcasting, I, one hour of my real job is like two months I get

[29:31] paid for in pinball podcasting world.

[29:33] Okay, so when I do my show, I do it to the best of my ability.

[29:37] And there might be things that I get wrong.

[29:39] There might be things I get right, but I'm not going to go chasing down people for answers

[29:44] all the time.

[29:45] I'm not going to stop saying what I'm feeling until I hear back from somebody.

[29:49] So for example, when I said Scott Denise, he shots were like really bad on the upper

[29:54] loop on Rick and Morty.

[29:56] What did they do?

[29:57] They went and fixed it and we talked about it.

[29:58] But I wasn't going to, here's what I was not going to do.

[30:00] I wasn't going to go play Rick and Morty at Jack Bar, have that experience, have the

[30:05] ball reject a lot, and then not do a show.

[30:08] And then let me go email Scott.

[30:09] Let me see.

[30:10] Like, no, that's not when I'm not in the business of doing that.

[30:14] I will report my experiences.

[30:17] And yes, they listened to it and they fixed the issue and now it's better.

[30:20] You know, no one thanks canada for getting that fixed on at the factory, but Hilton wasn't

[30:25] talking about it.

[30:26] More games would have went out without that fix.

[30:29] Nobody gives me much thanks for getting Jersey Jack Pimball to hit pause on the line and

[30:33] getting people better play field qualities because I was the only podcast that hit that

[30:38] drum over and over and over again.

[30:39] And it was because of this show and people cancelling orders that made them stop and fix

[30:45] the issue.

[30:46] Okay?

[30:47] Now look, that's the thing Joseph is like, I'm going to win some, I'm going to lose some.

[30:52] But whatever I focus on and whatever I highlight, trust me, like I'm doing it with the best

[30:57] interest of the customer in mind.

[30:59] I'm not doing it to make friends with the manufacturers.

[31:02] I could care less about making friends with the manufacturers.

[31:07] What I want to do is give you the Pimball customer that spends a lot of money, all the information

[31:12] you need to make a good decision.

[31:14] I want to stand up for your rights as a Pimball buyer and I just didn't notice that happening

[31:20] in this hobby at all.

[31:21] I noticed every single show was so hell bent on just getting the manufacturers, getting

[31:27] the designers, getting the artists to come on the shows and just hype their products.

[31:33] And it was always about celebrate, celebrate, celebrate.

[31:36] But whenever there were issues, whenever there were lies, whenever companies were misleading

[31:40] people, nobody was saying anything about it.

[31:43] Nobody was saying anything about it.

[31:44] And I'm here to say, there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes in this industry that

[31:49] is important to understand.

[31:51] And it would change the way you think about companies, it would change the way you think

[31:55] about their products and it would make total sense when you start to wonder stuff like,

[31:59] well, why aren't we seeing any more buyers of the Caribbean?

[32:02] You're not going to see buyers of the Caribbean ever again, most likely.

[32:05] And if you know the story, why then you would stop asking the questions, right?

[32:08] But Joseph, I do appreciate it and I'm sorry that I went on a tirade about dimples.

[32:12] I still don't like dimples.

[32:13] I don't like them.

[32:14] I have to live with them a little bit.

[32:16] But the quality on the Rick and Morty is better than Stern.

[32:19] And the playfields at Spooky are better than Stern.

[32:22] And I think everybody will say that.

[32:24] You will not find a Rick and Morty owner to be unsatisfied with their Rick and Morty

[32:29] playfield quality, especially if that owner has some of the recent Stern launches.

[32:34] Okay, especially if it's Stranger Things, especially if you look at Ghostbusters quality or

[32:39] Batman quality.

[32:40] Okay, I think they're going to see a drastic improvement.

[32:42] All right, all right.

[32:43] The moments come.

[32:44] The moments come.

[32:46] Here is my inside source on what will be.

[32:50] One is Stern's big cornerstone games of 2021.

[32:53] Now I hear it might be the first game in 2021.

[32:57] But before I give you this theme, I want to say happy birthday to Gary Stern.

[33:01] Gary Stern turned 75 years old.

[33:05] 75 years old.

[33:06] And I want to say I know we give Stern a lot of crap, but Gary, sincerely, thank you so

[33:11] much for pushing Pimball through the dark ages, for keeping Pimball alive all these decades,

[33:18] for creating the biggest Pimball company in the world without Stern Pimball.

[33:23] And without Gary Stern and his management and his leadership, we would not have any

[33:28] of these games we enjoyed today.

[33:29] We would not have any of these podcasts we enjoyed today.

[33:33] And the Pimball landscape would be dead.

[33:35] We would all be talking about how we're restoring medieval madness for $15,000 and we'd

[33:40] be chasing old games from the 90s and older.

[33:44] So thank you, Gary.

[33:45] I sincerely made it.

[33:46] Thank you so much.

[33:47] Now I do want to give you a little bit of crap, Gary.

[33:49] We're going on Jonathan Houston's show 75 years old.

[33:54] You're the leader of the biggest Pimball company.

[33:57] You deserve to be interviewed on Canadian Pimball podcast.

[34:01] Why would you go on that?

[34:03] I can't.

[34:04] I can't.

[34:05] I'm not jealous.

[34:06] But man, you're going to, that's like, oh, but Gary, I did get you a birthday gift.

[34:10] I did get you a birthday gift.

[34:12] It's a $600 birthday card.

[34:15] And if you open it up, it sings Happy Birthday to you.

[34:18] OK, $600.

[34:19] OK, I hope you enjoy it.

[34:21] OK, all right.

[34:22] So here's the deal.

[34:23] Here's the deal.

[34:24] This game is a cornerstone title.

[34:25] Now this theme is a game that people have been asking for.

[34:29] It's a game that's been in the rumor mill.

[34:31] There's been so many themes.

[34:33] People have been throwing out there, Bill and Ted's 007.

[34:36] What's it going to be?

[34:37] We hear Godzilla is next.

[34:39] So I am hearing that.

[34:41] And again, this is a rumor.

[34:43] So don't go sending me some legal threat, Zack Sharp.

[34:45] I am hearing the rumor title that is, I'm hearing he's confirmed.

[34:49] I'm hearing they have the license.

[34:51] I'm hearing they're making it.

[34:52] I'm hearing it's the first cornerstone title of 2021.

[34:56] This theme is coming out from Stern Pimball.

[35:00] And I guess the best way to reveal it to you

[35:02] is to just play the music from the theme.

[35:05] Here we go.

[35:09] What could that be?

[35:12] I can just feel the DLC topper coming towards me.

[35:16] We're going to need a bigger topper.

[35:22] We're going to need a bigger price point for this game.

[35:26] Jody Dankberg is the biggest fan of this theme.

[35:33] Oh my god.

[35:34] Can you just pinball podcast for Twitties Common?

[35:42] You heard it here first.

[35:47] Oh, oh.

[35:52] All right.

[35:53] So yes, it is confirmed that you are going to get

[35:56] Jaws Pimball in 2021 from Stern Pimball.

[36:01] And here's what I heard.

[36:03] I heard that the deal is done.

[36:05] They're making the game.

[36:06] The game is in production or design.

[36:08] It is being designed right now.

[36:10] And they have the theme.

[36:11] Now here's how it's going to work.

[36:12] And then I'm going to speculate.

[36:14] I'm going to speculate on something.

[36:16] So you might be saying like, how are they doing Jaws?

[36:18] I keep hearing Jaws was a licensing nightmare.

[36:20] So here's what they're going to do.

[36:21] They're going to license the Jaws property.

[36:25] They're going to get access to the shark and to the name Jaws.

[36:29] But I do not believe this will be the Jaws movie.

[36:34] And they're going to get access to the Steven Spielberg film.

[36:37] Now I don't know that for a fact, but I'm hearing that

[36:40] was the workaround.

[36:41] That getting the rights to the Steven Spielberg movie

[36:43] just wasn't going to be in the cards.

[36:45] And for obvious reasons, and that's just like Jurassic Park now

[36:49] when you think about it, this is Stern's new approach.

[36:51] Let's go after a theme we know people love.

[36:54] Let's go after a theme we know has a huge fan base and following.

[36:58] And instead of spending all the money on the actors

[37:01] and the rights to use the clips, let's just make a game inspired

[37:06] by what people love and make an all new adventure.

[37:09] And it totally makes sense to do that with Jaws.

[37:12] Now would I rather have the movie absolutely

[37:14] because there have been so many Jaws movies.

[37:17] And most of them are not that good.

[37:19] It's the first movie that is the iconic movie.

[37:23] It's the first movie really is the only one worth watching.

[37:27] If that's the case, I think it obviously people want the movie, right?

[37:30] If it's just like Jurassic Park where it's inspired by the Jaws

[37:34] property, I don't think that's what people really want.

[37:36] But I don't think it's going to matter because if they make a Jaws

[37:39] Pimball machine and incorporate all the elements you love from Jaws,

[37:44] I think people are going to love it.

[37:46] And if they don't have yellow barrels as the pop bumpers,

[37:50] what are we even doing here?

[37:52] What are we even doing here making Pimball machines based

[37:55] on these properties?

[37:56] I mean, they need to have a shark pop up from underneath the playfield.

[37:59] I heard the playfield has a really intricate subway system in it,

[38:04] which makes sense.

[38:05] You're going underneath the playfield and back up.

[38:08] So that is really cool.

[38:09] So that is happening in 2021.

[38:12] Now here is where I'm going to speculate.

[38:14] And I know what you're saying, like all the disc that I'm about to say right now

[38:18] is it's pure speculation from Canada.

[38:21] I am hearing it's confirmed and it's happening.

[38:23] So if you want to wait for a Jaws Pimball machine

[38:25] and don't want to jump into what's available right now,

[38:28] go ahead and save your money.

[38:29] For a lot of you, you've got so much money, you don't even care.

[38:32] You'll just buy Rick and Morty, you'll buy Hot Wheels,

[38:34] you'll buy Ninja Turtles, you'll buy Guns and Roses,

[38:36] and then you'll buy Jaws.

[38:37] I wish I was like you, gentlemen.

[38:39] I think, and this is purely Canada.

[38:42] I think Keith L. Win is going to do Jaws.

[38:45] And I keep hearing the rumor like Keith L. Win is doing Godzilla.

[38:48] Keith L. Win's next game is Godzilla.

[38:51] I don't buy it.

[38:52] I think Keith L. Win doing Godzilla is a red herring.

[38:56] I think it's a Trojan horse.

[38:58] I think it's a leak and a lie that they put out there

[39:01] to mislead us because think about it.

[39:05] If you have Jaws, who are you gonna hand it to to do it justice?

[39:09] And you just gave Keith L. in Jurassic Park

[39:13] another similar huge movie property

[39:16] in which you're making a game inspired by the films

[39:19] that people love and he knocked it out of the park.

[39:22] And you're gonna, who are you gonna give Jaws to?

[39:24] Who are you gonna give Jaws to if not Keith L. Win?

[39:27] Is George Gomez gonna take it?

[39:29] I don't know.

[39:30] Is it gonna go to Steve Richie?

[39:31] No, because he's doing Leb Zeppelin.

[39:33] So it would make total sense that maybe there is no Keith L.

[39:38] Win Godzilla game and maybe the game

[39:40] that is next from Keith L. Win is Jaws.

[39:44] I'm completely making this up.

[39:45] This is all speculation, but it makes total sense.

[39:49] Why would Keith L. Win go from making Jurassic Park

[39:53] a movie property about a big lizard

[39:55] to another movie about a big lizard in Godzilla?

[39:58] Why not give him the other big animal

[40:01] that's under the water since he's already conquered

[40:04] the big animal on top of the land, give him Jaws.

[40:08] So that is my speculation.

[40:10] Is I think Jaws is gonna be Keith L. Win's next game.

[40:13] I think it's gonna be the first game out in 2021.

[40:17] Maybe December of 2020, but I think that is going to be

[40:21] this huge juggernaut of a theme that they wanna bring out.

[40:25] I also am gonna predict this.

[40:27] I think they're gonna try and find another artist

[40:30] similar to Franchie to bring this to life

[40:33] because Franchie's Jaws artwork is so good.

[40:36] And I don't think you want hand-drawn stylized Jaws art.

[40:39] I think you want it more Franchie style.

[40:41] So we'll see what they do, but they're gonna have,

[40:44] I think they're gonna have the theme song.

[40:46] I think they're gonna have the shark.

[40:47] I think they're gonna have the IP,

[40:49] but they're not gonna have all the actors

[40:51] that you know from the movie.

[40:53] I don't think you're gonna see Spielberg clips,

[40:55] but I still think there's so much awesome subject matter

[40:58] in Jaws that if they really do this justice,

[41:02] it could be a juggernaut for a stern pinball.

[41:06] But you know, it's stern.

[41:08] At least every time I, if you already give me a choice

[41:11] of who I want to make my dream theme game, it's not stern.

[41:15] It just isn't, it just isn't.

[41:17] I mean, imagine if you gave Eric the Jaws theme

[41:21] and look at everything he put in pirates

[41:23] and see like, hey, we wanted to make Jaws,

[41:25] like what they would put in it.

[41:27] Because the pop bumper barrels,

[41:28] they don't need to pop, how awesome would this be?

[41:31] I'm just gonna say this, how awesome would it be

[41:33] if the pop bumper barrels actually lowered

[41:35] under the play field and they popped up,

[41:38] up through the play field.

[41:39] And that's when the pop bumpers get activated

[41:41] because just like the movie, Jaws drags those barrels

[41:45] under the ocean, right?

[41:46] And they don't know where he is

[41:48] until the pop bumper pops up.

[41:49] Now, how epic would it be?

[41:51] How epic would it be if they put three pop bumpers

[41:55] in different parts of the play field

[41:57] and they popped up through the play field

[41:59] and you had to shoot them to sort of, you know, find Jaws.

[42:02] How cool would that be?

[42:03] I don't know, they're not gonna do it.

[42:04] They're not gonna do it because it's stern.

[42:06] It's gonna be the same family out, same stuff.

[42:08] They're gonna put the Ninja Turtle pizza into the Jaws

[42:10] and give, well, yeah, let's just use it.

[42:11] We have too many left over.

[42:12] Let's just use this, let's just use that.

[42:13] You know, you know, they get out the,

[42:15] is Jaws gonna swing out like ballrog

[42:17] and not be under the play field?

[42:18] He's gotta come up from underneath.

[42:19] That just has to be a requirement.

[42:22] That Jaws has to pop up from underneath the play field stern.

[42:25] You can't just have them sitting there

[42:28] always above the water, okay?

[42:30] It's Jaws.

[42:30] All right, everyone.

[42:31] That's, you're hearing here first.

[42:33] It's happening.

[42:34] Jaws is coming.

[42:35] You know, I am willing to stake again,

[42:40] my reputation, this is happening.

[42:43] You heard it here.

[42:44] Jaws is confirmed.

[42:45] Stern Pimball is doing it.

[42:46] And yes, it's a rumor.

[42:48] It's the most confirmed rumor of all time.

[42:50] That should be my new thing.

[42:51] I'm here to confirm a rumor.

[42:53] The rumor is confirmed.

[42:54] It is a rumor.

[42:55] I've confirmed that the rumor is authentic

[42:57] and the subject matter, I'm pretty sure.

[43:00] I'm 99% sure it's happening.

[43:02] And that's how they're gonna make it.

[43:03] Everybody, enjoy your Pimball machines,

[43:05] enjoy Hot Wheels tomorrow.

[43:07] Happy birthday, Gary Stern.

[43:08] And we'll be back.
