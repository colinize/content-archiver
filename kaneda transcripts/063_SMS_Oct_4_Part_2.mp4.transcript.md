[00:00] and get one.

[00:01] It's just like I want to get one.

[00:03] I don't know if they'll make another one,

[00:05] but I would just love to have it because it's different.

[00:12] It's not.

[00:15] I think this is the thing with these home-roo games

[00:17] is all this work goes into it.

[00:21] Can they find a way to make 10 of them

[00:23] or make five of them like they did

[00:24] with the Matrix that time?

[00:30] I don't know.

[00:31] I don't know.

[00:36] We're letting people come back on YouTube

[00:37] because I had to restart the YouTube

[00:38] because I hit the dam.

[00:40] I need this cable sucks.

[00:41] I'm gonna order one right now.

[00:44] I'm gonna order one right now

[00:45] because this cable being busted continues to annoy me.

[00:48] Let me just order it right now.

[00:53] Sure USB mic cable.

[01:01] All right.

[01:05] All right.

[01:12] All right.

[01:20] Okay.

[01:23] I should have done this week to go by now.

[01:28] Oh my God.

[01:29] The fact that you have to sign in with five things now

[01:32] is so annoying.

[01:36] Now I gotta take a picture of this thing

[01:37] to what happened to the world?

[01:42] Picture.

[01:44] Then it's gonna make me sign in on my phone.

[01:55] All right.

[01:56] Place my order.

[01:58] Give me my name, my name, Mike.

[02:01] All right.

[02:02] It's coming tomorrow.

[02:11] All right.

[02:13] Let's share a screen.

[02:18] Okay.

[02:22] So I'm looking at the game.

[02:26] I'm trying to stay away from this cable.

[02:27] So I don't have to do this again.

[02:32] No, I would like, I wanna play this game.

[02:40] First glance at it.

[02:45] I like the low pan down in the corner.

[02:48] Or I mean the middle.

[02:50] I like, I mean, the overall vibe of this game is super fun.

[02:58] Brian Allen's definitely got his Brian Allen art style.

[03:01] I, you know, I'm always on the fence

[03:04] depending on what the theme is

[03:05] when Brian does caricatures.

[03:07] Because like, they just always seem like,

[03:10] they just are like, like exploding in this.

[03:15] Like, I don't know, like more like,

[03:17] ren in stimpy kind of like facial expressions.

[03:21] Everyone's like screaming, eyes bulging out.

[03:23] Like I'm just,

[03:26] I, you know, Brian, I'm like, you know,

[03:27] on certain things, it looks good.

[03:29] I have to see this in person.

[03:31] Like if I zoom in on the art here, let's go here.

[03:40] You know, I'm like, yeah, you know,

[03:43] it's like everything, everyone's screaming.

[03:46] It's like, it is a little over the top.

[03:52] But I like the, I just love this theme.

[03:57] Like I just, I don't really care.

[03:59] Like I want this game.

[04:01] Like I want a big trouble and little shine of pinball machine.

[04:04] From a mextam point,

[04:06] and we haven't seen much yet in terms of like,

[04:08] what the mextue in the game.

[04:11] But I, you know,

[04:15] it's definite like, you know, the skulls like taken over,

[04:19] if we go up here, I mean, there's not much in it.

[04:23] Am I, am I wrong?

[04:24] Like where, there's like a scoop.

[04:28] There's a scoop here, you know, and you're here.

[04:31] Like this just looks like a drop target.

[04:33] I don't know, this looks like another drop target.

[04:36] This just looks like, you know,

[04:39] is that another flipper there?

[04:40] It's a three flipper game.

[04:42] This shot over it goes across here.

[04:45] So like, you know,

[04:47] yeah, you know, when people were like,

[04:48] oh yeah, like this is killing Star Wars.

[04:52] I'm like, come on guys, like simmer down.

[04:54] Like this isn't,

[04:58] this isn't killing Star Wars for anybody.

[05:03] I think there's like too much,

[05:06] let me give some constructive criticism here.

[05:10] Where is the pork chop express?

[05:13] Like where is the iconic truck?

[05:14] Like there's too much, too much of what's in the game right now

[05:18] is simply like low pans,

[05:21] like low pans chamber is like 90% of what's being represented

[05:28] in this game would have liked to have seen the pork chop express,

[05:34] would have liked like rating to fire lightning

[05:38] and also like that guy that like expands,

[05:40] I would have liked a mech for that guy to like blow up.

[05:44] I know, you know what I'm saying?

[05:45] Like I just, I don't think there's anything physically

[05:49] in this game that's bringing those gods to life.

[05:54] Like low pan for example,

[05:55] like his whole thing was he like,

[05:57] he's like eight feet tall and he sort of like rises up.

[06:01] Like having a low pan come up from under the play field to bash,

[06:06] like you know, I don't know.

[06:07] I'm, it looks very basic and I'm sure it's gonna be fun

[06:12] with the assets, but mechanically,

[06:16] you know, I just don't see much in it mechanically.

[06:22] Now I guess the question I have for these home brew guys is,

[06:26] is it, can you take like a mech from an old game

[06:31] and reuse it in a new design?

[06:33] Like for example, like could you take for example,

[06:37] the disappearing magnet genie from toad in

[06:41] and make that low pan and you bash them

[06:44] and then the ball disappears?

[06:46] Could you do stuff like that?

[06:48] Like could you turn the toad in lamp

[06:50] into a rotating pork chop express

[06:54] where you got to turn the truck around enough times?

[06:56] I'm just curious because like sometimes I look at some

[06:59] of these all original design home brews

[07:01] and I'm like, yeah, it really shows though

[07:04] the limitations of not having mechanical engineers in a game.

[07:12] But wait, if they're doing one off home brew,

[07:14] like everything in the game is illegal,

[07:16] like you know what I'm saying?

[07:17] Why couldn't they just yank the best mechs from existing games

[07:23] and reuse them where it makes sense in a game like this?

[07:28] That's the part I don't get.

[07:30] And it might actually be easier to do

[07:33] like what they did with Ferris Bueller's Day Off

[07:35] and just take a good game and re-skin it.

[07:39] The pork chop express is the entire outside of the game.

[07:43] The cat, yeah, okay.

[07:45] Okay, I mean, I saw that.

[07:50] But here's my thing, Dan.

[07:51] If the cabinets, the pork chop express

[07:53] then the topper should have been like the 18 wheeler.

[07:57] You know what I'm saying, Dan?

[07:58] Like why would you make the cabinet, the pork chop express

[08:02] and not have like the 18 wheeler on the top?

[08:06] Like the way an 18 wheeler has the lights

[08:09] and the exhaust pipe and the, you know,

[08:12] like make it look like the top of an 18 wheeler.

[08:15] I, I, if you could just throwing ride in up there,

[08:19] I don't know, you know?

[08:27] I'm a stickler for like details and consistency.

[08:31] You know, also having like different artists

[08:33] on all, like Brian Allen, I don't know, I like,

[08:39] I think all the art should be from the same artist too.

[08:42] I just, again, like I'm, I don't,

[08:44] I don't mix mixing and mashing to me

[08:47] is not, is not my favorite.

[08:50] But again, absolutely labor of love project.

[08:53] I can't wait to play it at Expo.

[08:56] I'm super happy they made it and, you know,

[08:58] it's cool to see this stuff.

[09:00] It's really cool to see this stuff.

[09:02] So congrats to all those guys who worked on it.

[09:05] I think they've been working on it for a year

[09:06] because I remember talking to the guy after Expo last year

[09:11] and told them, I would have loved to have been

[09:13] a part of a project like this, just to see like,

[09:15] hey, what ideas do you have?

[09:16] Like I've watched this movie like a thousand times.

[09:23] All right, but I got, I got people yesterday

[09:25] that were like, man, like like, like big trouble

[09:29] and little China makes Star Wars look like crap

[09:31] and I'm just like, come on, man, simmer down.

[09:34] Simmer down, no, it doesn't.

[09:36] Star Wars makes Star Wars look like crap.

[09:38] Like we don't need another pin to do that for it.

[09:42] Poor Star Wars.

[09:44] Poor Stern Pinball.

[09:46] I almost want to like, you know, put Stern Pinball

[09:49] on my lap and just rock it back.

[09:50] You guys so good for the last 20 years.

[09:53] You kept Pinball alive all these years.

[09:55] You've lost your way, you know, you've lost your way.

[09:59] It turns your back on your loyal customers

[10:02] and you overcharge for a platform

[10:05] that's not innovative enough

[10:06] and your games are looking really cheap

[10:09] for the amount of money they are.

[10:10] Poor Stern.

[10:12] Okay, time to go to bed, Stern, you know, it's like,

[10:18] they need the punch back and we're gonna see

[10:23] if Stern Pinball has what it takes to punch back.

[10:26] Because they didn't punch back with King Kong,

[10:28] they did not punch back with Star Wars.

[10:31] Walking Dead Remastered.

[10:32] I already know from people who have seen the game

[10:34] that it's not gonna do what they need it to do.

[10:39] And then, you know, if the rumor is like,

[10:43] Elliot, Isman's Transformers D1 is like,

[10:45] you know me, I love Transformers D1.

[10:47] I just, I don't know.

[10:50] I just don't think Stern, hmm.

[10:56] I don't know, are any of you else just like,

[10:58] do you feel the excitement to see the next Stern

[11:01] the way you're excited to see Beetlejuice?

[11:05] Fizzy, what's up, baby?

[11:07] Do you think Stern investors know how inferior

[11:10] and cheap their games are

[11:11] or do they just see the numbers?

[11:13] Look, investors just want the numbers

[11:16] to be where they want them to be.

[11:18] And Stern investors have had a really good run

[11:22] and they've made a lot of money

[11:24] but I bet they're not making the margins

[11:29] they want right now and their overhead is so big.

[11:33] So we'll see.

[11:37] Star Wars doesn't translate on stream.

[11:40] So Spooky Pimball.

[11:44] What have been the rumors this week?

[11:46] Well, congratulations to Don who's been hired apparently

[11:50] by Spooky.

[11:52] I've had a lot of people hit me up about that.

[11:55] I think people hit me up as if I'm going to be,

[11:58] like upset or disappointed and it's like anything but that.

[12:02] You can ask Bug and Luke.

[12:03] I was like, I'm glad.

[12:05] Like if Don has good ideas to put into a game,

[12:09] the more the merrier,

[12:11] I don't understand why anyone would be upset by any of this.

[12:13] I think those guys have a really good head on their shoulders

[12:17] and I think they have a very family friendly,

[12:20] just friendly and general environment

[12:23] that is very inviting and magnetic

[12:25] and I think it invites people in.

[12:28] And you know, and like Bug and Luke will say to me,

[12:30] like, you know, I, we wish you guys could just get along

[12:34] and I again, as I always tell them,

[12:37] it's not on my side of the fence.

[12:39] You know, I've tried many, many times

[12:42] to just move past whatever there was

[12:45] which was so long ago that it's almost comical

[12:47] that there's still an inability for people

[12:50] to just be like, dude, are we cool?

[12:53] Cool. Like just move on.

[12:54] Like I don't, that's kind of where I'm at with it.

[12:58] I think you'll see when we get to Expo, Retro Ralph,

[13:01] just needs, apparently needs to look me in the eye.

[13:03] Can't win.

[13:06] All right, we're gonna do that.

[13:08] We're gonna look in the eye

[13:08] then I guess all is forgiven or somewhat forgiven.

[13:13] But yeah, I'm happy that we're gonna get some excitement

[13:18] and pinball coming from our friends over in Benton, Wisconsin.

[13:22] And I think we're gonna see it.

[13:24] We're gonna see it in this, I think early December.

[13:27] I think spooky pinball is usually like a late November,

[13:29] early December kind of reveal.

[13:38] I'm just reading your guys.

[13:41] Ben is doing the code, yeah, like, I don't know, like,

[13:45] they told me that one of my ideas has been implemented

[13:48] into the next game.

[13:50] And I do think it's gonna be Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,

[13:53] Beetlejuice is a way to turn the game on.

[13:56] I think they're gonna have something fun like that.

[13:59] This is a moment.

[14:03] This is a moment in pinball and I think we've all been waiting

[14:05] for this moment and I think this is a moment

[14:08] in which passion over profit is gonna prevail.

[14:14] And what passion over profit is gonna do for the folks

[14:18] at spooky is it's going to catapult them

[14:23] into the next three to years of tremendous success.

[14:27] I'm really excited.

[14:30] And I couldn't be happier because I do have a very strong feeling

[14:35] that there will be a Beetlejuice pinball machine

[14:39] as the first ever game in Canadian garage.

[14:43] The space is free.

[14:46] I thought it might have been Star Wars.

[14:47] I had a Star Wars LED ordered.

[14:49] I canceled it immediately when I saw the game.

[14:52] I think Beetlejuice will be the game that makes a toy

[14:56] into my garage.

[14:59] I am excited for the team over there, for Franchie,

[15:03] for Bug, for Luke.

[15:05] I think this is gonna be a moment like no other

[15:11] in terms of wow, like jaw drop, wow, excitement.

[15:20] I think this game is gonna sell out faster than anything

[15:23] we've seen sell out in a long, long time.

[15:28] And I think what's gonna happen now is a wake up call

[15:31] to David Van Es.

[15:33] I mean, you know, okay, David,

[15:36] and David listens to my show and David, I talked to him.

[15:39] There's a reason why they're marketing,

[15:42] why do you think they're marketing labyrinth at Expo?

[15:44] Think about that for a minute.

[15:46] Just why do you think they're like marketing labyrinth

[15:51] at pinball Expo, the old game?

[15:54] Why do you think, take one guess,

[15:56] why a company like Beryl's a fun

[15:58] needs to market labyrinth?

[16:04] Any guesses?

[16:07] They got a new game they need to sell,

[16:08] but they're marketing the old one.

[16:12] Yeah.

[16:17] Wayne, I know you're like become this like Beryl's,

[16:20] you become like the Beryl's fanboy.

[16:22] Wayne, I don't know where you're at,

[16:24] but the flyer yesterday was all about

[16:26] coming to see labyrinth at Expo.

[16:29] And Wayne, I think the part that Wayne,

[16:35] you selling four to five dunes in Australia

[16:38] does not change the fact that there are a lot

[16:43] of unsolved labyrinth games, a lot of unsolved

[16:47] dune games.

[16:49] And I think again, you're looking at it

[16:53] through like your little environment, right?

[16:58] Or like there's no supply of anything in Australia,

[17:00] so like kind of everything moves.

[17:04] You sold a container of dunes.

[17:06] How many is that Wayne?

[17:10] How many is that?

[17:15] Okay.

[17:17] You sold 40 labyrinths.

[17:20] All right.

[17:21] You sold 21 dune machines.

[17:24] They need to sell 1,000, right?

[17:27] Isn't that the 1,000?

[17:28] So that again, when I, I, the, again,

[17:36] we all know this.

[17:38] Dune is a really neat dune game.

[17:44] Like I've been saying this for a while.

[17:48] It's just not a theme that most people in this demo want.

[17:57] I don't know what I don't know what I'm saying.

[18:02] Like when Beetlejuice sells out in nine minutes,

[18:06] what am I supposed to say?

[18:08] It's like it's going to sell out in nine minutes.

[18:11] Ian, Ian, Jacob, Ian's going to buy one.

[18:14] Dune and Avatar, the movies make money,

[18:16] but no one, yeah, dude, nobody cares

[18:18] about the new Avatar trailer.

[18:19] Have you seen it?

[18:20] Like nobody cares.

[18:27] If David Van S had made Barbie, he would have sold way more.

[18:31] He would have sold way more Barbies than Dune and labyrinth.

[18:37] Look, I, I, I, I, I, I, I always feel this pressure

[18:44] because I'm friends with these dudes

[18:47] and I understand they're passionate, but how did nobody

[18:51] do market research?

[18:53] I mean, I just put up that poll yesterday.

[18:55] Would you rather have Pokemon or Big Trouble in the China?

[18:57] I think Big Trouble in the China is leading the poll.

[19:04] What for you guys saying like I'm like making this up about like,

[19:10] like let me, oh God, this is so annoying.

[19:13] Like why?

[19:15] Why?

[19:16] Let's see.

[19:20] I want to show you what I'm talking about.

[19:26] If I remember my password to Facebook,

[19:28] I try not to hit this damn court again.

[19:31] Oh my God.

[19:33] Check your notifications on another.

[19:35] Oh my God.

[19:36] Where?

[19:41] Where is the notification hold up?

[19:43] Like,

[19:47] why can't I just log on to my stuff?

[19:50] Try another way.

[19:51] Text me.

[19:52] Oh my God.

[19:53] This is the modern world where they text is.

[19:55] Okay, where's the text now?

[19:59] Here we go.

[20:05] All right, let's see if that works.

[20:11] Trans this device.

[20:15] I'm going to do it.

[20:16] I'm going to do it.

[20:17] I'm going to do it.

[20:18] I'm going to do it.

[20:20] All right.

[20:25] Sorry guys, I'm just going to just want to show you

[20:28] what I'm talking about.

[20:34] Barrels.

[20:50] Yeah, like.

[20:58] I mean, I'm not making this stuff up.

[21:05] Like,

[21:06] this is what I'm talking about.

[21:10] Revisit the game that started it all.

[21:13] I mean, like,

[21:14] I know I'm being a little bit of a facetious jerk.

[21:20] I mean, I'm not making any of that stuff.

[21:22] I mean, you're getting a look at times.

[21:24] I'm purposely being sarcastic.

[21:28] Revisit the game that started it all

[21:30] in two weeks.

[21:32] Like I don't.

[21:34] I don't understand.

[21:35] Like this is literally.

[21:39] What,

[21:40] what.

[21:41] I mean, I get.

[21:43] I mean, I get there going to.

[21:44] Is the new audience.

[21:45] I don't understand.

[21:48] like a couple hundred they need to sell.

[21:53] I don't get it.

[21:58] And then like we get into this stuff.

[22:02] Right.

[22:02] Like this is the part that like again,

[22:05] I'm not, I don't mean to be a jerk,

[22:07] but like I work in comms.

[22:09] Don't tell me you have a hit game

[22:11] that didn't even sell out.

[22:13] In two weeks we'll have our inaugural hit game,

[22:16] Jim Henson's Labyrinth.

[22:19] How is it a hit game?

[22:20] You didn't even sell.

[22:23] You know, you know it.

[22:24] And then the thing is like when I call David,

[22:25] you know, he says he's like,

[22:26] Oh, well, Chris, we only thought we were going to sell 500.

[22:28] Then why didn't you just release 500?

[22:32] You can't say it did better than you thought,

[22:34] but then you offered like 1200 of them.

[22:37] And then you had a, you had a real that fact.

[22:40] People forget this.

[22:41] Wasn't it 1200 was the initial,

[22:44] then they realized they weren't going to hit that.

[22:47] Then it was 1000 and now they've still maybe only sold a 50.

[22:52] So like, is that a hit?

[22:54] Is that a hit?

[22:58] David, I'm reading this like you're here.

[23:05] Like what?

[23:06] It's did did the Labyrinth sell out?

[23:13] I got you right here, David.

[23:15] Did Labyrinth sell out?

[23:18] Okay.

[23:19] How many more are there to be sold?

[23:24] I'm going to see you in two weeks, by the way.

[23:25] We're going to get a beer.

[23:27] And you're going to, okay, 75 left.

[23:30] Okay.

[23:37] That began the immersive pinball journey.

[23:39] All our games take players on.

[23:43] Okay.

[23:45] You know, you know, David, you know, I love you.

[23:47] And I'm pulling your chain.

[23:48] But and thank you for showing up.

[23:53] Look, I'll just give you some advice.

[23:55] And David, this is everybody.

[23:58] When talking about yourself, and I got this advice once

[24:03] from the editor and chief of Wired magazine,

[24:08] really smart guy, great friend of mine, Joe Brown.

[24:11] He said, the biggest mistake that companies make

[24:15] is when they use adjectives and hyperbole

[24:18] to describe their own products in their communication.

[24:23] Don't tell me your products are hit.

[24:26] I'll tell you if it's a hit.

[24:28] Don't tell me it's exciting.

[24:31] And it's, you know what I'm saying?

[24:32] Like, and I get this is pinball marketing.

[24:34] So it's a little bit different.

[24:37] It's a little bit different.

[24:39] But yes, I, you know, I understand.

[24:44] And David's company's positioning, it's a hit for them

[24:49] because it did better than they expected.

[24:51] I'm going to give you that, David.

[24:52] And I'm going to stop screen sharing.

[24:55] But, but yeah, so 75 more labyrinths to be sold.

[25:01] I know you won't tell me how many more dunes you need to sell.

[25:05] And David, next time, next time, market research the theme.

[25:14] It's that simple.

[25:16] You know, like stern pinball passed on beetle juice.

[25:18] And we're about to witness a beetle juice feeding frenzy.

[25:23] Now, look, the play devil's advocate a little bit.

[25:25] The reason why the frenzy around beetle juice

[25:28] will be so significant is that only 999 will ever be made.

[25:32] If stern release beetle juice

[25:34] and offered all three trims and thousands of premiums,

[25:37] you're not going to get the same.

[25:40] You know, unfortunately for stern,

[25:42] nothing they release now feels special.

[25:45] And everything immediately on day one

[25:50] is a mass produced item that will never be hard to get.

[25:55] And David, you know, and I mean this.

[25:58] David, franche, but all you guys

[26:01] with boutique companies, the rock is yours.

[26:06] The ball is in your court.

[26:09] You guys are what people want now

[26:12] because you're the only companies that can actually have

[26:17] a volume of game that will forever be in demand

[26:22] if you get it right.

[26:25] Unfortunately for stern,

[26:27] they like they literally destroyed all of their LE buyers

[26:31] and the LE games are now the biggest losses

[26:35] in the history of pinball.

[26:38] And they completely got greedy.

[26:40] And I go back to it.

[26:42] I'll go back to it again.

[26:43] When they charged $20,000 for James Bond's 60th,

[26:47] that was the middle finger moment to every single person

[26:51] who had helped stern pinball be successful over the years.

[26:55] Charging $20,000 for James Bond's 60th,

[26:59] you don't get to walk that back.

[27:01] You can't walk it back.

[27:03] And it shows you what's in the heart of that company

[27:05] from a marketing standpoint.

[27:07] They thought you were so stupid

[27:10] that you would spend $20,000 on a single level

[27:15] gain that like it plays all right,

[27:18] but it looks like crap.

[27:20] It's like it literally that game looks so cheap

[27:24] and the bomb on that game and they know it is so cheap.

[27:28] And then they want to go and charge you $20,000.

[27:31] And so they can't walk it back.

[27:33] They can't walk it back.

[27:35] And then they lied to everybody who bought one

[27:38] that they were gonna have the exclusive James Bond topper

[27:41] exclusive.

[27:43] Oh no, we didn't mean exclusive.

[27:44] We meant exclusively signed by Keith L. Winne.

[27:47] No, that's not what any of your press materials said.

[27:51] And they have yet to apologize for any of those shenanigans.

[27:56] And you know what?

[27:58] Only Canadian calling them out on it,

[27:59] left or right all the time, calling them out on it.

[28:03] Nobody else, nobody else.

[28:06] Chris, how long do you think it takes to develop a game,

[28:10] including securing the IP?

[28:12] Well, David, my guess is from soup to nuts,

[28:18] the developmental, the development cycle,

[28:22] on a pin, depending on what the theme is

[28:24] and the licensing issues,

[28:27] I would say two to three years,

[28:30] depending on the complexities of the license.

[28:35] So, you know,

[28:39] it depends, because some licenses,

[28:43] you might get the IP,

[28:46] but then you have to chase down all the actors individually

[28:49] to get their rights.

[28:51] So that's the deal with the matrix, by the way.

[28:55] So Jersey Jack has the matrix license.

[28:58] Everybody knows this.

[28:59] This is not a secret.

[29:00] Jersey Jack has the matrix license,

[29:03] but the Wachowskis will give you the IP of the matrix,

[29:09] but then you've got to go individually

[29:13] and contract all of the actors,

[29:15] which is a nightmare and Larry Fishburn

[29:20] or Born might not want to do it.

[29:22] So, you know, you're probably never going to see a matrix game.

[29:28] Christopher Franchey, I'm starting work on games for 2027 and 2028.

[29:34] Yeah, and Christopher Franchey,

[29:35] I'm buying those games in 2027 and 2028.

[29:44] Franchey is the,

[29:46] Franchey's art is the best art for Pimbal.

[29:52] It's just that simple.

[29:54] It's the best art for Pimbal,

[29:56] because it takes the iconic visual representation of the theme,

[30:03] and it serves it back to you in an even better way,

[30:06] that is recognizable and enhanced.

[30:09] There's been a lot of beautiful machines out in the world,

[30:13] nothing tops Batman SLE.

[30:17] Nothing.

[30:22] Nothing.

[30:25] Top to bottom.

[30:28] Top to bottom that game, you know.

[30:30] Do I regret selling mine?

[30:31] Yeah, I do.

[30:34] But I had my fun for it for two years.

[30:37] It's not even about the money, it's just a beautiful game.

[30:40] Now, the thing is like evil dead, I think, is equally as beautiful now.

[30:44] And I think that it's just beginning.

[30:47] I think he's just getting started now.

[30:49] I think he's in the right place with the right people who have given him the right motivation and inspiration.

[30:56] And I think he wants to bury those people back at Stern.

[31:00] Like, angry people change the world.

[31:04] I think Franchie is going to like drive a stake through the people that like didn't know how to work with him.

[31:12] And you know, I could see it all those years, he tried to reconcile,

[31:17] and they literally were, they always kind of gave them like,

[31:21] yeah, we'll do your podcast, but we're never going to let you back.

[31:25] Now he doesn't, now he doesn't need to go back.

[31:28] And not only that, now he's a, now he's going to attack your sales,

[31:33] and it, and you're going to feel it and Stern's going to feel it.

[31:38] It's great. It's great.

[31:47] Hector, I mean, Ghostbusters is gorgeous.

[31:50] Ghostbusters is still Zambietti's finest Ellie.

[31:57] Absolutely.

[31:59] But there's just been too much since then that doesn't look as good.

[32:12] Yeah, it's, it's, it's exactly what everybody wants to hear bugs say is they're excited.

[32:18] Do you hear anybody at Stern saying they're excited for the next three games?

[32:21] They can't wait for you to see them.

[32:23] I mean, point me in the direction where someone at Stern Pimbal is saying to us the community,

[32:29] we're so excited about our next three titles.

[32:31] We can't wait for you to see them.

[32:33] Is anyone saying that anywhere?

[32:36] The new CMO has a, like, even after I call them out for like, has he said,

[32:40] how do you?

[32:41] Has Stern's new chief marketing officer said, how do you once as a community?

[32:45] Has he come out from whatever he's trying to do?

[32:47] Sell more games to Gen Z kids or people in China?

[32:50] Like, has he said, hi, my name is, I'm the new Stern chief marketing officer.

[32:57] I want to hear from you.

[33:00] I've been here for about six months a year.

[33:02] I want to listen to what we're doing.

[33:03] Right.

[33:04] I want to listen to what we're doing wrong.

[33:05] And I want to make an impact on this organization.

[33:09] And I need your help because you all have made this company so great all these years.

[33:14] Has he said that to you?

[33:16] That's the first thing I would have said to you.

[33:17] I would have said, hey, I'm sorry.

[33:18] I threw a drink in Tim Sexton's face.

[33:20] I'm happy he's no longer here.

[33:22] Let's get down to business.

[33:23] I know some of you love me.

[33:24] Some of you hate me.

[33:25] But as Stern's new chief marketing officer, you know, I've been a blowhard for 12 years in this industry.

[33:30] I know this industry very well from the community standpoint, from a collector standpoint.

[33:35] And I all ask of everyone is this.

[33:39] Give me a chance to make some moves here that I think you're all going to appreciate.

[33:43] And I think that's all I want to ask of you.

[33:46] You're not going to see me podcast.

[33:47] You're not going to see me on Facebook live.

[33:49] I'm going to be behind the scenes a little bit and we're going to make some awesome moves.

[33:53] And you're going to see them over the next year.

[33:55] Now we it might take a year to get some of the old decisions out of the system.

[34:00] But that's what our commitment is to each and every one of you.

[34:03] We were very excited to see competition raise the bar.

[34:07] But nobody's going to punch like we're going to punch in this hobby.

[34:10] Where's that?

[34:11] Where's that talk?

[34:12] Where's that swagger?

[34:13] Where like John Borg doesn't even want to promote his own game.

[34:18] Spent spent you spent like a year to make it a Star Wars game.

[34:21] You're not even proud of.

[34:28] They could have had me and they could have had me for probably a lot less money than I make right now.

[34:33] Because this is what pinball does to people.

[34:35] It makes you feel like I love it so much.

[34:38] I love talking about it so much.

[34:39] I love being involved in it.

[34:41] And I think when you actually get hired in it and you get close to the sun,

[34:47] I think you stop loving it.

[34:51] I mean, look what it did to Jack Danger.

[34:53] I mean, we see what we saw what it we physically saw what it did to Jack Danger.

[35:00] The most positive, amazing ambassador for this sport.

[35:07] Now that's that's a problem.

[35:09] Like Stern pinball has a problem.

[35:11] Like the way they operate is breaking the people that it should be inspiring.

[35:18] You know what I'm saying?

[35:19] Like when a company breaks a man who clearly could be the future of your organization,

[35:25] both from an external standpoint and an internal standpoint,

[35:29] you know, Jack Danger is like kind of got it all.

[35:31] Like he's got the design skills.

[35:33] He's got the look and the the of what you want.

[35:40] Is Donna paid employees, but I don't know if they're paying Don or not.

[35:44] I don't know if spooky's on here.

[35:47] I don't know.

[35:50] I mean, if you are a paid employee of a company, it does make the podcasting

[36:00] difficult, maybe impossible.

[36:05] You know, it's like is Nate Schiver still doing like the Stern podcast?

[36:08] Like I don't know.

[36:09] I never hear anybody talk about or sharing Stern's podcasts.

[36:12] Is that still happening?

[36:13] Remember when Ken was doing the JJP podcast, it's just like, you just kind of lose it.

[36:18] Like I don't think a company should have a podcast.

[36:21] I don't.

[36:22] I think they should join podcasts, but I don't think they should have their own.

[36:31] Don just moved to Benton.

[36:32] He's not an employee at all, but hangs with the boys.

[36:36] No, did he really move to Benton?

[36:38] Franchi from where was he?

[36:42] Like he moved houses?

[36:47] I don't.

[36:48] Wow.

[36:50] Okay, cool.

[36:52] I'm in.

[36:52] I'm so jealous of the property values in Benton, Wisconsin.

[36:59] Are you serious?

[37:01] He bought Charlie's old house.

[37:02] Is it?

[37:04] That's so that's crazy.

[37:07] Did he buy all of Charlie's Corvettes or just the house?

[37:19] I look, I guarantee you, you know, my little meager, $1.5 million house here,

[37:28] would get me a lot more there.

[37:31] Gang, it's crazy.

[37:32] Just going in my town, man, these houses, like 3 million, 4 million, 5 million,

[37:36] left and right on the waterfront, you're talking 20 million.

[37:40] You go to New Canaan, you know, forget it.

[37:43] Then you go even further to Greenwich,

[37:45] you're talking $100 million homes.

[37:47] There's like this strip I drive by where every home is like 60 million,

[37:51] just one after another.

[37:53] And this is why I'm like, you know, like, I'm happy with my life.

[37:57] I'm happy with what we have.

[37:59] I really don't know what people did to make all that money.

[38:02] I think it's, I'm assuming it's, you're either like a doctor, a lawyer, or finance.

[38:08] Like there's no other way.

[38:09] Because like, these people didn't invent anything.

[38:12] Like they didn't make a product that made money for the most.

[38:15] I think a lot of them just made money off of the markets,

[38:18] which is how the rest of us make money.

[38:22] And I don't hate it.

[38:23] I actually, I love being in a town where my house is,

[38:28] my house is going to just keep going up in value.

[38:33] Like that's where I want to be.

[38:34] I want my kids to grow up in a great village.

[38:36] You know, because in the end of the day, when you're in a good location,

[38:40] that's all that matters.

[38:42] It's all that matters.

[38:43] We're all going to be in the same schools.

[38:44] We're all going to be at the same restaurants.

[38:45] We're all going to be walking down the same streets.

[38:47] And we're all going to die.

[38:48] And we're all going to, we're all going to have fun together.

[38:50] Like I, you know, in some of these towns, like, you know, some,

[38:53] you get those deep bags that are always trying to find out how much money you have

[38:57] and brag about their vacations and their homes and aspen.

[38:59] And I'm like, that's cool.

[39:00] I got a beautiful Irish wife and two kids that are happy and healthy.

[39:03] I've got a Dodge Demon and a, and one pinball machine.

[39:06] And I don't really need anymore.

[39:08] I really don't.

[39:09] I kind of just want money to give my kids the opportunity to travel to things,

[39:15] to go to Disney World more often.

[39:17] Like, that's what I want money for.

[39:18] I don't, I don't need, I don't need like a $20 million home with two people in it.

[39:23] Don is Dr. Pinball is a hobby and he actually buys games.

[39:29] Down, so down south pinball.

[39:32] Down south pinball.

[39:33] I know you're insulting me right now because you're blocked on my Facebook page.

[39:40] And you always insult me and you keep saying that because I don't buy pinball machines,

[39:47] I'm somehow in, in valid voice of this hobby.

[39:52] I don't know who you are.

[39:54] I'm not sure why you always come hang out in my places to continually insult me.

[40:01] But I'll just say this brother, I wish you and your family nothing but health and happiness in life.

[40:06] But let me just, let me just, let me just ask you a favor.

[40:09] You don't like me.

[40:11] Leave.

[40:13] Just leave.

[40:17] Just leave.

[40:20] Nobody, like nobody is excited by your presence.

[40:24] And I guess what I, you know, I don't think it's healthy brother to go hang out with people you don't like.

[40:30] Like you literally, all you ever do is insult me and say I don't buy games.

[40:36] Okay, I could go buy, where do you want me to put my games?

[40:41] Where do you want me to put them?

[40:43] And I'm glad I don't buy all these games because I'm making money.

[40:46] I'm making money, bro.

[40:48] I don't want to lose three to $4,000 on these games.

[40:52] But yeah, these guys are funny.

[40:54] I mean, it's like, you know, it's like.

[41:03] Bro, bro, you're in, there's a reason why.

[41:07] The reason.

[41:09] It's just body man.

[41:11] These dudes.

[41:12] All right, hold on.

[41:18] Yeah, like a lot of people, man.

[41:20] Like, well, look, the thing about, you know, it's, it's weird to say like, I buy games.

[41:27] So I'm white.

[41:29] What, what?

[41:30] I mean, look, Don was bought, you know, much money Don has lost buying games.

[41:35] And don't like, because he bought like John Wick, Elie bro, like, again, like, I think he's learned a lesson too.

[41:43] Is that all right, maybe, maybe running into buy all these Elies was pointless.

[41:56] There's no fame in Pimbal, man.

[41:58] Nobody's famous.

[41:59] Let me just quick get some more coffee.

[42:00] Hold on.

[42:01] No, like, I, look, I legit always wonder like what makes people trigger triggered by Canada so much.

[42:09] Hold on.

[42:10] More coffee.

[42:12] It's so beautiful out.

[42:28] Yeah, do you believe in it?

[42:30] Can you guys have a question?

[42:32] And I mean, is, do we have any like doctors?

[42:34] Are there any like doc any doctors or like chiropractors or anybody?

[42:38] I just have for the last like month.

[42:40] And I think it's because I'm like right here, right here, like right on my back of my hip, this pain right there.

[42:51] It's right here.

[42:53] And it's just chronic now.

[42:55] And I don't know what to do.

[42:56] I think I might be like sleeping on a weird or like the way I sit in it.

[43:02] I don't know what, what's going on.

[43:04] And it's not, it's, I think it's because I, maybe because I wear shoes without enough arches.

[43:11] I don't know what getting old sucks.

[43:13] It sucks.

[43:16] It's not a kidney's, Dodie.

[43:19] Does K have more than one pit mom machine yet?

[43:22] No, I have guns and roses.

[43:25] Do you wear a wallet in your back pocket?

[43:27] No.

[43:30] Ten to Nitis.

[43:32] Yeah, I think I need to get that Alex because I think I think like when you get like the nerve, it just won't.

[43:39] And like definitely when I take some pain medication and knocks it out a little bit, it's a two-a-month.

[43:51] I know I was going to get butt jokes.

[43:58] Yeah, I don't know.

[44:02] Well, I was thinking it might be from driving the Toyota long distances.

[44:06] I think, you know, when I get in and out of that Toyota, I feel the pain there from like, you know, the manual transmission and using the left leg for the, for the clutch.

[44:16] Have you seen the big trouble play field or gameplay?

[44:19] BJ, big, what's BJ?

[44:24] BJ.

[44:25] I haven't seen BJ.

[44:37] Hey guys, I saw the friend his first line yesterday.

[44:42] The Chinese saying, hmm.

[44:48] Yeah, bad, lower disc, crushing nerves to leg.

[44:51] I definitely think it's like a nerve thing.

[44:54] Who do I go to that?

[44:55] Who do I go to a chiropractor or general?

[44:59] Like, who should I go see for this?

[45:02] Because I want to get it, I want to get it treated.

[45:07] Because I, it's just annoying.

[45:11] A physical therapist, a massage therapist, yoga.

[45:18] All right.

[45:21] Is that covered by insurance?

[45:32] Go see.

[45:33] All right.

[45:34] Acupuncture.

[45:35] I love all these.

[45:36] All right.

[45:37] I'm going to get it taken care of this winter.

[45:45] Other than that, I feel fine.

[45:48] Other than this chronic pain in my lower left hip area, I feel great.

[45:55] How you guys doing?

[45:56] Just in general, how you guys doing overall?

[46:01] I think what annoys people is that I recommend people not to buy pinball machines,

[46:08] unless the game is really worth it, unless the game makes you happy,

[46:13] unless you see the value in the game.

[46:16] Yes.

[46:17] I tend to lean in the territory of, I don't think you need more in life to be happy.

[46:23] I don't think you need to buy more things to be happy.

[46:26] I don't think a lot of stuff is elevating the pinball hobby creatively.

[46:31] I don't think four games a year by Stern is very sustainable at these prices.

[46:36] I also think we're seeing a lack of creativity when you're dividing your talent up so much,

[46:42] like they do at Stern.

[46:43] Again, I just think there is an ignorance to where modern pinball is.

[46:48] Having covered the hobby for 12 years, I think I have a decent amount of perspective,

[46:53] if you will, on where pinball has arrived at after COVID.

[46:58] It used to be a hobby where everybody won.

[47:02] Everybody won.

[47:03] You got into it, you played your games, you had fun, operators were making money.

[47:07] Games were not that much money to operate.

[47:09] If you bought it for your home and you moved it on, you weren't losing much money.

[47:13] In fact, you probably got your money back or you made a few thousand dollars.

[47:18] And now it's the complete opposite.

[47:20] You buy four Stern at least and you've lost 13 thousand dollars in a year.

[47:28] Can say that, canada, please don't come to pinball expo canada.

[47:32] Manufacturers don't want you there, canada.

[47:36] I love the new video mode in Evil Dead.

[47:38] I saw that, I was watching it, creativity,

[47:41] campiness, creativity, it's not just the video mode, it's the old school TV surrounding it,

[47:47] details, details, details, it's awesome.

[47:50] Same thing, I love the video mode in jaws.

[47:52] I love the jaws, the whole eight-bit jaws mode they put into that game.

[47:57] We need more of this.

[47:59] Do you have the new guns and roses?

[48:01] The new guns and roses, what pinball machine, Dean?

[48:05] Yeah, yeah, I mean, yes, this is like the worst get.

[48:08] Yes, I have the Jersey Jack Genre.

[48:17] Hector, do you keep, I think I'm like, I think your message is keep getting.

[48:23] Let me see if I can turn off moderation.

[48:28] Oh no, did I just, I think it keeps moderating you, Hector, hold on.

[48:32] It's annoying. I don't know why.

[48:35] Is it the heart? I don't know, where is it?

[48:38] It's something, it's something here.

[48:41] Cancel.

[48:48] All right.

[48:50] All right, hold on.

[48:55] The Kowsi Doctor, Don.

[48:57] Yeah, like gang.

[49:03] You know, the world.

[49:06] The world's really expensive and everyone now is just kind of.

[49:15] I look, things are what they are.

[49:19] I don't, I try not to.

[49:24] I look at the world and I look at everything and.

[49:33] The older I get, the less excited I get about the things that don't truly matter.

[49:42] And as I, you know, get towards 50 and I think about, well, what really matters to me is quality time with family and friends.

[49:52] And seeing as much of this beautiful earth as I can,

[49:57] maximizing the amount of times I can feel free and feel at peace and feel true happiness.

[50:09] I don't think $15,000 or Pimball machines deliver on that.

[50:18] Now, what I do think Pimball delivers on is community, friendship, love, conversation, and connection.

[50:31] And that is why Pimball is always going to be worth it.

[50:39] But it's also why you don't need to buy games to experience those things.

[50:46] Once you truly understand, you got to remember that 99% of people on the planet don't even understand that there are objectives in a Pimball machine.

[50:58] They just walk up to it and just flail.

[51:03] So once you get what it's all about and you've experienced it and you then it's, to me, it's just fun to observe it all and connect with people and discuss it and play it and have opinions about it.

[51:17] But this whole notion that, you know, we need to keep buying games to keep these companies in business and fill your homes with more stuff.

[51:29] And I know I can speak from experience. I've collected many things. I collected arcade games. I collected Transformers toys.

[51:40] I collected Street Fighter 2 action figures. I've collected Gucci clothes. I've collected.

[51:49] You know, everything that I've bought never really filled much of any of the voids of my life that my wife and children fill.

[51:59] And none of the things I bought have ever left an indelible experience like my trip to Santorini with Brenda, like my honeymoon in Japan, like bringing Killian to Disney World for the first time.

[52:14] And so as I think about where to spend money and I have a Pimball machine I love, you have many you love. I'm going to get beetle juice. I know I'm going to love it.

[52:26] I don't need to keep absorbing more.

[52:31] And you know, I think what's kind of always made me feel very proud as the world's most subscribed to Pimball podcaster, more subscribers than all the other shows combined.

[52:43] Think about that for a minute. And I'm the only one who doesn't keep buying every single game. I'm the only one that doesn't go deep into like rule sets.

[52:52] So why is it why is it the success of Canadian Pimball podcast and the topic which is always Pimball related. But we're getting to a layer that's more meaningful more impactful and more honest and more real.

[53:11] And I love it. And I love that you hang out here every Saturday morning and I have this extended family. I feel blessed. I feel blessed. I feel like Robin did be the greatest favor ever when he banned me ban me from Pinside 12 years ago.

[53:27] Will you sell GNR for beetle juice? No, I'm not.

[53:33] I look at the thing about GNR gang. It's just you have no idea the nightmare was getting it up the stairs. I just worry about moving it out and ever moving anything else up there. It was like literally a nightmare.

[54:00] I also love guns and roses. I as a band. GNR will always be to me, GNR will always be looked at with fondness. It will.

[54:17] And you know, because here's what all happened. You're just never going to get another music pin like guns roses ever.

[54:25] And you're never going to get like a concert in a box the way they did GNR ever again. And I know that it's doesn't shoot great and I know that there's issues with the game.

[54:38] But there is a level of beauty to that game that I just enjoy walking by it every day. I really do.

[54:50] I love the fact that you can just put it in jukebox mode and I could pour some whiskey and and and see an entire guns and roses concert.

[54:58] And you know, with this amazing light show coming from this incredible work of art, I that makes me happy as a GNR fan. I never thought we'd see a pinball experience like that.

[55:17] I don't like iron maiden as much as guns and roses. I of course iron maiden is a better shooting pinball machine. But again, gang, you put iron maiden next to guns and roses. It looks like it costs half as much money. I'm tired of stern's cheapness. I just have to be honest.

[55:31] I stern makes the nicest like $75 or L.E. I just I'm going to be candid here stern machines look cheap. And I'm tired of being told that I need to accept this cheap looking platform at twice the price now that it used to be.

[55:46] They do not look any better. They didn't they don't look any better than they did when they were $6500. So like I'm tired. I'm tired of stern apologists. I'm tired of this platform that hasn't evolved enough.

[56:02] I'm just tired of it. Stern games look like tinker toys next to Jersey Jack games. And now that Jersey Jack games shoot well. And now that Jersey Jack games are going to have great themes. And now that Jersey Jack's got Steve Richie with like flow. I'm tired.

[56:21] It's no comparison. Harry Potter makes King Kong look like a $5,000 game.

[56:31] Okay, so Jason said jaws anniversary metallic remastered Elvira blood red don't yeah those are those games I will say look good.

[56:45] But they could look so much better. Imagine if J.J.P. made jaws. Imagine if J.J.P. made Metallica. It would just look so much better. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[57:02] I don't know. I don't know.

[57:13] Look, I am. I don't want to feel this way about stern anymore. I'm getting tired of feeling this way about stern. They need to up their game. They need to up their game.

[57:32] I'm sorry.

[57:41] You know, it's great about all this though. We all have different opinions. Nobody's opinion is wrong here. Nobody's opinion is not valid.

[57:50] I love hearing people tell me they don't like guns or roses. I don't want to live in a world in which everybody likes guns or roses. I don't want to live in a world in which everybody likes iron made and I don't want to live in a world in which.

[58:00] You know, people just universally like one thing or the other. I think it's good to have disagreements. It's good to have different opinions.

[58:08] As long as we articulate and treat each other with respect, I think it's good. Yeah, so you know, and maybe it's not respectful for me to call anyone who buys a Star Wars Elliott dummy, but you are a dummy.

[58:20] Because why wouldn't you just buy it for 10 in like a month? It's going to be 10 G's in a month.

[58:26] Who would why would you buy a Star Wars Elliott right now? What what how rich do you have to be?

[58:31] They're just flush $3,000 down the toilet. But people like rich people usually want to buy low and sell high. So that's why I don't get.

[58:42] I've been on a stern tour. I've told like I've had so many stern tours. I've had George Gomez, Seth and Gary like private tour. I respect what they do.

[58:54] But in the end, I don't care about all that if what they're cranking out is Star Wars. All for nothing.

[59:07] Pins are terrible investments now. They're terrible.

[59:10] They're terrible. You know, like I mean, they just are. I don't look at any of this stuff like investments. Again, it's I look at it like to me, it's about not a financial investment.

[59:31] It's just like where do you want to invest your time? You know what I'm saying? Like you guys have you like every week, many of you invest your time in hanging out here. I appreciate that. And like this, you know this like this hour and a half is more exciting than playing an hour and a half of Star Wars Pimble.

[59:53] I mean that I 100% and you you you would feel it to if you played Star Wars Pimble for an hour and a half.

[01:00:03] You would after a while you'd be like, ah, you'd be frustrated with the tight shots. You'd be like over it. Yeah, this is more entertaining than that. And this is free. I mean other than your internet connection, this is free.

[01:00:19] So I can entertain you in the, you know, in the world of Pimble, I can provide more entertainment than than a lot of stern machines for 90 minutes.

[01:00:31] And I and I keep money in your pocket. I encourage you to go use that money for better, more meaningful parts of life.

[01:00:43] That's why we have most of the subscribers. That's why we have most of the, you know, we have a consistent subscriber base that is bigger than all the other shows.

[01:00:57] And like people have copied my formula. They go live. They do the before me doing this man. Nobody was doing this.

[01:01:04] The people forget this like people were not going live like canada people were not doing this like off the cuff. No, no show notes. No, they this. This is how it is. It's fun like this. It takes, takes some real mental health issues to do this on a weekly basis. I'm getting.

[01:01:21] You know, I'm looking forward to seeing Rachel and kale in in in a Chicago. I wasn't able to get like a bigger Omokase. I'm sorry gang gang gang. I can't even talk. I couldn't get like a larger Omokase.

[01:01:38] Like moment for us because it's just like the places are just stupid. So I was only able to get a table for a seat at the bar for four. And I haven't had really good Omokase in a while.

[01:01:51] So I'll just tell you who's going to be at this table. It's kale, Rachel and Melvin Williams and me Friday night 530 seating. So you're not going to see me at the show.

[01:02:05] Probably going to be a two hour dinner. It's about 35 minutes away from expo. And then but the I come in Thursday morning.

[01:02:14] At at like 8 am. So you have me all day Thursday all day Friday Friday night dinner boom and then all night Friday and then I'm out like noon or something on Saturday.

[01:02:30] So I look forward to seeing everybody there. It's in two weeks. The kids are coming home. Let me just conclude this Saturday morning spectacular part two by saying thank you for hanging out here every week.

[01:02:55] We see Raza coming. I love what I'm seeing with Raza back to the future man. I'm hearing a lot of good stuff. There he's never going to be able to make it though. Like the he's going to be making the game for six years.

[01:03:07] Like Melvin and I remember like me making the game for six years. Like he has no plan had up the manufacturing capacity of Dutch. I don't understand how he's going to do it. We'll see what he does.

[01:03:21] But it is a beautiful day here in Connecticut. My best friend one of my best friends in the world is getting married today in New York City. So we're going in. He got he got so lucky with the weather.
