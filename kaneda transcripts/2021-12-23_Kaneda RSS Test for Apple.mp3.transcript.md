[02:04] Podcast. I'm your host, happy holidays, how is everybody doing? Hopefully you're all having a happy and a healthy time with your friends and family. So here's the deal. It's been five years. Here I go again on my own. Canada is going to try something completely new and just show everybody out there that what we do on a weekly basis, all of these content creators out there who make entertaining pinball content for your consumption, I want to tell you guys,

[02:34] out there that it is a lot of work, it is a lot of time. When you listen to our shows, you are just experiencing

[02:41] the tip of the iceberg. And each and every one of us who makes pinball content, we do it because we love it.

[02:48] That is why we do it. We're not doing it because it's a business. We're not doing it because we're

[02:53] getting rich off of this, but it takes a lot of time. And after five years and 633 free podcasts about

[03:02] Pimball. Canada's Pimball podcast will be going offline unless you are a member of the Canada Club.

[03:10] And what does that mean? That means if you are a member of the Canada Club, you are still going to get

[03:14] Canada Spinball Podcast on a weekly basis. It's going to be the same great show that you've enjoyed all these

[03:20] years. And for those of you who don't want to join, I understand. I understand that it is 16 cents a day

[03:27] to get Canadas Pimball Podcasts at the lowest tier. Five dollars a month. And it's kind of

[03:32] it comical as I watch guys buy $12,000 pinball machines, $2,500 topers, and you say,

[03:41] hey, I've been giving you entertaining pinball content for years, and they get upset that you're asking

[03:47] for $5 a month to enjoy said content. Now, for those of you who are a part of the club,

[03:52] congratulations. Thank you so much for your support. We are now at over 300 people who are going

[03:58] to be getting these podcasts on a weekly basis. If you're listening to this and you are

[04:02] upset with me. I understand. I don't know why you're upset. You've had so much from me all these

[04:07] years. I just hope you realize that I really want everyone to continue listening to the show.

[04:13] And I hope you guys all join. It is super simple. All you have to do is go to Patreon backslash canada.

[04:20] P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com back-slash-Canada pinball. And I thank each and every one of you who is a member

[04:29] of the Canada Club. You know, five years ago I started this.

[04:32] podcast for one reason because I was banned by Pinside because grown men were afraid of the things I was

[04:39] saying about Pimball. Can you imagine the world in which we live in with all the division, all the fighting

[04:45] about politics and science and COVID and all the things we argue about? And I simply wanted to speak my mind

[04:54] about Pimball and they censored me. And so I created Canada's Pimball podcast as a response to that censorship

[05:02] because I don't believe in censorship. I don't believe in cancel culture. I don't believe

[05:07] we should turn off people that have a difference of opinion. And over the last five years, I think this show

[05:13] has grown. I think I've matured. I think I was a little too negative at times. I think I've dialed down

[05:19] the personal attacks. But the very core of this show and what it's always been about is very simple.

[05:26] That I think each and every one of us should get magic for the amazing.

[05:32] of money we are spending on these pinball machines. I think these companies should have

[05:37] the highest quality games for what they're charging for these machines. I think these companies

[05:43] should market their products in a way that shows respect to all the time that goes into making these

[05:50] products. And I think pinball companies out there should hear us. And we should not be afraid

[05:56] every once in a while to say, hey, that game is amazing. Or hey, that game is amazing. Or hey,

[06:02] That game sucks. And when I got into this hobby, all it was was cheerleading every single

[06:09] thing. And I've watched so many companies pop up over the years and steal your money because they saw

[06:17] how much you loved pinball and they created a pinball company to make games and they had no

[06:22] idea what they were doing. How many failed pinball ventures have we seen over the years?

[06:28] A lot of them. And the trend continues today, right? People are still pre-ordering.

[06:32] pinball machines, not knowing if a company really can make it happen, and it doesn't matter.

[06:36] You just throw money at it. And I will always be that show that says, hey, wait a minute,

[06:42] maybe we should stop and ask these companies to be accountable for the promises they're making

[06:48] to us. Maybe we should say to them, hey, if you say this game is shipping in July and you don't see

[06:53] anything for six months, why are we still cheerleading, right? Canadian's Pinball Podcasts. I also want

[06:58] to tell you what games are coming around the corner. You should know that it's going to be.

[07:02] Be Godfather. You should know that Toy Story is next. You should know that Venom is around the corner

[07:07] because these companies, what they really want to do is create this fomo. They don't want you to know

[07:13] what's next because they don't want you to make wise decisions. They want you to fall in love with whatever's

[07:19] on the line today. And I've loved, I've loved every moment of spoiling what themes are coming down the road

[07:28] because as pinball buyers, you deserve to know that.

[07:32] You deserve to know that. There is no competitive advantage at all. All that is bogus.

[07:37] This isn't a real competitive marketplace. It's not. Stern Pinball clobbers everybody. They are the only

[07:44] company in town. Everyone else is just hanging on by a thread or hanging on by some rich financial

[07:50] backing. But legitimately, if you were to say which pinball company is efficient, has the best

[07:56] quality, has the best code, has the best games, the best themes, it is unequivocally.

[08:02] stern pinball. That is why they are number one. The market has spoken. Everyone else is trying

[08:08] to nip at their heels. And if I can leave Jersey Jack with any advice, and I'm not leaving, I'm just saying

[08:13] this right now, Jersey Jack should go high end and make less games a year. What they're doing is absolutely

[08:18] assonite. And look, you can get more of this kind of Canada going off like this on my show. I'm not going to

[08:23] go down a road. I'm not going to do a whole show right now. But I just want to say this. I love every day

[08:28] picking up this mic and doing this show. I've made some of the best friends,

[08:32] my life through pinball. I love the people in this hobby way more than the pinball machines. I do.

[08:39] I absolutely could not live without the friendships I've made in the pinball community. I absolutely could

[08:45] live without new pinball machines. We already have enough, right? If we were to say no more games

[08:51] ever again, okay, fine. We've got hundreds of amazing pinball machines available. Well, maybe not

[08:56] hundreds, but at least a good 50 that you could own for the rest of your life and be happy, right?

[09:01] That's the other message that these companies don't want me to say to you is you don't need more games. You don't need to keep chasing after every new release. They don't want you to hear this. They want you to think that every new game you get is going to make your life a little bit more fulfilling. And the truth is, you and I both know, that's not the case. And it's fun though. It's fun to buy these new games. It's fun to think every new game is going to be magical. The truth is there is so little creativity in some of these games. It's comical.

[09:31] At these prices, the lack of creativity is somewhat comical. But hey, for a lot of you out there, all you need is a theme. All you need is artwork and all you need is like friends at those companies and you run after every new game. And I think magic is coming. I do. I think more and more games are going to have to push the envelope, especially at these prices. And that's a good thing. But the people are everything. And I'm really looking forward to supporting the people who support me. And it's a very simple concept. For so many years, everyone's been able to enjoy Canadis Pinball podcast.

[10:01] podcast free of charge, all the haters, all the manufacturers, all the people who love the show. And now I'm going to make show for fans of the show.

[10:09] And you don't have to be a fan. I mean, you could join Patreon and hate my show and just enjoy it.

[10:13] I'm not going to keep anybody from enjoying the show because I know, I know that $5 a month, $16 a day doesn't exclude anybody from enjoying Canada's

[10:24] pinball podcast. And I've got over 300 people that are club members already. You know, last night people were saying, you should charge more for the entry

[10:31] level tier. And I'm not going to do that. They said, make it $10, make it $25. No, I'm not here to do that. It will remain $5 as the entry level. Some people give more, and that's that. And there's nothing more to say on it. And so for everyone out there, it has been really fun doing this show all these years. I know that some people think I'm going to lose my influence if I do it this way. And I want to say to all those people, I don't care. Four years in a row, I made the best pinball podcast on planet Earth.

[11:01] Nobody else can say that.

[11:03] And I'm going to do that for a fifth year and a six year.

[11:05] Even if I don't win these awards, I know that I will be making the greatest pinball podcast on planet Earth because of how this show is.

[11:14] And I really hope, for those of you out there, get inspired by this show.

[11:18] I would love to see more solo pinball podcasters take up a mic and do what this show does.

[11:24] Just speak from the gut.

[11:25] Speak from your heart.

[11:27] All right.

[11:27] And just tell it like it is.

[11:29] And it will be entertaining.

[11:30] There's something very.

[11:31] entertaining when someone is just candid and straightforward with you and not hocking pin stadium lights

[11:38] in a guns and roses machine that doesn't need it. We don't need more of that. Oh, you just got some free

[11:43] pin stadium advertising here, Scott. All right, everybody, have a happy holidays. Have a happy and healthy

[11:48] holidays. I've loved every single moment of this and it's not going to stop. And again, my ultimate message for

[11:55] everybody is this. Every hour you play pinball, you should exercise a half hour. That is my ultimate

[12:00] take away. That is the only thing I hope you take away because I want you guys to be alive

[12:04] for a very long time so we can finally see if Stern Pinball ever does VaultTron. Everybody,

[12:11] later.
