[02:27] The news is flying, the money is drying, the money is drying, and the pin-side babies keep on crying.

[02:57] The news is flying, the money is drying, the money is drying, the money is drying, and the pin-side babies keep on crying.

[03:28] The news is flying, the money is drying, the money is drying, the money is drying, the money is drying, and the pin-side babies keep on crying.

[03:36] 30th I'll tell you why because Canadian's pinball podcast is here to tell you that what I'm hearing is the rumored release date for guns and roses is going to be

[03:48] October first so that is Canadian's pinball podcast

[03:52] Guess on when guns and roses will be revealed. I like this

[03:56] We've got the poor man's pinball podcast saying it's this Friday, which is great

[04:00] But we might both be right because here's what I think is going to happen

[04:05] I think you might see a teaser

[04:08] announcement or or some sort of like

[04:12] confirmation that Jersey Jack pinball's next game is guns and roses this Friday

[04:18] I think they might sneak out something right in front of deep roots big reveal

[04:22] You know they could do something simple like retro atomic zombie adventure lands like who wants to hang out in an

[04:28] Adventure land in a graveyard when you can be in the jungle baby and like that's all I would say is you could totally

[04:35] Punk that entire launch by saying you know where you are deep root you're in the jungle

[04:39] I've also said it would be really funny if Ken Cromwell and the communications team over at Jersey Jack pinball

[04:45] We would like to thank Robert Mueller for thanking Jody Dankberg that there is no competition in pinball get ready to

[04:53] Enter the paradise city baby. You're getting you know something like that like it would be so funny

[04:57] I love all the smack talk happening. I mean there is a lot of smack talk happening now and as I said like when I came back

[05:03] I said look

[05:04] Stern's already hit a home run with Avengers

[05:07] So and they're not even talking any smack and that's like that's the sign of a mature

[05:13] Company a successful mature professional company. They're not talking any smack. They're making money the games are already on the line

[05:22] Avengers will be unboxed probably by the time we even see guns and roses

[05:27] And they're just they're just doing their thing and they're often running everyone else is like talking smack behind the scenes

[05:32] Well, it's not everybody else really

[05:34] I mean, but you have to say that Jersey Jack's teaser video when Ninja Turtles came out like you asked for innovation

[05:40] That's a smack talking a strategy, right? That was a smack talk moment and they never backed it up

[05:45] But I'm here to tell you and you know this I feel so confident that they're gonna back up any smack talk with guns and roses

[05:53] And I can't wait for you guys to see the pin now. There's still people saying I don't think canada seen guns and roses

[05:58] I don't think he has anything on it like he's just lying to you here

[06:02] I'm not gonna spoil the release of the game. I'm gonna give you one very simple fact on the game

[06:07] That's not gonna spoil anything

[06:09] But that will just be proof that canada's been sitting on this game for almost two months and hasn't spoiled it for anyone out there

[06:16] And this is one element of the game where as a die hard guns and roses fan

[06:20] I'm like, ah, you know, I don't know why they did that but it still looks amazing in the artwork on guns and roses

[06:27] And in all the old guns and roses sort of illustrated art

[06:31] Axe Rose was always the red headed frontman of guns and roses, right?

[06:35] Now he goes back and forth between having red hair dirty blonde hair

[06:39] But it's you know for the most part he's known as the Auburn red headed like Irish frontman his name is William Bailey

[06:45] W Axe Rose so in the game itself it was just interesting that on the play field

[06:53] That Axe's hair is blonde and he's in the middle of Duffin slash and that's all I'm gonna say

[06:59] That's all I'm gonna say I would have liked Axe's hair to be red

[07:02] But you'll see you'll see I know why they went blonde with it and it looks amazing and that's all I'm gonna say and I know

[07:07] Some guys like well, of course come on who wouldn't know that who would know that Axe Rose's hair isn't red

[07:13] It's blonde in the game, okay?

[07:14] So eat it all you doubters out there. That's all you're gonna get the game has more than one flipper and more than one

[07:21] Lake cabinet and I can't wait to see this game in action again

[07:25] I talked to someone who has a video of it and they're just gushing over it and it's gonna be real soon

[07:30] I think what's funny is we can honestly say within two weeks

[07:33] We're all gonna get a chance to look at guns and roses. So canada is saying October 1st

[07:39] With a possible teaser this Friday to stick it to deep root. Let's see how that happens

[07:44] We only got two days to go to see if poor man's prediction of Friday is correct or not

[07:48] All right, so that's what's going on in Jersey Jack Pimbal with what we know now

[07:52] Let's go into the rumor mill. Let's talk about what I'm hearing could be the next titles from Jersey Jack Pimbal

[08:00] Everybody knows about Toy Story. There is no there has absolutely no mystery about Toy Story

[08:06] But what is after Toy Story Eric's been done with guns and roses for almost a year

[08:12] What is he currently working on that is gonna be the game after Toy Story now?

[08:18] I'm here to tell you on canada's pinball podcast

[08:20] This is what I'm hearing the game is and it's a big one and it's a jug or not

[08:25] And it's a game that if they get the timing right for once if they finally get the timing right and

[08:31] Release this thing with what's happening in the real world

[08:34] They could have a huge huge hit on their hands

[08:37] Here is what I'm hearing the rumored game is after Toy Story that they inked a deal for and it is the biggest movie franchise in the world

[08:47] returning

[08:49] for its sequel and

[08:51] Trilogy and fourth installment and you guessed it it is avatar

[08:55] So I heard that Jersey Jack Pimbal is working on avatar as their game after Toy Story and so

[09:04] Avatar the movies are coming out they were a little bit delayed

[09:07] But that's great because the movies have been delayed and Jersey Jack Pimbal is always delayed

[09:11] So that is what I'm hearing could be the next game from Jersey Jack Pimbal after Toy Story

[09:16] There's another theme too that I'm gonna throw out there that I know Jack was aggressively going after first

[09:22] Well, let's talk about Avatar because I know some people out there are gonna say well Avatar has been done like why would they do another avatar?

[09:28] Well, look the reality is

[09:30] Avatar came out a long time ago and these new movies are gonna be humongous humongous blockbuster hits and

[09:37] Let's let's face it like the stern version of Avatar never set the world on fire

[09:42] I mean as a decent game not an amazing game and who wouldn't love to see the world of Pandora

[09:48] Brought to life in Jersey Jack format now. What's interesting about the new movie coming out is so much of the new movie

[09:56] Takes place underwater so imagine Jersey Jack Pimbal trying to recreate

[10:02] Something like that like how do you sort of bring that underwater element into a Pimbal machine and maybe do something

[10:09] That's never been done in Pimbal for the first time. I mean I would love a lower play field that actually had like liquid inside it

[10:17] That you you find a way to make something cool happen down there

[10:21] I don't know but I know this who out there wouldn't be excited to see what Eric would do with Avatar

[10:26] Okay, I mean think about all the different ways you could do the you know the colorful black lighting with the world there

[10:31] The underwater surreal like nature the the characters the ships the mechanisms everything about that world of Pandora

[10:39] Could be really really neat with this game all right

[10:42] So we'll Avatar be the game that Jersey Jack does after Toy Story

[10:46] I don't know again. It's a rumor or it's a rumor

[10:49] But you heard it here first on Canadian Spinball podcast the other title then this is when I was interviewing people who were at Jersey Jack Pimbal back in the day

[10:57] The other title that I heard Jack was aggressively pursuing to land the theme and this is a weird one

[11:04] This is a weird one it's an arcade game that Jack wanted to make a Pimbal version of a classic arcade game and Jack

[11:12] Really wanted to get the license for Pac-Man

[11:16] So imagine a Jersey Jack Pimbal Pac-Man Pimbal machine now that I don't get as excited about that

[11:24] We've had that combination with the Pac-Man Pimbal machine before Pac-Man is is it really old franchise?

[11:30] I mean was it 81 maybe 80 and so I don't know I don't know Pac-Mania isn't really

[11:38] Culturally still relevant. I mean Pac-Man took over the world back in the 80s

[11:43] But it really hasn't carried over right like you haven't seen Pac-Man

[11:47] Remain relevant the way Mario has and the way even Sonic the hedgehog has and and Zelda right Pac-Man is still Pac-Man from back in the day

[11:56] And I think Pac-Man speaks to a much older demographic and I also like it could be cool

[12:02] But man I much rather have I'm gonna say it

[12:05] I'd much rather have like a wreck it Ralph Pimbal machine than a Pac-Man Pimbal machine

[12:09] I think there are a ton of Disney themes. I'd rather them go after than Pac-Man

[12:14] So that is the other one that's a rumor now that that just might not happen at all

[12:17] But I know that that's what Jack was thinking of doing and and part of me thinks that that's an actual

[12:24] Fact that he was going after that because Jack kind of still was living

[12:29] He's always like kind of living in the past like he did Pirates the Caribbean

[12:33] simply because

[12:34] The Pirates sold so well for Stern so you know Pac-Man

[12:38] Avatar and the last rumor I want to sort of talk about is the continued rumor about

[12:43] Why there isn't more Pirates of the Caribbean being made and Keifer Keith Johnson went on to pin-side

[12:51] again and explained why this game is not being produced again and he said this on the Buffalo Pimbal stream and

[12:59] And just a paraphrase what he's saying he's like look when the game came out

[13:03] There was no demand for it. I mean the games were sitting and everyone sort of bailed on it after

[13:09] Disgate and after the the treasure chested and open up and the games sat for months

[13:14] I mean you could have walked in and bought a

[13:18] Pirates of the Caribbean Ellie and CE for months. They just sat there

[13:22] They weren't selling people weren't buying it and so

[13:26] Ultimately they made the decision not to order more parts after they made a thousand of the game

[13:32] Then what happens they make a thousand of the game people realize it's a good game

[13:35] It's a deep game. It's a lot of fun for home buyers

[13:37] They considered a masterpiece because of how deep it is and then all of a sudden more than a thousand people want the game

[13:44] And now because people know no more are being made all of a sudden

[13:48] There's all this new demand

[13:49] But what Keith is saying is that when they were available where were you you didn't buy it

[13:56] You didn't want it when you could have it

[13:58] You only wanted it when you couldn't have it and we can't we can't order parts

[14:04] Based upon that kind of consumer reaction now

[14:07] I'm here to tell you right now that what Keith is saying is true and the other thing and this again

[14:12] I learned this in my interview for episode 500 you want to know the real reason why like the real reason why they're not making more

[14:19] Pirates of the Caribbean's and it's it's very similar to what Keith is saying the real reason why and this is again

[14:26] This is what I heard in interviews is that Leonard was annoyed that people didn't buy this game when they had the chance

[14:33] And he has an attitude that's like if you didn't want it when we were making it then screw you

[14:39] We're not making more and some of the reasons why they're not making more is some of that spite of just like you had your chance

[14:46] I gave you the chance to buy it and now now you want it now

[14:51] We have to go remake it all over again just to appease you no

[14:54] And he I think he kind of has his attitude of you know what screw it like the people who supported us and went in on it

[15:01] I'm glad those people now have these super expensive rare games and they're always gonna

[15:06] They're always gonna be rewarded for trusting and believing in my company and everyone else screw you and the reason why all of the people saying

[15:14] They're so stupid for not rerunning it and they can make all this money. Yeah, but here's the thing people

[15:19] He doesn't need the money so I kind of applaud the fact that Leonard is just kind of like you had your shot

[15:26] You passed up on my company is product screw you now

[15:30] I don't need your money

[15:31] We're gonna move on to these next games and maybe in the future you won't sleep on one of our titles and you'll understand

[15:37] You should have trusted us and gone in on it and I think that's the attitude happening over there

[15:42] And I think Keith is giving us like

[15:44] 75% of the reason and that's the other 25% and so they may never

[15:50] Re-run pirates of the Caribbean because they don't have to and they might not care to and that last part's the interesting one

[15:57] They might not care to do it even if you're moaning and groaning you want it so what they don't care

[16:04] And they don't need to care and they gave all of you a shot to get one everyone out there who wants one now

[16:11] You all had a shot to get one. I could easily have gone into like automated and they were sitting on CES

[16:17] In boxes for months for like eight months those games were sitting, okay?

[16:21] So that is why we may never see pirates again. All right deep root pinball rumor mill and deep root pinball

[16:28] So the question is the question is for this reveal happening this weekend

[16:32] What will we see from deep root?

[16:34] Will it be just one game or will we see more than raza this weekend and going into Monday because they have

[16:41] Way more than one game being worked on I mean remember over all the years of deep root

[16:46] They've got J-pop they've got John Norris they've got Barrio and they've got

[16:51] Why am I blanking on the last one Dennis Norman made some games for them?

[16:55] So that's four of these iconic

[16:58] Yesteryear designers now the questions remain do these old guard gentlemen have one more hit in the tank or many more hits in the tank

[17:06] Clearly they know a lot about pinball design, but none of them have had a pinball hit anytime recently

[17:13] I mean the only one really is Nordman with Elvira and he's out at deep root

[17:19] So did he design enough of a game that they have currently now here's the thing

[17:23] Here's what I'm gonna tell you in the rumor mill with deep root pinball now

[17:26] I know for a fact. I know this is not a rumor. I know for a fact that deep root pinball has a juggernaut

[17:34] And I mean juggernaut

[17:36] 80s property

[17:38] License they have a juggernaut one and I think Robert alluded to this

[17:43] Months ago maybe like over a year ago

[17:45] He said like we just found out we secured a license that we're all really excited about and yes

[17:50] They should be really excited about this license this movie is from the 80s

[17:55] It's a movie and all of you love it all of you love it and it is going to be the game when they make it

[18:03] It is gonna be the the theme that you would all buy without even seeing it

[18:07] It's that big of an 80s property and I'll just say this no. It's not gremlins. I'll just start there

[18:12] No, it's not gremlins, okay?

[18:14] So let's stop with the gremlins talk. I'll say this it's this movie takes place between 1982 and 1988

[18:21] Or hey, so we'll start to deduct it down from there

[18:24] I'm not gonna tell you what it is and I'll tell you why I'm not gonna tell you what it is because a few reasons

[18:29] I want to see if they make this part of their reveal this weekend and I want to give them that

[18:35] They they've they've had so many years of building this ship. I don't want to spoil their launch, okay?

[18:41] So I'm gonna give them that now the other part is this I don't I don't want to get sued by Robert and the whole

[18:47] But look again, this is not if I hear what a title is that you're working on and I talk about it

[18:53] You there's nothing there is nothing

[18:56] Illegal about that and sharing rumors, but the problem is this the problem is this

[19:00] I could see them complaining that me putting out their future titles is going to prohibit or or limit their ability to generate

[19:09] excitement and hype for retro atomic zombie adventure land and I whatever it's it's it's not

[19:15] Completely different target audiences for these games now that is why

[19:20] Knowing that they have this juggernaut movie license that they could sell thousands of games off up

[19:26] And they and that's gonna be the plan for that theme like but that's why I think these J-pop games are going to be super limited

[19:34] super rare

[19:35] Super expensive because this is not meant to be the volume driver

[19:40] It's the value driver and by value just price I think this game that we see this Monday or Sunday

[19:47] This one's gonna be for the collector. It's not gonna be for everyone the other one's gonna be for everyone the collector

[19:52] And the mainstream and this and that and it's gonna get a ton of press when they finally bring that game to life now

[19:59] What I haven't heard I haven't heard is like what what's in the game this this juggernaut game

[20:05] But but that again the question I have is is it smart to have such a blockbuster theme and not come out of the gate with that theme

[20:16] It reminds me of launching highway pinball with full throttle when you had alien like why did in deep route

[20:24] Direct everyone's attention to the blockbuster theme and come out of the gates with it because it's a theme

[20:31] That's like just as big as ghost busters like it's it's like that kind of take my money now

[20:36] And so maybe they just want to get you know their feet wet with making the first game like we got to just figure out

[20:44] Manufacturing and what let's let's learn all the mistakes on John's game

[20:48] So when we get to this game

[20:50] It's gonna be the home run knock it out of the park like you know

[20:53] We told you so and I think it's this game that has Robert making all these bullish like brazen comments because he knows

[21:01] He has something that all of you want and and he he needs to get to it though

[21:07] And that's why when I talk to my do get the sense that like we just need to get past raza if people know what we have in the pipeline

[21:14] And we can get there like we can be very successful

[21:17] But you can't avoid the fact that there is no way that the fiscal

[21:22] Balance sheet at deep route is looking good right now

[21:26] How does he make up for all of these years of development when nothing has been manufactured and how do you how do you do that?

[21:35] History has shown us that you know, they're they got a climb out of a big hole right now financially

[21:40] There's just no because nothing's come in. I mean it's years of salaries and rents and R&D costs and nothing's come in

[21:47] Now I'm glad that they finally will have something for sale

[21:51] But the question remains like raza's going to have to be manufactured and out the door to customers

[21:58] Pretty damn quickly after they reveal it and the other thing is the response to it has to be good right people need to open up

[22:06] And find a quality machine you know out in the wild or in their home like if people open up these machines and there's issues

[22:12] And they're not working right that could create real issues now the other thing is we haven't talked about this internet

[22:18] Connectivity with deep route machines will they have internet connectivity?

[22:21] I mean if this is all about innovation and pushing pinball forward

[22:24] I hope they have some sort of internet connected plan with these games all right

[22:28] So that's the thing at deep route you're gonna get raza like just in a few days

[22:32] But they've got something huge and I'm not sure they're going to reveal it yet

[22:36] But I think they might I think they might but they don't even have to show you the game

[22:41] They could just say we have this theme and it's a huge 80s movie that you're all gonna want

[22:45] All right, I can already hear Robert being like don't say anymore Chris don't say anymore

[22:50] But man deep roots gonna be a player if they can get this stuff together Chicago gaming company

[22:55] Oh, I think they need to call this company Cdc

[22:58] Chicago delaying company because I honestly I don't even I'm looking at my notes right now

[23:03] And I wrote nowhere to be found it feels like pinball just isn't Churchill's priority

[23:09] Cactus is the next game then what I wish they had cadence and momentum as a company

[23:15] You know, and I did I emailed Ryan white over at cgc. He said hey Ryan any update

[23:19] Just something to like report on something to talk about nothing you never replied

[23:24] So I don't know what to tell you with with Chicago gaming company

[23:26] I think every like once a year once every 18 months

[23:29] They're gonna swoop in with the game and most likely it's gonna be a game we've seen before and I don't really have much faith that they're getting other stuff together

[23:37] I mean where is it? It's just they're just they're missing out. They're really not even at the party

[23:42] All right, so American pinball. I was trying to find some information on hot wheels

[23:47] So so far like hot wheels has been out since March. It's pretty much a problem-free game

[23:53] It hasn't I haven't really seen many issues with the game

[23:56] It's number 39 right now on the pinside top 100 and people seem to consider it the best American pinball game to date

[24:03] Which is great

[24:03] But one thing I was looking for was just a club thread like is there a club thread for hot wheels because I don't see that many unboxings

[24:11] And I am curious how successful this game is because remember when covid hit and it was really hard to get any game

[24:18] This game was available

[24:19] This game was available for purchase and I just haven't seen that many people pull the trigger on it

[24:24] Do you think hot wheels will have sold a thousand games for American pinball remember that was the cutoff point in which they start making money

[24:32] 1000 games

[24:34] If you were to ask me I don't think it's gonna reach it. I still don't I still don't think there's enough in the game for them to sell a thousand of them

[24:41] Especially when Ninja Turtles pro came out right around the same time and had a lot more in it

[24:47] So we'll see I mean I want American pinball to look at what's been successful

[24:53] And I think they need to go back to putting more in the games and they do need a license theme

[24:58] And I just don't know what's next I really I don't know what's next for them

[25:02] I think they're gonna come out with another original theme and I think that's gonna be

[25:06] Problematic with what's been happening in pinball lately. All right, so Dutch pinball

[25:11] So Dutch pinball we don't talk about them much because they're off there

[25:15] They're quietly getting it done. They are quietly still making these games

[25:19] They are moving into a bigger space so they can hire more people to make faster

[25:25] Big Lebowski's so I'm excited that these guys are finally like getting people their games now

[25:31] I'm not sure how many EA's have gotten their their game who have waited

[25:36] I thought it was like for every 10 or whatever then one EA was going out the good news is this

[25:41] The main difference on these EA games were these amazing aprons they were making that were all

[25:46] They would light up and they were cut out

[25:48] They're going to sell for everyone else that apron just without the words early achiever

[25:54] So if you want that really cool lit up apron for big Lebowski you're gonna get it

[25:58] The one thing they need to do they need to they need to get the code better in this game

[26:01] I mean this game it makes it into collections

[26:04] It's a beautiful game. I would own one

[26:06] But the games too shallow and people get tired of it really fast

[26:10] They need to do that. I think they also need to reengineer some of the stuff in the game

[26:14] That's been problematic for people

[26:16] But what excites me about Dutch pinball quietly figuring this whole thing out

[26:20] Here's what excites me and I don't know though ever get there. I would love to see Barry

[26:25] Make another game they really put a lot into big Lebowski and it's still to this day

[26:31] I think it stands as probably the greatest theme integration of any pinball machine

[26:36] We've seen in the last 10 years and I would I would challenge you to show me another game

[26:42] That is theme integrated as well as the big Lebowski and the best part about it is they really brought the world

[26:49] Under the glass where everyone else is relying on the screen

[26:53] They put it under the glass and we're gonna talk about the screen real quick for a little bit because there was a great thread

[26:59] On pinside this week that that just got a lot of attention

[27:02] But before I do that I want to just talk about spooky real quick

[27:05] Because spooky pinball is continuing to make Rick and Morty and I think they're around like number

[27:10] 250 but I do need to speak directly to spooky pinball right now because they need to make one adjustment on these games

[27:18] They've got like 500 more to make and I think they need to do something in these games

[27:24] To for the rest of the people who buy them moving forward and it's very simple

[27:27] And this should have been caught at the factory. This should have been caught when they were testing the game

[27:32] When you turn up this game to any volume level that and you're gonna want to because it's all about the sound with the denisi game

[27:39] When you turn the volume up

[27:41] The glass on this game

[27:43] Rattles uncontrollably and it sounds horrible and it's annoying and it detracts away from the fun of the game

[27:50] And I know what the solution is everybody does you have to put a piece of like one side it

[27:56] Felt on the rail that the glass slides over. Okay, so that would stop the rattling

[28:02] So okay, so why doesn't spooky pinball do that for us?

[28:06] All right, why does every single person who buys this game have to fix that thing that they should have caught and it's

[28:12] It's I mean how cheap would it be when they're assembling these games

[28:17] To put that one side it felt strip on the rail where the glass slides over let them do it

[28:24] We should not all have to do it because how did they not know this thing rattles like that?

[28:28] Of course it does and you're just gonna pass that headache onto the customer

[28:32] That is the only thing everything else in my game has been bulletproof

[28:35] I've been enjoying it. Yes, it is for sale. I do have a couple interested parties

[28:40] My friend just sold one without butter cabinet for 10.5

[28:43] And so 11.5 is what the asking price is you can have it next week if you want it and I'm just making room

[28:49] It's a fun game. I've given my reviews on it

[28:51] But if you want it can it has got one available number 50 you can have it next week all right

[28:55] So let's end this podcast with this thread. Why is pinball animation so basic right and I'm not gonna go through this whole thing

[29:03] This this sort of kick the hornet's nest with some of pin sides hall of famers. You know who they are

[29:09] They always have to lob their opinions about everything in I would just want to say this right now

[29:13] My feelings on animations in pinball machine are as follows

[29:18] I don't think you need any animations in a pinball machine on a screen. I don't

[29:24] I don't think what's on the LCD is that importing

[29:28] I think there is way too much emphasis on the LCD in all these modern games and some of these modern games

[29:35] The world that's on the LCD is the world we want to see below the glass for me pinball should be a physical analog thing

[29:44] I want to see something underneath the glass that wows me that the ball interacts with and every once in a while

[29:50] I want to glance up to see my score or my progress or a quick cutscene or clip that gets me into the mood or the mode and and sort of set the tone

[30:01] But there's way too much there's way too much desire by some people out there to see all these animations and complex things

[30:08] Happening on a screen where you have to look up and take your eye off of the game itself

[30:13] And I think for me like when you know when people say well Jersey jack pinball's got the best animations in pinball

[30:19] I look at that like yeah, but I also feel like the big screen on a Jersey jack machine has been somewhat of their prison cell

[30:25] And has all of that have has that big screen made Jersey jack games more fun right if you think about the big knock on most of their games

[30:34] It's that they're too confusing

[30:36] There's too much on the screen you walk up to it and you have no idea what to do like good luck

[30:41] Trying to explain to someone who just walks up to a pirates what all those little boxes are little X's are this that it's so confusing

[30:47] And it doesn't add to the game it until you learn it all sure it does

[30:52] But a pinball machine should not have as its back box screen like a dungeons and dragons playing feel that I need to understand

[31:00] All these things before I can start enjoying the experience. I'm sorry. That's not what pinball screens should do

[31:05] And and then when people look at stern games and complain about the animations

[31:09] I think it's ridiculous. I mean, I don't think you need that much animation in a game

[31:14] I think more of the effort should go on the game itself and that's just how I feel

[31:18] I mean look at magic girl. I know it didn't really work

[31:20] But pop a nuke all he had was static images and it didn't matter

[31:25] You were so fascinated by what was on the game itself. All right, so I just want to say everyone out there

[31:31] If you're if you haven't seen it yet go check out dead flips stream of Avengers premium

[31:36] He did it. I believe yesterday or a couple days ago

[31:39] And I will say this is the kind of

[31:42] Avengers stream they should have done from the very beginning jack goes over the whole game

[31:47] He explains the rule sets of the game in a way that like you can follow and it just makes perfect sense to see the game this way

[31:55] For the pinball enthusiasts

[31:57] I've also been hearing other people like talk about the streams. You know I was talking Travis

[32:01] He's got his pinball podcast and he's done two episodes now on pinball streams

[32:05] I think everyone needs to realize one thing

[32:08] If you're not into pinball you are not going to watch a pinball stream

[32:12] You're not going to watch a pinball stream for more than like 10 seconds

[32:15] You're gonna be like why am I watching a pinball stream and you're gonna turn it off

[32:18] We need to stop thinking that these things are designed to broaden the appeal of pinball

[32:23] Did you guys watch like videos on subjects you don't care about or products?

[32:27] You don't care about no nobody does

[32:29] So this desire to like make pinball marketing and streams

[32:34] In a way that has broader appeal is stupid

[32:37] Like this isn't we're not trying to sell phones here or razors

[32:40] We're selling super expensive nerdy toys that should be obsolete to a few thousand men out there women out there

[32:48] Who actually care and only those people will tune in which is why when you tune into these things

[32:54] They can go deep into the geekiness of it because only the geeks of pinball care about any of this

[33:00] I mean I was hearing him you know Travis was saying something like you know like they should really explain to the dummy

[33:06] Like the principles of this thing during the reveal. I'm like no like you would not turn into a Ferrari reveal in a car

[33:13] And they're gonna have to explain to people what horse power is or what torque is like no like and because nobody would watch a Ferrari launch

[33:21] If they weren't into cars so when you get into these

[33:25] Hyper these are like hyper like

[33:28] Passionate verticals like cars and games and watches like if Rolex was doing a stream

[33:34] Are they're like well? There's problem there might be some casual people who don't even like watches watching

[33:38] So maybe we should tell where some of this to them absolutely not

[33:41] So I think Jack danger does do the best job of getting people excited for Avengers

[33:47] I think you should check it out. It made me much more excited for this game than the first stream

[33:52] I think what Stern should do is just do a launch video like a three to five minute launch video showing all the exciting features of the game

[33:59] Then have Jack do what he does best which is

[34:02] Walk you through the game walk you through it like like like a novice learning it

[34:07] But he knows all the rules and he's gonna explain them to you and and when he was doing it all of a sudden

[34:12] I just started to appreciate every aspect of the game more. I started to appreciate the animations more

[34:18] I started to appreciate the callouts the music everything more because I could follow

[34:22] It just didn't feel like this everything in a blender moment in which everything's going all over the place and Raymond's like

[34:28] Just Raymond's going in like circles like Raymond was going all over the place on this game because he wasn't telling you

[34:35] One thing at a time he was just jumping all over the place and that doesn't work

[34:40] Like you can't teach kids and we're kids to a new game. You can't teach us the curriculum

[34:46] You know just flipping through the book and whatever page you stop on where I'm gonna explain what's on that page

[34:50] And that's kind of what he was doing

[34:52] So this is a great stream check it out lots of rumors exciting week for pinball people by this time next week

[35:00] We will have seen a lot about deeproot. We will maybe see a Guns and Roses teaser

[35:04] Canatus pinball podcast episode

[35:07] 507 let's get out of here with some acts of rose

[35:22] I
