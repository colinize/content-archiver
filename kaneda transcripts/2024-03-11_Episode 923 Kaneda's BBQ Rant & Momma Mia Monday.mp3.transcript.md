[00:00] Happy Monday everybody!

[00:22] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast!

[00:24] Are we gonna get Mamma Mia?

[00:26] Look, I love ABBA!

[00:29] We're gonna talk about this, but ABBA to me is like Phil Collins.

[00:33] It's like guilty pleasure music for most of us out there, and it doesn't mean we want

[00:38] to spend pinball money on a themed pinball machine based on ABBA.

[00:43] We're gonna talk about that, we're gonna talk about David Fix.

[00:46] He ushered out the freaking barbecue game like 45 minutes after I did my podcast on

[00:52] Friday.

[00:53] You heard my feelings on Saturday.

[00:55] I'm gonna share them with you right now.

[00:57] You all know you're not buying this game.

[00:59] I mean, come on people, you're not buying this game.

[01:01] And we're gonna talk about the week of T.P.F.

[01:03] Is this gonna be a dud week?

[01:05] Like is the biggest news this week?

[01:07] Is it going to be accessories for the Foo Fighters Pinball Machine?

[01:11] Is that all we're gonna get?

[01:13] Is that the only surprise happening in pinball?

[01:16] Let's start with this Barry O. Barbecue theme.

[01:20] Now look, David Fix has been at the helm over at American Pinball now for like five

[01:25] years in his tenure there.

[01:28] He has delivered to us what?

[01:30] Maybe Hot Wheels?

[01:31] Was that even David Fix?

[01:32] I don't think so.

[01:33] I think that was before David Fix.

[01:35] He did promise he was gonna go back and revisit Hot Wheels and put a loop-de-loop and a jump

[01:41] in it.

[01:42] Remember he did that interview with Mr. Franchi and said, hey, we haven't given up on making

[01:46] this game more spectacular?

[01:48] He never did that.

[01:49] Then he made a deal with Riot Games and he brought Legends of Vahala, the game we'd all

[01:54] not been waiting for.

[01:56] He brought that game to market and I get it.

[01:58] For those people who own it, don't cancel your subscription.

[02:02] I know the game is fun, but let's be honest.

[02:05] Legends of Vahala, is that the game you really want it?

[02:09] And then he brought us the three years in the making, ten years in the making, Colossal

[02:15] Turd that is Galactic Tank Force.

[02:18] It's a game that nobody wanted, it's a game that never should have been made and so then

[02:23] he brings us after all of these bad decisions, why would we ever think that David Fix would

[02:28] make a good decision?

[02:30] His next decision is arguably one of the worst decisions in the history of Pinball.

[02:36] Because he's playing with other people's money, this is how you land on a terrible idea like

[02:42] Barry O's Barbecue Challenge, a game nobody wants.

[02:46] Nobody wants.

[02:47] It's not a game that has anybody clamoring to get their hands on.

[02:51] And I know there's those people out there that are like, Pinball is more fun when we're

[02:55] making original IP games.

[02:58] Is it?

[02:59] Is it more fun?

[03:00] Because if you go back and you look at the 90s, what were the biggest titles?

[03:03] It was not original IP games.

[03:06] If you go back and look over the last ten years, name me some original IP games that have been

[03:11] commercially successful.

[03:13] They've tried it a few times.

[03:15] It didn't work over at Stern with Black Knight.

[03:18] TNA was commercially successful for a little bit, right?

[03:21] They sold like 500 units or so.

[03:23] But then when Spooky Pinball made more, there really wasn't much demand for more TNA games.

[03:29] Dialed In was a disaster for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[03:32] I mean, Pat Lawler spent a lot of time on that game and it was supposed to be like Pat

[03:37] Lawler's greatest hits.

[03:38] It was an absolute sales disaster.

[03:41] And so here we are.

[03:42] Like people don't want original IP games.

[03:45] It's not 1990s anymore.

[03:47] You're not rolling into an arcade and just spending a few bucks on Roadshow or Junkyard.

[03:53] I mean, of course, there was a lot of original IP stuff back in the day.

[03:57] You weren't buying those games.

[03:59] And now that we're buying these games and everything's like over $7,000 now, you really

[04:04] have to ask yourself, do you want it?

[04:06] So they come out with this game, Barbecue Challenge, all right?

[04:10] And we've seen the game.

[04:11] It's empty.

[04:12] This game is empty.

[04:13] This game has half as much in it as a Stern Pro.

[04:16] And yet it's priced the same as a Stern Pro.

[04:18] So you have to have your head examined if you're going to buy this game over a Stern

[04:22] Pro.

[04:23] And not just that, people.

[04:25] You can pretty much almost go get a dialed in, which is a far better game than this for

[04:31] around the price of what this game is, easily around the price of what the L.E. is for this

[04:36] Barbecue Challenge.

[04:37] I get they're only going to make a hundred, but nobody's buying this game for $8,600 or

[04:43] $8,700.

[04:44] Nobody's buying this game for that much money.

[04:46] And they know there's no demand.

[04:49] That's why they're only making 100 L.E.'s.

[04:52] And they're also doing this weird thing where they're trying to say that they made this

[04:56] game to help support Barrio's family.

[04:59] Do you know the truth behind that?

[05:00] That's not what this is about.

[05:02] That's not how it went down.

[05:04] They were going to make this game without Barrio's family's permission, and they caught

[05:08] wind of it, and they got upset, and now they're making them pay royalties for every game sold.

[05:14] So this wasn't like a kumbaya moment between Barrio's estate and the folks over at American

[05:20] Pinball.

[05:21] If we really wanted to help out Barrio's family, we could easily raise more money and

[05:26] do a fundraiser, and that would be much more beneficial than absorbing this turd of a game

[05:32] into the pinball market.

[05:33] And that's just where we're at with this game.

[05:36] We knew it was going to be dead on arrival.

[05:38] It is dead on arrival.

[05:40] It looks just like Hot Wheels.

[05:42] There's nothing going on in this game mechanically.

[05:45] There's nothing interesting happening in this game.

[05:47] Have you seen the code on this game?

[05:49] It's using stock video of barbecue.

[05:52] It's like rotisserie chickens just going with stock video.

[05:55] It is so weird.

[05:57] It is so lazy.

[05:59] It feels like a high school pinball project.

[06:01] I don't get it.

[06:02] I don't even understand who they think is going to buy this game.

[06:06] But I'll tell you this right now.

[06:08] American Pinball is done.

[06:09] They are done.

[06:10] They do not have the talent.

[06:12] They do not have the vision to survive this.

[06:15] This is going to be it.

[06:16] I'm telling you, we're not even going to get to Ryan McQuade's Cuphead game.

[06:21] Even if we do, it's not going to be worth it because this game tells me that these people

[06:26] don't get it.

[06:27] They don't get what anybody wants in pinball.

[06:29] They have no idea what the market wants.

[06:32] It's not just a whiff.

[06:33] They didn't just whiff at the plate.

[06:35] They swung the bat around and knocked off their little wee wee because they're over.

[06:39] They are done.

[06:40] I don't want to see anything else from American Pinball.

[06:42] I'm sorry.

[06:43] And if you're defending them, how can you defend a game like this in 2024?

[06:48] It's a travesty.

[06:50] It's an absolute travesty with where this company started out with Houdini and even

[06:55] Octoberfest was jam packed.

[06:57] How can you go from games like that to this?

[07:00] This is an utter embarrassment and they should be embarrassed to even put this game into

[07:04] the marketplace.

[07:06] And I will fight anyone that thinks otherwise.

[07:08] All right, so that's American Pinball's dead on arrival, burial, barbecue game.

[07:13] By the way, was this Barrio's last design because they list like four other designers

[07:18] like Dennis Norman had his finger on this and so did Ryan McQuade.

[07:22] Are you kidding me?

[07:23] I could have designed this game in my sleep.

[07:25] There's nothing about this design that screams like it took three pinball designers to land

[07:29] here.

[07:30] Come on, this is garbage.

[07:32] Not to mention the artwork is terrible.

[07:34] Not to mention there's no mechanisms in the game.

[07:36] It's absolute a joke.

[07:37] It's just a blank light show this game.

[07:39] All right, I'm moving on.

[07:40] I'm moving on.

[07:41] It's a Monday.

[07:42] I want to be more optimistic.

[07:43] I don't want to be upset.

[07:45] This company upsets me.

[07:46] It enrages me.

[07:47] And the reason why it enrages me, people, is because it's not David Fix's money.

[07:51] The reason why this enrages me is this is Mukesh's money.

[07:54] They are simply sticking their hands in the piggy bank of a guy that's got more money

[07:59] than pinball brains.

[08:00] And that's what he's got because if he had pinball brains, he wouldn't be green lighting

[08:05] this kind of game.

[08:06] And they're abusing that relationship and they're making garbage.

[08:10] All right, Canada, calm down.

[08:12] Let's go on to something else.

[08:13] Let's go on to have a pinball, ladies and gentlemen.

[08:16] The pinball brothers, we knew for a very long time they were going to make a music pin next

[08:21] and it was based on a European musical act.

[08:25] I thought it was Scorpions, When to Change, I Was Wrong.

[08:28] They put out a teaser saying they're going to announce their next game in April and they

[08:32] had an old school helicopter from the 70s.

[08:36] Some people were guessing that it would be MASH.

[08:38] MASH?

[08:39] Why would the pinball brothers from Europe make a pinball machine based on an American

[08:45] TV show from the 70s?

[08:48] That is what?

[08:49] About the Korean War?

[08:50] That hasn't been relevant in like 40 years.

[08:53] Why would the pinball brothers make MASH?

[08:56] Those people who were thinking it was that, I get it because of the helicopter, but no,

[09:00] somebody guessed it right.

[09:01] On an ABBA album cover, they are inside that helicopter and that is what it's going to

[09:06] be.

[09:07] ABBA makes great music.

[09:09] They've sold over 300 million albums.

[09:12] But do you want an ABBA pinball machine?

[09:15] I mean, that's how simple it's become now.

[09:17] With so many games in the pinball marketplace, are you telling me that the next musical act

[09:24] that's going to fill the white space in the world of pinball is ABBA?

[09:28] Now, it's not where I would have gone.

[09:30] It's not where I would have gone and it's not because I don't love their music.

[09:34] It's not where I would have gone because I just think, again, if you look at the pinball

[09:37] buying demographic, we've got more than enough rock and roll stuff.

[09:42] We've got more than enough dad rock filling up the airwaves in the pinball space.

[09:46] The next musical genre that needs to be represented in pinball, if you want to sell to men 40 to

[09:52] 60 years old.

[09:54] These are men that grew up in the 80s and the 90s that now have disposable income.

[09:59] The number one genre that is missing from pinball is hip hop.

[10:04] It is at the point now, how are we flying over hip hop, which just celebrated its 50th

[10:10] anniversary last year.

[10:11] We're ignoring all the hip hop music and we're going to 1970s like disco.

[10:17] Is that really what we need?

[10:19] We just got an Elton John machine and Elton John is a bigger artist than even Abba and

[10:24] Elton John pinball machine is not selling.

[10:27] And here's what scares me about pinball brothers making Abba is do you think they're going

[10:31] to make a game that shoots as well as Steve Ritchie's Elton John?

[10:35] And even though Elton John shoots so tremendously well, if that game was themed Beastie Boys,

[10:41] if it was a hip hop theme, I know it's so weird thinking about hip hop coming from Steve

[10:46] Ritchie, but just go with me for a minute.

[10:48] Imagine if that was an Eminem pinball machine.

[10:51] Imagine if that was like a Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg pinball machine.

[10:54] Imagine if it was like a Tupac or a Biggie pinball machine in East versus West Coast

[10:59] Rap pinball machine.

[11:00] The best way I would do it is I would do a Death Row Records pinball machine.

[11:04] I mean, that's how I would do because then you get Dre, you get Snoop, you get Tupac

[11:09] and it would be amazing.

[11:10] And the other thing you could do after you do Death Row Records, you could do bad boy

[11:14] records.

[11:15] You get Biggie, you get Mace, you get Puff Daddy.

[11:17] I think it would be amazing.

[11:19] Maybe get creative.

[11:20] Like you're a hip hop music mogul and you got to bring the biggest hip hop artists like

[11:25] into the world and you start out small and you progress.

[11:28] I know it's probably really hard.

[11:30] And after hip hop, you know, you want to land on all the pop music we don't have.

[11:34] I mean, there was the biggest rumor for the longest time that Jersey Jack had the permission

[11:39] to do Michael Jackson pinball and they got scared because of the documentary.

[11:43] But where's all the pop music?

[11:45] I said this on my Saturday morning spectacular.

[11:48] All these pinball companies approach Taylor Swift and they wanted to make a Taylor Swift

[11:52] pinball machine and she told them to shake it off and said, no, she's not doing it.

[11:57] Taylor Swift would do well.

[11:58] You know, if I were to think about the pop artists that would do well in pinball format,

[12:02] obviously I think Taylor Swift would do well.

[12:05] I think Madonna, Immaculate Collection pinball machine would do well.

[12:09] I think Michael Jackson would be a no brainer.

[12:11] And if we're going to get more music in pinball and I know it's very divisionary, I still

[12:16] think there are acts like Beastie Boys, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2.

[12:23] I mean, there are some juggernaut acts that we still don't have in pinball format.

[12:28] But personally, I'm over music pinball machines.

[12:30] I just am.

[12:31] As much as I love Elton John as a pinball experience, I would rather that be Top Gun.

[12:37] I would rather that be The Matrix.

[12:39] I want a game that shoots that well, that's based more on a movie property and has more

[12:44] of a storyline and a journey.

[12:46] Look, and again, I just say that because we have too many music pins.

[12:50] I think we've oversaturated it with music pins and I get it.

[12:54] Like if it's your favorite artist, you don't care that there's other music pins.

[12:58] But at some point, this hobby is going to learn a lesson.

[13:01] Like if you just keep doing music pins, it's going to get stale and I think we're there.

[13:04] All right, so that's me predicting that I don't think ABBA is going to be a take my money

[13:09] now kind of game.

[13:10] I'm not sure who's designing this game.

[13:13] And this is going to be the first pinball brothers machine that's been made without

[13:17] Andrew Highway's input.

[13:19] Because remember, Queen Pinball, Alien Pinball, those games were in development during the

[13:24] Andrew Highway days.

[13:26] So I am curious to see who designs it.

[13:29] I'm curious to see what the artwork is because the artwork on Queen is not very good.

[13:34] I'm just curious if the pinball brothers now that it's up to them and nobody else, if they

[13:39] have the creative vision to bring a game to market that's going to be successful.

[13:44] It's about to get really brutal out there, people in the pinball market.

[13:47] Like there's no room for mediocrity.

[13:49] There's no room for 14 companies.

[13:51] There's no room for more music pins.

[13:53] I mean, you either nail it and you hit a theme that people want.

[13:56] You nail it with a gameplay and a code that's just like amazing and an art package that's

[14:01] incredible.

[14:02] Everybody needs to click together to get you to buy a game.

[14:05] I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't really want to buy much new and box

[14:10] anymore forever.

[14:11] I'm just tired of the prices and the bad decisions and the laziness by some of these manufacturers.

[14:18] The ones who are doing it right, you know who they are.

[14:21] But even so, the most vulnerable company in all the pinball is going to be Stern Pinball.

[14:27] If you think about it conservatively, if you just think about it on a conservative number,

[14:32] Stern Pinball makes 500 games a week.

[14:35] That's 24,000 games a year.

[14:38] Every single year they're going to try to make 24,000 games a year and they have to

[14:44] find homes for those games.

[14:46] They have to find distributors who want them.

[14:48] You know, let's talk a little bit about Foo Fighter accessories.

[14:51] It's going to be the topper.

[14:53] It's probably going to be some other stuff.

[14:54] I know people are still waiting on expression lighting from Stern and this topper, is it

[14:59] going to have spinners?

[15:00] I think the topper is going to be $1,000.

[15:03] We're going to see it tomorrow and we know it's going to unlock some new mode in the

[15:08] game.

[15:09] This is Stern's new approach.

[15:10] They're going to want you to buy it because unless you buy it, you're not going to be

[15:14] able to unlock some special mode.

[15:16] What they've been doing with these toppers is giving people a chance to cut to the end

[15:20] of the game.

[15:21] So if there's a final wizard mode in Foo Fighters that you have not been able to get

[15:26] to, I think they're going to allow you a shortcut to play that final wizard mode if you buy

[15:31] the Foo Fighters topper.

[15:33] I mean, that's Stern's MO lately with these toppers.

[15:36] I will say, I think it's going to be nice.

[15:37] The zombie-edied toppers are usually really nice.

[15:40] So I expect a really cool topper to put on top of the machine.

[15:43] The game's also a year old.

[15:45] You know, Foo Fighters, it had a great launch.

[15:48] I think we've moved on to JAWS and other things.

[15:51] We're now starting to think about John Wick.

[15:53] I think Stern Pimbo needs to stop the delay between topper and game.

[15:57] They really need to learn a lesson.

[15:59] Look at Barrels of Fun.

[16:01] They come out with Labyrinth and the topper is available right away.

[16:04] Jersey Jack, the topper is available day one in the box.

[16:08] And why is it the biggest Pimbo company in the world needs an entire extra year to put

[16:14] a topper on top of the game?

[16:16] And one of the problems is by the time they do release it, all the hype on the game is

[16:21] gone.

[16:22] Like everybody who owns a Foo Fighter LE, your machine has now gone down in value like

[16:26] two to three thousand dollars.

[16:28] And are you going to invest more money on a sinking investment?

[16:32] And I know, unless you love the game, you know, unless you want to keep this game forever,

[16:36] you're probably not going to go in on these accessories.

[16:39] The biggest accessory fools were the guys who bought all that extra stuff for Godfather

[16:43] LE.

[16:44] Remember when they sold like the leg ornaments and the topper for Godfather LE?

[16:48] It was like fifteen hundred or eighteen hundred dollars.

[16:51] And those games have tanked in value so much.

[16:54] And if you bought those accessories, you're not getting your money back.

[16:57] All right, so we got Foo Fighter accessories on Tuesday.

[17:00] You know, but I think Stearns and Trouble people, I really do.

[17:03] If the next game is John Wick, here's what I heard.

[17:06] You're going to hear it here first on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[17:09] I'm going to give you a scoop.

[17:10] I know for a fact that John Borg's game is not next.

[17:14] John Borg's game is the game after the next release.

[17:19] So that leads me to believe that John Borg's game might be the new Metallica on Spike 3.

[17:25] This leads me to only two options on John Wick.

[17:28] I think John Wick is either going to be a Keith Elwyn game and they go back to back

[17:33] with Elwyn designs or John Wick is going to be a Jack Danger title.

[17:40] And Pokemon was the code name for the next Jack Danger game.

[17:45] And the reason why Pokemon, like Pokemon, you know, like shooting men, shooting Mons,

[17:50] whatever it is, got to catch them all as more of a reference to John Wick having to catch

[17:55] all of the bad guys that murdered his dog.

[17:58] So I'm going to make the prediction right now on Canada's Pinball Podcast that I think

[18:02] the next game from Stearn, it's going to be John Wick.

[18:05] And I think it's going to be designed by Jack Danger or Keith Elwyn.

[18:09] Now if they go back to back with Keith Elwyn, that doesn't really make sense because he

[18:14] just had Jaws come out and we know he's a prolific designer.

[18:18] But it doesn't make sense to me because if it goes Elwyn Elwyn Borg, then Jack Danger

[18:24] has to wait almost two years to get another game out.

[18:27] And I don't think they're going to treat Jack that way, especially after Foo Fighters sold

[18:32] so well.

[18:33] Now maybe because he's a new designer, he needs more time.

[18:37] Maybe that's the case.

[18:38] But man, I'm just going to make a guess and say that I think John Wick is Jack Danger.

[18:43] Alright, what else is happening in Pinball, Canada?

[18:46] Well, we're going to get more this week as Texas Pinball Festival happens.

[18:49] I don't think there's going to be any big surprises at the show.

[18:53] The other game I saw coming out is this homebrew game by Tilt Bob, the road show game.

[18:59] It looks like a wide body.

[19:00] I just saw a video of them flipping it with no music, no lights, no code, no nothing.

[19:05] It's just a physical ball rolling around the game.

[19:09] And again, people, I don't have a problem with people making these things.

[19:13] I just don't know who's buying them.

[19:15] And if you're going to go through all the effort to do this, that's fine.

[19:18] You know, it's on you.

[19:19] You're not going to get my money.

[19:21] But I just wish if people were going to go through all of the effort to make a game,

[19:25] you got to get a license.

[19:26] You can't make original IP games.

[19:29] You can't try to get people to buy these things for $5,000 to $6,000.

[19:33] If it's the same price of a Stern Pro, but not better than a Stern Pro, nobody's going

[19:38] to buy it.

[19:39] If you're comfortable selling just like 27 units after you put in all that hard work,

[19:45] that's on you.

[19:46] But I think this is going to be a brutal year for everybody that makes mediocre games.

[19:52] And I think it's going to be a tremendous year if we see stuff like the Matrix from Jersey

[19:57] Jack, if we see Back to the Future from Dutch Pinball.

[20:00] And those are the two big ones.

[20:02] Like I don't have anything else on my radar that I think is going to be as big as those

[20:06] two games.

[20:07] And that's what I'm saving my money for.

[20:09] Anything else?

[20:10] I'm just going to watch it come out.

[20:11] I'm going to watch all of it come out.

[20:13] I'm going to try to play as much of it as I can on location.

[20:16] I think a lot of us are going to go back to playing pinball on location and only buying

[20:22] the magical games where the theme and everything is there for us.

[20:26] Everybody have a great Monday.

[20:28] We will talk to you soon.

[20:29] Thank you for being a club member.

[20:31] And I know, I know that each and every one of you is going to do the right thing and

[20:35] wait for the magic.

[20:37] Don't chase these new and box prices.

[20:39] Put the pressure on these companies and these distros to either lower the prices or make

[20:44] more magic later.
