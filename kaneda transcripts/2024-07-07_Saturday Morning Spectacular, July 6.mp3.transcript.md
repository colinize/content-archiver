[00:00] What can I say except you're welcome for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:07] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome.

[00:11] I'm just an ordinary, daily guy.

[00:13] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:17] Welcome everybody to the Saturday morning spectacular where I guarantee you on this show,

[00:24] I'm not gonna talk about Harry Potter being next from Jersey Jack.

[00:28] What a terrible week for Canada.

[00:31] I mean, when you think about it, I've got some of the rumors wrong.

[00:35] I get most of them right, but man, oh, man, oh, man, did I get duped on this Harry Potter

[00:42] homebrew game that had like a quarter of the pinball population thinking that was the next

[00:49] game from Jersey Jack?

[00:50] And what an idiot I am once I saw those photos where the castle is like 18 inches above the

[00:59] glass.

[01:00] It's like unless J-pop made a new deep cabinet, there's no way this game was ever gonna work.

[01:07] And I know it's a homebrew game and it looks like a Jersey Jack game with all the lights

[01:12] and whatnot and the artwork.

[01:14] But man, that throws a monkey wrench into what's coming in 2024.

[01:21] And now I think all of us are realizing that 2024 isn't gonna be what we thought it was

[01:30] supposed to be Harry Potter versus Pokemon versus Back to the Future.

[01:34] Now none of those games are coming out in 2024.

[01:38] So we're gonna talk about what's going on in pinball right now.

[01:41] I want to talk to people here.

[01:42] I want to know what you guys are thinking.

[01:45] And I want to tell you guys right now, I want to make a prediction to what I think is gonna

[01:50] be the game of the year.

[01:51] Are you ready for it?

[01:52] And I don't even know if there's gonna be game of the year unless we get some award shows back.

[01:56] So hopefully the pinball content creators can kind of work together to figure out one award

[02:03] show.

[02:03] You know, now that Zach and me and Colin are all talking again and everything's fine and

[02:09] everything is fine.

[02:10] There's no drama anymore.

[02:11] It is amazing when grown men just extend a hand and say, hey, let's just squash it and

[02:18] move on.

[02:19] And it's been great ever since.

[02:21] I know all of them are having a better time this way and I know I am as well.

[02:25] So maybe we can come together and actually create an award show in which all the people

[02:31] are represented, all the companies are represented and there's only one, right?

[02:36] So we don't have to like compete with each other.

[02:38] I think it would be fine.

[02:39] And here's what I would recommend.

[02:41] I would recommend going back to the original formula.

[02:45] If they can't get the live show together, then just do it like it was year one and have Greg

[02:52] and Zach host it, let people vote and just do it online.

[02:57] I mean, you're going to get more people watching on the internet than you ever would at a live

[03:02] show and then you would save everybody the money of having to fly to Texas to see it.

[03:08] But if you want to do it at TPF, I would love that as well.

[03:11] All right.

[03:11] So here's the thing.

[03:13] Here's my prediction for game of the year.

[03:15] I'm telling you right now that Stern's next cornerstone game is going to be Jack Danger's

[03:23] game.

[03:23] That's right.

[03:24] You heard it here.

[03:26] Chris Arcades, my followers on the club heard it first that Jack Danger is next.

[03:32] It is not John Borg with a cornerstone.

[03:34] If anything, there will be a Metallica remake.

[03:38] There's going to be a Godzilla 70th remake.

[03:41] But Jack Danger is the next Stern machine.

[03:46] He's also not making Pokemon next.

[03:50] So if you think Pokemon is next, I think you're wrong.

[03:54] I think Jack Danger's game is going to be X-Men 97.

[04:00] I think it's going to be X-Men 97.

[04:02] I think maybe got to catch them all or collect them all is basically in reference to getting

[04:09] all the different X-Men together.

[04:11] And I think Jack Danger X-Men with Zambietti on artwork with the show being phenomenal.

[04:20] My prediction is X-Men 97 will be the game of the year.

[04:26] It will beat out Elton John, which is a great shooting game, but not enough people

[04:32] will vote for Elton John.

[04:34] Elton John just is very expensive.

[04:36] We're going to talk about the collector's edition that just went up for sale for $13,000.

[04:43] And I know the inner art blade is damaged, but man, $2,000.

[04:48] It's a $50 part at most.

[04:50] Takes about a half hour to change out the inner art blade.

[04:53] So yeah, I think we're starting to see what I've been predicting

[04:58] that all of these games after a year are going to lose like anywhere between $3,000 to $5,000,

[05:03] especially with these high starting prices.

[05:07] So for Daniel, who just said X-Men might sell 200 units, I think you're 100% wrong.

[05:14] I think X-Men 97 will be a sales juggernaut.

[05:19] And if you think about it, yeah, we've had a lot of Marvel themes, but man, X-Men 97 is just classic.

[05:26] It's iconic.

[05:28] It's a throwback and it's done right.

[05:30] And that's the other thing is the show itself is absolutely incredible.

[05:35] And I think if Jack Danger makes it and they make it right,

[05:39] a lot of people would much rather have X-Men 97 than Jaws than Venom.

[05:46] Nobody wants John Wick.

[05:48] Nobody.

[05:49] I mean, let's talk about this for a minute because I'm watching the John Wick marketing efforts and

[05:54] it's over.

[05:55] Like it's absolutely over.

[05:56] I don't know about you, but when I watch people talk about collecting these achievements and the contracts on 4th of July weekend,

[06:05] it's like, yeah, it makes sense to have a 4th of July stuff for Jaws.

[06:09] But who cares about collecting John Wick like items on Insider Connected?

[06:16] John Wick is going to go down.

[06:19] I mean, this one, I say this people, John Wick

[06:22] will be, I think, one of the most like

[06:27] tanking stern games ever.

[06:28] What I mean by tanking, I think John Wick is going to hold less value than almost any modern stern.

[06:37] I think you're going to see John Wick LEs for $5,000 less within just like six months, not even a year.

[06:47] It is a game that will come and go with very, very low interest.

[06:54] Will it do worse than WWF?

[06:56] Yes, it will.

[06:58] Because even WWE, it's not WWF, even that game, they sold all of the LEs.

[07:07] And even that game, I mean, seriously, when you look at WWE,

[07:13] it still has more interesting stuff in it than John Wick.

[07:19] And the more I look at John Wick, I'm sorry, but, you know, Elliot is this mechanical engineer.

[07:27] Where's the mechanical engineering in John Wick?

[07:32] Why does the game look so rushed?

[07:35] It looks so phoned in from a mechanical standpoint.

[07:39] Why does the game even exist?

[07:42] And that's my point about John Wick.

[07:44] The more I see it, the less interested I get in it.

[07:49] Because it's like nobody really asked for it.

[07:52] And I think Stern developed it when John Wick was more popular than it is now.

[07:58] What Chris doesn't love.

[08:00] Okay, so here's the thing.

[08:01] It's like, I just think this game, it reeks of Stern doing zero market research.

[08:09] And look, the market is speaking.

[08:11] Nobody's really buying the game.

[08:13] You'll play it on location.

[08:15] You'll have fun on location because it's fun knowing that you don't have to spend,

[08:19] you know, seven to $13,000 on a tanking game.

[08:24] It's absolutely going to tank.

[08:26] And so that's why I think Jaws isn't going to win Game of the Year.

[08:30] It's not because Jaws gets compared to Keith Elwin's other games.

[08:35] And as good as Jaws is, it's no Godzilla.

[08:39] I don't even think it's as good as Iron Maiden.

[08:42] I think Jaws is good.

[08:44] I think it's a good Jaws pin.

[08:46] I think the thing with Jaws is this.

[08:48] It's as good as Jaws could be given the source material.

[08:53] Jaws is a very slow movie.

[08:56] It's a little monochromatic in what's going on in the movie.

[08:59] But Jaws is done really well.

[09:01] And look, Clint, yeah, Jaws is not Keith Elwin's best game.

[09:06] It is not Keith Elwin's best game.

[09:08] It is like, I would say if I had a rank Keith Elwin's games,

[09:11] I would go Godzilla, Iron Maiden, then Jaws, then I would go actually,

[09:22] yeah, you know, I would go, yeah, I would do that.

[09:26] I would do Godzilla.

[09:28] I would do Iron Maiden.

[09:30] Actually, no, I'm going to start.

[09:32] I'm going to go back again.

[09:33] I would actually go Godzilla Jurassic Park because Jurassic Park theme is so good.

[09:39] Then Iron Maiden, then Jaws, then Avengers, and then did I miss Jurassic?

[09:47] No, what am I missing here?

[09:50] Am I missing one?

[09:51] I think I am.

[09:53] What am I missing?

[09:54] Anyway, they're all good.

[09:56] Bond 60th.

[09:57] No, Bond 60th is dead last.

[09:59] Here's the thing.

[10:00] All of Keith Elwin's games are really good.

[10:04] And Jaws might win Game of the Year because Elwin's got such a fan base.

[10:08] But, you know, look, great games, great games.

[10:11] You can't go wrong with a Keith Elwin game other than Bond 60th.

[10:16] Bond 60th will always go down as the worst buy ever.

[10:22] You know what's the interesting thing about Avengers Gang?

[10:25] Is Avengers, I think, is maybe Keith Elwin's best shooting game?

[10:31] I'm going to say it.

[10:32] I think Avengers is Elwin's greatest shooting game.

[10:37] I think the game shoots so awesome.

[10:40] I think the mechs are cool.

[10:41] I think the ramps and the habit trails are awesome.

[10:44] I love the way the ball moves around that play field.

[10:48] And I absolutely hate the code in the game.

[10:51] I think Ray Day's code in Avengers is like the worst because it's so damn confusing.

[11:00] And when you play Avengers, it just doesn't bring you on a ride.

[11:06] That's very exciting or interesting.

[11:08] It's way too complex.

[11:11] It's way too unemotional.

[11:13] It's way too sterile.

[11:15] And I think it just kills it.

[11:17] It just kills it.

[11:18] Like when I think about the Avengers and all these amazing superheroes,

[11:25] I want to feel like I'm assembling this team of badasses and we're going to go save the world.

[11:32] And I just don't in that game.

[11:34] I just I feel like it's all over the place.

[11:37] So all right, so Game of the Year, though, here's my prediction.

[11:40] I just predict that Jack Danger's next game is going to be Game of the Year.

[11:44] Because I still think Jaws is a little bit polarizing on the theme.

[11:48] And I think Jack Danger's game is going to be newer and fresher when we get to the end of the year.

[11:54] Now, that being said, if you asked me two weeks ago,

[11:57] I would have told you that Stern Pimball is not going to win 2024.

[12:02] They're very vulnerable with John Wick being a total flop.

[12:05] And someone's going to take advantage of Stern's like weak moment in the market.

[12:10] And here we are.

[12:11] Stern's having an incredible weak moment in the market and nobody's taking advantage of it.

[12:18] And right now, nobody's hitting with anything.

[12:20] Absolutely nothing.

[12:22] There is nothing exciting happening as far as like new stuff in Pimball right now.

[12:28] Funhouse remake, nobody really cares.

[12:31] Abba Pimball, nobody really cares.

[12:34] Waiting three years to get your Pulp Fiction, nobody cares anymore.

[12:39] It's just going to be a topper.

[12:41] I mean, I don't know what people think is going to happen when you get your Pulp Fiction LE.

[12:46] Like, do you really think you're going to have a dramatically different experience

[12:51] than the people that have been streaming this game for like a year, a year and a half?

[12:55] I mean, it's the same game.

[12:57] Same playfield, same everything.

[13:00] I get it.

[13:00] I've seen the topper.

[13:01] I've seen the dance moves.

[13:03] I've seen it all.

[13:04] It's not going to make the worth, wait, it's not going to make the weight worth it is what I wanted to say.

[13:11] So like, here we are, 2024, July, and nobody, right?

[13:18] Nobody's hitting.

[13:19] Now look, what's exciting though is that it's going to be Jack Danger's second game versus Mark Sidon's first game over at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[13:32] Now this is a big moment.

[13:34] I mean, think about it.

[13:36] When was the last time Jersey Jack Pimball ushered out a brand new designer?

[13:43] Joe Balser did the first few games over there.

[13:47] Pat Lawler was over there.

[13:49] Eric Minier's first game, huge first game launch that they botched, right?

[13:53] Remember when Pire to the Caribbean launched?

[13:56] Everybody wanted one.

[13:58] And then they made us wait like 10 months for the game and they took out the two major mechs in the game and then nobody wanted it.

[14:07] So that was Eric's first game.

[14:10] And then Steve Richie's not new.

[14:12] And so you haven't really had a rookie designer over at Jersey Jack

[14:18] who's been working on a game now for three years.

[14:21] Now here's my thing.

[14:22] Now that we know that Mark Sidon's been working on this game for three freaking years, I mean, just think about how many days that is, right?

[14:32] That is like over a thousand days of walking into a Pimball company and being able to design something that us customers get to enjoy one day.

[14:45] And if it's your first game and you want to make a name for yourself and you've had three years of effort to put into the game,

[14:54] how can our expectations of this Mark Sidon game not be like through the roof?

[15:01] Now my worry about all of this is simply this.

[15:04] It's like when did Pat Lawler actually leave Jersey Jack?

[15:09] When did Pat Lawler's influence stop at Jersey Jack?

[15:14] Because Pat Lawler is the reason why a lot of these games got stripped down.

[15:20] Because Lawler wanted to be Lawler of old.

[15:24] He wanted to walk around all these like locations and see his product everywhere, the way he did with Adam's family.

[15:32] And so then he wanted to make Jersey Jack be an operator friendly game.

[15:37] And that's why we saw a lot come out of the games because of Pat Lawler.

[15:43] And now that he's gone, I think they're going to put a lot more back in it.

[15:46] I mean look, Elton John is pretty empty people. I mean, lift the playfield on it. It's pretty damn empty.

[15:52] I mean, it's like half as much as in that game as games like Hobbit and Wizard of Oz and Dialed In.

[15:59] Like we know it's empty. Like there's no fooling. It doesn't mean it doesn't shoot well.

[16:03] But everyone needs to sort of realize that the fastest shooting game with the greatest flow in the history of Pimball

[16:11] would just be a blank playfield with flippers. I mean, nothing would flow better than that.

[16:17] So, you know, you really can't take flow and then try to charge a lot of money.

[16:23] GNR would have had more drops. Yes. So in Guns N Roses,

[16:27] there was a drop bank target in front of the scoop, which would have changed the dynamic on the game.

[16:35] You know, even as I think about the game now, though, I'm not sure that would have made the game better.

[16:40] Having played Guns N Roses now for a while, I think a big drop bank target there would have bricked the ball

[16:47] and it's too close to the flippers to have that there. Now, what would have been great was the subway system in GNR

[16:55] because what was supposed to happen is when you go to the backstage area,

[16:59] that was also a scoop into a subway that would return the ball to the right flipper.

[17:07] So I think that would have been awesome. And of course, the subway system in the upper left would have been cool too.

[17:13] And I think missing that from GNR, I do think like change the ability to make the game flow

[17:20] the way the designer wanted the game to flow.

[17:24] So look, Mark Siden's game. Let's talk about it for a minute, people. What do we think?

[17:28] I want to hear from you right now. What do you think

[17:31] Mark Siden's game is going to be? And I'm going to read your responses right now.

[17:37] You know, the rumor was like Matrix or Muppets or this or that. I really have no idea. I do believe

[17:45] that the feedback I got was if you warm up to the theme,

[17:50] you're going to love it. J Sellers, welcome to the party. Canada's going to have a sip. Dave says it's Muppets.

[17:56] Albert says it's Metroid, which is the homebrew he made. It's not going to be Metroid.

[18:02] Matrix 4, said Robert Bush.

[18:07] Colin said Frozen. It's not going to be Frozen, but that is funny. I mean, Frozen would sell.

[18:16] You know, that is crazy. It's crazy when you think about it because, you know, we can make fun of the fact

[18:23] that someone said Frozen. Colin said Frozen, but Frozen would outsell almost anything.

[18:29] Hold on. I'm just going to wipe off my ready player one book cover. I put the drink on it,

[18:34] and it's kind of making it wet. Here we go. Okay. Barbie, Silver Spoon, Avatar. What else we got here?

[18:44] You know, Pac-Man was one that was rumored. I just, what I know is this. It has to be a hit theme.

[18:55] I mean, we've gone three in a row that is not Take My Money Now from Jersey Jack, right? Godfather,

[19:03] Toy Story 4, and Elton John. All of those are not Take My Money Now themes. All of them.

[19:10] You know, and I think what happens next is going to be pretty critical for Jersey Jack because,

[19:17] and I don't mean critical because they need the money, because they don't need the money.

[19:21] I just mean from a brand standpoint. Like, I want to see the brand do well.

[19:26] Eric Peterson, welcome to the party. I want to see the brand do well. I would love a Super Mario

[19:31] Brothers from Jersey Jack, pinball. If they made a Jersey Jack Super Mario Brothers game,

[19:37] and it had the green sewer pipes, and then you go into the lower play field,

[19:45] it would absolutely crush. And then you've got the upper play field, you know, with the bricks

[19:52] that you smash. Can you imagine a Vuck that just kept shooting up into a brick and it made that

[19:58] noise? And even if you just make it so it's like contained so the ball can't go out from underneath

[20:03] the brick. But imagine that. I mean, you all of us, we could sit in a room. And in just a few hours,

[20:11] we could ideate the greatest Super Mario Brothers pinball machine of all time.

[20:18] Jersey Jack could make it. And no, not Mario Kart. Why the heck would you want to play Mario Kart

[20:26] in pinball form, Albert? That doesn't make any sense. But Mario Brothers makes sense.

[20:33] Because you're moving through the world like Mario Kart does not make any sense. I don't

[20:38] want to play a racing game as a pinball machine. The same way I don't want to play a first person

[20:45] shooter as a pinball machine, because it makes no sense. The reason why Super Mario Brothers makes

[20:52] sense is the entire game is about bashing things. And a pinball machine bashes things. And it's just

[21:00] that simple. So I think that would be great. That would be take my money now for sure. But it's

[21:07] not going to be that. It's not going to be that. I'm drinking Baraka, dropped into some ice cold

[21:13] water. It's great. I really think we're going to see this game around the same time we see Jack

[21:18] Danger's game. And that's going to make for a very interesting fall into winter. Because you're

[21:26] going to have Jack Danger versus Mark Sidon. These silly Pulp Fiction elites are finally going to

[21:34] come out. And then you're going to have the next game from Spooky. I mean, people forget Spooky's

[21:42] next game is going to be fall winter. And then we're also going to have Alice in Wonderland.

[21:50] So Alice is going to be new stuff. I would also have to imagine that over at Barrels of Fun,

[21:58] there's got to be the discussion. We've got to just cap, you know, these labyrinth games. I don't

[22:04] know. You know, there's something about like a year to build all the labyrinths. I just want to talk

[22:10] about this for a minute. It's just too long. I'm sorry. One game a year. I get that's what

[22:17] boutiques are going for. But man, it's just boring. It's just, you don't understand, it's just

[22:22] boy, it's like, yeah, like I get it. Like I get it. That's all you can make. But man, it's like,

[22:30] I don't know, like there's nothing left or interesting to talk about. It's like having the same

[22:36] movie in the theater all year round. And if you're going to do that, then you got to make it a movie

[22:45] you want to see over and over and over again. I just don't feel that way about labyrinth. I never

[22:53] did from day one. I don't like the theme. I get it. I get why people would like it. But I guess I

[23:00] was just one of those more alpha males when I was a young kid watching wrestling, watching Hulk Hogan,

[23:08] you know, watching Rowdy Rowdy Piper. I guess I was a little younger when labyrinth came out,

[23:13] but I was watching other stuff. It wasn't really a movie that made its way into my sort of circle

[23:21] of films that I wanted to watch over and over and over again. And I don't know anyone who felt that

[23:26] way about labyrinth either. I mean, I went to school with, I was born in 76, I child of the 80s, 90s,

[23:34] like, I don't know, I just never hung out with any of my guy friends. And when I was a kid, no one

[23:40] was ever like, let's go watch labyrinth. I just never heard anybody say that, like ever. In fact,

[23:47] I don't even think I even saw the movie back in the day. I just don't. And so like, I, but I understand

[23:54] for some people, it left an indelible impression. Now I will say this, if I had seen that movie,

[24:01] when I was a little boy or, you know, seven or eight years old, I actually think the main thing

[24:07] would have been Jennifer Connelly would have been the most exciting thing from the movie, right?

[24:12] And she's not even in the game. So it's like, I don't want to look at David Bowie's bulge. I just

[24:17] don't. I would like, I would rather have blood sport. I would rather have die hard. You know,

[24:24] big trouble. Karate kid, you know me, you know what I want, never going to get it.

[24:30] Never going to get it. One day I'll get it. But you know, right now, I think John Wick is a wake

[24:36] up call. I think, uh, Ultraman's a wake up call. I think, uh, you know, I don't know. Did Spooky

[24:44] even sell out of Looney Tunes and Texas chainsaw massacre? Like, can you go on Spooky's website

[24:52] right now and order both of these games? I think you can. I don't think either sold out. You can

[24:58] still go on to Jerseyjack.com right now and buy an Elton John collector's edition. Let's talk about,

[25:08] let's talk about this CE for sale. So, you know, Elton John is a great game. It's a great game

[25:14] because it's basically Steve Richie's recycled great layout. Like you take a great layout,

[25:20] which he used in Star Trek elements from Spider-Man, you know, all the, he knows how to make a game

[25:27] shoot great. So he's taken like the best hits in terms of flow and he's put it into Elton John and

[25:35] it makes the game play great. Right? There's not a ton of other stuff in it. The music is great. It's

[25:41] Elton John music. The light shows phenomenal. Uh, the experience is a lot of fun. That being said,

[25:48] right, that being said, it's still not a take my money now theme for most people. Um, let me just

[25:54] say something about Australia. Okay. Because Shannon's like Elton John is sold. Like everything

[26:00] sells out in Australia because you get freaking 15. You get 15 Elton John collectors edition

[26:08] in Australia. All right. There's 985 more in the world. And the fact that you guys like spend

[26:17] like, like, like freaking Elton John CE in American dollars is like $25,000 for these guys over. Like

[26:29] these guys are nuts, nuts. Wow. You got 50 out of 900. So there's 950 more shins. It's like,

[26:39] I actually, when I hear about Australian pinball collectors, I feel bad because

[26:47] you would be much better off just buying a place in America as a second home and storing all your

[26:55] pins there and maybe having just one or two locally because you're spending, it's cheaper for you to

[27:02] fly over here and just play the games here. It doesn't make any sense. You know, like, I don't

[27:08] know. It's just something with when I see an Australian price of a pinball machine, are you guys

[27:13] making like that much more money? I don't get it. Like, I really don't get it. But anyway,

[27:18] like the fact that Jersey Jack said they're going to make 1000 and you go into the owner's club and

[27:24] yeah, so everyone's enjoying the game. No, no issues there. Games are got good quality. They're

[27:30] not breaking down, but there's a thousand of them. And that's the part like a thousand of them.

[27:36] And so Jersey Jack has gone on the record and said they're making all 1000 games. And when I hear

[27:44] that, I'm like, all right, who's buying them all? That's my point is you don't see a lot. And I mean

[27:51] this, you don't see a lot of unboxings of Elton John collector's edition. And here's the part we

[28:01] don't know how many of these are going to stay in Jersey Jack's personal inventory, like their own

[28:08] inventory, how many of these are going to be sitting at dealers and how many are actually sold

[28:15] to customers. Now that's just something I've been thinking about. And I would say like, I don't think

[28:22] they've sold more to customers. I don't know. What do you think like 600 at most at this point?

[28:32] I don't know. I don't I mean, it's hard to tell everything's just a guess, but they're not hard

[28:38] to get. And now that we saw one used with a inner art decal destroyed, which is like, because the

[28:45] fool opened up the play field without putting on the plastic protectors. And yeah, I don't know why

[28:50] you would do that. The game quite clearly tells you to use them. They come with every game that you

[28:57] can't miss them. They're huge. They're the size of the entire cabinet. So like, yeah, like, I don't

[29:04] know. Like, but if you want to fix that issue, it's easy. And so the fact that this guy's selling

[29:11] it for 13, that's a good deal, I guess. But look, I think if they make all 1000 of them,

[29:18] and Mark Sidon's game is, I don't know, just got more appeal to the pinball buying demo.

[29:24] I think we could see them, you know, Elton John prices. I think they're, look, I think they're

[29:28] going to settle, you know me, I think they're going to settle around 12 for a CE. And I think it's

[29:34] going to settle around like 9000 for a platinum. I just think that's where it's all at people. I

[29:41] think all of these games are two to $3,000 overpriced, all of them, all of them. And I think they

[29:48] all slide down back to that number. And it's just like, it's just where we're comfortable

[29:54] buying pinball machines, right? It's like, I don't want to spend more than 10 to 12 on an

[29:59] Ellie or a collector's edition. I don't ever want to spend more than 10 on a stern. I mean,

[30:04] sternly is a $9500 game at most. Everybody knows that. Because think about it. And then they want

[30:10] you to buy a thousand or $2,000 topper, they want you to accessorize it. And you could do that.

[30:15] You could do that. You could drop $15,000 on a Foo Fighter Ellie. Just think about that for a minute.

[30:23] 15 grand for a Foo Fighter Ellie. There's a thousand of them out there. And you could do that,

[30:29] and then your games were a 10 grand at the end of the year. So like, I wouldn't do that. Do you want

[30:34] to lose five grand? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe some people do. So like, I think it's going

[30:41] to be a buyer's market for a long time in pinball, as long as these prices stay this high.

[30:46] Every once in a while, a Back to the Future or a Harry Potter will come out and justify the high

[30:54] prices. But most games won't. And I think that's going to be the hard lesson or the hard hill to

[31:00] climb for all these companies. Now, speaking of hill to climb, let's talk a little bit about

[31:05] Multimorphic. We don't really talk about them. I mentioned Jerry. I put up a Steve Jobs video,

[31:11] or Steve Jobs video, however you want to say it, in which he talks about innovation. And you know,

[31:17] you got to figure out what kind of innovation is going to help you sell product at scale.

[31:23] And even though you can innovate to do some things well, it's not necessarily the right way to go

[31:30] unless you create something that a lot of people want. And I know we've been going back and forth

[31:36] on this for years, really, because it's like, you know, Multimorphic has decided to make a platform

[31:43] that is completely different than anybody else in the market. And it's been around for about a decade.

[31:50] And, you know, Jerry is not altering the course. And that's fine. Like it's his prerogative. He can

[31:57] do what he wants. I've interviewed Jerry over the years. I know everything their strategy is about.

[32:03] I know, you know, and they finally got licensed themes, which has helped. But man, it's like,

[32:09] you know, why? That's my whole thing is, when you look at the pinball buying demographic and you

[32:15] do market research, you're not going to land on a place that most people want these swappable

[32:22] play fields and these like modular systems. It's been tried many times. And because what you sacrifice

[32:34] for what you gain is not worth it to the majority of pinball buying people. That's all it comes down to.

[32:45] There's pros and cons, of course, but I don't want to give up this to get this.

[32:52] Like I don't want to have to store this somewhere. I don't want to give up the beautiful play field

[33:00] artwork when my game is off because most people who buy games and especially collectors, they don't

[33:10] play them. They walk by them. They light them up. They drink whiskey, but they don't really play their

[33:19] games a lot. And they love walking by and just seeing them in all of their beauty when the game

[33:26] is turned off. They don't want a big black TV screen looking back at them. And then even like the

[33:33] front of the multi-morphid cabinet is all black. Now they're now they're accessorizing it, but now

[33:38] it also doesn't make sense because you can order a Princess Bride and it has Enrigo Montoya's swords

[33:46] like stuck to the side of it. So then that doesn't make any sense because those don't come on and off.

[33:52] Do they? Then you've got to store those swords when you're playing Lexi Lightspeak because then

[33:58] now you've got like a dedicated cabinet to and if Jerry just made the Princess Bride as a normal

[34:07] pinball machine, he would sell three to one versus his platform because when you buy into the platform,

[34:16] you kind of have to be committing into the platform and all the other games.

[34:24] You know, I just I really would love it if Jerry just at least tried to make a normal game.

[34:31] That's it. Just try it. And I don't think he will because I think it would outsell what he's done

[34:35] before. How many p3 multi-morphics do you think he sold today? How many? Like guys in in the comments

[34:44] right now, as of today, how many total units do you think Jerry has sold? He won't answer this

[34:51] question. Now I don't understand why you wouldn't because you're building a connected platform.

[34:57] You think you'd want people to know how many other people are out there like you that you could

[35:05] connect with that you could play games with. All right. Pat says 500. Colin says 500 to 1000.

[35:13] 1400 700 says Carl. Tons. I mean tens.

[35:26] There's no way it's been 2000 Tony. There's no way. I mean, they barely make these games. They're

[35:31] trickling out. Now, I don't know. I don't know the answer. I don't know. So I mean, it's Jerry's to

[35:40] tell us if he wants to. But I know that he has two more licensed games coming after the Princess

[35:47] Bride. So it's it's not going to stop. We're going to get more games and that's fine. You know, look,

[35:53] at the end of the day, I do agree when people say it's better to have options and there's nothing

[35:58] wrong with having options. I just don't see the value when I'll tell you why I just I'd be nervous

[36:08] because if you want to get out of the platform, you're it's like hard to get out of it. It's really

[36:16] easy to you know, if you price it right, get out of your Jersey Jack, get out of your Batman, get

[36:21] out of your like, you know, Pulp Fiction, get out of your Chicago Gaming Company game. It's easy.

[36:28] You know, because like the when you want to get out of a used multi morphic, like you've got a

[36:35] niche within a niche within a niche person, you got to find, you know, it's not easy. That is not

[36:41] easy at all. So yeah, I mean, I would have just made a regular game. I mean, I think Barrels of Fun

[36:50] is doing it right. I think Spooky is doing it right. You want to make money. You want to make

[36:56] money. You want to grow and you want to be able to invest that money in future titles. And if you

[37:00] don't make money, you can't reinvest in the organization. He's got a 94% retention rate on

[37:07] his customers. Well, that's easy if you've got like 100 customers. And I don't even believe that,

[37:13] Colin. I don't even like, like, like, you know, the thing is this, you can't cherry pick the data

[37:19] you're going to feed people. You tell me you've got a 94 retention rate on your customers. Okay,

[37:25] then my next question is how many customers do you have? Right? I have 100% retention rate on my,

[37:34] on the, on the women who will sleep with me. All right, 100%. Because it's the same woman. It's

[37:40] one woman. I'm 100% effective on getting the women who want to sleep with me to sleep with me,

[37:46] because there's only one is Brenda. So that's my point is like, I just want to know how many,

[37:54] how many people out there bought a multi morphic? Look, we know, we know that it's hard, like, it's

[38:03] hard. Like labyrinth can't even crack 800. And they said they're going to make 1100. So we know

[38:13] it's not easy. And we know that like, spooky didn't sell out of looney tunes or Texas chainsaw

[38:19] massacre. So like, you know, we're at the point now, people, you know what that means? When you

[38:24] can't sell 1100 labyrinths, and you can't sell out of looney tunes or Texas chainsaw massacre,

[38:31] it means you're supplying more games than there is demand. I mean, there's no worse offender of

[38:38] that than 1000 John Wick le's. And see, this is the problem. I mean, I would see it if I was one of you

[38:45] is I don't want to go in on a game where right away, there's more supply than demand. Because it

[38:53] doesn't mean I don't want to eventually get the game. But if I can see that in the first week of

[38:59] sales, right, the first month, that there's more supply coming than there is of demand. The only

[39:08] game where that wasn't the case was Jaws, right over the last like, basically six months, that was

[39:15] the only game. I mean, Jaws, Ali is like sold out. And they're not readily available. And they don't

[39:23] trade hands very often. And that's because there's more demand than supply. No other game has that

[39:33] spooky Luke joined right away. I love it. Everyone's like, get on there, spooky Luke. So, you know,

[39:38] when you go across the board, all the other companies this year have experienced, you know,

[39:44] something that is kind of unprecedented, which is there's just more supply of everything than

[39:51] there is demand. And so what that's going to create for us as a customer is a good environment.

[39:58] Because it's going to create an environment in which we're going to be able to get better prices.

[40:06] It's going to create an environment in which these companies are going to have to work harder,

[40:11] right, to sell the games. Todd Tucky, welcome to the show, brother. It's also going to like,

[40:17] create an environment in which companies are going to fail. I mean, like, let's face it, like,

[40:25] Haggis is done. We'll talk about them in a second. American Pinball is done.

[40:31] Um, nothing much spooky Luke, just just talking about supply demand here. And I did say that

[40:36] spooky's next game is coming end of the year. It's going to be Jack Danger's next Mark Sidon

[40:42] versus spooky. I mean, those are going to be the three. There's nothing else. I mean, maybe Alice

[40:48] in Wonderland, but I a little bit worried. I'm very worried that Alice in Wonderland code.

[40:56] It's going to ship code incomplete. But what is that? What is that about?

[41:02] Why would a game that you've had all this time to work on, if you want to launch Dutch Pinball X,

[41:09] and I got to talk to Melbourne, but I don't think that's a good look at all. I don't think that's

[41:15] a good look at all. Like what you can't launch Alice code incomplete. Again, like you're branding

[41:23] yourself as this premium high end pinball experience. Well, there's nothing more premium

[41:31] than getting a game that's done a game. You think people buy a Bentley and it's missing a door.

[41:38] You're going to buy a Lamborghini and not all the cylinders are turned on yet.

[41:43] You're going to pay for a first class flight, but you have to wait for the champagne. No,

[41:50] if you're going to go premium and that's the entire billing of your company,

[41:56] then there's nothing more premium than having your game complete. You don't have to wait.

[42:03] They even said like we're going to build this game with feedback from the community.

[42:10] Kennedy just wants to throw the mic over his shoulder. That is the least way a premium brand

[42:15] behaves. Ferrari Rolex, like Bugatti, like a Ritz-Karl, they don't give a SHIT what you think.

[42:27] They're the experts on what people want. You know, this whole like this crowdsourcing the code.

[42:35] That's not what a premium brand does. A premium brand hits you with stuff you don't even know you

[42:42] want. They know exactly what to do and that's the thing. It's like, come on. I think what they're

[42:48] doing, it's a lot of marketing hubris and hyperbole, but man, it's starting to look sloppy. I don't

[42:57] want to hear that like the code's not going to be done. I don't want to hear that we're going to

[43:00] listen to the community feedback and like what? I have to do the work for you? We have to tell you

[43:07] what would be nice to see in the game? So then there's no visionary. Did you have to tell Lyman

[43:12] Sheets what needed to be into a game to make it good? Did you? Did you have to give him feedback?

[43:18] Did you have to give the team that coded Godzilla feedback on how to make the game better?

[43:23] Did you have to do any of that? I mean, think about it. All the greatest pinball machines. Did

[43:27] you have to give Keith Johnson feedback on what he should do with Laura the Rings to make the

[43:31] multi-ball is exciting? No. No, I'm telling you, like there's talent and then there's not talent.

[43:37] And I'm sorry, but like if you want to make a pinball experience in a game, amazingly fun,

[43:42] you need talented people that know what they're doing. And a lot of those talented people don't

[43:46] need your feedback. I don't want to hear from you how to make the song better because I know how to

[43:51] make it great. I mean, the same is true in every creative field. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but like

[43:58] when I hear stuff like, well, we're going to, we're going to build the ship in the ocean. I mean,

[44:02] that's basically what they're saying. We're going to build the ship in the ocean. And we hope you

[44:08] come on board for it. And I know there's like the apologists who are like, well, you know, it's fun to

[44:12] see the way the sausage is made. No, it's not. No, it's not. Nobody wants to go to a sausage

[44:18] making factory. Nobody. All right. This is just like, come on, like get your SHIT together.

[44:26] Walk into the room and pull the sheet off a completed game. Is it that much to ask for?

[44:34] You know what people want in this hobby. You know how to get it done.

[44:40] I mean, it's just like, it's just, again, it's a cop out. It's a cop out because they need to,

[44:45] because what they want is money coming in without a final product done. And then they want to use

[44:51] the money coming in to pay for the coding. It's just, it's like, we got to get some revenue

[44:56] going. We got to get some revenue going to get some talent. I get it, but it's just not the way it

[45:02] should go. I love it. You know, right now they're like, Can you do you don't know what you're talking

[45:06] about? You're all wrong. Am I am I am am I wrong? Did any of us have to give alignment sheets

[45:13] feedback on how to make a game great? All right. Let's talk about some titles in the rumor mill.

[45:19] And by the way, guys, you absolutely suck. And I mean this, your Facebook live days are coming

[45:27] to an end because I just got a notification from Patreon that they are going to start allowing

[45:35] their content creators to do live streams like this. And I was saying to myself, you know, like,

[45:43] nah, but I love Facebook live. It's easy. It's good. It's good. You know, but like 10 stars.

[45:50] Why am I doing this here? Like I'm this show is going to, if you love the Saturday morning

[45:56] spectacular, which I know you do. And I know there's 1500 of you that watch it at least,

[46:01] usually like 1800. The show might be going to Patreon because they're going to start allowing

[46:08] the content craze, which I think is smart, which I think is smart. And they allow the content creators

[46:14] to actually pocket what they create where here it's like it goes to Facebook, it goes to Apple,

[46:20] and then I get a cut. But at least there's nothing to cut. There's nothing to cut when you get 10

[46:25] stars. No, no, Dave, it's like, Dave, it doesn't work like that anymore. I've like plateaued on how

[46:33] many people will join the club. Like nobody's, nobody's discovering Canada now. They're just

[46:39] not like I've hit, I'm almost like hit capacity, like around like between seven and 750 is like the

[46:47] most amount of club subscribers you're ever going to get. Right? I mean, I mean, right now I have

[46:52] more club subscribers than all the other pinball content creators combined on Patreon, like much

[46:59] more. So it's like, it is what it is. I'm happy with it. Albert's going to keep us here. I'm happy

[47:05] with it. I'm happy with where we're at. And it's because of guys like Chris Arcades, who just,

[47:10] she just joined 50 bucks a month. Chris, you get another shout out. I mean, I got guys, you know,

[47:16] most of them, most people, $5 a month, I got guys at $5 a month that will kick stern $2,000 for a

[47:23] plastic topper, right? And then, and then I'm giving them content, way more content throughout the

[47:29] year than they're getting on inside or connected. And these guys will also donate money to Robin

[47:35] at pinside way more than they donate to my show. It's fine. It is what it is. It's not in front of

[47:41] the window. There's a gap. See that gap? See that gap there? Now you see the window. There's a gap.

[47:48] And also, I've got the windows covered because the UV company is coming July 17. Albert, thank you

[47:57] for the $10 a month. Let's, let's walk over Guns and Roses. I haven't, I can't, I can't walk away

[48:02] from the mic, but let me, let me turn this around and show you something cool. All right. So, all

[48:07] right, we're back. We just did a little house tour, but we're not going to make people, you can't

[48:12] listen to a house tour. You got to see it. The demon is going to get stolen. Oh, good. Take it.

[48:19] I'd, I'd rather have the insurance company pay me out for it than, uh, than even keep it.

[48:25] It like, you steal the demon. You know, what does that mean? Like someone's going to see,

[48:29] I'm not worried about these cars anymore. There's something about, um, when you grow up a little

[48:35] bit and you realize like, man, it's just cars. It's just this. It's just like, I'm not a teenager

[48:41] anymore. I'm not looking to flex with these automobiles. I'm just looking to have some fun.

[48:46] And, you know, I, I, I grew up, but these, these towns are funny. I'll say this. Like,

[48:50] there's a lot of money in these towns. I mean, the houses that are on the beach,

[48:56] you know, they're 10 to $15 million houses. Like people have money. Like there, there's,

[49:01] when you reach that surfernal point where like money's no issue, I always find it funny because,

[49:07] you know, I have conversations in these, in these wealthy towns and I've grown up in these

[49:11] towns and went to private schools with these kinds of kids. And there's a lot of insecurity

[49:16] where people right away talk about money. They, they, they size you up instantly. And I don't

[49:23] talk about that when I talk to people. It's like, I try to talk about things or what did you do?

[49:29] Or what are you into? Or did you see the show? You know, let's talk about the acolyte, whatever it is.

[49:35] But I've noticed that trait in a lot of wealthy people. They're also very insecure. And it's

[49:42] an interesting trait. And I, my dad always raised me like, look, nobody should ever bring up money.

[49:49] Like you shouldn't talk about how much your house cost or how much you make. Or now we talk about

[49:57] money with pins because none of that's private. All these pinball machines are publicly sold

[50:03] for an MSRP. But, you know, I think, you know, I think when you, when you talk to people and the

[50:11] first thing out of their mouth is a financial question that's personal, insecure, right away,

[50:18] right away. I'll tell you real quick, I was talking to a neighbor on the block and he was like,

[50:22] yeah, we bought our house from this young couple and they moved to a house for $3.7 million and

[50:28] Darianne. And I was like, all right, like, why, why is that important? Like, why is that even part

[50:35] of the story? Like what? I don't, okay, cool. Are you promoting them? I don't know what,

[50:41] does that make you feel small? Like, I don't know what, what do you want me to do with that

[50:44] information? All right, so the acolyte is terrible, by the way. Like the one, there was a really cool

[50:52] lightsaber scene in it, but for the most part, Star Wars is dead. You know, like Mandalorian

[50:59] put Star Wars back on the map and Star Wars pinball killed it. It wasn't even like the terrible

[51:06] shows. I think Andor was amazing. I think Mandalorian was amazing. I think Boba Fett was terrible.

[51:14] I thought Obi-Wan was terribly like, it was like interesting enough, but it was, it just felt cheap.

[51:21] Star Wars needs to go back to the big screen. The problem is by the time it gets there,

[51:28] the damage Disney has done to this franchise, I don't know how you're going to reverse it,

[51:34] because they've just got so much, Martin, nobody's watching Rebels. Can we like grown adults are not

[51:41] watching these animated series is it's just, I get that Rebels and Clone Wars, but come on,

[51:47] you would grown adults are not watching this stuff. You know, I don't want to have to like

[51:53] invest in a kid's show that's really meant for adults as a way to actually get good Star Wars

[51:59] storylines. I think it should happen in the theater. And I think that's where it should take place.

[52:04] The problem is with all of Disney now is the message is more important than the storyline.

[52:11] And it's like they're trying to make up for all the lack of diversity and this and that over the

[52:16] years. And they're just jamming it down everybody's throats now with every single installation or new

[52:23] show. But the good ones don't do that like Mandalorian didn't do that. And or didn't do that. Like

[52:30] you can just have a good show or movie with a diverse cast and strong female characters.

[52:36] And not have to make it about that. Because that's the big difference nowadays is like,

[52:44] they like they make it about that. Like that's the reason why the show exists versus the narrative

[52:50] and the story that's going to pull everybody in. And that's bad storytelling. It's a distraction.

[52:58] It's an absolute distraction. You know, when they say like we need strong female characters,

[53:04] and I'm like, what about Princess Leia? She's pretty damn strong. She was badass. You know,

[53:10] it is what it is, you know, I don't know. And the Disney stock price reflects the decisions they've

[53:16] made. You know, even as I'm watching Accolade and I'm watching like the story and the acting,

[53:23] I mean, a lot of it is just terrible. It's just terrible. You know, the female lead in it, she's

[53:29] kind of just like wooden and sterile. And the whole like identical twin thing is stupid. And

[53:36] you don't really feel anything like there's these scenes where you're supposed to feel something

[53:42] for these characters. And you're more just distracted by, you know, their images and their

[53:49] like haircuts and the way the lines are so poorly like delivered. It's terrible. You know, look,

[53:57] I think getting getting back to pinball. Let me ask you guys a question. What is the one game

[54:07] that you're looking forward to the most? We know there's a lot in the rumor mill,

[54:12] but not a lot has transpired. Like what's the one game you really, really want, and you want them

[54:20] to nail it? Like what is it? What is it? Is it back to the future? So Trent just said Goonies.

[54:28] We're going to talk about that in a minute because I think Goonies is interesting. Tony said Muppets.

[54:34] David said back to the future. Now it sucks that back to the future now is not until next year. Joe

[54:41] Badi said Alice. You know, the funny thing about Joe is he's serious. He's a huge fan of Alice in

[54:48] Wonderland and that's great. I mean, Joe, luckily for you, you're going to get it. And it's going to

[54:53] have your floating, levitating upper play field. How did they do that? It's going to be obvious how

[55:00] they did it. It's easy to use like the angle at which you see a game to make an upper play field

[55:06] look like it's hovering. I mean, they all kind of do for the most part lost Goonies. No Muppets.

[55:15] I love when you ask people like, what do you want? And they're like, not Muppets. That wasn't the

[55:21] question. Mario Brothers back to the future said Hector. Mad Max said John. You know, Mad Max,

[55:34] the Furiosa movie just bombed. Oh man, I would love Javier, the Ronald Moore

[55:41] Battlestar Galactica TV show with Edward James, almost. Did I get his name right? Greg Colton

[55:50] will correct me. That show is insanely good. I don't know if there's enough though, like,

[55:58] to warrant a pinball machine based on it, but it's really good. Eastbound and down would be funny. I

[56:05] do think we need some comedy shows or movies as pinball machines. We got Prince, Sonic the Hedgehog,

[56:14] Van Halen. Let's see, Fallout. I think we need the office. I think we need some Seinfeld, some comedy

[56:23] would be good. Batman 89 done again would be great. Can you imagine if Steve Ritchie made Batman 89

[56:31] as a Jersey Jack game? Let's just think about that for a minute. Batman 89, Steve Ritchie, Jersey Jack.

[56:40] The Abbas family gets the music from the Prince soundtrack for the game. Can you imagine that game?

[56:49] Where do they get a load of me? Can you imagine the clips from the movie, the mechs you can make,

[56:56] the Batmobile, the shields pop up on the car, the balloon from the Joker. Can you imagine going

[57:05] into the art museum as maybe an upper play field? All the stuff you could do, the lower play field,

[57:11] Batcave. I'm just at the point now where I'm tired of dreaming about these things and I'd like to see

[57:20] more of these companies hit with the magic. Dave said Steve Ritchie, Superman 78. Now look,

[57:30] I think a Superman machine would crush it right now and with the new movie coming out, maybe now

[57:36] is the time to get that movie and put it into pinball form. Not iconic though. The smarter bet would be

[57:45] to go with the Christopher Reeve movies because they're iconic. Rodney, thank you for the 100 stars.

[57:54] I can't even afford not even a soda with 185 stars. Robin Hood Men in Tides. No, no, no, no. Guys, come

[58:03] on. Okay, I get it. It's a comedy, but like Ferris Bueller would be better. I'm trying to think like

[58:10] airplane would be good. Trying to think about the comedies. Well, yeah, and Carrie, you're not wrong.

[58:18] I think Stern is just like, everything's on the screen. I'm a little tired of seeing Stern's

[58:29] approach, if you will. Stern's got to up the ante. They really do have to up the ante. They have to

[58:36] make their games look better. I'm sorry, but they do. They have to make their games have more of a

[58:43] of a sculpted world. The cheap plastic is just looking so thin now on their games. And, you know,

[58:51] that's why they don't care about the mod community doing all the work for them. But, but man, for like

[58:56] 10 to $13,000, I shouldn't have to be spending all this money on mods to make the orca look like

[59:03] the orca or or jaws eat the ball or, you know, go down a list of things like they they I feel like

[59:11] they stopped certain games like Godzilla, I feel like they made an effort Ghostbusters, they made

[59:17] an effort, but man, it's so hit or miss with the stern. And usually they just don't make an effort

[59:23] and they rely on the artwork and the LCD screen, but they don't really like why why is putting

[59:29] good sculpts into the game so challenging for them. They don't do sculpts like almost everything

[59:36] they do is flat plastic. Why? Why can't they have better sculpts in these stern, it would go such a

[59:45] long way in just making these stern machines look good. Thank you, Chris for the stars.

[59:51] Because like the sculpts wouldn't break. You're just wrapping your game in a much nicer looking

[59:58] world. I don't understand why they can't do that. And again, the reason why they don't do it is because

[01:00:03] we're suckers and we'll buy the flat plastic crap. And I think it's unfortunate like why we should be

[01:00:11] demanding more for this much money. They don't even give you a topper for $13,000. You know,

[01:00:17] like it's crazy if I told you five years ago, you're going to be charged 13 grand for a 1000

[01:00:24] run LE and it comes with no topper and that you could accessorize a stern to be almost $16,000

[01:00:34] with shooter rods and toppers. You would be like get the F out. And this is a thousand run of a

[01:00:41] game. It's not even like it's a super LE where there's only 50 or 80, a thousand of them are out

[01:00:47] there. I don't know. I really don't know. It's going to be brutal, man, unless these companies can

[01:00:54] really bring the value. I think a lot of people are tapping out. I think a lot of people are just

[01:01:01] content with what they have. And that's the biggest thing I would worry about. If I was every single

[01:01:07] pinball company is that people will just reach a point where there's just enough good games or,

[01:01:14] you know, and there's enough great games that can be had now for great prices. I don't need the next

[01:01:23] thing. And what all of these pinball companies need is to keep the line going. They don't want

[01:01:31] you to be satisfied with what you have. But if everybody becomes satisfied with what they have,

[01:01:40] that's bad news for these manufacturing companies. So they've got to find that middle ground. And

[01:01:45] I'm telling you, they shot past it. The middle ground was when the nicest creme de la creme version

[01:01:54] of a stern was less than 10,000. The nicest Jersey Jack was less than 13,000. They've shot past that

[01:02:04] so significantly that it's just not going to work. And I don't know, like, yeah, we could wait it out

[01:02:12] until a juggernaut theme comes. But what about all the other themes? Because then every John Wick

[01:02:18] is just a casualty of your pricing mistake. Every Venom is and then all the people that bought those

[01:02:25] games. What do you say to those people? You know, after they lose all this money, they're not going

[01:02:31] to go in on your next game. And so you're burning the candle at both ends. And it's just not going

[01:02:36] to work. It's just not sustainable. And look, the distro system is in trouble. Of course,

[01:02:43] it's in trouble. There's just only so many deals you can do before like the deals are up. The deals

[01:02:50] are up. And it's weird, right? Because, you know, a lot of ways a dealer has to have the mentality

[01:02:56] of like a drug dealer, like I got to keep you hooked. And I know you're not going to feel the

[01:03:01] same high on the games you've owned for a while. And I need you to feel a new high with a new game.

[01:03:09] And look, that can get you only so far. And there's only so many people that will absorb

[01:03:16] all of these new games. And that's what I love about this hobby and covering it through this lens

[01:03:24] is that's the real challenge. How can a modern pinball company with a customer base that already

[01:03:33] has more than enough games than they ever really need? And you know, I'm talking about you,

[01:03:39] because I have only one machine, and this is enough pinball to have in a house. It is like you don't

[01:03:46] need more. So how do I get a community that already has more than they even need? How do I get them

[01:03:55] to buy more of a 400 pound hard to move, you know, game that a lot of them don't even play to begin with?

[01:04:07] So I think it's a really interesting time in the hobby. One is enough, Eric. I'm telling you,

[01:04:15] one is enough. I don't know, like, why would one not be enough? You know, when people come over,

[01:04:23] we play pinball. When I want to play pinball, I play pinball. I don't need more. Now, like, yeah,

[01:04:31] there's a lot of great games out there. But it's enough because unlike video games, and

[01:04:38] it's the same way like I play FIFA. And I don't really play anything else. I play FIFA on Xbox

[01:04:44] because every game is different because I'm playing online. The same is true with a pinball machine.

[01:04:49] Every game is different because it's random. And no two games are the same. You can't say that for a

[01:04:56] lot of other video games and stuff out there. Yeah, I'm the only one playing. I'm the only one playing.

[01:05:04] Now, look, I'm not indicting if you have more than enough, because I know most of you have way more

[01:05:08] than one. But my point being is you got those games. Most people got their games for a pretty

[01:05:15] decent price, right? When prices were like reasonable. They're not reasonable now. You

[01:05:21] need to think about it, like, the prices are not reasonable. Inflation means your dollar is worth

[01:05:27] much less money today than it was five years ago. So in a world in which your dollar doesn't go as far,

[01:05:35] you're going to throw it further on pinball machines that have gone up 40% in MSRP pricing

[01:05:42] over the same five years. And that is going to make you happier. That's going to sit well with you

[01:05:50] that you could legitimately pay more money for a foo fighters with a topper than you did for a

[01:05:58] Batman SLE. Like you really can wake up and feel good about that. Maybe some of you can. I would

[01:06:07] look at it like, maybe it's a lot easier for me to adjust where happiness lies and what I'm looking

[01:06:14] for in life. And for me, look, look, I'm in a different stage than a lot of you. A lot of you,

[01:06:18] you've raised your kids, they're out of school, you've paid for colleges, you're in the golden

[01:06:23] years of your life, you've got money to burn, you don't care. I get it. I totally get it.

[01:06:28] I've got a four and a half week old baby. All right, I've got a three and a half year old champion.

[01:06:35] I'm just beginning. I'm just beginning the journey. A lot of you are, are well past. So this, to me,

[01:06:41] my priorities are not these things. It's education. It's cars that are safe to get them around in,

[01:06:49] even though I take killing in the demon. The demon is safe, by the way. I mean,

[01:06:53] the thing is a tank. It is a tank and the car seat fits nicely in the back. Because remember,

[01:06:58] it's built on a four-seater chassis, a Mercedes E-Class chassis. I think a lot of, you know,

[01:07:04] a lot of us are, but a lot of you, I just, I feel it. I feel you guys are like kind of over it.

[01:07:09] You're over the FOMO new and box like insanity and you're just slowing down a little bit.

[01:07:16] And that's going to put the pressure on and I think it's good. And I don't think that's a negative.

[01:07:20] I think it just puts the onus on these companies to bring out better stuff and to innovate and to

[01:07:26] get the themes right. Who wouldn't want that? You know what I'm saying? It's weird. Like the only

[01:07:30] people that wouldn't want that are Stern's like financial department. They want you to buy John

[01:07:37] Wick and not think about it. Everybody look, this has been a fun Saturday morning spectacular.

[01:07:44] Again, thank you to Chris Arcades for the $50 subscription to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:07:50] For all you club members out there, thank you so much. More shows coming this week.

[01:07:53] I'm going back to work next week. It goes by fast. My paternity leave, I took eight weeks. I get 12.

[01:08:01] I took eight at once and then I'm going to take the additional four later on in the year. It's

[01:08:07] amazing how fast time flies. It goes way too fast. I'm lucky I got paternity leave and did the house

[01:08:14] move because of all the work that had to be done. I can't imagine moving while you're working,

[01:08:20] coming home every night to boxes and boxes. No, we're settled because we've had time.

[01:08:27] But I also have a little bit of time to place some guns and roses right now,

[01:08:31] which I want to do because Brenda took the kids to the store. I don't get to crank this thing and

[01:08:37] enjoy it very often is what I'm saying. I'm going to let you guys go. I'm going to go have a great

[01:08:42] day. You guys have a great day. I'm going to go play some G&R and be content with my one machine.

[01:08:48] I've also, by the way, I adjusted the code in the game. There is some great gentleman on Pinside

[01:08:56] who really went through the new code and adjusted the code so that there's not as many multi-balls,

[01:09:03] but there's still multi-balls, but it's such a better code because it's not just the multi-balls

[01:09:08] that he dials down. It's really about when you start a song. It doesn't just endlessly keep

[01:09:15] feeding you balls for the first minute and a half of the song because I always hated that.

[01:09:21] You just don't feel like you can focus on what you want to shoot because you're just slapping at

[01:09:27] the balls. He's minimized that so much with the new code settings, which makes each song now

[01:09:35] way more enjoyable. I feel like I'm actually knowing what I'm shooting at. It gives me time

[01:09:41] to read what's on the screen to know where to shoot, and it just allows you a much more

[01:09:46] intimate connection to the gameplay. I think Jersey Jack should look at some of those settings

[01:09:52] because they're just settings. He didn't have to do any major coding. He didn't do any coding. He

[01:09:57] just changed the settings, and I think it works much better. I love the Pinwoofer system. I put

[01:10:05] Pinwoofer into this game. I know some people like it. Some people don't. It doesn't need an

[01:10:11] external sub. It rocks. It really, really rocks. Let me show you guys. Hold on a second. Then we'll

[01:10:18] end this. I'm going to say goodbye to the subscribers right now, but I'll walk you over and we'll crank it.
