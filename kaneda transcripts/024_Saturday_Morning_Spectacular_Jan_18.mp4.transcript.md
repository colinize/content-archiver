[00:00] Let's see if this mic is working, it's working!

[00:04] Clean this off.

[00:08] Got a towel right here.

[00:10] We got the spooky hat on.

[00:15] All right.

[00:16] Saturday morning.

[00:18] Spectacular.

[00:19] Canada in the house.

[00:21] Oh, how's everybody doing?

[00:25] We'll get some people in here.

[00:27] I'm late. I'm late.

[00:30] I know it. I know it.

[00:32] People will figure it out.

[00:33] Let's go drop it into some other channels.

[00:35] It's good at Patreon.

[00:37] We're live.

[00:39] We live.

[00:41] We talking to him, ball.

[00:44] We talking.

[00:46] What are we talking about today?

[00:48] What are we talking about?

[00:50] What's new in the market?

[00:53] Join the fun kids.

[00:57] I might have to bring this back to Facebook guys.

[00:59] I got to be serious.

[01:01] I haven't made a penny.

[01:04] I can't turn on the sponsor chats or whatever it is.

[01:09] It won't let me turn it on.

[01:11] I don't know how to turn it on.

[01:13] How's everybody doing?

[01:17] I got my spooky bone or hat.

[01:22] It's a nice hat.

[01:23] I do like the straight brim.

[01:25] But I'll wear this.

[01:27] We got the fixed feelings to arrive this morning.

[01:30] So behind that door, it works.

[01:33] Thanks, Robert.

[01:34] Mooney for keeping it safe.

[01:36] It's not a good game.

[01:37] It's more of a Disney collector's item than it is.

[01:41] A good arcade machine.

[01:43] But I got to be honest, folks.

[01:45] The thing weighs like 400 pounds.

[01:48] And I just wish we all were watch collectors because it.

[01:54] Moving these heavy items around.

[01:58] If any of you have stairs or tight corners or.

[02:02] It's not our homes are not meant to be arcade.

[02:05] They're really not.

[02:07] I mean, if you design a house from the ground up to accommodate arcade and pinball machines.

[02:12] Cool.

[02:13] That's why I love these things.

[02:15] The Japanese, they knew that they just.

[02:18] You know, the mall that extra weight of the wooden cabinets adds to the CRT monitors is insane.

[02:28] You know, the thing metal so much easier to move these little neo geos around.

[02:33] And you know, but it's behind this door.

[02:37] It's almost black and a window people.

[02:39] It's not though.

[02:40] It's but I have no other put stuff.

[02:42] No, we're the put stuff.

[02:44] Try moving a Star Wars battle pod.

[02:47] I couldn't even.

[02:48] I couldn't even, you know, this stuff.

[02:50] You need like those hydraulic orklifts to move those things around.

[02:55] Everybody what's going on?

[02:57] I wrote in Humphording for Twippy for best dressed.

[03:02] Oh, man, it's Twippy voting over.

[03:06] I have no idea what the dates are.

[03:09] So, you know, after.

[03:10] After one day goes on for for one day too many.

[03:14] I've never understood why the voting is open for such a long period of time.

[03:19] But it is what it is.

[03:21] I, you know, do I think we're going to win for favorite podcaster?

[03:26] Maybe I don't know favorite content creator.

[03:29] I don't know.

[03:30] I really don't know.

[03:31] I think the, um.

[03:33] I think the enthusiasm around the Twippy's.

[03:37] You know, it'll never be what it was.

[03:39] It just is what it is.

[03:40] It is what it is.

[03:41] You know, sometimes you lose the momentum on something and we'll see.

[03:45] If they do a great job with the show, maybe they'll bring.

[03:48] Uh, you know, a lot of the enthusiasm back.

[03:51] I think, uh, if I were them, I would have had the Twippy's down at pinball at the beach.

[03:56] I mean, think about it.

[03:57] Like, why wouldn't you just do the Twippy's at pinball at the beach?

[03:59] I would fly down for that.

[04:01] You're going to have at least enough people to fill a room there in that hotel.

[04:06] And it would be a great thing to do on like Friday or Saturday night.

[04:12] It's Super Bowl weekend.

[04:13] You know, the more I don't even think I can go because Brenda might have to do some work that weekend because her company is a sports streaming company.

[04:20] So, um, they're going to be busy leading up to the Super Bowl.

[04:25] At the beach in March.

[04:26] No, it's in February.

[04:29] But it's in Florida.

[04:30] It's in Florida.

[04:31] That's why the weather is going to be warm.

[04:32] It's not anywhere.

[04:33] That's cold.

[04:34] I love this hat.

[04:36] It's my spooky boner hat.

[04:37] How's everybody doing?

[04:39] How's everybody doing?

[04:40] I feel like there's a lot of.

[04:43] A lot around the corner.

[04:44] We're waiting on a pinball.

[04:45] We're going to talk all about Harry Potter.

[04:47] We're going to talk about what I told everybody on the show this week.

[04:50] It is a standard body machine.

[04:54] Right?

[04:55] So like.

[04:56] Does that disappoint some of you?

[04:57] I don't know.

[04:58] I'm not surprised that I got compromised.

[04:59] It's standard body.

[05:00] It's still going to be, um, all about what Eric puts into the game.

[05:02] Now, I heard.

[05:03] I heard Eric told somebody close to me that he.

[05:06] I really can't wait for people to see my next game.

[05:09] So I know he's really excited for the world of see Harry Potter.

[05:13] I know that a lot of us are very excited to finally get a game in which Eric Minier.

[05:20] I know that.

[05:21] I know that.

[05:22] I know that.

[05:23] I know that.

[05:24] I know that.

[05:25] I know that.

[05:26] I know that.

[05:27] Right?

[05:29] I know that.

[05:30] I know that.

[05:31] I know that.

[05:32] I know that.

[05:33] And then, like, I got a game in which Eric Minier wanted to make the theme.

[05:37] Right?

[05:44] He's not a Guns and Roses man, but, man, he made a great game of slash.

[05:47] He made a great game of slash.

[05:49] And I think that the Guns and Roses hate, which is sort of like ridiculous, right?

[05:53] love the game then don't love the game. And it's been the best selling game I think for Jersey Jack Pimble.

[05:59] It's a better shooter game than Wizard of Oz people. It is.

[06:05] It's just like what we all want though and I mean this when I say we want a game that shoots

[06:12] good as Wonka has fun stuff in it like dialed in and Wizard of Oz and integrates the theme

[06:23] in a way that doesn't make us feel like they missed the theme integration and they made a

[06:29] soulless version of the theme. To me that's why Wizard of Oz to this day and Guns and Roses when

[06:36] you think about the two Jersey Jack games that have sort of sold the most have the most appreciation

[06:46] and create the most moments of wow. The two games that really nailed it have the most

[06:54] soull and personality in its lineup. I would say the game after it is probably Elton John but man

[07:03] it's like I just don't think people want Elton John as a theme. I think there's a few Elton John

[07:10] songs that work good for Pimble but I do think Elton John you kind of can enjoy it on location

[07:17] the desire to own Elton John. Man you just I don't know you know it's all about the gameplay and it's

[07:24] all about the beauty of that machine but but what Jersey Jack hasn't done is they haven't nailed

[07:33] a movie property in a way that just nailed it right it's like pirates didn't even have any clips

[07:43] from the movies there's no I get pirates is great and the thousand people who own it will swear by it

[07:50] but there's a reason why pirates with a Caribbean did not sell when everybody could get one easily

[07:59] right I think people forget that about pirates like you act like you know like oh man this pin

[08:04] so out of reach it it wasn't it wasn't the only reason it's out of reach is because they didn't make

[08:10] more of them if they had made two thousand of them we would not be seeing any of this around the

[08:16] game and remember gang they only made 200 collectors editions remember that there's 800 more

[08:27] 800 more 15 thousand dollar versions of toy story four the godfather avatar and Elton John

[08:39] 800 more of each of those themes that's 32 hundred more machines out there if you add up all

[08:48] four of those ce's then there is a pirate ce and that's ridiculous it's ridiculous right it's

[08:57] like that's why now if they made a black pearl edition of pirates of the Caribbean and they made 500

[09:04] more of them they could sell them for 15 thousand that's a smart that's a smart play for jjp to do a

[09:11] final run of pirates black pearl edition and sell it for 15 and you'd sell every one what's 15 times

[09:22] 500 what is that like six point five million dollars right there for a game that's already

[09:29] developed a game that just needs to be ordered parts and screwed together you could pre-sell all 500

[09:36] of those spots and they would sell instantly you would sell more of those than you'll ever sell

[09:41] I think even avatar le 7.5 million okay

[09:50] yeah carry over the two five 7.5 million why not why not do that

[09:58] isn't it crazy isn't it like anything about 7.5 million dollars is sitting there

[10:04] if they just make it mean Eric Minier should get a half a million dollars of that

[10:11] yeah

[10:13] why would it you know he has to be 15 thousand dollars

[10:18] um the the the dumb part of pirates is the selector 22 characters

[10:25] this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen and then the way to start a pinball machine

[10:29] you know it's like common sense has always been the thing that's we we you know I'm

[10:33] I'm going to start today's show with Jersey Jack I mean common sense has been the thing that

[10:36] I think they've lacked no why why are we why would anyone want to walk up to a pinball machine and

[10:44] select between 22 different characters what what is that where is that I don't know where

[10:55] you buy the boner hat it arrived in the mail it arrived in the mail so thank you uh team over at

[11:01] spooky pinball so what do we think gang do you think that Harry Potter is going to have a beautiful

[11:10] Hogwarts castle tucked in that play field upper right area or upper left do you think there's

[11:19] going to be a quidditch game you know if there ever was a way to reuse I was thinking about this

[11:26] how do you not take Steve Richie's hyper drive right how do you not take Steve Richie's

[11:32] hyper drive from Star Wars and put that in Harry Potter as the way you play quidditch it's

[11:42] quidditch right in Harry Potter it's like perfect for it

[11:54] the the thing I tell people about Harry Potter is they're going to sell out of Harry Potter

[12:03] C E's in in instant okay in an instant there's not going to be like oh week later let me let me

[12:14] make up my mind they're going to sell a thousand Harry Potter C E's instantly and I've been telling

[12:22] everybody whether you like the theme or not whether you want one or not just get one even if you

[12:30] don't want it just get one it's going to be three to five thousand dollars in your pocket is what

[12:43] it will happen when Harry Potter comes out it's going to be an 18 to 20 thousand dollar game on the

[12:48] second hand market it just is it just is so get on a list grab a spot and man up and take some

[13:00] one else's game from them no like you don't say like just just just just grab a spot grab a spot

[13:10] Frank yeah dude I don't people man I know a dude who's got five five of them I'm not going to

[13:19] tell you who who it is and with who but I know a dude who's got five cause cause Harry Potter is

[13:27] going to go through the roof because you know who wants Harry Potter in the house finally a game

[13:33] that people's wives would want in the house their kids would want in the house it's going to be crazy

[13:40] yeah your kids don't listen to Metallica but they want Harry Potter

[13:47] Dobby mix look I think here's what I'm looking for in Harry Potter and Jersey Jack I hope you didn't

[13:55] screw this up first and foremost I don't want rainbow rainbow bright light shows in Harry Potter

[14:03] I don't I want Harry Potter to embrace the warmth of the Hogwarts world right the the feeling of

[14:13] of candlelit pinball if you will I want flickering candle lights in the windows of Hogwarts castle

[14:21] I want to feel the the aura and the ambiance of the world of Potter right if if I were to go to

[14:30] Wizarding world down in Florida if I were to sort of go through and I hope they did this I want to walk

[14:36] through the world of Harry Potter and I want to see that world under glass in its richness and its

[14:46] warmness and and sort of like the turn of the century kind of vibe if I walk up to Harry Potter and

[14:53] feels like Harry Potter slot machine and it's just like rainbow bright will a fortune lights going

[14:59] all over the place I don't want that I don't want that and I think Jersey Jack needs to stop

[15:08] regardless of theme making everybody a rainbow skittles vomit gain unless it makes sense that

[15:17] makes sense with Elton John it made sense with Guns and Roses lighting no I don't even want it

[15:25] in a track mode I don't no no Harry Potter track mode should be it should just be flickering candles

[15:36] under the glass that should be the attract mode okay it shouldn't be rainbows everywhere

[15:47] I really hope they understand this and I and this is where like I just I'm sometimes like I'm

[15:53] curious like who has some power over there to walk up to their creations with a little bit of

[16:02] common sense and a little bit of in artistic eye and maybe guide Eric a little bit guide marks

[16:09] not you know side in a little bit you know help these guys out a little bit

[16:15] Francie thank you for the spooky gear brother I love it I love it

[16:20] everything's the right size it fits perfect I've got a spooky bone or hat

[16:25] this is great look you know the I think you could count on all your hands and toes the amount of

[16:33] times people give advice to Jack and the team over at JJP and it's just seemingly ignored

[16:42] so the thing that I don't get about whenever JJP goes to a show is they say stuff like they get

[16:48] up on stage and they say we put all of the assets you want into Willy Wonka we put everything

[16:53] into the game and then you're like wait there's no clips there's no clips synced up how did you

[16:58] what so what are you talking about when you say you put everything in uh Willy Wonka's a musical there's

[17:03] none of the music there's none of the moments in the movie where the kids are singing the songs in

[17:08] each different room of Willy Wonka so when you said you put everything in what did you mean by that

[17:12] because I am seeing things that are not in and then you look at Avatar right you got this movie

[17:19] this two billion dollar blockbuster film all of these epic battles right uh and and all they had to

[17:25] do was bring the energy of all of those battles to the pinball machine right and then they showed

[17:31] the battle going on and everything's muted the gunfire was muted the whale crashing down over the ship

[17:39] the screaming nabi all the yelling and and sort of rally crying going on in the film like the

[17:46] stuff that makes those moments have impact is all removed and replaced with the orchestration of

[17:52] the game and the callouts of where to shoot and you absolutely destroy the vibe of those moments from

[17:59] the film and then you say we put everything we can into this game and then you ask them you get

[18:05] really kg answers when you ask them do you have the rights do you have the rights from the license

[18:10] holder to use the audio from these scenes with the voice from the actors and the music from the film

[18:17] do you have the rights to use that and you know I heard that they did it they just didn't want to do

[18:23] it because they wanted to have their own music and orchestration I don't know I don't buy that

[18:28] I don't buy that um all right so what Richie is working on next this is why I didn't want to do art

[18:35] for potter it's not even out yet and all the complaining um well look look the thing about potter

[18:43] francheap is the bigger the theme the bigger the expectation the bigger the bone or people have

[18:51] to get it right and you know if you think about pinball sometimes the biggest themes have had the

[19:00] worst designs star wars rick and morty um game of thrones wasn't really that great um

[19:13] you know go look at game of thrones now talk about a game that has an age dwell go look at game of

[19:18] thrones now and put it next to evil dead like look at the art in game of thrones um well the thing

[19:26] about potter is for me for it to succeed here's what I think it needs I think it needs

[19:37] three really magical mechs okay I'm just gonna give you my must-haves like these are non-negotiable

[19:46] I think it needs to have three really magical mechs that make you feel like a wizard okay so whether

[19:53] that's you know magic wand moment with magnets whether that's flying through the air on the

[19:59] broom like you're playing quidditch whether that's um you know I don't know I don't really know

[20:06] Harry Potter that well to be honest and then I think it needs I think it needs I don't know what's

[20:14] going on in this house by the way I think it needs clips from the films that are not muted I need

[20:23] to hear from Harry and when he moves his mouth I I want to see his mouth move and his voice at the

[20:32] same time I also think I would probably want to focus on the earlier films that are just better I

[20:40] think but it's gonna look this whole thing is happening in like six weeks it's all happening in

[20:48] six weeks and it's gonna be crazy it's gonna be crazy so we'll see all right so that's Jersey

[20:57] Jack Pinball they they just dropped an avatar code update is anybody does anyone here own avatar

[21:03] like it does anyone here are you gonna did anyone play the new code update for avatar is it good is

[21:11] it is it did they unmute clips like I don't know I don't know the other thing is this if you were

[21:18] expecting them to make the blue light work better on the CES of the game it's not gonna happen

[21:25] so yeah so there's that um all right he's got avatar anyone got avatar should we talk about

[21:35] spooky saw this video man man evil dead looks good it looks really good and

[21:46] then I actually think the light show in evil dead it's just so good they they they there's no

[21:56] reason why spooky machines should have such superior light shows then stern pinball right think about

[22:03] it man stern charges you 13k and evil dead's light show is so much nicer it's at the point now we're

[22:11] when you when we're looking now at a machine aesthetically I think spooky pinball now is the number

[22:19] two nicest looking machine in all the pinball it's still Jersey Jack at the top like Jersey Jack

[22:26] with their rad cows and the just the way the jjp machine just everything the big screen in the back

[22:32] like it's Jersey Jack is the is is the at the top of the most aesthetically beautiful pinball platform

[22:41] and spookies number two number two and and when you think about the origins going from America's

[22:49] most honoured arguably the ugliest pinball machine of all time to where they are now

[22:57] that there's got to be a beautiful moment in in charlie and bug and Luke and and and and and you know

[23:05] and everybody over there the family over there and you put America's most honoured

[23:10] and you put it next to evil dead and you've got to just have this feeling of achievement

[23:18] of continual innovation and progress and oh my gosh we're making machines that look this good

[23:27] look at this I get yes everybody we all will collectively tell spooky get rid of the servos

[23:32] if you just get rid of the servos but other than that like the the the machines are stunning

[23:40] stunning and when they take this stunning platform now and and they've got

[23:48] francey crushing it he's them and they they sink that up with a theme that's going to be more

[23:57] mainstream beetle juice you they were going to sell out a beetle juice instantly instantly

[24:10] I don't even know like I've already bought it I haven't even announced it I've already bought it I

[24:15] bought it in my head we're all going to want to own beetle juice but if they don't have a microphone

[24:22] in the game that listens to you like Alexa you need to be able to turn on the machine by saying

[24:29] beetle juice beetle juice beetle juice I mean that that is just like I don't I know that sounds a

[24:32] little difficult I don't care someone need someone needs to make that a mod and and you can like

[24:38] we got to figure out a way to make that a mod it should come with a little you know Alexa

[24:43] Cuban side that just detects that but you know what I'm saying it's going to sell out instantly

[24:52] and it's next right it's next you get these beautiful evil deaths and then you're going to get

[24:58] this beetle juice gain Harry Potter coming out King Kong coming out starting to feel like a really

[25:03] good year now franchi you've done us you've done us a solid right you go and goonies not next okay

[25:12] I want to ask franchi because he might know this and he could set the record straight because I've

[25:17] been saying is I think that maybe barrels of fun I thought maybe they had goonies but now I know

[25:23] 100% that they don't that they don't have goonies I still think goonies is is is is a spooky title down

[25:33] the road I heard I heard what they're working on Jason App was right they're making doon that's

[25:45] what I heard heard from a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that the game they're making is doon

[25:53] it is based on the new doon movies so I don't really I just don't

[26:06] Timothy Shamalama ding dong and Zendaya like like I get it but I don't think this demo wants doon

[26:17] yeah it's just not I I gotta be candid with you like I get that doon got like critically I

[26:26] I found both movies to be boring drawn out not memorable scenes not memorable characters and I

[26:39] just found the whole thing to be like you know it's like all right cool I'll go see it in an iMac

[26:44] theater with the booming orchestration like that's really the only way that movie even remotely

[26:51] would keep me interested but would I ever go watch doon on a 55 inch TV he on my little soundbar

[26:57] no I just don't care and with David lunch passing away maybe the original doon would be the

[27:04] better one to make right blade runner yeah well blade runner has been the I blade runner has been

[27:15] melvin has the license for blade runner at dpx so that's also a real thing

[27:23] so that that that may happen the problem with blade runner gang is you don't get Harrison Ford

[27:30] you know you're not gonna get Harrison Ford's likeness with that license so who's who knows

[27:36] yeah I mean I think barrels his next game is gonna be interesting because if it's based on the new doon

[27:45] game and you know I just I don't know right and it's gonna come out against like much more in a

[27:56] nostalgic stuff and it's gonna be a battle man it's gonna be a battle it is um there's really like

[28:06] you know you don't have to sell a lot if you're barrels but I don't know man it's like

[28:11] I don't think any market research has been done I mean I talked to David Vanessy's a good guy but

[28:16] they're not doing market research they're not doing market research they're really not market

[28:24] research is actually putting out surveys and you can even get a hundred people have them sign an

[28:31] NDA and give them you know give them give them 10 themes that are available I think what's happened

[28:37] is not a lot is available anymore and that's the issue I'm reading some of your chats

[28:46] French said doon is a dog yeah I think it is a dog man I think it's gonna tank never

[28:56] ending story would be better absolutely the princess bride is a better theme than doon I love

[29:03] the princess bride movie I was saying this to a friend the other day when you want when you

[29:09] think about nostalgic movies that would make good pinball machines you know you really want something

[29:14] that would um oh French I was gonna ask you like if barrel like if barrels has goonies that was my

[31:43] is just 1984 top we've got ghost busters okay right that's been done we've got Indiana Jones and

[31:53] the Temple of Doom well how about somebody can you imagine if someone just made Raiders of the

[32:02] Law Start Temple of Doom Doom and you know and the last crusade just make one pin for each and

[32:12] we'd buy each one okay look at that number three gremlins right there number three

[32:19] number four karate kid right these are all great police academy now look police academy I'm gonna

[32:28] be candid here would be a better theme would be a better theme for barrels of fun then doom it would

[32:36] be you know and even though it only made 81 million dollars it made 81 million dollars

[32:44] in a year that is like speaks to more of your audience than doom does

[32:52] footloose I would not make a footloose pinball machine uh Beverly Hills cop I don't think that would

[32:59] sell either it's this obvious this community is not the most open-minded they're not I hold on

[33:05] it's like let me go show up this heat thing it's killing me hold on

[33:27] but already gang we've got gremlins karate kid police police academy three right there

[33:40] terms of endearmate know romancing the stone knows splash no purple rain yes a prince machine

[33:47] franchi knows this a prince machine would crush absolutely crush it um tight rope no the natural

[33:58] maybe a pitch and bat on the natural would work I'm gonna go down the list a little bit more

[34:03] I'll just do this because sometimes you see those things you know you get you get some of them

[34:08] sometimes down the list that might work um yeah for example like Conan the destroyer now Conan

[34:16] the barbarian just a Conan pinball machine would be great red dawn hmm the terminator isn't

[34:25] crazy the terminator I think the terminator must have come out the year before and this is like

[34:29] it carried over Friday the 13th the final chapter absolutely you know if they make a Friday the

[34:35] 13 spooky's gonna sell a lot of those and there we are number 26 right the last star fighter

[36:16] yes you barely host copmus a comment in the year back to the future number one how did stern pass

[36:24] on this when you when you really think about stern passing on back to the future they're just how

[36:29] to be a moment of absolute stupidity if I was set Davis and they passed on this title

[36:37] before I arrived I'd be like everybody get in here get in here what the were you thinking

[36:45] you passed on back to the future the number one movie of 1985 smacked dab in the middle of our

[36:53] buyer based demographic this is one of the greatest most iconic films of all time and you said we

[37:01] don't want to make it no we want to make black night we want to make dungeons and dragons we want to

[37:34] need the other rockies rocky four USA versus Russia Ivan Drago no easy way out hard song fire the best

[37:44] maybe the best movie soundtrack ever ever is the rocky four soundtrack okay oh my gosh right

[37:55] oh do you even need to do market research just go to these lists see what's available

[38:01] cocoon witness the goonies baby there we are police academy two fletch if you two a kill James

[38:12] national lampoon European vacation mask the breakfast club pale rider peewee's big adventure

[38:20] peewees is peewees would crush the things that crush are really the things that really have

[38:27] a world under glass potential and are fun and have and someone said this earlier the right vibes

[38:33] for pinball you know I'm saying you need the right vibes for pinball like I love Titanic but it's not

[38:40] the right vibe it's it's a avatar should have been the right vibe it's just not the movies just aren't

[38:45] memorable ET jagged-edge mad max mad max would work spies like us would work too spies like us would work

[38:56] if you made a spies like us barrels of fun you would sell more spies like us than you'd sell

[39:00] of dune I mean it fits you doctor doctor doctor doctor you know can you imagine the doctor doctor doctor

[39:08] on the pop bumpers like that's the mode you got to get them to say doctor like you know 100 times

[39:14] doctor doctor doctor do you want to make the incision or you know like there's there's so so much fun

[39:20] spies like us would be and again it's got that world under glass it's got the missile it's got like

[39:26] the snow it's got the outfits it's got you know all the stuff in in that movie and it's got a storyline

[39:32] where then you can then recreate it in pinball form with the beginning and an end right with a

[39:38] wizard mode getting to the like it's just great yeah and that oh my gosh that beautiful uh Russian

[39:46] actress where she plays the Russian one right oh what young boy did not fantasize to that scene in

[39:55] that movie when she's like taken off her ski suit and there's just like under like it's just

[40:01] this is the thing dude it's like the modern world you can't talk like this anymore you're not

[40:04] allowed to be like a horny young guy or kid who's just like just discovering like you know what I'm

[40:10] saying like nowadays I feel like you can't say that you can't be attracted to somebody you can you

[40:15] can then we've become you can't even tell people they look good you can you gotta be careful

[40:22] you gotta be careful you gotta be careful um hi let's go one more year let's go 1986 and see

[40:29] what 86 had for us okay yearly 86

[40:41] it's crazy when you look at how much how many more theaters I mean yeah this is another good year

[40:46] people top gun problem is you can't make top gun with time cruise and if without time cruise there

[40:57] isn't top gun crocodile dundee maybe it's got the right vibe back to school Rodney Dangerfield

[41:05] comedy maybe you want to sell 500 that's that kind of game aliens yes we got it already color purple

[41:14] no star Trek we've already got it ruthless people no adivaprika no fairs-buelers yes

[41:20] fairs-buelers would definitely work um down and out in Beverly Hills no color of money knows

[41:26] stand by me no legal eagles no colorbrost alone no jewel the Nile no no no let's go to lake

[41:35] let's just do a little let's jump forward a little bit okay let's jump forward to the 90s and see

[41:43] like what would be great from like mid 90s right because we just seem to go to the 80s but I'm

[41:48] just gonna go I'm just curious like what came out in 1995 and let's see what would be good

[41:57] for Pimble look at that right there toy story one jersey jack this is the toy story everybody want it

[42:11] Batman forever poke a hauntis a spent sure a spent sure it would work as a boutique company game

[42:19] Casper die hard would work any die hard but die hard one crimson tide golden eye water world

[42:28] you know in you know water world I'm there was there wasn't there there was a water world Pimble machine

[42:35] right but did someone make one is it a homebrew one is that would been heck made

[42:40] no he made a twister one no he made a he made a built-packs in machine that's what he made

[42:48] um but there is a water world machine dangerous mines seven Congo there's a Congo machine

[42:54] well this is interesting because when you're in 95 you know you now you're in a period where

[42:59] Valley Williams was making this stuff so you like you know stuff was made um I'm gonna stop sharing

[43:09] screen but I just want to say the um there's there's there's there's stuff right there's a lot of

[43:18] stuff out there and I know that licensing is a nightmare and that's the major problem that

[43:23] everybody faces is like we kind of think it's super easy to just oh yeah well cry to kid like

[43:28] why why wouldn't anybody make that like as if they're not also thinking that and you know then

[43:34] you got to get into the negotiations with all the different talent some of that talent has passed

[43:40] away some of those family estates might not want to be a part of anything so it's I could see why it's

[43:47] um it's really difficult but I also think where they need to lean in a little more is with relationships

[43:58] the way slash was able to get live and let die without paying any extra money

[44:04] slash knows a lot of people everyone loves slash from guns and roses right it's not

[44:08] axel he's not a hermit like axel like slashes out there and I bet if slash from guns and roses

[44:15] you know is in my honest opinion I would make slash a GNR in sort of like an honorary creative

[44:23] director at Jersey Jack Bimbo and say hey slash like I know you're super busy with everything

[44:28] musically but we would love your help every once in a while to make some phone calls for us to try

[44:33] to make you know some fun pinball machines based on themes that are sometimes hard for us to get

[44:39] the license and I'll give you an example slash like it's really hard for us to get Kurt Russell do you

[44:43] know Kurt at all or anyone who knows him well we would really love to get his permission to make a

[44:48] big trouble in little china pinball machine and you know and I think coming from you he would

[44:54] appreciate hearing how awesome it is to immortalize you know what one of his most beloved movies in

[45:02] in a pinball form so you know I just look I just think there's opportunity there to use relationships

[45:10] you never know until you try the reason we have avatar is because of relationships you know

[45:17] the abyss family knows or new john landau before he passed away and it's a you know it's unfortunate

[45:25] that he passed away but that's why avatar came to fruition and we got it it's just again like

[45:33] it is what it is it is what it is so I look I think 2025 is going to be a year of

[45:40] some really awesome themes so apparently on loser kid pinball podcast they asked Keith L win

[45:49] if the dragon in dnd was the OMG wow I can't believe this mech is what he saw when he had that

[45:59] feeling and he said it was not that mech so was it the king con mech that's going to be in his

[46:08] upcoming game there is a lot I think there's a lot of excitement around the key thelwyn king calm

[46:18] another game ladies and gentlemen just get on the list get on the list for an le they're going to

[46:25] make a thousand at least and yes because it is elwyn and because it is con and con has even more

[46:33] love affair than godzilla for people in america for sure I think it's going to be absolutely insane

[46:41] and I do mean this I think it's going to be incredible I think it's going to be special I think it's

[46:48] going to be you know I don't know if it's going to be con island or con in the irks city I think

[46:54] it has to be bold I don't think it can only be con island I think you're going to have to find a

[47:01] way to get king con to new york city like I just do I do and maybe that's the top or I don't know I

[47:08] don't know you know but whatever it is I think it's going to be big I think it's going to be explosive

[47:16] and I think it's going to be incredibly coded and I think it's going to shoot phenomenally well

[47:24] it's the best designer in modern pimble he is like I don't I don't know who's even second me I

[47:36] would say jack danger is number two when I think about modern pimble and who's designing the best

[47:43] pimble machines in modern times keep that one then jack danger I'm thinking about everything that's

[47:53] out there right now you know and then like you know maybe bug and Luke right the new spooky

[48:00] designs are good I don't am I missing something that's like incredibly design that yeah like you

[48:08] know like I don't even know like I don't think barrel is a fun even puts like design by it's like

[48:14] a team does the game who's joe's in the house where's joe i

[48:23] GI Joe okay oh George Gomez yeah I don't know like gang I love George but I I don't think

[48:34] James Bond was his last game was like the best layout I don't I always feel like with George's

[48:41] games like like they're like 80% of the way there then there's just like an area where he either like

[48:49] changed his mind on something or couldn't make something work or because of the cost of

[48:53] something he had to yank it out I always feel like you know what I'm saying I always feel like

[48:58] there's a section of his game that just doesn't feel like finished and I don't know the I don't

[49:05] think the bond layout is great I don't like the bond ramp location I don't I guess I've just

[49:12] never played a James Bond that was dialed in right um yeah barrels of fun with fury road

[49:27] and then the screen on the bottom displaying the car scenes

[49:30] yeah well what what do James Bond owners know that the rest of us don't you know like like I'm not

[49:42] the best pinball player but when I walk up to food fighters it shoots phenomenal I had a lot of fun

[49:49] playing X-Men I didn't notice all the X-Men issues that everyone's seeing right now but I thought

[49:55] X-Men shoots so good obviously Godzilla is a tremendous shooter iron maiden is an incredible shooter

[50:03] Jurassic Park I actually think Avengers is one of L-Wins most underrated games and I think Avengers

[50:13] I think where Avengers would have been so good is if the code wasn't just so damn confusing

[50:19] I think I think the code in Avengers was the big letdown but the layout of Avengers man it's awesome

[50:27] it's a fun game to shoot and I think also one of the reasons why Avengers was really fun to shoot

[50:33] is is we all knew we weren't buying one you know what I'm saying sometimes you just walk up to a game

[50:38] and you know because you don't have to like you know you're not going to be tempted to buy it

[50:43] you just kind of approach it with a much more open mind and you can have a lot more fun

[50:50] you know taking it for a world knowing you don't have to freaking hand over a big check

[50:56] bond over food fighters over X-Men there's no way that James Bond shoots better than food fighters

[51:03] like that like gang like no that is no that you you are not a good pinball critic if you think that

[51:12] James Bond has a better layout than food fighters not in a million years one is smooth and has so

[51:22] many interesting shots and it's just perfect like layout and one is just clunky all over the place

[51:32] I'm sorry guys sorry that that that missiles terrible that whole area is to and then they're like

[51:38] the left side with the scuba guy like it just kicks out doesn't really do much like what what is that

[51:48] the bond 60 it geez yeah I feel bad for those dudes who bought bond 60 it you know they they really

[51:54] it's just like such a forgettable game you know you ever just like wake up on a random Wednesday and

[51:59] you just forget they even made a a fourth version of James Bond you're like oh yeah

[52:05] forgot about that with that the pointless score reels that are not even like what like it's like

[52:09] it's like this weird like there was no point in putting in those scoring reels like

[52:15] the even wasting the engineering on it was a waste of time it doesn't do anything it doesn't make

[52:20] you feel anything it's just not even need it I love bond 60 it come on yeah yeah you love bond 60

[52:29] Samantha how much did you pay for bond 60 it would would you love it if you spend $21,000 with tax on it

[52:36] and then see itself for $12,000 the same year would you love it then no no

[52:43] that's the problem with it I love this Toyota love it I love this car you can't have more

[52:50] phone in a car than a lightweight real-world drive six-speed manual Subaru pretending to be a Toyota

[52:59] but if this car was 60,000 not like think about this car was 65,000 dollars would I love this car

[53:05] no no wouldn't love it

[53:16] we all agree on James Bond so you know what I'm saying like everybody everybody agrees like nobody

[53:20] nobody only at the very beginning I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna jab at Zach we've been we've

[53:26] been on friendly terms for very long time but I remember Zach when it official when it first

[53:30] came out Zach was like yeah man like it's gonna I think they priced it right you know you don't

[53:35] hear him say that anymore I don't I don't even know if that clip exists I I'm not sure if he took

[53:41] it down if he pulled the Canadian deleted it but he remember when it first came out you know you had

[53:45] some of those guys were like yeah it only 500 keep that win like 20 grand like they they

[53:52] yeah you know that it was like you know you start because it was like because here's the problem

[53:59] with Bond six is it is the moment you stand over it it's as ugly it's ugly to stand over

[54:06] like it's not it's boring to play compared to like the other James Bond game it shoots great

[54:12] for a six thousand dollar pen it's a six thousand dollar game it's a six thousand dollar game

[54:18] and if they priced it like it it should have been priced then we all it should have been a six

[54:25] thousand dollar game that went up in value to ten thousand dollars not a twenty thousand dollar

[54:30] game that sunk down to ten thousand dollars and they should have handed everybody a James Bond

[54:36] sixty as a special treat they should have rewarded their loyal Ellie buyers by giving them the

[54:44] ability to buy it for six thousand see this is where Stern messed up because they had a golden

[54:49] opportunity to solidify themselves as a company that cares and respects its collector community

[54:56] instead they got greedy they overcharged everybody everyone who bought one lost money 500 people whether

[55:03] they were distributors dealers or consumers everybody who bought your James Bond 60 is now never

[55:09] going to forget what you asked for the game they're never going to forget the moment you got greedy

[55:15] and you abused them you abused your position as a pinball company releasing that basic game for

[55:21] twenty thousand dollars it was a slap in the face to everyone who collects pinball and they dragged

[55:28] Ellen through it too you know you took your most popular designer and you made him a part of a

[55:34] marketing like you know terrible marketing moment for your company and and then seemingly nobody

[55:41] wanted to be accountable this is the part that really still gets me a little bit like come on guys

[55:46] at least just own up to it even when I talk to George it's like well we didn't price it at that

[55:50] the dealer know you did George it was on Stern's website it was on your website for nineteen thousand

[55:57] nine hundred and ninety nine dollars why do they keep saying they didn't price it at that then

[56:01] then who at Stern went on the Stern website and said nineteen thousand nine hundred and ninety nine

[56:08] dollars I have like I have the screen grab that's what you charged you know show us the receipts show

[56:16] us the invoices you sent out to people and that without tax and without shipping because when you buy

[56:22] off Stern dot com you pay tax it's like twenty one thousand eight hundred dollars to get the game

[56:34] you know just because people have money doesn't mean you you need to treat them like they're stupid

[56:38] right I mean I do this show every week people five dollars a month to hear all the content this is free

[56:47] because of overwhelming pressure by some of you I've moved from Facebook over to here now I would look

[56:56] gang I mean this when I say this there's some of you that are not subscribers and I would appreciate it if

[57:01] you would subscribe and and also subscribing to please like it takes so I can keep doing it here on

[57:07] YouTube because I I will go back to Facebook because I am losing all of the revenue I used to generate

[57:14] with this so I would just consider this part of your five dollar subscription and if you think about

[57:19] it like that you're getting usually two to three podcasts a week that are hitting on what the

[57:26] news is and the discussion is happening you also get this you also get access to the Patreon chat

[57:32] which is the greatest most impossible to follow pinball chat and the history of pinball chats but it's

[57:38] a lot of fun and I tell people it's like a wrestling match you just come in from the top rope don't

[57:44] don't worry about what happened it's like you know royal rumble right when someone runs in from

[57:48] the locker room area and just jumps into the ring that's what that chat is like don't try to scroll back

[57:54] and see what's happened since you were last there don't don't even bother because guess what you know

[58:02] what we talk about every day bond over in Japan complains about James bond sorry about uh

[58:09] Elton John being empty he has funny memes and he owns a vehement things it's good

[58:14] ah whatever um you know there's a lot of love for spooky spooky Luke hangs out there franches in

[58:20] there um you know we've got uh there's a lot of hate for Jersey Jack pinball in that thread but

[58:27] you know what I think people want to say nice things about jjp they just you just got to give them

[58:33] a reason to okay a lot of discussion around stern and its prices and d&d a lot of love for d&d

[58:40] you know a lot of love for metallica remastered you know when i'm reading the room um but overall

[58:45] it's just a good group of guys and look nobody's like fighting or arguing and we had some contentious

[58:51] people in there recently someone called someone in efface and then thread in to fight them on the

[58:57] streets of philadelphia and and i blocked them i kicked them out i also think he cancelled his

[59:05] membership like an hour before i blocked them and it's like cool he was gone you know i don't

[59:11] tolerate any of that there so i don't even curse you know it's funny to me that people look

[59:16] in there so he's so toxic so negative job i don't curse like nobody's fighting and and a lot of

[59:23] the people that don't like my content they just haven't heard it in years too because it's like well

[59:29] if i only said negative stuff about pinball nobody would follow that would be really boring and

[59:34] really stale but but if you're not balanced and you just always chill everything that a company does

[59:41] you know there's some people that that's fine you know everyone do what you want to do the problem

[59:47] is when you get when you do that then nobody knows when to take you seriously because then you start

[59:53] hyping stuff like venom and john wick and you it's just annoying because you you are getting some

[59:58] kickbacks from distros that you're helping sell games and that's that's you know you don't i don't

[01:00:04] really want to you know i i don't i don't want to hear from someone who i know is just glorifying

[01:00:10] something because they're being paid to then you're just a you know you're paid influence or you're

[01:00:15] not really an objective content creator canada is better now than years past well you know

[01:00:26] we all mature i just mature much slower than most people

[01:00:31] yeah i was listening to college kids present yesterday and it's it was it was really interesting

[01:00:37] seeing the enthusiasm of these kids presenting to a client and um and it's weird being next to people

[01:00:44] that you are 25 years older than these people right 25 years older than these students and when

[01:00:55] you know i'm standing next i don't look 25 twice the age nope it's just but i am

[01:01:02] in don't way i don't do anything creepy i just it was it was it was fun to

[01:01:09] see enthusiasm to work in our company too it's like you know young kids are like

[01:01:13] oh that it's like that's what i was saying like young kids are shilling my company to me

[01:01:18] i go in every day and it's like they think it's amazing every day right because they don't

[01:01:23] know yet what it's like to go in day in and day out there's obviously good days there's there's bad

[01:01:28] days there's you know there's there's pressure days there's days where you feel amazing

[01:01:34] but every young person should have that sort of blind optimism as they look towards the future

[01:01:40] that is what i think more young kids need to have and they're also not as lame as the damn

[01:01:46] data suggests like they they still drink and go out and party they just don't have i don't i don't

[01:01:52] think there was many outlets as they used to and i think social media just kills a lot of the the

[01:01:57] more introverted kids out there you know the extroverts have to go out it's Saturday have a drink

[01:02:06] k unhinged um Ralph is a nice guy but why it's you starting to eat him or what well

[01:02:11] well it's fine Ralph is sponsored by flipping out so and that's i think that sponsorship is pretty

[01:02:17] transparent um you know i'm just not sure how much money he makes to to i don't know

[01:02:28] but i don't you know i don't think Ralph is a bad guy at all i don't i absolutely

[01:02:33] if i saw Ralph we'd hang out and talk pinball i don't have any beef with anybody i don't i really don't

[01:02:40] i i'm not i now i don't listen to a lot of content creators anymore um just because the vibe of

[01:02:48] the hobby you know the the more the games are exciting the more i want to hear other people's

[01:02:54] opinions about them um and it's look i think now everyone is just spoiled with so much pinball

[01:03:01] content now someone said this to me earlier today and it's like one of the reasons why i think like

[01:03:06] shows like tpf are not going to be nearly as popular moving forward one of the reasons is this

[01:03:11] and and he said something really smart he's like you used to have to like go to a show

[01:03:17] to really like experience a game and to know like a game and and yes why do you still have to play a game

[01:03:23] with so much content creation now i don't feel nearly as like disconnected from the product like

[01:03:31] there's just so much out there now that i i don't really feel the need to fly to all these pinball

[01:03:37] shows now i do think pinball on the beach is going to be a really fun time i was looking at the

[01:03:44] the opportunity to go and and Brenda just because Brenda's new company was partnered with fandall

[01:03:52] she might have to work super bowl weekend like go into the office on ride a saturday which means

[01:03:58] i couldn't go so yeah so that sucks but it's going to be fun i think everyone's going to have a great

[01:04:05] time um but you know i've um i don't know i think everyone would rather there be no beef or

[01:04:16] animosity between this show and and wait wait right now like the only guys that i think the only

[01:04:21] two guys that don't talk to me now are are don and jangus i'm trying to think of anybody else

[01:04:26] is still like well and then my friend Derek who he he left the hobby you know Derek didn't just

[01:04:34] like cancel me because i didn't vote for Kamala Harris and i don't get political you see me i'm

[01:04:41] like i look i think all politicians are scumbags don't get me wrong i just don't like the the crazy

[01:04:47] progressive far far left policies and i don't like cancel culture and i don't i don't i just don't

[01:04:52] like the joyless world the progressive left wants to jam down our throats and i and i don't think

[01:04:59] Derek does either right it's like the but the thing is he he gave all of it up he gave all of it up

[01:05:08] so yeah like i wish him the best you know you got to remember gang this is someone this is my best

[01:05:17] friend in pinball this is someone who actually became like my best friend in life for about five

[01:05:23] years i i talked to him every day like every day we always talked we always had a good conversation

[01:05:30] we you know he visited in new york i saw him every time i was in texas he had plans to come over for

[01:05:36] the holiday he was supposed to come with me to tokyo from my 50th birthday party that i'm going to do

[01:05:42] there so you know he was playing the memory i must have recorded it it's like i hear it above me

[01:05:55] but it's um you know live and let live man everyone goes through things everyone goes through

[01:06:01] things and in the end in the end you can't believe in Jesus if you do believe in Jesus and you can't be

[01:06:13] a spiritual person who doesn't if you don't believe in forgiveness and you think everyone is

[01:06:23] you know uh i that's it like i just and also just i don't know holding on to anger

[01:06:31] is just just so painful like it was just painful walking in the jersey jack

[01:06:36] everyone's dude everyone was just having a good time everybody was you know Colin jason nap

[01:06:44] everyone like the loser kid was there like people that like had real beef like real beef

[01:06:50] and we're all there as a guest to the company paying for us to be there and you know

[01:06:55] i i i think walking across the aisle and just offering to shake don's hand and say hey man like let's

[01:07:03] just let bygones be bygones that was a moment in which all of it would have just gone away

[01:07:09] and and and we you know no i don't want none of that and then like what so why like you know he's

[01:07:16] got a live with that and then you know jang is the same way it's funny when you're a jang is like oh

[01:07:22] yeah i mean people like he i don't even like it it's just he's another guy he's to be really close

[01:07:28] friend it is what it is you know in the end i'm glad that my best friend is my wife

[01:07:37] and when you have the right partner you're you're like you've got wealth beyond measure i mean

[01:07:49] that you you literally have wealth beyond measure you are you're more successful than anybody with

[01:07:55] a lot of money who's not happy who they're next to or feels like they you know they didn't i don't

[01:08:02] know be the parent they want to be or achieve what they want to achieve i don't know i don't know

[01:08:08] what i'm trying to say here um Alice is adventures in wonderland they are behind schedule

[01:08:20] uh i'm a dutch let's talk about dutch let's talk about dutch okay

[01:08:31] they're delayed already and it's not like anyone's worried they're going to get their game or not

[01:08:38] but it's i think the part of this game and and i love melvin williams

[01:08:46] he's a really cool dude like he's too cool for pinball the fact that he can make this game in a year

[01:08:53] when robert mule or burn through sixty one million dollars and couldn't make a game work and and

[01:08:59] and melvin's fixed raza he's like dude raza like was not right like i re-engineered this this

[01:09:05] this and this my raza play is amazingly well um most likely raza will be the next game

[01:09:11] he he it's it's not going to be magic girl it's most likely going to be raza the one issue with

[01:09:17] raza that he's trying to figure out is how to how to make the the the screen work because deep

[01:09:23] root have that really long like european you know license plate size screen how can he can he

[01:09:34] salvage all that work and put it into the normal dutch screen size which is a normal you know

[01:09:41] sort of stern dutch pinball LCD screen same size as like spooky um so that's what he's looking at

[01:09:49] you know and obviously back to the future i have no idea i have no idea but the thing about

[01:09:57] alice is the code like i just they've been working on it i just i don't really you know but you

[01:10:06] know what you haven't seen is like you know i don't know they're not like streaming the progress then

[01:10:10] you're not really you're in on it you're in on it like and look the launch was really shaky and bad

[01:10:19] you know in terms of like showing the game to the and they still sold them all so i don't know like

[01:10:24] if you're melvin and you're bearier kind of like well look like we did enough we did enough to get

[01:10:31] the orders people have enough confidence they're going to get the games oh there's going to be no

[01:10:35] pinbar in uh in the new raza uh he he's already decided on that that's gone that that is not making

[01:10:42] its way into the new game um so the back to the future is just i just stern wants to make it with dutch

[01:10:58] berry wants probably more money than they want to give him and i do think in the end

[01:11:06] it needs to be a stern or you know i don't know maybe american pinball now that they just want to

[01:11:14] contract manufacture it maybe they could come in and make them with dutch i don't think berry wants

[01:11:21] to get in bed with mucache i don't i don't think that's going to happen i don't think ap's going

[01:11:28] to become a pinball contract manufacturing company i i don't see that as i just don't think people

[01:11:35] want to do it i think you know it is kind of crazy that everyone's manufacturing so independently

[01:11:42] is this facts what's facts

[01:11:48] now you can't you it doesn't work like that Ryan you you can't once a contract is signed and a deal is

[01:11:53] signed you you can't break the contract berry could then sue them for all the you know for all the

[01:12:00] lost revenue that he was anticipating and stern's not trying to steal it out from underneath them it's just

[01:12:08] i mean in my honest opinion i don't know how all these deals work i think that you just give berry

[01:12:15] five hundred dollars for every game sold and you just make a premium and an elite version of the

[01:12:21] game no pros and you just sell five thousand like you sell you sell one thousand elis and

[01:12:29] six thousand premiums and berry gets his few million dollars and everybody wins and here's

[01:12:37] this crazy gang is like you could just increase the price just because and everyone would know

[01:12:41] we're making this pro thirteen five because we had to you know i think they're going to make them

[01:12:47] i think they're going to make the elis thirteen five anyway i think they're going to make them

[01:12:50] thirteen six anyway even without needing to give berry his cut for back to the future

[01:12:56] you know Ryan i yeah i just think i just think that um

[01:13:03] you're not wrong i mean berries got he's got his ego you know and i think he's got his desire

[01:13:12] to be the guy that made the greatest back to the future machine and and you know we all know now

[01:13:20] because we didn't know it back then but we know now he's not going to make a better machine than

[01:13:26] Keith L. Winwood if stern through everything at it because it's not just the you know layout it's

[01:13:33] everything it's the coding it's the art it's all of it like he literally was just going to put the

[01:13:39] logo on the side of the cabinet the way he did the big the big lebausky like that's what the

[01:13:43] art was going to be for his back to the future cabinet so i don't know i i i don't think you're

[01:13:51] going to see it next year i also think we're in a space now gang with pinball where it's going to

[01:13:57] get really interesting i really do think we're gonna i don't know i feel like we're going to be

[01:14:04] gaining people into the hobby and losing people at the same time i think uh you know if these

[01:14:10] new games are as awesome as i'm hearing i think a lot of you are going to have to sell some of

[01:14:15] your stuff to get them and those games are going to sit for a while and people are just going to be

[01:14:19] at a room and it's going to get um you know it's going to it's going to get really competitive

[01:14:24] finding a spot in people's people's homes okay and you know let me just let me just get to this matrix

[01:14:30] question for Josh that you will not most likely not see a matrix pinball machine the reason why

[01:14:36] is the matrix pinball machine license comes with nothing nothing no piano no learns fish porn like

[01:14:43] it's not happening it's such a convoluted license between Warner Brothers and though the

[01:14:48] witch house key what sister is now and whatever it is like it's just it's a licensing nightmare

[01:14:55] that's the reason why stern didn't make it back in the day it just won't work um so yeah

[01:15:04] so steve ritchie is not i i think he wants to make top gun next i just don't think they're

[01:15:11] going to be able to get the the license for a top gun or get tom cruise is likeness in it

[01:15:18] so that's the issue you know and and you know we don't talk about it but supposedly jgp has sonnet

[01:15:27] the hedgehog um tom cruise won't do any deals the dudes a billionaire he doesn't want any of his stuff

[01:15:41] out of his control it's the way like michael jordan used to not be in the basketball games and he

[01:15:46] just doesn't need it so again get slash the call of tom cruise tom tom tom tom tom let's do a pinball

[01:16:01] machine together you know all re-record the iconic do you imagine that so tom i got an idea

[01:16:13] i've always wanted to like record your top gun theme song how about we do it in a pinball machine

[01:16:20] and you know i heard that you don't normally do these things but like can i explain why it would be

[01:16:26] awesome i don't know maybe it's worth asking slash to do it

[01:16:28] yeah

[01:16:36] scientology says he can't be marketed man do you see they killed the scientologist whistleblower

[01:16:42] um again have an awesome saturday enjoy the football it's going to be a great weekend i'm taking

[01:16:50] the chiefs over the Texans i think the bills are going to beat the ravens i think the Rams are

[01:16:57] going to upset the eagles and i think i don't know what the other game is what's the other game

[01:17:07] um what game am i missing the lions yes the lions are going to walk all over the team they're
