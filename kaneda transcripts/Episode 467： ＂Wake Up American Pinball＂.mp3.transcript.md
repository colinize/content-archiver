[00:00] Oh, the one thing I never understood, I don't listen to Chris.

[00:04] I listen to him a little bit and I was like, I can't take this guy.

[00:06] And that's fine.

[00:07] I just, whatever.

[00:08] It doesn't matter.

[00:09] Yeah, it doesn't.

[00:10] I could have saw her for a million times.

[00:11] He was like, only an idiot would just buy a machine, only a jerk would buy a machine

[00:16] without ever playing it.

[00:17] Looking at it, well, that's what he just did, didn't he?

[00:23] You know, 750 people just like me bought a Rick and Morty without ever playing

[00:29] it first is Kaneda Hipper Crit.

[00:32] That was the poor man's pinball podcast.

[00:34] I love those guys.

[00:35] They had their little special guest, Martin on Hey, Martin, you should listen to Kaneda's

[00:38] pinball podcast because you might learn a thing or two and I am not, I am not adverse

[00:45] to working on games.

[00:46] I've done some work to games in the past.

[00:49] I don't want to have to pull out a soldering iron on a brand new game.

[00:55] And the fact that all new pinball machines require adjustments.

[01:00] That's cool.

[01:01] That's cool.

[01:02] But not significant adjustments to make basic shots that should work in the game function

[01:08] properly.

[01:09] Nobody wants to open up a $7,000 to $9,000 new-in-box toy and have to start adjusting stuff to

[01:16] get the game to shoot the right way.

[01:18] I get you might have to do it, but you should not have to do it.

[01:23] Okay.

[01:24] Next episode of Kaneda's pinball podcast.

[01:26] I have some good news regarding spooky pinball and Rick and Morty owners out there.

[01:31] We're going to talk about deep-root pinball delaying their launch and reveal party that

[01:37] was supposed to happen March 25th.

[01:39] We're also going to talk about American pinball's marketing strategy around the launch of

[01:45] hot wheels.

[01:46] We're going to spend most of the time talking about that.

[01:50] I don't understand it.

[01:52] I really don't understand it.

[01:54] Let's start off with some really good news because everyone just wants some good news

[01:59] in the pinball world.

[02:00] I'm here to tell you right now if you ordered a Rick and Morty and you have listened to

[02:06] my last few shows about the tweaks that you can do to your game to make that upper spinner

[02:14] shot work better.

[02:16] I'm here to tell you some really good news.

[02:19] Charlie and Chuck and Charlie and Chuck are the same person.

[02:23] Spooky pinball is going to make those tweaks from the factory.

[02:27] If you don't have your game yet and your game hasn't been built yet, they are going to

[02:32] make those tweaks from the factory.

[02:34] That's music to everybody's ears.

[02:37] Okay.

[02:38] If you have your game, the good news is making that tweak is really easy and you should

[02:43] listen to those shows about how to do the tweak.

[02:47] I think you'll do it in just a few minutes and your game will be working much, much better.

[02:52] Charlie told me they took the screws out on even the prototype game which was the hardest

[02:58] shot to make and he said it played so much better when they removed the screws.

[03:03] I still think it's kind of funny to remove screws from a game as being the fix.

[03:10] Maybe just don't put the screws in in the first place.

[03:14] That just goes to show.

[03:16] Stuff happens between prototype and final production and maybe they're moving too fast

[03:20] and not catching everything and they need to just get games on the line.

[03:24] Speaking of getting games on the line, I don't know if you saw this.

[03:27] I didn't know this was coming but Spooky pinball is moving to a larger facility in Benton,

[03:33] Wisconsin and they shared photos on Facebook of that move happening.

[03:38] What does that mean for Rick and Morty manufacturing?

[03:40] There definitely has to be a little bit of a delay now in getting games out.

[03:46] Are they still on schedule to get 10 games out a week?

[03:50] I think they're a little bit behind.

[03:54] This definitely will throw a little bit of a wrinkle into that and I know some of you

[03:58] out there are counting the weeks and trying to predict exactly when you're going to get

[04:03] your game.

[04:04] You might want to factor in the fact that they just moved to a new facility.

[04:08] Unfortunately for me, game number 50 is almost ready.

[04:13] It's going to be ready this week or next week but I got an unfortunate letter slipped

[04:19] under my door in New York City.

[04:21] I've got the money ready but now my building management company is telling me that no

[04:27] deliveries of furniture or large deliveries will be allowed to happen in the building because

[04:34] of the coronavirus.

[04:36] And so this sucks because all I wanted to do knowing that I'm going to be working from

[04:41] home for so many weeks if not months now is put the Rick and Morty into my apartment

[04:47] and I don't think I can do that now.

[04:50] And so I might have to have spooky hold on to it until I can take delivery.

[04:55] Now, I could probably grease the dorm in and the super to let those guys come up and deliver

[05:00] it.

[05:02] I also think that would be irresponsible and being a bad neighbor because there's a reason

[05:08] why we have some of these quarantine things in effect and it's not so each of us can behave

[05:14] selfishly to still go about life as normal.

[05:18] It's the simple fact is you don't know if those delivery guys have it.

[05:22] Then they're bringing it into the building and there is no way for delivery guys to drop

[05:27] off your game and for you to be within six feet of it as you're maybe there is but it's

[05:33] just not worth it because then they have to get into the elevator.

[05:36] Are you going to get into the elevator with them?

[05:38] It's just and then if my neighbors see that when the rest of us are being told no more

[05:43] large deliveries, no people can't even do renovations in their apartments right now because

[05:48] of this whole situation they won't let workers into the building.

[05:52] How much does that suck if your apartment is in the middle of a renovations?

[05:56] So it will come.

[05:57] I will get it when the timing is right and I think this is just the beginning of more and more

[06:02] of our lives being disrupted with supply chain issues and delivery issues and we're all in the

[06:08] same boat.

[06:09] I look at it pretty positively like when this thing passes people are going to come out better

[06:15] than ever before.

[06:16] We're going to go out and we're going to support all the small businesses we love.

[06:19] We're going to go out and we're going to give large tips to all the bartenders that

[06:22] have haven't had tips in a while and we will bounce back.

[06:26] I firmly believe that.

[06:28] This isn't like the real estate crash of 2008 in which there's a reason why everything

[06:34] blew up economically.

[06:36] This is not going to be like that.

[06:38] I don't think so.

[06:39] Okay.

[06:40] So let's talk about deep root.

[06:42] The other company out there that has suspended their reveal plans.

[06:46] Do I think it was smart for deep root to say you know what now is not the right time?

[06:51] Absolutely.

[06:52] Absolutely.

[06:53] The right move by Robert Mueller and company to say we're not going to do our reveal plan

[06:57] now because of all this and it makes sense.

[07:01] They were planning a big reveal.

[07:03] They were planning for people to come in.

[07:06] Most people let's be honest.

[07:07] Almost everyone going to deep root was simply stopping by on their way to T.P.F.

[07:14] If you remove T.P.F from the situation then there is no T.P.F.

[07:19] And then there is no reason to stop by deep root beforehand because you're not even

[07:22] going to the final destination.

[07:24] I know that Robert was working to have many, many razes at T.P.F.

[07:30] And at first he saw it as a little bit of okay we don't have to make as many razes if

[07:34] we're only doing our deep root reveal.

[07:36] But then it just became clear that it was even irresponsible probably for them to ask

[07:41] people to come by.

[07:42] And also it's just the climate.

[07:44] It's the overall climate of where we are right now revealing a pinball machine right now

[07:50] a non-essential item for people showing it to the world right now is the most idiotic

[07:56] thing you can do.

[07:57] And I know that some people had this planned and they were waiting for it and I think

[08:02] we're going to talk about this as we talk about American pinball and even what P3 is doing.

[08:07] I know that a lot of people out there are anxious to get the word out on what they've

[08:11] been working on.

[08:13] And this was the time frame in which they were going to show that stuff to the world.

[08:18] But for those companies not adjusting their marketing strategy and just still doing what

[08:24] they had planned on the same timeline is absolutely moronic.

[08:29] And I know you agree with that because how many of you out there are reaching into your

[08:33] wallets right now saying the thing I need to invest in is pinball.

[08:38] If you're going to buy anything right now go buy some stocks at bargain basement prices

[08:42] but to buy a pinball machine right now that you don't really need is one of the dumbest

[08:47] places to put your money.

[08:49] And maybe some of you are so wealthy you don't care.

[08:52] But even the wealthy people usually you get wealthy by making smart financial decisions.

[08:57] So I can't imagine why anyone would not adjust their marketing strategy right now.

[09:04] I think we're still going to see heavy metal this week on March 20th because that to

[09:11] me is a game that's already paid for.

[09:14] Like the folks over at heavy metal they already paid Stern to have these games made.

[09:19] So they're just going to get the news out there and they're going to want to get the

[09:22] game out into the world.

[09:24] And I don't think this is a major game for Stern.

[09:26] It's not a major title for most of you out there.

[09:30] And I don't think many people are going to order heavy metal.

[09:33] But you know maybe they feel like they had all those marketing materials going where

[09:37] they said 320 was the launch date.

[09:40] So Deeproot.

[09:41] So Deeproot the other question then becomes when will we see retro atomic zombie adventure

[09:46] land.

[09:47] Ironically we're kind of living in a retro atomic zombie adventure land.

[09:50] For some of you out there and I hear the jokes and I hear people saying well here we go

[09:55] again.

[09:56] Deeproot pinball once again is delaying and buying time and how convenient I've heard that

[10:02] word.

[10:03] This is so convenient for Deeproot to have this excuse to not show us all of what they've

[10:09] been working on and to not show us a proof point that all the hype and all the hyperbole

[10:15] is worth it.

[10:16] That Raza and their platform and the new things they're bringing to pinball all the all

[10:21] the big bold talk will be justified when they pull back the curtain at Deeproot pinball.

[10:26] Now what this does do is it gives Robert more time to figure out manufacturing.

[10:32] It gives Robert more time to maybe polish the code on Raza.

[10:35] I have no idea where this game is code wise.

[10:38] I have no idea what the delays are in getting this game together.

[10:42] I look at it like they've had so much time.

[10:45] How could anything be possibly down to the wire for them?

[10:49] They've been making Raza for years now.

[10:53] John Papaduke has been making it for almost a decade.

[10:56] What is taking so long on getting just one pinball machine made?

[11:01] And I sort of look at the whole scenario like that.

[11:03] I know Robert's got a lot of different things they're planning to implement into the pinball

[11:08] world.

[11:09] Ultimately, make a great game.

[11:12] Make a game people want and you don't have to do much more than that to build your pinball

[11:17] empire slowly.

[11:19] I think they want to build an empire overnight that's bigger than the normal pathway for

[11:24] most of these boutique companies because I don't think they see themselves as boutique.

[11:29] But I can't imagine Raza selling a lot.

[11:33] No matter what is in it, I can't imagine a theme like that selling a significant amount

[11:38] of games.

[11:39] I just don't.

[11:40] But I do hear a rumor.

[11:41] I hear a rumor that deep roots license theme pin is one that a lot of people are really

[11:49] excited about.

[11:50] And a lot of people are saying it's worth waiting for to see what that license pin is.

[11:56] And why would you come out the gates with a non-license game if you really want to get

[12:01] sales going and get money coming in the door?

[12:04] I think almost all pinball, almost all pinball if you want good sales requires a good theme.

[12:12] If you go the other way and try to do original theme, there's a really good chance you're

[12:17] going to have a sales flop.

[12:19] It doesn't mean the game's not good.

[12:21] It just means it's probably not going to sell very well.

[12:24] But as we'll see when we talk about hot wheels, theme is not everything.

[12:28] I think you're going to get where I'm coming from when I get you have the theme.

[12:32] But then it's like, what did you do with it?

[12:35] How did you launch it?

[12:36] And what was your strategy around that theme?

[12:39] That also is very, very important.

[12:42] Okay?

[12:43] All right.

[12:44] So deep root, deep root delays.

[12:45] All right.

[12:46] So who's not delaying?

[12:47] So Jerry at P3 is not going to delay.

[12:50] And he is going to show what he's been working on with the new P3 multi-morphic platform.

[12:56] So that's another guy who must be really bummed out that T-P-F is not happening because

[13:02] T-P-F is always Jerry's big show.

[13:04] I mean, he usually brings a lot of games.

[13:07] He lines them up all next to each other.

[13:09] For most of you who have gone to T-P-F a few years in a row, you probably could find Jerry's

[13:14] multi-morphic section blindfolded as you walked in because it's always in the same place.

[13:19] You walk in.

[13:20] You make a little left and a little right.

[13:23] And then he's right there on that right side.

[13:25] Especially behind where the check-in tables are with all of his P3s lined up.

[13:30] I've seen it there two years, three years now.

[13:33] And so that shows not happening.

[13:35] Unfortunately for a guy like Jerry, his thing usually requires hands-on time to see the

[13:42] full potential of whatever it is.

[13:44] I don't know what it is.

[13:46] I don't know if this is going to bring people to the P3 platform.

[13:50] I see that people are struggling to even sell used P3 systems.

[13:56] A $10,000 P3 multi-morphic system is trading on the second-hand market for around $6,700.

[14:05] That's unbelievable.

[14:08] So it's going to be hard for him even if he shows this game to then try and get people

[14:13] to buy into the platform at $10,000.

[14:17] And I know he can list all the titles of Barnyard and this and that and rocks and hooping it

[14:22] up, Jerry.

[14:23] But I still think this game, the weight that this new game has on its shoulders, the hurdle

[14:31] that this game needs to overcome is going to be significant.

[14:35] And so I can't wait to see it.

[14:37] I'm a little nervous that it's not going to be as great as the creator probably thinks

[14:43] it is.

[14:44] And it's not a license theme.

[14:46] So right off the bat, I could tell you right now that no matter what Jerry has made here,

[14:51] no matter what the original storyline is, no matter what the theme is, this game is

[14:56] coming out with two strikes already.

[14:59] It's coming out down by a few runs in the bottom of the ninth.

[15:03] It doesn't, it's not going to have a built-in fan base or audience.

[15:08] Jerry's had so many years to go get a license theme and he still has not.

[15:14] And I don't understand that.

[15:16] Why would you start a pinball company and not have a license theme?

[15:20] There are nights when I just sit up wondering how people get into a room and say we're going

[15:25] to start a pinball company.

[15:27] Okay, we're going to make something that's going to get pinball people excited about

[15:32] a game.

[15:33] Okay.

[15:34] And what should the theme be?

[15:35] Well, what about full throttle?

[15:36] Okay, let's make that game.

[15:38] How do you do that?

[15:39] How do you sit in a room and say, well, let's do a game about a carnival that's

[15:46] an outer space, right?

[15:48] We'll call it cosmic carnival.

[15:50] Think of fun house meets aliens.

[15:53] Like let's make that the theme of our pinball machine if we want to sell the product.

[15:57] Like what is wrong with people?

[16:00] How did these things even get passed?

[16:03] Just the concept stage if you want to sell games.

[16:07] So what's it going to be, Jerry?

[16:09] See here's the real problem with all this stuff.

[16:12] The rise of coming out with Jerry's original game coming out.

[16:17] The problem is that Stern is sitting on a juggernaut with teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

[16:26] And teenage mutant Ninja Turtles will be one of the best themes in pinball when people

[16:32] see it.

[16:33] And I get a lot of you out there might be like, well, it's a little bit like Hot Wheels.

[16:37] I'm not really in the Ninja Turtles.

[16:38] I'm fully confident that Stern and Zambietti and John Borg are going to create a colorful

[16:47] Ninja Turtles world that is going to pop in a way that I don't think any recent Stern

[16:54] has popped.

[16:55] I'm hearing that Zambietti has put his best art package ever into this game.

[17:01] And he is a super duper Ninja Turtles fanatic.

[17:05] And so he is so excited about the art packages on this game, which if this excites Zambietti,

[17:12] I know it's going to excite you.

[17:15] I'm also hearing that John Borg, a man who in the past has been so upset because he's

[17:22] had to yank stuff out of his games.

[17:24] I'm hearing that the Ninja Turtles game, he didn't have to remove the things he wanted

[17:30] in the game.

[17:31] And so he's super happy that everything he wanted in the game is in there.

[17:36] The final piece of this puzzle, because I think it's going to look awesome.

[17:39] I think it's going to have a lot of fun shots is who's coding this game.

[17:44] Everybody is praying that it's not too white.

[17:46] All right, we're all praying that.

[17:49] Is it, see, everyone, is it, is it Tano?

[17:52] Is that his name?

[17:53] The guy who did Deadpool?

[17:54] Is it going to be, what about Tim Sexton?

[17:56] He hasn't coded anything since Black Knight.

[17:58] He's up next on the coding roster.

[18:01] Everybody wishes it was Lyman Sheets, but he's going to be doing El Vira.

[18:05] So who's going to be the coder of this game?

[18:08] Is it going to be Lonnie?

[18:09] Is he going to code it?

[18:10] I don't know.

[18:11] I don't know who's going to code it.

[18:12] So I think the code and how that theme integration comes to life is really going to be the

[18:18] thing that might make or break Ninja Turtles.

[18:22] Because let's be honest, code is what killed monsters.

[18:25] Code is really the thing that sank that shit.

[18:27] Ninja Turtles, when it comes out and in pro format, is going to be the biggest competitor

[18:34] for other companies trying to go after operators, create a theme that kids like.

[18:39] It's really going to be a game that I think steals a lot of the sales away from all these

[18:45] other games that can't launch right now.

[18:49] And Stern can now strategically, strategically decide when they drop this thing.

[18:55] Because it's ready to go.

[18:56] I mean, we know Stern that this game is not delayed months because of anything other

[19:01] than possible supply delays for parts.

[19:05] But this game's finished in terms of being ready to reveal.

[19:09] And you know they were ready to reveal this thing in March, April.

[19:13] And it was right around the corner.

[19:14] Now do I think Stern Pimbal is going to have a delay because of coronavirus and parts

[19:19] and are they going to have to shut down the factory because of 400 people in a close

[19:24] proximity to each other making Pimbal machines?

[19:26] That's on them.

[19:27] I don't think most manufacturing is going to shut down during this period.

[19:31] People are obviously going to be asked to be safe.

[19:34] And maybe if the only place you go is go to work, don't congregate in other ways.

[19:39] I think the Stern engine will stay on through this period.

[19:43] Now does that mean they're going to launch this game while people are not going to buy

[19:48] it?

[19:49] Now that's the strategic question.

[19:50] If I were them, if I were Stern Pimbal, I would wait.

[19:54] There is no reason why it makes any financial sense to launch a game right now.

[20:00] I would hit pause and I would just wait to we start to see more of a recovery taking

[20:05] place in the global economy in the US economy.

[20:09] And for a lot of people out there, we're just at the beginning of shutting down cities,

[20:14] shutting down bars and restaurants.

[20:17] Operators are not going to be ordering your Ninja Turtle game right now because no

[20:20] one's going in to location play.

[20:23] Operators are going to get hit the hardest right now.

[20:26] And so even launching a game, you've got to imagine your operator orders are going to

[20:31] dry up significantly.

[20:33] It is in the history of Pimbal sales.

[20:35] I'm just going to say this in the history of Pimbal sales.

[20:39] This is the worst period in the history to be an operator of Pimbal machines.

[20:45] It is the worst period in the history of selling Pimbal machines to sell a game to operators.

[20:52] And so then from a marketing standpoint, it is the most idiotic thing to come out and

[20:58] announce this week that you just made a brand new Pimbal machine for operators.

[21:03] To announce that this week is beyond moronic.

[21:07] And one company just did that, American Pimbal.

[21:11] And I'm so perplexed as to why they did that.

[21:16] And we're going to talk about that right now.

[21:18] What is going on over at American Pimbal?

[21:21] Like what are they thinking?

[21:23] Some people out there think I have this agenda against American Pimbal.

[21:27] If you heard my analysis of this company, I've been saying it.

[21:30] I think they don't have any strategy or any marketing plans.

[21:34] And I think they're kind of leaderless in the decision making over there.

[21:39] And I want to just call a few things that they did recently that again.

[21:43] I just think indicate the fact that American Pimbal is really in a bad place.

[21:49] And I don't think they're intelligently being led.

[21:53] And I don't care if I'm not cheerleading this company.

[21:57] And I see it.

[21:58] It's like they put hot wheels up and you get two responses from the Pimside community.

[22:02] Looks colorful, looks fun to shoot.

[22:04] Oh, are you going to buy one?

[22:06] Nope.

[22:07] I'm not going to buy one.

[22:08] I'm doing a goofy voice.

[22:09] But it's like, are we going to give this company real feedback, intelligent feedback, adult

[22:15] feedback?

[22:16] Or are you just going to sit on the sideline and cheerlead them while you don't buy their

[22:21] products and this company continues to have sales flop after sales flop.

[22:25] Now hot wheels, much better theme than October Fest and then Houdini.

[22:29] But have you, let me ask you a question.

[22:30] Let me ask you one question first.

[22:31] Have you ever seen Stern Pimbal, the most successful Pimbal company out there?

[22:36] Have you ever seen Stern Pimbal release a game, any game and say we made this game for

[22:43] operators?

[22:44] Have you ever heard them say that?

[22:46] That they told you the exact target for the game.

[22:49] No.

[22:50] Why doesn't Stern Pimbal say that?

[22:52] Because the moment you come out and you said we made this game for operators, you are

[22:58] immediately telling the home buyers we didn't make this game for you.

[23:03] This game wasn't designed for the home environment.

[23:06] It was designed for location play and to accept quarters and we see that in all their

[23:11] press materials.

[23:12] They keep saying stuff like, let me read right now from the hot wheels flyer, only the

[23:17] wizards of American Pimbal could pull everything together for a pure powerhouse Pimbal that

[23:22] is a cut above in quality, workmanship, durability and long term earning strength.

[23:29] Replay boost ensures maximum revenues.

[23:32] This whole flyer is all designed for operators to get excited about hot wheels.

[23:38] Something I don't understand is at the end of this thing, the last bullet on their flyer

[23:42] says the following thing, players will be challenged to collect classic hot wheels,

[23:48] hero cars in order to become a hot wheels.

[23:52] Wait, isn't that plural?

[23:54] How do you become a hot wheels?

[23:56] Here's the thing for me.

[23:57] And again, I don't care if you think I'm being too negative on this company.

[24:01] I'm tired.

[24:02] I'm tired and tired.

[24:04] I'm tired of the Pimbal company that has had three shots now to make a game that will

[24:10] be successful, successful in the Pimbal marketplace.

[24:15] And the reason why Stern doesn't say this is for operators only, why not just make a

[24:19] great game?

[24:21] Why not just make a great game that appeals to everybody?

[24:24] If you want to be successful in Pimbal, then make a game that appeals to everybody.

[24:30] The problem I have with hot wheels is this.

[24:32] This to me is the pro version of hot wheels and you're only going to get the pro version

[24:37] of the game.

[24:38] Imagine if Stern made any of their hot licenses, but they only made one version and they only

[24:44] made the pro and they yanked out everything else from the premium and the L.E.s and all

[24:49] you could buy was the pro version of the game.

[24:52] That to me is what American Pimbal has just done with hot wheels.

[24:56] And I ask you, Pimbal lover, why did they do it that way?

[24:59] Why did they abandon their approach from Houdini and October fest in which they loaded the

[25:04] game with stuff that Pimbal people and Pimbal enthusiasts would love and be impressed by.

[25:10] They yanked all that stuff out, made a barren game in hot wheels.

[25:14] This game is barren.

[25:15] I don't get what people are seeing when they're saying it's loaded.

[25:19] And you know who just called it a loaded game?

[25:21] Josh Kugler.

[25:22] And I'm going to read his post on Pinside last night because to me, that whole thing

[25:27] is such an act to tell you what you should feel about this game.

[25:32] And I want to read you two different, I want to compare his thread to Scott Denise's

[25:37] thread because two people from two different companies started their own club threads on

[25:44] the games.

[25:45] Now, here's what's crazy to me is Josh Kugler started the American Pimbal club thread

[25:49] by himself.

[25:50] Right?

[25:51] He's the coder of the game.

[25:52] Why did he start a club thread for American Pimbal hot wheels?

[25:56] I'll tell you why because the other hot wheels thread has Canada's name in the title.

[26:01] And it says hot wheels.

[26:02] It is says Canada.

[26:03] He started a club thread, which isn't even categorized in the club thread area of

[26:09] Pinsides.

[26:10] So think about that for a moment.

[26:11] He just started American Pimbal thread that's called a club thread.

[26:16] Really weird, right?

[26:17] And a club thread, if you know what a club thread is supposed to be, is about all the people

[26:22] who are going to buy it and be in the club.

[26:25] That's not supposed to be just here's, here's a lengthy explanation of the game.

[26:30] That's not what a club thread is.

[26:31] So what I'm going to do, let's just do it right now.

[26:33] I'm going to read to you how Scott Denise opened up the Rick and Morty club thread.

[26:38] And then I'm going to read to you how Josh Kugler opened up the club thread.

[26:43] And I want you the listener to determine which company feels excited and knows they have

[26:47] a hit on their hand.

[26:48] And which company really knows that the excitement level is not there.

[26:53] And they need to convince you with a whole bunch of paragraphs why this game is the way

[26:58] it is.

[26:59] Okay?

[27:00] Because that's marketing.

[27:01] When you make a great game and you make a great product and you have hit a home run,

[27:07] you don't even need marketing.

[27:09] You don't even need to say a bunch of words.

[27:11] You don't even need to have a bunch of explanations.

[27:14] And I am, I really, I'm just so tired of American Pimbal always having to convince us that

[27:22] we should be as excited about their game as they are.

[27:25] Why don't they just make an exciting game that doesn't even need words?

[27:30] It's a freaking Pimbal machine.

[27:32] The game should speak for itself.

[27:35] You shouldn't need anything.

[27:37] Stern doesn't have to tell you paragraphs about why you why their games are great.

[27:41] They don't have to say like this is a great game.

[27:43] And I really want you to pay attention to that because this is American Pimbal's marketing

[27:47] strategy.

[27:48] Here's the game.

[27:49] Here it is, but it needs to come with all these caveats and explanations as to why you should

[27:54] be excited about it and who it's meant for and why there are dinosaurs in it and how

[27:59] it slowed it.

[28:00] I'm going to go through a word for word.

[28:02] I don't need to interview Josh on this show.

[28:04] I'm going to, he's, he's spoken.

[28:06] This is marketing.

[28:07] He has spoken to us, the consumer about why he thinks we should get excited about this

[28:13] game.

[28:14] All right.

[28:15] Let's do that right now.

[28:16] So we go on Pinside and we open up the Rick and Morty Club thread.

[28:18] It was created by Scott Denise, the games designer.

[28:22] So the official Rick and Morty Club was started.

[28:25] This is all Scott Denise, he writes 89 days ago, time to get riggedy riggedy wrecked

[28:30] son as someone very passionate about this project.

[28:34] I wanted to be the guy to start the official club thread.

[28:37] This will get locked until the games ship, but then it's on bitch Scott.

[28:43] And that's all he wrote.

[28:45] It's all he wrote to kick things off in the Rick and Morty Club and he has 104 upvotes.

[28:50] He knew that club threads are not supposed to open up until games start shipping and it's

[28:54] all supposed to be about owners coming in and saying how excited they are.

[28:59] All right.

[29:00] Now let's, let's go over to the American pinball thread and this is the, according to

[29:04] Mr. Cougar, this is the official Hot Wheels Club challenge accepted.

[29:10] I did this whole thing of like challenge accepted.

[29:13] Like no, the people challenge American pinball to make a great pinball machine.

[29:18] Yes, we did.

[29:19] Is this it?

[29:20] Okay.

[29:21] I'm going to read this.

[29:21] I'm going to read this.

[29:22] It's, it's, it's very verbose, but I think it's important to understand why I think

[29:26] American pinball is still asleep at the wheel.

[29:28] No pun intended.

[29:29] Before I read this, I just want to say one thing.

[29:31] If I were doble and I had all this Amtron money and I wanted to make a successful pinball

[29:37] company, you know what I would do?

[29:39] I would walk into a room and I would say, all right, we need the right team.

[29:44] Who are we going to get?

[29:45] Who are we going to get?

[29:47] Why not go off for John Borg or Eric over at JJP?

[29:51] Why not just go double their salaries and get them to join your team?

[29:55] Why not see what Lyman Sheets is making and double his salary and get him to come over

[29:59] and code games because American pinball makes machines.

[30:03] This isn't a company which you're going to sit around for years and no games are going

[30:06] to come out.

[30:07] Now, with three machines in a little over four years and that's really impressive or

[30:13] like three years, like they make a machine a year.

[30:15] They have the capabilities to do it.

[30:17] They just don't have the team in place that is making games people want to buy.

[30:22] So why not go get Lyman Sheets?

[30:24] Why not go get a John Borg?

[30:26] Why not go get an Eric over at JJP?

[30:29] Double their salary, see what they're making, offer them better royalties per game and

[30:34] then go get a license theme.

[30:35] I bet you it would have been cheaper to go do that stuff than the amount of money they

[30:40] lost on Houdini and on October Fest.

[30:43] It would have been cheaper.

[30:44] How much do you think these guys are making?

[30:45] It's not as much as you think but they're doing it the way they do it and I still think

[30:50] it's just completely a rudderless journey.

[30:53] Alright so Josh Kugler goes on to save.

[30:56] As many of you know, at last week's amusement expo international in New Orleans Hot Wheels

[31:00] Pinball machine made an appearance.

[31:03] We know this caught many of you by surprise as AP's past reveals were at pinball shows.

[31:08] As we are committed to growing pinball on location, this was an important audience to promote

[31:13] to that pinball is alive and well.

[31:15] Alright I want to stop right there.

[31:17] I want to stop right there because I think he said something that he also says many times

[31:20] throughout this whole club thread that their strategy is to grow pinball on location and

[31:26] that's what they see as their market for this game and they needed to be there to show

[31:32] people that pinball is alive and well and I just want to say that this is a huge gamble

[31:38] to think that American pinball job and their mission is to grow pinball on location.

[31:46] Last time I checked there are a lot of pinball locations out there in the world.

[31:52] There are a lot of barcades.

[31:55] There's a lot of pinball places, arcade places and there also are many more home buyers

[32:01] as well.

[32:02] And last time I checked location based pinball is thriving.

[32:06] Is hot wheels the game that's going to expand that market?

[32:11] Is hot wheels the game that's going to put pinball on the map and tell people it's alive

[32:15] and well.

[32:16] All these operators are buying Stern Pro's based on juggernaut themes and doing a.o.k.

[32:22] last time I checked.

[32:23] But I think it's weird to me that they went from this home buyer and they shift it now

[32:29] to this being the new mission of the company and I do I think it shows that when you don't

[32:33] have the right strategy in place you then just all of a sudden wake up and now you're

[32:38] about making games for operators not for the home buyer.

[32:41] So he then goes on to say how they had big launch plans for tpf and how they're disappointed

[32:46] that they couldn't make it there and I agree everyone is disappointed.

[32:50] Josh everyone wanted to play the game at tpf everyone wanted to get hands on experience

[32:56] with hot wheels.

[32:57] Now there's been a lot of questions about the hot wheels game and he has answered those

[33:02] questions.

[33:03] So I want to read what his answers are to the questions we've all been having.

[33:06] Now the first one is is what's with the offset monitor and he wrote despite some suggesting

[33:12] we did that since we had to fit it into the provided art.

[33:15] Canada suggested that by the way I can tell you that this is not even remotely close to

[33:20] the truth.

[33:22] It has been our goal to integrate the game display into the back glass when possible in

[33:27] this case as a jumbo tron or digital billboard.

[33:30] The team also felt we could do more with the back glass if we could create a larger canvas

[33:36] for our artists.

[33:37] We did testing of playing the game with the offset monitor and found that it takes very

[33:42] little time to adjust to the different position.

[33:45] After a game or two you don't think about it being offset and we do believe that the larger

[33:50] canvas allows the theme of the game to come through even when the machine is turned off.

[33:56] Alright, so he's saying we'd put it there because we can have more art and when you play

[34:00] you will adjust to it.

[34:01] I don't really care about it being off-centered.

[34:04] I think it will look a little strange next to every other pinball machine in the history

[34:09] of pinball having the monitor in the middle.

[34:12] But if you want to do it that way, I don't think that's a deal breaker for me.

[34:16] I don't.

[34:17] And so the next question was what's with the dinosaurs?

[34:21] And he said thankfully there are still toys in the world that encourage kids to use their

[34:26] imagination and over the years hot wheels has expanded its universe to include play

[34:31] sets that allow kids to explore different worlds with their hot wheels cars.

[34:36] By the way every time he says hot wheels in his right up there's a trademark attached

[34:41] to every single use of the word hot wheels.

[34:45] It's really weird.

[34:46] It's like this Q&A that he wrote for us on Pinside had to be approved by Mattel.

[34:52] Now normally, normally when you do something like this you use the trademark or the registered

[34:58] mark the first reference of the property.

[35:01] But when you write it like this it just feels like there's a corporate big brother standing

[35:06] over your shoulder talking about the game.

[35:09] Do you see when Rick and Morty, when Scott and Chuck and company, when they talk about

[35:15] Rick and Morty they're not putting the trademark Rick and Morty after every single usage of

[35:20] it.

[35:21] And again, it just goes to show the difference in how they're able to talk about these

[35:25] properties.

[35:26] All right.

[35:27] So then he says using your card to battle dinosaurs, gorillas, sharks and other creatures

[35:33] is the norm for many kids now playing with hot wheels.

[35:37] Given our goal it was to capture all the different aspects of hot wheels collecting track building,

[35:43] facing the stuff many of us grew up with, we also felt creature battles should be part

[35:48] of it.

[35:49] All right.

[35:50] They're basically making this game for the elements of hot wheels that young kids are experiencing

[35:53] now a day.

[35:54] I don't really think they had a choice.

[35:55] I think if you got the hot wheels license right now, Mattel is going to make you base it

[36:00] on the current version of hot wheels.

[36:03] Does this excite people?

[36:04] Look, I'll just say this.

[36:05] You're battling dinosaurs, you're battling gorillas and sharks.

[36:09] And when I look at the game, there is absolutely nothing physical in the game that is a physical

[36:17] gorilla, shark or dinosaur.

[36:19] I mean, I, I, it'd be nice to have some of that stuff.

[36:22] If that's what you're really trying to do.

[36:24] And if you look at the way kids are battling those things with the hot wheels play sets,

[36:30] it's very physical.

[36:31] It's so weird to me that you can go buy a physical hot wheels toy for very little money.

[36:36] And yet spend $6,300 on a pinball machine, so much more money.

[36:43] And there's so much less physical world coming to life from, from hot wheels, right?

[36:49] I mean, come on.

[36:50] And then what's with the spinning car?

[36:52] Oh, man, that spinning car is, is going to leave everyone dizzy who stands in front of

[36:58] this game.

[36:59] And he writes, without context, it's easy to see how the spinning car seems a bit out of

[37:04] place.

[37:05] How context, Josh, what, what, let me ask you something, Josh, I'm just talking to you

[37:11] as you listen to this.

[37:12] I know you're, what are their pinball machine?

[37:14] Have you seen recently where a mechanism and how it's operating makes no sense without

[37:22] context?

[37:23] What context do people need when they look at the Elvira house?

[37:28] What context do you need when you look at the Jurassic Park T-Rex?

[37:32] I don't get it.

[37:34] Now there's a car floating around in space, going around and around and around.

[37:41] It's not, it's not driving around a track.

[37:43] So I think when you make a mechanism, it shouldn't require additional context to understand

[37:49] something as simple as a car going around and around.

[37:52] There's not even like a track underneath it.

[37:53] It's not moving over the road.

[37:54] It's just flying in mid air.

[37:56] All right.

[37:57] He said the car does respond to what is happening in the game.

[38:00] And while I won't go into a lot of detail on that in this first post, I will say that

[38:05] we are still adjusting how it is used in gameplay regardless.

[38:10] There are settings to control how much it is used.

[38:13] A little, a lot, or none at all.

[38:16] So wait, let me get this straight.

[38:18] You can just turn it off.

[38:20] You don't even need it?

[38:22] Let's be honest, this thing is spinning there as just a visual cue to excite people to

[38:28] walk up to the game.

[38:29] Why is it in the game if you could turn it off?

[38:32] That makes absolutely no sense to me.

[38:34] What other major mechanism in a pinball machine do you know that you can just turn off?

[38:41] Like can you, I just, I don't get it.

[38:44] I'm trying people.

[38:46] Am I being too tough on these guys?

[38:48] It's the most movement in the entire game.

[38:51] Out of everything that's in this game, that thing is the most movement of any of the mechanisms

[38:55] and you can shut it off.

[38:58] It just, I don't know.

[39:00] I don't know.

[39:01] What do you think?

[39:02] Can you hit a pinball at gmail.com?

[39:03] It goes on to say, so for those of you who really don't like it, you can just turn it off.

[39:08] Right, great.

[39:09] Josh, thank you.

[39:10] If you don't like the game, we can just also turn it off.

[39:13] For those of you who don't like it, you can just not buy the game.

[39:15] For those of you who don't like it, why would you make something and put it into a pinball

[39:20] machine?

[39:21] That's annoying.

[39:22] What?

[39:23] Josh, is there any other, again, name me one game out there where there's just like

[39:28] a mechanism that you just turn off?

[39:30] All right.

[39:31] Like, by choice, pinball machine should be things that you want to turn on, that you see

[39:37] happening, that you see, like, what is this?

[39:40] Am I the only one?

[39:41] Am I just a jerk?

[39:42] Am I a jerk?

[39:43] And when I look at this game and say, how can you make this thing, put it in a game, make

[39:46] it to the point where it's so annoying you want people to turn it off?

[39:50] Canadian pinball podcast, number one pinball podcast in the world.

[39:52] We're going to keep going on this spinning car.

[39:54] He says, I will say that when you actually play the machine, it is not a pinball machine.

[39:57] It's not as distracting as it might look watching a cell phone camera video of gameplay.

[40:03] And it can be quite helpful in knowing when the tech value is dropping.

[40:08] You will soon learn why this is important.

[40:10] Well, it's obvious that the car is spinning is like the RPMs.

[40:13] And so I'm assuming you have to get your RPMs high enough to maybe make a jump or a loop

[40:18] deloop.

[40:19] And that's why it's there.

[40:20] The weirdest thing for me is this, if what this car is supposed to represent is the

[40:25] RPM and the speed of the car, why didn't they just have an RPM tech, like a real car RPM

[40:31] tech, like going up and raising an RPM, like a needle that's going up an RPM band?

[40:37] Well, why have this thing keep spinning and spinning and spinning or why not have like

[40:41] a mech that's like a pistons in a car going up and down and that piston goes up and down

[40:45] and keep spinning harder and harder and harder?

[40:47] You know why people because this mech looks like it costs like 20 bucks at most.

[40:52] All right.

[40:53] So what's the price?

[40:54] And he says each of our games has been priced based on what is in the game.

[40:59] Hot Wheels has a lower price than either of our first two games with an MSRP of $62.95.

[41:06] The price reflects that the game has a little less in it feature wise.

[41:11] A little less than Houdini in October Fest?

[41:13] Just a little less Josh.

[41:14] Are you sure about that?

[41:17] How much is a little less?

[41:19] Any magnets in this game?

[41:20] You know, are we firing the ball three feet in this game?

[41:24] A little less, a little less.

[41:25] OK.

[41:26] Also as I indicated above, we want to grow location play and operators need a game at a

[41:32] price that works for them.

[41:34] So it was our goal on this machine to make it a little lower price to better serve operators

[41:40] and get more pinball on location.

[41:43] This is the point people are just want to throw my mic and my computer out the window.

[41:47] This is the point where this is it.

[41:49] This is it right there.

[41:51] That is their marketing strategy.

[41:53] That is their target audience.

[41:55] This game is made for operators.

[41:56] Now I'm just here to tell you, I know I know I'm slamming this game because I'm looking

[42:00] at it through the lens of a home buyer.

[42:03] I'm looking at it through the lens of a collector.

[42:05] This game is not meant for me.

[42:07] This game is meant for operators and operators only.

[42:10] And so yes, am I being a little unfair in looking at it through my lens and the lens of people

[42:15] who listen to this show?

[42:17] And I know operators listen to this show, but is John a jack bar going to go by Hot Wheels?

[42:21] Are you who is an operator?

[42:23] Are you going to put this on your location?

[42:25] Maybe if you've got like a movie theater, maybe if you've got a bowling alley full of kids,

[42:30] but are you going to put Hot Wheels on location?

[42:32] If the majority of your players who come into your location play are pinheads, are pinball

[42:38] fanatics.

[42:39] Those guys don't want just a simple baron game.

[42:42] They want something that's packed.

[42:44] They want the best pinball has to offer.

[42:47] And this whole notion of like operators are what's going to grow the hobby is such

[42:52] hog watch.

[42:53] I just think it's wrong.

[42:54] All right, he goes, given what is going on right now, I love this line.

[42:57] There is little doubt that collectors won't mind paying a little less for a great new

[43:03] game.

[43:04] All right, right there.

[43:05] I could just stop reading right now.

[43:07] Collectors won't mind spending less money on this great new game.

[43:11] What did I say?

[43:12] Don't tell me your game is great.

[43:15] People will tell you it's great, Josh.

[43:17] And to act as if or all of a sudden now this game is for collectors who want a cheaper

[43:21] game.

[43:23] Which one is it?

[43:24] Who is this game for?

[43:26] And yeah, everyone wants a cheaper game, but they don't want a cheaper game at the expense

[43:31] of having everything yanked out.

[43:33] I'm sorry.

[43:34] It's just unbelievable to me.

[43:36] And then he writes, even with this lower price, the game is still loaded people.

[43:40] He says it's still loaded.

[43:42] He has multiple ramps, drop targets, drops targets.

[43:47] They didn't even grammar.

[43:48] He has drops with a vuck with loop ramp, a front facing kicker, staggered stand-up targets.

[43:55] Wow, targets are now loaded.

[43:57] Real direct printed backlash and tons more.

[44:01] He said tons more.

[44:03] Wait, wait, no, there's nothing more.

[44:06] Tons more.

[44:08] There's not the, you just described everything that's in this game, Josh.

[44:12] And why are you saying tons more?

[44:15] What's the tons more?

[44:17] That's all I want to know.

[44:19] Why, why, tons more?

[44:24] I hate having a pinball podcast right now.

[44:27] I hate having to read this and being like, what are you talking about?

[44:31] How is this game loaded?

[44:33] How is this game loaded people?

[44:35] He said the game is 100% RGB LEDs for inserts and general illumination using over a

[44:42] 140 LEDs, including multiple LEDs and arrow-earned inserts to allow better illumination and

[44:49] lighting effects.

[44:51] Cabinet insight art is included.

[44:52] The first of its kind, 3D lenticular back panel is included.

[44:58] Art on the front of the apron included.

[45:01] Powder coated rails included.

[45:03] And as mentioned above, for a limited time, the shaker motor included for the first 500,

[45:08] right?

[45:09] People are designed to give you a lot of different objectives to pursue, which will keep this game

[45:14] challenging and entertaining for a long time.

[45:17] And then the final question was, what's with the animation?

[45:21] Mattel created a YouTube series Hot Wheels City and he talks about how they grabbed from

[45:24] that.

[45:25] Alright, and there's pictures of the game.

[45:28] And then someone asked down here, how come there's no loop deloop?

[45:32] And there's no answer.

[45:33] And then video jack wrote in this explanation of how they might not have been able to achieve

[45:39] optimum height on the ramp or speed to make a loop deloop happen under the glass in a

[45:44] pinball machine.

[45:45] I don't want to talk about Hot Wheels anymore.

[45:48] I think that this company is going backwards.

[45:52] And this isn't the game that you all want it.

[45:54] And I think all of you out there that are saying, it's better than I thought it would be.

[45:59] How do you look at what was in Houdini and in Oct.

[46:04] There's two games that were packed that suffered by bad theme integration and bad artwork.

[46:10] How do you look at Hot Wheels and now say it's better than you thought it would be?

[46:15] I don't understand that.

[46:17] So you thought, what did you think it was going to be?

[46:20] Because there's barely anything in the game.

[46:23] There barely any animations.

[46:25] They're just pulling right from the Mattel show.

[46:29] How I don't understand any of that feedback.

[46:33] What I think is going on is what normally goes on in this hobby.

[46:37] And that is people don't want to say how they really feel.

[46:40] The burden of that falls on Canadian pinball podcast.

[46:44] And I'm going to tell you exactly how I feel about this game.

[46:47] I think it's fine for operators.

[46:49] I think it's fine if American pinball wants to take this approach of making simpler games

[46:55] that operators will put on location.

[46:57] But I think they fundamentally have no idea how to make this work for them strategically.

[47:04] I think they're overestimating the amount of operators that are going to put Hot Wheels

[47:08] on location.

[47:10] And I think their strategy makes no sense because by launching this as an operator-focused

[47:16] game, they're going to turn off way more home buyers to the game itself.

[47:21] Because even though pinheads who buy for their home have children and have families,

[47:26] the pinhead still wants to get like the premium and the LLE, the pinhead will oftentimes

[47:32] want to have all the bells and whistles in the game and also a theme their kid can enjoy.

[47:38] And when Ninja Turtles gets shown and the Ninja Turtles Pro will be the same price if

[47:43] not cheaper than this, look at Stranger Things Pro.

[47:46] I mean there's a lot in that game compared to Hot Wheels.

[47:49] There's still more in it than there is in Hot Wheels.

[47:52] How do you compare the two?

[47:53] I just think going the battle against the Stern Pro formula is a losing battle.

[47:59] It's not where you're going to win.

[48:01] You're not going to win with operators and location play with a pro model of a machine.

[48:08] I don't care what anyone says.

[48:10] You're just not going to win there.

[48:11] Stern's got that lockdown so tight.

[48:13] Now that's who they're competing with.

[48:15] Hot Wheels is directly competing with the Stern Pro marketplace.

[48:20] And are you here to tell me that you think this can compete with what Stern offers within

[48:25] licensing themes and within gameplay features and within price point?

[48:31] That's where they're at.

[48:32] And within the ability to get the games to people.

[48:34] The last thing I'll close with is this.

[48:36] They launched a game for operators in the worst possible time in the history of launching

[48:40] a game for operators.

[48:42] Why they do that?

[48:43] Were they contractually obligated?

[48:44] I don't know.

[48:46] Am I being unfair?

[48:47] Is Canada trying to hurt American Pimball?

[48:51] No.

[48:52] I'm just calling it like it is.

[48:53] This company needs to hit pause and hit reset on what their strategy is.

[48:58] I'm sorry.

[48:59] Mukesh, if you want to call yourself wizards and you want to say only a company like American

[49:04] Pimball can do this, these guys, it saddens me because they have such a great ability to

[49:09] manufacture.

[49:11] I think they've made some great changes in the manufacturing process that are great.

[49:15] But then they're making these decisions and they're just bonehead moves.

[49:19] And until the boneheads stop making the decisions over there, this is going to be a company that

[49:24] continues to get nowhere near that thousand game milestone they need to get to.

[49:31] And last point is this, who designed this game?

[49:34] Is this a Joe Balls or game?

[49:36] Where's Joe and all of this?

[49:37] Why isn't Joe talking about this game?

[49:40] Why isn't he excited about this game?

[49:42] Why isn't he streaming this game?

[49:43] Where is he?

[49:44] I don't think he wants to be near it.

[49:47] That's my hunch.

[49:48] I think this is his game and I don't think he's that proud of it.

[49:53] And do you think I'm wrong?

[49:54] Am I being a jerk?

[49:56] Well you already voted for the Twippy so it's too late.

[49:58] We're going to march in there and hopefully get the third one soon.

[50:02] I'm sorry if you thought this podcast was overly negative, but I just for the life of

[50:09] me really, really, really don't understand why it's so hard to put the pieces together

[50:17] to simply make a pinball company and pinball machines that are successful.

[50:23] You have a captive audience.

[50:25] You have people that are dying to give you their money.

[50:28] You have all of this energy and enthusiasm in this hobby and in this community and you

[50:33] have a company like Stern Pinball that is showing everybody the exact playbook in how

[50:40] to be successful in pinball and it's not very hard.

[50:45] And the reason why I get frustrated and I call people boneheads and making moronic moves

[50:52] is why is it so hard to simply follow the playbook to success and see what works for

[50:59] others, emulate what's working, make a little bit of the adjustments to give your company

[51:05] a little bit of a differentiator.

[51:07] But now these companies have spent years and have failed to make a great game.

[51:13] A game that is great needs to also have sales success.

[51:17] So don't be the guy who says I love my October fest, why they barely sold any.

[51:23] And if you think I don't know what I'm talking about, if you think I'm just a moron who's

[51:27] got a marketing degree and doesn't know how to sell pinball machines, I guarantee you,

[51:32] I guarantee you, if American pinball called me up and asked me to actually help them on

[51:38] their next game, we wouldn't end up here.

[51:41] But you've got to make the right marketing moves, you've got to make the right personnel

[51:45] moves and you've got to make the right decisions.

[51:49] And this is not how you do it.

[51:51] It's not how you do it.

[51:53] And you'd have to look no further than the big boys are delaying right now.

[51:57] They're not sharing what you think Jack's going to show you guns and roses anytime soon.

[52:01] You think Stern's going to show Ninja Turtles next week?

[52:03] No, it's now a time to hit pause and rethink your strategy and launch when the timing is

[52:10] right.

[52:11] This game, it's just going to come out and it's going to achieve no sales, no lift, no

[52:16] hype, no enthusiasm.

[52:19] And if you think I'm a jerk who's not giving this game a chance because I haven't seen

[52:22] it flipped, I've seen it flipped, but just wait.

[52:25] I'm willing to bet.

[52:27] Look, I won't do a show for two weeks.

[52:29] If the hot wheel stream comes out and everyone thinks it's awesome, I'll just go away for

[52:32] two weeks and you can listen to every other podcast talk about how great it is.

[52:36] I'm pretty confident that once you see it streamed, you're going to be like, canada was right.

[52:40] Like why are we like cheerleading this stuff?

[52:43] Anyway, everyone have a good day.

[52:45] Take care of your health.

[52:46] Be safe.

[52:47] I know a lot of you are working from home.

[52:49] This has been Episode 490,875 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[52:53] We'll talk to you soon.

[52:55] I apologize.

[53:03] I'm sorry.

[53:11] I'm sorry we had to defend ourselves against an unwarranted attack.

[53:17] I'm sorry that your crew was stupid enough to fly on a station filled with a quarter

[53:21] million civilians, including your own people.

[53:26] And I'm sorry I waited as long as I did before I blew them all straight to hell.
