[00:00] Hey! A man you're talking back to me, take him off!

[00:04] You gotta keep him separated!

[00:05] Hey! A man you're disrespecting me, take him off!

[00:10] You gotta keep him separated!

[00:11] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up!

[00:15] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:18] We gotta keep him separated.

[00:20] I'm gonna have to separate my feelings about how Barrels of Fun launched this new Dune game,

[00:26] the worst kept secret in all the pinball, from the game itself,

[00:30] because I'm gonna talk about both of them.

[00:32] Now I'm gonna start out by saying this.

[00:35] I don't understand why David Vaness and the team over there that has been in communication

[00:43] with various members of the pinball media, how they ended up with such a fumbled launch.

[00:50] The thing I'm hearing happened is that some distro leaked the YouTube trailer,

[00:56] they weren't supposed to do it, and that just opened the floodgates, but here's what never happened.

[01:02] I never got any assets.

[01:04] Brian Savage said, if you're not coming down, we're gonna send you high-res assets.

[01:09] That never happened.

[01:10] So they had all this time to plan it out.

[01:13] They had all these weeks to get people excited about this game,

[01:17] and it just stumbles out the gate.

[01:19] And I just want to say, it's bad.

[01:22] It's bad marketing.

[01:23] It's a bad way to communicate the game.

[01:25] And I don't understand why they didn't utilize more positive content leading up to the launch of this game.

[01:34] All they were talking about was the Shaker Motor, the non-reflective glass.

[01:40] They were talking about the lighting system.

[01:42] All the stuff they were focusing on was not Dune.

[01:46] And the modern version of Dune and getting you excited about this game,

[01:51] getting you to watch the movies again, getting you to connect with the property.

[01:56] That's what I would have done.

[01:58] We know the Elton John effect.

[02:01] Elton John is one of the best shooting pinball machines of all time.

[02:04] But people didn't want Elton John, and instead of giving people a runway so they could get over that fact,

[02:14] and then control the narrative around the game, you launch it like this.

[02:19] Now, that being said, so I'm over it.

[02:22] I'm over it.

[02:23] I don't know why David did it.

[02:24] I don't know why Blake and Brian Savage did it this way.

[02:27] Maybe it wasn't their intention, but whatever they had planned, this was not it.

[02:33] They just could have done it much better than they did.

[02:36] Alright, so I'm over it.

[02:37] My little hissy fit.

[02:38] I went on YouTube last night.

[02:40] I was extremely tired.

[02:41] I'm over it.

[02:42] Let's talk about the game.

[02:44] The game is now real.

[02:46] The game is out.

[02:48] The game is going to go on the line within the next four weeks.

[02:51] I have a laundry list of features.

[02:54] I've got a humongous email that they sent to the distributors, how it's all going to work.

[03:00] I'm hearing a lot of message about how this is a universe under glass, not a world under glass,

[03:06] a universe under glass.

[03:08] Look, I think these guys are very proud of this game.

[03:12] And as I look at the game, I think there's a lot here to be proud of.

[03:16] I do.

[03:17] While it's not the theme I would have selected, it's not.

[03:20] I don't think the modern pinball buying demographic clicked with these movies.

[03:27] There's not like an emotional connection to these modern dune films.

[03:32] It's not the kind of movie you're going to go back and watch time and time again.

[03:37] It's not the kind of movie where you're going to get a tattoo of it.

[03:41] It's not the kind of movie where you're reciting lines from the film.

[03:45] I bet if I asked most of you, name me three characters from this movie, you wouldn't really

[03:52] be able to do it.

[03:53] Now that being said, on a theme level, it's not a very strong theme for modern pinball.

[04:00] It's not.

[04:01] And it's very brown, right?

[04:03] It's like this company is stuck in a beige brown world.

[04:07] It's going to go really nice next to your labyrinth.

[04:11] But boy, oh boy, it is again another brown game from barrels of fun.

[04:16] So just aesthetically, you know, the colorful fun of an evil dead or we know King Kong's

[04:23] going to be colorful and fun.

[04:25] This game, a lot darker.

[04:27] I think Harry Potter is going to be very dark too.

[04:29] But it does fit the theme.

[04:31] I'm looking at the Naps arcade images right now.

[04:35] And let's go over this game.

[04:36] All right, let's talk about the cabinet first.

[04:39] What do we think about the cabinet artwork?

[04:41] We've got the character Timothy Chamolet.

[04:43] I don't even know his character name.

[04:45] I really don't.

[04:46] I don't know who the main character in Dune is.

[04:49] He's holding up his knife.

[04:51] I think he's like leading the army with this rebellious sort of fist pump with the knife

[04:56] in hand.

[04:57] That's on the right side of the cabinet.

[04:59] The Translight has all the characters from the movie.

[05:03] They got everybody from the films.

[05:04] I mean, everybody's in this.

[05:05] So I fully expect there to be movie clips without muted clips, which is going to be good.

[05:12] Because if you saw the Jersey Jack note the other day, it seems like there's going to

[05:16] be muted clips in Harry Potter.

[05:19] And you know how I feel about that.

[05:21] It's kind of a deal breaker.

[05:22] But everybody is in this.

[05:24] And here's what's sad.

[05:25] I'm on Naps arcade right now.

[05:26] And there is nothing but a low res flyer of the game.

[05:31] Low res.

[05:32] I can't read any of the text.

[05:34] I can see it.

[05:36] And this is their first official assets of the game.

[05:40] Low res cannot read what is going on here on the left side of the cabinet.

[05:47] It's much darker.

[05:48] Reminds me a lot of Lord of the Rings where one side is sort of orange and red.

[05:53] And the other side is sort of black and blue.

[05:56] And I'm zooming in here and it looks like there's a few characters fighting is what

[06:01] it looks like.

[06:02] OK, but that's not what everybody's talking about.

[06:04] And then you got a topper on this game.

[06:06] That's just a placeholder plastic topper because they're going to at a later date offer an

[06:12] accessory package, which is also going to have a new topper.

[06:16] So so much talk for getting everything on day one from barrels of fun.

[06:19] They've been doing a lot of communication around how they're giving you the best bang

[06:23] for the buck in pinball.

[06:24] But the price has gone up.

[06:25] I believe the price of this game is eleven thousand six hundred.

[06:30] And that's not with the more expensive topper.

[06:34] It's not with the sculpted slings.

[06:36] If you look at the slingshots, just flat plastic and it's not with the shooter knob.

[06:41] So if you add all of those things up, you're getting much closer to a 13 to $14,000 game.

[06:50] I don't know how much the toppers going to be a little disappointed.

[06:53] It's not all available on day one.

[06:56] So people don't know how much in total they're going to need to spend if they want to buy

[07:01] this game with all of the accessories.

[07:03] I don't like that from a communication standpoint.

[07:06] I would like to know on day one, how much is everything all in?

[07:11] We know there's going to be a thousand units and it sounds like games are going to start

[07:15] to be made over the next month.

[07:17] They are anticipating to make all 1000 of these games by the end of the year.

[07:22] Now that's a lot.

[07:23] That's a lot because it's already mid April.

[07:27] So all these companies promising we're going to have all the units made by the end of the year.

[07:32] I hope they get there.

[07:33] Now looking at the game to, you know, the coin door is weird, that one coin slot.

[07:38] And then they've got just the generic shooter knob.

[07:42] The armor is just basic armor.

[07:44] I just feel like there's certain details where I would have liked to have seen a little bit more.

[07:49] For example, the speaker area, I guess it looks like a worm, right?

[07:53] The speaker grill itself, which is kind of nice, but it's just a lot of dark brown.

[07:59] The legs, the armor, the speaker grill area.

[08:03] So I have to stand over the machine.

[08:05] But look, if you like Dune, I think this game really does a great job bringing the theme to life.

[08:12] Now looking at the play field, the universe under glass, what do I think about this game?

[08:19] Well, first and foremost, I've heard a lot of people say, this is just like Avatar.

[08:23] It's a theme nobody really wants, and it's going to go down just like Avatar and I 100% disagree.

[08:31] And here's why.

[08:32] This game looks like it's got 10 times more fun stuff to shoot at than Avatar does.

[08:37] This game definitely looks like it's got a universe under glass.

[08:42] It definitely looks like all these wire forms going all over the place.

[08:46] I mean, you kind of get that sense of like the worms slithering through the desert.

[08:51] I'm getting that vibe.

[08:52] I love the scopes in this game.

[08:55] I mean, people are saying it reminds them a little bit of whitewater.

[08:58] And the only reason that is is because of all the scopes.

[09:01] It really looks like a three dimensional world under glass.

[09:04] And that's what you want to see.

[09:06] So kudos to the team over there for not going flat plastic.

[09:11] I bet you were going to see a lot more flat plastic today.

[09:16] When we see King Kong.

[09:17] I don't know if Harry Potter is going to have this level of scopes, but out of all the companies in pinball right now,

[09:24] I really do want to give barrels of fun, a lot of credit for these scopes because this is what should be under glass for this much money.

[09:33] And you know, look, last night I was like, oh, the art.

[09:36] Yeah, the art is very barren like a desert.

[09:39] It really is like there's not a lot of art.

[09:41] There's not a lot of detail.

[09:43] And when I look at it now, you sort of have just a few characters in the middle.

[09:47] The inserts are interestingly located in this game.

[09:52] What you can see in this game is sort of how the inserts are going to light up.

[09:57] And I feel like they're going to escalate as you're getting through the different modes in the game.

[10:02] I like that there's not too many inserts.

[10:04] And why I want to fear when I'm looking at this game right now, and then this is probably why they have the new lighting system.

[10:09] If you look at the middle of the game, there's really not.

[10:13] Many inserts, which means there's not going to be a lot of light.

[10:17] So I think this game is going to utilize the new lighting system on the rails to create much more of an atmosphere.

[10:24] Because I don't think you're going to get like a ton of inserts lighting up on the play field itself.

[10:30] And it kind of makes sense, right?

[10:32] You're in a desert and that's where this franchise takes place.

[10:36] You wouldn't expect there to be too much light.

[10:39] You kind of want that desert vibe to come through more.

[10:43] And I'm really happy to say it does.

[10:45] I mean, what's going to be stunning in this game, I can kind of tell right now.

[10:49] My favorite area of this game is that back one third of the play field.

[10:55] I love all the sculpts.

[10:57] And then it goes into that LCD screen that's in the back box area, right?

[11:02] The back of the game, the ability for them to sort of have a desert sequence.

[11:08] It's almost like the physical play field is blending into the film.

[11:13] And I think it's going to be really, really cool.

[11:16] I really do got three flippers in this game.

[11:19] It looks like you've got a physical ball kick out in the left out lane.

[11:25] Really interesting area there.

[11:27] It looks like it kicks it out up the wire form and then feeds it back to the left flipper.

[11:32] So that's going to be really cool.

[11:36] There's some drop targets.

[11:37] There's a third flipper.

[11:38] And then there's obviously the main mech, that big sandworm that comes up with the

[11:43] magnet and apparently it's going to eat the ball.

[11:46] I'm not sure what happens, right?

[11:48] They haven't shown us the whole sequence.

[11:49] We're going to get more of that.

[11:51] And then there's another mech in the upper left corner.

[11:54] I'm not sure what that thing is from the movies.

[11:57] I should know the movies better.

[11:58] And what's also interesting is you've got that sculpt in the upper right with those two holes.

[12:04] And I don't think the balls come out of there,

[12:06] but really atmospheric and well done on the overall look of this game.

[12:12] It comes with the inner art decals.

[12:14] Let's read the game features.

[12:16] Three flippers, six balls, horizon atmospheric lighting.

[12:20] So I think that's going to be really cool.

[12:22] I think this game is going to have more of an atmospheric effect than even Avatar does,

[12:27] which never really worked right in all new RGB LED low profile

[12:32] inner cabinet lighting system for a rack is day night lighting effects.

[12:37] Can't wait to see that.

[12:38] All RGBW LED playfield insert lamps, general illumination lamps and playfield apron

[12:44] floodlights, evergloss, high gloss,

[12:47] decal art with metallic embedded details.

[12:50] So that's the cabinet artwork.

[12:52] It's kind of like their version of a Radcals infinity glass,

[12:55] thunder from down under.

[12:56] It's got the two LCD screens.

[12:59] Now, I'm hearing that we're going to see the full reveal of this game today.

[13:03] So a lot's going to happen today.

[13:05] We're going to see more of Dune.

[13:06] We're going to see King Kong.

[13:08] We're going to get a lot, right?

[13:10] Harry Potter, seemingly a few weeks away.

[13:12] So here's my overall take on this Dune game.

[13:15] If they sold a thousand labyrinth machines, they're going to sell these games.

[13:21] And this is a thing about boutiques.

[13:23] You only need to sell a thousand.

[13:25] And did you give enough to sell a thousand units?

[13:28] Now, the one thing is it's not cheap.

[13:31] And I think people are going to want to fully accessorize this thing.

[13:35] And I think fully accessorized out the door.

[13:39] You're looking at 13, $14,000.

[13:42] And then the question becomes, do you wait it out?

[13:46] Because as we saw with labyrinth towards the end of the run, the demand dries up.

[13:52] You know, it's interesting about David Van Es's strategy here.

[13:55] He sent a note to the distros.

[13:58] They're really trying to get distros to order more labyrinth machines to bump them up

[14:06] in terms of when you'll get your Dune machines.

[14:09] I don't know how much demand there really was for labyrinth.

[14:12] I don't think there was even a thousand.

[14:14] But this game looks so much better than labyrinth.

[14:17] I got to be honest, it looks so much cooler than labyrinth.

[14:21] There's a lot more going on in this game than there is in labyrinth.

[14:25] And look, I think the response to this game is going to be interesting

[14:28] because it's definitely a game that has a lot in it.

[14:32] And I think it's going to be interesting to see what we get from King Kong today.

[14:37] Because if Kong has no assets and is an all original Kong adventure

[14:43] and it doesn't have a lot in it, people might start to look at this Dune machine

[14:48] with a lot more favorability.

[14:50] Now, I also think most people are going to wait to see everything

[14:54] before they pull the trigger.

[14:56] The only game you're really going to have to probably pull the trigger on today

[15:01] is a King Kong LE.

[15:02] Just because historically, Elwyn LEs have done really well.

[15:08] And once they sell out, it's hard to find one.

[15:11] We know all the King Kong LEs have already sold through.

[15:15] But, you know, will distros still have them come the end of the week?

[15:20] It's only Tuesday, right? It's only Tuesday.

[15:23] I can't wait to see Kerry Hardy's review after he gets to jump on this machine.

[15:27] Poor Kerry, man. He flew down there and they seemingly screwed him

[15:31] on all the exclusive stuff he was going to be able to do.

[15:34] But he will be the first one to have hands on time with this game.

[15:39] Colin is down there. I think Kale might be down there as well.

[15:44] I was not going to make the trip.

[15:45] I was not going to make the trip because when this game actually does ship,

[15:49] it's going to go to automate it and I'll have a chance to play it.

[15:52] Same with King Kong.

[15:53] So lots happening this week, people. Lots happening this week.

[15:57] But I just want to end by saying this is a really, really good theme integrated game.

[16:03] Whether or not the theme speaks to you, yeah, it's not where I would have gone.

[16:08] I don't think market research takes you here.

[16:11] I think there are other sci-fi sort of nostalgic things

[16:15] that would have sold better stuff like space balls.

[16:19] Heck, even last starfighter might speak to more of you.

[16:23] So I just think the new Dune and a lot of people that love Dune

[16:26] also have fondness for the David Lynch Dune.

[16:29] It's just like the new one, right?

[16:31] It's like none of us are into Timothy Chamolet and Zendaya.

[16:35] Like these are like Gen Z actors, right?

[16:38] These aren't the actors and these aren't the movies

[16:42] that have forged an indelible bond with you.

[16:45] But I am impressed that David Van Essen team got a modern blockbuster theme.

[16:51] Only one issue, too, is isn't there a third movie coming out?

[16:54] And so now they've made this game based on the first two films

[16:58] and a third installment might come out.

[17:01] You know, a better theme would have been to make the new Tron movie coming out,

[17:05] which is happening this fall.

[17:07] And in the end, it all comes down to one simple thing.

[17:10] When these games were six to seven thousand dollars,

[17:13] it was a lot easier to just pull the trigger,

[17:16] support these boutique companies and pull the trigger.

[17:18] But at thirteen, fourteen thousand all in,

[17:22] it's hard to know whether or not you should pull the trigger

[17:25] because what you don't want to do is give that two thousand dollars.

[17:29] They raised it.

[17:30] It's a two thousand dollar nonrefundable deposit.

[17:34] What you don't want to do is lock yourself in on this game.

[17:39] And if you want all the accessories, that's a two thousand dollar deposit.

[17:43] On a game that might be thirteen or more thousand dollars,

[17:47] which then might lose three thousand dollars in one year,

[17:50] because back to the futures coming out, Harry Potter is coming out,

[17:54] Stern's not done right in four months.

[17:56] Another Stern machine will be coming out by John Borg and it might be Pokemon.

[18:00] That's the problem I see in all modern pinball

[18:03] is you really can only go in on these games when you want to keep them.

[18:07] And then the problem becomes if you really want to keep them,

[18:10] you might as well wait and let the new and box buyer take the big hit

[18:15] and then swoop in and get it for three thousand dollars less.

[18:19] It's just a problem with the whole industry now is like nothing makes you

[18:23] really want to pull the trigger right away.

[18:25] Because again, six, seven thousand dollars, these things are sold out in day one.

[18:30] Thirteen thousand dollars fully accessorized.

[18:33] I don't know, especially with King Kong dropping on the same exact day.

[18:37] I mean, talk about the worst timing ever.

[18:39] It is the worst timing ever.

[18:40] I wish this game would have like stole the show at T.P.F.

[18:44] It really would have like this looks way, way cooler than portal.

[18:50] All right.

[18:50] So we shall see.

[18:51] I'm obviously going to do more shows today.

[18:52] And also I'm going to go live when King Kong drops today.

[18:56] So join me on YouTube and let's watch Kong together.

[19:01] But these are my first impressions of barrels of funds new game, Dune.

[19:06] I think it was a marketing disaster.

[19:09] David and team have a lot of maturing to do when it comes to how to market a

[19:14] game and bring it to market and utilize all the content creators that are out

[19:19] there to their benefit.

[19:21] I don't think they did it properly.

[19:23] And it's really a shame because I had a lot of personal conversations with them

[19:27] and they did nothing.

[19:28] They said they were going to do.

[19:30] So that's unfortunate, but that does not take away from the effort I see in

[19:36] this game.

[19:36] It does look to be a real universe under glass and it looks really neat.

[19:41] And I think when we see this whole thing lit up with the atmospheric effect,

[19:46] I think it's going to be the opposite of Avatar.

[19:48] I think this game is going to bring that sand world to life.

[19:52] And then some where Avatar missed the mark completely on bringing the world

[19:57] of Pandora to life.

[19:58] Everybody, thank you for being a subscriber.

[20:01] More shows coming today.

[20:02] Crazy day.

[20:03] There's a reason I took off.

[20:05] I go back to work tomorrow because I knew I knew I needed to recover from the jet

[20:08] lag and I knew this was going to be a crazy day in pinball.

[20:12] Canade out.
