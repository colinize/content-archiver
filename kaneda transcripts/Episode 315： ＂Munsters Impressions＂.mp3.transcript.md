[00:00] Welcome to episode 315 of Canatus Pimbal Podcast, the only Pimbal Podcast that is in possession

[00:22] of the Star Wars topper from Stern Pimbal.

[00:25] This is Sunday morning here in New York City on a Presidents Weekend, so hopefully most

[00:29] of you guys have tomorrow off to play more Pimbal.

[00:33] On this episode we're going to talk about some Pimbal news, we're going to talk about the

[00:37] fact that Canatus finally went to Sunshine Laundromat and played the monsters about 20 plays

[00:45] on the game.

[00:46] I'm going to give you my impressions on that game and then I'm going to read some of your

[00:50] emails that you've sent into the show.

[00:52] Okay, how's that sound for a little Sunday morning romp through the world of Pimbal?

[00:57] Where should we start?

[00:58] So here's where I want to start this episode.

[01:01] I want to start on one wish I have for this entire hobby and I've been following this

[01:07] hobby now for three years and I've been in almost every single thread about new games

[01:13] and new ownership experiences and I want to just ask every single manufacturer out there

[01:19] to do all of us a favor.

[01:22] So all of you please send Cliffy, you know, the Cliffy like protective metal parts that

[01:30] save our games.

[01:32] Will you all send him your white woods in advance so that you can install them for us

[01:39] at the factory?

[01:41] Can we just all collectively protest this entire hobby until that becomes a normal practice

[01:48] because there's nothing more annoying than having to pull your game apart to put a metal

[01:54] protector on your game that could easily have been done at the factory.

[02:01] And the reason why I say that thinking about things that could be done at the factory,

[02:05] I spent about two hours last night putting on the Valley Williams metal cabinet brackets

[02:12] onto my Batman.

[02:13] Okay, so for those of you who don't know, when Batman 66 first shipped,

[02:18] it didn't have anything really other than a piece of wood glued in in the seam of the

[02:23] inside of the cabinet and you can put the metal Valley Williams brackets there that just

[02:28] give it a lot more support.

[02:30] I've always wanted to do it because I won't lie, I've been very nervous about cabinet

[02:36] splitting on my game and that's the last thing I would want is a cabinet to split on a

[02:40] $15,000 Batman.

[02:43] I'll tell you this, it wasn't too hard to put those brackets in once I learned a

[02:48] really important lesson because someone just said, do one leg at a time and I shit you

[02:53] not.

[02:54] I'm going to be honest, I took off the front right leg and I realized after the fact

[02:58] is you don't have to completely take the bolt completely off the game and take the leg

[03:05] off.

[03:06] All you have to do is unscrew it enough to get the bracket that's inside there off and

[03:09] I fucking games almost fell over.

[03:12] I shit you not.

[03:13] It started to fall over to the right and I literally did like a die of a slow motion

[03:19] Jerry Brockheimer dive to save the game from falling over and I caught it and I like

[03:24] completely like tore my finger open a little bit but then I realized I don't have to take

[03:28] the leg completely off.

[03:29] I know so stupid, so bonehead but that's the thing about working on pinball games unless

[03:35] you've done some of this stuff before.

[03:37] I've never installed metal cabinet brackets on a game.

[03:41] I also don't have one of those lifts that you can lift up the game on one of the jacks.

[03:47] I don't even know.

[03:48] The dollies that can hold the game up while you work on it.

[03:51] I don't have shit.

[03:53] I have like a socket thing that fits all the different sockets and I have screwdrivers

[03:57] and stuff like that.

[03:58] I have a soldering iron.

[04:00] I really don't know how to use.

[04:01] I'm pretty much a neo fight when it comes to this stuff.

[04:05] Now, I get all the brackets in.

[04:07] I put all the screws in.

[04:09] Thank you to pinball life.

[04:10] If you haven't done this, it's really easy.

[04:12] Pinball life sells all the parts you need.

[04:14] It was only like 25 bucks to put everything in.

[04:17] The whole time I was doing it, I was like, man, I just wish Stern would have done this

[04:21] from the factory.

[04:22] Now, I think they now put these metal cabinet brackets in the game from the factory.

[04:28] You're all good moving forward with Stern games.

[04:31] Here's what I love about pinball.

[04:33] Here's what I know.

[04:34] It's like I love and I hate it.

[04:36] I get everything in.

[04:38] I go to turn the game on and the start button doesn't work.

[04:41] I'm like, fuck, really?

[04:43] What happened here?

[04:45] I had to unscrew the start button, take it out.

[04:48] I did a switch test.

[04:49] It was working.

[04:51] The light in the start button stopped working.

[04:54] I've never seen something like pinball before where sometimes jiggling something makes it

[05:00] work.

[05:01] It's so weird.

[05:02] It's like, you're jiggling the connection.

[05:05] You're moving it around and then all of a sudden everything comes back to life and you're

[05:07] good to go.

[05:08] I get the start button working and then I close the game up and then all of a sudden the

[05:13] pin stadium lights aren't going on.

[05:15] I have no idea why.

[05:17] Then I lift up the cabinet and literally lifting the playfield, sorry, not the cabinet, the

[05:21] playfield, lifting the playfield up just like an inch or a half, the lights go on immediately.

[05:25] I'm like, what the what?

[05:27] Then when I go to lower the playfield, the lights turn off.

[05:30] I don't understand pinball and pinball fixes.

[05:35] It's just such a weird head scratching thing.

[05:39] Then I just moved the pin stadium connection and I double-sided taped it to the back of

[05:43] the cabinet and now it works.

[05:45] I reset all the connectors.

[05:47] Now it works fine.

[05:50] That's pinball.

[05:51] Every day you don't have to check under the hood of a game is a really good game.

[05:56] Sorry, a really good day for pinball.

[05:58] God.

[05:59] All right, let's move on.

[06:01] I want to talk about some things going on with manufacturers that don't give you my

[06:04] impressions of the monsters and then we'll talk about your mail.

[06:07] American pinball.

[06:09] Did you see this?

[06:10] There's a thread that says Houdini knows dive and that is because the prices of Houdini

[06:16] are now sinking really quickly.

[06:19] He used one, went up for sale for $5,000.

[06:22] Here's one that's even crazier.

[06:23] A new in box Houdini that's never been opened is for sale for $6,000 or best offer and

[06:31] it's still for sale.

[06:33] I think this is just indicative of where we are.

[06:37] It's like the game is either great and either is in demand or it's going to lose value quickly

[06:43] sooner than it ever has before.

[06:46] That is where we are with pinball.

[06:47] You either get it right or I think you're going to be in the bargain bin pretty quickly.

[06:53] I think Houdini is finding itself there pretty fast.

[06:58] Lots of people have been talking to me through chatting and texting about the next four

[07:04] themes that are registered for American pinball.

[07:07] I'll say this.

[07:08] Out of all the four themes, it seems that Sherlock Holmes is the one that is rising to the top.

[07:14] I'm also hearing from a lot of people that they just think all four of these themes are

[07:17] going to flop.

[07:19] I don't know.

[07:21] What do you think?

[07:22] All of them are kind of bad for pinball.

[07:25] It doesn't seem like any of them are like, oh my god, take my money now.

[07:29] Yes, we've been waiting for this.

[07:31] I do think that American pinball needs to figure this out.

[07:34] They just can't guess at these themes like this.

[07:39] It's kind of, I don't know what to do.

[07:42] I don't know what to tell them to do.

[07:44] I do think they need to find their TNA.

[07:48] They need to find a game that they know people are excited about and do a small run of something

[07:53] that's maybe been making the rounds at shows.

[07:55] I know games like Nightmare Before Christmas come up all the time.

[07:59] I'm not even going to speculate on whether or not the Big Lebowski is a game they could

[08:03] go grab.

[08:04] I think they need to find something that people really want.

[08:08] I just don't know.

[08:10] Here we go.

[08:11] Two games in a row where I just don't think they've hit the theme out of the park in terms

[08:14] of what people want.

[08:16] Again, this is not my show creating a problem for them.

[08:21] You're the customer.

[08:22] It ultimately people's demand will be the reality for these companies.

[08:28] It's not what I say.

[08:30] It's literally what you feel about these games.

[08:33] It's you guys.

[08:36] If the themes don't excite you, you're not going to want to buy it.

[08:40] That's just where we're at in pinball.

[08:43] Let's talk a little bit about home pins.

[08:46] Not much going on in the home pin world other than something I saw that I'll just touch

[08:50] on.

[08:51] I don't know.

[08:52] This is a rumor that highway pinball, their distributor out there in Australia sort of

[08:56] wants nothing to do anymore with making the original preorder customers hold.

[09:01] They want to wash their hands clean of this whole debacle.

[09:04] I don't know if that's true or not.

[09:06] It's hard now because you can't go to Aussie Arcade Forum to read about what's going

[09:11] on with those owners because I think those threads have been sort of banned from going

[09:15] up.

[09:16] I don't know.

[09:17] I really don't think home pin is going to, I can't see them succeeding with all this stuff

[09:23] coming out.

[09:24] How far down the ladder are they in terms of a pinball company that's going to make it?

[09:29] Let's be honest.

[09:30] All right.

[09:31] Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:32] If you are a owner of the Hobbit, you should probably check out the Hobbit thread.

[09:37] There's just a lot of good discussion around smoug and maintenance on him and his long-term

[09:43] reliability.

[09:44] Some people are having issues with their smoug.

[09:47] His mouth seems to either not move or stay open and you have to recalibrate him.

[09:52] Just a lot of good information in there.

[09:53] If you're having any issues with him, I saw some owners were like, mine's been dead for

[09:57] a year.

[09:58] Look, that game very much revolves around him talking and it's a very cool feature in

[10:03] the game.

[10:04] If you have a Hobbit, I would go check out that thread because you might learn something

[10:07] on how to maybe repair yours.

[10:09] All right.

[10:10] Now look, we are 100% accurate on our assessment of what's next with Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:16] It is going to be Yellow brick road, Wizard of Oz.

[10:20] I know that for a fact.

[10:22] I know people who have seen it and guess what?

[10:24] It has yellow armor on it.

[10:26] I can't get confirmation yet on whether the art has changed on the game and I also don't

[10:31] know what features have changed in the game, but it will have yellow armor.

[10:36] Shocker, right?

[10:38] What else?

[10:39] I have a new topper though, probably because you can't just make it.

[10:43] The 75th anniversary ruby red is that is that theme.

[10:47] So yellow brick road should be different.

[10:49] All right.

[10:50] So then what else is going on at JJP?

[10:53] So look, it's also confirmed that Willy Wonka is next.

[10:57] That is happening.

[10:58] It is not going to be toy story.

[11:00] It is also confirmed that Pirates of the Caribbean will cease production in March.

[11:04] And I want to talk about Pirates of the Caribbean because I have been reading this thread and

[11:10] part of me is just like, man, some of you guys who own this game, you are so high up on it

[11:18] that it almost borders on you're either completely drinking the Kool-Aid or maybe you are right

[11:27] and it's the greatest game of all time, the best game ever.

[11:31] Like when I hear that kind of exaggerated sort of hyperbole review of this game, I have

[11:39] to sort of play a little bit of devil's advocate because again, I played it again a lot yesterday

[11:44] at Sunshine and I do look forward to spending time with a listener from the show.

[11:50] We're going to go there and we're going to play it.

[11:51] He's going to tell me why it's so special.

[11:54] But here's the thing.

[11:55] I think there's something going on at Jersey Jack that a lot of the Pirates of the Caribbean

[12:00] owners just don't want to admit.

[12:03] And it's this.

[12:04] There's a reason why Pirates of the Caribbean production is stopping in March and it's pretty

[12:10] obvious what that reason is.

[12:12] The reason is is that they don't want to order more parts for the game.

[12:17] They don't want to make more pirates.

[12:20] So Jack learned a really important lesson with the Hobbit and this is the truth.

[12:26] This is what happened.

[12:28] They overordered parts on the Hobbit.

[12:30] So they expected the demand to be greater than it really was.

[12:34] And then they have all these Hobbit parts sitting in the factory, probably worth maybe

[12:41] even a few million dollars.

[12:43] And the demand for the game just isn't there.

[12:46] And so then what happens is they get fucked because they can't make enough games to use

[12:53] those parts because there's no buyers and there's no distributors placing new orders.

[12:57] And so they try to do the black arrow edition but we all know you can still go find black

[13:02] arrow edition new inbox Hobbits just sitting at distributors.

[13:08] So they made a business decision that the smartest thing to do would be not to order more

[13:15] pirates parts and let's move on.

[13:18] Let's run all the remaining was parts and get them out.

[13:22] Right.

[13:23] So that's what they're doing.

[13:24] 150 Wizard of Oz, yellow brick road editions and that's to clear the factory from all

[13:29] the was parts.

[13:31] And then they are going to start Willy Wonka production and those will be the parts that

[13:36] are ordered for Willy Wonka.

[13:38] See, the thing with Jack is this.

[13:40] And this is why I think people really like Jersey Jack pinball games is Jersey Jack pinball.

[13:46] You know, for better or worse, maybe this is a dumb business decision, but they don't

[13:49] recycle their parts a lot.

[13:52] You don't open up a Jersey Jack new game and see a lot of the same parts that you saw

[13:58] from a previous game.

[14:00] And we know that other manufacturers out there do go back to the partspin much more than

[14:07] Jersey Jack does because it's just it's better business to do it that way, but it doesn't

[14:12] make for more original pinball.

[14:14] I mean, you have to look no further than even October fest.

[14:17] Why are we saying in October fest the same mechanism that is the Houdini stage in October

[14:23] fest like why because they clearly spent a lot of money R&Ding that part and they probably

[14:30] didn't make as many Houdinis as they would have liked.

[14:33] We see Stern do this all the time with their ramps and other parts of the game.

[14:37] You know, it's it's coming from R&D that happened on other games and they're reusing it.

[14:43] And so look, I mean, it's it's good business to do it that way, but I think Jack doesn't

[14:48] want to get burned.

[14:50] And imagine this like they order, you know, you have to put in bulk orders to get the

[14:54] prices down on these parts.

[14:56] And so is Jack really going to ordering in other 500 parts for the, you know, the upper

[15:01] play field or the rocking ship or the treasure chest.

[15:05] How does, you know, he has to really look at the reality of the orders.

[15:09] Okay.

[15:11] So here's why I have to refute something that I keep hearing in the Pirates of the Caribbean

[15:16] threat.

[15:17] And that is it's the best game ever.

[15:19] It's the greatest game of all time.

[15:20] I know it's not everybody saying that, but here's, here's just something I just can't

[15:24] get over.

[15:25] All right.

[15:26] And I want to just, I just don't understand why people keep saying this.

[15:29] I think Pirates of the Caribbean is an incredible pinball game from a pinball standpoint.

[15:36] And by that, I mean, it's a fresh, it's pretty fresh layout.

[15:40] It has one of the most amazing upper play fields.

[15:43] It's got unique shots.

[15:44] Okay.

[15:45] From a very, just a pinball fresh thinking approach Pirates of the Caribbean brings a lot

[15:52] of fresh thinking to the table.

[15:54] I don't think anyone would deny that.

[15:56] They were very ambitious with some of the mechanisms that didn't work out.

[15:59] We all know that story.

[16:01] And it's got great music.

[16:03] It's got a great light show.

[16:04] I think the experience of playing this game is very visceral.

[16:10] And that's why people who step in front of one that are used to playing mostly sturns

[16:15] and older 90s games, there's just something that raises the bar.

[16:19] And I think every single Jersey Jack game does that to a certain extent.

[16:25] But there, and this is a big but the lack of assets in this game, the way the people

[16:31] who love this game sort of brush that under the rug is just ridiculous.

[16:36] You can't do that.

[16:37] You can't just say, well, you don't even need the assets because it's such a great game.

[16:42] That's such bullshit.

[16:43] I'll tell you why it's bullshit.

[16:45] Pinball has always been and will always be designed to bring a theme to life under glass.

[16:53] And if you're a fan of that theme, okay.

[16:56] The things that you're a fan of should be present in the pinball experience.

[17:02] They shouldn't be distant or not even there.

[17:06] I mean, think about it.

[17:07] How many Batman 66s would have sold if there were no clips from the show?

[17:14] How many hobbits would have sold if there were no hobbit clips?

[17:18] How would that experience be?

[17:19] I mean, hobbit, I think hobbit is probably the greatest theme integration almost ever

[17:25] in pinball when you look at the way they've integrated the movie into the game.

[17:29] And Batman 66, there are like 5,000 video clips.

[17:35] When people deconstruct the code updates, there's almost 5,000 video clips from Batman that

[17:40] are used in different ways throughout the game.

[17:42] No wonder it took lime in two years.

[17:44] And when you look at pirates, the absence of these things, it's just, I don't know how

[17:49] you ignore it.

[17:51] And here's why.

[17:52] There's imagine if you're a huge pirate to the Caribbean fan and you love the movies,

[17:57] you love all the jokes from Jack Sparrow and you love all the scenes that are comical.

[18:02] And you go play Pirates of the Caribbean pinball and it's got this big screen and then you

[18:08] get nothing from Jack Sparrow.

[18:11] There's not one call out from Jack Sparrow.

[18:13] There's not one clip.

[18:14] He's the main character and this whole notion that you can base a game on a property and

[18:21] leave out the main character, their call outs, their memorable moments from that franchise.

[18:28] That is so enane to me.

[18:29] Yeah, let's make Toy Story and leave out Buzz and Woody.

[18:33] Okay, we just don't have permission to use them, but we can still make a Toy Story game.

[18:37] And again, you can.

[18:39] You can make a pinball machine be like that.

[18:42] But there's no way you can say it's one of the greatest pinball experiences of all time

[18:45] because you're not looking at it through the lens of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[18:49] You're just looking at it through the lens of it's a pirate theme game based on Pirates

[18:53] of the Caribbean that actually has a lot of depth to it.

[18:56] And I know the reasons why you love the game, but I think to ignore the reasons why it's

[19:01] not selling is a little ignorant.

[19:07] I think that's the right way to say it.

[19:08] And I think there's a reason why they're not going to make many more of these games.

[19:13] And it's a hard pill to swallow those because the sales aren't there.

[19:17] And if they were there, if they were there, they would keep making this game.

[19:22] Why would they stop?

[19:23] And here's the thing.

[19:24] Here's the thing.

[19:25] And I want everyone, I want to ask a few questions of people out there who absolutely

[19:30] love this game.

[19:31] Okay?

[19:32] All right.

[19:33] Why was the person behind the asset deal for Pirates of the Caribbean?

[19:39] Why was that person fired from Jersey Jack Pinball?

[19:43] All right?

[19:44] Why has Jersey Jack decided to stop production?

[19:48] Why haven't more people ordered this game if it's as great as you guys say it is?

[19:53] Okay?

[19:54] You can still go by in Ellie and it collectors edition two day.

[19:58] They are available in box two day, two ship tomorrow to you if you want it one.

[20:06] Why aren't they being gobbled up as fast as as stern games are gobbled up?

[20:13] Like if it's the best game ever, why not?

[20:17] Is it because people just don't like the theme?

[20:20] Is it because the mechanisms were removed?

[20:23] Is it because they're waiting for Willy Wonka?

[20:26] So here's the thing.

[20:27] There's only one group of people that really know if this is the best Jersey Jack can do.

[20:33] If this is the greatest Jersey Jack machine ever, if this is the best pinball experience

[20:37] ever, the only people that really can understand if Jersey Jack can do better than this,

[20:43] let me tell you who that is.

[20:45] It's the people at Jersey Jack and they know what's coming and they're going to invest

[20:51] in Wonka because they know that there's going to be more demand for Wonka.

[20:57] They must feel that Wonka has a better chance of being the sales hit and they know what

[21:04] is in Wonka, a pat-lawler design game based upon a theme that people love with all of

[21:11] the assets people are going to want.

[21:13] It is going to feel like you are playing Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.

[21:18] All of your favorite movie clips will be there.

[21:21] All of your favorite actors will be there.

[21:24] All of your favorite callouts will be there.

[21:27] It's going to embarrassingly make Pirates of the Caribbean look devoid of being a Pirates

[21:35] of the Caribbean integrated pinball experience.

[21:39] Here's what's going to happen, too, because this is the other thing.

[21:42] For a lot of guys who have Pirates of the Caribbean who are saying, well, the value is going

[21:45] to skyrocket.

[21:46] It's going to go up in price.

[21:47] It's not.

[21:48] Here's why.

[21:49] I know this is like, again, this is another thing that these guys want this to be the case.

[21:53] The only way Pirates of the Caribbean would increase in value significantly is if one thing

[21:59] happened.

[22:00] Is this Jersey Jack pinball goes out of business tomorrow and they stop making pins.

[22:05] This is it.

[22:07] Even every Jersey Jack pinball machine would start to be looked at differently and be more

[22:11] desirable because they're not making anymore.

[22:15] That's not the case.

[22:16] In fact, what's about to happen now is I think they're about to make better games.

[22:22] I think we're going to see it in Willy Wonka.

[22:23] I think we're going to see it in Toy Story.

[22:25] I think we're going to see it in Guns and Roses.

[22:27] I think we're going to see three mega hits from this company.

[22:32] I think Pirates of the Caribbean is going to go down as a game that was a miss because

[22:39] of all of the theme integration problems they had.

[22:43] If you think this isn't just me saying that, Jack also and company thinks that the deal

[22:48] sucked.

[22:49] That's why they fired the guy who did the deal.

[22:53] That's why they woke up and said we can't launch Toy Story without the right assets.

[22:59] That's why they went back and renegotiated for those assets.

[23:03] Do you understand that?

[23:05] They realized that this game came out when the CEO who was let go, when he was making the

[23:12] decisions that led to this Pirates of the Caribbean game and they fired him because of it.

[23:18] He also, I think, over ordered like Hobbit parts, his reign is gone.

[23:23] I think this is a new era for Jersey Jack pinball.

[23:27] I think that's why Pirates of the Caribbean, it's almost like when a, remember when there's

[23:32] like the movie, the writer's strike in Hollywood, it's like it's going to be like that.

[23:36] It's like this, when you see, I think, I think when you see what Wonka and Toy Story bring

[23:41] to the table, I think it's going to be glaringly apparent that something just was a rye when

[23:47] they made Pirates of the Caribbean and it'll be a game that some of you will consider to

[23:50] be amazing and the best ever.

[23:53] I don't think it's going to hold up over time once you see what comes out from Jersey

[23:57] Jack pinball.

[23:58] But again, I'm going to go play it again.

[24:00] I played it more this weekend.

[24:02] I still, I still like, just don't, I'm curious to see how my mind will be completely changed

[24:09] when I play the game and I look forward to it, all right?

[24:15] Okay.

[24:16] So, was that enough about that?

[24:18] And look, here's the thing though.

[24:19] I just want to say this in closing on J.J.P.

[24:21] then I want to give you my months of impression.

[24:23] I'm happy that a lot of you are loving this game, all right?

[24:26] I've said it before and I said it again.

[24:29] Pirates of the Caribbean is it absolutely in bearices, any stern LE that cost the same amount

[24:36] of money.

[24:37] It does.

[24:38] There is a lot in this game and you still feel like you're getting a very premium pinball

[24:43] experience.

[24:45] And when I look at sort of Batman LE next to Monsters LE, next to Deadpool LE, next

[24:50] to Iron Maiden LE, all these games, yes, they are the best version of the stern game.

[24:58] But when you look at them next to Pirates of the Caribbean or like a dialed in, it is incredible.

[25:05] It is almost unfathomable how these games almost cost the same amount of money.

[25:12] And I think Pirates of the Caribbean does give you an incredible pinball experience.

[25:16] I mean, the sound is better, the lights are better, the mechanisms are better.

[25:21] Everything just feels like it's reaching higher than what you're getting with stern LE's,

[25:25] all right?

[25:26] Okay.

[25:27] And that's it.

[25:28] Will they be remade?

[25:29] You know, the jury's out on that.

[25:31] They're not saying they're never going to make him again.

[25:34] But I just think once the new hits are out, people are not going to look back and say,

[25:39] hey, make me more Pirates of the Caribbean.

[25:40] I just don't think that's going to happen, all right?

[25:42] All right.

[25:43] So stern pinball.

[25:45] Let's talk about stern pinball and the monsters.

[25:48] So I went to the sunshine and I played the monsters.

[25:51] I put about 15 to 20 games on the machine and I want to give you my impressions.

[25:56] Now here's the thing.

[25:57] If you've been to sunshine, they have a little bit of everything.

[26:00] They have all the classic value Williams games.

[26:02] They've got everything from Lord of the Rings, Ellie, Metallica, Ellie, they have Deadpool,

[26:07] they have Supreme, they have Beatles, they have Pirates of the Caribbean from Jersey Jack.

[26:13] They've got Tales of the Caribbean Knights.

[26:16] Did I say Iron Maiden Ellie?

[26:17] They have so much.

[26:18] They have Iron Man, they have Tron, it's Star Wars, you know, Guardians of the Galaxy.

[26:25] It's almost like they've got 30 machines and they are the 30 machines you'd want to

[26:29] play, right?

[26:30] Everything from Twilight Zone and they're all there.

[26:33] And what I love about going there is when I go there, it's great because you actually

[26:38] feel like you're going to a miniature pinball show.

[26:41] And all the greatest games of today and yesterday's are sort of represented and they're in good

[26:47] shape.

[26:48] This isn't like a place you go and the games are beat up and features aren't working.

[26:51] I'm Peter who runs the joint takes really good care of the games.

[26:55] He does set them up to be difficult, which I do think is a bit of a problem when you want

[26:59] to give your first impressions on a pinball machine.

[27:02] He always raises the out lane post which is annoying because each play is a dollar.

[27:08] And so he sets them up hard.

[27:10] And the tilts are very, very sensitive.

[27:13] So when you're trying to get your first impression of a game and it's made even harder than

[27:17] the factory thinks it should be, you have to take that into consideration.

[27:22] So you might get frustrated, but it's not really the designer's fault.

[27:28] It's the location that's just trying to milk some more money from you.

[27:31] So keep that in mind.

[27:32] So what did I think of the monster's pinball?

[27:36] Yes, it looks great.

[27:38] Chris of a franchise artwork is really nice for pinball.

[27:41] I have no issues with the artwork.

[27:43] I think the artwork universally has been applauded as looking really good.

[27:47] And that's great.

[27:48] But I'm also at a point now where we've seen a lot of good looking pinball machines in

[27:53] a row from Stern from other manufacturers.

[27:56] I'm starting to just feel like great art is par for the course in pinball.

[28:02] It is no longer enough of a reason to buy a pinball machine.

[28:06] I just think all of them for what they cost should have great art.

[28:10] The shots are fine.

[28:11] I enjoyed shooting the game.

[28:14] The ramps are really rewarding to hit.

[28:16] The orbit is a really fun satisfying shot.

[28:19] I didn't really have any sort of like issues with the way the game shot.

[28:24] I thought it had good flow.

[28:26] I thought it was really fast.

[28:28] There are some brutal out lane drains on the right side.

[28:31] I didn't notice that.

[28:33] You kind of got to keep the ball away from the right out lane.

[28:38] As far as a game that has flow, it has flow.

[28:43] It's easy to trap the ball.

[28:45] To me it was more of a flow again than a stop and go game.

[28:49] The ramps are really cool.

[28:50] I do love the left and right ramp.

[28:52] I think they both do something differently.

[28:54] The right ramp has that nice loop over on itself, which is really interesting.

[28:59] The left one goes around to the back of the game.

[29:02] Very fast though.

[29:03] Very fast action on the ramps.

[29:05] Here is the thing.

[29:07] I enjoyed the game.

[29:09] If I had to describe what my thoughts were after playing it for 20 plays, I think it's

[29:17] this.

[29:18] I think the game is fine.

[29:19] F-I-N-E-Fine.

[29:21] I didn't hate it.

[29:24] I didn't absolutely get blown away by anything in it.

[29:27] I thought it was just a good game.

[29:32] I almost said they were fun.

[29:33] I had fun playing every game.

[29:36] To me it's not about just that.

[29:39] Come on.

[29:40] Let's be honest with ourselves for a minute.

[29:42] Is this a game that is bringing anything new to the table?

[29:46] That's where I'm at with Pimball these days.

[29:49] When I jump on a machine like this, the first thing I'm asking myself is what's new

[29:53] here?

[29:54] What's original?

[29:55] The ramps are a little bit different.

[29:56] The ramps, is there anything happening in this game that feels tremendously new, innovative

[30:03] and completely like fresh thinking made its way into this game?

[30:08] I have to say that I just don't feel that from this game.

[30:12] You know when Iron Maiden came out and it definitely felt like there was fresh thinking

[30:17] that went into Iron Maiden.

[30:19] It felt like the layout was completely unique.

[30:22] The pops were always where the pops are.

[30:24] The ramps weren't always where the ramps are.

[30:26] There was more flippers in the game than are normally in a game.

[30:29] It just felt like a completely new approach to a Pimball layout.

[30:33] I think when you play monsters, you're not going to get that.

[30:37] You've got your two ramps, you've got your scoop, you've got your orbits and you've got

[30:40] your kick out on the Dracula shot on the left side.

[30:44] There's just not anything completely original.

[30:47] You've got the magnet that grabs the ball or sings the ball around in front of Herman.

[30:52] That's about, you know, that's it.

[30:54] There's nothing that's completely original.

[30:56] Look, this was a pro version.

[30:58] There wasn't a lower play field than I could hear people already being like, but that's

[31:01] what the whole point of the premium alley is is the lower play field.

[31:04] I get it and I will put time on that when it's available.

[31:07] I haven't been able to find one.

[31:10] I think the game is like, it's fine.

[31:13] It didn't move me either way.

[31:15] The thing that it didn't do when I played it is it didn't really pull me in with the

[31:20] code.

[31:21] I read on the game card how to play it.

[31:24] You collect the characters.

[31:25] You collect, you sort of boost them.

[31:29] You're supposed to be building up your jackpots.

[31:32] The zap button on the lockdown bar was just a little confusing to me.

[31:37] It almost felt like you're always cancelling the jackpot.

[31:40] You cancel it to build up the jackpot to then cash it in.

[31:44] I don't know how I feel about that.

[31:46] It just kind of feels like you're doing all this, you're doing negatives to get to

[31:51] a positive.

[31:52] You're sort of not now, not now, not now, not now, not now.

[31:56] Okay, now, it's just really strange to me.

[31:59] It's like someone's like, Wheel of Fortune, you keep spinning the wheel until you get more

[32:02] and more money and then you don't want to go bankrupt.

[32:04] I get it.

[32:05] I get the approach, but I just didn't find that very fun.

[32:10] That being the way the game is structured from a code standpoint.

[32:13] You collect the characters.

[32:15] I will say this, the one, the big targets for Lilly and the Dracula, they're just no

[32:22] way around it.

[32:23] They're not rewarding to hit.

[32:27] They're so big and there's something about hitting individual targets that just makes

[32:33] it much more satisfying.

[32:36] It's more satisfying to aim for the letter you need when you're spelling a name.

[32:40] It's much more satisfying to see drop targets happen.

[32:44] I mean, imagine the Beatles instead of those drop targets, you had just one whole bank

[32:49] that said fab and one whole bank that said four and any hit anywhere on that target would

[32:54] register how boring and unsatisfying that would feel.

[33:00] That's the thing is we're at a point now where I'm just, I'm having a hard time doing

[33:08] these impressions for you because I can already hear people being like, well, you didn't

[33:13] play enough and you should play it more.

[33:15] I always feel like there's this pressure where I don't want to be negative about pinball

[33:18] machines all the time and I don't think I am.

[33:22] I also just think we're getting to a point now where I'm just feeling a lot of parody

[33:27] and repetition in these games.

[33:30] I step away from them and I just ask myself, how could anyone like play this and feel

[33:37] the desire to have to own it?

[33:40] Trust me being honest with you because when you're spending this kind of money, there

[33:44] are so many great games that I think do more unique stuff and have more fun stuff going

[33:52] on in the game that you could also buy for the same amount of money.

[33:57] I just don't understand like how you wake up and you're like, well, this is this, I need

[34:01] to have this game now.

[34:05] That's sort of just where I'm at.

[34:07] And especially when you're at a place like Sunshine, when you can jump around different

[34:11] machines, it's even more glaringly apparent what the better buys are.

[34:17] And I'll say this and maybe I shouldn't have done this.

[34:21] But basically three feet behind the monsters was a Lord of the Rings, Ellie at Sunshine.

[34:28] And I kid you not.

[34:30] Then game on that machine just exposed really just how barren and sparse these new games

[34:38] are.

[34:39] And I mean from every single standpoint, from there's just so many more interesting shots

[34:43] in Lord of the Rings.

[34:45] There's just so much more interaction between the ball and the toys.

[34:48] There's just so much better like callouts going on.

[34:52] And you kind of know what's going on with the game without all of this LCD stuff.

[34:57] And that's the other thing too when I was playing monsters, there's just so many points

[35:01] on the screen where the font sizes were just way too small.

[35:06] And they kept using different fonts.

[35:08] It just felt really sloppy to me.

[35:11] I don't need a lot.

[35:13] I don't want to read a lot of words.

[35:14] I don't understand what's happening when you get to the Dracula part.

[35:18] And there's like, it's like, it's like a PowerPoint slide, bulleting out all these

[35:22] different things.

[35:23] And I'm just confused and I don't know why and I don't know what I need to read.

[35:27] And some of the text is just way too small to be up on a screen like that.

[35:31] In fact, now that's turned as this LCD, the text should be even bigger than it was during

[35:38] the DMD era.

[35:39] But it's actually a lot of times smaller.

[35:42] They're trying to cram more stuff on.

[35:44] So you actually, it's harder to read what's on a bigger screen.

[35:48] And that makes no sense to me.

[35:51] And I think they're still trying to figure this out.

[35:53] But that's my take.

[35:54] It's like, I think the monsters is fine.

[35:56] I don't think it's great.

[35:57] I don't think it's bad.

[35:59] I just don't see what's so magical about it.

[36:02] And am I wrong in wanting to expect something completely fresh and something new from every

[36:08] new pinball game?

[36:09] And let's take Herman, for example.

[36:12] I mean, we've seen Stern in the past.

[36:15] Herman, his behavior, his behavior on the show was he's always like smashing his arms

[36:21] up and down like in his little bit of his hissy fit, right?

[36:24] Why doesn't the Herman toy on the game raise his arms up and down the way the incredible

[36:30] Hulk did in Avengers?

[36:33] Why?

[36:34] He's just statically there.

[36:36] He doesn't move at all.

[36:38] And I'm sorry, but I get maybe on the pro they didn't have an animated Herman, but on

[36:43] an Ellie or premium, the fact just that motion of his his arms going up and down when you

[36:49] shoot him or when the balls on the magnet would add such a dynamic to the game.

[36:56] And instead, the only place we see him, you know, doing his Herman smash is on the LCD.

[37:02] And again, I think that is indicative of where we are is so much of of the magic is up

[37:09] on the screen now.

[37:11] And then what happens because of that is we are judging these games solely the most

[37:17] important thing now that we're that we're judging a game and the experience is all about

[37:21] the code and is the code doing what I wanted to do.

[37:25] And I think when that happens, we've sort of all losing.

[37:29] I do I believe this like it shouldn't just be about that, but it is that's where we

[37:34] are today.

[37:35] The pinball is now software.

[37:37] It is one 100% the most important thing happening in a pinball game.

[37:41] It's no longer physical.

[37:42] It's digital.

[37:44] It's the software.

[37:45] And I don't like that.

[37:48] I do like that, you know, in Pirates of the Caribbean, there's more physical stuff on the

[37:52] game that then there is like, you know, and there's a lot of software, but there's they

[37:57] they try to put a lot more physical stuff.

[37:59] I mean, looking at dialed in, it's the epitome of like, oh my God, there's so much physical

[38:03] stuff in that game, which I love.

[38:05] I want more games like that.

[38:07] And I know we haven't seen a game recently that sort of did both.

[38:12] We really haven't.

[38:13] We haven't seen a game recently that had the right amount of physical and the right

[38:18] amount of digital working together harmoniously.

[38:21] That's really what I'm waiting for in this hobby is where is the game that gives me the

[38:25] toys and the depth that I want with the theme that I want that that's that's what I'm

[38:31] waiting to spend my money on.

[38:33] And so then the question becomes is like, well, then you know, I just know a lot of guys

[38:38] who bought monsters Ali without ever playing it and it's a head scratcher.

[38:42] It's a real head scratcher because how do you know you're going to like it?

[38:45] And for a lot of these guys, it is important that these games have depth and the code is

[38:49] really entertaining and they're going to enjoy it for a long period of time and look at

[38:55] the early reviews from a lot of very seasoned players.

[39:00] I think the code is going to be a lot more simplistic than these gentlemen want.

[39:06] Now that being said, the game is not really long ball times.

[39:10] It's still a hard game.

[39:12] And so, you know, if the game shoots hard and the code is simpler, there might be some

[39:17] some balancing on that works there, right?

[39:19] Again, why not?

[39:21] You know, I mean, is the code super deep in TNA?

[39:25] No, but because TNA is really difficult and fast.

[39:28] So doesn't need very complex code.

[39:31] So a little bit of that is going on in the monsters, I think.

[39:33] They're not going to see extremely long ball times.

[39:37] So that's what I'm at.

[39:39] And man, even as I talk about this stuff, I hope I'm not sounding like I'm Debbie Downer.

[39:44] I'm just really hopeful that in 2019, I think we're on the verge of a fresh thinking in

[39:50] Pimble.

[39:52] And I hope we can see a company that brings fresh thinking to the table, also be profitable

[39:58] and also figure out how to manufacture and get us these machines.

[40:02] I mean, we all know Stern's got the manufacturing down.

[40:05] But are they bringing that fresh thinking that is just the magic of Pimble to us?

[40:11] I don't know.

[40:12] I don't know.

[40:13] And again, I think if you love the monsters as a theme, you will enjoy this game a lot.

[40:19] I think some of you out there, everything is fun.

[40:21] So that's cool.

[40:23] I, for one, just don't, I just didn't walk away from this machine being like, I need

[40:28] to own this.

[40:29] I think you, I would have a lot more fun with just like an Iron Man or Metallica or Lord

[40:35] of the Rings.

[40:36] There's just a lot of games you could buy that are of similar price.

[40:39] All right.

[40:40] Now, speaking of monsters, Elie though.

[40:42] So one shipped out and here's, I just need, I need to bring this up before I reach

[40:45] her mail.

[40:47] One shipped out and the lockdown bar on the monsters, Elie, the black on the lockdown bar does

[40:54] not match the black on the side armor.

[40:58] And I just wanted to call this out because this is the first Elie that I've seen shipped

[41:03] to the public.

[41:04] And I really hope that this isn't the case on all of the Elies that go out.

[41:09] But it went to that.

[41:10] I think it's like Helicon Brewing Company.

[41:12] I really hope that all of you who just paid $9,000, your armor matches.

[41:19] And I don't know how that left the factory.

[41:23] I don't know who thought that was acceptable.

[41:25] But I don't know if that's going to plague every game or this is just the first batch

[41:30] of lockdown bars.

[41:32] But someone stood over that game and said, this is our first Elie going to a customer.

[41:39] These don't, this doesn't match up.

[41:41] And the game was still put in box and shipped to a customer.

[41:46] And maybe the customer wanted it before the lockdown bar was available.

[41:49] I don't know.

[41:50] See, I don't know the full story.

[41:52] But I'm just hoping that you guys who went all in on your $9,000 Elie, you don't have

[41:57] to then spend extra money getting your armors to sync up the color correctly.

[42:03] For this much money, these things should be mint and you shouldn't have to change anything.

[42:09] And I think for $9,000, the game should come included with a topper.

[42:16] I'm again, I'm just saying there's a lot of money.

[42:19] These $9,000 turns next to $9,000, your two jack machines, you should get more and the

[42:25] kitchen sink in these games.

[42:27] All right, let me read some of your mail and then we'll call the day.

[42:31] How's that sound?

[42:32] Sorry, guys.

[42:33] All right, so I got an email from Brian, first of all, Brian Albert.

[42:36] I love that you send me voice of reactions to my shows.

[42:40] Love it.

[42:41] You sent me a seven minute one.

[42:43] I can't do that.

[42:45] I can't air it on this episode either because I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I don't

[42:49] want to spend my time.

[42:50] Here's the deal.

[42:51] I don't want to spend my time editing your feedback because that puts work on my shoulders.

[42:58] You know the deal.

[43:00] If you want to give me feedback, it has to be short and to the point and two to three minutes

[43:05] at most.

[43:06] Okay, you're going to learn your lesson because I'm not going to do it.

[43:08] I'm not going to spend my time editing seven minutes of a guess telling me something.

[43:13] It might be the smartest thing you've ever said, but I'm not doing it.

[43:16] All right, I got an email from RCD.

[43:18] The subject is your new master.

[43:22] Hey, man, a quick note to say, keep up the good work.

[43:25] I've been listening since day one and lately you have hit your stride.

[43:29] You obviously know how to take constructive and non-constructive criticism and your delivery

[43:35] has improved because of it.

[43:36] I think it's just my mic that's improved, but consistently delivering compelling content

[43:40] you are building a loyal fan base.

[43:42] I don't always agree with your opinions or how stridently you repeat them, add nauseam,

[43:49] but we appreciate your willingness to hear the other side and even sometimes change your

[43:53] mind.

[43:54] I listened to a few other podcasts and for the most part, can't stand the bland fanboy

[44:00] tournament talk except for the boys down under.

[44:03] I fast forward the tournament talk, but they usually make me chuckle.

[44:07] Lately they have really turned me off with the we don't care about the twippies and it's

[44:12] just a popularity contest blah, blah, blah, no shit.

[44:16] Don't let the fake news cry baby losers detract from your twippy victory.

[44:21] You will win because you are not afraid to say what's on your mind.

[44:25] Don't change now.

[44:26] It's funny how this twippy controversy has paralleled all the BS happening in US politics.

[44:32] Let me just stop there for a moment.

[44:34] Let's just see what happens in the twippies.

[44:37] Everyone had a chance to ask their listeners to vote for them.

[44:41] Nobody rigged the twippies.

[44:43] I didn't pay any money for twippy votes.

[44:46] I think it was really hard for me to hear Jeff Theolisk go on head to head and I was

[44:52] really disappointed by what he said and I was really disappointed by what Marty said

[44:58] about.

[44:59] If you listen to them, it literally Marty says, well, it's already been decided.

[45:03] Whoever gets the most listens is the most popular in Pimbo.

[45:08] He says that and he's referring to the fact that he feels like he is the most popular

[45:12] Pimbo.

[45:13] They have the most popular Pimbo podcast because they have the numbers to prove it and that's

[45:18] that and that's all that matters.

[45:22] That's not how it works.

[45:23] It's just not how life works.

[45:25] It's not how any of this works.

[45:27] There's a difference between people tuning in and listening to luminaries in the Pimbo

[45:34] hobby being interviewed because people want to hear from them.

[45:37] They want to hear what they have to say, but that doesn't necessarily mean that people

[45:42] out there think you're the most popular or they're the most that you have the best show.

[45:48] Last time I checked, best movies aren't selected because of the box office numbers.

[45:55] They're selected because there's a panel of people.

[45:57] There's a panel, but it was voting.

[46:00] Everyone knew the way the system worked.

[46:02] I think it was really unfair to Jeff, to Greg, to Zach, to all the people who worked

[46:07] really hard to put this together and are still working really hard to put this together.

[46:11] I thought it was really unfair how that podcast recently has undermined all their hard work,

[46:19] shits on the whole thing and then later on tries to do a Miyakopa saying that they care,

[46:25] which one is it?

[46:26] I don't think they've ever been fully straight forward and direct with any of us.

[46:31] It's a shame.

[46:32] It's a shame.

[46:33] This show has always been completely straight forward with you that I do care about the

[46:37] Twippies.

[46:38] I do love the fact that you listen to this show and I hope you vote for me.

[46:43] Isn't that just more natural to just be honest?

[46:46] Why would I crap on the only thing we have that is recognition happens once a year and

[46:53] why would I say that it's not important?

[46:56] I don't do the show to win, but it is important to me that we at least have a good showing

[47:03] in an award show.

[47:07] It's so silly to crap on it like that.

[47:09] I think a lot of people are working really hard on it and I think that that show they

[47:14] put up was very, very calculated.

[47:17] It was very calculated.

[47:19] Jeff Theillus' commentary on it.

[47:22] He didn't want to talk about it.

[47:25] You're a dick, Marty, for bringing it up.

[47:28] He knew exactly what he was going to say.

[47:30] It was very calculated.

[47:31] It was also very calculated that Ryan then comes on the show pretending to be Brian's.

[47:37] It was all very calculated and I don't think this show does any of that sort of weird spin

[47:43] in a calculated way to push some agenda that we're not being honest about.

[47:48] I think we were very honest about it.

[47:50] I'll just leave it at that.

[47:52] He then goes on to say in his email.

[47:55] On a lighter note, I had an idea for an original theme.

[47:58] I think a classical period music theme pin would be great if done right.

[48:02] It's an open IP and could be highly stylized with great music and Matt Andrews art.

[48:08] You could get really creative with a storyline.

[48:11] Create an alternate timeline where Bach, Mozart and Beethoven must team up to fight alien

[48:16] invaders that hate classical music.

[48:19] Drop the great pieces and build a symphony to explode their heads.

[48:24] Anyways, I'm a little bit different so I don't know if anyone else would go for that.

[48:29] I love Houdini and Phantom of the Opera with such a cool pin.

[48:33] I'm sick and tired of the typical layout cookie cutter TV show movie comic book rock band

[48:37] appeal to the lowest common denominator pin.

[48:40] Keep calm and carry on your new master.

[48:42] All right.

[48:43] Look, I don't think a classical pin would sell.

[48:48] I think what would be really cool is if they made Bill and Ted's excellent adventure

[48:53] because then you could get all that cool Beethoven music into that pin in a fun way.

[48:58] I also think that Broadway shows would make for great pinball experiences because I think

[49:03] when we think about family friendly themes that the wife and the kids would love to have

[49:07] in the house, why don't we have more Broadway pinball?

[49:12] And Phantom of the Opera would be amazing.

[49:15] That's the Angelou de Weber one.

[49:16] And can you imagine the toys and the layout and the art of a Phantom of the Opera pinball

[49:21] machine?

[49:22] It would be epic.

[49:23] I know it would be expensive to make, but it'd be so worth it because the music is incredible.

[49:29] It's absolutely incredible.

[49:30] All right.

[49:31] Let me go on.

[49:32] I got an email from Doudou Michael Peterson.

[49:34] He says, hey, Canada.

[49:37] I'm a big fan of the show.

[49:38] I've been in the hobby a couple of years.

[49:40] Just started listening to your podcast about a month ago.

[49:43] How about a show topic on how official pinball tournaments work?

[49:48] Strikes, format.

[49:50] I want to enter one, but I have no clue how they work.

[49:53] Also how about explaining pinball playing tips, tricks to improve pinball skills?

[49:58] Thanks brother.

[49:59] Keep up the good work.

[50:01] Mike did someone put you up to this to ask me to cover the two things that I never

[50:05] talk about on this show?

[50:07] This is not a show about pinball tournaments.

[50:10] This is not a show about strategy on how to get to higher score in pinball.

[50:13] I'll tell you why it's not that show because every other pinball podcast does that for

[50:17] the most part.

[50:18] There are plenty of things out there.

[50:19] I would recommend this though.

[50:21] If you want to know how tournaments work, I would look at YouTube and Twitch streams

[50:27] of pinball.

[50:28] But for the most part, here's what I know about how tournaments typically work.

[50:32] You enter a tournament.

[50:34] You are scheduled when to play.

[50:36] You play against someone else and you're all playing against the same four or five machines.

[50:41] Then you go on if you beat that person.

[50:44] Isn't that how it works?

[50:45] I think so.

[50:46] I don't even know.

[50:47] Maybe it's...

[50:48] Yeah.

[50:49] I don't know.

[50:50] I know it's so little about pinball tournaments.

[50:52] All I know is this.

[50:53] I see people playing pinball tournaments when I'm at shows.

[50:57] I always feel bad for them because so much of their time is spent in the tournament.

[51:01] I think they miss out on so much of the rest of the show, which is so much fun.

[51:06] But for tournament players who love it, they love it.

[51:09] I'm just the last person to ask about pinball tournaments and tips and tricks.

[51:14] Here's a good tip and trick.

[51:17] Dead flip the ball.

[51:18] Cradle it when you can and learn to line up your shots.

[51:22] You'll love pinball.

[51:23] All right.

[51:24] Let's go on to do sunshine and pirates.

[51:26] I got an email from C. Rodney.

[51:31] He says, Chris, I know you said you would be joining another listener at Sunshine and

[51:34] March to play pirates.

[51:36] He's going to be in town as well.

[51:38] He was asking if we could go together on Sunday, March 3rd to all learn this game together.

[51:44] Rodney, let me see if we can make that happen.

[51:47] It would be nice.

[51:48] The more the merrier, I think we should get a whole group of people who are sour on pirate

[51:52] to the Caribbean.

[51:53] And we should all march in there to determine to figure out how this game could possibly

[51:58] be the greatest game of all time.

[52:01] Because we on our own, we've unsuccessfully been able to feel that about the game.

[52:05] But together, we will learn what makes it so special.

[52:08] I can't wait.

[52:09] I love the fact that you actually need someone to explain to you what makes the game so great.

[52:14] But that's just where we are.

[52:15] Let's see.

[52:16] Got an episode from...

[52:18] Let's see.

[52:19] Again, I think from Michael Peterson, he, right, I think we just heard from Michael.

[52:23] He's a great episode 314.

[52:25] Funny thing is, I have a bunch of friends.

[52:27] I'm in a golf league.

[52:29] Blah blah blah.

[52:30] I have very few that are crazy about Pimball like me.

[52:33] I plan on going to Expo with a buddy.

[52:35] We should grab a beer and play some Pimball.

[52:38] One more thing.

[52:39] I believe we are in the beginning of an all-time high of Pimball.

[52:42] I don't think people realize this.

[52:45] My hope is that the younger generation grows loving Pimball.

[52:48] It seems like the hobby is flooded with old timers.

[52:51] I'm 44, so not an old timer, but no young buck either.

[52:55] I try my best to get friends and family to embrace the hobby, keep doing what you're

[52:59] doing, brother, Mike.

[53:01] All right.

[53:02] Okay, Mike, thank you for that.

[53:03] I think it's great.

[53:04] Here's the deal.

[53:05] Here's the deal.

[53:06] And then we're going to stop this podcast before we hit an hour.

[53:10] Pimball is not going to be that popular 10 years from now.

[53:16] It's not going to...

[53:17] Every year, it's going to...

[53:20] We have a few more golden years, for sure.

[53:22] I think with all these companies putting Pimball out there, it's going to be fun.

[53:28] The younger generation is not going to carry the torch.

[53:30] They're just not.

[53:33] The amount of young people out there that are into Pimball is few and far between.

[53:39] When you go to the shows, when you look at who's actually on the forums, it's not...

[53:44] They don't have the next generation, and they won't.

[53:47] And they don't care.

[53:49] As much as we talk all the time about Pimball, the reason they don't care is...

[53:53] It's an old thing.

[53:54] It's a very old toy.

[53:56] It is archaic to them.

[53:59] Even though we think that Pimball is innovated, it still feels like something from the 80s

[54:04] that old men are still into.

[54:08] That's that.

[54:10] What's coming down the road for these younglings with video games and AR and VR and all the different

[54:17] stuff, instant gratification kind of games, they don't see the appeal in these games.

[54:23] I know what you guys are saying.

[54:24] Those of you who listen to this show, you have kids who have grown up with Pimball in

[54:31] the house.

[54:32] And so it's hard for you to look at this objectively because you're going to be like,

[54:36] my kids love Pimball, but that's not the point.

[54:39] The point is that millions and millions and millions of people play Fortnite.

[54:45] Millions and millions and millions of people play Red Dead.

[54:49] Only a few thousand play the newest Pimball machine.

[54:53] It's very, very niche and it's now very, very expensive.

[54:58] And I don't know about what news outlets you're reading, but last time I checked, most young

[55:04] people are coming out of college with tons of debt, tons of student loans, jobs are harder

[55:10] to get, cities are becoming really expensive.

[55:13] The point at which these people can say, hey, I'm going to go buy a Pimball machine.

[55:18] That's not happening anytime soon.

[55:21] And I know there's barcades popping up and more Pimball things popping up, but look who's

[55:24] driving it all.

[55:26] It is done by people who are between 40 and 60, who are now in the prime earning of their

[55:32] careers.

[55:33] And that is why we're seeing this resurgence now.

[55:36] But it's still a long way away from where Pimball used to be in which Adam's family sold

[55:43] 20,000.

[55:44] I mean, Pimball was, when they are Cade, when they are Cade scene was around.

[55:49] It was still like four to five times bigger than it will ever be again.

[55:55] And I'm curious to see how long it can last.

[55:59] I can't last forever.

[56:01] And it won't last forever.

[56:03] But it's a good time to be in it.

[56:05] But this whole notion of making Pimball to get the next generation into it is just a few

[56:11] tile effort.

[56:12] It really is.

[56:13] It's not, it'll never, it'll never be that way.

[56:17] It's really, really difficult to understand that for a lot of people.

[56:20] And again, because it's a very much like a niche enthusiast thing.

[56:23] It's also like you have a whole generation of people who are growing up, who want to live

[56:28] in cities that you know what else they don't like.

[56:30] They don't like cars.

[56:31] Look at how car sales are doing.

[56:33] The future of like enthusiast cars looks really bleak.

[56:37] In 20, 30 years, you won't even be able to drive your car around the street if you have

[56:42] like a muscle car.

[56:43] You're going to be relegated to a track.

[56:45] It's the same way people can ride a horse down the street, even if they have one, they

[56:50] have to have like private tracks to do it on.

[56:52] So I would love to see Pimball gravitate, you know, or sorry, like attract more young

[56:58] people.

[56:59] It's just, just come on.

[57:01] Like look how they grow up.

[57:02] Look what they have in front of them.

[57:03] It's, it's, it's old.

[57:05] It's boring.

[57:06] It's confusing to most.

[57:07] And that is how I think they look at it.

[57:09] All right.

[57:10] All right.

[57:11] Any final thoughts on this episode, 315 at Canadian Pimball Podcast?

[57:15] Not really.

[57:16] I think you guys enjoyed 314.

[57:17] I told you why I loved Pimball.

[57:18] I still love Pimball.

[57:20] But I expect a lot.

[57:21] I expect a lot in 2019.

[57:24] And I think the place to be right now is just on the sidelines.

[57:27] Just wait to see what comes out.

[57:30] I don't understand.

[57:31] That's the thing.

[57:32] I'm just confused.

[57:33] This need to buy.

[57:34] And I see people selling their Munsters pros with 200 plays and all these people I know

[57:36] bought the Munsters L.E. without even playing it.

[57:40] I think a lot of you, a lot of you are going to be disappointed.

[57:45] I do.

[57:46] Not, not just like, it's not, not necessarily the game.

[57:48] I just think the time of buying and seeing if you like it when it's in your house and

[57:54] you're not going to lose much.

[57:55] I, I, you're going to start losing more and more.

[57:59] It's also going to be harder and harder to find people to buy these games used.

[58:03] It just is because I think if you're smart in 2019, you wait.

[58:08] You wait.

[58:09] There's no point.

[58:10] I don't want to be a firm pros forever.

[58:11] Why would you rush in and buy a pro of anything now?

[58:13] It is like wait to see, wait to see what the final code is, wait to see if it's good, wait

[58:16] to see what people say to have one of the first ones of new pinball machine has absolutely

[58:22] no appeal to me at all.

[58:25] Because they'll just make it forever.

[58:26] I don't know.

[58:27] That just seems like that's just what's inside my head.

[58:29] I don't know what's inside your head.

[58:30] It's also the last thing these manufacturers want you to do is behave that way.

[58:34] They want you to get on the hype train and buy, buy, buy, buy without thinking.

[58:38] Is it worth it?

[58:39] Buy it.

[58:40] Am I going to like it?

[58:41] No, no, buy it.

[58:42] Buy it.

[58:43] Come on, buy it.

[58:44] It's got good art.

[58:45] Come on, trust us, buy it.

[58:46] It's code.

[58:47] I know.

[58:48] It's almost done.

[58:49] Buy it, buy it, buy it.

[58:50] No, I'm not.

[58:51] I'm going to wait.

[58:52] I'm going to see what Willy Wonka's like.

[58:53] I'm going to see what deep root has.

[58:54] I'm going to see what yellowbick road is.

[58:57] I'm going to wait.

[58:58] Batman will not be here by the end of the year.

[59:02] Doesn't mean I'm going to sell Batman.

[59:03] I'm thinking about it.

[59:04] I might put it somewhere else.

[59:05] There will be a new game in my home by the end of the year.

[59:08] We'll see what it's going to be.

[59:09] There's going to be a chance to buy magic girl by the end of the year.

[59:12] We're going to have a chance to buy so much new stuff.

[59:14] I would just wait.

[59:16] They don't want you to wait.

[59:17] Get on the hype train.

[59:18] Buy it now.

[59:19] Go on Pinside and then be like, hey, I got 20 plates.

[59:22] It's for sale for $4800.

[59:23] Nope.

[59:24] Not for me.

[59:25] Everyone have a great talk to you later.
