[00:00] Okay, let's do a recap real quick of what Kaneda predicted.

[00:19] I predicted the next Stern machine would be the Mandalorian.

[00:23] I predicted that the reveal would be May 11th, and I also predicted that there would most

[00:29] likely be a teaser on May 4th.

[00:32] What has happened so far?

[00:34] Now this was not the reveal.

[00:36] This is just the confirmation of what you've already known if you followed Kaneda's

[00:41] Pimbal Podcast that Stern and Brian Eddie's next machine is the Mandalorian.

[00:47] So we're going to talk a little bit about this confirmation that we finally have, and

[00:50] now what's going to happen next is everything I said that's going to happen next.

[00:55] The LEDs are going to sell out before they're even revealed, and you know this.

[01:00] Because to those of you out there who have followed me in the past, the reason why I give

[01:04] you this information is so that you can make decisions on these games ahead of time.

[01:10] And we've been saying it for weeks now.

[01:12] There is way more demand for Pimbal machines than there is supply.

[01:17] And if you have information of this sorts, it helps you out.

[01:21] It helps you find an LE that's available from a distributor, and you can get on their

[01:27] list and buy this game for hopefully the MSRP.

[01:31] Now we're also hearing that Stern has raised the prices at the same time.

[01:35] So I think we're going to see a one to two hundred dollar increase on these Stern models

[01:41] moving forward on the pro premium and LE's are all going to see a price increase.

[01:46] But you know, and I know that if you score a Mandalorian on day one for MSRP that you

[01:54] are going to have a machine that is worth way more on day one than the ninety two or ninety

[02:00] three hundred bucks you're going to pay for it.

[02:02] And the reason I'm happy to do shows like this and give you guys this information is if

[02:07] you follow canada if you think about it for those of you who listen to me on guns and

[02:11] roses collectives edition you now are in possession of a machine that is worth six to

[02:16] seven thousand dollars more than you spent on it because you listened to canada.

[02:21] And I'm here to tell you I think the Mandalorian is another title that is going to have so

[02:26] much more demand than supply.

[02:28] And let's talk about why I think that if you think about the recent titles that have

[02:32] come out in the Pimbal world, how many of them are really titles that the whole family

[02:37] can enjoy.

[02:38] I mean think about that.

[02:40] How many of these machines that have come out recently is something that the wife, the

[02:44] children and you all can enjoy.

[02:49] Guns and roses not so much maybe you and the wife but probably not the kids.

[02:55] Led Zeppelin definitely not the kids and maybe the wife but there's also just a lot of

[02:59] people that don't like either guns and roses or Led Zeppelin.

[03:03] Alien.

[03:04] No, I don't think that's a family friendly title.

[03:06] The big Lebowski that's not something the whole family is dying to get their hands

[03:10] on.

[03:11] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, okay?

[03:13] Not really.

[03:14] Even though it seems like that would be one that everybody would want, you know your

[03:17] wife doesn't care about TMNT at all.

[03:20] You know your kids might not even care about it.

[03:22] I think TMNT is actually pretty much a miss in terms of theme for Pimbal because it's

[03:27] not something that a lot of grown men are still into and it's not a property that all

[03:32] these kids today are really into.

[03:34] It's not.

[03:35] You go on to Avengers comic book, right?

[03:37] The Avengers comic book.

[03:39] Your wife doesn't care about that and most likely your kids don't even care about it.

[03:43] They might have seen the movies but this is not based on the movies so that's another

[03:47] one where the whole family doesn't really want it and I would argue that the last theme

[03:52] in which the whole family could get around it would be Stranger Things which was somewhat

[03:57] of a miss.

[03:58] And so here we have another title that's contemporary that everybody in the family loves the

[04:05] Mandalorian and for those of you gentlemen on Pinsider like I've never seen the Mandalorian

[04:10] I don't need another Star Wars pin you sound really stupid you sound really stupid for

[04:15] a few reasons if you haven't seen the Mandalorian then why are you missing out on what is

[04:21] arguably the greatest Star Wars content we've had in a very long time and maybe over

[04:27] like 10 years this is the property that got people back into Star Wars all the die hard

[04:33] Star Wars fans that were disappointed by the last trilogy in the theaters.

[04:37] The Mandalorian brought back what all of us have loved about Star Wars since we were kids.

[04:43] The Mandalorian is something that families love your wife loves it Brenda loves the Mandalorian

[04:50] your kids love the Mandalorian everyone including the dog and the cats in your household loves

[04:55] the Mandalorian so this is the kind of theme where you don't have to get permission from

[05:00] your wife.

[05:01] You don't have to ask your kids if they want the Mandalorian everybody wants the Mandalorian

[05:06] and now if you're just a single dude who doesn't have a family then yet nothing really matters

[05:11] you can buy whatever you want but this is the kind of theme that's going to have the

[05:14] kind of mass appeal that Stern hasn't had in a while your wife doesn't want Elvira in

[05:21] the house you know that your kids don't care about Elvira your kids don't care about Batman

[05:25] 66 your wife doesn't care about Batman 66 and so here we have the perfect theme for pinball

[05:32] and you've all been asking for this right you want it more modern themes you want it

[05:37] more contemporary themes and now you have it and for those of you out there saying not

[05:41] another Star Wars pin well I hate to break it to you two billion Star Wars fans on planet

[05:47] earth there also hasn't been a great Star Wars pin so I don't get this whole like not

[05:53] another Star Wars pin that's like saying not another great movie not another music pin

[05:58] not another like comic book pin these are the things that millions and millions and billions

[06:03] of people love and then so what would you rather it be and when I hear some of these people

[06:08] throw out these themes like jaws let's talk about it for a minute jaws versus the Mandalorian

[06:14] if you're a business like Stern and you want to make millions off of each game and you

[06:19] want a game that when you put it on the line you're going to have it on the line for five years

[06:24] and sell thousands and thousands of thousands of them you really think jaws is what people want

[06:30] over the Mandalorian you're wrong because what pinside and the people there don't understand

[06:36] is the majority of these games are sold through distributors to their clientele who wants newer

[06:42] things it's not all of you old promotions now the old promotions are the ones who don't have as much

[06:49] of a life and they're the ones who are living on pinside and they're the ones who are the keyboard

[06:53] commandos but I'm here to tell you that's not who buys pinball machines that's not who the

[06:58] market is for pinball it is the modern family who is the market for this machine it is mostly

[07:04] probably men between the ages of 40 and 60 who have disposable income who are most likely married

[07:11] with children Stern's not stupid Stern knows their target audience they know who buys these things

[07:17] they know from their distributors who's buying these things it's not who you think it's not the

[07:23] lonely guy who travels to all the pinball shows it's someone who most likely has a family and

[07:28] disposable income and every once in a while when they stop catering to the like old promotions and

[07:36] they come out with a family friendly theme that millions and billions of people love it's amazing

[07:42] how so many people on pinside say this is a hard pass I'm not going to go in on this so I think I

[07:47] speak for the most of you out there that most of you are excited for the Mandalorian most of you

[07:53] probably listen to canada and got on the list for in Ellie and whether you want to take delivery or

[08:00] not I just gave you a few thousand dollars for free because this title is going to go up I think

[08:06] in value immediately because you're going to see how many people are going to want one now we

[08:11] don't know what the game is yet and you always say canady you're always hyping these things and

[08:16] driving the prices up and yes this is what marketing is all about if you do marketing successfully

[08:22] you will sell out on something before it's even revealed that's the greatest marketing of all time

[08:28] like if Stern said the next title is jaws like yeah like are they going to sell thousands of jaws

[08:34] on day one I don't know maybe I doubt it but they're going to sell three to four to five times as

[08:40] many Mandalorians as they would jaws pinball the other thing I hear from people is they say canada

[08:44] you're saying it's sold out every Ellie is sold out and that's not true every Ellie is sold

[08:50] through not out sold through means they're sold through two distributors yes Stern's 600 or 500

[08:59] Ellie's every time they make an Ellie those are spoken for those are allotted to distributors

[09:05] now what I mean by sell out is that a distributor won't have any on day one that they will have a

[09:11] list that is longer than their allotment and I think that's going to be the case everywhere you

[09:17] will be dialing all over the country trying to find a Mandalorian at sticker price when it comes

[09:24] to next Tuesday I hit Melissa up over at coin taker and I said how the phone lines these days and

[09:30] she's like they're blowing up right now and I told her you should have a separate phone line

[09:35] for all of your Ellie orders and it should go right to canada's cell phone and I should be like

[09:40] you like it the Ellie huh Ellie good Ellie sold out you ain't getting no Ellie okay you like it

[09:46] the Ellie huh you know because it's not gonna happen you're not gonna get one either you got on

[09:51] that list a while ago and for those of us in this hobby we knew for three weeks now he was Brian

[09:57] Eddie it was Mandalorian it's got an upper play field it's got Randy Martinez on art everything

[10:01] I've told you is going to come to fruition and is this how you win five twippies absolutely it's

[10:07] how you win five twippies in favorite pinball podcast because you know that the other shows out

[10:13] there that have relationships with Stern that know people over at Stern that are trying to get

[10:18] interviews with people over at Stern they would not have disclosed this information and that is why

[10:24] canada is the podcast for the people because I don't like it that a little boy's club gets to have

[10:31] all this information and they get to act on this information like there's people out there that know

[10:37] every new Stern coming out this year and they get to pass on stuff or buy stuff based on that

[10:43] information and my whole position is this why shouldn't you know this stuff I do find an Uber

[10:50] annoying that you have to guess on whether or not you should go in on that premium of Avengers

[10:54] or you should wait or this or that while other people have everything at their disposal and as

[11:00] soon as I get information that is valuable to you as a customer I will always pass it on to you

[11:07] because I don't like that other part where just a few people get to make decisions and then your

[11:12] money's at stake okay so let's talk about next week we are going to get the reveal may 11th which

[11:17] means Stern will do their distributor talk sometime on May 10th or May 11th in the morning I think in

[11:23] Europe or Australia they might get it to 10th because there are day ahead so we are going to see

[11:28] this game in a week I don't know about you but I'm super excited I'm expecting a lot from Brian

[11:33] Eddie I'm expecting a lot from this franchise it's got all the assets in it it's got the music it's

[11:39] got the clips will Gina be in the game we will see there's rumors she might be coming back for the

[11:45] third season I don't think this is a make a break on this game for some of you out there who are like

[11:49] if she's nodding and I'm not buying some of you people out there really you really get so bogged

[11:55] down in the weirdest issues in life and I think it's time to stop getting so upset about all this

[12:01] stuff and just enjoying this great show and this great content for what it is and stop turning

[12:08] everything into some political battle it's weird the world today we live in such a strange world

[12:14] where everything has to be politicized and that's why I don't even talk politics on this show

[12:19] I just want to talk about Pimball you know I've been seeing so much chatter with like dealt going

[12:23] on Zach show in all the drama around that and I'm like I do a Pimball podcast to talk about the

[12:28] Pimball machines and the Pimball companies there's way too much energy spent on talking about the

[12:34] personalities around the hobby that's not why you listen to these shows now I will put it out

[12:39] there so many people have been saying why doesn't Zach just talk to canada and why don't you

[12:44] to just do a show together and have a nice sort of like it's not even like a reconciliation just

[12:49] a Pimball chat and I will say this I have offered to Zach many over 50 times to do a show together

[12:56] and it's not me who's refusing to do it it's Zach and you can keep asking him and I don't know why

[13:02] he's wasting time with guys like dealt and making excruciating like hour long back and forth

[13:08] awkwardness with that guy when him and I could just get on and and bring Pimball together like that's

[13:13] what people want to see they want to see TPN and canada's Pimball podcast just hang out together and talk

[13:19] Pimball it wouldn't be a fight it wouldn't be awkward and it wouldn't be weird but it's again it's

[13:23] it's he doesn't want to do it so it did Zach I know you're listening the door is always open

[13:28] and the same is true with Christopher francey the door is always open for everyone just to get

[13:32] together and hang out and chat Pimball and if there's anything I want to see in 2021 I do want to

[13:38] see Zach and Greg host the Twitties and I do want to see everyone put the best people forward

[13:44] for the stuff that's celebrating Pimball and and I mean that and I get there's a lot of personal

[13:49] back and forth that people have but it's not worth it and let's get right back to Pimball now right

[13:53] you don't even want to hear this stuff you know part of being the Pimball podcaster for the people

[13:58] and and staying on topics that aren't necessarily the ones that these companies want you to stay on

[14:03] and and I do sort of linger around topics that haven't been resolved because I always hate to see

[14:11] what I saw this week and I hate to sort of feel like things just never get fixed and if there's

[14:16] one thing that people want to be fixed in this hobby it's the quality of playfields and I was on

[14:21] Pinside and I saw a Guns & Roses collector's edition owner sharing images of his GnR CE and around

[14:31] one of the posts it's not like just a little bit of where it's completely destroyed around one

[14:36] of his posts and the artwork has lifted off completely it even looks like the post has sunk

[14:42] an in to the playfield the whole thing looks terrible and he sends this picture of his $12,500

[14:48] Guns & Roses playfield to Jersey Jack customer support and the feedback he gets is that he will not

[14:55] be getting a playfield they're not sending out replacement playfields the owner is telling the

[15:00] community that the response he got from JJP customer support was that they would send him washers

[15:07] to cover up the where now this isn't just like a little bit of pooling where you're going to cover

[15:12] it up and try to prevent more pooling the artwork is gone this area is destroyed and this guy just

[15:18] spent $12,500 on a product and he says he played it 250 times and this is what it looks like now

[15:27] the question I have for Jersey Jack pinballing to all of you out there why are we still here how are

[15:33] we still here what was all that about with the quality assurance program at Mirko playfields maybe

[15:40] this was something where the game was built and over torqued that area of the post I don't know

[15:45] what the problem is that caused this it doesn't really matter right it doesn't really matter like

[15:51] shouldn't happen this guy didn't open up his game and sabotage his game he opened up his box

[15:58] and he played his pinball machine and after 250 plays he looked down at his brand new pinball

[16:05] machine and he saw that damage to it and the only conclusion I can come to is that that is defective

[16:13] and that should be taken care of and he should get more than just a washer sent to him after spending

[16:20] that much money now I know this is a headache for Jersey Jack pinball I know this is the reason why

[16:26] Jack Winari does not talk to canada anymore because I highlighted this problem with Willy Wonka I

[16:32] highlighted this problem with pirates of the Caribbean and so here we are again and there's another

[16:38] problem now how do you make it so that a hundred percent of these games are defective free and I

[16:44] don't think you can there's always going to be some play fields that probably have more issues

[16:50] than others and I'm hearing this in other companies too I hear it with people who own Elvira some

[16:55] people say their play field quality is great others have a lot of craters on their Elvira and

[17:00] here's the thing that all of us feel you shouldn't have to be one of the lucky ones you shouldn't have

[17:05] to feel like you dodged a bullet on your play field quality everyone you got a Rick and Morty got a

[17:11] really good high quality play field I'm not seeing any Rick and Morty quality control issues but

[17:17] what people really really want it's long overdue and I don't know why we're still having this

[17:23] conversation around play field quality especially over at Jersey Jack pinball I don't know why they're

[17:29] still using Mirko I really don't I don't know how many chances you're going to give Mirko how many

[17:35] times you're going to go up and down on this seesaw with them but clearly there's still problems

[17:41] happening and I don't know if we're going to see more problems happening I thought this problem

[17:44] was solved because I didn't hear from other CE owners with any play field issues so if you have

[17:50] a guns and roses collectors edition please do me a favor and look over your game and share your

[17:56] experience and tell us what's going on with your game don't be like these people who say you know

[18:01] just play your game and don't even think about it I don't think that's a solution because if we

[18:05] did that in everything in life and companies made products that were defective and instead of

[18:10] like forcing them to fix the problem we just became apathetic and just said live with it just play

[18:16] your game and live with it how is that a solution you're really just passing the problem on to the

[18:21] next buyers and for a lot of these guys who bought like GNR CE's this is the most expensive pinball

[18:27] machine they've ever purchased and they do deserve to have the best quality because they're spending

[18:32] the most amount of money someone on my Facebook page said well I wouldn't complain about it because

[18:38] they're making profit on their GNR CE's they're selling for 6000 over so even though he's got some

[18:44] damage on his play field he can make money on the game if he decides to sell it but again that's

[18:49] a non-secret or argument it doesn't matter I don't care if your pinball machine is $4,000 or

[18:56] $15,000 it shouldn't have a defective play field we shouldn't be compartmentalizing when it's okay

[19:04] to be upset about a defective play field every single new in box pinball customer deserves to open

[19:10] up that box and have a game that is quality that is built right you wouldn't accept it in anything

[19:16] else in life would you buy a watch with with the crystal scratch across the face would you buy a

[19:21] car with like a dent on the door no so you shouldn't have to buy a pinball machine and play it

[19:26] and then look down and the thing is falling apart when it comes to the play field but here's the

[19:31] thing that I still just cannot understand why is it that haggis pinball is the only pinball company

[19:36] right now truly trying to solve this problem with some innovation with some new method if you know

[19:44] that the majority of your buyers are home collectors and they want to keep their games mint and

[19:50] looking mint for as long as possible the haggis solution to play fields is the way to go now we don't

[19:56] know if it holds up over time and whatnot but I know this it's not going to dimple it's not going

[20:01] to lift the artwork it's not going to crack it's not going to have any of these issues that are

[20:06] frustrating buyers of these games lately so for all these companies out there it's like maybe stop

[20:11] innovating lights and maybe the first thing they should do is figure out a play field solution

[20:17] that works for everybody you know I don't know what to tell you now and this is me as someone who's

[20:21] like sitting with the guns and roses in a box and now I've got people telling me oh you should never

[20:26] open the box because you don't know what's going to be inside that box now I bought guns and roses

[20:31] to play it and to enjoy it it does make me nervous that over time a game that I know I'm going to

[20:36] want to keep in great condition might have issues the other thing I've just noticed and again if

[20:41] you're reading the threads when you buy something new in box and this is why stern pinball wins and

[20:46] this is why stern pinball is so successful and this is why when I had my stern pinball machine

[20:51] I wasn't tweaking much on it I when I had Batman I always say this I lifted the hood maybe once

[20:58] a year the game just worked every time I played it absolutely no issues I'm noticing more and more

[21:04] as more and more people get guns and roses and they get this game from Jersey Jack pinball the

[21:09] amount of tinkering that is required when you own a Jersey Jack pinball machine is far greater

[21:16] than if you own a stern machine it's far greater than if you own maybe an American pinball machine

[21:22] it's it's just a lot of work to keep these games going there's more in them there's more complexity

[21:27] this is why stern doesn't make their games so complex the more you put in the game that can have

[21:32] issues the more issues you will have but I almost think there needs to be like a warning and a

[21:38] disclaimer to people who are newbies to this hobby that Jersey Jack pinball machines are not

[21:45] user friendly if you're completely a neo fight to pinball you have to have a certain knowledge

[21:51] on how to work on a pinball machine to own a Jersey Jack machine it's just the way it is

[21:56] I saw someone on pinso I didn't even know how to change a slingshot rubber on a game really

[22:02] the guy thought he had to take half the game apart it's like dude just the two bolts over the plastic

[22:07] pop it up and it's in and that just goes to show it's like as more and more new people come into

[22:12] this hobby if their first experiences with a Jersey Jack game are they going to be able to like

[22:19] really want to tinker with it because I don't think a lot of people realize the amount of work

[22:23] it takes to keep some of these games running you know games like Pirates of the Caribbean I love that

[22:28] this game is now like so expensive because that game requires constant maintenance to keep it

[22:34] running and for the owners who have it and love it they don't mind working on it I mean a lot

[22:39] of people out there and I understand this they get a lot of satisfaction when they tinker with

[22:44] their games and they enjoy that part of it but I would argue that the majority of people who buy a

[22:49] pinball machine are not looking forward to problems they're not looking forward to having to fix

[22:55] and work on these games all the time it raises the age old question is were these things ever

[23:01] meant to be in homes right because these things were originally supposed to be on location and in

[23:06] the hands of operators who didn't mind lifting the glass and fixing them all the time and so as the

[23:12] home collector becomes the primary audience having games that don't break down is key Stern games

[23:19] require the least amount of daily maintenance they just do that's why Stern games are so successful

[23:25] with the amount of titles they sell you'd see so many more issue threads popping up if their games

[23:30] were problematic you know the last thing I want to talk about on this episode and again we're all

[23:34] just waiting to see Mandalorian we're in that little bit of like the calm before the storm and we're

[23:38] going to have a lot to talk about next week the last thing I want to talk about is is there a

[23:43] scarcity or is there a surplus of pinball right now and it's an interesting question because I

[23:49] hear people say like there's such a surplus of games that there's almost too much out there and

[23:54] people now are at a room and they have to move stuff out if they want to move stuff in but then you

[23:59] get people who say but there's really not if you think about it while there might be a surplus

[24:05] of pinball companies that are out there and there there are a surplus of pinball companies right you

[24:10] got Stern Jersey Jack P3 multi-morphic American pinball spooky pinball Chicago gaming company deep

[24:18] root I'm just counting these on my hand right now I'm gonna miss some right now you got home pin I'm

[24:22] at eight already who else is there I'm missing some big ones right now I know I am I'm sorry but

[24:27] we have like I in that chart I put up there's like 10 pinball companies right now that are

[24:31] making games get the pony pinball factory and so while there might be a lot of companies that are

[24:37] out there who are currently trying to make pinball machines the reason why there hasn't been a

[24:43] new release in 2021 yet is simply this the majority of pinball companies just can't execute very

[24:51] efficiently in fact they're very very inefficient the majority of pinball companies out there in the

[24:57] world can't even release one new game a year okay let me repeat that now one new game a year only

[25:06] one company in the entire world of pinball can make at least one game a year and you know who it is

[25:13] it's Stern Jersey Jack cannot make more than one game a year spooky pinball not more than one

[25:20] game a year Chicago gaming company hasn't made a new game in two years and they're not even making

[25:24] new games they're remaking games deep root pinball can't get one title out after five years of R&D

[25:32] p3 multi morphing maybe a new game a year but you know it's not a entirely new pinball machine

[25:38] and so you have this thing we're like there's just not a lot of new games available if you want it

[25:45] to buy a new game new in box today right pinball brothers they're still making a game from five

[25:50] years ago same thing with Dutch pinball there aren't a lot of new games American pinball let's talk

[25:56] about American pinball who can't even make a new game every year who now came out in December and

[26:02] said they're gonna do two new games a year David fix and American pinball we would be happy with

[26:08] just one new pinball machine a year it doesn't even have to be two but where's their game see

[26:14] this is the problem with pinball right now is that you have all these companies and yet nothing

[26:19] is available that's new and only stern pinball every three to four months has a new title for you

[26:25] to chew on for you to consider and for you to buy and then what happens is this this is why all

[26:30] these other companies their marketing is all over the place because if you're one of them you want

[26:36] to make sure that your title launches during a window that's not near a new stern release i mean how

[26:43] comical is it gonna be when stern reveals the mandalorian to us next week and that is the same

[26:49] week that Robert Mueller owes us all an update on where raza development is at i mean how comical

[26:56] is it gonna be and there's no way he's gonna announce that the game is around the line there's

[27:01] no way and i saw people are starting to get hopeful because there's new job listings happening at

[27:06] deeproot job listings how are they still looking to hire people after five years i don't understand

[27:14] how these are good signs to people all it means is there's more money being burned and burned and

[27:21] burned for 130 games it makes no sense the math does not add up we are really in a weird industry

[27:29] the promise of boutique pinball and the promise of competitors to stern it's never really worked out

[27:36] it really hasn't for the most part when you think about it let me ask you a question like this

[27:41] when was the last time you got a masterpiece pinball machine from someone that wasn't stern or

[27:48] jersey jack pinball i mean a masterpiece machine all these other companies making pinball machines

[27:53] all these years and i would argue that jersey jack's masterpiece is guns and roses and other than that

[28:00] i don't really think they have a masterpiece other than g and r the other ones are good but for many

[28:05] reasons a lot of us didn't buy the other ones but think about all these other companies and when

[28:10] was the last time with all this knowledge right all this knowledge of what made games great in the 90s

[28:16] all this knowledge of the best machines of all time like these people who make these games today

[28:22] like everyone who's making these pinball machines they get access to medieval madness they get

[28:27] access to like monster bash they get access to lord the rings you could go down a list of the top

[28:32] 20 games of all time why would you ever start making a pinball company why would you ever start

[28:38] making a pinball machine if your goal was to not make a game as good as or better than those top

[28:47] 20 games i don't understand why people can't do this i i really don't and i don't understand why

[28:54] we have all this pinball but majority of it the majority of it is pretty mediocre and nobody ever

[29:00] wants to say that nobody ever wants to articulate that we always have to just cheerlead all these

[29:06] companies and everything they're doing is great and every new machine is great but that's the point

[29:10] i will never understand and the marketer in me is so confused by you know what people love

[29:16] you know of the most popular games are of all time why can't we continue to hit at that bar

[29:22] or raise that bar and it's there and look jersey jack is in that top 20 stern is in that top 20

[29:29] but everybody else i think it's all like stern jersey jack and bali Williams i mean let me go to

[29:34] the pin side top 20 right now and let's see if anyone else has broken into that list all right i'll

[29:39] just do real quick and then we're gonna end this show medieval madness bali Williams guns are

[29:43] ones is jersey jack pinball monster bash bali Williams pire to the carabin jersey jack pinball attack

[29:48] from ours bali Williams Jurassic Park stern Deadpool stern iron maiden stern alvirus stern twilight

[29:56] zone bali Williams metallica stern avengers infinity quest stern lord of the ring stern

[30:02] in an adjones bali Williams ninja turtles stern how did that get on there start trick stern

[30:08] the admis family bali Williams the big libowski number 18 okay finally dutch pinball yes and i

[30:14] actually think dutch pinball deserves to be on there and i've said it before i think dutch pinball

[30:19] is the only only company that came out and started something that aimed high and i think they

[30:26] deserve to be there on that list acdc stern and willy wanca with jersey jack pinball okay and i will

[30:32] say just missing this list at number 21 is rick and morty so spooky you got really really close to

[30:39] being in the top 20 but my point is i don't really care about quantity i don't really care about

[30:46] getting like five to fifteen games every two years i just think every single pinball company

[30:52] especially you small guys who can focus on just one machine at a time can you imagine if stern put

[30:58] all of their energy into one machine at a time for you other companies out there it's like

[31:04] either make a masterpiece or go home i just don't get why these companies are still struggling

[31:10] to give people what they want and i know it's harder and harder and it's more expensive to give

[31:15] people what they want because licensing costs are expensive and you can't really compete with stern

[31:19] in their relationships with all the license holders but that doesn't matter that doesn't matter

[31:24] like i'm really curious to see how fathom sells which it's selling okay because it's a remake of

[31:29] a game people love but i'm really curious to see how haggis's original title does i'm really

[31:36] really curious to see what chicago gaming company does after cactus canyon remake and the most

[31:42] thing i'm curious about and i bet this guy every night has trouble sleeping because he's like oh my

[31:46] god canate is going to make fun of our new game the company who i have the most expectation for

[31:52] moving forward because they talked such a big game is american pinball where is american pinball's

[31:59] next game that will be the one that finally wows us and after everything david fix said i'm expecting

[32:07] big things and i hope they deliver on it but i think they've put themselves on a pedestal

[32:13] that they haven't quite achieved yet and we'll see if they can do it but i just want the game i

[32:18] don't you know what i'm saying it's like i don't need to make fun of david fix and and michael

[32:21] grant and the team over there i don't need to i don't need to analyze the people i don't care

[32:26] about the people i don't care about the who's who's the personnel i don't care about what he said in

[32:30] December all i care about is the game like where's the game this podcast is more entertaining when

[32:37] we can talk about the games and that's the thing about all the other stuff in this pinball hobby

[32:42] right now we have like five months of no new games and yet it's the same conversation over and

[32:48] over and over again it starts to get a little bit boring right i don't know about you but it gets

[32:54] a little bit boring when we don't have new product and we're just like oh we're just going in

[32:59] circles we're like you know it's like shows talking about shows talking about shows and it's more

[33:04] exciting to buy dogecoin and watch a go up to 69 cents yesterday which is crazy crazy i don't

[33:11] even understand any of this stuff anymore but anyway i've got to go good morning everybody this has

[33:15] been episode 577 of canadus pinball podcast get ready for a lot of mandalorian conversation coming

[33:21] soon peace
