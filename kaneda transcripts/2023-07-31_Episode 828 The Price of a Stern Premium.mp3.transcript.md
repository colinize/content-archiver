[00:00] Cause I'm just kid, anywhere else I be, take.

[00:05] Is it my destiny to live and die, a life of blood for jeopardy?

[00:30] How much is a Stern machine cost to a distributor?

[00:35] Now look, I opened this up on Patreon.

[00:37] A lot of you made a lot of guesses.

[00:39] How much money does it cost a distributor to buy a Stern premium?

[00:45] We're gonna talk about that on this episode, but before I give you the number, this is not new.

[00:50] All of us know that distributors are making some money on top of what Stern is charging them for a game.

[00:57] There's nothing going on this way since the dawn of the distribution model.

[01:01] Now Stern likes this model.

[01:03] This model is not going away.

[01:05] Anyone who's saying rumors that Stern might sell games directly, guess what?

[01:10] They already sell games directly.

[01:13] They already sell accessories directly.

[01:15] You can also get a cutting board from Stern Pimball because it's a lifestyle brand.

[01:20] There's no way Stern Pimball is gonna turn over its super successful business model

[01:25] and then want to deal with thousands of customers.

[01:29] That's why they use distributors because they don't want to deal with the headaches

[01:35] of a very complex electromechanical device that they sell thousands of around the world.

[01:41] They simply let the distributors handle all of the incoming calls of anyone who has an issue with their product.

[01:48] It's super smart.

[01:49] It's not going away.

[01:51] Even though Stern is ramping up a new factory in August,

[01:54] the majority of that factory that they're ramping up is gonna go into the most important part of their business,

[02:00] which is manufacturing.

[02:02] We're gonna talk about manufacturing and what's gonna happen when Stern increases its capacity

[02:08] because increasing capacity is something you normally do to meet demand.

[02:13] Look, it's a really tricky move in the world of business

[02:16] because sometimes you can increase your capacity to fill demand that is no longer there.

[02:22] And I think everyone's starting to wonder, no one knows for sure, but we're all starting to wonder,

[02:27] is the demand to buy Pimball machines in 2023 as strong as it was in 2021 when we were heading into COVID?

[02:36] And COVID created a little bit of a bubble of people's demand for items like this that went into your home

[02:43] because we were all home and we were all bored and we didn't lose our money

[02:48] and the recession didn't really hit, but coming out of it now, as I was saying on my last show,

[02:53] inflation is real.

[02:55] Higher interest rates are real.

[02:57] Everywhere you go, it's not just Pimball machines.

[02:59] Everywhere you go, you're getting hit with a higher dollar amount.

[03:03] I mean, I went to the grocery store with Brenda today.

[03:05] We just got like four items, four or five items, 50 bucks, 50 bucks for a couple pieces of fish

[03:11] and some bread and some muffins for Killian, $50.

[03:14] It's crazy how much everything costs, but obviously food is more important than Pimball, so we got it.

[03:21] So here's what I want everybody to do as you listen to this show.

[03:24] I want you all to keep in mind a few things.

[03:26] Nobody's making you buy any games.

[03:29] You shouldn't get really, really angry in Pimball because the way I look at Pimball nowadays,

[03:34] it's real simple.

[03:35] I'm actually at peace with the entire hobby.

[03:37] Do I think the prices are high?

[03:39] Yes.

[03:40] Do I like these high prices?

[03:42] No.

[03:43] Am I going to stop buying Pimball machines?

[03:45] No.

[03:46] I will buy again, but at these prices, it's real simple.

[03:50] You're only going to buy a game if it checks all of the boxes that you want in a Pimball machine.

[03:56] And the most important box is usually the theme itself.

[04:00] Like we really need to see some great themes for this much money.

[04:04] And I think what we're all experiencing is not the death of FOMO.

[04:08] I just think we're experiencing two years of somewhat lackluster themes in Pimball.

[04:14] And so we've had two years of lackluster themes and we've had the prices go through the roof.

[04:19] And we've also had the capacity increase.

[04:22] Remember Stern used to make only 500 LEs.

[04:25] And then they would be very selective when they would make more than 500 based on the demand for the game.

[04:32] And it's really surprising to me.

[04:34] With a game like Venom, they're still going to make 1,000 Venoms at $13,000.

[04:39] Did they even make 1,000 Star Wars?

[04:42] Did they even make 1,000 Stranger Things?

[04:44] No, they didn't even make close to 1,000 Stranger Things.

[04:47] I think Stranger Things was another of like 5 or 600 and that was it.

[04:50] Which is a much more popular theme than Venom.

[04:53] And so that's happening in the marketplace right now.

[04:56] The capacity of games has gone up and the price has gone up and the theme has been somewhat mediocre.

[05:02] Okay, so I'm not telling you anything new.

[05:04] So let's talk about if I'm a distributor and I want to order a premium from Stern,

[05:10] guess how much money, guess how much money I need to spend to get that game into my inventory.

[05:16] I saw a lot of ranges.

[05:18] Everything from like 6,500.

[05:20] You people are crazy that said 6,500 all the way up to almost $9,000.

[05:25] It's not that low and it's not that high.

[05:27] Here's what I'm hearing.

[05:28] It costs a distributor who wants to buy a premium.

[05:31] It is right on the nail.

[05:33] Maybe give or take a hundred bucks, but $8,000 is a distributor's cost for a premium.

[05:39] Now, a premium right now from Stern on its website is $9,799.

[05:46] So just looking at those two numbers, there is a ballpark of $1,800 to be made from a distributor

[05:53] if he can find buyers for that much, if he can find a buyer at $9,800.

[05:59] Here is the lowest map price a dealer can sell the game for though.

[06:03] Are you ready for it?

[06:04] The lowest map price that a dealer can sell a game for, a premium game, is $9,500.

[06:12] And you will see dealers actually list a premium machines for $9,499.

[06:19] So there you have it.

[06:20] This doesn't make me mad.

[06:21] This isn't anything brand new.

[06:23] We knew dealers were making margins on all of these games.

[06:25] If they're making roughly $1,500 on every premium, how much do you think they're making on every LE?

[06:32] If I was a guessing man, I would probably say somewhere between $2,000 and $2,500 on every LE sold.

[06:39] It's not a terrible business to be in, but as we've seen lately, it's a lot harder for these dealers to sell these games at $9,800.

[06:48] It's a lot harder to find $13,000 LE buyers if the theme is something like Venom.

[06:54] So if Stern is asking $8,000, here's a question for everybody out there.

[06:58] How much do you think it costs Stern to actually make a pinball machine?

[07:03] What's the cost to Stern pinball?

[07:05] I don't know this answer.

[07:07] Typically, a manufacturing company wants to be somewhere around 50%.

[07:12] The cost to them will be somewhat like 50% less than what they sell the product for.

[07:18] So do you think a Stern bomb on a game is around $4,000?

[07:22] I think it might be a little bit higher than that.

[07:24] Let's just say hypothetically, a Stern bomb on a premium is $5,000.

[07:29] So you're telling me, if you buy an LE of that game and the bomb on an LE is not really that much higher than a premium,

[07:36] I think that's what's creating some more pause in people.

[07:40] You're spending $8,000 more on the product than the product itself costs to make.

[07:45] And there's no way to cut out the middleman, right?

[07:48] You can't really cut out the middleman.

[07:50] You got to buy from the distro.

[07:52] You know, when Stern sells you the game directly, they're not selling it to you for $8,000.

[07:56] Now, how many of you out there who can work on your games?

[07:59] How many of you out there who wouldn't call the distributor if you had an issue because you would try to fix it yourself?

[08:04] How many of you out there would rather just spend $8,000 on a premium?

[08:08] Just spend $10,000 on an LE.

[08:11] It's never going to happen.

[08:12] I still think we do need distributors in pinball because as I was saying earlier,

[08:16] a lot of stuff can happen with these games and these companies are not equipped internally

[08:21] to handle thousands of customers all over the globe.

[08:25] But the price discussion is an interesting one.

[08:27] And for each and every one of us, as I was saying on my last episode, it's up to you.

[08:31] You need to be able to see the value in a game.

[08:34] Like if Top Gun came out tomorrow, that would instantly catapult me into I have to own this game.

[08:41] If Akira came out, I would buy it.

[08:44] If it was $20,000 for an LE of Akira, I would buy it.

[08:49] I wouldn't even think twice about it.

[08:51] And that's where we're at.

[08:53] So for people saying like FOMO is dead, it's not dead.

[08:56] It's just dead on themes that you have no FOMO for.

[08:59] And guess what?

[09:00] That's a good thing.

[09:01] You shouldn't be buying every game.

[09:03] You shouldn't be buying these 400-pound devices just to dabble on them because you're curious about a new game.

[09:10] Those days are over.

[09:12] Those days are dead.

[09:13] You could do that four or five years ago.

[09:15] You can't do that anymore.

[09:17] And there's nothing wrong with that because there are hundreds of thousands of pinball machines out in the world.

[09:23] You can find something that works for you.

[09:26] You don't only have to buy new in-box.

[09:28] All right.

[09:29] So speaking of new in-box, let's talk a little bit about the industry.

[09:32] New in-box, where are the Godfather CEs?

[09:35] Does anybody have this game in America?

[09:37] I'm waiting for these things to be in box.

[09:39] I really am.

[09:40] I'm not saying it facetiously.

[09:41] I just want to see where all the Godfather CEs are.

[09:44] This game was revealed in March, April, May, June, July, August.

[09:50] We're now five months since the game was revealed.

[09:53] Almost half a year, Jersey Jack is making its most expensive buyers wait for the game.

[09:59] I just want to see it in box.

[10:01] I saw like one unboxed, but surely there must be truckloads of Godfather CEs on their way to people this week in August.

[10:08] Because I just want to see what people think of the game who own it.

[10:12] Now, we all know like if you spend $15,000 on this game, you're going to say it's great.

[10:17] You're going to say it's awesome.

[10:18] It's got that just one more game feel.

[10:21] And then two weeks later, when you list it, you're going to list that pin side post.

[10:25] Like I'm really sad to see this go, but I got a free up room.

[10:28] We know you're lying.

[10:29] We know you're lying.

[10:30] Just sell the game.

[10:32] Don't give us your sob story.

[10:33] Don't say you're sad to see it go.

[10:36] Just put it up for sale and shut up and take someone's money.

[10:40] 

[10:40] So where are the Godfathers?

[10:41] We're waiting on those CEs.

[10:43] Where are these galactic tank force signature editions for $17,500?

[10:49] You would think that American pinball would make those versions first.

[10:53] Like lock in as many of those $17,500 orders as you possibly can.

[10:59] And then you'd want those people to do your first unboxings and say, hey, look how beautiful it is.

[11:04] Look at the 3D Translight.

[11:05] You know, people putting whiskey in their thermoses and getting drunk because you're going to have to put whiskey in your thermos and chug it to just get over the fact that you just bought a $17,500 tank force.

[11:15] But where are they?

[11:16] No thermoses.

[11:17] When are we going to see the galactic tank force thermoses?

[11:20] I hope we see them before September, but it's a slow burn.

[11:23] And now the rumors out there that American pinball has He-Man.

[11:27] They most likely have the He-Man license.

[11:29] And now that people know this, even if you're not a huge fan of He-Man, I can tell you that.

[11:34] To He-Man, I can tell you to 100% certainty there is a much larger audience of He-Man fans out there than galactic tank force fans.

[11:44] It's just not going to have the orders rolling in, especially now that distributors have to really decide like how many Venoms do I order?

[11:52] How many tank forces?

[11:53] How many Godfathers?

[11:54] If you're a distributor and you carry all of these companies, the safest bet is going to be the Stern machine.

[12:01] Now, speaking of Venom, even though customers are not going to get this game for about two months, we saw a lot of people play the game at Southern Fried Gaming Expo this past weekend.

[12:11] And I was reading the pinside thread.

[12:13] It's really hard reading people's feedback.

[12:15] Here's what's interesting.

[12:16] If someone doesn't like the game and you just put up an honest review, I play the game and I don't like it, you'll get downvoted or very few people will upvote you.

[12:26] If you jump on any new machine and say it's amazing, you'll get 20 upvotes immediately.

[12:31] And that's good.

[12:32] You know, look, I get it.

[12:33] We're in pinball.

[12:34] People want to have fun.

[12:35] They want to hear people say positive stuff about the game.

[12:37] But after reading everybody's reviews, I would say it's a mixed bag.

[12:41] I think some people like it.

[12:43] I think some people love the speed of the game.

[12:45] I don't think anyone really knows what's going on in the game from a code perspective.

[12:49] And that's just because it's at a show.

[12:51] When you play a pinball machine at a show, you have no idea what's going.

[12:54] You're just flipping.

[12:55] You're getting a sense of the gameplay.

[12:57] You're getting a sense of the lights, of the artwork, of the music, of the callouts.

[13:01] But you can't really follow and immerse yourself in a pinball machine at a show.

[13:06] It's a mixed bag review.

[13:07] Some people are saying the pro is really barren and embarrassing.

[13:11] Even though the premium has a lot more mechs, I'm also not hearing from people that the mechs do a lot.

[13:16] The one mech I keep hearing people call out the most is also in the pro.

[13:20] It's those ball lock that releases the balls super quickly.

[13:23] So it actually creates faster gameplay if the ball was just going up the ramp and around the wire forms.

[13:29] That's the one thing I hear everybody talking about.

[13:31] You don't hear people talking about the doppelganger.

[13:34] You don't hear people talking about the lab.

[13:36] You don't really hear people talking about the other stuff because none of the other mechs are really that impressive.

[13:43] It seems to be a game about speed, about speed, and about speed.

[13:47] But I think for a lot of you out there who maybe have a Foo Fighters or have an Avengers, do you really need this?

[13:53] I think that's the verdict on Venom.

[13:55] I think what's happening right now too is people are taking their feelings on Venom and they're projecting it across the entire pinball landscape.

[14:03] People saying like FOMO's dead, like no one's going to buy up these prices.

[14:07] It's not true. It's just Venom.

[14:09] When Jaws comes out and Jaws Super LE comes out, watch people fight over each other to get a $25,000 version of Jaws.

[14:16] It's going to happen.

[14:17] And I'm just going to sit back, smoke a cigar, and say I told you so.

[14:20] So what else is happening in the pinball world right now?

[14:23] Something else I was thinking about is Pulp Fiction Hype going to be able to last this long?

[14:27] Is it going to be old news by the time the game comes out?

[14:31] My worry about Pulp Fiction is this.

[14:33] It's real simple. It's the same worry I have with Elton John.

[14:36] It's the same worry I have with everybody else planning something at the end of the year.

[14:40] When Keith Elwin releases a game, it is like a black hole.

[14:43] It is a black hole, a pinball enthusiasm.

[14:46] It will create a gravitational pull that will suck everything towards his pin.

[14:51] So if you're planning on releasing a game anytime near a Keith Elwin pin, good luck. Good luck.

[14:57] It's not going to work out for you.

[14:59] If I was a marketer sitting in a pinball company's office, and we were thinking about when to release a game,

[15:04] I don't want to release a game anywhere near a Keith Elwin machine.

[15:07] It's the same way like in the movie industry, right?

[15:10] It's like when Tom Cruise puts out a movie, he has so much power at the box office

[15:15] where if your movie comes out on top of his, you're probably not going to do too well.

[15:20] Unless you're Barbie. I saw Barbie. It was good. I saw Barbie. It was good. I did enjoy it.

[15:25] It is a 90-minute modern feminism speech.

[15:28] But you know what? So what? It didn't offend me.

[15:30] Even though they treat men like they're these troglodytes, I think it's just, you know,

[15:34] it's just making up for all the times we've treated women horribly.

[15:37] Look, I'm just going to say it again. If they made a Barbie pinball machine, it would crush.

[15:41] Barbie pinball would sell more than Venom. It would sell more than Galactic Tank Force.

[15:45] It would sell more than the Godfather. It would sell more than Foo Fighters.

[15:49] Trust me on this. Every single family where there's a woman who has some control over that family

[15:55] and there's pinball machines in the home, and you're telling me there's a Barbie pinball machine,

[16:00] we're getting it.

[16:01] So getting back to Pulp Fiction, it's going to come out.

[16:04] They're going to ship this game, this single-level game with like six songs and not a ton of mechs.

[16:10] It's a super cool pin. I understand why it's sold out because the theme is amazing.

[16:15] But it's going to come out right when Jaws comes out.

[16:19] The Ellie is going to be made right when they're making Jaws.

[16:22] I don't know, right? And that's the other thing too now.

[16:24] It's just harder to buy two machines on top of each other.

[16:27] Most of us, if we buy a pinball machine, right, we want to buy a dream theme.

[16:31] We're going to spend the money. We want to spend it.

[16:33] But we don't want to spend it too often now because now you really, really, really have to dive into that piggy bank.

[16:39] So August is going to be a little bit of a down month and then things are really going to pick up in the fall.

[16:45] I think by the end of the year, we're going to see a new game from Jersey Jack.

[16:49] We're going to see Padready Gaming.

[16:50] I think they're going to announce they're remaking Big Bang Bar at Chicago Expo.

[16:55] We're not going to see a new game from Spooky just yet.

[16:58] It's probably going to be Looney Tunes.

[17:00] Bugs said they have three licensed games that they're working on.

[17:03] I think it's going to be Looney Tunes.

[17:05] I think it's going to be The Princess Bride.

[17:07] And I think it's going to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[17:10] Okay?

[17:11] You know, and that's really it.

[17:12] I also heard that Chicago Gaming Company might be done with remakes.

[17:16] So they are going to start doing more original titles.

[17:19] It doesn't mean they're not going to do licensed games,

[17:21] but they're not going to be remaking the old Bowdy Williams games.

[17:25] I think there's been a falling out between CGC and Rick over at Planetary.

[17:30] And that's why I think you're going to see Rick and Planetary team up with like Padready Gaming

[17:34] and anyone else who has manufacturing.

[17:37] Now let me end this show with another rumor I'm hearing.

[17:39] And this is a good one.

[17:41] This theme has been rumored forever.

[17:43] It's The Matrix.

[17:44] Now look, I hear that Jersey Jack does not have The Matrix.

[17:48] The same way they probably don't have Harry Potter.

[17:51] I hear The Matrix is the next game from Dutch Pimbal.

[17:54] I'm really feeling good about it.

[17:56] Roger Sharp is working with Dutch Pimbal.

[17:58] A Dutch Pimbal The Matrix.

[18:01] See, this is the thing.

[18:02] If Barry just announced he had it now, I mean, think about that.

[18:06] I mean, he won't do it.

[18:07] But if Barry said we have The Matrix and it's next and he said, look,

[18:12] you could spend $13,000 on these empty Stern LEs.

[18:16] You could spend $15,000 on a Jersey Jack machine.

[18:20] But if I were you, I would wait until you see what we're doing

[18:25] with The Matrix.

[18:27] If he said that now and he said, look, it's going to take us a little

[18:30] over a year to get the game out.

[18:32] We really hope everybody loves their big Lebowski's,

[18:35] but we're going to take it up even another level with The Matrix.

[18:38] That would make me pause.

[18:39] That would make me wait and see.

[18:41] Just knowing that it's out there, a dream theme is being made by a company

[18:46] that has really been the only company that's brought the Baldy Williams

[18:50] magic back in modern times.

[18:52] I mean, come on, people, look at that game.

[18:54] Look at what's in that game.

[18:56] It's embarrassing if you put a big Lebowski for $13,000 next to a Venom for $13,000.

[19:04] Oh, but Chris, it doesn't have role-playing game code

[19:07] and you can't continue where you left off with your Stern Insider connected

[19:12] and they're not selling you lifestyle apparel.

[19:14] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[19:17] I think today or tomorrow you're going to get your little bill for

[19:20] Canada's pinball podcast.

[19:21] I mean it when I say it.

[19:22] I'm so happy for all of your support.

[19:24] I'm so happy to have you here.

[19:26] We're going to keep doing great podcasts every week.

[19:29] We're going to keep doing Saturday morning spectacular.

[19:32] If you caught the last one, it was fire.

[19:34] It was fire.

[19:35] We still can't get Jenga's back.

[19:37] He's still holding out.

[19:39] We're going to get him.

[19:40] We're going to get him.

[19:41] I'm like John Cusack holding up the boom box.

[19:43] We're going to get that guy back into the mix.

[19:45] Later, everybody.

[20:13] Thank you.
