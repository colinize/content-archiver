[00:00] Moonlight on the waves, her kiss in the dawn, a smile on her face, when she'd make me break out of my guitar and play.

[00:11] Hold my hand, hold my hand.

[00:20] C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

[00:50] There's a new rumor out there that some people are saying it's not episode 1 through 3. It is in fact the original trilogy we grew up with.

[01:00] It is a new hope, return of the Jedi, and Empire Strikes Back. I got the order wrong right there. It is new hope, Empire Strikes Back, and return of the Jedi.

[01:10] And so would Stern do that? We're gonna talk about that, because that would be, in the history of Stern moves, that would be the biggest burn ever. Ever.

[01:23] Because they sold more Star Wars than anything else. We're gonna talk about that. We're gonna talk about what's going on in Harry Potter World.

[01:32] We're gonna talk about what's going on in the pinball world. And then we're gonna just go on pinside and see what are people trying to sell for $14,000 or more.

[01:43] And let's ask ourselves, are these good prices or crack pipe prices? Alright, let's get right into it. So Jaws 50th is out.

[01:54] I think people are sort of like a little lukewarm on it. If you were waiting on a Jaws premium, of course you're gonna order this version of the game.

[02:04] I think it has some things people like. The new playfield, the glitter, all that stuff is good. The new wire forms and the new code is amazing.

[02:13] So Jaws is a game now, where you can see the final wizard mode in about 20 minutes. I love it when people are still like, I hope Keith stays true to his promise and puts another sort of like super duper wizard mode.

[02:28] If you complete everything in the game. Let me tell you right now, how many of you will ever be able to complete everything in that game?

[02:38] Start every single mode and then get to some super duper wizard mode. Like nobody, nobody. So why should Stern take resources away from other games and go code in something that nobody is ever going to see?

[02:57] I know he might have said that, but this game's been out for a year and a half. He's got King Kong out that is not selling crazy well.

[03:07] And so where do you think Stern is going to apply its resources to Jaws? A game that's already sold pretty well for Stern and has been out for a year and a half and now they're making all this new money on the 50th.

[03:20] They're not going to go back. I doubt it. Maybe they will. I don't know. Like Lyman sheets used to go back years later and put more stuff into a game. So who knows, but that's not going to make or break this game for anybody.

[03:33] Now, I still think Stern went a little cheap on the overall presentation of this game. I think when they're highlighting stuff like stickers, they've run out of stuff to talk about.

[03:45] I think it looks okay. I think in person it's going to look better. I hope Mike at Automated gets one real soon. I will go over there and play this game and report what Jaws 50th looks like in real life.

[03:58] I wish the premiums got the inner art blades. It's the one thing. It's like, why? Why can't we get inner art blades? Well, you know the answer.

[04:06] Stern wants you to spend another like 200 bucks on something that costs them $20. But at these prices, I think everyone is just over having to like buy more stuff when you're already spending like $10,000.

[04:20] When I put up a little survey saying what's the number one thing that is keeping you from buying new and box games and the number one answer with over 40 something percent was price fatigue.

[04:33] So you guys are just over these high prices. And then the second place answer was you're just tired of seeing the second hand appreciation of all of these games.

[04:44] So the games are too expensive to buy new and box. And then if you do buy them new and box, you're tired of losing so much money.

[04:52] Welcome to modern pinball. And I don't blame you for waiting. It's the smart thing to do.

[04:57] All right, so Jaws 50th now, King Kong is not going to have a second life. Jaws 50th is out. Now everyone's waiting for the next game.

[05:07] It's going to be a John Borg Star Wars game. Now I've been saying it is episode one through three, which makes sense.

[05:15] There never was a good episode one through three pinball machine. There was a phantom menace machine on pinball 2000 or 3000.

[05:24] I forget what the damn thing is called right now. The John Papa Duke game. But now I'm hearing that Stern pinball knowing they need a big hit might be making Star Wars episodes four, five and six.

[05:38] The original trilogy. Here's the problem. They already made that game. They made that game with Steve Ritchie. The other problem is they sold.

[05:47] I heard they sold about 8000 units of that Star Wars game. So really interesting question here because everybody out there knows that they had all the assets for that game.

[06:02] And Ritchie made a total dog. It is a total miss creatively underneath that glass. The tie fighter on the spring. Why is the hyper drive the main mech in that game? Where's the ad at?

[06:18] Where's the sensation of shooting the ball into the desk? I mean, think about how stupid this is. How easy it would have been to have a real death star opening in which the ball could go into it.

[06:31] And you get one freaking shot and all the lights on the machine turn off and you have to use the force to put the ball and you get one shot to do it. I don't understand, right?

[06:44] There's no sensation of the force. There's no magnets in Star Wars. There's no lightsabers clashing. Everything in that game. That little LCD screen is so lazy and you're just slapping the action button to kill tie fighters.

[07:00] The whole game, I believe creatively is a disaster and yet they had all the assets, the theme song, all the clips and then Dwight goes and destroys the code by stacking all the movies on top of themselves.

[07:15] What you do not feel in that Star Wars game, you do not feel like you are going through the movies and it should be when you start a game, it should be like you select the movie you want to play first.

[07:30] The way Evil Dead is Evil Dead 1 or 2. I should select a new hope and go through that storyline. If there ever was a movie and a trilogy where fans want to go through the journey in a linear fashion, it is freaking Star Wars.

[07:49] You can't chop it up. The whole point of that story only unfolds in the right way if you tell it in a linear fashion. And for those of you who say, well, pinball is not a linear game and it's going to get boring going on a linear journey.

[08:05] No, it's not. Yeah, some movies that might be the case, but I'll tell you one where it's not the case. Star Wars. You don't mess with perfection. And those three movies are about as perfect as it gets.

[08:19] And also we know that Stern pinball is not a fan of Steve Ritchie. So they don't mind burning him. It would be much more commercially successful to do the original trilogy versus the prequels.

[08:32] But man, this would be the biggest burn in the history of Stern. Because if they did this, 8,000 owners, I can just hear Obi-Wan right now. I just felt a major disturbance in the pinball force as if 8,000 pinball owners cried out in pain.

[08:51] I mean, that's what it would be like because anyone who owns an original, anyone who owns the Ritchie pinball machine would be kicking themselves and want to get out. And Stern's never done this before. They haven't. They've never remade a title that they made previously like this.

[09:09] I haven't seen them ever do it. They never made another Lord of the Rings. They never made another Tron. They've never really done this. And so we're going to see this real soon. We're going to see this in the next couple of months.

[09:24] So I don't know. I still think it's going to be episode one through three because I don't think Stern's going to want to burn all those 8,000 people who own those other Star Wars machines. I do know this. If you own a Star Wars right now, you might be thinking about listing it for sale.

[09:45] Because you could always get it back for what you're going to get for it right now, but you better hurry up. I love watching when there's a rumor about something coming back. You see all of a sudden these games go up for sale.

[09:59] When we knew that Metallica was coming back, remember that like guys were trying to get 18,000 for their old Metallica LEDs. Then it was like 16 firm. And then it's all the way down now to like 10 or $11,000 for those original Metallica LEDs.

[10:17] You got to play the market. And I love it when people are like, why don't care? I had my years of fun. It's like, get out of here. If you bought a Metallica for like 6,500 and you could have got 18,4 and you would have if you sold during COVID, you're telling me you don't care that you lost 8 grand on a potential flip value for the game.

[10:40] Because if you sold it for 18, you could go back and buy it for 11. You still would have made $7,000. You would have had a free game. We all wish we made moves like that.

[10:50] Alright, so that's John Borg. And then I'm just going to say it right now. It has to be Tron. It has to be Tron remastered. It's not going to be the Walking Dead. Disney is remastering the original Tron movie right now.

[11:06] What better time for Stern pinball to remaster Tron than right now? And because Stern has the relationship with Disney, come on, it's so obviously going to be a new Tron machine coming out in October to coincide with the movie.

[11:28] Now, if you're looking at your Tron LE right now, another game that you bought for like 5,700 bucks. Remember when that was the game where we were like 10k by Christmas, they were selling for like 18, 19,000 at the height of COVID.

[11:45] If you've got a Tron LE, trust me, sell it. Sell it. The new game is going to be better in every single way. And whatever you sell it for, if they don't come out with the new one, you'll be able to buy one back.

[12:03] But you might as well do the smart thing and get rid of it right now. The problem now is, I think everyone's going to start to realize it's not Walking Dead. It's going to be Tron and no one's going to now pay those huge asking prices for a Tron LE.

[12:19] But man, I can't wait. If Stern like makes a new Tron with the new platform, by the way, speaking of new platforms, where is spike three? Where is it? It's going to have a bigger screen. I'll tell you where it's going to come out.

[12:35] What's the one theme where they could justify a price increase with a bigger screen? Star Wars. Hello. Ding, ding, ding. So we are absolutely going to see the $500 price increase across the board on spike three Star Wars.

[12:52] If they don't bring it out now, I don't feel like it's ever happening. I think spike three then is just going to be internal components. And there's never going to be like an announcement of spike three is here. Stern's just going to be like, Hey, you guys have it.

[13:07] You've had it in King Kong. You've had it in Jaws 50th. Spike three has been out. But we all know Stern needs to up its platform. We know that. We know that Jersey Jack games just present so much better.

[13:19] I've been hearing from people over there. They've got five more themes. They think are bangers like Harry Potter. That's five more years of this beautiful platform taking sales away from Stern. And Stern's going to have to punch back.

[13:33] The market's getting much more competitive. It is. And we're seeing that Harry Potter sold a lot of games. Those are people not ordering King Kong. Those are people not ordering Jaws 50th.

[13:46] I don't see a lot of people ordering both anymore. I think people are getting their pinball. It's scratched a few times a year. And once you get it scratched, you're not going to keep buying and buying and buying.

[13:58] And if there's one company whose games have just absolutely plummeted in value, it's been Stern machines and also Jersey Jack machines. I mean, some of these Jersey Jack Godfather CEs God bless these people.

[14:11] They paid 15,000 for those games. You'll be lucky to get seven for one. I mean it. People just don't even want the game. You're going to lose $8,000 on that machine. It's something nobody really wants to talk about.

[14:25] I think Elton John will hold better because it's just a much better game. I actually think Elton John shoots even better than Harry Potter. And I think as an overall easier to jump into the machine, I still think Elton John will hold better.

[14:40] I still think Elton John is maybe just maybe a better game than Harry Potter. You're not allowed to say that, Kadeida. We got to sell all these CE machines.

[14:51] All right, so let's just talk about Potter quickly. I think everybody's over the AI artwork debate. Some of the games went out with them. Some of the customer games have the old play fields.

[15:02] They clearly made a bunch and assembled a bunch of games and didn't want to throw them all away. So they found the problem. They fixed the problem. Jersey Jack's communications around all of this has been terrible.

[15:17] I kind of feel like this might have been one of the issues, not the only issue that made Ken Cromwell leave the company. Imagine if you're him and you're in marketing and communications and you realize this mistake and instead of coming clean and sort of fixing it before you bring the product to market, you do what they did.

[15:40] That might be some reason why you'd want to leave. Like I'm tired of working for these people that continue to mislead and sometimes openly lie to customers. But I think everybody's over it. That damn little dragon with the two eyes or four eyes. I think everybody's over it.

[15:59] I think for the most part people are really enjoying the gameplay of Harry Potter. You know how I feel about this game. It's a mixed bag. I love the gameplay. I don't like the software. I don't like the movies, how they're buried in the game. I don't want 96 modes. I want to feel a lot more of a sensation of starting each movie.

[16:21] And I just don't feel that right now. It's really early on on the code in this game. So we will see what changes they make. Historically speaking, though, Jersey Jack has never had like a total redo of a code that made it better. What they did do with Wonka was they just made it easier. And that's what made it more fun.

[16:44] So we shall see a lot of people are in the honeymoon phase of Harry Potter. I'm just happy to see games going out. And if you ordered one, I just hope you get your game in a timely manner. Speaking of getting games in a timely manner, Dutch pinball Alice's adventures in Wonderland are starting to land in America with no toppers.

[17:06] I'm seeing games like 5054 arriving on US soil, which is a good thing. The game is beautiful. As much as we know the gameplay is not there. The software is not there. But what is there is absolutely stunning. But what should be of concern is it is July, people? Let's count it.

[17:31] January, February, March, April, May, June, July, we're in the seventh month of the year. And games number 50 and 54 are in America seven months in. And they need to make 500 of these games in the next five months. Not happening.

[17:58] So they're really behind schedule. I thought by now, by July, remember this game came out in October of last year, and they said production was going to begin in January. So by the time Dutch actually gets this thing together, I think they're only going to make like, I don't know, like 300 at most by the end of this year.

[18:25] Are any of us surprised? This is still Dutch pinball. Old habits die hard. This company's been around for like 13 years, 12 years. They've only made one game. Big Lebowski. This is Dutch pinball Lexus game. Melvin made this game. This game was not made by Dutch. It was made by Melvin and Dutch pinball is basically like a contract manufacturer.

[18:55] Assembling a game. Melvin designed this game in a year. In a year, he got the game ready for market. He gave it and it saved Dutch pinball. Remember, they don't have back to the future ready, but it's not even close. It's not even close.

[19:10] And so when Lebowski orders dried up, which they did, this company had nothing to go on the line. So without Alice, Dutch pinball is over. Game over. Game set match. All the EAs were made whole, but that doesn't change the fact that this company doesn't have the experience switching over to another game. They don't have two lines going. And here we are.

[19:34] Seven months. Talk about a delay. That's a significant delay. There's not that many games going out. And now with the topper, Barry's got to find a new vendor. And also with tariffs, this game's going to cost a lot more money. I don't know. I don't know. What I do know is this. In the Netherlands, I bet they're not working as hard as they would here. And what I mean by that, and I have friends over there. Guys, it's real simple.

[20:01] If you're this far behind in your production schedule of making this game, let me ask you guys a question. Are you still going to take your huge vacation in August while your customers don't have their products risking your company's survival? Because if everybody asks for refunds, that could put you guys under. Are you still going to take that vacation? Let me ask you a question, Dutch. Are you guys working around the clock to make up for all the lost time?

[20:28] Are you doing two shifts? Are you going to bring in some new workers? I bet you're not. I bet it's still just business as usual. That's work. And we need a work life balance. And that's the thing. It's like, I'm sorry, but sometimes in life, you got to stay late. There's been many, many times over the last few months, I've been working to one, two in the morning, because I had to meet a deadline.

[20:53] Gentlemen, your deadline is 500 games by December 31st. Are you going to do what it takes to achieve that? Or are you going to still take the long vacation? Have all those bank holidays? Are you still going to operate like the old Dutch? So we shall see.

[21:13] Canada in America on 4th of July, put in the hammer down on European manufacturing, speaking of European manufacturing, pinball brothers, predator pinball, I'm seeing all these Facebook ads. And again, I don't know. I think the only thing left now is this, people have to jump on this machine and give it a glowing review.

[21:38] That's their only way out. They definitely did not get a ton of orders with the Arnold List game. They're now going to have to get good word of mouth. The problem they face is this game isn't even on the line until sometime in August. And by then we're getting a new Star Wars.

[21:56] By then we're getting warmed up for spooky Beetlejuice or Gremlins during the holidays, right? You start to save up your money when you get into the fall, winter, because you know more is about to drop. I mean, think about it. If a neutron is about to come out, are you really, really, oh yeah, let me go in on a $15,000 predator. It's not happening. It's just not happening.

[22:19] You know, and speaking of like getting people on the game is like the only way out for predator. I'm hearing more good stuff about people playing dune pinball and then ordering it. I just talked to Wayne over in Australia. He said, Chris, I just sold five more people played it. They really loved it. And they ordered the game. And look, that's the way out for dune. I've always said it. They need to get people on the game. They need to get them to experience it.

[22:46] When you put dune next to King Kong, it just feels like a much more premium package. It does. Kong just feels like another stern. And again, without any assets, when you jump on dune, you definitely feel like you're playing a game that is integrating the theme much better.

[23:05] It's still comical to me that you could make a King Kong pinball machine and not have the Empire State Building in it. That is like making jaws and not having the orca in the game. Okay, so dune pinball. I want to go play it. I think Automate it might get one soon. I think everybody is in a place now where you're not rushing to order any of these games. You want to have some time on them. You want to play them.

[23:33] If I were you, I recommend doing this. Just enjoy your summer. There's nothing that's coming out this summer. That's going to be hard to get. Everything landing this summer is going to be easy. If you want to get a Harry Potter CE, just wait. Enjoy your summer. Let people buy it now for 15. It's an unlimited run game. You're going to be able to get it forever. There's going to be so many out there. And you don't need to have it right now. The code isn't done. Let them polish the code for the next four to five months.

[24:02] Then go buy a CE for like 12. That's what they're going to go for. They're going to keep making them until the cows come home. And once all these arcade additions and wizard additions get made, all those CEs are not going to be more special. They're going to be less special.

[24:18] You're going to be able to get everything. You're going to be able to get Dune, any King Kong you want, any Jaws variation you want, anything. So I think it's a good summer to just take off, let these companies keep making games, and then wait to the fall.

[24:32] Because think about it, I would wait until November to pull the trigger. Maybe October, because I think by then you're going to see Star Wars. Well, you might have to pull the trigger on Star Wars. Let's be honest. If they make a thousand brand new Star Wars based on the original trilogy we grew up with, and it is magical and it has all the assets, absolutely they will sell a thousand LEDs right away.

[25:02] So if there's any game where there will be FOMO, it will be for that game. Will there be that FOMO if it's based on the prequels? I don't think so. I think that's a whole different kind of movie. I think those movies don't have the same gravitational pull, if you will, on our hearts.

[25:22] Alright, so that's what's happening over there. There's just a lot of other stuff happening. Like, where's Cuphead? Kari Hardy said July. We shall see. Where's the Padready gaming totem? I don't know. Where's Merlin's arcade from Turner Pinball? I don't know. Where's the Merlin edition of Medieval Madness Royal Edition? I love those guys. They're like, I didn't realize it was going to take, where were you? Who the heck ordered that game?

[25:48] And thought they were actually going to get it this summer. What a ridiculous company. I will say this. I think CGC is ridiculous. I would go nowhere near them. The customer experience with that company is horrendous, and I would not go anywhere near them.

[26:05] I could march in right now with no drama and get a Pulp Fiction LE for so much less money and not have my money tied up and have no drama. And not only that, every time Mr. Sharp talks, he's always very snarky. And I hate it. I hate it. Why do they have such arrogance and ego? And they always make these snarky comments. It's like, get your house in order. Really. Get it in order, because it's a joke. Your entire company, they're like, I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in order. I'm not going to get my house in

[26:35] order. The way you reveal a game, take people's money and then go radio silent. It's a total joke and I would never run my company like that. Alright, let's look at a few games real quick that are $14,000 or more. And let's ask ourselves good price or crack pipe price. Alright, Pirates of the Caribbean CE. This is $31,000 for a Pirates CE reduced from $32,500.

[27:05] I don't know. It has all the Leor mods in it, but I just think the notion of dropping $31,000 on a Pirate is not going to happen. And the reason why is this. As I was saying earlier, I think some of these newbie suckers would buy it. I do.

[27:23] The problem is the newbie suckers haven't had a chance to play it. There's just not enough of these games out there. Newbie suckers have been buying some of the worst purchases I've ever seen. But the newbie sucker probably doesn't have a friend that has a Pirate CE. So they weren't around when Pirates came out. So they don't have any frame of reference.

[27:44] And so while they have been making idiotic purchases, the dropping $31,000. You're really in a nice Rolex territory there. And I don't think that's going to sell. Godzilla LE for $15,500. Nope. I think that's a little bit overpriced. I think Godzilla LE is now around like $13,500 maybe. It didn't go down as much as it would have gone down if King Kong was a hit.

[28:13] But King Kong is not a hit. And so Godzilla LE holds more value. Guardians of the Galaxy LE for $16,000. Remember when it was like so easy to get this game for like $8,500? I think New and Box Guardians LEs were available for a long time.

[28:32] I don't see $16,000 here. I do think you'll get $13,000 for it. I do. You remember Guardians has got an LCD screen. They only made I think like $500,000 of them. The games got pretty decent theme integrations, got some weird voiceover work.

[28:48] So are you going to spend $13,000 on a King Kong where they made $1,000 that nobody wants that has terrible theme integration? Or would you spend $13,000 on a Guardians? Because I don't think Stern's like up the game that much.

[29:02] If you put a Guardians next to a King Kong and you say this King Kong is $13,000, well that sort of makes the Guardians look like it's also worth $13,000. It's also got a beautiful art package by Christopher Franchi.

[29:18] This is neither of them is worth $13,000. The problem is both of those games look like $8,500 games and you know it and I know it.

[29:27] Evil Dead CE with a sale pending $14,500. This game is hot. They are sold out only $8,800 and now it's gone up in value. I feel so happy for Bug and Luke. They've done it. They've crossed the Rubicon.

[29:45] They now have made a collectible pin that's actually fun to play unlike Rick and Morty shoots like a dog. But Evil Dead, man, if Evil Dead's going for $14,500, get ready for Beetlejuice or Gremlins to add a few thousand dollars on top of that.

[30:01] Maneval Man is Royal Edition remake. Just say Royal Edition. We know what you're talking about. 15 firm. Nobody's paying that. The reason why no one's going to pay 15 now for a Royal is we've got these Merlin editions. No one cares anymore. Nobody cares.

[30:16] And it's like I said, I think CGC is a company that is just annoying. We got a Tronnelly. This person knows what's coming. Tronnelly 16-5 or best offer. There's only 400 of these. I have to say this. I love the description here. It was a relentless pursuit to finally acquire one and I hate offering it.

[30:40] Okay, sure. You know why you hate offering it for 16-5? Because you know Tron remastered is coming and you're going to go get one of those. I love the stories. I don't want to do this. Then don't do it. Don't do it. Nobody's making you sell a pinball machine. I just love it.

[30:58] My favorite for sale is when people are like, this game's just not for me. I just don't enjoy it. Like why would you ever say that?

[31:04] Alright Ghostbusters LE 16-5 or best offer. There's another Ghostbusters LE for 16. I don't know. This is another game that is always on the radar for remake potential. I still think Ghostbusters LE is one of the most beautiful stern machines of all time. It shoots like a dog. It really does. It's not a fun game to shoot.

[31:29] But it is a fun game to play. Weird, right? That those two things can happen at the same time. But to simply see one is to see a stunning game. I think Ghostbusters LE though... I think like 14-5. I think that's where these games are going to start moving.

[31:47] 14-5 because both these games don't have the topper. Now if you have the topper, then yeah, you might get 16-5 for it. Aerosmith LE with the topper. The guy wants 14,000. Get out of town, man.

[32:00] Look, it's just hard for me because I remember when Aerosmith came out, there wasn't much frenzy for it. It's not a 14,000 dollar game. Everybody, this is why we're all just like, come on, man. We know you bought this game for like 8, 8,500. You want to make some money, sell it for 11. Don't sell it for 14.

[32:25] A Jaws LE with topper. 14-5 and it's sold. Not surprised. I'm not surprised. Jaws LEs have held value. Here's one that hasn't. Metallica remastered LE. Well, it has held value. But 13-9. This just goes to show you, man, these things were selling for 18 when it dropped. 18. Now 13-9, which is almost asking price.

[32:49] Let's see if there's anything else interesting here. Another evil dead for 14-7-5. Not sold yet. A hep restored Adams family for 16-5. A pirate to the Caribbean LE for 18. Another Ghostbusters LE for 15-5. Wow, there's three Ghostbusters LEs for sale. And this is interesting. Why? Is it just because the gameplay? Or maybe Ghostbusters might be coming back.

[33:16] Sometimes I like to just look at what's for sale because some of these big-time collectors, these big shots, they're friends with the folks over at Stern and it is sometimes a place you should go to maybe get an indication of what might be coming back. Like a KISS LE here for 15-5. There's been rumors about KISS coming back. I wouldn't spend 15-5 on KISS. It's just not that good of a game.

[33:40] But here, look, ACDC LE, the back in black edition, sold for 14-9. That's crazy. That's absolutely crazy. And then there is a lonely magic girl for $32,000. This thing's been up here forever. What this guy needs to do, and I mean this, take $10,000 off that price.

[34:04] Nobody wants this magic girl anymore. Like the whole John Papadook. It's beautiful, but it's not fun to play. It's not worth it because I owned one. And trust me, it's just not worth it. The conversation you're going to have and the only people that care that you have a magic girl, aren't people worth impressing.

[34:25] And the enjoyment it will bring you is very, very short lived. Trust me, it is so short lived because you stand over the machine and it looks like it's going to be amazing. And it's like standing in front of a beautiful woman who uses her teeth when she's doing, you know what?

[34:44] I mean, that's it. That's it. That's magic girl, everybody. Look, have a great Tuesday. We'll be back with more episodes of Canadian Pinball Podcast. Thank you for being a member and we'll talk to you real soon.

[35:44] I want to love you the best that, the best that I can.
