[00:00] but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake, there's too much on my plate, I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away and not say what I got to say.

[00:09] I say, I wonder if anyone's even still listening to Canada's Pinball podcast.

[00:18] This is episode 23 of the Canada Club, the first Canada Club in which it is now 100% official that this show is going to be for you club members only.

[00:29] I'm going to talk a little bit about that.

[00:31] I'm not going to harp on that because I want to give you.

[00:33] you the best pinball podcast. I want to give you the show you love without talking about this

[00:38] anymore because this is it. This is where you're going to be able to enjoy. What I believe is the world's

[00:43] most entertaining pinball podcast. Now, let me tell you real quickly why I decided to go this route.

[00:48] Well, first and foremost, first and foremost, I just want a new challenge. I really do. I'm someone

[00:53] who thrives to do something new and challenge myself to see what is possible. For me, winning another

[01:00] Twippy, yes, would I like to win another Twippy?

[01:03] Yes. Would I like everybody to vote for me for favorite pinball podcast? Yes. Would I like you to vote for me

[01:08] for favorite pinball streamer with my Saturday morning spectaculars? Absolutely. Like, I love winning

[01:13] awards. I'm not going to say I don't. But for four years, four years, I've won that award. And the last

[01:20] time I won it by three times the votes. And so when it comes to reaching the largest audience with a

[01:26] pinball podcast, I've done it year after year after year. And I'll tell you, at the end of that journey,

[01:31] what do you get? What do you get?

[01:33] You get thousands and thousands of people who love your show and a $5 trophy.

[01:38] And the amount of time I was spending on doing those podcasts every single week, all of those

[01:44] Facebook lives every single week, and watching these people spend thousands and thousands of

[01:50] dollars on pinball toppers. And then you simply say, hey, five bucks a month, will you show

[01:55] support for my show? And the amount of people that are offended by that is crazy to me.

[02:01] But if you're listening to this now, it doesn't offend you. You understand how much work

[02:08] I've put into this show and you're showing your support. And to me, what a better win-win situation

[02:14] than I'm going to make shows for people who are fans of my show, that I'm going to give back to those who

[02:21] give to me. It's a great marriage. It's a great win-win for everybody involved.

[02:26] You know, someone said to me, like your numbers are going to fall like a rock.

[02:30] And I really mean this when I say it.

[02:31] don't care. I don't care what the numbers are anymore. I don't care what the numbers say anymore.

[02:37] All I care about now is giving back to those who give to me. I want a new challenge. And my new goal

[02:43] and my new challenge, and this is just me personally, is I want to get to a thousand people who are

[02:49] following the Canada Club. That's my goal. And I always think you should have a high goal. Will we ever

[02:54] get there? I don't know. Will this ever replace my full-time job? Absolutely not. Do I get taxed on every

[03:00] single dollar that you're contributing. Yes, I do. I have to declare this. It would be a lot cheaper

[03:05] for me to just flip pinball machines for a year and not even do a pinball podcast, but I still love

[03:12] doing this show. And I think it's hard for some people to realize that is what I love about this show is I

[03:17] love putting on the mic and talking about pinball and saying what I want to say without fear, without

[03:24] any endorsement, without any sponsorships, without any advertising, right? I just love doing that.

[03:30] And when I upload each show, and I mean this when I say it, I don't know who these people are.

[03:35] I don't know who 95% of the people are who listen to every show. But on Patreon, I know who all

[03:43] of you are. And I know that each and every one of you is a fan of the show. And maybe you're not a fan.

[03:48] Maybe you just join because you enjoy the content, even though you can't stand what I say,

[03:51] and I happily welcome you into the club. But I'd much rather do this. And this is my new challenge.

[03:58] It's my new direction. And if people don't.

[04:00] support it, I don't really care because I just enjoy making this content. So here's what I want

[04:05] to do. Let's jump right into what I want to talk about on this episode of Canatus Pinball

[04:09] podcast. I want to talk about what my holiday wish list is for each manufacturer. And I'm going to go

[04:15] down a list of every single company. And I'm going to say, this is my wish for this company in

[04:21] 2022. And I hope they do this thing. And these wishes are going to be things that are obtainable,

[04:27] right? I want to say things that I know each company can

[04:30] feasibly do. I don't want to say like my wishes that home pin will sell 5,000 games a year. We know

[04:37] that's never going to happen. I'm going to give you wishes that can actually come true in the real

[04:41] world. What is my holiday wish for Stern Pinball? I want Stern Pinball to remake all of the

[04:48] accessories that fans have wanted all these years. I just think it's at the point now. When you look at the

[04:54] prices of these toppers and shooter rods and people begging to get Batman inner art decals,

[05:00] Why do people who buy Stern machines have to beg for accessories that Stern made for those

[05:07] machines? So my wish is Stern goes down every single game and remakes those accessories and gives them

[05:15] to people who bought those games. I don't think anyone who bought a Ghostbusters should have to spend

[05:20] $3,500 on a $500 topper. And I hope they do that and that is my wish for Stern pinball. What is my

[05:29] wish for Jersey Jack Pinball. My wish for Jersey Jack Pinball in 2022 is that they finally

[05:35] get two games revealed in one year. They need to do this. This company can't just make one game every 18 months.

[05:45] And they have the ability to do this. They have the facility. They have the workers. We know they have

[05:52] the money. They have the expertise. It is time that Jersey Jack Pinball reveals two games.

[05:59] a year. And what I mean by that is one game will reveal and ship and that is Toy Story.

[06:04] But before the year is up, I think they need to reveal that next game and also have that game ready to go.

[06:11] Here is what I think is going to happen. I think we're going to see Toy Story in March, April

[06:16] reveal and I think you're going to see it May, June. It's going to ship to customers. I also think at

[06:22] the end of the year, I think we're going to see the reveal of Avatar. That is my bet. When the new

[06:28] Avatar movie comes out in December. I think we're going to see Steve Richie on Avatar and I think

[06:35] that's going to be the game that they announce at the end of the year. And I think they're finally

[06:39] going to sync it up with a new movie and launch a theme when it's the right time. I don't think it's going to

[06:45] be Godfather. Even though it is the 50th anniversary of Godfather, I just don't see that being released

[06:51] in 2022. All right. What is my wish for spooky pinball in 2022? The wish is very

[06:58] simple. I do want Spooky to staff up more. I think they need to get more people on board.

[07:04] They need to get more talent over at Spooky Pinball. I also would love to see Spooky. My wish for them

[07:11] is that they hire a designer. I really think they need to get a designer over there that takes this company

[07:18] to the next level. And if I were to have one ultimate wish, no, I'm going to save this wish for

[07:23] American Pinball because I do think American Pinball should do this. So that is my wish for Spooky

[07:28] pinball staff up but hire a designer. I think they need to improve in the design category

[07:34] and I think they need to let go of their ego a little bit. And I think Luke, Bug, and Charlie need to

[07:41] understand that it just can't be them designing these games and let someone else do design. I know

[07:46] designing is the sexy part, but I'm just not sure they're good enough to design games at the level

[07:52] that the competition is designing games and they're the same price. All right, what is my wish

[07:58] Chicago Gaming Company. Now, Chicago Gaming Company, my wish for them is again. Once again,

[08:02] my wish is that they get Mark Ritchie's game out. We know that Mark Ritchie is working on Pulp Fiction

[08:08] and another game. I think it's Beetlejuice. I hope that Chicago Gaming Company cannot just

[08:13] spend the next year and a half making Cactus Canyon games and then rerunning medieval madness.

[08:19] I'm so bored of CGC only looking backwards. They keep saying they're going to move forward

[08:24] with an original IP license game. Where is it? It's about time they do it. So that's my wish

[08:30] that we get to see a non-remake game from CGC. I really don't think that wish is going to come true,

[08:37] but a man can wish, can he not? All right, let's move on to American Pinball. Now American Pinball,

[08:42] very simply this. This company can't survive forever with Legends of Vahala. Vahala orders are probably

[08:49] already dried up, okay? There's no more demand for this game. They're not going to be making standard

[08:53] editions of Vahala. They will probably sell in total those 500 games and that's going to be it.

[09:00] This company, my wish for them, it's very simple. Call Ryan McQuaid up. They need to get Sonic Spinball

[09:07] into production. The game is pretty much designed. He could probably add one more toy or another

[09:13] interesting shot in that game. You know they can Sonic the Hedgehog. Here's what they should add to Sonic

[09:17] spinball because AP already has this meck. You know when you play Sonic the Hedgehog and he gets fired right out of

[09:23] the cannon into like the loop-de-loups. Well, they have that cannon shot from Houdini. If there was

[09:28] one thing they should add to Sonic Spinball, it would be to add that cannon shot into Sonic spinball

[09:35] and fire Sonic out of that all the way across the playfield. How amazing would that be? And I think if

[09:41] they added that to this existing game with the colorful nature of Sonic and all those sounds and the

[09:47] loop-de-loop that's already in the game, I would send them my money tomorrow if they announced they were

[09:53] making Sonic spinball. I think AP is going to make a mistake and do a Dennis Nordman original

[09:58] theme. We don't want these original themes. They are misguided. They will not be competitive

[10:03] in the pinball landscape if AP keeps going down this original IP territory. Sonic spinball. The

[10:10] answer is there, David Fix. The millions of dollars are there. They're waiting for you to make this game.

[10:16] My wish for Dutch pinball is simply this. I think they need to make all EA's whole by the end.

[10:23] of the year. I'm so tired of these EAs waiting and waiting and waiting. Do I think they're

[10:29] going to make them whole? I don't. I think what's hard at Dutch pinball is the production costs have

[10:34] gone up and up and up and up and up, and they didn't charge enough for the machine. So they're already

[10:38] raising the price on it to, I think, $13,000. But there's no way you can do this. Like robbing Peter

[10:43] to pay Paul, this entire thing is a little bit of a Ponzi scheme now trying to get those original

[10:49] EA people whole. Remember, the EA's bought in at $8.

[10:53] thousand dollars and here we are thirteen grand we need to charge almost double the game

[10:59] to get those people their games they're not getting EA's their games fast enough my wish for the

[11:05] pinball brothers is that they don't make queen is that weird wish right i'm wishing they don't do

[11:11] something but queen is one of the greatest bands of all time we've seen the machine i hope this does

[11:18] not become the queen pinball machine that the world gets all right that's my wish just don't

[11:23] do it do something else pinball brothers but don't release queen if that's queen all right what

[11:28] is my wish for p3 multimorphic i mean now they've got bow and karen's over there they're bringing more

[11:33] people in we know jerry doesn't pay people a ton of money i'm i'm sure they're not getting a salary

[11:38] they're like consulting on stuff scott denisi's over there my wish for p3 multimorphic you know what it's

[11:43] going to be i wish that jerry would put a theme onto this platform that people want it's that simple

[11:49] we don't want heist we don't want rocks we don't want lex

[11:53] light speed we don't want these things jerry we need a license theme that takes advantage of this

[11:59] platform we've waited seven eight years just to get to this point will he deliver my wish is that

[12:06] jerry picks the right license to make this platform sing will he do it i don't know i can't imagine

[12:12] he's going to spend the money and also don't forget what a huge huge revenue loss it was

[12:18] that spooky pinball moved away from p rock that's

[12:23] 1750 games that jerry will not be getting any money for now that they're using

[12:28] the ben heck board jerry's not making any money anymore on all those orders that's a huge

[12:35] financial hit for for p3 multimorphic all right who else am i missing or a circus maximus do i

[12:41] wish they get kingpin out the door i'm on there's another one how are they not calling up american

[12:45] pinball being like look we redesigned kingpin it's right here can we get together and make this game

[12:52] I just wish for these guys that they give refunds to everybody who bought a translate

[12:57] because it's not really fair that years ago they marched that game out they sold translates

[13:02] and then they didn't deliver anything now speaking of selling something and not delivering anything

[13:08] yet I forgot about our friends over at haggis pinball my wish for haggis pinball is two things one is

[13:14] I want everybody to get their fathoms by the end of the year I and that's a lot of time to build

[13:19] those fathoms do I think we're going to see fathom on the line

[13:22] in January no do i think damien's going to put up a video convincing us that it's on the line

[13:28] in january yes i do but there is no way he has all of the parts in-house to start production in

[13:34] january we're going to get the typical we're putting the sub assemblies together we're going to get one of

[13:39] those we're going to see like a cabinet and a sub assembly line and that's what they're going to do to convince

[13:44] everybody that production's begun but do i think production has actually begun and games are

[13:48] going to go out the door absolutely not i don't even think people are going to get fathom by

[13:52] and I mean that. I just don't think you're going to see it. I want them to show us what they can do

[13:56] after Celts, right? The Marty Robbins design game will they be able to design a game that is at the level

[14:03] of a stern pro? So my wish is that they get the fathoms built and they show us what kind of games they can

[14:10] build when they're going to build their own titles, not remakes. Look, I think most of my wishes could come

[14:15] true, right? Most of my wishes could come true. Now, do I have a wish for the pinball community out there?

[14:21] And my wish for everybody out there is this. My wish for everybody is just be patient. Be patient.

[14:26] The prices are crazy. They are through the roof, but they're not going to last. And I do think

[14:32] the first half of 2022 is going to be brutal from a supply standpoint. The word on the street is that

[14:38] Stern is 17,000 games backlogged. 17,000. And yet they are going to reveal rush. They're going to reveal

[14:47] venom. They're going to move on to James Bond. And they're going to keep

[14:51] taking orders, but they can't make games fast enough. So be patient. See, the problem right now is

[14:57] people are looking at old titles and because they're available, they're worth almost twice as much.

[15:02] I mean, Ghostbusters, LE's were 7 to 8 grand used. Now they're 15. You couldn't give away Stranger

[15:09] Thing, LE. Now Stranger Things LE is 15.5. I'm seeing Jurassic Park LE's now go for like

[15:15] 1819. It's crazy. If you buy in at these prices, I really do think you're

[15:21] you're buying at the highest these games will ever be. Pimball just won't be a hobby in which

[15:26] LEs are trading consistently for $15,000 to $20,000. I'm sorry because what's going to happen is

[15:32] newer games are going to keep coming out that are half the price and the games are going to be better.

[15:38] Like Godzilla L.E. 10.5. That's a better game than Stranger Things. How is Stranger Things

[15:44] 50% more, right? And when Toy Story comes out, if Jersey Jack prices Toy Story at the same

[15:50] prices G&R, which they might, if they make a thousand CEs, they might say 12-5, it's going to bring

[15:57] the prices of everything else down. My wish for everybody out there is just be patient. There's

[16:02] no need to rush into any of these high prices right now. These games will come up for sale. I'm

[16:09] already starting to see Godzilla L.E's 14, 13, 15. There's a thousand out there. See,

[16:15] the thing is, when you stare at this hobby too closely and you listen to too many pinball podcasts like

[16:20] this and you're on pin side too much, you start to think that everyone's into this, that there

[16:25] are so many people who want this stuff, that there are thousands of people who want to spend

[16:30] $15,000 on a pinball machine. And the truth is, there really aren't that many people. I mean, look what's

[16:37] happening right now to Pirates of the Caribbean, CE, right? We saw a couple sell for like 30, 35.

[16:43] Now four are available for 35, and they're not moving. And the reason why they're not moving is

[16:50] Even though there's just four up there, that's four that are available.

[16:54] And the only reason why some of them sold for like 35 is people thought they would never be available again.

[17:01] They thought that, oh, I have to jump in and get this one because I won't get another chance to buy another one.

[17:06] But we all know that's not the case.

[17:09] You will see every year for the rest of your life, you will be able to get a Pirates of the Caribbean CE.

[17:15] Same thing with Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[17:17] And the more good games that come out,

[17:19] the next Keith Elwin game, the next Eric Minier game, the next Pat Lawler game, the JJP, Steve Richie game.

[17:27] These games are going to be great. They're going to keep making amazing games.

[17:31] And so people are going to want to go to the new stuff, the hot stuff, the talked about stuff.

[17:36] And that's just the way it goes. So I just wouldn't overinvest in some of these older titles right now,

[17:42] and I would just be patient. Everybody, thank you so much for being a part of the Canada Club.

[17:46] I want to sign off by saying, your support.

[17:49] of me and of this show. In a very difficult time for me, I'm not going to lie, I've had very

[17:54] little sleep. I didn't get any holiday bonus at work, which has stressed me out. I've been so

[17:59] overworked this year. I've had no sleep for nine months. I have the most amazing wife. I have the most

[18:06] amazing baby boy. And I love my life and I love doing this show. A lot of really negative stuff

[18:12] has been said about me and people love to pile on. And it does hurt my feelings at time to see all the

[18:17] nasty things people say about me. It hurts my feelings when people have listened to my show

[18:22] for five years, five years for free. And they've listened to every single episode and the second

[18:28] you're like, hey, five bucks a month. And they're offended. And they say nasty things. It hurts my

[18:33] feelings when people say, well, you're not going to get my Twippy vote now because you have your club episodes.

[18:39] Like, now I can't support you anymore. It's unbelievable to me that people have that attitude, that I should

[18:46] spend so many hours of my life doing something for their entertainment. And they think it's

[18:51] offensive for me to say, hey, can you just kick a few bucks here and there just to show your support?

[18:56] And I'll say this. And I've been at odds with this guy for many, many years. And I was really bummed

[19:02] out the other day because I knew I was going to go in this direction. I was reading all the negative

[19:06] stuff people were saying about me. All right, so I put up a little bit of a dudge show. So I'll admit

[19:11] it. Like, I didn't put up my best show when I did my show about the Godfather. It did sound a little

[19:16] little bit like I was complaining about this guy scooping me on that information. And I should

[19:21] have just gone with it the moment I had it, okay? And I admit it. And I took the show down because it

[19:25] wasn't my best. It's in my power to remove something that I don't think is up to the caliber of Canada's

[19:30] pinball podcast. And I was all bummed out. And I knew I was going to do this. I was going to take everything

[19:35] to the Canada Club. And I actually had the best conversation and it cheered me up more than anybody else

[19:41] that day. And I had a conversation with Zach Many. And Zach was saying, you know, Chris, I really

[19:46] fully support this. I support what you're doing because nobody else out there really understands

[19:51] the amount of time and the amount of effort people like us put into our content. And for all these years,

[19:58] we've been making all this content and people never give back anything. All these years,

[20:02] we've been making this content thousands of hours. And the second you want to monetize it just a little

[20:07] bit, everybody revolts. And so he was very, very supportive of me doing this. Now, maybe Zach is

[20:13] supporting me doing this because he wants me off the main.

[20:16] airwaves. But again, like, I really don't care. This is my new challenge. This is my new goal.

[20:22] And you are my new audience. And I'm asking each and every one of you to do me a favor.

[20:27] Please don't share these links. Please don't share this with people who aren't members because I am doing

[20:35] this for you. And this is for you. I don't want this to be passed around to people who don't deserve it.

[20:41] If they want to listen to Canadian's pinball podcast, please send them the link to Patreon.

[20:46] they can join. And then they can be part of the club. All right. My goal is lofty. 1,000 people. Can I

[20:52] convert 30% of my audience over to the Canada Club? I don't know. I don't know. Again, I'm not making a lot

[20:59] of money doing this. This is more about me giving back to those who give. And I just feel a sense of calm

[21:05] that I don't have to do this and the other show and that all those haters out there on Pinside, they no longer

[21:11] can hear me. They no longer will have access to me unless they join the club. And that's the way I want.

[21:16] it because after five years, you just get tired of giving so much of yourself for free. And then

[21:22] these people have nothing but nasty words to say about you. And I will say this. That number burns them

[21:29] so bad. When they see 303 people have joined, that kills them. When they see 400, it's going to

[21:35] evaporate them. When they see 500 members, they're absolutely going to have nothing to say. And we're

[21:41] still going to win Twippies. And we're still going to mic drop. And we're still going to do Facebook live

[21:45] Saturday morning spectaculars. And Canada will still be a huge voice in the industry. And it's

[21:50] going to crush them because you don't start something like this show started and it doesn't just go away,

[21:56] right? This isn't like Nate Schivers joining Stern and interviewing Stern people. Like the reason

[22:01] why that stopped being interesting because Nate's not going to tell you how he really feels about

[22:05] Led Zeppelin. Same thing with Ken Cromwell interviewing his own people at Jersey Jack Pimball. Are

[22:10] they really going to tell you how they feel about games and code? No, they're not. This is still going to be

[22:15] me being me. And I'm still going to give you the goods, all the information before everybody else.

[22:20] Everybody, have a happy holiday. Enjoy it with your families to health and happiness going into

[22:26] 2022. Peace out.
