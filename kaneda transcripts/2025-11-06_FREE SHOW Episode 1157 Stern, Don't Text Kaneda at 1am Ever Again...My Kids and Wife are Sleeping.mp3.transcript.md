[00:00] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:23] The only Pinball Podcaster receiving, threatening, they're not threatening, they're just really

[00:29] annoying letters on my phone text messages from Stern employees about how disappointed

[00:38] they are, how disappointed they are, how disappointed they are in the things I'm saying about their

[00:46] games.

[00:47] Am I saying anything radical?

[00:49] Am I saying anything that the community is not feeling?

[00:53] Maybe we're just tired of every single Stern game looking very similar.

[00:59] Maybe we're tired Stern of you taking every single theme regardless of what it is and

[01:06] it looks more like My Little Pony than it does look like the theme.

[01:13] What about the King Kong world has all of those rainbow colors in it?

[01:18] What about the walking dead feels this bright and colorful?

[01:23] And in just one day, people on the pin side community are taking those art packages, they're

[01:29] sort of toning down the colors and then the games look so much better.

[01:34] But you know what?

[01:35] It's Canada's fault.

[01:36] Canada's ruining my peace of mind.

[01:38] Canada's ruining my family.

[01:40] Canada's the reason why I didn't want to get into Pinball.

[01:42] This is the stuff I'm hearing.

[01:44] I'm the reason why you want to leave Pinball.

[01:47] A little blowhard podcaster who's like basically just covering this hobby for the last 12 years.

[01:54] For 12 years I've been covering this hobby and I've seen Stern make so many tremendous

[01:59] games, so many of them.

[02:02] And doesn't it feel like if I were to ask each and every one of you right now listening

[02:05] right now on Canada's Pinball podcast right here on Facebook Live, I'm doing this like

[02:10] a dual show baby, all edits, all mistakes, no editing happening.

[02:14] I'm just going to put this thing up with every single issue of the show.

[02:18] I don't even care because you can see I don't need editing, I don't need notes, I don't

[02:22] need anything.

[02:23] All I need to do is ask you guys one simple question.

[02:27] Which company in the Pinball world feels like their best days are ahead of them?

[02:33] Which companies feel like the future looks brighter than the past?

[02:37] And which company feels like the best days are behind them?

[02:42] The best themes they're ever going to get are behind them.

[02:46] The best value they're ever going to give us is behind them.

[02:51] And when you think about it like that, does anybody in all of Pinball right now think

[02:57] that the best days for Stern are in front of us?

[03:03] The best value they're going to give us is in front of us?

[03:08] I don't think anybody's feeling that way at all.

[03:11] And this company, which we all love, like not for a second have I ever lost in iota

[03:20] of respect for George Gomez, not for a second.

[03:24] You got to look at George Gomez and his totality in coming over from Cuba, the stuff the man

[03:30] has done, what he's built is absolutely the greatest individual in the history of all of

[03:37] Pinball.

[03:38] More than George, I'm sorry, not more than George.

[03:40] Again, we're not getting out of this.

[03:41] More than Gary, more than anybody else, George Gomez will be and always is the man.

[03:49] But now it's looking like as an organization, not even George.

[03:54] I don't know who can even steer the ship right because they just feel like they've done everything

[04:01] they're ever going to do.

[04:02] That's amazing.

[04:03] And the best years are behind them.

[04:07] When we look at companies like Spooky Pinball, the best years look to be in front of them.

[04:13] When we look at Jersey Jack, I think the best years are in front of them based on the themes

[04:19] they have, how much fun their games are to play.

[04:23] When we look at companies like Barrels of Fun, the best years are easily in front of

[04:27] them because any man with a ding dong doesn't want to own labyrinth.

[04:32] That was a bad choice and any man who's got another ding dong doesn't want to have a

[04:38] dune pinball machine and so they finally made a game based on something that most grown

[04:43] men and women like, haunted houses.

[04:46] And look, instantly sells out in two days.

[04:49] Hasn't even sold 500 dunes.

[04:51] Okay, so in my honest opinion, the best years of Barrels of Fun are in front of them.

[04:57] And when you look at the pinball world, everybody else, the best years of Dutch pinball, right?

[05:02] They've got back to the future coming.

[05:05] So the best years of Dutch pinball are in front of them.

[05:09] And so what I think is happening now at Stern Pinball, you've got the biggest company in

[05:12] all of pinball.

[05:14] They employ the most people in all of pinball.

[05:16] And it should be, if you think about it, the greatest job to have in all of pinball because

[05:22] you get to work for a pinball company that releases three to four games a year, three

[05:27] cornerstones and like one remastered and maybe one anniversary edition.

[05:32] They really release five games a year.

[05:35] And that would seemingly be the place you want to be where everybody else, you might

[05:38] have to wait.

[05:39] You might have to wait a long time to get your product into market.

[05:42] But nowadays, look at what's happening.

[05:45] Everybody at Stern Pinball seems on edge.

[05:47] Like John Borg in that video about the new game that he's been working on, the walking

[05:53] dead remastered.

[05:54] It looks like he is like held captive by Stern Pinball.

[05:59] He looks like he's more of a hostage than someone who's happy about his new game.

[06:06] Remember that old scene in airplane, the movie where the guy's holding the gun to the Soviet

[06:10] Union's news reporter?

[06:13] That's what John Borg looks like as he's trying to sell us on his new game.

[06:18] And so if they're not excited and they're not happy, how do they expect us to feel?

[06:24] And so I'm hearing from big distributors, you know how many LEDs are selling?

[06:28] Not many, because everybody now knows that if you buy an LE of the walking dead for $13,000,

[06:36] you're screwed.

[06:37] You're screwed.

[06:38] This game is going to sink down to 10 real fast.

[06:41] And I know that I said, and I was wrong, and I'm always the first to admit when I'm wrong.

[06:45] I know I said I thought the walking dead LE would sell out instantly because it's only

[06:50] 500 Sterns.

[06:51] I just did not expect them to do another overly bright, overly colorful game.

[06:58] I also did not expect them to get no clips like nothing new is in this game.

[07:06] It's also the fact that Weissen is on the code of this game.

[07:11] They don't want to tell you this.

[07:12] They don't want to promote this.

[07:14] But Weissen was the last guy on this planet that Lyman Sheets Jr. would ever have wanted

[07:22] to touch his product, his masterpiece, his code.

[07:27] And so you have Weissen, this new artist, and again, I just think they over colorized it.

[07:32] I don't think the art's bad.

[07:34] I don't.

[07:35] I just don't think it's the walking dead.

[07:38] It's the same reason I just don't think that looks like King Kong.

[07:43] And I don't understand why they don't get this.

[07:45] They just don't get it.

[07:47] And you step back and you look at these Stern machines and it's like they're not bad, but

[07:52] they're not great.

[07:54] And they're not what they should be.

[07:56] And they're not indicative of a company that has so many people, so much resource, so many

[08:03] abilities to connect to the community.

[08:05] They just don't care to listen.

[08:08] It's like they think they can make the decisions that will motivate most of us to buy their

[08:15] games.

[08:17] And I went over there a year ago and I said the thing they need to do the most is to win

[08:21] back the ellie buyer of their product, win back the collector, do stuff that sort of

[08:28] like reestablishes some loyalty between the people that have been buying their high end

[08:33] products and you know, the company itself.

[08:36] And they've done nothing.

[08:37] Name me one move.

[08:39] I'm just serious.

[08:40] Name me one move that Stern pinball has done in an entire year to win back the loyal Stern

[08:48] ellie buyer.

[08:49] One move.

[08:51] Did they give you any exclusive code in an ellie machine?

[08:55] No.

[08:56] Did they give you an exclusive topper?

[08:58] No.

[08:59] Did they do anything?

[09:00] Did they call you in the stern and do a focus group with people that have bought $100,000

[09:06] Stern products?

[09:07] No.

[09:08] Don't give me this.

[09:09] King Kong is a great game.

[09:10] King Kong, it doesn't matter if King Kong plays well.

[09:14] King Kong looks like something that belongs in my kids daycare classroom.

[09:22] And so King Kong got nothing on Canada.

[09:25] That game looks so overly colorized, so much like a kid's version of King Kong.

[09:32] So it's a great game.

[09:33] Fine.

[09:34] I've owned a great game by putting on top of it artwork that looks like it comes from

[09:40] Kpop demon hunters.

[09:42] That looks like it comes from my little pony.

[09:44] And so nobody stood over that machine and said, Hey man, this is looking like way too

[09:49] colorful.

[09:50] This doesn't feel like King Kong.

[09:52] Like this is not what people think of when they think of King Kong.

[09:57] Nobody at Stern walked by the game and said that.

[10:00] And so now what you have is you have an entire community out there that sees it right away.

[10:05] Like we see it right away.

[10:07] And you're telling me that that big company with hundreds of employees, nobody saw what

[10:10] we see.

[10:12] And so then Canada's got to wake up at 1245 in the morning.

[10:16] I get a text message 12, 1245 in the morning.

[10:19] I get a text message from someone over at Stern pinball.

[10:22] You could probably guess who it was, you know, telling me what a terrible person I am, how

[10:27] I've destroyed their family.

[10:30] And I've like, I'm the single reason why they wish they never worked in pinball.

[10:34] You know what, you just get to send that to me.

[10:38] You know, I've lost family members to cancer, I lost a baby, you know, in a second trimester.

[10:43] You want to talk about family destruction because I'm just critiquing art on a pinball

[10:48] machine.

[10:49] And I get that that's your job.

[10:50] You didn't even do the damn art on walking dead.

[10:52] You didn't even do the damn art on Star Wars.

[10:55] So don't come at me with such dramatic hyperbole.

[11:00] Don't do that.

[11:01] If you want to call me up, call me up.

[11:02] You want to have a conversation about it?

[11:04] Have a conversation about it.

[11:05] But don't text me at one in the morning.

[11:07] I got to wake up and read this while I'm in the ready for, I'm ready for like a new business

[11:13] pitch.

[11:14] I got to be in there.

[11:15] I don't care, man.

[11:16] You're a paid employee.

[11:17] You're a paid employee of an organization.

[11:19] And I know you got feelings, but stop, maybe, maybe stop blaming me, maybe stop blaming

[11:24] the community, maybe stop blaming pinside, maybe stop getting so upset every time someone

[11:30] uses the phrase rainbow puke, maybe stop, maybe stop for a minute and say, Hey, hey,

[11:36] why don't I just like ask for feedback in a constructive way?

[11:41] Why don't you, if your job is to direct the art of storm pinball, why don't you bring

[11:46] in a focus group?

[11:47] Why don't you say what I'm going to do differently this time?

[11:48] Because I'm tired of the community.

[11:50] I'm tired of them railing on my stuff and my decisions.

[11:53] Here's what we're going to do.

[11:54] Instead of guessing, why don't we bring in a certain number of people under NDA to see

[12:01] different artistic options we're thinking for games and get some feedback?

[12:07] Because you obviously, as an organization, are not nailing it.

[12:11] And if you think it's me just saying this, fine, you can make me the bad guy.

[12:15] You can throw the arrows in my back, but it's not just me.

[12:18] All I am ever doing, wake up, stern employees.

[12:22] If you don't know what can it is about by now, you need to check yourselves.

[12:26] All I'm doing is I'm speaking on behalf of what I'm reading from the community.

[12:32] I am not putting these thoughts in people's heads.

[12:35] I am not the first person that said stern games are looking like My Little Pony or Rainbow

[12:40] Puke.

[12:41] I am simply reading that time and time again.

[12:45] And so when I say it, how dare you?

[12:48] How dare you come at me?

[12:50] Like I'm the one that's leading an army of people to feel this way about your product.

[12:56] This is what the community is feeling.

[12:59] I am simply reacting to what they are saying.

[13:05] And I'm tired of how when we look at Star Wars artwork and it's something we grew up

[13:13] with, and it's something we love, and it looks like ass.

[13:16] It looks terrible.

[13:18] And I know what you're capable of, stern, but then you want to shove this thing in front

[13:22] of us and then you want to have this sob story about what it's how hard it is to work with

[13:26] license.

[13:27] I don't care how hard it is to work with licensors.

[13:29] I can look all the way in the world and see so much better Star Wars artwork that was approved

[13:35] by the license holder.

[13:37] So why is it so hard for you to get it right?

[13:39] And if it is so hard, let me just throw this out there.

[13:42] If you can't make the game the best possible way that you want to make the game with King

[13:47] Kong clips, with the right Star Wars artwork, if you can't make the game that's worthy of

[13:53] how much you're charging us for your product, then don't effin make the game.

[14:00] Then go get a license that will allow you the freedom to make the game the right way.

[14:08] You know, I'm so tired of this, like you guys are the victims of like us.

[14:14] You're not a victim.

[14:16] Anyone who works over at Stern, you are a paid employee that gets to wake up every day and

[14:23] do something amazing.

[14:25] If you can't shut out the canadas and you can't turn off Pinside and just do your job

[14:33] and enjoy it, then you're broken, not me.

[14:38] I'm allowed to have free speech.

[14:40] I'm allowed to have an opinion about your product.

[14:43] I'm allowed to say what I want without you telling me that I'm destroying your world.

[14:48] You have the advantage.

[14:51] You have the advantage.

[14:52] George Gomez, Seth Davis, Zombie Yeti, Jack Danger, Weisson, John Borg, every, you guys

[15:00] have the advantage.

[15:02] It's your company.

[15:04] You can do whatever you want with every single product and you think that we want to see

[15:09] you fail.

[15:11] Do you think we want to see every Stern game look the same?

[15:14] Do you think we want to feel this way about your product?

[15:18] You are the chosen one, Stern.

[15:20] You have the high ground.

[15:22] I feel like Obi-Wan screaming at you fools.

[15:25] What are you doing over there?

[15:27] You messed up Star Wars again.

[15:29] You make King Kong look like a My Little Pony game.

[15:32] You know, you make Venom, you make John Wick.

[15:34] What are you doing?

[15:35] You passed on Beetlejuice.

[15:36] You passed on Back to the Future.

[15:38] You passed on all these games that everybody's like snapping up now instantly and it's our

[15:42] fault that no designer over there wanted to make Beetlejuice and I got to wake up in November

[15:48] and I got to do a show like this and I'm going to do more shows like this if you're going

[15:52] to hit me with text messages at one in the morning accusing me of destroying your world.

[15:58] I haven't destroyed anything.

[16:00] Take some freaking accountability for the games you're putting out.

[16:04] Take some freaking responsibility for what you think is worth $13,000.

[16:10] I'm tired of this and you should be more tired of it and instead of coming at me, why don't

[16:17] you work within what I'm saying?

[16:20] Why don't you invite me back there?

[16:21] It's been a year.

[16:23] It's been a year.

[16:24] I'll tell you exactly what you need to do and for some reason it shouldn't be that hard.

[16:28] How is it that hard to find art that is appropriate for the theme?

[16:33] How is it that hard?

[16:34] How is it that hard to understand what King Kong should look like?

[16:39] How is it that hard to make it so you don't put Yoda down by the flippers with his eyes

[16:43] going back and forth?

[16:44] That looks terrible.

[16:45] Like nobody walked in front of that machine and said, this is annoying.

[16:49] This is annoying.

[16:50] You have hundreds of employees and this is good enough.

[16:53] How is it that hard to realize that you have one of the biggest weapons or vehicles in

[17:00] Star Wars, the adat.

[17:01] Huge, huge adat.

[17:02] You can make one this big.

[17:04] How hard is it for someone to walk by and be like, if we put that micro penis into this

[17:09] game, it's going to look stupid.

[17:12] Everyone's going to make fun of us.

[17:13] If we're going to make an adat, it has to be bigger.

[17:16] We can't do this.

[17:18] That's it.

[17:19] That's it.

[17:20] I don't care anymore.

[17:23] I don't understand what Stern things are doing.

[17:25] I really don't care anymore.

[17:27] They literally keep going boys.

[17:29] Keep going with the same playbook, the same release videos, the same everything, the same

[17:35] look, the same way to launch and everyone else is going to start to just chip away significantly

[17:41] now.

[17:42] The excitement is with Beetlejuice.

[17:44] It's with Winchester.

[17:46] It's everywhere else.

[17:47] It's with Harry Potter.

[17:48] And how dare you text me and tell me that.

[17:52] And I mean this.

[17:53] How dare you throw into the mix of games that are also rainbow puke, evil, dead and Harry

[18:00] Potter.

[18:01] You want to try to take down the art packages of Harry Potter and evil, dead and you want

[18:07] to put the Stern stuff next to that.

[18:09] How dare you come at me with that and just try to hit me at one in the morning with such

[18:15] inaneness.

[18:16] It's not going to work.

[18:17] It's not going to work.

[18:18] And hey, and I mean it when I say this to everybody over at Stern.

[18:22] Might hear this or might listen to this gang look.

[18:26] We love Stern pinball.

[18:29] We root for Stern pinball.

[18:30] We root for every new Stern game to really blow us away.

[18:34] But I feel like you need a time out.

[18:36] You need to start listening to people a little bit more and you need to stop acting like

[18:40] everything you do is just going to work without making any changes.

[18:44] It's not working anymore.

[18:45] Your company was never set up to sell consistently 10 to $13,000 products and stern the party

[18:52] that you just can't seem to understand.

[18:55] The only reason why your games were ever worth 10 to 13 to 15 to $18,000 because you made

[19:02] the best damn pinball on planet Earth for five to $7,000.

[19:09] Let me repeat that.

[19:10] You made the best damn pinball on planet Earth for five to $7,000.

[19:14] All right.

[19:16] And it was those five to $7,000 games that became worth $18,000.

[19:21] And you don't get it.

[19:22] Now you want us to pay $13,000 for games that are half as good.

[19:27] I got to go.

[19:28] Peace out.

[19:29] All right.

[19:30] You ready, Sarah?

[19:31] Jump on.

[19:32] Fire.

[19:33] Fire.

[19:34] My sister-in-law has to make a phone call.

[19:35] That's why that ended.

[19:36] Love you guys.

[19:37] This is dedicated to Joe, the fake, to Kodo.

[19:44] Grab your phone, Sarah.

[19:47] Phone.

[19:48] I'm going to show you how to play.

[19:55] I'm going to show you how to play.

[20:00] I'm going to show you how to play.

[20:05] I'm going to show you how to play.

[20:08] I'm going to show you how to play.

[20:11] I'm going to show you how to play.

[20:14] I'm going to show you how to play.
