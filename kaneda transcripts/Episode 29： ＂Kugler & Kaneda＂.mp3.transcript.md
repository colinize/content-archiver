[00:00] Ladies and gentlemen, before we start episode 29 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, can we please

[00:05] have a moment of silence and respect for Cornelius, who has now been permanently ejected from

[00:12] Canada's Pinball Podcast thread.

[00:15] Our thoughts and prayers go out to him now.

[00:48] Coming at you from everywhere but the Pinside Basement, it's Canada's Pinball Podcast

[01:05] episode 29.

[01:08] Happy Friday, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:10] Have a really awesome interview for you guys today.

[01:13] Thank you Josh Kugler.

[01:16] If you may know Josh from the Homebrew world, then we talk about Homebrew Pinball, we

[01:20] talk about what's going on in the industry, we talk about J-pop, we talk a little bit

[01:24] about Skit B, we talk about all the good things and what goes into making a Pinball machine

[01:29] from scratch.

[01:30] So without further ado, I want to air the tape and I hope you enjoy it and everyone

[01:34] have a happy and healthy Friday.

[01:36] All right, well I want to introduce to Canada's Pinball Podcast, a really exciting

[01:42] guest.

[01:43] I want to introduce Josh Kugler.

[01:44] Did I get your name right Josh?

[01:46] Yes you did.

[01:48] Josh is sort of like this amazing, amazing individual who is very well versed in the world

[01:54] of Homebrew Pinball machines and Homebrew is a topic that we haven't really discussed

[01:59] yet but I think it's something very interesting that a lot of people are in the pinball, follow

[02:04] the threads of the Homebrew machines that are being made.

[02:07] So Josh, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:09] Well thanks for having me on.

[02:12] All right, so let's just jump right into it.

[02:14] So how did you get into the world of Homebrew?

[02:20] What was the genesis of getting into?

[02:21] I'm going to make my own Pinball machine.

[02:24] Well, probably like a lot of people I fell in love with Pinball very young and I remember

[02:28] as a kid making my own Pinball machine with nails and rubber bands and making flippers.

[02:35] So really from the time I was very young, I always thought it'd be cool to make Pinball

[02:39] machine.

[02:40] And I thought about it over the years and I've looked at it a few times and then several

[02:45] years ago I did a re-themed and it was sort of like my first attempt to do a Pinball machine.

[02:51] And yeah, it's still a challenging thing that designed the art and decide what to do

[02:54] and I did an EM re-themed.

[02:55] So I didn't have to really do with any rules or anything like that.

[02:59] It was a great way to start and then after having done that I was really wanted to do something

[03:04] more serious and I heard about the P-Rock, which is multi-morphics.

[03:10] Control system for Pinball and read up on it because the thing that always concerned me

[03:15] was how do you ensure when you hit the flippers, the buttons rather than the flippers flip when

[03:20] they should all of that.

[03:22] And you heard about that system and it was like, oh my god, I can actually make a real

[03:27] Pinball machine.

[03:29] And I literally like ordered the hardware like the next day.

[03:32] No clue what I was doing.

[03:33] I just jumped in with two feet.

[03:35] And did you do that?

[03:37] So for those of us out there listening, so when P-Rock came out, so P-Rock is sort of

[03:43] the internal computer that helps you make a machine.

[03:48] So it controls all the different.

[03:51] The buttons, the flippers, it allows you to actually make a game that you can play.

[03:56] So how much do you need to know computers to work with P-Rock?

[04:02] Is it easy to learn how to program a game?

[04:05] To me, that sounds like the most daunting thing in the world to make a Pinball machine.

[04:11] So does it make it easy?

[04:14] For someone who doesn't have any knowledge of coding?

[04:17] No, unfortunately, it doesn't necessarily make it easy.

[04:19] It makes it possible.

[04:21] OK.

[04:21] Really what the P-Rock does is it acts as an interface between the computer and a Pinball machine.

[04:27] And the cool thing about it is you can put it in a Williams machine and just replace

[04:31] the main board there or a Stern machine and hook a computer and do things with it.

[04:37] So like Cactus Canyon continued, which a lot of people are familiar with, Eptogheak

[04:42] Eric Prypki did that project, is basically putting a P-Rock in and it's a regular Cactus

[04:49] Canyon and then writing the rules so that he was able to expand the rules.

[04:53] So the P-Rock sort of is like that translator that goes in between there.

[04:57] OK.

[04:58] And so, OK.

[04:59] So let's talk about that and then we'll get back into sort of, we'll go to Cactus Canyon

[05:05] and continue in a little bit.

[05:07] So like, OK.

[05:08] So you get the P-Rock system and you have a background and computers.

[05:12] You sort of have some foundation in how to do this and how to code.

[05:17] Yeah.

[05:18] I know how to code, so that's an advantage.

[05:19] And there are people who've jumped into this who don't.

[05:22] There are some ways to do that.

[05:23] You sort of have to learn it to be able to really do something creative.

[05:28] You know, as we all know with pinball, you know, it's the complexity of the rules.

[05:33] Often is what makes a great game and to create a complex game, you need to then have some

[05:39] programming skills.

[05:41] So what there is though, there are what are called frameworks and frameworks kind of give

[05:44] you the starting point of having a working game that you can then build upon.

[05:50] So for example, you could build out a machine and hook it up and the framework will get you

[05:56] to the point where you could put a ball in play and the flippers will flip and you could

[06:00] do some quick things with minor code to make it score.

[06:04] You can get to that part pretty good, but when you want to then make it really do something,

[06:08] it does require computer skills.

[06:11] And what, so like those computer skills are probably most people in the community don't

[06:18] have them.

[06:19] Most of the guys are doing these home brew games.

[06:22] They come from like IT backgrounds.

[06:23] They have computer skills.

[06:24] It's something that they've been doing for a long time and to your point.

[06:28] Now they can apply those skills to pinball because it's now possible to have.

[06:33] Yes and no.

[06:34] I mean, there are guys.

[06:38] There's a guy who's done two machines, Matt, Bonama, and he's really a guy who does welding

[06:44] and works in things with his hands.

[06:46] He's not a computer guy at all and he's working on his second machine and he basically has

[06:51] learned what he needs to learn programming and he gets help from other guys in the community

[06:56] to help him do that.

[06:58] Another thing you see is like the Buffy, the vampire slayer pin.

[07:02] It's two guys who've been working on actually three one guy who did the art.

[07:06] One guy who's really worked on the machines and another guy who's done the software.

[07:10] They've partnered together to divide and conquer to get that done.

[07:17] The archer machines, another example that Keith Elwin and Randy Elwin working on that

[07:21] machine together, Keith doing the design, Randy doing the coding and the video stuff.

[07:28] A lot of the projects often have a group of two or three people who might be working together

[07:34] so you get those different skills you need.

[07:38] Software's not enough.

[07:40] You got to have art, you got to have gots, you got to have sound, you got to have music.

[07:45] Definitely.

[07:46] Let's do this for what I want to do is let's talk about the two different approaches to

[07:52] making a personalized pinball machine.

[07:55] Can we go down the list, Josh, in terms of what are the things you need to do in which

[08:00] order?

[08:01] Let's take re-thimming, for example.

[08:02] Say someone wants to re-theme a machine.

[08:06] What are the steps to re-theme?

[08:08] What's the first thing you have to do to draw out your design, think about if you want

[08:14] to make any changes, you're working with the same layout.

[08:18] Talk us through how to re-theme a machine from A to Z.

[08:21] I think there are two great examples of that that were done.

[08:25] One was when a Johnny Nemanik was re-themed into the Matrix and it was an expo a couple

[08:31] of years ago and it was just a beautiful machine.

[08:34] They did a phenomenal job with it.

[08:37] The other one that's been next for the last couple of years, Buffy the Vampire Slayer,

[08:41] which used to be a swords of fury.

[08:43] Of course I have to say Lion Man, trouble with people, so how to get that in there.

[08:48] I'm going to edit that out.

[08:49] No, I'm just kidding.

[08:52] Those are both great examples of, people had an idea for a theme.

[08:56] They didn't want to have to try and design a play field and figure out that component

[09:00] and get the parts and all the things that are a challenge there.

[09:04] They found a play field they liked.

[09:06] In both cases, you have to have a little bit of that divide and conquer of working through

[09:10] the art and the style.

[09:12] Then working together, figure out what the rules are.

[09:14] What do you want to create in the game?

[09:16] Of course, anybody can come up with rules, maybe not good ones, but everybody can do that

[09:22] and work through that.

[09:24] They sat down and coded the game and worked through getting their assets.

[09:28] It's the artwork they need.

[09:31] When you pick a theme like those, the nice thing is you're not worrying about licensing,

[09:34] so you can go grab all the video clips and the sounds that you can find to incorporate

[09:40] into your machine.

[09:43] When you're re-thimming, the line share of the work is going into the coding of the machine,

[09:50] the artwork.

[09:51] I saw with Matrix 2, they added some elements to the play field.

[09:55] They added a magnet to it.

[09:56] I saw.

[09:57] They added a few changes.

[10:00] For the most part, I think what the benefit is, you can find a pinball machine that is

[10:04] a great layout, but might not be a great game.

[10:09] I think people might argue that Johnny Numanik was a decent game, but for the most part, that

[10:15] was a George Gomez game, correct?

[10:17] It was shot great, but the code wasn't great.

[10:20] It was really interesting elements under the play field.

[10:26] Let's talk about timing.

[10:29] In your estimate, how much time and energy would go into making something like a buffy or

[10:34] a matrix?

[10:37] It is a massive amount of time to do one of these projects.

[10:42] That's where most of them take a period of time, where a group of guys to do it.

[10:47] Again, it depends how deep.

[10:48] People often ask me, where is my machine going to be done?

[10:50] I'm like, I don't know if it'll ever be done.

[10:53] You can keep expanding and keep adding rules to it.

[10:55] I think the buffy pin, I think from the time those guys started on it until they actually

[11:01] had it playable and presentable, they did it in a year, I think.

[11:04] It would be a little bit more than that.

[11:08] I think that's a time frame.

[11:10] Yes, obviously, guys work in doing this part time.

[11:13] They're doing it in evenings.

[11:14] Basically, they give up playing pinball in order to build pinball.

[11:19] That's a time frame it can take.

[11:21] You can move at any pace.

[11:22] There are people who have been working on machines three, four years.

[11:26] I've gone a half way to where they want to get to and other people can do that in four

[11:31] months.

[11:33] Depending on your commitment and your vision.

[11:37] Sure.

[11:38] I have no other other ideas.

[11:40] I'm sure two people's skill sets and talent levels in different areas can either speed

[11:46] things up or slow things down depending on what part of the game you're trying to tackle.

[11:50] I'm actually really familiar with the Matrix because I think I was telling you this.

[11:55] I was trying to buy one.

[11:57] They made about three or four of them.

[12:00] Maybe a little bit more, but all of them are overseas.

[12:04] One is in America.

[12:07] They brought one over for Expo.

[12:09] I guess it was three years ago with the plan that I came up with.

[12:13] It was already sold.

[12:14] They were going to sell it so they didn't have to bring it back.

[12:17] I think they made four altogether.

[12:21] They sold it and Geo from Pinball Refinery decked it out.

[12:25] I'll tell you this.

[12:26] I'll be honest.

[12:27] The price they were asking for was $22,000.

[12:33] At the end of the day, to your point, what is a one-of-four machine worth with an incredible

[12:40] theme that is super fun to play that is rarer than almost anything out there?

[12:47] Today's world, $20,000 doesn't even seem like an astronomical amount considering what

[12:53] new and box pinball machines are going for these days where they make thousands of them.

[12:58] It's very true that all of a sudden that price point, and if you're a huge matrix guy,

[13:03] that's your thing.

[13:04] You got that money.

[13:06] There was no doubt they were going to sell it.

[13:09] They did.

[13:10] I got beat out because I waited too long on my offer.

[13:13] I tried to offer the guy 11,000 up front and then just hold it for a couple of months

[13:19] for the second payment because I didn't have room yet for it.

[13:22] He was like, nope.

[13:24] During my moment of hesitation, someone swooped it and bought it.

[13:29] It's okay.

[13:30] You hesitated.

[13:31] It's lost.

[13:32] Exactly.

[13:33] Buffy.

[13:34] I got a chance to see Buffy at Expo last year.

[13:38] I have to say that pin is gorgeous.

[13:42] Anyone who hasn't seen that pin, I was just so impressed by the artwork and the display.

[13:49] These machines have a quality of craftsmanship to them.

[13:55] You can definitely see where the hours are going into and these things are labors of love

[14:00] that are unlike anything you'd get from a big manufacturer these days.

[14:04] That's a great project for a couple of things about it that are really interesting.

[14:09] The two guys really driving it is Dave Nelson who goes by Nelly on Pinside and Michael Ocean

[14:15] who goes by M Ocean on Pinside.

[14:17] Those guys had worked on that machine for two or three years before they actually ever

[14:21] met.

[14:23] Everything they did was online.

[14:24] I don't even know if they ever talked on the phone.

[14:26] I'm guessing they did at some point, but maybe not.

[14:29] All the time working together, Michael who did all the coding didn't have the machine.

[14:34] He was writing the code using a simulator to do it while Dave had the machine.

[14:39] In fact, Dave is now building the second or the third machine so Michael can finally

[14:42] get his.

[14:45] They worked on it together.

[14:47] Actually, I don't remember how they connected to each other.

[14:50] I don't remember.

[14:51] I wish I did.

[14:53] They worked really together remotely.

[14:55] Woolly, wrath of Olympus, a lot of people are familiar with that.

[14:59] Similar kind of thing that Scott, the guy behind the project and Frank who did the software

[15:04] for it, met online, had never met each other until they were at X-Fo together with the

[15:10] machine.

[15:13] Are these people meeting on Pinside?

[15:16] Is there a community of people who are into Home Brew?

[15:20] I saw there's the multi-morphic form that seems to have a lot of the threads where people

[15:23] are helping each other out as they build their projects.

[15:29] Where does the Home Brew community exist within the Pimball world?

[15:33] It is that subculture within the subculture.

[15:36] There is a lot of activity on the Pimball controllers and the multi-morphic forums.

[15:41] That's been pretty active for a few years because almost everything that was being built

[15:45] was being done on P-Rock.

[15:48] There's now the fast system as well, which can be used.

[15:51] It's very similar to the P-Rock, different approach to some things.

[15:56] The fast, most of what actually happens with that is over the mission Pimball, which is

[16:00] one of the frameworks you can use.

[16:02] There's different frameworks you can use as we talked about.

[16:05] There's the, what's called the Piprock game and the Piprock game HD, which is what I

[16:09] use and have helped develop.

[16:11] There's what's called mission Pimball framework, which is a new framework that's designed

[16:15] to try and make it a little bit easier for people to get up and running.

[16:18] That works with both the P-Rock and the fast.

[16:22] The P-Rock forums is where people will announce I'm working on a project and where they come

[16:26] for help.

[16:27] There's also a Slack channel that throughout the day, people are active and people come

[16:33] there asking for help.

[16:34] They're talking about their projects, asking people, how do you do this or you're stuck

[16:38] on this?

[16:39] There's a lot of activity that happens and people are really focused on helping each other.

[16:44] It really has that sense of community.

[16:46] That's great.

[16:48] You mentioned Wolley.

[16:49] Let's talk about Rathabalimpas for a minute.

[16:53] That was a homebrew project which really wanted to see itself get into production.

[16:59] I know Scott was looking to get 100 pre-orders.

[17:02] That was sort of like the number he had where he felt if he could get that many pre-orders,

[17:07] he would be able to get that machine into production.

[17:12] Why do you think we didn't get to that number?

[17:14] The community is always asking for original IPs or always asking for rare games.

[17:19] It seemed like people really loved Wolley at the shows and they kept continuing to make

[17:24] the code better and they were great listening to people's feedback.

[17:29] What do you think the hurdles were to getting a game like that to where 100 people would

[17:33] want to go in on it?

[17:35] I think there were a few factors.

[17:38] The first one to be honest was Predator and from twofold.

[17:42] Even before Predator crash and burn, I was having conversations with Scott and we were

[17:47] talking about our different projects and saying that the pricing on that pin was crazy.

[17:52] There was just no way you could do a pin at that price and make money or not even lose

[17:57] your shirt.

[17:58] Predator was a pretty stripped down game when you really look at it was really basic,

[18:02] but that sort of set this price point.

[18:05] And Spooky obviously came in at a higher price point that was far more realistic and reasonable.

[18:11] When Scott went to look at doing this, he went into it saying, I am not going to lose

[18:15] money on this.

[18:17] I am only going to do this if it makes up economically to do it.

[18:20] And he sort of tried to look at that balancing point between how many of these machines

[18:24] start, I think I could do and get made and what does that price need to be to make that

[18:28] money.

[18:29] And that brought in that price that I think in general, people felt was just too high

[18:34] for the machine.

[18:36] And I think the problem there was, you know, didn't have LEDs and it didn't have a color

[18:42] display, but it was looking for that kind of LED premium price point.

[18:47] And I think the price point in combination with Predator blowing up and, you know,

[18:53] Papa Duke blowing up, people got a little skittish about putting money down.

[18:58] And I think those were all those factors.

[18:59] And Scott sort of said, here's the deadline.

[19:01] I mean, we have the 100 and we don't.

[19:04] And they did.

[19:05] Right.

[19:06] I know he's got back and they've made four or five more.

[19:09] So I think there are six or seven in existence right now.

[19:12] And, you know, you never know.

[19:14] I mean, it could change in the future.

[19:15] He might find a way to make it happen.

[19:18] Right.

[19:19] Right.

[19:20] And I think you bring up a good point too, because in the last couple of years, we've seen

[19:24] sort of the emergence of like the boutique pinball manufacturer, right?

[19:28] And I think a lot of, even the term home brew gets sort of attributed to the boutique

[19:35] industry.

[19:36] I know that word's been used a lot with spooky and people saying, you know,

[19:40] Americans was haunt.

[19:41] It looks, it's like a little bit of a home brew effort.

[19:43] And I think too, like those guys would agree that these are like custom, very tailored

[19:49] machines that they're only making a small volume of.

[19:52] So they do have a little bit more of a home brew feel.

[19:54] When it, where do you think, where do you think J-Pop went wrong?

[19:58] Maybe that's like the possible question to answer.

[20:02] Yeah.

[20:03] It's well, there's so many things that we're wrong in that model.

[20:07] Now, I would disagree with somebody thinks there's absolutely no way he could make it work

[20:11] with that price point and doing those few numbers of machines.

[20:15] You know, I think that what it was possible had he worked efficiently and effectively and

[20:23] on target and managed himself.

[20:25] I mean, he just burned through so much time and money trying to reengineer everything.

[20:30] And I think when people talk about that and you look at it, it was a custom cabinet and

[20:34] custom hinges and custom glass and everything had to be new and different for him.

[20:40] You know, for most people, that's the last thing I would do.

[20:42] You know, when you start to do a home brew machine, the first thing you're thinking is,

[20:47] you know, how do I minimize anything custom?

[20:49] How can I get everything stock that I possibly can and not have to reinvent something?

[20:54] You know, to recreate a trough or to recreate pop bumpers.

[20:58] There's just no benefit.

[20:59] And you know, so I think he did that.

[21:01] I think he burned a lot of bridges along the way.

[21:03] I think he couldn't make up his mind which way to go and keep trying out different technologies.

[21:08] And of course, he alienated a ton of people.

[21:10] And it's unfortunate because, you know, a run of 20 machines or 30 machines at that price point,

[21:16] as a custom could have been really interesting to see succeed if he had just been able to,

[21:21] you know, stick to a plan.

[21:22] Right. And the fact that they sold every one of Magic Girl before he even made one,

[21:28] was proof that there is a market for highly, you know, a higher craft, a higher grade of machine.

[21:37] That's limited production that is unique.

[21:41] And I think also, you know, when you look at what John was doing,

[21:45] the one thing he never seemed to do was build the whitewood first, right?

[21:50] He did the artwork first.

[21:52] And we all fall in love with Pimbal artwork.

[21:57] But there, you know, I know people who played it when they finally grabbed the game from his possession

[22:02] and brought it to the show.

[22:03] I believe it wasn't Seattle.

[22:06] It didn't even really shoot well because there was, there was posts that were blocking ramps

[22:12] and there were spinners that were blocking ramps.

[22:14] It's like he just didn't even play the game.

[22:17] He just sort of dropped a bunch of stuff on the play field and made it look beautiful,

[22:23] but it just never was a functioning Pimbal machine.

[22:25] And that's why that whole pintage of things sort of fell apart

[22:28] because they realized the game wasn't even close to being done.

[22:32] Yeah, I was having a discussion the other day with somebody about the geometry of a play field.

[22:37] And a debate whether or not how important that is.

[22:40] And this was relating to how some of the designers they've talked to really stressed the importance of,

[22:45] you know, getting that and adjusting things to the finest degree.

[22:48] And, you know, there's a spectrum around that.

[22:50] But there's no doubt thinking about how the play field is going to shoot,

[22:54] you know, to me is priority one.

[22:55] When I've done the games, the two games I've done from scratch,

[22:59] you know, that's where he kind of start off is working through those things.

[23:02] The artwork's the last thing I think about now.

[23:05] There's obviously different ways to kind of balance those two things.

[23:08] But it's early say starting with the art is probably not the right approach.

[23:13] And no doubt he had a great sense of style.

[23:16] And, but, you know, clearly he just didn't have those those priorities straight.

[23:22] Right. And it is a shame because, you know, as much as I'm deeply sad

[23:26] and by the people who lost money on the whole venture,

[23:29] I actually just got a tails of the Arabian Knights.

[23:33] It's my second pinball machine that I purchased.

[23:35] And, you know, J-pop had that aesthetic and had the ability to put magic under the play field

[23:40] or under the play under the glass.

[23:42] It's a shame that those talents are probably never going to be seen again in the pinball industry

[23:49] for at least for a long time.

[23:51] Absolutely agree. It's kind of, I think everybody wanted him to succeed.

[23:56] I agree. I agree. And I think it's made it that much harder for people

[24:00] that he failed and the way he failed.

[24:03] Well, it's interesting because there's a rumor that he might be a designer

[24:06] for the Thunderbirds pinball machine, but I cannot see that being a true rumor.

[24:11] Although, I think his name's Mike, the guy who's running the Thunderbirds project,

[24:17] he hasn't just come out and said, no, it's not John Papa Duke.

[24:20] Which is weird. You think you'd want to dissent yourself

[24:24] from that speculation immediately.

[24:25] So we'll see what happens with that.

[24:28] Have you been following that machine at all?

[24:30] A little bit, but you know, we'll just go back.

[24:32] The rumor I just recently heard actually from two different people that's come across

[24:36] was that J-pop had gotten some money.

[24:39] That was a rumor that he was floating around.

[24:41] And, you know, one person, when they heard the comment was,

[24:44] does this person know not this person?

[24:47] We try to think, does this person not know how to Google?

[24:50] How could you give him money?

[24:52] But that's a rumor I suspect it was probably more of an April Fool's joke

[24:55] that maybe has lingered on or something.

[24:57] Right. You know, I think with John's case, I mean,

[25:00] it's, money's never, it wasn't really the issue as much as it was,

[25:03] just like the inefficiency and the inability to manufacture.

[25:06] I mean, whenever you hear Gary Stern talk,

[25:10] it's always, we know how to manufacture.

[25:13] We could, we just decide to build Pimbal,

[25:16] but we're set up for manufacturing.

[25:18] And that's an interesting, let's segue to that too, Josh,

[25:20] because I think when people are thinking about Home Brew

[25:24] and building a Home Brew machine,

[25:27] manufacturing a one-off is not easy, right?

[25:31] I mean, there's a lot of pieces and parts and things that go into a Pimbal machine.

[25:36] And so let's talk about, because we talked about the re-themeding.

[25:40] So if we're going to, if we're going to build a Home Brew from the bottom up,

[25:44] and we even want to manufacture that in our house,

[25:47] or in our basement or our workshop,

[25:51] what are the steps? Where do you start?

[25:54] How do you get all the parts?

[25:55] Like, what's through like the process to building one from the ground up?

[26:00] I was just saying, you know, you start thinking about the design.

[26:03] Almost everybody who plays Pim, there's certain things they like

[26:06] in the designs of the machines they like.

[26:09] You know, when I was sitting down to do my first game,

[26:11] I knew I wanted to have a fast interloop,

[26:14] and I knew I wanted a three-flipper game.

[26:16] There were certain attributes I knew that I wanted it.

[26:19] I wanted a game that had flow and speed to it.

[26:22] So I started sketching that out just, you know,

[26:24] sitting in front of the TV or the piece of paper and a pencil,

[26:27] and you start to draw, and you start to flesh it from there.

[26:30] Then you start to say, okay, I've got some ideas.

[26:32] Then you start to think about those things.

[26:34] Like, where am I going to get the parts?

[26:36] You know, where am I going to get a wrap?

[26:37] And you have a couple of options.

[26:39] You could try making your own ramp,

[26:41] or you could look for an existing ramp from some other game.

[26:45] That's available, either, you know, a used ramp,

[26:48] or you know, there's plenty of ramps being made.

[26:49] You said, you know what?

[26:50] All right, I'm going to incorporate that to help me figure out

[26:52] how to do my design.

[26:54] So depending on your willingness to create certain things,

[26:58] you have to compromise with what are the things

[27:00] that are available for you to work with.

[27:02] And fortunately, there is a lot of parts to work with,

[27:06] and pinball life, Terry recently put a home,

[27:09] a homebrew section up on the site,

[27:13] was a lot of the things that homebrew guys need.

[27:15] And he's actually gotten stuff made,

[27:17] where there was stuff just not available to help.

[27:20] So, you know, single drop target,

[27:23] and he's got a trough up there now.

[27:25] And they're adding stuff all the time.

[27:27] And Scott and E.C., who works for him,

[27:30] is a homebrewer himself.

[27:31] So that's sort of a benefit in getting more stuff made,

[27:35] and available to help.

[27:36] But ramps is always one of the big challenges.

[27:39] And you can make your own ramps, like I said.

[27:42] There's one machine nightmare before Christmas.

[27:46] I don't know if it's nine-year before Christmas.

[27:47] It's cardboard ramps.

[27:49] And he's had cardboard ramps now for over a year,

[27:52] and they're holding up pretty well.

[27:53] And at some point, I know he's going to try and get the made.

[27:56] And that's a challenging part.

[27:59] Willie, they had theirs vacuum formed.

[28:02] They made the molds themselves out of wood.

[28:05] And it felt somebody local to vacuum form.

[28:07] So that's a part of it is figuring out the parts you can get,

[28:11] because that impacts a little bit of what you're going to do.

[28:14] And depending on your skills, now in my case,

[28:16] I made some of my own backs.

[28:17] I bent metal.

[28:19] They're not going out on location.

[28:20] They'll hold up pretty well.

[28:22] So you do some creative things like that as well.

[28:24] You figure out how to make those things.

[28:26] But that becomes a factor.

[28:27] And again, if you look at predator,

[28:29] really everything but the ramps on there was pretty much stock parts.

[28:34] OK.

[28:35] But a lot of people like to do different things.

[28:38] There's a guy in the community who makes metal ramps and rails and returns.

[28:45] He makes those for folks.

[28:46] His pricing is pretty reasonable.

[28:48] So you'll see a lot of the games have worked with him

[28:51] to get parts made for their machine.

[28:53] So there's things like that that people have done

[28:55] within the community for the one-off parts.

[28:58] Now, is there a program that people can use that

[29:02] where they can design their machine virtually and shoot it virtually

[29:06] before they move to physical parts and whitewoods?

[29:11] There have been some people who've done the visual pinball stuff.

[29:14] But not too many of the home groups have started that way.

[29:16] Now, Willie started that way.

[29:18] It was actually a visual pin game that they then made into a real one.

[29:23] There are some people who model it in that type of environment.

[29:26] But most of the machines, as I think about it,

[29:28] did not take that approach.

[29:30] OK.

[29:31] Even the Big Lebowski, they did some 3D modeling of their design.

[29:36] But I don't think they ever built it and played it that way.

[29:40] Now, when I'm working on a game where a lot of the guys see this,

[29:42] we use a GUI tool, a graphic interface that basically shows our play field

[29:47] and that we're basically clicking on to move the ball

[29:49] and trigger the switches as you're working through the software.

[29:53] Because even if you had the machine there,

[29:54] you're typically not going to be shooting the ball around.

[29:56] When you're working on developing,

[29:58] you want to get the switches and work through your code that way.

[30:01] So a lot of people do it that way.

[30:03] And a lot of your game development gets done before you might even have your

[30:08] machine playable and vice versa.

[30:11] I've seen people who build the whole machine before they ever touched the software.

[30:15] I see people do all the software first before they physically start building the machine.

[30:20] But in between.

[30:22] That's interesting to think that you could even do this software before

[30:28] the machine. But I guess, I guess if you have it all designed out and you see it,

[30:33] you can kind of start to map out the code where we're going to,

[30:37] you know, this is the mode and you have to hit this and then hit that.

[30:39] Absolutely.

[30:40] Design all that.

[30:41] You have to have a sketch of your play field design.

[30:44] You can start to work through that and write the code and write the rules.

[30:49] So some people when they're starting off, the first thing to do is write your rule sheet.

[30:52] I hope to read a rule sheet.

[30:55] To me, and I think it's right or wrong, it's the approach I take is write the rules.

[30:59] What are the modes?

[31:00] How are they going to interact?

[31:01] What are the rules?

[31:02] What are the features of your game?

[31:04] And if you're kind of doing that and picturing your play field at the same time,

[31:08] you know, that sort of starts to come together.

[31:11] And that question, even there's a machine underway right now called a total annihilation.

[31:17] It's the awesome Scott and E.C. is doing this machine.

[31:19] It's actually an 80s error kind of a game.

[31:22] He's the big 80s guy.

[31:23] So it's a brand new game.

[31:25] He's not even going to have a dot matrix in it.

[31:27] I think he's still planning to go with Alpha New Merrick.

[31:32] But he had the vision for his game in his play field.

[31:36] And it's looking great.

[31:37] He's done an incredible job.

[31:38] And there's detailed, I think.

[31:41] Scott and E.C. dot com might be where he blogs about it.

[31:45] But he hasn't really done much.

[31:47] If anything on the software yet, really only a little bit of the rules,

[31:50] like the basic ideas for it.

[31:52] So it's kind of a very interesting approach in that regard.

[31:55] Right.

[31:56] Well, the more you think about it too,

[31:59] it kind of does make more sense to figure out your modes and the storyline and the narrative

[32:05] of your machine first.

[32:07] And then design your play field to know like what you need to tell that story.

[32:15] Because it's interesting when I think about a game like the Hobbit, for example,

[32:20] where there's a lot of coding that's going into that game with a lot of modes and whatnot.

[32:26] And what comes first, like it's like chicken or the egg, like the code or the shot layout.

[32:30] Because I know that the community is definitely divided on what's the most important thing.

[32:36] Is it shot layout or code?

[32:38] And the classic games have the combination of both, right?

[32:42] That have both rewarding shots and incredible code.

[32:47] But getting that right and that balance right

[32:49] seems to be somewhat tricky.

[32:52] What's your experience been with figuring that balance out?

[32:57] Well, I think there's that kind of that middle piece that goes with those too.

[33:00] Because clearly we've seen cases where the play field was designed before they knew what the theme was going to be.

[33:07] There's games you can look at and it could be anything.

[33:10] And I think that's true.

[33:11] Of a lot of games, where some cases you look at a machine that was clearly designed from start to finish

[33:17] with a particular theme in mind.

[33:21] And so the interesting question where those things cross is,

[33:24] does a great machine require that the play field truly heavily incorporate the theme

[33:31] versus having a great playing machine with a great rule set?

[33:35] But maybe the play field isn't perfectly identified.

[33:39] Even if you look at Lord of the Rings and you sort of, you take out the ring

[33:45] as the big toy in the middle, they threw some toys on there.

[33:49] And I'm not saying which way it was designed, but it's a great shooting game.

[33:53] It's a great rule set and the rule integration with the theme is really good.

[33:58] But I wouldn't necessarily say it's integrated perfectly into the design of the play field.

[34:03] Right. I think Game of Thrones comes to mind when we talk about a machine like that where

[34:09] it seems like it's got natural flow, but that layout could be used regardless.

[34:16] I mean, it's, I would give an example of a game where you think like the play field really

[34:24] reflects the world or the universe they're trying to create.

[34:28] Where like white water, is that like,

[34:31] what is that?

[34:32] Yes, white water is a great example because of, you know, with the ramp with the rapids,

[34:36] the way the upper play field's done, the whirlpool.

[34:38] Right.

[34:39] So you really do have that integration.

[34:41] Yeah, as you started asking the question, I was thinking fish tails a little bit with the

[34:44] shot in the front. Sure.

[34:46] The toys are very incorporated into the layout.

[34:51] You know, good gopher is from the standpoint of how the golf was implemented.

[34:55] Pretty much that wasn't going to be too many other themes.

[34:59] But there certainly games we could all point to that are that, you know, we're the other way.

[35:04] Right. Right.

[35:06] What, what's your favorite part of designing a machine and what's your least favorite part?

[35:15] Yeah, I spend an awful lot of time, that's thing it's my favorite part.

[35:18] Basically, a lot of time literally just staring at the play field,

[35:22] staring at the machine, thinking about the rules, kind of trying to come up with those ideas.

[35:28] I think that creative part of creating the rules of the game is one of the enjoyable parts

[35:34] when you come up with that idea of how to incorporate something into the rules or,

[35:38] you know, the animations or sounds to put with it when those things come together.

[35:44] I think I enjoy that.

[35:46] I'd say wiring machine gets a little tedious.

[35:49] That's what I always look forward to.

[35:51] Anybody who's done a play field swap, well, this is kind of taking that to the next level,

[35:56] especially because you don't have a wiring harness.

[35:59] You know, it's, and you know, one of the things that's interesting with that is

[36:04] I talked about Scott's project and Scott's project looks like it's a third version whitewood,

[36:10] as far as the way the wiring is done.

[36:11] It looks perfectly because he really planned everything out very thoroughly

[36:17] before he did each step.

[36:18] And the flip side is somebody like myself where if you've seen the minions project

[36:24] where it's sort of just trying things as you go and wiring things up.

[36:28] And a lot of the first whitewoods you see from a home broom machine,

[36:32] the underside looks like a bowl of spaghetti.

[36:35] And you also don't have wires that are striped.

[36:37] It was like striped for own wires, you know, by white wire and you use a magic marker to put

[36:42] a stripe on it.

[36:44] And that's what the biggest pain is dealing with wiring.

[36:48] Right.

[36:49] Take that for granted.

[36:50] So I don't think anybody enjoys that part of it too much.

[36:54] Oh, god, yeah, no, it's um,

[36:57] whenever I open up a pinball machine and just show people what's underneath it,

[37:02] to the non-pinball person, they just look terrified of all that's in the machine.

[37:08] Now the newer machines seem to be simplifying a little bit of that.

[37:11] But, um, do you, is there like, is there like anything else you would love to see like

[37:18] invented or brought to the marketplace for the home brew guys that would help even further

[37:23] simplify the, uh, the, the art of building a pinball machine?

[37:28] Oh, you know, it's an interesting question.

[37:31] Uh, you know, some of the things that in the wire, as we were talking about it,

[37:35] one of the things Scott did was he actually made custom lamp boards, uh, for his machine,

[37:40] which dramatically improves wiring and makes it look neat.

[37:42] So, you know, things like that.

[37:44] But I think that the challenge is the custom ramps and mechanisms is one of the biggest

[37:50] challenges that limits people's creativity.

[37:53] Now, 3D printers have obviously been a great thing to come along in the last few years.

[37:58] Help people create various toys and things for their games.

[38:02] So that's helped a lot.

[38:03] We have to do some kind of interesting things with that.

[38:06] I'm kind of using a little bit of that right now and a couple of things I'm doing in one of my

[38:09] machines.

[38:11] And I think over time the other thing we'll see is on the software side,

[38:16] it'll continue to improve to make it easier for people to, to jump in and do this.

[38:22] But it's never going to be super, super easy.

[38:25] You have to have the patience and be willing to learn, or if you really want to

[38:28] custom machine, as you'll find some other people who want that same theme as you,

[38:33] who have different skill sets and partners together.

[38:36] You know, I'd love to see people on Pinside saying, hey, I want to do a sign fell pen,

[38:41] you know, I need, I'm looking for a programmer and I'm looking for an artist.

[38:45] So, I'm just trying to get more games made.

[38:48] I'm glad you brought that up because one of the questions I have, which is,

[38:53] probably like on the, on a lot of people's minds, is this notion that there's a theme out there

[39:00] that I love that no one makes a pinball machine for. And I would love to sort of either begin

[39:08] the process of making my own or commission someone to help make a theme for me that would be my

[39:13] dream theme. So for, for example, there's two themes that come to my mind that I would just love

[39:18] to have. One is a generation one Transformers pinball machine, which might make sense to

[39:24] re-theme the Stern Transformers game. But the game that I really wanted to re-theme into a G1

[39:33] is a, is a judge dread. Because I think that that big planet would be the perfect unicron,

[39:41] and it would make perfect sense to re-theme that. Now, is like within the community, could someone

[39:47] come into the community and say, hey, I'm looking to do this theme? Is there anyone out there that

[39:52] would like help bring it to fruition? And do you think people would take an assignment like that?

[39:57] And how much money do you think you'd have to put in front of someone to help sort of build a

[40:02] little skunk works team to make it a real thing? Well, it probably would get to, hey, obviously,

[40:09] you can find somebody who wants that team and is willing to put in. Because at some point,

[40:14] it becomes a labor of love if you're going to do a one-off or even a five-off. If you get three or

[40:19] four guys who say, boy, yeah, let's do a Transformers and take a judge dread and convert it, that'd

[40:27] be it. If to find somebody to write the software for it, it would depend whether or not

[40:32] highly would divide and conquer. So for example, if somebody came to me and wanted to do a machine

[40:39] I might say, okay, I'm going to take my existing code and re-themed. So you go get me these animations,

[40:45] these graphics, and these pieces, and maybe it's kind of not too bad to do it. We drop it in because

[40:51] we're not going to completely recreate everything from scratch. So it really depends a little bit on

[40:56] how much of a starting point you have. I always saw that I could take one of my machines and convert it

[41:01] to dozens and dozens of different themes by basically replacing the various assets

[41:09] of me. Okay. So I think that's one's really combination of those things. But certainly there have been

[41:16] people who've been approached to have done custom machines and you've been asked, hey, well, you code

[41:21] this for me. I know that's gone on and there's some projects underway or there might be people

[41:27] doing that. So it happens, you step forward and you ask and you never know who you'll find.

[41:32] Yeah, I think eventually you offer enough money, you can get anything made, and it's world-budded,

[41:37] just, yeah, it comes down to the point where, you know, like let's take like Buffy, for example.

[41:43] I mean, Buffy's a beautiful game. I'm sure they're getting approached that shows for people who

[41:47] are like, can you make me one? Absolutely. And you know, for the homebrew guy who makes a one-off,

[41:57] there's got to be that dilemma of the legal limits or the legal right they have to make

[42:05] multiple versions of it, right? Like even like selling four matrixes under the tables.

[42:10] You know, I don't think the, you know, Warner Brothers is going to come after them for such a small

[42:14] number, but it's still technically illegal to make money off of like an IP that you're not paying

[42:20] for the license. So is there ever that concern even with the one-off guys that like, if I get too

[42:25] much publicity or awareness for this thing that they could come after me? I don't see people are too

[42:31] concerned about people coming after them, but that doesn't mean that they're necessarily want to

[42:36] go screaming from the rooftops. Now, at the same time, I know Sarah Michelle Gullard tweeted once

[42:42] about the Buffy Pimball machine. So, you know, that was out there. She heard about itself pictures of it

[42:47] and tweeted about it. So they're out there, but there is a line between when you start to, if you start

[42:53] to sell them. And again, if you have a group of four or five guys who are doing it as a fan project

[42:58] and doing it for themselves, you know, nobody's going to get into trouble for that. You know,

[43:03] once you start selling it, you start to open that door. And you know, if you look at Kevin with

[43:08] Predator, the reality is that if he actually gotten the machines made and distributed, you know,

[43:15] he probably would have avoided, you know, at all blowing up in his face. Because it wasn't that,

[43:21] it was going to really catch, you know, Fox's eye on that, so somebody really put it in front of them

[43:27] that it was going to happen. And at that point, they were going to put it up with it. And they were

[43:31] going to shut them down. So, you know, but that starts to push that limit of what you can do.

[43:35] Yeah. So, like, five or six, I don't think they're going to get in trouble. You start promoting it

[43:39] and advertising it. You're not going to do that. Right. And I think, you know, when it came to matrix,

[43:46] I, when I was following that thread, I know a lot of guys were pissed off that they wouldn't make

[43:51] a kit and sell a kit. Because, you know, everyone who had a Johnny pneumatic was like bummed out

[43:57] because they all would have converted it over to matrix. But, you know, like, they can't do that.

[44:02] Like, they can't sell a kit for matrix. And Predator, I think everyone agrees that they would have

[44:08] gotten away with it. And they were ready to go into production. And the guys, there's that little

[44:13] group of people that got their money back and then went to Fox and like whistle blew the whole

[44:17] project, which ultimately led to it getting shut down. But it, like, it doesn't make what Kevin

[44:24] was doing any better. The guys are total scum for what he's done lately. I mean, he's, I mean,

[44:30] where is everyone's money? I mean, that whole situation is sad because it didn't just like blow up.

[44:36] But, you know, then he went on and said he promised that everyone would get a refund. And then he's at,

[44:41] like, auctions, buying different games and seemingly spending all the money for his own personal use.

[44:47] So it's just, you know, but I think the silver lining and all of that is just it's created more of a

[44:52] buyer beware environment within the pinball world, which was necessary because guys were just throwing

[44:59] money at projects without saying. I mean, obviously we had two big projects blow up. But,

[45:05] and if you look at, you know, there've been other ones that have been very successful. You know, spooky

[45:09] spins successful, you know, Dutch pinballs, you know, the Bob 2.0 has been very successful. You know,

[45:15] the La Bouse clearly seems like it's moving along. Yeah, obviously it's had some bumps in the roads as

[45:20] you would expect. So, you know, there's been a lot more successes than failures. And the unfortunate

[45:25] thing with Kevin and, and Predator, and it was what's my boggling to me was the fact that he went out

[45:32] and then got a legitimate license with the Mythbusters guys to do experts of dangerous. So, you know,

[45:38] he knew he was building his company on a lie, but there was going to try and turn legit in that.

[45:44] And that was kind of a, and I'm not sure how he thought he was going to pull that one off

[45:49] and have it not completely blow up as it did. And I think it's the case where I think he thought

[45:54] he was okay when he started misinterpreted some things. And then he got out of control. And rather

[45:59] than putting the brakes on and saying, hey, well, I can't actually do this. He just dug himself

[46:05] deeper and deeper. And you know, we all know what happened. And, you know, it's terrible for the people

[46:10] who've lost their money. Right. Well, I think, you know, the last two years, since 2014, there's sort of

[46:16] been, you know, the J-pop, the Skippy, did not help the industry. And I think Ben Heck says it best.

[46:23] He's like, it's not good when that money just evaporates because then it can't go anywhere else.

[46:28] It can't go to get woolly made. It can't go to another boutique that, you know, could use some

[46:33] pre-order dollars to get off the ground and that money's gone, right? And it creates an environment of

[46:40] skepticism and cynicism, you know, for the other manufacturers out there that actually do have a

[46:46] business model that's sound, that do have a license that's approved. So it's, you know, it's,

[46:53] it has like shrinking the play field a little bit. And you know, you look at a company like

[46:58] Stern right now. And it is amazing that they have nine games on the line right now.

[47:03] Which is pretty incredible to think, you know, here we are in 2016. And one company has nine

[47:12] games on the line. I mean, if we were to say that 10 years ago, they were, they probably had one

[47:16] on the line throughout the entire year. So, yeah, it is pretty crazy. And I think the thing with

[47:23] the, with J-pop and the other pieces, you wonder, would woolly have gotten made if those guys had

[47:28] itself destructed? Yeah. Where people have been willing to put money down, would there have been

[47:32] more excitement around it? And what other projects? And I know there were a few that people were

[47:38] thinking about looking to do and to, you know, go down that road that, you know, the brakes were put

[47:43] on because it was like, whoa, you know, the water's been poisoned. Right. Well, I think, you know,

[47:49] it's interesting because a hundred people, I think, were in on Raza with J-pop. So that would have

[47:55] got Scott to his number. And, you know, I think with, with woolly too, it's, whenever you have an

[47:59] original IP, it's always going to be a little bit more difficult. I think John, John had the pedigree

[48:05] and then the background to sort of make people go in on it with him. But, you know, that, I think

[48:12] that errors over. I think right now, people are realizing that, you know, if you're going to make a

[48:18] machine, figure out how to make it and then set your price and then make it available to consumers

[48:25] to buy worse. I mean, we may still be like a little bit like in the middle ground of that happening

[48:30] across the board. I still think, you know, some companies are struggling to get to manufacturing.

[48:36] And it hopefully, you know, we see Dutch get the games off the door soon. It sounds like they're

[48:43] almost there. Have you, do you have any, do you know, people at Dutch, do you know, like, I do.

[48:48] I haven't talked to Barry too much lately or Koon. I see Koon occasionally. He's in one of our,

[48:55] you know, groups are we we're chatting all the time. Koon's the, the developer, the software developer.

[49:00] And every time we see him, I figure, oh my god, they let him out of the room. They're actually

[49:04] seeing the sunlight. Because I'm sure he's chained to his desk all the time, coding.

[49:09] You know, they're clearly moving along. You know, they shifted gears along the way. They're

[49:12] obviously working with a third party to do the assembly, which is clearly the way to go. I think

[49:17] people hope that spooky sort of becomes potentially the, you know, builder for other boutique machines.

[49:23] And you know, maybe we'll see people leverage what Dutch pinball has done in that regard. Because

[49:28] I think that will help as well. If people know there's a way to get machines built for them,

[49:35] whether it's, you know, small runs or large or runs, and certainly impressive what Stern's done.

[49:40] And I know some people have obviously talked to Stern as well, but they won't do anything unless it's

[49:44] a, obviously a pretty large quantity of machines to be worth their while. Yeah, I mean, I don't blame

[49:51] Stern. I mean, I've said it over and over like they're, they're, they have no incentive to help

[49:58] fuel the boutique industry, right? I mean, they're in this on a competitive level. And I think there

[50:03] is a notion that all pinball is good pinball and all pinball companies shouldn't brace all pinball

[50:09] manufacturing. But that's not the real, that's how Stern has survived or sees it. But Gary is, Gary

[50:16] says he's a manufacturer. I think if there's money in it form, he would do it, but it has to be

[50:22] worth it. Right. Yeah. Or they're, yeah, ordering just a hundred parts for him is not, is probably not

[50:29] the market he's looking for. He wants to order at least 500, maybe a thousand. I don't know,

[50:34] it is like bottom line is. So interesting. So let's, let's talk Josh about like, well, first of all,

[50:42] we haven't even mentioned like what are your two games that you're, you're working on or that,

[50:46] that is in your stable right now? So the first game I did, which I guess at this point I'd say is 98

[50:52] percent complete. Again, maybe I'll get it to 99 one day. It is actually a family theme, and it's

[50:59] about my family. You know, when you're going to tell your wife, hey, I'm thinking of doing a

[51:03] custom pinball machine and building it from scratch and she looks at you like you're crazy. You say,

[51:08] well, it's going to be about our family, you know, it's a, it's a celebration of us. How does she say

[51:13] that? So it's a family theme, and part of it was at a couple of different ideas or where I could

[51:20] take it further. And it's actually had a fairly elaborate and deep rule set around collecting the

[51:26] members of the family and each family member has two modes, which match to activities they like to do.

[51:34] So it's kind of a way to incorporate different things. There's an aspect of the game where

[51:39] each family member has to get something in the mail, which is really a mystery award or it's

[51:43] combined with that and some other features. So that was the first machine I did. And it was

[51:49] fun because I was able to, you know, personalize it for aspects of our family, including our dog. We

[51:54] have two modes for our dog as well. And when I did that machine, the first year I had it at Expo,

[52:02] it was a regular standard dot matrix display. And then the next year I brought it back, it was a

[52:09] larger color display. And that was a big change between those two years. And it did a lot of work with

[52:15] Michael Ocean and adding better capabilities to the framework you use on the P-Rock for doing color

[52:22] display work. We had talked with Koon, what they were doing with Dutch pinball and Eric, what he

[52:27] did with cactus Canyon to make that enhancement. And then this, then this past year I finally put

[52:33] art on it. So as we were joking about I had the play field, I had the rules, I had it coded, I had

[52:37] no art. And then finally this past year for Expo, I finally had the art on it. The second machine

[52:45] that I started on is a gambling themed machine. I call it casino. And I was trying to think

[52:52] about different themes to do. And my brother kept pushing on me to do a gambling theme and a gambling

[52:56] theme. And I really wasn't sure it was the right way to go. And you know, I was thinking about it.

[53:01] And then I actually came up with some ideas for a couple of toys. And because I came up with

[53:05] these ideas for toys, I really liked strangely enough, that convinced me to do that theme.

[53:13] And I saw the, the roulette toy you made. It was pretty awesome. And then there's the dice.

[53:19] What toys are in the casino game right now? So the, yeah, so the first game that I had was when

[53:25] we were all kids, we played the game trouble. I had like that little bubble you'd press and it would

[53:29] roll the dice. So I thought it'd be really cool to have real dice in the machine. So the idea was

[53:35] to kind of create that with casino dice. And then there's a webcam that sits above it that reads

[53:41] the dice. So the computer is able to look at the dots on the dice and read it and kind of tie that

[53:46] in. So you get that kind of real world thing because pinballs about real world. It says that

[53:51] was kind of a cool way to capture that. And it's kind of cool. And it works. I think I'd

[53:57] sent you a clip and I'll probably put it up on Pinside shortly of the software when I was doing

[54:02] some testing on it, just running through roll after roll after roll to see if the software could

[54:08] properly read the dice. And so that was sort of fun. And then the roulette wheel is actually the

[54:15] funny thing is I started working on casino. I had never seen high roll or casino. I didn't really

[54:20] know about it. And it's funny. I know tons of people with huge collections. Nobody had it. So it's

[54:26] funny. Long after I started work, I finally saw it one day. I'm like, oh my god.

[54:30] And that has a roulette wheel. And as I told Keith Johnson, my roulette wheel is better. He gave me a

[54:35] dirty look when I told him that. But the way the roulette wheel works in my machine is you you enable

[54:42] roulette as the mode. And there's a lock that'll kick the ball up into the wheel. And then there's

[54:48] a magnet that will keep the ball spinning in the upper part of the wheel because we all love magnets.

[54:54] And while it's doing that, a second ball gets put into play that is then used to place the bats.

[54:59] And all the ramps and shots map to numbers on the roulette wheel. I'm pretty sure you're again.

[55:06] We're seeing no one I'm talking about. Yeah. I just lost a lot of my invaguses weekend. It was great.

[55:13] So anyway, people, those two words only go together when it's with Vegas. I know. I got killed.

[55:18] Anyway, go on. So the you place your bats and then the the ball gets released. It spins a few more

[55:25] times. It falls into the wheel, which then detects which number it is. And then the ball gets dropped

[55:31] out. And at that point, you're a multi ball. We're the shots that map that color are your jackpots.

[55:37] And the particular shot it landed and becomes your super jackpot. So you know, it's sort of when I

[55:42] came up with that, I was like, oh, I got to do a gambling thing. I just between those two toys.

[55:48] I really liked it. And now I'm working on the third toy, which is a mini play field for handling

[55:54] the card games. We're handling poker and blackjack. Of course, card games and drop targets,

[56:02] I wish to go really well together. What out of all the there's so much. There's so much stuff

[56:10] coming out this year. What games in 2016? Have you played Ghostbusters? What do you what do you

[56:16] most excited by in terms of what's coming out from the different manufacturers are out there?

[56:21] I was up at MGC last weekend. And the lines for both Hobbit and Ghostbusters were pretty

[56:28] long. So I kind of bided my time and I did get to get a game on each. And there's such different games.

[56:36] Obviously from their look, the Ghostbusters is, you know, it's bright, it's colorful,

[56:42] it's has that feel of the current stirons as well with that sort of that brightness to it.

[56:49] And it seemed to flow nicely. It seemed to be some interesting shots on it. I liked it. I

[56:54] can certainly see why people are loving it so far. The artwork is beautiful. But the shots seem

[57:02] to feel good and seem very gratifying. Played the Hobbit as well. I don't have that same

[57:09] feel of the flow of that game. I find that there's two ramp shots in the middle or kind of similar.

[57:17] It seemed like I couldn't get the right feel for it. Couldn't quite figure out what that upper

[57:22] right flipper was kind of really doing for me there. The art, the animations and stuff are great.

[57:31] The rules from what I played. It seemed like there's a lot there. But it wasn't necessarily a machine.

[57:38] I came away from saying I've got to buy this machine. I think that one's a hard one. I've

[57:44] mentioned this before. It's a hard one to sort of play on location and sort of get blown away.

[57:50] Buy it yet just because I think there's either more to come with the code or it's just hard at the

[57:55] shows to get immersed in it because of what's going on. Whether it's you can't hear it as well as

[58:01] you want to hear it or you can't sort of get engaged with it. Ghostbusters is a complete opposite.

[58:07] I think Ghostbusters to me reminds me of Nintendo Wii when it first came out. You can jump on that

[58:13] machine and in the first 30 seconds, I need to own Wii 10s. Even if it doesn't

[58:20] have as much depth coming out in you, it's just the colors of it, the speed of it, the shots of it,

[58:26] everything sort of immediately sort of reminds you of what you love about pinball.

[58:31] So I think that's why I think Ghostbusters has, like that initial response has been so positive

[58:37] around that machine. I agree. The thing is with Hobbit, over time we'll find out,

[58:42] does that depth really create a great experience? I agree. At a show like that, really hard to

[58:48] assess a machine. You're right. You really can't hear it. You're not able to get a couple of

[58:52] games in a row, typically, there's a long line and you don't get the feel to really take it in.

[58:58] Like I said, first reaction was Ghostbusters and you grabs your attention. The Hobbit not so much.

[59:04] I'm certainly looking forward to hopefully seeing the P3 go into production.

[59:09] I think that that platform is just really cool. Lexi light speed. This was the first time I really

[59:16] got to play a couple of games on it. It was just sort of once I got adjusted to it. There's

[59:23] sort of an adjustment with the P3 because of the way the inserts, because they're not inserts.

[59:29] It's the screen and the way the arrows and stuff are indicated. It kind of takes you a gamer

[59:34] too for your mind to adjust a little bit to looking for that on the display. But that game has

[59:41] really come a long way as far as the rules around it, what's going on, the animations.

[59:47] They had the new one there. Canon Lagoon.

[59:53] Which I think you talked about on the podcast. It was just something very addicting about that game.

[01:00:00] Again, would I want that as the one machine in my home, Canon Lagoon? No, because it's kind of

[01:00:05] a thin game. I think that's what's interesting about that platform. When we have other families

[01:00:11] over, I could see that if I had a P3, which someday I hope to have one, that'd probably be one of

[01:00:16] the games I'd have in there when families are coming over because people can immediately understand

[01:00:20] it. And what's it that? And I think that's going to be very interesting to see how that platform

[01:00:27] shakes out. Right. And it's going to come to a point for Jerry and the team where

[01:00:34] the rubber is going to have to meet the road and he's going to just have to take real orders on it

[01:00:39] and see what he gets. Because I definitely think there's a lot of potential there. And it's just

[01:00:45] going to come down to how serious are people about going in on it. Because there's a lot of

[01:00:51] enthusiasm. But the way he's doing the preorder list where it's just your email and there's no money

[01:00:57] down, it's going to be hard for him to gauge what's a real order and what's not. But it seems like

[01:01:03] they're coming close to that finish line where they're ready to take orders and go into production.

[01:01:11] I would say in the next six months, I'd be surprised if they go past that.

[01:01:14] I think that, you know, whatever the production, I know his plan is he's using a third party to do

[01:01:21] a contract manufacturer to assemble the games. He's not going to try and build that himself.

[01:01:25] Jesus Mark, I know is to find people who know how to do this type of thing to do it. But I'm sure

[01:01:32] there's going to be a ramp up. So I don't think there's any doubt that he will sell, you know, the

[01:01:36] first X machines easily coming off the line. And then the question will be is, you know, how many

[01:01:42] can he keep selling and how many new games come along? You know, I could argue you have a big

[01:01:47] collection. Why would it you want to have one of these? You know, it's just a really cool technology.

[01:01:51] It's it is physical, real pinball. And I can make that argument. I could argue too. If you had a

[01:01:56] really small place, you only had room for a couple of machines, that could be really appealing to

[01:02:00] have something that has so many different aspects to it. Right. It's such a revolutionary thing.

[01:02:06] I think it's going to take time for all of us to fully feel comfortable with it. Right. Right.

[01:02:12] Yeah. And it's it's hard because I'm you know, I've played it. I've enjoyed it. I think for most

[01:02:18] consumers, Lexi, you know, is Lexi good enough at this stage to get people to go in? And I think

[01:02:26] it's more than Lexi though, right. It's it's understanding the platform and the package that you get.

[01:02:30] And I think to your point, two jobs, like when I have people come over that are not into pinball,

[01:02:35] it'd be nice to have a simple game that people can jump on because no one is no one gives a damn

[01:02:42] about getting through the walking dead code when they've never played pinball or not, you know,

[01:02:48] skilled at it. There's very little games out there that people can jump on and enjoy or just sort of

[01:02:54] get the pleasure of flipping with what's coming out.

[01:02:59] People don't even realize there's rules. You know, how often do you talk to somebody you're showing

[01:03:03] the pinball? They don't really understand that there's actually these rules and objectives. I mean,

[01:03:07] that's the first thing people need to understand. And you know, when you do look at, you know,

[01:03:11] Canon Lagoon, it's okay. There are these ships moving across. There's flashing these five flashing

[01:03:17] arrows. It's a very basic game. And you know, I watched some people play it at MGC and people just

[01:03:22] walked up and loved it. They didn't have to think. All right. I'm still waiting for someone to

[01:03:27] design a game, like a video game, when you put it on easy, like the, like you can't drain on the sides.

[01:03:34] You know, like a post goes up that is the very easy level of the game. So these people can like

[01:03:41] focus on just not running down the middle. But I think you're right. And it's an interesting

[01:03:45] question. So, I think that's the thing about Canon Lagoon is that it is that way because it's time

[01:03:50] based. Right. All right. You don't have to worry about draining, you know. And so your game lasts

[01:03:56] whatever it is. It's 30 seconds. And if you complete the level, it starts over. And so I think

[01:04:01] some people people are going to absolutely hate that. Do you actually hate that? And others go,

[01:04:07] well, I just like, and that kind of annoys me. I'll explain why. I think there's there's too much

[01:04:12] emphasis on, on, I think on code these days. And let me explain what I mean by that. There's

[01:04:19] these pinball was never intended to have the depth and the level and the complexity of code

[01:04:26] that the hardcore player is demanding these days. The guy who has it in his home collection wants

[01:04:33] to make sure that the machine, you know, is challenging enough to where he can play it for months

[01:04:38] on end and still not get to Valinor or whatever the final wizard mode is. And there's so much

[01:04:44] emphasis on that that I think the majority of people who play though are not that hardcore person.

[01:04:54] And so I think what excuse a lot of my opinions about this is I'm on Pinside where you get a lot

[01:05:01] more of the hardcore fan base. And so those guys demand code be really far along. But for, I would say

[01:05:11] for the majority people who play pinball, they don't care. I think, you know, when you look back

[01:05:17] at some of the 90s games that, you know, there was a balance there around getting people to

[01:05:25] multi-ball. People who don't understand pinball, the best thing in the world that can happen for them

[01:05:29] is to get to multi-ball. And what I designed, you know, my first game, particularly, I made sure that,

[01:05:34] you know, that getting to multi-ball was something reasonably doable by somebody who, you didn't

[01:05:39] necessarily know what they were doing. That they could get there if they could keep the ball and play

[01:05:43] long enough. Because I think probably that's that first thing where they feel that accomplishment.

[01:05:47] And if you have a couple of modes and they're humors and they're fun, and you know, the Pinside

[01:05:51] that are really captured that, but there was enough gaps to challenge somebody to go all the way.

[01:05:57] But you're absolutely right. In a home environment, people wanted to go that much further.

[01:06:01] For some. No, I think most people who do, and you know, nowadays it's a criticism environment.

[01:06:08] And I've been talking about this recently with the Hobbit. You know, sometimes it takes two years,

[01:06:14] three years before these games are finally like the code is finally done. And it, you know,

[01:06:22] for some people they find a satisfaction in that. Where every time a new code update comes out,

[01:06:26] they feel like they've got a whole new game and it's fun learning all the differences and all the

[01:06:30] improvements. But it makes, it makes for a guy like me who doesn't have room for a lot of pins.

[01:06:38] Fustrated because I don't know when is the right time to make an opinion about the game, right?

[01:06:44] Because if I play it and I feel like it's underwhelming, then the code junkies chime in and say,

[01:06:52] well, it's just wait to the code comes out. Well, if that's the case, then maybe it does make sense

[01:06:57] to just wait to these games are finally done. And then, then by one, you know, I, there's guys who

[01:07:05] buy new and boxed-stern Pimble machines that never open them up until the code is done.

[01:07:10] Well, I think that the, we've seen too many cases where it takes too long for the final code to come

[01:07:17] out, you know, I understand you're going to have some little enhancements or some things along the

[01:07:21] way. But I guess I'm in the camp that says, when a game ships, it should be complete. You know,

[01:07:27] it shouldn't be that. And you know, I've actually seen some cases that seem like that code never comes.

[01:07:31] That would, that would make me crazy. Now, I'm not a new inbox buyer. I've, I've never bought

[01:07:37] new inbox. I don't think I've ever bought anything that wasn't at least five or six years old.

[01:07:42] Personally, I would never buy a machine until I played it. So, yeah, I would see. You could still buy

[01:07:47] new inbox and done that. But, you know, I tend to want to, you know, get an opportunity to enjoy it

[01:07:52] before I would choose to buy it. Right. Well, it's funny when I, when I got my tells of the Arabian

[01:07:56] Knights, I got a lot of people. And again, these are like more of the hardcore guys. They're like,

[01:08:01] oh man, why, why did you get that pin? Like it's, it's got such a shallow rule set. And it's easy to

[01:08:07] beat. And I'm like, that's exactly why I got it. Because I want to have people come over, explain

[01:08:12] to them simply like hit the genie, start the modes, get the multi-ball, collect the jewels, and then

[01:08:19] you battle battle the genie and win. Like I, I wanted a game that was pretty easy to, to get to the end

[01:08:25] and explain to people. And I had Lord of the Rings in here before that. And I kind of think Lord of the

[01:08:30] Rings is, I got really familiar with it. And I thought it's like a really easy game to explain.

[01:08:36] But man, when people would come over, it was just hard explaining how to like light lock and

[01:08:41] roll over the keeps. You know, it was, it's difficult. Like people just, they can't process eight

[01:08:47] different things to think about when they're playing. So, you know, that's why I think a game like Ghostbusters

[01:08:52] is just going to just do gangbusters for a stern because it's a kind of game where it doesn't even

[01:08:57] matter. It's going to have great code eventually. And it had pretty good code already in the pro that I

[01:09:03] played. But it's just fun to, all right, hit slimer, right? It's got those like rewarding shots that,

[01:09:09] when you just look at it, you know what you want to shoot at. And it's, it's, it's really gratifying.

[01:09:14] So I, I think they've found a good balance with that pin. What, what else is coming out? Have you played,

[01:09:20] are you looking forward to Big Lebowski to Alien? What are your thoughts on those two that are,

[01:09:24] that are coming out probably sometime this year? Big fan of the Big Lebowski movie. Love the theme.

[01:09:31] And I love what those guys have done with it. The, you know, the attention to detail, you can tell

[01:09:38] they love that theme and, and that they poured their heart into that to really capture it.

[01:09:44] I, the bowling alley is a great toy. My concern there is, you know, does it have legs? You know,

[01:09:50] does that get old quickly? You know, the last time I saw that they had added some new capabilities and

[01:09:55] features to make it challenging otherwise early, first few times I played it didn't take long to

[01:10:00] master getting a strike. Right. It kind of mixed that up and made that more interesting. I think the

[01:10:06] rugs are very cool creative toy. It was kind of a nice bash toy. So I think they did a nice job

[01:10:11] implementing it. You know, obviously we really haven't seen the software yet. Even at, you know,

[01:10:17] I'd expo this year it was still really a lot of placeholders. So I've had the opportunity to play

[01:10:24] it quite a few times and it's got a nice feel to it but it's really hard to judge it until it all

[01:10:28] comes together. But, you know, I look at what those guys did with, with Bob 2.0, which I think they

[01:10:33] did a really great job with and I have very high hopes for Lebowski. I expect it to be

[01:10:39] come off really well. I think it's going to be a great machine when it's done. Right. Yeah, I was,

[01:10:46] I was a little because I played it when they they had the the tour and I think it was like a year,

[01:10:52] a little over a year ago and it came to modern pinball in New York City and that was when it still

[01:10:56] had the original music from the film. It had like the marijuana leaf on it and that was like right

[01:11:03] when the whole like whistle blowing was going on internally at Dutch that sort of created a lot of

[01:11:10] drama. But I was a little surprised that the code wasn't further along to the last time I played it

[01:11:14] and I played it recently at Texas Pinball Festival. I played it at expo. You know, I think, I think,

[01:11:20] they showed what was like a seemingly finished game but I think they went and almost like re-engineered

[01:11:26] the entire game like under the play field and made everything much more much higher quality.

[01:11:33] But it is it is still head scratching to me why it takes these companies like a year to code the game

[01:11:38] to get it more finished. I think part of what happened with TBL is I think they've been using the

[01:11:44] original prototypes that were here in the US and I don't think those are now fully compatible with

[01:11:50] the actual production machines. I think that's created some issues why they weren't able to fully

[01:11:55] update the software. The fully show its things. I think the software is much further along than we've

[01:12:00] seen because we just haven't really seen the latest version of the game and they have certainly

[01:12:06] changed a lot underneath but I think it's a variety of factors. I think that's why we haven't

[01:12:12] haven't seen it. And I think some of the delays there we've seen a little bit was first they were

[01:12:18] working on Bob then they were working on LaBouse Keat and then they went back to go work on Bob again

[01:12:23] once they worked through their issues with the licensing with Rick and so then they kind of went

[01:12:28] back to that and then they went back and forth. So I think that's a little bit of it as they're

[01:12:34] working through they've changed the hardware a little bit so you have to kind of go back through

[01:12:37] testing but I also know those guys want it to be pretty complete. I'm not going to say that they're

[01:12:44] going to send it out and it's done. I think we're going to see with them like we've seen with

[01:12:47] everybody it's 90% done but I think they want to make sure it's really where they want it before

[01:12:53] it comes out but clearly you know from what I've heard production it is underway and I think

[01:12:59] we'll certainly be seeing those shipping in the not too distant future and I know a few people who

[01:13:05] have their money down so I'm looking forward to going to their homes and getting to play it.

[01:13:09] Right. What are your thoughts on have you played full throttle or have you seen like what

[01:13:16] alien like what are you are you're excited for that theme like what are your thoughts on

[01:13:20] I'm not a huge alien fan but I'm an alien fan and as I think I said in that thread at one point

[01:13:27] when the art came out yeah I guess I need to see it when it's fully populated. The art really

[01:13:33] didn't do it for me and you know the whole Sigourney Weaver thing and I'll go to that just

[01:13:39] just understand how you don't have her. She's to me the the key focus such a key focus of the movie.

[01:13:45] The play field just didn't grab me I found it dark and again hard to tell with pictures online I

[01:13:51] haven't seen it in person yeah so I really need to see it populated but from what I've seen so far

[01:13:59] it's not like I'm running out and buying it and I'm not my brother who's a huge alien fan

[01:14:04] he was saying you know should I get I'm like I'm not seeing anything yet that says to go get it

[01:14:08] but we need to see it complete and I think it's going to be out by now but obviously

[01:14:14] you know at least take time. Right I'm hoping that they show more on the Alien Day in two weeks

[01:14:20] which is 426 but yeah I agree like I think that you kind of have to show your machine sort of

[01:14:28] pretty you know populated and pretty final to get people excited because when you start to reveal

[01:14:34] these machines and bits and pieces I don't think it really works too well for the manufacturers

[01:14:39] and I think Stern's approach is probably the best where they pretty much just reveal it.

[01:14:43] Like they don't give a damn about people giving feedback and making changes and

[01:14:48] griping about things you know because they're already on to the next I mean Stern is already

[01:14:53] probably getting Star Wars ready for for end of year you know I mean they're to them Ghostbusters

[01:14:59] was completed six months ago and it was just more about like finalizing the manufacturing

[01:15:05] the production of it and making sure the license you know the license or it was cool with everything but

[01:15:10] you know they're already on to games well into the next two years and those games will come out too

[01:15:17] so it's going to be interesting you know I think I mean personally I don't think the market can

[01:15:23] bear the amount of new titles that are about to hit I think that this if you were to tell people

[01:15:29] five years ago you know there'd be something like six to eight new inbox games available for

[01:15:35] purchase in 2016 I think people would be like you're crazy there's no way like there can be

[01:15:41] that many but it just seems like it's this perfect storm where a lot of the boutiques like Dutch and

[01:15:46] highway and a lot of the games have slipped where it seems like this year is going to be the year

[01:15:51] where all these things hit at once do you think the market can bear the amount of games are coming out

[01:15:56] or you think it's it's going to be a you know we're not going to see some of these companies around in

[01:16:00] a year or two well I think that there's going to be an appetite for new machines and I think what

[01:16:06] will be interesting to see what happens in the marketplaces how well machines hold their value

[01:16:11] and that and that trickle down effect as we talked about when the predator and jpop things blew up

[01:16:16] that was a lot of money that got got taken out and ultimately there's only so much money coming

[01:16:21] in it's new money that that is coming in to feed this but at some point you're wondering what the

[01:16:27] prices that we have seen skyrocket over the last eight nine years is mind boggling and not to get

[01:16:35] into the whole supply and demand thing projector winner as that supply continues there has to have

[01:16:41] an impact on pricing and there's some people who love that new next game they're going to keep

[01:16:45] buying it except maybe until the point where they're now having the hard time selling their game

[01:16:51] for what they want because the market that trickle down is not there you know you keep that you

[01:16:56] were to get there you know there's clearly growth so you know time will tell it does seem like

[01:17:01] you know these machines have been in the works are getting there although I you know hard to see

[01:17:05] alley and coming out of shipping anytime soon right well I haven't seen that complete I mean we

[01:17:11] could be wrong and you could be holding back I don't see those shipping in a month or two no

[01:17:16] no and you know it's interesting too because like everyone always is been crying lately about

[01:17:22] sterns prices right and then and let's look at the alley now they're around what eight thousand

[01:17:29] dollars and they already sold out every ghost bus there's alley in a matter of days I think it was

[01:17:35] even like one day so that the market's still there it's just going to be interesting because even

[01:17:42] nowadays if you want to go buy a new inbox pin right now you've got the hobby shipping you've got

[01:17:49] right now you really can you can get a game of thrones and that's really an aspiring V and

[01:17:56] and what I think Stern's also selling metallic is still and like Star Trek still I mean there's a lot

[01:18:01] of sterns that are on the line that you could still order but when it comes to the new new games

[01:18:07] it's going to be interesting because spooky's already sold out I mean Rob Zombie is spoken for

[01:18:13] immediately which is great I mean it's fun to see those guys because I'd have all them you know

[01:18:17] from the the home brew guys they must look at spooky like the little engine that could that

[01:18:23] actually did it and made a business model work and is on the game number two and we'll we'll

[01:18:29] definitely ship game number three which is Domino's before like Jersey Jackets game number three

[01:18:34] out the door or even highway gets game number three out the door absolutely absolutely that came

[01:18:38] out from what I've heard and seen I was talking to the dominoes guys up at MGC and sounds like they're

[01:18:44] moving along nicely and and Charlie Shoney could get the machines out he's obviously been beefing

[01:18:49] up to to increase production you know Stern increasing production you know it points to what

[01:18:54] you're talking about having multiple games on the line it really allows them to you know better

[01:19:00] control which products they're producing based on that demand and no doubt there's certain titles

[01:19:06] they know are going to be short runs and be done with it and you know they're pretty smart around

[01:19:10] recognizing how many big pins the community can absorb in a year you know they're not trying to

[01:19:15] make every single game a top of the line super cool LE and so they're getting pretty smart at

[01:19:22] that you know they're pricing model with the LEDs in the pros is obviously a great move by

[01:19:27] Gary to figure out how to better you know capitalize on the home market and keep the operators happy

[01:19:34] and so I think you know that's been good and you know you although I'll blame Jersey Jack for the

[01:19:38] price increases because he came in with a high price diet him and Gary said well I could charge

[01:19:43] that too that right I think that's the the biggest downside is we haven't necessarily seen

[01:19:49] competition bring pricing down we've seen competition bringing pricing up maybe cooler pins coming

[01:19:55] along but it is kind of strange that prices have gone up not down as more competitors have entered

[01:19:59] the marketplace yeah definitely and I think what happened with Jack is like he even set the price

[01:20:05] too low for what is build the materials was I mean the was was originally 6500 and I mean if you

[01:20:10] look at that machine it's with with the wood apron with all the toys on it with the two upper

[01:20:16] playfields I mean that that you know at the end of the run that machines nine thousand dollars

[01:20:22] was what Jack had to go get more money right yeah I mean he and we we keep seeing more and more

[01:20:27] people making that mistake I mean you know you know canate his podcast I say stuff that is

[01:20:32] sometimes unpopular but when I look at highway as a manufacturer he's set the price for alien

[01:20:37] already right he's set the price and there's been like a year delay how does that year delay not

[01:20:43] get factored into the new price I just don't understand how you know these companies that they

[01:20:48] they set a price but then they fly by the release date and the only way they can factor in all the

[01:20:56] development time and the year of having that factory on without game shipping has to be somehow

[01:21:02] reflected in the price but they when they're reluctant to do it I think it puts these companies

[01:21:06] in a in a risky situation financially and I mean we even see we saw Dutch Pimbal they raise the

[01:21:12] price of Lebowski I mean it makes sense right they they add they added work they added elements and they

[01:21:17] they they made changes and and if you wanted it's going to cost this well you know the running joke

[01:21:23] the home brook communities we always joke about you know making pinball is hard you know and it's

[01:21:28] and it's and it which is such an you know an understatement and no matter how much you think you you

[01:21:33] grasp it and understand it and have it under control as we've clearly seen people don't they

[01:21:38] continue to underestimate you know it's funny here you just tell you well the next pin will be

[01:21:42] on time because we didn't give a date because he's finally realized you know never give a date because

[01:21:47] there's just so many things that happen that you can't you know figure out obviously Stern's got

[01:21:52] it figured out they have a bunch of things in the works and it gives them some flexibility there

[01:21:56] but especially for new guys there's a lot to figure out when you start making a machine you start

[01:22:02] to realize all of the little details that are involved all the things that need to come together

[01:22:08] and you know and that's the case where I'm doing it in my basement I'm not trying to get it

[01:22:11] manufactured which adds that whole other layer of things right as we all know to licensing creates

[01:22:18] you know delays you know you probably see me as some of the threads when licensing comes up and

[01:22:22] people tell me how it's making money for studios I'm like studios don't license to pinball to make

[01:22:26] money they're losing money I can assure you that Fox is not making money off of highway on this

[01:22:33] deal the cost to Fox of the the legal stuff they had to go through and going through all the

[01:22:38] approvals and all the rest is going to eat up whatever bit of money they're getting they're doing

[01:22:42] it to promote the brand exactly accordingly Fox doesn't jump when highway calls

[01:22:48] and that creates those delays and they don't have any leverage Fox is you know they've got all

[01:22:53] the leverage and that's the other challenge that these guys are dealing with and you know obviously

[01:22:58] Gary and these guys have figured this out both from how to negotiate the deals and how to move

[01:23:03] through these things more more quickly and you know that's why you know you'd expect to see on

[01:23:09] future machines these guys get better but it's not easy right no it it definitely is not and

[01:23:16] it's not easy but when it all comes together it is still probably the greatest form of entertainment

[01:23:22] that we all enjoy well Josh I want to thank you for coming on tonight and talking I definitely

[01:23:28] want to have you come back on because you know as much as it's fun to educate people on the world

[01:23:33] of home brew and we want to check in and see how your projects are going and even get your opinions

[01:23:37] about some of the other home brew stuff that's going on in the pinball world but also I just

[01:23:43] just love talking to you about the current state of the hobby and what's going on with with the

[01:23:48] manufacturers and I know that my listeners always appreciate a second opinion and point of view

[01:23:54] on campus pinball podcast so I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us.

[01:23:59] Well I enjoyed it it was a fun conversation you know anytime happy to come back on and I guess

[01:24:04] we'll find out pretty quickly if people enjoyed it or not I'm sure they will not have enjoyed this

[01:24:08] as much as you know coincide cry babies but you know hey hopefully they found an entertaining.

[01:24:14] Yeah they yeah they will they always love the interviews but the the rants will still continue

[01:24:22] people so don't worry those will come back you know because I always joke around because

[01:24:26] when I do interviews like these are great and they usually run around a little bit you know an hour

[01:24:31] to an hour and a half but sometimes I can put up like a five minute like like I rate rant and

[01:24:38] and get justice many listens so as a as a podcaster I kind of have to dabble in both because they're

[01:24:44] both effective even though one takes a lot longer than the other efficiencies as we say in the

[01:24:51] pinball world. All right just well thank you so much. Thank you Chris. So that was it ladies and

[01:24:57] gentlemen our great talk with Josh and again send your prayers and thoughts to Cornelius I hope

[01:25:03] they let him back into thread and he should not have been ejected let's be honest like I was just

[01:25:08] having a good time he likes to have a good time in that thread and if if any of the moderators are

[01:25:12] listening let him back he was just being sarcastic. I rate everyone have a great Friday a great weekend

[01:25:18] drink some beers play some pinball and hug your loved ones good night
