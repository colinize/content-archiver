[00:00] So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back, I'll get you heart racing in my skin tight,

[00:08] jeans be a teen made stream tonight.

[00:12] I'll set the set up, set up, set up, set up, set up, set up, set up.

[00:30] the next game from Spooky Pinball this year.

[00:33] Now it makes total sense, like they are wrapping up production of Halloween and Ultraman,

[00:38] and they are taking orders on TNA 2.0, but that's like a separate build kind of game.

[00:44] This company needs to keep the main lines going,

[00:47] and so I think we're gonna see what we saw last time when they did the Rick and Morty.

[00:51] Remember, Rick and Morty was revealed in December, and Spooky Pinball is good at this.

[00:55] When they reveal a game, that game is basically on the line when the reveal happens.

[01:00] There's not too much of a window or a gap between reveal and production.

[01:05] So here is my prediction, and we all know the secret.

[01:08] I think it's gonna be Scooby-Doo Pinball,

[01:10] and I think it's gonna be probably, hopefully, I'm begging, I'm praying,

[01:15] Spooky Pinball's most impressive game to date.

[01:19] Now, for some of you out there, maybe many of you out there,

[01:23] the bar over at Spooky has been lowered by Halloween and Ultraman.

[01:28] Let's talk about Spooky Pinball.

[01:30] Let's talk about Spooky Pinball for a minute, and let's actually give Spooky Pinball some credit, okay?

[01:35] Because I think Spooky Pinball, when you really zoom out and think about it,

[01:39] this company over the years has made a lot of pinball machines over their tenure, right?

[01:45] If you think about all the boutique pinball companies that have come out and have failed to deliver,

[01:50] a lot of boutique companies never even shipped a single product.

[01:54] Now, let's count the amount of games Spooky Pinball has made.

[01:57] I'm gonna try to remember this without looking it up.

[02:00] America's most haunted, Rob Zombie's Spookshow International,

[02:04] then Domino's, then the Jetsons, then TNA,

[02:08] then Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, Rick and Morty,

[02:12] then we got Halloween, and we got Ultraman.

[02:15] That's nine titles, people, and they're gonna do another TNA,

[02:19] and they're gonna do this new Scooby-Doo game.

[02:21] So that is eleven titles that Spooky Pinball will have put out into the pinball world, eleven.

[02:28] That's more games than Jersey Jack Pinball has managed to get out the door.

[02:32] So I think we have to give Spooky Pinball some credit for getting it done.

[02:36] Now, the history of Spooky Pinball, as we know, has always been this.

[02:39] It's been inconsistent.

[02:40] Like, there have been games that have been okay, there have been games that have been terrible,

[02:44] there have been games that they've been commissioned to build,

[02:46] there's been games that Scott Denisi made that had a huge following,

[02:49] but for the most part, I think everyone is still waiting for Spooky Pinball to make a game.

[02:54] That is just as good as, and I mean this, as good as, a Stern Pro.

[03:00] They just haven't made a game yet that shoots really well,

[03:04] that has interesting mechs in it, that has the total package,

[03:08] and I think Spooky Pinball is so close.

[03:11] Here are the things that Spooky Pinball really needs to change,

[03:14] and here's the things they do really well.

[03:15] The things they do really well are this, they have the best play fields in the industry.

[03:20] They have really great light shows, they use full RGB LEDs in their games.

[03:24] Their games look great.

[03:26] The cabinets look good.

[03:28] They have great sound when they can get the sound right,

[03:30] and I mean this, the Spooky Games, they can really crank really nicely,

[03:34] but sometimes the volume levels are all over the place,

[03:37] so they need to figure that out.

[03:38] The areas of Spooky Pinball where they need work are the following.

[03:42] They need better design.

[03:44] They just need a better designer.

[03:46] Like I don't know if these kids can design a game that's as good as a Stern Pro.

[03:50] I don't know if they have the experience,

[03:52] and I just haven't seen a design or a layout from Spooky Pinball that has been very good.

[03:58] The D'Nisi Games are separate from the Spooky Design Team,

[04:01] and so what I'm looking at with this new game is,

[04:04] can they design a game that actually flows really well,

[04:08] and has really good geometry?

[04:10] Because even if you look at Halloween and Ultraman,

[04:13] I don't think those games are designed very well.

[04:16] I don't think there's good flow in those games,

[04:18] and I think having a super wide ramp like that is also a cop-out.

[04:23] Like that's not what we want.

[04:25] I think they really need to make a game that's just a good design,

[04:28] and here's the thing,

[04:29] I don't think there's any excuse anymore for bad design.

[04:34] If you're designing a whitewood of a pinball machine,

[04:37] how can you stop designing that whitewood until it shoots great?

[04:41] And why is it so hard to make a game shoot great?

[04:43] Can you study all the other pinball machines that are out there,

[04:47] and just borrow ideas from existing designs?

[04:51] How can it be that hard when you think about it?

[04:52] Because the playfield on every single standard body machine

[04:56] is the exact same dimensions.

[04:59] So why can't you study like Pat Lawler's designs

[05:02] and Steve Richie's designs?

[05:03] It is embarrassing to me,

[05:05] some of the designs that Spooky's put out there,

[05:07] because most of them, if you've played their older games,

[05:10] they're absolute brick-fest.

[05:12] Like they're not good designs.

[05:14] Like the openings to the shots are too tight.

[05:16] And so this is gonna be it.

[05:18] I really do feel like this game,

[05:20] and I've heard from someone who played it,

[05:22] is a big improvement over Ultraman in Halloween.

[05:26] So that is what I think everyone is gonna be looking at

[05:28] with this game, is the design better?

[05:31] The other thing we really wanna see in this game

[05:33] are toys and mechs, and I mean this.

[05:36] When you look at Spooky games,

[05:38] are you seeing any mechanical engineering whatsoever?

[05:42] Where?

[05:43] Like everything has always been off the shelf parts.

[05:46] And I just think at this price point,

[05:49] they really need to up their team.

[05:51] They need to get some mechanical engineers in there

[05:54] to be able to design some mechanisms and toys

[05:58] that are not off the shelf.

[06:00] Like when you look at a game like Rick and Morty,

[06:02] everything is off the shelf.

[06:04] When you look at a game like Halloween in Ultraman,

[06:06] almost everything in there is pretty much off the shelf.

[06:09] Like name me, and I mean this,

[06:10] name me one single toy in Halloween and Ultraman.

[06:15] A toy, right?

[06:16] Something that interacts with the ball,

[06:18] that's actually a toy that does something, that moves.

[06:23] There isn't one single thing in the game.

[06:26] So if you're gonna make Scooby-Doo a theme

[06:29] that has a bunch of fun, campy stuff,

[06:31] and I could see it right now, you gotta have a toy.

[06:34] You gotta have a toy.

[06:35] Are you gonna have a Scooby-Doo head

[06:37] that eats Scooby snacks?

[06:38] What is it gonna be?

[06:39] Is it gonna be the mystery van that opens up

[06:41] and locks the balls?

[06:43] Something needs to be in this game that feels like a toy.

[06:46] Because at these prices,

[06:49] I don't think Spooky Pinball's gonna get away

[06:51] with what they've been relying on.

[06:53] And you know the number one thing they've been relying on

[06:55] is really good artwork.

[06:57] And their games recently have looked really nice.

[07:00] But really nice artwork doesn't make up for a lack of toys

[07:05] and a lack of mechanical engineering.

[07:07] And here's the other thing that's gonna be really interesting

[07:09] because most people who bought Halloween in Ultraman,

[07:13] they lost money on those games.

[07:16] So the other part about this reveal

[07:18] that's gonna be super interesting

[07:21] is Spooky Pinball is not gonna be able

[07:23] to not show us gameplay before people go in on the game.

[07:28] I don't think people are gonna pre-order these games ever

[07:31] again.

[07:32] I think we're gonna need to see gameplay.

[07:34] I think we're gonna need to see the code and the animations.

[07:37] And I think they're gonna need to stream this game

[07:39] before people run at it.

[07:41] Because as all of you know,

[07:42] there is absolutely no point now

[07:45] running at a Spooky Pinball machine to get one early

[07:48] or get your deposit locked in.

[07:50] There is no way now that they're gonna be making

[07:53] over a thousand of these games,

[07:55] there's no way the games are gonna be hard to get.

[07:57] There's no way they're gonna be rare.

[07:59] I also think Spooky needs to rethink how they're doing it

[08:03] where the majority of the games become

[08:05] the collector's editions.

[08:07] That's absolutely silly.

[08:09] Can you imagine if Stern let everyone order an LE?

[08:11] If Stern said we're gonna make as many LEs as people order

[08:15] or Jersey Jack said we're gonna make as many CEs

[08:17] as people want.

[08:18] Well, the funny thing is Jersey Jack's actually making

[08:21] more CEs than people actually want of Toy Story.

[08:25] But that's the thing.

[08:25] It's like if you want a Spooky CE,

[08:29] you don't need to order it when they reveal it.

[08:31] And I don't think people are gonna be putting $2,000 deposits

[08:34] on this game anymore.

[08:35] I think this community was burned on the last two games.

[08:39] And I think people are going to have to see something

[08:43] that really impresses them.

[08:45] Now let's just hypothetically say it is Scooby-Doo.

[08:48] Is Scooby-Doo a theme that's gonna get over a thousand

[08:52] people to say take my money now without seeing the gameplay?

[08:56] I don't think so.

[08:57] Is Scooby-Doo a good theme for Pinball?

[08:59] I think Scooby-Doo is a good theme for Pinball.

[09:02] I think it's really campy.

[09:03] I think it's really fun.

[09:05] And I think it's perfect for Spooky Pinball.

[09:07] How many of you out there grew up watching Scooby-Doo?

[09:11] I did.

[09:12] You probably did.

[09:13] So there is enough people out there.

[09:15] Remember, you only need like 1,500 people who like this theme

[09:21] to make it a successful launch for Spooky Pinball.

[09:25] So I don't think they're gonna have a problem finding buyers.

[09:28] But I do think they have a hurdle to overcome

[09:30] and they need to win back the goodwill of the community.

[09:33] If I could give them some advice,

[09:35] Spooky, you've gotta show this game.

[09:38] And I'm praying for them that the code is far along

[09:41] because this can't be another like the code is not complete.

[09:44] The code is very spartan and here's the game.

[09:46] Give us your money before you see anything.

[09:48] And I'm hearing there is an all new coder

[09:50] working on this game.

[09:52] So I fully expect Spooky to come out with this product

[09:55] and have the code much further along.

[09:58] I do not expect them to use the animator

[10:00] who worked on Halloween.

[10:02] I think they heard the feedback there.

[10:03] And I think they know that this game is crucial

[10:06] to this brand.

[10:07] Like this game is so crucial to Spooky Pinball

[10:10] and they need to get it right

[10:12] with the looming economic recession we're all living in.

[10:15] With all of these games costing so much money,

[10:18] there is just no room anymore for mediocrity.

[10:22] This entire hobby cannot accept mediocrity.

[10:25] If you're gonna come out with a game like Queen,

[10:28] it's not gonna sell.

[10:29] If you're gonna come out with a game like Spinal Tap,

[10:32] it's not gonna sell.

[10:33] Spooky Pinball needs this game to be a statement game

[10:37] that shows that this new design team

[10:40] can actually figure it out

[10:42] and gets all of it together in a way that works.

[10:44] Because the community is just spending so much money now

[10:49] that it's at the point now where like two games

[10:51] are costing you over $20,000.

[10:53] You gotta make $40,000 before taxes

[10:56] for just two pinball machines.

[10:58] And I don't know about you.

[10:59] Everyone's watching their portfolios lose like

[11:01] five, six, seven figures in value.

[11:03] And I don't care what anyone says.

[11:05] Like nobody's immune to it.

[11:06] No one's immune to what's about to happen

[11:08] in the economic world.

[11:09] And everybody knows it's the dirty little secret.

[11:12] And I say it all the time.

[11:13] The dirty little secret in this entire hobby

[11:16] is that if you all looked in the mirror right now,

[11:19] do you need another pinball machine?

[11:21] Do you need another pinball machine to be happy?

[11:24] Is your collection filled with great games?

[11:27] Do you even have just a few great games that you love?

[11:30] Why do you need another game?

[11:32] And if you wanna sell some of your existing games,

[11:35] it's gonna be a lot harder to sell those machines.

[11:37] And for the first time ever, and I mean this,

[11:40] the majority of pinball machines

[11:42] that came out in 2022, if you bought them,

[11:45] you lost a lot of money on them.

[11:47] And that really hasn't been the case in pinball

[11:49] since I've been covering this hobby.

[11:51] And I'm not talking about these things as investments people.

[11:54] We don't approach pinball as investments,

[11:57] but you can't ignore the fact that nobody wants to lose

[12:01] like two to $3,000 in one year on a pinball machine.

[12:05] Because if you buy three pinball machines

[12:08] and that happens to you, then you've just lost nine grand

[12:12] because you bought three pinball machines, right?

[12:14] Now you've probably made up that money

[12:16] because some of your older machines have gone up in value,

[12:19] but you know how pinball people are,

[12:20] they don't wanna sell the old stuff.

[12:22] How can I sell it now?

[12:23] My Trinolese worth $18,000.

[12:26] So then the question becomes,

[12:28] what is the price of Scooby-Doo?

[12:30] Is Scooby-Doo gonna cost more than Ultraman and Halloween?

[12:33] I don't know.

[12:34] I think Spooky's gonna keep the price kind of where it's at.

[12:37] I think we're gonna see the collector's edition

[12:40] cost around like $89.99, maybe they make it $9,500.

[12:44] But for the most part, this game with tax

[12:47] is gonna be around $10,000.

[12:49] If you add a butter cabinet to it,

[12:51] it's gonna be around $11,000.

[12:53] The other thing I hope Spooky does

[12:55] is I hope they make their toppers a little nicer.

[12:58] When I see a Spooky game from the side for $10,000,

[13:02] I don't wanna see servo motors and wires like on the topper.

[13:06] Like just put a case around it, Spooky.

[13:08] It's not that hard.

[13:10] For this much money,

[13:11] you can design something that encases the topper.

[13:14] It might cost you another 50 bucks,

[13:16] but that's what people are gonna expect for this much money.

[13:19] But at least they give you a topper.

[13:21] I will say that.

[13:22] At least they give you a topper.

[13:23] I mean, it is crazy that we're spending $13,000

[13:26] on Stern LEs and there's no topper.

[13:28] I mean, think about it right now.

[13:30] If you add the accessories to James Bond,

[13:32] like once they make a topper and they make the shooter rod

[13:35] and they make everything else that you can add to the game,

[13:37] plus taxes and plus shipping,

[13:39] James Bond will probably be over $16,000.

[13:45] And that is why I am seeing this industry softening.

[13:48] I am.

[13:49] I'm seeing James Bond games for sale

[13:51] right around what they cost at MSRP.

[13:54] There's no room to flip these games.

[13:55] Like you can't be all in at $14,500 on a Stern machine

[14:00] and then go flip it for more money.

[14:03] And I don't think James Bond's gonna be as good as Godzilla.

[14:06] I don't think it's gonna be one of the best Stern machines

[14:09] of all time.

[14:09] I just don't.

[14:10] I think it's gonna be good.

[14:11] I think it's gonna appeal to James Bond fanatics,

[14:14] but I just don't think this game is gonna be like,

[14:17] you know, oh my God,

[14:17] I gotta take out a second mortgage on the house

[14:19] to get one of these games.

[14:21] And I think everyone's feeling that way.

[14:22] Everyone is feeling like, oh, I'm kind of over it.

[14:25] And also like the delay on this James Bond reveal

[14:28] has made everyone's FOMO sort of dissipate.

[14:31] I don't know about you,

[14:32] but I feel like this game came out six months ago.

[14:35] I already feel like I bought James Bond.

[14:36] I played it.

[14:37] I've seen it all.

[14:38] And now I'm selling it to get the next Stern pin.

[14:40] I feel like everyone's already like,

[14:42] what's next from Stern?

[14:43] Like we're already like, is it gonna be back to the future?

[14:45] Is it gonna be He-Man?

[14:46] Is it gonna be Venom?

[14:47] Like that window, right?

[14:48] There's that one month window

[14:50] where you really need to have the game out and about.

[14:53] But we do know now that this game is most likely gonna be

[14:56] at Pinball Expo, which is a good sign.

[14:58] Here's why I love the fact

[15:00] that this game is probably gonna be on the floor at Expo.

[15:03] Because think about it.

[15:04] How often do we actually get consumer reviews?

[15:07] Like real consumer reviews,

[15:09] not distributors reviewing the games,

[15:11] telling us everything is amazing,

[15:13] but real consumers jumping on a game

[15:15] and getting to play it

[15:17] and giving us their feedback

[15:19] before we have to send in those final checks for the game.

[15:23] Because remember,

[15:24] Stern Pinball machines are refundable deposits.

[15:28] Nobody's money is non-refundable.

[15:30] So I think this is great.

[15:32] I can't wait to see what people think about James Bond

[15:35] because we don't really believe Jack Danger

[15:37] when he plays it, right?

[15:38] I mean, he works for Stern Pinball, of course.

[15:40] And he's not reviewing it,

[15:41] but you know what I mean?

[15:42] Like they're gonna put their best foot forward

[15:44] when they do the stream.

[15:46] But I wanna hear from pinheads out there

[15:48] who have no skin in the game, what the game is like.

[15:52] All right, and let me end this show by saying this.

[15:54] This is gonna be the battleground.

[15:55] I think the battleground within the boutique space

[15:58] is gonna be between Spooky Pinball and American Pinball.

[16:02] Now, if I'm American Pinball,

[16:04] I wanna get my game out or revealed or announced

[16:07] before Spooky shows Scooby-Doo.

[16:10] David Ficks, don't wait

[16:13] because there's only so many tens of thousands of dollars

[16:17] people are willing to spend.

[16:18] There are not enough people in this community

[16:21] at these prices to float these games.

[16:24] And we saw it with TNA 2.0.

[16:26] It's still not sold out.

[16:28] So you gotta remember, like this is it, David Ficks.

[16:31] This is it, Charlie Emery.

[16:33] You guys are battling it out.

[16:34] You have two boutique games

[16:36] and they're both around $10,000.

[16:39] Stern is asking people for 10 grand for premiums

[16:41] and 13,000 for LEs.

[16:43] It's crazy how many people want your money.

[16:46] And then you've got Jersey Jack

[16:47] trying to cajole you to buy a toy story,

[16:50] but no one's gonna buy a toy story at MSRP anymore

[16:52] because you're gonna lose $2,000 on an LE

[16:56] and you're gonna lose at least $2,000 to $3,000 on a CE.

[16:59] So it is gonna be a brutal competitive fall

[17:02] in the pinball world.

[17:03] We haven't even talked about Cactus Canyon LE.

[17:06] Like nobody's unboxed that game yet.

[17:09] That game was revealed at Expo a year ago

[17:12] and that game's gonna finally start shipping.

[17:14] And then here's what's gonna happen.

[17:16] You know there are scalpers and flippers

[17:19] who don't want the game,

[17:21] who wanna scalp that machine

[17:22] and get it sold to a new buyer.

[17:25] So that game is also gonna start to pop up

[17:27] on the marketplace for sale.

[17:29] And remember, Cactus Canyon LE was like affordable.

[17:32] It was like $9,200.

[17:34] And so we're gonna see that game hit the block as well.

[17:37] And if you line up these games,

[17:39] and I mean a Cactus Canyon LE is packed.

[17:42] So Cactus Canyon LE versus James Bond,

[17:45] versus Scooby Doo,

[17:47] versus Galactic Space War new Backbox David Fix game,

[17:51] versus Toy Story,

[17:52] versus Spinal Tap, versus Queen Pinball.

[17:55] Did you see how many games we just mentioned?

[17:58] And all of these companies,

[18:00] they need consistent sales to keep the line going.

[18:03] You know what the greatest bang for the buck is

[18:05] in all of Pinball and where the most enjoyment is?

[18:08] Imagine if you don't buy any of those games,

[18:11] you just enjoy the games you have,

[18:14] and you just increase your Cactus Pinball podcast subscription

[18:18] from $5 to $10.

[18:21] And if you do, if we get enough people to do that,

[18:23] I'll make three shows a week

[18:25] and you'll save yourself tens of thousands of dollars a year

[18:28] because you know this is where the most entertaining thing

[18:31] is happening in Pinball.

[18:32] It's just talking about it.

[18:34] It's just observing it.

[18:35] Buying these games at these prices

[18:38] isn't really exciting people.

[18:40] You know it, stare deep into your pinball soul people.

[18:43] You know it, you're happy with the games you have.

[18:46] You know you wanna use this money to treat your kids

[18:49] and your wives to vacations that will change your life.

[18:51] Don't believe the hype, don't believe the FOMO.

[18:55] These distributors and these companies need you to feel

[18:58] like you need every new game.

[19:00] The only person that needs every new game

[19:02] and he doesn't even need it is John over at Jack Bar

[19:06] because he puts a new game into his bar

[19:08] and it makes sense for operators to chase all the new games.

[19:12] But for the rest of you,

[19:13] you're not gonna grow six inches taller.

[19:15] You're not gonna become a better Casanova in bed.

[19:18] You're not gonna be cooler to any of your pinball friends.

[19:21] You gotta really think about it now.

[19:23] And I think everyone's falling into this face now

[19:25] where it's like I'm only gonna buy dream themed games

[19:29] that really knock it out of the park.

[19:31] For you James Bond guys, I think you're gonna be happy.

[19:34] I think the Keith L. Wimpin is gonna be silly.

[19:37] I do, I think when they show that game

[19:39] and distros start asking 20 grand for it,

[19:41] I think people are gonna laugh at it

[19:43] and I don't think people are gonna chase that game.

[19:45] I don't, I'll tell you why

[19:46] because the people who chase that game,

[19:48] if it's over 20 grand, they're gonna be ridiculed.

[19:51] Nobody's gonna wanna be ridiculed.

[19:53] And if you don't chase that game right when they reveal it,

[19:56] here's what's gonna happen.

[19:57] I guarantee you, you'll be able to buy it

[20:00] from a distributor in like three to four months

[20:02] for $5,000 less than these rich dudes flexing

[20:05] who will buy it right away.

[20:07] And Ed Robertson, don't even start texting me right now,

[20:09] Ed, I can feel the text coming.

[20:11] I know you're gonna get one Ed, you get everything.

[20:14] And Ed, I bet you pay wholesale.

[20:15] I bet you do, Ed.

[20:17] And don't even bother.

[20:18] And Ed Robertson got a supreme.

[20:19] How did Ed Robertson get a supreme?

[20:21] How did he figure that out?

[20:22] Ed, I wanna know.

[20:23] I want you to sell the supreme

[20:25] and I want you to donate the profits

[20:27] to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[20:28] Everybody have a great weekend.

[20:31] Next week is expo.

[20:33] We'll see what happens.

[20:34] It's always a pleasure doing this show,

[20:36] the world's number one pinball podcast,

[20:38] the only pinball podcast that shares the only numbers

[20:41] that really matter, people.

[20:43] We're the only show that really,

[20:44] when you ask people to pay to play,

[20:46] we're killing it.

[20:47] And it's because of all of you.

[20:48] And do me a favor, invite a friend

[20:51] to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[20:52] The more you invite people,

[20:54] the more we show everybody that this is where it's at later.

[20:57] This is real, so take a chance

[21:00] and go and look back, go and look back.

[21:04] I'm gonna get your heart racing

[21:06] in my skin tight.

[21:08] Jeans be your teenage dream tonight.

[21:12] Let you put your hands on me in my skin tight.

[21:16] Jeans be your teenage dream tonight.
