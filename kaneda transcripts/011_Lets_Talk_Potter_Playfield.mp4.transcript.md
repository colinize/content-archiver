[00:00] I'm sorry.

[00:01] I'm a little late gang.

[00:07] One year old baby, fever just haven't slept in.

[00:29] I'm going to have a day and a half.

[00:32] Bear with me, everybody, as we get our bearings straight here.

[00:39] Let's do this.

[00:40] Let's share.

[00:44] Share this to Facebook.

[00:47] Get everybody going.

[00:49] Figure out how we're going to do this.

[00:57] Live talk of Potter play field.

[01:04] Lots of thoughts.

[01:07] Lots of thoughts.

[01:11] Boo, boo, boo.

[01:17] All right.

[01:19] How's everybody doing tonight?

[01:21] Well, it was quick.

[01:22] 42 people popped in right away.

[01:25] I think it's a little bit more lighting in here.

[01:27] It's kind of grainy.

[01:28] Hold on.

[01:35] That's better.

[01:43] All right.

[01:48] I'm going to have a little bit more of a day.

[01:58] In on a CE, what's up?

[02:00] Who we got here?

[02:01] Getting CE.

[02:02] Looks like there's no Arnold in predator.

[02:05] Are you still getting it?

[02:06] No.

[02:07] I said from the get go.

[02:08] If Arnold's not in predator, not buying the game.

[02:12] That's simple.

[02:13] I don't want to buy transformers without Optimus Prime.

[02:17] I don't want to buy Batman without Batman.

[02:20] Predator is a movie about Arnold, about Dutch, the strongest man on the planet,

[02:27] who meets his match in a freaking alien.

[02:31] How are you going to make that game without Arnold?

[02:34] Because then you're not going to have any of the scenes with Arnold and Carl,

[02:38] and Arnold and Jesse.

[02:41] It's just going to be maybe some of the side characters talking without Arnold,

[02:47] which is a horrible movie.

[02:50] Yeah.

[02:51] I heard what they're going to do.

[02:52] Is there the seat they can make enough money to go license Arnold?

[02:55] Good luck.

[02:56] Seven figure deal there.

[02:59] Not happening.

[03:04] All right.

[03:05] So I've got a baby monitor here.

[03:10] And I've got a cell phone here with Harry Potter play field.

[03:16] Let me tell you right now.

[03:17] I want to talk about the fact that every single pinball content creator on the planet right now has images.

[03:25] The same image.

[03:28] Obviously this image came from Jersey Jack.

[03:31] And I will say this.

[03:33] I don't think it's leaked.

[03:35] I think everybody has been good at.

[03:39] DUDD, you know, not spoiling Eric and his teams reveal.

[03:45] I think there's like a level of respect there.

[03:47] Like if this was like a stern game, we would have leaked it instantly.

[03:51] There would have been no respect for Stern on this on this notion.

[03:54] You know of like holding back.

[03:58] But I think this time around everybody just feels.

[04:02] We're so close that you might as well.

[04:07] See it proper.

[04:10] And you know, I'm hearing everybody's sort of questions.

[04:17] So I want to do is I want to just kind of.

[04:21] Answer some of your questions about it.

[04:23] I want to tell you my thoughts on it.

[04:25] I can definitely see the artwork.

[04:28] I'm doing my best to sort of.

[04:32] Can you see the reflection of it like in my glasses.

[04:38] It's going to be the furthest ever first ever like someone's trying to zoom in on the reflection of glasses.

[04:45] It's it's definitely.

[04:51] Going to be a fast game.

[04:53] When I saw the play field and I looked at the layout.

[04:56] I think Steve Richie has had a real impact since being over at Jersey Jack.

[05:04] And I think that was the first thing I noticed when I looked at the game.

[05:06] I was like, wow, this looks like a fast wide open.

[05:13] Not it's not empty, but everything is happening towards the second upper half of the game.

[05:21] Right.

[05:22] You know, all of Elton John like like there's.

[05:24] There's no real.

[05:26] You know, there's a.

[05:28] It might be some dropped targets here is only but there's no real like a lot of stuff slowing the ball down.

[05:36] Happening in the lower half of the game.

[05:39] Upper or lower play fields.

[05:41] There's no lower play field.

[05:43] There are there are what looks to be.

[05:49] I think there's definitely.

[05:52] Okay, so.

[05:54] There's definitely an upper left play field and I think there's an upper right I think the whole.

[06:01] Like.

[06:02] I think there's like just the whole I'm trying to like look at where these wire forms connect to.

[06:08] You got the flying car.

[06:09] Okay, so there's.

[06:13] I think there's.

[06:16] I think there's.

[06:17] I think there's.

[06:18] You know, the thing is the shot everybody has is a top down shot.

[06:21] So it's hard for me to get.

[06:23] Sort of like a deaf perception and everything happening.

[06:28] I want to I want to read your question for flippers.

[06:30] How many flippers.

[06:31] Okay, so there's two at the bottom.

[06:34] There's.

[06:36] It's a.

[06:39] Four flipper game, I believe, unless there's.

[06:43] There's a flipper hitting.

[06:44] So there's there's there's two at the bottom.

[06:47] There's an upper right flipper that is like exactly where.

[06:51] The Elton John upper right flipper is and then there is a small flipper.

[06:57] In the upper left for the upper play field.

[07:01] That looks like it has.

[07:05] It's crazy because above above the upper left flipper.

[07:10] On the upper play field is a wire form over the flipper.

[07:15] And that wire form looks like it does it like a whole orbit around.

[07:21] I think what's going to happen there.

[07:23] I think that might be where you go to play quidditch.

[07:27] And I think that might be.

[07:31] A sculpt of Hogwarts.

[07:33] What's going to happen is I think you're going to go up there.

[07:36] And you're going to go around.

[07:37] It looks like it may be like a six inch circle around the upper left play field.

[07:44] So I think you might get in there.

[07:46] And I think there might be some sort of like richy like magnetic like.

[07:50] Like velocity thing happening up there that's going to fire that ball around the wire form that sits above.

[07:57] And then the upper left flipper.

[08:05] Is the art and the play field seamless.

[08:14] Okay, people keep asking if there's the Hogwarts sculpt.

[08:19] And again, because I can't I don't I think may I don't think it's a sculpt.

[08:26] Is that.

[08:29] I don't know.

[08:31] So in the CE of the game.

[08:34] In the CE of the game.

[08:36] The Hogwarts castle is the CE topper.

[08:44] So for all of you wondering what the CE topper is going to be.

[08:48] It's the Hogwarts castle.

[08:52] Okay.

[08:55] I want to just answer your questions.

[08:57] I'm not showing you the picture, but I will answer questions about it.

[09:07] I did not talk about the staircase.

[09:09] I'm eating popcorn by the way.

[09:11] Okay.

[09:12] So the staircase.

[09:18] The the furthest is the left ramp, which sits about just about like it looks like just about an inch from the hot rail.

[09:30] There's a.

[09:32] And then.

[09:34] There's the staircase.

[09:36] Now, what it looks like happens is the staircase.

[09:41] Now think about a ramp.

[09:43] I think the staircase flips around.

[09:46] So I think it it turns around.

[09:49] So I think it becomes like either like a ramp or a diverter.

[09:53] So I think you might either go over or under it.

[09:56] I don't know.

[09:57] I think that's what it looks like it does.

[09:59] I can't see overhead picture.

[10:01] No movement.

[10:02] So.

[10:09] What's up everybody?

[10:11] Is there a snitch?

[10:14] No, so.

[10:22] So.

[10:24] I can tell you now why Jersey Jack sent a cease and desist to that home brew Harry Potter game though gang like.

[10:34] Look.

[10:37] When people say like this is packed, it definitely looks like there's a lot going on in this game.

[10:43] But it doesn't have just looking at it.

[10:46] The OMG that that home brew.

[10:51] Does with that super deep position of the play field and that crazy hog wards and.

[10:58] You know the magnetic battle between all the moreton Harry going across the play field like it doesn't.

[11:06] Have any anything like dramatic like that and.

[11:10] I think that's the one thing.

[11:13] There's some big.

[11:16] You know there's the flying car.

[11:21] Looks like there's like a woman flying through the air.

[11:24] I think there's going to be a lot of similar.

[11:28] Small cake topper match box car like things.

[11:33] Attached by wires in this game that.

[11:36] Is like modern J. J. P. I.

[11:39] I don't.

[11:42] You know it fits the theme.

[11:44] It just you know I don't think we're going to see.

[11:48] I don't see any like elaborate sculpts.

[11:52] I don't see like a.

[11:54] A really detailed.

[11:56] Skull.

[11:59] I don't know what it's called.

[12:01] Skull.

[12:04] You don't care when I looked at this game and carry I know you've seen it.

[12:07] It feels like.

[12:16] Avatar.

[12:18] And like Elton had a baby a little bit.

[12:23] And guns and roses drumsticks on the side it just feels like.

[12:27] I think it's going to be a lot of the actions at the top.

[12:30] I would say like.

[12:33] Again I think this game is built for speed.

[12:36] I keep looking at it.

[12:38] And I think it's just going to be fast.

[12:40] I think I think.

[12:42] This is going to be Jersey J. X.

[12:44] Like response to all the criticisms of the floating this and the emptiness.

[12:49] I think this is going to have a lot in it.

[12:52] But I think it's going to have a lot of speed.

[12:54] I don't think it's going to be some boring trap and go game.

[12:56] I don't think it's going to be a brick fest like guns and roses.

[12:59] I think balls are going to fly up the left side and come whizzing around the right.

[13:04] And I think balls are going to fly up the right side and whizz or the around to the left.

[13:08] And I think you're going to see flow.

[13:10] I think you're going to see combos.

[13:12] I think you're going to see.

[13:14] The best.

[13:17] Probably Jersey Jack came to date.

[13:20] And again just looking at it.

[13:22] It just seems a lot more interesting than anything else I've seen from them.

[13:27] In a while, right?

[13:29] In a while.

[13:30] Now is it pirates packed?

[13:31] No.

[13:32] And I can tell you right now it's not pirates packed.

[13:35] It actually borderline looks a little cluttered.

[13:39] What I'm looking at.

[13:40] And I think that is an area of like, you know, eight movies onto one play field.

[13:46] Lots to try to do.

[13:48] I'm really also kind of curious to the lack of.

[13:56] Lack of lights in the game.

[13:58] Now, I don't think that's going to mean there's like it's not going to be lit up beautifully because Elton John is but there's not nearly as many of those tiny little LEDs that we saw in other games.

[14:11] And the artwork.

[14:13] I want to read you.

[14:14] I want to read you.

[14:15] I want to follow what you guys are saying as I as I talk to.

[14:23] Yeah.

[14:24] So there's right where the guns and roses drumsticks are.

[14:27] There's three magic ones.

[14:30] I bet it's Harry's.

[14:32] Was it harmony?

[14:33] Harmony.

[14:34] Harmony.

[14:35] Harmony.

[14:36] Where are the three kids?

[14:37] The main kids.

[14:38] Harmony.

[14:39] And you can tell how much of a fan I am.

[14:42] And.

[14:45] Is it Ralph?

[14:47] Weasley weasel with wrong.

[14:51] Yeah, Rhonda.

[14:53] Hermione.

[14:56] Yeah.

[15:05] So.

[15:10] Okay, so it's it's a cauldron.

[15:13] There's a black cauldron that is.

[15:18] In front of the three magic ones and looks like the ones have LEDs on the tips of that, you know, so you're going to get like some, you know.

[15:25] Casting spell sort of action going on.

[15:33] But it looks like a black cauldron.

[15:36] Now, what I think is going to happen is this or carry.

[15:41] It looks like the ball.

[15:43] Could mate there might be a magnet in that cauldron.

[15:47] And I think that cauldron and I could be making this up.

[15:50] I think I think the ball.

[15:52] Might get.

[15:57] Might get locked there.

[16:00] And you knock it off by hitting another ball over the magic ones because the magic ones are pathway.

[16:08] I could be totally wrong.

[16:10] It could just be a sculpt.

[16:12] But that's what it might look like.

[16:17] I'm so shocked.

[16:18] Carry.

[16:19] I'm shocked that no one leaked this damn thing.

[16:21] You know.

[16:23] Everybody I talked to in the content phase has it.

[16:30] Oh.

[16:35] So you're saying it's not.

[16:38] It's not big enough for a ball.

[16:40] The opening for it to go inside the cauldron and out.

[16:45] Yeah, there's an upper left play field.

[16:49] Now, when Jack said there's three levels of play.

[16:56] I don't think there's an upper right play field.

[16:58] I think the ball just goes up there a lot, but I don't think you're like actually shooting a flipper in the upper right anywhere.

[17:07] Can you press the microphone against your throat as you chew.

[17:13] John, welcome to the party.

[17:15] Okay, so here's my here's my thing.

[17:21] The.

[17:24] I'm looking at like it's very colorful.

[17:33] Every once in a while this house like settles and it just is like is is the whole thing coming down.

[17:40] There's there's four flippers.

[17:45] Okay.

[17:46] The chewing is gross.

[17:47] Well, sorry guys.

[17:49] I'm hungry and so you know, I have a baby with a hundred and two point seven fever.

[17:54] I didn't sleep at all last night.

[17:58] His fever broke in the morning.

[18:00] Daycare called me to come get him at like 11.

[18:03] I've been at the doctors.

[18:05] I've been soothing a little one year old all day long while trying to work.

[18:09] While while Brenda's in L.A.

[18:12] While trying to talk about pinball.

[18:15] So if my chewing annoys you.

[18:19] I'm sorry.

[18:21] I also had a couple losers who unsubscribe from my podcast because I refuse to leak the image and spoil Eric's reveal.

[18:33] I don't care.

[18:34] I you know, I don't care about three losers who want to take their $15 and go home.

[18:39] It's just like calling.

[18:40] It's just being a decent person.

[18:42] I had guns and roses in my phone for over a year.

[18:46] And I never leaked it to anybody.

[18:49] And you know, I just again, I just think that.

[18:55] At a respect for the team that worked on it.

[18:59] Let's let them have their moment, right?

[19:01] Now, now talking about it like this, I think this is fun because it just peaks your imagination and your curiosity.

[19:11] It's not spoiling anything.

[19:14] It really is like no matter what I say, you literally have no real idea of like what what I'm looking at.

[19:23] Let me count the shots.

[19:24] Let's do this.

[19:25] This is like a carry hardy move like one, two, three, four.

[19:30] Five, six, seven, eight.

[19:35] Looks like maybe nine.

[19:41] There's something.

[19:43] There's something happening over by the right shooter lane.

[19:47] You know, carry where the ball comes out.

[19:49] I'm happy to report.

[19:51] I should have started with this.

[19:55] I should have started with this.

[19:57] I'm happy to report that this game is not a soft plunge.

[20:04] It's not a soft plunge.

[20:07] You plunge the ball and it fires halfway up the play field all the way.

[20:15] I think it's going to fire all the way across and go up and loop around.

[20:19] I think you're going to have like kind of like an X-Men sort of entrance into this game.

[20:24] I think Eric, the soft plunge in G&R is the dumbest decision ever.

[20:32] I hate it every time it happens.

[20:35] I hate it every time the ball trickles down and goes past that gate because half the times it fails.

[20:41] It's like, you know where you are?

[20:44] Limp penis.

[20:45] Like me.

[20:46] You know, that's what it feels like.

[20:48] It feels like a girl's like ravage me and you're like, yeah, I'm about to play G&R.

[20:52] I can't get it up.

[20:56] I mean, guns and roses suffer from erectile dysfunction when you plunge.

[21:03] It's terrible.

[21:04] It's freaking.

[21:05] And how this is why like Jersey Jack.

[21:08] This is why Jersey Jack always kind of concerns me because like nobody stood over guns and roses and was like, what are you doing, dude?

[21:16] Like nobody stood over avatar and was like, these lower play fields suck.

[21:20] Nobody stood over Godfather and be like, the whole thing is stupid.

[21:25] Nobody stood over toy story for like, we can't make this.

[21:28] No one wants the fourth movie.

[21:30] This fourth movie is not the one anybody likes.

[21:32] So that's why like when we get to this, I think this game is going to make up for so many past mistakes at JJP.

[21:42] I think when we see this game,

[21:46] and I think here's the part.

[21:48] Like I think what's here is really rad.

[21:52] And I think what's going to happen is this connected with the assets with David deal.

[22:00] Oh, did I mention they licensed John Williams theme song.

[22:06] They have all the John Williams music for Harry Potter.

[22:10] All of it.

[22:12] So you're not going to get like some inspired by a track.

[22:17] You're getting the John Williams song.

[22:19] Am I buying one?

[22:27] Uh oh, uh oh.

[22:30] This might get this might ends this might.

[22:36] You hear that?

[22:41] I'm going to hope he's suz and I'm going to give him five minutes to try to suz himself.

[22:47] It's just it's so hard with a he's got an ear infection and he's on medicine and he's on.

[22:55] Tylenol and he was sleeping fine and then kill you and woke him up and.

[23:03] It's it's it's really I think the hardest thing for a parent is to hear a baby crying.

[23:11] So we'll do this for a little bit more, but if he keeps going.

[23:17] I am.

[23:18] I'm going to pop in there and you know, it's like a beautiful thing about life is he falls asleep only in one place.

[23:26] If I'm holding him.

[23:28] I'll tell you this tonight again and I was crying earlier because like kill you and started asking me about about death tonight.

[23:34] Like it was like four years old and like I don't I don't ever want to like die dad like I don't want you and mom.

[23:40] Like it was just like it it like in my mind I'm thinking about like literally had to like walk away.

[23:47] So I didn't see me just like lose it because it's like I think about we've got a pinball image.

[23:53] That lead and how serious everybody is and I'm going to tell you this right now.

[23:58] I mean I was talking in Billy be about this Bill Brandes.

[24:02] I think.

[24:05] I think like a lot of people want to run at this stuff.

[24:11] And just like complain about like the colors or the C.E. artwork.

[24:20] And I think about what would happen if Killian saw this game right he like be like that's so cool like that's so awesome you know.

[24:30] And I think this game is going to be special like like it's going to have a lot more to like.

[24:38] Then there is to nit pick and I think a lot of games might have come before this at Jersey Jack.

[24:45] That might have had more in it but they weren't more fun than this is going to be.

[24:50] And I actually really do like the collect his edition artwork and I think for those of you who don't I think you need to understand the concept of why they did what they did and it's very smart.

[25:00] So they made the movie visuals of Harry Potter the arcade and wizard edition so the so thousands of games will be made for those.

[25:12] Movie going Harry Potter fans.

[25:15] They then go get the book illustrator whose famous in the Harry Potter fan base to make the C.E.

[25:26] So you've made two versions appealing to both.

[25:32] And it's the same game right same game the L.E. as the wizard as the C.E.

[25:38] So it's like kind of like and I didn't know who that artist was right so like the first.

[25:45] The first reaction is to just react and and and tear down and not like.

[25:51] Not not not try to learn like well why is that like what is this you know what that art is doing from the left side of the cabinet all the way to the right.

[26:01] It's telling the story of the eight different movies and I believe it's telling like all I think it's all the different schools are represented in that artwork.

[26:15] You know so I actually think it's quite beautiful.

[26:20] I think it's quite beautiful in its subtleness.

[26:25] I think it's quite beautiful in its color palette and I think it's quite beautiful in its differentiating qualities.

[26:33] I think it looks like no other Pimple machine I've ever seen.

[26:38] And this is no other game.

[26:42] For a company that's way to 12 years or something like this.

[26:46] So I kind of you know I think we're all very triggered.

[26:51] I think we've been very abused by a lot of Pimple rip off games and I think I do I do I do think a lot of companies have been hoodwinking us and gaslighting us and I do I do think.

[27:04] Stern has gas lit a lot of this community they have.

[27:10] They've been gaslighting you now that you're spending $15,000 on a fully option Stern.

[27:16] It's more than that even like gas lit put it next to a Jersey Jack is not even close yet more fun.

[27:23] Yeah like it's had better flow but but I think now you're finally going to start to see not just from Jersey Jack I think from spooky Pimple from barrels of fun.

[27:31] I think you're everyone starting to wake up to the reality that you made the mass produce company that makes the Honda Civics.

[27:41] You guys started spending the kind of money you're supposed to spend on a Mercedes and eventually and you know a high end product.

[27:51] You guys threw money at a company that doesn't deliver a high end product like this.

[27:59] And that is why you know I think when you see this game and if it plays really well again the angry think about who defense Stern to know in it's these tournament players who I get it they love the gameplay.

[28:14] They love playing on location they're not really the new inbox audience they're not the dudes lose in you know three to $7,000 now on new inbox Pimple.

[28:26] So and I look I think all of this is only going to do one thing it's only going to make Stern get better it's only going to make Stern enhance its own product you know Stern's about to raise their prices by $500 across the board $500 across the board so Stern.

[28:44] Stern Ellie with a $2,000 top for now will actually be more expensive than Harry Potter C.

[28:51] So I'm very much in in a in a state of enthusiasm for this game.

[29:03] Okay let's talk about the artwork little it's a little weird I won't lie it's a little weird in the sense of let me go from bottom to top on the artwork at the

[29:15] there's a it's interesting here there's the flippers are two different colors the right side is green with purple below it as the outline drain and the left side is red so you got like some red and green.

[29:35] But don't worry doesn't it doesn't feel Christmassy because in the middle then I guess it's a more like green and maroon it's like the call I looks like the color of Harry's hood it whatever is hood it cape that he wears or wizard robe and then you got Harry wrong you got Harry and then over one shoulder is.

[30:03] Hermione Hermione and then over the others rod is wrong okay and then there's like a there's like some of the other students like vault the morts on like a plastic and then above Harry is Hogwarts with the ego flying or the bird flying near the moon but there's like a Hogwarts and then above that there's like this.

[30:33] Greenish.

[30:36] Area with a brown circle with a triangle in the middle and then one two three four five six seven I think it's like the eight school so there's like seven inserts around a triangle.

[30:49] Triangle with like a circle in the middle.

[30:51] Yeah this is interesting to see you got it looks like you got.

[31:00] Ron on a broom stick there's doby I think that's doby I was laughing I was it would be funny if like.

[31:09] If they made a one of one SLE doby edition but only can either could buy it.

[31:18] Chris seriously is your image mirrored um it's a good question no.

[31:29] It's not mirrored Carrie right is on the left yeah right is on the left.

[31:35] I got I got.

[31:40] Yeah right I have read as the left flipper.

[31:45] And it's not mirrored because the I have the.

[31:51] I have the.

[31:55] The apron and it's Harry Potter to spell correctly.

[32:05] I got.

[32:15] Um.

[32:23] There's doby.

[32:26] Outline and then on the.

[32:30] There's a big rule card here let me.

[32:33] It takes up like almost all the apron let me I'll show you this I don't care about showing you this.

[32:40] This this is the rule card.

[32:44] Look at that look at much of the apron that eats up.

[32:48] That's not given away anything.

[32:53] And you can see like.

[32:56] The other apron is like I already shared this is like this is Eric signature with the stamp or the wax seal.

[33:04] You can see you can see a signature.

[33:09] I guess what's going to be interesting again is like how many they make of the CEs.

[33:15] So that's the big question.

[33:20] I think what's going in in less than 48 hours we're all going to have a chance to see Harry Potter.

[33:40] I'm trying to think there's anything here I'm missing.

[33:44] There's a lot of ball paths here.

[33:47] For you, um, this looks like, um.

[33:52] Oh, wait.

[33:55] I didn't notice that.

[33:58] Alright, so this is like so okay, when you plunge is interesting.

[34:02] I thought.

[34:05] Ah, okay.

[34:08] So you're going to plunge it goes.

[34:11] You're going to plunge it goes like this and then into into what looks like.

[34:18] Some sort of mechanism or scoop or some sort of like some sort of like something.

[34:24] We're then to get to send the ball into the upper upper right area.

[34:31] But there's like wire forms.

[34:34] Oh, wait, what's going on here?

[34:36] Oh, wow.

[34:39] Okay.

[34:40] I'm seeing what I think if I'm seeing what I think I'm seeing.

[34:46] I'm just making a guess here.

[34:50] Can you do why don't I sense any excitement from you on this pin?

[34:56] Oh, oh, okay.

[35:00] Carrie, look at look at the wire forms up them in the middle of the game.

[35:06] They they just end at a certain point in multiple areas.

[35:14] I think I think the ball is going to fly from one wire form to another with a gap.

[35:22] I think I think the ball is going to end up.

[35:25] It looks like the ball is going to end up doing some jumps or like flying through the air.

[35:31] So I think you're going to see.

[35:34] I think you're going to see some cool stuff like that.

[35:38] So yeah, like I think you're going to see that.

[35:41] I think you're going to see the ball traveling through the air, not on a wire form jumping from one side to the other.

[35:54] Yeah, there's definitely mechs in it.

[35:57] There's definitely interactive stuff.

[35:59] I just can't make it all out.

[36:00] I'm got a little bit of a blurry image.

[36:03] There's not like a there's there's some major mech.

[36:08] I don't know what it.

[36:10] I don't want to show you guys.

[36:11] I don't know what it is though.

[36:12] It's hard to tell.

[36:16] You know, it's it's not like.

[36:18] I'll say this.

[36:19] It's not like.

[36:20] Oh, is that vulgar?

[36:21] It's not like looking down and seeing a big gorilla.

[36:24] Right.

[36:25] It's not like looking down and seeing a big sentinel like nothing.

[36:28] Nothing is jumping out that is just like.

[36:31] Oh, it's that.

[36:36] Any pop bumpers.

[36:40] Yeah, that looks like a pop.

[36:44] I think the pop on I didn't I don't know if there's like three.

[36:47] It looks like there's pop bumpers.

[36:50] Yeah, I can't tell if this is an upper play field or.

[36:55] But I think there might just be like one pop bumper up the center like near the back.

[37:05] So look.

[37:10] Yeah, like I think anyone asking Carrie and I like is this the next Godzilla like why aren't you more excited.

[37:18] I am curbing my over I get yelled at every time.

[37:27] Every time I get yelled at for hyping and then it not delivering.

[37:31] Okay.

[37:32] I just told you I think this will be the best shooting J.J.P. game.

[37:36] I think this game is going to be humongous hit for that.

[37:42] I do.

[37:44] I think people might complain about the artwork a little bit.

[37:47] It's not Frenchy good. It's not it's again, but I think seeing it in real color.

[37:55] It's going to be fine.

[37:57] It's just it's not the most.

[38:03] You know, it's.

[38:08] It's it's fine.

[38:10] It's not bad.

[38:11] It's it's not I can't tell again.

[38:13] I'm a little my images blurry.

[38:16] It does the I look all the attention is not going to be on just like the art near the flipper.

[38:20] So the attention is going to be on all the fun cool stuff.

[38:23] And again, just thinking about like avatar.

[38:26] And how beautiful that pin is to stand over.

[38:28] I think this is going to be like twice as beautiful to stand over and look at all the stuff.

[38:32] Because I think unlike avatar.

[38:34] You're going to stand over Harry Potter and see all this really fun stuff to shoot and stuff to interact with.

[38:38] And there's none of that in avatar.

[38:41] Do you see any chipping that's funny.

[38:44] Adam, you're funny.

[38:50] What is getting pulled on the arcade edition?

[38:55] Nothing is getting pulled from the play field.

[39:00] The arcade edition is losing a shaker motor.

[39:04] It's losing rad cows.

[39:06] It's losing glass trans light.

[39:10] It's losing inner art blades.

[39:12] It's probably losing maybe hot rail or hot rail or two.

[39:15] Probably one hot rail.

[39:17] I don't even think it's losing a hot rail to be honest.

[39:19] It's just everything that it's losing is cosmetic.

[39:23] It's not losing anything mechanical.

[39:31] Well, here is the thing is I think.

[39:38] This is like Jersey Jack just being like.

[39:43] All right, operators, here you go.

[39:45] You don't need all that fancy stuff because you're going to be routing it.

[39:49] All right.

[39:52] You know, for those of you who don't like the C.E. art or don't need all that.

[39:56] Like for those of you just joining Hogwarts Castle will be the C.E.

[40:00] Topper.

[40:02] I think what's I think the reason why you can tell I'm a little bit like.

[40:08] I'm not going crazy.

[40:10] I'll be honest with everybody here.

[40:13] It's because there's no FOMO right now.

[40:18] You know what I'm saying?

[40:19] If there was only a thousand of these and I knew I had one.

[40:22] It'd be a much different Canada right now.

[40:25] You know, I just don't have that like, oh, you know, because part of what drives a lot of that.

[40:31] Enthusiasm is I'm getting one and you might not right there.

[40:38] There's a lot of that with the whole collectibility of pinball.

[40:41] There's a lot of that like race to get your name on a list race to get that to me.

[40:45] I feel like that's over like so it like doesn't really matter like.

[40:49] You don't have to be anybody special to get one of these that's like it's probably a good thing.

[40:54] I was talking to Bill Brandis about this and I said this to him.

[40:56] I'm like, look, I think this game is going to be the best Jersey Jack game ever.

[41:01] I think it's going to sell so well.

[41:03] And he was saying like, well, the game is amazing.

[41:06] Then it's not going to depreciate and I said Bill, I want to stop you.

[41:10] I think this game is going to be one of those magical games where like you just buy it.

[41:14] And you don't even care about resale.

[41:17] And you didn't go in because of that.

[41:20] And you're just like, and maybe more pinball should be like that because I think one of the reasons why we've been so accustomed to talking about resale is we've just been buying so many games that deep down inside we know are not worth it.

[41:35] The effort wasn't there. The creativity wasn't there.

[41:39] The quality definitely wasn't there.

[41:42] And you just, you know, you get tired of it quickly.

[41:45] And I think this game kind of has that potential that if you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll never get tired of it.

[41:51] You can imagine like if Guns and Roses were like a great shooter.

[41:55] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[41:57] Guns and Roses has the fan base.

[42:00] But like after you've seen all the light shows, you're left with one of the worst shooting games.

[42:10] And the most frustrating gameplay games ever.

[42:13] And that's why Guns and Roses tank like it did because it's just like it's just not fun dude.

[42:19] It's like it's still a spectacle.

[42:21] The spectacle will never will never stop being amazing.

[42:25] You know, you put a Guns and Roses on in a dark game room with a couple whiskies in you and that spotlight goes across and all the lights are going crazy and you're cranked up the 41 with a pinwoofer system in your your Guns and Roses.

[42:39] Come on man, you know, you're not going to get that like that's not going to be the way you start playing Harry Potter or like Willy Wonka, you know, it's like it's got it's still got that factor of like yeah like it rocks.

[42:53] But it also gameplay wise sucks.

[42:58] And what I think everyone's like it's not the multi balls.

[43:03] The reason Guns and Roses sucks gameplay wise and I played it more than any pin I've ever played is the out lane drains are terrible.

[43:16] I think it is probably one of the most brutal on both out lanes.

[43:21] Brutal out lane drain games I've ever played and I've lowered the freaking post from the factory and it just wants to drain all day long on the left side and right side.

[43:34] I did move the out lane post it doesn't matter though every shot that bricks or ricochets or heads towards that area goes out.

[43:54] It's not about nudging it's not.

[43:58] It's just like it's not about nudging.

[44:06] Like I don't think I don't think you should just have to constantly nudge a game to make it be fun. I don't and I nudge but like to constantly have to be nudging every time the ball it's just.

[44:21] The other part I realized about Guns and Roses and you know the it's like I don't know like when you.

[44:29] After a while you just realize how.

[44:35] One dimensional the journey is. Right it's like it's it's such a one dimensional game.

[44:44] But the best moments in the game are not even the most fun moments are just the four not even four like I would say the two.

[44:56] The most fun in the entire game are the two album mini wizard modes.

[45:02] Show me play a game.

[45:06] And tear down the wall the Civil War one where you shoot the can to knock the movie posters like the game just needed more of that the demolition derby one isn't that fun and fighting the robot is not that fun.

[45:22] But it just needed more of that it needed to have a moment where you unlock the music video from one of those iconic songs it needed to have that like patience should have been a moment in the game.

[45:37] That felt really special and different you know it just it just doesn't it's just another song like I don't know like I just I feel like G and R again a game where.

[45:50] They just never kept going back to it and made it better and they never listened to any of the feedback.

[45:59] I'm probably just going to keep mine because it's at the point now where guns are roses collectors edition.

[46:06] Like if you really want to sell it.

[46:10] I'm I'm you're it's like eight grand and like I don't care I'd rather just keep it for eight thousand dollars like to me it's like enough of a work of art to keep for eight.

[46:20] Geez right I mean this was four geez my gummy bears you know it's like that was twelve thousand dollars this little neo geo right is that was twelve thousand dollars so like I'll keep it.

[46:35] And for and again before you start flaming me for this as go look up a s c 14 neo geo you can't even get them so don't don't don't start don't start with me I know I know what it's worth.

[46:50] Yeah it's a beautiful machine like guns and roses good in a deep collect a big collection when people come over it's fun there.

[47:02] Ken Cromwell's gone.

[47:06] I didn't see that comment and I'm yeah as I said on my podcast I wish Ken the best he was always very nice to me even when he didn't have to be and that's that's my feelings on Ken Cromwell.

[47:19] I use always very polite always very gracious and I'm bummed because like he texted me like a month ago be like can't wait to have you out here to see Harry Potter so I just don't something clearly went down and I don't know I don't even want to speculate.

[47:42] I don't know.

[47:45] I feel bad for him because he grinded it out across four mediocre games right like when you're working sales and marketing and communications like you grind it out in the bad years like you got you got you can you got to sell me godfather you got to sell these avatars.

[48:04] I mean you get to Harry Potter like finally all those years of grinding it out here finally my ships going to come in.

[48:13] He's not a part of it feels off to me.

[48:17] But that just goes to show you like whatever made him one out or made them want him out whatever I don't know.

[48:25] How to be really like significant of a like an emotional decision right not a financial one they don't need money emotional decision.

[48:37] There's no center post in the game.

[48:53] Well I can tell you this I would assume and maybe I don't know maybe the job at flipping out is going to pay more than the job at Jersey Jack.

[49:02] I don't know.

[49:12] The C and the wizard playfield art the same I don't know I haven't seen I doubt it there's always a little bit of a difference with C artwork on the playfield.

[49:25] I don't think there's a bash toy I don't see a bash toy there might be though again I'm looking at it from completely overhead.

[49:34] Does the playfield artwork match the cabinet artwork.

[49:39] The playfield artwork is more it matches the wizard the wizard edition artwork.

[49:47] And then yeah like you're not seeing any of that.

[49:52] It was it like normal you know I forget the name of the artist so Nima Lena I don't need Mepina I don't know what it is.

[49:59] You're not seeing any of that art style on the C.

[50:09] Yeah you're not what's interesting is I think this armors left over from Godfather it might be a different shade I hope it is but it looks like it's left over from Godfather.

[50:26] Does the car move I know I don't think so.

[50:38] The car clearly is probably just attached by a wire all all the holiday lily mountains.

[50:49] I don't think that car moves it there's no nothing it's not attached to anything that would move it unless it like spins around but I I'm going to go on a limb and say the car is not moving.

[51:07] So actor you know to me muted movie clips are going to be a big issue if that's the case.

[51:20] Isn't it crazy gang though if you go look at the stern star wars how completely hideous that game is like it is one of the most ugly games I've ever stood over on every every level.

[51:33] It is so ugly the artwork is atrocious the way the the tie fighter on a spring the lazy screen screen by the targets it is terrible.

[51:50] And I will I will verbally fight anybody that thinks that star wars by stern is a creatively good pin it and not only that Dwight destroyed it by like stacking movie scenes from the different trilogies on top of each other.

[52:10] The literally is like let's do everything wrong with a star wars trilogy pin and that is star wars.

[52:19] And the only thing that makes it fun for you guys that always try to defend it is that because you're getting hit with the themes on.

[52:25] Yeah because like it's like yeah what's getting what's your senses what's arriving at them is what you love so much but it is executed in pinball from so bad it's comical.

[52:40] It's terrible and that's why like I don't know like the rumor of the next board game is star wars.

[52:53] I mean I can't imagine they're going to do the original trilogy again and burn everybody you bought that star wars.

[53:04] Let me see if I can make sure my.

[53:34] Sorry I'm just real like reading something in email.

[53:57] I don't know how to cash in this money thank you for the $10 by the way town rumor I appreciate it I really do you know since I've stopped doing.

[54:11] Facebook lives I've sort of given up all my monetary rewards of these live streams so it's you guys have the ability to send money let me see.

[54:25] Yeah you got super chat.

[54:30] Nobody uses it carry how do you get people to use a super chat everyone here just I just I'm too kind I just respond to everybody.

[54:45] I also got a fear I had to like hook up my YouTube to.

[54:50] I really do appreciate it I can't see any magnets but there's going to be magnets in this game.

[54:58] It's hard there's not like a you know like if stern at a magnet there'd be like a big silver circle with like a terrible spider of above it.

[55:10] See I knew if I just like encourage you guys you guys are the best Allen thank you so much I really do appreciate it Robert thank you so much.

[55:19] Did you like the.

[55:22] Toad PhD Twitch link I sent you.

[55:27] I think I have to watch that TZD.

[55:32] No one can see code for potter if they order early.

[55:39] What does that mean Kelly I think people are going to see code I definitely think they're going to show some code Thursday with the reveal video.

[55:50] And cause this two stars love it.

[55:54] I hope so here's a thing gang unless the order window to get a CE is like 24 hours if it's like a week or two just wait.

[56:07] I'd rather with all these new games I'd rather them find the issues find the chip play field issue who find the mechanical problems and fix them and get a later build.

[56:24] Oh my gosh Hector look at you 50 dollars.

[56:29] Mexican 50 dollars how much is that in the way that Mexican 50.

[56:33] By the way Hector has been a great friend for many years Hector sent a beautiful formula one track outfit one Z for Cassian.

[56:46] And every time I go to a pinball show and Hector's there.

[56:50] It's like Hector's there Bill Brandness is there but Hector's taking me out for like Wago beef and bills just telling me how much money he makes a day.

[57:01] That's the difference between Hector and Bill I love I love both of them but that's the difference is one dude's like here's let me treat you to dinner the others like I made so much today Chris.

[57:13] I'm joking with you Bill I love I love the friendship's I've made in this hobby.

[57:22] Oh more.

[57:24] Put your PayPal in the screen and we can okay so my PayPal is easy.

[57:30] Canada pinball at gmail.com is my PayPal.

[57:36] You guys are going to make all the Canadian haters mad they still you know it's funny is you guys have just made.

[57:44] You've made up for.

[57:49] I thought this is like goals let's set a goal.

[57:52] I mean you 10 super chats $5 30 let's do let's do 15 minutes.

[58:04] I'll show the action button.

[58:17] This is what I should have done.

[58:24] I should have just like said this is funny I didn't realize you can do any this carry.

[58:31] You know it's funny is the so I have a goal for 15 super chats.

[59:06] I mean let's be honest Brenda is like just going only fans like you can get like men to pay you money to take your shirt off.

[59:13] Probably more men would pay to see that than women.

[59:17] My it's true it's true.

[59:22] I know he moved to California but you know the phones didn't stop working he just he stopped working.

[59:28] I don't mean why he's made so much money he works in Netflix.

[59:31] That's the funny part is like his he's doing better than he's ever done in his entire life but he lost he lost me as a friend which I think was the dumbest move ever because we were just such good friends Pete Rosen is here with 50 bucks.

[59:47] I mean I don't even know how to catch this stuff out like I'm going to figure it out I'm sure it goes somewhere right I mean this money's real.

[59:55] Pete Rosen is I think the number one.

[01:00:00] Donator and patreon to canada because because Pete's always the dude.

[01:00:07] Who was always on Facebook live with the 5,000 stars always right you mean just Pete I really I can't even thank you enough it's been.

[01:00:19] It's been a great run brother and made continue here this is great because I didn't even realize we could do all this you know and like what's funny is like people were telling me like well we should.

[01:00:32] It's crazy that like continue all right.

[01:00:39] I don't know so like it's the goals to get the super chats that's so weird the.

[01:00:49] The the amount of.

[01:00:53] Generosity in this hobby and you know like I always say like it's.

[01:00:58] If I could quit my day job and just sort of do this if I like read if I was working in a gaming or fortnight was the topic like and we know I like I instead of.

[01:05:31] Yeah like cause like that 99 cents man I can't get her a dinner worthy of a woman like that.

[01:05:39] It's funny you guys I love it.

[01:05:41] I love like that you embrace the the the Canadian panhandling the busking that I do like what cause the thing is like when I'm busking like this gang like we're all in on it.

[01:05:52] And we're all in on the joke but the haters are like.

[01:05:55] So annoying like he's dead and then they're like all the you know but they're actually like sincerely trying to like do all this work to get like money like.

[01:06:02] Oh here's my new t-shirt.

[01:06:04] Here's my stickers.

[01:06:05] Here's my that it's like they're doing all this work.

[01:06:07] And we're going to give away a translate tonight and they're doing all that work.

[01:06:11] And Canadian's just like I don't know guys like and it's like boom like 400 bucks like boom you know thousands a month like boom there's still like it's just be real.

[01:06:23] That's it.

[01:06:24] That's it there's no you don't need to do giveaways.

[01:06:27] The only thing you need to give away is an honest opinion that that's it.

[01:06:31] I think the only thing I've ever given away to everybody in this community for 12 years is an honest opinion.

[01:06:41] So thank you.

[01:06:44] No give away.

[01:06:47] I'm out of here.

[01:06:48] Yeah no I don't know why does anybody want to translate.

[01:06:52] It does you know what it is funny is like when I when I am.

[01:06:58] I was given a gunzer rose is banner.

[01:07:03] And I opened it up and I was like this is the dumbest thing ever I would never hang this anywhere and like I don't get it like this makes sense if it was at a trade show or in a deal you know distros warehouse or show room maybe not even like they're just like that just stupid.

[01:07:24] The most important thing is that they look stupid.

[01:07:29] They look stupid hung up on a wall don't do it if you have them take them down now.

[01:07:36] I think my biggest pet peeves I know I can't talk much about pins and when does but the other one is just don't store anything under your Pima machines.

[01:07:44] I like this the worst.

[01:07:47] It's like putting something it's like storing stuff under a grand piano.

[01:07:52] It's like it's a piece of furniture don't store anything underneath it.

[01:07:59] People are talking about doing here let's see.

[01:08:03] Doon got such a push down our throat out of the gate need to play one.

[01:08:12] Here's the thing here's the thing.

[01:08:17] The well first the reason why this was expensive is it's an Etsy artist it's you're supporting a small business she does it by hand you know it's like this isn't a mass produced product or item and I am.

[01:08:32] I ordered it larger like shipping it alone is like 800 bucks or something like crazy like that I don't know.

[01:08:41] The thing is this this thing is this.

[01:08:46] When Potter comes out tomorrow.

[01:08:50] In two days.

[01:08:53] The problem is is like I just think doon and Kong are just kind of like going to struggle not to be yesterday's news.

[01:09:02] And this is like a big problem in all pinball if you don't launch with like enough code.

[01:09:08] And you don't launch your game with enough magic and memorable moments out of the gate like you're like instantly forgotten you're quickly and that's a lesson that all these companies need to learn.

[01:09:22] There wasn't enough on week one to feel like you need it to own either Kong or doon.

[01:09:32] There just wasn't and there still isn't like they're just still isn't.

[01:09:38] And that's an issue now I think when Harry Potter comes out on Thursday and it's pretty much done.

[01:09:46] There's going to you're not going to be like waiting for this game to come to life you're not going to be like sitting around hoping you know they have a plan for the code and like I can't wait to see what this eventually does now it'll all be there.

[01:10:01] So I again that's why like you'll have a lot more fun month one with Harry Potter than you have with doon or like King Kong or predator.

[01:10:15] Now I said at the beginning of the show predator without Arnold is not not happening in my house like it's just not happening.

[01:10:26] So I think these guys need to learn that there are just non there's like non negotiables with some themes and not having Arnold in predator is a non negotiable.

[01:10:39] You either get them you don't make the game.

[01:10:42] I'd rather you make a last star fighter and have every asset from the movie and have all the synced up voices and actors or like iron eagle I'd rather have iron eagle with all the rights than predator without Arnold.

[01:10:59] It's just the way it is just the way it is.

[01:11:08] I know it's silly to think that Arnold he's a seven figure deal he's a seven figure likeness deal.

[01:11:18] Who's Chris Hansen.

[01:11:27] Yeah well.

[01:11:36] Arnold Schwarzenegger is a lot more expensive for name image likeness than Sigourney weaver a lot more.

[01:11:45] She was probably I'm going to guess getting her into alien I'm going to guess was like.

[01:11:55] The hundred and fifty thousand two hundred thousand dollars I'm going to guess that Arnold is like over a million for name image likeness in a movie in you know in a game.

[01:12:12] That you know and then Tom cruise is not even he won't even do it.

[01:12:22] Are you being Chris Hansen from the catch a predator.

[01:12:26] Okay now I get the joke sorry I'm just I literally did they even they don't even air that show anymore.

[01:12:34] You guys know why they don't air it it's crazy reason why.

[01:12:39] The whole reason the show went off the air is because like I want to say like.

[01:12:45] They they did they did an episode where they they expose I think it was like a rabbi as like a pedophile.

[01:12:54] And the dude just like right there just like pulled out a gun and like blew his head off.

[01:13:00] Like like I think as the cameras were there is something like they literally like it is like they just like they realize like well we.

[01:13:10] You know this this is like too far I guess now look.

[01:13:18] If there's anybody that should be publicly executed it's pedophiles.

[01:13:26] I mean that.

[01:13:29] I really do mean that.

[01:13:32] You look at you take an innocent you take the innocence away from a child that's why that's why go see what happens to those people in prison.

[01:13:40] I don't know how we got it.

[01:13:43] I just serious topic but that's why the show went away.

[01:13:46] The the SNL's get on it though is kind of amazing when when Chris and sin.

[01:13:55] Walks in on Santa Claus company here see that one where Santa Claus comes down the ChibDee is like sir.

[01:14:02] What are you doing in the house of like a you know in eight year old like can you please have a seat over here.

[01:14:09] I want to read for you like you know the messages you've been saying it's just like can't wait to give you my gifts you know it's like.

[01:14:16] It's funny it's buddy it was really yeah it's nothing it's it isn't anything to make fun of but it was like you know that's the that's the reason why comedy so important.

[01:14:25] And like why cancel culture was like the worst move ever in the history of humanity is like when you try to cancel comedians from.

[01:14:35] Giving us a of of reason the laugh about the things that causes the most pain you you literally have just ruined.

[01:14:44] The ultimate therapy of the human condition which is laughter and comedy and these like kids just wanted to cancel all so that nobody's ever offended and then everyone just miserable every day like me in my blue hair.

[01:15:01] Anyway everybody.

[01:15:03] I'm going to go to bed it's been great it's been real it's been fun but it hasn't been real fun.
