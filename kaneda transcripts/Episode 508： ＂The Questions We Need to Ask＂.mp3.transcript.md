[00:00] So right now as I'm recording this podcast there are other pinball media outlets on their

[00:28] way to deeproot as I speak right now it is Thursday morning and there are different media outlets

[00:36] converging on deeproot pinball to get a tour and a behind the scenes look at what is going on at

[00:43] deeproot pinball. I know Kerry Hardy is going I know this week in pinball is going I know the

[00:48] back box pinball podcast is going so there's some really great media outlets that are going to be there

[00:53] to look at what Robert Mueller and team deeproot has to offer the pinball community and I've

[00:59] been thinking a lot about this and I'm not making the trip now Robert originally invited me down

[01:04] there when they were going to launch stuff around March of this year and then you know the story I

[01:09] went off the airwaves and I think out of respect for me I did not get invited to go down when the

[01:16] show was off the air now I will say this I still would not during this COVID pandemic I would not

[01:22] have traveled to deeproot during this period of time I just put my family's health and safety first

[01:29] and I just don't want to be in an airport and putting anyone's lives and jeopardy to see a pinball

[01:34] machine because my parents are high risk and you you know the story you know what's going on in the

[01:39] world now that being said like many of you out there we are hopefully optimistic that what deeproot

[01:46] pinball shows the world is going to live up to some of the hype and some of the expectations and

[01:52] what I want to do on this episode of Canatus pinball podcast is I want to focus on some very specific

[01:57] things that I think the community needs to see to feel confident in deeproot pinball after all

[02:04] these years then I'm going to read some emails and then we're going to wrap and then we're going

[02:08] to see if guns and roses gets teased out tomorrow how does that sound so deeproot pinball has said a

[02:14] lot you guys know what they've said you've heard all the hyperbole all the promises it's been years

[02:20] in the making he's got all these designers from yesterday years over there millions of dollars

[02:25] had to have been pumped into this operation zero games have gone out the door and now we're at the

[02:31] period where it basically is the rubber is going to meet the road they really have to show something

[02:38] that I think I think sort of justifies the significant amount of time and investment that is

[02:44] gone into the project but here's my questions for deeproot and here is the things that I think the

[02:50] pinball media who are converging on deeproot right now I really think they need to ask some tough

[02:57] questions and I hope they see stuff that is super important to see at this stage in development for

[03:03] this company so let me go down my list of things I think we need to see from deeproot during their

[03:09] reveal over the next few days so here's what I'm expecting from my peers in the pinball media so

[03:15] first and foremost the most important thing that everyone's going to need to see after all of these

[03:21] years after all of these promises of of what's going on down there in Texas the most important thing

[03:28] is they need to see this company's ability to manufacture that is by far that is like 80%

[03:35] maybe 90% of what's most important to see is their ability to manufacture games and get games in boxes

[03:45] that is more important than any toys and any mechs any artwork anything else they need to show us

[03:53] that they can manufacture these games and along those lines the big date of when are they going

[04:00] to get games to customers now for those of you who have not been following for those of you who

[04:05] have not been following there's something that's been hanging over this entire company since it's

[04:10] creation and those are the zidware customers of john poppadook now they either got a payout or they

[04:17] were promised a game from deeproot now the date in which I'm hearing the zidware customers were

[04:24] promised raza games was September 30th now do you think deeproot pinball is going to get games

[04:33] into the homes of zidware customers by September 30th I mean that's less than two weeks away

[04:40] that means those games have had to already have been built need to almost be like on their way to

[04:45] some of these customers now I don't know if that's the case I'm just speculating that I find it

[04:51] hard to believe that those games are done now we will we will learn this and that is why I think when

[04:57] these people go on this tour and we see behind the scenes at deeproot if we don't see an assembly line

[05:04] and we don't see final games production ready games or production finish games completed what will

[05:11] the takeaway be what has been the hold up right I mean how many months ago was the reveal was

[05:16] supposed to happen in March of 2019 so you got March April May June July August September right

[05:26] seven months later eight months later I think it's seven months later right now we know COVID's been

[05:33] a hiccup but it wasn't that much of a hiccup for stern it wasn't that much of a hiccup for other

[05:39] companies and if you were ready to go in March why would it cause another seven month delay so

[05:45] that's the big question so what will they see in terms of this games ability to get manufactured

[05:52] in a timely fashion and to its customer base so that's that is like the most important thing

[05:57] people need to see now the other question is how many games will they show so we've heard before

[06:04] that they've got all these games and development and in various stages of development so will we see

[06:10] more than just raza and will we see a licensed theme and what will those themes be now I've heard

[06:18] some various things about what's going on over there what they're working on over there and here is

[06:23] what I think we're going to see I think we're going to see more than just raza but I don't think we're

[06:28] going to see a complete other game and if I were a guessing man you know canada's been ball podcast

[06:34] if I were speculating I do think you're going to see the artwork or something based on the license

[06:41] theme I was talking about to get interest up in the company and to make people want to see this

[06:47] company get to those future games so I do think you're going to see Robert do that now I get a little

[06:53] nervous with some of these strategies because it starts to remind me a little bit of what we've

[06:59] seen before in the boutique or the start up pinball world which is you launch with a game you have a

[07:05] major license and you hold that major license in the future and you dangle it in front of people

[07:11] as a promise of what's to come if they support your company and keep your company viable so I don't

[07:18] think that's going to work anymore in 2020 I think people are too smart now I think they're really

[07:23] going to need proof that you can get it done that you can send out a completed game that's got

[07:30] completed code that has quality materials and that works out of the box and I hope they achieve that

[07:37] I really do I'm rooting for them to achieve that but that is the big question mark because everything

[07:44] stems from there and I think we've learned in pinball that you know it's it's sort of easy to do

[07:48] to do the other things and this isn't a small operation that's the other thing this how big are

[07:55] their plans I mean that's the other question I have to is how many games are they geared up to make

[08:00] how many can they make a week this octo manufacturing they talked about let's see it I want to see

[08:07] them octo manufacturer game I is it octo is it quad manufacturing I want to see in assembly line

[08:15] in which we see the way all this works because remember we can't forget that a lot of these like

[08:22] things were promised to us as being the deep root difference that they would make games differently

[08:27] that the way stern was making games was archaic and the way that other companies were making games were

[08:33] outdated and this was all going to be different and new and the games were going to be easier to work on

[08:38] and all these things and that's great and that's what this reveal is going to have to show people

[08:44] like it really just can't be raza in a sexier cabinet and that's it right it needs to be more than

[08:50] that this is a walkthrough of deep root pinball and so I really think that the pinball media I think

[08:56] they need to find out as many of these answers as they can okay now because the other thing too

[09:02] and I told this I told this is some of my friends going there was like guys you do realize I think

[09:06] you have an obligation I think you have an obligation to find out as much of this information as

[09:13] you can because I would just be weary be weary of overly promoting something that you might not know

[09:20] is is going to work out and so we know the questions we need to ask and again because this is a big

[09:26] operation like this isn't a tiny little startup company that wants to make one game it'd be so

[09:31] much different if this was the beginning of a new spooky or the beginning of like riot pinball

[09:38] is desired enter the pinball marketplace you know if you're making just one game and it's a pinball

[09:43] project you're working on then all the focus is there like we were just making this one thing and

[09:49] we were going to bite off as much as we can chew and all of our efforts are making this game as good

[09:55] as possible I don't think I've ever seen a pinball company come out with this desire to make so

[10:01] much at once and do so much variety at once on some level that's really exciting to so many of us

[10:08] in the pinball world but on some level we also have to look at this and be so cautious that they can

[10:15] pull it off right because if what we hear during the reveal weekend and into Monday if what we hear

[10:23] is that they need pre-order money to make these games that is the other huge question I have that

[10:31] I hope the media really asks him about is is that going to be the case like do people have to pay

[10:38] in fall for a game before they get it and will people do that and how good do people feel about

[10:45] that and I said for that to happen for them to take that money from people they're going to have

[10:50] to prove that they can get these games to people so they're going to have to get those games to

[10:54] the zidware customers by the promised date now this is where all the talk this is where all the promises

[11:01] this is where all the expectations don't matter anymore words mean nothing now what you just said

[11:07] and we're willing to forgive some of the stuff said in the past but everything you've said up to

[11:11] this point it doesn't matter anymore it comes down to one simple thing can you execute and this

[11:17] company will now be judged by its ability to execute and we've seen so many pinball companies

[11:24] sort of stumble and fumble at this point right like companies that legitimately had assembly

[11:30] lines had everything ready to go had all of these employees we've seen them all stumble to sort of

[11:37] emulate the efficiencies of a stern pinball and yet even those companies who humbly humbly joined

[11:44] the pinball marketplace and the pinball landscape even they struggle to get games out so what

[11:51] would be like for a company that hasn't been humble and is boldly saying like we're here and get

[11:58] ready right get ready for hammer test get ready jody dankburg get ready stern pinball get ready all

[12:03] of you big companies that have shipped thousands of games we're now here it's going to be like in

[12:08] all or nothing thing there's no room here for like a wishy washi reveal so I really hope they

[12:15] have all of this figured out because if they don't or if you don't get all those answers and you

[12:21] don't see those things you need to see to feel confident I don't really think you get another shot

[12:27] so it's going to be a very interesting 72 hours or three to four days for deep root pinball

[12:35] and this reveal right the other question I have if we see more titles I really have a question

[12:41] of are these original themes going to resonate are they going to resonate with the pinball buying

[12:48] public I mean it is really hard it is really hard to come out with original themes right now I mean

[12:53] you're going up against Star Wars Avengers Batman guns and roses toy story all this stuff and

[13:01] my if I had one concern for deep root and their marketing strategy it's that they have gentleman

[13:07] who grew up in the 80s and 90s this is when these people were making games and these gentlemen have

[13:14] a vantage point of the 80s and 90s and they know what worked then but I'm here to tell you I'm

[13:21] not sure if what worked then will work now you know we've seen original IPs come out in modern times

[13:29] we've seen pat lawler with all of the resources he took three years to make dialed and we've

[13:34] seen the response to it I mean it was still a Jersey Jack pin it was still a loaded pin but that

[13:40] game fell far short of expectations far short so can they without a license theme without a juggernaut

[13:48] can they can they drum up enough interest and demand for these products it's yet to be seen it's

[13:54] yet to be seen and you're all going to make up your own minds this is what's exciting too you know

[13:58] ultimately we're all going to be able to look behind the curtain and I'm here to tell you right

[14:02] now canada hasn't seen anything I haven't seen anything I've asked them for stuff I'm basically

[14:07] going to see this stuff the same time you do or maybe a little bit before I bet we're going to

[14:12] get stuff from this week in pinball first Jeff's going to have a big exposé I'm excited to see it

[14:18] just as much as you are but I think we're all looking at it and we have to look at it with you know

[14:23] cautious optimism right we we do want pinball companies to succeed all of us do all of us want

[14:30] there to be new pinball designers in the world all of us want there to be new pinball games in the

[14:34] world but what we don't want is what we've seen time and time again which is like companies pop up

[14:40] they say they're making pinball machines they get us excited and then they fumble it and they find

[14:46] ways to either lose people's money or they find ways to drag it out for years and then ultimately

[14:52] nothing comes of those promises what's working in deep roots favor right now is very simply they

[14:58] haven't taken any money and because they haven't taken any money there's no angry customers the only

[15:04] people they owe anything to are those zidware customers and so that's up to them and believe me there

[15:09] are some very and I mean very vocal people in that community one of the people whose odogame is

[15:15] ice man and we know that ice man is not going to go down quietly if he doesn't get his rasa on time

[15:22] and so those people do have megaphone because remember the people that john attracted to his project

[15:28] were usually like very successful people they had a lot of money they had a lot of passion for pinball

[15:33] and they backed them and they've been burned for seven years like seven years ago these people gave

[15:40] john money for us seven years ago so they are really angry and really want their product and they

[15:46] have they've gone through so many different iterations of jpop's dream of you know a magic girl

[15:53] rasa Alice in Wonderland it went from zidware went from fantastic it went from American pinball

[15:58] and do we have think about it in all that time do we have a working jpop game that has been worth

[16:05] the weight all of these years of zidware and jpop saying he knows pinball it's never been worth

[16:11] the weight and in that time period how many games has stern made how many games is jersey jack

[16:17] american pinball chicago gaming company the list goes on and on and on and they knew all this

[16:23] like this company was founded with the knowledge of all of that like robber didn't have to pluck jpop

[16:29] robber grabbed the team he wanted robberds got Steve bowed in he's got david theo on music he's got

[16:35] enough talent in the house where people are expecting him to like blow the roof off this house

[16:41] and we're gonna see what they're capable of now we haven't heard much we haven't heard much you

[16:46] know Dennis nordman leaving is not a great sign Dennis norman hasn't said anything we don't know

[16:51] any stories but you know Dennis Norman also has a history of a bouncing and jumping ship but you

[16:57] know he's when he's jumped ship there's usually a reason so we'll see we'll see but you know all

[17:02] this is in their court and that's the ultimate thing with all of this is i'm just a guy with a

[17:07] microphone who's covering this hobby i want every pinball company to create pinball magic i have

[17:12] nothing personal against any of these companies i never have i really just want people to make the

[17:16] best games possible and i think deep root has set a lot of big things and now they have to back it up

[17:22] and so we really need to see what they create like was it all worth it and they they must know

[17:28] that we're all gonna look at it that way and yes there are some people that are immediately saying

[17:32] these guys are gonna fail and we know who those people are they're they're gonna have i think if

[17:37] you were to ask me i think they're gonna have the next two months the next two months are gonna

[17:42] be maker break and that's it like all these years all these millions two months they're gonna get

[17:48] i think people are gonna give them two months to show ship deliver and meet expectations they're

[17:54] not gonna get any more time like this is it this is where the this is where you run out of time

[17:59] when it comes to talking and the time is now to deliver and it's not the ideal time to deliver a pinball

[18:08] machine as a new company with Avengers with guns and roses with Chicago gaming company coming out

[18:14] with it's just a hard time it's a hard time but you know now is the time and but you know what it's

[18:19] pinball if you make a great game and they know this Robert news this if you make a great product

[18:26] the people will come i mean it's it's like there's never a bad time to release a great pinball

[18:31] machine let me just say that there's never a bad time to release a great pinball machine and that's

[18:38] what people expect because when you take this much time and you spend this much money and you have

[18:43] all these people who have done it for all these years how can our expectations not be super high

[18:49] all right so we're gonna find all this out but those are my questions for deeproot obviously we

[18:54] want to know how much are the games gonna cost how many are they gonna make i think that raza is

[18:59] gonna be a challenging game to market i really do i think they're gonna have to charge a lot for it

[19:04] and i think it's gonna have to be very limited and i think when he's looking at like how much it

[19:09] costs to get raza to market man it's like well we probably have to sell a ton but then we can't

[19:14] sell a ton there's there's not gonna be a ton of interest in an original game there's just not

[19:18] so it's gonna i'm just that's what as a marketer i'm so curious how they handle raza's launch you

[19:24] know what i would do i told you're ready i would say only two fifty at twelve thousand dollars each

[19:29] and i would just like chew on it pinball collectors and see what see what the responses and then go

[19:35] from there and i hope they have titles two three and four like pretty much ready to go but i don't

[19:41] know i mean i just i just don't know anything i am gonna learn what you learn in real time okay so

[19:46] let me read a few emails and then let's get ready people let's get the popcorn out let's get the

[19:53] beers flowing let's see what happens i mean not only are we gonna get avengers unbox i think i

[19:59] just saw like an avengers le was just unboxed which is unbelievable i mean even as i'm just like

[20:05] getting ready to wake up stern's already like finished revealing a game and shipping a game and

[20:11] manufacturing a game i mean i think we're gonna see another stern title in December i do i just

[20:15] they don't stop you can't stop stern pinball everything they do is on a schedule they don't miss

[20:22] deadlines that is the power of george gomes all right let me read you a few emails and i got some

[20:28] good ones here you're gonna love these i got some good ones all right all right so the first one is

[20:32] from nineteen seventy subject back better and stronger welcome back love the new improved version

[20:39] noted the lack of swearing amazing how it makes your viewpoint more credible and less ranteed you

[20:45] may be interested to know that american pinball have missed at least two opportunities to my knowledge

[20:51] of manufacturing for others by pricing themselves out of the market it's a pity because they

[20:57] must have spare capacity i suspect their pricing model includes recovering fixed cost when they

[21:03] should just be looking at variable cost and contribution to fixed cost i know that when they were

[21:09] trying to sell the company the price was based on what they spent not what the company was worth

[21:15] i.e. they wanted the buyer to pay for the costly mistakes they made when getting established

[21:21] they may have even included the cost of aborted houdini design by jpop from a patronizing advice

[21:28] don't get hung up on the patreon thing the twippy award is a more meaningful indicator of your

[21:33] standing in the community okay so wow first of all nineteen seventy thank you for the note and

[21:40] i didn't even expect there to be some like american pinball stuff in here so i think what he was

[21:44] saying is american pinball has had the opportunity to contract man you factor some of these boutique

[21:50] games that have been out in the wild but the price that they are saying it would cost to do this for

[21:55] those people is prohibiting those projects from moving forward and it sounds here too like they

[22:01] tried to sell the company i wasn't aware of this so i don't really know what's going on with

[22:05] american pinball it i know that they do screw together a great game and i wish they would just get

[22:11] more games out there and hot wheels was fine i think they learned a lot of lessons and that's what

[22:17] led to hot wheels but really this company needs to start making more games and i think they need to

[22:24] like look at some of these projects that people are making and finding a way to like get them on board

[22:31] with american pinball like don't you don't have to do it all in house but they haven't shown their

[22:36] ability to do that yet so we hope they do in the future so thanks nineteen seven i don't know

[22:41] who that is or what maybe that's the year you're born i got an email from scott goberg says aloha

[22:48] glad you are back podcasting i appreciate your content if jjp makes 500 ce's they won't sell out

[22:56] while i know you're excited about the pin it isn't going to move units more than wonka also deep

[23:02] route will have trouble moving three hundred and fifty games of an unlicensed title in such a crowded

[23:09] space looking forward to the releases and your comments enjoy the weekend all right so scott you're

[23:14] saying that jjp can't sell 500 ce's of guns and roses okay let's start there i agree with you

[23:22] i don't think they should offer five hundred at twelve five or thirteen thousand i don't i think

[23:28] two fifty is the magic number for collectors editions i think it should always be two fifty

[23:34] you know me if i were jazzy jack pinball i would stop with all this i think the formula for them

[23:38] i'm telling you they they're given there's they're giving their games away i would only make a

[23:42] thousand of each title i would do two fifty collectors editions and then seven hundred and fifty

[23:46] premiums i would do thirteen to fifteen thousand for ce's and ten to twelve thousand dollars for

[23:52] everything else and that you ask and hate me you can say all you want but look at what happens when

[23:57] they only make a thousand they can easily move on to the next title that if they charge that much

[24:02] i think that should pay for their r&d of these games and a handsome profit and put less stress on

[24:08] the company but they want to make more and that's fine and they can make more volume and they move

[24:12] them to a big space uh... but i just think that the way they do this with ce's and ellies that's their

[24:17] problem they can't call their premiums at least it's the dumbest thing it really is the dumbest thing

[24:23] the reason why it's dumb is you want to be able to make as many of those as you can because

[24:28] only the high-end rich collectors get the ellies at stern there's a reason stern doesn't put a cap

[24:33] on its premiums because you never feel like they come up short right or there they've been unsuccessful

[24:39] in selling that many premiums and they can also keep making those premiums into the future if

[24:44] demand far exceeds what they thought the problem with jersey jack when you call the premium in le

[24:51] then you have to put some stupid arbitrary number on it like we're gonna make five thousand wonka

[24:56] ellies that just sounds so dumb five thousand is not limited it's this oxymoronic marketing approach

[25:03] why don't they just say we have why don't they just follow stern's model the collectors edition

[25:09] is the ce then we have a premium version of the game which has all the features and it doesn't

[25:14] it's not limited and then we have a pro why don't they just do that calling it limited and it's not

[25:19] limited or it's wait and it's stupid because then you end up where he was with like wizard of

[25:23] us it's like oh then we sold out of all the limits and we don't even have a premium so now we have

[25:28] to make another limited edition and another limited edition they keep doing this can jersey jack team

[25:35] you haven't launched yet call it the collectors edition because I know you already have it call

[25:40] that I've seen it on the back box it's I see the name the next version of guns and roses should

[25:46] just be called guns and roses that's it premium guns and roses premium nobody don't call it

[25:52] guns and roses limited edition it's not it's such a bad marketing move okay but I agree with you

[25:58] and then raza selling 350 I agree with you there too I think they need to make just 250 razas or

[26:04] I think they're going to be in big trouble all right so I got an email from niles niles clemencin said

[26:09] thanks for returning I missed your content delivery no one comes close I wish someone with

[26:16] half your energy would cover virtual pin because the overlap continues to be less clear have a great

[26:22] day well niles thank you so much I'm glad you enjoy the energy and I will never cover virtual pin

[28:07] listeners and I think you know they should just check it out like what do you just want to check

[28:12] out why this thing is number one every once in a while I don't know I think we've we've had a good

[28:16] time with this show with the interviews we've had and all the stuff that canators pinball podcast

[28:22] stands for I love doing it wait I just got hold on I just got one more email just popped in a humble

[28:27] request dear canada with so many pinball varieties abound please forgive my intrusion I am not here

[28:35] to duel with giants but a piece from my creative cauldron I would like to share please wait until 12

[28:42] a one Friday morning to cast this image this translate is a mere portal to a magical world that

[28:50] awaits under a sky of glass farewell for now your friend what what is this let me see oh wow oh

[28:58] I I know what this is I can't believe he's sharing this with me right now to send to send to you

[29:05] all right so what I'm looking at right now is a translate image to the mystery game that that I've

[29:11] been talking about now see this is like I I fully did not expect to get this email like I I

[29:17] literally thought we were just talking about guns and raza so here's the deal here's the deal

[29:23] I'm just gonna I'm gonna share this with you guys on canada's facebook page tonight at 1201

[29:30] because that's what I mean that's what he's asking me to do here I've known about this project for

[29:34] a couple years and I don't you know me I don't really talk about it much and I've followed a lot

[29:40] of boutique pinball throughout the years and I've seen people start to make pinball machines and I

[29:45] take it all with a little bit of a grain of salt because I know it it's hard like it's not easy

[29:50] making pinball and I've seen bits and pieces of this mystery game and I've been talking to the guy

[29:56] every once in a while who's been making it and I've seen like sketches like you know and I've seen

[30:02] like some like physical stuff as well I've seen some CAD designs you know so I've seen enough to know

[30:07] that this I mean this thing's happening he's making it and unlike other sort of startups he's not

[30:13] taking other people's money he doesn't want to like show much and he's very secretive of this whole

[30:17] thing like I've been asking him for a long time can you just share something can you jump into the ring

[30:22] a little bit and so I'm shocked that he's he's asking me to share this with you guys I really am like

[30:27] I so I'm gonna do this and it's the translate of the game and it's gorgeous and I've always said

[30:31] this like the reason why I love what this guy's working on is the thing he's creating it's such a

[30:37] work of art and I've always said to him this is a game that's being designed for collectors it's not

[30:42] being designed for mass production it's not being designed you know like a deep root approach of

[30:47] where you're gonna stick it to Stern he wants to make a very small run of this game he's been building

[30:52] it for a long period of time and it's all about like his attention to detail and trying to bring

[30:58] pinball magic into a a game that is just if I were to like describe it the best way possible

[31:05] it's just gonna be a high-end collectible game for like the discerning pinball collector and

[31:11] and I think that's what he's trying to accomplish with this game and I think that I mean this

[31:15] are packages gorgeous I mean when you see it and I know we've seen our packages before in this

[31:19] that but again like he's not asking for pre-order money so I think you guys are gonna be excited but

[31:24] it is an original theme I will say that and you'll see what it is but I think it's the perfect

[31:28] theme for pinball I really do I think this if you were gonna go down a list of like open IP stuff

[31:33] you could choose like this is this is a good one this is a good one especially in a world in which

[31:38] we're like dying for pinball magic I really do think you're gonna gonna get excited by this so

[31:43] wow okay so 12.01 on my Facebook page check it out it's if for those of you who are listening

[31:50] to this who aren't fans on my Facebook page go to Facebook and search for a Canadian pinball podcast

[31:56] and just like the page and you'll be able to share this and it'll be up all right well great

[32:01] now we've got another game to just chew on in terms of a theme I there's so much coming there's

[32:07] so much coming I don't know where to you know for me personally I've always wanted this mystery

[32:11] game more than any game that I've that I've seen in the works because that's what I want you know

[32:16] that's what I want I want a rare game that not everybody has why is that such a bad thing to want in

[32:22] pinball why can't I have something that's not in every household or in every bar like that's what

[32:27] I want I only want if I can only have one I want to have one that's really special I don't want to

[32:32] have one we're like yeah see Ali but then they made thousands of premiums and everyone's

[32:36] having the same experience I that's just not what I want and different strokes for different folks

[32:41] now I just know there's a lot of high-end pinball collectors out there that really don't have

[32:46] anything that's that different or special they really don't like they really just have the same

[32:52] game like you might have an SLE Batman and think I've got one of 80 yeah but there's like any

[32:57] one can go get the same game right and that's what I'm just still shocked to this day that nobody

[33:03] has understood that that we have a high-end collector base that nobody is scratching that itch I mean

[33:09] look at like these fifteen thousand dollar L virus are going to those gentlemen and guess what all

[33:14] those guys who bought that game they're kind of suckers because you can get the same exact game

[33:19] for like half the price and then then you can say there's no pride in owning something that's just

[33:26] like a vanity play with artwork I mean you really need to have a game that you can't play it everywhere

[33:31] that's what I want so we'll see if this happens again like no promises for those of you guys wanting

[33:35] to get in on this mystery game like you can hit me up at canada pinball gmail.com but there's no real

[33:41] you know I don't know if like he's even like taking inquiries or wants to give any details but you'll

[33:45] see it you'll see it and and then we can go from there right how's that sound everyone have a great

[33:50] day have a great day I'll talk to you soon lots to come on on what deep route shows lots of games

[33:56] in the mix a great time maybe the best time to be a pinball buyer right now and I've said this before

[34:02] how do you not just wait to see all this all the dust settle and then go in you know unless you

[34:07] need the Ali unless you need the Ali of Avengers you're you're you're gonna be fine like there

[34:12] is Stern will make you Avengers for years to come you know this you know this everyone have a great

[34:17] day we'll talk to you probably real soon probably tomorrow again who knows can he hit a pinball podcast
