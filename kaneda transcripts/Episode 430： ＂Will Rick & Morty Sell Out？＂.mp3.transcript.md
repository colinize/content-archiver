[00:00] Oh, strapping kids, episode 430 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast begins right now.

[00:18] We're going to talk about Rick and Morty and will this game sell out in one day?

[00:27] That's a discussion about that.

[00:29] Stupid discussion about whether or not there's taxes in your state around buying Pimbal machines.

[00:34] The Star Wars Topper puts the plaque in a really weird position and Hot Wheels Pimbal.

[00:43] From American Pimbal, we're going to talk about whether or not we think that that rumored

[00:47] title is going to be the next game from American Pimbal.

[00:52] So let's do this.

[00:53] Let's flip it up a little bit.

[00:55] Let's start out with Hot Wheels because on the last episode of Canadian Pimbal Podcast,

[01:01] I talked about how I believe the rumored next title from American Pimbal is going to

[01:08] be Hot Wheels.

[01:09] Now, here is what has not happened over the last 48 hours, which leads me to believe

[01:17] that this rumored is true.

[01:20] I have not heard anything from anyone at American Pimbal asking me to maybe take it down.

[01:28] They haven't chimed in with anything.

[01:31] Now, last time I had a rumor about American Pimbal about Joe Balls or no longer being

[01:36] there, they immediately responded to me and said that that was false to please retract

[01:41] what I said and I did.

[01:43] But nothing, nothing.

[01:45] And we know that they are active on Pinside.

[01:49] And if this was wrong, if this was inaccurate, would they chime in and clarify that Hot Wheels

[01:56] is in fact not coming out from them?

[02:00] So I don't know.

[02:01] I'm a little bit torn on this because if they come out and they say it's not, okay,

[02:06] then they kill it.

[02:08] But if they come out and don't say anything at all, that still creates an atmosphere of

[02:14] speculation on whether or not it's true or not.

[02:17] Now as I've said, I know they're working on two titles simultaneously, one of which

[02:24] is a theme.

[02:25] Now the other thing I heard from someone pretty reputable in the industry was that Poker

[02:30] Run is also being worked on by Brian Adelson.

[02:35] Maybe that's his name.

[02:36] I'm not sure if I got that right or not.

[02:38] But there's no way that American Pimbal can be making Poker Run and Hot Wheels at the

[02:45] same time.

[02:46] I think Poker Run was meant to throw us off.

[02:49] I think it was, that was the diversion.

[02:52] That was the sort of smoke screen, if you will, to Hot Wheels.

[02:57] Now, let's talk about Hot Wheels for a little bit because I was fully expecting the response

[03:03] from Hot Wheels being the next theme to be not very welcomed and not positively received.

[03:11] And I have to say after reading everybody's feedback around Hot Wheels, I think the

[03:16] jury is divided.

[03:18] I think some people think that it's a terrible theme.

[03:21] I think some people are excited by Hot Wheels.

[03:25] But the excited camp to me is more about like let's wait and see what the game is.

[03:31] I don't think for most people it's a take my money now theme.

[03:35] I don't.

[03:36] And I've said this before, theme is really important and we're seeing what's happening

[03:40] right now with the Rick and Morty thread.

[03:43] And how people are already wanting to just buy a game they haven't even seen yet because

[03:50] of the theme alone.

[03:51] And that just goes to show the power of the theme.

[03:54] Hot Wheels is not a take my money now.

[03:57] No questions asked theme.

[03:59] All right.

[04:00] So what do I think?

[04:01] What do I think?

[04:02] I think some people out there who think that they should make fast and furious instead

[04:05] are idiotic because the fast and furious theme would cost way more money than Hot Wheels.

[04:12] Way more money than Jurassic Park way more money than most modern movie themes because

[04:17] if you look at the actors that are in fast and the furious, there is no way you are going

[04:22] to be able to afford the rock who's the most expensive male actor in Hollywood.

[04:29] And you have Vin Diesel.

[04:31] You've got Paul Walker got a deal with his estate.

[04:34] You've got Ludacris.

[04:36] You've got Tyrese.

[04:38] All these famous actors and then the music and fast and furious too is some of the most

[04:43] expensive music.

[04:44] No way I think we ever see a fast and the furious pinball machine ever because of that reason.

[04:50] All right.

[04:51] Now Hot Wheels is a way to see title for people.

[04:55] And I think it's going to happen.

[04:56] I really do.

[04:57] I think Hot Wheels is the next game from American pinball.

[05:00] Now, here's the other thing I heard about American pinball recently.

[05:04] And this just, you know, when we discuss theme and how important it is and we discuss

[05:10] like what people want in a pinball machine, how many, how many games do you think American

[05:15] pinball has sold to date?

[05:17] How many Houdinis and how many October Fest games have sold to date?

[05:22] Now, I've heard from a few very reputable sources and this is coming from within the

[05:28] distributor world and they know very well how well games are selling.

[05:33] What if I told you I heard that Houdini, I think they made 500 Houdinis and I heard there

[05:41] are still a bunch still in box.

[05:44] Okay.

[05:45] I heard the number that I heard there might still be in boxes between one and 150 still

[05:49] available new in box available either from American pinball or from distributors.

[05:55] Okay.

[05:56] Now, look, that was their first title.

[05:58] We know they rushed Houdini out.

[06:00] They made it in less than a year.

[06:02] But here's where it gets really bad for me is when you hear the sales number of October

[06:07] Fest.

[06:08] I mean, they literally did zero market research and they let Joe Balser make a game that

[06:14] he's always wanted to make and they made October Fest.

[06:18] I'm hearing that October Fest has sold less than 300 units, less than 300 and it's been

[06:28] out now over a year.

[06:30] They're still working on the code.

[06:32] They just did a big code update now.

[06:34] They're trying to sell people five prototype cabinet artwork versions of the game.

[06:40] Why didn't this game sell?

[06:43] What happened that made October Fest such an abysmal sales game for American pinball?

[06:50] But the real, the other thing is this how did they get it so wrong when American pinball

[06:55] came out and they first signed on with John Papaduke.

[07:00] Here's what I don't get.

[07:01] If you're American pinball, you have access to everything going on in the pinball world.

[07:07] You know what people want.

[07:09] You know how to make a game that's going to sell because we can see it happening left

[07:13] and right.

[07:15] You know you need a few things.

[07:17] You need a theme people want.

[07:19] You need great artwork and you need a world under glass where the game is designed and

[07:23] fun to shoot.

[07:25] And I don't know how they got two out of the three most important things so horribly

[07:29] wrong on the first two titles.

[07:32] They got the theme wrong.

[07:35] They got the art wrong and on some of them they got the design wrong.

[07:39] I would argue that like Houdini was too difficult of a game to pull people in.

[07:46] There wasn't even a white wood.

[07:48] The artwork very questionable.

[07:49] I still think they should have gone with the Mad Andrews artwork that he did for the John

[07:53] Papadu Koudini.

[07:55] Way better than the steam punk.

[07:59] But then Houdini it's like eh, you know, okay, maybe.

[08:02] Alright.

[08:03] But the execution was almost there.

[08:06] But I give them such a break on Houdini.

[08:10] It was October fest.

[08:11] There is no way they should have made that theme.

[08:15] It's up there with full throttle bad.

[08:17] It's up there with Mustang bad.

[08:19] It just ridiculous.

[08:21] So my question to everybody is this.

[08:24] What's done is done.

[08:25] It's happened already.

[08:26] They made that game.

[08:28] But who is accountable for that game?

[08:30] Who is accountable?

[08:32] If it was Joe Balser's idea to make that game and they put two years of research and development

[08:38] into it all the money to go into making that game, who is accountable for the abysmal sales

[08:44] numbers?

[08:45] Who do you hold accountable?

[08:46] See, that's the hard part with the pinball company because even though Joe Balser talked

[08:50] them into making it on some level, double, it's his company, he made the ultimate decision

[08:58] to go along with it.

[09:00] And so ultimately, he's accountable too.

[09:03] They're all accountable.

[09:04] The company went all in on a game that nobody really wanted.

[09:09] And it doesn't matter what a few pinheads who enjoy the game think.

[09:13] The game was a sales disaster.

[09:16] Okay.

[09:17] And I've said it from day one.

[09:19] Remember this.

[09:20] I had a American pinball wanted to hit me up and talk to me about licensing and merchandising

[09:24] and figuring themes out.

[09:26] Never heard back from them.

[09:27] And I was talking to my boy, Zach, many about this.

[09:30] Zach, I'm going to throw you into the show without your permission.

[09:34] Can you imagine if they just got a few of us, right?

[09:37] Maybe Zach, maybe me, maybe a few more people in the industry.

[09:41] Just got us together and said, hey, look, we want to sit with you guys and help us pick

[09:46] our next theme.

[09:48] After an NDA, a non-disclosure agreement, I could sit down with American pinball and

[09:54] help them figure this thing out.

[09:56] Because here's why it saddens me.

[09:58] These guys build great games.

[10:01] American pinball's quality is phenomenal.

[10:03] Their games are like tanks.

[10:06] If Dovel knows how to do anything, he knows that it builds something freaking amazingly

[10:10] well.

[10:11] And they've just been applying their efforts in the worst way possible.

[10:16] So will Hot Wheels be them turning the corner or will it not?

[10:20] Is it the theme people want?

[10:22] I don't know.

[10:23] I don't think it's going to be what they think.

[10:25] I really don't.

[10:27] And what I don't understand is this.

[10:29] They clearly have a lot of money.

[10:32] How do you have enough money to start a pinball company, but then not enough money to go

[10:36] get a license people want?

[10:38] I don't get it.

[10:40] I don't get it.

[10:41] But here's something a little birdie told me.

[10:44] And this little birdie knows people, that spooky knows people, other places.

[10:48] And he said, look, if you think for a minute that Stern didn't pass on Rick and Morty

[10:55] before spooky got it, you're crazy.

[10:58] And the ultimate reality is that most licenses that people want, Stern pinball has it or

[11:06] passed on it or sitting on it, right?

[11:10] And it's not that easy to go out in the pinball world now and go ink deals in which a manufacturer

[11:18] like Stern has all of the relationships, has 30 plus years of experience and gets the

[11:24] games out.

[11:25] I mean, you know, if I was Jody, imagine a sales tactic when you're talking to a license

[11:30] earner and says, hey, look, do you want to put your license in our hands and look what

[11:34] we've done?

[11:36] Or do you want to go with the boutique manufacturer and look what's happened in that world?

[11:39] And you could easily point at the majority of boutique companies that have failed.

[11:45] And also, you know, you pointed American pinball in how many years have they been around?

[11:50] And they haven't even sold like a thousand games.

[11:55] And Stern is selling 10,000 plus games maybe more a year, maybe 15,000 a year.

[12:00] And so it would take 10 years for American pinball to reach what Stern does in one year.

[12:07] It's absolutely incredible.

[12:09] And I want them to be successful.

[12:11] I want them to pick themes people want.

[12:13] I'm just not so sure that Hot Wheels is going to be it.

[12:16] I think it's going to be a wait and see kind of theme, but it's not going to be like

[12:20] pull the curtain off it and take my money now.

[12:22] All right, Rick and Morty, but take my now kind of theme.

[12:26] So what I want to talk about with Rick and Morty is the question of the day.

[12:31] And that is will this game sell out immediately?

[12:35] Will it, will all 750 be spoken for?

[12:38] So here's how I want to discuss this.

[12:41] And we're going to be talking a lot of Rick and Morty over the next couple of weeks

[12:46] because we're going to see the game.

[12:48] But before I talk about will it sell out or not, I think there's one really important

[12:54] factor that not a lot of people are talking about or maybe they are.

[12:58] But it's actually I think maybe one of the most important factors on whether or not

[13:04] Rick and Morty sells out and that is stranger things.

[13:09] Now I think there is a little bit of a silent race going on to show the game first.

[13:15] Like which game will be shown first?

[13:18] Will it be Rick and Morty, which we had now have confirmation that it's coming?

[13:23] Or will it be stranger things from Stern Pemball, which I'm hearing is already on a ship

[13:29] to Europe, which I'm hearing will be in our Cades and Bar Cades starting December 22nd.

[13:36] So that means they have to show it next week if that's going to happen.

[13:41] So we literally could have a two horse race next week between stranger things and Rick

[13:48] and Morty as both manufacturers are trying to get our money to get us to go in with

[13:55] what they have offered.

[13:57] Now as far as two huge themes people are loving when it comes to Pemball, I think they're

[14:03] both juggernaut themes.

[14:05] I think they obviously stranger things as much bigger has more mass appeal.

[14:09] But I actually think and I'm going to say this, I actually think Rick and Morty translates

[14:14] so much better to Pemball than stranger things does.

[14:18] And I've watched every stranger things season.

[14:21] I've seen every single show of stranger things.

[14:24] I don't think that kind of show translates as well into a Pemball experience because I

[14:30] think Rick and Morty will just be way more fun with the zany nature of the show, the

[14:37] hilarity of the comedy in that show.

[14:41] And the fact that you've got the creator of the franchise working with spooky Pemball,

[14:47] I think it's going to be so fun jumping from dimension to mention with all the R rated

[14:52] humor from the show in your Pemball experience.

[14:55] And to me, the prospect of playing that excites me more than playing a stranger things Pemball

[15:03] machine because I just can't see Stern putting all of the assets you would need to make

[15:09] stranger things incredible.

[15:11] And it's also just like, I don't know, there's just like the three seasons of stranger things

[15:15] are so radically different.

[15:17] They don't connect together as well as the four seasons of Rick and Morty, dude, because

[15:22] the Rick and Morty is kind of like a schizophrenic show where it's like every episode, it's like in

[15:27] a different dimension and all this weird zany stuff, but it all connects in a tighter way

[15:34] than stranger things might for Pemball.

[15:36] Okay, but that being said, I think Chuck wants to be able to get approval from Cartoon Network

[15:45] and Adult Swim to show us Rick and Morty as soon as possible so he can get those 750 non-refundable

[15:56] orders locked in before people see stranger things.

[16:01] I mean, they must be in somewhat of a race to get in front of stranger things.

[16:07] And that is why they are anxiously waiting to show us something.

[16:10] I think it's going to be early this week.

[16:12] I don't know for sure.

[16:14] But man, I think it would definitely impact the sales of Rick and Morty if stranger things

[16:20] were shown before Charlie can show us Rick and Morty and it's easy to understand why, because

[16:28] Stern is going to get everyone who wants a stranger things.

[16:32] Everybody who wants one will have the version they want within the first three months of

[16:37] the game being out.

[16:38] You won't have to wait very long.

[16:40] The problem for Charlie and selling out with this game and people have mentioned this.

[16:44] And I want to talk about this because the more I study how they're going to sell this

[16:50] game, the more I listen to distributors talk about it, Chuck talk about it, there's going

[16:55] to be an issue with this game and there's no avoiding it.

[16:59] There is just going to be far more demand for the game than there is supply and there's

[17:06] going to be far more demand for the game and to get the game in a timely manner than they

[17:12] can produce these games.

[17:14] I mean you ask any manufacturer.

[17:17] The biggest nightmare you have is not that people won't want your product.

[17:21] It's that too many people might want it in too fast of a time period and you just simply

[17:26] can't make the games fast enough.

[17:29] And Chuck is going to run into that immediately.

[17:32] But that's not the real issue.

[17:35] The real issue is this.

[17:37] And if you read, maybe I'm confused here and maybe I talked about this earlier, but I

[17:42] think it all boils down to one thing and one thing only.

[17:46] I think they're going to ask people to buy the game and give a non-refundable deposit

[17:53] before those people know what their spot number is.

[17:59] And I don't think you can quite do it that way.

[18:03] There is no way you can have everybody cramming through the door when those order banks go

[18:08] live and all of a sudden, what is it, a race?

[18:11] How you going to, I don't even know if their servers are going to be able to handle 750 people

[18:17] trying to order a game all at once.

[18:20] And then what happens is this, you're locking everyone in into a non-refundable spot and

[18:27] then they don't know what spot they are until after they've paid.

[18:32] And I think an analogy to this, and someone said this, I don't know who it was, but they're

[18:36] like, it's like paying for your dinner first.

[18:40] You go into a restaurant and you prepay for your dinner.

[18:44] But then the restaurant tells you it's a three hour wait before you can be seated, but

[18:49] you've already paid.

[18:50] So then you're like, well, if it, I would have left and gone to eat somewhere else, but

[18:55] I can't because I already paid for the meal.

[18:58] I think that is the best analogy of what happens if a guy comes through the door, what he thinks

[19:04] is right away and two weeks early, and all of a sudden he's learning that like he's spot

[19:10] number 685 and he has to wait over a year to get his game.

[19:15] And then he's going to be like, well, I think you're going to see a lot of head scratching.

[19:19] Now, what do I think is the solution to this problem?

[19:23] Here's what I think Chuck should do.

[19:25] And it's not too late to do this.

[19:27] And I know they listen to the show.

[19:30] Here's what I think Charlie should do.

[19:32] I don't think they're going to have any problem selling all 750, I can't even speak, 750

[19:39] Rick and Morty's.

[19:40] All these games are going to sell.

[19:42] I don't think they should have any of the insecurity they probably had around Alice, Cooper

[19:49] and Rob Zombie.

[19:51] They're going to sell every single one.

[19:54] What I think they should avoid doing this time around knowing that they're going to sell

[19:58] these games.

[19:59] Okay.

[20:00] I think they should remove the non-refundable deposit part of this scenario.

[20:07] That to me is the only big error in how they're handling it this time around.

[20:13] Because once you make it non-refundable, then I think what they're doing is wrong on

[20:19] a title with this much demand.

[20:22] They're then putting the burden on the consumer who now has to wait maybe six months or 12 months

[20:29] or 18 months to get a game.

[20:32] The burden of that consumer is if they want out because they didn't know they were getting

[20:38] a high number spot.

[20:40] And now they don't want it anymore because they don't want to wait a year.

[20:43] The burden is now on the consumer to find a new buyer for that spot.

[20:49] And I think that burden should be on the manufacturer.

[20:53] And I don't even think it will be a burden for Charlie.

[20:56] I just don't think it's fair to ask people to lock in not knowing where they're locking

[21:02] themselves into.

[21:04] And I think if he removes that, it's fine because here's what will happen then.

[21:08] Here's what will happen.

[21:09] Here's the scenario in how I would do it and how I see it unfolding is that the day the

[21:16] games go up for sale, Chuck opens up the order banks.

[21:19] I think he sells all 750.

[21:21] Okay.

[21:22] Now I think it's going to sell out.

[21:24] I think you're going to have more than 750 people who want the game.

[21:28] Okay.

[21:29] Now there are going to be people who realize they get a high numbered game that are going

[21:34] to wait a long period of time.

[21:36] Now some of those people are not going to be happy about that and they're going to want

[21:39] to get out.

[21:40] And that's fine.

[21:41] You let those people give up their spot and you sell it to someone else.

[21:46] But don't lock those people's money in.

[21:49] I wouldn't lock anyone's money in other than maybe the first 50 or 100.

[21:53] You know, lock people's money in and say, you know, when their order is final, like,

[21:58] this is it.

[21:59] You're done.

[22:00] The way you want your game, whether it's a bloodsucker edition with butter, cabinet,

[22:04] you have a window of period in which once you're to pause, it's required.

[22:08] That's it.

[22:09] It's non-refundable because we need to order the parts for your game.

[22:12] So maybe that's the first 250 people are locked in.

[22:15] But those people won't have a problem locking their money in because they know they're going

[22:18] to get a game soon, right?

[22:21] I think he's got to figure out a system in which not everybody's locked in.

[22:26] And he's never done it for 18 months commitment like this.

[22:30] And I think if he does that, it'll be a win-win.

[22:33] Because I do think there's going to be enough people out in the world who are okay with

[22:39] waiting to get their game and they're okay in buying a spot later on down the line.

[22:45] But I do think there's going to be a bunch of people who want to get out, who didn't

[22:49] realize how long the way it would be.

[22:51] And I just think the manufacturer should be the one who finds new buyers.

[22:55] I just don't think it should be put on the customer to have to go, you know, list it for,

[23:01] you know, for sale.

[23:02] Because also think about it like this for all those millions and Rick and Morty fans who,

[23:06] by the way, I don't think are going to be that aware of this before it's too late because

[23:10] remember, if you have to be a fan club member to get in early, all these things are going

[23:16] to be sold out before the adult swim advertisements start airing for this game.

[23:21] So they're all going to be spoken for.

[23:23] And so I think you're going to get a huge amount of Rick and Morty fans who come in later

[23:28] on and they're going to want the game.

[23:30] And it might be who've chucking company to maybe keep a couple hundred spots available

[23:36] for that fan base when they finally become aware of how this thing is going to be sold,

[23:43] right?

[23:44] Because right now I think it's, it's just pinheads on pinside and spooky fan club members

[23:48] that are aware of what's going on and how to get one of these games early, okay?

[23:53] So that's my suggestion.

[23:54] I mean, look, I think this is a good problem to have for Chuck.

[23:57] I do.

[23:58] I'm really excited.

[23:59] I'm in on the game.

[24:00] I really want a Rick and Morty pinball machine.

[24:03] I think this is going to be the game that goes in place of my Batman.

[24:08] I've been watching the show.

[24:10] I'm on season two right now, episode one.

[24:12] I'm loving it.

[24:13] It's such a weird show.

[24:15] It's such a weird show.

[24:16] I'm enjoying it.

[24:18] I really, I'm enjoying it.

[24:19] And every episode, I just keep thinking about how fun it is to have a Rick and Morty

[24:24] pinball machine cursing at me and Rick cursing Morty out for being such a loser.

[24:28] I love it.

[24:29] I love it.

[24:30] It's my kind of humor just to take a step back and be like, if you Morty, anyway.

[24:35] So I think that's what they should do.

[24:37] I think they need to figure out a way not to lock in all the money right away.

[24:41] But look, devil's advocate.

[24:43] If you're a Chuck in company, you're like Chris, what are you talking about?

[24:47] Let's lock in everybody before stranger things is shown, before Ninja Turtles is shown, before

[24:52] when Razz is available.

[24:53] If they lock in everything now, then it's peace of mind for 18 months.

[24:57] He doesn't have to worry about anything.

[24:59] He doesn't have to worry about finding new people.

[25:02] He doesn't have to worry about transferring over like people's specific orders to other

[25:06] people.

[25:07] It's smooth sailing for the next 18 months.

[25:10] So that's the other side of it, right?

[25:12] He either makes it easier for himself or he makes it easier for customers and finding

[25:20] that balance is, is, I know that.

[25:22] They're struggling with this.

[25:23] Believe me, I've spoken to them.

[25:25] I know they're struggling with this.

[25:27] They have never had a game like this.

[25:31] Distributors that are handling spooky games are struggling with this.

[25:35] They've also never had this kind of excitement for a spooky game.

[25:39] So it's all a good problem to have, but I do think locking people in who don't know they

[25:44] have to wait 18 months isn't exactly the best thing to do.

[25:48] Okay?

[25:49] But again, it's all pinball, right?

[25:51] Any of these issues, real issues?

[25:52] So let's see what happens.

[25:54] I'm excited.

[25:55] I can't wait to give my deposit.

[25:57] I got my money waiting for this game, all right?

[25:59] And I'm going blood sucker.

[26:01] I'm going blood sucker.

[26:03] Butter cabinet.

[26:04] You give me the works, Chuck.

[26:05] I want everything in this game.

[26:06] I want the salt, the pepper, the ketchup, the mayo, the mustard.

[26:09] I want everything available for this game.

[26:12] Why would you not order it with everything on it?

[26:15] Now someone said something funny.

[26:18] If most of what they make are butter, not butter, but blood sucker additions, then the

[26:22] non-blood suckers become the L.E.'s.

[26:25] It is funny when you think about it, but then by that rationale, the standard addition

[26:29] prior to the Caribbean are the rarest ones.

[26:32] Who cares about rarity?

[26:33] I think if you love the theme and love the game, you're going to want it the most dressed

[26:37] up as possible.

[26:39] Okay?

[26:40] Like, Willy Wonka fans, they want the collector's edition simply because it's the nicest version.

[26:44] There's nothing else.

[26:45] The gameplay is not different, but it's just the nicest version of the game.

[26:48] All right.

[26:50] Our war's topper.

[26:52] We weighed it two and a half years, and Stern Pimble is sending out a topper in which the

[26:59] plaque, the limited edition plaque, is on the back of the topper.

[27:05] Now normally I would just add in a Marty Lattrac there, but what the f***?

[27:10] Like, who decides these things?

[27:15] Even if it was Lucas and Disney that decided that they had to do that, it's stupid.

[27:22] It's asses of nine.

[27:23] Why would you put a plaque on the opposite side of a topper?

[27:28] You'll never see it.

[27:30] The only moment in which you'll see that plaque is when you are taking the thing out of

[27:35] the box and then installing it, and then it's gone.

[27:37] It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

[27:39] It's just, you know what it is?

[27:40] It's the icing on the cake to what I think is the dumbest topper ever at $750.

[27:46] This just adds insult to injury that the damn plaque that they kept touting, you can't

[27:52] even see it.

[27:53] You can't even see it.

[27:55] I mean, come on.

[27:56] This whole thing, you know, the whole topper discussion of 2019 is probably being one

[28:01] of the most exhausting and dumbest subject matters that we've ever discussed in the Pimble

[28:05] World.

[28:06] Let me say this, a topper should ship with a game.

[28:11] Is it that hard to have a topper division that has their damn thing ready when the game

[28:17] is ready?

[28:18] And here's the other part too.

[28:19] This is where I think companies get tripped up.

[28:21] It's often times when they do the contracts with the licensor, they don't put the topper

[28:29] in as part of the entire package that they're licensing.

[28:33] And I think that's what holds up some of these toppers is they have to go back and get

[28:38] another round of approval because they didn't have it in there originally.

[28:42] But people like toppers, and I've been saying this toppers are a great revenue stream.

[28:48] But man, freaking, who wants to wait two and a half years and have the plaque on the back

[28:53] of the damn thing?

[28:54] All right.

[28:55] What else is going on in Pimble?

[28:56] Oh man.

[28:57] I've been trying to like, I'm trying to look at like what games have been for sale.

[29:02] There's a lot of games going up for sale.

[29:04] People are making room for stuff.

[29:05] There's a lot of really good deals to be had.

[29:08] I think one of the worst sales is some guy was offering, he wanted $9,000 for a used

[29:14] Munster's Ellie.

[29:15] And then immediately like the next day was $8,800 or $8,500.

[29:20] Someone forgot to tell him that Munster's Ellie's are now like $7,800, like $7,500.

[29:28] Munster's second hand pricing has tanked.

[29:32] Tanked.

[29:33] I mean, you can get like a premium now.

[29:35] Beautiful premium black and white Munster's for like $6,500.

[29:39] And that price is going to keep going down and down and down.

[29:47] It is a great time to be a second hand Pimble buyer.

[29:53] But here's, I would just keep waiting.

[29:55] Look, we all know this.

[29:56] In the next six months, the oversaturation of titles is going to lead to so many good

[30:03] deals to be had.

[30:04] I can't wait.

[30:05] I can't wait.

[30:06] But you know what?

[30:07] When you look at Rick and Morty frenzy, you know, people want the new stuff.

[30:12] People want what's next.

[30:13] They will always want what's next in a category like this.

[30:16] And Rick and Morty is a great theme.

[30:19] It's going to be a crazy week watching how this thing unfolds.

[30:22] And the craziest part is this.

[30:24] And then I'll let everybody go.

[30:26] Like 44 pages of hysteria.

[30:29] Everyone's trying to bang on the door to get one.

[30:31] Everyone's worried it's going to sell out.

[30:33] We haven't even seen a god damn thing.

[30:38] We saw the underside of the cabinet.

[30:40] And by the way, I'm here to confirm that the the right slingshot is not a slingshot.

[30:44] It's a pop bumper.

[30:46] That's what it is.

[30:47] It's not a sling.

[30:47] It's a pop.

[30:49] And I heard it's so much fun that Scott even wanted to have both of them be pop bumpers.

[30:52] But you know, you got to have a little bit of a traditional design and people go nuts.

[30:56] But we haven't even seen the game.

[30:58] Will it live up to the hype?

[31:00] I mean, we're going to find out this week.

[31:01] No, I'm almost at the point where like nothing could live up to this hype.

[31:06] But you know, that's pinball.

[31:08] We hear about something we want.

[31:10] And in our minds, it's the greatest thing ever.

[31:13] But it's still going to just be a pinball machine, people.

[31:16] Don't think it's actually going to transport you from one dimension to the other.

[31:20] But we didn't talk about the underside of the play field that we saw.

[31:24] But you know, it looks like there is a portal.

[31:27] There's a subway though.

[31:28] I think one ball is going to go into the portal and it's going to come out somewhere else.

[31:31] I think there's going to be three flippers.

[31:34] I think there's a magnet.

[31:35] I think there's a pop bumper where the sling is.

[31:37] There's going to be, I don't know.

[31:39] I don't want to talk about the underside of a play field.

[31:43] We're going to see it this week.

[31:44] We will see it this week.

[31:45] So a lot more discussion coming.

[31:48] I do think they're going to sell out.

[31:51] But I do think people are going to be unhappy if they're way down the line.

[31:53] And I do think spooky should let people get their money back or transfer those spots over

[31:59] without taking deposits after a certain amount.

[32:02] I would say like, look, the first 250 people we have to lock in or maybe make it 500 or

[32:08] after that, you know, we'll give you the option because we've never done over 500 games.

[32:12] So we're going to give you the option to sell your spot if you don't want it.

[32:15] Here's what happens.

[32:16] Here's what happens when you tell people what.

[32:18] We'll sell your spots to someone else.

[32:20] All they've got to say is we have a huge weight list of people to get a game.

[32:23] Are you sure you want to sell it?

[32:24] And everyone's going to be like, nope, I'll keep it.

[32:26] That's all you got to do.

[32:28] It's easy to be like, all let it go because it'll come back again.

[32:31] If you just, if you just tell people it, maybe it won't come back again, but it will.

[32:36] For those of you out there, every game becomes available.

[32:40] Every game.

[32:41] You're going to be able to get a Rick and Morty spot at, you know, for basically what

[32:45] someone else paid for it.

[32:47] 750 is not that small of a number.

[32:52] It's not.

[32:53] People underestimate how few people out there in the world actually care about Pimbal.

[32:58] Let alone have this kind of money to spend on Pimbal machines.

[33:01] It's not as big as people think.

[33:04] It's not as big as, I mean, think of money.

[33:05] Look at how many fans the Beatles have.

[33:07] Like, where was that fan base?

[33:09] Those people have tons of money.

[33:11] They did not swoop in and buy the game.

[33:14] You guys want a little rumor at the end of this podcast?

[33:17] Can I end with something I haven't said before?

[33:20] Let's see.

[33:21] Okay, let's do it.

[33:22] You know me, because I'm so good with rumors.

[33:25] I get them right.

[33:26] Half of the time, my rumors are right all of the time.

[33:29] But here's what I heard is happening.

[33:31] Here's a really interesting rumor.

[33:34] I heard and take it for what it's worth.

[33:37] I heard that Harry Potter Pimbal may be a reality.

[33:45] Well, let me backtrack.

[33:47] I heard that Harry Potter Pimbal is being pursued and it is being pursued by Kapow.

[33:56] And that a foam core version of the game was submitted to Warner Brothers and Rowling's

[34:04] company for possible approval.

[34:08] So a treatment of what a Harry Potter Pimbal machine could be was put out there.

[34:15] So I know that Harry Potter would be a beyond juggernaut theme.

[34:19] It would be the biggest thing probably ever to happen to Pimbal, because it is the most

[34:24] contemporary, biggest franchise next to like Star Wars.

[34:29] But Harry Potter I think would just, I don't know, people would just lose their minds

[34:34] for it.

[34:35] So that is what I heard.

[34:36] As much as we've heard, like JK Rowling doesn't like Pimbal, Kapow and Joe Kamikaw, if there

[34:44] is anybody that could ink a deal and figure out a way, it's him.

[34:49] And so that's what I'm hearing.

[34:51] Harry Potter by Kapow being explored.

[34:56] Let's use that word.

[34:57] It's being explored.

[34:58] All right.

[34:59] So don't, don't hold, so imagine that though.

[35:02] Harry Potter 2020 as a Kapow Stern title.

[35:05] Wow.

[35:06] See, it just, this is why I sold two Pimbal machines and put like 32K in the bank, because

[35:11] I just, it's just fun to wait and see what comes out.

[35:15] It's more fun to do this than it is to just run in by like every single game.

[35:20] I mean, I feel so bad for Fralic.

[35:22] He like bought every single Stern machine just during the wrong period of time.

[35:27] He should await it.

[35:29] He should await it.

[35:30] Anyway, everyone, have a great weekend.

[35:32] We're going to be back with more episodes of Canadian Pimbal Podcasts.

[35:36] And obviously we are going to see Rick and Morty soon.

[35:39] I want to get Scott Denise on the show.

[35:41] I want to get Chuck and Company on the show.

[35:43] We're going to get everyone we can on the show.

[35:46] I look forward to seeing the madness this week.

[35:48] It's going to be an awesome week.

[35:50] So yeah, you'll probably hear from me like, who knows?

[35:52] It could be tomorrow if they showed the game tomorrow night.

[35:55] We'll be back real soon.

[35:57] Trust me on that.

[35:58] Have a great day, everybody.
