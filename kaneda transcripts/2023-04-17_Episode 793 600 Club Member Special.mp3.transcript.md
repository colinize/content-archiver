[00:00] Tell you, then, I'm sorry, tell me, what I gotta do,

[00:04] Because the chemical, it's chemical

[00:10] But the chemical, it's chemical

[00:14] CELOSETA CELOSETA CELOSETA CELOSETA CELOSETA

[00:19] Happy Monday morning everybody!

[00:21] It's the world's most financially successful pinball podcast,

[00:25] Canadian Pinball Podcast, and that is thanks to each and every one of you.

[00:29] We did it, we reached a new threshold.

[00:31] Now look, I had to use a little bit of a marketing tactic.

[00:34] Thank you Mr. Kim Mitchell for the support on this one.

[00:37] But we have not just reached 600 club members,

[00:40] we are now at 609 club members.

[00:43] And if you haven't heard the special,

[00:45] we're going to give some of these new club members a special monetary reward

[00:50] for putting this show over 600.

[00:52] But I mean it when I say it.

[00:54] The only reason this show is over 600 is because of each and every one of you.

[00:58] It's not easy doing this show year after year.

[01:01] It's not easy filling the empty void with news,

[01:04] rumors, and speculation about what's going on in the pinball world.

[01:07] And I really do hope I've been an entertaining part of your weekly routine

[01:13] over the last few years.

[01:15] If you're new to Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[01:17] I hope you're enjoying the show.

[01:19] And I think you're getting a sense of why people like this show so much.

[01:23] Now look, as we reach this new mountaintop

[01:26] and no one is even close to achieving,

[01:28] as we reach over 600 club members,

[01:31] we're also seeing people bail out of the pinball media space.

[01:35] And as I was thinking about this show,

[01:37] I could talk about the new games,

[01:39] I could talk about what's happening with the pinball companies,

[01:41] and we will do that, and I will do that again this week.

[01:44] But I wanted to take this episode and talk about why I think

[01:48] Canadian Pinball Podcast is needed in the pinball world

[01:51] and why I think having a voice like mine

[01:54] and looking at these companies and looking at these games

[01:57] and the way I look at them is important.

[02:00] And look, we're all just making pinball content, right?

[02:03] I mean, there are shows out there that are being made by people who work for the companies.

[02:07] There's people making shows out there that are actually selling you the product.

[02:11] And I'm just a pinball podcaster that's an observer

[02:14] of what's going on in the pinball space.

[02:16] And I've said it since day one.

[02:18] Like, I'm not a league player, I'm not the best pinball player,

[02:20] so I wouldn't go off of what I say when it comes to maybe gameplay and rulesets

[02:25] because I really don't want to spend hours of my life studying a pinball ruleset.

[02:29] And I don't think anyone should.

[02:31] I think a pinball machine should be enjoyable,

[02:33] and I think it should give magical moments without having to read a Bible

[02:38] on how to stack a million things,

[02:40] and that's never what pinball was supposed to be.

[02:42] And I still believe to this day that a pinball machine

[02:46] should have mechanical magic under the glass,

[02:49] as well as moments of magic that are coded by the software team.

[02:53] I think when all of it comes together,

[02:55] when the code is amazing, when the art is amazing,

[02:58] when the theme is amazing, when the shot layouts are amazing,

[03:02] and when there's toys in the game that are doing really awesome stuff,

[03:05] when all of that comes together,

[03:07] I think there is nothing like pinball in the world.

[03:10] There's nothing like it.

[03:12] You can't digitize pinball, it just doesn't work.

[03:15] It's also a very unique toy because as time goes by,

[03:19] and I've been thinking about this more and more lately,

[03:22] as time goes by, there's only so much you can innovate

[03:26] when it comes to a pinball machine,

[03:28] and I was thinking about all the new games we just saw at Texas Pinball Festival,

[03:31] and if you ask a question like, where is the innovation,

[03:35] or who is doing stuff that's radically new with any of these machines,

[03:39] and the answer is none of it.

[03:41] Like there is nothing really innovative happening anywhere in pinball.

[03:45] You know, it's like crazy, like we're in 2023,

[03:48] and most pinball machines aren't really connected to the internet

[03:52] in a way that makes them super enjoyable.

[03:55] Like hardly any pinball companies give you the ability

[03:58] to play against people over the internet when you both have the same machine.

[04:03] I mean, that's just nuts.

[04:05] That's just nuts to me, that like a game like Ninja Turtles,

[04:08] that we can't have a four-player experience.

[04:11] Like if you get four friends who have a Ninja Turtle,

[04:14] each person assumes the role of one of the turtles,

[04:17] and they make some special code where everyone can play together

[04:20] against Shredder and the Foot Clan.

[04:22] I also just like versus play, like why can't you do that?

[04:26] Like why can't you hook up two machines in which I'm playing a friend,

[04:30] and it doesn't matter where the outlaying posts are set up,

[04:33] it's all about me battling my friend in this game.

[04:36] So you could take a game like Godzilla,

[04:39] and one player gets to be Godzilla,

[04:41] and the other player is trying to stop Godzilla.

[04:44] So maybe as one player is hitting shots and destroying things,

[04:49] that changes the lights on your friend's game,

[04:52] and you have to try and take down Godzilla before he destroys the city.

[04:56] Why can't we do that, right?

[04:57] So there's not much innovation.

[04:59] The only thing they've really been innovating in the world of pinball lately

[05:03] is how much money can they charge us for the same exact product

[05:08] year in and year out.

[05:09] Can you imagine any other category where it's something like this

[05:13] where there's not a lot of innovation?

[05:15] Imagine if all of your video games, the graphics,

[05:18] stayed exactly the same for the next 20 years.

[05:22] Would you spend more money on a video game console?

[05:25] Would you be buying games for like 30% more money?

[05:28] No, like it's kind of crazy that pinball from an engineering standpoint

[05:32] has been pretty static lately,

[05:34] and yet the prices are 30% to 40% more.

[05:37] And you know, Canadian Pinball Podcast, I harp on this all the time,

[05:41] and I think we need a voice like mine in this hobby

[05:45] because we should be holding these companies accountable,

[05:48] not just for the quality of their product,

[05:51] but for the value in their product.

[05:54] And trust me, they don't want Canada to be on the airwaves.

[05:58] They want you to buy everything they make.

[06:01] They want you to celebrate every move they do.

[06:05] They want you to look at every single pinball machine

[06:08] like we should be celebrating its presence in the world.

[06:12] And when you listen to the Canadian haters,

[06:14] that's always the number one thing they always say.

[06:17] Like we have some sort of responsibility

[06:20] to celebrate the companies and the people who make these machines,

[06:24] and we should hold them to a higher standard than everybody else

[06:28] simply because they make a for-profit pinball machine.

[06:32] And my stance has always been this.

[06:35] No, you're not a rock star in pinball until you make a rock star game.

[06:40] You know, and I try to as much as possible,

[06:43] like avoid the drama in the pinball space.

[06:46] You know, a lot of people who say they don't like

[06:48] Canada's Pinball Podcast and they think I'm toxic,

[06:51] they haven't listened to the show in like two years.

[06:54] And I used to be a lot more strident years ago,

[06:58] but I learned a long time ago that doing a pinball podcast is only fun.

[07:03] It's only fun for you, the listener, if I enjoy doing it.

[07:07] Like my positive energy and my vibes are going to rub off on you as the listener.

[07:12] And there is no way that you could do two to three pinball podcasts a week

[07:16] and a 90-minute Facebook Live every single week

[07:20] plus random Facebook Live encounters with my community all week long

[07:25] if I wasn't enjoying it.

[07:27] And I love doing this.

[07:29] And as much as people would love me to stop doing it,

[07:32] it's kind of amazing that we're all here in the Canada Club

[07:35] because what this club does and why this club number is so significant,

[07:39] and that's me also asking nicely,

[07:41] if you joined the Canada Club this last week, do not leave.

[07:43] Trust me, you're going to get the most entertaining pinball podcast.

[07:46] The reason why this is so significant,

[07:48] that we have over 600 people here listening week in and week out,

[07:53] we've got 2800 people on freaking Facebook Live listening to all that content.

[07:59] The reason it's significant, that's a decent number of people

[08:02] considering how many pinball machines these companies sell.

[08:06] So that's like 60% of potential buyers of a Stern LE or a Jersey Jack CE.

[08:13] And if we take into account my Facebook Lives,

[08:15] which reach around like 1500 people watch every Saturday morning spectacular,

[08:20] what I say on that show, you know,

[08:22] it has the power to potentially influence some people.

[08:25] Now, as I always say on this show,

[08:28] when you listen to Canada Spinball Podcast,

[08:30] you also need to make up your own mind on the games that you want to buy.

[08:34] And ultimately, I want each and every one of you to be happy and healthy in life.

[08:39] That's my number one priority.

[08:41] I think everybody should take care of themselves and their health first and foremost.

[08:45] Then take care of your finances first and foremost.

[08:48] Then take care of your family.

[08:50] Well, put family in front of finance.

[08:52] Put your personal health, your family's health, then your finances,

[08:56] and then and then only then should you start thinking about buying pinball machines.

[09:02] And if you've got all of those things lined up in the right order,

[09:06] and you've been taking care of those things in the right order,

[09:09] I hope you all live a very long, happy, and healthy life that is filled with pinball magic.

[09:16] That's the only reason we're here.

[09:19] All of us make a decision every single week.

[09:22] Do we want to get into something, right?

[09:24] I think hobbies are so important.

[09:26] I think the happiest people take little things like pinball machines or watches or cars.

[09:31] They take things that are pretty meaningless on a spiritually fulfilling level,

[09:36] and we give them meaning.

[09:38] And the reason they have meaning is because it brings a lot of people together.

[09:42] And our lives would be a lot emptier if we removed these hobbies from our lives.

[09:48] And I don't think they're a bad thing.

[09:50] I don't think they're a negative thing.

[09:52] I don't think they're a toxic thing.

[09:54] I think each and every one of us needs something to geek out over.

[09:58] Yes, life can be pretty boring.

[10:00] Yes, it sucks sometimes when you don't get to call your own shots on your terms in life.

[10:05] Sometimes we all have jobs that suck.

[10:07] Sometimes we have jobs that are great.

[10:09] Sometimes we make a lot of money for doing nothing,

[10:11] and sometimes we work really hard and get nothing in return.

[10:15] And that is the dichotomy of life.

[10:18] But a pinball freaking podcast should exist for one reason and one reason only.

[10:23] And that is to entertain each and every one of you.

[10:26] And that is why you are here.

[10:28] And the other reason why this 600 number is so significant,

[10:31] if all these haters were right,

[10:33] and if I was doing all of the negative stuff they say I do,

[10:38] then why would anybody be here?

[10:40] Why would anybody sign up?

[10:42] Why would anybody follow me unless I was saying something that resonates with people?

[10:49] Unless I was saying something that needs to be heard.

[10:52] We've all seen it, people.

[10:54] We've seen moments where, like, manufacturers were shipping you defective games,

[10:59] and nobody else wanted to talk about it,

[11:02] or they would talk about it once and then never talk about it again.

[11:06] And I would keep beating that drum, keep kicking that dead horse,

[11:10] until we got some change, and change came.

[11:14] But sometimes change only comes when people are unhappy with stuff.

[11:20] And if we celebrate everything in pinball,

[11:22] how are you ever going to get more positive change in pinball?

[11:26] And that's where I'm at.

[11:28] Now, look, I wasn't going to do this, but I think I want to do this

[11:31] because this to me reminds me why I do this show.

[11:34] And I want to read something for you that someone wrote recently

[11:38] as they decided to turn off their podcast.

[11:41] So as I'm reaching the top of the Pinball Podcasting Summit,

[11:45] over 600 subscribers, Mr. Christopher Franci, you know him very well,

[11:50] he's turned off his show, but it's not just that.

[11:53] He's never pinball podcasting again.

[11:55] And I want to read for you something he wrote today

[11:58] as he exits his pinball podcasting career, if you will.

[12:02] And I'm going to stop throughout and give my response to some of these comments.

[12:06] All right, here we go. Ready?

[12:07] As I ponder my retirement from podcasting,

[12:10] those who choose to speak into a mic,

[12:13] presuming the rest of the world wants to hear what you have to say,

[12:17] remember this, with great power comes great responsibility.

[12:22] When you have the ear of thousands of listeners,

[12:25] you have to respect the soapbox you're standing on.

[12:29] Okay, okay, like I don't disagree with that, right?

[12:32] I mean, if you've got a bunch of people listening to what you're saying about pinball,

[12:35] I think you have an obligation to make sure what you're saying is grounded

[12:41] in something responsible to think about the influence you might have

[12:45] when you say stuff.

[12:46] So I agree with him on that.

[12:47] He then goes on to say,

[12:49] In opinion is one thing, trying to destroy companies,

[12:53] hard workers, jobs, friendships, reputations,

[12:56] and so much more is not responsible podcasting.

[13:00] It's internet tabloid terrorism.

[13:03] Also saying things like, can't you take a joke, dude?

[13:07] The answer is no, not when that joke is put out to thousands of people

[13:13] without the chance for that person to defend your comment at that time.

[13:18] All right, let me stop right there.

[13:19] All right, so first and foremost, let me ask one question of everybody out there.

[13:22] I've done this show.

[13:23] I've been doing Canada Spinball podcast now for seven years.

[13:26] I have about 800 podcasts I've put up, 800, right?

[13:30] If you count the ones I've taken down my drunken rants, 800 shows.

[13:35] Okay, in all of those shows, has anybody in the pinball industry lost their job

[13:42] because of something Canada said on Canada Spinball podcast?

[13:45] No.

[13:46] Have any pinball company's reputations been hurt by something I've said on this show?

[13:52] Now, I'm going to answer this truthfully.

[13:54] I think I have said stuff that would diminish the reputation of a pinball company,

[13:59] but I want to say it like this.

[14:01] Anything I've said that will have lowered the reputation of a pinball company

[14:06] was simply me responding to something that company did.

[14:10] So if Jersey Jack Pinball sends out defective playfields,

[14:14] I'm going to say something about it and that might hurt their reputation.

[14:18] If Spooky Pinball sends out playfields where like the inserts aren't cut properly

[14:22] and that diminishes their reputation a little bit, I'm still going to say it.

[14:27] If a pinball company wants to take pre-order dollars like Haggis Pinball

[14:31] and they promise people they're going to have their game in eight weeks

[14:34] and it takes like eight months and I harp on that,

[14:38] I don't care if that diminishes their reputation.

[14:41] I have never, and I mean it when I say this,

[14:43] I have never just out of the blue made up stuff about a company

[14:48] to proactively destroy their reputation, get people fired,

[14:52] or do anything negative for that company.

[14:55] I don't have any power over what these pinball companies do.

[14:59] For the last seven years, ladies and gentlemen,

[15:02] all I've been doing is reporting on what I see them do.

[15:07] On the actions they do, on the games they make,

[15:10] on the prices they charge, on the quality they give us,

[15:14] on the code or lack thereof they give us in games when they launch games.

[15:18] That's all I'm here to do.

[15:20] I am not like sneaking into these companies at night

[15:23] and sabotaging their efforts.

[15:26] And this is the thing is like there are people out there

[15:28] that don't want me to say this stuff.

[15:30] Now can you take one guess

[15:32] why someone would not want a figure like Kaneda

[15:35] to bring up stuff that might not make these games shine in a positive light?

[15:40] Well, maybe because they're making money on every game sold.

[15:44] Or maybe because they've been working on some of these games

[15:47] and they want everyone to celebrate it.

[15:49] But guess what? I got no horse in the race.

[15:51] I'm just observing this hobby like the rest of you.

[15:54] And guess what? I get no kickbacks.

[15:56] I get no discounts. I get no free games.

[15:59] I get nothing.

[16:00] When I want a pinball machine, guess how much money I spend on it?

[16:04] The same amount of money you do.

[16:06] Do you know that there is a very large portion

[16:09] of the pinball content media that get discounts

[16:13] on every single game they buy?

[16:15] And that's fine. That's fine.

[16:17] They have friends in places that can give them those discounts.

[16:20] I don't.

[16:21] And I don't want those discounts.

[16:23] I'm in it with each and every one of you.

[16:25] And I take pride in that.

[16:26] He goes on to say,

[16:27] there are far too many egos in pinball podcasting,

[16:30] too many personal agendas,

[16:32] too many irresponsible comments and critiques,

[16:36] too much sabotaging disguised as parody, humor,

[16:41] or entertainment.

[16:42] Sabotaging.

[16:43] Okay. Let me ask you a question.

[16:44] I've heard what everyone else's pinball content is, right?

[16:47] I've heard enough of Zach and Dennis's show.

[16:49] I've heard Carrie Hardy.

[16:50] I've heard all the major people in the pinball space.

[16:53] I have never, ever heard anyone openly trying to sabotage a company.

[17:00] I've never heard anyone trying to sabotage a company.

[17:03] He goes on the right.

[17:04] The word passion does not come with a credit card to be an ass.

[17:08] A passionate fan is the guy whose home team loses,

[17:12] and he shakes the hand of the guy in the arena

[17:15] wearing the visitor's jersey and says,

[17:18] congrats, maybe next time, enjoy your time in our city.

[17:22] Wow. I don't think French has ever been to a sporting event.

[17:25] I don't think that really happens anywhere, but all right, whatever.

[17:28] He then goes on to say, then there's the guy who dumps beer on that guy

[17:32] in the visitor's jersey.

[17:34] Are you one of those podcasters?

[17:37] There's still time to change.

[17:39] Don't be an ass to those who give reasonable opinions.

[17:43] Talk about your love of pinball and entertain your audience

[17:47] in a truthful, fair and classy way.

[17:49] Cheers to you.

[17:51] I'll continue to listen and support your efforts.

[17:54] Those who use their platform to become a star,

[17:57] people like John Boyd, Keith Elwin, Eric Minier, Steve Ritchie,

[18:01] Jack Danger, Dennis Nordman, Jeremy Packer, Greg Ferris,

[18:04] and so many more, they are the rock stars up on stage

[18:08] in the big arena.

[18:10] You are just the bum selling bootleg T-shirts

[18:13] out front of that arena, mumbling to yourself,

[18:16] I should be the one up on that stage.

[18:19] I should be the one to face it.

[18:21] The only camera you are in front of is your own.

[18:24] Wow, that's how he ends it.

[18:26] I think Franchi forgot that the person who sold the most T-shirts

[18:29] in the pinball podcasting space is Christopher Franchi.

[18:33] And last time I checked, I mean, even if you're a pinball designer,

[18:37] nobody's a rock star.

[18:39] Nobody's making rock star money.

[18:41] And the arenas are not that big.

[18:44] Have you ever been to a pinball show and watched a pinball designer

[18:47] play their game?

[18:49] They're sitting in a half empty room at an embassy suite

[18:52] with usually like 100 people in the room watching them

[18:55] go through a PowerPoint slide that looks like a third grader

[18:58] put it together.

[19:00] Oh snap, Canada, what are you doing?

[19:02] You know, see this is just it.

[19:04] See this is the negativity, this is the toxic hate,

[19:07] this is where it all comes from.

[19:09] And I'm just going to be candid with all of you

[19:11] because you're part of my show right now.

[19:13] I'm going to continue to do what Canada's Pinball Podcast does.

[19:16] I think people are very jealous of this show.

[19:19] I think the reason why they're jealous of this show

[19:21] is I don't have to do a ton of work to connect with a ton of people.

[19:25] And the reason you get there is because you're saying something truthful.

[19:29] And I'm not being a jerk and I'm not being classless

[19:32] and I'm not doing it without dignity.

[19:34] And if I was doing it that way and I was that horrible person

[19:37] they all want you to believe I am, you wouldn't be here.

[19:40] I know that.

[19:42] I know each and every one of you knows that my heart is in the right place.

[19:45] And my content is the most entertaining.

[19:48] And my scoops and my take on pinball,

[19:51] no one else is going to do this for you.

[19:53] No one else.

[19:54] Like there is this little inner circle of people who know everything

[19:58] and they pride themselves on knowing everything

[20:00] and they let their friends know what's going on.

[20:03] They give their friends discounts,

[20:05] but they don't pass that on to you.

[20:08] And you know as long as I'm here in New York City

[20:12] who has no pinball machines in his apartment,

[20:15] every day I wake up, I am in servitude to each and every one of you.

[20:20] And I'm going to work super hard every week

[20:22] to give you the most entertaining show possible.

[20:25] And look, it's not a lot of hard work for me

[20:27] because it comes easy to me.

[20:29] Because I lean into my true personality

[20:32] each and every week with this show.

[20:34] And I love the fact that each and every one of you are here.

[20:37] I love the fact that that 609 number,

[20:40] it's such a bat signal in the sky to everybody else.

[20:43] You know, everyone else is doing this

[20:45] who wants to say this isn't where it's at.

[20:47] Yes, this is where it's at.

[20:49] Like you are where it's at.

[20:50] You're going to get the best pinball podcast throughout 2023 into 2024.

[20:56] You know, we're not going to hold back.

[20:57] I'm going to tell you how I feel about Galactic Tank Force.

[21:00] I'm going to tell you how I feel about its marketing.

[21:02] And look, Iceman and Ferret are not going to be enough

[21:05] to turn that game's sales around.

[21:08] Have you seen this game?

[21:09] Like they really can't get any sales momentum going.

[21:12] But uh-oh, Iceman's buying one.

[21:14] So he's going to tell us every single day.

[21:16] And guess what?

[21:17] Iceman has left Canadian Spinball Podcast

[21:19] because I wasn't saying what he wanted to hear about the game.

[21:22] And that's going to be the way it goes, ladies and gentlemen.

[21:25] I will say stuff at times that might offend you.

[21:28] I will say stuff at times that you don't agree with.

[21:32] I will say stuff about games that you vehemently disagree with.

[21:36] But I hope you know this.

[21:37] I'm going to say it with some thought.

[21:39] I'm going to say it with conviction.

[21:41] And I will always allow you to retort anything I say.

[21:45] I will always allow people to defend their positioning on pinball.

[21:49] That's the way it is.

[21:50] And I have an open door policy.

[21:53] Anybody in the pinball industry who wants to join this show

[21:57] can join at any time.

[21:59] And guess what?

[22:00] My phone is not ringing off the hook.

[22:03] They don't want to join.

[22:05] And that's fine.

[22:06] And I think it works for me.

[22:08] It works for them.

[22:09] And it works for you.

[22:10] I want each and every one of you to give yourselves a pat on the back.

[22:14] We made it to over 600 club members.

[22:18] It's amazing.

[22:19] We didn't have to give away polo shirts.

[22:21] My Discord is free.

[22:24] You can call me anytime you want.

[22:26] Look, if you want to call Canada and you want to do a FaceTime with me,

[22:30] all you have to do is private message me or send me a Gmail

[22:34] or hit me up on Patreon.

[22:36] And we can do a FaceTime chat anytime you want.

[22:39] As long as it works into my schedule.

[22:41] You know it's a good time to talk to me when I'm walking home.

[22:44] I would love to have a personal conversation with any of my fans

[22:48] as I walk home to go get Kylian, open up the apartment door,

[22:52] and listen to Brenda tell me how I didn't clear out the dishwasher.

[22:56] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[22:59] This was just a show where I wanted to reflect

[23:02] on why I think this show is important.

[23:04] And we're going to get right back to talking about what's going on in the industry.

[23:08] But thank you so much for getting us to this milestone.

[23:11] More shows coming this week. Later.
