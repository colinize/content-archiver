[00:00] Yes, we will release more titles in 2019 than any pinball company in history.

[00:04] Name history. Name history. Name history.

[00:11] But we'll also release more than most of the entire industry released in one year.

[00:17] Put a lot of effort without any thought to cost.

[00:20] I think each one of the games now has something never done before in pinball.

[00:32] You need to adjust your playstyle because these shots aren't where you expect them to be.

[00:45] Very shortly. It's not going to be weather or not. It's deep-ritter something else.

[00:48] It's like it's going to be more of a question of why would I not buy a deeper machine with the value in it,

[00:53] but even if I happen to likely just, you know, be in the license from another company.

[01:01] Well, that was eight months ago when we heard that very shortly,

[01:05] we're going to see what the mysteries all about and how are they ever going to make more games in any

[01:11] pinball manufacturer ever in the year 2019 when the year is almost half over. Not going to happen

[01:17] everybody that was eight months ago from deep route. All right. So here's the deal.

[01:22] I don't even I'll talk a little bit about them on episode 348, but what I want to talk about

[01:27] on episode 340 of the Canadian Spinball podcast and the theme of this show is very simply going to be

[01:33] this is it. And what I mean by this is it. I mean like, I think this is it. I think we've seen

[01:39] what we're going to see in terms of pinball's resurgence. Okay. And I don't mean that's like good

[01:44] or bad thing. I mean, I think we're at the top of the mountain. I think we can see all the

[01:50] different things are better going to happen in pinball. And I don't think we're going to be

[01:55] surprised anymore, right? It's like when people climb to the top of Mount Everest, they didn't say,

[02:00] well, what other what other mountain is taller than this that we can now go climb on earth. It's

[02:06] it. We're done. These this is what we're going to see from the pinball companies. This is what we're

[02:10] going to hear from the pinball personalities. This is how many pinball podcasts we're going to have.

[02:15] This is what we're going to get from Chicago gaming and Stern and Jersey Jack and all that.

[02:19] This is it. This is it. And that fatigue is starting to set in. You're seeing it. I'm seeing it on

[02:25] pinside. It's like people don't even know what to talk about much anymore. They're it's almost like

[02:31] they're turning internally and fighting each other over the dumbest stuff. Like if I go into the

[02:36] deep route thread and I see Kim Mitchell and Iceman attacking each other, I'm like, what are you

[02:41] guys even fighting about? You're fighting over a mythological company that hasn't even shown you

[02:46] anything. It's like drain that thread. Oh, let's go into the pirates of the Caribbean thread. Oh,

[02:51] same thing different day. Someone's having some issues with their game. All right, let's go into

[02:55] the monsters thread. Okay, same thing. Everyone saying the game is great. Other people saying the game

[03:00] is shallow. Okay, let's go into the black knight thread. Hey, game is fast. Game is fun. Oh, but I

[03:05] wouldn't really buy one. Okay, there's the black knight thread. Okay, let's go into the woolly

[03:08] walker thread. Okay, Jersey Jack has once again shown a game and he's not going to get it on the

[03:12] line in two months and we're going to be waiting until late summer to get woolly walk. Okay, close

[03:16] that thread out. Okay, let's go into Chicago gaming thread. Okay, where is my monster bash,

[03:20] Ellie? Uh oh, not not shipping yet. Okay, let's go into the freaking home pin thread. Everyone

[03:25] thinks this game sucks. Mine just arrived. The glass was broken. Mike sent me some side rails. The

[03:29] side rails are made like crap. Thank you very much, Mike. Your company sucks. It's going out of

[03:33] business. Okay, where we go now? Okay, let's go over here. Oh, orc is letting everybody know that

[03:37] he's bored of modern pinball companies. He doesn't really care anymore, but he's going to come into

[03:41] the pin sight every day and and and mowing grown about the next thing. So where are we going next? Okay,

[03:46] see, that's what it's like. That's where we're at. We kind of know what to expect from everybody.

[03:53] And I think people are starting to reach a point where they're going to have a realization

[04:00] that you just have to learn how to enjoy this hobby. Maybe a little bit differently. That

[04:05] Gandalf is not going to show up at the top of the mountain as deep root and come storming down

[04:11] and save the day and return pinball to some Valley Williams heyday moment. That's probably not

[04:17] going to happen. All right, that the best chance you're most likely going to get to buy a Valley

[04:23] Williams like machine in 2019 will probably be a here's the thing. It'll probably be this your

[04:29] best chance at enjoying Valley Williams. Guess what you should go by a Valley freaking Williams

[04:35] machine people. There are so many of those great games you love available to go by go by them.

[04:41] You know, people who have a collection of Valley Williams games in good condition. You know what they

[04:46] do? They wake up every day. They play their machines. They're there. There are a big smile on their

[04:52] face. They're super happy. I'll tell you what they're not doing. They're not running the pin

[04:56] side moaning and groaning and complaining about pinball. All right. All the magic that you want

[05:01] is most likely already out. So that's the funny thing about this hobby. And here's the even funnier

[05:07] part. Those games are available for cheaper than the new crap. Okay. I'm going to be honest on this

[05:14] podcast. I'm going to tell you right now for $9,000, you can go get the most mint condition

[05:21] fully restored tales of the Arabian nights, which is one of the most amazing pinball machines.

[05:28] $9,000 gets you that or $9,000 will get you a crappy like I'm saying crappy because it's not worth

[05:36] $9,000. $9,000 will go get you a crappy black knight. Ellie and yet we have people who just

[05:42] completely buy these new games, moaning grown about the magic not being there and yet they can go

[05:48] get the games that have exactly what they're looking for for cheaper. You know, I was laughing because

[05:54] I saw that if this is if this is not an indication of where things are going and this is it in pinball,

[05:59] I sold my Ghostbusters new in box Ellie. I sold it I think for $10,000 or $11,000. There is now a

[06:06] force sale thread on pin side a nice condition Ghostbusters Ellie $6,800 bucks for Ghostbusters.

[06:15] Right? That was one of the most in demand games to turn ever released and it's just an

[06:20] indication of where we're going. All right? Where are we going? Think prices are going down.

[06:25] People are going to start to realize, you know, the wait for new titles to sort of elevate your

[06:31] expectations. I don't know if that's ever going to happen and even watching people's response to

[06:36] Wanka was a great indicator. I don't think most of you guys who are waiting for that like,

[06:43] I don't know like that revolution to happen in pinball. I don't think anything's ever going to

[06:47] satiate you. You know, I'm going to read a little bit maybe what Jerry wrote back to me about P3.

[06:51] I'm going to read a little bit of your emails back to me, but I want to keep going on this train.

[06:55] All right? Here's the thing. Here's the thing. If this is it, if this is the landscape of pinball,

[07:01] as we're going to see it for the next few years, how do you feel about that? Right? Do you really

[07:07] think Stern is going to deliver something that's going to blow your mind? Do you? No. Do you

[07:12] think Stern is going to stay on top? Absolutely. There is nobody who's going to knock them off their

[07:17] number one spot. If you could simply, they're the only company that knows how to launch a game,

[07:21] put it in a box and get you the game in a short period of time. Okay? Jurassic World,

[07:25] Godzilla, Elvira, so what? So what? All right? Is there any Stern news we should break on this

[07:30] pinball podcast? Here's a rumor I'm hearing. Christopher Fransche's, I hear, is no longer

[07:35] with Stern pinball. He's now looking for other alternatives to, you know, to the pinball world.

[07:41] I'm also hearing that he had a cat woman edition of Batman that was ready to go,

[07:47] but I'm also hearing the rumor now. I'm hearing is that Stern shelved it. So you remember I said,

[07:51] wait, don't buy Batman premium? I think they shelved that version of the game so you're not

[07:56] going to see it. Uh oh, can he just pinball? Fuck ass. Said something that I don't know. Should I've

[08:01] said that rumor? Should I've held on to it? Is he going to get a tattoo on his ass because he

[08:05] said that alien would be out by now? Here's a deal. No, I'm not. Okay? That's not what I'm going to do.

[08:11] But here's the thing. Here's the thing. Stern's going to keep doing what Stern does. Okay?

[08:15] And they're going to do it every few months, which means you're going to see a new game from Stern

[08:18] in June, July. Okay? By the time Willy Wonka ships, you're going to probably see another Stern

[08:23] game that you can buy. Now, is it going to be the Stern game you want to have that you can't wait

[08:27] to have? I don't know. I don't know how you guys do it. I don't know how you guys continue to get

[08:32] excited time and time again for these Stern releases. Uh, here's my thing. Can they just give us

[08:38] a bash toy that you actually bash? Is that is that a lot to ask for? We're at this point now.

[08:45] We're every single Stern like toy that you're supposed to be able to bash. They just put a target

[08:51] in front of it and you're not really bashing anything. And, and that's where we're at in Pimball.

[08:56] Is the number one Pimball company can't even let you bash a damn bash toy. Imagine the ballrog

[09:01] swinging out and you don't hit ballrog. He doesn't light up. You just hit a target in front of him.

[09:06] That's what it would be like today. If Stern made Lord of the Rings today, it would suck.

[09:10] It would totally suck. They would never even do the ring mechanism with the magnet. Ballrog would

[09:16] never swing out. He would, he would just be standing there, you know, frozen and there'd be like a

[09:21] magnet in front of him and that would be pretty much it. You know, there wouldn't be that much more

[09:25] going on in the game, right? So the Stern is going to be Stern is going to be Stern. Okay? And it

[09:30] doesn't matter what I say. It doesn't matter what you do. It doesn't matter what anybody does. They

[09:34] are still going to dominate. All right? Then we got Jersey Jack. This is it. Is this it from Jersey Jack?

[09:39] He told us the games would ship in two weeks after he revealed it. He said he wouldn't reveal another

[09:44] game until it was on the line. He was talking about Yellowbrook Road, apparently not about Willy Wonka

[09:49] and every day that goes by for Jack. Every day that goes by, he's losing sales. I would say that

[09:54] every day that goes by that Willy Wonka is not available, he is losing another five to ten sales.

[10:01] Maybe five. Okay? Ten is a lot every day. Maybe every week. Okay? But that's still significant.

[10:06] That's still significant. And every week that goes by that you don't get to own the game,

[10:11] your excitement for owning it will dissipate. It will wane. It will it will start to move towards

[10:18] other things. This is an impulse buy industry. It's crazy that it is, right? That we're impulse buying

[10:24] an eight to ten thousand dollar toys. But that's what their toys. That's all they are. They are

[10:29] toys for men who have expendable cash. And so will Jack get that game on the line in 60 days.

[10:35] And we're going to keep them honest to that. Okay? We've started the countdown clock.

[10:40] All right? I went over there. I want my Willy Wonka. But I don't want my Willy Wonka by Christmas.

[10:46] I want my Willy Wonka by my birthday at least, which is September 25th. Will I get it? I don't know.

[10:51] I don't think so. That's crazy. That is crazy. All right? So what else is going on? What we've got

[10:57] Chicago gaming company, Monster Bash, Elise. Okay. Cool. They're doing their thing. Games are going out.

[11:03] No big news there. Just a remake. Remakes, remakes, remakes of the old classics. That's great. Thank

[11:07] you. Good night. All right? Then we got American pinball. This is it from American pinball. They're

[11:12] working on games three, four and five with the same exact team. So what's going to change? What's

[11:18] going to change? You know what they need to do? They need to hire Brian Allen, the artist who did

[11:22] the alien artwork that Andrew highway shelf. He's looking for a job in pinball. He's an amazing

[11:26] artist. They need to hire him. They should they should they should have hired him six months ago.

[11:32] Think about this six months ago. They showed you October fest and everybody complained about the art.

[11:37] What did they do? They didn't redo the art. What could they have done in six months? Redone the art.

[11:42] So when that game doesn't sell because people don't like the art and that's most likely between

[11:48] the art and the theme. That is the only reason why the game won't sell. The the games got everything

[11:52] else in it. But the theme in the art are just at the point where people won't buy it. They're going

[11:57] to sell less than probably 500 and then everyone's going to blame canada for sinking the pinball industry.

[12:01] So not my fault. Art is easy. I'm going to say that art is the easy part. It is not the hard part.

[12:07] I could find 50 artists today that could do a better art package than that today. And so what? What?

[12:14] Okay. We're just going to go on. All right. Let's keep going. Who's next? Who's next in our P3

[12:19] multi-morphic? Jerry and I we go going back on email. Look, I'm going to read some of your emails

[12:24] about P3 multi-morphic. It is what it is, what it is, what it is. You know, I'm not going to be

[12:28] to dead horse. I'm not going to kick a company when it's down. You know, I don't know what to tell you.

[12:33] I don't know what to tell you. He wrote me an email about how he did market research. I'll read it

[12:37] in a little bit. But obviously someone was lying or someone didn't act on the information properly.

[12:45] And it's just it's not that hard to give people what they want in pinball. It's really not.

[12:50] This isn't like we're putting a man on the moon, Jerry. We're not going to space. We don't have to

[12:54] think about a million different things that could go wrong. You're putting some ramps,

[13:00] some switches, some targets, some art, some lights on a piece of wood. And then you're putting a

[13:08] theme and artwork on top of it. They're not difficult. Pinball has been around for what?

[13:14] Like almost a hundred years. It's not the hardest thing to do. And if you do something that people

[13:20] aren't buying, you've got to change what you're doing. I don't know what else to say about it.

[13:25] All right. Okay. All right. So what else is going on? Spooky pinball. They're going to be fine.

[13:31] Spooky nose. See, spooky is this. Spooky is like, spooky is like the girl that knows she's not that hot.

[13:38] And so she and she understands that she's not going to go in to the party in high school

[13:45] and leave with like the high school quarterback. Can I even say that? I can already hear some of my

[13:50] bleeding heart pinball friends being like, you can't say that anymore. Canator in today's world,

[13:54] that girl should go in and probably leave with another woman and they'd be really happy. And then

[13:58] they'd film a dove commercial and then everyone would have to like be forced fed this crap. Anyway.

[14:03] So, but you know what I'm saying? They know they're not the best of the best. The best.

[14:07] That girl knows she's not leaving with the high school quarterback, but that's okay. She's

[14:11] self-aware and she's biting off as much as she can chew and she's happy in their relationships.

[14:16] She enters into. So to me, that's a little bit like spooky. And I'll say this. Spooky is anything

[14:22] but just like not good looking anymore. I mean, their games look great. Spooky pinball's Alice Cooper

[14:26] and Nightmare Castle looks better. It looks better than October fest. The artwork is better than

[14:32] Willy Wonka. The artwork is better than Black Knight. I mean, that game looks better than most

[14:38] of the newer games that have come out. And I'm not going to like, I'm going to give spooky credit

[14:42] for that. So they're advancing within their own world. And that's good. It's good to see that.

[14:47] Right. So Spooky's going to be fine because again, they're they're they're going to bite off as

[14:50] much as they can chew. All right. So I think Spooky's going to be fine. But then you got like deep

[14:55] root. And I know I made fun of deep root at the beginning of this podcast. And again, the reason

[14:59] why I did it people, the reason why I brought up those sound clips from eight months ago is I'm

[15:04] listening to all these other podcasts and other people talking. And I'm I keep asking myself one

[15:09] question. And I've been guilty of this too. Why have all of us given this company such a pass? It's

[15:15] see, you could look at it like, well, they haven't taken anyone's money. So it's okay. But I'm here

[15:19] to tell you, is it is it okay that us, the pinball media has just let a company come in, say these

[15:27] things, make these bold promises and claims, not deliver on any of them and and just say, well, it's

[15:34] okay because you didn't ask for pre-order dollars. So it's okay. What you say? I mean, that's kind of

[15:38] like Trump saying he's going to build a wall and he's going to do all these terrible things. And

[15:44] but as long as he's not asking you for money, it's okay that he says that. Is that the world you live in?

[15:49] Because it's not the world I live in. So here's why I brought that back up and those sound clips

[15:54] because here's the thing that I think people are missing is that there are people out there. I mean,

[16:00] I don't think these people are the brightest if they're doing this, but there are people out there

[16:03] that are actually not buying new pinball machines because they're waiting to see what deep root

[16:08] is going to deliver. And so hardworking companies that are actually employing people today that have

[16:15] games on the line today that have games going into boxes today, those products might be passed over

[16:22] because everyone thinks deep roots going to blow those games away. And deep roots has shown us

[16:26] nothing but a teaser video and that's it. That's it. But we do know this about them. Everything

[16:33] they've said they were going to do, they have failed to do. They said they were going to make more

[16:38] games in 2019 than anyone in the history of pinball. Okay, January, February, March, April, May,

[16:45] or May, the fifth month, I said six, where the fifth month we're beginning of the year. So the

[16:50] year is almost half over and they haven't shipped one game. They haven't shown us one part. They've

[16:56] shown us a video. They're making more than just pinball. And so the question becomes, okay,

[17:02] so why are we all giving them a pass? Why are we doing this? Why are we just sitting back here

[17:07] and saying like, well, we're not really going to like, you know, say this is kind of BS, but it is

[17:12] kind of BS. And you know, I think it's at the point now where like they don't owe us anything,

[17:17] but what they need to do is stop talking. And I also like, I'm going to hold them accountable

[17:20] for what they said so many months ago. Okay. And what I would like for them to do is just give us

[17:24] a new timeline. Just say like, what's the reality, Robert? Is it June 30th? So June 30th is a date

[17:30] in which most of us think we're going to see Raza. Now, I'm here to ask Robert and the deep

[17:34] group people that listen to this podcast, just tell us is June 30th going to happen? They must know

[17:41] by May 1st if June 30th is a realistic time frame in which we're going to see something or not.

[17:46] And if we're not cool, just reset, reset the schedule. Again, you set the schedule. That's

[17:52] the thing too. It's not me being a jerk waking up being like, let me make fun of this company for

[17:56] saying they're going to ship the most games in 2019. I didn't say that. They did. I didn't say June 30th

[18:02] was the date in which is it where customers were going to get to see Raza. They did. Not only

[18:08] that, the date in which they were going to be delivered, Raza's read the contract, they would get

[18:13] their games by June 30th. There is no way. There is no way that games are shipping the customers by

[18:20] June 30th if nothing has been seen to date. And if there is, then my God, then maybe Hannibal is

[18:28] at the gate of Stern Pimball and Robert Mueller will take down the entire industry. I heard Bill

[18:34] over at Special One, let's say they might be like the Amazon of Pimball. Don't even get me started

[18:41] on like, you know, this is, but again, this is why I said it was smart. We're starting to attribute

[18:46] like greatness to this company when they keep blowing by every single deadline. And I think the Pimball

[18:51] media has a responsibility just to hold these companies a little bit more accountable. Now, we don't

[18:56] need to be jerks. We don't need to slander them. We don't need to like personally insult them.

[19:00] But if you're going to say something and you know, and you're going to put expectations and

[19:04] people's minds about like a date in which you're going to show your game and that date comes and goes

[19:08] like they blew past Texas Pimball Festival, then when is it next? All right. Now, here's my thoughts.

[19:15] And I've said this before, I think they're biting off way more than they can chew. I don't think

[19:20] making this big entertainment company was the smart way to go. And I think there's a lot of people

[19:27] who will, when you're Robert, when you're in Robert's position, you're going to hire a lot of creative

[19:30] people. Now, let me tell you what creative people do. They always convince you it's going to work out

[19:34] that they have the best idea that everything's going to go great. And creative people love getting

[19:38] a salary. They love getting a paycheck. And they love tinkering all day long. But it's not those

[19:44] people that make creations come to fruition. It's the non-sexy people. It's the project managers.

[19:50] It's the engineers. It's the people without the personalities that actually push the creative ideas

[19:56] out into the world and make them real, right? Like someone might have an idea for a roller coaster,

[20:02] but the guy who does the loop the loops might not be the guy who actually has to make sure that people

[20:06] don't die when they get on that roller coaster, right? But this is it, right? You take deep

[20:12] root out of the equation. The fact that there are even in the equation is strange, right? Nothing.

[20:16] You take them out and we know what we know is going to happen. We know guns and roses is next

[20:21] from Jersey Jack. We know Jurassic World. Godzilla, El Vira is coming from Stern Pimble. We don't

[20:28] exactly know what Brian Eddie's game is. We know Christopher French. He might not be on an

[20:32] Eddie art package is moving forward for Stern. We know that Eric is working on guns and roses.

[20:38] Okay? Now look, here's what I hope happens as we go into Pimble into 2019. For me, if I have a wish

[20:46] for each company, let me go down a list. I wish that Stern Pimble would actually make something

[20:50] magical happen in a game and they would let us bash something. Just let me bash something. Even if

[20:55] like there was a mechanism that popped out of the coin door and just bashed me between the legs,

[20:59] I'd be like at least Stern let me bash something that was supposed to be a bash toy. Thank you,

[21:04] Stern. And don't do the same three pop bumpers, two ramps, two orbits, blah, blah, blah, every

[21:10] single game. It's boring. We're tired of it, Stern. We see through it. Everyone is so bored. Your

[21:16] designers must be so bored staring at that low bomb every time they design a game. They must sit

[21:23] in a room and just like I bet like all Stern designers are kind of like Luke Skywalker at the

[21:29] beginning of the last Jedi. Like Gary Stern hands them what the bomb is on the game and they just

[21:34] toss it over their shoulder the way Luke tosses the lightsaber. That's how bored they must be

[21:39] over there at Stern. All right, Jersey Jack, my advice to Jersey Jack, two things. Jack's just

[21:44] got to not show anything until it's on the line. I don't know why that's so hard for him. How easy

[21:49] is that? Like he turns on the lights at J.J.P. and he's like, okay, the game's on the line. So I'm

[21:55] not going to say anything really easy. Like you just really have to use your eyes and your brain

[21:59] to run a pinball company when it comes to marketing. Just do it that way Jack. The other thing is

[22:05] Jack just needs to get his employees synced up. Now the big problem of J.J.P. when it comes to

[22:11] communication and marketing and ideas. Oh, here's the big problem. Jack is in New Jersey and his

[22:16] design people are in Chicago. That is a huge problem for Jack. Huge problem. Jack is a smart guy.

[22:24] Jack's not able to walk into a room and see what's going on. He's just got those guys over there

[22:28] doing what they're doing and he's got those guys over there doing interviews, talking to people

[22:33] and they don't all have the story straight and they're not all on the same page. That's a huge,

[22:38] huge problem. I mean, I work for a company in New York. I have no idea what's going on in a

[22:42] Chicago office ever. Every once in a while we'll do conference calls and Skype calls, but it's not

[22:46] the same being able to walk down the hallway and see the work in progress. I think that's a huge issue.

[22:52] I saw Eric was interviewed on some like, I think it was like loser kid or special kid or like,

[23:00] I don't know. There's like new like something like SHIT head pocket. There's all these like,

[23:05] there's all these new pockets. I think it was loser kid pinball pockets and in it he says,

[23:09] this is what kills me. He says, one of the reasons why he thinks that Willy Wonka will be attractive

[23:16] to operators, right? We'll be attractive is the physical ball lock on the Wonka Vater.

[23:21] All right, that people will walk by the game and see those balls locked up there and they'll say,

[23:26] hey, Johnny, let's play this game and see those balls drop down and that'll be a way in which like,

[23:33] you know, there'll be some like call to action for people who are on location to jump in that game

[23:38] and steal those balls and start that multi ball because you know, nothing gets us riled up on

[23:42] location like seeing a couple balls frozen in midair. Okay, but here's the problem Eric.

[23:47] Is Jack has said time and time again that the Ellie and the Collective's Edition are not really

[23:53] the location games. It's the standard edition that he made for location. So there's less stuff to

[23:58] break down. And here's the other problem Eric. The one thing he yanked out of the standard edition

[24:03] games was the physical ball lock, the Wonka Vater. So that's not even in the game that you are

[24:10] saying is the game that will be an operator's dream come true. Well, see, the reason why this happens

[24:17] is because nobody talks to each other over there. They don't have their story straight at all.

[24:21] They're all just kind of doing their own thing. It's like, look at Willy Wonka. Like, why do you think

[24:27] on every single piece of artwork and part on Willy Wonka? There's a part number like a

[24:33] Valley Williams part number. Jack doesn't probably want that on there. Other people don't want it

[24:37] on there. You don't see it. You don't see it on the Hobbit. You don't see it on Wizard of Oz.

[24:42] You don't see it on any other game other than dialed in. It's because Pat Lawler gets to

[24:46] make up his own mind on this stuff. How ridiculous is that? It says Jersey Jack Pimball on the door.

[24:53] And he can't even tell Pat Lawler not to put ugly, ugly part numbers on the translate art,

[24:59] on the cabinet art, on the top or on the spinners. Those part numbers are on everything. And it's

[25:05] only because like Pat Lawler has more power. It seems than Jack. It's called Jersey Jack, not

[25:12] Jersey Pat Lawler's Pimball. And so I hope that they can sync up more. And I hope they all can get

[25:18] on the same page, right? All right. What other companies I hope for? Spooky. You know, I just hope

[25:23] that spooky like continues to like improve. I hope Scott Denise's game has a ramp. And I can't

[25:30] wait to see it. And that's my hope for spooky. I think Chuck is in a good spot. And I think they're

[25:35] going to do fun. I really do. American Pimball. My hope for them is I just think they need to like,

[25:40] they need to reevaluate like who's on the team. And I think Dovel and Normal when I hear the themes

[25:46] that they're coming out with. And I just like again, like I don't have much faith that these guys

[25:52] understand exactly what people want. We said it on the last show. My hope for them not to get

[25:56] too negative. I hope they get new art or or or approach art differently differently, whether they

[26:02] fire the existing artist or tell him, look bro, like we want a game to look like this. Can you do this?

[26:07] If not, hit the door pal, it's over. You know, let's hire Brian L. and Christopher Franci, right?

[26:13] Sorry guys, a little stuffy nose there. So yeah, that's my wish for American Pimball. But American Pimball,

[26:18] you know, the other thing is they need to just not show games so early. I think that it absolutely

[26:21] crushed October fest, all right? All right. So who else am I missing here? Chicago gaming company?

[26:27] Let's see what their original game is that they're making that's based on an IP. That's what's most

[26:31] exciting to me. They also just need to get their games out sooner. But you know, look, everyone who

[26:35] has a monster bash, Ellie, from what I'm hearing, when you finally get it, people are enjoying their

[26:40] games. And there's not there's nothing wrong with that. I think it is great that we're getting these

[26:43] masterpieces from yesterday years with the availability to buy them all over again, right? And it kind

[26:50] of sucks for the old collectors, but it is what it is, what it is, what it is. You know, they're

[26:54] hedging their bets and the bets are working out. They're selling a lot of these games. All right.

[26:58] Who else? Who am I missing? Am I missing anyone? I feel like I need to pull up Pinside. Oh, man,

[27:05] I was laughing my ass off because like the Pinside lately, the Pinside vibe, the Pinside atmosphere

[27:13] of late is probably I think the worst it's ever been. And moderation is just nonexistent on the site.

[27:21] And what happened? You know, and it's not just about like giving people threatagex and then this

[27:25] and that. Like you don't have to just wait until a fight breaks out in the cafeteria to actually

[27:31] like police your school Robin. I mean, this is the problem with moderators now. They don't even like

[27:37] combine threads that need to be combined. It's like anyone can have just like a random thought

[27:43] and put it up. And now there's like five deep root threads. And now there's this many threads.

[27:47] And then and then they don't do it right. So there's a there should be a troubleshooting thread

[27:51] for pirates of the Caribbean. That shouldn't be the conversation within the club thread. And so

[27:55] there's just a lack of organization. It's almost like someone went into Pinside about a year ago,

[28:00] took all the files out of the filing cabinet and just threw them all up in the air. And that's where

[28:06] we're at nowadays with Pinside. It's just a cluttered mess. And it's no longer fun to like go on and

[28:12] read that much. I kind of avoid it at all costs lately. I'm just going on now to see if I've missed

[28:20] any manufacturers. You're probably yelling it. How do you not even know about these guys? Can

[28:24] it? Okay. So I got Stern. I got Jersey Jack. I got spooky highway pinball. They still around nope.

[28:31] Interesting. Did you see Christopher Franche's making artwork for Queen for some Pinsho?

[28:36] Do you think he's going to or some Comic Con? I think it's for a Comic Con. Do you think he's

[28:40] going to do the Queen artwork for the the pinball brothers game? Interesting. Maybe who knows

[28:46] Chicago Game and We Covered? Dutch pinball doesn't exist. American pinball We Covered. P3 We Covered.

[28:52] All right. So let me read you some of your notes and then I got to get to work because that is

[28:56] what I do. This is episode 348 of Canadian pinball podcasts. And let's hear from our listeners. Oh

[29:03] guys. Thank you so much for listening. You know, I really appreciate all of you. I got an email

[29:08] from Ben Crane. P3 is the title. All right. So Ben says, Chris, heard you read Jerry's letter on P3?

[29:18] It was kind of sad that he seems genuinely bewildered on why his game is in popular. I personally

[29:25] don't care about market research. How much market research went into TNA? People buy games because

[29:31] they are fun. Generic kid themes with poorly drawn art that mean nothing to anyone aren't fun.

[29:38] Watching videos and sorting through complex options before playing a game isn't fun. Games that

[29:44] frequently reboot during gameplay and force to start you over aren't fun. Balls that frequently

[29:51] get stuck aren't fun. Swapping out many play fields isn't fun. Looking for a black ball on a

[29:57] play field that is lit from below isn't fun. Wunky flippers that break on location and cost

[30:03] $750 to replace aren't fun. Moving 400 pound games isn't fun. Losing money trying to sell a game

[30:10] on the secondary market, no one wants isn't fun. Developing your own game for a platform no one

[30:16] else has isn't fun. Oh damn, Ben, you really shot. You really shot that one right in the middle of

[30:24] the heart. How do you really feel about P3? Well look Ben, I agree that on some level you have to

[30:31] sort of ask yourself when you're doing anything in Pimble. Are people going to enjoy this? Is this

[30:36] what people want? And if it's not fun, maybe we should rethink it. You know, you brought

[30:40] something interesting too. It's like I really think the main reason why Pirates of the Caribbean

[30:45] failed to like connect with people is that opening menu screen. I really do. I think Pirates of

[30:52] the Caribbean lost more people just having to pick through 22 characters was probably the worst

[30:59] design decision ever in a Pimble game. It's not fun to do and I still don't care what anybody says.

[31:05] That's not how you start. That's not how you start a Pimble game. It's never how you should start

[31:11] a Pimble game and yet the whole game went that way. And then they didn't even use like the clips

[31:15] they could have used from the movie that they did have access to because they buried you in this

[31:19] like weird kind of code and that wasn't fun. And that's why the game didn't sell because the shots

[31:24] are fun. The next are fun. The art is fine. The sound is amazing. The callouts are fun. So what's

[31:31] not fun about that game? The complexity of it, right? All right. I got an email from Joseph and he

[31:37] said the subject is oric Lawson. The king of all design L-O-L-O-L-O-L. That line had me cracking

[31:46] up dude. Thanks. Look man, oric is a passionate dude. He does this thing. You know, I think he's just

[31:53] beyond the point of like he doesn't even want to be there anymore. Like you can see it on Pinside.

[31:59] Like he's back to the old oric which is just let me find something that I'm not happy about. And

[32:05] then he always like he's a little bipolar in the sense and we all are. Let's be honest. Any of us

[32:09] that are hyper into Pimble on the forums are bipolar at times. But then he goes from like,

[32:14] yeah man, I'm bored. This all sucks. Like nothing excites me. Then he'll watch two people fighting

[32:18] and be like, guys, come on. It's just Pimble, right? He kind of plays both roles of like mediator

[32:24] and just like completely bored to his mind with Pimble. All right. Let's see. Okay. Arcade mode.

[32:30] I got an email from Daniel. Daniel Florence says, hey, canada, I think you are right. And Pimble is

[32:36] stuck like in the early years of home councils where they just copied arcade games. They didn't

[32:42] know any better. But then games evolve. This company's realized they don't have to make you lose a

[32:47] game after five minutes and let you start all over again. Your idea of a home mode is just great.

[32:53] You could choose between a classic arcade mode where you attack high scores in different modes

[32:58] with three balls. But then you could have an adventure mode when you have to complete missions to

[33:02] progress through a story. If you manage to complete a mission through various stages your game

[33:07] starts again at that point like a level you've beaten. You could have side missions that help you

[33:12] throughout the adventure. They get held like a fourth ball or bonus X or stuff that makes some

[33:18] stages easier to progress. I think that would be awesome. Greetings. Daniel Vaughan, Den Bergen.

[33:24] Well, Daniel, thank you for the note. I think it would be cool. I hope we see it. I'm not sure,

[33:28] though. It still feels like everyone's making one game to fit out on location and to fit in your home.

[33:34] And to me that's silly. It really is silly. It's like design a car for the track or design a

[33:38] car for the street. Some do both, but I think most pinball games are now ending up in homes and I

[33:44] think people aren't approaching it like that. All right. Let's see. Do do do do do do get an email from

[33:49] Neil. Okay. Neil and I are talking about something else on the side that I will talk about at some

[33:54] later point. All right. Jerry. Jerry. I'm going to read your note. I'm going to read your note. He

[33:59] says hi, Chris. Thanks for addressing a few bits from the email. This is Jerry Stellenberg, ladies and

[34:04] gentlemen, P3. I agree with most of your responses, but I think you missed the main point. I am not

[34:09] blind to why people aren't flocking to the P3. Wasn't really asking for why people don't care about

[34:14] the innovations in our platform was more asking why you and others seem genuinely excited about

[34:22] deep root claiming many of the same things. The answer is, of course, money and the facilities and

[34:28] staff money affords and people in this pinball community for some reason get super influenced by

[34:34] hype and promises of great things. Ironically, if I had 40 professional animators, including a team

[34:42] of people from Disney, I'd be embarrassed about that. Raza teaser video. Well, let me stop you first

[34:48] there, Jerry. Look, I do agree. I do agree wholeheartedly. You see how it is, man. People are like,

[34:55] people are thinking deep root is like the next greatest thing in pinball and they've shown nothing.

[34:59] And also the part that people don't understand. These aren't like Disney's greatest animators have left

[35:05] Walt Disney, have left Pixar and have decided to join a Robert Mueller over at deep root.

[35:12] Okay, no, you've got Quinn over there worked at I think Disney studios like working on like

[35:18] game level design or storytelling in video games and stuff like that. These aren't, you know,

[35:24] Disney is a huge company that employs tens of thousands if not like a few hundred thousand people.

[35:30] This is not like, you know, the greatest of the greatest have migrated over the deep root. So I

[35:35] think that's a big misconception people have. I think they're seeing where some of these people

[35:40] applied their efforts to in the past. But anyone who works in a creative industry like this,

[35:44] like in gaming or animations or like, you know, design, they work on a plethora of stuff over the

[35:51] years and it doesn't mean that, you know, you're going to see like Disney quality. Anyway, so Jerry

[35:56] goes on to say two things. You and others bring up the point why bother with these innovations.

[36:02] Just make a traditional game with a good theme and sell lots of them. My answer is simple.

[36:08] I have no interest in doing similar things to everybody else. If we fail because we don't

[36:14] successfully bridge the gap between innovation and desirable theme and visual immersion,

[36:20] we're working on it though and without the millions that DR has or because we suck at marketing and

[36:25] can't afford to hire somebody good at it, then I'll move on to something else. The reason

[36:30] multi-morphic doesn't follow Stern's formula for how to develop and sell pinball machines is because

[36:36] I would be bored to tears at work every day and would have no passion for the product. If I believe

[36:42] that's the only way to be successful in the industry, I don't, I'd leave the industry. All right,

[36:48] so Jerry, let me stop you there in the first point. Look, man, I applaud you for that. Okay,

[36:53] I applaud you for having a vision, having a dream, sticking with it and not wanting to just make

[36:58] what everybody else makes. You know, I think the life gets boring, life gets stale, life gets uninteresting

[37:06] when you just follow the path of everyone else. That being said, that being said, you're still running

[37:12] a business. You still need to make money. You still need to sell something people want. And

[37:18] you can't tell me that it's more fun to be a dreamer who's struggling to make ends meet than it is

[37:25] to be a dreamer whose dream is giving people what they want and is super successful financially.

[37:30] In my life, I've met people that run the spectrum. I have friends who have no money. I have friends

[37:36] that are my age at live-in-home with their parents. I have friends that have a billion dollars.

[37:41] All walks of life. I'll say this. The happiest people, they have their money in order, they make

[37:47] profit. That opens up the door for them to live the life of their dreams. Now, it doesn't mean

[37:53] they're happy. I also know people that have money that are depressed. They inherit millions of

[37:57] dollars from their parents and they're on antidepressants and they see shrinks every day. No. But,

[38:02] Jerry, you're a dreamer. You want to make the best pinball machine. You want to make the pinball

[38:05] machine that you want to make. But, Jerry, there has to be a point. And you should come on the show.

[38:09] Let's have this discussion. I know I'm reading these emails. But, there has to be a point in which,

[38:14] at what point do you have to call an audible? Seven years, if it's not working, then what?

[38:19] And you know what I'm saying? Do you keep building on top of the house if the foundation of the house

[38:24] isn't sound? And that's what I think is happening. If the foundation isn't sound, man,

[38:30] you're just going to keep building on top of it and it's still going to collapse if the foundation

[38:34] isn't what people want. He goes on to say, number two, focus groups. I did put together a focus

[38:40] group. When starting the company, it's literally the oldest thread in the multi-morphic channel.

[38:44] We put together a group of 20 to 30 people with diverse backgrounds and interests, some from

[38:49] pinside and some from outside the collector market. We get a lot of good discussions.

[38:55] With me two products, a focus group makes perfect sense. Hey, we're making your traditional pinball

[39:00] game with the following three themes. Would you like, which of the following three themes would

[39:04] you like best? When talking about new ideas and new technologies, they're harder to rely on

[39:10] because they can't always grasp the final product from a description of technologies.

[39:15] New people still come up to me at every pinball show and say, wow, I read about this online and

[39:22] didn't think it'd be fun, but it's actually a blast. People always refer back to what they know.

[39:28] And as I mentioned above, developing traditional style pinball has no appeal to me.

[39:34] I've worked at companies who made innovation paradigm shifting products before and getting

[39:38] customers to adopt it almost always a challenge. But once they get over the hump, it was hockey stick

[39:44] growth. We will get over the hump. Will we get over the hump? Hard to say, probably not without help,

[39:49] but I'm still enjoying what I do. And we continue trying to improve the quality and reliability of our

[39:55] product. Well, look, Jerry, I mean, I get what you're saying. It makes total sense, right? It's

[40:00] like it's easy to be like, Hey, do you want Star Wars Ghostbusters or like Jurassic World? Which

[40:05] one would you buy if it was coming from Stern? And then you don't have to like, you don't really

[40:09] have to think about in innovation there. You just have to think about, do I love this movie and

[40:13] when I want this movie in pinball form as Stern gives us pinball machines? Look, Jerry, I'm not going

[40:19] to like, I just think you're doing what you're doing. And I would say this, you're a very smart guy.

[40:25] And you've created a lot of innovation in your platform of pinball, right? And so if you want to

[40:32] keep doing it and you want to keep doing it, but you think, here's the thing. If you think you're

[40:36] that hump, I don't know how big the hump is for you. And that's why I feel bad because I'm like,

[40:41] I see all these other people doing half as much as you selling so much more. So ultimately, though,

[40:47] if you say that you don't want to, you don't want to develop a traditional pinball machine,

[40:51] my advice to you is this, you don't have to develop a traditional pinball machine. You don't,

[40:57] but you didn't, you didn't develop, you didn't develop a traditional pinball machine,

[41:01] but you develop something that is even way beyond a traditional pinball machine. And so maybe you

[41:07] leaped too far, too soon. So for example, General Motors designed an electric car 25 years ago.

[41:17] And yes, it was, it was like where the future was going, but they couldn't sell them 25 years ago,

[41:23] 30 years ago. Maybe it was even longer than that, right? Only because the infrastructure wasn't there.

[41:28] The ability for people to like want to do that stuff wasn't there, want to drive electric cars

[41:32] wasn't there. People didn't see the vision back then. And so right now, here's my, here's my

[41:38] advice, though, Jerry, you are making a pinball machine during this period in which pinball is having

[41:43] a resurgence, right? There is all this money to be made. And you're almost saying like, I don't

[41:49] care about the money, I don't care about, I just care about my innovation, but you've got to find

[41:55] the balance or it won't work. And I would hate to see someone like you who's trying to push the envelope,

[42:01] push too far. And that is my advice, man. I think you've got a lot of great innovations. I think I

[42:07] would rethink it. Why does it always have to be this way? Why does, is P3, if P3 is just stuck as

[42:13] being P3 with the big screen and the swappable things, no one's going to develop for the system,

[42:18] man. You keep saying people will develop for no one's going to develop and take the time to

[42:22] develop games where there's only 50 to 100 of your platform in homes. If there was 10,000 of them

[42:28] in homes, that would be a different story. But how are you going to get to 10,000 sales with a 10,000

[42:33] hour product with a theme people are not really into? And this is all marketing, Jerry. It's all

[42:38] marketing. And it's like, you know, so the focus group wasn't really, it doesn't seem like it was

[42:44] very like valuable. But I think you're trying to make something that, you know, you're kind of

[42:50] playing the most risky bet in life that I'm going to make something that I think people don't even

[42:55] know they want. Yes, when you get that right, you might become Apple. But when you get it wrong,

[43:01] we, you know, there's a little far longer list of those companies that got it wrong. But anyway,

[43:04] Jerry, I think keep doing what you're doing, man, keep doing what you're doing. I think only you

[43:08] can decide, you know, when it's time to make the changes or call an audible. And it's in your hands.

[43:14] But you know how I feel? I feel like you might have leaped too far and people can't meet you there.

[43:19] You got to meet these customers halfway. And I think that's what you need to do. All right,

[43:23] I got to get to work. This has been episode 348. This is it in Pimble. These are the companies.

[43:28] This is what's going to happen. These are the Pimble podcast. You know, we're not, this is going to

[43:32] be Canadian Pimble podcast. We're going to get some guests on. I'm glad you guys listen to the show.

[43:35] I hope you guys enjoy the show. If you want to email me at canadapimble.gmail.com. That is great.

[43:41] Brendan and I are going to be working on some merchandise for you guys. So you can actually wear

[43:45] with pride that you listen to Canadian Pimble podcast. As always, we will never hold back. We will never

[43:50] hold punches. I just want to tell you guys like it is like the way this hobby is. I do think over

[43:56] the next month, everyone do me a favor. Just calm down. May is going to suck. May is going to be

[44:01] a crappy Pimble month for people that are hyper into like wanting to know what's next. You're not

[44:06] going to see much. You're not going to see much. You're going to wait for Wonka. Black nights,

[44:10] all you're going to get from Stern. You're not going to see the next Stern. I just think May is

[44:14] a period where maybe we all should take a vacation. I could even see it with like the other Pimble

[44:17] podcast and then the conversation on Pinside. It's all starting to implode like people don't have

[44:22] much to say. And when that happens, they're going to try to, you know, people have to like,

[44:26] manufacture stuff. Now for those of us that can manufacture entertainment, I mean, I could,
