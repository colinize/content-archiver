[00:22] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada Spinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada.

[00:26] I'm so happy right now to be in front of this microphone. If you knew how hard it is to juggle being a new dad with a full-time job in a one-bedroom apartment when I can't go into the office each day, just mentally, it's been really tough.

[00:41] And this is one of my favorite moments of the week, talking about pinball with all of you. And it's especially so rewarding as I look right now.

[00:50] The number keeps growing. A week ago, we were at 323 club members. Now we're at 362. And I think more and more people are realizing the old show's not getting turned back on.

[01:03] This is it, but this is the same great show you've loved all these years. What do I want to talk about in the pinball world this week?

[01:10] Well, there's not a ton going on other than Rush Pinball, other than is Haggis Pinball going to get fathoms on the line? And then let's do this. Let me talk to you about real quick what I'm doing with Ultraman and my fears around trying to sell that game right now.

[01:27] And I also want to go and fill out with all of you my 2021 Twippy ballot. We're going to go through all the categories and I'm going to tell you what my votes were. And I think I'm going to be pretty aligned with all of you on what we're putting into the Twippy ballots.

[01:43] So let's start with Rush real quick. So the stream happened. I think everyone was really happy with what they saw. I think Rush fans are super excited about this game. I talked to Ed Robertson about the call outs and he said to me, Chris, there are 800 call outs that are going into this game, many of which have not been implemented yet.

[02:06] So as you know, one of my gripes was the call outs and the lack of amazing call outs in the game. And I think we're going to see a lot more in that department put into the game itself. I also do think Rush has a quirky sense of humor. It's not going to be for everybody.

[02:21] But those Rush fans out there apparently they understand it and this is funny to them. It might not be funny to me, but I'm just satisfied that Rush fans are satisfied. But I also think in just a few weeks, everyone else in the pinball world that doesn't love Rush is going to get really bored and really antsy because there's nothing else for months now.

[02:43] Think about it. What is happening in pinball in January and February? What? We're not going to get Cactus Canyon remake on the line. That doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon. Spooky games are doing what you know they're doing. They're doing absolutely nothing. They're creating no excitement in the pinball world right now.

[02:59] Jersey Jack Pinball is once again sitting idly, probably waiting to TPF to show Toy Story. There's nothing exciting going on. American pinball is a legends of Vahala. I guess they're making some of them. I don't see many unboxings. But that game's not lighting the pinball world on fire.

[03:17] And I thought about this when I was going through the Twippy Ballads. Even when you look at 2021, imagine if there was no Godzilla. There's really not that much exciting stuff that happens in a fiscal year in the pinball world.

[03:31] And most of the excitement, most of the entertainment comes from the community because the companies themselves just don't do very much. There's just not a lot of wow. Oh my God. Did you see this game? Did you see what they did? I can't believe they put that world under glass in a pinball machine.

[03:51] You don't feel that when you see legends of Vahala. You're not feeling that when you see like Ultraman and Halloween, right? And so what we want more of and what we need more of, we need more magic. I'm going to be honest. I still feel like for all of the energy and all of the effort that goes into these pinball machines, why aren't we being blown away like we were in the mid 90s?

[04:16] It's like Baldy Williams game after game after game was this incredible physical world under glass, right? And here we are in the hottest pinball market ever. This is the hottest pinball has maybe ever been because believe me, if Stern pinball can make 20,000 games of a hit title, they would probably sell it in one year.

[04:37] They can't make that many though. So in the hottest pinball market, you look at the titles, you look at the games, you look at what's available right now and you're kind of like, well, what's next? And we're always sort of waiting to see what's around the corner.

[04:52] Now, speaking of what's next, we're now in mid January and do we think Hages pinball is going to get Fathom on the line in January as they promised? I keep going into the thread expecting to see pictures of Fathom pinball parts. I've been asking for that for two months now.

[05:11] The only thing being discussed in the thread right now is whether or not people got their Hages Christmas ornament or some email that got sent out. And that's the only thing people are talking about. We're not seeing people on the line. We're not seeing parts come in.

[05:28] You think Damien would be showing everybody who's in on these games parts as they're arriving at the factory. But once again, you guys are on board for this ride in a non refundable way. My friend Kelly Daniel hit them up and asked for a refund.

[05:45] Okay, send an email to Hages asking for a refund because it's been seven or eight months since he gave his deposit and the games are still not on the line. Now, what happened to him when he sent an email asking for a refund? I'll tell you what happened.

[06:00] They didn't even respond to him. They didn't get back to him. At least get back to him and say there are no refunds, but it was radio silence. And this is where I again start to get a little nervous. We've seen this before. When a company wants your money, they over communicate. They're super nice. They're super jovial.

[06:18] But when a boutique company is asked for a refund, they often do this. They ignore you. It's radio silent. We saw it at Dutch. We saw it at highway. We've seen it over and over again. I hope this company does not repeat history. I hope they don't become another boutique that just miscalculate it.

[06:37] How hard it is to actually make pinball machines. I for the life of me do not understand why more of these small companies don't just unite. Why doesn't Hages American Pinball and let's say Spooky Pinball just get together, make one company share some of your knowledge and your resources. You can still have manufacturing taking place in different areas, but at least you could share your resources and your talent.

[07:04] I just want more. Can you tell on board I just want more games. I want more competition for Stern. I want there to be more magical worlds under glass during the hottest pinball market ever. Is that too much of a dream of Canada's?

[07:19] Alright, so when will we see Cactus Canyon remake? That's another thread where it's just like there's nothing to talk about and there's no communication. How do you guys feel good about this? These companies, they come out and they get your money.

[07:34] And what these companies know is that you enjoy seeing how the sausage is made. And why is there almost absolutely zero communication between company and customer with companies like CGC? I just don't understand why you guys enjoy this. Like how is this enjoyable for anybody? I get that everyone is confident you'll get a great Cactus Canyon one day you will, but it'd be nice to just get a damn update from these companies once a month.

[08:00] It's not even like we're asking for it every week. Just once a month. What is going on with this company with the order I placed with you? I don't want a Christmas ornament. I want an update on the game.

[08:14] Alright, now speaking of updates on games, I've reached a point where I'm looking at what's coming out in 2022. I know a little bit more than all of you. I know the realities of my life and the kinds of machines I want to put in my game room. And I've had a change of heart. I no longer am going to run after everything.

[08:33] I no longer am going to let FOMO and fear of missing out guide my pinball purchases. When I bought Ultraman, I had a little bit of FOMO. Maybe a lot of FOMO. And I just wanted to support Spooky. I just wanted to be in on something. It's like for some reason it's just fun when a new game comes out to feel like you can get one. And that's what I did. And I committed to buying number 500 of Ultraman. It's going to have a butter cabinet and it's not going to be made for a while.

[09:02] So I was good about that because I was waiting for a house. I was giving them time to finish this game, polish it to the point where they feel good about it. And now I'm looking at it and I'm seeing all of these Ultramans up for sale and early numbers up for sale. And people are losing about $1,000 on each deposit of Ultraman. And here's the scary part. They're not even selling them at $1,000 loss.

[09:28] And I'm a marketer and I'm looking at the marketplace right now. And in the hottest pinball market I've seen in the past 10 years, in which Stern can't keep any inventory in stock, in which people are spending 30 to 100% increase on price on old Stern titles, here we have Spooky's latest game and people don't want it.

[09:52] Why is that? And some of these are games that are done, they're built, they're in boxes, they can go out next week, they can be put on a truck immediately and people still don't want these games. So now I'm sort of unsure what I do. Do I lose money and just take whatever offers on the table?

[10:10] I don't think I'm going to do that. There's no point in doing that. Like if I'm going to lose $1,000, I'm going to lose $1,000 a year from now, I might as well just stick it out. Because there might be a scenario in which Spooky actually makes these games much better.

[10:26] They need to be made much better. That is the thing that everyone is realizing, is that these games aren't where they need it to be. And if you look at everything that's in Rush on day one, everything that was in Godzilla on day one, everything that was in Mandalorian on day one, in Guns N' Roses on day one, in Cactus Canyon on day one, Spooky Pinball misread the entire community.

[10:53] Nobody wants this anymore. Nobody wants to be locked in with a non-refundable deposit and then you launch a game that is this incomplete. But that's not really the biggest issue. The biggest issue with these two games is this company is not capable of making two games at the same time.

[11:13] They're not. They bit off way more than they could chew. This strategy of using the same play field for two different themes and asking their coding team to work on two games simultaneously while making each game independent and feel like it has its own personality.

[11:31] It's not working. It hasn't worked out. This isn't how you make pinball machines. If this was the way to do it, we would see other companies do it this way. I think they tried to bite off more than they could chew.

[11:44] And building both of these games like this with the same layout, the same rule sets, but just changing the rule sets to reflect what's in each property, these are two radically different properties. You can't make them together at the same time. It just doesn't work.

[12:01] And for me, even though Ultraman is the rarer of the two with only 500, the big issue is this. There clearly aren't 500 fanatical Ultraman fans that really want this game. There are millions and millions and millions of Rick and Morty fans in America.

[12:19] I don't think there are millions of Ultraman fans in America who cross over with pinball. And that's the problem is this isn't a dream theme for most people in the pinball industry. It's a dream theme for Chuck. And I think Chuck is making too many Ultramans.

[12:35] I think a title that is this obscure for the pinball audience should have been 200 to 250 at most. And that's the other thing that's working against me is even though Halloween has 750 more games, there's 75 times more people in the pinball world that are into Halloween and horror movies.

[12:55] And that is why if you go on pinside right now, look at the games for sale. It's a lot more Ultraman spots up for grabs and Halloween. So I got on this train. I have nobody to blame but myself, but I learned a lesson. I'm never doing this again.

[13:12] I am never going in on a non refundable game before I see it before I play it before I know it's what I want. I ran towards the FOMO and I got burns people. I got burns. All right, let's switch gears. It's Twippy season everybody. It's the 2021 Twippies which takes place at the end of March.

[13:34] By the time the award show happens, you will have forgotten everything that happened in 2021. I always feel like this award shows a little too late, but it's still the de facto award show in all of pinball.

[13:48] So I'm going to go through each category and I'm going to tell you what I voted for. Now I will say this. This was the boringest Twippy ballot ever and you're going to see why.

[13:58] I think almost every single win is going to go towards stern pinball in every category where there is a stern pinball game and you know which game is going to take almost everything. Boring year, boring selection of games if you ask me. I think Godzilla just clobbers everything, but let's do it.

[14:15] Now just as I said that the first category is best theme. Now for me, best theme isn't actually a vote for the best game. It's just what's the most popular theme that was made into a pinball machine this year and I'm not going to go down the entire list.

[14:31] My pick is Mandalorian. Absolutely. This is the best theme that was made into a pinball machine this year. Do I think it was the best theme integration? Absolutely not.

[14:41] Alright best animations and display and by the way, let me just read this list and this is why it was such an underwhelming year for pinball. Alright, look at all the titles up for these categories.

[14:52] Sorcerers Apprentice by Multimorphic, Kelts by Haggis, Led Zeppelin by Stern, Mandalorian by Stern, Legends of the Hala by American Pinball, Shoot and Scoot by Multimorphic, Halloween by Spooky, Silver Falls by Nick Baldridge, Godzilla by Stern and Ultraman by Spooky.

[15:14] Okay, what a bad list if you ask me for this is all that pinball could do in an entire calendar year. This is it. This is it and glaringly missing from all of this is Jersey Jack Pinball.

[15:30] Jersey Jack Pinball is the reason why so many of us are like snoozing during this awards show. If I'm Jersey Jack, every year they should have a new game. They should have something new. Just in one full year, something new to get excited about.

[15:45] And without Jersey Jack, I mean this, without Jersey Jack Pinball in the Twippies, it's a lot more boring because you and I both know they're the only company that can really give Stern a run for the money.

[15:58] And it's only fun when you have an award show where there's actually competition to see who's going to win. It's really boring when one company runs away with all of it.

[16:09] Because we both know like Spooky's probably not winning anything. Multimorphic's not winning anything. And it's only between Stern and Stern. I don't think anybody else on this entire list other than a Stern game is going to take a single award.

[16:25] And let me show you why. So best animations in display, I have to give it to Godzilla. I think Godzilla's going to win that. Best light show.

[16:34] Now this one was hard for me because I don't think any of these games have a great light show. I really don't. And I think after Guns N' Roses winning Best Light Show, you look at all of these games and what would you say has the best light show?

[16:48] It's going to be between Godzilla and Mandalorian. It'll be between those two. And having played both games, it's weird, right? They're both like typical Stern light shows. Nothing blows you away.

[17:00] I am going to say that I do think the light show in Mandalorian is actually better than the light show in Godzilla. So I put Mandalorian down. But I wouldn't be surprised if Godzilla wins in that category.

[17:12] But again, neither of them are amazing. Best toys and gimmicks in a game. Without a doubt, it's going to go to Godzilla. Best theme integration.

[17:23] See, this to me is always the most important category of the award show. How well did you integrate the theme? Everybody who loves pinball dreams that a theme that they love is integrated the right way.

[17:39] And the game that's going to win by like 75% of the votes is going to be Godzilla. Like Godzilla is amazing. Mandalorian should have won this. But for some reason Mandalorian has like zero magic from the show in physical pinball format.

[17:56] I will never forgive Stern pinball for taking my Star Wars dreams and flushing them down the toilet with games that can't integrate the magic of the property into pinball. Like how do we still not have the use of magnets and force grabbing the ball in a way that makes you go, wow, that's magical?

[18:17] Like what a lazy, lazy game Mandalorian is when I look at the integration of that theme into it. Best music and sound effects in a pinball machine. Now this one's a little bit interesting, right? Because you've got the Mandalorian music from the show which everybody loves.

[18:33] And then you've got Godzilla. I don't think anyone else is even going to come close. Led Zeppelin is horrible even though it's Led Zeppelin music. I think best music and sound effects is going to go to Godzilla. And also, I should have said this at the beginning, Godzilla has the most fans because it's an Elwynn pin.

[18:50] I just don't think Mando has enough of a fan base to beat out Godzilla in almost any one of these categories. So I give best music and sound effects to Godzilla. Best call outs in a pinball machine is once again going to go to Godzilla. Best rules in a pinball machine.

[19:06] Woo, had the best rulesets. Well, we know this one is also going to go to Godzilla. Can you tell now why this is going to be a pretty boring award show? They might as well just say, hey, Godzilla won the following eight Twippies.

[19:22] Best play field gameplay and layout. Godzilla. Best artwork is going to go to Zombie Eddie. Godzilla. Game of the Year is going to be Godzilla. They might as well call this the Godzilla award show and just a few things for Mandalorian.

[19:38] And because Godzilla is going to sweep almost every category, it means the only exciting categories are going to be the ones that are not game related, right? So then we go to favorite pinball streamer.

[19:51] I voted for myself, which is Canada's Facebook Live, but I do think Jack Danger will take it again. But my goal, if you haven't voted yet in the Twippies, my goal is to make it into the top three of this category because I think if Canada's Facebook Live can make it into the top three and throughout the entire year, all we did was talk about pinball.

[20:12] We never played pinball. I think I played pinball twice at Jack Bar and that was it.

[20:16] Alright, everyone's favorite category, favorite pinball podcast. Will we go five for five? Well, we might, but we're going to need your help. So if you haven't voted yet in the Twippies, please vote for Canada's pinball podcast.

[20:28] And if you get someone else in your family or a friend or the milkman to vote, that will help as well because it's just a tallying up of all the votes.

[20:36] Now last year, we won by three times the amount of votes. So I don't think we're going to need too much help, but again, every vote counts.

[20:44] For me, the hardest one is the favorite pinball YouTube channel because I love so many of these. TNT, you got Carrie Hardy flipping out straight down the middle, Marv Loco.

[20:55] And this is one where I definitely, I definitely am filling out my top three because I can't just pick one. So on my top three, I definitely have straight down the middle.

[21:07] I have TNT and I have Carrie Hardy. I mean, those are my three favorites. Alright, so favorite pinball mod of 2021. I'm not going to read you everyone.

[21:16] There's one on here that I voted for and I voted for this one because I just want to see him win it. And I want to see Disney's lawyers contact him with a cease and desist letter because I think it would be so fun.

[21:30] But Joe Abadi is one of the greatest people in the pinball hobby and his animated Grogu mod actually is so needed for this game because it has zero magic under glass.

[21:42] And so if you haven't voted or don't know who to vote for, that is who I would vote for the Mandalorian pinball animated interactive Grogu.

[21:50] And what's funny about this is that it doesn't say it's from Joe Abadi. I think he's trying to prevent himself from the lawsuit that is going to come on your shores, Joe.

[21:59] This is the weirdest one. Favorite pinball accessory of 2021. We've got Invisiglass by JJP. How is that a new accessory?

[22:07] Pinwoofer, Scorbit, Mandalorian Shooter Rod, Avengers Shooter Rod, Guns and Roses, Art Blades. They need to get rid of this category.

[22:18] I'm sorry. And then you've got Insider Connected Kits, which actually is the greatest pinball accessory of 2021.

[22:25] So that's what I put, but it's really weird because the way it's listed here, it doesn't say Stern Insider Connected, which it should have said, which is the biggest pinball accessory that Stern has ever done, connecting its machines via the internet.

[22:42] So I don't know how you vote for anything other than that. Sorry, Jersey Jack, but Invisiglass didn't get my vote.

[22:48] Favorite pinball website will go to Pinside. Favorite pinball location. I put Jack Barr in Brooklyn because I want to see John Winnett.

[22:55] Favorite pinball convention. This is probably the most controversial one because they left TPF out of the voting because there was not a TPF last year.

[23:06] I think that was a huge mistake because you could still have a favorite show even if it doesn't happen every year.

[23:14] And I think the fact that the award show is going to be at TPF and you didn't put them into this drop down category is a humongous mistake.

[23:25] It would have been such a nice thank you to Ed and Kim and everyone involved in TPF if they could have won this without even having had a show over the last couple of years.

[23:36] Because what a testament to the fact that it is the best pinball show in the world.

[23:42] And even though we had to miss it because of COVID, everybody still considers it the best pinball show in the world.

[23:50] Jeff and Kim, I don't know what you guys are drinking over there, but wake up.

[23:55] Wake up. The optics of leaving TPF off of this is absolutely asinine.

[24:01] And so now I have to vote for something else.

[24:04] And so I put Chicago Pinball Expo because I went to it and it was fun.

[24:09] It's nowhere near as good as TPF, but I couldn't vote for TPF.

[24:12] Alright, then we get to probably my least favorite category.

[24:17] Favorite competitive player.

[24:19] I always put Keith Elwin.

[24:21] Keith, I hope you win that.

[24:22] Favorite tournament.

[24:24] I don't really know.

[24:25] I don't play in pinball tournaments.

[24:26] So this is a category you could either leave blank.

[24:28] I voted for X-Men Charity Tournament because I just like the X-Men.

[24:32] Favorite mobile app.

[24:34] I voted for Scorbit and Pinquest in this one.

[24:37] I put both of them down just because I'm friends with both of them and I wanted to see both of them.

[24:41] Recognized.

[24:42] Favorite pinball topper of 2021.

[24:45] Oh yeah, the most important category.

[24:47] Favorite pinball topper.

[24:49] This is one where I'm like, oh man, so you've got Ultraman.

[24:52] Guns N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, Stranger Things.

[24:56] The stadium topper for Guns N' Roses by Pin Graphics.

[25:00] Indiana Jones by Elite Pinball Toppers and the Halloween Pinball Topper.

[25:05] Now, what was my favorite one?

[25:08] You know me, I'm a fancy pants kind of man.

[25:10] So obviously the 24 karat Gilded Gold Indiana Jones by Elite Pinball Toppers.

[25:17] I put that one down.

[25:19] I mean, the thing is epic.

[25:20] I mean, you can't lie.

[25:21] I mean, you get what you pay for though.

[25:23] It's like 2,500 bucks, but it's definitely my favorite one and it doesn't stop.

[25:28] Favorite homebrew pinball machines.

[25:30] We've got poker game, Boys Night Out, Pin Graph, Greek Gods, Rock Lives, Cuphead,

[25:38] Felina and Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Billy Madison.

[25:43] So here's the thing with these.

[25:44] I haven't played any of these, any of these, but I voted for Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

[25:51] Okay, Rookie of the Year.

[25:53] Jack Danger, a man who's not a rookie of the year.

[25:56] He's been in this industry for like over a decade, but here he is because he is now

[26:01] designing for a stern pinball.

[26:03] It's just like weird, right?

[26:04] This Rookie of the Year category, something needs to give.

[26:07] Like they need to not lump everybody into the same category of Rookie of the Year.

[26:12] This has always been a controversial one because Jack Danger's gonna win.

[26:16] He's gonna win now that he's over at Stern and everyone knows who he is.

[26:21] His impact on pinball has been probably the most felt out of everybody in this category.

[26:27] But then you have like a 10-year-old girl who helped her dad, Sophia, make a pinball machine.

[26:32] And then you've got Spooky Luke, you've got Mark Sadin, who's over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[26:37] But let me ask you this.

[26:38] How is Mark Sadin up for Rookie of the Year?

[26:42] What has he done?

[26:43] I know he made Metroid Pinball, but how is he a Rookie of the Year at Jersey Jack Pinball?

[26:49] Nothing he's done has even been seen by the pinball community other than what he did before Jersey Jack Pinball.

[26:57] So he's gonna get no votes.

[26:59] Shouldn't he be up for Rookie of the Year when his game gets released by Jersey Jack Pinball?

[27:03] And then you've got Scott Gullix from American Pinball, who's not a Rookie either.

[27:08] Scott made Legends of the Hala in Rath of Olympus years ago.

[27:12] Like these aren't new things.

[27:14] And so Jack Danger is gonna win.

[27:16] And that concludes our 2021 Twippy Picks.

[27:21] Can you see why I don't think it's gonna be the most exciting award show?

[27:24] They're gonna need animated and entertaining hosts to make this show fun to watch because it's gonna be real boring.

[27:32] Godzilla, Godzilla, Godzilla, Jack Danger, Zambietti, always the same names, always the same people.

[27:40] And it's gonna be so boring seeing Kaneda go up there and go five for five, baby.

[27:44] We're gonna take it.

[27:45] Anyway, everybody, thank you so much for tuning in to Kaneda's Pinball Podcast.

[27:49] I'm trying to think like what's next?

[27:52] Like what's next to talk about?

[27:54] I've been getting a lot of interesting emails and notes from you guys, so keep it up.

[27:58] One of the topics I want to discuss is really how dealers are gonna navigate their LE allocations moving forward and what I think is gonna happen.

[28:06] And is there any responsibility by these dealers to keep these scalpers from buying these games?

[28:13] But I will say, as I look at Rush LE, I don't think people are really biting at these scalping prices.

[28:20] And I'm seeing the people who bought it for like 11 trying to sell it for 13, 14.

[28:25] And people aren't buying it immediately.

[28:28] But I also think the drought is coming and there aren't many games.

[28:32] And if you have a Rush LE, once people start unboxing them, if you have one in a box,

[28:39] I think you'll be able to sell it for 14K easily when that moment happens.

[28:44] I wouldn't pay the scalper price now, but I might pay it if I know that box can go on a truck and be in my game room in a week.

[28:53] That's when you're gonna get maximum dollar.

[29:41] And this weekend on my Saturday morning spectacular, make sure you tune in.

[29:45] Because at 11 a.m., I'm getting someone a rush L.E. later.

[30:05] You
