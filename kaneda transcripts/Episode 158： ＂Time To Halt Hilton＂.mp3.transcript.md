[00:00] Alright, welcome to episode 158 of Canadian Pinball Podcast on Muiros, Canada.

[00:58] I'm going to go over a couple of news items that are going on.

[01:05] I want to talk about some games that are currently for sale and give my observations about what I think about those games and what people are asking for them.

[01:16] We might do some other stuff. This is going to be one of those early mornings I don't really have a show agenda, but I know you want a new show.

[01:24] Here's a deal. Let's talk about buying Alien Pinball.

[01:28] For many of you out there, when Andrew Highway first announced Alien Pinball, it was a dream come true.

[01:34] This is a theme that people have been waiting for for a really long time.

[01:39] It is one of the most popular sci-fi themes of all time, and we all agree that sci-fi themes make for great pinball machines.

[01:47] The anticipation of this game was always super high.

[01:53] Ever since hearing we were going to get an Alien Pinball machine, it's been nothing but let down after let down after let down.

[02:04] Think about it for a minute.

[02:06] The most excited you probably ever were. You probably ever were excited for Alien Pinball was the moment you heard there would be an Alien Pinball machine.

[02:17] But once things actually were revealed, nothing ever really became more exciting than hearing about it.

[02:25] We saw the Playfield artwork, we saw the cabinet and we saw it on the Playfield.

[02:34] It was like, alright, I guess so.

[02:37] And then all this shit hit the fan and it's just been like a couple years of non-stop delays and excuses and ultimately the company going belly up.

[02:47] But here's the thing. There was a period where most people who went in on Alien, they were believing things were going to go according to Andrew's plan.

[02:57] They felt they were going to get the game when he said they would get the game.

[03:00] And I have a hard time even remembering. I believe it was something like April of 2015 is when the game was originally promised.

[03:09] I'm not going to go over the whole story. We've covered it a million times on this podcast.

[03:14] But there are people out there that after that two year delay and shit show, there are actually people out there who went in on one,

[03:24] went in on one, during that period this year when Andrew Highway was trickling out a couple machines.

[03:34] Remember when he said production had begun and it was kind of like February, March and a couple machines were trickling out to people.

[03:41] There are actually people who went in to place and order during that time period.

[03:46] Now I want to read someone's experience from Pinside and because I just want to give my commentary because this individual has a story to tell.

[03:56] And this comes from Pinside user, Net Hawk 86.

[04:01] And he writes, I might not read the whole thing but I want to capture his story properly.

[04:05] He writes, Welp, count me in on one of those who've been scammed multiple times on this pin, Van Wagon.

[04:14] Coin taker and Highway have both been very negligent and dishonest with me for the past several months.

[04:21] And I am done bitching my, sorry, done biting my tongue.

[04:26] He paid an initial $1,000 deposit to hold an Ellie game from Coin taker which took him weeks of emails just to give them money.

[04:37] He said, I paid more down over months depending on what I've been hearing regarding the company.

[04:43] He said, I stopped at about $3,500 and waited a couple months during the proto games that snuck out and complete.

[04:53] Remember, that's when Andrew was sending games out with no heads.

[04:56] Okay, so this guy at that point, he sees Highway sending out games that are incomplete.

[05:01] He's got $3,500 down and finally he told Coin taker I'm out and I want to refund.

[05:08] Okay, so he had a moment of clarity there and that was a smart decision, right?

[05:11] I was telling people I was beating that drum, get out, get out.

[05:15] There is no way Andrew Highway will make this happen.

[05:20] And for those who had money with Coin taker, Coin taker would happily refund your money because Coin taker didn't give Highway the money.

[05:30] They kept the money at Coin taker.

[05:33] Okay, so then he goes on to write, three weeks past with no response again to my refund request.

[05:39] Then out of the clear blue sky, I get an email saying, what if I promised you your Ellie at your door within 30 days?

[05:48] Seriously, we just got told they are shipping our pins now.

[05:52] I told them that sounds good and after again sending a couple emails with no response and excuse after excuse of why,

[06:00] I finally got them on the line again to vaguely answer some questions.

[06:06] I sent them the remaining due and was paid in full with a promise of my game arriving at my door end of July.

[06:14] July came and went, finally called Coin taker and got immediate response was told they had an issue with the computers and they were delayed while they are upgraded.

[06:25] I was annoyed of course and made a stink about why I got scammed out of my refund by both parties and was then told by Coin taker that they will call me back in an hour.

[06:38] I got the call and they skyped with someone at highway and made a deal where my Ellie was being sent in the batch of standards at to Coin taker as one off as Ellie weren't being made yet but they could get my one due to the promise made.

[06:55] I was told then end of August my game will arrive at my door.

[06:59] I called Coin taker on the 22nd of August to confirm and was told yes you are still on schedule.

[07:05] I heard the shipment arrived and standards were going out the door after they removed any fiber optic lights but no Ellie.

[07:14] He then goes on the right.

[07:16] Well here we are.

[07:17] The 6th of September I called Coin taker and asked the question was told for whatever reason they had issues blah blah blah and that they were shipping out computers and new playfields so that took up time and they couldn't get my Ellie out.

[07:32] But my Ellie should be on the water now and that they will confirm with highway to make sure and get back to me later last night.

[07:40] No response from Coin taker.

[07:42] I get consistent no communication from Coin taker and excuses after excuses of why no email responses to disappearing emails to why I can't pick up the phone to even I totally forgot.

[07:55] Alright so he's that then goes on the say as a customer I'm annoyed and pissed at Coin taker handling me this way absolutely zero updates unless I how and pound them every way I can for something I can forgive the dates a bit and that's beyond their control and it is on highway but they have consistently left me in the dark.

[08:15] He then goes on the right I know very well that my game is not on the water and won't be until maybe October when the day they will start shipping a Ellie's this is my first new pin okay this is this guy's first pin and he goes in on alien can we we're going to talk about this I'm going to I'm going to dissect this guy's story.

[08:35] I'm not officially gun shy of ever doing this again my whole body this whole time has been screaming to demand a refund and run far far away I did before I was ignored and then promised my item I never had this amazing customer support or got these phone updates that others have had the privilege of.

[08:55] Even after paying in full sorry for the rant I was just so damn pissed today after spending four hours of trying to call Coin taker and getting the call back in 15 at least six times and then immediate voicemail after one to two rings okay.

[09:09] Alright so I want to talk about this I want to talk about this guy's experience I want to talk about everything he's saying about coin taker and everything he's saying about his experience with highway pinball now at the end of the day net hawk 86.

[09:24] You should have just got a refund you saw all the bullshit going on with highway and you still stuck it out now I know what Melissa told you a coin taker that you might have your game by the end of July now that leads me to believe that Melissa was going off of what she was being told by the new investors okay now coin taker is the middle man they are simply the middle man they are not making this pinball machine they are not aware of what's actually on a boat

[09:53] they have been told so many lies over the years by Andrew highway that I am not ever I have a hard time blaming them for anything if you want your money back now just get your money back they'll give you a refund the problem is this the problem is this is people don't want their money back they want their alien pinball machine and when you want your alien pinball machine and you want an answer when you're going to get your money back

[10:22] when you're going to get your alien pinball machine what are they to do they they get told so many dates by the people at highway pinball and those dates are consistently missed people at forgotten where this is this is a little bit of the same should show all over again did you people forget the date that the highway pinball company told us they would be shipping games and shipping containers over to coin taker they promise to be shipping games

[10:51] August 14th or go back and read their own communication that is when they promised games would go out what happened games didn't go out what did we say would happen on this podcast games wouldn't go out this is the broken record story of highway pinball of alien pinball

[11:11] miss promises miss deadlines miss everything everything has always gone wrong nothing is ever ever gone smoothly gone on schedule

[11:25] and coin taker is probably fed up beyond belief and I am sticking up a little bit for coin taker here because what do you want to do what do you want to do when they're being lied to and you're howling them and it's like yes they probably shouldn't have told you that your game would arrive by the end of july

[11:41] but the only reason they told you that is because they were told that and the problem with highway pinball and the problem with a company that's over in the UK that is the middle man for all these people who want their games in the US

[11:57] is there's just there's so far away there's a six hour time difference between highway and coin taker maybe even more right because I know coin taker is in pencil

[12:10] and there's such a time difference there's also just like they're not getting the truth they've got angry customers if I were coin taker I would have just like refunded everyone's money and said we are not dealing with you until we have games in box because I'll say this I'm friends with christian Melissa you know and I know for a fact that nobody ever has a bad experience with coin taker when they buy a game that's in a box

[12:39] that's in a box that's in coin taker's warehouse you are going to have a bad experience with coin taker if you expect to get your alien standard or your alien le when you were told you will get it that is just the nature of anyone who's tried to get their pinball machine from highway

[12:59] it's been a total shit show okay now there's a new date I love these highway pinball dates like they they appear every once in a while

[13:07] everyone gets all excited it's going to be better now we're going to get our games now the games are on the boat you know it's like it's like these games keep getting shipped on the Titanic you know it's they they never quite arrive so the new date is this September 10th September 10th that's my mom's birthday September 10th is when people are expecting games to arrive okay when is that Sunday the games are going to arrive on a Sunday right then anyone even go check the game is going to be on the t-shirt

[13:35] right then anyone even go check to see when September 10th is so that means they they're coming on the Sunday it's Sunday right I want to make sure I'm right what what's today's date what's today's date I can't even September 7th alright and Thursday so the 8th is Friday the 9th it's a Sunday okay you're not getting your games on September 10th people it's not it's not happening it's not happening this is September 11th is it the week of September 11th okay so this is an interesting day

[14:03] I think a lot of people are looking at this date and saying if these games going to arrive then like what the fuck right I mean and look I see the pictures from highways factory there's a bunch of parts those people there what I haven't seen is this I still have not seen a video of alien production I haven't seen a video of how many workers they have there I haven't seen a video of the assembly line moving for all we know it could see what I haven't seen a video of the assembly line moving for all we know it could see what I haven't seen it's like the assembly line moving.

[14:31] For all we know it could still just be a you know Andrew's assembly line trying to figure it out all over again and these investors they've been pretty quiet they've been in the background doing God knows what so when I see stories like this when I see stories like this of individuals who went in on the game after the shit show I don't really think they have anyone to blame but themselves don't blame coin taker don't like I

[15:01] get refun why wouldn't you just get a refund the people who don't get refunds in my book are idiot you're an idiot if you did just go get an alien pinball refund and I'll tell you why you're an idiot and I mean this I don't want to be mean to you I don't want to challenge your intelligence but you're an idiot you're an idiot because there is no alien Ellie there's nothing in the lien that makes it in Ellie okay so you're an idiot for staying very

[15:31] and on the LA because you're not getting anything.

[15:34] You're getting a piece of artwork that's amazing,

[15:37] that's covered up by the LCD screen.

[15:39] Then what else are you getting?

[15:41] They took away the gloss black trim.

[15:44] All right, you want what?

[15:46] You want the green trim.

[15:47] You could go paint any alien standard

[15:49] with the trim color you want.

[15:52] There's nothing on the play field that's different.

[15:54] There's no game features that are different.

[15:55] There's nothing.

[15:56] There's just an anniversary art package on the side

[16:01] that isn't really anything that nobody will care about.

[16:05] There's nothing limited or rare.

[16:07] The fact that they're still not sold out,

[16:09] it just goes to show.

[16:12] So you have nothing really limited.

[16:13] You might as well just get the standard

[16:15] because the standards got everything you really need.

[16:17] They took out the fiber optic cables.

[16:20] The ramp lighting, the Eli lighting.

[16:23] You're not getting anything.

[16:24] So you're an idiot for staying in on it.

[16:27] Okay, you're just an idiot for staying in on alien

[16:29] in general because here's why they're not going to stop

[16:33] making the standards, which are the same game as the Eli.

[16:37] So why wouldn't you just get your money back?

[16:40] Have your money safely in hand.

[16:42] And then wait until there's a game in a box.

[16:47] Do you really have a fear of missing out of getting a game?

[16:51] If highway pinball is to survive,

[16:54] if they're out of make it,

[16:56] they will be making alien pinball machines

[16:58] for many years to come.

[17:01] This isn't a company that will be moving on the game too.

[17:05] And there's only gonna be a few aliens that trickle out.

[17:07] They need to sell a boatload of these games

[17:10] to make up for all of the financial trouble.

[17:15] Andrew put them in.

[17:16] This company's in the red.

[17:17] Okay, so I didn't mean to be that stride in.

[17:20] I didn't mean to be so insulting of you people out there.

[17:25] But if you're in on an alien and you like don't wanna refund,

[17:31] I just don't get what's going on in your head.

[17:33] I really don't.

[17:34] I think it's an idiotic move.

[17:36] And you have no one to blame but yourself.

[17:38] You absolutely have no one to blame but yourself

[17:40] because highway pinball the investors

[17:43] have been giving people refunds.

[17:45] Now we still know on this date,

[17:47] on September 7th, 2017,

[17:50] not everybody has received a refund who's asked for one.

[17:56] These guys are doing what I said they do.

[17:58] They're stalling certain people.

[18:00] They wanna get the games out.

[18:02] They think once games start shipping,

[18:04] all is gonna go well.

[18:05] And that may be the case.

[18:07] They may be able to dig themselves out of the hole

[18:10] but a lot of games have to ship.

[18:12] And a lot of people have to be satisfied

[18:14] with how the games work.

[18:15] And as we heard from Brody Even Pinball,

[18:19] the guys who reviewed it,

[18:22] man, there's a lot of negative reviews of the game

[18:25] saying it's clunky piece of shit.

[18:28] And the only one, right?

[18:30] Remember the shill?

[18:31] He's the same guy.

[18:32] I'm gonna call him out again.

[18:33] The guy who like, oh this game's great.

[18:35] It's the best game ever.

[18:36] It's one of the best flows ever is Hilton.

[18:38] The guy, if you really read the alien threads,

[18:41] the people who have gushed about how the game shoots

[18:44] have been the same shills that have led people down

[18:47] terrible paths and have led so many people astray.

[18:51] You know, it's the same thing now.

[18:52] We're gonna talk a little about what he's doing now

[18:53] in the predator thread.

[18:56] He's a shill for the company.

[18:58] He's always been a shill for the company.

[19:00] There's a reason why Hilton got his alien pinball machine

[19:04] before he cut the line.

[19:06] He got the machine before paying customers.

[19:08] And I won't let this guy off the hook.

[19:11] And I know he listens to this show.

[19:13] And I think it's despicable what Andrew Highway did.

[19:16] He went into cooots with Hilton instead of giving people

[19:20] who are waiting years their game.

[19:22] He gave it to Hilton because he knew that Hilton

[19:26] would shill the game and tell everyone how amazing it was

[19:31] because Andrew believed that if he had someone like that

[19:34] advocating for the game, he would talk people off of the ledge

[19:39] and keep people from asking for refunds

[19:42] because Hilton said the game is so amazing.

[19:44] I think the most laughable piece of content

[19:47] I've ever seen on Pinside is that stupid JPEG image

[19:51] where Hilton has the alien play field

[19:54] and has a line drawn to all the different shots

[19:57] that the game has.

[19:58] And it's got the most shots ever

[20:00] and it's got the best flow.

[20:01] And it's the most incredible experience in pinball.

[20:04] And Dave Sanders is the new king of design.

[20:07] I mean, that's what you was saying that Dave Sanders

[20:09] is better than like Steve Richie and George Gomez

[20:12] and Pat Lawler, he's the new king.

[20:14] I mean, come on, come on, that's not shilling.

[20:17] And I hope Dave Sanders comes on the show

[20:19] and Dave, I want to talk to you.

[20:20] You email me, he said he wants to come on.

[20:22] I email back, Dave, let's do it.

[20:24] Let's talk about what's going on over at Highway.

[20:26] This company's been completely hiding

[20:29] from facing the music and coming on shows

[20:32] and talking about what's going on.

[20:34] So you have Hilton shilling the game

[20:37] and is trying to prevent people from asking for refunds.

[20:40] But look, it's September 7th, everybody.

[20:42] If you don't, if you don't ask for a refund today,

[20:46] you have nobody to blame but yourself.

[20:48] All right, I've belabor the point.

[20:49] I belabor the point.

[20:50] Let's go on to the other thing, the other area,

[20:52] the thread on the pin side, where Hilton is all up in it again,

[20:56] all up in it again.

[20:57] And you know what, no one really calls him out that much

[20:59] because Robin has decided that he will allow people

[21:04] like Hilton to be the ever-present voice on pin side.

[21:09] And it's the reason why pin side sucks these days.

[21:11] I don't know if you guys feel it, but pin side, man,

[21:13] it's like a dump.

[21:14] It's a toxic waystone.

[21:16] It is not what it used to be

[21:18] because all the good people have left.

[21:21] They're not as active.

[21:23] They're not, they don't post as much.

[21:25] And you just got guys like this.

[21:28] So okay, so the Kevin thread,

[21:30] here's what Hilton's doing all over again.

[21:33] And he did the same thing in the magic road thread.

[21:35] And I want to like, I really think like people should just

[21:38] like get this guy out of the forums.

[21:41] Get, just say, you know what, bro,

[21:44] like you do more harm than help.

[21:46] So now in the Kevin and Skip B and Predator thread,

[21:50] Hilton is now offering $500,

[21:52] which we all know is a lot of money for him.

[21:54] He's offering $500 for anyone that has

[21:59] photographic evidence of people who own

[22:03] some of the Predator to machines, right?

[22:07] So some of them are out there with Clay Has-One, he says,

[22:10] and then Tim Fife, I believe, has one.

[22:13] And so he's offering $500.

[22:15] If you can get a photo of Clay's machine, right?

[22:19] And it's like really fucking creepy and weird

[22:21] that he's doing that, right?

[22:23] You're offering people money to potentially trespass

[22:27] onto someone's property to take a picture of them

[22:31] in ownership of the machine.

[22:33] And then he's like, well, I don't mean trespassing.

[22:35] That's not what I'm advocating.

[22:37] I know that these guys have people over their club houses

[22:41] for game night, and I'm just hoping someone will take

[22:44] a picture and send it to me.

[22:45] Okay, so you want one of these people's friends

[22:48] to turn on their friend to make $500 from you Hilton.

[22:54] And then it's like, why?

[22:55] Why are you on this witch hunt?

[22:56] Because in his world, you remember,

[22:59] this guy is the number one reason people stayed in on predator.

[23:04] He is the number one reason people stayed in on predator.

[23:08] He's also probably one of the number one reasons

[23:10] people stayed in on alien.

[23:12] Okay, so you have one guy who on two machines

[23:15] have burned people consistently.

[23:17] He's at the center of it.

[23:19] He's the center advocate for both of these machines.

[23:23] And the fact that he's still posting

[23:25] in the predator thread is just disgusting.

[23:29] And now he's all of a sudden wearing a cape

[23:31] and he's out for justice.

[23:33] And he's gonna be the one who goes and gets these machines.

[23:36] And he's gonna be the one who incriminates those

[23:39] who have machines who wrongfully have possession

[23:41] of a predator.

[23:42] And you know, he suggested they do.

[23:44] And this goes to show like, I really think Hilton is like

[23:47] five cans short of a six pack.

[23:50] He's suggesting that we repossess these machines.

[23:54] Let's take them back and then auction them off

[23:57] and then give that money to the other people

[24:01] who got burned.

[24:03] And it's like Hilton, do you even like think before you post?

[24:06] You can't auction off property that is illegal.

[24:10] All right, it's not licensed merchandise by Fox.

[24:13] These games were made without their permission.

[24:15] You then can't go sell them in an auction, you fool.

[24:19] You're a fool, you can't do that, all right?

[24:24] Just stop, bro.

[24:25] Go away, go away.

[24:27] I mean, I read this stuff.

[24:29] It's like, I'm the only podcast that is trying to like,

[24:32] remove what I believe to be a cancer from the hobby.

[24:37] Because no one, like why do you want a guy like this

[24:40] talking and giving people so many people advice, right?

[24:44] Okay, so what's funny is this too.

[24:46] He's on this witch hunt to like,

[24:48] find the people who have the predators.

[24:50] There's all this debate about how many Kevin made was it

[24:53] two, was it four, was it ten, you know,

[24:55] did clay by parts and then assemble his own.

[24:58] And so what if he did?

[25:00] So what if he did?

[25:01] You know, anyone who got burned by predator really

[25:03] looking back, you have no one to blame but yourself as well.

[25:06] Kevin, Koolik, had the license to an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.

[25:11] He had permission and paid the money to use Arnold's

[25:14] likeness on his game.

[25:15] You really believe a guy who was building a game

[25:18] in his mom's basement had that permission.

[25:21] Look, he, a good thing for you guys,

[25:22] he only charged $4,500.

[25:24] You didn't lose a ton of more money.

[25:27] But you also, you learned a lesson.

[25:29] You learned a lesson.

[25:31] Don't believe anything until you see a game in box.

[25:35] You guys all follow these dingle berries down the bad road

[25:39] and got burned.

[25:41] You believed Andrew Highway, Dingo Berry, Kevin Koolik,

[25:43] Dingo Berry, J-Pop, Dingo Berry.

[25:45] You believed them all.

[25:46] You believed everything.

[25:48] J-Pop sold people $16,000 machines.

[25:52] Let's think about this for a minute.

[25:54] People gave J-Pop 16 grand for a machine

[25:58] where all he had was the name of the machine.

[26:01] He had no manufacturing company.

[26:03] He had no past experience assembling machines,

[26:07] engineering machines.

[26:08] He was just a designer and people said, take my money.

[26:13] Okay, take my money.

[26:14] It just goes to show how insane we all are.

[26:18] I know I called the Analyen people idiots.

[26:20] I'm not even calling helped in idiots.

[26:22] This freaking hobby turns everybody into an idiot

[26:27] at one time or another.

[26:28] I was an idiot.

[26:29] I was a fucking idiot.

[26:31] I gave someone a good friend.

[26:34] I gave commercial $23,000 for a magic girl machine

[26:40] when I didn't even know if American pinball could get it done.

[26:44] Because all I saw just a bunch of empty cabinets

[26:48] and that was good enough for me.

[26:50] I was a fucking idiot.

[26:52] I spent six months having sleepless nights worried

[26:57] that I got burned, worried that I wasn't gonna get shit,

[27:01] worried that John didn't have permission

[27:03] to even sell the magic girls or give them out

[27:05] because of the agreement with Pentasia, worried,

[27:08] worried, worried, worried, and I was an idiot

[27:11] because at the end of the day, at the end of the day,

[27:14] I could have walked and offered anybody.

[27:18] Once the games had shipped, I could have waved $20,000,

[27:21] $25,000 around and had a magic girl without any hassle.

[27:27] Instead I was an idiot.

[27:28] We get all get blinded by the lights.

[27:31] But what Hilton's doing now in the predator thread

[27:34] on this witch hunt, remember he did the same thing

[27:36] in that other thread recently

[27:37] and which one was it?

[27:39] Low and behold, it was magic girl.

[27:41] If you go back and read what he did in the magic girl thread,

[27:45] all he did, all he did was said, this is bullshit.

[27:49] People can't get these machines.

[27:51] He was really just mad because I was getting a machine.

[27:53] Let's be honest, Hilton.

[27:55] And he's like, we have to go repossess these machines.

[27:57] Remember it was all this, all like, we've got like,

[28:00] 90 days to go to court and file an injunctioning

[28:05] and to prevent them from sending them out

[28:07] and repossessing these things as assets

[28:10] and auctioning them off.

[28:11] It was the same exact tactic that he wanted to do

[28:15] with the magic girls.

[28:16] And it just comes down to one simple thing.

[28:19] The man is bitter.

[28:21] He's angry that people get these rare machines.

[28:26] He's angry that someone has something

[28:30] that he doesn't have in the pinball world.

[28:32] He thinks like, wooly is the greatest game

[28:35] and he's like, he remember he said he turned down

[28:37] offers for like over $20,000 for wooly.

[28:41] Stupid, stupid.

[28:43] Anyway, Hilton needs to stop.

[28:46] I didn't, I just wasn't even supposed to be

[28:48] about Hilton this show.

[28:49] I just, I just remembered reading that last night

[28:52] and saw what he was doing and I just got so disgusted.

[28:55] And because this is my podcast,

[28:56] I can take it in any direction.

[28:58] And this is one of those shows

[28:59] where there isn't any real direction.

[29:00] So long story short, I think Hilton needs to just go

[29:05] away.

[29:06] When the purge that was supposed to happen on Pinside

[29:08] would be better off if they banned him.

[29:10] I think he leads people into terrible decisions.

[29:13] I don't think he thinks before he posts.

[29:15] And I think the community lets him get away with it.

[29:18] And if I was still on Pinside,

[29:20] the number one role I played on that site,

[29:23] I trolled the troll.

[29:26] Sorry, I trolled the trolls.

[29:28] I trolled the trolls.

[29:29] I made the trolls get off the site.

[29:33] And then they booted me and they're all back.

[29:34] They're running the asylum.

[29:36] All right, what else is going on in Pimball?

[29:39] You know, I've been going down an interesting sort of

[29:42] bunch of threads in terms of things that are for sale.

[29:44] And on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast,

[29:46] let's talk about some interesting things

[29:48] that are up for sale and what my thoughts are on it.

[29:51] Because you know, we talk about the collectors

[29:53] and what people would spend their money on.

[29:55] And I noticed some things out there

[29:56] that I just wanted to call out.

[29:58] One thing that was interesting, I saw it.

[29:59] I'm not sure if it's sold.

[30:01] A Big Bang Bar Playfield that has been restored

[30:06] and clear coded by, maybe not restored,

[30:08] but cleared by HEPPimball, high end pimples.

[30:11] A Big Bang Bar Playfield.

[30:13] And it was listed for the ever affordable price

[30:17] of $3,000 for one Playfield,

[30:22] for a piece of wood with art on it.

[30:24] No game, no, no, no, no Big Bang Bar.

[30:26] I can't play it.

[30:28] $3,000 for a piece of artwork.

[30:30] Now what do I think about that?

[30:32] You know what?

[30:34] If you love Playfields and you love Playfield art,

[30:39] and a mass produced Playfield,

[30:44] like CPR Gold Edition of Toden or Adam's Family,

[30:48] will sell for $1,000.

[30:50] Do I think that a Big Bang Bar is worth $3,000?

[30:57] With everything, the caveat is always,

[30:59] it's worth that to somebody and it's art.

[31:02] It's a Playfield.

[31:04] You know what?

[31:05] I actually think that's not a terrible price.

[31:08] I think that I think someone will buy it.

[31:11] I think someone who has a Big Bang Bar collection

[31:14] who wants to have everything that goes with the game

[31:17] to have a spare Playfield that has been

[31:20] expertly clear coded.

[31:23] I think it'll sell in this hobby.

[31:25] I really do.

[31:26] I think that's not insane.

[31:30] All right.

[31:30] Now let's talk about other stuff.

[31:33] There is a Big Lebowski on Pinside, For Sale,

[31:38] Prices Firm at $15,000.

[31:41] It has less than 200 plays.

[31:44] Everything is working in it.

[31:46] The owner says everything out of the box works perfectly.

[31:49] I think there's like the diverter is in fully painted black,

[31:52] but other than that, everything is working great.

[31:55] Now, the question is to you guys out there listening,

[31:58] do you think the Big Lebowski, where we're at,

[32:01] is worth $15,000?

[32:04] It's an interesting question,

[32:06] because as we know, there's a lot going on

[32:08] in flux with Dutch pinball.

[32:10] They're trying to get everything together

[32:13] and will they do it?

[32:16] So that's my question to you.

[32:17] If you think the Big Lebowski's worth $15,000 at this stage,

[32:21] email me at canadapinballatgmail.com.

[32:24] Because I can hear you guys yelling at your car radios

[32:29] and you're wearing your headphones,

[32:31] being like, canada, yes, canada, no.

[32:33] So what do I think?

[32:34] So I think that,

[32:37] this is a hard one,

[32:38] because I wanna say that I don't think Dutch pinball

[32:43] is gonna get things together.

[32:46] I don't have much faith.

[32:48] I don't understand how they're gonna reengineer the whole game

[32:51] and remake it and reproduce it and remanufacture it.

[32:55] I don't think ARA is gonna sit by and let them do that.

[32:58] I just don't see this thing ending the right way.

[33:03] Look, I do hope it does,

[33:04] because I've said this many times,

[33:06] and I know I make fun of Barri and Yop,

[33:08] and they might listen to this show.

[33:10] And guys, like I think everything I say about you,

[33:12] I think all the jokes,

[33:14] I think you know you deserve it on some level.

[33:16] I think you do.

[33:16] I think you can't blame me for making fun of you guys,

[33:20] but you can.

[33:21] Like, do I hope that the Big Lebowski comes out?

[33:24] Yes, because I do believe that the Big Lebowski,

[33:28] and I look at all the pinball machines

[33:30] that have come out in the last few years.

[33:32] I think it is one of the coolest pinball machines

[33:35] I've ever seen.

[33:36] I think it's one of those pinball machines that is packed.

[33:39] It is jam packed with awesome features,

[33:44] with magical items.

[33:45] It is the world under glass that we all want.

[33:48] If you look at the Big Lebowski,

[33:49] next to Star Wars, it's a fucking joke.

[33:52] It's a fucking joke that that is how they

[33:54] theme integrated Star Wars,

[33:56] and that is how they theme integrated the Big Lebowski.

[33:59] The Big Lebowski has a fucking bowling alley,

[34:01] and it guys, a fucking bowling alley.

[34:03] And it actually, when it came out,

[34:05] it cost the same amount of money as Star Wars.

[34:07] It's got an upper play field, a lower play field.

[34:10] It's got a rug that rolls out.

[34:12] It's got everything you could want in a pinball machine.

[34:15] It's the coolest freaking thing.

[34:17] I mean, if anyone stands over a Big Lebowski,

[34:20] they see something that is fucking pinball magic.

[34:23] And I think pinball machines should,

[34:24] when you stand over them, just blow you away

[34:27] by the world you see under the glass.

[34:28] So can you tell, like, I really want a Big Lebowski.

[34:33] I would love to buy a Big Lebowski.

[34:36] I just cannot, for the life of me,

[34:39] feel good about the two options I have

[34:42] to get a Big Lebowski.

[34:43] So option one is $15,000 for this machine.

[34:48] Do I think it's worth it?

[34:49] The answer is this.

[34:52] All things considered, I do think the Big Lebowski,

[34:55] with the amount of machines that are out there,

[34:57] knowing that there may never be more that come out,

[35:00] $15,000 to me, with a machine that I know is working

[35:05] that's in perfect condition.

[35:08] That doesn't seem at a bounds at all.

[35:12] What would I rather have the Big Lebowski

[35:14] or Batman Super Ali?

[35:16] Right now, all things considered,

[35:17] I'd rather have the Big Lebowski.

[35:19] There's less of them out there.

[35:21] It's a better game than Batman Super Ali.

[35:23] It's more unique, it's more rare.

[35:25] It's built with much better features than Batman Super Ali.

[35:30] So I'd rather have the game, and they're the same price.

[35:33] Someone just bought a Batman SLE used for $14,000.

[35:37] I would rather bought a Big Lebowski.

[35:41] Now the big problem is this.

[35:42] How do you buy a Big Lebowski for $15,000

[35:46] and feel good about playing the game?

[35:49] Because if anything happens to it,

[35:51] you don't have any support.

[35:53] And as someone who just went through six months

[35:57] of having magic girl not working

[35:59] and the lights going out,

[36:01] I can tell you how frustrating it is

[36:03] to have absolutely no support

[36:05] and no peace of mind that you have backup parts,

[36:09] backup boards, backup things for the game.

[36:12] All right, it's not fun.

[36:15] So for that reason, I don't really think you can go in

[36:17] on this machine unless you're a collector

[36:20] who really wants to put it there, not play it much

[36:22] and just know they have a really rare version.

[36:25] And the other thing I've been seeing people say is,

[36:27] like which version of the Big Lebowski

[36:29] will be the Sawdapter one, right?

[36:32] Will it be the ARA manufactured one

[36:35] or will it be this new contract manufacturer

[36:38] that they have lined up?

[36:40] See, that's, I've never seen a machine

[36:42] that's like swapped manufacturers

[36:46] like in its design cycle and its manufacturing cycle.

[36:50] So that's gonna be interesting.

[36:51] So that's one option.

[36:52] The other option, if you don't wanna pay twice the price

[36:57] for someone's game, is to wait to see

[37:00] if Dutch figures stuff out.

[37:03] And who knows how long that's gonna take, right?

[37:06] So I personally, I would, it's a gamble, right?

[37:12] Because if Dutch folds and can't figure it out,

[37:15] this Big Lebowski for $15,000 will easily,

[37:19] will easily skyrocket in value to being 20, $25,000,

[37:23] easily, easily, with only 40 out there.

[37:27] And then the question becomes,

[37:29] how do you get one of those ARA games

[37:32] that's in box somewhere that's not even open

[37:34] that they built and are just holding,

[37:37] those are the ones that go grab.

[37:39] And it'll become this like mythological game,

[37:43] like one of the ARA 40, you know,

[37:46] it'll be this thing that people will hunt after.

[37:49] So Big Lebowski $15,000 firm, it's a dilemma.

[37:53] It's a dilemma for high end collectors

[37:54] on what to do if they really want one.

[37:56] I think you have to approach with extreme caution.

[37:59] All right, on the other end of the spectrum,

[38:02] all the way in the other end,

[38:03] is someone is selling,

[38:04] this is the first time I've seen this for sale,

[38:07] is Spider-Man the Penn Home Edition.

[38:09] You know that the Penn that's turned made,

[38:12] that stripped out version that's only meant

[38:14] for the home use environment,

[38:15] it's a different version of Spider-Man,

[38:16] it's not the same game as Spider-Man Vault.

[38:20] This person is selling it for $3,000.

[38:24] Now this new was $3,500.

[38:27] Now a $500 sort of depreciation

[38:31] is pretty normal for a new-in-box Pimball machine.

[38:33] The problem is when you're trying to sell Spider-Man

[38:36] the Penn on Penn side, it's a game

[38:39] that pretty much nobody really wants.

[38:41] The reason why we haven't seen many of these up for sale

[38:44] is that nobody wants it.

[38:47] I get Stern is trying to make an affordable Pimball machine,

[38:52] but if you want to go buy an affordable Pimball machine

[38:54] and I'll get to that a little bit later,

[38:56] there's plenty of really awesome, full featured

[39:00] Pimball machines that have more code in them

[39:03] that are in great condition from years ago

[39:07] that just make more sense,

[39:08] because for $3,000 you can buy such a better Pimball machine

[39:13] than the PIN, such a better one.

[39:16] That looks like a normal Pimball machine

[39:18] that isn't like this weird stripped down,

[39:20] like sort of, I don't know, lame attempt

[39:22] to make an entry-level Pimball machine.

[39:25] And my favorite comment in that thread

[39:28] is Pennside user waspinator writes,

[39:31] how is this not gone yet?

[39:33] This game is awesome and is still at this price.

[39:36] I hope he was being facetious,

[39:39] but I'm not sure he was, I'm not sure he was.

[39:41] All right, so another few games for sale that are interesting.

[39:45] So Fluffy Bunny,

[39:47] Fluffy Bunny is a Pennside member

[39:49] and he's selling two games right now.

[39:50] And I want to call this out

[39:52] because he's selling two games at the exact same price.

[39:56] And I think it's interesting when you look at these two games

[40:01] being priced exactly the same.

[40:03] And I want to give my thoughts on the two games he's selling.

[40:07] So he's moving into an RV and he wants to,

[40:09] like get rid of his Pimball machines.

[40:11] So he's selling America's Most Haunted, okay?

[40:15] So home he's only game and he says,

[40:19] he has one of the last ones produced

[40:22] and he is asking $7,000 for America's Most Haunted.

[40:27] And we know that America's Most Haunted was not $7,000 new.

[40:32] New in box, America's Most Haunted was $6,000.

[40:35] So this game is opened, it's not new,

[40:39] and he believes that America's Most Haunted

[40:42] has appreciated $1,000, okay?

[40:45] Now for this very same amount of money

[40:47] and we've all played America's Most Haunted,

[40:49] probably we've all seen it at a show.

[40:51] It's probably got, you know, it's Spooky's first attempt.

[40:54] I actually think it's better than Rob Zombie

[40:56] in Gameplay for sure,

[40:58] easily better than Rob Zombie in Gameplay.

[41:00] But it's also easily got one of the worst art packages

[41:04] ever in Pimball.

[41:06] You know why?

[41:07] Because you know who did the art, Ben Heck,

[41:08] who's not an artist.

[41:09] If they hired Matt Andrews to do the art

[41:13] for America's Most Haunted or Brian Al

[41:14] and or anyone, anyone decent,

[41:16] I think this would be one of the most sought after

[41:19] sort of rare boutique games.

[41:21] But because it's so hideous,

[41:23] I just, it looks so bad.

[41:25] It just, it just such a bad art package.

[41:28] Okay, now imagine that art package,

[41:30] what's in that game,

[41:31] imagine the features of the game,

[41:33] imagine everything that went into that game.

[41:35] For the same exact price,

[41:37] fluffy bunny is selling the Hobbit Smalg Edition, okay?

[41:43] Which is an excellent condition

[41:44] as everything in a Smalg edition.

[41:46] Like the beautiful Hobbit Ellie Smalg edition

[41:50] with Smalg's like beautiful artwork

[41:53] with everything that went into that game,

[41:54] with Keith's Code, all the depth of it,

[41:57] that beautiful LCD.

[41:59] That just goes to show Pimball people in a nutshell

[42:03] that we think that America's Most Haunted and Hobbit

[42:07] are worth the same amount of money.

[42:10] And if I'm Jersey Jack and I see this,

[42:12] and literally, and I see all the blood sweat and tears,

[42:15] everything that went into making the Hobbit what it is,

[42:18] and the quality of that machine.

[42:19] I mean, I don't like the Hobbit.

[42:23] Simply because it's just not for me.

[42:24] I don't like the way it shoots.

[42:26] I still think it's floaty,

[42:28] and I still think wide bodies are not fun.

[42:32] Like I just don't like wide body pins.

[42:34] And so, but I can appreciate the Hobbit for what went into it,

[42:40] and the quality and the amount that's in that game,

[42:44] versus like just lift the playfield on America's Most Haunted,

[42:47] and lift the playfield on the Hobbit,

[42:50] and look at them and tell me,

[42:52] just the materials that went into each,

[42:55] you could see where your money went with the Hobbit.

[42:57] In fact, the Hobbit is like more like a $9,000 machine,

[43:01] and America's Most Haunted looks more like a $4,000 machine,

[43:04] and yet they're priced at $7,000.

[43:06] The moral of the story is this,

[43:08] is that Pimball's a fucking weird marketplace,

[43:11] and what people spend on games,

[43:14] and what we think things are worth, is all over the place.

[43:17] And one person's gem is another person's piece of coal.

[43:22] And that's the thing about Pimball.

[43:24] Some people think I'm an absolute idiot

[43:27] for spending $23,000 plus on Magic Girl,

[43:30] and I say to them, you know what,

[43:33] if you wanna have a unique Pimball experience,

[43:36] and have the most beautiful Pimball game of all time,

[43:38] because I value art almost more than anything,

[43:41] because I suck at playing Pimball,

[43:43] I'm not gonna get to wizard mode in any game.

[43:46] I'm not gonna get to the Horde mode.

[43:48] I'm not one of these guys that wants to spend hours

[43:50] playing Pimball machines.

[43:51] I like playing Pimball machines a few times,

[43:53] but I see Pimball machines as a work of art,

[43:56] as an item in the home,

[43:58] that is like something that's a visually stunning,

[44:01] amazing thing that you can play.

[44:02] Someone said it to me the best.

[44:04] It's like a movie poster you can play,

[44:05] and that's how I see Pimball.

[44:07] It's a movie poster you can play.

[44:09] It's a theme, it's a piece of themed artwork

[44:12] that you can actually play that's interactive,

[44:14] and you can play Magic Girl.

[44:16] And those people who have played it,

[44:18] they've had fun playing it for the novelty that it is.

[44:22] Will we get it working when did I hope?

[44:24] And so that's the thing, it's like,

[44:26] maybe you think the Hobbit's great,

[44:28] and you would laugh at America's most haunted,

[44:30] maybe you think America's most haunted's worth is,

[44:32] I don't think it is, I don't think it will sell for that,

[44:35] but that's the hobby we're in.

[44:37] Alright, a few more items for sale,

[44:38] then we're gonna wrap this one up.

[44:39] I know, this is like, you're like,

[44:41] Chris, what podcast is this?

[44:42] The Bubba really, he got you up too early.

[44:44] Alright, so guys, I have to say,

[44:48] every once in a while, you gotta go to eBay.

[44:50] You gotta go to eBay to see what the hell is going on

[44:53] in the pinball marketplace,

[44:55] because separate from pinside,

[44:57] eBay is where things get listed for extremely high prices,

[45:00] primarily because there's, it's a broader audience,

[45:03] you might hook a sucker every once in a while.

[45:05] Alright, you might hook a sucker

[45:07] who has no idea about pinball

[45:09] who will pay an astronomical price for a game.

[45:11] Like there's a Simpson pinball party

[45:13] that is for sale on eBay, a Simpson pinball party,

[45:16] for $15,000.

[45:19] There's another one for sale on there,

[45:21] for $11,000.

[45:22] I love that one because it says,

[45:25] this has only been played under 12 times,

[45:28] less than 12 plays, $11,000 for the Simpson pinball party.

[45:34] For that much money, you can get a Simpson pinball party

[45:37] for just a few thousand dollars and send it to HEP

[45:40] and have the game back

[45:41] and be the nicest pinball party on the planet

[45:44] for cheaper than this.

[45:46] There's an ACDC Lucy for sale for $12,000.

[45:51] There's a Jetsons, remember the Jetsons

[45:53] that I was making fun of?

[45:54] That was originally $12,500.

[45:56] I wanna say thank you to everyone who listens

[45:58] to this podcast because I think if any of you

[46:01] have submitted $1 or offers as I suggested,

[46:04] we're, it's working.

[46:06] The new price now, the new bargain price

[46:08] for that Jetsons is now $10,500.

[46:11] So the person is starting to realize that they're,

[46:14] they need to bring the price down.

[46:16] So it's at $10,500.

[46:17] All right, what else is for sale on eBay?

[46:21] There's Game of Thrones, Ellie for $12,300.

[46:24] Again, this just goes to show.

[46:26] It's like, there's just some of these

[46:27] in named prices on eBay,

[46:28] but what I like to do is this.

[46:31] I never look at like highest price

[46:32] because you can ask whatever you want from a machine.

[46:35] Doesn't mean you're gonna get it.

[46:37] I think the true indication of where the value is

[46:40] or where the deals are on eBay

[46:42] is if you search for Pimball and you search for bids.

[46:48] You search for items that are actually being bid on

[46:50] and you look for items that have a bunch of bids

[46:54] and those are things that like, you know,

[46:56] people see the value in and someone's gonna buy it.

[46:58] Someone's gonna own it.

[47:00] And I think this is good too in comparison

[47:04] to that individual asking for $3,000

[47:07] for Spider-Man that pin, okay?

[47:08] Because we get lost in this world

[47:11] and a lot of us get lost in the world of new inbox.

[47:15] We get lost in the world of high-end pinball machines

[47:18] of collectible machines.

[47:19] And I think what happens to all of us

[47:22] who are stuck in that space is we start to lose reality.

[47:27] We lose touch with pinball machine

[47:30] supposed to be something that you step up to

[47:33] and you flip and you have fun

[47:35] and it's not supposed to be something that

[47:37] financially cripples you.

[47:39] It's not supposed to be the major asset in your home.

[47:43] It's not supposed to be something that

[47:45] you have to save up months to get the experience

[47:48] of a pinball machine.

[47:49] It was never supposed to be that.

[47:51] It was supposed to be something that just took a few quarters

[47:54] and gave you a few minutes of entertainment

[47:56] and that's what pinball was always designed to be.

[47:59] And I think it's still refreshing to see

[48:02] when you turn away, when you turn your back,

[48:05] on all the new inbox nonsense.

[48:08] When you turn your back on Star Wars being $8,500

[48:12] for one game experience, you start to realize

[48:15] that there's another end of the spectrum.

[48:18] And at that other end of the spectrum

[48:21] are a bunch of games that are available

[48:23] for not a lot of money that provide probably equal amounts

[48:30] of fun than these super expensive titles

[48:33] that people are chasing after.

[48:35] There are also games that probably have more features in them.

[48:39] They probably have more creativity and innovation

[48:43] inside them because they were built during an error

[48:46] when every single pinball machine that came out

[48:49] had more experienced teams of people and companies

[48:54] that were making more money while making pinball,

[48:57] designing and developing these games.

[48:59] And I've been a victim of this,

[49:01] of seeing pinball only through the lens of the new inbox

[49:04] and what's currently in the marketplace.

[49:07] And I've seen what it's done to all of us

[49:10] who have lived in that space is we've spent so much money

[49:15] and the fun we've gotten out of that spend

[49:21] has not delivered because we all know that

[49:26] it just shouldn't be that much.

[49:27] And you can have pinball fun for a lot less.

[49:31] And so if you go on eBay and you look at the items

[49:33] that people are actually bidding on

[49:36] and would I rather spend $3,000 on Spider-Man the pin

[49:39] or 32 people have bid on Rocky and Bullwinkle

[49:44] and that is condition Rocky and Bullwinkle.

[49:46] And it's right now it's at $1,675.

[49:52] There's a back to the future pin with 38 bids

[49:54] at $1,525.

[49:58] There's a Data East Simpsons machine at $1,500.

[50:02] That 32 people are currently bidding on.

[50:04] There's a Baywatch pinball machine by Sega

[50:07] that for $1,325, that 29 people are bidding on.

[50:14] You know, there's also a white water pinball topper

[50:18] without the dome, just the original water foil,

[50:21] waterfall foil with 13 bids right now for $445.

[50:26] Just for the half of the topper on white water.

[50:30] And so in conclusion people, in conclusion on this podcast,

[50:34] I think I wanna say that pinball is a crazy hobby.

[50:39] It's a crazy hobby.

[50:40] It's a non-essential toy that makes some people pay $50,000

[50:45] for a King Kong and some people will pay $1,500

[50:51] for a back to the future.

[50:52] And it's still the same fundamental device,

[50:55] the same fundamental toy.

[50:58] It's like a watch, right?

[51:00] All watches just tell time.

[51:01] All pinball machines just play pinball.

[51:04] Now, there's so many variations

[51:06] and there's so many different things

[51:07] that can make something worth so much

[51:09] and something worth so little.

[51:11] But at the end of the day, you know,

[51:14] it's a hobby that's just, it's fun to be a part of.

[51:17] And I think we need to remove some of the cancerous members

[51:21] of the hobby that are on the forums all day long,

[51:24] doing nothing then, then, then misdirecting people,

[51:28] then making people lose money

[51:30] and then trying to pretend like they're the leaders of justice.

[51:34] And you know, I think health should be off.

[51:35] I think you should take,

[51:36] I think you should have it his own self-imposed break.

[51:41] And we have so many pinball machines for sale.

[51:44] I mean, sometimes it's shocking to me

[51:45] when you look at how many pinball machines

[51:48] are up on the marketplace at any given time, is incredible.

[51:52] Like almost every single machine

[51:54] that you want to buy is available to buy in good condition.

[51:58] And I think it also speaks to the real sort of like

[52:02] underbelly of the hobby is that every game gets boring,

[52:07] is that every one eventually wants something new,

[52:10] is that there is just a natural fatigue

[52:13] and that maybe collecting these big, expensive toys

[52:18] isn't really that satisfying at the end of the day

[52:24] because we know that we're just gonna want something different.

[52:28] And I think what all of us would be,

[52:30] so we'd all benefit is that when you want a new game,

[52:34] why does it have to be a new inbox game, right?

[52:37] How many people out there have probably never really

[52:41] experienced Baywatch or back to the future?

[52:47] And if they owned it for a few months and enjoyed it,

[52:49] and beat it, and moved on from it,

[52:52] much, much easier to do and probably much more fun

[52:57] to shuffle around a $1,500 machine

[53:00] than spending $8,500 and then trying to sell it used.

[53:04] And then worried about keeping it in pristine condition

[53:07] because it's brand new.

[53:08] And I'm starting to change my tune.

[53:12] I think there's a lot of fun to be had.

[53:15] A lot more fun to be had.

[53:18] When you stop thinking you just need to have these like,

[53:20] Ellie's that like there's 800 of them

[53:24] and there's no different features.

[53:26] And you know, when you look at Pimball during the time

[53:29] when there was no such thing as an Ellie,

[53:31] there was no such thing as a premium.

[53:33] They just made the best damn Rocky and Bullwinkle pen they could.

[53:37] They made the best damn Adams family pen they could.

[53:40] They made one version of Medieval Manus.

[53:42] You know, nowadays if they made Medieval Manus

[53:44] to be like, this one has a gold castle

[53:47] and this one's got like a pink dragon.

[53:50] And because of that, it's another $3,000.

[53:53] That's where we're at right now and it's fucking stupid.

[53:58] And I'm getting tired of it.

[53:59] I will still collect ultra rare machines.

[54:02] You wanna know my story what I'm into?

[54:04] I have no room.

[54:06] You will only see super rare games enter into my home

[54:11] because I can go play everything else out on location.

[54:15] Everything.

[54:16] I have access to almost every single new game that comes out.

[54:19] So I want people to walk in my home

[54:21] and play something that they can't play out on location.

[54:25] So if you ask yourself,

[54:26] what do you think Canadian's gonna get next?

[54:28] I can guarantee you it's not something you can go play

[54:32] out on location.

[54:33] All right, and there's not many games like that, right?

[54:36] There's like just you could count them on one hand.

[54:38] All right, but that's what I like.

[54:40] And you might think I'm an idiot

[54:43] for collecting those kinds of games.

[54:45] I think, you know, I might think someone's an idiot

[54:47] who just has a row of all new unboxed turns.

[54:50] So that's episode 158.

[54:53] I know I went off on a little bit of a tangent,

[54:55] but I woke up and I wanted to do a pinball podcast.

[54:58] And I hope you enjoy it.

[54:59] I hope you like it.
