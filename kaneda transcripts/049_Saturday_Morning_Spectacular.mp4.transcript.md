[00:00] All right, we're alive now.

[00:04] And try not to mess this up.

[00:05] We got sound now.

[00:07] We got conversation about pinball.

[00:11] How's everybody doing?

[00:12] I'm doing good.

[00:13] I feel good.

[00:13] I just got back from the gym.

[00:15] Thank you for asking.

[00:16] I think that's important.

[00:17] I think working out before you do anything pinball related

[00:24] is the way to live life people.

[00:26] What's up Lord Ola?

[00:28] How's everybody doing?

[00:30] I got to get a new cable.

[00:31] It keeps unplugging on this damn microphone.

[00:33] That's my issue.

[00:35] This happened before.

[00:36] I feel like they make these cables extra cheap.

[00:39] Let's let everybody know in the chat where to go

[00:41] on Facebook, where to go.

[00:43] Happy Saturday morning everybody.

[00:45] New pin week, always fun.

[00:48] Always fun to see a new game.

[00:49] We got a lot to talk about.

[00:51] A lot to talk about in the world of pinball.

[00:55] Oh, let's see.

[00:57] Let's tell everybody.

[00:58] Come on.

[00:59] Come on in.

[01:04] We live.

[01:07] All right.

[01:10] I feel like Facebook, the way the algorithm works,

[01:12] it's annoying.

[01:14] You're like, they won't show your fans everything.

[01:17] How's everybody doing?

[01:18] Good morning everybody.

[01:20] I've been up since five in the morning.

[01:23] Give you guys a little rundown of morning day,

[01:26] canate.

[01:27] Five in the morning, wake up, take a hot bath.

[01:32] Got to be honest.

[01:33] Red pin side, red Facebook.

[01:36] Watch the D&D videos again.

[01:38] I want to just get a refresher on the entire game.

[01:42] I then had to wake up at 6.30.

[01:46] Killian came downstairs, put on Paw Patrol.

[01:50] And then at 6.30, I also wake up baby Cassian

[01:54] and feed him nine ounces of milk.

[01:57] Stays up to 8.30, made breakfast for Killian,

[02:00] cleaned the kitchen, and then I did a podcast

[02:04] from basically eight o'clock to 8.30,

[02:08] then edited the show quickly, got it up

[02:10] when the did Jim.

[02:11] And here we are now.

[02:12] Nonstop.

[02:14] Nonstop making pinball content for everybody out there.

[02:17] I hope you enjoy it.

[02:18] I enjoy making it.

[02:20] I enjoy making it.

[02:22] I think there is no other community,

[02:25] quite like the Canada community, the consistency

[02:28] by which we talk about stuff.

[02:29] We don't show anything.

[02:32] You don't see me put in distributor emails.

[02:35] I see some of these content creators.

[02:36] It's like, are they in the back pocket of distributors

[02:40] or what?

[02:41] Like, are they getting kickbacks again?

[02:42] Is that started up again?

[02:45] You know, like, oh, man, I don't understand it.

[02:47] I don't understand it.

[02:50] At least let everybody know if that's the case.

[02:59] Wait, went so hard.

[03:03] Let's see.

[03:04] Walt Wood's reaction video.

[03:07] Yeah, it was really funny.

[03:09] I'd never even seen that guy make videos before,

[03:11] but look, I'll say this.

[03:15] We need more people like Walt just going off.

[03:21] And I don't think it's never going to be my platform to do that.

[03:26] It's just not my style, but it's awesome.

[03:30] And it's fun to see people reacting that way.

[03:34] And I look, we all should be getting a good laugh

[03:36] out of all of these overpriced toys.

[03:40] And these companies desires to get us

[03:42] to make silly financial decisions.

[03:46] It's interesting.

[03:48] I think if you listen to my podcast this morning,

[03:51] and it's free for everybody, I'm going to post it here now.

[03:55] I just want to make sure everybody understands

[03:57] that you can listen to this even if you're not

[03:59] a member of the Canadian club.

[04:01] Please share it with your buddies.

[04:03] I think it's a great way to get your friends to join

[04:06] Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[04:08] Just share this with them and say, hey, like, I think you'd

[04:11] really enjoy this guy talks about pinball two to three times

[04:14] a week.

[04:16] And it's going to work well.

[04:19] I don't know why people are like, oh, they're mad

[04:20] that I'm on YouTube.

[04:21] Why?

[04:22] What's wrong with here?

[04:24] What's wrong with being here versus Facebook?

[04:26] I get that people want me to be on Facebook,

[04:28] but I don't know.

[04:30] I might go back to Facebook.

[04:31] I've even figured out how to monetize it here.

[04:35] And that sucks because I'm actually losing a lot of money.

[04:40] I use not a lot of money.

[04:41] I mean, I've never made a lot of money doing any of this,

[04:44] but I'm losing some money, like a few hundred bucks a month,

[04:47] not being on Facebook because of Facebook stars.

[04:51] And I'm not, I don't know.

[04:52] I tried to monetize this.

[04:54] I requested it for them to allow me to be monetized.

[04:59] And I don't know if they approved it or not.

[05:00] I don't think so.

[05:01] I still don't see it.

[05:03] I'm mad you're not on my space.

[05:06] So there is a link to the podcast, everybody.

[05:08] Please share it with your friends.

[05:09] And let's get more people in the community

[05:13] and listening to Canadian pinball podcasts.

[05:16] A lot of, a lot of thoughts, right, on D&D.

[05:20] A lot of thoughts on D&D.

[05:21] I've been thinking more about it.

[05:23] I've been thinking about the efforts Stern put into the game.

[05:27] To summarize what I said on my show this morning,

[05:31] not, I'm not going to give as much detail,

[05:33] but this is the greatest, one of the greatest mechs Stern has ever made.

[05:38] And they have to be applauded for that.

[05:42] And this game embarrasses on a mech and a toy level

[05:47] and a theme integration level, games like Avatar,

[05:50] games like John Wick, games like even JAWS really.

[05:53] I mean, the shark, imagine the shark did that.

[05:55] Imagine if the shark was much more interactive

[05:59] and much more complex.

[06:03] Imagine how much cooler it would be to battle JAWS

[06:08] if he had a lot more life in him.

[06:10] You know, right?

[06:11] It's not just like a rubber ducky popping up.

[06:14] So I think the takeaway I have on this game

[06:17] is that you Stern pinball is putting more into mechanisms

[06:25] and creativity.

[06:27] And obviously this stuff is harder to engineer

[06:31] and it's more expensive to incorporate,

[06:34] but prices are really high.

[06:36] And so I don't think we're there yet.

[06:39] I don't think we're there yet where the value in the game

[06:43] is worth the money they're asking for the stuff right now.

[06:47] But I do think that there's a lot to like

[06:50] about what's in this game.

[06:51] I don't find it any better than the T-Rex.

[06:53] Well, here's the thing Keith, you don't bash the T-Rex.

[06:56] It's not as dynamic as the T-Rex.

[06:59] The T-Rex is cool, don't get me wrong.

[07:01] But I think this is even cooler.

[07:03] And that's good.

[07:04] Like it's taking nothing away from the T-Rex.

[07:07] The pro is a lot of value.

[07:08] You know, it's funny.

[07:09] I forgot to mention this on my show.

[07:11] I'll mention it now.

[07:12] When they went over all three models,

[07:15] did you notice how they purposely sandbag the pro?

[07:19] And they're like, well, on the pro

[07:20] that you do some fun stuff too.

[07:22] And it's like, actually it almost let you do everything.

[07:26] Doesn't the pro have the dungeon entrance or not?

[07:31] Does it? I don't know.

[07:33] Isn't a dragon's fire supposed to hurt you not help you?

[07:37] I mean, yeah, yeah.

[07:39] I mean, I don't know.

[07:41] You know, I don't know.

[07:42] I don't know if like when it,

[07:44] when it dragons fires balls at you,

[07:46] is it, is that how it gives you multiple ball?

[07:49] So, okay, so the dungeon entrance

[07:52] does not exist in the pro.

[07:55] Okay, so no dungeon entrance and no dragon firing balls at you.

[08:01] Look, I don't think, I don't know.

[08:04] Like, it's not a huge loss?

[08:07] It's not a huge loss.

[08:08] The dragon still does stuff.

[08:10] Still moves a little bit.

[08:12] I think up and down.

[08:13] But overall, my feelings on D&D is they,

[08:20] this is an incredible, incredible world under glass.

[08:24] And I think they really nailed the theme integration.

[08:27] I think they really showed a lot more creativity

[08:30] and passion in this game than they have in previous games.

[08:33] I think it's a theme though that most people don't want.

[08:38] I don't think it's like a huge turn off,

[08:40] but I think it's gonna be harder to get into a D&D

[08:45] than it is to get into Godzilla, right?

[08:48] You didn't all want Godzilla.

[08:50] You didn't all want Iron Maiden.

[08:52] You didn't all want, I'm trying to think of another game

[08:55] that, you know, food fighters.

[08:56] I just think it's gonna be harder to get into this theme

[08:59] for a lot of you.

[09:01] Because I think the code is gonna get quickly

[09:05] very D&D-like and very nerdy.

[09:08] And for some of you that'll be very appealing.

[09:12] But I think for a lot of you, it might be a turn off.

[09:17] So, but again, I overall,

[09:21] I think we have to be very happy

[09:23] with Stern-Pimball's creativity in this game.

[09:27] Very happy.

[09:29] I think they've made some weird decisions

[09:31] on the art packages of the game.

[09:33] I don't like the art packages.

[09:35] I think the Ellie is the worst of the three.

[09:39] And as I mentioned, I think the red armor is atrocious

[09:42] and I think it looks pretty atrocious next to the art colors

[09:48] and I just don't like it.

[09:49] Like it should have had.

[09:52] And I mean, it should have had dungeons and dragons

[09:56] should have had brass-plated armor.

[10:01] Like brass against like red dragons and knights and wizards

[10:06] and it should have popped.

[10:09] And they need to start making these Ellie's

[10:13] look much better than they do.

[10:16] And I think the Ellie on this game to me is like an easy pass.

[10:21] And I would have loved to have seen

[10:23] like a gold brass-plated D&D

[10:25] that looked a lot more timeless and beautiful.

[10:29] Instead, I don't like what they did.

[10:32] And I think now, you know, if you don't really need an Ellie

[10:36] and I don't think the Ellie's mean anything

[10:38] and I don't think the Ellie is even like a good flex

[10:40] because the translate's ugly.

[10:42] I think the premium is way cooler with the dragon

[10:45] on the side that gold dragon.

[10:47] I think someone who powder coats a premium's armor

[10:51] and saves themselves, I mean, you're saving yourself

[10:54] more than $3,000.

[10:56] Think about that for a minute.

[10:57] And you're gonna be able to put in inner art blades

[11:00] and get a topper and do the armor, gold-plated

[11:05] for much cheaper than a stern Ellie.

[11:07] I just think like that's the problem I see

[11:12] with the stern three-tier model now,

[11:15] which was always predicated on the Ellie being

[11:19] a take my money now, gain that everybody wanted

[11:23] to get their hands on.

[11:24] Even if you didn't want to keep it,

[11:26] you wanted to get your hands on a stern Ellie

[11:28] because of what an Ellie signified.

[11:32] And those days are over.

[11:34] And so as I see the, I don't think the D&D Ellie is gonna,

[11:38] I don't think they're gonna sell this game out.

[11:41] I don't, I think Ellie's are gonna be waiting in boxes.

[11:44] They'll make all 740, but getting one won't be hard.

[11:48] It'll be a 10,000 game

[11:51] by the time King Kong comes out in four months.

[11:55] And that's it.

[11:56] But doesn't take anything away from the game.

[12:00] Would you consolidate model tiers is what Colin said.

[12:05] Colin no, no, but 740's just too many.

[12:10] See, I would have actually made like just 250 D&D Ellie's.

[12:16] I just think the way they're doing the Ellie number,

[12:21] because think about it like this.

[12:22] It's like you're making more Ellie's of this game

[12:24] than Ghostbusters, more Ellie's of this game than Batman,

[12:29] more Ellie's of this game heck then,

[12:31] even Metallica Ellie.

[12:33] And I just find that to be wishful thinking

[12:38] and it's not working out.

[12:39] And that's the thing is like because there's 740 of them,

[12:44] it just doesn't feel like the demand's even close to that.

[12:48] So yeah, at Pinball Valley, I agree.

[12:50] Like I think 500 should just be the number on everything

[12:54] regardless of popularity and just be okay

[12:59] with certain games being like a frenzy.

[13:02] You want there to be that.

[13:04] You want there to be a feeding frenzy

[13:06] to get your hands on an L and L.E.

[13:09] Make it mean something again.

[13:10] And again, like they're just like reluctant.

[13:13] Now they're all over the board with their L.E. numbers,

[13:15] which I actually don't like.

[13:21] Colin, I would consolidate the trippy voting.

[13:26] Look, everybody vote in the trippies.

[13:29] Colin, can you post the link here for everybody to go vote?

[13:33] I vote it live yesterday.

[13:35] I completely skipped over all the location play

[13:39] and I just thought there were some awards that...

[13:41] I don't know, I just got frozen

[13:44] of Best Pinball Community Member.

[13:46] I don't like that award.

[13:47] Talk about the most subjective award of all time

[13:51] where there's actually...

[13:52] It's weird when you do community member

[13:54] because what does that mean?

[13:56] Who's doing more for the community?

[13:59] And all those people I'm sure are doing great things

[14:02] for the Pinball community.

[14:03] So no one should lose in a category like that.

[14:08] It's best charitable pinball moment.

[14:10] What are we really...

[14:13] I don't know.

[14:14] I would just keep it more towards the games

[14:16] than the personalities that are actually trying to entertain

[14:20] and not do good.

[14:21] Because none of us are doing much good.

[14:23] Are we in the content space?

[14:27] If you win, will you go?

[14:29] Well, Pinball vibes.

[14:30] I'm not gonna know I won until the show itself.

[14:35] That's what's always fun about the trippies

[14:38] is they never tell you if you win.

[14:40] You find out live like everybody else.

[14:43] Ed Mara said,

[14:44] the Ellie is the same game except stuff you can add.

[14:48] Yeah, you know, look.

[14:50] Ed, the whole notion of what an Ellie should be,

[14:57] they had it perfect.

[15:00] Honestly, the best...

[15:01] The Halcyon days looking back on all of it.

[15:05] The Halcyon days were when Ellie's were 8,500

[15:10] and there was 500 at most.

[15:12] That was like the greatest.

[15:15] Everybody's games helped value.

[15:18] Everybody's games went up a little bit

[15:21] and some games went through the roof if they were amazing.

[15:25] You can't tell me that Stern's cost of making these things

[15:30] has increased this much.

[15:34] I'm sure their new factory is the issue

[15:37] and all the people working there

[15:40] and all the desks and mouths and families

[15:44] and square footage is like, we're paying for that.

[15:49] You know what I'm saying?

[15:49] We're paying for that expansion of Stern.

[15:52] But up until this game,

[15:55] we haven't really seen an expansion in creativity

[15:58] or an expansion in the physical stuff we love.

[16:02] And I think a lot of the expansion we've experienced

[16:05] has been inside or connected and software side of things.

[16:08] But even then, with all the expansion they've done,

[16:12] they're still releasing games code incomplete.

[16:17] So to me, that doesn't work.

[16:19] If you're going to charge us this much more

[16:22] and grow this much bigger,

[16:25] I don't want to see games code incomplete.

[16:29] I don't want to see X-Men launches ever again

[16:31] where people have to buy now

[16:34] and wait to see if the game gets good.

[16:37] That's not fair to anybody.

[16:39] And that's just gonna lose you customers.

[16:41] I know a lot of dudes who went in on X-Men O.E.

[16:46] And they're not happy.

[16:47] They're not happy.

[16:48] They've lost now three to $4,000.

[16:52] The game had promised, but now they're sad

[16:56] that it feels like it's not gonna go in the direction

[16:59] they wanted to.

[17:01] There's just frustrating fixes

[17:03] that aren't really fixing what's wrong with the game.

[17:06] They're just, you know, and they feel burned

[17:08] because now I can go get the same game they bought

[17:12] for $3,000 to $4,000 less.

[17:15] And a lot of cases gang new in box.

[17:18] A lot of these games are sitting new in box.

[17:19] You put 10K on the table at a distro

[17:23] and they're taking it for that X-Men O.E.

[17:30] Fusion said D&D-LE has no sex appeal.

[17:33] I don't like it.

[17:34] I think it's ugly.

[17:35] I think it's ugly.

[17:37] I think the translate is so weirdly the worst out of all them.

[17:43] And the pro translate is so much better with that dragon.

[17:46] It's just like weird.

[17:47] Like why, and you know why there,

[17:50] it almost feels like annoying why they're doing this.

[17:53] Is they're like, well, we need to sell more premiums

[17:56] and pros so let's not put the best on the L.E.

[18:00] I'm sorry, but the L.E.

[18:01] should be the game everyone fons over.

[18:04] It should be like Metallica, Ellie, Ghostbusters,

[18:07] Ellie, Batman, S.L.E.

[18:08] Like, Ellie's should have a level of like,

[18:14] like you shouldn't even have to explain

[18:17] why the L.E. is the one to get.

[18:19] It should just be that much nicer

[18:21] than the premium and the pro, okay?

[18:24] It just should be.

[18:26] Do you know on JAWS, Ellie,

[18:28] they were gonna do the illustrated translate

[18:31] and not the iconic movie poster?

[18:34] Like that's like the seriously stirring, like come on.

[18:38] Come on, these are like bone headed things

[18:39] that even consider.

[18:41] So let me read some of your stuff here we've got.

[18:44] It drives me nuts that the back box

[18:47] does not have the red molding.

[18:50] You're right.

[18:51] I don't understand that.

[18:53] Like the team molding on the back box,

[18:57] the curtains should match the drapes, right?

[19:00] It's like, you've got them.

[19:03] They've got the red, this would make sense.

[19:04] They've got the red team molding

[19:07] on the premium game and has black armor.

[19:11] And then they've got the freaking black team molding

[19:14] on the L.E. that has the red armor.

[19:16] And it's just these bone headed mistakes.

[19:20] Ah, Seth Davis knows I'll join the Stern Marketing Department

[19:25] as a consultant.

[19:27] Like I just think they need someone like me over there.

[19:30] I really do.

[19:32] I really do.

[19:34] You know, I know it would be hard to sort of

[19:37] put Canada into that mix, but man, they need someone like me.

[19:42] Just saying I've been doing it for almost 30 years now,

[19:44] 25 plus years.

[19:45] I know what I'm talking about here.

[19:47] I have a good eye for creativity too.

[19:48] I'm creative.

[19:49] That's what I do in marketing, I create it.

[19:52] Create stuff that people will get excited about.

[19:54] It's a fun job.

[19:58] Yeah, more, yeah, but common sense.

[20:01] Let me tell you something, Anthony, common sense

[20:02] is the hardest thing to have in all of business.

[20:05] All of business, right?

[20:08] Common sense.

[20:09] You know, it's funny, like in my company,

[20:10] they used to give us like two summer days, right?

[20:12] Two summer days, right?

[20:14] I might put this three months of summer.

[20:17] You know what I'm saying?

[20:18] They would give like a day off per month.

[20:21] You get one day off per month in the summer

[20:23] and you get two.

[20:25] And I'm like, but there's three months in summer.

[20:29] So why wouldn't you give everybody three?

[20:33] And once you start down a road of just kind of like

[20:37] a logical ways to process life and work,

[20:41] it doesn't, you know, people just lose a little faith.

[20:46] Like, you know, I say, oh, well, I see.

[20:48] I get it now.

[20:50] I want to thank the 110 people for being,

[20:51] did someone post a link to the trippy voting?

[20:55] Is everybody voting for Canada?

[21:00] I was disappointed that I'm not eligible

[21:02] for favorite pinball streamer.

[21:04] I think what's disappointing about that

[21:05] is I finished second in favorite pinball streamer

[21:09] of one year and third one year.

[21:11] So I don't understand how could I have finished

[21:14] second and third in streaming?

[21:17] And now I'm not eligible for streaming.

[21:20] I think that's a con.

[21:22] I think that's a mistake again.

[21:23] Like, what am I doing right now?

[21:25] I'm doing a stream about pinball, right?

[21:30] You've got people on there where the streams

[21:33] are not about gameplay.

[21:35] It's just like this, like, carry does this.

[21:37] He doesn't do gameplay.

[21:39] Todd Tucky does this.

[21:42] You know, so again, it's not a mistake.

[21:47] They obviously don't want Canada

[21:48] winning more than one award.

[21:49] I know.

[21:51] I know.

[21:52] Like Ian said, you and Zach Manier,

[21:56] the only people complaining about the Twippies,

[21:58] makes me feel nostalgic.

[22:01] No, they didn't have Zach,

[22:02] and they didn't have straight down the middle

[22:04] in like certain categories.

[22:05] I agree with Zach.

[22:07] I agree with Zach.

[22:08] I mean, it was just,

[22:09] and I think Colin changed,

[22:11] I think Colin and Zach spoke and they included it.

[22:16] I want to win all the awards, Colin,

[22:18] not just to all the awards.

[22:20] I should win Best Pinball Designer.

[22:22] Where's Best Pinball Fashion Sense?

[22:24] How come that's not an award?

[22:26] Best use of Best Pinball, you know,

[22:32] hedge multi-ball merchandise, right?

[22:35] Kacky shorts, Kacky shorts, cargo shorts.

[22:40] Yeah, everybody vote.

[22:41] Everybody vote.

[22:45] Best pinball memes.

[22:46] Best pin in front of window.

[22:48] That's my favorite one.

[22:51] So getting, you know, the overall sentiment

[22:54] around D&D and Evil Dead is this.

[22:58] I've said it on my show today that,

[23:01] I think we got two of the best theme in a graded games

[23:03] we've seen in a really long time.

[23:06] Unfortunately, they're based on themes

[23:09] that aren't really what people want.

[23:12] But the silver lining is the level of creativity

[23:17] going into both games.

[23:19] Has me really excited about what's down the road.

[23:22] I think both games, Evil Dead and D&D,

[23:28] you know, they're not gonna be easy to get.

[23:31] They're gonna be easy to get.

[23:33] Doesn't mean they're not good,

[23:34] but you know, they're targeting a much more niche fan base.

[23:37] Works a lot better for spooky than it does for Stern.

[23:41] You know, spooky pinball's model of one game,

[23:46] one art package, you know, one topper,

[23:50] one this one that, you know,

[23:51] I know there's an alternative topper for more money,

[23:53] but everyone who buys an Evil Dead

[23:56] is gonna have the same awesome looking game

[23:58] and they only have to sell 888,

[24:01] where it gets tricky for Stern.

[24:03] Stern can't really weather a lukewarm response

[24:08] to a cornerstone very well.

[24:11] And we've seen that, right?

[24:12] I think people are forgetting.

[24:13] You gotta go back and understand what Stern's done,

[24:18] try to do, and then we stop them from doing more of it,

[24:21] was their strategy was gonna be,

[24:25] whenever we have a lukewarm title,

[24:28] let's just rerun a new LE of a game people love.

[24:32] And that's why we got more Jurassic Park LEDs, more Elvira.

[24:36] And everybody's like, no, bro, you gotta stop that.

[24:39] Even the distros told them to stop,

[24:41] and that's why they had to pull back

[24:45] and make Godzilla 70th a premium and not an LE,

[24:48] it was supposed to be an LE.

[24:50] That was their strategy.

[24:52] Now what do they do, right?

[24:55] This is, I'm curious about this,

[24:57] because I don't see D&D like being enough

[25:01] to keep the Stern machine going for the next game,

[25:06] like the next four months until we get King Kong.

[25:10] I mean, there's a cornerstone every four months,

[25:13] like that's how it works.

[25:14] Like, Kong most likely will be out sometime in May.

[25:20] Now they may bring it out earlier to compete with Harry Potter,

[25:25] or they might let Potter have its moment.

[25:28] But do you really think that right now,

[25:33] there is a demand for more of any Stern machines right now,

[25:38] right? I feel like every game that you've ever wanted

[25:41] has been rerun 15,000 times.

[25:45] The only ones you want more of would be like a remastered kind

[25:49] of thing, like a tron or a ghost bus.

[25:52] I just don't see D&D keeping that machine going

[25:57] for the next three, four months.

[25:58] I just don't see the orders coming in,

[26:00] and then, you know, I don't think they can just run more

[26:03] Godzilla's or run more Elvira's or run more this or that.

[26:07] I think they're going to probably maybe do that.

[26:10] Ghostbusters between now and or tron right between now

[26:14] and Kong, I wouldn't be surprised if we see another remastered

[26:19] game to help keep the line going.

[26:24] So we'll see.

[26:26] We'll see.

[26:27] Because Stern, unlike Jersey Jack, Stern needs,

[26:30] like gang, by the way, can we just say for the record,

[26:34] how much better D&D is than Avatar?

[26:38] Like, can we actually, can we just state for the record

[26:42] how much better D&D is than Avatar?

[26:46] And Mark's side and nicest guy, he needs to step up.

[26:51] They need to step up.

[26:53] You know what I'm saying?

[26:54] Like Jersey Jack engineering, step up now.

[26:58] The, the, the Avatar's got no toys, like zero toys in it.

[27:02] Zero interactive toys in it.

[27:04] Zero, like I mean that, like zero, not one, not two,

[27:09] zero interactive toys that interact with the ball.

[27:14] I mean, so I mean, if I'm, if I'm Brett and, you know,

[27:19] and I'm Leonard and I'm Jack, Mark, Mark needs to step up.

[27:25] Mark needs to step up.

[27:27] And if the rumors true and Harry Potter's next and it's a wide body

[27:32] and we know Eric will throw everything in the kitchen sink

[27:34] into that game, it's gonna be, it's gonna be awesome

[27:38] to see what he does.

[27:40] Awesome.

[27:42] Okay, so we got a, a $2 plastic cube.

[27:47] Look, here's the thing, here's the thing.

[27:50] Don't knock toys that interact with the ball.

[27:55] I like the cube with the magnet.

[27:59] And I, the only thing I wish it did, I wish it had more,

[28:05] like the disappearing magnet, like in Todeon, right?

[28:09] Wouldn't that have been cool?

[28:11] Where if you don't hit it in time, the, you know,

[28:14] the, the magnet drops down and, and steals the ball from you,

[28:18] if you will.

[28:19] Because what happens now if you don't hit the ball in time?

[28:22] Does it drop, I think it might drop down.

[28:23] I'm not sure.

[28:24] I haven't, I haven't played the game.

[28:27] Like, gang, like for people being like, it's a magnet big,

[28:31] whoop, well, that's better than no magnet.

[28:34] Okay, I just want to remind you guys, is a magnet a toy?

[28:39] Yeah.

[28:40] A magnet is a toy that interacts with the ball.

[28:44] I consider a magnet to be a toy.

[28:47] You know what I'm saying?

[28:47] I just do.

[28:48] I, you might not, I do.

[28:50] I consider a magnet, if, I think a magnetized

[28:53] game play feature like magneto grabbing the ball and sling,

[29:00] that's, to me, that's a, a toy.

[29:03] Magneto's magnet grab is a toy area of the game.

[29:09] I think Lord of the Rings is a toy.

[29:13] I, I love magnets.

[29:14] I, I, I, you know, one of the things I always, I wish was so much

[29:19] cooler was the magnet sling on Ghostbusters, right?

[29:22] It's like, I, I thought they were going to design it in a way where the,

[29:26] the Ghost could take over the machine and throw the ball back and forth to

[29:30] each other and freeze it.

[29:32] You know, kind of like, like the, the, the, the Dracula game where the ball moves

[29:38] across.

[29:40] And it never really did anything cool with it like that.

[29:47] Gang, I, I think Avatar.

[29:49] I think Avatar is going to, a, a CE is going to be worth.

[29:57] I mean, it is beautiful, but it's, it's just,

[30:01] just a kind of boring game in my honest opinion.

[30:04] I, I think Avatar is going to be worth the CE is going to be worth

[30:09] $8,000 by the end of this year.

[30:12] I mean, I think you're going to have a $7,000 loss on the game.

[30:17] And, and, and look, the thing is like nobody's going to want the LE.

[30:23] Avatar, Ellie's are going to be worth about six.

[30:27] They'll sink down to G and R level.

[30:31] I don't, I think they're going to sell more CE's and Ellie's.

[30:34] I, I don't know anyone who's like bought an LE.

[30:36] I don't.

[30:38] Fran, she would stop brother.

[30:41] You know, I just, again, I think, I think Evil Dead and

[30:46] D and D.

[30:48] Wow, wait, wait more in than the Avatar.

[30:51] Now, look, Avatar looks better than, than, like the JJP platform.

[30:56] I think it, I think I want to, I want to articulate it like that.

[30:59] The JJP platform is still the nicest platform in all of Pimbal.

[31:04] Like their games just look better, just from a pure physical material thing.

[31:13] Like it's just better looking.

[31:16] Than anything else than anyone else's platform.

[31:19] I don't know why it's so hard for other companies to up the look of their platform.

[31:27] I don't know why.

[31:27] I don't know what the issue is there.

[31:29] Like why is it, is it, it's just wood and lights and, you know,

[31:35] I think some of it comes down to like the rad cows add a lot.

[31:40] I think, you know, the, the big screen obviously adds a lot, right?

[31:45] It's a very dynamic back box they have.

[31:49] And, you know, they look great.

[31:52] They look great.

[31:54] I also agree, agree, the flipper feel on Avatar does, does not feel as good as

[32:04] Elton John.

[32:06] And I'm not sure what the issue is.

[32:09] It just doesn't feel as good as Elton.

[32:12] I don't know what the issue is.

[32:13] I don't know.

[32:14] I'm not going to solve it here today.

[32:16] Uh, you know what I haven't seen because remember,

[32:21] like Avatar Ellie is the same game as the CE.

[32:26] And the games now been out.

[32:28] Are you ready for it?

[32:29] October, November, December, January.

[32:33] The game's been out for four months.

[32:35] And it pretty much launched code complete.

[32:39] In those four months, have you heard anybody who bought an avatar?

[32:45] Have you heard anybody say OMG, this moment in the pin is magical.

[32:52] I haven't heard anybody even articulate a single, a single, I hope my,

[33:02] I hope my computer doesn't restart in 15 minutes.

[33:04] We'll see.

[33:05] It might, I got this warning message.

[33:08] Um, it, I haven't seen anyone articulate a single,

[33:13] like thing or moment that they really gush about.

[33:20] And I think that's indicative of the kind of boring nature of the game.

[33:28] It's just like, yeah, I'm you to clips.

[33:31] Um, can a to got the American pinball lap.

[33:36] Yeah, like, man, um, do we think we're getting Cuphead?

[33:43] Let's go.

[33:44] Let's talk about some other stuff too.

[33:45] Do we think Cuphead's ever coming out?

[33:46] What do you guys think?

[33:47] I don't know.

[33:47] I don't know.

[33:49] Um, based on Ryan McQuade's post, I, it just doesn't sound good.

[33:53] It doesn't sound like he's in a good place.

[33:56] It doesn't sound like he's about to launch a pinball machine.

[33:59] And I feel, I feel bad for the guy.

[34:02] I did see that post that American pinball is now hiring line workers, right?

[34:10] That was a little strange to see.

[34:12] So I mean, clearly they're not done.

[34:14] So I don't know how these things add up.

[34:18] And I don't know what the future holds.

[34:20] But I know that the other companies that are firing off on all cylinders are just

[34:28] going to leave them behind in the dust and, and there's just no other way to look at it.

[34:33] So avatar cannot be saved by code.

[34:36] No, it's done.

[34:37] It's done.

[34:38] It's done.

[34:40] You know what I would love?

[34:42] If, if, if someone can make my dream come true, could Jersey Jack just stop being stupid

[34:48] and make toy story one?

[34:51] Right?

[34:52] Could they just, can they just make Andy's room version of toy story?

[34:55] Can someone make that?

[34:57] If, if Andy's room, if toy story one was made into a pinball machine, I would buy it

[35:04] right now.

[35:05] If it was just announced right now, I would put $15,000 down right now for a toy story one,

[35:10] C E.

[35:12] The fact that we're never going to get the right toy story pinball machine is criminal.

[35:17] No, I don't want a Buzz Lightyear pin.

[35:19] No, it doesn't work like I want, I want the story from toy story one recreated in pinball form.

[35:28] I don't want Buzz Lightyear.

[35:29] I don't want a generic story.

[35:32] I want Andy's room.

[35:35] Okay.

[35:36] What do you want?

[35:37] The bow peep.

[35:40] Anyway, I just, that's it.

[35:43] I want, I want the iconic stuff.

[35:47] You don't want a derivative version of the iconic stuff.

[35:51] That's how you end up with toy story four.

[35:53] It's not the iconic movie.

[35:56] The, even like the iconic characters are kind of buried in that movie, because it's about

[36:01] forky and Bonnie.

[36:03] It's not iconic.

[36:05] You know, I also don't think, as I think about Harry Potter, I wonder how they're going

[36:11] to handle this source material.

[36:14] What do you guys think?

[36:15] Do you think they're going to make Harry Potter based on all eight movies, right?

[36:23] Are there eight movies, or is it going to be based on the first few movies?

[36:27] How do you think they're going to handle it?

[36:30] Also, if you guys love the Saturday Mornings spectacular,

[36:34] and you're not a member of the Canadian club, and you want to just send a donation,

[36:40] see, I need to get like super chats going.

[36:42] So, so people can donate here and be recognized here.

[36:46] And I'm going to look into that, but I don't know why it won't let me do it yet.

[36:51] I'm going to figure this out.

[36:53] And, but if you want to send any donations, just letting you know, because people

[36:58] use to send stars, you can just send any donations to you to PayPal,

[37:03] Canadian pinball as it sounds, Canadian pinball at gmail.com on PayPal.

[37:09] And I would highly, you know, appreciate anything and all things.

[37:15] As I spend 6,000 a month on daycare and spend so much free time doing this,

[37:20] but it is what it is.

[37:21] It is what it is.

[37:22] It is what it is.

[37:23] Oh, I always say like if I was talking about something with a broader audience,

[37:28] I'd be driving a Lamborghini, not a GR86.

[37:31] Anyway.

[37:34] So, do you guys like, let's talk about the rumor that the next title from

[37:42] Barrel's a Fun is Dune.

[37:43] Now, I reached out to one of my contacts over there and I got a little bit of like,

[37:47] oh, Dune, you know, it was almost like, I wish Dune would be a great property.

[37:51] I don't know.

[37:52] I don't know.

[37:53] I got a little non-answer answer.

[37:56] I don't want it to be Dune.

[38:00] And because I like, I don't want it to be the new movies.

[38:04] And I also, the original one is like so bad.

[38:07] It's good kind of movie.

[38:08] It's like, I don't, I just don't, again, this is like, this is just me being personal.

[38:14] I just don't want a Dune pinball machine and I just wouldn't go there.

[38:20] I think you'd have better luck with space balls.

[38:24] You know what I'm saying?

[38:25] I just, I don't know.

[38:27] I just don't want a Dune pinball machine.

[38:29] I would rather have Superman 78.

[38:33] I would rather have original like 18 or Wonder Woman.

[38:36] I just, again, I think Dune isn't something that like we want.

[38:43] I, the majority people want.

[38:46] I would much rather have Fifth Element, much rather have Matrix.

[38:50] It's Superman 76.

[38:53] I would just much rather have that stuff.

[38:55] You know, and look, I get that some of you might love Dune.

[39:01] I just don't see it as a take my money now, especially the new one.

[39:05] They're not going to get the new one because no one's going to be able to afford Zendaya and Timothy Chamale,

[39:12] whatever, Chamalama Ding Dong.

[39:13] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[39:15] And like, and I don't know.

[39:17] Like the Dune TV show, you know what, this is a good indication of it all.

[39:22] The Dune TV show on HBO is bombing.

[39:25] Like it's bombing.

[39:27] Like nobody's watching it.

[39:29] It doesn't have that desire to go deeper into, into the universe at all.

[39:36] Like I'm serious.

[39:37] Like even Squid Game, man.

[39:39] Like nobody, Squid Game 2, it's been three years.

[39:43] Nobody cares.

[39:44] The reviews are terrible.

[39:46] Nobody's watching it.

[39:48] Nobody's talking about it.

[39:50] And, you know, just like that, right?

[39:52] You could argue, Squid Game would be an amazing theme, you know, because it's so popular.

[39:56] Yeah, our culture now is very fickle.

[39:59] And that's why you kind of want to aim towards stuff that has a long lasting cult following.

[40:07] Like big trouble in Little China.

[40:09] Like Akira.

[40:11] Like Bloodsport.

[40:13] Like Total Recall.

[40:15] Like Predator.

[40:18] Right?

[40:19] I mean, you can't tell me that spooky pinball would not sell more blood sport pins than evil dead.

[40:29] If you made Bloodsport, Bloodsport made more money at the movie theater than evil dead.

[40:35] More 40 to 60 year old men are familiar with Bloodsport.

[40:41] It is still Von Dom's best movie ever.

[40:44] And it's just perfect for pinball.

[40:46] The whole theme of it is perfect for pinball.

[40:50] I'm telling you right now, Bloodsport sells out 888 units.

[40:57] You know, well, the thing is this Josh is like Arnold movies are almost unattainable because of how expensive he is.

[41:04] But you could get the rights to Bloodsport and the clips and all you could get.

[41:08] See, that's something that they could get the rights.

[41:13] Avatar makes a lot more money than any of those themes.

[41:16] Yeah, but the thing is this James is Avatar doesn't have real fandom.

[41:22] James, you understand this point like Avatar doesn't have a cult following.

[41:29] You didn't you're not watching Avatar 100.

[41:32] I've seen Bloodsport 100 times.

[41:34] I've seen Big Trouble in the little China 100 times.

[41:37] I've seen back to the future 100 times.

[41:39] Is anybody watching Avatar more than twice?

[41:44] You know, the first one I saw like four or five times in the theater because of how much of a spectacle the I'm X 3D was.

[41:52] We don't even talk about this game.

[41:53] How are you going to make an Avatar pinball machine?

[41:57] A movie that is famous for its 3D.

[42:01] The fact that Jersey Jack didn't have any 3D mode in Avatar pinball is quite possibly the greatest

[42:13] fail of

[42:16] theme integration of all time.

[42:18] Those movies are famous for being in 3D.

[42:22] Did anyone ever see Avatar in 2D in the theater?

[42:25] It's terrible in 2D.

[42:29] So like, and the fact that Jaws has 3D modes and not even Avatar just sad.

[42:37] And again, it makes me wonder what the heck is Jersey Jack thinking.

[42:43] That this is good enough.

[42:44] No, it's not.

[42:45] It's not good enough.

[42:50] Greatest fail aside from French.

[42:52] You don't like my you don't like my winter hat.

[42:56] It's nice and warm.

[42:59] Oh,

[43:02] I'm my computer might restart in five minutes people.

[43:05] If it does, I'll sign back on how's that sound.

[43:10] I got this countdown clock.

[43:12] Um, so you know,

[43:17] how's everyone anyone like can I ask you as a question?

[43:19] We've got I think I can do a poll here.

[43:21] Let me see.

[43:22] Let me see here.

[43:23] I think I can do a poll.

[43:26] Do do do do top chat.

[43:28] Let's see.

[43:30] I thought I could throw up a poll.

[43:32] Let's see.

[43:38] I'm sure.

[43:41] Time should let's see.

[43:47] Hold on.

[43:52] I can do that.

[43:54] Okay, here we go.

[43:56] Start a poll.

[43:58] Did you did you order a D and D?

[44:07] Okay, let's start the poll.

[44:12] I'm curious.

[44:14] What people say we have got we've got a hundred and thirty people here,

[44:18] which is not a bad amount of people.

[44:23] And I'm curious what the poll results will be.

[44:30] And let's keep it going for a little bit, but I love for everyone just to vote.

[44:35] And then I want to know.

[44:37] Kelly, you order every Ellie.

[44:39] Kelly, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not making fun of you, Kelly.

[44:45] I understand why you knew McCray got one.

[44:47] I get it.

[44:50] Don't understand why you didn't wait.

[44:51] You know, Kelly, you know this hobby well enough, Kelly.

[44:55] That's what always I get it.

[44:58] I get it.

[44:58] I get it.

[44:59] Kelly's just in on every new Ellie.

[45:01] Anybody be down for a Randy Machuiman Savage pin?

[45:06] No, that's too much macho.

[45:09] It's too much macho, Franchi.

[45:10] That's too much.

[45:14] I don't know.

[45:15] We have 87% of people are saying no right now.

[45:20] 13 said yes.

[45:23] All right.

[45:23] So what's 13?

[45:26] 13% of one 30 is old about 10 machines.

[45:32] I like the spooky and barrels of fun.

[45:39] Give you.

[45:41] Oh, yeah.

[45:48] All right.

[45:48] So most people have not ordered D&D.

[45:53] But that's not a terrible number.

[45:55] I mean, you know,

[45:58] you get to a few thousand audience and you've got almost every

[46:01] Ellie sold.

[46:04] And also shame on shame on most of you.

[46:08] Only 53 people voted out of 126.

[46:11] Like, come on guys, get with it.

[46:13] Are you I mean, maybe some people are watching from their car.

[46:15] Who knows?

[46:20] 90% sold was that mean?

[46:23] It doesn't make it 90% of what is sold?

[46:27] Joseph Joseph, that doesn't make any sense.

[46:30] 90% of D&D is not sold.

[46:34] I don't I you just you just can't make up numbers like that.

[46:37] Joseph in in Canada's house and get away with it.

[46:41] 90% of D&Ds have not sold.

[46:47] I'm 90% likely to buy it.

[46:49] Oh, you're, oh, you're 90% sold on getting it.

[46:52] Okay.

[46:55] All right.

[46:55] Well, that's different.

[46:56] Well, I'm telling you the 10% inside your head,

[47:00] should tell you to wait and see and save thousands of dollars.

[47:04] I'm not saying don't buy it.

[47:07] Just don't buy it yet.

[47:09] Gang, listen to me.

[47:11] If you don't buy it now, you can still buy it and save $3,000.

[47:19] Why wouldn't you do that?

[47:22] Like, that's what I don't get you.

[47:23] I want to play it now.

[47:25] Why the code's not going to be done for six months.

[47:28] By the time the code is done, you can then go buy the game for $3,000 less.

[47:33] How many times we have to see Stern games go that route and you can't wait six months.

[47:41] And then by the time six months goes, you've got King Kong, you've got Harry Potter,

[47:45] you've got the next barrels of fun game.

[47:48] You got spooky evil dead shipping.

[47:50] You've got Alice's adventures in Wonderland shipping.

[47:54] It's no brainer.

[47:56] No brainer.

[47:57] Wait.

[48:03] Also, the more we wait, gang, the more Stern's going to have to lower prices.

[48:09] You know, they know this is the only way forward.

[48:13] It doesn't work.

[48:14] This model just can't, they can't, they can't sustain it like this for much longer.

[48:20] You could feel it.

[48:20] You could feel their, you could feel their sort of like, uh, they're not used to this.

[48:26] Coin taker is the best distro ever says, ranchy.

[48:38] You know, my favorite distros and I get no kickbacks.

[48:45] I get no anything.

[48:49] I don't even like Melissa half the time supposed to hold me a game.

[48:52] My favorite distros, you know who they are.

[48:56] And it's just because I know them personally coin taker, Chris and Melissa,

[49:01] probably number one.

[49:02] I've got most of my games from Chris and Melissa.

[49:05] Number two, Mike, it automated.

[49:09] Mike's amazing.

[49:10] Nice.

[49:10] Is guy ever.

[49:11] No games just gets a game for you.

[49:13] No shenanigans love Mike, it automated.

[49:16] He needs to update his website.

[49:18] Looks like it's from 1997.

[49:19] I don't even know like he's late.

[49:21] He's still he's still marketing like it's 1997.

[49:24] But the nicest guy ever.

[49:26] And and then Joe Newhart at pinball star.

[49:29] Those are my go to's.

[49:31] And then I try to order from each based on like what they are known for.

[49:38] So like stern, obviously Mike and coin taker are my two goes to Joe doesn't,

[49:43] Joe doesn't sell stern machines.

[49:46] Joe, obviously I like to, you know, order my JJP's through him.

[49:51] And if you know, if it's a spooky title, I like to give him love

[49:56] on, you know, on the on the companies he covers off on frequently.

[50:00] I don't even know if that was a rights, if that was even a sentence, I just said.

[50:06] Yeah.

[50:06] No, look, gang, and that's nothing against.

[50:09] It's nothing against any other distributor.

[50:12] You know what I'm saying?

[50:12] I just don't buy from other distributors.

[50:15] It's nothing personal.

[50:16] Of course, Zack's got a huge customer base, Zack and Greg at flipping out.

[50:22] Of course, you know, mad pinball's got his.

[50:25] His, his crutch rents got his audience, JJ's got his audience.

[50:29] Everyone's got their distro, you know, I don't mean nitros got his, his

[50:34] audience.

[50:35] I don't tend to think you stay in the distro business very long if you're

[50:41] bad.

[50:42] You know, I mean, I don't think you're around for a long time in the sales

[50:48] business.

[50:50] If you're not likeable, if you don't deliver consistently and you don't

[50:55] help your customers have a good experience, right?

[50:57] I mean, that is the job.

[50:59] So it's weird.

[51:01] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[51:02] Like someone giving love to their distro isn't throwing shade on other

[51:08] distros.

[51:09] I just want to say that.

[51:12] Now that being said, that'll that being said, some of y'all content creators

[51:18] are just annoyingly.

[51:21] Like the way you promote your distro buddies is nauseating.

[51:28] I'll give you an example, like a retro raft, right?

[51:31] Put up a video about D&D saying, there's a whole might be your game and

[51:35] buy your game from, from flipping out, right?

[51:37] And he is like, he lists, he lists Zach and Greg's email and the number,

[51:43] like, and I just wrote in the comments, why are you giving both of their

[51:47] emails?

[51:48] Like it's not enough to just give that you got it.

[51:51] Like why don't just give the entire cell phone number of everyone who works.

[51:56] It's just like, but it's also like you're a content creator.

[51:58] Like why are you like again?

[52:00] Again, I, I'm not sure what's happening now.

[52:06] All right.

[52:06] I'm not sure what's happening now.

[52:08] But there was a time when content creators were getting kickbacks for

[52:15] referrals.

[52:16] And that's why they were a hyping games and be so adamant on where to go buy it.

[52:25] Now look, I don't care if people do referrals and help their friends promote

[52:30] their businesses.

[52:32] All I ask if you're doing that is that your transparent about that,

[52:38] that you're getting money per referral.

[52:42] Let me tell you how much I've gotten from referring people to coin taker,

[52:47] to Joe, to Mike zero.

[52:50] I get zero kickbacks, zero anything.

[52:54] Nobody sponsors anything I do.

[52:57] They also give me zero off.

[53:00] Like you know, you guys know that who's Don's distros.

[53:05] Is it mad, Pimbal?

[53:06] You know that that guy's kicking Don games for less than MSRP.

[53:12] Right. He's getting it.

[53:12] And that's and again, and then once you go down that road where you're getting

[53:18] a discount and you're like not paying with everybody else's and then you're

[53:25] giving reviews and feedback on something you got at a discounted price.

[53:31] It starts to like get a little bit into that gray area of how much should

[53:38] be transparent and how much is authentic.

[53:42] And you know, in the end, none of it matters.

[53:47] Like nobody's making much money off of any of this.

[53:52] So you know, just who cares really?

[53:55] I mean, I just it's just something I do notice.

[53:59] I do notice.

[53:59] And then when people and then when people like complain about $5 a month for

[54:06] the amount of content I'm throwing up there.

[54:08] It's like you just know that when you donate $5 or more,

[54:14] you're donating to someone who is absolutely not in the back pocket of any

[54:20] distro, any any company, any designer.

[54:24] I don't have any friends, but you guys, you guys are my only friends in Pimbal.

[54:29] I mean that like my friends in Pimbal are the customers.

[54:34] Like, you know, it's like this weird thing of like a media outlet or a content

[54:40] creator would be on the side of the customer.

[54:44] And what's interesting is through all of my,

[54:47] they all my stride in takes on this hobby,

[54:51] I do have professional, respectful working relationships with George Gomez,

[54:56] Seth Davis, Jack Gwynnary, Gwynnary, right?

[55:00] Ken Cromwell, like it's like, you know, Brett Abbes,

[55:03] like I'm not, I, I love to like this whole like, oh,

[55:07] you didn't get invited to start like if I wanted to go see Sterns D&D this week,

[55:14] do you think I would fly to Chicago and hang out with the B team?

[55:22] Or would I get on a first class plane ticket to Las Vegas and party with Seth,

[55:28] George and the team in Vegas?

[55:30] Where do you think Canada would go?

[55:32] Next week, you think I'm going to go, again, just, just take a guess.

[55:37] And anytime I want to go to Stern and see anything over there,

[55:42] who's picking me up in his Porsche, right?

[55:45] If you could have seen last time I was there,

[55:49] the other content creators were, you know, they were getting,

[55:52] they were getting a tour.

[55:54] I was just getting a personal tour from George Gomez.

[55:56] Okay, just say, just say it, just say it, just say it.

[55:59] I'm not, I don't feel like slighted at all.

[56:04] Franchie said, I think the biggest shale is Retro Ralph blowing Stern on every show

[56:10] with all his Stern gear on and I had to quit watching his podcast.

[56:15] Well, you know, look, Franchie, I don't disagree, man.

[56:17] It gets weird to me.

[56:19] It's weird to me.

[56:20] And look, it's the safe bet.

[56:23] If you want to get an audience and you want to get views,

[56:28] then yeah, like go, go, go,

[56:30] go, she'll Stern because they're the biggest.

[56:32] They have the largest audience.

[56:33] And look, to be honest, when you think about some of the content creation,

[56:38] some of these guys are just happy, go lucky,

[56:41] pinball fans who don't see anything wrong and anything happening in pinball.

[56:47] And that's fine.

[56:48] Right? It absolutely fine.

[56:50] Like there's a yin to the yang of everything in life.

[56:52] I actually think a lot of those guys are just, they, they, like Ralph seems like a really

[56:57] good, nice guy.

[56:58] But yeah, it can be a little frustrating and infuriating when you don't really feel like

[57:05] you're like you're ever going to get an honest opinion from somebody because

[57:09] they only want to say something nice about a company and its products.

[57:13] See, that's, see, that gets boring.

[57:16] I mean, in the end, it does, it will ultimately get, but it's still better.

[57:19] I mean, it is still better to be the forever optimist,

[57:24] positive purveyor of pinball.

[57:26] It is still better to be that because that person will wake up every day and

[57:31] actually feel good about what they're doing.

[57:33] And you know my, my way to measure whether or not you're enjoying your life is

[57:39] how many days do wake up in a good mood.

[57:41] And I believe that those gentlemen are in a great mood when they put up their

[57:48] content, glorifying everything Stern does.

[57:52] I think people who wake up negative about everything in pinball,

[57:56] who are angry about everything happening in pinball, who make content.

[58:00] And you know who they've, you've seen these guys in the past, like the

[58:03] Cornelius is of the world.

[58:04] Like they came in like hard, like hot and heavy negative.

[58:08] It's like they're almost trying to tear down the hobby.

[58:12] Those guys flame out right away.

[58:14] They flame out right away.

[58:16] They don't last very long.

[58:18] Okay.

[58:19] They really don't last very long.

[58:21] All right.

[58:22] What I'm going to read some of your comments.

[58:24] Canada softening if, wait,

[58:28] canada softening it.

[58:30] He's cringe.

[58:30] I don't get what that, I don't get that sentence.

[58:33] June would be amazing.

[58:35] Ralph at least tells you what they are.

[58:37] They're the only ones who give them money.

[58:43] I don't, who gives Ralph money?

[58:44] I don't know.

[58:45] I make a great mom.

[58:46] Most days, I'm in a great mood.

[58:49] Most days says Colin.

[58:51] Okay.

[58:51] Retro Ralph may not have many hot takes,

[58:54] but a rad dude and makes incredible videos.

[58:59] Yeah.

[59:00] I mean, look.

[59:03] Oh.

[59:03] So retro.

[59:04] So flipping out gives Ralph money.

[59:05] Okay.

[59:06] Well, that's, look, it makes sense.

[59:08] It makes sense.

[59:09] You know, it's, it's, um,

[59:12] but, but, but here's the thing.

[59:15] Here's the thing when it doesn't,

[59:19] I don't, you know what it, it doesn't even matter.

[59:21] Like it doesn't matter, you know, it doesn't matter.

[59:25] In the end, it's smart marketing by Zach to do that.

[59:32] I mean that.

[59:33] Let me tell you something again.

[59:34] If someone wanted to pay me money, pay me money to,

[59:40] to give you guys a little bit of a,

[59:43] a better deal on a game to send them leads, right?

[59:48] Let's, let's do a little Glen Gary Glen Ross.

[59:51] If someone wanted to pay me money, not to show the game,

[59:55] but just say, hey, if you buy from coin taker, you know,

[59:59] you can knock another $100 off.

[01:00:01] If you use the, you know, can tell him, can aid a sent you and coin taker wants

[01:00:07] to give me, you know, $50 per lead, I would absolutely do that.

[01:00:12] You know, I see nothing wrong with that.

[01:00:14] As long as it doesn't interfere with my integrity on the reviews of the game,

[01:00:20] I will not change my opinions on that.

[01:00:24] Now, here's the problem, right?

[01:00:25] You can see already the problem in all of that is if you know you're going to get money

[01:00:32] for every game sold.

[01:00:35] It absolutely will destroy the integrity of your opinions about the game

[01:00:41] because you're 100% going to say nothing but good things about the game

[01:00:46] because you have money at stake.

[01:00:48] You know what I'm saying?

[01:00:50] So I think that's the issue is it will inherently make you sell out and it will

[01:00:55] inherently just not work out.

[01:00:58] And that is why there is separation of church and state between the journalism

[01:01:03] department and the edit, you know, the editorial and the advertising departments

[01:01:07] of like any content, any content.

[01:01:11] So that's that.

[01:01:13] Canada, I'll give you $50 if you can go a week without saying, I mean it when I say,

[01:01:19] look, I mean it when I say it, Franchie, I will take you up on that.

[01:01:22] When are we starting that?

[01:01:23] All right.

[01:01:24] And I mean it when I say it, I'm going to take that challenge.

[01:01:27] Canada, isn't D&D a little nicer than you expected?

[01:01:31] Yeah, it is.

[01:01:32] I absolutely.

[01:01:33] I don't think anybody expected Stern to actually put a real mechanism in a game.

[01:01:38] Did anyone actually expect Stern to put a real mechanism in a game for once?

[01:01:44] Like they did it.

[01:01:45] Like that mech, that dragon looks like it came from the mid 90s from Bally Williams.

[01:01:51] Finally, finally, we know you can do it, Stern.

[01:01:56] You just did it.

[01:01:57] And now it makes that rubber duck rubber duckie shark in jaws look so silly and ridiculous.

[01:02:04] Like honestly, Bruce should have this treatment.

[01:02:07] So yeah, the game exceeded my expectations, but I still won't buy it because I don't like

[01:02:13] Dungeons and Dragons.

[01:02:14] Is that simple?

[01:02:15] That is really easy, really easy.

[01:02:18] It looks like it came from Jurassic Park.

[01:02:20] I don't care.

[01:02:22] I'm sure they took the Jurassic Park and made it better.

[01:02:26] That's called common sense innovation, improving upon something you've already put R&D into.

[01:02:34] Josh is not a negative.

[01:02:37] You know, I'm saying you make this great Jurassic Park mechanism.

[01:02:40] They make it even better.

[01:02:42] It's not a negative.

[01:02:44] All right.

[01:02:44] You know, it's a negative.

[01:02:46] The lower playfields in Avatar, the mechanisms in John Wick.

[01:02:51] You know, it's a negative, right?

[01:02:53] Having no toys in Max in games and then charging people 10 to 15,000 dollars.

[01:02:57] That's a negative.

[01:03:00] Have you tried Dungeons and Dragons?

[01:03:02] What?

[01:03:03] No, nobody has.

[01:03:06] There's only a dragon and a cube.

[01:03:08] The artwork makes it looks like there is a lot more going on.

[01:03:12] Branchy.

[01:03:13] Branchy, branchy, branchy, branchy, branchy, branchy.

[01:03:16] Branchy, there's more than that going on in the game, Branchy.

[01:03:21] There's more than that going on.

[01:03:23] Don't, don't, don't, don't you talk about artwork saying it makes it look like there's a lot more going on than there really is.

[01:03:32] Because that's been Stern's model for a long time.

[01:03:34] It's been Pimbaos model for the longest time.

[01:03:37] Branchy, there's a dragon.

[01:03:40] There's targets.

[01:03:41] There's, there's like a, you know, a dungeon entrance that pops up.

[01:03:48] There's a magnetic cube.

[01:03:50] There's a ramp that lifts up.

[01:03:51] There's three flippers.

[01:03:52] There's, there's a shield that pops up in between the flippers.

[01:03:56] I haven't even talked about that.

[01:03:57] That's my favorite part of the game is the shield that pops up from underneath because I suck at Pimbao.

[01:04:07] That's like, you know, it's like adding two inches to your ding dong.

[01:04:11] I love that.

[01:04:12] I love that thing.

[01:04:14] That's going to make a lot of fun for a lot of people happen.

[01:04:17] Okay.

[01:04:18] Look, there's a lot going on in the game.

[01:04:20] There's a lot.

[01:04:21] Like we don't, we don't, I think I'm giving high praise to Evil Dead and to D&D.

[01:04:31] Branchy, this will, this, and I mean it when I say it, Branchy, Evil Dead looks way better than D&D though.

[01:04:39] Like way, way better.

[01:04:41] Way better.

[01:04:43] I mean, I put up the post history on Facebook for 10 grand.

[01:04:47] Evil Dead makes that $13,000 D&D look like like a $7,000.

[01:04:53] Like die, like it makes the D&D Ellie looks like a pro.

[01:04:59] You take away the art, you know, the laser etched armor.

[01:05:04] Is it even laser etched?

[01:05:05] Isn't everything just laser etched these days?

[01:05:07] Like you can't even get a chick to mingnug you without it being laser etched.

[01:05:12] I just think it doesn't look good.

[01:05:14] It just doesn't look good.

[01:05:16] You know, when I look at Evil Dead, I don't even like Evil Dead, but I love the way the game looks.

[01:05:22] I don't like D&D and I don't like the way the game looks.

[01:05:26] So score one in the Wing Gollum for spooky here.

[01:05:31] All right.

[01:05:33] Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, everybody.

[01:05:36] Have you voted, Canadian yet in the Twippies and then seen the and then voted 18,000 times

[01:05:42] for best location, best location down the block, best location.

[01:05:47] If I turn left, best location, if I turn right, best location, two towns over, best location,

[01:05:53] next state, best location in Florida, best location.

[01:05:57] If I'm on a cruise ship, why did they think that anybody?

[01:06:02] I'll tell you why they did this because the committee is made up of location dudes like dude,

[01:06:09] you're the rule number one of marketing.

[01:06:12] Get yourself out of it.

[01:06:15] Do what the target audience will find enjoyable.

[01:06:20] The moment you hit that page in the Twippies, it is like the wind is taken out of the sales vote.

[01:06:28] Voting should be fun.

[01:06:30] You should make it as fun as possible.

[01:06:33] I don't even want to send that to people because then I have to explain to them like you don't

[01:06:37] have to fill out everything.

[01:06:39] You don't have to fill it all the forms.

[01:06:40] You can just skip pages two through seven.

[01:06:43] You don't have to do, you don't have to like just think about it through the lens of like

[01:06:48] everybody who votes.

[01:06:50] The actual experience of voting should be memorable.

[01:06:56] That laborious.

[01:06:58] It was easier for me to vote for the president of the United States than it was for me to

[01:07:03] get through the Twippy voting.

[01:07:05] Okay?

[01:07:06] Not good.

[01:07:07] Not good.

[01:07:08] Okay.

[01:07:09] Jamie and Colin, you guys know this and I know they're like, oh, can you just make them

[01:07:13] one of us again?

[01:07:14] Like I get, this is what's going on in the committee's head right now.

[01:07:18] Like Aaron, like all of them over there, making fun of all of them.

[01:07:20] I mean, they're like, oh man, like you know, like can he just the one who hypes the Twippy's

[01:07:23] the most and he's like, he's not wrong.

[01:07:25] He's like, you know, he's encouraged every he's encouraging everybody to like vote, but

[01:07:28] he's also making fun of us at the same time.

[01:07:30] You know, he's like, and he hasn't even started making fun of the fact that to go to the

[01:07:34] Twippy's, have you seen this part?

[01:07:37] To go to the Twippy's 40 people, only 40.

[01:07:43] They want you to pay $80 to get in.

[01:07:47] $80 to get into the Twippy's.

[01:07:52] Okay.

[01:07:53] So, I'm not paying that.

[01:07:57] I'm not paying $80 to get in anywhere, anywhere.

[01:08:02] You just like, what?

[01:08:05] $80 to get into the, is that, is that, was that like again, the committee, real smart guys

[01:08:12] over there.

[01:08:13] Oh wait, the only, well, we only have, I can see there are like, meant to, well, we only

[01:08:17] have 40 room for 40.

[01:08:19] So the only way to like limit the demand, because everyone's going to want to go.

[01:08:23] No, news flash, no, people go to TFF because it's an entire show and they go to TFF because

[01:08:29] they're going to meet all the companies, the manufacturers, the designers, everyone's

[01:08:32] there.

[01:08:33] That's why an award show there works.

[01:08:35] Oh, but we only got 40 seats in Houston, not associated with anything else.

[01:08:42] No one's going to be here other than us, $80.

[01:08:47] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

[01:08:51] good, good, good.

[01:08:52] How many tickets have you sold for or five?

[01:08:55] Like email me at canada pimple at gmo.com.

[01:08:59] This is it.

[01:09:00] So this is the problem.

[01:09:01] I'm like, oh man, he's making one of us again.

[01:09:02] He's like destroying the integrity of the show and he's also going to win.

[01:09:06] And now he's putting us in this predicament where like it sucks.

[01:09:11] He's always got to do this.

[01:09:12] He's always got to make it about him.

[01:09:14] He's always got to make fun of it.

[01:09:16] But then if he loses, everyone's going to challenge the integrity of the voting because

[01:09:21] he's won it six years in a row.

[01:09:24] And the only year he lost is when we made him ineligible and his content has gotten better.

[01:09:31] It's scary how good canadus pinball content has become.

[01:09:38] And he like he's the best streamer on Saturday mornings.

[01:09:42] What is what the category for that?

[01:09:44] The Saturday morning streamers better than like, hey, best location.

[01:09:47] And you know, four blocks over.

[01:09:49] The four blocks over.

[01:09:50] Who's got the best location?

[01:09:55] You guys are funny.

[01:09:56] Tell me again, how much you spent at Tiffany's more than you got if you got to ask Brian

[01:10:00] more than you got.

[01:10:02] What is this?

[01:10:03] Okay.

[01:10:04] Well, I would have reasoned me your comments because when I'm going like that, I can't

[01:10:06] read.

[01:10:07] I got to stay inside the eluda Chris mine inside my head.

[01:10:10] Just make it five years ago.

[01:10:13] The airfare is too much.

[01:10:14] Wow, $80.

[01:10:15] $80.

[01:10:16] $80.

[01:10:17] Hey, man.

[01:10:19] No, Colin, like we're all having fun, man.

[01:10:22] We're all having fun.

[01:10:23] Like I look in the end, in the end, in the end, the twippies is an award show that's going

[01:10:29] to be enjoyed over the internet.

[01:10:31] And that's it.

[01:10:32] I'm looking for, of course, I'm going to tune in.

[01:10:34] Of course, I'm going to watch.

[01:10:35] Of course, I want you guys to vote.

[01:10:37] But it's going to be a show meant for an internet audience, right?

[01:10:42] Being there is not important.

[01:10:45] You know what I'm saying?

[01:10:46] Because like, it was different at TFF when you had like 400 people in a room and all the

[01:10:51] personalities in the room, all the manufacturers in the room.

[01:10:55] That's different vibes.

[01:10:58] This show, if I'm these guys, go watch Greg and Zach's internet version of the twippies,

[01:11:05] they did it best.

[01:11:07] So if they're going to aim to make the show enjoyable, just make it enjoyable for an audience

[01:11:14] that's watching over the internet, that's all you need to do.

[01:11:19] And your reactions and your commentary and your personalities are what is what is what

[01:11:28] is what I can't even talk right now.

[01:11:32] That's how smart I am.

[01:11:33] I'm just, I'm going in mental loops.

[01:11:36] Your personalities are what will make this show entertaining.

[01:11:42] But trust me when I say this, none of your personalities will ever make eight categories

[01:11:50] of location winners exciting.

[01:11:54] So what you should do and what they're probably going to do, much like the Academy Awards,

[01:12:01] announce those things first like best short, foreign film, like just have a running scroll

[01:12:07] of who won those twippies.

[01:12:09] Don't make us sit through an announcement of each one.

[01:12:13] All right, because if you do, you're going to lose everybody.

[01:12:17] All right, what I'm reading these audiences here.

[01:12:20] Just a lot easier if you put Canadian on the committees for things.

[01:12:27] I'm playing all you want, but Chris, you're going to sipping some fancy as drink watching

[01:12:32] the twippies.

[01:12:34] Of course, I'm going to be watching the twippies.

[01:12:36] All right, what else?

[01:12:38] I'd rather talk pinball than awards, really.

[01:12:41] Joseph, have we not talked enough pinball, Joseph?

[01:12:44] Joseph, you know, Joseph, I want you.

[01:12:47] I want, what do you want to talk about, Joseph?

[01:12:48] All right, Joseph, guys, sorry.

[01:12:50] Sorry, I've been boring you with the awards stuff.

[01:12:54] Joseph wants to talk pinball.

[01:12:56] What would a novel idea?

[01:12:57] Okay, Joseph, what do you want to talk about?

[01:12:59] What do you, you got the stage, brother?

[01:13:01] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:03] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:04] What would happen we talked about for the last hour and 15 minutes in pinball?

[01:13:09] What do we miss, Joseph, enlighten me?

[01:13:12] Enlighten me, brother.

[01:13:13] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:14] You got nothing.

[01:13:15] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:16] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:18] Now, nobody wants to pay for their public Chanel leaves.

[01:13:21] Let's talk about that.

[01:13:22] How the topper looks like crap and now nobody wants the game.

[01:13:26] All right, Blues Brothers.

[01:13:27] I'm not talking about Blues Brothers.

[01:13:29] I'm not talking about Blues Brothers.

[01:13:33] Joseph, take a hit of this brother.

[01:13:36] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:37] Where's the, where's the gambler?

[01:13:38] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:39] What do you want to talk about?

[01:13:39] You need to even be, let's see.

[01:13:41] Did he shine back in with the topic?

[01:13:46] Where is he?

[01:13:47] Where is he?

[01:13:48] Okay, okay.

[01:13:48] The new D&D generates new game every week.

[01:13:51] Any thoughts on that?

[01:13:52] All right, well fine.

[01:13:53] He actually came back with a good subject.

[01:13:58] Every Sunday, it's like, it's like,

[01:14:00] Canada rejuvenates every Saturday.

[01:14:03] You don't figure out what he's going to say.

[01:14:05] I think it's neat.

[01:14:08] I don't know if it's going to be enjoyable

[01:14:10] until we experience it.

[01:14:12] Most of us will never experience it

[01:14:14] because we won't own D&D.

[01:14:16] I think there's like, I think people are confusing though.

[01:14:20] It's just going to randomize how the game happens.

[01:14:22] And they're just going to have, again,

[01:14:25] if they have like 30 different modes in the game

[01:14:28] and those modes happen when you go through the dungeon

[01:14:31] and go down different pathways,

[01:14:34] they're just going to randomize what you experience

[01:14:38] if you go straight on week one

[01:14:40] might be different than week two.

[01:14:42] And they're just going to randomize that.

[01:14:44] It's fun.

[01:14:44] I think it's a neat concept.

[01:14:46] I think it makes the game connect to D&D in a cool way.

[01:14:51] But what is not going to happen, guys,

[01:14:53] is you're not getting like an all new game every Sunday.

[01:14:58] They're not going to keep coding

[01:15:01] all these new things every week from now until eternity.

[01:15:04] You're just going to get random.

[01:15:06] It's going to be random.

[01:15:08] So I think it's, again, I think it's cool,

[01:15:10] but I don't think until we see what it's like in practice,

[01:15:15] we'll see.

[01:15:17] All right, so like, yeah, it's not

[01:15:21] joy to uploading new adventures every week.

[01:15:23] That's not happening.

[01:15:26] All right, so it will randomize the three shots.

[01:15:33] Well, you know, something that like, I wish,

[01:15:39] you know, I kind of feel like they missed an opportunity

[01:15:42] a little bit.

[01:15:44] It kind of like venom, depending on what venom you are,

[01:15:46] the play field changes.

[01:15:48] And I think, you know, some of that's here,

[01:15:50] but I do think, depending on what character you select,

[01:15:56] the ability to really alter the play field experience

[01:16:00] or the shots even would have been unique and interesting.

[01:16:05] But you know, I don't know, I don't know.

[01:16:08] All I know is this.

[01:16:10] This game is a really, really good theme

[01:16:13] and a great effort from Stern Pimball.

[01:16:16] Based on a theme that, you know, obviously,

[01:16:18] is not the most popular with all of us,

[01:16:20] but still good job.

[01:16:23] Good job.

[01:16:24] I'm glad there's no lower play field in this game.

[01:16:26] Lower play fields suck.

[01:16:28] Like, let's be honest, lower play fields suck.

[01:16:34] And, you know, like, the evil dead one is all,

[01:16:39] as much as I want in a lower play field experience.

[01:16:42] It's just, you know what I'm saying?

[01:16:44] Like, it's just the right amount.

[01:16:47] But like, the lower play field in El Vira,

[01:16:50] like, not El Vira, monsters.

[01:16:52] I, you know, the, it just, I don't know, like,

[01:16:55] the, when you start flipping around

[01:16:57] and the ball's not the same weight

[01:16:59] and it doesn't have the same kinetic feel.

[01:17:01] Yeah, the, like, yes, obviously,

[01:17:03] the Lebowski's awesome lower play field,

[01:17:06] but that was 12 years ago.

[01:17:08] That is the exception.

[01:17:10] The majority of them are not great.

[01:17:13] You know, I think they, they look cooler than they are.

[01:17:16] And the fact that they put two in, in, in Avatar's funny to me.

[01:17:21] My computer didn't turn off.

[01:17:23] All right, we got a few more minutes.

[01:17:23] What else, what else you guys want to talk about?

[01:17:30] Did anyone, anyone donated any money to, to Canadian's PayPal?

[01:17:33] Why, why we've been here?

[01:17:34] I can give you a shout out.

[01:17:35] Let me check.

[01:17:36] Let me check right now.

[01:17:37] Normally, Kelly Daniel, I'm saving you money.

[01:17:39] See, see, some of my, like, stars guys,

[01:17:42] they would be all in on given stars.

[01:17:45] I don't know.

[01:17:46] You guys, okay, you guys like it here.

[01:17:48] Like, like, okay, let me, let me ask right now.

[01:17:51] I'm gonna do a poll.

[01:17:52] And do, do, do.

[01:17:54] It's way easier to read the chat.

[01:17:57] Then it is on Facebook for me.

[01:17:58] I got it, I got to be honest.

[01:18:00] Okay.

[01:18:01] Do you like SMS here versus Facebook?

[01:18:08] All right, let's start the poll.

[01:18:10] Now is your chance to vote, all you Facebook fans.

[01:18:15] Oh, man.

[01:18:18] You know, I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a,

[01:18:22] I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a,

[01:18:26] I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a, I'm just a,

[01:18:30] I'm just a, I always like talking a little bit about life

[01:18:35] at the end of these shows.

[01:18:36] I know, I know, Joseph, you want to talk Pimball?

[01:18:40] I know Pete Rosen, I miss your stars, brother.

[01:18:42] Pete, did you give the PayPal?

[01:18:44] Pete used to give 5,000 stars in, in, in episode.

[01:18:47] I literally, the, the amount of Pete Rosen money I'm losing

[01:18:51] by keeping it here is criminal.

[01:18:55] Pete, Pete is like, Pete's on the like, lifetime,

[01:18:58] like on the top three greatest, Canadian supporters of all time.

[01:19:03] Let's see, opening up the Patreon.

[01:19:08] We got a new member, RJ, join yesterday.

[01:19:15] Uh, no PayPal.

[01:19:17] Nobody loves me.

[01:19:18] Nobody loves me.

[01:19:24] Let's see.

[01:19:27] Of course, yeah, no is a vote for Facebook.

[01:19:32] Do you like it here versus Facebook?

[01:19:35] So yes, means I like it here.

[01:19:38] And no would mean I liked Facebook better.

[01:19:42] It's real simple guys.

[01:19:44] Real simple.

[01:19:45] Don't make me, I'm sorry, I'm a question, you know, the intelligence of my audience here.

[01:19:52] Yeah, gang, I mean, look, I am, I'm about to go back to work next week.

[01:19:56] And I just want to say that I want to thank each and every one of you for hanging out and, and being a part of this community.

[01:20:04] I'm going to talk a little bit from the heart right now.

[01:20:08] And I know like, you know, for those of you who don't want a softer side of Canada, it's a good time to leave.

[01:20:14] The, um, the thing that always I think about as a, as a new parent and as watching kids grow up and, and, and my job, I absorb a lot of information about people.

[01:20:23] And, and culture and society and, and how new generations are vibing and how they're feeling and how they are mentally and how they are socially and, and the behaviors that are changing, right?

[01:20:37] And I really mean it when I say it, I think all of us for the most part are very lucky.

[01:20:44] And we grew up before the internet.

[01:20:46] And, and I don't think we'll ever really fully understand what a blessing it was to grow up before the internet when we had a go out for entertainment where we waited for things that excited us.

[01:21:03] And in the time between waiting for things, we used our imagination.

[01:21:09] And I've been thinking a lot about this hobby and why I love it so much and what it really means to me and the reason why it's so special is I think this hobby, unlike everything else I see in the world and all the other categories and brands and, and, and things that are trying to reach us as grown adults.

[01:21:31] This hobby reminds me of that time when I was young and I was innocent and I loved waiting to see what the next arcade machine was going to be, what the next games from Nintendo were going to be, what the next iteration of a video game console would be, you know, when you went from 8 bit to 16 bit.

[01:21:54] And you dreamed and you imagined and you dreamt about it, like you thought about it a lot and, and then you had the moment where it was revealed to you and you had such elation and feelings about it.

[01:22:12] And when I love about Pimball, it's still that.

[01:22:16] Like I don't know what Harry Potter is going to look like, but I know it's coming. I don't know what King Kong is going to be, but I know it's going to be special because of who's making it.

[01:22:25] And, and then in the time between these new games, we dream, we imagine. Now the internet has allowed us to connect and share our enthusiasm.

[01:22:39] But I do mean this when I say it like it's still an analog game that you got to stand in front of and you can't enjoy Pimball while you're on your phone.

[01:22:49] I mean, how many of you when you try to watch a movie now at home, a TV show with your partner or your friends or, and then all of a sudden you see it 20 minutes in like someone's got their phone open.

[01:23:04] And again, it takes you out of that moment. You're sort of you've lost focus. And you know, now you're dual screening. Heck some people triple screen phone laptop and content going.

[01:23:17] And in the end, I, I, I, I wholeheartedly believe this. The number one thing that is crippling the world and Gen Z and kids and my kids will have to suffer through this.

[01:23:32] And we all suffer through this. The number one pandemic of the world. And it's what leads to all of the issues of the world is loneliness. Like lonely people.

[01:23:44] People that feel isolated and without love and without family and without friends. They're dying. Right. And so what I love about this hobby and I mean this when I say this.

[01:23:57] And not being instance, you're not just ham and this up.

[01:24:02] I don't ever feel lonely every day because of my connection to all of you and the community and there and at any hour, I can wake up three in the morning, one in the morning, two in the afternoon.

[01:24:18] The, the, the Canadian Patreon chat is one of the most enjoyable. I mean, see how enjoyable this chat is. That's what it's like. It's, it's a 24 seven scrolling community of people that are just connected over a shared passion for pinball.

[01:24:38] You're never alone. You know, you're never alone. If I put into my company chat a phrase that one in the morning, hey guys, no one, no one responds for seven hours eight hours.

[01:24:49] And I, I do love that all of us from all different walks of life and backgrounds and personalities can kind of unite over this thing. It's a beautiful thing.

[01:25:02] It's a beautiful thing. And I hope it brings you guys joy every week. And I hope the content that I create brings you a sense of connection. And I really do appreciate each and every one of you.

[01:25:14] And it's, and it means more than the money. You know that. Like, but it is nice. It is nice that all the hard work I put into making this content has had a little bit, a little bit of like some, you know, monetary reward.

[01:25:28] And I think everyone should be rewarded for, for what they create. And especially if they put a lot of hard work into it.

[01:25:35] So that's, that's me saying gang, it's Saturday. We do this every Saturday morning.

[01:25:41] A weekends are a special time. If you're a young parent like me, I'm not young, but I'm a kid's are young.

[01:25:47] You know how long the weekends are. These are the tough, they're so cute, but they're a lot of work.

[01:25:57] Honestly, with Patreon's chat was better.

[01:26:03] Joseph, look, here's a deal. Here's a deal. I'm not going to keep making thread on Pond thread. I'm not doing discord.

[01:26:13] Like the Patreon chat. I'll tell you this. It's, it's amazing when you, when you approach it the right way. If you want it to be something else, it's not going to be that.

[01:26:24] But just, just enjoy it for what it is. It's, it's, it's, it's a royal rumble of conversation. And I love it.

[01:26:31] And look, when you jump in, know this. You didn't miss much. Just jump in with a move. Like, just think about like a wrestling royal rumble coming off the top rope with what you want to talk about.

[01:26:44] And, and we're, and we'll steer in that direction. If you go into the Patreon chat and try to scroll back to the last thing you posted and then read everything after that.

[01:26:57] Yeah, you're not going to enjoy it. Okay, it's, it's just not the way to do it. Right. I mean it. Like just use it. Think about it like a royal rumble and you'll have a lot of fun with it.

[01:27:08] Everybody look be good. And I love you guys. I mean that not as much as I love my wife and my kids, but you know, it's a different kind of love. And I do love this hobby.

[01:27:21] And we're going to, we're going to have some a lot coming in Pimbal people. It's just starting. The year is just starting. This is just the beginning, man. It's going to get real good.

[01:27:32] And I'm looking forward to it. And I think this game and evil dead. I think the year is off to a good start. The bar is really high.

[01:27:40] You know, because like, you know, the big themes now. They have to, they have to elevate over that bar. Right. You know, you can't have evil dead and D&D putting more into the game than Harry Potter and Kong. Right.

[01:27:55] And who knows what else goonies like it's coming. It's all coming. All right. Everybody. So drink some socket tonight. And join canate is pinball podcast. If you're not a member and go vote in the twippies.

[01:28:07] I know I'm been making fun of them a lot, but it's they're an easy target. They did it to themselves. I tried to help them. I tried.

[01:28:14] They still did it to themselves. Call and just literally you don't even need a committee. Just canate of what would you do? I would do this. Boom. And it would be the right thing to do.

[01:28:24] I don't I'm a committee of one at work. I don't need committee. I hate it when committees have to vote on creative ideas. I don't think committees work.

[01:28:34] I've never ever I think teams work, but committees never work. All right. All right. Everybody be good. Peace out later.
