[00:00] You can rely on the old man's money.

[00:02] You can rely on the old man's money.

[00:05] It's a bitch girl, but it's gone too far.

[00:08] Cause you know it don't matter anyway.

[00:11] Say mine, I might have won't get you too far.

[00:14] Get you too far.

[00:15] It's...

[00:16] I can't do it.

[00:18] No.

[00:19] Oh, it's...

[00:21] It's...

[00:22] I can't do it.

[00:23] I love it when people send me like information.

[00:26] Like, Stern's raising the prices on their games.

[00:30] Like, Canada hasn't been telling you for months now.

[00:33] Stern is gonna do a major price increase

[00:36] on all of its titles.

[00:38] And I'm here to tell you right now,

[00:39] this is what the price increase is.

[00:41] On every Stern Pro moving forward,

[00:44] there will be a $600 price increase.

[00:48] On every premium, it will be $1,000 price increase.

[00:53] And the LEDs I'm hearing

[00:54] are gonna be the same price increase of the premium.

[00:57] So that's $1,000 more.

[01:00] For every single Stern, Ellie machine,

[01:02] Stern Pimbal machines are now over $10,000.

[01:06] Now, I think people expect Canada

[01:08] to scream from the rooftops.

[01:09] How dare they?

[01:11] How dare Stern Pimbal raise their prices to this point?

[01:14] But I've been saying it for the last year.

[01:18] The writing has been on the wall.

[01:20] These Pimbal companies were not gonna sit by

[01:23] and watch people pay such a premium for their products

[01:26] and see all of these games trade on the second hand market

[01:30] for well above MSRP.

[01:32] Stern saw people buying Mandalorians for $12,000, $13,000.

[01:37] They're seeing people buying stranger things,

[01:39] Ellie for $12,000.

[01:41] They saw what happened with guns and roses, CE.

[01:43] They saw what happened with Elvira, Ellie's, and Essie's.

[01:46] If you want a Ghostbusters Ellie to day,

[01:50] guess how much money I think it would take

[01:52] to get a Ghostbusters Ellie two day in 2021.

[01:56] I think you're looking at $12,000 to $13,000

[01:59] for a Ghostbusters Ellie.

[02:01] And if you have the top or for the Ghostbusters Ellie,

[02:04] I think you're looking at $15,000.

[02:06] Do I think it's crazy?

[02:08] Yes, would I spend those prices?

[02:10] No.

[02:11] But sometimes you have to step back in life

[02:13] and look at this a little bit differently.

[02:15] If I'm Stern Pimbal, I would absolutely do this.

[02:19] I would absolutely keep raising my prices

[02:22] until I hit a ceiling.

[02:24] And they're not even hitting a ceiling with these prices.

[02:27] This game, this Godzilla Ellie,

[02:29] is still gonna sell out on day one for $10,200.

[02:34] So is it a crime against Pimbal?

[02:36] That Stern Pimbal is simply baking into its MSRP.

[02:40] What all of you have been showing them is the ceiling.

[02:43] So how can you blame Stern Pimbal

[02:44] for baking into their MSRP,

[02:46] the second hand price of these games?

[02:48] Here's the question I have for all of you out there.

[02:51] Who are you mad at?

[02:52] Who are you mad at when you see this price increase?

[02:55] Are you mad at Stern?

[02:56] They're actually doing the smart business move.

[02:59] And for those of you saying,

[03:00] well, they're gonna drive people out of the hobby.

[03:03] The data shows otherwise.

[03:05] Year after year,

[03:06] as they've increased the prices of their machines,

[03:09] their sales have increased.

[03:12] So you can't say that if Stern raises the prices,

[03:14] they're gonna lose out on sales,

[03:16] because that's not true.

[03:17] You can't be mad at Stern because they're doing this

[03:19] because the market shows it can bear this price increase.

[03:23] So are you mad at your fellow Pimbal community members

[03:26] who have been paying well above the sticker price

[03:29] for these games?

[03:30] Are you mad at those people?

[03:31] Is it the Pimbal collector who's been driving prices up

[03:34] all these years and been saying bye, bye, bye,

[03:37] and FOMO and all the stuff that leads people to think

[03:40] that having different armor and a different translate

[03:43] equals a better Pimbal experience?

[03:45] Are you mad at the collectors?

[03:47] I think some of you are.

[03:48] I think some of you are mad that all of these newbies

[03:50] have come into this hobby, who have a lot of money,

[03:52] and have just thrown their cash around.

[03:54] And that's led to the inflation that we're seeing

[03:57] in the Pimbal marketplace.

[03:59] Are you mad at COVID?

[04:00] Like, is it the world we live in today?

[04:02] Is it the pandemic of modern day

[04:04] that has made so many people overemphasize?

[04:07] Things we're putting in our homes, right?

[04:09] These unnecessary toys that are going in our basements

[04:12] is it the pandemic's fault without COVID?

[04:15] And if people were still going out and about,

[04:17] if they were still taking vacations,

[04:19] if they were still spending money in other areas,

[04:22] would these men be at home all day long playing Pimbal?

[04:25] And not just at home playing Pimbal?

[04:26] Here's where I really think the disease lies.

[04:28] I think a lot of it is, a lot of you are spending

[04:30] a lot more time on Pinside.

[04:32] A lot of you are spending a lot more time in the places

[04:35] where people value these games,

[04:38] and people flex with these games,

[04:39] and people love to show off their collections.

[04:42] That has also been a contribution

[04:45] to the overemphasis of Pimbal machines in people's lives.

[04:49] I want to give you my honest feeling

[04:51] on Stern Pimbal raising the Pimbal prices

[04:54] on their machines.

[04:55] I think it was long overdue.

[04:56] I think it's been coming for a while,

[04:58] but the way I look at it is this.

[05:00] Each and every one of us,

[05:02] when it comes to buying a Pimbal machine,

[05:04] I think each and every one of us

[05:06] approaches Pimbal differently.

[05:08] We each come from different financial situations.

[05:11] We each come from different families,

[05:13] from different regions of the country and the world,

[05:16] and each of us out there.

[05:17] When we think about buying a Pimbal machine,

[05:20] that Pimbal machine is somewhere in our list of priorities

[05:24] on how we're gonna spend our money that year or this year.

[05:27] And for some of you out there, you might have no kids,

[05:30] you might not have any family,

[05:31] and you might have a decent job,

[05:33] and buying a Pimbal machine or two a year

[05:35] means absolutely nothing for you,

[05:37] because you have no other responsibilities.

[05:40] And so this price increase might not matter to you.

[05:43] For some of you out there,

[05:43] you might have so much money and the wife and the kids,

[05:47] and this doesn't really matter to you.

[05:49] For some of you out there,

[05:50] even saving up for a Stern Pro,

[05:52] required you to save up all year,

[05:54] and now you look at this,

[05:55] and you're just rolling your eyes because you see

[05:58] that this hobby is moving in a direction

[06:00] that's not gonna be beneficial to you.

[06:03] And deep down you know that if this thing

[06:05] is a financial stretch for you,

[06:07] you probably shouldn't even be considering

[06:09] buying a Pimbal machine.

[06:11] You probably should be putting your money

[06:13] into better growth areas than Pimbal,

[06:15] but this is the dilemma of something like a Pimbal machine,

[06:18] a non-essential toy that nobody needs.

[06:20] I mean this one, I say it.

[06:22] This is a non-essential toy that nobody needs to own.

[06:26] I mean that nobody needs to own a Pimbal machine.

[06:29] Nobody needs one in their house.

[06:31] Nobody needs one in their family.

[06:33] Contrary to deep roots trademarked line

[06:36] that every home needs a Pimbal, that's not true.

[06:39] And for a lot of you out there listening

[06:41] to this show right now, I want you to do me a favor.

[06:44] Just close your eyes and ask yourself the following.

[06:48] Do I need another Pimbal machine?

[06:51] You will probably answer no.

[06:54] And then if you ask the question,

[06:56] do I want another Pimbal machine?

[06:59] It will be yes.

[07:00] And that tug-of-war between the things you need

[07:03] and the things you want is the personal struggle

[07:06] that everybody goes through in life.

[07:08] And that kind of decision-making

[07:10] impacts all of our lives in a variety of areas.

[07:14] It determines where you live.

[07:16] It determines where you eat.

[07:17] It determines the kind of clothes you have.

[07:19] It determines the car you drive.

[07:20] What do I need versus what do I want?

[07:24] And I know that this is unpopular for the world's number one

[07:27] Pimbal podcast to say this, but on my list

[07:30] of things that I prioritize in life,

[07:33] owning another Pimbal machine, or even owning

[07:36] a Pimbal machine in my home.

[07:38] It is not at the top of my priority list.

[07:42] I would much rather own $10,000 in a stock.

[07:46] I would much rather use $10,000 to take an amazing vacation.

[07:50] I would much rather spend $10,000 on my beautiful wife.

[07:54] I would much rather put that $10,000 aside

[07:57] for Killian's College Fund.

[07:59] I go down all the things I would much rather do with that money.

[08:03] Now, for me personally, I'm doing all those things.

[08:06] And then there is some money left over a year

[08:09] where I can buy a Pimbal machine.

[08:12] And I find myself in that fortunate financial situation

[08:16] where me buying one of these machines

[08:18] between $6,000 to $13,000 a year, I could swing it.

[08:22] Like I could do it.

[08:23] The other good news for all of us out there

[08:26] is when you do buy a Pimbal machine,

[08:28] you're not going to lose your shirt, right?

[08:30] You're never going to buy a Pimbal machine

[08:32] and lose 80% of its value ever.

[08:35] So as a non-essential toy,

[08:37] this is one of the greatest non-essential toys

[08:40] that actually tremendously holds its value.

[08:44] And for many of us out there,

[08:45] that's been one of the excuses we use

[08:48] for our wives and our partners

[08:50] on why this is not throwing money away.

[08:53] And it's not.

[08:54] It is absolutely not throwing money away.

[08:57] Now, that being said, the real problem I see in the Pimbal world,

[09:01] it's not that Stern's raising their prices

[09:04] and so is Jersey Jack,

[09:05] it's that the money is not going into the machines.

[09:09] We are not seeing machines that look like they cost

[09:12] anywhere near this much money,

[09:14] but they're valued at that

[09:16] because there's no other options.

[09:19] Stern can price its machines whatever it wants

[09:22] because they have manufacturing down so well.

[09:26] And I mean this when I say this,

[09:28] Stern Pimbal without increasing its bomb at all.

[09:31] And I totally understand this is going to upset many of you

[09:34] out there without increasing its bomb at all.

[09:38] Stern Pimbal could sell each of their LEDs

[09:40] without a topper for $12,500 and they would sell every single one.

[09:47] And this is not the ceiling for them, they know that.

[09:50] This is not going to drive anybody out of Pimbal

[09:53] and as much as some people like to huff and puff,

[09:55] you know, they're like that guy and inside out,

[09:57] the angry little red guy with the flames shooting out of its head.

[10:01] A lot of you are screaming about this move,

[10:04] but the truth is how many of you went in on Halloween

[10:07] and ultra man before playing it.

[10:09] How many of you went in on Mandalorian before playing it?

[10:12] How many of you bought Pimbal machines,

[10:13] site unseen and probably all of you

[10:16] because the problem with Pimbal is it makes no sense.

[10:21] Buying a Pimbal machine for your home makes no sense.

[10:24] It was never designed to be there.

[10:27] None of this was how Pimbal was meant to be in culture.

[10:30] It was a toy that was supposed to be out in the world

[10:33] in which you put a few quarters in

[10:34] and you had some fun and you went home and that was it.

[10:38] And you weren't supposed to sit on pirates of the Caribbean

[10:40] for 45 minutes and understand a Bible-sized rule book.

[10:44] You were supposed to just have 15 minutes of fun

[10:47] and be on your way,

[10:48] but it's turned into something so much more right now.

[10:52] And the majority of people who are collecting Pimbal machines

[10:54] and buying all of these new inbox games

[10:57] are pretty wealthy individuals.

[10:59] You know, these are people who can afford to lose

[11:01] a few thousand dollars and not even think about it.

[11:04] Think about that for a minute.

[11:05] What other hobby would ever absorb?

[11:08] The amount of charlatan companies like Andrew Highway,

[11:12] like Deeproot, like Skit B, like Zidware,

[11:15] what other industry would constantly be throwing money at?

[11:19] Companies that didn't know what they were doing

[11:21] time and time again.

[11:23] There is a reason why it's happened in Pimbal

[11:25] because Pimbal people have enough money to lose.

[11:29] And I know that some of you out there are gonna be like,

[11:31] well, I didn't have enough money to lose.

[11:32] Yeah, you did.

[11:33] Because you paid money for something you didn't even see.

[11:36] It would be like going into a restaurant

[11:38] and paying for your meal and fall

[11:40] before you even saw a kitchen.

[11:42] And even worse than that, there is no kitchen.

[11:44] And no one's ever seen the kitchen before

[11:46] and you already paid for your meal and fall.

[11:48] That is what it's been like

[11:50] with all of these Pimbal companies.

[11:51] So you've got this combination of a somewhat wealthy target,

[11:56] buying a non-essential toy,

[11:58] and they love to flex on each other.

[12:00] And now it's turned into a collectible hobby.

[12:03] The new inbox Pimbal craze is all about collectors now.

[12:07] It's not about gameplay, it's not about shots,

[12:11] it's about the FOMO.

[12:13] It's about getting one of those rare machines

[12:15] and I'm telling you right now,

[12:17] I don't care about rare machines anymore.

[12:20] I don't value these rare machines anymore

[12:23] because nobody really cares if you have them.

[12:25] The only people that really care,

[12:27] the only people that are impressed by those things

[12:30] aren't even impressed because the people

[12:32] that are truly impressed by your LE collection,

[12:35] they also have an LE collection.

[12:37] And the other part is this,

[12:38] is that if you just turn off two things,

[12:41] if you turn off two things,

[12:42] absolutely nobody cares about this stuff.

[12:45] If you turn off Pinside and you turn off Facebook,

[12:48] there is nobody that cares about your Pimbal collection.

[12:52] There is nobody that's impressed

[12:54] that you have the topper for El Vira

[12:56] or for Ghostbusters, nobody.

[12:58] But you've got these communities

[13:00] and inside these communities,

[13:02] that is where the fever grows,

[13:03] that is where the desire to have that thing grows.

[13:06] I just saw this week that a pirate's of the Caribbean,

[13:09] you wanna talk about how much money's in this hobby,

[13:11] a pirate's of the Caribbean play field,

[13:13] a collector's edition play field

[13:15] that is being clear-coded by Cruise Men,

[13:17] is now for sale for the bargain basement price

[13:21] of $4,500.

[13:24] Just for the play field,

[13:26] this is the hobby we are now in.

[13:28] It's only gonna get worse for some people

[13:30] who value the value list.

[13:33] And I mean that,

[13:34] the people who value the stuff that's value list

[13:37] are gonna be the ones who are left holding the bag in the end.

[13:41] It's gonna be the guy who has like every single sternally

[13:45] and then he's gonna wake up one day

[13:47] and realize he barely turns his games on.

[13:49] He hasn't even completed one of the games

[13:51] and now he has like all of these games

[13:53] and it doesn't really matter.

[13:55] And for the rich dude out there,

[13:57] it's just artwork and everybody knows that

[13:59] and that's okay.

[14:00] I don't begrudge anyone if they wanna do this.

[14:02] If you wanna fill your house and your basement

[14:04] with 35 pinball machines,

[14:06] God bless you, go do it.

[14:08] I just also hope you do the other things in life

[14:11] that I believe are way more valuable than pinball.

[14:14] And they don't want you to hear this.

[14:16] I know this,

[14:16] like the distributors don't want you to hear this.

[14:18] The other podcasts that are trying to sell you games

[14:21] don't want you to hear this.

[14:22] They want you to value this stuff at $10,200,

[14:27] at $15,200, at $18,500, whatever it is.

[14:32] But I know this and you know this.

[14:34] Playing a pinball machine is not worth

[14:37] anything near those prices.

[14:39] It's just not, it is just not

[14:42] because you can have just as much fun

[14:44] and just as much enjoyment on a $3,000 machine

[14:48] or a $2,000 machine, just playing pinball is fun.

[14:52] It's not about the play, it's not,

[14:53] because if it was about the gameplay,

[14:55] then these Ghostbusters L.E.'s wouldn't be skyrocketing

[14:58] in price because that gameplay is horrible.

[15:00] It's only about there being only 500 Ghostbusters L.E.'s,

[15:05] only 200 pirate C.E.'s.

[15:07] Only this many Godzilla L.E.'s,

[15:09] only this many Matrix C.E.'s coming out.

[15:11] That's what it's all about.

[15:13] It's a decision you need to make.

[15:15] Am I angry about these prices?

[15:17] I'm not happy about them.

[15:19] Like nobody's happy if something they enjoy

[15:21] keeps going up in price.

[15:22] I, as a consumer, would like to get something

[15:25] for as cheap as possible.

[15:27] The company who's selling the product

[15:30] want to make as much as they can.

[15:32] That's how it works in life with all products

[15:34] and all goods and services, right?

[15:36] I know for me personally, this just makes it so much easier

[15:41] to look at this hobby and say, no thanks, I'm not buying.

[15:45] No thanks, I don't care.

[15:46] I'm okay if I miss out on the Godzilla Fomo

[15:50] because then there'll be the back to the future Fomo.

[15:52] Then there's gonna be the Toy Story Fomo.

[15:54] Then there's gonna be the James Bond Fomo.

[15:56] Then there's gonna be the Matrix Fomo.

[15:58] It's just never ending.

[16:00] And I could see this with like the spooky buyers,

[16:02] like people run into this stuff.

[16:04] We ran in, we ran through the door.

[16:06] Nobody really knows if they like the game.

[16:08] Nobody really knows what they're about to get.

[16:10] And now there's all these other games

[16:12] and now the prices are going up.

[16:13] And this is just the beginning.

[16:14] If you were to ask me five years from now,

[16:17] five years from now, do you really think

[16:18] people are gonna be spending $15,000 on guns and roses?

[16:21] No.

[16:22] Do you think five years from now people are gonna spend

[16:24] like $18,000 on pirates of the Caribbean?

[16:26] No.

[16:27] But right now, there's a bubble and everyone's inside it.

[16:31] It's not gonna completely burst,

[16:33] but there is no way this is sustainable.

[16:34] And I think for a lot of you out there,

[16:36] you're having some really, really serious conversations

[16:40] with yourself about whether or not any of this

[16:43] is truly worth it.

[16:44] That maybe the path way to happiness and pinball,

[16:46] grab a few games based on themes you love

[16:50] and just say, I'm good.

[16:52] I'm good.

[16:53] Stop listening to all the companies,

[16:55] stop listening to all the pin-side people

[16:58] and just say to yourself, I'm good.

[17:00] This is good.

[17:01] These three games represent themes I love.

[17:04] These three or four games represent gameplay I enjoy.

[17:08] These three to four games represent code

[17:10] that's really unique and different.

[17:11] And I'm good.

[17:13] Because I only have two arms and two hands

[17:15] and I can't play more than one machine at a time.

[17:18] So why would I need so many?

[17:20] Why would I need to flood my entire environment

[17:23] with all of these machines?

[17:24] And that's just my advice.

[17:26] That's just the way I'm looking at it.

[17:28] Because I love covering it.

[17:29] Believe me, I love watching these prices go up.

[17:32] I love the FOMO.

[17:33] I love watching how crazy everybody gets.

[17:36] And I love all the fanfare around every new game.

[17:39] But on some level, these price increases

[17:41] are just never gonna stop until people say,

[17:45] enough is enough.

[17:46] I don't even think we're there.

[17:47] I don't even think we're at the ceiling.

[17:49] I think we're gonna see $12,500 stern at least soon.

[17:52] I think we're gonna see $15,000 Jersey Jack CE soon.

[17:56] And I think someone out there is gonna have the guts.

[17:58] Somebody is gonna have the guts to make

[18:01] a super, super premium high-end machine

[18:04] very limited and charge $20,000.

[18:07] And I mean it right now when I say this.

[18:09] If Stern Pimble made 88, just 88, super limited

[18:15] editions of back to the future.

[18:17] What do you think they could charge?

[18:19] I believe if they only made 88,

[18:22] they could charge $20,000 in the current climate

[18:27] and sell every single one.

[18:30] And most people would cry in moan about that.

[18:32] But the 88 rich dudes who are much richer than me,

[18:36] they would be super happy to know they got one.

[18:39] And you know who you are.

[18:41] You see these guys.

[18:42] I mean these guys have like millions of dollars in cars.

[18:45] This is nothing to them.

[18:47] A Pimble machine for $20 grand to these gentlemen

[18:49] is like the price of brunch for the rest of us.

[18:52] So that's where we're at.

[18:53] That's where we're at with pricing.

[18:55] Okay, I wanna end this podcast real quickly

[18:57] by talking about P3 Multimorphic and Jerry's Sorcerers

[19:01] of Prentice that he announced this week.

[19:03] It's a $500 add-on for cosmic heart racing.

[19:06] And here's my thing with these games.

[19:08] I just don't think Jerry's getting anywhere

[19:11] with these sort of micro games on his platform

[19:14] and every single new game that Jerry launches

[19:17] for the P3 Multimorphic.

[19:19] At this point needs to be a platform mover.

[19:22] He needs to ask himself,

[19:24] will this game entice someone to buy a P3 Multimorphic?

[19:28] Because you can't tell me that his sales are flying off the shelf

[19:32] and he needs to follow up with something

[19:35] that's as good if not better than the Heist.

[19:38] Where is his license game?

[19:40] That's gonna be like Heist but with a license.

[19:42] That's what everybody's waiting for.

[19:44] Not these silly little side games

[19:46] because this is just quantity over quality.

[19:49] And I'm really looking forward to seeing what the license game is.

[19:51] I'm not gonna spend much time on this game,

[19:53] but again, Jerry, you gotta protect the brand.

[19:56] I don't think it does anything for P3 Multimorphic

[19:59] to have these mini games.

[20:00] I don't, I really don't know what they do for you

[20:02] because all these mini games do

[20:04] is they make the existing buyers happy.

[20:07] They won't sell you a single new P3 Multimorphic

[20:10] and you need to sell more units

[20:13] because you need volume out there in the world

[20:15] because the more people that have the platform,

[20:18] the more people that will buy each new game,

[20:21] which means the more money he can invest in better themes

[20:24] and better licenses and better hardware

[20:25] and better mechs, all the stuff.

[20:27] Like it has to go together.

[20:29] So will the license game be the platform mover?

[20:32] We will see.

[20:33] All right, look, it's end of August people.

[20:34] I think in the next few weeks,

[20:36] we're gonna see a lot come out in the pinball world.

[20:39] The prices are gonna keep going up and up.

[20:41] I think cactus Canyon remake is gonna be more expensive

[20:43] than the other titles.

[20:44] I think you're gonna see increase in prices from AP

[20:47] and everybody else.

[20:48] It's just the way it's going.

[20:49] I know material costs are going up,

[20:51] but they're not dummies.

[20:53] If you put a pinball machine in a box that people want,

[20:56] they're gonna spend money on it

[20:58] and they're not gonna think twice.

[20:59] This is a hobby filled with a lot of impulse buying

[21:01] and that is crazy, right?

[21:03] That people are so rich that they can impulse purchase

[21:07] a $12,000 game without ever seeing it played once.

[21:13] Think about that for a minute and you tell me why.

[21:16] We're gonna win a fifth Twippy later.

[21:17] I'm saying you're gonna lie on the whole map of the world.

[21:21] You're gonna lie on the whole map of the rich girl.

[21:25] The rich girl.

[21:26] Oh, I do rich, rich girl.
