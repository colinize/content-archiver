[00:00] Don't tell me what to do and don't tell me what to say.

[00:08] Please, when I go out with you, don't put me on the stretch.

[00:16] Alright, episode 46 of Canada's Pinball Podcast on this episode, we're gonna do just a

[00:28] little bit of house cleaning again. There's just been some stuff happening on the

[00:32] forums where we want to talk about. We will of course talk about everyone's favorite

[00:37] topic this summer, Ghostbusters and Stern and what's happening with that.

[00:40] But before I go into that, I sort of wanted to explain why I was so sort of

[00:45] pissed off on Friday when I uploaded Pinside Babies Part 2. You know, look, we do a

[00:51] pinball podcast here and this is a podcast that is a commentary on the

[00:56] pinball industry and I believe and I think you guys who listen to you agree.

[01:01] It is unlike any other pinball podcast out there and the point of this podcast

[01:06] has always been to be a little bit more controversial, to be a little bit more

[01:10] provocative and to talk about things that you can't talk about on the forum.

[01:15] Because the forums, mainly Pinside, has become this environment where you either

[01:21] have to be nice or they threat eject you. But even if you're not being nice, you

[01:27] really can't call people out because they just always come down on you and look,

[01:31] when I was on there, people would just personally attack me every day, even

[01:37] without provocation and there's nothing I can do. They let everyone just run

[01:42] wild on Canada. So it's cool. Like we're off the site, we have duplicate accounts and

[01:46] we are gonna always be lurking in the shadows there. But what would it know we'd

[01:50] be on Friday was I was asking Robin who I had been had a friendly sort of

[01:57] rapport with just like what's the deal man? Like why is it impossible to let

[02:03] people discuss my podcast on your site? And what would it take? What would it

[02:09] take to get Canada back on the Pinside as if it's like as if I'm this figure

[02:14] that all these grown men can't, can't stomach and can't handle? And you know he

[02:19] just kind of like piss me off because I want to I want to read you what he wrote

[02:23] to me because oftentimes the moderators and the Pinside sort of staff are able

[02:30] to operate underneath the community, right? And there's so much that goes on

[02:34] behind the scenes with private messages and different sort of communication

[02:40] that the rest of the people aren't privy to. So I just want to read you just some

[02:44] of this stuff that Robin said to me like word for word. He wrote, let me ask you

[02:48] what do you expect will happen if we were to let Canada back on the site? People

[02:54] wouldn't take the community rules or the moderation team seriously anymore. If

[02:58] Canada can get away with all he's done then anyone will think it's acceptable to

[03:03] troll, create duplicate accounts, ignore moderation instructions etc. Okay so

[03:09] let me stop there for a minute. This whole notion that the moderation team

[03:14] won't be taken seriously is a joke. Nobody does take the moderation team

[03:19] seriously and I'll tell you why and this is something you can't tell them. Here's

[03:23] here are a few reasons why you can't take the moderation team seriously. One of

[03:27] the moderation policies is that you can't question the moderation, right? Anyone

[03:34] ever go on there and if someone is like threat ejected or frozen for a day or

[03:38] kicked out and if you ask the moderators any question about why they did that,

[03:43] you too will be subject to the same punishment. It's like these people can

[03:48] operate with no checks and balances and that's ridiculous okay so look at

[03:53] the funny thing is these are grown men talking about pinball and you need to

[03:58] have these self-appointed deputies whose whose word is law and you can't

[04:03] question it. I mean come on how comical and ridiculous is that? So, Canada in

[04:09] that environment who sometimes questions their decisions is immediately the

[04:13] bad guy and that's fine like I'd much rather be the bad guy that actually

[04:18] wants people to have more free speech and the ability to question the way these

[04:22] guys moderate because look at look at there's a there was a recent sort of post

[04:29] that happened or thread that happened from save leaning tower and this we're

[04:34] gonna talk about this guy a little bit later because he's saving a bunch of

[04:36] pins but he clearly was had a few in him and started listing his pinball

[04:41] machines for sale and just started braiding all these people and it was funny I

[04:46] thought it was a steric role you know because he clearly he had a few in him and

[04:49] he was you know he's just like there's arguments about like New Jersey and

[04:54] people don't know what the hell pinball machines cost and telling the price police

[04:57] to fuck off I mean he was breaking every single rule in the in the pinside world

[05:02] and what happened did they ban them did they freeze them did they do anything

[05:06] no they they completely let him go wild and then they just went back and

[05:12] allowed him just to like erase what he's said and again it's that special

[05:16] treatment that they constantly do for certain individuals that everyone else

[05:20] picks up on so whatever like Robin forget forget that so the next thing he says

[05:26] to me like I said in an earlier message future site additions may create an

[05:32] opportunity in some way to have a presence but no promises okay if you keep up

[05:39] the good podcast and steer clear of creating more controversy surrounding

[05:43] yourself maybe in a year or so once memories start to fade we can talk about

[05:49] this all right so let's just stop there so look this I don't care Robin to

[05:59] adjust my podcast to fit your needs and that's what he's saying and he said this

[06:04] may have multiple occasions he doesn't like it when I call out members of

[06:08] pinside in this podcast he doesn't like it when I hold people to their words and

[06:13] to their actions on that site he doesn't he simply wants every podcast I make

[06:19] to be positive about pinball to be interviews and like we're gonna have plenty

[06:23] of those but I will not do that podcast and I won't be in a way like co-wurst

[06:31] into behaving just in case Robin might let me back on pinside in a year I mean

[06:37] seriously I'm already on Pidsride like five different ways and

[06:42] canada will never be an acceptable member of that community to those 20

[06:48] bullies and moderation team that run that site so that's all I want to say is

[06:52] for those of you who listen to this podcast I just want to say thank you thank

[06:57] you for tuning in and and I hope you enjoy the way we go at this hobby because

[07:02] it's not gonna be what Robin wants it's not gonna be what pinside wants and it

[07:06] just pissed me off that I got that on Friday and I also saw KPGs sort of

[07:10] constant moaning and groaning about ghost busters even after Gary Stern had had

[07:15] reached out to him so I just thought like enough is enough like the the site is

[07:18] run by a bunch of bias moderators and it's also got a bunch of grown men who

[07:23] just whining moon and and bitch all day long about pinball and and look I know

[07:28] what some of you are saying like canada you're such a hypocrite like you moaning

[07:32] grown in bitch about pinball too and you know what some of that is true I will I

[07:35] will say this I feed off of what goes on in that site and I use it as material

[07:40] to talk about the hobby because I do find it entertaining and I find it

[07:45] dramatic and it's much more entertaining than a lot of the other podcasts I

[07:50] listen to that just thrown on and on about tournament play and scoring and this

[07:56] and that for hours like I don't give a shit like I play pinball machine to have

[08:00] fun I play pinball machines to get through like the modes in the games and to

[08:05] see all this fun stuff happening on the playfield I'm not looking to put up

[08:09] like a billion points on ghost busters because you know what I don't really

[08:13] care so all right so let's sort of go back to a few of like what we were talking

[08:19] about and the first thing we're gonna go back to is just stern and the program

[08:23] details of ghost busters and that ghosted inserts I was expecting hopefully by

[08:28] now we would hear something officially from stern we haven't yet I still

[08:32] think people need to be patient but it's it's gotten to the point where the

[08:37] balls in our court right I mean I've lambasted the the people who are

[08:41] moaning and groaning about the details but now is it's time for stern hopefully

[08:46] this week to let us know what they're doing right what they are gonna do for

[08:51] ghost busters I was able to get in touch with with Dwight and I asked Dwight

[08:57] you know Dwight like are you going to listen to rare heroes feedback about the

[09:02] ladder system in the game and he was like you look man like canada like I get it

[09:07] like rare hero makes a lot of sense and I've heard him I mean he keeps saying it

[09:12] every day and I'm actually gonna put a special code in the game or mode for

[09:18] ghost busters called the FEMO and it's it's it's made for rare hero and it's

[09:23] it's at the it's after-state pop so he can get to it and unlock FEMO for rare

[09:28] hero it's worth 10 billion points and I asked him to describe what that mode is

[09:33] and here's what he said

[09:38] yeah I mean look Ghostbusters is getting such good reviews and the only issues

[09:46] seem to be these play field issues and I'm fully confident that stern is going to

[09:50] fix it and they are gonna make right on it and from what I've been hearing and

[09:54] this is not official but if you've got a chip play field they're gonna take

[09:59] care of you okay and premiums are not gonna ship until the fixes is in place

[10:05] so for all of you guys out there cancelling premium orders all you guys out

[10:09] there who are on the fence I wouldn't be too concerned I know the delays have

[10:14] been really really difficult to to accept this turn it doesn't normally make

[10:20] people wait this long for games but again in the larger scheme of things I think

[10:25] everybody just needs to cut them a break because stern has consistently shipped

[10:29] pins for years and is the only one who has done that so if if you were up to

[10:34] everybody else out there who said they're gonna get you a pinball machine you're

[10:38] usually waiting years and not months for them to get it right so it's actually a

[10:43] good segue into the other game that has been sort of shipping recently and that

[10:50] is the Big Lebowski so the Big Lebowski is sort of like you know I I think all

[11:00] you need to know about the Big Lebowski shipping is if you go to the thread

[11:04] on Pinside about it there's only six pages of comments okay six pages if

[11:11] Stern had a new pin shipping or new pin announcement there there would be 80

[11:17] pages of people talking about it so and the reason why is you know the Big Lebowski

[11:22] just doesn't seem to have many games going out the door from what I can tell in

[11:28] the first four months of them shipping pinball machines a total of 27 27 have

[11:37] been going out the door so far and whenever we saw pictures of the of the

[11:42] Dutch pinball factory it always seems really quiet so I called over there and I

[11:46] asked them I said hey guys like can you give me an explanation of why it's

[11:51] taking so long to get these pinballs to customers and and here's what they told

[11:55] me yeah it was kind of like a weird response I'm like I don't know what that has to

[12:07] do with like shipping pinball machines guys but all right that would Big Lebowski

[12:11] so it's it's going out there and people are unboxing it and did you guys see

[12:16] the story of the guy who he waits like three years for this pinball machine and

[12:22] the shipping company shows up to his house and is like parked down the block and

[12:28] they start unboxing the machine for him inside the truck and totally

[12:35] damage his back box and he by the time he answers the door expecting just the

[12:41] shipping guys to be there they they hand him the legs to the game and like the

[12:45] the baggy full of goodies and he's like what the fuck and he like goes down to

[12:50] the truck and sees like the back boxes all damaged they fucked up the speakers

[12:55] like popped out crazy crazy fucking story I've you know I've heard so many

[13:00] delivery horror stories but I've never seen a shipping company actually start to

[13:04] unbox it inside the truck before but what's even crazier is this guy like he

[13:10] accepts the delivery like what what are you doing like why would you sign

[13:15] for it and take the delivery I would have just keep this thing on the freaking

[13:20] truck you guys are fucked like I'm not signing for it and have the distributor

[13:25] deal with the shipping company but why would you take it into your home I the only

[13:30] thing I can imagine this guy was just wait I waited three years and it's like at

[13:35] it's it's it's here and it's I just want to play it I don't even care if there

[13:41] was like a damaged back box or what not I'm gonna play it so hopefully he gets

[13:46] everything taken care of it seemed like is a Melissa coin ticker was was was like

[13:50] gonna help him out so hopefully he gets a new back box and to me but anyway so

[13:54] big Lebowski's arriving and here's just my assessment I mean like the pin is

[13:59] beautiful that's we're not even gonna talk about that again but it just seems

[14:02] like there's like a lot of issues with this pinball machine new in box right and

[14:06] so I guess my question to you guys is what do you think about a pinball

[14:13] machine that has had two years two years of delays to get it right what do you

[14:21] think about a machine that's taken that long to come out finally comes out and

[14:25] consumers are having issues with it out of the box now we've heard so much from

[14:30] these guys about quality quality quality the machine does look like it's built

[14:36] like a tank but does that matter when it seems like I'm seeing a lot of people

[14:43] and again with only 27 out there these issues seem to be pretty prevalent but

[14:49] issues like the the bowling alley is not registering properly okay so that

[14:56] kind of sucks like you don't really want people to have to be taking a part

[14:59] that's bowling alley mechanism and you know finicking with the switches on it

[15:05] it seems like the rug doesn't really register well there's just one sort of

[15:10] switch on the rug and from one flipper it can register but from others it

[15:14] doesn't then sometimes it seems like it registers every time for guys and

[15:18] other games it doesn't register at all it looks like the I think the left ramp

[15:23] is doesn't really have support so it starts to sort of vibrate which causes

[15:27] the ball to lose momentum so these are just like three things that if you just

[15:31] look at three things they're like wow like why are these issues even in the

[15:37] game like didn't they play this machine so much to sort of identify these

[15:43] issues and make sure they were non issues by the time consumers got this

[15:46] machine and we see this all the time couple this with the fact that the code in

[15:52] the big Lebowski seems to still be like point four three or point four four

[15:56] and it just becomes like a real head scratcher and we saw this with Jersey Jack

[16:00] in the Hobbit in machines that have missed their shipping deadlines by

[16:05] sometimes two years how is it that they ship still with issues I mean you could

[16:11] even argue with Jack in the Hobbit the you know the rail on the left side the

[16:16] ball kept popping out of I mean how do you not fix that before shipping I mean

[16:21] aren't you playing your machine every day are people noticing that we see

[16:25] the same thing with Ghostbusters you know just the where is the testing on

[16:28] these modern machines before they shipped to consumers you know Ghostbusters

[16:33] with the air balls right with with the with the hopping over of the out lane on

[16:38] the left side even with the straight down the middle drains you know just like

[16:42] with slimer hitting the city buildings and you know scraping the the metal

[16:47] when he's moving like these like these issues that you just is anyone test

[16:54] driving these things properly before they are getting the green light to ship

[16:58] to consumers so you know I I think that anyone who buys the inaugural pin of a new

[17:03] company should expect to have issues I mean it is the first time they're doing it

[17:09] the first time they're shipping it the first time they're boxing it up the first

[17:13] time they're putting an assembly line together all those things you know there's

[17:16] there's no muscle memory in that company yet like they're they're doing

[17:19] everything for the first time so you know you're guinea pig and you're guinea

[17:25] pig that's getting something that no one else has so I think owners are

[17:30] probably willing to put up with some more of these headaches because of that

[17:33] fact you know I don't think we saw too many issues with full throttle when that

[17:37] ship that was highway pinballs first machine so and I think that's good I think

[17:41] you know think highway from the owners you have full throttle all five of you

[17:45] you guys have articulated that the build quality is there and that things

[17:50] haven't really been problematic so I think that that's that's a good sign but

[17:55] look I think that the big Lebowski and Dutch pinball is is a great pin I just

[18:01] I don't know how this company survives unless they get their volume of

[18:04] shipping up how can they how can you send out so few machines and have all these

[18:10] employees and have a factory and and have it work I heard from a little birdie

[18:17] months ago and I will not get a name who it was and he's from someone who worked

[18:22] in a very very successful pinball company you can take your guess which one that

[18:25] is basically said Dutch pinball is contract manufacturing these machines

[18:31] because of that they will never survive they will never survive under that

[18:36] model and I I mean I don't know how they're gonna survive with this volume but

[18:40] look the game's been two years in delay and I just want to see code further along

[18:45] I want to I want I you know when it's here people describe this game it's like

[18:51] it's hard because the owners will always justify the purchase they're always

[18:55] gonna say it's great they're always gonna say they love it I mean I see guys

[18:57] who put up post they list all the things they're wrong with it all the

[19:01] annoyances all the problems mechanically all the problems with the code the

[19:04] shortfalls with it and then like but I love the pin so it's like like I don't

[19:09] know for 10 grand I don't want something that needs like a lot of fixes and I

[19:13] don't want to have to wait for the code to be finalized I think for ten thousand

[19:17] dollars and a premium product like that stuff needs to be fixed and fixed soon

[19:20] so we're gonna see I think it's gonna be an interesting year I think you know

[19:25] because now that it's shipping like is Dutch got another game in you know in

[19:30] it's arsenal are are they gonna even start to tease game number two and can they

[19:34] get the big Lebowski to the vomit needs to be for that company to succeed so

[19:38] that's gonna be something we should look at all right so alien pinball so just a

[19:43] quick little alien news here Andrew has been communicating with the the form and

[19:50] the community which always is a sign that things are close I think he is done a

[19:55] good job and sort of not talking when there's nothing to talk about so here's

[19:59] what we know is gonna happen the alien pinball machine is going to be revealed

[20:05] Thursday at 9.30 p.m. at expo in October in Chicago which sucks because I think

[20:14] I'm coming into expo on Friday so I'm going to miss that reveal I maybe I

[20:18] should ask oric if he'll hold it a day for me I'm sure he would no but I

[20:23] liked what I saw in the thread because here here's what typically happens with a

[20:27] lot of these expos sometimes these companies will show stuff and reveal stuff

[20:32] and make announcements and those announcements won't be captured for people who

[20:38] are not at the show to see and additionally when you want to see a game revealed

[20:44] you want to see the play field you want to see assets you want to see everything

[20:49] in the best possible quality right you want to see HD video you want to see HD

[20:56] photos you don't want to see some crappy cell phone pictures as the first

[21:02] way you see it when alien reveal the play field for the first time remember

[21:06] someone like took a cell phone snapshot of like a banner of the play field or a

[21:10] flyer and it looked like shit when we finally got high-rise images it was it was

[21:16] much much better man look I still don't like the art on it but whatever but I

[21:21] think Andrew has listened and and to the people's comments that when you

[21:26] reveal at that moment so 9.30 Thursday they're also going to have the assets

[21:32] go out to the world so people can see it and I think that's a really smart

[21:36] thing I think it's basic marketing 101 have all of your stuff ready to go

[21:41] Stern's really good at that they always have their reveals locked and loaded

[21:46] they usually launch with a major media outlet and then they have press release

[21:50] and then they have all the different high-rise images for people to look at so

[21:54] look they're not going to hit their no their September ship date so can

[21:59] they do remember I said I'm not going to do a podcast if they ship in September

[22:02] so I'll be safe but look I'm excited to see what happens with alien pinball I

[22:08] think if they can ship that machine and ship it in volume you know I think it

[22:14] can be a contender and we'll see always interesting to see a dentist

[22:18] Norman pin come to light even though he came off the project early a lot of his

[22:23] design is still going to be in there and it's a it's a killer theme and there's

[22:27] there's no there's no denying that alien is just an incredible theme for pinball

[22:31] all right so something else that like just won't go away and this is I mean we

[22:37] cover this but like every time I go back to the message board I just keep seeing

[22:40] people talk about J-pop and discussing J-pop and they're just certain guys

[22:48] on there that they could just I don't think they can accept that they got

[22:53] burned you know you got guys like fraw like clearly got burned financially then

[22:59] you got guys like iceman like why does he even give a shit like he doesn't even

[23:02] have any money like he like he dodged a bullet on it and he says it and there

[23:08] there are some of us that were in the same boat as him like we want it John to

[23:12] take our money because we wanted a magic girl and we were all just sort of

[23:16] blown away by the art but why why do people continue to sort of speculate I

[23:23] saw Ben heck came in and talked about his his connection to John back in the

[23:28] day when when John was gonna make the zombie adventure game about Ben heck but

[23:32] it's all been said it's been said over and over and over again I think John has

[23:36] blown through all the money and I think we can see where John's money went

[23:41] but you know look I said all these guys they spent so much energy on the

[23:45] message board does anyone even look like call up Zidware and call up the

[23:48] number there and and ask them like look is there a chance these games are gonna

[23:53] come out so that's what I did and you know I call them hey John hey John magic

[23:57] girl Raza Alzmannerland is there a chance we might see any of these games in

[24:01] the future and in here's what he said to me I'm busy tonight dickie dear I

[24:06] mean I I don't know if he's still tinkering on stuff if you go to Zidware's

[24:12] website it still says 2016 on it now and it's just I don't know it's a shame I

[24:19] feel bad for everyone who lost money on and him and Skippy but you know I think

[24:24] these guys are also just sort of punishing themselves by continuing to to talk

[24:29] about it all the time I think you need to just let it go and and and that's all

[24:35] I want to say about that so what else happened in Pimball since we last talked I

[24:39] did catch spooky pinballs dominoes pizza reveal on twitch dead flip and jack

[24:48] danger going over there to play the machine I'm gonna talk more about that later

[24:53] this week because I'm actually going to interview Blake who did the artwork for

[24:59] dominoes pinball so I'm really excited to talk to him about that and gonna save

[25:05] my thoughts to then I mean I I want to hear from you guys like what did you guys

[25:08] if you guys saw like what did you think of dominoes and if you have any questions

[25:12] you want me to ask Blake I'm probably talking to him in a couple days so if you

[25:16] can email me at canada pinball at gmail.com that would be great you know I'll

[25:23] say this about spooky and and and I sort of said this before is like I think

[25:27] spooky has really carved out that boutique niche I think they're at a price

[25:32] point that works for them I don't know how they're going to do if they stop

[25:40] making limited machines I think that the limited nature of it is what creates

[25:46] the demand and I think if they just sell dominoes pinball machines anyone can

[25:52] order one can get one it's gonna be interesting to see how many they sell a

[25:56] fun game novelty game yes will people buy it who knows who knows I think if

[26:05] you have machines in box ready to go yes because from if I if I've learned

[26:10] anything from this hobby people just are obsessed with open amp something

[26:14] that's cardboard and seeing something brand new inside and then they bitch in

[26:18] monew when there's like a switch out but but that's the predominant behavior of

[26:23] the modern day collector that I've seen all right so what I wanted to do to

[26:28] close out this episode is just talk about a few pinball machines that are

[26:33] for sale I think we're gonna do this quite frequently now and can you just

[26:37] pinball podcasts be like here's what's on the market so for you for you guys who

[26:40] are not scouring the for sale threads are all over the place we will sort of

[26:45] categorize a few of them that I think are quite interestingly priced all right

[26:50] so leading off our list is the most expensive one by far and a big bang bar in

[26:58] Nashville Tennessee went up for sale this week for $16,000 and we look at

[27:05] big bang bar obviously we all know the story behind this Capcom machine and

[27:10] how rare it is and how no one ever thought it was actually gonna see the light

[27:13] of day happy to announce that black night will be coming back on the show

[27:17] sometime in the future to talk about the big bang bar history because I think

[27:21] it's it's it's one that most of us know the limited nature of the machine and

[27:26] the high price of it but don't really know everything it took for that game to

[27:31] come to fruition so $16,000 and it says that sale is pending on it so this

[27:38] machine still is warranting top top dollar I mean we've seen these things go

[27:43] anywhere from I mean 16 seems to be the around the price for these things move

[27:50] we've seen them go higher I've seen ones go for closer to 20 and new in box you

[27:55] have people that are asking like $30,000 for them so I would say this about

[28:00] big bang bar if you've played it I think you will realize quickly that it's a

[28:05] really interesting machine it's it's cool to look at it's a really unique

[28:09] theme it's look it's not the most amazing pinball machine and I think it gets

[28:15] maybe unfairly like hate it on because people are pissed off at how

[28:20] expensive it is so I think people go into a big bang bar experience like

[28:25] expecting it to be like three times more fun because it's three times the

[28:29] price and with those expectations you're always going to be disappointed I think

[28:35] it's fun I don't know if any pinball machine is $16,000 fun but let's be

[28:41] honest here it's not about that this is not about gameplay this is not about

[28:45] anything other than I have a big bang bar alright you walk into my

[28:50] collection and you see a big bang bar and you're like this guy's serious he's got

[28:53] one of the rarest pinball machines ever one of the most expensive pinball

[28:56] machines ever guys who have big bang bars have kingpin envy and king Kong envy

[29:02] that that's the cremdola crem of the collecting community but look sale

[29:08] pending so the market has deemed 16 grand to be the right price for a big bang

[29:13] bar all right this other pin interesting price here and then again these are

[29:18] going to be like games that are for sale that we can comment on and and happy to

[29:22] hear your guys take on it as well so the walking dead pro there's one for sale

[29:26] in Chicago that's heavily modded for $6,495 now correct me from wrong but a

[29:34] walking dead pro is never $6,495 right I mean that that is usually the price

[29:40] for the premium I I just think people are out of their minds and I'm gonna

[29:47] price police here when you throw in like a thousand or two thousand dollars

[29:52] mods in a game if you think you're gonna get that money back and there's just

[29:56] no way in a million years I would drop on a pro the same amount of money that I

[30:02] could get a premium any game like the walking dead and in any pin I mean

[30:07] there's a pro is a pro is a pro right it's like you can slap a supercharger on

[30:14] a on a three series BMW but it's never gonna be like an M3 you know it's like

[30:20] you want the premiums and the LEDs are designed with the best features and

[30:25] they did pros no matter how modic can never really reach that that level I

[30:29] just think it's funny to how people and you still see it all the time like

[30:33] they just they don't want to take anything less than what they paid for their

[30:37] machine even when they're used and we're gonna talk a little about about that in a

[30:40] second so the next one I saw that was interesting and I expected to see more of

[30:46] these and I think people have held off because of the ghosted insert issue but

[30:51] there are two Ghostbusters LEDs that are on the marketplace right now one is for

[30:56] 8700 in Omaha Nebraska and it's basically like no shipping like cash and

[31:02] hand come pick it up got it in box and another is for sale for $9,400 you know

[31:09] like we in full transparency I have a Ghostbusters LED that I'm waiting to get

[31:13] it should have no issues as Stern is halted the line I have someone on the hook

[31:19] to buy it for $9,500 and these things like these things have sold anywhere from

[31:25] you know $8,500 all the way to $10,000 for a new in box GBLE and as much as

[31:31] people say the hype is gonna die down the hype is gonna die down I don't think

[31:35] Ghostbusters LEDs will ever sell from much less than the $8,000 MSRP that

[31:41] people are paying on it simply because there's only $2,500 in America is such a

[31:45] hot title it is the most amazing art package if I were pricing a Ghostbusters

[31:51] LED at this stage I would price it high I think there are far more buyers out

[31:56] there to then exist on Pinside and a lot of people you can see it like they're

[32:01] like kind of afraid that the the the the Pinside price police if they see them

[32:07] listed high will like respond like this but look I guarantee you when premium

[32:17] starts shipping and Stern fixes like the few issues they're having and this

[32:21] game gets you know goes down as like one of the most fun games and in most

[32:27] complete packages Stern has ever released I think it's gonna be highly sought

[32:31] after it's also gonna be like the last DMD game from Stern ever whether that

[32:35] means it's gonna be sought after or not is still to be determined but it's

[32:41] Ghostbusters and there's not many themes are this awesome and you're not gonna

[32:45] get many zombie Eddie art package machines from Stern or anyone else so I think

[32:50] it's gonna be a special one that's gonna hold its value pretty nicely all

[32:53] right let's see this one was interesting so this guy he's a Nashville too

[32:58] there's seems to be like a lot of collectors in Nashville his name is Rob Ooz I

[33:03] think that's what you say it but he wants to trade his Tron Ellie for a big

[33:07] Lebowski and I'm just want to write sorry read what he wrote he said looking to

[33:12] trade my Tron Ellie for a big Lebowski pinball I'm the original owner of number

[33:17] 45 Tron Ellie has many mods that include color DMD arcade mod flin signs

[33:22] speaker led kit Mike Chestnut lockdown bar only looking to trade for the big

[33:27] Lebowski still have the original box if you want it PM for pics so that that's

[33:31] an interesting trade you if Lebowski right now the what the what is the the

[33:39] addition the early adopter edition where they call it it just slipped my mind

[33:44] but they're they're shipping only the pre-ordered ones first that come with

[33:51] the rug and and that's it I don't think there's anything else that these

[33:55] pre-ordered ones get the see someone people were saying like the steel trim

[33:59] now that's that's standard on this 10,000 R pin so look Tron Ellie is also right

[34:06] around that price point right nine thousand dollars ten thousand dollars twelve

[34:09] thousand dollars like the price fluctuates depending on the condition of the

[34:13] pin and how how many mods it has because Tron is definitely one where you want to

[34:19] put some of those those mods like the flin sign and the arcade mod what I do

[34:25] this trade if I were on either side so I don't think anybody who's waited three

[34:30] years for big Lebowski's gonna cough it up for Tron Ellie it doesn't say that he

[34:35] wants the big Lebowski new in box of maybe someone you got a big Lebowski early

[34:40] who's not happy with it might say themselves like I've also always wanted a

[34:45] Tron and and I'll make the trade now I mean Tron is is a proven winner and big

[34:50] Lebowski is unproven and that's that's another big thing right as you the

[34:54] hype train on the Lebowski has left the station and I think people are waiting

[34:59] for this pin to actually be incredible with with code and whatnot and and have

[35:04] the gameplay that matches like the aesthetic appeal of the machine so what I

[35:10] do it what I do it personally I honestly I'm just not excited by older

[35:17] Sterns at this point I really think the future of pinball over the next few

[35:23] years is gonna be what's most exciting and I think all the new pins shipping are

[35:26] much more exciting to me than having a Tron Ellie and look Tron Ellie was great

[35:32] and it had a good run at being like the pin everybody wanted I just don't think

[35:37] people are gonna want these pins a few years from now I not at the level that

[35:43] they've been going at I think all these Sterns are going to decrease in value by

[35:49] a couple thousand dollars I just don't think you're gonna see people

[35:53] clamoring to get a secondhand version of stuff for sticker or more than

[35:58] sticker price for people so I would keep my big Lebowski I just would it's just

[36:04] the newer pin even though Tron's proven I wouldn't have waited three years just

[36:07] to go get something that's always available like you just can't go get a big

[36:11] Lebowski if you put an order and now it might take you like a year to get one

[36:15] or more so I think that's why this trade is pretty interesting all right so the

[36:21] last for sale and and and it's this guy is selling a lot of pins saved leaning

[36:28] tower in New Jersey I'm actually trying to get him on the show to talk about

[36:31] all of these sales and and why he sort of sort of clearing out a lot of his

[36:36] collection but you know this is the guy that I talked about the beginning of

[36:41] the show who completely went off to handle when selling his pins and I

[36:46] understand why I mean this guy's got beautiful stuff and when you have beautiful

[36:49] stuff that's freshly restored or mint and has a lot of money in it and you're

[36:56] sort of asking what you think is a fair price you're gonna get the price

[36:59] police just coming after you but the one that really he had like a a scared

[37:05] stiff that he was asking a lot for I think it might have sold and then he has a

[37:10] medieval madness this one's interesting so medieval madness it's beautiful it's

[37:14] got like all brass from Mike Chessna it's it's it's the original

[37:19] medieval madness it's not the remake it looks like you could eat off it but

[37:25] here's the price 13,500 dollars for it 13,500 dollars for an original

[37:33] medieval madness you can get a new remake a new in box for what nine grand it's

[37:43] tough though it's tough because medieval madness remake has such hideous armor

[37:48] the the the when they said gold people thought it was gonna be like gold like

[37:53] brass and be beautiful and it looks like throw up mustard on the thing it's

[37:59] horrible and as someone who's brass played it a game it's not cheap so you're

[38:04] looking at a lot of money there I don't know though you know with medieval

[38:10] madness remake having the colored dots which are epic and not available on

[38:13] the original I start to think the remake is the better buy and I'm not saying

[38:19] that this guy's machine is not gorgeous I just don't think people with

[38:22] 13,500 dollars who want a medieval madness are gonna be like yeah but he's

[38:28] also selling like a ton of stuff so you guys are like looking for stuff I mean

[38:31] he's selling a Guns and Roses for 5,500 a Twilight Zone for 9,500 I mean

[38:37] that's an expensive Twilight Zone he has a was new in box ruby

[38:41] red that he's not even open for 9,100 dollars I mean but that's pretty much

[38:47] the same price as buying it from Jack these other two are interesting to

[38:54] Star Trek Ellie for 8,250 in Metallica Ellie for 8,250 now so those prices

[39:02] homies only Star Trek in Metallica that's more than those pins cost new so do

[39:07] you guys think that Stern Ellie's from a few years ago have retained an

[39:13] increased in value the market would tell you over the last few years yes that

[39:17] has been the case but I firmly believe in the next year that all that's gonna

[39:24] go away I just do I mean again like these are just like old Star Trek like I

[39:29] don't know like when Star Wars hits like who's gonna want Star Trek Ghostbusters

[39:33] is a better steam than Star Trek and get if you're a Trekkie like yeah like

[39:36] Metallica's been a darling pin it's proven pin it's a great pin but you know

[39:42] if you have $8,000 I just don't think you can buy these pins play them then

[39:47] expect to get what you paid or more from them why I mean are there that many

[39:52] collectors but as those collectors want to get something that is talked about

[39:57] and awesome they're gonna go buy what's new they're gonna go buy Alien you can't

[40:02] tell me that more people are gonna be excited about Star Trek when like Alien

[40:05] comes out with with its HD screen and and fiber optic you know ramps and and call

[40:12] out from the films and based on a movie that's far better than the Star Trek

[40:16] movie that that pin is based on so you know we'll see I mean this guys got a lot

[40:21] on the market I just think that the bubble is going to burst on some of these

[40:25] turns from the last like five to 10 years I really really do all right so that

[40:31] is episode 46 of Canada's Pinball podcast now we're gonna be back this week with

[40:38] an interview with Blake who did the artwork on spooky's Domino Pinball so check
