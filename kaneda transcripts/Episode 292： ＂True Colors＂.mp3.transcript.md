[00:00] So show me a smile, yeah

[00:04] And don't be unhappy, can't remember when

[00:09] Now, last time you laughing

[00:12] If this world makes you crazy and you take it now

[00:16] You can't bear, you call me up

[00:19] Because you know I'll be there

[00:22] And I'll see you

[00:24] Who know what it's time to

[00:28] I see no joy

[00:31] I'll try to lose the world we've had

[00:38] I can show you

[00:41] Who know

[00:42] keep looking at us

[00:45] People will listen to us

[00:48] The left-air

[00:51] I love that song

[00:53] something about Cindy's voice and those lyrics that are just timeless, right?

[00:59] I have a good friend and he always says to me, a good song is better than any marketing

[01:06] in the world and he works in advertising and he always says that because he's also in

[01:10] a band and his music means more to him than anything else.

[01:15] Now I want to talk to you guys right now.

[01:16] It's 6 o'clock in the morning in New York City.

[01:20] It's raining out and it's a Friday and I had an incredible evening last night in a wake-up

[01:26] and I was just reading Pinside and there's all this negative stuff being said about

[01:31] Canadian Spinball podcasts and all these people saying, you know, things about me and I just

[01:37] want to address it because I think it's important because you know I can't defend myself

[01:43] and that's something that's very interesting when you think about it, right?

[01:46] I am banned by the world's number one pinball forum.

[01:52] How ironic is just that, right?

[01:55] The number one pinball podcast in the world, which is this one, which you guys voted on,

[02:00] is banned from even representing himself on the number one forum.

[02:06] Now look, there is a lot of personal vitriol that gets spewed on Pinside and I don't have

[02:12] any personal angst against anybody on there.

[02:16] I don't know really anyone on there.

[02:19] I don't know them, right?

[02:20] I don't know crazy levy very well.

[02:23] I've seen him a few times at a bars in New York City.

[02:26] He seems like a really good guy and I think he is a really good guy.

[02:29] I don't know Doug Iceman, you know down in Texas.

[02:34] He seems really passionate about pinball and that's cool, right?

[02:38] I mean, I don't really know Hilton.

[02:40] I don't know these people, right?

[02:42] And so I know one thing about all of them that they care a lot about pinball and that's

[02:48] like the common denominator that connects all of us, right?

[02:53] And so because I know that, I know that there's going to be a lot of opinions and things

[02:59] said about me.

[03:00] Now what I want you guys to do is this.

[03:03] I'm banned from Pinside.

[03:05] Do you know why I'm banned from Pinside?

[03:07] It's funny because people say like I saw Iceman say this.

[03:11] Go back and look at the history of Canada.

[03:14] Go back and you understand why.

[03:17] And I think what's funny about that is if you go back and you read my post and you read

[03:24] what I've said and you read why I was banned, you won't really find anything truly incriminating.

[03:32] You won't.

[03:33] And that's the ultimate hypocrisy of it all.

[03:38] And it's what led to the creation of this podcast.

[03:41] And I think better things have come.

[03:44] And this is true.

[03:45] Better things have come from me leaving this site unwillingly and being forced to have

[03:52] this podcast be the only way I can talk to you about pinball.

[03:58] Okay.

[03:59] And it's good.

[04:00] Like I think you've benefited.

[04:01] I think I've benefited.

[04:03] I don't think hyper posting on Pinside benefits.

[04:07] Anybody very well.

[04:08] But here's what's really funny is the hyper post is on Pinside.

[04:12] The people who care the most who have the most to say about pinball.

[04:17] There's one place they won't say it.

[04:20] And that's on this show.

[04:23] And I've extended the invite to Doug, aka Iceman.

[04:28] I've extended the invite to Crazy Levy.

[04:31] I've extended the invite to Hilton.

[04:34] And they won't come on the show.

[04:35] Now look.

[04:36] Most people who talk a lot about pinball have no problem coming on this show.

[04:43] You all right.

[04:44] And yes, I get it.

[04:45] There are going to be certain industry people that will avoid this show.

[04:49] And let me tell you right now.

[04:51] It is a mistake to avoid the show if you're trying to sell your game.

[04:56] There is absolutely no benefit to you to avoid coming on this show.

[05:01] And for you who listen to this show, 290 plus episodes of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[05:08] Look at every interview.

[05:10] Look how good, every company, every person, and every product that is talked about on this

[05:18] show.

[05:19] Look how good it comes across.

[05:21] Right.

[05:22] P3 comes across great when Jerry comes on and talks about it.

[05:25] Christopher Branchy comes on and talks about his games.

[05:27] They look great.

[05:28] Zombie Eddie.

[05:29] They look great.

[05:31] They look great.

[05:32] Come on the show that's their prerogative.

[05:34] I don't lose sleep over it.

[05:37] That's another thing that I just want to say to you guys because it's early in the morning

[05:41] and I'm going to tell you how I truly feel.

[05:45] I don't care if pinball people in the manufacturing and the pinball companies don't come on this

[05:51] show.

[05:52] I don't care.

[05:53] It's not that I don't respect these gentlemen.

[05:56] I respect them tremendously.

[05:58] But if they don't want to come on the show, that's on them.

[06:02] It's not, I'm not losing sleep over it.

[06:04] I don't care.

[06:05] They can go do every other pinball podcast out there.

[06:08] You can hear them interviewed by every other pinball podcast out there.

[06:12] But this pinball podcast doesn't exist to only do interviews.

[06:17] And here's the thing.

[06:19] Remove interviews from the other pinball podcast that are out there.

[06:23] Remove them.

[06:24] Do you even, do they even exist then?

[06:26] And they even survive.

[06:28] But why are you listening right now to me?

[06:31] Talk about pinball.

[06:32] Why?

[06:33] I think I know why.

[06:35] And I'll take a guess.

[06:37] Because I think this podcast tries to talk about the industry and the hobby differently.

[06:44] And I think I try to approach it differently.

[06:47] And it's not just about entertainment.

[06:49] If it was only entertainment, this show is not the funniest all the time.

[06:53] Right?

[06:54] It's not my last podcast because I didn't find it that funny.

[06:57] I was trying to make it funny.

[06:59] And I'm going to talk a little bit about Jersey Jack on this podcast because I think what

[07:02] I said is very important.

[07:03] And I'm going to say it a little bit differently.

[07:06] But before it get there, I just, I love the fact that so many people try to get to me,

[07:14] try to attack me.

[07:15] But here's the thing.

[07:16] I'm here to tell you right now the list.

[07:17] And this show's not going away.

[07:19] This show's not changing.

[07:20] This show's not holding punches.

[07:22] But I do want to address a few things directly because I saw this posted when Iceman's boasting

[07:28] about playing his alien pinball machine, which he thinks is great.

[07:33] And he's blaming me for highway pinball going under.

[07:38] And everyone would have their alien pinball machine if it wasn't for Canada.

[07:42] All right.

[07:43] Let me talk about that for a few seconds or minutes.

[07:46] Hold on.

[07:47] How did I destroy highway pinball?

[07:50] Did I make decisions for that company?

[07:53] Did I do anything to lose you your money?

[07:56] All I did was when that individual, Andrew Highway, was convincing you everything was fine

[08:04] with this company.

[08:05] I said you should look twice.

[08:07] You should look at the videos, the photos, everything that he's done.

[08:11] And you should really ask yourself should I be investing in this company because there's

[08:16] a good chance you might lose your money.

[08:17] And guess what?

[08:18] If you listen to me, you saved your money.

[08:21] And if you didn't, you lost your money at that later stage.

[08:24] Right?

[08:25] I'm talking about the last year.

[08:27] If you go back and listen to my alien day podcast, it was really the last year of highway

[08:33] pinball where the most nefarious things were being said by that company.

[08:38] Remember when they put up the video of the assembly line, guys wearing, winter hats with

[08:43] screwdrivers?

[08:44] It was all staged to make you believe everything was fine.

[08:48] Look, it's gone.

[08:50] The company's gone.

[08:51] Andrew's gone.

[08:52] Those things are gone.

[08:54] But I told you that they were in trouble.

[08:58] And you know who told you Kim Mitchell, other people were trying to tell you things.

[09:02] All right?

[09:03] Same thing with Dutch pinball.

[09:04] But I don't want to, you guys know all this.

[09:07] But it's crazy to me that some people really blame me for how these companies collapsed.

[09:15] Did I make any of their business decisions for them?

[09:18] Did I have shut up?

[09:20] All right?

[09:21] Okay.

[09:22] Now, let me talk about Jersey Jack.

[09:25] All right?

[09:26] And you're going to get, this is, again, it's early in the morning.

[09:28] I'm just going to talk candidly to you.

[09:31] Like no other pinball podcasts can do a podcast like this because they won't because they want

[09:36] to get Jersey Jack on the show.

[09:38] But here's a deal.

[09:39] I don't want to get Jersey Jack on the show.

[09:42] He's invited on the show at any point.

[09:45] Eric is invited on the show at any point.

[09:48] Keith is invited on the show at any point.

[09:51] But if they don't want to do the show, I don't care because I want to tell you how I really

[09:54] feel.

[09:56] And then they're going to listen and they're not going to want to do the show.

[09:58] And here's the crazy thing.

[10:00] Is people always tell me this, you know, crazy levy told me this.

[10:02] I can't do your show now because it would offend Tim who you threw a drink in his face.

[10:08] Okay?

[10:09] That's cool.

[10:10] But like Keith not want to do the show or Eric or Jack.

[10:13] Do they not want to do the show because if they do the show, does it validate the show?

[10:18] That's the only reason they won't come on because it validates this show.

[10:23] But here's the crazy thing.

[10:25] This show doesn't need validation.

[10:27] You know who validates this show every week?

[10:30] You do.

[10:32] You listening to this validates that this is the world's number one pinball podcast.

[10:40] You validate it.

[10:41] And it's not about listeners.

[10:43] It's not about this.

[10:44] It's not about it's the fact that there's one pinball podcast that matters the most.

[10:49] And look, and this is not me saying it.

[10:51] It's you saying it.

[10:53] You're saying it in the pin-side thread.

[10:55] You say it by listening every.

[10:56] Okay.

[10:57] Let me get back.

[10:58] So Jersey Jack, they're invited on all of them.

[11:03] And I literally, I took down the last episode.

[11:05] It wasn't that great, but I'm going to summarize it for you now if you didn't hear it.

[11:11] Jersey Jack pinball is on their fourth game.

[11:15] And you know my feelings around pirates.

[11:19] Okay.

[11:20] I just think it's too complex.

[11:22] I think it's too hard for people to figure out.

[11:26] But I still think people are enjoying it and they're having fun.

[11:28] But that's not my issue with pirates right now.

[11:31] My issue with Jersey Jack pinball is they are on game number four.

[11:35] All right.

[11:36] This is in game number one.

[11:38] And they are charging a premium price for pinball.

[11:42] The collector's edition is $12,500.

[11:45] All right.

[11:46] That is a very expensive pinball product.

[11:49] They're shipping this game to customers with just really mind-boggling like problems.

[11:57] Okay.

[11:58] Number one, they don't drill the holes for the topper in your game.

[12:04] So you have to after buying a $12,500 game from Jersey Jack pinball, you have to drill

[12:11] your own holes on the top of the machine.

[12:15] What do you think of that?

[12:16] You think that's a good decision, all right?

[12:19] They also shipped Richie Ranch, who's the number one collector's edition guy.

[12:25] Number one by far.

[12:26] This guy is like, he's obsessed with collector's edition games from Jersey Jack.

[12:30] They ship him his game with a pop bumper cat missing.

[12:34] Okay.

[12:35] All that really says to me is, well, who's looking over these games?

[12:38] Like these premium edition games.

[12:41] There's only 250 collector's editions that how do you make that mistake?

[12:46] Another gentleman who bought a collector's edition, he received his game with no levelers

[12:52] for his legs.

[12:53] So he can't set up his game.

[12:55] It's a Christmas gift.

[12:56] He can't set it up.

[12:57] He can't level the game properly because there's no leg levelers.

[13:00] Literally a $5 part that is necessary for him to play his $12,500 machine isn't included

[13:08] in the box.

[13:09] And I know, look, mistakes are made, but at this stage in the game, those kinds of mistakes,

[13:17] to me are indicative that Jersey Jack is probably rushing these games out the door and

[13:23] that's a problem.

[13:24] And look, if me saying that means they're not going to come on this show, then I don't

[13:28] give a shit.

[13:29] I'd rather them not come on the show.

[13:32] So I can tell you what a fucking joke it is that on game four, Jersey Jack is making

[13:38] people drill holes to put their top on top of the collector's edition.

[13:43] If you have a stern game and you don't have to drill your own holes, do you?

[13:49] You don't have to like figure out where the top or goes.

[13:52] You don't have to center it properly.

[13:54] The company does it for you.

[13:56] The company gives you instructions.

[13:58] And I give stern a lot of shit and I am not a stern, chill fanboy on any level.

[14:04] In fact, I'm about to do a whole podcast about what Zack Sharp said about Pimball Fun

[14:11] Equalling Value.

[14:12] I mean, this show is going to be great when I do it.

[14:15] And I asked Zack to come on the show and Zack declined.

[14:19] But he did send me a statement about what he means when he says that fun equals value

[14:27] and Pimball.

[14:28] And it's going to be a good show.

[14:30] And you're going to have to wait for it and see what I'm going to say.

[14:35] But we're on game four with Jersey Jack.

[14:37] And as I said too, I want Jersey Jack Pimball to succeed more than anybody.

[14:45] Anybody.

[14:46] And I think Jack has the potential to make the greatest Pimball games of all time.

[14:53] And we're not there yet.

[14:55] And look, pirates of the Caribbean.

[14:57] I see this on Pinside.

[14:59] People are like, canators butt hurt because the game's actually phenomenal.

[15:03] And I want to talk about that for a second.

[15:06] For you people out there saying that Pirates of the Caribbean is phenomenal.

[15:10] Here's what I want to say to you.

[15:12] Great.

[15:13] I'm happy you enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:18] I'm happy you think it's phenomenal.

[15:21] I want you to have fun with the game and think it's great if you buy it.

[15:26] That's always going to be my sentiment on all Pimball machines.

[15:31] I don't think you're a dope or an idiot for buying Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:35] My issue with Pirates of the Caribbean is quite simply and I'm not going to rehash this

[15:41] a lot.

[15:42] I just think the game is too complex.

[15:44] It's too confusing.

[15:46] It requires a manual to understand.

[15:49] So that's one thing.

[15:50] The other thing.

[15:52] I think the ship rocking constantly makes no sense.

[15:56] I think the way the ball falls off the right side of that upper playfield is terrible design.

[16:03] Terrible.

[16:04] It is such a want, want, like moment in that game that I don't understand.

[16:09] Do you like that?

[16:11] You enjoy that?

[16:12] Does anyone enjoy the ball just trickling off the side of the upper playfield like that?

[16:16] So I just think it's walkie design.

[16:19] I also don't want to slap the locked down bar button to collect gold.

[16:25] I don't find that fun, matey's sorry.

[16:29] That's just my opinion.

[16:31] I think the music's incredible.

[16:34] I think the light show is incredible.

[16:37] I think the artwork is all right.

[16:39] I don't think it's as good as French.

[16:41] You would have done it, but it looks like French, but it's not.

[16:44] It's like drawn over photography.

[16:47] Nothing to write home about with the artwork.

[16:49] The spinning discs and the treasure chest.

[16:53] My overall assessment is the game looks phenomenal.

[16:58] It looks phenomenal.

[16:59] You walk up to pirates and the game looks phenomenal.

[17:03] Then you play the game and it's whatever.

[17:05] You either like it or you don't, but here's my thing.

[17:08] All the stuff I'm seeing, you tell me what's the magical thing that happens in that game?

[17:14] What is the one magical thing in Pirates of the Caribbean?

[17:20] And I will never do another show again.

[17:22] The ball does nothing magical.

[17:25] It's a pirate game.

[17:26] It's a fucking pirate game.

[17:28] All right, the cannon shot, which I don't really even know how to do or load, and 99

[17:35] percent of people who walk up to that game will never even experience a cannon shot.

[17:40] And that's great design.

[17:43] You made a game about a pirate theme.

[17:46] And for 99 percent of people who walk up to it, they will never experience shooting a

[17:52] pinball out of a pirate cannon.

[17:55] And that's to me.

[17:56] That just says it all.

[17:58] If I have to summarize this podcast, how terrible you guys think it is and can it or

[18:03] won't shut up, let me literally, how do you sit in a room at Jersey Jack Pinball and

[18:11] you tell me you're designed for a pirate's pinball machine.

[18:15] And you're telling me that most people who step up to this game will never experience

[18:21] shooting the ball out of a pirate cannon.

[18:24] But it's going to be in there, but we're going to bury it inside some upper playfield.

[18:29] You have to hit the targets or the spinners.

[18:31] Like no one really knows, right?

[18:33] And sure, even when you do know, is it intuitive?

[18:37] Is it for anyone who walks up to that machine?

[18:40] There's a fucking cannon in ACDC.

[18:45] Right?

[18:46] That is so much easier to understand how to fire it.

[18:49] And if you play ACDC and don't even know what the fuck you're doing, chances are you

[18:55] will fucking fire the cannon.

[18:58] And that is like the reason why I want to walk into Jersey Jack Pinball and just start

[19:06] like strangling people over there.

[19:08] Because why would they design a pirate game that doesn't allow you to experience the

[19:14] fun of being a pirate intuitively and easily?

[19:19] Okay?

[19:20] That's my issue.

[19:22] It's bad design and it's because there is no leader over there who understands what makes

[19:30] Pinball great.

[19:32] I'm going to pause and let you absorb that.

[19:36] That Jack doesn't know how to stand over his team and say what the fuck is this?

[19:44] Change this.

[19:45] I want a pirate cannon to shoot a ball.

[19:50] A la the fucking milk can shot in Houdini.

[19:56] And Jack should have been adamant with his team.

[19:59] Here's what we need to make this better, simpler, funner.

[20:08] These people wake up every day and they drive their cars to go to a company to make a pinball

[20:17] machine.

[20:18] And I'm telling you right now, if I got in my Dodge Demon and drove the fucking Jersey

[20:24] Jack every morning that you would have a better game, I'll tell you why.

[20:29] Because I could give them ideas that would make those products better.

[20:36] And I'm not saying this to brag.

[20:39] I just think it's common sense and I think most of you, most of you who listen to this

[20:44] show could do the same.

[20:46] That you would have approached it differently.

[20:50] That there is a very simple thing that should be in every pinball game that would make it

[20:57] worth owning.

[20:59] And that's my point.

[21:01] That's always been my point, ladies and gentlemen.

[21:05] I don't ever want to buy a pirate to the Caribbean pinball machine because I don't think there's

[21:11] anything in it physically that is amazing.

[21:16] That is a wow thing.

[21:17] Yeah, it's got good music.

[21:19] It's got good code.

[21:21] It's got good lights.

[21:22] It's everything is coding.

[21:24] It's all software.

[21:25] In the fuck that this analog toy that is supposed to be about magical shit happening physically

[21:32] on the play field, when the fuck did it become about software?

[21:37] Seriously, when the fuck did that happen?

[21:40] And when that happened, you all got fucked.

[21:44] This whole hobby got fucked because people got lazy with the physical world under glass.

[21:50] They got fucking lazy and they rely on LCD screens and software.

[21:55] Fuck, it literally, it is the thing that is destroying the hobby is the reliance on software

[22:04] and screens.

[22:05] It's the same thing in the auto industry.

[22:07] It's like electric cars.

[22:09] Yeah, they're faster.

[22:10] Yeah, instant torque.

[22:12] Fucking boring.

[22:14] Go drive the Tesla and then come strap yourself into the demon and see what's won is more

[22:21] fun.

[22:22] It's more incredible.

[22:23] It's more exhilarating.

[22:25] And that's what it comes down to with pinball.

[22:28] The exhilaration happens when the physical world is happening underneath you and I look

[22:32] at pirates and it's not there.

[22:34] It's not there for me.

[22:36] Am I wrong?

[22:38] You really think that pirates is better designed than tails of the Arabian Knights or theater

[22:44] of magic?

[22:45] Right.

[22:46] Literally.

[22:48] Imagine if Keith coded tails of the Arabian Knights.

[22:53] Imagine if Lyman Sheets coded that game.

[22:55] It would sell for like $50,000.

[22:57] Literally.

[22:58] If Lyman Sheets recoded tails of the Arabian Knights and said I only made one version on this

[23:04] game.

[23:05] It's recoded with everything I know how to do and it would sell for like $50,000 because

[23:11] it's what you really fucking want.

[23:14] And nobody wants to say that.

[23:16] Well, you know, it's because here's the thing.

[23:18] It's like all the other pinball podcasts because they need to get these new guys on the

[23:22] show and they need to say what you, what would they want those people to say and they

[23:29] won't say that that I, this podcast, can it is pinball podcast that I think that most

[23:34] of these modern games are total horse shit because it's all about software and the games,

[23:41] you know, not really doing anything magical and wow.

[23:45] And it's the reason why we're also excited to see what deep roots going to do because

[23:49] at least someone's trying to do something fucking magical and different and that excites

[23:55] you.

[23:56] But ultimately, ultimately, what I don't understand is this like this desire to just

[24:03] buy all these games.

[24:05] Like buy, buy, buy, they need you to buy.

[24:08] Like there are more manufacturers right now than ever before in pinball, right?

[24:13] And they need you to buy their products to stay in business.

[24:16] Now, here's the other thing.

[24:18] I'll close the loop on Jersey Jack pinball just very simply going to close the loop and

[24:22] then talk again because what I do, I love to talk according to ice man.

[24:28] Here's the, here's a reality.

[24:30] All right.

[24:31] If everything Jersey Jack was doing was so great, why did they go bankrupt like three times?

[24:38] Bankrupt out of money done.

[24:39] Boom.

[24:40] And are they even making any money on any of these games?

[24:44] Are they in the green?

[24:45] Do people really want these games?

[24:48] Look, Jack had Pat Lawler, the greatest pinball designer of all time.

[24:53] It's like having Steven Spielberg or James Cameron's making your next movie.

[24:58] Imagine if James Cameron made him his next movie and it only grossed like, you know, like

[25:05] $50 million at the box office when he's normally grossing a billion, right?

[25:11] That is the equivalent of Pat Lawler's dialed in, right?

[25:15] Pat Lawler comes back to pinball after all these years, gives us dialed in.

[25:21] Great shooting game, worst thing ever, head scratcher.

[25:25] Nobody really wants it.

[25:27] Only sells 1500.

[25:30] Only sells 1500.

[25:32] Who is to blame for that game?

[25:35] Now look, some of you out there be like, no one's to blame.

[25:37] The game is for fuck that.

[25:39] You guys wake up.

[25:41] Jack had the greatest designer in the history of pinball.

[25:46] Jack had Pat Lawler with a blank check and let him make whatever he wanted to make.

[25:55] But Jack was in control of what the game would be and we get dialed in.

[26:00] Can we, can I just like never do another pinball podcast again?

[26:04] Like literally, like that is the decision that they made to do that.

[26:10] And is Canada, the idiot is Canada, the Bozo is Canada the dope or is Jack like seriously

[26:19] ridiculous for allowing that to be the theme.

[26:23] And guess what?

[26:24] It doesn't matter what I say, it doesn't matter what you think ultimately the game was

[26:30] a flop.

[26:31] And if you don't think it's a flop that the greatest pinball designer of all time who

[26:35] is the man behind a game that sold 20,000 units, look, I get it.

[26:41] We'll never get to Adam's family volume again.

[26:43] But a good Stern game.

[26:45] How many Ghostbusters do you think Stern sold?

[26:47] How many?

[26:48] Okay.

[26:49] I don't know.

[26:50] I would say that it's in the vicinity of five to seven thousand units that you dialed

[26:58] in 1500.

[26:59] Okay?

[27:00] 1500.

[27:04] Stern will sell 1500 deadpools like that.

[27:09] They will sell 1500 of the Beatles.

[27:12] Dialed in.

[27:13] Look at everything that's in it.

[27:14] It's like this game that you just want to love so much.

[27:19] And then you're like, but I don't really want to be doing this.

[27:22] I don't really want to be saving Quantum City.

[27:24] You know, it's like that, that, that, that jaw breaker from Record Ralph.

[27:29] And I've played Dialed in.

[27:30] That's how I feel like that jaw breaker.

[27:32] Like I don't really care about the tornado that's happening right now.

[27:36] And I really don't want to collect more SIM cards.

[27:39] And I really don't know why there's a guy with his dress shirt tucked into his jeans holding

[27:45] up a cell phone.

[27:46] And I really don't know why I'm here right now.

[27:48] But I guess so.

[27:49] I guess I'll play it.

[27:50] Okay.

[27:51] That's what it's fucking like.

[27:53] Seriously.

[27:54] 15 seconds of Batman blows that game away when you just hear the Batman theme.

[28:01] And then you're like, oh, yeah, I'm fucking Batman and Robin.

[28:04] I don't have to choose 22 characters from the Batman world.

[28:07] I'm Batman and Robin and I got to jail the villains.

[28:10] What the fuck are you empire to the Caribbean?

[28:13] What are you?

[28:14] I don't get it.

[28:16] You can choose from good guys and bad guys.

[28:20] How the fuck does that make sense?

[28:22] All right.

[28:23] I walk into Jersey Jack and I say there's no cannon shot.

[28:27] I can choose from good guys and bad guys.

[28:30] 22 of them.

[28:31] What the fuck guys?

[28:33] What the fuck are you doing?

[28:36] How fucking stupid do you have to be to make these decisions?

[28:42] All right.

[28:43] You get one chance.

[28:44] You know, once a pinball machine is done, it's done.

[28:47] It's in a box.

[28:48] It's 350 pounds.

[28:49] And you can't change it.

[28:51] You can't change it.

[28:52] It's done.

[28:53] And I don't understand how you end up with what they end up with.

[28:58] And that's just me.

[29:00] Now look, Stern, I understand why we end up with where we end up with Stern games.

[29:07] Because Stern's not stupid.

[29:09] Stern understands the principles of business, of marketing.

[29:15] Yes, they're trying to make money and they make money on every game they make.

[29:20] They don't lose any money.

[29:23] And you know who's money?

[29:24] They take it's your money.

[29:26] It's guys like frog.

[29:28] They must have a picture of frolic up on the wall.

[29:32] And it's just like the frolic meter.

[29:34] And basically every time they release an L.E. it just sells out immediately.

[29:38] The monsters L.E. will sell out immediately.

[29:43] They won.

[29:44] Let me tell you something.

[29:45] I guarantee you, they're already sold out.

[29:49] If you want to go get a monster's L.E. I bet you won't be able to get one.

[29:54] Five hundred of them will sell out before the game is even flipped by anyone.

[30:01] And Jack is doing so much more in his games and he can't reach that level of excitement.

[30:08] Why is that?

[30:09] See Stern knows.

[30:12] Their smart George Gomez is a smart, smart man.

[30:16] Right?

[30:17] I've walked up to George Gomez at a bar in Texas and had a conversation with Pimball

[30:23] that I won't share with you people.

[30:25] But he understands business.

[30:27] He understands Pimball and he cares a lot about it.

[30:32] And here's the thing.

[30:33] This is not me, Schilling Stern.

[30:34] And I really want you guys to listen up deeply to this.

[30:38] If Jack cared a lot about Pimball, then he would stop making stupid fucking decisions.

[30:44] He keeps making stupid fucking decisions.

[30:46] And maybe if your friends were Jersey Jack Pimball and the people over there, you should get

[30:50] them to stop making stupid fucking decisions and making a pirate game where you can't shoot

[30:54] the fucking pirate cannon is a dumb fucking decision.

[30:58] Okay?

[30:59] Now George Gomez smart man makes smart decisions.

[31:04] And the smartest decision that George Gomez and Gary Stern ever made was simply this.

[31:11] They decided to make a Pimball company that could stay in business, that could make a

[31:17] profit, that could do what they needed to do to stay viable for all of these years that

[31:23] you're enjoying their products.

[31:26] Jersey Jack Pimball should be at a business.

[31:29] The billionaire angel investor is a ridiculous concept.

[31:33] It's fake.

[31:34] It's a fake version of success.

[31:37] Do me a favor, everybody.

[31:38] You're going to find something that looks very similar to Andrew Highway.

[31:48] You're going to see Jack in front of machines at his factory with nobody working, with nobody

[31:55] on the line.

[31:57] It's like this, literally it's just like a bigger version of Highway Pimball.

[32:02] Jack ran out of money on every single title.

[32:04] Ran out of money.

[32:05] Blue threw it all.

[32:07] Yeah, the games, this is not about the games.

[32:10] You have to learn how to separate the games from the business decisions.

[32:15] Ran out of money would be gone.

[32:18] Should have been gone before even Hobbit came out.

[32:21] Like gone, like literally gone evaporate.

[32:26] But Gary Stern and George Gomez, they know how to make money.

[32:30] They know how to like design a Pimball game, put it in a box, send it to you within

[32:37] a few weeks of you ordering it with a distributor base around the world and make a profit on

[32:43] every game sold.

[32:45] Look, I know that I knock them at times.

[32:47] Yeah, it's crazy that these two to $3,000 machines are being sold for $9,000.

[32:54] But they're giving you what you want.

[32:56] Are they not?

[32:57] Yeah, of course you probably would like a lot more magic in the games and so would I.

[33:03] But.

[33:04] You know, it's like it's like a big, but you know, big asterisk floating above the Pimball

[33:09] fucking world people.

[33:11] But Stern Pimball will ship you.

[33:14] Are you sitting down four to five games a year that are new in box four to five games

[33:22] a year.

[33:24] Jersey Jack Pimball with its factory got you four games in like seven years.

[33:30] In seven years time, Stern will get you 28 to 30 fucking machine 30 machines and they're

[33:40] going to keep going.

[33:41] You know what I'm excited about for 2019?

[33:43] I don't know what Stern's coming out with.

[33:45] Do you?

[33:46] Nobody knows.

[33:48] We already know.

[33:49] Here's what's sad.

[33:50] We already know what Jersey Jack Pimball machines will be all the way probably up until I want

[33:57] to say 2022, right?

[34:01] Jack does like a game every 18 fucking months.

[34:06] So we know it's going to be Willy Wonka toy story and guns and roses.

[34:11] We know that for a fact and there is going to be nothing other than that coming from

[34:16] them.

[34:17] And that's Jersey Jack Pimball.

[34:21] So cool.

[34:23] Do we even think about like this?

[34:25] Tell me what's coming out from Stern in 2020, 2021.

[34:29] Do you know?

[34:30] No, absolutely not.

[34:31] Right?

[34:32] I love that Christopher Francius side note is sharing his Willy Wonka artwork.

[34:37] What a fuck you to Jersey Jack Pimball that is.

[34:40] Like his Willy Wonka artwork is fucking tremendous.

[34:44] It's insane.

[34:45] It's incredible.

[34:46] I love Christopher Franci.

[34:49] I love the man.

[34:50] I know he's mad at me like I shared some photos.

[34:53] They went out.

[34:54] It's okay, Chris.

[34:56] It's okay.

[34:57] It's okay for you to come back on the show.

[35:00] But his artwork is phenomenal and his Wonka artwork is fucking killer.

[35:05] Killer.

[35:07] And he's sharing Wonka art on the eve of Jersey Jack Pimball releasing Willy Wonka maybe

[35:13] in March.

[35:14] I love it.

[35:15] I love it.

[35:16] What a fuck.

[35:17] What a great fuck you that is.

[35:18] I love a good fuck you.

[35:19] You know, when your Canadian Pimball podcasts, you love to see other people trolling other

[35:22] companies every once in a while.

[35:24] All right.

[35:25] So Stern does it right.

[35:27] Think about all the other Pimball companies that are out there.

[35:30] How many of them are viable?

[35:31] You know, it's funny to me.

[35:32] It's like I hear, I hear like the other Pimball podcasts that are like, I don't want to focus

[35:37] on the negativity.

[35:39] These so negative.

[35:40] He's so down on the like what, what, what world did these other podcasters live in where

[35:48] they look at the Pimball industry in 2018, 2019, 2017 and they can't like determine that,

[35:55] you know what?

[35:56] The majority of Pimball companies out there have failed to deliver.

[36:01] Like, it's not me being negative.

[36:04] Like literally, I'll try and count on my fingers the companies that have failed to be successful

[36:09] in Pimball.

[36:10] Should we do that?

[36:11] All right.

[36:12] Number one, companies that failed to be successful.

[36:13] You know what?

[36:14] Number one is Jersey Jack Pimball.

[36:15] They haven't made money.

[36:16] They have not made money.

[36:18] If you getting a game is a sign of that's a successful company, you're wrong because guess

[36:22] what?

[36:23] If that investor decide to leave it, they're gone tomorrow.

[36:26] Add a money.

[36:27] All right.

[36:28] Jersey Jack.

[36:29] Zidware.

[36:30] Skit B.

[36:33] Dutch Pimball.

[36:34] Highway Pimball.

[36:35] We're at five already.

[36:36] Five companies that have never made money in Pimball.

[36:40] Never made a profit.

[36:41] All right.

[36:42] Should we keep going?

[36:43] We're at five.

[36:44] Oh man.

[36:45] Let's do it.

[36:46] Number six, P3.

[36:47] There's no way Jerry's made a profit.

[36:50] All those years.

[36:52] No way.

[36:53] All right.

[36:55] What else we got?

[36:56] I'm like missing companies.

[36:58] Chicago Gaming has made money.

[37:00] Chicago Gaming Stern and Spooky.

[37:03] Three companies.

[37:04] Only three companies have been successful in having a viable Pimball company.

[37:10] Okay.

[37:11] Let's say the majority of Pimball companies have failed.

[37:17] Any yet, this podcast is supposed to cheerlead.

[37:21] Yay.

[37:22] Awesome.

[37:23] Pimball.

[37:24] You guys are great.

[37:25] New Pimball coming out.

[37:26] Yeah.

[37:27] Yeah.

[37:28] Oh, I didn't even bring up like team Pimball, the mafia.

[37:30] They can't even self-fucking one of those games.

[37:32] One.

[37:33] They can't sell fucking wide.

[37:35] Like, they literally, have you seen the marketing strategy for this game?

[37:38] I'm going to go a little bit of attention here.

[37:39] They fucking are trying to tell you that there's the Founder's Edition.

[37:43] Like, Joe, I love Joe to death.

[37:48] This is Joe Newhart at Pimball Star.

[37:50] He is marketing the first like 10 of them as Founder's editions.

[37:55] Okay.

[37:56] Are we really considering the people behind the mafia to be a Founder's of anything valuable?

[38:03] Right?

[38:04] It's like if Canada go scooped up a pile of dirt and said, I found this dirt.

[38:09] You can own the Founder's edition of this dirt.

[38:14] And it's worth more because I found it.

[38:16] That's how fucking stupid the marketing is behind this game.

[38:21] See, they came to me and I'm not lying when I say this.

[38:25] I'm the best fucking marketer on the planet.

[38:28] And if you need to fucking, if you need proof of that, go Google, go Google vitamin water

[38:35] and smartphone.

[38:36] I got more coverage for that brand than all Pimball coverage ever ever when it comes to these

[38:45] Pimball marketing companies.

[38:46] They never, they don't have a certain billion impressions, 3,000 news stories about it.

[38:51] Well, go Google, Stern's latest 15 releases, they get like none.

[38:56] All right?

[38:57] Anyway, it's apples to oranges like get it.

[38:59] I'm working with more ammo with my clients.

[39:02] But here's the thing.

[39:03] Here's the thing.

[39:05] to imagine they came to me imagine trying to market

[39:09] the mafia of imaginative that was your assignment hey can you convince pinball

[39:13] people that this is worth seventy five hundred dollars imagine that

[39:17] and i i literally i have the emails i was like i can help you this game is

[39:21] four thousand dollars over price

[39:24] and and and and joe new heart who i love to death the whole founders edition

[39:28] thing you know they're trying to say is

[39:30] the founders editions should be nine thousand dollars but you can have it for

[39:34] seventy five hundred dollars are you fucking kidding me

[39:37] this game is worth seventy five bucks seventy five hundred dollars

[39:41] for this game

[39:42] like how could you buy the mafia over like any stern pro ever

[39:47] it

[39:48] i literally

[39:49] and so this happened this is happening in pinball

[39:54] who's saying this stuff like who's like being like we don't need more

[39:57] pinball we don't need more pinball companies we don't need

[40:02] eighteen companies we just need good pinball machines

[40:06] and we all know deep down inside

[40:08] that these current games aren't anywhere as good as the games we got in the

[40:12] nineties we all know that ed robertson knows that even though he wants to be

[40:15] like you're crazy i i play the nineties games chris and i get bored quick yet

[40:19] add your board because you are now a collector

[40:22] your board because you're not playing those games in our case that's what ed

[40:26] doesn't get so nobody it's turn who i who's like and trying to justify

[40:31] you take the games from the nineties and you put modern code in them and they

[40:34] blow the modern games away i mean these new games

[40:38] you put these new games in our case in the nineties and people are confused

[40:43] they don't know what to do they don't know what to shoot for they don't know

[40:45] what's going on that's the difference you give me a star trek the next

[40:50] generation with modern alignment sheets coding

[40:53] and i would just own that one game and be happy for the rest of my life and you all

[40:57] know it and that's why you listen to this podcast because i hear people say he

[41:01] doesn't know pinball he doesn't know this he doesn't care

[41:04] fuck that i love pinball but i don't love these new pinball games

[41:10] compared to those games i like that stuff better it's

[41:13] better but i'll say this you that's right those games get boring because

[41:18] they were not designed to own so that is the quagmire that is the dilemma

[41:24] that this entire hobby is facing right now is you want a game from the nineties

[41:29] with a code from 2018 that's what you want you want lineman sheets and Keith

[41:36] to code your favorite game from the nineties some people might say well that's

[41:39] monster bash it's not it's not monster bash does get shallow and does get boring

[41:45] because again those games were meant to have quick fun on in an arcade nobody has

[41:51] figured out a way there is in a game that you can buy that is the best of both worlds

[41:57] that you can put in your home that has the magic of those games in terms of

[42:02] physical mechs with the magic of coding and where people say we're in a

[42:07] golden era pinball i would say we're in a golden era of pinball software

[42:11] we are in a golden era of pinball coding we are in a golden era of pinball artwork

[42:17] but the one place we're not in a golden era of and it's the most important place

[42:23] is the physical pinball game is not the best it's ever been you're you you will not find

[42:30] magic under the playfield in these games there is just it's just not there

[42:35] and and that is if i had to summarize what my entire fucking podcast is about

[42:41] and what i'm fighting for right the purpose of this podcast is to get that back that is why

[42:50] this podcast exists i will not shut up until we get that back the only reason people listen to the

[42:58] show is because they fucking agree with that even though they buy these new games that's what they

[43:04] want that's what they crave when the stern designers who i know listen to this show that's what

[43:13] they want to give you but they can't give you too much or they they they couldn't make money

[43:18] apparently but that's what jack's aiming for but he can't get a fucking pirate cannon to shoot

[43:25] you can't even fucking see the cannon where the fuck is the cannon jack

[43:30] jack

[43:31] Jesus fucking christ i hate to get this unraveled how do you make a pirate game and you can't see the

[43:39] fucking cannon i i literally want to drive over there and strangle them today

[43:48] make magic and i'll buy it the reason why people buy batman and beetles and this there

[43:55] knows one very simple thing the themes that are magical will get you to buy it's that simple

[44:03] nobody wants fucking pirates the Caribbean theme you know you don't want it ice you don't want it
