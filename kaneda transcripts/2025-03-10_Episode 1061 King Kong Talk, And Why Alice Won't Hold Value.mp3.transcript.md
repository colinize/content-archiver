[00:00] Let it all hang out, but you won't fool the children of the revolution.

[00:07] Now you won't fool the children of the revolution.

[00:12] Now, now, now.

[00:13] Set us up, set us up, set us up, set us up, set us up.

[00:17] Ah, Happy Monday everybody. Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Kaneda, a man who struggles to keep his emotions in check.

[00:27] What's going on in the pinball world this week?

[00:29] Well, we've got some stuff to talk about.

[00:32] Let's talk about King Kong on this episode a little bit.

[00:35] Let's talk about the fact that King Kong is most likely going to be in all original journey or adventure.

[00:43] It's not going to be based on King Kong movie clips.

[00:46] So that's going to be interesting.

[00:48] How is Stern going to tackle this game?

[00:50] It's going to be a little bit like Jurassic Park and Godzilla had a baby.

[00:56] We know the team working on it is the best team, maybe, in the history of pinball.

[01:03] So our expectations are very high.

[01:07] We know that TPF is coming in just a couple of weeks.

[01:10] Are we going to get any surprises at that show?

[01:13] Remember when TPF was like, the show.

[01:16] It doesn't feel that way anymore.

[01:17] We've got pinball at the beach.

[01:19] We've got expo.

[01:20] We've got MGC.

[01:22] We've got a lot of shows now in the pinball world.

[01:25] I think in general, the entire hobby has oversupplied everything from shows to games to content five, six, seven, eight years ago.

[01:36] There used to be much less of everything, including much less money required to get these pinball machines.

[01:44] So I think we're in a new maybe golden era of pinball, but the golden era is also an era in which there's just so much.

[01:53] And I think there are times, I think many of you probably feel this.

[01:57] It just becomes a little overwhelming.

[01:59] And you know my point of view on all of this, simplify your lives, less is more as we get older, enjoy the machines you have, and you won't be chasing all of this new inbox FOMO,

[02:12] which is really the biggest appreciating assets in the history of pinball.

[02:17] But let's talk about what's going on in pinball.

[02:19] Then we'll talk about King Kong.

[02:20] So some things we haven't really covered off on recently that's in the news.

[02:24] We've got spooky pinball has sold over 800 evil dead machines.

[02:29] Now we want to congratulate spooky pinball on that update.

[02:33] They're making 888 of these evil dead machines and they've been out since December.

[02:39] So December, January, February, March, three, four months of this game being on the market.

[02:45] A little interesting that it's still not fully sold out.

[02:49] I mean, when you look at everything that's in this game, they really did nail it.

[02:53] Now the reason it's not sold out is the theme Rick and Morty sold 750, I think in one day.

[03:00] And I think it's a little bit of a learning for spooky pinball.

[03:03] Now I'm here to tell you right now, their next title is Beetlejuice.

[03:08] It is 100% going to be Beetlejuice.

[03:13] They have sold enough evil deads to get them to December of this year when they will reveal Beetlejuice to the world.

[03:20] And unlike evil dead, Beetlejuice will be a day one sell out.

[03:26] The question I have for spooky is this, they've sort of hit the perfect number of games.

[03:32] Are they only going to make 888 Beetlejuices?

[03:36] One of the things that the team over there regrets the most is saying that we are only going to make 750 Rick and Mortys.

[03:45] And they really did have a lot of meetings where they were thinking about bringing Rick and Morty back.

[03:51] They were actually going to change the design so it's like an all new Rick and Morty game because they have the license and all those assets.

[03:58] But look, they stayed true to their word.

[04:01] And I think a lot of that is the reason why people love spooky pinball.

[04:05] If it was Stern pinball and they made 750 Rick and Mortys and then saw the demand was still very strong, you know what Stern would have done?

[04:12] They would have remade it.

[04:13] They would have called it some anniversary edition.

[04:15] They would have removed some color or added some color or called it some new edition.

[04:19] But that's what Stern pinball has done to its collector base over the last three years.

[04:24] They've screwed over everybody and they're going to do it again this year when they do a remake of another game that they said they were never making more Ellie's on.

[04:31] It's most likely I'm probably going to be wrong.

[04:34] It's most likely going to be the Walking Dead.

[04:36] So spooky pinball has got Beetlejuice next and Evil Dead is moving very nicely.

[04:41] And look, one of the things I always say to you is wait and see and if you waited and you really want an Evil Dead, they still have a few available that they're going to bring the Texas Pinball Festival.

[04:53] And I think they were bringing 11 games that people could buy the show game and then take it home.

[04:59] So once again, you could cut the line and get your game months before people who are waiting who ordered on day one.

[05:06] So congratulations, spooky pinball, on selling that many games.

[05:10] Now speaking of selling that many games, Dutch Pinball has announced the total number of the big Lebowski games that they have made over 12 freaking years.

[05:23] It's a little more than 100 a year when you think about it per year production schedule that this company is on.

[05:30] Think about the fact that Stern makes 800 a week.

[05:33] So the total number of the big Lebowski machines, it kind of annoys me that they didn't just cap it at a nice clean 1500 games.

[05:43] Then everybody could know what number their game is out of 1500.

[05:48] Nope, they've made in total 1500 and seven games.

[05:54] When you think about it, this game had a crazy existence.

[05:57] It came out like over 10 years ago.

[06:00] It was 8500.

[06:02] Then we know everything went south with ARA and contract manufacturing and there was like lies and deceit and manipulation and miscommunication.

[06:13] And then years went on when nothing happened and they pulled a rabbit out of a hat.

[06:19] They brought the game back.

[06:20] I believe it's 13500.

[06:22] They had a Rob Peter to pay Paul to make the people whole who ordered the game years ago.

[06:28] But in the end, everybody, I mean, everybody will have been made whole.

[06:34] And Dutch Pinball, in the history of pinball since I've been covering it, they're the only pinball company that went through something so different.

[06:42] They went through something so terrible and turned it around.

[06:45] And there are people out there that won't forgive Dutch Pinball.

[06:48] I mean, I know what it's like personally, Canada.

[06:50] People that won't forgive you when you turn stuff around.

[06:53] Well, maybe I haven't turned stuff around with my mini meltdowns every single year.

[06:57] That's a guarantee.

[06:58] You know, Canada is going to do that.

[07:00] You know, he's going to rage quit Facebook every once in a while.

[07:02] And you know, you're going to come right back because it's still the most entertaining pinball content happening on a weekly basis.

[07:07] And if I learned my lesson, it wouldn't be as entertaining.

[07:10] So Dutch Pinball turned it around.

[07:12] They made everybody whole.

[07:13] They're making these Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[07:16] Those games are about to be built this week.

[07:19] I think games are going to go out by the end of the month.

[07:21] That's good.

[07:22] There's a few months delay on this game.

[07:24] You wouldn't be Dutch Pinball without a little bit of a delay, but everyone's going to start to get their Alice machines.

[07:29] Now, when it comes to Alice, I think it's quite clear that there is more supply than demand.

[07:36] And I see people who ordered this game trying to sort of qualify.

[07:42] This is being a collectible that's going to hold value.

[07:46] Here's why I don't think Alice is going to hold as strong as people think.

[07:52] And I think people need to wake up to the new reality of pinball and what actually will hold value and what does become a collectible.

[08:01] Rarity does not equal collectibility.

[08:05] A beautiful art package pinball machine does not equal collectibility.

[08:10] What makes something collectible?

[08:12] It needs to be a few things.

[08:13] First and foremost, it needs to be an amazing game.

[08:17] It needs to be something that is satisfying that a lot of people want because that's why people want it because the game is so good.

[08:25] It's the reason why when you go on pinside right now, you don't see any Jaws Elise for sale.

[08:31] Maybe one.

[08:32] You don't see any Lord of the Rings Elise for sale.

[08:36] If you find a Tron Elise or some of these great games, you're going to see them for sale for much more money.

[08:42] It means the demand to get those games far exceeds what the owners paid for those machines.

[08:49] That's what makes something collectible.

[08:52] That's why Pirates of the Caribbean at Jersey Jack, right?

[08:55] There's only a thousand of them in the world.

[08:57] If the game was a total stinker and a total dog like Godfather, even if there was only a thousand people wouldn't want it,

[09:04] right now, there are not even a thousand people that want Godfather from Jersey Jack.

[09:09] There's not even like 500.

[09:11] It's not about just being limited.

[09:13] The game has to be good.

[09:15] Is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland going to be a good enough game and a satisfying and fun experience to create that level of demand?

[09:25] The problem right now is nobody really knows.

[09:27] Right now, the only thing going for this game is the artwork and the sexiness of it and the limited nature of the game.

[09:36] A lot of people have played this game.

[09:37] I've played this game from a gameplay standpoint.

[09:40] Yes, it's absolutely not going to stand out from a gameplay standpoint.

[09:45] Then you get to, alright, so the shots are not there.

[09:49] There's not a lot of toys in the game.

[09:51] There's a lot of scopes.

[09:52] It's very colorful, but there's not a lot of toys in the game.

[09:56] Then you get to the code.

[09:58] Is the software going to be good?

[10:00] Everything that was coded during the Zidware period, there was no code to even speak of.

[10:04] Magic Girl is empty.

[10:06] How's the code in the game?

[10:08] Again, coming from these modern games that you guys own, you're going to be severely disappointed in how barren the code is going to be next to a modern stern,

[10:19] modern Jersey Jack game, a modern spooky game, a modern multi-morphic game.

[10:24] Everything that's coming out in the marketplace is going to have a lot more depth and replay value than Alice.

[10:31] So then it begs the question, do you think 500 of these is too much to create a real collectible item?

[10:40] I do.

[10:42] I would not have made 500.

[10:44] And the reason I know that the supply is already outpacing demand and not a single game has even been made or gone out the door.

[10:54] There are two pre-order spots available for this game that have been sitting on pin side for like weeks and nobody's bought it.

[11:04] Think about that.

[11:05] What is that telegraph?

[11:06] It means that there is nobody in the world who feels like they missed out on getting in Alice.

[11:13] And these spots are for sale at price, like at MSRP.

[11:17] It's $1,500.

[11:19] People want out of their deposit without even making a penny.

[11:23] Now, if you had a Jaws LE and you want to go sell it, you're going to get more than you paid for it.

[11:28] Same thing with Metallica remastered LE.

[11:31] There's just no more demand.

[11:33] If I was coming out of the gate with DPX, my first game was this Alice game, I would have made 300.

[11:39] I would have made 300.

[11:40] I would have kept it small.

[11:41] I would have seen where the demand was out.

[11:43] And I also would have made 300 because I would have wanted to secure some more secondhand value for the buyers.

[11:50] And I know what people are saying, like, well, on a global level, that's only 500, 200 in Europe and 300 in America.

[11:56] But here's my thing, people.

[11:57] That's not even working.

[11:59] Even though there's only going to be 300 in America, there's not even 302 people that want this game in America.

[12:06] Think about that for a minute.

[12:08] Break that down on its most empirical level.

[12:12] There are not even 302 people in America who love pinball, who buy pinball, who collect pinball that want this game.

[12:22] Because if there were two more people than games coming here, then those two people who missed out when it sold out,

[12:28] I keep hearing people say, it's sold out.

[12:30] Come on.

[12:31] It didn't sell out because nobody's paid in full yet for a single game, right?

[12:34] It doesn't sell out until people pay in full.

[12:36] And so there's not even two people that feel left out because those spots are still available on pinside.

[12:41] Now, look, I've been looking at this game the same way every single time.

[12:45] I think Melvin pulled off a minor miracle.

[12:48] He made this game in a year.

[12:50] He saved Dutch pinball.

[12:52] You guys realize this.

[12:53] If he didn't have this game ready to go, what would Dutch pinball have on the line right now?

[12:58] Nothing.

[12:59] And they would go out of business and they would never make back to the future.

[13:02] So in my mind, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an incredible feat by a guy that has helped Dutch pinball now survive to get to back to the future.

[13:13] So every single person who enjoys Dutch pinballs back to the future can thank Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for getting this company there.

[13:21] And sometimes in life, you got to hit singles and doubles before you hit the home runs.

[13:25] And that's what I think this is.

[13:27] All right.

[13:28] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[13:30] Well, look, let's talk about King Kong because I put up what I thought was going to be the order by which games were going to come out this year.

[13:38] And it was Portal by Multimorphic at TPF.

[13:42] I think CGC will announce.

[13:44] They will announce.

[13:45] They don't even have to reveal it because we've already seen the game.

[13:47] I think they will announce that medieval madness is coming back.

[13:51] I think that's going to happen at TPF.

[13:54] Then Alice's are going to go out the door at the end of this month.

[13:57] Then we're going to get the new barrels of fun game.

[14:00] I didn't even guess.

[14:01] I mean, it's probably going to be Dune.

[14:03] Everyone's like Dune or GI Joe.

[14:05] I kind of hope it's just something else.

[14:07] I kind of hope it is the Goonies.

[14:09] And the reason I say that if Beetlejuice is next from Spooky Pinball, then when are they making the Goonies?

[14:17] And we know someone has the Goonies license.

[14:19] They've had it for a couple years now.

[14:21] After Deeproot imploded that license has been grabbed by somebody else.

[14:25] I fully expect Goonies now to be barrels of fun.

[14:29] And I think barrels of fun has been sandbagging all of us.

[14:34] I think the next game is going to be the Goonies.

[14:37] I think it's going to have a big pirate ship.

[14:40] They might not have access to all of the Goonie characters from the movie.

[14:45] And maybe they can't use audio from all the characters, but you could still make the Goonies without everybody speaking.

[14:51] Maybe it's Josh Brolin who's difficult to get.

[14:54] I don't know how they're going to do it.

[14:56] Look, they made Labyrinth without Jennifer Connolly.

[14:59] And she's the damn protagonist and the main character in the movie.

[15:02] So they know how to make a game without using every single character in it.

[15:07] So will it be the Goonies?

[15:09] Look, I know when I say that, all of you get very excited.

[15:12] When I say Dune, none of you get excited.

[15:14] So I hope it's the Goonies.

[15:16] I know David's looking to invite people down there.

[15:18] I spoke to him.

[15:19] Canada is going to get an invite.

[15:21] He wants to reveal this game.

[15:23] I think by the end of this month, maybe early next month,

[15:26] and he's going to have media content creators and dealers and distros come and see the new game.

[15:31] And then he's going to reveal to the world.

[15:33] So all at once, all our content can hit.

[15:36] I think it's really smart and I can't wait to play the game.

[15:39] I'm kind of tired of speculating on what it's going to be.

[15:42] I just want to see it because after that, then we're going to get the Pimball Brothers Predator.

[15:47] We're going to get JJP's Harry Potter and we're going to get Stern's King Kong.

[15:51] So let's talk about King Kong.

[15:53] And now that we know that the title of this game is the myth of Terror Island,

[15:59] I think it's safe to say that this game is going to be more like Jurassic Park and not like Godzilla.

[16:07] It's clear they're not going to use movie clips from the King Kong movies,

[16:11] but maybe they're going to use old King Kong clips.

[16:13] I think what they're going to do, and I've said this before,

[16:15] I think most of this game is going to be like Jurassic Park meets Godzilla,

[16:22] but without movie clips from the modern films.

[16:25] I think what you're going to get is King Kong on Skull Island or Terror Island.

[16:31] He's found himself on this new island.

[16:33] I don't know why isn't it called Skull Island?

[16:35] I don't know. He's on some island and there's going to be a lot of other creatures that King Kong needs to battle.

[16:41] Allah Godzilla battling all the monsters in his universe.

[16:46] I think it's going to be very similar to that.

[16:48] I think all the different monsters that King Kong battles will be different regions of the play field.

[16:54] I think you're going to be playing as King Kong, which means if you think about it,

[17:00] there won't be much like Godzilla, a major mech in the game that is King Kong.

[17:07] Because if you are Kong, why would you be bashing him and why would you be interacting with him if you are him?

[17:15] Think about Godzilla. You're interacting with the building, you're interacting with mech of Godzilla,

[17:21] but Godzilla as himself is just standing there as a stationary toy.

[17:26] He doesn't do anything. He doesn't even breathe fire in this stern game.

[17:30] It still kills me that stern made of Godzilla game, which is the number one game of all time.

[17:34] When you think about it, the number one game in the world is Godzilla.

[17:39] In toy format, Godzilla does nothing in the game.

[17:44] It does go to show you how low our expectations are of these companies.

[17:50] But Godzilla was also $10,500 and now we're going to get a $13,600 King Kong LE.

[17:58] I think a lot of people when they saw the X-Men sent to know,

[18:01] they're like, oh, that would be cool for Godzilla, like a major, major big mech in the game.

[18:06] Now look, I hope it has that.

[18:08] So I think you're going to see this like Terror Island come to life.

[18:12] We know the team on it is the best team in all the pinball.

[18:16] My worry about King Kong is this.

[18:18] Godzilla, from the moment you hit start and those clips and the music, like the Godzilla theme song is iconic.

[18:26] The moment you hit start, it brings you into that Godzilla world instantly and it's amazing.

[18:34] The same thing with Jurassic Park, the moment you hit start and you hear that Jurassic Park theme song,

[18:41] it pulls you into the Jurassic Park world you love instantly.

[18:45] And even though Godzilla's got animations instead of movie clips, you still connect and remember,

[18:51] you remember everything that happened in Jurassic Park.

[18:54] So you're able to make the mental leap to then put yourself into the game and into that environment.

[19:00] I don't know if King Kong has that per se.

[19:04] Like it doesn't have that iconic theme song.

[19:07] You know, they're going to probably go with like this tribal jungle, like heavy on the drums, you know,

[19:12] and the natives of the island are summoning Kong to go fight.

[19:16] I think you're going to get a lot of that.

[19:18] I think the use of a shaker motor as King Kong is like heading towards you and knocking down the trees.

[19:24] That 1970s version of Kong where they tie the girl to the fence and he's just coming and you see the trees falling down.

[19:32] To me, that's the most iconic arrival of King Kong ever.

[19:37] It's absolutely incredible and they're just chanting like Kong, Kong.

[19:42] And what makes the movie so magical is you don't see the big ape.

[19:46] You know, there's like this suspense of waiting to see him.

[19:49] And I'm wondering if they're going to be able to create that and translate that into the pinball experience.

[19:55] You know, who knows on the design. The design is going to be interesting, right?

[19:58] I think with every new Keith Elwin game, we really do wonder what's he going to do next.

[20:04] He's done a lot. He's made some of the best shooting games in pinball.

[20:07] I think people out there though, if there's one thing, if there's one major criticism of Keith Elwin games,

[20:13] it's they're maybe too hard for a lot of you.

[20:16] And I hear that from people in private areas of the internet, you know, because you can't publicly come out and say you're frustrated by a Keith Elwin game.

[20:26] You know, it's just like because he's so popular, you can't even give critiques or criticisms.

[20:30] But I think a lot of people out there just over time get a little frustrated with how hard Godzilla is.

[20:37] And you know, you're never going to get to the end.

[20:39] Same with Jaws. Like, you know, when they do the final Wizard Mode in Jaws, none of you are going to be able to get through like the other five mini Wizard Modes

[20:47] and complete all of them or even activate all of them to get to the final Wizard Mode.

[20:52] Look, and some people out there that are amazing players will, but 98% of you won't.

[20:58] And I think Keith Elwin games, I think some people just want his games to be a little bit easier to get through and see what it's all about.

[21:07] And also like on a design standpoint, sometimes they're just brutal.

[21:10] Like the flow is amazing and they're super great.

[21:13] You're holding on a little bit to get through the game.

[21:15] But other than that, it's really hard to find anything to complain about with Keith Elwin and Stern Machines.

[21:21] These are the only games that are holding value.

[21:24] These games are bringing the most enjoyment right now in the pinball world.

[21:28] And when you think about Stern Pinball without Keith Elwin, it's almost impossible to even think about Stern Pinball without Keith Elwin.

[21:36] He's their only hit maker right now and Stern Pinball needs a hit.

[21:40] So there's a lot riding on this game right now.

[21:43] There's a lot.

[21:44] Is there going to be an empire state building in the game?

[21:48] The iconic thing.

[21:50] The most iconic King Kong thing in the world is him climbing that empire state building.

[21:56] Here's what I think they're going to do.

[21:58] I said it in an earlier podcast.

[21:59] I think they're going to have a throwback mode in this game where it's going to be the black and white Kong

[22:06] swatting at the airplanes, hanging from fishing tackle.

[22:09] I think they're going to create a throwback mode that's going to bring some of the older Kong moments to life.

[22:15] But when it comes to this version of the game, I don't think you're going to see like the classic Kong movie poster vibe on the cabinet.

[22:22] I think it's going to be zombie Eddie on this game.

[22:25] And I think it's going to be colorful.

[22:27] I think it's going to be bright.

[22:29] Personally, I would have liked them to have gone more of the original Kong movie poster vibe.

[22:34] I think that when it comes to Stern, same with Godzilla, like I always, I feel like it was a missed opportunity with Godzilla to pay homage to Godzilla

[22:43] in a way that looked more like those iconic movie posters.

[22:47] Stern doesn't take many risks when it comes to art direction.

[22:51] Their games are all very similar looking because it works, right?

[22:55] It works. They're all colorful. They're all cheerful.

[22:57] They make you want to walk up and play pinball.

[22:59] But I wish they would allow the theme to dictate the art looking drastically different if the theme demands it and they don't.

[23:08] They don't.

[23:09] This thing looked very colorful, very bright, big gorilla, shiny white fang teeth.

[23:15] And I can picture him, you know, like his big hand throwing a silver humongous silver pinball somewhere on the cabinet.

[23:21] I don't know. We'll see how they do it.

[23:23] But I still think Kong is going to be a little bit of a question mark.

[23:26] I do. I think it's going to struggle to have as much personality as Godzilla.

[23:31] And then the other question is, is it going to come out before Harry Potter?

[23:36] Because when I put up my timeline, a lot of people said they think Kong is going to be out before May and it might come out in April.

[23:43] Now, knowing that Stern needs a hit, knowing that Harry Potter is also going to get a ton of orders,

[23:49] and both these companies, they now know that you're not going to have a lot of people able to buy both.

[23:55] And with these games costing what they cost, whoever comes out first might have the advantage.

[24:02] Remember when Stern came out with like Foo Fighters all of a sudden and they snaked Godfather?

[24:07] Not that you needed a great game to snake Godfather, but they did.

[24:11] So I could see Stern pinball coming out before Harry Potter.

[24:15] And I know Jersey Jack is aware of that and they are nervous.

[24:19] So I think there's a race to get the games out in April.

[24:23] I think both games could be revealed in April and ship in May.

[24:28] Because remember, both of these companies tend to reveal products.

[24:33] Sometimes they're on the line, sometimes they are just about to be on the line.

[24:38] And with Stern doing Ellie's first, when they reveal a game on reveal day, the Ellie's are usually not on the line.

[24:46] Remember, they used to always have the pros on the line first to get them the operators.

[24:51] They switched that up.

[24:53] And with Godfather is a few week delay between reveal and manufacturing.

[24:58] Jersey Jack did not have Elton John's inboxes on the line.

[25:02] They didn't even have Avatar on the line shipping on the day the game was revealed.

[25:07] So I could see both companies trying to get in front of each other.

[25:12] And then we get to see these games in April, right when Predator is going to get announced,

[25:17] right when Barrels of Fun is about to get announced.

[25:19] So here's the crazy part.

[25:21] You might see four new pinball machines, four separate IPs from four different companies in a four week period of time.

[25:29] I think between the end of March and the end of April, it's about to get crazy.

[25:34] And it's March 10th. That's not a lot of time to wait.

[25:38] And I'm going to keep you entertained, right?

[25:40] You're going to get two to three shows a week and a Saturday morning spectacular.

[25:44] I'm going to make the wait really easy.

[25:46] Everybody, thank you for being a club member.

[25:48] It's about to get really, really exciting in pinball.

[25:51] It's a lot of fun to think about this stuff and to turn off the outside world and all of its negativity, all of its distractions.

[25:58] And think about what world under glass are we going to get that's going to make us want to buy a game.

[26:05] Even when we told our wives we weren't buying anything more this year.

[26:10] Everybody have a great day. We'll talk to you soon.

[26:18] Now you want food. The children of the revolution.

[26:23] It's now way.

[26:48] Thank you.
