[00:00] Sai che a Mardino ne mai appastanza, è che tu sei tutto quello che mi manca, dimmi un po', dimmi cos'altro c'è.

[00:30] I want to welcome Ben, Jim, Eric, Steve, Glenn, Joe, Sebastian, CJS, Jay, Patrick, Nandan, Dave, and some of our new members Dominic, Don, Jerry.

[00:48] See, we're holding strong at 526 club members, so thank you guys for joining the club.

[00:53] It's back. The big monster is back. Stern Pinball is coming back to the pinball scene next week at Comic Con July 21st, a week from this past Thursday.

[01:06] We are going to see the next pinball machine most likely from Stern Pinball.

[01:11] Do you guys remember when Canada told everybody 10 months ago it was going to be Venom, Brian Eddy, comic book style artwork with Zambietti, and now all of a sudden it's news everywhere else, but that's cool man, it's cool when people take Canada's news and then repurpose it, but we don't care, this is all just pinball, we're all just having fun.

[01:29] What I know is this, this week in pinball is dead, like they don't have any news anymore on this week in pinball, but so here's what's great about this, is a week from today, we will probably be staring at a brand new game from Stern.

[01:44] Now look, Venom is an interesting choice. I know there's a lot of you out there that are just sick and tired of another comic book game, another Marvel game, and it seems to be like Stern's formula is like music and music.

[01:58] Music and Marvel, music and Marvel, and Keith Elwin mixed in with something else, but it's a formula that works, right? It's really hard to kick in the conference room door over at Stern and be like George and Gary, what are you doing?

[02:11] You don't know how to sell or make pinball machines, these guys know what they're doing. It's a formula that works because what Stern Pinball does so geniusly is they give something for everybody.

[02:22] Like they're not all in on Toy Story for like 8, 9, 10 months, they will give you Venom, they gave you Rush, they gave you Jurassic Park, they gave you Batman, they gave you Star Wars, they gave you Deadpool, you can keep going on and on and on, Iron Maiden, they gave you Aerosmith.

[02:37] Like their portfolio is so much stronger than everybody else's in all of pinball, in all of pinball history combined. Let me repeat that. The Stern catalog is stronger than every single pinball company combined in the history of pinball.

[02:54] And if at any time they want to rerun something that's great, they can do it. They could go get the license again for Lord of the Rings and do it, or Tron and do it.

[03:04] So Venom is coming out. Now what do we know about Venom? We know that Brian Eddy is the designer, Zombie Eddy is on the artwork, I don't know who's coding it but I would assume it's the same team that coded the Mandalorian.

[03:16] But the big question mark is this. Ozzy Osbourne is going to be at the booth with Stern Pinball and Todd McFarland.

[03:25] So this is leading a lot of people to speculate that Ozzy Osbourne's music is going to be in the Venom Pinball machine, which could be super awesome because for many of you out there you've been waiting for Ozzy for so long.

[03:38] Now look, I don't think you want like original Ozzy music for a Venom Pinball machine. I think you want like Ozzy's music like that he's famous for.

[03:48] So we shall see because I don't know, I don't see Stern Pinball like licensing the iconic tracks from Ozzy Osbourne and putting them into this Pinball machine.

[03:57] All of this is going to unfold next week. I'm just excited that Stern is back because now that Stern is back and they've turned on their monster machine again and they're going to make a new game every three to four months.

[04:10] Now we can get back to having real Pinball news more frequently. We can get back to having a new game to discuss every three to four months with no drama.

[04:20] Stern's going to get you guys your Ellie machines within a month or two of taking orders. There's no ridiculous pre-ordering of their games and then waiting a year.

[04:30] Like this is the only efficient and legitimate large scale pinball company in the world. Everybody else is just a booty company trying to do what Stern does.

[04:42] What do I hope from Venom? I hope Venom has a lot of personality. I think it's going to be like Deadpool.

[04:48] I think you're going to get that like bipolar nature of the Venom personality where the character, you know, where like Venom's talking to you throughout the game and taunting you throughout the game.

[04:57] I also think there's going to be a really big mech in this game. I don't know. Maybe Venom's tongue is going to shoot out of the mouth and become a ramp to his head.

[05:05] I don't know, but I think there's going to be a really big mech that's going to be Venom's face. I mean, that's like the iconic thing of Venom.

[05:12] It's always the way his face transforms with that wicked tongue.

[05:15] But I will say like I don't think Brian Eddy has really had a home run mech in any of his games with Stern Pinball.

[05:23] And we all were expecting a lot more from Brian Eddy since he did Medieval Madness in the castle there.

[05:29] There really wasn't anything epic and stranger things. There really wasn't anything epic in the Mandalorian.

[05:35] So we shall see what Brian Eddy gives us with his third attempt with Venom.

[05:40] Now, where I think this game is just going to blow everybody away is with the art package because Zombie Eddy's art style is perfect.

[05:48] It's so perfect for comic book style, especially Venom.

[05:54] And he crushed it on Deadpool. I mean, I still think Deadpool is the nicest looking pinball machine maybe ever from an artistic standpoint.

[06:03] And I think we're going to see Zombie Eddy go above and beyond that with Venom.

[06:07] See, his art style is perfect for this. It's not the perfect art style for Godzilla.

[06:12] You know, as good as Godzilla is, it's the one thing when I look at that game, I still don't feel like that was the right style for Godzilla.

[06:20] But I think this is going to be the right use of this guy's skill set.

[06:24] So here's the other thing I was thinking about. Like if Venom comes out and it is gorgeous and it is packed with like some fun toys,

[06:32] I think this could be a really, really bad thing for everyone who pre-ordered a toy story.

[06:39] Because this game is landing right on top of the toy story launch and let's not fool ourselves, people.

[06:45] There's not much in toy story.

[06:48] So if this Venom game has a major mech that's super cool and the art package is super awesome, we're not children.

[06:57] More of us out there are into more adult themes like Venom.

[07:01] And I think you're going to see people who are going to want to migrate over and go get the latest from Stern.

[07:07] Because we know the Stern game is going to shoot better and if it's got a really fun toy in it, it's really hard to justify the $12,000 to $15,000 for toy story.

[07:18] See, this is the problem with toy story being so barren.

[07:21] Every single game that comes out right now over the next like six months, we are going to compare it to whether or not there's more value in this game or toy story.

[07:31] I was looking at photos of Cactus Canyon remake and my gosh, it is embarrassing that Cactus Canyon remake, you can get it for like $8,000, has so much more in it than toy story.

[07:44] So much more in it.

[07:45] It is such a packed world under glass and it's $7,000 cheaper than a toy story CE.

[07:53] Like you could get two SCs of Cactus Canyon for the price of one toy story CE.

[07:59] The mistake Jersey Jack is making right now is they're waiting too long to make the collectors editions.

[08:05] They need to make them yesterday.

[08:08] I think people forget when Guns N' Roses came out, here's how it went.

[08:11] It came out in October.

[08:13] Everybody fell in love with the machine.

[08:15] Everybody.

[08:16] It was the greatest pinball launch ever.

[08:18] The greatest pinball launch video.

[08:20] We were still in COVID lockdown and the machine just landed like an atomic bomb in the pinball world.

[08:27] It gave us a music going pinball experience like never before.

[08:31] Now look, also Guns N' Roses made people wait a really long time for the collectors editions because they had play field issues.

[08:39] Remember there was like a four month wait.

[08:41] Then they said they fixed the problem and then there was the same problem all over again when they ran the play fields for the CEs.

[08:49] And also people didn't mind waiting for the collectors edition of G&R because A, it was amazing.

[08:55] It was $12,500 and they only made 500 of them.

[09:00] And G&R CE is still a very special machine.

[09:04] And then you look at Toy Story CE, it's got the same exact artwork as the LE.

[09:09] There's nothing really that special about the CE version and yet it's $3,000 more.

[09:16] And they're also making a thousand of them.

[09:19] Think about how silly this is from a marketing standpoint.

[09:22] There will always be twice as many Toy Story CEs in the world as Guns N' Roses CEs.

[09:29] Yet the demand for Guns N' Roses CE was twice as great as the demand for Toy Story.

[09:36] Guns N' Roses CEs sold for like a year after it came out for around $20,000.

[09:43] Just one month after Toy Story was revealed, you can't even get a dollar over sticker for the CE.

[09:51] Those are just them facts people.

[09:54] This is where it gets even crazier.

[09:56] If Venom goes on the line in August, that means Stern is going to be ready for another game come the winter,

[10:03] which is when Jersey Jack might be running Toy Story like late fall.

[10:07] And then they're going to announce Godfather in November, December, right when Stern has its next game.

[10:13] Like I could see Godfather versus James Bond being what battles it out this holiday season in the pinball world.

[10:20] It's going to get exciting.

[10:21] But that's not all we're going to get this fall holiday season.

[10:25] Are you ready for it people?

[10:27] Do you want a Godzilla?

[10:29] Do you want a Guns N' Roses?

[10:31] Do you want a Venom?

[10:33] Do you want a James Bond?

[10:35] Or do you want Galactic Tank Force?

[10:38] Or maybe it's Galactic Star Force from American Pinball.

[10:43] I spoke to people who saw Dennis Norman's game that is based on a tank.

[10:49] Now Dennis Norman was showing people this game a while ago.

[10:53] I mean like a few years ago, he was showing people on his cell phone a game he was designing that was all about a tank.

[11:02] And here's the thing I heard about the game.

[11:04] And this is kind of strange.

[11:05] I heard that when you fold the back box down, the entire cabinet looks like a tank.

[11:11] And I heard he designed this game when he was working on Woenelli.

[11:15] Remember when Woenelli came out and it had those like crates instead of legs?

[11:19] And Dennis was really thinking more about the entire package of the game.

[11:23] So maybe this whole thing is his game he was designing back then, which is a tank game in which the cabinet itself looks like a tank.

[11:31] Now what I don't get is how that would work when you fold up the back box.

[11:35] Does it just look like the Tin Man from Wizard of Oz?

[11:38] If the tank nozzles like pointing up, it doesn't make any sense.

[11:41] Maybe it folds down and that becomes the topper and it moves back and forth.

[11:45] But I'm here to tell you right now, I think this is going to be the game from American Pinball.

[11:49] And now it starts to make sense that Christopher Franchi keeps saying there's a big game coming from American Pinball.

[11:57] Well what's bigger than a freaking tank and I think that's what he's talking about, that the tank is the big thing he's talking about.

[12:04] Now look, this is the reason why AP just doesn't understand that original IP just won't break through.

[12:12] People are buying Cactus Canyons because those games were engineered during the Bally Williams days.

[12:17] And I will say, I was talking to someone over at Stern Pinball.

[12:21] I'm not going to name names, but I was talking to a very senior person over at Stern Pinball about Pat Lawler and about Toy Story.

[12:28] And everyone is saying the same thing. They say, Chris, you know, no one realizes how amazing the engineers were over at Bally Williams.

[12:37] They were the true rock stars that made these designers look so amazing.

[12:42] And there's not that many mechanical engineers over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[12:47] And that's why Toy Story and Willy Wonka look the way they do.

[12:51] Because Pat doesn't have people over there to create the kinds of genius things we saw back in the day.

[12:58] The only person over there that I think can create genius mechanisms like back in the day is Eric Minier because Eric is a mechanical engineer.

[13:07] And guess who Eric Minier is not going to help out?

[13:10] Pat Lawler, the old Cremugian who doesn't want to take advice from anybody.

[13:15] But I'm just calling it right now. If American Pinball's game comes out and it's Galactic Tank Force or Galactic Star Force,

[13:23] it's going to have a really hard time being successful.

[13:26] You know, it's really interesting in the rant that happened over on the super awesome pinball show,

[13:30] Christopher Franchi himself said how awesome it is to work on unlicensed games because of the creativity.

[13:38] And the ultimate irony is that Mr. Franchi's art is incredible,

[13:43] but he's made all of his mark on the pinball world and he makes all of his money selling licensed IP stuff.

[13:52] Like what's he selling you at shows? He's selling you Jaws, he's selling you Beetlejuice, he's selling you the Munsters, he's selling you Beatles.

[14:00] Like you don't want to buy like an original IP back glass from Christopher Franchi and he knows that.

[14:06] It's even hard to overestimate the value of a great licensed theme in pinball.

[14:12] Like nobody has an emotional connection to a tank or a star force.

[14:17] Like what is that? Now maybe, just maybe. What if maybe all of this is just to troll us?

[14:24] Maybe all of this is meant to throw us off the scent of what the game really is over at American Pinball.

[14:32] What if David Fixed pulled a canada and actually got a licensed theme and said hey, let's fool everybody and put up a name like Galactic Star Force or Galactic Tank Force.

[14:46] And what if, just what if David Fixed used some of Mukesh's millions and went and got the theme and the license and the IP to make Dennis Norman's

[15:01] The Last Star Fighter. Wouldn't Galactic Star Force be a great codename for The Last Star Fighter?

[15:11] Are you excited now? See, that's the kind of theme. That's the kind of theme that American Pinball needs to go after.

[15:18] A niche movie that has enough of a following, enough of an emotional connection to people who grew up in the 80s to sell at least a thousand of them.

[15:31] If they made The Last Star Fighter with Centauri and Alex and just a kid from the trailer park and if that's all you think you are then that's all you're ever going to be.

[15:42] Sign me up David Fix. This is what people want. They don't want a random game about a tank. If you make a random game about a tank, I'm telling you right now, they're going to tank the company.

[15:56] This is not going to work in modern pinball. It's also not going to work with these prices now being $9,000 and up. It's not going to work.

[16:04] I hope it's The Last Star Fighter. Right now David Fix is like, oh crap, we should have done what Canada just said or oh crap, Canada guessed it.

[16:14] But right now I've set all of your expectations. Let's just make it up right now. American Pinball's next game is Rumored to be The Last Star Fighter.

[16:23] Maybe if I admit that the rumors are completely made up then I'll get covered by some of the other pinball media.

[16:29] Alright alright alright people. I mean that's really it. So we also know that this AP game is going to drop at Expo.

[16:36] We're going to see a sneak peek of it at the CoinTaker tailgating party end of September and then a month from then we know David Fix is going to roll this game out at Expo.

[16:46] And I love how they talked about how like that's the best way to launch a game is to have it on location all across the premier arcades in America.

[16:54] No it's not. The best way to launch a pinball machine in 2022 is not to waste money shipping games to arcades where you're not even charging them.

[17:05] The best way to launch a game is not to stream it with people's crappy rigs and cell phones.

[17:12] The best way to launch a pinball machine in 2022 is to make a nice video and upload it to something called the Internet which gives you immediate access to thousands of your buyers without having to spend any money once you make the video.

[17:30] That's the smart way to launch the game David Fix. You need to get out of 1993. This guy's stuck in 1993. It's like he can't get out of it.

[17:40] He's like stuck in an arcade in 1993. I think he just needs to get out of that arcade and realize and show respect that Stern Pinball and Jersey Jack Pinball know how to launch machines.

[17:52] You're not a better marketer David than Jack Danger. You're not a better marketer than Ken Cromwell. The videos made by Straight Down the Middle are better than just dropping a game in five arcades and having people stream it.

[18:04] So what else is going on in pinball? Well look if you spend $12,000 on Toy Story LE and you feel like you wanted to spend more don't worry because you can now buy the accessories for the game coming from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[18:18] I mean look they're probably going to offer the shooter rod some topper and some inner art blades and that's fine but it's just at the point now where my gosh you're going to be what like $13,000 in on a machine that's going to lose.

[18:33] I think a few thousand dollars in value in just the next six months. Alright spooky pinball. I want to just debunk a rumor right since canade has been debunked all last week.

[18:43] Let's debunk a rumor on another media channel. I'm here to debunk the rumor that spooky pinballs next game will be one design with two themes attached to it just like Ultraman and Halloween.

[18:57] I'm here to tell you it is not going to be that. It is going to be just one game and it is Scooby Doo and you heard Scooby Doo here first and yet everyone else will tell you news it's Scooby Doo when it happens.

[19:10] So spooky pinballs, Scooby Doo will not have another theme associated with it.

[19:16] Spooky learned its lesson with Halloween in Ultraman. They are still not happy with the reaction to those games and I think they're going to pack Scooby Doo and I hope they do because they need to win the goodwill back of the community with a packed game that launches with code that's not embarrassing.

[19:33] And they better have hired an animator because they can't get away with animations like the ones in Halloween.

[19:39] Alright what else is happening in the pinball world? So some fathoms are getting out. I want to congratulate you fathom owners who have received your game.

[19:47] As I've been reporting every week I'm still a bit concerned that they are asking people to pay in fall when their games are not in a box.

[19:56] I think that speaks to a cash flow issue. There are still series ticket holders that were told when they paid in fall they would have their game in 8 weeks.

[20:06] It's now been 16 weeks and some of them still do not have their games.

[20:12] And as of last week Haggis Pinball told my friend Kim Mitchell, please pay in fall and you'll have your game in 8 weeks.

[20:20] So this seems to be like their 2 weeks. You know the way Andrew Highway would say 2 weeks.

[20:25] Haggis Pinball is telling everyone you'll have your game in 8 weeks and when 8 weeks come and go and you don't have your game there's really nothing you can do.

[20:34] You've paid them in fall. Now you will get your game but I don't understand why the time frame they're giving people is so off.

[20:42] It just shouldn't be this way. Like they should know better by now. It's been a year Damien and Marty.

[20:48] You should know better by now what your actual production time frame is and you should be more accurate with your customers when you ask them to pay in fall.

[21:00] You've already misled everybody who invested in your company because when they put their deposit down you said you would not ask for full payment until their games were in a box and ready to ship.

[21:12] So it is a cash flow problem. I hope it doesn't lead to any serious issues. I hope they get more of these games out before the recession hits.

[21:22] But people we all know what's coming. More and more of our financial portfolios are going to get hit really hard and the cost of everything is going up.

[21:33] And many of us are looking at our pinball spending and saying this hobby isn't what it used to be. I used to be able to buy three games for what is now the price of one game.

[21:45] And many of you remember that time. The new guys coming into the hobby right now. I don't know what to tell you. I would just be patient. I would find your dream themes.

[21:55] I would play them and make sure you enjoy the game. And if it's something that brings you happiness life is short by all means go grab it.

[22:03] I'm not here to tell you not to buy stuff. I'm not here to tell you like what your price limit should be on each game.

[22:08] But I am here to tell you that all of pinball and everybody in this hobby that's enjoyed the whole new inbox craze of pinball over the last five years like I have this entire hobby has crossed the Rubicon now with the prices being where they're at.

[22:23] Each and every one of us is going to look at every game much differently. And we are really looking at these games and demanding that we see the value for the money.

[22:34] I want to say like we always should have been this way. But if you look back over the years like we actually were getting like some really good games for some really good prices.

[22:44] Now we're getting some really high prices and we're not sure if the games are going to match up with those prices. See the problem is this in pinball.

[22:53] You can't just give people the same product and charge 40 percent more like you could do that like you could charge that much more.

[23:02] But it doesn't make anybody feel good and you absolutely can't do what Jersey Jack just did. You can't increase prices by like 30 percent and then give us 30 percent less on a game that's got 40 percent less demand than guns and roses.

[23:18] You can't do it like that. You know and that's the hard part of marketing is you got to try to figure this stuff out before you go to market.

[23:26] I really think someone at JJP should have said this isn't the one. We can't charge this much for this game. We also can't make a thousand of them.

[23:35] We need to be honest about what's in front of us and all they needed to do the easiest way Jersey Jack pinball team should have been honest.

[23:43] All they had to do to remain honest with themselves was look at the very games they made if they went from dialed in to Pirates of the Caribbean Wizard of Oz guns and roses and then walked over to Toy Story.

[23:58] Someone should have said wait a minute guys we can't charge 15 grand for this. They didn't have to look anywhere else.

[24:05] They should have looked inside their own company and the reason why we all value JJP is we felt like they were always going to give us much more than everyone else.

[24:15] They didn't do it but they charged us more. They're going to realize just like spooky how quickly the pinball fans are like a flock of birds.

[24:24] We will easily migrate over to some other offering if we feel like the values no longer there because the ultimate reality in all of pinball and the reason why Stern pinball has like 80% of the market is they've been giving us the greatest value all of these years.

[24:42] They've been giving us the greatest themes. They now have like some of the greatest coders the greatest designers and some of the most beautiful pinball machines I've ever seen have a Stern pinball logo on them and it's not me shilling them.

[24:57] You know it's crazy about Stern is because they do so many games a year sometimes we forget how many games they've made and how many of them are really really good games and it's not impossible to beat Stern.

[25:11] But you got to get a theme people want you got to make the art package special you got to make sure the game shoots great you got to make sure the game has some toys and some magical wow in the game because if you can't make a game better than a Stern pro there's absolutely no point you being in the pinball market and I mean that

[25:30] and that should be the benchmark for every single boutique company are you listening to me David fix if you can't make a game better than a Stern pro don't even bother that needs to be the benchmark everybody have a great weekend I am going to jack bar hopefully tomorrow to play toy

[25:47] story enjoy it and still not buy it I'm going to see if John let me in early so I can do my Saturday morning spectacular from there it'll be super fun to see the game play the game and actually talk to John and have him whisper in my ear that this is the greatest game ever everybody thank you for being a club member I love doing these shows every week for you I'll be back soon next week's going to be fun we're going to get a new game from Stern pinball I love weeks when we get a new pinball machine it just makes all of this hobby so much more fun.

[26:17] I'll talk to you soon.

[26:47] you
