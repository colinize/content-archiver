[00:00] You see this is why this is why we can't have nice things Barry you asshole

[00:14] Sunday night in New York City and I got nothing better to do than a pinball podcast and I have to say this

[00:20] This is gonna be another one of the short little ranteed canada pinball podcast

[00:24] And I'll tell you why I got to be honest with you guys these things do better and outperformed than any of

[00:29] The long podcast that I do I would love to do interviews with awesome guys like Josh Cuggler and and Ben Heck and and Ted all the time

[00:39] But you guys have shown me cheerly by your

[00:43] Participation that the short quick stuff is the best so let's get right to it

[00:48] I didn't want to call this pinside babies 2.0 even though I am going to talk about a lot of stuff that you guys have been

[00:53] Wining about again, so let's start with the first and foremost thing that has got everyone's thumb in their mouth

[00:59] And that's ghost busters and the magnetic slings so they've finally been revealed after all this time

[01:06] Everyone's heard about them. Everyone's speculated what they'll be like

[01:11] Everyone's been excited to see them and what happens Stern finally gives us a two minute video of these things in action

[01:18] And I must say I don't think I've seen a more

[01:22] House divide it than people's response to these things

[01:27] Here's here's what here's my take on it and the video is not the best

[01:31] I'm gonna start there Stern come on what is going on at Stern?

[01:35] We're gonna talk about this in another Stern marketing effort that happened over the past week

[01:39] But if you're gonna show a video of the thing that people have been waiting a really really long time for

[01:46] I don't think you're doing it justice

[01:49] I really don't this sort of like low-fi off to an angle video of it

[01:54] And then you know you sort of are also stating on top of that that this is just early code of the slings

[02:02] Really are we we really have to hear that not only is the game code something that takes a long time

[02:10] There's also gonna be code for the magnetic slings

[02:12] I just thought the whole thing was not really up to par with how Stern usually reveals sort of play field features of this magnitude

[02:21] But look I'll give them a pass on this

[02:24] I really should in but they should have just given us better video and explanation of how these things are gonna work

[02:30] But here's a thing and I don't really care

[02:31] I didn't ever a huge problem with the video because I think what I saw looked pretty freaking cool

[02:38] It looked cool. It looked like a different game than we normally get it looked like

[02:45] Pinball innovation in motion and the fact that some of you out there continue to wine and

[02:51] Mone and grown that you want innovation in pinball

[02:54] Well, this is it this is it and can everybody please for the love of God stop asking the stupidest question and that question is

[03:02] Can they behave like normal slings?

[03:06] Really for fuck's sake

[03:08] Why do you want these things to act like normal slings?

[03:11] It is so idiotic

[03:12] It is like buying a car with horse power and asking the dealership

[03:17] Hey, can this car behave like a horse instead of a car?

[03:21] Why do you want these things to behave like normal slings?

[03:25] You have normal slings in every single game. This is the first game ever

[03:30] Let me repeat that ever that is using magnetic slings. Why would Stern want them to behave like normal slings and from what I saw

[03:39] It can do stuff that mimics what a normal sling does, but it's different

[03:44] It's different and it's new and I'm telling you this that is gonna be the coolest feature on this game

[03:51] People are gonna say oh here's this game that does this here's Metallica where you hit Sparky

[03:56] Oh my god, and you have to jump on Ghostbusters. It's got this really awesome feature where it's got these magnetic slings and the

[04:02] Ghost control the ball and the game has a mind of its own only Ghostbusters and that theme

[04:09] Can have magnetic slings do what they do and and guys stop

[04:14] It's please stop

[04:16] Saying stupid stuff like Stern is gonna code the magnetic slings where the ball stops in the middle and goes straight down the middle

[04:24] What do you think they're idiots like they're gonna code this thing so that it creates straight down the middle drains all the time

[04:32] I mean what what are people thinking so they see in a video that one time the ball freezes and goes down the middle

[04:38] You think that's really gonna be the way it's gonna work? No, it's not and so look we have this Ghostbusters thread and it's it's

[04:45] It's it's I don't even know page 200 and something it's 10,000 plus comments and people are just

[04:51] Mony and groaning about the slings and making matters worse as if the thread wasn't already

[04:58] Pass its expiration date. We've got to have Captain Kirk in this thread which is it is more annoying than the discussion

[05:05] I'll say why because Kirk we get it you love Ghostbusters

[05:10] But the guy chimes in like every other post as if he made this machine

[05:14] I feel like the guy is gonna order two Ghostbusters pinball machines

[05:18] One to play and one to bury himself in because he's just that in love with the machine and it's like

[05:25] Here's what's annoying to you. He's never played it

[05:28] He's defending the magnetic slings which is idiotic just as much as people who are saying they're stupid are idiotic

[05:34] Everyone is gonna have to just do one thing and wait and play the magnetic slings and make up your mind

[05:41] It's not gonna make people drop out on their LEDs

[05:44] I still think Ghostbusters is gonna be amazing. I still think the magnetic slings are gonna be awesome

[05:50] And I think people are gonna realize it's gonna make the game more fun

[05:55] Stern wouldn't put these things in the machine if they ruined the machine

[06:01] I think it's an awesome innovation and for all you guys out there who keep bitching that you want innovation

[06:08] This is it except it. It's gonna be awesome

[06:11] You're just but hurt you guys who didn't get in on the Ellie onto the next topic

[06:15] Hey guys if you listen really closely you can hear people golf clapping to the fact that the big Lebowski is now shipping

[06:26] Share that it's like really quiet because nobody gives a shit

[06:31] I've never seen a thread about a pinball machine that used to be the darling of the industry

[06:39] Announce that they're shipping and nobody cares the thread is already like on page two

[06:45] It's got not even three pages of comments. There's absolutely no

[06:51] There's no no hype left in this machine

[06:55] This is a great case study for how not to launch a pinball machine and keep people excited now

[07:02] I want to call out some reasons why I think people have just given up on giving a shit and

[07:07] caring about the big Lebowski shipping and I think you know the first and foremost thing is the two-year weight right

[07:13] They came out like rock stars

[07:15] They sort of started crapping on all the competition before they even manufactured a single game

[07:19] And then the whole sort of thing collapsed the house of cards came down

[07:24] Someone whistle blew that they didn't have the license they'd have bringing Roger sharp

[07:28] They basically re-engineered the whole game

[07:31] You know they're they're contract manufacturing this thing

[07:34] They showed us robots months ago spring clear coat

[07:38] But finally I guess it's it's shipping. How do we know it's shipping because they showed us a picture of

[07:45] Three of them strapped to three boxes that say big Lebowski on it strapped to crates

[07:50] I don't think there's anything in those boxes. I want those boxes cut open ladies gentlemen. I want to see a

[07:58] Final game in that box that could just be a box. How do we know there's actually pinball machines inside there

[08:04] I you know why I'm skeptical because they're not really so they don't have to ship those three

[08:10] If they're gonna ship them the normal freightway unless they have wait for it

[08:16] 30 seven others ready to go to be delivered

[08:20] You guys know the way they're doing this it's so ridiculous

[08:23] So here's the way big Lebowski is say they're gonna ship the pinball machines

[08:26] You can either

[08:29] Order yours and they're gonna ship out 40 at a time

[08:33] To fill the crate

[08:35] Whatever the the freaking I don't know whatever the big crate is that goes on a ship

[08:42] They're gonna put 40 of them together to limit to make the cost more

[08:47] I think I don't even think that's necessary

[08:49] But I think for them it is because they do one at a time and then you pay from there

[08:53] To get the normal freight rate from the state so ostensibly three to four hundred dollars or or if you'd like

[09:01] You can have your game sent via let's see

[09:05] You know right from

[09:07] Direct shipment by air you can have your game from factory to your house for the cheap price the low price of

[09:14] $1,450 that would make this machine

[09:18] $10,000 plus 1450 that's $11,450

[09:22] Is there a tax on that too? I think so

[09:26] That's a

[09:27] Shitload of money for one pinball machine and that shipping is a lot now

[09:32] My speculation is this and I might be way off people and it might just be Sunday night in New York City

[09:37] And can it is gonna say something completely crazy

[09:39] But I think that 1450 rate is absolute hogwash and I think what Dutch is trying to do

[09:46] Is they're trying to find people who are inpatient and don't want to wait for the bulk of 40 to be ready?

[09:53] Who are gonna go in on that price and I think they're gonna make a nice penny on that 1450?

[09:59] Because they need to make up some earnings

[10:01] There is no way they revealed this pin two years ago and had nothing going off the line had nothing being manufactured

[10:09] And they need to recoup some of that money now

[10:12] I'd the price went up to 10 grand but I think that 1450 is gonna put a nice chunk of change back in their pocket

[10:19] The other speculation too is like

[10:22] You know how far along is the code on this thing?

[10:24] How far how far along is the code? I mean last time we saw this pinball machine

[10:28] I saw it at Texas pinball festival

[10:30] It it still needed a lot of work. It just didn't feel like a cohesive game

[10:35] So they haven't really said like how far the code is it's definitely not complete

[10:41] So again like I don't know I think this game has failed to really blow people away in the past year when people demoed it

[10:49] So I think that's another reason why there's just complete crickets in that thread

[10:53] You know that they're interesting part about this pin is when we look at the cost of shipping because the whole thread started

[10:58] Turning into a discussion around shipping because why snow asked right away?

[11:03] You know where they shipping these from because he said highway manages the airship to us for under $500

[11:09] So the conversation sort of steered into like why is it costing so much to ship these things?

[11:14] Here's the thing highway

[11:15] shipping air shipping from from them to you for 500 bucks is complete BS

[11:21] They are taking a bath if they think they can hit that number consistently

[11:24] I I don't want to go down the highway road

[11:27] I've got a little special treat at the end of this podcast from about highway

[11:32] But 500 bucks no way

[11:36] Let's see taz on pin size says I can't wait for it to arrive. I wonder what game they'll make next

[11:45] Really we're really speculating what Dutch Pimbal's second Pimbal machine is they've made three people

[11:52] Three Stern Pimbal has nine games on the line right now nine and this company has made three games

[12:02] In two years and I don't even know if they've shipped have they been picked up are they going out tomorrow?

[12:09] Possibly or are they waiting for 37 others to be ready before they go out and it still think it still looks like people are

[12:16] Months away from getting their Pimbal machine if they went in early on this machine

[12:20] So big Lebowski it's shipping nobody cares. Let's go on to the next topic all right

[12:26] So the hobbit is shipping which is great news and there's a story that a lot of people

[12:31] are talking about how some guy

[12:34] Ordered his hobbit. I think on like April 1st or something from a distributor and he got a hobbit on April 9th

[12:41] So the guy basically waited a week brand new

[12:45] Saw the game wanted it waited a week got it new inbox

[12:50] paid

[12:51] MSRP for probably a little bit less and

[12:54] All of a sudden everyone's bitching and moaning again because here we go all over again

[13:00] Jersey Jack is taking new money over old money because the old money is already in the bank and is being used to build the games to sell to new customers

[13:08] Is Jack doing it again with the hobbit and people saw that happened with was and I don't know yet

[13:14] I really don't know this but here's

[13:16] One point that I want to make on this and I'm not going down the hobbit road

[13:19] Don't worry hobbit fans. I'm not gonna say anything about your precious hobbit

[13:23] We all know you love it and and if you bought it

[13:26] It's the best game ever here's what I'm gonna say people need to stop acting like freaking morons when it comes to how

[13:32] Distributors sell pinball machines you you have to understand something a distributor is like a customer

[13:38] So when a distributor puts in an order for 10 pinball machines those 10 are going to him and then that distributor can

[13:47] Sell them to whoever they want all right in whatever order they want

[13:53] They might have taken orders for those 10 or they may not have but it doesn't people need to stop acting like I

[14:00] Ordered my hobbit pinball machine and it's not fair that that distributor could sell it canate up before I got mine

[14:07] Are you fucking kidding me? Of course that person can sell it. It's their pinball machine

[14:12] It's the same as someone who got theirs ahead of you if they want to just like sell it again to someone else

[14:18] You have to look at distributors like consumers. I'll use a car you meant if two people order a car and

[14:26] You order your car from dealership a and I order my car from dealership B

[14:31] Okay, all right, let's just say this you order your car from dealership a two years ago three years ago

[14:37] I didn't even order my car from dealership B all right and you are waiting for your car and

[14:45] Dealership B gets cars in the lot and I walk in and I didn't even order one yet and he'll sell me one and I buy it

[14:52] That's not

[14:54] Ford fucking with you saying you know

[14:57] We gave it to to canada before you and you know you know you're not as important as a customer

[15:03] No, it just means that that dealer aka distributor in this case has an allotment and has one available for sale

[15:10] And and it's it's just absolutely annoying that people can't figure out how distributors work in the pinball world

[15:18] They are like customers, okay? They have their pins they can sell them when they have them available if it's not

[15:25] Spoken for it's gonna get sold to the first person who wants it

[15:28] It doesn't matter how long you waited you're gonna get cut in line which leads me to a point

[15:34] Why do people even pre-order this shit in the first place?

[15:37] Why would you wait four years for the hobby just to save like 500 bucks and be in?

[15:44] Under agony for years waiting for the thing to come out when this is gonna happen all the time

[15:50] I think we're gonna see a lot more stories in 2016 of people who want to go get hobbits

[15:54] We're gonna go get them a hud of people who ordered them years ago

[15:58] It's gonna be a little bit of was all over again

[16:00] And no one has sympathy for

[16:02] Anyone on either side of the fence the guys who can go get it new congratulations good for you

[16:08] The guys who are gonna wine and complain you have nobody to blame but yourself because you knew it was gonna happen all right

[16:15] The last point I'll make on the hobbit is that

[16:19] It still seems like there's a lot of moaning about the modes and you can't stack the modes

[16:26] All right, I don't even I don't even know like if that matters or not

[16:31] But I'll say this I've never seen a machine in my life

[16:34] Have more people chime in and say the code is gonna fix everything

[16:40] I mean I look it's a pinball machine a great machine is a combination of code our shots layout

[16:48] How rewarding things are you know how fulfilling the code is and I mean

[16:53] God help Keith because he's got so much on his shoulders to make this game what people expect it to be so

[17:01] Like 1.01 code is out. I as I said before I don't know how to review this thing

[17:07] I guess I'm just gonna wait and see how it develops but you know

[17:11] Everyone thinks code is gonna save this machine. I still think

[17:14] The shots are not that rewarding and I don't care what the code is. I still think the game

[17:20] Play is a little floaty and slow and that is my opinion and love one last point on hobby because I know I said I wasn't gonna do it

[17:28] But I'm gonna do it

[17:29] Anyone who thinks that those lock rollovers or a good idea is smoking crack people because we want to talk about

[17:36] Changing trajectory of the ball those things are in the worst position and every time I play the hobbit

[17:42] I just watch the ball hit them roll around them and a lot of times go straight down the middle

[17:47] So I don't think I've ever seen a worse position of lock rollovers than the hobbit has so all right

[17:53] Let's go on to the next topic. I got great news ladies and gentlemen

[17:58] Canada is gonna be taking over

[18:01] The pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas. It's true

[18:06] I know that Tim Arnold has been looking for his protege and

[18:10] He saw his protege in canada. He did he called me up

[18:14] I said canada, you know, I've been looking I've been trying to find that special little boy who grew up loving pinball

[18:19] That little boy who loves EM machines who can just lift it up and and want to tinker with it

[18:25] I need that special little boy who's gonna yell at little children as they bang on the glass

[18:31] And you're my man canada. You're my man

[18:34] I want you to take over this collection

[18:35] I want you to go out there and finish my mission. I want you to go hoard as many boards as you can

[18:42] I want you to hoard as many products

[18:45] That will never be made and store them all and just have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things lying around that will never ever get used

[18:53] And I want you to do it off of charity and I said Tim you and I we're like brothers my man

[18:59] Everything I do is for charity. I don't make any money doing this damn podcast

[19:03] I don't I don't I'm not in this for the for the the accolade for the acclaim for the awards

[19:10] For the IFPA points for the pop a championship. I'm in this with you my man

[19:15] And so he's gonna give me the keys and I'm you know the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go into that place

[19:21] And I'm gonna I'm gonna clean it up place is a bit of a dump. I have to be honest

[19:26] I was just in Las Vegas and the last thing I would do is carve out some of my Vegas trip to go to that place and

[19:34] Yeah, I get it. It's a big place full of pinball machines, but that's all it is

[19:39] There's it's it's like a hanger where pinball machines go to die. It feels to me a little more like a big

[19:45] You know

[19:47] A big funeral home for pinball versus a place that embodies the life of pinball the spirit of pinball

[19:53] You can't just shove games in a hanger and call it a day

[19:57] Place needs an overhaul needs to feel fun and needs to feel like an arcade and needs to feel like a place that you a family would want to go and

[20:05] The environment at which pinball appears is just as important as the pinball itself

[20:10] And that is why barcades are doing so well that is what is causing the resurgence of pinball

[20:15] It's not just the home collector

[20:17] It's also the barcades that are out there and I'll say this when you get it

[20:21] We see it in a thread for people's home collections some of these home arcades are incredible

[20:26] They're incredible. They're fun places to go when I look at guys like

[20:29] Fraulix arcade and and some of you other guys who are building these incredible incredible homes

[20:35] You know the game rooms are fun. They're inviting the pinball hall of fame and not so much so Tim Arnold

[20:42] You know, I think this whole thing is just a PR thing and then he's not he's never gonna find his protege

[20:47] You know, he makes it sound like he's like you know the emperor Palpatine looking for his next in command

[20:53] To take over the empire with him and but knowing the kind of personality. He is I can just tell from that story

[20:58] He's he's never nothing's ever gonna be good enough. He doesn't even want

[21:02] I don't even think he wants people playing his games. It's just weird thing and

[21:07] So you know, I think this time I sure he'll still be looking for his protege, but

[21:12] What am I talking about he found it? Can it is gonna be taking that place over?

[21:15] I'm gonna turn it into a strip joint. All right next topic. All right

[21:19] I got a few machines that I would just like some updates on can I please get some updates whoever out there has any

[21:26] Updates on the following games will you please provide them via

[21:31] Pigeon mail via email via pinside via Facebook Twitter you do anything knock on my door

[21:37] Be like here's the update canada pinball circus

[21:40] What the f is going on with pinball circus? Where are the 12 pinball circuses?

[21:46] There has been nothing crickets

[21:50] Annoying that there is nothing on these games. I don't think they even care. They probably sold the 12

[21:56] They're gonna end up as these obscure items and and that's that

[22:00] But it'd be nice to get an update on that next game. I would like an update on captain Nemo

[22:05] All right for those of you who haven't followed captain Nemo is this really really beautiful game

[22:11] It's a beautiful game. I am not even looking at notes on it. So I'm sorry

[22:15] I don't even I think it I think I want to say Spain or Italy or part

[22:20] It's it's they're supposed to be like 20 made

[22:23] I thought some people in the States were getting it and I if you go into the captain Nemo thread on pinside

[22:29] You'll see canada constantly asking any updates any updates any updates

[22:33] Why because I think that game is beautiful? I would love to see like if more of them got made

[22:39] I also think that is the best pinball machine ever to integrate the

[22:43] The monitor or sorry the display into the play field the way the artwork carries over

[22:48] But anyway anyone any updates on Nemo please share them with us all right. I'm gonna go into now

[22:56] The most ridiculous comment of the week. This is something I I may do consistently but

[23:01] The most ridiculous comment of the week comes from pin cider

[23:07] M.O.F. I don't know if that's M.O.F. or M.O.F.

[23:10] And this comment came within a hobbit thread

[23:15] M.O.F. said and I quote

[23:17] This game looks like it shoots extremely well

[23:20] I'm a big fan of the balance of shots two spinners three banks of drops three flippers and the absence of many playfields

[23:29] I am open to the idea that it may very well be the best layout of all time

[23:37] M.O.F. you get canada pinballs

[23:43] podcast

[23:44] most ridiculous comment of the week awarded I mean congratulations. I mean

[23:51] Saying the hobbit might be the best layout of all time

[23:58] really really

[24:01] Someone check is is is M.O.F. a duplicate account for Jack because we know Jack's been off the site for a while

[24:08] Is it a duplicate account for Lloyd someone from J.J.P. must

[24:13] Either be M.O.F. or have infiltrated M.O.F. but my man no way can you even make a

[24:20] Statement that the hob is the best layout of all time

[24:24] Most codes maybe or I'm sorry most modes

[24:27] Most unique armor you could even say like it's the prettiest pin, but best layout

[24:32] Sorry, all right. So is it true the rumor that John Papa Duke has secured some more money

[24:41] That's what I'm hearing too in the grapevine now that grapevine often produces sour grapes, but

[24:49] Who knows if this is true or not?

[24:51] But here's the thing it doesn't matter

[24:53] Does it really matter if John gets more money?

[24:57] because I don't know what the money gets him

[25:01] Because it's not all the money in the world is not gonna turn John into a manufacturer and that's what he needs a

[25:09] manufacturer and

[25:11] Would I still love to see magic girl Raza and Alice in Wonderland come out of course I would I think everyone who

[25:19] Is down on those games or wants to hate those games is

[25:23] also

[25:24] Torrent inside because there's no denying that there's something there

[25:28] There's I mean obviously they're gorgeous to look at

[25:30] I mean, but magic girl needs a redesign the playfield doesn't work. It doesn't shoot

[25:35] It's clear that John never even built a whitewood

[25:38] When you think about that for a minute that John never built a freaking whitewood and

[25:43] He just put art over it and just wanted to see something beautiful, but never really shot it

[25:50] It's kind of scary and I had someone point out to me

[25:53] But if you look at the magic girl layout, it's very similar to tales of the Arabian Knights

[25:57] I mean John sort of has his layouts and he sticks with them

[26:01] And so I think he just thought like oh this is work before and I you know, I'll just put

[26:07] Something else here and he just kept layering on top of what has worked for him in the past and the whole thing just sort of

[26:13] feels and looks right now like a mess

[26:17] So I don't know I think if we're gonna see magic girl come out. I think it needs to be sort of redone

[26:23] Stripped down a little bit and it needs to sort of find its way, but I don't see how

[26:30] More money can help that situation what I think everybody wants to see is that

[26:35] A manufacturer has partner with John is gonna bring the game into fruition and

[26:40] I mean, I think the only people in town who could help him would be stern

[26:44] But there's no reason why stern would do it. Why would they ever do it? It's just it's not worth their while and all those different unique pieces

[26:51] That John made and refabricated the pointless items that no one will ever see

[26:57] It's not worth turns wild at the manufacturer those things. So I don't think it's ever gonna happen

[27:02] But people can keep dreaming

[27:03] But it's just never ever ever ever gonna see the light of day

[27:07] So a friendly listener in the show Joe hit me up and was like canada what what what what are you doing man?

[27:12] You've got to call out stern for how they

[27:15] Bouched up the kiss code launch this week and he said you're a marketer and

[27:20] As a marketer, how can you like let this go and and he's right and I want to talk about this real quickly

[27:26] But the what stern did with the kiss code launch

[27:33] Is

[27:34] Again, just I don't know what's going on and I know they didn't they know how to do marketing very well

[27:39] And this just seemed like so fumbled on their part. So for those of you who don't know it's it's shocking when you think back

[27:47] But kiss le owners have had their games since July

[27:52] of 2015 or that's almost a year

[27:56] These guys have been waiting

[27:58] With a game that's basically beta code for anything now that's a long long time to wait and not have your machine come alive

[28:08] I mean hobbit owners were able to get a new code in a few weeks after it shipped

[28:15] There's so there's no excuse there's no excuse

[28:18] I hope that game at their own sort of turn to page in terms of code and how far it will you know code will be along with game ship

[28:25] So what happens so they're waiting they're waiting and then

[28:30] Stern starts teasing on their

[28:32] Social channels that the code is coming

[28:35] But when people are waiting this long you can't tease it like there's no one

[28:41] People

[28:42] deserve it right they they're not excited

[28:47] The way stern is and I think that's the key with marketing

[28:50] You always have to put yourself in the shoes of your customer if your customer is beyond frustrated

[28:57] You can't tease something out in a celebratory fashion

[29:02] Knowing that these guys have been in pain for so long they just wanted they don't care

[29:06] They don't want it delivered with a bow with fancy shiny

[29:11] wrapping paper they don't want to slowly know that it's going to be revealed they just wanted

[29:17] They don't want anything else but to code and so to tease it like that

[29:21] I think is is a marketing mistake. It's a little bit like

[29:25] Ha ha we know what you want and now you're about to get it

[29:28] But even so okay, so you don't start teasing something until you know

[29:34] And you're confident that it's going to be launched on a specific date right so that's and they were the so they they planned to launch it

[29:42] Uh later last week and so they're working back from that

[29:46] But then at the eleventh hour they put up a post saying

[29:49] They found a few bugs in it and they have to go back and rework it and they're going to get it done ASAP now

[29:56] What and they I know they wrote like they're going to call the orkin man and they found bugs but again like

[30:02] There this is not a laughing matter for anyone who's been waiting for this code and I think stern just needs to not

[30:10] Take that position. I just don't think it does them any good. I don't think anyone is laughing

[30:17] I think people are really pissed off and I think they want to more of an apology versus a celebratory sort of tease

[30:26] Ha ha here we are like chessbeat here's the code

[30:29] that being said

[30:31] I hope the code comes out

[30:33] Really soon. I hope the bugs aren't that massive and I think in the future

[30:38] And I just wish we could get to a world where it wasn't all this way like this just waiting for code and games requiring so much

[30:47] Time before they're actually worth the investment and you can just have a

[30:52] 350 pound paperweight sit in your game room until it's finished

[30:57] I don't know. I just think it's silly. I really do. I don't want it sort of have it, you know take like

[31:04] Two three years before something becomes great like Wizard of Oz or two years like the walking dead and

[31:11] I don't know just by the time these games hit their peak

[31:15] The hypes moved on and I think that stern needs to not do that

[31:21] And I don't know if there's a solution to it. I really don't I think on one of my podcasts

[31:25] I was just hire more coders, but I guess it's not that simple but

[31:29] Get the kiss code out. I think it's gonna be a big one. I think you guys are gonna be really happy

[31:33] I think it's required just a little bit more patience

[31:37] But I also think that the the marketing around it should have been a little bit different knowing how fans are feeling having waited so long

[31:44] And the last point I want to make on this little half hour episode. I can end his pinball podcast

[31:50] Um

[31:51] It's a serious one and I saw that

[31:55] Comet pinball is up for sale and and so is Titan pinball and we see this story often and and

[32:03] first I want to wish art

[32:06] A speedy recovery art art explain that he has to sort of give this up because he's having

[32:12] Uh some some a heart condition and he needs to focus on that and

[32:17] And I commend him because it's it's there's so much more in life than pinball

[32:23] And and health is the most important thing and um

[32:28] You know, I I talk a lot about pinball and on this podcast and

[32:33] I would say that gaming and pinball is something that I think a lot about

[32:38] But more than it and more than that I do think about

[32:43] Health and wellness as as as the priority of life and I'll give you guys a little background and quickly into my life

[32:49] But I always grew up um

[32:52] Around people that had a lot of health problems close family members and I watched them struggling

[32:56] I watched them in pain and I saw one very simple thing is no matter

[33:01] How much you accomplish in this world no matter how much you're surrounded by the items you love and even the people you love if your health is not there

[33:09] You will always

[33:12] always

[33:13] Wish it was and as long as you have your health

[33:17] Nothing else really matters that much and that is the truth and I and I have to say that within the community

[33:24] It's great that we all rally around each other

[33:27] But I think we also should push and support each other to live healthier lives and I know that sounds like

[33:33] cliché and

[33:35] You know little to earnest for this community, but I have to say the pinball community is not really one

[33:41] That's based around like healthy lifestyle and healthy living and I wish it was and I wish more people did consider that because

[33:48] Standing in front of a pinball machine and playing pinball for hours isn't very healthy

[33:54] And especially for a lot of these guys who do it for hours and hours and hours and hours of day

[34:00] It can it can wear you down and you know, I wish that

[34:04] All of us find the the right balance in life and it is about balance and finding that balance and

[34:12] I

[34:13] Really really really wish that all of you are happy and healthy

[34:18] I really do I mean I know we take some personal jabs at each other every once in a while and we argue about things like magnetic slings and

[34:26] artwork on pinball machines and

[34:29] LEs versus premium versus pros and I and we all know that deep down inside these arguments and these conversations are

[34:38] Tribble

[34:39] Ultimately pointless in the larger scheme of things and we can't take pinball machines with us

[34:46] And we want to be able to play pinball right as much as we can as long as we can and we want to be around the people in the hobby as long as we can and so

[34:55] uh, I really hope that everyone out there

[34:59] Everyone out there finds that balance between the games they love the people they love

[35:05] and and and ultimately

[35:08] Lives along in healthy life and and the key to that it's not a mystery

[35:11] It's not a mystery and I tell this to my friends and I tell this to my family and I tell this to myself every day

[35:17] It there's a lot of things are out of our control in this world. I can't control the way how fast

[35:23] Stern releases code. I can't control how fast

[35:28] You know, I can't control the artwork on a pinball machine, but I can't control my body and I can't control what I

[35:34] And I can't control how I live in my lifestyle and that doesn't even even with all those things

[35:38] I still make it sick one day

[35:39] I still might find out that I have something or I wake up to cancer one day or

[35:44] But I hope I don't and the way I hope I don't is I I try to balance out my life and I just hope that everyone

[35:51] puts pinball and puts life in the right balance and that's it

[35:54] That's it and we all can be healthy and we can be screaming at the top of our lungs at each other

[36:00] But I hope we do so in a way that doesn't give us heart attacks or or make us

[36:05] You know sick and and have to give it up for good because that's what happens when you don't take care of yourself

[36:11] You end up giving up the things you love for good

[36:15] And we don't want to see anyone do that. So that's it for can't this pinball podcast today

[36:19] I want to wish you guys a happy and a healthy. I know this was a bunch of rants. I'm sure taxman will

[36:25] Break this down for you and say it's the same old knitted crap over and over and over again

[36:29] And but he'll listen to every single episode over and over taxman. I love you. Keep it up. It's great. I know I'm annoying

[36:34] I know you love it. Have a good night guys. Bye
