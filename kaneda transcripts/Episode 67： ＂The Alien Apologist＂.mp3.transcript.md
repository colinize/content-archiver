[00:00] You tell me that your song red didn't think I'd turn around

[00:05] And say it is too late, it's gonna die

[00:12] It's too late

[00:22] I find it absolutely hysterical that I am sitting down at almost 8 o'clock in the morning

[00:29] to record this podcast called The Alien Apologist

[00:33] And just as I'm going into the thread, I see that this individual has just posted like 27 seconds ago

[00:40] Which means he's up at 7 o'clock in the morning defending alien pinball

[00:46] And all I wanna do right now is very simple

[00:49] And I said I would do this when I spoke to these guys at expoD

[00:53] But I'm just gonna relay the facts

[00:56] And things people are doing and things people are saying

[00:58] But here is the reason why I wanna do this podcast

[01:02] Because I have just felt recently like everyone has to act like they are a champion

[01:09] And a supporter of every single company and every single pinball machine out there

[01:15] And I don't think that should ever be the case

[01:18] And I'll explain why

[01:19] And it's very simple

[01:21] Because people get burned in this industry over and over again for not asking the tough questions

[01:28] For not stepping back and looking at where they send their money

[01:33] Right, it's happened over and over again

[01:35] The fact that people gave Jay Pop money for Alice in Wonderland

[01:40] Right, when he had yet to deliver his first two games

[01:43] That's who pinball people are

[01:45] The fact that people gave Kevin money when he said he had the license to predator

[01:51] Featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger who's one of the most expensive actors to license in the history of Hollywood

[01:58] And yet this guy out of his mom's kitchen claims to have secured it

[02:02] So we've seen this ship go down many times

[02:06] And I'm not saying it's easy to predict

[02:09] Right, and that's always the difficult part about this podcast

[02:13] And when I do stuff like this is I can't just yell fire if I smell a little smoke

[02:19] But what I can do, what I can do on Canadian pinball podcast

[02:23] Is I can simply point out that there are certain individuals on pinside that perpetuate lies

[02:31] That keep people going down a path as if these people should be

[02:36] Are guaranteed that the outcome will be great

[02:40] And these individuals we all know who they are

[02:43] But I want to just highlight one

[02:45] And I'm calling this man the alien apologist

[02:49] And what I want to do is just read you his own words

[02:52] And I want to start out with these words

[02:55] This was from a year ago

[02:59] Just a guess that at least the first batch of ten will be in homes this year

[03:05] I'm sure how quick they can even build them but will likely take time to get a good production process down

[03:12] Okay, production process

[03:15] This is a term we heard a lot about yesterday in aliens update thread by Andrew

[03:23] And we're going to talk a lot about that

[03:25] But I want you all to just remember those words production process

[03:29] Because we're going to talk about that

[03:31] And the individual then goes on to say

[03:33] My best guess is that after the first batch goes out

[03:37] There will be feedback and tweaks with production

[03:40] Then I would bet things smooth out over time

[03:43] Similar to what we have seen with other new makers

[03:46] Alright

[03:48] Another post as individual made says the following

[03:52] Pretty sure the first batch going out is all the hardcore fans

[03:56] And most will be understanding that they are getting a fine-tuned and polished game

[04:00] But with any completely new product once in homes and getting tons of play

[04:05] There will likely be feedback for improvement

[04:07] Alright

[04:10] Okay, so those posts were a year ago by Pinsides Wise Snow

[04:15] And those posts were not about Alien Pimble

[04:19] Those posts were about Predator Pimble

[04:23] And what I want to do now is I want to compare the way Wise Snow has

[04:29] Talked about Predator

[04:31] And I want to then read about how he's talking about Alien

[04:35] And I want us to see the similarities in this individual

[04:39] And what he does on Pinside on a daily basis

[04:42] Because I think it's wrong

[04:44] I think it's wrong when these individuals go on

[04:47] And just blindly convince everyone to go in and send their money on a product

[04:53] If they don't know all the facts and how quickly these individuals sweep under the carpet

[04:58] Any information or any details that could be valuable to those who are uncertain

[05:05] Okay, so he goes on to say about Predator a year ago

[05:09] And this is when Jared was saying, look guys, I don't think he has a license

[05:13] Everyone needs to calm down

[05:15] Wise Snow went on to say, can we please stop with the bullshit licensing talk?

[05:20] It has already been debunked

[05:22] While Skid B may suck at communication

[05:25] They have made it clear that there are no issues with the license

[05:29] There were even some sick Pinside detectives from Texas that claimed to have contacted Fox months ago

[05:35] And they have not come back here with anything

[05:38] Try as they might to cause more harm

[05:40] This is limited license game and it is progressing with poor online communication

[05:45] At this point, there's not much else to talk about

[05:48] So right there, let's look at what he says knowing what we know

[05:53] Is how he was behaving all the time in that thread

[05:56] And we all know how the story ends, right?

[05:58] We all know that Predator didn't have the license that Kevin was lying, that everyone lost their money

[06:03] And that the people like Wise Snow who convinced everyone to stay in and that this was just normal

[06:08] And the fact that he had brought games around to shows was proof that the game was real

[06:14] You see individuals like Hilton, what they failed to realize is that

[06:19] Nothing is real until it's inbox and it's shipping

[06:23] That all of these start-up pinball companies are always tinkering with issues and problems and delays

[06:30] And financial woes until they get games in box

[06:33] And people should be cautious and people should not be spending money until games are finally inboxes

[06:40] And that is I think the new approach we all need to make

[06:43] Alright, so then

[06:45] Here's Hilton 10 months ago in the alien thread

[06:48] And again, just read this for similarities and understand what this man is continued to do to Pinside

[06:54] And continue to do the community as a whole in terms of constantly convincing us that everything is fine

[07:01] He wrote 10 months ago, for me, full throttle is what is giving alien a chance

[07:07] That is the game actively being built and getting the gears moving

[07:11] Sure, we'll be cool to see alien but without fault I think he's saying I would not even be considering alien

[07:18] Oh sorry, without full throttle I would not even be considering alien

[07:21] What I really hope is that we eventually see a woolly kit

[07:25] Alright, so basically what he's saying is because they built full throttle

[07:29] It's proof that everything is going to go fine with alien

[07:33] And I get it, they shipped full throttle

[07:35] And yes, like that seems like if one happens then two will happen

[07:40] Okay, he then went on to say another thread from about a year ago

[07:45] We have games from every manufacturer currently making games for play on route in Madison, Wisconsin

[07:52] And full throttle is by far the best built, least headache, best engineered

[07:57] And all around most sturdy of all the games we have put out in the past three years

[08:02] And you know, look, we all know of why Snow's love affair with highway

[08:06] But I mean the guy is kind of out of his mind

[08:09] I mean he's actually trying to say that full throttle is like the best built game that's come out

[08:14] And it's the best engineered game and it has absolutely no issues

[08:18] And look, it might not have switch issues and whatnot but like come on

[08:21] Okay, that's fine, what about like the game itself?

[08:25] What about the theme? What about the gameplay? What about the code?

[08:28] I mean, every no one thinks that full throttle is this amazing game except for this guy

[08:31] And what I'm trying to do is just paint a picture that it only takes one individual

[08:36] Who has a love affair with a company to bring a whole bunch of individuals with them over the edge

[08:42] And into a place that they should avoid, okay?

[08:45] He then wrote, so you, and at the stage in the whole alien storyline

[08:50] There were individuals that were posting certain information about highway

[08:54] And certain information about Andrew

[08:56] One of them was a post about, you know, he had like eight failed companies and whatnot

[09:00] And Andrew replied to that

[09:03] But when that started happening, right?

[09:06] When people started just simply questioning, does highway have any financial issues?

[09:10] Should I be somewhat concerned about sending in money for alien?

[09:13] And look, at the point those questions were being asked

[09:16] The alien game was a year delayed, a year, right?

[09:21] A year delayed, the number of full throttles that had been shipped did not seem very abundant

[09:28] There didn't seem to be many out there

[09:30] And so then when people started asking questions, what happened?

[09:33] Those people were swatted down and accused of trying to sabotage alien, pinball and highway pinball by people like wise snow

[09:41] And I'm sorry, but if you're in on a product and it's delayed for a year

[09:46] And the company's been around for four and a half years

[09:49] And won't tell you how many full throttles they shipped

[09:53] Doesn't the common sensical question in your head become, how can a company stay in business and ship so few games

[10:02] And have such a long delay on alien with no money coming in?

[10:07] Right? And you ask that question and you get bad it down, okay?

[10:12] And so wise snow said when those things started to develop and appear, he wrote

[10:18] Are there really concerns here?

[10:21] Highway has delivered a bunch of full throttles to large acclaim and praise

[10:26] Alright, let me just stop right there to large acclaim and praise

[10:31] Who? Who? Him and frolic?

[10:34] Two guys that no matter what they get new in box, they always claim is like the best pin ever

[10:40] And I just like, it's stuff like that that just annoys me to no end

[10:45] He goes on to say their customer service has been nothing short of amazing

[10:50] They seem to be very deep into development of aliens with expected reveal in the near future

[10:56] I would assume a flippable game prototype at Expo in under two months

[11:00] Companies come and go by all accounts the current highway is doing a lot of things right

[11:06] Alright, so you know then the story goes on and again we have these periods of things are being shared

[11:14] We're waiting on licensing from Fox and people are you know some people are asking questions but for the most part

[11:20] It's individuals that are just saying how much they love the theme and this and that

[11:25] Okay, so then Expo comes and people start getting excited right?

[11:30] They finally start to see stuff and there's like a physical game and there's like flippers that are working

[11:35] And you know there's still some work to be done in the game but it's there like it's in front of you

[11:39] Like and if there's anything that will make all of the skepticism in pinball buyers and collectors erode and dissipate

[11:46] It's that if you put something in front of them that looks like a pinball machine they will hand you their money

[11:51] Even if it's made out of foam core as we've seen with J-pop

[11:54] It's just something about people's emotional attachment when they see a physical pinball machine

[12:00] They just say take my money

[12:02] You know I believe that American pinball could have taken money on Houdini by just showing what they showed at Expo

[12:09] Even if it wasn't working it just looks so damn pretty

[12:12] Alright so here's what Wise know said and I know Iceman and we love Iceman

[12:17] We're talking to him soon hopefully

[12:19] But you know Iceman was saying like oh cool the game looks good like I'm gonna put in an order and on one

[12:23] And again like it's that rush to make a bold statement about how you're in on it

[12:29] Even if you don't know when it's coming out even if you don't know the status of the company

[12:34] So Iceman wrote that and then Wise know came in and said most importantly for me and Iceman

[12:41] They have the X factor, immersion

[12:44] Toss on your headphones, turn it up, rock a beverage and step into the world under the glass

[12:49] Super pumped to see the final product

[12:52] Iceman just send the deposit exclamation

[12:55] It is just a deposit and you are gonna want to get in the queue now in my honest opinion

[13:01] And when I read that I'm just like here we are all over again

[13:04] Here we are history repeating itself

[13:07] This is the same kind of show he was during the Predator days

[13:12] He's just confirming for people send your money in now

[13:15] Why? Why should Iceman send his money in now to get in the queue?

[13:20] Does anyone actually think that Alien Ellie is gonna be hard to get?

[13:26] Let's also remind ourselves that Alien Ellie has been for sale for over a year

[13:34] I think almost two years now right?

[13:37] It's not sold out

[13:39] There are only 500 being made

[13:42] It's not sold out, it's still not sold out

[13:45] Even after going to expo, even after being flipped

[13:50] Even after people have seen what it's going to be, it has not sold out

[13:55] So Iceman, do not, in my honest opinion, send your money in, chase after the hype

[14:02] And just take wise nose word for it

[14:06] I literally think this guy gets like a kickback for every deposit that gets sent in with the way he talks about it

[14:13] On the flip side, we see other Ellie's sell out immediately in a matter of seconds

[14:21] And so I think it's really dangerous and I'm reading a lot of similarities to what went on with Predator here

[14:29] And this like, hyping up of the game

[14:33] So then what is happened? The story continues right? And then again, this is the Alien Apologist

[14:39] When fourth throttle was made, it was said that this is a kick that the whole strategy behind these games is that you can buy one and then put the next game's play field into that cabinet

[14:51] Right? It's the swappable cabinets that really have become the primary differentiator for Highway Pimball

[15:01] Right? The whole reason the cabinet looks the way it does is so you can swap in play fields

[15:05] The whole reason the side art on the cabinet is the way it is is so you can pop it in and out

[15:09] So we learn that people who bought a full throttle will not be able to just pop in an Alien play field

[15:17] Because the computer and the CPU that is required for Alien is a better CPU than the full throttle one

[15:27] And the reason we heard is that two and a half years have gone by and in that time, which Andrew said, is it's an eternity in the computing world

[15:35] That we didn't expect it to take that long and we also had a lot of exciting things that we wanted to put into Alien that required more computing power

[15:45] Right? So now that that is out there, there is this whole nether level of apology going on around the fact that if you bought a full throttle, shouldn't you get your computer upgraded for free?

[15:59] Right? That was the contract, that was the deal, that once you bought one highway, once you bought into their platform, you wouldn't have to upgrade anything other than the CPU

[16:11] It turns out that that will not be the case that there will be a cause and I think the one thing everyone's missing here, and this question has been asked many many times

[16:21] It has never received an answer, but the reality is this, we are not talking about a lot of people

[16:27] Do you notice how there's not a lot of people on this thread saying, I own a full throttle and I'm pissed off about this

[16:33] And the reason you're not seeing that and not hearing that is not many people own full throttle

[16:39] In fact, from what we've been seeing on the message boards and whatnot, I don't think there's been nearly over a hundred full throttles that have gone out in the two and a half years

[16:53] That they apparently have been in production or the year they've been in production, not a hundred games

[16:59] So there's not a lot of people affected, so I chalk this up if I'm an Andrew in company, I don't think they see this as a big deal because they know the volume of full throttle owners is not that large and for them to satiate those people, it's not going to come at a significant cost to them

[17:13] Nor will there be a significant amount of uproar because the sheer number of people that are affected are very low

[17:19] But I did love watching Rob T and Iceman, sorry not Iceman, Rob T and Iceman go back and forth because Rob T said it

[17:29] He questioned this whole thing about how the computer swapping is a big deal and it shouldn't be brushed under the carpet

[17:39] And then what happens? Why snow comes in and basically pulls his same old shit because he owns a full throttle he's the only one who's able to have an opinion about the game

[17:49] So I own a highway product only I can control the conversation only I can have the opinion about this company that matters and I will hyper post and drive my point home

[18:01] And basically bully everyone else out of this thread because if they don't own a full throttle their opinions don't matter

[18:09] I mean that is the approach why snow is taken here and Rob T wrote, get the fuck out with this crap, I'm tired of people like you who think you can only have an opinion if you have bought the product in question

[18:20] It's complete BS and you should be ashamed for throwing crap like this around

[18:25] I bet if I made a post saying something to the effect of this is no big deal it's part of growing pains of a new company and I'm sure that highway won't charge too much for the upgrade

[18:35] You would not have replied to my post asking me if I have a full throttle owner would you?

[18:40] Hypocrite

[18:41] So then why snow row back to him? You are entitled to your opinion and I don't mean to insinuate differently

[18:46] I will say that this is one of those times where your opinion holds very little value if you are not a full throttle owner and hence not impacted at all

[18:57] So it's the same cycle people he is the alien apologist he is the man who will convince everybody that they should send money in now before productions begun

[19:09] and they should without asking any questions about a company's state of finances, state of production, just give them your money

[19:21] and this is why people got burned in predator and here we are all over again and look I am not saying that highway and Kevin are the same

[19:29] They are not, they are nowhere near in the same ballpark

[19:33] Andrew has an official license he works with Roger Sharp

[19:36] There is no reason to be concerned about license, there is no reason to be concerned whether or not these guys can screw a game together

[19:43] But I think there is reason to be concerned about timing and about when production will really begin and when you should send them your money

[19:52] Because I do think you have to in the back of your mind ask yourself just a simple question

[20:00] What is the financial situation to get alien built?

[20:06] And I don't think it's an unfair question, that's not a question trying to sabotage the company

[20:11] Now look that question does lead to speculation and I think speculation can be damaging so we are not going to do that

[20:16] We are not going to speculate about where those things are but what we can do is hold people to their word

[20:22] And when I spoke to Andrew at Expo I said to him flat out I said man your biggest mistake is you are constantly putting dates and people's heads

[20:31] And you are constantly saying things like 2 to 3 weeks, 2 to 3 weeks we are going to see this 2 to 3 weeks

[20:35] It's always 2 to 3 weeks with the man and I said to him look I think you guys should put your heads down finish the game finish with the Ellie packages

[20:44] And don't say anything until you are like it's done, give us your money to get your game on the line, it's done

[20:51] Until then I think all this communication about working with the community to figure out the Ellie trim, going back and forth on what's available in the Ellie

[21:00] I just think it's all a big mistake and if we look at Andrew's own words over the last like 6 months

[21:07] So 6 months ago he said and this is word for word, development is definitely at an advanced stage and we believe we are absolutely still on course for summer 2016 production

[21:19] 2 months ago he said we still intend to start manufacturing games in September this year with the first game shipping out by the end of October

[21:28] We want as many of our customers as possible to be playing their games by Christmas 2016

[21:34] 3 weeks ago he sent out an email asking for additional payments from people because production has started and just yesterday Andrew put up a new post and I want to read it because I think it's interesting what is in here

[21:48] He says hi everyone apologies for the radio silence but we are just getting back to normal after expo

[21:55] We have taken on board any criticisms over the expo period and reveal and we are working on a few key changes that can be implemented without delaying our production process

[22:06] And then he writes and this is the paragraph that just really is interesting to me yes the production process has begun many parts have been ordered and some have already begun arriving

[22:17] Production of the first games will be relatively slow but the process will speed up dramatically as we get closer to Christmas

[22:24] So I want to stop there because I want to just ask out loud right I'm thinking out loud in this podcast what does production mean to you

[22:34] And what is the production process mean and I think the word process after the word production makes things very vague

[22:43] So does production to you mean when we've gone into production on a car like I'm going to use a car you meant sorry levy people like cars more than pinball machines

[22:52] When we say production has begun on the Chevy Z01 it has right the new camera that means that production has started because people are building them they're on the assembly lines all the parts have been ordered

[23:06] Everything is ready to go and cars are being built immediately production has begun the production process could mean anything

[23:17] Right the production process can just mean we've started to order parts but as everyone knows when you begin to order parts that is not the time I think you should be asking people for more money because as we've seen in pinball and as is true in the auto world

[23:34] There is a high chance that there will be some parts and a new product that are delayed and when those parts are delayed sometimes you can't make anything

[23:45] Another good example is the Chevy's automatic 10 speed transmission which is amazing is delayed so because of that we will not take orders from anyone on the automatic Z01s right now

[24:01] Because it is indefinite when those parts will be available and so when we look at this whole terminology about production process and when production begins is when you have to give more money to the company I just don't believe that people should be hit up three weeks ago asking them for the remainder of their payments because production has begun

[24:25] The production process has begun and it is not the same thing and I really hope people understand that and hold back on their money because what is the end you're going to do if you just say I'm not paying more right now is he going to lose your refundable deposit that's not going to happen that'll create a PR nightmare for the guy you've paid him 1500 bucks he promised your product that is not a year delayed right a year delayed it didn't come out in August it didn't come out in September didn't come out in October it's not going to come out by Christmas

[24:54] it's not I because I want to let's go on to read and if we read what was being said I think that's pretty clear so he goes on to say production of certain elements are happening now the cabinets are virtually unchanged from full throttle except for the EL blade panel recesses and hence these can be built up first many sub assemblies will also be built in the coming weeks

[25:18] this is how we can say that the production has officially started all right I'll start I'll start I'll stop stop there again building the cabinets

[25:28] okay who else built a bunch of cabinets and convinced us all that the games were being produced I'm not even going to answer that you know the answer to that question I'm not saying this is the case but again we've seen it before

[25:45] cabinets get built first they get lined up and we all like like like thirsty monkeys run to them and just say and we throw our money inside and we say take it I believe you all right he goes on to say the more parts that are made now the easier and quicker it will be it'll be to finish the games and get them shipped out to customers like and that that's a little bit of a no shit like you need parts to make the game

[26:13] and you should be stockpiling parts but again I don't think that customers should be paying for you to stock up those parts I think customers should be paying for when their game is ready to go on the line and there's those can be those can be years apart people

[26:30] it was years apart between jack stockpiling hop at parts and hobbits going on the line and you can lock your money in for years and like the choice is yours again I just I should have said at the very beginning of this podcast

[26:42] this is me making an observation of what's going on with highways alien and what's going on with with a certain individual who I believe is overly shilling the product all right this is my opinion I am not sabotaging their efforts this is all up to you you all can make your own educated decisions but I think nobody is asking these questions and nobody's able to point these things out on pen side because you will get annihilated you'll get annihilated by the fanboys and by the moderation

[27:11] over there and so they can't touch this right see I can read the hypocrisy and Hilton's words and show how he's doing the same thing all over again and he can't call me names he can't do anything I don't even think he has modern technology that allows him to listen to a podcast and it's not a personal attack against him it this is right it's not personal this is what he's saying about pinball his pinball opinions are what are under attack by me not the individual okay

[27:40] all right let's go on because I want to get through what Andrew said here part of this challenge is ramping up the production process over the coming weeks to meet our target of producing 100 games a month by the end of this year

[27:54] okay so it is almost November so when I read that I'm like when Andrew says weeks and then producing 100 games by the end of the year does he didn't realize how many weeks are left in the year right it just from what I took away from expo is the US team hadn't even physically had the game yet and they were going to spend some time on the game getting it right

[28:23] and again I say this because when I hear him say these things I just think he again it's going against what I recommended they do which is just finish the game shut up and don't put these things in people's heads because right now I'm reading oh they're going to be producing 100 games by the end of the year

[28:38] and I will bet you right now and this is not like a malicious bed I will bet you right now that a hundred alien pinball machines will not ship out by the end of the year

[28:51] they just won't and it's not and it's just because they're still working on it and that's fine that's the thing it's fine in fact I will up the ante here if if Andrew and team can ship 100 games by the end of the year I will give whoever gets game number 100 I will give you 1000 dollars that's it I will just give it to you

[29:19] you have serial number 100 100 went out I will give you a thousand dollars and that's not me betting against highway that's me just making a that's me making a bold disruptive statement to try and get these people to stop saying these things because I think these things put false expectations in people's heads and they all they do is damage the credibility of the company they get people's hopes up and I see a statement like that oh 100 games are going to be made by the end of the year

[29:48] I should give them my money right all these things have an ancillary agenda which is to get you to feel confident to give you to give them your money and this needs to stop and I will be the one who calls out every company that tries to do this from now on because it needs to stop people need to stop locking in their money because of these kinds of words and I think they're damaging I was pissed off when American pinball machine was a big deal

[30:17] when American pinball showed the J-pop cabinets and they said the same thing by the end of the year and now it's radio silence from those guys I keep asking them like what's going on they don't want to say anything what's going on nobody wants to say anything you know is someone suing like J-pop no one wants to say anything for fuck's sakes this needs to stop this this whole like promising of timelines and games by certain dates just stop stop and stop doing it in a way that makes people spend money to get to get you know

[30:47] to get the thing that they've been dreaming about and you're fucking with people's dreams with these kinds of statements anyway alright so then he goes on the same we have hired the necessary people with the knowledge and experience to make this happen

[30:59] right so hundred games a month requires new people to be hired by highway pinball all right so it's good they're ramping up right now does does anyone say devil's advocate like well let's new employees new salaries new cost to them

[31:16] where's the money coming in no one want you can't say that can't say it okay I'll keep going we are significantly strengthening all areas of our company to meet the needs over the coming months

[31:27] this includes extra personnel in all areas of the company we know that there have been some delays in replying to customers over the last few weeks and for us this is unacceptable we will endeavor to deal with existing customers and new

[31:41] inquiries in a much faster manner in coming weeks and days you know okay so I mean look I feel like Andrew writes these things as things are popping in his head and I I mean I want them to get games out

[31:57] and I don't want this to seem like some nasty podcast because it's not right I don't think my tone is is is nasty and I'm not trying to say things but but I just I try to put the pieces together

[32:08] people I try in my head to ask myself why is this happening if they're saying this what should I believe about this we're all grown men and I was just raised I was raised by my parents I was raised by my teachers I was raised by the mentors in my life

[32:22] to always think critically about what you're told and as humans as adults in this great country how much better would we all be if we thought this way about everything in our lives our relationships our jobs our our politicians what people tell us

[32:37] you just can't accept that it face value so when Andrew says like there's no one's getting back to emails I also I'm just like confused because Andrew has a customer service manager he has someone over there her name is Amy and her job is solely to respond the customer emails

[32:56] so when there are delays to getting back to people why why is that they have someone on staff whose job is to do that and every day when that person walks in how many emails do you really think highway pinball gets on a daily basis where it would take Amy days to get back to people

[33:19] right and that's the part that makes me frustrated and in my own personal experiences when I had my deposit down on an alien pinball and I went to get a refund it wasn't like bang bang communication with them and it took longer than 30 days to get my money back and I ended up losing like $250 on the whole transaction fee

[33:40] right so that's just a thing it's like Andrew you already have the person in place and now you're saying that we're going to do better I don't know and all these new people being hired to ramp up production is great but I just I don't even want to know all that because again all these are just words meant to make people feel confident to give money and if people can't see that then I just don't know why I even bother I just want you guys to just see the world

[34:10] the way I think I'm seeing it and I don't think I'm being unfair here that they've been in business for four and a half years and they're bringing on new salary employees look and if you said like demand for alien is great and we're going to make sure we have the necessary staff to make all the games and and we're not going to say anything until production begins I just think that should be the line of the company right

[34:30] all right then he goes on to say many people have commented on the CPU in the need to upgrade it for existing full throttle owners we choose the current full throttle CPU or we chose sorry 2.5 years ago it was a great CPU back then but 2.5 years is an eternity in the PC world as a company we want to constantly evolve our product and make it as new and relevant as possible

[34:55] we try to cover all bases in our original design concept but inevitably some aspects of the system may need to be upgraded in the future we could we could have kept the same CPU for alien but you the customers would suffer from not having the ultimate experience that we the creators can deliver to you now so when choosing the new CPU we have tried to make sure that it won't need changing over the next two to three years

[35:21] for the existing customers we will do our very best to look after them it won't mean free CPU upgrades but it should mean substantial discounts for full throttle customers when the time is right we will announce such pricing and incentives I will try to stay as active here as possible and answer questions that you may have and to give you regular updates over the coming weeks all right

[35:41] and then the next response on pinside was from Ryan STL Ryan St. Louis thanks for the update this is what way to this is the way to do business communication is key

[35:54] look I just I think that we're at a point now where the only thing else I want to say about this whole thing is I want them to ship the game

[36:05] and I want them to finish alien I want the US team to do what it needs to do to tweak the game I want them to work on it and not talk to us every week about this and about that and about this and about that

[36:20] all right because I think those are just stall tactics because as they're talking about this and that like the dates are being missed and the new date now is that by the end of the year 100 aliens will be made I mean it's in there it's in there nobody believes that to be the case nobody

[36:39] and I just have a real issue with this approach of using words to instill confidence instill a timeline in people's heads with the agenda of taking your money

[36:54] and I am I am just one podcaster I can't take down a company I can't make you do anything other than what you will want to do we're all fools we're all hypocrites and we're will all blindly follow a project into the fire if it's a theme we love enough I'm I'm the same way if someone made an in a keyra pinball machine or a G1 transformers pinball machine

[37:23] I would be in it in immediately or toy story I would pay for in full cluck there's a mission immediately and and that's the state of our hobby and I think it's also creating something that I've noticed recently and then I'm going to end the podcast on this but all of this stuff all of this like let's build the Ellie together let's let's say all these things that aren't going to come true let's miss another date let's make false promises it's just creating for me

[37:53] and I think so for many of you I think people are just getting a little bit depressed coming out of expo because I think we all expected magic to happen and when I say that like I think we expected to be blown away by pins we were going to play I think we were we were going to finally see magic girl we were going to we were going to turn a corner and this hobby was going to grow up a little bit and this hobby was going to release games

[38:21] and and and really show us that 2016 was going to be the culmination of this resurgence in pinball and I think everything but that has happened I think we're still back in the 2011 2012 period where we're still getting a bunch of promises a bunch of words not many games are in boxes the reality is the only one is going to benefit during this error

[38:49] will be stern because stern will get their games out there people have hit me up trying to acquire my Batman Ellie from me which leads me to even believe even though I was crazy as I think this is that people will pay more than $10,000 to get a Batman Ellie because they know the game will ship and they know it's real and they know they're not going to wait six months for it

[39:13] but I just you know I just really really really think that pinside has become this more depressing environment than anywhere else because only on pinside do you have people like wise snow leading the conversation bullying anyone out of the room who wants to think critically about it who wants to ask tough questions and I don't like people like that because I don't think he's that smart

[39:41] and I think it is dangerous when we start to allow people who blindly lead and blindly bully people around who I don't think they're they're they really want to even ask the critical questions I don't even think he he knows what questions to ask and I don't even think he cares to hear the answers

[39:59] and he he is welcome on this show to defend his position and I have asked Hilton multiple times to come on the show and defend some of his stances on these things and he constantly says he doesn't he doesn't really want to talk much about it

[40:13] bullshit the guy is on there all day long talking about it he doesn't want to talk to me about it in real time as we record because he can't hide the way he does on pinside and he even at expo I try talking to the dude you know what he did he just like walked away like in the middle of our conversation

[40:30] like so weird so socially awkward and it's not like I just think he should stop I think Andrew should stop with this all like updates in the next coming weeks just finish alien and everyone is happy I'm happy you got the product out the people who gave you money are happy because they got their games your employees are happy Andrew because there's money to pay all of them and everything's good or it's happy he gets pinball me happy

[41:00] and the scenario in which alienships makes everyone happy I just think this period of saying stuff and setting false expectations needs to stop and that's it that's it and we will go after the next company on my list that's doing this right now American pinball I'm trying to get these guys to respond and let me know what is going on over there you can't come out the way you did and create such hope for people and make all these bold promises and now just go radio silent

[41:30] be honest be transparent this this they I am more mad at them than anybody else right now for just the lack of communication and the fact that they're hiding now after what they did and they're gonna they're gonna get it right so that's it everyone

[41:46] choose to do what you will do with your money choose wisely do what you want though you're all adults you're all grown men don't blame me if things go wrong with companies I have no I have no ability to hurt anybody this every company is in control of its own destiny

[42:07] and I hope everyone gets their alien but I just hope all this bullshit communication stops and and and we can we can we can see a game the best way it's meant to be seen and that's not seen at all because it's inside a cardboard fucking box have a great day
