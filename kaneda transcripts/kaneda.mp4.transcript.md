[00:00] Good morning everybody! How you doing? Oh, this is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.

[00:07] You know, it's rare that I get to do stuff like this because this stuff

[00:11] doesn't happen to Canadian all the time. We're gonna do this right now. Hold on.

[00:15] I'm trying to get a power cord.

[00:20] Here we go. There we go. Okay. Alright. Are we ready for this?

[00:30] Ooh! Ooh! Okay. That was loud. Alright, so here's what we're gonna do. Here's what we're gonna do.

[00:38] Here's what we're gonna do. Okay. How am I looking? How am I looking? Am I looking good?

[00:43] Am I looking good? It's my birthday Monday. My birthday.

[00:51] So let's just do a roll call here. I've been doing pinball content for 10 years, people. 10 years.

[01:03] I've been doing pinball content. I've been given the trippy for six years in a row for favorite

[01:15] pinball podcast. There is a pinball media mixer at Expo this year, which I was thinking of attending.

[01:28] I'll tell you why I was thinking of attending this. My really good friend Angela, she was one of my

[01:38] best friends, my boss, she passed away at 35. I'm gonna be in LA at her parents' house the weekend before.

[01:47] At 35 years of age, she stood up and she had a brain hemorrhage and fell over in a meeting in Buenos Aires and died.

[02:03] It's gonna be a really tough time and all I want to do is go to Pinball Expo,

[02:13] hang out with my friends, hang out with my fans, and I've been told, I've been told

[02:22] that I'm not allowed to go to the pinball media mixer. Okay.

[02:33] There is a gathering of pinball media people,

[02:37] and I've been told that my presence is not welcome there.

[02:47] Nobody's made more pinball media than me. So what we're gonna do right now,

[02:52] he doesn't know this, is I'm gonna call the person who has banned me from the pinball

[03:01] media mixer and we're going to ask who in the pinball media landscape, it doesn't want

[03:10] Canada to be there. This is what Canada does. We keep everybody honest. Let's do it right now.

[03:21] All right. Let's do this. Ready?

[03:41] He's not picking up. Hold on. We meant to

[03:59] Hello, you've reclaimed calling.

[04:04] Not picking up. Hold on.

[04:08] Let's call back.

[04:10] No, no, no, I said I'd call him five.

[04:31] Interesting.

[04:35] Oh, calling. You're not doing it this way. Okay. Now he's not doing it this way.

[04:40] He's here. He's on this live.

[04:55] He's in the chat. It's amazing to me. It's amazing to me. Colin, Colin, you're not going to do it

[05:03] this way. You're gonna email me after 847 episodes and you're gonna tell me I'm not welcome.

[05:15] I'm being a bully. I'm being a bully. This is, see, this is it. This is what it all boils down to.

[05:25] Unbelievable. You know what? You know what, Colin? I know you're here and everybody can hear this.

[05:39] You think this is being a bully that you can't honestly tell everybody who's

[05:49] who's afraid of Canada showing up to a pinball media mixer.

[06:04] You know, Colin, here's what I'm going to do. Here's what I'm going to do. Here's what I'm going to do.

[06:10] I'm just going to show up. How about that? You don't know in the restaurant. You don't know in the hotel.

[06:21] This is ridiculous. This is, yeah, I put you on the spot, brother, because you email me.

[06:28] You email, you know what an insult it is to email Canada and tell Canada

[06:34] that you're not invited to a pinball media mixer. You're not invited to a pinball media mixer, bro.

[06:45] You thought I was just gonna like, I don't even know you, bro. And you're gonna uninvite me to a

[06:54] pinball media mixer. The seventh time, it's going to be seven favorite pinball podcasts.

[07:07] And you don't even have the courage to pick up the phone and tell all these people who are

[07:14] going to watch this, there's going to be more people that watch this than go to your media mixer.

[07:21] And you didn't show me any respect. You didn't call me up. You didn't call me. You sent me an email

[07:30] that said, because other people

[07:41] would not want your presence there.

[07:43] Yeah, what am I banned for? What am I banned for?

[07:59] Come on, he's here. He's here.

[08:04] We don't have that kind of relationship. Colin, just pick up the phone, bro. He's in the chat.

[08:10] Colin, why don't you just pick up the phone? This is ridiculous. You're here. You can't pick up the

[08:20] phone and tell me and tell my fans why I'm banned from a pinball media mixer. Just join the show, Colin.

[08:34] Do you understand? That doesn't make any sense to me. You can't pick up the phone.

[08:38] Will you pick up the phone, Colin? More people are going to watch this than go to your media mixer.

[08:51] Oh, Albert, just get over it, Albert. Albert, get over it. This is ridiculous.

[08:59] No, I just, this is how Canada does it, Colin. You want to just, you want to put me in a box.

[09:12] You want to shove me in a corner. Oh, this is not cool. This is not cool.

[09:22] You're banning the favorite pinball podcaster from a media mixer.

[09:30] How do you do it, bro? Tell us how you do it. So Colin, I'm glad I got you here,

[09:37] bro, because now you're on it. This is it. This is real. This is not, you can't hide behind

[09:43] social media or an email, Colin. Why am I banned from your media mixer?

[09:51] So Colin, tell us, like, why am I banned from going to a pinball media mixer?

[09:59] Everybody is watching. Everyone's going to see this.

[10:10] I've done 847 podcasts about pinball. I've been doing content for 10 years.

[10:18] Why am I banned from a pinball media mixer, Colin? Just say it. You're in the chat right now.

[10:30] You picked fights with too many people? Who? Colin, stop dancing around it.

[10:38] Who did I pick fights with that bans me from a pinball media mixer?

[10:46] Just tell me. Stop. Name names. Is it Don? Who is it? Come on.

[10:52] So I'm not allowed to go to a pinball media mixer when I've done this much pinball media.

[11:05] Just man up. You don't want to do it like this? Oh, this makes you uncomfortable?

[11:12] Not going into it. Act like an adult? Oh, I'm not acting like an adult.

[11:18] You'll have a one on one. So if I call you right now, if I call you right now, you're going to pick up?

[11:35] Colin, you haven't done pinball media for 10 years like I have. You haven't won any award like I have.

[11:43] So you're going to kick me out of a pinball media event?

[11:48] Why not? Why are you afraid to talk live? Why? But why? Why are you afraid to talk live about your decisions?

[12:01] I don't understand it, but I understand this. But I'll say anything to you in front of everybody.

[12:07] Why can't you say what you want to say to me in front of everybody?

[12:13] Why do you get the power to ban me from a pinball media event when I've made more pinball media than anybody?

[12:33] You know, Colin, this is real life. This is real life. I know you're a new dad.

[12:42] Congratulations. I know it's exhausting. I went through it myself.

[12:50] But this is like weird to me. You want to tell Canada you can't come to a pinball media mixer

[12:59] because I picked too many fights. And then I ask you, well, who doesn't want me to go

[13:08] to a pinball media mixer?

[13:14] And you won't say who. I don't get it. Am I being the bully? Am I being the bully? Hold on a second.

[13:38] Let me know. Colin, I'm giving you a forum here. I'm giving you a forum to just come clean.

[13:58] Let me just say something real quickly. Let me say something real quickly.

[14:07] Before I say it, I was going to go grab my trippies, but let me just say this, Colin, because I don't know you.

[14:15] You don't know me. You sent me an email saying I'm humbled. I'm a subscriber to your show.

[14:29] You're doing a gathering of pinball media. I just want to set the record straight because Colin

[14:35] doesn't understand this. I've dedicated 10 years of my life, 10 years of my freaking life, Colin,

[14:42] more than you've ever dedicated to pinball media with the Connecticut. 10 years of my life making

[14:49] pinball content, 10 years, bro, a decade. Do you understand the insulted is to tell

[15:00] the pinball podcaster that has won six years in a row for favorite pinball podcast by the freaking

[15:08] people. I didn't make my own award show and give myself an award like somebody else.

[15:17] For 10 years of my life, I've spent hours away from friends and family to make pinball content.

[15:26] Do you understand the insult it is? If you're going to do a pinball media mixer,

[15:37] celebrating those who make pinball content at pinball expo, and then you're going to ban me

[15:47] from attending said gathering, and then you want me to, and then you won't answer the phone when I

[15:58] call you about why I'm not allowed to go. You're not going to do it like this.

[16:05] Well, let me tell you something, bro. You don't do it like this because you don't do it at all.

[16:11] 10 freaking years, bro. 10 years. 10 freaking years of my life, I've made pinball content,

[16:24] and you're going to throw a gathering of pinball content creators and not invite me.

[16:32] Not only that, you're going to ban me after I said I'd be willing to come after I go,

[16:41] I go do a celebration of my best friend's death. I'm going to LA to celebrate the life of a friend

[16:51] of mine who died. And all I want to do the following few days is recover from that by going to hang out

[17:02] with my pinball friends, and you tell me you're not allowed to come. You at a public restaurant

[17:13] in a public hotel, and then you're going to cry like a coward and say, I'm bullying you

[17:20] that you're not going to do it like this, Colin. This is real life, bro. This is real life.

[17:28] This is real life. You don't get it. What? Because I upset Don? Oh, I'm sorry. I've apologized to Don.

[17:41] He doesn't accept it. He's just drafting off of the drama. He's putting up hateful,

[17:48] bullying podcasts about me. I haven't even mentioned him.

[17:53] So you want to talk about being an adult? You want to talk about getting over it? No, you don't.

[18:05] Pick up the phone and tell everybody right now why I can't come to a pinball media mixer. Okay?

[18:15] Will you do it? You're here now. We know you're here.

[18:29] This is it. Look, look, look, look. I get it. I sprung this on you out of the blue.

[18:38] I hit you in the present. I didn't want you to hide behind phone calls.

[18:46] It's...

[18:51] Oh, because I'm not invited to the event. Okay. Colin, let me tell you something.

[18:57] Let me tell you something. Do they not invite Axe Rose to the pinball hall of fame because he's a

[19:03] jerk? Does Howard Stern not win awards because he's a shock jog? Colin, this is real right now.

[19:13] Right now what's happening is real. It's live. The ball's in your accord, brother.

[19:22] Look, I'm not asking you to invite me to the event, Colin. What I'm asking you to do,

[19:28] man to man right now, in front of people, I get it. I'm just asking you to pick up the phone.

[19:33] Like, just tell everybody here why I'm not invited to the event. Why can't you do that?

[19:44] Okay. That's it. That's all I'm asking you to do.

[19:50] And you can pick up the phone and look, I get it. I get it. I get why I'm banned from the event.

[19:59] I get it. I'm not Colin. I'm not trying to be a jerk here. But what I want you to do is pick up

[20:07] the phone and just explain to everybody why I'm banned from the event and who doesn't want me there.

[20:16] Why do we live in a world where you can't do that? Colin, can you do that? Can you just pick up the

[20:21] phone and just explain? I know why I'm banned from the event. It's not going to happen.

[20:29] Really. You can't pick up the phone. You can't pick up the phone and just tell me what you're

[20:38] saying in chat. This is what's wrong with everything now in the world. Like, just pick up the phone.

[20:47] Like, don't hide behind Facebook lives. Okay. Why can't you just... Dude, dude, don't worry. I'm not

[20:59] going to mess up your media mixer. Like, just pick up the phone. I don't understand. So, like, Colin,

[21:09] you won't pick up the phone and talk to me in front of people. Imagine we're at your media

[21:16] mixer. There's more people watching this right now, Colin, that will go to your media mixer.

[21:22] So, just... You can't talk? Oh, we're not boys now.

[21:33] Come on, Colin, seriously. Explain to everybody here right now why you can't pick up the phone

[21:39] and talk to me. It's a novel concept, actually talking.

[21:56] I just don't understand, Colin. You know, it's like...

[22:02] You had a chance, man. You had a chance to man up and just talk to me. It's not... I'll talk to anybody.

[22:12] I'll talk to anybody.

[22:18] Look, I'm just going to say this right now.

[22:21] I'm dedicated more than I should. I'm dedicated more than I should to this hobby,

[22:38] to you, to the listeners, to the audiences.

[22:41] This...

[22:48] Oh, this isn't working for you, Colin. This guy, this isn't working for me.

[22:55] Colin, Colin, what are you even talking about, bro? You can't talk to a grown adult and call them up.

[23:03] Like, look, look, bro, this is Canada right now. All right? You want to... Go, go leave. Go, cool.

[23:14] You really think when people watch this, Colin, they're going to be like...

[23:21] I don't even care.

[23:24] I want to talk to the guy. Who's being a bully? Monica.

[23:29] Don's wife is calling me a bully right now. Come on, Monica. Look, Monica, I'm glad you're here too. Monica,

[23:40] why don't you tell people, Monica, how I called up your husband. And you know what your husband said to

[23:48] me, Monica? Let's just get it all out right now. Let's just get it all out right now. Monica, do you

[23:54] know that what Don said to me, he said, I don't want to be part of this pinball drama.

[24:03] Okay? Monica, did Don tell you that I apologized for everything I said?

[24:12] You know what, you know what Don did after he said he didn't want to be a part of the pinball drama?

[24:17] You know what he did? He went and he did a Jengiz YouTube video slamming me. He then went and

[24:28] shared private text messages when he didn't want to be part of the pinball drama. He's now making fun

[24:35] of me left and right, calling me a woman. Monica, your husband has called me a woman's tampon.

[24:40] And you're going to come here and tell me I'm a bully? Your husband just called me a tampon.

[24:51] And I forgive him because I like Don's enthusiasm and I don't engage with it because I don't think

[24:57] Don's a bad guy. And I think he's using the drama to create more of an audience after he said he

[25:06] didn't want to use the drama. And that's it. No one wants you around. Monica, nobody wants me around.

[25:23] Nobody. Monica, you just said nobody wants me around. Okay. Okay. So here's what I'm going to do.

[25:33] Monica, Monica, Monica, I am going to fulfill your wish. Nobody wants me around. Okay. Nobody.

[25:49] Okay. Yeah. Everybody's leaving Canada and joining Don's pinball podcast. I get it. Monica,

[25:55] 610 subscribers versus 27. Okay. Monica, here's what I'm going to do. Monica,

[26:05] you said nobody wants me around.

[26:15] What I'm going to do, thanks to you, I'm going to leave. Nobody wants me around. Monica,

[26:24] your husband, Don, he can have, he can have all the Facebook live. I'm going to go away.

[26:32] I'm not doing any more Facebook lives. Don can have my 10 o'clock slot for the next month. I'm not

[26:41] going to do any more Facebook lives. I'm not going to do anything. You, you said nobody wants me around

[26:49] so you can have your wish and the world can have Don's Saturday morning spectacular. The world can

[26:59] have your husband's content and only my subscribers will get me. No, she's getting her wish for one

[27:10] month. We're going to do a one month experiment. We're going to, we're going to leave for one month

[27:16] and let Monica Garrison

[27:21] have her way. Monica, thank you. You freed me up. Now these people, when you say nobody wants me

[27:28] around, these people might be mad at you, but you did this. You asked for this. So I'm not doing a

[27:35] Saturday morning spectacular this Saturday. I'm not doing any of them for one month. I'll be back

[27:42] a month from now. I'm not going to expo. I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to just take care of my

[27:51] family and you get Don's Facebook live for a month. I think that's fair. Nobody wants me around. So

[28:01] I'm leaving. No, look guys, guys, it's not silly. You get, you get to watch Don for a month. I'm not,

[28:16] this is it. I'm going to leave this up. This is going to be the last Facebook thing I do for a month.

[28:25] That's it.

[28:31] Enjoy. Enjoy life without Canada. The man nobody wants to be around.

[28:40] It's cute. It's cute. Look, everybody,

[28:47] you want real life, Colin, you want real life, Monica, you want, you want it? Well, now you gotta

[28:56] watch Don. It's past year. It's been the toughest year of our lives. Okay. All these pinball content

[29:18] creators acting like babies and children and this and that and you know, all of the drama. I get it.

[29:27] I get it. Like we're all just grown adults. This is cringe.

[29:38] Well, Victor, don't watch.

[29:41] Is it I'm done for a month. I'm just going to say this right now. I lost a baby this year.

[29:56] And you've been wondering what's been eating away at me and these pinball drama queens.

[30:02] It's amazing to me. It's amazing to me between this and Colin and Don and Zach, many threatening me

[30:16] with legal like it's just it doesn't end. It doesn't end. And like through it all through it all.

[30:28] I've never told anybody to not buy pinball from flipping out. Like I don't get it. Like I literally

[30:38] people come at me in these ways where it's like, Oh my gosh, really? This is where we're at.

[30:48] So here's the deal. I'm going away for a month. Monica, thank you. You've liberated me. I'm giving

[30:54] your husband a one month window to take over the Saturday morning slot, a one month window

[31:05] to impress everybody. And I enjoy your husband's content. And you're here right now calling me

[31:15] a bully saying why people hate me. I have apologized to your husband. Did he accept it? No.

[31:22] He went on and he did more negative things. So what can I you know, that's it. That's it.

[31:30] And Don and I were cool and you jumped in and you got real serious and you spoiled it. And then I

[31:38] reacted and I get it. Yeah, have I been threatened legally? Yes. Do you want me do I share that stuff?

[31:51] No. Is he calling people telling me what? Yeah, he's calling my listeners and he won't, he won't

[31:59] pick up the phone. I don't even care anymore. I don't even care. Look, this is the thing is

[32:04] is Canada is real. It's Canada is as real as this table. I lost the baby. That's as real as it

[32:12] gets people. This is real as it gets Albert. I go to gym every day. I take care of myself. I'm 47

[32:19] years old on Monday. It's as real as it gets. And I've got ladies with pink hair who are out of

[32:26] shaming me. It's as real as it gets. This is as real as it gets. And you want to do a pinball

[32:37] media mixer. Hold on one second.

[32:56] You want to do a pinball media mixer, Monica? Do you know what these are? Do you know what this is?

[33:05] You want to do a pinball media mixer. Okay, you want to do a basketball, like gathering and not

[33:12] invite Michael Jordan. You want to do a pinball media mixer and not invite. I don't even the

[33:22] six one is like at my office like your husband's not going to have one of these Monica. I hate to

[33:30] break it to you. And the reason you get one of these is because you tell it like it is.

[33:39] You don't mess up your Elvira with crappy decals. And that's it.

[33:46] You don't you don't interview Andrew McBain and give puny factory the time of day.

[33:57] Look, you can thank Monica Garrison for your one month off of Canada. She did it. She did it.

[34:05] Monica, you win. You get the time slot for a month. It's my birthday Monday. I don't care.

[34:13] I don't care. Just know this. Just know this. The one month I take off from Facebook live,

[34:21] the one month I take off. What it's going to do is not remind everybody why I'm

[34:29] canceled by you. It's not going to remind everybody how great your husband's content is.

[34:35] It's not going to like empower the people that like hate me. What the one month off is going to do

[34:44] is it's simply going to remind everybody why can I just pinball podcast and why can I just

[34:50] is a necessary voice in this hobby. That's it. And Colin's going to hate me. I'm sorry, Colin.

[35:00] I'm sorry, Colin. I wanted you to pick up the phone in real time and you're not going to do it like

[35:05] this and it's not cool. Yeah, I'm not cool. I'm Canada and I don't care. I don't care if you want

[35:14] and also uses Chris. Albert, Albert, Albert, I gave up Albert seriously, bro. Seriously.

[35:25] You don't get it, Albert. Somebody take a screen grab of this. This looks cool. Albert, you don't

[35:33] get it. You don't get it. You still don't get it. You don't get it. You know, you think after this,

[35:45] not only would I be invited to every pinball media mixer, they would pay for my damn flights and hotel.

[35:52] That's the truth, people. Albert, I love you. You know, I love you, brother. Albert, I thought nobody

[36:02] wanted me around. You know, it's funny to me. It's funny to me that somebody with 27 subscribers

[36:10] is telling me that nobody wants me around. I've got 610. Maybe I'm drawing this out right now

[36:17] because this is the last Facebook live I'm doing for a month. Guys, I'll see you in 30 days.

[36:28] This is good. This frees me up. Monica, thank you. You've just freed up four of my Saturdays. Now,

[36:35] tell Don to go do his Saturday morning spectacular. He started to take over my time slot.

[36:43] This is beautiful. Thank you. You've liberated me.

[36:50] I'm just going to sit here. Nobody wants me around. Nobody wants me around. Nobody wants to

[36:58] listen to Canada. He called me up. He did what he said he wasn't going to do. Yeah, and I am who I am

[37:07] and I will never change. Okay?

[37:14] Does Patreon do lives? Don't worry. Don't worry. David, don't worry, man. In 30 days, I'll be back.

[37:20] And my return will be glorious. But Monica, Monica, you saved me. You saved me. Now I can go to the gym more.

[37:31] Come on. Come on. Don't make me. Don't make me show you the six pack. It's there. It's there. Don't

[37:43] make me show you it. Don't make me show you it. People bullying me. 30 days, no shows. You missed a

[37:53] lot, Kelly. It's early in the morning.

[37:57] Canada got up early. Look at these cheap ass troopers. These things cost like five bucks,

[38:04] man. It's funny that Frenchy wants one of these so bad. Look, everyone's going to watch this

[38:11] everywhere. No, man. Kelly, it's cool, man. You got to watch the whole thing. Monica Garrison came in

[38:18] here. Don's wife came in here and said, nobody wants me around. So she's going to get her way

[38:27] because Don's wife said, nobody wants me around. I'm going to take 30 days off.

[38:33] And in that 30 days, I'm going to remove the stickers from the bottom of these cheap ass trophies

[38:39] that everybody wants so badly. And I will be back in 30 days with Twippy's with no cheap

[38:46] ass stickers on the bottom. I didn't even realize these things had these cheap ass stickers.

[38:53] But here's the deal, people. Let's be real. Let's be real. Okay. This year, we lost a baby at

[39:04] five and a half months. Let's be real here. Let's just get real. Let's get real for a minute. All

[39:09] right. Don, Zach, Manny, Christopher, Frenchy, let's get real. Let's get in. Let's get in life right

[39:14] now. We lost a baby at five and a half months in the womb. Okay. Okay. A life that wanted to live in

[39:28] a world of people that don't want Canada at a pinball show. And the tears and the heartache

[39:38] that my family has endured is immeasurable. And then I have an outlet for all this pain.

[39:50] An outlet for the pain Don and Monica and Zach and Greg, Greg Bone, who calls me up and tells me

[39:57] I have no friends. Dude calls me up and tells me I have no friends. The pain I've endured

[40:08] and so I have an outlet. It's pinball. Right. We're here just to have fun, get entertained. And I

[40:14] put on the gesture suit and I entertain everybody every week. And for, I don't know, six years in a

[40:24] row, like people have said, like, Hey, man, we love your stuff. So you get these, right. And for six

[40:31] years, like the fans have voted for me. And this is my outlet. I live in a world, man. I make marketing

[40:36] ideas for clients, man. I have to, I have to ask for permission to execute the only thing in my life

[40:42] that I have power over that I don't have to ask permission for is my stuff is my pinball content.

[40:51] And that's why it means so much to me. It's precious. You know, Colin and everyone who hates on me,

[40:57] like, do not understand, like it means the world to me. So when you flippantly ban me from your

[41:05] shows or you create your own award shows to give yourselves trophies, because you can't beat me fair

[41:12] and square in a normal award show where the fans get to vote, you've got to make up your own award

[41:18] shows. Do you understand what an insult that is to me? And then you don't even like recognize me,

[41:25] you ban me. Yeah, Colin is the kinetist. Do you understand what an insult that is? And then you

[41:33] want me to like be the better man, like I'm just pick up the phone and talk to kinet. You won't do it.

[41:42] So I go away for a month, 30 days is gonna be great. Friend is gonna be happy because 30 days

[41:47] I'm gonna be free of all of this. I'm gonna again go to the gym, work out, take care of myself.

[41:54] But I'm just gonna say this right now. This hobby is filled with a bunch of people that won't pick

[42:01] up the phone. I've tried to call Zach many like 15 times. He won't pick up the phone. He'll text

[42:09] message listeners of mine. What's the deal with Chris? Like I don't know. Dude, dude, just pick up

[42:17] the phone and it all goes away. You want the truth. That's the truth. He knows the truth. I can show

[42:24] you the missed calls where he won't pick up the phone. So if you don't, if you don't want to deal

[42:30] with me, but then want to make up with me, it's simple. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not trying to hurt

[42:40] anybody. If I've done anything to hurt anybody, I try to reconcile. But Colin and Monica,

[42:50] what you're doing is bullying me. I've done the work. I've put in the hours. I've done,

[43:00] I've paved the way for this whole entire freaking pinball media thing that you're just getting into,

[43:07] Don. You don't even know anything about pinball yet. You're like, you think Andrew McBain is like a

[43:13] good guy? He's not. Like seriously, you change the decals on your alibi. Like I get it and I was a

[43:21] fan of yours and then I tried, I tried to reconcile with Don and he tells me, I don't want to be part

[43:28] of pinball drama. That's what he said to me and I walked out that very door. I went to work. Cool.

[43:36] We're cool. And what do I, what do I run into an hour later? Don sharing private text messages.

[43:44] Don sharing this. Don going on Jengus. Don calling me a tampon when the guy says he doesn't want to

[43:51] be part of pinball drama. So enjoy your pinball expo party without me. 30 days. I'm going to get

[44:02] these freaking stickers off the bottom of these trophies, but there's a reason why I have these

[44:08] trophies. And for each and every one of you over the next 30 days, I want you to reflect. Ichigo

[44:15] Ichi, I mean it. Ichigo Ichi, the Japanese way of thinking about life to dwell in the present.

[44:25] What happened in the past is the past. The future nobody knows about. This is it. This is all we have.

[44:34] And look, I'm going to say this right now. To Don, to Zach, to Greg, to Jengus, to Franchi,

[44:44] if you want to get to a place of peace, let's just talk. Let's just figure it out as you would

[44:54] say. My phone is always open. Calling. Call me. Call me. Like, let's just talk about it. They,

[45:04] you know, it's always open because I don't like the drama anymore than they do. And that is the

[45:11] truth. I don't need the drama to build an audience. I have my audience. I've been doing it for a decade.

[45:17] It's not what people listen to me about. You don't want this. People don't want to listen to this.

[45:21] Crap. They want me to gush about games and slam haggis for not delivering on time.

[45:30] So that's it. So enjoy your 30 days, Canada free. Monica, thank you for that. I apologize to Don.

[45:39] I do. I'm sorry, Don, that I made the jokes I made. I should not have made those jokes.

[45:46] And I mean this, Don. Like, I was the culprit. I made Fana Don in like student loans and buying

[45:56] Pimmel machines and his wife jumped into his defense and she was very valid in her defense of

[46:03] her husband. And I was a jerk and I overstepped. And it should have been a thing that just happened

[46:10] between two dudes. And I apologized and I apologized to Don, but he took it and he made it what he

[46:19] said he wasn't going to do. He took the pinball drama and he ran with it. So Monica, if you're

[46:27] listening, I'm sorry. Okay. Zach, many, I don't know why a year has gone by and you're still mad

[46:36] about me about a Facebook live thing where people are posting about your house for sale.

[46:41] I didn't threaten you. I didn't send people to your house. I had a great conversation with your wife

[46:47] and she ended the conversation by saying, we're cool. Just be kind to us. And I was like, great.

[46:54] And then I listened to your show after that conversation and for like 20 minutes, you just

[46:59] slammed me. And so like, if you want to be cool, Zach, just call me. It's not personal. Just

[47:11] just bury the hatchet, bro. Frenchie just hates me. He wants Frenchie wants one of these. He's

[47:16] never going to be cool about it. Like that's there's no there's no winning Frenchie over.

[47:21] Um, Greg bone, I have friends. I do. They exist. I do. We were out tonight.

[47:31] I have more maybe I have more stickers on the bottom bottom of Twippy's than I do have great

[47:36] friends, but it is what it is. So look, everybody, you're going to be rid of Canada for a month.

[47:43] I'm going away and I will still do my podcast for subscribers, but 30 days,

[47:51] Canada free. What is today's date? Um, you will not see an I will, I will do the next Saturday

[48:00] morning spectacular the Saturday of pinball expo, which I will not be going to because I'm not

[48:08] invited. Okay. And in those 30 days, I will remove the stickers from the bottom of this,

[48:14] these Twippy's and I will work on myself. You know, that's what it all comes down to,

[48:22] right? Is these people, they think on this horrible human being and they think that I am a person who

[48:30] is not worthy of forgiveness. They think I'm a person who is not worthy of empathy or compassion.

[48:38] They just want to cancel me. Okay. And that's it. Well, pinball Olympics is later in the day,

[48:47] so it'll be before the pinball Olympics. It doesn't start at 10 in the morning, David. So like you

[48:56] you can watch the Saturday morning spectacular and then go to the pinball Olympics. You know,

[49:02] it's a bad day for everybody else. It's a bad day for the Canadian haters because they got to be like,

[49:06] Oh, oh crap. He did a show at seven in the morning. Now they have to watch all of this. This is the

[49:13] best part about all my haters. They have to follow everything I do. They hold on to everything. They

[49:20] capture all of this. It's in all the legal threats. Take down this show. Take down that show. You

[49:26] know, it's funny is I've got legal threats this year and it's like, we need you to remove this

[49:31] show. And I've asked them, what about the show was wrong? Think about this. You're going to,

[49:37] you're going to threaten Canadian to take down content. I'm like, well, then what, what did I

[49:42] say that you want me to retract and they never respond? It's just weird to me. It's weird. Why

[49:49] punish your royal fans? Well, you can thank Monica for that punishment, but because Monica said,

[49:54] nobody wants me around. Nobody wants me around. So Monica Garrison, the floor is yours. You get it.

[50:04] Don can take over on Saturday mornings. Let them see what you got. Okay, everybody,

[50:15] I'm going to go hang with Kylian and Brenda. I love you guys for the support. I love you for hanging

[50:21] out for my haters out there for the people that want to threaten me. Give me a call. If you have a

[50:27] real issue with me, just call me up. Seriously, I'm not, I'm not that guy that you think I am. I'm

[50:32] not really, really. I mean, I put on my big boy pants. I go to work every day. I work with some of

[50:40] the biggest brands in the world and, you know, I have a real life that pinball is the side gig.

[50:47] And if pinball is your, your universe, that's fine. Be well. Namaste.

[50:55] Albert just sent me a message. I hope you're okay. Yes, I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. Don't

[51:00] worry about me. You don't need to worry about me. I'm absolutely okay. Okay. Okay.

[51:07] Pray for the soul of the child I lost. Okay. That's, that's, that's real life. That's real. Okay.

[51:17] As long as I'm kicking at 47 on Monday, come on, come on. I'm okay. It's fine. You guys are here

[51:27] for entertainment. I will entertain you in 30 days. Be good. Everybody who hates me, the floor is

[51:35] yours. You now get to own Facebook for a month. Namaste. It's you go each baby. It's you go each.
