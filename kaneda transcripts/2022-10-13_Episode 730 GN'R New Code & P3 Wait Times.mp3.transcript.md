[00:00] I keep on running, keep on running and nothing works.

[00:05] I can't get away from you.

[00:09] No!

[00:10] Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera!

[00:14] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:17] It's your host, Canada.

[00:18] I'm back from Las Vegas, still recovering.

[00:21] I feel like each day you spend in Vegas, you need a week after to recover.

[00:24] So three days in Vegas, in three weeks, you'll be back to normal.

[00:28] So what is happening in the pinball world?

[00:30] We all are anxiously awaiting this James Bond stream, the moment of truth.

[00:35] Will this James Bond machine be worth it?

[00:37] Now, Stern has been uploading a bunch of clips on Facebook and we're seeing more and

[00:42] more and more movie footage, which is really good news.

[00:46] And if you are a fan of this franchise, that's what you want to see.

[00:49] You know, I've been thinking a lot lately, what do we really want in a pinball machine?

[00:53] And look, not just at these price, at any price.

[00:56] We want a pinball machine based on a theme we love.

[00:59] We want it to shoot really well.

[01:01] We want it to have rewarding code.

[01:03] We want it to have memorable moments.

[01:05] But we also want to see the theme integrated properly.

[01:09] And looking at all this footage, I think it gives a lot of James Bond fanatics out

[01:13] there a lot of hope that this thing is going to be jam packed with assets.

[01:17] But the real question is this, are we going to see, and you know me, I hang up on this,

[01:21] are we going to see when people talk in the movie, are we going to see their voices

[01:26] synced up with the footage?

[01:28] I think that's super important to make the theme integration really, really work.

[01:32] You know, it's crazy that the Big Lebowski came out like eight years ago.

[01:35] And I still think the Big Lebowski today is one of the greatest theme integrated

[01:40] pinball machines of all time.

[01:42] And it's why I told Barry, and I'll say this to you right now, I told Barry,

[01:46] I'm going to get one, I want one, and don't stop making them until there is one for

[01:51] Tanaida.

[01:52] So you know that there is going to be a Big Lebowski one day in my collection.

[01:57] I just have to respect that game every time I look at these new games.

[02:01] When you think about it, all of the years and all of the money and all of the

[02:04] resources, why isn't every single new pinball machine as theme integrated as

[02:09] well as the Big Lebowski, right?

[02:12] And Big Lebowski was originally $8,500.

[02:15] Now it's $12,500, but even at $12,500 now in the current marketplace,

[02:20] it's starting to look like a bargain.

[02:22] Now look, let's talk about my last show real quick.

[02:24] We all know that we are paying more than we should for these games.

[02:27] And everybody knows that, and they are basically baking in the flipper price or

[02:32] the emotional surcharge on all of these games.

[02:35] Aston-LE, if we're to look at historically just normal inflation,

[02:39] Aston-LE that used to be like $8,500 or $9,000 should right now be costing more

[02:46] like 10, 5.

[02:47] You know what's crazy is like Godzilla-LE.

[02:49] People forget this.

[02:50] Godzilla-LE was accurately priced at $10,500.

[02:56] And then they raised it with Rush and they're raising it again.

[03:00] James Bond-LE at $13,000, we all know is overpriced.

[03:06] But here's what I'm really curious about is how can you then, if it's $13,000 for

[03:10] this game, there is no way they can charge $13,000 for Venom, right?

[03:15] A theme that doesn't have as much appeal as James Bond.

[03:18] So what is Stern gonna do in the future?

[03:20] Are they gonna make less LEs, make them more rare?

[03:23] Or are they gonna lower the price?

[03:25] See, I don't think they're gonna lower the price.

[03:27] I don't even think they're gonna lower the volume.

[03:29] I think this is it.

[03:30] I think you're gonna see every single game here on out be these prices.

[03:34] And then I think you're gonna see all these distributors starting to price

[03:38] adjust their older models, right?

[03:40] So now all the premiums are gonna be $9,700 and all the LEs are gonna be $13,000.

[03:45] The unfortunate thing for people getting into the hobby now is everyone who has

[03:50] an old LE, ones in which they were actually LEs, like limited, where they only

[03:54] made 500.

[03:56] Now, everyone who has their hands on one of those games is going to think

[04:00] they're worth this much money.

[04:02] So if you have an LE that only has 500 units made, bang, it's worth $15,000.

[04:08] It kinda sucks because people getting into the hobby now,

[04:11] they're absolutely gonna be paying these crazy surcharge prices.

[04:15] But everybody knows what's coming.

[04:17] It's going to soften up people.

[04:19] The world economy is in the toilet and it's just beginning.

[04:23] This is not the end of a recession.

[04:25] There's no fast turnaround coming, ladies and gentlemen.

[04:28] There is so much reality happening with everybody's economic situation.

[04:33] And if you think that's not gonna slow down people's pinball purchases,

[04:37] I think you're dead wrong.

[04:39] I would be really cautious if I was a manufacturer right now at these prices.

[04:45] I would be really cautious if I was a distributor right now,

[04:49] how much inventory I'm going to buy because I think you might be sitting on

[04:54] that inventory for a really long time.

[04:56] And I think as a customer and as a consumer, we're all not as wealthy as Bill

[05:01] Brandis and Ed Robertson.

[05:03] I think a lot of us out there are gonna start to say, hey,

[05:07] maybe it's not the smart thing to buy right now.

[05:10] And also this, if you have free cash, and I mean this,

[05:12] if you have free cash sitting on cash right now,

[05:15] the smart move in the next like six months to a year is not gonna be to buy

[05:20] a pinball machine, it's going to be investing in real investments

[05:25] because you're gonna be able to put your money into the stock market and

[05:28] other investments and get incredible deals and then watch your money grow and

[05:35] then cash out and get a pinball machine.

[05:37] But you don't listen to Canada's Pinball Podcast for financial advice,

[05:41] you'll listen to Canada for pinball and what's going on in the pinball world.

[05:44] So what is happening in the pinball world?

[05:45] So some really good news over at Jersey Jack Pinball,

[05:48] we are hearing that they are working on the Guns and Roses code.

[05:51] They are balancing out the scoring in the game, which is great.

[05:54] That's something people have been asking for for a very long time.

[05:58] Here's another interesting thing, they're adding new light shows to some of the songs.

[06:02] So I heard the song It's So Easy has an all new light show, that's incredible.

[06:07] They're also adding more call out so that when you're in a song, you know what to shoot.

[06:12] I think this is a good thing for any of you who have played Guns and Roses,

[06:16] sometimes when you're in a song mode, it just seems like everything is lit up and

[06:20] you're not really sure what to shoot.

[06:22] So that's a good thing.

[06:23] It's just a good thing in general that Jersey Jack is listening to feedback on

[06:28] this game, they are polishing it and they are going to finish this code.

[06:32] Now some people are saying are there going to be more songs in the game?

[06:36] Ladies and gentlemen, there are 22 songs in this game.

[06:41] I don't think you're going to see Knock It On Heaven's Door because then they'd

[06:44] have to license that from Bob Dylan.

[06:46] I don't think you're going to see Hard School.

[06:48] I don't think you're going to see more tracks.

[06:50] I think there is more than enough in this game to satiate a Guns and Roses fan.

[06:56] Now speaking of Guns and Roses, you can go today and get a Newnbox GNR LE for

[07:03] roughly $9,000.

[07:06] I think that's a great buy, nine grand for a Guns and Roses LE Newnbox.

[07:12] Now speaking about Newnbox Jersey Jack pinball games,

[07:15] I see that Greg over at Straight Down the Middle is selling his LE for 10-2.

[07:21] So already an $1,800 loss on this game right away.

[07:25] Now look, I know there's a lot of debate on whether or not there's church and state

[07:29] and conflict of interest if someone's going to hype a game and then sell it right away,

[07:34] but that's just where the market is on the game.

[07:36] It doesn't change his enthusiasm for the game.

[07:39] The ultimate reality is he's also just a person trying to sell a game and the market

[07:44] is going to set the price.

[07:45] I don't have a problem with someone reviewing a game, being excited about it, spending a

[07:50] couple months on it, and also guys, don't forget this, when they review games, they

[07:54] get new games, they review them, and then they move them on.

[07:57] That's part of being a reviewer.

[07:59] Now do I think you're going to give a game a little bit more of a positive review if

[08:03] you're also selling it?

[08:04] Of course, of course, but we all know that.

[08:06] This isn't like anything new, but the ultimate truth of all of this is that Toy Story as

[08:11] a game isn't holding its value very well.

[08:14] In fact, it's pretty painful how much money people are losing on this game Newnbox, and

[08:19] the price is just going to keep going south because I still think Guns and Roses LE is

[08:24] a superior game than Toy Story LE.

[08:26] I think there's way more interesting shots, I think there's way more interesting mechs

[08:30] in the game, I think there's way more interesting code in the game, I think there's way more

[08:34] interesting theme integration in the game.

[08:37] I mean ultimately Guns and Roses is a Guns and Roses fans theme integration dream come

[08:42] true.

[08:43] Toy Story is a Toy Story fans theme nightmare integration coming true.

[08:48] Nobody wanted the fourth movie only, and there's just not that many assets in it, and when

[08:52] they show the Toy Story 4 movie clips nothing synced up again, it's just another Willy

[08:56] Wonka where they're just like muted clips playing.

[08:59] Guns and Roses is anything but muted clips, you see Axel hitting every note live in concert,

[09:05] while Slash is playing his solos, you see him hitting every note on the guitar, it's

[09:09] done perfectly, and I mean it when I say this, people are going to move away from G&R, and

[09:15] then they're going to realize I think years from now how special the game really is.

[09:20] The question I have is this, now that Jersey Jack Pimbal has started to fix the flipper

[09:24] issue on their games, is it a software issue?

[09:28] Will they be able to fix the flipper feel on G&R using a software tweak?

[09:33] We will see, I don't know yet, I don't know, I don't know if it's hardware or software,

[09:36] we'll see what happens with this new beta code update that is coming for Guns and Roses fans.

[09:41] The other question I have with JJP is when are we going to see the next game, right,

[09:45] because clearly Toy Story sales are not where they need them to be, clearly the demand is

[09:49] not really there.

[09:51] We're seeing more LEs fresh off the line, and I'm kind of confused by that, have you

[09:55] made all the CEs, there's no way they made a thousand CEs, so I think this is going to

[10:00] be a really interesting fall into winter for Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[10:05] If demand for Toy Story dries up, will we see them get the next game on the line sooner,

[10:11] the next game is rumored to be Eric Minier's Godfather, I heard that game has been done

[10:16] for a while because Guns and Roses was done for a while before it even came out, and it's

[10:21] probably a good sign that they're tweaking G&R code, it means they're probably pretty

[10:25] done with Godfather code, who knows but I do know this, Jersey Jack Pimbal must be pretty

[10:31] anxious to get past Toy Story, the vibes aren't there, I don't think Toy Story is going to

[10:37] win any awards at the Twippies, it's not even ranked in the top 100 Pimbal machines of all

[10:42] time, it didn't even break the top 100, the vitriol towards this game is loud and clear,

[10:50] it is a total misproduct, they whiffed on one of the greatest Pimbal franchises of all

[10:56] time.

[10:57] Alright, let's go on to American Pimbal, so American Pimbal, this is going to be an interesting

[11:02] couple weeks for David Fix and American Pimbal because David Fix is behind Pimbal Expo, no

[11:07] Canada will not be there, but David Fix is one of the show organizers and this is basically

[11:13] like his show, so it's his moment and we know that AP has a big set up over at Pimbal Expo

[11:20] and we know that last week they just announced the three tiers to Legends of Vahala, so let's

[11:25] talk about this first, so if you want to buy Legends of Vahala there are three versions

[11:30] of the game you can get and I don't quite get this, there is the Deluxe Limited Edition

[11:35] which is limited to 500 games at $8400, then there is the new Deluxe version, not limited,

[11:44] they'll make as many as they want for $8000 and then there is the Classic Edition which

[11:50] is also new for $7400.

[11:54] It's really weird because when you look at the differences between the Limited Deluxe

[11:58] and the Deluxe, it's like they're taking away the hand painted sculpted items and replacing

[12:04] them with flat plastics and it has a standard non-mirrored back glass versus a mirrored

[12:10] on the Limited Deluxe and then it also has black powder coating versus the gold powder

[12:15] coating and so here's what I think they're doing here, I don't think anyone really wants

[12:20] the Deluxe Non-Limited, I think they still need to sell those 500 Deluxe Limited, so

[12:27] I think the new Deluxe is simply meant to sell the old stock because think about it, the

[12:33] much nicer version with the topper, with everything else that's sculpted with the mirrored back

[12:38] glass, the much nicer version which you would much rather have is only $400.

[12:46] Are we seeing anyone else separate like different tier models by just $400?

[12:52] So I think that's what the Deluxe is meant to do, it's meant to sell the remaining inventory

[12:57] of the Deluxe Limited and then we get the Classic which makes more sense at being $1000

[13:03] cheaper.

[13:04] Now here's the thing, how much demand for Legends of Vahala can there really be?

[13:10] I mean look, I get it, this is a Riot pinball game that they licensed, they made it, they

[13:15] put it into production, I'm not mad about that, I've played this game, it's alright,

[13:21] it's not worth $8400 to me, I get that some people out there really like the game and that's

[13:26] great, but how long can demand for this game really last?

[13:30] I mean this game has been out for over a year, it was at last year's Pinball Expo, what's

[13:36] the deal, how can a game like this have demand for a year and a half, two years?

[13:42] Everybody wants to see the next American pinball game.

[13:45] Now I asked a question on my Patreon page, I said how many of you think that we're going

[13:49] to see the new AP game this year and most of you don't, I think only 30% said you think

[13:56] you're going to see it this year, I think this is a golden opportunity for American

[14:00] pinball to finally show us the Dennis Nordman game, what they've got going on, is it Galactic

[14:05] Space Force, it's based on a 1950's sci-fi theme, but I just don't get the sense that

[14:11] that is right around the corner, but we know the game must be close.

[14:15] Franchi was showing people like the play field and the artwork over at the CoinTaker tailgating

[14:20] party, I think it's just going to come down to like parts supply and when they can actually

[14:24] make these games, but I think it would be a good time to get this game out at the right

[14:29] price if I'm American pinball.

[14:30] I am excited to see the game, I am because I'm not excited about $13,000 stern elites,

[14:36] I'm just not.

[14:38] If American pinball can come out with this game and it's less than $10,000, I think they

[14:43] give themselves a real chance to attract people to the game, I really do.

[14:48] So it's going to be an interesting expo for American pinball, I think they're going to

[14:51] tease their new game, I don't think they're going to reveal it.

[14:53] Now speaking of expo, I didn't even talk about this, is James Bond going to be there?

[14:57] So if Jack Danger is streaming this game on October 18th, does that mean we're going to

[15:02] see the game at expo?

[15:04] I don't know.

[15:05] I don't know if Stern's going to let the cat out of the bag, I don't know if Marco's

[15:08] going to bring games to the show, I have a feeling that it won't be at the show, I'm

[15:12] not sure, but I have a feeling that Stern wants this game to be more polished and I'm

[15:16] not even sure the game is fully on the line yet.

[15:19] The rumor is there's some part delays over at Stern and that's why the game's not on

[15:23] the production line just yet.

[15:25] Alright, someone sent me a long update from Multimorphic, October 2022 Multimorphic Manufacturing

[15:32] Update, I'm not going to read all of this because it's a really long update.

[15:36] But basically the gist is this, is that Jerry says he's hiring more people, demand for Multimorphic

[15:43] is coming in stronger each day and they're trying to ramp up their employees to meet

[15:48] the demand of the game.

[15:50] Here's an interesting line, I want to read this on the business update because he also

[15:53] said that they are going to release two full featured games in 2023.

[15:59] Okay, so that's interesting, so keep that in mind.

[16:02] And then he says, as more of you get your machines and share them with others, more

[16:07] orders come in.

[16:08] Wow, okay, how do you share a game with others?

[16:11] It's a pretty heavy thing to share with someone else.

[16:13] He says, in fact, new orders are coming in just as fast as we're increasing our production

[16:18] speed, keeping the estimated lead times for new orders stable at 12 to 13 months.

[16:27] Are you kidding me?

[16:28] If you order a game, you have to wait an entire year to get it.

[16:33] Stable, Jerry, hire more people, nobody wants to wait an entire year for a game.

[16:40] I mean, think about it, this doesn't make sense.

[16:43] Never Spooky Pinball reveals a new game, they are cranking out those new games each week.

[16:49] Only if you're at the end of the line do you wait 12 to 13 months to get a game.

[16:56] Why is it so hard for this guy to get people to make these games?

[17:00] Are you seeing weird out unboxings anywhere?

[17:03] I'm not.

[17:04] I mean, at least we saw a container of fathoms go out finally.

[17:08] I think there was like six of them in a container.

[17:11] So congratulations Damien and Marty, you got a container of fathoms out the door.

[17:16] Man, it is really hard making Pinball and I know I neg these companies, but the truth

[17:21] is this, it just comes down to like, you need people to make the games and you shouldn't

[17:27] take all of these orders.

[17:29] You shouldn't even be taking orders if the lead time is 12 to 13 months.

[17:34] The order banks should remain closed.

[17:36] They should be catching up on their backlog and they shouldn't take new orders until

[17:40] they have games.

[17:41] How about this?

[17:42] How about instead of taking all these pre-orders and making people wait forever, you take 40

[17:48] orders at a time, you build those 40 games and those people only wait a few months, a

[17:53] couple months and then you open up the order banks again.

[17:56] Why should people be locking their money in and look, it's all on the consumers too.

[17:59] I don't know who would go in on a game where they know going in if I order in October of

[18:05] 2022.

[18:06] I am not going to see my game until October of 2023.

[18:10] Like that's a name.

[18:11] Why would you do that?

[18:13] There are going to be four more games from Stern Pinball.

[18:15] There's going to be a new game from Jersey Jack.

[18:17] All of these new games will come out that you could have inbox that month or two.

[18:22] Why would you lock your money in?

[18:24] And I think Jerry has a real manufacturing issue and it's still crippling his ability.

[18:29] And here's the other crazy part.

[18:31] Why would you reveal two more new games next year when you can't even build them?

[18:36] Think about it.

[18:37] Let's say he reveals a new game in like March next year.

[18:41] So if you order it, you're not getting it to March of the following year.

[18:45] Jerry, do me a favor.

[18:47] Marketing 101, you don't want your customer to wait a year to get a product.

[18:53] Don't reveal a game until it's on the line.

[18:55] Why would you reveal a game that you can't even make for that customer for 12 to 13 months?

[19:02] It's absolutely innate.

[19:03] Here's the thing.

[19:04] What it is, I don't believe that there is this much demand for multi-morphic.

[19:08] I just don't believe it.

[19:10] If it's true, Jerry, I challenge you, Jerry, because I know someone's going to share this

[19:13] with you.

[19:14] I challenge you, Jerry, tell us how many multi-morphics you've built and shipped to date.

[19:20] I will bet you in the eight years that multi-morphic has been in existence in which maybe five

[19:25] years they've been making games, I bet you he has not built and shipped the same amount

[19:30] of games that Stern builds in one single week.

[19:34] Canada's just challenging you, Jerry, because the numbers don't lie, people.

[19:38] As I said in the last episode, the numbers don't lie and I don't get why these things

[19:43] are always a secret.

[19:44] Speaking of numbers not lying, I am happy to see that the other pinball content creators

[19:51] are starting to wake up to Patreon.

[19:53] Have you noticed this for years?

[19:56] And I mean this for years.

[19:58] When Canada turned on Patreon and then Canada took a show behind the paywall, what happened?

[20:03] I got a lot of arrows in the back.

[20:05] Everyone would make fun of me.

[20:06] I could go grab all the sound clips of everybody making fun of me, everybody making fun of

[20:11] my show being behind the paywall, everybody saying I was stupid, everyone saying that's

[20:16] not what you do for the community, everyone saying I was greedy, it's a cash grab, all

[20:20] the negativity, right?

[20:21] All the bad things that come when you just want to show support for people who spend a

[20:25] lot of time making content you enjoy.

[20:27] So what's happening now?

[20:29] Think how everyone is changing their tune and everyone starting to dip their toe into

[20:32] Patreon and I think it's a good thing, I really do.

[20:36] I think it's a good thing because what Patreon does and when you do this, you are staring

[20:42] right in the face how popular you really are, how enthusiastic your fans really are to show

[20:48] their support and I mean it when I say it.

[20:51] This can be a very cheap and fickle community.

[20:54] I mean think about it.

[20:55] And we're hearing on one end of the spectrum that 5,000 people listen to every episode

[21:00] about people's shows and then you ask for support and you get hardly any support.

[21:05] What's happening there?

[21:06] Like what is happening there?

[21:07] How do those two things add up?

[21:09] But like let's just look at the numbers because I love looking at the numbers because look,

[21:13] if we go down a list, if you go on the Patreon and you type in Pinball, all of the different

[21:17] Pinball shows come up.

[21:19] Here are the numbers.

[21:20] Bo and Karens comes up.

[21:21] Bo and Karens has 118 monthly Patreon subscribers which nets him $551 a month.

[21:31] So that's awesome.

[21:32] Bo and congratulations.

[21:33] He's number two by the way.

[21:35] Kari Hardy doesn't share his numbers.

[21:38] Pindigo or Pindigo is creating a social high score app for Pinball players.

[21:43] They have 63 patrons a month at $194.

[21:48] So that's good.

[21:49] The Electric Gamers Podcast, Dennis Kresel's podcast, 28 subscribers, he just started it.

[21:55] I would give Dennis some advice.

[21:56] One of his tiers is a $1 tier.

[21:59] Why would you have a $1 tier?

[22:01] So you could be doing all this work for $28 a month.

[22:03] It makes absolutely no sense.

[22:05] Deadflip, Jack Danger's on Patreon.

[22:07] We all know Jack Danger makes all of his money on Twitch.

[22:10] He has 22 patrons a month.

[22:13] Then we go to the Triple Drain Pinball Podcast, 19 patrons a month at $104.

[22:18] Now Triple Drain, they got to split that money three ways.

[22:21] VP Chat, Virtual Pinball Discord Chat.

[22:25] There is a Virtual Pinball Discord that has 14 patrons at $97 a month.

[22:29] The Backbox Pinball Podcast has 14 patrons a month at $119.

[22:36] Pinball videos, I haven't even heard of some of this stuff.

[22:38] Pinball videos has 12 patrons a month.

[22:41] Skill Shot, Seattle's Pinball Zine has eight patrons a month.

[22:46] Silverball Chronicles, which does some of the hardest work in all pinball content creation.

[22:51] Silverball Chronicles has eight patrons a month.

[22:54] My boy Retro Dango over there, Sengiz has, I don't think he lists his patrons.

[22:59] Let's see, this is my favorite one.

[23:00] Here's my favorite, Head to Head Pinball Podcast, which hasn't been out for years.

[23:03] It was Marty and Ryan Sees' show.

[23:05] They still have two patrons a month.

[23:07] I don't know if it's both of them.

[23:08] That's where we're at.

[23:09] And leading the charge, yours truly,

[23:12] is the Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[23:13] At my height, we were at 560, but we are now holding strong at 537 patrons every single month.

[23:22] And the numbers keep growing.

[23:23] Like we keep going up.

[23:24] I get I took a hit after my drunken rant and like 15 people walked away,

[23:29] but we'll get them back because there's no replacement for Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[23:33] There isn't.

[23:34] There's just no other show out there that does it quite like this.

[23:37] So everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[23:39] We're going to be back.

[23:40] There's going to be a lot more to talk about when we see the James Bond stream.

[23:44] So that is coming.

[23:45] But I just wanted to say, look, it's been a really weird year.

[23:48] I'm going to do another show about 2022 in general, like a recap of this year in Pinball.

[23:53] And I do think that this has been one of the worst when it comes to like manufacturer games

[23:59] and what kind of year it was in Pinball.

[24:00] This was one of like the most underwhelming years in Pinball since I've been covering this hobby.

[24:05] And I know you feel it too.

[24:07] It doesn't mean you haven't had fun in Pinball, right?

[24:09] It doesn't mean you haven't had fun listening to shows and hanging out with your friends

[24:12] and playing the games you own, because that's what Pinball is all about.

[24:15] Like you should always be having fun in the hobby you're in.

[24:18] But when it comes to new games and it comes to like the prices and what we've been getting,

[24:24] it was a very underwhelming year.

[24:26] So look out for that show.

[24:27] It's coming soon because I don't think we're going to get any new games this year.

[24:30] I really mean it.

[24:31] I don't think we're going to get anything new.

[24:33] I think what you see is what you get when it comes to the Twippies and what's coming

[24:37] out this year.

[24:39] We'll talk to you soon.

[24:40] Have a good day.
