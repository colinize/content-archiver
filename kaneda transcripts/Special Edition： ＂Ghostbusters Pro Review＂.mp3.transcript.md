[00:00] i don't think there's anything sweeter than a friday

[00:19] of a long holiday weekend it's uh... memorial day weekend

[00:22] uh... it's gonna be a fun one the weather is gonna be great here in new york city

[00:26] i hope all of you have plans to go to barbecues relax chill out

[00:31] place on pinball drink some beer

[00:34] uh... but if you're doing beer make sure you get the new budwisers cans

[00:38] uh... but was is one of my clients and i helped them launch the

[00:42] the new america campaign so if you look at every new

[00:45] bottle and can of budwisers this summer

[00:48] we've actually replaced the word budwis are with america really cool a lot a

[00:52] lot of details in that can that are really neat

[00:55] so this special edition of canada's pinball podcast i want to i want to review

[00:59] ghost busters pro a little bit and i'll tell you why i want to review it now so

[01:03] some of you might have been expecting an interview with happily married uh... to

[01:08] go up on canada's pinball podcast today and

[01:11] i really want you to have that interview uh... him and i were set to talk last

[01:15] night he just kind of said he didn't want to do it uh... he sort of bailed on me

[01:19] said he hasn't been following the hobby much recently

[01:23] and he's not up to speed on things and so he didn't want to talk

[01:27] even though a few days earlier we had set up a time to talk so

[01:31] i get it i get it i think he sort of got burnt out a bit by the hobby and i

[01:35] think a lot of people can relate to that uh... he's very outspoken he's very

[01:39] opinionated and i was really looking forward to getting someone like that on the

[01:42] show to share his opinions about pinball

[01:45] but i all i can do ladies and gentlemen

[01:47] is offer people chance to come on the show and if they don't want to talk and

[01:51] if they don't want to talk last minute does not i can do

[01:54] i was trying to scramble get someone else to talk to you have an interview

[01:57] but the good news is this i'm scheduled to talk tonight

[02:01] uh... to the black night

[02:02] and he's awesome so i think we're gonna have an incredible conversation

[02:06] so instead of sitting in my apartment and moping and watching basketball i

[02:10] said to myself

[02:12] let me go play some ghost busters and ghost busters pro is located at pioneer

[02:17] bar in new york city really close to where i live it's it's on a

[02:20] twenty

[02:22] twenty ninth street between six and seven avenues

[02:26] literally a five-minute bike ride for me so i'd hop on my bike and i went there

[02:30] and i'm gonna play some ghost busters pro

[02:32] the reason why i think i've been talking more about these pins and speculating

[02:36] about them than actually playing them so let me go play a pro

[02:40] i played the ghost busters pro at

[02:43] texas pinball festival but as you guys who are there no there was always a

[02:47] long line

[02:48] and you got on it and you sort of more just mesmerized by the machine actually

[02:52] existing and being in front of you then really sort of paying attention to uh...

[02:55] the game itself

[02:57] uh... where i'm to i played it

[02:59] also at

[03:00] alan town a bunch but again

[03:03] not really in ability to play like four five games in a row and i think it

[03:07] helps when you can

[03:08] play

[03:10] five six seven games in a row to get a feel for the game itself so

[03:14] i went to pioneer bar

[03:15] and i went there and there is nobody on it there they they have the

[03:18] following machines right next to each other they had a kiss

[03:21] ghost busters pro

[03:23] then they have a game of thrones ellie

[03:26] and the walking dead ellie

[03:27] so really nice selection of sterns all next to each other a good variety

[03:33] uh... and i actually went in and i played all of them so i could also compare

[03:37] how ghost busters pro felt next to those other pins so

[03:41] before i give you my assessment of what it was like playing ghost busters pro

[03:45] i want to give you my decision on what i am doing with my ghost busters ellie

[03:50] i have decided

[03:52] after much debate much back and forth that i am going to keep my ghost busters

[03:57] ellie and not sell it

[04:00] uh... for ten thousand dollars plus

[04:02] and i'll explain why first and foremost i just really want one it's

[04:08] i've been really excited to get it i think the ellie art package is beautiful

[04:12] i think it's special

[04:14] i think the slimer green with the color palette of zombie at ease playfield

[04:19] looks

[04:20] phenomenal there's a reason why they picked this one to be the ellie it looks

[04:24] great

[04:25] uh... for those of you who don't like the green i get it i see where you're coming

[04:29] from

[04:30] uh... but slimer is

[04:32] uh... you such an iconic part of ghost busters and the slimer ellie just looks

[04:35] really really cool

[04:37] uh... i also you know i won't lie i if i don't think there was like a

[04:41] a lose scenario for me i think if i

[04:44] keep the ellie and i keep it new in box until i'm ready to set it up

[04:48] i don't think i'm going to lose any money on this pinball machine i think ghost

[04:52] buster ellie is are going to be

[04:54] sought after for a long time

[04:56] uh... even after the hype dies down because it's just such an amazing theme and

[05:00] the art package is amazing

[05:02] it's going to really stand out and i'll say that because next to the walking

[05:06] dead next to game of throes

[05:08] uh... ellie next to kiss

[05:10] ghost buster still just like blows them away in terms of art package in terms

[05:14] of fun factor when you're looking at each pin so

[05:18] i've decided to keep it

[05:20] uh... also say this my buyer

[05:22] that i had lined up

[05:24] so funny you know these buyers get just as much in heat and get anxious and they

[05:29] really want it like this guy on

[05:32] Tuesday was all about like i want to pay for it right now it's for my autistic

[05:35] son and he you know i'll i'll be in trouble if i don't get it and he was

[05:40] really ready to pull the trigger

[05:42] and i was just like well okay let me just think about it

[05:44] and i i actually did something i'd i found him

[05:47] another seller

[05:49] uh... because i really felt bad i'm like he i want him to get this pin for his

[05:52] autistic son

[05:54] and i found him another person willing to sell it

[05:56] and then all of a sudden he's like well i'm going on a business trip i really

[05:59] can't do anything until the middle of june

[06:02] and

[06:03] we can talk then and i just i don't know i think

[06:05] a lot of people get like that they get in heat

[06:08] and they they get they stare at the pictures of something they want

[06:12] and they have to have it

[06:13] but they really don't think long and hard about what it means to actually send

[06:17] ten thousand dollars over a wire to someone for a pinball machine

[06:21] uh... and i think if you if you

[06:22] pause and you step back a little bit

[06:25] you sometimes realize that that's a lot of money

[06:27] but as we saw in pincide one sold for ten thousand dollars new in box

[06:32] and the guy put up a thread saying you know don't

[06:35] don't get mad at me but i sold it and i think it's great he sold it

[06:37] i do i think it's great i think he he locked out he might regret it if people

[06:41] get their elies and and and are just loving them

[06:44] uh... but look

[06:45] this is this is the normal way of

[06:48] supplying demand and how pinballs always gonna be so people are always

[06:51] going through you're gonna find flippers you're gonna find guys who

[06:54] who came in late and didn't get in on something early enough people are

[06:58] gonna start flipping rob zombies you'll see it it's gonna happen

[07:01] and people are going to pay more than the initial people

[07:04] uh... paid to get that pin

[07:06] uh... what will rob zombie go for what people paid what like six thousand

[07:10] between six and sixty five hundred

[07:12] uh... people are gonna flip those for eight thousand nine thousand dollars i'm

[07:15] sure they will there's only three hundred but anyway goes busters let me talk

[07:18] about my my thoughts on the pinball machine because i don't want to make this

[07:21] special edition too long

[07:22] uh...

[07:23] so i

[07:24] i definitely think that

[07:26] ghost buses is a hard pinball machine and i say that

[07:31] uh... because like many of you

[07:34] i think i approach this pinball machine

[07:37] like other stones and i just expect to have a little bit more control over

[07:42] the ball but there's just

[07:45] there's a lot of shots that just punish you in this pinball machine and i'm

[07:48] looking at the playfield and

[07:50] you know i would say again

[07:53] all the drains happen on the left side and happen down the middle

[07:57] there there's just i don't feel like it drains on the right

[08:00] i think the right for some reason doesn't have as many

[08:02] kickbacks to that section

[08:05] but i i really still can't

[08:08] get over

[08:09] the left

[08:10] drain issue i i i don't know why they didn't put

[08:14] a post

[08:16] it in front of the wire there i think that would just solve all the issues or

[08:21] least had

[08:22] there's something about that thick wire that always just makes the ball you

[08:26] know because the balls heading to it

[08:28] i just think it hits it and always sort of has a tendency to deflect the left

[08:34] and it's just it's just frustrating right it's just frustrating so

[08:38] but it's not a deal breaker by any means i think you just have to learn like

[08:41] what shots

[08:43] caused that to happen

[08:46] that was a constant all night long

[08:49] the flippers themselves that the gap between the flippers i didn't really find

[08:54] that to be too much of an issue i think with all true to pins

[08:57] you learn to

[08:59] uh... you learn to adjust

[09:01] and you learn that okay the ball

[09:04] can be cradle but i it's not going to it's not as easy to cradle with

[09:07] turtles flippers because of how far they are part

[09:10] and a lot of times if the balls coming at the flipper with enough spin

[09:15] it's gonna spin off

[09:17] uh... and it is the angle of the flippers

[09:20] are angled down a little bit

[09:22] and see but you get used to it you get used to it

[09:24] i'll say this to ghost busters is a machine

[09:28] that you just can't

[09:30] walk up to it

[09:32] and just sort of

[09:35] flip around like crazy you need to really get control of the ball

[09:39] but the game itself makes it hard to have control the ball because if you i'm

[09:43] looking at the playfield now there's just so

[09:46] many things to shoot

[09:48] and there's so many

[09:50] sort of

[09:51] there's so many times in the

[09:53] the ball is just always getting kicked back at you

[09:57] uh... there's not a lot of

[09:59] you know it's like the complete opposite of the habit where you can like you

[10:02] can't really fire the ball up

[10:05] and watch it do much and then wait for it to come back and plan very quickly

[10:10] because i think that things that's got to come back to you

[10:13] really quickly

[10:15] uh... something else i noticed on the pro i was playing last night

[10:19] was the

[10:20] the slimer mech was the old one and it registered i mean i want to say this thing

[10:24] registered like only twenty percent of the time so those of you who have the old

[10:28] slimer mech it is a p o s a piece of shit like it's done needs to fix

[10:34] uh... that issue for everybody it you should have to open it up and reset the

[10:38] cable it he was hardly registering

[10:41] which got really frustrating because a lot of the times

[10:44] that was the goal of whatever mode i was in it was just a slimer

[10:49] light was blinking and i would just keep hitting him and nothing would happen

[10:52] like i i i was playing in a bar with that was loud so there's i had no audio

[10:57] and i think we need to remove the audio from ghostbusters is just not that much

[11:02] is not as much fun as it is when you have all the call outs and the music going

[11:06] but that being said you know after like a bunch of games i started to get

[11:10] a rhythm and i started to realize

[11:13] what trotto is going for here and

[11:16] and what i was watching other people play as well and it's a game

[11:20] we have to approach it with a little bit of patience and you have to sort of

[11:25] think about your shots much more carefully because you will get punished if

[11:30] you're just sort of sending the ball up there without any uh... without any

[11:34] strategy and for those of you who said that the right ramp is impossible to hit

[11:39] i figured out the easiest way to hit it it's to

[11:43] loop around the left orbit so if you fully plunge and the ball comes out the

[11:48] left orbit and let the ball dead pass off the left flipper and backhand it with

[11:53] the right flipper you can hit that right ramp like dead on dead on i was hitting

[11:59] it i probably hit it ten times in in about six games just by doing that so

[12:05] that is how you have to approach that you cannot i don't think you can hit that

[12:10] ramp from the left flipper it's just it's too it's it's it's really

[12:15] designed for a backhand off the right flipper but man it's so satisfying when

[12:20] you when you uh... hit it with that loop around orbit to the to the dead pass flip

[12:25] it's just so much fun i couldn't you know again i'm i'd still early for me

[12:29] with like code and knowing what to do i did feel that at times there was uh

[12:35] you get punished for hitting your shot and i didn't like that like if you hit the

[12:38] ghost symbol like above where it says ghost straight up the middle you got to

[12:44] be really careful because that ball will just come straight down quickly and

[12:48] drain i think they know though that the pin is really brutal because there's

[12:53] just so many ball saves that that occur in the game and i'm not even sure

[12:58] when ball saves get turned on but it it seems like when you're taking

[13:02] high-risk shots the ball would get saved far into a ball so it was it was

[13:07] nice that that's there and i think that'll help people not be so frustrated with it

[13:11] but i want to say this and and that's sort of like my short review of ghostbusters i

[13:16] think the the pinball machine is absolutely beautiful i do think it's a lot of fun i

[13:20] kept coming back to play it you know jumping back between game of thrones and ghostbusters

[13:25] and the walking dead it it it's night and day right game for those of you who like straight

[13:30] up flow you can't be game of thrones that that machine is just it's like butter

[13:35] watching the ball go around those ramps and looping around and and ghostbusters is not like that

[13:39] at all i don't think it's meant to be like that it's not it's it's this is a game that's a little

[13:44] wacky it's a little weird it's it's you know i think some could even say it's a little clunky at

[13:48] times uh but it but it feels like ghostbusters i feel like there's just a lot of weird wacky stuff

[13:55] going on that you're you're trying to do and it's it's i don't really think a ghostbusters pin

[14:00] that that flows like like a game of thrones or a star track would make sense for the theme so

[14:05] i do applaud uh trotto for for jamming that play field with with lots of shots and toys and

[14:11] things to do because i i think that's gonna be a lot of fun i think that you know just the layout

[14:17] alone it's just really fun and inviting for people to jump into and i think people are gonna fix

[14:21] the drain issues if if if this thing just becomes a drained disaster on the left side

[14:27] somebody will come up with a little bit of a solution to help that and i think everyone will

[14:31] adopt it it's it's it is it is confusing to me that stern with all their testing wasn't like

[14:37] dude like what's going on on the left side here like this is just too brutal one of their issues

[14:43] and stern needs to learn to do this you just can't have expert pinball players beta testing your

[14:48] machines guys who are constantly nudging and moving and slapping machines you need to bring in

[14:54] a casual pinball player as an asset like well what do you think like how does it play because

[14:59] unlike a video game you can't really set the difficulty a lot easier on this pin even if you move

[15:06] that left post on i don't even know if that's gonna help too much uh because of the balls tendency

[15:10] to just slide off of that rail but but anyway so i think people are gonna figure out like how to

[15:16] really learn to play this machine so it doesn't become so hard and we're already seeing that

[15:20] people who have gotten in their homes are are starting to you know put up big scores and and

[15:24] learning how to play this machine and i think it takes a learning curve that i think is challenging

[15:29] and good everyone always bitches that they don't like long ball times everyone always bitches that

[15:35] they like code so i think ghostbusters is the perfect mix of what everyone has been asking for

[15:40] for so long it's a game that plays with shorter ball times but has a lot of code that's going to

[15:47] be dialed into it which is great i love the fact that it's a linear progression of the modes i

[15:52] love the fact that when i get this machine set up i'm probably gonna have to play for months

[15:57] to get good at it before i get to stay puff mode i that's what i love i i think i think that is

[16:04] great i think it is great it the same way with lore the rings i love that you have to be really good

[16:08] to get to there and back again i or or destroy the ring uh so uh you know it's it's it's really really

[16:16] fun i think the way they have this pin sort of set up and it's what people ask for so when people

[16:21] bitch about it's brutal short ball times come on guys you didn't want long ball time games and

[16:28] you know i think some of the little quirks will be worked out i also think that the magnus

[16:32] links are gonna change the the way the game plays dramatically and i think it's gonna be for the better

[16:38] the i think the pro is definitely the hardest one to play and the least satisfying to play in fact i

[16:45] i just wouldn't go in on a pro uh because i know the machine was designed to be a certain way and

[16:50] have certain features and and that those sling features are such a big feature in how this game

[16:55] was designed uh and the coding around them is gonna be so cool uh that i would hate to lose it i

[17:01] just think that the traditional slings just are removed so much the magic from this pinball

[17:07] machine and and even though people look at it and say hey stern's really jam packed a lot into the

[17:11] pro and i'm not ragging on you guys about the pro because i still think you get a great game

[17:16] but i think those magnetic slings are gonna be the feature that uh sort of elevate this pinball

[17:21] machine uh to the next level and but we'll see i think the jury's still out and no one's really

[17:25] played that and i'm looking forward to playing a premium le fairly soon uh in terms of just

[17:31] overall package i mean the game is beautiful it's stunning i don't think anyone would argue about

[17:35] that and i think that ghost busters is just gonna be a smash hit for stern and you know i'll say

[17:40] this to the red dots as much as like i would prefer to have something nicer uh once someone adds a

[17:47] color dmd to ghost busters which they will i i think this game is gonna go down as as one of the

[17:53] the great sort of last dmd probably the last dmd error game from stern uh and it's gonna be

[18:01] it's gonna be uh i think it's gonna be a smash hit i think it's gonna be a lot of fun and

[18:06] you know i don't think we have to look at ghost busters and and say it's better than this pin or

[18:10] this pin is better than ghost busters i think we should just enjoy the fact that we finally have a

[18:15] ghost busters theme pinball machine uh it's a different kind of game it brings a lot of different

[18:21] things and elements to pinball that we've been asking for uh it takes some risks with innovations

[18:28] it takes some risks with shot layout uh it's not your traditional cookie cutter layout

[18:35] there's gonna be things about it we like there's gonna be things about about it we don't like

[18:39] but at the end of the day does it put a smile in your face doesn't make you want to plunge one more time

[18:43] and i think for the majority people the answer is gonna be yes certain people are gonna hate it

[18:47] guys who love flow are gonna hate this machine i think they're gonna find it clunky i think they're

[18:51] gonna find the shots too tight uh and i think they're going to uh to have issues with with with

[18:58] with the gameplay and and that's fine and then not every game is gonna appeal to everyone if you

[19:03] want a game that's more wide open you can always go get the hobby if you want a game with a lot more

[19:07] flow you can always go get a game of throne so there's options for everyone but i think ghost

[19:13] busters is a special option that is gonna bring hours and hours of enjoyment for people i think uh

[19:20] people who have ellies and premiums are gonna have nothing but a good time playing this machine

[19:26] and for those of you who don't want to pay the high prices there of course there's gonna be

[19:30] used versions of this game that come on the market people are gonna buy them and and people are

[19:34] gonna go in on the hype and they're gonna realize it's not the pin for them and they're gonna sell

[19:38] them and a lot of you will be able to get really mint home use only versions of ghost busters this

[19:43] year so that's my review of the pro i think it's a difficult pin but i think it's fun it makes me

[19:48] want to keep playing and it makes me really curious uh for the ellie and premium to see how they play

[19:54] and if you have a ghost busters pro and want to share some of your feedback or i'd love to have

[19:59] you on the show just hit me up i want to talk about what it's like after like a hundred plays after

[20:03] two hundred plays did you feel that you got better control of the machine uh have you gotten

[20:09] deeper into the into the codes what is the code like uh is it is it fun to progress through the

[20:14] through the code so hit me up at canada pinball k a and eda pinball at gmail.com and that's it for

[20:22] a little short little sort of canada's assessment of ghost busters and look for the interview with

[20:27] black night that will go up sometime this weekend have a happy memorial day friday people

[20:32] get out of work early go drink some beers and uh play some pinball with some friends this weekend

[20:38] it's it's gonna be a great long weekend to do that have a good day.
