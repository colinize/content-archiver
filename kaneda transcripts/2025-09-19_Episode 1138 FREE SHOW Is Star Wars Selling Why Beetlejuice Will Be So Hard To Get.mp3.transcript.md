[00:30] for months and I'm gonna say this the reason why I know this game is not

[00:35] selling very well I don't have official numbers but I know a reason why and this

[00:41] only happens when a stern game isn't selling very well I start to hear from

[00:49] people at Stern I heard from zombie yeti about some of my comments I heard from

[00:54] George Gomez and they never reach out to me unless the orders are not rolling in

[01:02] I heard from a big distributor that only 25 people ordered Star Wars in like

[01:09] every trim available right you can easily get an LE they didn't sell out it's

[01:15] looking like the pro might be the way to go and you know going in the hype

[01:19] thread a week later it's just kind of out in the world I think all of us are

[01:25] gonna jump on the game I think we will enjoy it the jury is still out on

[01:31] whether or not the game is gonna have long balltimes or not I think it's gonna

[01:35] be more brutal than people think because of where they put the pop bumpers

[01:39] those pop bumpers are really gonna cause a lot of chaos and a lot of drains and

[01:45] they are smack dab in the middle of each side of the game I mean not in the

[01:49] middle of the game but on the sides right there when that ball hits those

[01:53] it's gonna create a lot of drains so look we've seen the footage we've seen the

[01:59] gameplay and it doesn't feel like there's anything left in the tank and

[02:05] that's the thing with pinball launches right you can tease a game and you can

[02:10] get people excited but in the end in the end when the moment of reveal is upon

[02:15] us when we see the game in all of its hopeful glory it really has to excite

[02:22] us and you know I always say like FOMO is dead for stern and it is what's gonna

[02:27] make FOMO come back for stern do you think Pokemon is gonna make each of you

[02:31] go crazy most of you couldn't even name three Pokemon characters okay so we

[02:36] know Pokemon's not gonna have that the walking dead remastered is not gonna

[02:41] have it are you gonna have that over fallout and I just want to say this

[02:45] about fallout I know that fallout is a hugely popular video game I know it is a

[02:53] hugely popular show I know it is a really cool dystopian future world

[03:00] under glass that they could create in a pinball game I get it and I get that

[03:05] some of you are huge fallout fans that being said I don't think most people in

[03:13] pinball cross over and want to own a fallout game I know we're gonna want to

[03:20] play it I know we're gonna have fun see this is the issue now with all of pinball

[03:25] in my honest opinion it's like yeah everyone's starting to realize that it's

[03:28] all fun it's a toy it's a pinball machine this is not a root canal and so when

[03:34] you walk up to a pinball machine you're gonna have a good time most of us when

[03:39] you walk up to galactic tank force knowing you're not gonna buy it will have

[03:44] fun heck I even had fun playing one ball I guess I walked away from the second two

[03:49] balls of Thunderbirds so I wouldn't buy one and this is the whole thing though

[03:54] these companies you gotta remember this they're not making games for the most

[03:59] part to steal our quarters away when we go to the arcade that was what

[04:05] Bally Williams was designing their games for when they made games in the 90s

[04:10] they were designed to steal our quarters to pull us away from all the amazing

[04:16] video games that were inside in arcade and that's why those games are still to

[04:23] this day the greatest world under glass pinball experiences and also the greatest

[04:30] mechanisms in the history of pinball nobody's making better mechanisms in

[04:35] 2025 than Bally Williams did in 1995 you gotta remember that okay because they

[04:42] knew who their audience was they knew and they delivered and they delivered

[04:49] some of the greatest creative moments in pinball nowadays it's different they're

[04:55] not making these games to steal our quarters away all of you listening to

[04:59] this for the most part just a few of you are operators but I would say 98% of you

[05:04] listening right now your coin slots are virgins nothing is penetrated your coin

[05:11] slot and still your game has a working coin slot so nowadays the target is

[05:19] different they need to put something in front of us that is compelling enough for

[05:24] us to want to buy it and at these prices most of the games now are not making a

[05:32] good enough argument for our money and you're keeping your money in your wallet

[05:38] $13,000 for a Star Wars le why would anybody pay that much if you've been

[05:47] alive over the last two years you know the way this game is gonna go you know

[05:53] this game is gonna be 10k in just a month the moment that the walking dead I

[05:59] don't even care if walking dead is better or not it's just Stern's already

[06:03] gonna have moved on in a month in a month and by the time you get your game

[06:08] because you're not getting your le next week by the time you get your game you

[06:12] will be able to have saved $3,000 if you just wait it like a couple months and I

[06:19] think everybody's learning that that you just got to have patience and here's the

[06:23] other part by the time your Star Wars le is now available for $10,000 another

[06:30] game will be revealed Beetlejuice Christopher Franci Spooky Pimbal

[06:36] $999 total units for $9,999 and then which game are you gonna want are you

[06:44] gonna want the Star Wars that everyone's been ragging on for the last month and a

[06:48] half where there's no hype and no FOMO or are you gonna want what is gonna be

[06:54] the hardest game to get in the last five years I mean this right now Beetlejuice

[07:00] is gonna be the most difficult game to acquire in the last five years it's gonna

[07:08] be way harder to get one of those than a Metallica remastered le you name me one

[07:14] game in the last five years that is gonna have the kind of frenzy that Beetlejuice

[07:21] has because what people are forgetting is that there are thousands of pinhead

[07:28] collectors who have wised up and have not been putting their money against

[07:34] these newer machines and they are gonna want Beetlejuice Harry Potter CE if they

[07:40] only made like a certain number of CEs may have been the hardest to get game it

[07:47] would have been even if they only made a thousand Harry Potter is a phenomenal

[07:51] game everybody is saying it I'm not the only one saying it yeah the code isn't

[07:57] exactly how I would have liked it it is a little overly complex but that's just

[08:02] J.J.P.'s thing I don't know you know for all these years I've been telling them

[08:07] just simplify simplify simplify and they still have to have eight things going on

[08:12] at once but still read the room read the room everybody unboxing those Harry

[08:17] Potter's is having an amazing time and the game is stunning but it's not limited

[08:22] so like two years from now if I want a brand new Harry Potter CE in a box I'll

[08:28] be able to get one and of course Harry Potter CEs will go down in value as

[08:34] thousands of them make their way out into the world but I kind of like what

[08:38] Jersey Jack did they're just like you know it's screw it we're just gonna make

[08:41] as many as people want it's not about collecting anymore it's about making

[08:46] something of quality and making something beautiful and making something

[08:51] amazing and the money will come and we don't have to worry about creating

[08:55] FOMO because if it's good enough it will always have FOMO and Harry Potter is

[09:01] delivering on that philosophy but Beetlejuice forget it forget it and I've

[09:07] been telling people to get on a list make sure you get one and there are other

[09:11] reason why Star Wars sales have to be like really in the gutter is this they

[09:17] probably sold 8,000 Star Wars Steve Richie games years ago and how much was

[09:25] that game if we go back I think that game the Ellie I want to say was like

[09:30] $9,000 okay so you've got Star Wars Ellie it might have been 8,500 I don't know

[09:36] what it was but you've got 8,000 Star Wars pinball machines in the world

[09:41] already that are tackling episodes four five and six and it's also those games

[09:47] were called Star Wars not fall of the Empire which is a new made-up name which

[09:54] doesn't click I know it's called Star Wars fall of the Empire but you know what

[09:58] I mean it's a little weird seeing the original trilogy served up with a new

[10:03] name okay just I don't know weird marketing but they did it okay but 8,000

[10:08] games are out in the world and so now you've got a new Star Wars game so

[10:13] Star Wars fans maybe maybe already have one so do you think all of them are

[10:19] gonna absorb the new one some people will but for the most part you're

[10:24] significantly reducing the amount of homes that are gonna want one who don't

[10:30] already have the theme and so from there you really have to invite like new

[10:37] people into the hobby and I hate to say this but you know looking at the video

[10:42] with all the youtubers and the new Stern shill army did you see that first

[10:47] impression video poor Vic Vic I love you man they got Vic on camera if I was Vic

[10:52] I would have been sort of slowly backing up like Homer Simpson into the bushes

[10:57] because you don't want to be on that video saying how fantastic the game is and

[11:02] you can even see it in the people's impressions they're not really ecstatic

[11:07] they are like struggling to say something nice because they're a guest

[11:11] inside Stern's like headquarters and I get it like they would have got me too

[11:16] like I would have something I don't know man the leg bolts look really shiny on

[11:20] this version they would have got me saying something it's just seeing that

[11:24] video makes me really happy that I did not go it would have been weird for me

[11:30] the world's most prolific pinball podcaster who's been in this for 12

[11:34] years to go through that door and see that cast of characters that has no

[11:41] relationship with the pinball community and Stern's biggest mistake still and

[11:46] it's the biggest you happening in all of pinball that they're getting wrong is

[11:50] they still continue to avoid having the conversation with us with you and me

[11:58] guys and gals on canada's pinball podcast community they don't want to talk to us

[12:04] the enthusiast pinhead is not who they are focused on they are afraid of us they

[12:12] are afraid of our feedback they don't know how to engage us mr. sharp over

[12:19] there is more concerned with tournament play and league players he knows that

[12:26] community he doesn't know the home collector the home buyer do any of them

[12:32] I really mean this do any of them I sometimes feel like Gary could give two

[12:38] shITs about us the home buyer all he cares about is that that big check comes

[12:45] from those distributors every new release and the only game he cares about is the

[12:51] game on the line he doesn't care that he sold you a $20,000 James Bond

[12:56] 60th that you lost $12,000 on he doesn't care that he re-released Elvira

[13:02] because he got the big check from those distros he doesn't care that he burned

[13:06] all of us le owners with all of those remakes he doesn't care he did all those

[13:12] moves and Seth and George I mean who is responsible I don't even know you know

[13:16] people are like it's all Seth's fault it's all George's fault it's I don't know

[13:20] collectively though collectively now that they've got a new CMO

[13:24] collectively that is the big shift that stern pinball needs to do and I hate to

[13:30] say this but until they get someone internally over there that represents

[13:36] understands and listens to the home collector not Neil McRae in your ear

[13:43] kissing your ass every single day because that's who's coming over there all the

[13:47] time I mean he was at the media day I think it's like I don't even know like

[13:51] they listen to those people but that's not who they need to listen to it's not

[13:56] the fanboys that will forever shill you you need to listen to the people that

[14:02] used to buy your product and no longer buy your product and I think they've

[14:08] ignored us and I think they think they can just like keep doing it the same way

[14:15] and get a different result because the thing they're missing is really it's not

[14:20] even about each individual title it's really people's opinions about the brand

[14:26] and people seeing moves the brand has made and no longer feeling like that's a

[14:33] company I respect and want to support and when I hear from like Zambietti and

[14:39] George look I never question the passion of the people over at Stern I don't I

[14:45] never question the talent of the people over there I don't when I went over there

[14:50] I told them to their faces you have the greatest manufacturing the greatest

[14:56] themes the greatest talent all of the greatest stuff in the world around this

[15:02] hobby and then I pointed to their last four releases and showed them if people

[15:08] bought every one of your recent games at the highest trim level people lost

[15:13] $17,000 in value this is your number one problem and either you're gonna address

[15:20] this or you're gonna try to ignore it now they tried a little bit to address it by

[15:25] limiting the number of Metallica Elise I mean I do feel like I had a little bit a

[15:31] little bit of influence on that move and that worked out well but it doesn't solve

[15:38] the bigger problem because bringing Metallica back creates even more lack of

[15:45] trust between the pinball community than anything else because everybody who

[15:51] bought an original Metallica is now feeling like bummed out everybody the

[15:56] thousands of people that own the Walking Dead are gonna have the same feeling in

[16:01] just a few weeks so remaking the classics kind of gets you one step further and two

[16:09] steps back in restoring your brand reputation with the hobby I could walk

[16:16] into stern pinball tomorrow and call an emergency meeting and really make this

[16:21] the center point and the North Star for our mission in 2026 and then when you

[16:28] think about it through that lens restoring our brand to this community

[16:33] listening to the community listening to the home buyer you don't end up with

[16:39] fallout you don't pass on Beetlejuice and back to the future how do you pass on

[16:45] Beetlejuice and back to the future they're gonna witness and I mean is

[16:49] they're gonna witness a $10,000 spooky Beetlejuice sell out instantly and then

[16:55] they're gonna witness on the secondhand market these Beetlejuices are gonna be

[16:59] $15,000 to $18,000 right away I mean this I know I said that about

[17:03] Star Wars but I changed my mind this time I mean it there are gonna be way more

[17:08] than a thousand people who want one and there's gonna be and there's gonna be

[17:13] like a feeding frenzy to get one it's gonna be really fun to watch I'm really

[17:18] excited happy birthday by the way happy belated birthday to mr. Christopher

[17:23] freaking Frenchy you know we've been through a lot over the years together

[17:27] we're very similar we've got that Italian blood coursing through our veins we are

[17:32] very emotional we are very short-tempered he's much more talented on an

[17:37] artistic level than me he's very talented on the podcast Mike still

[17:42] created the world's greatest pinball podcast from a production standpoint but

[17:47] it is you know whenever I would listen to his super awesome pinball show it was

[17:52] absolutely like the most well-produced show ever like we didn't deserve it and I

[17:57] would tell him that I would literally tell it to Frenchy every time I saw him

[18:00] bro like they don't deserve this hard work and when he would do those

[18:04] interviews I don't think many people realize when you actually edit an

[18:08] interview not do what other shows do and just upload it with all the ohms and

[18:13] likes and pauses and stumbles no no no when you actually edit an interview to

[18:19] make your guest sound great it takes hours so an hour interview might take

[18:25] four to five hours of editing so the end listener has a better experience and

[18:31] that is what true professionals do when you're making a podcast so happy

[18:36] birthday mr. Frenchy in the end through all of the drama and all of his ups and

[18:41] downs in pinball all of it put him in the best possible place with the best

[18:48] possible people making the best damn pinball machine we're gonna get and I

[18:53] haven't even seen it in 2025 and he's not done over there and now spooky knows

[18:59] what people want and they're gonna keep serving it up in the most stunning way

[19:04] possible unlike other art in pinball the reason why franchise art never gets old

[19:09] is he's taking the source material and just making it better like I've been

[19:14] saying you know what you really want with a theme integration is you want

[19:19] recognition and you want something that's relatable when you see the King Kong

[19:23] art package you're like I don't relate to that art as a King Kong image that's

[19:29] not how I remember King Kong and so when we see Beetlejuice it's gonna be like

[19:35] yep that's the Beetlejuice I know and love yep sorry honey we're not going on

[19:41] that vacation because I just wrote a check for $13,000 because I got the

[19:45] butter cabinet I got the topper I got everything and just so you guys know we

[19:50] are gonna have some examples of spooky pinballs Beetlejuice available

[19:56] exclusively for a canada club members so if you get shut out you will have a

[20:02] second chance at this machine everybody happy Friday is anybody talking about

[20:09] canada out in the world they're always talking about canada out in the world

[20:12] and I don't listen I mean this right now I don't listen to any other shows

[20:15] except for electric bat and Carrie Hardy and I'll watch Todd when he does stuff

[20:21] and of course you know I love my boy Jamie down there at the wormhole pinball

[20:25] which is now going through like a crazy divorce so sad like the story of it is

[20:31] just insane it's not mine to tell so if you ever see Jamie roaming around a show

[20:38] ask him about it it's nuts I mean damn divorce is rough canada out happy

[20:43] Friday
