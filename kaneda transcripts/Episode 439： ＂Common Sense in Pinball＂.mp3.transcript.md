[00:00] Cause a drink spring back all the memories of everything we've been through.

[00:09] Welcome everybody to episode 439 of Canatus Pimball podcast. I'm your host, Canada.

[00:17] Happy Monday morning everybody. This is like the first week back after the holidays and it's

[00:22] always the most difficult to make it through for most people, and I was thinking a lot.

[00:27] I've been reflecting on what I wanted to talk about on this episode because last night after

[00:32] I enjoyed watching the Eagles suffer in defeat, I was just bombarded with photos from CES

[00:40] and Stern Pimball bringing Stranger Things Pimball to CES to stream or to let people

[00:46] play it for the first time. And so I want to talk about something that just keeps sort of

[00:52] lingering over my thought process with this hobby and this community. And that is the notion

[00:59] of common sense. Now my mother, my mother, I love my mother, she would always tell me when I was

[01:05] growing up that the most valuable thing in the world is common sense. And when you have common sense

[01:12] and you use it in your everyday life, you'll be successful. And she would say it doesn't matter

[01:18] how many degrees you have, how smart you think you are. Because if you don't have common sense,

[01:24] you're never going to make it. You're just going to do stupid things and you will fumble your

[01:28] way through life. Now Pimball to me is an interesting hobby because I often try to think about,

[01:34] well, what is the common sensical thing to do? And are these companies that have all of these people

[01:41] and smart individuals that are smart enough to make a highly complex thing like a Pimball machine,

[01:48] how come there are moments in which there just seems to be a complete sort of lapse in common sense.

[01:55] And the thing they're doing just makes me want to pull my hair out because it just seems to make

[02:00] absolutely no sense. So what I want to do on this episode of Canadian Pimball podcast on this Monday

[02:05] morning is just bring up some examples of moments in Pimball that have happened over the last year or

[02:13] so in which I think make no sense and defy common sense. And let's just talk about why these decisions

[02:20] are made. And let's start with the one that was made yesterday to bring stranger things to CES

[02:28] to show people the premium and the Ellie for the first time at the convention center in Las Vegas.

[02:36] Now if you've been to CES or you've been to any of these shows, the one thing you'll know is that

[02:41] the lights are extremely bright. I mean they're brighter than bright. It is not a place where you're

[02:47] going to get any of the projector effect that Stern is looking for people to pull away from this show.

[02:54] It's not going to be impressive. The equivalent I love using cargaments, it would be like taking a

[03:00] Dodge Demon, a car that is designed specifically for the drag strip. It'd be like showing the world

[03:08] Dodge Demon for the first time on an auto cross track. For those of you who don't know cars, auto cross

[03:14] is like a small track usually in big parking lots, which is a lot of twist and turns. And so you're

[03:20] trying to show off the car's ability to turn quickly and zip around. But a Dodge Demon's only

[03:25] meant to go straight. And so taking a stranger things Pimball machine to show the projector feature

[03:33] which needs a really dark room, taking that game to CES. To me is equivalent of showing the

[03:40] world a Dodge Demon for the first time on an auto cross track. So while a lot of people were sending

[03:45] me photos being like it looks horrible, it looks terrible and like just flying off to handle.

[03:50] And I think people just expect me to just look at these photos and immediately

[03:55] Canadian is going to slam this game as being a complete joke and I told you so in all this.

[04:01] I don't even want to do that because I don't even think it's fair to look at this game in that

[04:06] environment. What I want to do is ask the common sense question is why did Stern's marketing

[04:12] department, why did Zach and everyone over there, what common sense are they implementing to bring

[04:18] this game to CES? They had to know it's going to look like washed out crap if they showed the game

[04:25] at CES. And so it leads to a lot of other questions like why didn't they construct how hard would it

[04:34] have been in the Stern booth? And I do marketing for a living, I do events for a living,

[04:39] you can do a pipe and drape sort of room, you can even make it within your own booth, you could

[04:44] probably create a little pitch black area you step into to play stranger things for the first time.

[04:52] And how cool would that have been if you walked up to the Stern booth and there is this pitch black

[04:58] sort of tent and drape area in which you can go through the curtain and immerse yourself

[05:05] in the stranger things, pinball experience. People will be like what's behind the curtain?

[05:10] We'll go back there and find out it's the new stranger things pinball machine.

[05:14] But no, no they decided to just put the game out on the floor. And yes it looks as terrible as

[05:19] people would think it would look. It looks very washed out. Those white strips on the ramps look

[05:25] horrendous though. It just doesn't look good. And I just I don't understand why they've decided

[05:32] to do it this way. And here's the other thing I just thought about. The Stern pinball isn't Chicago

[05:37] Illinois and they clearly have a pitch black environment. They have a dark environment at Stern's

[05:42] factory in which they can show this game. And I just have a real issue with again them taking

[05:49] money from people and not showing people the game. And what they easily could have done over the last

[05:54] couple weeks, right? What they easily could have done is they could have invited some pinball media.

[06:01] They could have got Jeff from this week in pinball. They could have got some other pinball

[06:04] podcasters. They could have got some personalities who have audiences in pinball. Why didn't Stern

[06:11] just invite them to Stern to play the game in a pitch black room so they could give feedback,

[06:18] objective feedback on the game. Now the hard thing is getting objective feedback from pinball

[06:24] people, especially pinball media is really hard because imagine this. Imagine if you do what I did.

[06:29] Imagine, well imagine if you go in and you play it and you don't think it's that impressive

[06:35] and you don't you don't rave about it. Well then Stern's never going to invite you back to do

[06:40] anything with them. And that's that's always the issue, right? Imagine if movie reviewers,

[06:45] when reviewing a movie, we're afraid to say how they really felt because they would they didn't

[06:50] want to get blacklisted by the movie studio, right? How how you know that's kind of where we are with

[06:56] pinball is most of the most of the people have a hard time telling it like it is because and I get it

[07:02] like it's really difficult because you don't want to lose access to these companies. But my

[07:06] hope thing is this game, you know, the way they're streaming it, it just lacks common sense. And

[07:11] it defies it defies logic to put a machine that would look really bad under direct bright light

[07:19] to put it at CES and expect people to walk away feeling good. And it's kind of comical because it

[07:25] does look terrible under that lighting. That doesn't mean in in in your house or in a barcade,

[07:30] it's going to look horrible, but it doesn't look great. This is not a great first impression of this

[07:35] mechanism or this this gimmick, right? But it's amazing to me even even looking this way,

[07:42] you go on the pin side and the people who are in on Ellie's and premiums are still making, you know,

[07:48] they're still like being a podologist about it. And that's just it's just this this phenomenon is

[07:55] when people buy a game before they've seen it. They make so many excuses to rationalize their

[08:00] decisions and all I want to do, I just want to hear from someone who plays this game in the right

[08:07] environment. I just want to hear what it's like. I'm not here to tell you it's going to be greater

[08:11] crappy. I think the verdict is still to it's it's it's not in yet. But what is in right now are

[08:18] people's deposits on the game and I just I just think it's a name that people are still like going

[08:23] all in on this without seeing how this thing's going to work. So I can tell you right now. If I put

[08:28] that thing in my my bedroom in New York City, I mean, it doesn't get really pitch black in here

[08:34] ever. So I don't even know if it would ever work in in an apartment like mine. And some of you out

[08:40] there like you have game rooms where your game rooms aren't pitch black. So I just I just want to see

[08:44] the way it works. I think bringing it to CES for the first time is kind of a joke. And the way they

[08:50] did the booth without making it dark is silly. And I think it's the worst way to show this technology

[08:57] off. And I think everyone agrees. I think everyone agrees. But it's just stern being stern. You

[09:02] know, they just like follow the same formula. There's nothing it's like it's it's see that's what kind

[09:06] of annoys me about stern. It's like it's like well, didn't anyone over there say hey like it's not

[09:11] going to look good. Are we sure we want to show this to people and look it's not just like

[09:15] through the internet. It's like if you're at the show and you're playing stranger things like a lot

[09:20] of people are coming through that booth like mass media. So gives moto and scene at an IGN all those

[09:27] outlets that wrote about the game all that tech media that's there. If they jump on this and their

[09:33] experience is underwhelming, is that good for stern is that good for pinball. Does that make pinball

[09:39] look like they know how to implement this new technology into pinball machines even though it's not

[09:43] new technology. You know what I'm saying? So I just don't understand what is the point of giving

[09:48] people an underwhelming experience with your brand new stranger things pinball machine lacks common

[09:56] sense. Doesn't it? All right. What else lacks common sense. I was thinking about this the other day.

[10:02] Where is the common sense over at Jersey Jack Pimball and by that let me let me explain what I mean.

[10:09] So Jack and company over there they make some of the best pinball machines they do. There's no

[10:16] denying it. They put more in their pinball machines than anyone else. Okay. But I've always said

[10:21] somewhere in the marketing room decisions are made at Jersey Jack Pimball that just completely lack

[10:26] common sense and that make you just go huh are we really going to do that. What if someone

[10:32] analyzes what we're doing is it going to make much sense. And so how do you how do you if you're

[10:39] Jersey Jack Pimball how do you through the lens of common sense how do you arrive at this decision.

[10:46] How do you say to people we are going to make 5,000 limited edition versions of Willy Wonka Pimball

[10:55] machine. Now that is not the issue I have. It's okay Jack can say whatever number of Llies he wants to

[11:01] make. Okay. So you're going to make 5,000 of them great great. I hope you sell everyone Jack I really

[11:07] do. Okay. So then who over there makes the marketing decision that for those 5,000 Llies that we

[11:15] plan to make. We are only going to make a topper limited to 300 units. How does that make sense.

[11:25] You're going to make you want to make thousands of Llies and then you make an L.A. topper that is

[11:30] meant for the L.A. machines because the C.E. guys all get their toppers so you're making a topper for

[11:35] L.A. guys and maybe the standard guys can buy it but you're only going to make 300. So what

[11:41] sense does that make. If you're going to sell a few thousand of these games and you know most of

[11:47] your people love toppers why would you only make 300 of the of the Wankatoni toppers. Can someone

[11:55] please email me at canadapimballadgmail.com and let me know how that makes sense. Now here's what I

[12:03] think happened in this again illogical move marketing move by J.J.P. and here's why it's illogical

[12:09] because why would you limit the amount of money you can make when your customers want they want

[12:14] toppers and they want that topper and you're not going to sell it to them now because you're only

[12:19] going to make 300 and here's what I think happened is this move really strangely came immediately after

[12:27] the Stern Star Wars topper was revealed. Remember I mean Stern is the first person ever to limit a

[12:35] topper to only 500 only 500 Star Wars toppers are available for 750 bucks and then like a few

[12:42] weeks later J.J.P. and balls like only 300 of the Wankatoni toppers will be available. I mean is this

[12:49] really like a pissing match of who can limit it the most hey Jack why don't you just make one topper

[12:55] we're just one available topper signed by everybody and their mother that's available I mean and

[13:00] it's $10,000 see if someone will bite I'm waiting for the day that happens I'm waiting for the day

[13:06] someone makes like a one of one topper for like 10 grand and it becomes like the sought after item

[13:12] but you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense Jack make just make them available you don't

[13:18] have to limit them you don't have to try to create arbitrary you know scarcity he did the same thing

[13:25] with the pirates of the care being collectives edition toppers which everyone would have wanted

[13:30] could have sold those for a thousand dollars each instead nope you know everyone else gets this

[13:37] crappy plexiglass one okay so it just lacks common sense you know applying common sense to Pimbal though

[13:44] it maybe it's a futile thing I'm trying to do on this episode because you know how do you watch

[13:49] people spend five thousand dollars on a piece of couch and and then you try to say well where's

[13:54] the common sense in that and you know for for a lot of what we look at in this hobby you know it comes

[14:00] down to some very basic things to me come you know the number one thing is if you make a theme people

[14:05] love it will sell like that's common sense you give the people what they want and they will appear

[14:11] at your door to buy the game there's a lack of common sense when you think that someone who's

[14:17] failed to deliver time and time again will all of a sudden succeed if you throw money at the problem

[14:26] I mean we've seen this before in so many different Pimbal entities where is the common sense people

[14:32] you know how many second third fourth fifth chances do we give people to get things right in Pimbal

[14:39] I would argue that common sense says if you want there to be goodwill in your company you might want

[14:44] to steer clear of the personalities that have burned people in the past that common sense says you

[14:51] wouldn't launch a Pimbal company with a John Papaduke like common sense why would you start with

[14:58] two strikes and and it's is the bottom of the ninth and and people have been burned by this guy

[15:04] you know common sense just start with a new designer common sense goes a long way right common

[15:10] sense says don't don't don't be angry at the Pimbal community if you want to sell games to them

[15:17] right common sense says that everyone on Pinside is a potential customer so avoiding those people

[15:25] treating them like their second-class citizens and throwing shade on them is not the best

[15:31] thing to do if you're a Pimbal company and yet so many Pimbal companies avoid the community

[15:38] they want nothing to do with that the the hardcore center of the community and and I'm here to tell you

[15:46] if I was a Pimbal company I would find a way to work with those people and I don't think it's

[15:52] hard we see Chuck do it we see other people do it you know it leads to this mentality common sense

[16:00] if you're a business like Pimbal it leads to this mentality that we're better than our customers

[16:05] that we know more than them that we're smarter than them and maybe you can't blame some of these

[16:10] companies like Stern that could absolutely give two crops about engaging with people on the

[16:14] forums and I get it man sometimes you go on to Pinside and you read some of this stuff

[16:20] like you read the witch hunt to find out where deep roots money is coming from I just read on Pinside

[16:28] a guy a guy his name's dealt I think it's dealt 31 he just changed his mind about Willy Wonka

[16:35] he just changed his mind and was like you know what I got it and I'm actually really enjoying it

[16:40] more than I did at the beginning and he had slammed the game at the beginning and you know what's

[16:44] happening to him on Pinside this is a hysterical he's getting attacked by the Willy Wonka loyalist

[16:50] like he's not allowed to now like the game he has to explain to them in in in supreme detail

[16:58] what exactly about it he now notices differently like it's like he has to justify to these people

[17:05] why he now likes the game what what it's so hilarious you should go read that thread it's incredible

[17:11] to me I'm like wow so the the the JJP like loyalist all they do is cheerlead how these games are the best

[17:18] games of all time and then if you come to that realization later on in your journey with the game

[17:24] that's not good enough for them you have to you have to you know testify under oath to these

[17:29] individuals if you're allowed to be part of them get the F ad here it's a freaking pinball machine

[17:33] all right it's not some secret society colluminati that controls the world you know common sense would

[17:41] also have you believe that you don't release a game called October fest in July can we like that

[17:48] that could be the ultimate what the F where was the common sense moment in that so we're going to

[17:53] make a game called October fest okay cool when's the game going to be on the line June okay okay

[18:00] does anyone here have a problem with that because I that doesn't seem like the right thing to do maybe

[18:05] can we get we have to ship the game by October no wouldn't make more sense to have October fest

[18:11] it would have to be on the line in august so that we're shipping the game to places by October

[18:17] you know no no let's reveal the game in October let people wait six months and then by the time

[18:22] the game actually is being built nobody cares common sense people come on common sense also says

[18:30] you know one of the biggest common sense issues is playing a game before you buy it and this is

[18:36] something that impacts a lot of people and it's crazy right it's like we don't even take these

[18:41] expensive toys on test drives we just go all in on them and everyone who's all in on rick and

[18:48] morty you haven't played it nope common sense says what are you doing but remember common sense number

[18:56] one if it's a theme people love if it's a theme people love they will buy it that is always the

[19:02] biggest common senseical thing when you're making a pinball machine that almost overrides all the

[19:07] other decisions we made right because think about like this if someone made your dream theme and

[19:13] they made a super duper limited edition for twenty five thousand dollars and it had just something I

[19:19] don't know let's just say it was transformers generation one and in it were custom call outs from

[19:25] Peter Cullen you know the the voice of Optimus Prime right I think I got that right

[19:31] imagine if he did custom call outs for that twenty thousand dollar version of the game he's like

[19:35] grish you know transform and roll out like people would be like I gotta get it like so

[19:41] when you're in love with something and then it doesn't matter like you if people I mean I guess

[19:47] people love Elvira that much but it's weird to me because I will say this some of the people

[19:52] that I talked to you who bought Elvira signature editions they're not even like huge Elvira fans

[19:59] they just want the rare thing and that is what drove them to do it it's it's not like these are

[20:05] people with Elvira you know shrines to Elvira in their house they just they just wanted something

[20:11] that not many people would have okay so common sense the other common sense thing that I often

[20:17] think about with pinball is aligning the best talent with the best opportunity and when you think

[20:25] about it in my industry when we win a big piece of business they usually put the best people

[20:32] on the biggest pieces of business because it makes sense right common sense you want to you want

[20:38] to do your best work for the biggest potential for sales and revenue and then I look at pinball

[20:45] and sometimes I'm like wow they they take these really big themes and then they don't always put

[20:51] the best people on those themes so I think there's also like a lack of common is that a lack of

[20:57] common sense or is that just a scheduling thing I'm not really sure but common sense to me would be

[21:02] like the one guy who is the greatest at organizing clips and and getting games coded is lineman so

[21:12] common sense like why wouldn't lineman sheets you have two games that are close to each other in

[21:18] the schedule you have Elvira and you have stranger things why is it common sense says to me that

[21:25] if lineman sheets is going to code a game I want them to code stranger things versus Elvira like you

[21:32] have him coding in obscure in obscure theme that's very niche versus like this juggernaut theme and

[21:41] if you've seen what lineman has done with the clips from Batman and you have full assets to all the

[21:46] clips from stranger things I just think common sense would have had you connect those two together

[21:54] that lineman should have been doing the brine-eddy game and stranger things I mean come on come on

[22:00] common sense make it doesn't matter though right it doesn't matter it's just it's never going to

[22:05] happen that way we are never going to get lineman on on a triple a title it feels like I just feel

[22:10] like he gets to do whatever he wants now maybe that's what common sense is like maybe you deserve

[22:16] to call your own shots when you're a guy like that right anything going else on the pinball hobby

[22:21] a few little common sense things right common sense would say that games should ship with their

[22:26] toppers that there shouldn't be a a a huge period between the game coming out and the accessories

[22:33] for the game I guess that's a better thing to talk about is just all of the games accessories

[22:38] should be available at launch common sense right you should not make people wait months to get

[22:46] other elements they can add to their game now companies are getting smarter you know who's

[22:51] starting to get to see these games early are the different mod people like the mod couple and

[22:56] other mod mezzo mods mezzo mods they a lot of the mod people are starting to get early access to

[23:02] games and it makes sense so that they can make their mods available at launch so they've had a few

[23:08] months to see what the playfields are like to see what the game has in it and to see what they can

[23:13] add to it and get ready for the launch of the game all right so what else is going on in pinball so if

[23:19] I think we're done with our common sense sort of Monday morning a discussion if you haven't read

[23:25] this week in pinball today I would read it there is a phenomenal article by Dennis Kreisel about

[23:32] Italian bottom playfields in pinball and it goes throughout the history of what we mean when we say

[23:38] the Italian bottom and now we're not talking about you know my high school girlfriend we're talking

[23:43] about pinball here and it's great and it's great let's do this let's I haven't done this in a while

[23:49] I haven't read people's emails on canators pinball podcasts in a while so I'm going to do that right

[23:54] now I'm going to pull up my email and just see what you guys have been saying to canado over the past

[24:00] like few weeks and if you want to email me anything email me a canada pinball at gmail.com

[24:07] before I do that I just want to say that something I didn't discuss that I put up

[24:13] on my Facebook page that got a ton of engagement where pictures of the stranger things playfield

[24:20] and how dimpled how badly dimpled and cratered I think there's a difference right between a

[24:25] dimple and a crater this these are craters how badly cratered the machines are after just one

[24:32] week of play and I want to just say that those of you out there who think this is normal who think

[24:40] this is normal pinball quality who point to that BS video by Steve Richie where he tries to make

[24:46] apologies for this saying it's not apologies he tries to like say this is this is just pinball

[24:51] it's always been this way and they're just going to flatten out over time I just want to say if you

[24:57] believe that if you believe that this is normal if you believe that this is not cheaper would

[25:03] cheaper clear coding process stern having so much demand for games that they're rushing these

[25:09] things out and the quality isn't inferior now if you believe that this is just the way pinball

[25:16] games are supposed to look after one week I think you need your head examined I would be very

[25:23] nervous to buy these games I just the quality is not there imagine what these games are going to look

[25:28] like in a in a month in a year and I just don't understand this the games did not look like this

[25:35] crappy the no way I had a lot of the rings and it had just a few dimples a few these games after like

[25:42] one week dimpled there let's just call them craters because I think we call these things craters

[25:49] it actually sounds more serious and is more indicative of what's going on with these games they

[25:54] look horrible these these playfields look like golf balls after like a month and it's not normal

[26:02] and I don't care what anyone says like it's just not normal like quality is not there

[26:07] if there's one thing Robert Mueller can do if you can if you can make a playfield that has zero

[26:11] dimples or craters he's going to get a lot of people's attention I think if you can get the theme

[26:16] right all right let's see do do do do okay I got an email from Kevin and it says your stranger

[26:24] things review Kevin Clements he said hey Chris spot on review of stranger things I have yet to play

[26:31] but you did a great job articulating what is missing unfortunately with everyone in the hobby

[26:37] adopting the buy buy buy mentality I don't think we will ever see the level of magic under glass

[26:44] that could and should be there imagine if folks actually listen to you and stop the green

[26:50] to overpay for these stern machines over time you know they would have to step up their game

[26:55] how many of our collective dream themes are we going to let them piss all over well Kevin

[27:02] thank you for the note I'm glad you enjoyed my stranger things review you know look I don't know

[27:09] what the answer is man I don't think people are gonna stop buying I don't think people demand a lot

[27:16] for what they get in this hobby at all I think people are driven by their passion and love for

[27:22] pinball and I think a lot of people just don't care and look here's a thing I think most people who

[27:29] buy stern machines and jersey jack me I they're not on pin side they're they just want a toy to have

[27:35] fun with that's it that's it that's all they want right like look at the one up arcade you do you

[27:41] guys see that the one up arcade as pinball coming out star wars pinball you know people buy those

[27:46] things if you go on the clove and the arcade enthusiasts they look at those one up things like

[27:52] they're the stupidest things ever like they're bastardizing what an arcade machine is yet that

[27:55] company is selling millions and millions and millions of dollars worth of those things they're

[28:01] actually putting more of the arcade experience in people's homes you know people don't really care

[28:07] they just want the toy and I think that's what's happening with pinball it's like people just see

[28:12] stranger things they see star wars they see ghost busters they see Batman you know they see a theme

[28:18] that they love gardens of the galaxy Deadpool and they go buy it and they enjoy it and they're

[28:23] not going to run to pin side and cry about craters and this and that and shooter lane wear and all

[28:28] the stuff that we all complain about now for nine thousand dollars these things should be packed

[28:33] and they're not and if you buy a stranger things which I think is I think stranger things is

[28:38] as barren as the black knight is if you buy this game I think you once again send a message that

[28:45] you're willing to accept very little in a modern pinball machine at these prices and that's just

[28:51] my opinion though if you feel differently that's cool all right Dave Dave actually said Dave

[28:57] but see actually sent me an email about the one up star wars arcade machine or pinball machine

[29:03] that's coming out thank you Dave for sharing that I got an email from Ben Crane to Chris I mostly

[29:10] agree with you on your criticisms of the twippy I think Jurassic Park will walk away with best game

[29:17] the best podcast is a little more interesting but you should easily win it I don't know about that

[29:23] there's a lot of shows Ben he goes on to say if for no other reason than being the one i'd man

[29:30] in the land of the blind a lot of these categories like best new uh comeer best league best location

[29:37] best competitive player seem to have a little meaning I disagree um with you that stranger things

[29:43] should have been included as very few people have played it and the premium le version has yet

[29:49] to be revealed this is a problem with rating these games in general is that they are often released

[29:56] with early code production is very limited or new and better versions are released later making

[30:01] them difficult to assess the year they are released some seem to think it is fair to rate them when

[30:07] they are released as a way of punishing manufacturers for releasing early code or not being able to

[30:13] ship in volume such an assessment tends to reward mediocre games that ship near complete erosmith

[30:20] while not giving fair consideration to games that improve significantly even years after release

[30:26] Batman 66 maybe a more meaningful comparison would be to compare games that are currently

[30:32] available new in box since this essentially um is essentially the decision consumers are making

[30:39] yeah i mean like there's there's no easy way to know when is the right time to review a pinball

[30:45] machine and when it comes to the end of the year awards i mean i get it i get it that stranger things

[30:52] i think a compromise could have been i think they've could have included stranger things in just theme

[30:58] because just them alone why could you not vote for stranger things within that category because

[31:04] it's out now next year you can include it in the other categories i think but here's the two

[31:11] categories that i think stranger things should have been in theme and artwork because none of that's

[31:16] changing now you can maybe argue people haven't seen the game in person but it's artwork i'll tell

[31:21] you this the high res photos stern has of the game that are online that's better than the games

[31:27] ever going to look in front of you ever they they they totally like change the saturation on it to

[31:32] make it pop more than it does in real life all right let's keep going here uh matt said matt said

[31:39] hey canada just want to let you know you got my vote for the twitties this year the show is always

[31:43] entertaining and the issues you bring up with modern pinball are usually dead on i guess some people

[31:48] think you're too negative for the industry but i've never felt like you're being negative for the

[31:53] sake of being negative you might be in trouble next year if zack stops playing that awful screaming

[32:00] sound bite and yelling into his mic every time he introduces a new segment i literally laughed out

[32:07] loud when i saw him listed as rookie of the year for being a distributor i like him a lot and

[32:13] things straight down the middle is great but give me a break man all right matt well first of all thank

[32:17] you so much for your twippy vote and you know look zack zack zack zack man i mean there's a reason why

[32:25] is that has a big following too i mean i i think there's a lot of personalities in this hobby and

[32:30] and you know people people do their shows their ways and i think it's great i actually i it would be

[32:37] boring if we all tried to sort of copycat each other um and you know this show just we do it this way

[32:44] and other shows do it other ways other shows have co-hosts other shows go maybe a little bit longer

[32:48] other shows have segments that are repetitive or they you know repeat them over and over again

[32:54] we just we just do what we do we talk about pinball and we move on all right well matt thank you for

[32:59] the vote what else do i get here uh 1970 pinball projector so there was a pinball projector apparently

[33:06] in a game called sexy girl from 1980 i have not seen or played that game i have to take a look and see

[33:14] what sexy girls all about all right so so Brian L the title is stern equals daddy eased

[33:21] Sega quality hey Chris i think we all forget stern's roots the daddy eased and Sega they were

[33:28] C pins of the 90s fun to play at times but not magical like bali Williams can you imagine if

[33:35] daddy easter Sega made Adam's family or star trek next generation back in the day look at the

[33:41] Star Wars pin they made in 1992 is any shocker the history repeated itself in 2017 stern struck

[33:49] lightning choice with lord of the rings and simpsons pinball party wish that could have continued

[33:55] effectively we have daddy eased Sega making our dream themes happy new year well look Brian I mean

[34:03] these games have definitely improved over that but you're but he is he has a point he has a point

[34:09] that you know stern has just become bigger and and honestly better than they were back then

[34:16] but who amongst you out there who listens to this show that can look at me with a straight face

[34:23] and tell me what modern stern game have we had in the last five years five years right that is

[34:31] giving us as much as lord of the rings and simpsons pinball party so i will happily i would happily

[34:38] like to know what you think has as much as those games had in it okay and it's just like

[34:44] you're not going to find anything and again i just i think the investors are running the ship and

[34:50] that's okay like i get it like i see people saying like they have to make money cool

[34:54] but they're charging so much for these games and the bomb is really low and i don't know i'm not

[34:59] here to just champion this company staying in business while we get things that just aren't as

[35:04] good as they could be and we all know they could be better than what we're getting all right

[35:09] and i'm gonna stop there i gotta i gotta get to work everyone everyone i hope you have a great

[35:15] 2020 what is coming up in pinball we all want to see what rickian morty is like no one's seen the game

[35:21] yet someone went over to spooky to play their alis kupers nightmare castle and played rickian

[35:26] morty and said it was great do you trust someone who was like already probably in on one or maybe

[35:32] he's not in on one but i think he just played one i don't know we're gonna we're gonna find out

[35:36] soon enough uh as i said i don't really want to play it i want to be surprised by this game

[35:42] i think it's the kind of game with with the jokes and the humor you're gonna want to experience it

[35:46] for the first time without watching it on the internet and i and i and i really do i think that's

[35:51] the way to enjoy this game so everyone common sense probably something that we throw out the window

[35:57] i mean who has common sense when you wake up one day and you're like hey honey i got a good way

[36:02] to spend that nine thousand dollars and she's like what are we gonna do like we're gonna take a great

[36:06] vacation we're gonna remember for the rest of our lives we're gonna invest that money we're gonna

[36:10] put that in our kids college fun no honey we're gonna go buy a nine thousand dollar stranger things

[36:16] pinball machine that only cost three thousand dollars to bake and i'm not even sure if the projector

[36:23] works but let's just go buy it and see if we like it when it arrives in our home because they won't

[36:28] show us if it works before we hand them a check for nine thousand dollars isn't that a great

[36:33] common sense a good thing to do everyone have a great day this is a canadus pinball podcast episode
