[00:00] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast, your favorite pinball podcaster that

[00:23] complains about prices every single day.

[00:27] It is going to be funny though as we see all of these distributors get really desperate

[00:32] with Venom.

[00:33] I mean I'm seeing all of these for sale ads and you know and I know that this game is

[00:38] not flying off the shelves at these prices but that's not what I want to talk about.

[00:42] We know about Venom, we've seen the game, we've seen it streamed, you know where to

[00:46] get it, I mean gosh we know where to get it.

[00:48] You distributors we know you're selling Venom but it's six months left in the year.

[00:54] We're halfway through the pinball year and I want to ask a very simple question on this

[00:59] episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:01] I want to ask do we think there's going to be a dark horse between now and the end of

[01:06] the year that's going to surprise us in the world of pinball and what might it be?

[01:12] We've already seen pretty much three games from Stern Pinball from like the end of last

[01:16] year until now.

[01:17] We've seen James Bond, we've seen Foo Fighters and now we've seen Venom.

[01:21] Do we think anything is going to come from Stern that is going to surprise us before

[01:25] the year is up?

[01:26] Now look here's the deal with Stern.

[01:28] Stern is moving into its new factory in August and then we're going to get Venom rolling

[01:33] out the door in September, October and then we're going to get to that period at the end

[01:38] of the year.

[01:39] Remember they revealed this game in July so do we really think Stern is going to have

[01:44] no more surprises up its sleeve before the year is up?

[01:48] So here's what I think is going to happen.

[01:50] I think Stern is going to come with a vault edition game sometime at the end of the year.

[01:56] Now look George Gomez recently said they might remake more stranger things games so the rumors

[02:02] are like all over the place when it comes to what would the vault be?

[02:06] Which game do you think they would bring back?

[02:08] Now it's got to be a game that they can charge these high prices for because they're not

[02:12] going to vault a game and charge less than what these games are going for right now.

[02:17] Now there are a lot of rumors swirling around with this Stern vault.

[02:21] Will it be the Dark Horse?

[02:23] Now there's three games that would be really interesting to vault and that is Tron, Metallica

[02:29] and Ghostbusters.

[02:30] I've been hearing more and more rumors about a Metallica game.

[02:33] Now if you listen to one of my previous shows like earlier in the year I heard a strong

[02:38] rumor that Metallica toured the factory and they saw the new Stern LCD Spike II games.

[02:45] Are we going to see an all new Metallica game that's going to be on Stern's new Spike III

[02:50] system?

[02:52] Will that be the case?

[02:53] Are we going to see another Ghostbusters?

[02:55] I don't think it's going to be Ghostbusters as I've said before.

[02:58] I don't think they're going to remake a Jon Trudeau game after everything that happened

[03:02] because now they know what Jon Trudeau did.

[03:04] They didn't know that before they released Ghostbusters.

[03:07] But the other one that everybody wants is Tron as well right?

[03:10] Everyone's been waiting for a Tron.

[03:12] Do the good old days when Tron LE was like 5700 bucks?

[03:16] How much could Stern charge for a Tron LE Vault Edition with all new artwork?

[03:21] Are we thinking $15,000?

[03:23] $20,000?

[03:24] Who knows right?

[03:26] I don't know.

[03:27] Is it going to be Tron?

[03:28] We haven't seen Stern ever remake a DMD era game and put it into an LCD format.

[03:35] Are we going to see them finally do that?

[03:37] I think all of that's not going to happen.

[03:40] If I were to be a betting man looking at the way Stern's going these days, they're not

[03:44] going to do something difficult.

[03:46] We've shown them that they don't have to do a lot to get our money.

[03:49] They don't have to do a lot to get new orders.

[03:52] All they have to do is remake a game that they know there's new demand for and they will

[03:56] make money.

[03:58] That leads me to believe if Stern is going to remake a game in November, December, it

[04:03] is most likely going to be stranger things or they're going to do another run of Jurassic

[04:08] Park.

[04:09] They're going to do an existing LCD game and I think they're going to bring it out.

[04:13] Here's what's going to be interesting and I do not think this is going to be the Dark

[04:16] Horse surprise.

[04:18] I think what's going to be tricky if Stern brings back one of those two titles is what

[04:22] they charge for it because we all remember what we paid for those games.

[04:28] This is where it gets difficult because, remember, stranger things, LE was $9,000.

[04:33] Wouldn't it be difficult for Stern to remake it knowing that it was $9,000 and then charge

[04:39] $13,000 plus for it?

[04:42] We have to accept these new games at these new prices because you were never able to

[04:46] get a Venom for less than $13,000.

[04:50] You were never able to get a Rush LE for less than $12,000.

[04:54] You were never able to get a Foo Fighters for less than $13,000.

[04:58] If they go back and remake a game, remember what happened when Spooky Pinball re-released

[05:03] TNA and it was $9,000?

[05:06] The reason why it didn't sell well.

[05:09] Stern still had the memory that that game was once $6,000.

[05:14] We know there's a lot of newbies in this hobby that will buy anything, but will there be

[05:18] enough and will it work?

[05:21] But I think we're going to see Jurassic Park Anniversary Edition or another run of Stranger

[05:25] Things, but I don't consider that a Dark Horse.

[05:28] Alright, who's next?

[05:30] Spooky Pinball.

[05:31] Any Dark Horse coming from Spooky?

[05:33] Nope.

[05:34] They have to make all of these freaking Scooby-Doo's.

[05:37] Right now they're probably somewhere around 6 or 700 Scooby-Doo's made, which is great.

[05:43] We really don't congratulate Spooky Pinball enough on just getting it done.

[05:47] I mean think about it, this small boutique company in Benton, Wisconsin has just made

[05:52] like 6 or 700 games in less than a year and we're not even celebrating them.

[05:59] That's more games than Haggis combined with Multimorphic combined with Dutch Pinball.

[06:05] You could put all of the tiny boutiques together and Spooky Pinball makes way more games than

[06:11] them, but it's been quiet over at Spooky because they're getting it done.

[06:15] Now look, does everybody wish they waited on ordering a Scooby-Doo because you can go

[06:19] get one this weekend?

[06:20] If you're at the end of that line, you have to be somewhat sane yourself.

[06:25] You're never going to do this again.

[06:27] But we are definitely not going to see another Spooky Pinball machine before the year is

[06:32] up.

[06:33] They just have too many Scooby-Doo's to build.

[06:35] That leads us to the next company.

[06:37] Will the Dark Horse come from Jersey Jack Pinball?

[06:40] Now look, if there is any company that needs a Dark Horse hit this year, it is Jersey Jack

[06:47] Pinball.

[06:48] We know it's Elton John.

[06:49] I was talking to someone who said he was looking at the artwork.

[06:52] Christopher Franci is most likely going to be the artist on this Elton John game.

[06:57] Now Godfather sales, we know they are not great, but the other thing is this.

[07:02] Jersey Jack Pinball doesn't make games at the rate of Stern Pinball.

[07:07] So it's going to take them like three months or more to make 1,000 collector's editions

[07:13] of the Godfather.

[07:15] So that means their manufacturing line is going to open up again come November.

[07:20] We all know nobody is ordering more Godfather LEs.

[07:23] There are no Godfather LE orders.

[07:26] You know how I know this?

[07:27] Because they're sitting new in box at distributors.

[07:30] If somebody wanted one, they could go get one tomorrow.

[07:34] So that means those orders are done.

[07:37] So after the CEs are made, there is zero demand for the Godfather.

[07:41] So do we think Elton John can be a Dark Horse for Jersey Jack Pinball?

[07:46] And I mean it when I say it, ladies and gentlemen.

[07:48] I think we're sort of writing this game off way too fast.

[07:52] And I know what you're thinking.

[07:54] That grown men don't want Elton John.

[07:56] 40 to 60 year old men don't want to put that music into their game rooms.

[08:00] And I think people are kind of wrong.

[08:03] Elton John music is super popular.

[08:06] Like his songs and his hits have more popularity than a lot of other musical acts that have

[08:12] had successful pinball machines.

[08:14] It just begs the question.

[08:16] Why do we keep thinking that nobody wants an Elton John pinball machine?

[08:22] I think the man has sold like over 200 million albums.

[08:26] I mean one of his albums I think has sold more than probably all of the Foo Fighter

[08:31] albums combined.

[08:33] And yet we're writing it off.

[08:35] Why are we writing it off?

[08:37] The songs are high energy.

[08:39] Crocodile Rock.

[08:40] I'm still standing.

[08:41] Benny and the Jets.

[08:44] Rocket Man.

[08:45] Goodbye Yellowbeck Road.

[08:47] Don't go breaking my heart.

[08:48] I mean don't go breaking my heart.

[08:50] A lot of hit songs here, right?

[08:52] So we're saying that this game is just not going to be successful.

[08:55] Three strikes throughout.

[08:56] I don't know we were all writing off Foo Fighters before Foo Fighters came out.

[09:00] Now that being said, Jack Danger made a super cool game.

[09:04] Zombie Eddie made it look awesome.

[09:06] Foo Fighters is more like Save the Earth from Aliens game featuring Foo Fighters music.

[09:12] There's a lot I'm worried about with this game.

[09:14] I'm worried about Steve Ritchie.

[09:15] I'm worried about the theme.

[09:17] I'm worried about it all just as much as all of you are.

[09:20] But I will say this.

[09:22] If this episode is who do we think can come out with a Dark Horse game this year that

[09:27] is going to surprise everybody and blow them away, it's not going to be Stern, right?

[09:32] We know what Stern has in the hopper this year.

[09:35] It's not going to be spooky.

[09:37] I think Jersey Jack Pinball might have a Dark Horse hit with this game.

[09:42] They need a Dark Horse hit with this game and they need to get past the Godfather.

[09:48] Look, I think this is Steve Ritchie's final moment.

[09:51] I mean, he moved over from Stern.

[09:53] He moved over to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:55] There was a promise that his bomb was going to be increased.

[09:58] He was going to be able to make the game that he wanted to make.

[10:01] And so, yes, if this episode is who's capable of a Dark Horse in 2023, I think Jersey Jack

[10:08] Pinball is on that short list of a company that could come out with a Dark Horse game.

[10:14] And if they get it wrong, you know I will be the first one to be like three strikes.

[10:18] You're out, Jersey Jack.

[10:19] You need to go back to the drawing board.

[10:22] All right, let's go on to Chicago Gaming Company.

[10:24] Is there any Dark Horse hope from this company?

[10:27] They've still got to make all these cactus canyons.

[10:29] Have you noticed like nobody talks about cactus canyon remake?

[10:33] There's no hype.

[10:34] There's no excitement.

[10:35] Again, if you took my advice and you wait and see, you can march in and go get an Ellie

[10:39] now for absolutely no drama, no weight, no fanfare.

[10:44] I think Ellie's are going for like $10,200.

[10:48] They're only making like $500 of a little bit more on the flip.

[10:51] It wasn't worth it.

[10:52] This game was rolled out, it feels like 15 years ago.

[10:56] And now that they're making them, it's just not that exciting.

[11:00] And we all know why this game's not that exciting right now is because the code.

[11:04] We all thought this game was going to have this updated code.

[11:08] Lyman was going to work on it.

[11:09] It's been over two years since they revealed this game.

[11:13] And there's still no finish line on when this like updated code is going to be available

[11:18] for the game.

[11:19] I mean, I don't know what's going on.

[11:21] Hire some coders, CGC.

[11:24] So they got to make all those cactus canyons and then they have to move on to Pulp Fiction.

[11:28] And we already know that Pulp Fiction Ellie, which is the one everyone's waiting for, is

[11:31] not going to hit the line until 2024.

[11:34] And so it was revealed very early, right?

[11:37] March of 2023.

[11:38] So there's absolutely nothing else that this company can put on the line.

[11:43] So there will not be a Dark Horse game coming from Chicago Gaming Company.

[11:47] All right, let's go over to American Pimble.

[11:49] Do we think American Pimble might have a Dark Horse up its sleeve?

[11:53] Do we think Ryan McQuade's game might be after Galactic Tank Force and we might actually

[11:58] see it this year?

[12:00] I don't think so.

[12:01] This is another company where they have never revealed two games in one year.

[12:06] And so if they just released Galactic Tank Force in March, there's going to be no surprise

[12:11] coming from American Pimble.

[12:14] Here's what I'm curious about with this company is how are they going to make Galactic Tank

[12:17] Forces for the next six or seven months if the orders aren't there?

[12:22] Maybe they have the orders.

[12:24] They really are trickling these games out.

[12:27] But I have a hard time believing that six months of the line going are going to go to

[12:32] making orders for this game.

[12:35] They're probably going to make more Houdinis and Oktoberfest and put them in the standard

[12:39] cabinet, which is a smart move.

[12:41] If they were really smart, listen to me, American Pimble, they would take the Matt Andrews artwork

[12:47] from Houdini and they would put it onto their Houdini game and they would make it look so

[12:53] much better than the existing Houdini game.

[12:56] It's too dark.

[12:57] It's not very colorful.

[12:58] It's not as inviting as that Matt Andrews artwork.

[13:01] Now that would be an interesting Dark Horse to re-release Houdini with amazing artwork

[13:06] that was art directed by J-Pop, but they will not do it.

[13:11] What does Canada know about breathing new life into a title that doesn't have any more

[13:15] demand?

[13:16] Alright, so nothing from American Pimble.

[13:18] It's starting to look bleak, ladies and gentlemen.

[13:20] We have six months to go in Pimble and all of these companies and we feel like there's

[13:25] no chance for surprises.

[13:27] Is this mean like Pimble content is going to dry up on us?

[13:31] Are we going to be talking about Venom Code for the next four months?

[13:34] What's going on?

[13:35] Alright, the next company on my list is P3 Multimorphic.

[13:38] Is Jerry going to release a Dark Horse game?

[13:41] Jerry might actually release a game called Dark Horse.

[13:44] That's just some homebrew game, but we know that Jerry is like a year behind on his orders

[13:49] already and he needs to make all of those weird Al games and then he needs to make the

[13:54] Scott Denisi Final Resistance game.

[13:56] So this is another company where I don't know if we're going to see anything new.

[14:01] It absolutely makes no sense for Jerry to announce or reveal another modular game when

[14:07] he's got all of these back orders to fulfill.

[14:10] So I don't think we see anything Dark Horse.

[14:12] And by the way, when I say Dark Horse, I mean something that's going to like take over our

[14:17] imaginations and like become something like impressive.

[14:21] I don't just mean like any reveal.

[14:23] Like yes, I absolutely expect a few more space hunts to pop up in the world or punny factories,

[14:29] but we all know nobody here is ordering like sushi expressed from like pinball adventures.

[14:34] All right, so that's P3 Multimorphic, nothing.

[14:37] Then we go to the pinball brothers.

[14:39] Now look, the pinball brothers are making Queen right now, but this is another company

[14:44] that is capable of a Dark Horse release because they are planning to release their next game

[14:51] after Queen at Chicago Expo in October.

[14:56] Now I think they'll reveal a game there, but I don't think manufacturing will begin

[15:01] this year, but that being said, this is a company that has turned a corner.

[15:06] We know they know how to manufacture.

[15:09] Their quality is it's good, it's good, it's not that bad.

[15:13] And I think everybody has been itching for a game from this company that wasn't originated

[15:19] by the mind of Andrew Highway.

[15:22] They have made two of Andrew Highway's games.

[15:25] We now will get pinball brothers first game that is completely separated from the highway

[15:32] pinball ideas.

[15:34] And so these guys know the industry.

[15:36] They know the hobby.

[15:38] They know what sells.

[15:39] They know what people want.

[15:41] Now knowing what people want and then giving people what they want doesn't always happen

[15:45] in this hobby.

[15:46] It usually doesn't happen that often.

[15:48] Will the pinball brothers come out with a Dark Horse game that is going to impress us?

[15:53] Now look, much like Jersey Jack pinball, we have to keep the pinball brothers on our

[15:59] shortlist of companies that could come out with a Dark Horse game this year.

[16:06] Do I think they're going to do it?

[16:08] There's just something about the pinball brothers.

[16:12] Maybe it's the fact that they're not actually brothers, but there's just something about

[16:16] who's designing their games that has me nervous.

[16:20] Like who is their designer?

[16:22] I worry that if they come out with something, it's just going to be more of like a space

[16:27] hunt kind of design game and not something competitive with what people like Stern and

[16:33] Jersey Jack are bringing to the table.

[16:35] All right, let's go on the Dutch pinball.

[16:38] Does Dutch pinball have a Dark Horse up its sleeve?

[16:41] Nope.

[16:42] We know they're going to be making the Big Lebowski all this year and into all of next

[16:46] year.

[16:47] The earliest we're hearing that Dutch pinball is going to reveal its next title is going

[16:52] to be somewhere around fall of 2024.

[16:56] So Barry, we're happy you're making the Big Lebowski's.

[16:59] We hope you make all the EA's whole, but no new game from Dutch pinball this year.

[17:04] All right, what about home pin?

[17:06] What about home pin?

[17:08] What about home pin?

[17:09] I'm just going to say it three times.

[17:11] I'm not going to say anything else.

[17:13] We know home pin with a hundred percent certainty will not come out with a Dark Horse hit this

[17:20] year.

[17:21] I'd just be surprised if Spinal Tap actually gets made and makes its way to customers.

[17:26] So stick a fork in home pin sales.

[17:28] All right, how is pinball?

[17:29] Will they have a Dark Horse this year?

[17:31] Well, they already announced their plans for the next game.

[17:34] We saw all the Centaur plans.

[17:36] They've got to spend the rest of this year making the fathoms.

[17:39] Canada has bet 600 euros that they will not finish their fathom builds by the end of the

[17:46] year.

[17:47] So maybe that's the Dark Horse for Haggis.

[17:50] You know, we know Marty is working on War of the Worlds pinball.

[17:53] Every time I say it, he's probably annoyed, but I'm really nervous about an original War

[17:59] of the Worlds game designed by Marty Robbins.

[18:02] Will that work in a world in which we're going to get Keith Elwyn Jaws and Back to the Future

[18:07] and The Matrix?

[18:09] I can't wait.

[18:10] I hope they can survive long enough so we can see that game.

[18:14] Nothing from Haggis.

[18:15] Nothing from Pinball Adventures is going to be a Dark Horse.

[18:19] So are there any other Dark Horse companies left?

[18:23] What about Circus Maximus?

[18:26] What about that Kingpin game they were supposed to make like 18 years ago?

[18:30] Remember when they saw those Translight Preorders and then they went Radio Silent?

[18:34] Where have these guys been?

[18:36] So is Circus Maximus going to come out with Kingpin finally?

[18:40] I don't know.

[18:41] I don't think we're going to see it.

[18:42] What about this Turner pinball guy?

[18:44] The guy who bought all the Deeproot games?

[18:48] You know, the guy that's got his own pinball company making like Ninja Eclipse?

[18:52] Is he going to finally reveal something?

[18:55] If I could give him any advice, it would simply be this.

[18:59] Stop making that Ninja Eclipse game right now.

[19:04] Nobody's buying it.

[19:06] You might as well find a way to make the damn Razas.

[19:09] I mean, even with everything that's gone down in this hobby, there are still people

[19:14] that would buy Razas.

[19:16] You could still sell a hundred Razas if you could freaking make them.

[19:20] And the game's been designed and we know Bobby Mueller spent like $2 million coding the damn

[19:26] thing with those animations.

[19:28] Why would you start over with this freaking Ninja Eclipse game?

[19:33] I don't understand it.

[19:35] It doesn't make any sense.

[19:37] But from the looks of things over there, it's another pinball company with like three people

[19:40] staring at a laptop.

[19:42] Like that's not going to work.

[19:44] So nothing from Turner pinball.

[19:45] All right.

[19:46] So what about the remakes?

[19:48] Right?

[19:49] What about the rumors that there's going to be another Twilight Zone, another Big Bang

[19:54] bar?

[19:55] What about those rumors?

[19:57] We know Rick over at Planetary is partnered with Pedretti Gaming.

[20:01] Do we think out of left field?

[20:03] There will be a remake that just appears on the pinball scene sometime in 2023.

[20:10] You know, it's not a bad time to do it.

[20:12] I mean, this fall would be the perfect time to reveal one of these remake games at Pinball

[20:16] Expo, especially.

[20:18] Think about it.

[20:19] Nothing new from Stern.

[20:20] It's going to just be Venom, Venom, Venom.

[20:21] We're not going to see anything new from Spooky.

[20:24] Jersey Jack's not going to be quite ready to show Elton John.

[20:27] You're not going to see anything new from Chicago Gaming.

[20:31] Everything Pinball is going to try to get us to buy those $50,000 versions of Galactic

[20:35] Tank Force.

[20:36] There's not going to be anything really interesting from Multimorphic.

[20:40] Nothing, nothing other than the pinball brothers are supposed to reveal their new game.

[20:44] Now look, Canada is going to connect the dots here.

[20:47] I think the dark horse of this year is going to be the pinball brothers and Pedretti Gaming

[20:55] and Rick over at Planetary.

[20:57] I think they are going to reveal at Chicago Expo either Big Bang Bar or Twilight Zone.

[21:05] I think that's the mystery game we've been seeing.

[21:08] I think it's going to run on the fast pinball boards.

[21:11] We know Aaron over at Fast Pinball is supplying the boards for this game.

[21:15] I think that's going to be really the only big mystery left this year.

[21:21] You are hearing it on Canada's Pinball Podcast that I am predicting the dark horse of this

[21:27] year in October, a remake of a classic game by Pedretti Gaming and the pinball brothers

[21:35] and Rick over at Planetary.

[21:37] Let's see if I'm right or not.

[21:38] But man, over the next couple of months, we're going to get into this little bit of a lull.

[21:44] We're just going to be watching people unbox Godfather CEs.

[21:48] We're going to watch people sell their Godfather CEs for a $2,000 loss and everyone's going

[21:53] to realize they should have listened to Canada.

[21:56] I think everyone's going to use the next couple of months to just reflect on the pricing,

[22:02] reflect on their collections, and we're all just waiting for the next pin from Keith Elwyn.

[22:06] We are.

[22:07] Come on, let's be honest.

[22:08] We're waiting for that.

[22:09] I mean, everyone is waiting.

[22:10] You'd be silly to spend $13,000 on Venom right now when you know you're going to want to

[22:17] spend that $15,000 on Jaws, ladies and gentlemen, or that $20,000 on Back to the Future, or the

[22:25] freaking $18,000 on The Matrix.

[22:28] I mean, it's all coming, ladies and gentlemen.

[22:30] It's such an easy period to wait and see and see what comes out and keep your money in

[22:35] your wallet and watch these distros, man.

[22:37] They're sweating it, man.

[22:38] They're sweating it.

[22:39] You know, you remember, like for every Venom LE a distro buys, I think they have to agree

[22:44] to take like four premiums.

[22:46] I mean, that's a lot of inventory.

[22:49] If you have eight Venom LEs, you've got like 32 like pros and premiums like lining up in

[22:56] your inventory.

[22:57] I wouldn't want to write a check that big for a game where we know the demand is not going

[23:02] to be there like months from now.

[23:04] Everybody thank you for being a club member.

[23:06] We'll be back soon with more shows.

[23:08] You might have heard Killian crying in the background for a little bit.

[23:11] I did this show when he comes from daycare, so he's back there.

[23:15] He's my biggest fan.

[23:16] He's also the greatest pin side baby.

[23:18] Everybody will talk to you soon later.

[23:24] Know what you're for, you should know

[23:27] Baby, do you dare to do this?

[23:31] Cause I'm coming out to make it like a dog

[23:34] Oh, are you ready for, ready for, ready for

[23:39] A perfect storm, a perfect storm

[23:41] A perfect storm, cause what's your mind, what's your mind?

[23:47] There's no going back
