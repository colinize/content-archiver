[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] What a great Saturday it was yesterday.

[00:23] I went over to automate it.

[00:24] I met so many wonderful people who are fans of the show, subscribers of the show.

[00:30] I can't thank each and every one of you personally right now, but you know who you are.

[00:34] And you made yesterday one of the most fun days I've had in pinball in a really long

[00:39] time and I always say this, pinball, it's all about the people and it don't cost much

[00:44] money to get together and geek out over pinball.

[00:48] An extra special thank you though to Mr. Mike over at Automated.

[00:53] What a great host and Jersey Jack, it was great that you showed up with your two Elton

[00:58] John machines and you gave us such good heartfelt, candid answers.

[01:04] Whether or not we believe you about the flippers is one thing, but I just want to say I talk

[01:09] a lot of stuff about a lot of companies and I always respect when someone has the bravado

[01:16] to talk to me in real life.

[01:18] You know, Jack was a really good sport yesterday.

[01:21] If you haven't seen the interview, go on my Facebook page and check it out.

[01:25] So I am really excited to do this show because I've been thinking a lot about the last 24

[01:32] hours.

[01:33] I've been thinking about my fans.

[01:34] I've been thinking about this game Elton John.

[01:37] I've been thinking about all the games I've played over at Automated because sometimes

[01:41] it's just nice to go down a row and play like a hundred thousand dollars in value worth

[01:49] of pinball machines to make up your mind on what you appreciate, what you enjoy, what

[01:56] you value.

[01:57] And that's why I want to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball podcast a dilemma

[02:03] I've been struggling with and that dilemma is simply this.

[02:08] Sometimes in life, less is more.

[02:12] We can actually provide more enjoyment, more fun, more satisfaction.

[02:18] And with this game Elton John, I think that is the story.

[02:22] It is not the most loaded Jersey Jack game.

[02:25] If you lift the hood, it does not have as much on it as other offerings.

[02:31] If you look at the price, it's so expensive compared to what Jersey Jack games used to

[02:36] cost and what was in games like The Hobbit and Pirates of the Caribbean, what was in

[02:42] games like Dialed in and Wizard of Oz.

[02:45] And so this game compared to those games has a lot less in it.

[02:50] But then you stand over it and you look at all the beautiful artwork and the lights and

[02:55] the presentation and then you play the game and then all of a sudden you've got this

[03:00] dilemma because it may be and probably is easily the best shooting Jersey Jack game

[03:07] of all time.

[03:09] And yet there's less in it, but it's more fun.

[03:13] And this is a dilemma people because a dilemma unlike a problem does not have a solution.

[03:18] And so I want to talk about my feelings about this game because I have a lot of feelings

[03:22] about the game.

[03:24] I have a lot of feelings about Jersey Jack pinball.

[03:27] I have a lot of love for Jersey Jack.

[03:29] I have a lot of confusion for Jersey Jack pinball.

[03:32] It's been a very strange, strange journey.

[03:35] You know, when you think about Canada and Jersey Jack, I own a Jersey Jack machine.

[03:40] I went from Elton John and I jumped on Guns N' Roses.

[03:44] And that was an amazing thing to do because I got to see these two games delivered by

[03:50] two different designers, two different approaches from the same company, two music themes, two

[03:56] icons of music.

[03:58] And how did I feel after playing both games back to back to back?

[04:02] I jumped on James Bond 60th because I was having a real enjoyable time looking at all

[04:08] the different games and then asking that question, the value, right?

[04:12] Is this game fun?

[04:13] Is this game worth the money?

[04:15] Would I spend anywhere near $20,000 on a James Bond 60th?

[04:19] I'll get this out of the way right away.

[04:21] I thought that game was the biggest ripoff in the history of pinball.

[04:25] There's not much in it.

[04:26] I get it's very simple, but I don't think less is more when it comes to James Bond 60th.

[04:31] I just think that game is a ripoff and I think Stern should still be embarrassed that they

[04:35] ever asked anybody to pay $20,000.

[04:38] The art's not good.

[04:40] The shots are not that interesting.

[04:42] There's not much going on.

[04:43] The scoring reel is boring.

[04:45] It's a fine game if it was like $6,500, but that game, at that much money, if I paid

[04:51] $20,000, even $15,000 or $12,000 for a James Bond 60th and that's what's slid out of the

[04:57] box, I would be heavily disappointed.

[05:00] So my tune is not changing on that game.

[05:02] All right, so Elton John, I walk over to Automated.

[05:05] I go through the door.

[05:06] I got my zip card from New York City and I see Elton John Platinum Edition.

[05:12] When you walk into a room and you see this game for the first time, I will say this is

[05:16] arguably.

[05:18] Maybe the most beautiful pinball machine that's ever been made.

[05:22] And I mean that.

[05:23] Like I know art is subjective, but that Christopher Franci art package on that Platinum Edition

[05:29] of the game, it's by far his nicest work on a cabinet to date.

[05:33] I think it actually pops even more than Batman SLE.

[05:37] And then you look at the color palette that he put into this game and it is perfect.

[05:42] Like everything about this game just screams colorful Elton John fun pinball.

[05:48] It is attractive.

[05:49] I think that's the best word I can use.

[05:50] It is so damn attractive.

[05:53] And when you go into the other room and you see all the other pinball machines

[05:56] that Mike has, nothing popped like Elton John.

[06:00] So this game, just from a pure aesthetic standpoint, gets a 10 out of 10.

[06:06] And again, what's the theme of this show?

[06:08] Less is more.

[06:10] And if you spend less money on Elton John and get the Platinum Edition, I think

[06:15] you're getting more for your money because I think this art package is so much nicer

[06:21] and more interesting than what is on the collector's edition version of the game.

[06:26] This should have been the collector's edition of the game.

[06:29] But for $12,000, you're going to get the better looking game.

[06:33] And I get the CE has a lot of sparkle and purple and gold.

[06:37] But as Jack even said, Platinum is more expensive than gold.

[06:41] And I even told him, I'm like, Jack, it's not too late.

[06:44] You should just switch it.

[06:45] Well, it is too late because I can't get Mirko to add the glitter to the playfields

[06:48] on the Platinum.

[06:49] But man, this Platinum game is Jersey Jack Pinball's nicest looking game to date.

[06:55] Its second nicest looking game to date is Guns N' Roses.

[06:58] And I will say that when I went over to Guns N' Roses, I was like, wow, this game still has it.

[07:02] Like Guns N' Roses is still such a stunning machine.

[07:05] It really is.

[07:06] I would say the cabinet artwork on Elton John is still better than Guns N' Roses.

[07:11] And Guns N' Roses has more to look at when you look down at the game itself.

[07:14] But let me wait till I get to the comparisons between the two games.

[07:17] Let me talk about Elton John.

[07:19] So when you stand over the game and you're looking down at the game, it's hard for me

[07:23] to look at this game right now and get out of my head, everything that's been in my head.

[07:27] And I've read all the feedback from Expo.

[07:30] I've been on pin side.

[07:31] I've heard everything.

[07:32] I've heard the good, the bad and the ugly about Elton John.

[07:35] I've said a lot about this game before even playing it.

[07:38] I'm here to tell you right now, there's a little bit of truth in what everybody's been saying.

[07:43] The game is stunning.

[07:44] From a mechanical standpoint, when you look down at the game, there really isn't much in it.

[07:50] From a mechanical standpoint, this looks like mechanically what Stern would have in a

[07:56] pro version of a machine.

[07:58] There's just not a lot happening mechanically in the game.

[08:02] And you could say when you look down at it, it does look a little empty.

[08:07] Everything is at the top end of the play field.

[08:10] There's really nothing else happening interesting in this game on the left and right side of the game.

[08:16] You know, and the only really interesting thing to look at is that piano and that piano mech is really

[08:22] cool with the LED lights.

[08:24] I will say this when I was playing the game, though, I didn't really find myself looking at it.

[08:28] I was more just paying attention to the shots and the speed and the flow of the game.

[08:32] And I wasn't really paying attention to the mech.

[08:34] You know, the thing about the piano, I wish it did because it locks the balls.

[08:38] There's just not a moment in the game.

[08:40] It just doesn't do anything where like there's a dramatic moment, right?

[08:44] Like you locked the three balls in the piano.

[08:46] It would have been awesome if like the top of the piano opened up and then the balls like got fired out of it

[08:52] somehow in some dramatic way, kind of like the treasure chest should open up and fire to the Caribbean.

[08:58] You're just not going to play Elton John and see something happen mechanically where you're going to say, wow, did you see that?

[09:06] Right?

[09:06] There's no like Godzilla building.

[09:08] There is no T Rex head that eats the ball and throws it around.

[09:12] There's just not a lot of toys in this game.

[09:15] And so that is why I do feel like it's like a Steve Ritchie pro game brought over to Jersey Jack Pinball, in which the main

[09:24] features are the music, the lights, the shots, the design flow and like the sound in this game.

[09:31] So let's talk about the flippers first because I know that's the main thing, right?

[09:35] So many of you out there have really not liked Jersey Jack games because the flipper feel has not been great.

[09:42] And is this Jersey Jack's best feeling, best shooting game to date?

[09:46] The answer is yes.

[09:48] Does it feel exactly like a stern and as snappy as a stern machine?

[09:52] The answer is still no, but I didn't feel any issues with these flippers at all.

[09:59] The way you would feel with guns and roses, the way you would feel with like Jersey Jack's older, wide body games that

[10:05] were very floaty, this game plays great.

[10:08] So if pinball gameplay is something you love, this is going to be your favorite Jersey Jack shooting game to date.

[10:17] Now, all of a sudden, my friend Derek is kicking himself for ordering the Godfather LE because even though that game

[10:24] shoots fine, this is a much more satisfying game.

[10:27] And I played Godfather yesterday and yes, it does shoot better than the previous Jersey Jack games.

[10:32] I don't think that Godfather as a game is executed as well as Elton John.

[10:38] And again, Godfather is Godfather, right?

[10:40] Lots of red, lots of black.

[10:42] It's a very dark looking game compared to Elton John.

[10:45] Elton John, like the marriage of the artwork and the lights in this Jersey Jack package are just perfect because, you know, Elton's

[10:53] God is colorful rainbow world and you've got this colorful rainbow light show in Jersey Jack games.

[11:00] And so it just fits together so nicely with Elton John.

[11:04] All right, so then I play the game a bunch.

[11:05] I just sat on it.

[11:07] I just played it.

[11:07] My first ball was actually my best.

[11:10] I had about like a five minute ball going and I was just hitting shots.

[11:14] I was ripping orbits.

[11:16] I was going up the ramp.

[11:17] It was looping around.

[11:18] I was locking balls.

[11:20] Everything was just going great.

[11:22] I didn't really have any idea what I was doing in terms of what the code wanted me to do.

[11:27] So I just wanted to enjoy the game play because it's been like over 10 years and most of us have never really enjoyed the game play of a Jersey Jack game.

[11:38] And so now we've got one.

[11:40] We've got a game that you're going to really enjoy shooting it.

[11:43] And I think everyone who jumps up on this machine is going to have a good time shooting the game and playing the game and standing over it in person is so much different than watching clips on the internet.

[11:56] And I'll give you a good example of that.

[11:58] Like on the internet, I am so annoyed by those call outs in the game.

[12:03] But when you're playing the game and you're hearing the Elton John music,

[12:07] those call outs don't really stand out that much.

[12:10] They're not as annoying in real life as they are when you watch a stream.

[12:14] And so I was expecting to be more like turned off by the audio package in this game.

[12:19] And I'm telling you right now, I think they upgraded the sound system in this

[12:23] machine because it's the best sounding Jersey Jack machine of all time as well.

[12:28] The game sounds amazing.

[12:30] Like when I was walking around automated and I was watching people play other games

[12:34] and then I came over to this game, it just sounded so much better.

[12:39] And this is to take nothing away from all the great games at Stern Pinball.

[12:43] But there's just no denying the fact that when you put a Jersey Jack game like Elton

[12:48] John next to Stern's best looking games, it still makes Stern games look cheap.

[12:54] It really, really does.

[12:56] And I know that's Jack's dilemma is he's looking over at these Stern games

[13:00] and they're charging 13,000 for an Ellie that doesn't come with a topper,

[13:06] that doesn't come with sparkly armor, doesn't come with radcals, doesn't come with this stuff.

[13:12] And then he's giving you everything.

[13:14] He's giving you a topper.

[13:15] He's giving you radcals.

[13:17] He's giving you inner art blades.

[13:19] All that stuff is coming standard on his machine now for $12,000.

[13:23] And he's got to feel like, what the heck?

[13:26] Why is everybody complaining about my prices when they're paying that much

[13:31] for that game with not as much in it?

[13:33] And the reason why we've been spending so much money on Stern machines is because

[13:38] they play well and now we have a period in time we haven't experienced ever before.

[13:43] A Jersey Jack game that shoots as good as a Stern machine.

[13:47] But then we get into some of the dilemma now.

[13:50] The dilemma is it's still Elton John,

[13:53] which is not a take my money now theme for most of you.

[13:57] And so you've got the best shooting Jersey Jack machine of all time,

[14:01] wrapped up in a theme which is not very popular with the pinball buying demographic.

[14:07] So it's got a lot of people on the fence.

[14:10] A lot of you don't want to put an Elton John theme into your game rooms.

[14:15] Now, I would encourage you to keep an open mind on that after playing the game.

[14:19] Also, if you put this thing in your game room,

[14:22] it's going to be the most stunning machine in your game room.

[14:25] So it's going to win some points there.

[14:27] And if you just love playing pinball, it's going to satisfy you on that level.

[14:32] But still, the dilemma exists with a theme that's not take my money now in a time

[14:39] in which they want to take the most money they've ever taken from us.

[14:43] How are people going to reconcile that dilemma?

[14:47] Are you going to hand them $12,000 and just give it a whirl?

[14:52] Are you crazy enough to hand them $15,000 for the C.E.

[14:57] In which the art package isn't as nice as the Ellie?

[15:00] That's the dilemma, too.

[15:01] If I bought a C.E., I would always want the Frenchy version of the game.

[15:06] And I don't want to be feeling that dilemma.

[15:09] If I'm spending the most amount of money on their product,

[15:12] the most expensive version should be the nicest in every way.

[15:16] And it's just not this time around.

[15:18] And the other dilemma is this, even if you're willing to give them the $12,000

[15:23] and you're willing to have the best shooting Jersey Jack experience of all time,

[15:27] you've seen what's happened with Toy Story Ellie prices and Godfather Ellie prices.

[15:33] And knowing that Elton John Ellie is not limited to any build number,

[15:38] you're worried that if I go in at 12, I'm going to see this game for sale

[15:44] for like 8500 in less than a year.

[15:46] And so you're listening to guys like

[15:48] Canada and you're saying I'm just going to wait it out.

[15:51] And when this game reaches a certain price point, I'm going to jump in on it.

[15:56] But that's a dilemma for Jersey Jack.

[15:58] How are they going to order parts and make these games if everyone's waiting

[16:03] for it to hit the used market?

[16:05] There won't be a used market if there isn't a somewhat robust

[16:08] new and box market for this game.

[16:10] And that's another dilemma, because if this game doesn't have good sales

[16:15] and they don't make many of them and they move on to the next game and they don't

[16:20] make this game again, and then what happens?

[16:23] Right? Do we see like only a thousand or 1500 get made?

[16:26] And then it spikes in value like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[16:29] And then they never make it again, because one of the reasons why they're

[16:32] never going to make Pirates again is Leonard over there was like, screw them,

[16:36] screw them. I'm not going to give them what they want.

[16:38] They should have bought from me in the first place.

[16:41] And that's the attitude of a billionaire.

[16:43] And who are we to say he's wrong?

[16:45] And so I think we might see that with Elton John.

[16:47] And so it's such a dilemma because I think this is a great Pimbald experience.

[16:53] I think this is the kind of gameplay we've always wanted in a Jersey Jack machine.

[16:57] Yes, there should be more toys in this game.

[17:00] Absolutely. Yes, those three targets up the middle are not that interesting to shoot.

[17:05] It's absolutely numb feeling when you shoot those three targets.

[17:09] It's uninspired. I wish they went down.

[17:11] I wish it opened up a ball path to something more dramatic.

[17:14] I wish there was a little bit more.

[17:15] Wow, magic, mechanically in the game, but it's still really fun to shoot.

[17:20] And when that music's going, it's rocking.

[17:22] I mean, this is rock and roll music.

[17:24] People Elton John is rock and roll guns and roses is hard rock.

[17:28] But this was like 70s, 80s rock and roll.

[17:31] And it's awesome.

[17:32] And it's perfect for Pimbald.

[17:33] This game has energy.

[17:35] It has lights, it has colors, it has a personality.

[17:38] Right. I don't feel energy when I watch people play the Godfather.

[17:42] I just see my friend Derek losing money every time someone streams that game.

[17:46] And so like the dilemmas are all over the place with this game.

[17:50] And then the next dilemma is this.

[17:51] It's happening outside of Jersey Jack's control.

[17:54] How are you going to order this game?

[17:56] Knowing that Jaws is just a couple of weeks away.

[18:00] Knowing that there's a new spooky game around the corner any day now.

[18:04] There's just so many options in Pimbald right now.

[18:07] You really have to love it to say, take this much money.

[18:10] It's a lot of money now.

[18:12] It's a lot of money.

[18:14] And this is where this game is netting out for me.

[18:16] I'm worried that this is a great game that is going to be doomed by the realities

[18:23] of the market right now.

[18:25] The last two games did not help its cause.

[18:28] And I'm worried that Elton John is going to go down in flames.

[18:33] And it doesn't deserve to.

[18:35] But it's just the reality of where we are.

[18:38] Prices have been so high for so long.

[18:41] Too many Jersey Jack faithful people have lost money on bad decisions.

[18:46] When people say like this game was a bad decision to make because nobody wants Elton

[18:50] John, I don't really think that is true.

[18:53] I just think after Toy Story 4 and Godfather, this is a tough game to follow up with.

[19:00] And yes, it still is a very polarizing theme.

[19:03] But ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to say this.

[19:06] Elton John music is way better than Iron Maiden music.

[19:10] For most people, he sold 360 million albums.

[19:14] So if you can jump on Iron Maiden because of the gameplay, even if you don't like

[19:19] the music, if you can enjoy Iron Maiden because of the gameplay, then you sure as

[19:25] hell could equally enjoy playing or owning Elton John pinball.

[19:29] And that's where I'm at with Elton John, a great game that is stuck in a crazy

[19:35] dilemma moment that I don't know what the answer is.

[19:39] Each and every one of us is going to have to struggle with this now with every new

[19:45] game that comes out.

[19:46] There is no longer any room anymore in pinball for mediocrity or mediocre success.

[19:53] Your game is either going to be a hit or it's going to flop because people are not

[19:57] going to dabble at these prices.

[19:59] They're not going to lose three to four thousand dollars on a cardboard box.

[20:03] But this game is just crazy stunning.

[20:06] And I'm just going to say this.

[20:07] This game is much more stunning than Elvira Blood Kiss Edition.

[20:11] I've seen these two games side by side.

[20:13] It's just prettier, but Elvira has more toys in it.

[20:15] It sure does.

[20:16] I don't think it shoots as well as Elton John.

[20:19] And look, as I said, I went over to Guns and Roses, right?

[20:22] That's the one game I own.

[20:23] Like, let me go play the game that's been sitting in a box for three years and see

[20:27] how Guns and Roses feels compared to Elton John.

[20:29] And immediately I felt the weak flippers immediately, though, I did feel like there's

[20:34] a lot more in G&R, a lot more in it.

[20:37] And there's a lot of different unique shots to hit in G&R.

[20:41] I don't think the shot layout in Elton John is as interesting as Guns and Roses.

[20:46] Now you would argue that G&R is not interesting because the flow is not there.

[20:50] And that's the other thing I noticed.

[20:51] Is that Guns and Roses doesn't have flow.

[20:54] Like you're shooting in all these different directions and there's all these

[20:57] different things and ways to go, but none of it is flowy.

[21:00] And so it feels a lot more like a rocky road than it does like a drag strip.

[21:06] And so like Elton John, when it comes to flow and like combos and like shot layout

[21:11] is a much more rewarding game to shoot.

[21:14] But Guns and Roses has a lot more interesting things to see the ball do

[21:19] when you play the game.

[21:20] And also, you know, I'm a little bit biased because G&R is my favorite band.

[21:23] Guns and Roses is still cooler than Elton John as a theme.

[21:28] And when you start a Guns and Roses song and the light show in it is still

[21:33] superior than the light show in Elton John.

[21:36] Elton John is so colorful.

[21:37] I think we're just getting used to these JJP light shows, but no game has really

[21:42] created a moment with those lights, the way they've done it with Guns and Roses,

[21:46] where you've got the song and the lights are doing this beautiful dance together.

[21:51] It still holds up after all of these years.

[21:54] You know, and that's why everybody's like, is there a way to get Guns and Roses

[21:58] flipper feel to feel as good as Elton John?

[22:02] I asked Jack the question, is it hardware?

[22:05] Is it software?

[22:06] He keeps going back to that default answer that you can raise the flipper power.

[22:11] That's not the problem.

[22:12] The solution really is there's a new driver board and its new

[22:16] software, even if the hardware is the same, they change the way the software is

[22:21] talking to those flippers and still no real answer on whether or not it will be

[22:26] backwards compatible.

[22:28] So if you own a Guns and Roses, I don't think you're going to get flipper feels

[22:32] to be ever as good as Elton John.

[22:34] I asked Jack about Guns and Roses code and Pire to the Caribbean code.

[22:38] I don't think we're going to get that.

[22:40] And like, I guess the final dilemma too is if we feel that Jersey Jack has the

[22:44] Matrix and has Harry Potter coming and Mark Sidon is next in line at Jersey Jack

[22:51] Pimball, again, like, do you buy Elton John at full price?

[22:55] Do you wait for those titles you'd rather have?

[22:58] It's still a Steve Ritchie game.

[22:59] So you know, you know, it's going to be hard for someone to make a game that

[23:03] shoots better than Steve Ritchie.

[23:05] If you look at the top Pimball machines of all time, it's really like Steve Ritchie

[23:09] and Keith Elwin are the two from a gameplay standpoint that people

[23:14] appreciate the most.

[23:16] So it's tough.

[23:17] It's tough.

[23:18] And look, I love this.

[23:20] I love thinking about these dilemmas.

[23:22] I love unpacking this hobby this way.

[23:25] I love doing this show during a time like this.

[23:29] And this is why Canada's Pimball podcast is the most successful it's ever been.

[23:34] You know, and we're having a good time here.

[23:36] We had a great time yesterday.

[23:38] I would love to hear your feedback.

[23:40] We had people over at CoinTaker playing Elton John yesterday and everything.

[23:44] I'm reading is positive.

[23:46] Like everything I'm reading is positive, except for the price.

[23:50] If this game was ninety five hundred bucks, it would be selling like hotcakes.

[23:55] I would buy one at ninety five hundred.

[23:57] I just don't want to buy one at twelve.

[24:00] And then in three months, it's ninety five hundred new in box.

[24:04] And that's my fear.

[24:05] But would I own an Elton John Pimball machine after playing it, after standing

[24:10] over it, the answer is absolutely.

[24:13] And if money is no object to you, then you should really seriously consider this game.

[24:19] And one day we're going to get there.

[24:21] One day we're going to get there where Jersey Jack is going to check all the boxes.

[24:26] A game that shoots this well, that has a few more toys in it and is a theme that's

[24:31] take my money now, they have never achieved that yet.

[24:35] They got very, very close with guns and roses, but we know what happened.

[24:39] The playfields fell apart and there's too many damn multi balls and the gameplay

[24:44] isn't there. That's the other thing with guns and roses.

[24:47] I walked up to it and immediately a multi ball started.

[24:52] I didn't hit anything.

[24:53] I didn't aim for anything.

[24:55] And now two balls are shoved in my face, which changes your ability to really focus

[25:00] on gameplay, and I didn't feel that in Elton John.

[25:03] You know, it's getting to the point now where Joe Katz is the superior coder

[25:07] over at Jersey Jack because he doesn't throw multi balls at you every 30 seconds.

[25:12] Like Keith and Eric have been doing over their last few titles.

[25:15] You know, someone needs to sit Eric down and say, look, man,

[25:18] a multi ball should be a rewarding achievement you get at the end of a journey.

[25:25] It shouldn't just be thrown in your face immediately.

[25:28] And you can start a multi ball in guns and roses.

[25:31] This is the sad part.

[25:32] You can start a multi ball without even knowing what you've done.

[25:37] That is bad design.

[25:39] That is bad coding.

[25:40] I always feel like in pinball, you should know how to lock balls and multi balls

[25:45] should start after you lock those balls.

[25:48] It shouldn't be any more difficult than that.

[25:51] Eric, Keith, less is more, less multi ball.

[25:56] And your games become more fun.

[25:58] How many times do we have to tell you this and you keep doing it?

[26:03] And Derek, I don't want to have to go into the settings

[26:06] and adjust the game.

[26:08] They just need to wake up and hear the feedback and make a game the way people

[26:14] want it, the way I make a podcast the way people want it.

[26:19] Love all of you.

[26:20] Thanks for the support.

[26:21] This was a fun show to do.

[26:23] It gives us a lot to talk about the world's favorite pinball podcast.

[26:27] We're going to go seven for seven in the Twippy's people.

[26:29] No more drama, no more poking.

[26:31] Let's just get your votes ready.

[26:33] December 18th and let's take it and send a message to everybody out there.

[26:37] Why this show is number one and why you're a member of the best club in pinball.

[26:42] Later.
