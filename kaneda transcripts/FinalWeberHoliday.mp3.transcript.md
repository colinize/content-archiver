[04:00] Every day is so wonderful

[04:10] Inside of me, inside of me

[04:18] I wonder how I can insecure

[04:24] More than something

[04:38] Words can bring me down

[04:46] I am beautiful, in a single way

[04:51] Words can bring me down

[06:08] We're the 30th time in tune

[06:12] For the beautiful mistakes

[09:10] I'm looking to the mirror

[09:41] I'm going to sleep

[09:50] A life spins out front of me

[09:57] Like a hurricane, but a lot of wine

[23:16] When I want your baby

[23:20] Your heart is just me

[23:28] What a stain your arms forever

[23:34] All that love is that you feel

[25:24] And I know we're not together

[25:30] All that love is that you feel

[25:42] You stripped your love down to the white

[25:50] You stripped it right down to the white

[25:54] But I see you behind those tired eyes

[25:58] Now as you wait through the shadows

[26:02] The living your heart can find the light that leads home

[26:06] Because I see you for you

[26:10] And if you do the full stars take my hand on Lego

[28:54] Corp before I hit the ground

[28:58] Say if you've got me there

[31:07] How many times do I have to tell you?

[31:11] Even when you're crying you're beautiful too

[31:30] The world is beating you down around

[31:36] The web ring rolling, you're my downfall

[32:47] And taste did a sweet perfume of a mountain grass all rolled down

[32:55] I was younger than you

[32:58] Take me back to when

[33:02] Fifteen years old, smoking and roasted red

[33:09] Running from laws to the backfields and getting drunk with my friends

[33:16] And my first kiss on Friday night

[33:21] I don't recognize it here, right?

[33:25] I was younger than you

[33:28] Take me back to when

[33:31] I'm on my way

[33:35] Driving at 90 down those country lanes

[33:42] Singing to tiny dancer and I

[33:47] Meet the way you make me feel

[33:52] And it's real we watch the sunset

[33:57] All over the car so I'm here

[34:27] Over the car so I'm here

[34:57] Over the car so I'm here

[35:07] Over the car so I'm here

[35:27] Over the car so I'm here

[35:42] I'm on my way

[35:46] Driving at 90 down those country lanes

[35:53] Singing to tiny dancer and I

[35:58] Meet the way you make me feel

[36:03] And it's real we watch the sunset

[36:08] All over the car so I'm here

[36:23] Over the car so I'm here

[36:43] Over the car so I'm here

[36:53] Over the car so I'm here

[37:01] Over the car so I'm here

[37:09] Over the car so I'm here

[37:19] Over the car so I'm here

[37:27] Over the car so I'm here

[37:35] Over the car so I'm here

[37:45] Over the car so I'm here

[37:53] Over the car so I'm here

[38:01] Over the car so I'm here

[38:11] Over the car so I'm here

[38:21] Over the car so I'm here

[38:27] Over the car so I'm here

[38:37] Over the car so I'm here

[38:47] Over the car so I'm here

[38:56] I'm here

[39:05] Over the car so I'm here

[39:15] Over the car so I'm here

[39:25] Over the car so I'm here

[39:39] I said no one has to know what we do

[39:43] His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room

[39:47] And his voice is a familiar sound

[39:50] Nothing lasts forever

[39:53] But this is getting good now

[39:55] He's so tall and handsome as hell

[39:59] He's so bad but he does it so well

[40:03] And when we've had our very last kiss my last request

[40:09] Stay close, remember me

[40:13] Stayed in a nice dress staring at the sun

[40:16] To fit but live some rosy cheeks

[40:20] Stay you'll see me up again

[40:22] Even if it's just your stream's on

[40:50] Nobody here knocking at my door

[40:56] The sound of silence I keep taking more

[41:02] Nobody bringing my telephone out

[41:08] Oh how I miss such a beautiful sound

[41:14] And I don't even know how I survive

[41:20] I want to make it to the shore without your light

[41:26] No I don't even know if I'm alive

[41:34] Oh without you now this is what I feel like

[41:44] Oh without you now This is getting better

[41:52] Oh without you now This is getting better

[42:00] And when I'm back I want to stay with you

[42:04] And I don't even know if I'm alive

[42:08] Feeling my way through the dark hell

[42:12] Got it by beating hard, I think tell where the journey will end, but I know where to start.

[42:23] They tell me I'm too young to understand, they say I'm caught up in a dream.

[42:31] Well I will pass by if I don't open up my eyes, so that's fine by me.

[42:38] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise or in a molde.

[42:46] All this time I was finding myself in love, didn't know I was lost.

[42:54] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise or in a molde.

[43:02] All this time I was finding myself in love, didn't know I was lost.

[43:33] As you will, as you wake, kind of beautiful.

[43:44] And if we not have to stay so magical, and if there's love in this life, there's the obstacle.

[43:52] There can't be defeat for every tyrannity of all the vulnerable.

[43:59] And every loss of the bones of the miracle, for every dream, a dream will stop a bone.

[44:07] With something to believe in.

[44:11] Monday left me broken, Tuesday I was through with hoping, Wednesday my empty arms were open.

[44:21] Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love.

[44:26] May the stars is right here, I'm burning like a fire gun wild on Saturday.

[44:32] Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday, I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love.

[44:40] To cover up.

[44:51] And I'll be waiting for love.

[44:58] To cover up.

[45:05] And I'll be waiting for love.

[45:12] To cover up.

[45:18] That you'll settle down at you, found a girl and you'll marry tonight.

[45:32] But I love that you'll be taking care of.

[45:38] Guess you can't think, I'll be with you.

[45:46] Oh, babe, why are you so shy?

[45:52] Ain't like who you're meant to be.

[45:57] I hate to turn around with the one by the guy.

[46:05] And stay with me, I couldn't fight it out.

[46:08] I took you to my face, and said you'd be reminded that for me, it doesn't know.

[46:17] So let me find a fine, so I'll keep you.

[46:23] I just love me with the best of you.

[46:30] Don't forget me, no pain, I'll be with you by my own hands.

[46:38] So let me find a fine, so I'll keep you.

[46:45] So let me find a fine, so I'll keep you.

[46:52] I'm going on during this time of fear, there's no one to sin even.

[47:07] This old and nothing really got away driving me crazy.

[47:14] I need somebody, I hear somebody to know, somebody to know.

[47:21] Somebody to hold, it's easy to say, but it's never seen.

[47:27] I guess I can't let go of you, no door to bed, no other day please.

[47:32] It's a knife, oh, in your Lord, he is, he give me fruit, oh, I love my God, oh.

[47:40] And then you pull the rug, I was getting cut and used to being so well, you're left alone.

[47:46] I'm going on during this time of fear, there's no one to sin even.

[47:53] This old and nothing really got away driving me crazy.

[48:00] I need somebody to hold, it's easy to say, but it's never seen.

[48:07] I guess I can't let go of you, no door to bed, no other day please.

[48:13] I'm going on during this time of fear, there's no one to sin even.

[48:19] This old and nothing really got away driving me crazy.

[48:25] I need somebody to hold, it's easy to say, but it's never seen.

[48:37] I guess I can't let go of you, no other day please.

[48:42] It's a knife, oh, in your Lord, he is, he give me fruit, oh, I love my God, oh.

[48:50] And then you pull the rug, I was getting cut and used to being so well, you're left alone.

[48:57] And I said the clothes, but it's not in her, sometimes I fall into your arms.

[49:06] I'll be safe in this zone, till I go back around.

[49:11] From now to day, please, it's a knife, oh, yeah, you're not here, you're to give me fruit, oh.

[49:19] And then you pull the rug, I was getting cut and used to being so well, you're left alone.

[49:27] And all the day, please, it's a knife, oh, in your Lord, he is, he give me fruit, oh, I love my God, oh.

[49:36] And then you pull the rug, I was getting cut and used to being so well, you're left alone.

[49:46] Once upon a young yet, when all our shadows disappeared, the animals inside came out to play.

[49:53] When face to face with all our fears, learned our lessons through the tears, made memories when you were never fed.

[50:00] One day my father ate, told me, son, don't let it slip away, it took me a days I'm tired of saying,

[50:08] you get older, you are, I will live for your good days, think it's never your face.

[50:15] He said one day, you live this world behind, forever live, you will remember.

[50:23] My father told me, but now it's just a job, these are the nights to never try, my father told me.

[01:34:42] I'm laughing at all the things

[01:34:47] Scenching, twirling

[01:34:51] Feel, river

[01:34:55] From the coast to the Bornima

[01:34:58] To the island of Capri

[01:35:00] All the way to Guadalupe

[01:35:02] I will follow you wherever you may be

[01:35:07] From the morning to the first sight

[01:35:09] You knew my heart could not be free

[01:35:11] I have to all do it in my arms now

[01:35:14] But there'll never be another for me

[01:35:19] All I need is a rhythmly bite

[01:35:24] Who lost in the music your heart will be mine

[01:35:28] All I need is to look in your eyes

[01:35:33] Who will be by my music I say you'll be mine

[01:35:37] Then you feel the heat of passion

[01:35:40] Can you taste the luxury wine

[01:35:42] During the dance and learning happiness

[01:35:45] Tomorrow's here, right out of your mind

[01:35:49] There's a music drawn too close up

[01:35:52] And you fall down on my spell

[01:35:54] I will get you rewaves now

[01:35:56] But then I can't take this alone walk in the air

[01:36:01] All I need is a rhythmly bite

[01:36:06] Who lost in the music your heart will be mine

[01:36:10] All I need is to look in your eyes

[01:36:15] Who will be by my music I say you'll be mine

[01:36:30] I will follow you wherever you may be

[01:37:00] I will follow you wherever you may be

[01:37:30] I will follow you wherever you may be

[01:38:00] I will follow you wherever you may be

[01:38:31] Of course, if I die, if I die of love

[01:38:34] Of course, if you die, if you die

[01:38:37] All I need is a rhythmly bite

[01:38:39] I'll follow you wherever you may be

[01:38:45] What do you do to move your fingers

[01:38:48] Other than the heart

[01:38:50] Oh

[01:40:08] Or do you need more?

[01:40:12] Ain't it hard to win, so hard more?

[01:40:15] I'm falling

[01:40:19] You know, good times have been by myself

[01:40:22] For me, for a change

[01:40:26] And in the bad times I feel myself

[01:40:30] I'm on the deep end, watches I die there

[01:40:34] I'll never be the ground

[01:40:37] Crack those eyeballs, where they can't hurt

[01:40:41] But I'm from the shadow now

[01:40:45] In the shadow, shadow

[02:40:20] And watch how you play

[02:40:23] They don't understand

[02:40:25] And so we're running just as fast as we can

[02:40:30] Pulling up the one another dead

[02:40:33] And try to get away into the night

[02:40:37] And make a picture of the memory

[02:40:39] And make some more stupid better

[02:40:41] Let me say, I think we're alone

[02:40:44] Sounds insane to be anyone around

[02:40:59] I think we're alone

[02:41:02] Singing along to the only sun

[02:41:23] If they ever knew and so

[02:41:25] We're running just as fast as we can

[02:41:28] Pulling up the one another dead

[02:41:32] And try to get away into the night

[02:41:35] And make a picture of the memory

[02:41:38] And make some more stupid better

[02:41:40] Let me say, I think we're alone

[02:41:43] Sounds insane to be anyone around

[02:41:55] I think we're alone

[02:41:57] Sounds insane to be anyone around

[02:42:02] I think we're alone

[02:42:04] Singing along to the only sun

[02:42:09] My heart is always floating in the trees

[02:42:14] My body burns a genuine flame

[02:42:20] So I'm in between the soul and some machine

[02:42:25] Where I find myself again

[03:42:09] And he's weak arms are heavy

[03:42:11] His vomit on his sweater already

[03:42:13] Moms forget he's nervous

[03:42:14] But on the circus he looks calm

[03:42:16] And ready to drop palms

[03:42:17] But he keeps on forgetting

[03:42:19] What he wrote down

[03:42:20] The whole crowd

[03:42:23] But the words won't come out

[03:42:25] He's choking how

[03:42:27] The clocks run out

[03:42:29] Times up overblows

[03:42:52] And hope it don't go

[03:42:53] Ready, lose his mouth

[03:43:04] This world is mine for the taking

[03:43:06] Make me king

[03:43:07] As we move toward a new world order

[03:43:31] He blows his all over

[03:43:32] His hose is all on him

[03:43:34] Coast the coast shows

[03:43:37] Lonely roads got only nose

[03:43:38] He's grown farther from home

[03:43:40] He's no farther

[03:43:41] He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

[03:43:44] But hold your nose cause he goes to cold water

[03:43:46] His hose don't want him no more

[03:43:48] He's cold product

[03:43:49] And he moved on in an egg smooth

[03:43:51] Close he knows don't and so not a

[03:43:57] But the beat goes on

[03:43:59] And get out of there

[03:46:15] You can die, I think the death of your life

[03:46:21] Who will see that girl

[03:46:24] Watch that scene

[03:46:26] Diggin' a dancing theme

[03:46:31] Riding in the lights alone

[03:46:41] Looking out for a face to go

[03:46:46] Where the fade of our music

[03:46:48] Getting in the swing

[03:46:50] You come to your birthplace

[03:46:55] Anybody could be that guy

[03:47:00] Not his young and the music's high

[03:47:05] We'll feel rough music

[03:47:07] Everything's fine

[03:47:09] During the moon for death

[03:47:13] And when you get the chance

[03:47:18] You are the dancing queen

[03:47:22] Young and sweet are the same team

[03:47:29] Dancing queen

[03:47:31] Feel the beat from the gallery

[03:47:38] You can dance, you can die

[03:47:43] I think the time of your life

[03:47:47] Who will see that girl

[03:47:50] Watch that scene

[03:47:52] Diggin' a dancing queen

[03:47:59] I'm a man who ever rock was young

[03:48:02] Me and Silly had so much fun

[03:48:05] Holdin' hands and skim and stones

[03:48:08] Had a no-go time

[03:48:10] And I'm flessin' my arm

[03:48:12] But the biggest kick I ever got

[03:48:15] Was gonna play called the crocodile rock

[03:48:18] While the other kids are rockin' round the clock

[03:48:21] We were hoppin' and bobin'

[03:48:23] To the crocodile rockin' well

[03:48:25] And the song's a shot to when you feel just bad

[03:48:30] Keep still

[03:48:31] I never knew me about the time

[03:48:34] I guess I never will

[03:48:37] I'm a body-like

[03:48:41] I see what the poor woman can tell her yet

[03:48:44] I'm a body-like, I don't know where she's at

[03:48:55] But girls went by and the rock just died

[03:49:06] Silly whine and love is false and foreign guy

[03:49:09] Long nights cryin' by the record machine

[03:49:12] Dreaming of the shepherd and the old blue jeans

[03:49:16] But they never kill the true sweetheart

[03:49:19] Burnin' up to the crocodile rock

[03:49:22] Learning fast, that's the which went fast

[03:49:25] We really thought the crocodile rock will love well

[03:49:29] But I'm a song a shot to when you feel just bad

[03:49:34] Keep still

[03:49:36] I never knew me about the time I guess I never will

[03:49:41] I'm a body-like, I see what the poor woman can tell her yet

[03:49:48] I'm a body-like, I don't know where she's at

[03:49:56] I'm a body-like, I don't know where she's at

[03:50:02] But I'm a body-like, I don't know where she's at

[03:50:09] But I'm a body-like, I don't know where she's at

[03:50:13] I get up in the evening

[03:50:17] And I ain't got nothin' to say

[03:50:20] I come home in the morning

[03:50:23] I go to bed feeling the same way

[03:50:26] I ain't nothin' but tired

[03:50:29] And I'm just tired and bored with myself

[03:50:33] Hey there baby

[03:50:36] I got used to just a little way

[03:50:39] You can't start a fire

[03:50:42] You can't start a fire without a spark

[03:50:46] This gun's behind

[03:50:49] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:50:58] Messages keep getting clearer

[03:51:02] Radio's on and I'm moving around my place

[03:51:05] I check my look in the mirror

[03:51:08] Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

[03:51:12] And I ain't getting nowhere

[03:51:15] I'm just living in a dark darkness

[03:51:18] There's someone having a somewhere

[03:51:22] Baby I just knew the kiss

[03:51:25] You can't start a fire

[03:51:28] You can't start a fire without a spark

[03:51:31] This gun's behind

[03:51:34] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:51:45] You can't start a fire

[03:51:50] You still don't get me no girl

[03:51:54] There's a joke here somewhere

[03:51:56] And it's on me

[03:51:57] I save you from all my shoulders

[03:52:00] Come on baby, the last on me

[03:52:07] And you'll be carving you a ball

[03:52:10] And say you gotta stay hungry

[03:52:13] Hey baby, I'm just a fast on the night

[03:52:16] I'm dying through some action

[03:52:19] I'm sick of sitting around here

[03:52:21] Trying to write this book

[03:52:23] I need a little reaction

[03:52:26] Come on baby, give me just one look

[03:52:29] We can't start a fire

[03:52:32] Sitting around trying to get broken heart

[03:52:36] This gun's behind

[03:52:39] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:52:42] You can't start a fire

[03:52:45] We're not about to show a little world

[03:52:48] But in the park this gun's behind

[03:52:52] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:52:55] Baby it's not in the eye of your mind

[03:52:59] But you know you're my fine

[03:53:02] We're better place to play

[03:53:06] You said it should never be

[03:53:10] But everything that you see

[03:53:13] Was lonely fade away

[03:53:17] Wanna start a revolution from my head

[03:53:22] If you said the brains I had went to my head

[03:53:28] Step outside and sometimes in bloom

[03:53:34] Stand up and signify your place

[03:53:37] Take that look from off your face

[03:53:40] You ain't never gonna burn my heart out

[03:53:48] One, two, three, four

[03:53:51] Five, nine and wait

[03:53:55] Take off it from me

[03:53:58] And say walk it on the ground

[03:54:03] So slides away

[03:54:08] To the back of your head

[03:54:11] If you said it sounded beautiful

[03:54:23] Take me to the place where you know

[03:54:27] Where nobody knows

[03:54:31] If it's not a day

[03:54:35] Please don't put your life in the head

[03:54:39] Of a truth he's spent

[03:54:43] Throw it all away

[03:54:47] Wanna start a revolution from my head

[03:55:33] You're so slides away

[03:55:39] To the back of your head

[03:56:18] Take that look from off your face

[03:56:25] Please don't put your life in the head

[03:56:31] It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

[03:56:36] The regular crowd shuffles in

[03:56:39] There's a no man sitting next to me

[03:56:44] Making love to his tonic engine

[03:56:58] He says, son, can you play me a memory

[03:57:02] I'm not really sure how it goes

[03:57:06] But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it'd come clean

[03:57:11] When I worry on the man's clothes

[03:57:15] La la la la la la

[03:57:20] La la la la la la

[03:57:27] Sing us a song, the other piano man

[03:57:31] Sing us a song tonight

[03:57:35] Well we're all in the mood for a melody

[03:57:39] And you've got us feeling alright

[03:57:57] Now John at the bar is a friend of mine

[03:58:01] He gets me my drinks for free

[03:58:05] And he's quick with a joke

[03:58:07] Or a light of your smoke

[03:58:09] But there's some place that he'd rather be

[03:58:15] He says, Bill, I believe this is killing me

[03:58:19] And as a smile ran away from his face

[03:58:23] Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star

[03:58:28] If I could get out of this place

[03:58:31] Oh la la la la la la

[03:58:37] La la la la la

[03:58:43] Now Paul is a real estate novelist

[03:58:47] Who never had time for a while

[03:58:51] And he's talking with David

[03:58:54] Who's still in the Navy

[03:58:56] And probably will be for I

[03:59:01] And the waitress is practicing politics

[03:59:05] As a businessman slowly gets stunned

[03:59:09] Yes, they're sharing a drink

[03:59:11] They call loneliness

[03:59:13] But it's better than drinking alone

[03:59:31] And I'm sure that I could be a movie star

[03:59:35] And I'm sure that I could be a movie star

[03:59:39] Oh la la la la

[03:59:43] Sing us a song, you're the piano man

[03:59:47] Sing us a song tonight

[03:59:49] Well we're all in the mood for a melody

[03:59:53] And you've got us feeling alright

[04:00:01] Oh take a little time

[04:00:11] A little time will look around me

[04:00:17] I've got nowhere left to hide

[04:00:21] It looks like love has finally found me

[04:00:27] Oh la la la

[04:00:29] There's been honey can't paint

[04:00:33] I don't know if I can face it again

[04:00:39] I can't stop now

[04:00:41] How trip was so far

[04:00:45] The chain does lonely love

[04:00:51] I wanna know what love is

[04:00:57] I want you to show me

[04:01:01] I wanna feel what love is

[04:01:07] I know you can show me

[04:01:13] I wanna know what love is

[04:01:19] I wanna know this show me

[04:01:25] I wanna know what love is

[04:01:31] I know you can show me

[04:01:39] There's no good love on a lonely

[04:01:45] Love that you feel new star

[04:01:49] You're just showing me

[04:01:51] I'm feeling so much love

[04:01:53] I know you can show me

[04:01:57] Oh you just can't hide

[04:01:59] I know you can show me

[04:02:05] I know you can show me

[04:02:11] I know you can show me

[04:02:17] I'm feeling so much love

[04:02:21] I wanna know what love is

[04:02:25] I know you can show me

[04:02:47] This room you was bleeding

[04:02:57] You can't see his blood

[04:02:59] It's nothing but some feelings

[04:03:03] And his old dog kicked her

[04:03:07] It's been raining since you left me

[04:03:09] Now I'm drowning in the flood

[04:03:13] You see I've always been a fighter

[04:03:15] But without you I give up

[04:03:19] Now I can't sing a love song

[04:03:23] Like the way it's meant to be

[04:03:25] Well I guess I'm not that good anymore

[04:03:29] But baby that's just me

[04:03:33] Yeah I will love you

[04:03:39] Baby

[04:03:43] Always am I am forever

[04:03:53] The day

[04:03:57] Always

[04:04:01] I'll be there to the start

[04:04:03] No chance to live in the first

[04:04:05] In the worst known crime

[04:04:07] I know when I die

[04:04:09] You alone my mind

[04:04:11] And I love you

[04:04:13] Always

[04:04:21] Now your pictures there

[04:04:23] You live behind all just memories

[04:04:25] Over different lives

[04:04:27] Something made us laugh

[04:04:29] Something made us cry

[04:04:31] We'll then made you

[04:04:33] Have to say goodbye

[04:04:35] When I give to run my fingers

[04:04:37] Through your hair

[04:04:39] Touch your lips

[04:04:41] To hold you near when you see your prayers

[04:04:43] Try to understand

[04:04:45] I've made mistakes

[04:04:47] I'm just a man

[04:04:49] When he holds you close

[04:04:51] When it pulls you near

[04:04:53] When it says the words

[04:04:55] You've been needing to hear

[04:04:57] I wish I was him

[04:04:59] Till the end of time and I

[04:05:03] Will love you

[04:05:07] Baby

[04:05:11] Always am I am

[04:05:17] Forever

[04:05:21] The day

[04:05:25] Always

[04:05:29] It feels so bad

[04:05:31] You're the one who's here

[04:05:33] I tried to

[04:05:35] We can talk

[04:05:37] We can talk

[04:05:55] We can talk

[04:06:25] We can talk

[04:06:55] We can talk

[04:06:57] We can talk

[04:06:59] We can talk

[04:07:01] We can talk

[04:07:03] We can talk

[04:07:05] And I would do

[04:07:07] When you think

[04:07:09] For love

[04:07:11] I could run right into hell and back

[04:07:15] I would do

[04:07:17] When you think

[04:07:19] For love

[04:07:21] I'll never let you

[04:07:23] That's a fact

[04:07:25] But I'll never forget the way you feel right now

[04:07:33] No, no

[04:07:35] No way

[04:07:37] And I would do

[04:07:39] When it sings for love

[04:07:43] But I won't do that

[04:07:45] No, I won't do that

[04:07:51] No, I won't do that

[04:08:21] And someday

[04:08:31] It don't come easy

[04:08:33] And someday

[04:08:37] It don't come hard

[04:08:39] And these are the days and ever

[04:08:43] And someday you'll breathe and fall

[04:08:47] And someday you'll come in nice

[04:08:49] So natural, like nothing I've ever seen before

[04:08:53] We'll again

[04:08:55] And maybe I'm crazy

[04:08:57] Or it's crazy and it's true

[04:09:01] I'm knowing it can save

[04:09:05] And for one I can save

[04:09:07] And now what are you

[04:09:09] As long as the planet is abandoned

[04:09:13] As long as the stars are flooded

[04:09:15] As long as the dreams are falling too

[04:09:19] You've got to believe it

[04:09:21] And I would do

[04:09:23] When it sings for love

[04:09:25] I'll be there till the final act

[04:09:29] And I would do

[04:09:33] When it sings for love

[04:09:35] And I'll take the vow and seal the pact

[04:09:39] But I'll never forget myself

[04:09:43] If we don't go away

[04:09:47] Too late

[04:09:49] And I would do anything for love

[04:09:53] Oh, I would do anything for love

[04:09:57] Oh, I would do anything for love

[04:10:01] But I won't do that

[04:10:07] No, I won't do that

[04:10:11] I would do anything for love

[04:10:15] Everything you have been dreaming of

[04:10:17] But I just won't do that

[04:10:21] I would do anything for love

[04:10:23] And someday you'll be dreaming of

[04:10:27] But I just won't do that

[04:10:29] I would do anything for love

[04:10:33] Anything you've been dreaming of

[04:10:36] But I just want to be there

[04:11:03] I am the human son of what God.

[04:11:13] Instead of Brock is the mass.

[04:11:18] Praisesreck

[04:11:23] Is it still gullible?

[04:11:29] Let me be.

[04:11:33] I'm sorry for all the time

[04:11:35] Some days I just worried if it got a sex

[04:11:38] And drugs and rockin' roads

[04:11:41] And some nights I lose the feeling

[04:11:44] And some nights I lose control

[04:11:47] Some nights I just lose it all

[04:11:50] And I watch it again, sing upon the roads

[04:11:54] And maybe I'm lonely

[04:11:56] You're fine while I'm bad to me

[04:12:01] There's just one and only one and only promise I can keep

[04:12:07] As long as the wheels are burning

[04:12:10] As long as the bars are burning

[04:12:13] As long as your trails are coming to

[04:12:17] You're better believe it than I would know it

[04:12:21] If they were a love

[04:12:23] And you know it's true and that's all fair

[04:12:28] I will do anything for the love

[04:12:32] And I'll never be no turning back

[04:12:38] I'll never do it never

[04:12:40] Never not do it with you

[04:12:43] Oh so long

[04:12:45] So long

[04:12:46] And I will do anything for the love

[04:12:51] Oh I will do anything for the love

[04:12:55] I will do anything for the love

[04:13:00] But I won't do that

[04:13:03] And I'm not alone

[04:13:06] I won't do it

[04:13:07] I won't do anything for the love

[04:13:10] And if anything you've been dreaming of

[04:13:13] But I just won't do that

[04:13:16] I won't do anything for the love

[04:13:19] And if anything you've been dreaming of

[04:13:22] But I just won't do that

[04:13:25] I won't do anything for the love

[04:13:28] And if anything you've been dreaming of

[04:13:31] But I just won't do that

[04:13:34] I won't do anything for the love

[04:13:37] And if anything you've been dreaming of

[04:13:41] But I just won't do

[04:13:44] And if anything you've been dreaming of

[04:13:49] But I just want to live

[04:13:53] I will give this thing to love

[04:13:56] And make you believe

[04:13:59] But I just want to live

[04:14:02] I will give this thing to love

[04:14:05] And make you believe

[04:14:08] But I just want to live

[04:14:12] But I will never stop dreaming of you

[04:14:16] Every night and my life

[04:14:20] No way

[04:14:22] Now I would do anything for love

[04:14:26] Oh, I would do anything for love

[04:14:31] Oh, I would do anything for love

[04:14:36] But I won't do that

[04:14:40] No, I won't do what you raised

[04:14:43] Me up, working to help me down

[04:14:47] When you're getting the ride of this God

[04:14:50] The sink and town

[04:14:51] When you make it all of the rest call

[04:14:55] I can do that

[04:14:59] Oh, I can do what you have

[04:15:02] The sink and the hold me tight

[04:15:05] Can you colorize my life?

[04:15:07] I'm so sick of black and white

[04:15:10] Can you make it all of the rest call?

[04:15:14] I can do that

[04:15:17] Oh, I can do that

[04:15:20] So magic with your own true head

[04:15:24] Can you build an emerald

[04:15:25] Sitting with these grains of sand

[04:15:28] Can you give me something I can take home?

[04:15:32] I can do that

[04:15:35] Oh, I never I can do

[04:15:37] When you pay to every thing

[04:15:41] See I got

[04:15:42] When your whole is made down

[04:15:43] All alone and water

[04:15:45] If I get too hot

[04:15:46] When you take me

[04:15:47] Pleasure's I'll never know

[04:15:50] Now I can do that

[04:15:53] Oh, I know I can do that

[04:15:56] Oh, I would forget everything

[04:16:00] So we've been to Luda

[04:16:02] And I met some of night's flame

[04:16:05] And you see that it's time to move on

[04:16:08] I won't do that

[04:16:13] I won't do that

[04:16:15] I know the territory up around

[04:16:19] It'll all turn to dust

[04:16:21] And we'll all fall down

[04:16:24] Sooner or later you'll be scrolling around

[04:16:28] I won't do that

[04:16:33] No, I won't do that

[04:16:36] If things fall up

[04:16:39] Oh, I would do anything for Luda

[04:16:44] I would do anything for Luda

[04:16:49] But I won't do that

[04:16:54] No, I won't do that

[04:17:02] No, I won't do that
