[00:00] You steal the air and I'm alone, so you make me feel it.

[00:04] I pray for everything we lost by bad to secrets.

[00:08] Your hands forever, so don't take the money.

[00:12] Don't take the money.

[00:15] As anything been happening in the pinball world while I was away in Detroit on a wedding,

[00:28] it looks like a lot has been happening over the last few days.

[00:31] I purposely didn't bring my headset with me this weekend.

[00:35] It's a long weekend, it's a holiday weekend.

[00:38] I think it's a time when everybody out there should turn their computers off,

[00:43] should stop going to the pinside, and should be with friends and family having drinks,

[00:48] being out there enjoying the good weather.

[00:51] And then I can tell that a lot of you did not do that because I've been catching up

[00:57] on what's been going on on the forums and wow, is all I can say.

[01:02] There's a lot of people going nuts and going crazy in the alien thread.

[01:07] And we're going to talk about that on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:11] But before we do that, I want to just sort of go through a few other things that have been happening

[01:16] in the pinball hobby that I've been really impressed with.

[01:20] Number one, Dialbin released a teaser video,

[01:27] sort of like a trailer for the game Dialbin.

[01:30] And I think unanimously people out there really like this sort of cheesy corny introduction to the game.

[01:38] And I think some people have said it.

[01:40] Jack would have been better off just making that video and showing that at Expo when he launched the game.

[01:47] But it doesn't matter. There's a lot of Dialbin excitement because Dialdins are going out.

[01:53] I think the first ones are going to go out this week.

[01:56] We've seen the picture with Pat Lawler standing over the first few games that have been made

[02:02] and seems to be a combination of Ellie's and standard edition Dialdins going out.

[02:07] And look, I think everybody has done a 180 on Dialbin.

[02:15] I think the game couldn't have been launched in a worse way at Expo.

[02:20] And I think since then, you know, people were just like, the theme is terrible.

[02:25] I hate this game. There's no way people are going to be into this theme.

[02:29] And then people started to play it. They started to love it.

[02:32] And the more time people spent with it, the more they realized that this game is kind of what pinball should be.

[02:39] An action-packed experience with a lot of fun stuff going on, magnets, bash toys, fun code, and just great flow.

[02:50] It has almost everything. Yes, I could argue the art could be a little bit better.

[02:55] The theme could be a little bit better. But I give Jack and company credit.

[03:01] This game is phenomenal. It really is.

[03:05] I'm not just chilling the game. If I was the only one saying it, then you could call me a show.

[03:10] But I think everyone who's played Dialdins for the most part has walked away with positive feelings.

[03:15] So we look forward to seeing Dialdins going into boxes on the trucks and into consumer homes.

[03:20] I think we're going to see unboxings in the next week or so.

[03:24] And that's very, very exciting.

[03:26] In fact, I might be going out to Jersey Jack pinball this week to talk to Jack about Dialdins and J.J.P.

[03:34] We'll see if I can take the time off from work because it's a short week.

[03:39] All right, what else is going on?

[03:41] Real quick. Star Wars, the new rumor now that I've been hearing is that June 6 will be the date where Star Wars is announced.

[03:51] I don't know if that's a full reveal, but I keep hearing June 6.

[03:55] I don't believe that date. I just hear it.

[03:59] I've been wrong so many times on when we're going to see Star Wars that sure June 6 sounds exactly like the right date.

[04:08] It also could be the complete wrong date. I don't know.

[04:11] The other rumor I'm hearing is that there will be 800 limited edition versions of Star Wars.

[04:18] I've been told that there's not going to be variations in the limited editions.

[04:24] So you're going to get 800 of the same LE.

[04:29] What does that mean? 400 to the states and 400 go overseas.

[04:34] I still think because Star Wars is such a popular theme, it will sell out immediately.

[04:41] But look, I think like the rest of you, I'm kind of done and fatigued speculating and wondering when Star Wars is going to be revealed.

[04:52] I just want to see it. I don't want to waste any more airtime even talking about Star Wars.

[04:59] So the big thread that was just blowing up, like a toxic waste on this weekend, is alien pinball.

[05:10] And I've been thinking a lot about this thread and I read through everything.

[05:14] I read through everything. I'm going to take you guys through what I believe happened in that thread

[05:20] but continues to happen surrounding alien pinball.

[05:25] And we've discussed this game in highway pinball and Andrew highway many times on this podcast.

[05:31] And I have to say, before I go into why I think it went down the way it went down this weekend,

[05:37] I just want to say that you have to step back.

[05:42] You have to step back from these kinds of threads and you have to step back from these kinds of moments

[05:48] and try to look at this stuff as objectively as you possibly can.

[05:54] And I know that's really hard to do because what normally happens in these threads is you have cheerleaders

[06:02] and then you have people who are cynical, colliding.

[06:06] So you got the cynics and the cheerleaders all in one room arguing it out.

[06:11] And amongst that arguing, it's often times really hard to know who's telling the truth.

[06:19] It's sort of like a courtroom where you've got the defense and you've got the plaintiffs

[06:26] and everyone's presenting their evidence.

[06:29] The problem is so much of what gets thrown into the forums can be false.

[06:35] It can be hearsay, it can be manufactured and it's really easy to take a rumor and run with it as fact

[06:43] and present it as fact and use that as a reason why either to like support a company

[06:50] or to also tear down a company.

[06:53] And I also think with highway pinball, another thing that's really important for people to do

[06:59] is you have to be able to separate your opinions of the game itself from the company making the game.

[07:07] So you might love alien as a theme and you might think the game is great, but that doesn't mean that the company is doing okay.

[07:15] So there's just those divisions.

[07:17] And again, these things are really hard for pinball people to do because they fall in love with a theme.

[07:23] And I also think a lot of these guys out there, right?

[07:26] The Hilton's, the Iceman's, the Wickerman's, the rubber ducks of the world.

[07:31] They pick a side and they vehemently stay on that side regardless of what information is presented.

[07:39] Other than Iceman, who I've given it out to him many times where I think he flip flops back and forth too easily on this matter.

[07:48] But let's walk everybody through sort of what happened this weekend and where we are with with aliens.

[07:54] So quick, quick backstory is aliens have not gone into full-fledged production.

[08:01] Right? People are still waiting for this game to go out in large numbers.

[08:06] Now, Andrew said a few weeks ago that he expected significant amounts of LEDs to go out in June and July.

[08:14] A lot of people question whether or not he would be able to hit those dates.

[08:20] What has happened since then has been the following.

[08:23] And then these are been the trigger items that have created a lot of the conversation.

[08:30] Trigger item number one, CoinTaker, the main distributor for highway pinball.

[08:38] They have not received any of their games.

[08:41] CoinTaker paid in full for 10 aliens.

[08:46] They were told by Andrew to pay in full and they would get their games weeks ago.

[08:51] They have still not gotten their games.

[08:54] Now, okay, so that's trigger item number one.

[08:57] As I go through these trigger items, I just want to ask certain questions.

[09:01] I don't want to make assumptions. I don't want to put words in your mouth.

[09:05] But I think what freaks people out a little bit is how can you have the main distributor for alien pinball not receiving their games after they've paid in full for these games.

[09:19] Why haven't they gotten any of those or received, sorry, any of those 10 games to date?

[09:26] We were told a couple weeks ago that Chris and Melissa over at CoinTaker were going to get five machines.

[09:32] And they had still not received a tracking number for those five machines.

[09:37] And so what people have been wondering and speculating is how exactly does one get an alien pinball machine?

[09:46] Do you get one now if you prepaid years ago?

[09:50] Or do you get one because you give Andrew highway cash up front and you cut the line?

[09:57] And we saw that happen a lot with Jersey Jack and Waz.

[10:00] Now, people have asked Hilton, right, our friend Wysnow on pinside.

[10:05] He says, I didn't pre-order my machine.

[10:08] He's like, I don't put up with that pre-order. I don't do that. I've learned my lesson.

[10:12] Okay?

[10:13] Ironic that he's saying he learned his lesson with pre-orders, especially when he convinced everyone to stay in on predator pre-order and everyone lost their money.

[10:23] So then the simple question becomes, how did Hilton get an alien machine if he didn't pre-order it?

[10:32] So why does he have one?

[10:34] Why do people who paid in full not have one yet? But he has one.

[10:39] So that's a question people have still been waiting for and answer on.

[10:43] But it seems pretty clear that certain individuals who are buddy buddy with Andrew have been able to sort of work out some deals and get games ahead of paying customers who have waited years.

[10:55] So I think that's got a lot of people on edge.

[10:58] I think that's got a lot of people who have waited for a long time sort of scratching their head saying, why does he have one?

[11:05] Why doesn't coin taker have one? What's going on here?

[11:09] Okay, so none of these distributor games get to coin taker.

[11:13] But that's not really what sets off this sort of chain reaction of debate this weekend.

[11:22] The main thing that occurred was this.

[11:24] A gentleman in Florida received an alien pinball machine.

[11:30] He showed pictures of it. It had black armor.

[11:33] He showed pictures of it. It looked like a standard addition alien machine.

[11:38] A few days later, maybe like a week later, he shows new pictures and says, here's my alien Ellie.

[11:46] I have Ellie number 94 and it has green armor on it.

[11:51] And it's signed by Andrew highway on the boxes and it says alien pinball number 94.

[11:58] And people are confused.

[12:00] They are very confused. They don't know where this sort of green trim alien Ellie came from.

[12:09] And this gentleman in Florida, I have to say, I talked to him back and forth.

[12:13] I'm not going to reveal his name, but a lot of you know who he is.

[12:16] He asked me at a respect not to call him out by name.

[12:20] You know, he gave a lot of vague answers.

[12:23] And I think that initial vagueness is really what started to light.

[12:29] The spark that turned into a complete fire in this thread.

[12:35] And he was vague about where he got the green armor, whether or not he did it himself.

[12:41] He eventually admitted that he made the green armor.

[12:44] So this green armor did not come from highway pinball.

[12:48] We all know that the Ellie package is supposed to contain green armor, or blue armor, or black armor.

[12:55] We've yet to ever see highway pinball themselves show us what a green armor game looks like.

[13:01] I don't think one has ever been made.

[13:04] Okay, so he shows this game and people start to lose their shit.

[13:07] Like they're like, they just feel like something is not right here.

[13:10] Right? Something this doesn't feel like this guy is talking honestly about how we got in possession of this game.

[13:17] Long story short, and I'm not going to go through all the back and forth.

[13:21] This gentleman, he powder coated this game himself.

[13:25] He sent the parts out.

[13:27] He powder coated them green.

[13:29] He put them on the game.

[13:31] He powder coated the bolts on the front of the game.

[13:34] Okay, so he has his own sort of do it yourself version of an Ellie.

[13:39] His game does not have the fiber optic ramps that are supposed to be in the Ellie.

[13:45] His game does not have a shaker motor in it.

[13:49] His game does not come with the Brian Allen 35th anniversary translate.

[13:55] He's got the LCD back there.

[13:57] So the question became for a lot of people out there is what exactly does this guy have?

[14:04] And then making matters even worse is he shows this machine and then Hilton chimes in immediately and says,

[14:13] I guess this puts it to rest.

[14:15] The Ellie's have started shipping in May.

[14:19] And that I think that comment combined with this gentleman sort of boasting that he has the first Ellie really created in hysteria in the thread.

[14:32] And I want to explain why what they did caused more harm than help for Andrew Highway and Highway Pimble.

[14:41] Because once you start saying the first Ellie has gone out then everyone who's in on an Ellie fully expects that production has begun on the limited edition versions of Alien.

[14:55] But nothing could be further from the truth with what these gentlemen showed and what they've communicated on the forum.

[15:01] His machine is not an Ellie.

[15:04] Okay, it's not.

[15:06] It's a hybrid.

[15:08] It's this like middle ground.

[15:10] Do it yourself Ellie.

[15:12] Well, let me ask you guys one question.

[15:14] When was the last time you saw someone open up a stern Ellie version of a Pimble machine and there was confusion by the owner and by the community as to whether or not that was an Ellie or not.

[15:31] Did anyone ever open up a ghost busters Ellie and have to go on to the forum and say is this an Ellie? Do I have like what the Ellie should contain?

[15:41] I've never seen anything like this before where we're sort of building the game as we go right.

[15:49] Andrew's building the ship in the ocean and these buyers are basically saying I'll take whatever you have.

[15:57] You can see whatever you got and you can mail me piece by piece the other items that are supposed to go on this machine.

[16:06] So this gentleman in Florida really has an SE that he now has to install the Ellie items onto it to make it a limited edition.

[16:19] That's up to you to you guys out there whether you think that's a good business practice where you think that's really how production should be.

[16:28] I continue to think that that's not the way it should be and that is of concern to me and it should be of concern to people out there who are in on Ellie and Ellie that this isn't really how our production line works.

[16:43] A production line all the parts are in for the game before the line starts for this exact reason so you don't have to go one at a time at a time.

[16:54] You can build 30 at once because all 30 shaker motors are in all 35 are up to kids are in all 30 translates are there and you just go down the line and you put each item in.

[17:07] Okay so this guy does this and it creates a shit storm it creates an absolute shit storm where people are going back and firing all sorts of accusations about what's going on at highway pinball.

[17:21] What's not happening over these few days is there's no communication from highway pinball themselves.

[17:28] Okay now Andrew finally chimes in and I want to read what he says after everyone is waited for some word from them just to ease their anxiety here's what he says.

[17:42] So he starts up by saying thank you to those who have emailed me to let me know about the latest comments on pinside.

[17:51] There has been a lack of communication on our side because a lot is going on behind the scenes and we are hoping to make significant announcement within days.

[18:01] We apologize for this lack of communication but everything will become clear shortly.

[18:06] You should know that there are some pinside here with ulterior motives with an interest in bringing our company down.

[18:14] We would ask for a little more patience please until our announcement is made thanks for reading.

[18:21] Alright so let's stop there and talk about Andrew's first comment because it's it's kind of crazy that so much time has gone on in the threat.

[18:32] It was a few days where people were we're saying a lot of things and there was no correspondence from Andrew.

[18:37] Now what Andrew's response says to me is that these guys now are sort of telling the whole community that they have a big announcement coming and everything is going to become clear when they make that announcement.

[18:53] Now if you go back and read some of Andrew's other correspondences over the months you know months and months ago he always uses this kind of language that something big is about to happen.

[19:04] Now I don't want to speculate on what that is, I can't speculate on what that is, I don't know what it is but I think everybody can agree that this big announcement of his has to be that they've either found someone to buy highway pinball or they've found a significant investor to come into the highway pinball family and to provide financial support so they can get production ramped up where it needs to be.

[19:33] Now I just want to stop there because if Andrew can pull a Jersey Jack move and get an investor or get someone to financially help him get where he needs to be then I think a lot of these problems are going to go away.

[19:48] And I'm not rooting for this company to go under, I'm not rooting for this company to fail but it's at the point where I think if his big announcement isn't an announcement of along those lines.

[20:02] People are not going to buy any other announcement.

[20:09] If it's not that then his announcement needs to be there's 50 games in box ready to go out.

[20:16] So everything hinges on his ability to convince people productions has begun.

[20:24] I do not like that he's blaming pin-siders with ulterior motives for trying to bring his company down and I've said this in the past and I've said it to Andrew Highway because he accused me of the same thing and I've said to him straight to his face the only one who can bring down highway pinball Andrew is you.

[20:45] If you get games out nobody cares what a pin-sider says nobody cares what can he just says on his podcast you have promised these games for years and missed those deadlines and how it's almost like how dare you blame other people.

[21:05] And all the information that people have been sharing whether it's you know Andrew not paying wages Andrew buying a Porsche truck Andrew doing this Andrew doing that Andrew not turning the heat on in the factory Andrew not ordering the fiber optic cables notice how he rarely comes out and

[21:25] sort of shows the truth around a lot of those scenarios you know he there's public records of all how you know of him not paying wages there's public records of the financial troubles of highway pinball so you know Andrew it's not those people's fault it's your company you have total control so I just want to say that I don't like it when the community gets blamed for trying to sort of sabotage this company because remember

[21:54] a lot of the people who have just been asking for refunds have been accused of sabotaging the company and their negativity is dragging down people's confidence but I don't buy that all right so people people kept asking additional questions there's a question about his Porsche and 68 refunds

[22:15] Andrew chimed back in and wrote the following I see how rumors can spiral out of control I wasn't going to comment anymore until the announcement okay so once again this announcement sounds like it's going to be pretty big and pretty positive so we hope that's the case he writes however I will address the issue because it involves personal attacks on me and more importantly

[22:38] upsets paying customers who need to understand the truth about a few things number one I and everyone involved with the company are acting in the best interest of all of our customers to get everyone the games that they have ordered and or paid for all right so let's take number one there all right why would say this the best interest of our customers going radio silence

[23:06] Andrew to so many of your customers for such a long period of time it does not to me show that your behavior aligns with what you said there and we have story after story of people who feel like they've been ignored they haven't been listened to their request for refunds have gone ignored but not just that it's also people who are in on the game who just want to hear from Andrew and company haven't I

[23:35] read a story about some guy who's so excited he made a highway pinball neon sign and ever since then like Andrew took his money quickly and since then Andrew hasn't responded to him at all so when you say you're doing this and acting in the best interest of your customers leaving your customers out to dry going radio silent is not accomplishing that okay his second point is we will not be announcing any new games for the foreseeable future

[24:04] alien gets me now and in the foreseeable future okay well I don't think anyone thought we were going to see game number three I think some stupid rumors were forming that he was going to announce game three take money on it to finish building alien but no way that would ever happen that that I just thought that rumor was was idiotic okay so number three he says I have driven a 12 year old Porsche Cayenne for three years now

[24:33] it has a book value of eight thousand dollars it was least my previous car was a cat sea damaged ex police voxel vector okay so a lot of you know people were like and you went and bought like a new Porsche truck and had to lie some play pinball you know at the same time wasn't paying his employees like there were those rumors that were flying so I don't know I can't I don't I can't

[24:59] dispute this so I'll take him at his word for that number four I don't own a house I rent a house in one of the poorest and most depressed areas of the UK I also don't own in RV all right well I mean when I read that I kind of felt sad I was like man I don't

[25:17] doesn't really sound like where a successful business owner would would live or revealing that he's just like living in this impoverished area of the country he then writes we wish to deal with all outstanding issues once the announcement has been made this will include cancellation requests although we hope the cost that customers will still want this game following the announcement all right so we're we're we're at right now guys and this is just like

[25:47] this is all everything hinges on this big announcement but I'll say this and again I don't want to I don't want to go into any too much of a speculative territory but I'll say this prior to this big announcement there's just been a lot of red flags that have been out there that I think a lot of people have ignored one of them being just customer support for full throttle owners now I know not a lot of people have full throttle

[26:16] but I also heard from Chris from CoinTaker that one of his full throttle customers has had a broken full throttle now for months and Andrew won't respond to all the inquiries trying to get the game fixed now what is this big announcement that's about to happen

[26:36] to do with Andrew taking care of customers who already paid for full throttle who now have broken games and I've heard of more than just one full throttle that is sitting there broken and all inquiries into highway pinball have gone ignored

[26:53] what is this big announcement have to do with people who want their money back when they were promised their money back okay what is it have to do with that

[27:04] what is this big announcement have to do with the radio silence so that's where we're at I mean that's where the that's where the story sort of ends as of today

[27:15] when do we think we're going to get this big announcement is the big question will it come this week will it come next week if our rumors about Star Wars are correct

[27:26] I think it would be I think it would be to Andrew's benefit to tell people sooner than later what the announcement is the reason so because there's a delay if I were to sort of trying guess what's going on

[27:41] it's that he does have some sort of financial or business partner about to come on board and they need to ink out that deal before they can announce it

[27:51] I hope I hope for his sake the deal is kind of done because if I think he comes out and the big announcement isn't along those lines

[28:02] I think the mob is going to be at his gates and I think he's going to have a hard time keeping people confident and keeping people on board

[28:13] but look my overall take on this whole thing is this whole journey to get alien pinball out it's just exhaustive it's it's exhausting it's stressful it's not how pinball should be

[28:31] it's annoying reading the thread reading that thread reading these grown men talk to each other the way they do reading grown men flip flop back and forth it's reading grown men just bragging about their machine knowing that others might be screwed

[28:50] it brings this whole thing this journey to get alien has brought out the worst behavior I've seen in a long time and reading the thread is just depressing waiting years to get the game for a lot of you people out there is depressing having your money locked up with a company like this is depressing

[29:15] it's not the way it should be it's so stupid why I'm losing more faith in the pinball hobbyist I'm losing a lot of faith in you people out there people who read who listen to the show I really you know I don't really get it I don't get it tell me that this hobby these collectors out there

[29:40] they're not how can so many of them just be so ignorant to what's going on and the second so here's the thing to Andrews said this stuff time and time and time again and time and time and time again he fails to deliver on anything he's promised but this time it'll be different he says one thing and then all of a sudden everyone's back on board

[30:09] and I just it's and again like I don't know if his announcement is going to come to fruition or not what I do know is that the majority of people out there are a bunch of suckers when I watch you behave this way when you just jump back on board because the person who's who's lied to you now for for like years and look when I say lie when you say this game is going to ship a hundred in January

[30:38] and then it doesn't is that not a lie when you send people an email saying production is beginning give me more money that was nine months ago is that not a lie what what what is a pinball lie I don't even know anymore I don't even know what you guys out there expect I know that your standards are so low I know that most of you out there you're you're ready for skip B all over again you're ready for jade

[31:08] pop all over again it's like you love pinball so much that you just you you suspend all common sense you love pinball so much that you believe whatever someone tells you when it comes to a pinball manufacturing you believe Dutch pinball with the board issues where's your Dutch pinball game now but yet do people bail do people get out no no they don't because you've you're

[31:37] making a precious pinball machine and and that's what frustrates me the most it's like grow a pair grow a pair grow a sack like when someone keeps misleading you get out or or just say you know what I don't give a fuck I'm just going to stay in it you know whatever but to constantly go back and forth and then to attack the people who are trying to find the truth out and to slam them and call them all sorts of names too

[32:06] you know I saw that too like rubber ducks I didn't even go into rubber ducks guy on there who supposedly signed an NDA who's been like revealing a lot of information about highway so you know he's the bad guy he's immediately the bad guy the same way that people were the bad guy who were questioning what was going on with Kevin Koolik the same way that people were the bad guys who are questioning if John could get it done you know anyone who tries to go get the facts will get the arrows in their backs

[32:35] from these grown men again I really think this hobby's become inundated and maybe it's always been this way with just a bunch of board dudes who have a little bit extra cash and they it doesn't matter I don't think it matters to most you guys what sucks is losing money does matter to some people in on this now look I firmly believe you if you pre ordered a pinball machine and you can accept losing $10,000

[33:04] I also think you're foolish if $10,000 means that much to you in this world that you can't that that that if you if it really hurt you right if it hurts your way of life if if you didn't get your alien pinball machine you couldn't absorb that loss then something is really wrong with you as an adult where you're putting that much of your net worth a new pinball toy

[33:31] all right now everyone can do what you want I get the whole argument you only live once all that yada yada yada but for the most part what I noticed about this hobby especially this weekend lot of lot of dudes with with egos and money and and opinions and these guys they don't give a shit about the facts they don't give a shit about you know you telling them information that could give them an inability to make a world of money

[34:00] and ability to make a wiser decision all they want is their alien pinball machine and they're going to support that desire even if it means ignoring 10 red flags that have been waved so that's where we're at everything hinges on the big announcement what's going to be the big announcement from highway pinball

[34:23] we're gonna we're gonna hope it's something about cash influx okay will it be that what do you think it's gonna be what do you think it's gonna be email me at canada pinball at gmail dot com but that's where we're at when the verge of star wars super exciting

[34:42] where dialed in's are going out super exciting attack from our is remake going out super exciting and the thread that's blowing up is just another depressing threat about a company who can't get production together tired of seeing these threads I can't wait to they can go away so all we can focus on is real pinball people getting real games with their money and then enough of the bickering and then the BS all right I don't like covering this stuff I really don't

[35:12] I really don't I read the thread I'm like oh it's just depressing this is canada episode 127 saying everyone be smarter with your money and stop acting like little kids if you see warning signs say something and then if you want to get out get out and if a company won't let you get out then by all means scream that they're not letting you out

[35:42] and if you're going to say well this proves alien Ellie is shipping in may hilton then I think you need to really really consider the fact that you you really might have an issue bro you really do what you're doing is not is not helping the community

[35:59] all right let's see how this whole thing shakes up I'm skeptical I really am skeptical because I've heard we've heard this so many times I hope I'm proven wrong I hope you guys get your alien machines

[36:11] but man if this news isn't good and June is not a good month for alien I don't know how long you're willing to wait I saw some guy in pinside he said I've given myself a deadline if I don't get my alien by September by September dude this is how beaten down and sackless some of you guys have become by September of 2017 is when this guy has his deadline you know when you're that much of a sucker

[36:41] you might as well put September of 2019 I mean forget it these people why would you give a guy that much leeway it just it just paints you as a sucker that's it I'm done I'm going to have sushi I'm going to go tell bubble he's smarter than half the people in pinball
