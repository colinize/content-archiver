[00:00] I

[00:17] What if I told you that I didn't feel good enough and I'm broken

[00:21] What if I said that I'm losing my faith and it's struggling coping

[00:24] It stuck for a while when I look at the clock man. I feel like it's frozen

[00:28] Then again time is just flying too quick and I'm losing devotion truth is I feel no emotion

[00:33] Bottle it up and all I feel is rage

[00:35] And I will be lying if I looked at you and sit out not afraid

[00:43] It was a week ago Thursday

[00:45] I was editing my podcast on the couch at the exact moment. I started to see something wrong with Bubba and at first

[00:53] I was like all right

[00:54] Just trying to cough something up and within an hour we lost Bubba, you know this this amazing amazing member of our family and like

[01:03] To say crushed me is like an

[01:06] Understatement and for those of you out there who've had a pet and who have loved a pet and understand the amount of love

[01:14] A pet brings into the household you understand

[01:18] What we've been going through over here

[01:20] Five years ago we rescued Bubba and I always say this to Brenda that that he rescued us because he brought so much life and love

[01:29] Into every day. So I just want to thank every single one of you out there who offered their condolences to Brenda and myself

[01:37] We feel your love and we're so happy we have such good friends and such a good community that reached out to us

[01:43] I really do thank each and every one of you for doing it now

[01:47] Life has to go on and I I move on without Bubba and I think to myself

[01:52] I gave him the best life ever and I think fondly of him and he was there with me during every single podcast

[01:59] I've done I mean since I've been podcasting Bubba was always by my side and he's up there in doggy heaven and he's saying right now

[02:07] He's like canada daddy do not do not because I'm gone

[02:12] Stop doing what you do best and so I'm going to give Bubba the greatest news rumors and speculation show because it's what we've always done

[02:21] And so even though I'm not gonna talk as long as I normally do what I'm gonna do on this episode that I want to dedicate to Bubba is

[02:28] I'm gonna spoil so many plans right now and I'm gonna give you news rumors and speculations that you're gonna take to your shows and

[02:37] To pin side and you're gonna say you heard it first on canada's pinball podcast because that's what Bubba would have wanted

[02:42] He would have wanted to know that his daddy was the one who broke the news

[02:46] So what I'm gonna do on this episode is I'm gonna tell you what spooky pinballs next game is and if you've been following me with

[02:53] Mandalorian and everything I said there you will know that

[02:57] Sometimes canada just gets it right and so for those of you out there

[03:01] You're gonna know whether or not you want to go join the fan club or maybe this isn't a title for you

[03:07] I'm gonna talk a little bit about that

[03:08] But we're gonna end this show by revealing what that title is and I have to play it fair if I'm gonna reveal what

[03:13] Stern's next title is I have to do the same for Jersey Jack for American pinball for spooky pinball

[03:20] I can't hold back what I know it's not what I do and I want all of you out there to be as informed as you can as you

[03:28] Think about where you want to spend your money in the pinball world this summer. Okay, let's start out right now by me saying

[03:34] 100% Chicago gaming company does have cactus Canyon coming

[03:38] I know people are starting to spread rumors that cactus Canyon is not coming and that CGC is getting ready to close its doors

[03:45] That is not true. I have 100% confirmation it is coming and it is the most complete and packed game

[03:52] They have ever launched so if you want a cactus Canyon you should wait because it's coming and it's coming soon

[03:59] Now the reason it's not out yet is because of the supply chain issues that are impacting every single manufacturer

[04:06] Okay, so that's Chicago gaming company now. Let's talk about news rumors and speculations for American pinball

[04:11] Here's what I'm hearing is the rumor over at AP when they released Hot Wheels a year ago

[04:18] Guess what their sales numbers were around only

[04:21] 250 Hot Wheels were sold now you could blame COVID you could blame the fact that there were no pinball shows

[04:27] You could blame the fact that there was not a lot of location pinball going on

[04:31] But American pinball when this game tank they were looking in the mirror very deeply and they were actually

[04:38] Considering to close up the pinball operation now. Here's the rumor I heard

[04:42] I'm hearing a rumor that Rob Burke became involved with American pinball and infuse some cash into AP

[04:49] And that is why David Fix was put in charge to look over his money and now we're getting Rob Burke and David fix

[04:57] And they're going after some of the Valley Williams people to try to turn this company around now the other thing

[05:02] I heard too which was very interesting is that the man who saved pinball could also be the reason why Hot Wheels was such a failure

[05:10] And the rumor I'm hearing is that it was Roger Sharp's idea to simplify

[05:15] Hot Wheels and to make it an operator friendly game now. Here's something nobody ever wants to say now

[05:21] Even though Roger is an amazing man and what he did for pinball will never be in question

[05:25] But he actually thinks to be successful in modern pinball times that you need to have games on location

[05:32] Because in his mind how are you going to know you're going to want to buy a game unless you play it on location

[05:38] And him leading them down a road of a simplified Hot Wheels was a huge marketing mistake and Roger doesn't understand

[05:45] That there's something called the internet and we don't need to see pinball's on location to sell pinball machines

[05:53] And if you think about last year a year in which operators were closed down a year in which there were no pinball shows whatsoever

[06:01] What happened Roger to pinball sales they skyrocketed and I think this old guard

[06:07] Needs to step aside because they're leading these new companies astray. They have no idea

[06:13] Had a market a pinball machine in modern times and I don't care

[06:18] Maybe it's my grief that is making me say this but Roger you were wrong

[06:22] Simplifying Hot Wheels was a huge mistake having no loop to loop no jump no car wash

[06:29] Just so you made an operator friendly game. It was never gonna be successful

[06:34] To be successful as a boutique company you need to make games that home collectors and home buyers want and they don't want

[06:43] stripped down games and they don't need to play games on location to buy product

[06:50] 750 Mandalorians just sold Roger with nobody ever playing it nobody ever playing it

[06:58] 750 Rick and Morty's sold Roger with nobody ever flipping it

[07:03] They need to stop thinking it's 1970s. It's not it's

[07:08] 2021 now here is the rumor I'm hearing about American pinball's plans they are getting very ambitious

[07:15] They want to release I am hearing three titles in

[07:20] 2021 now I don't think they're gonna get to this goal

[07:22] But here is what their plans are they are planning to release within June or July

[07:27] I'm hearing June they will reveal their next title which will be a game from a new designer now

[07:34] The question then becomes what title is it? I don't know what it is if I did I would tell you

[07:39] But one can only guess that it must be a title that has been in development from one of these homebrew or boutique

[07:47] Companies I heard the game they're going to release was shown at last year's expo

[07:52] How is this not a riot pinball game?

[07:55] This has to be legends of vahala or like wrath of Olympus. What else could it be?

[08:01] It's not gonna be nightmare before Christmas

[08:03] There's no way they got the license for that Timberton movie. So what other games are out there? Maybe airplane?

[08:09] It's not sonic spin ball

[08:11] So that is their plan they are gonna have a new title from a junior designer

[08:16] They are calling it in junior July that's the plan and then in October

[08:21] They plan to release Joe ball serves game that he was working on that was like the fourth game or fifth game that they

[08:29] Bypassed or whatever it is so what why would they do that?

[08:33] Why would they go back to a Joe ball serve game?

[08:35] But that's the plan I'm hearing a Joe ball serve game in October to coincide with pinball expo

[08:41] And if you ask like what could that game be is it one of those like poker run or Sherlock Holmes or

[08:47] Valkyrie remember those titles they were throwing out there

[08:50] I don't know but that is what I'm hearing that Joe ball serves game that was in development will go on the line and

[08:56] Then a third game which is most likely Dennis Nordmann's game

[09:01] Which is the new sort of regime over at AP they are planning to reveal in December now all this seems like

[09:08] Wishful thinking a company that can't get a new game out is gonna get three out in the latter half of

[09:15] 2021, but that's the rumor I'm hearing so we'll see what happens over at American pinball

[09:20] All right, let's talk about deep root real quick

[09:22] So Robert Mueller gave an update in mid-May which we predict it would be another one of these non-updates now

[09:29] Not only is there no progress or no photos shown of production happening around Raza

[09:36] He now is saying that come June first

[09:39] He is going to start giving refunds for those of you out there who are tired of waiting for this game

[09:46] And the way he worded it was really interesting. It's almost like we're gonna give refunds on a first-com first-serve basis

[09:54] Wow

[09:55] What a confidence

[09:57] Inspiring way to give people their money back

[09:59] I'm just gonna say this to all of you out there because I'm tired of talking about deep root

[10:04] It is a broken record this company. He keeps saying there's progress happening behind the scenes at deep root

[10:09] Guess what he's not showing any of you progress behind the scenes over at deep root pinball

[10:14] He could easily take a photo and show you all of the progress that's been made on this game

[10:19] He's now not even talking about you else certification, which he said he would give us an update on

[10:24] I'm here to tell all of you right now

[10:25] You have an opportunity to get your money back and get it out

[10:29] And it's up to you if you stay in on it now

[10:33] You have nobody to blame but yourself and then I'm just tired of talking about deep root

[10:37] I really am because honestly everything they've said hasn't come to fruition every promise they've made has never come true

[10:44] And so all of the hubris all of the smack talk all of the fact that they were gonna make more games in one year than

[10:51] Everybody else in the pinball industry. It's all bogus. It's all hogwash and Jay pop has done it again

[10:57] He's once again found a way to sort of evaporate millions of dollars from the pinball hobby

[11:03] Because they don't respect manufacturing. It's so easy to design a pinball machine

[11:09] It is so easy to do that. It is so hard to make it and they put all their eggs in the design basket

[11:16] And this is what happens George Gomez and Charlie Emory and everyone over at AP everyone's laughing

[11:23] Everyone's laughing who knows how hard it is to make games and it looks like Mr. Benheck will have the last laugh on all of you

[11:32] In that rasa club thread and you're all starting to look like weird cultists people right now if this is still making you stay in

[11:41] Then something is wrong up in your heads. I mean that all right

[11:45] Let me give you some stern pinball updates real quick too because stern pinball's next game is Godzilla

[11:50] And we're gonna see Mandalorian on Friday

[11:53] But here is stern pinball's schedule of what they will be making coming up

[11:59] So iron maiden will be made again in August they will be making more Batman 66s in July and there will be no more

[12:08] Jurassic parks this year the Mandalorian topper will be out in August

[12:13] They're making lead Zeppelin premiums in June. They're going to make more

[12:18] Star Wars not the comic book edition but regular Star Wars games in September and they're also going to do another run of

[12:27] Monsters in August Elvira is being made this month and there will be no more Star Wars comic book

[12:35] editions for sale and there will be one more run of black night

[12:39] Which means they have black night parts sitting around there will be one more cornerstone game from stern

[12:46] Which will be out in October?

[12:49] Okay, so look for Godzilla in October and that is what is happening at stern pinball

[12:55] You heard it here on canada. All right, let me talk about Jersey Jack pinball rumors now real quick

[13:01] Here is what I heard the plan was for Jersey Jack pinball and it's sort of like an interesting one

[13:06] So they did not expect guns and roses to be this popular and they also did not expect their

[13:12] Manufacturing to be this inefficient the plan for Jersey Jack pinball was to reveal guns and roses release guns and roses produce

[13:20] Guns and roses but also

[13:23] They were planning to make 500 more Wizard of Oz yellow brick roads and those were gonna be the final

[13:30] 500 version of that game they were also planning to do another run of pirates of the Caribbean and they were gonna do

[13:37] 500 more at least of

[13:39] Of pirates of the Caribbean but those plans went out the window because Jersey Jack pinball got upwards of

[13:47] 4,000 orders for guns and roses

[13:50] So what a blessing and a curse it was that Jersey Jack pinball can't make 4,000 guns and roses in a year

[13:58] It's gonna take them almost two years to complete all of those orders and speaking of Jersey Jack pinball

[14:05] If you are on my Facebook page you are seeing me as of today sharing images of

[14:12] Mirko playfields that are falling apart and I'm not just talking about L.E.'s

[14:18] These are collectors edition playfields that are absolutely falling apart where the posts are in the game

[14:25] And I don't mean just a little pooling

[14:27] I mean the artwork and the clear coat is flying off of these playfields

[14:33] And this is another thing that makes me want to take my microphone and throw it out the window

[14:38] How the hell is this still a problem and I give up I

[14:44] Absolutely give up and I think as a consumer I don't know how you don't also give up

[14:51] $12,500 does not equal quality the fact that they have not fired Mirko is a

[14:58] Travesty how many chances is Mirko gonna get to figure this out how many

[15:05] Millions of dollars and I mean this how many millions of dollars of product is now sitting out there in the world

[15:12] Defective because of Mirko and I'll tell you this how many millions of dollars has Mirko made off of Jersey Jack pinball making all of these playfields

[15:21] And it's us the customer who has to suffer those quality issues when you buy a brand new guns and roses

[15:29] It doesn't even matter how many plays it has I don't care if it's 150 plays

[15:34] 200 or 2000 your game should not fall apart like that and

[15:39] Mailing people washers is a pathetic solution and here we are

[15:44] Just taking it and I'm here to tell you right now and again. This is just canada being raw right now

[15:48] The only solution to this problem is you stop buying from this company until they fix this problem

[15:56] And I mean this and it it pains me to say this but until Jersey Jack pinball

[16:01] Announces that Mirko playfield is no longer making their playfields

[16:05] How can you feel good about this and I'm sitting there with a guns and roses collector's edition in a box and I don't want to open it

[16:12] Because I don't want to see what I'm gonna find out and I don't want to start playing my game and every time I play the game

[16:19] I'm gonna be nervous that every single post is gonna be problematic and if you see some of this damage

[16:25] It's not just little bits of damage and I'm just waiting for the communication

[16:30] I'm waiting to see what they're gonna say this time

[16:33] How many titles Jersey Jack pinball does this have to happen on and how many times do I have to do shows about this and

[16:40] How many times do you have to sort of kill the enthusiasm around your brand's product because you continue to work with Mirko

[16:49] And I don't care if this pisses them off over there

[16:51] This is the reason why Jack stopped talking to me and I don't care that other shows think that I harp on this issue

[16:57] This is inexcusable. How can you with good faith by games that are gonna fall apart like this at these prices and

[17:06] Jersey Jack I'm talking to you you can't lock people in with non-refundable deposits if this is the quality

[17:14] It's just that simple you can't do it. How can you do this?

[17:17] How can you say to people we're not gonna give you a refund if people are watching these games fall apart like this and

[17:24] Maybe it's not impacting every single game, but you need consistency

[17:29] There's no way these collectors additions once again should be falling apart

[17:35] We saw it on the collectors additions of pirates

[17:38] We saw it on the collectors additions of Willy Wonka

[17:41] We've seen it over and over again, and it doesn't even matter if it's a collectors edition or an LE or a standard addition

[17:49] Every single play field should be quality. How are you Jersey Jack?

[17:56] Not picking up the phone and calling

[17:58] Bader who is doing the play fields for spooky pinball and saying I don't care what it costs

[18:05] You're now our play field manufacturer Mirko you're done. You're done. I'm sorry. You're done

[18:12] There's absolutely zero faith in a Mirko play field Jersey Jack game now

[18:16] I don't care if they hate me now. I don't care if they don't talk to me anymore

[18:20] But I'm gonna stand up for all of you out there because we're all getting burned

[18:24] We're all getting burned by this German play field manufacturer that has had four or five chances now to fix this problem

[18:32] And it's enough already and every single one every single pinball personality out there. I'm talking to you

[18:38] We need to get them to fix this problem. It's not there's no excuse now

[18:45] Let's talk about something new coming from Jersey Jack pinball

[18:47] So if that wasn't reason enough to buy how about this?

[18:51] So another rumor I'm hearing and he's sort of let the cat out of the bag with one of his posts

[18:57] One of the most talented and Christopher Franchi

[19:00] Thank you so much for reaching out when Bubba passed I really do appreciate it

[19:03] But I have to tell this news and this rumor Christopher Franchi is working on games with Chicago gaming company

[19:09] He's working on stuff with American pinball and I'm here to tell you right now in Canatus pinball podcasts that Christopher

[19:15] Franchi is working on a game with Jersey Jack pinball now

[19:20] What could it be it is not toy story? I have confirmation it is not toy story

[19:26] So that means that Christopher Franchi is working on Eric Minier's next game over at Jjp

[19:33] Now here are the rumored titles. I think there's two that are up in the mix

[19:37] There is Avatar which nobody really wants another avatar. They just don't I get the new movies are coming out

[19:43] But that's not what people want Jack has a great relationship with Warner Brothers

[19:48] There is a little franchise called the Matrix and if Jersey Jack pinball and Eric Minier and

[19:55] Beta playfields

[19:57] Make a Christopher Franchi Matrix. I would send them

[20:03] $20,000 today to secure my collector's edition

[20:06] But I won't do it if Mirko's making these playfields

[20:09] I'm just gonna start saying that now. I won't do it anymore

[20:12] I will not buy another game if Mirko is making these playfields it enough already

[20:17] You know, it's like you see what I mean. It's such a dark cloud that just sits over everything this company does now

[20:23] If your quality isn't there nothing else matters that that's it at the end of the day

[20:28] This industry needs quality for these prices and you can't open up a

[20:34] $12,500 game and have it fall apart and don't think these playfield protectors are gonna save you because the playfield protectors

[20:41] Do not they do not protect your game from the posts

[20:45] So if the posts are digging into that clear code and lifting the artwork that's gonna happen even if you have one of those playfield protectors

[20:52] I loved it when um Christopher Franchi interview George Gomez one of the greatest things Gomez said was how he thinks those

[20:59] Polycarbonate playfield protectors are atrocious

[21:02] I love that he said they were atrocious and he gave good reasons why they screw up the geometry of the game

[21:08] So if you use them I kind of after he said that I was like yeah, he's kind of right

[21:12] But here's what sucks is the reason I had to use it on Batman 66 is that Batman 66 had an atrocious playfield quality as well

[21:21] It cratered so bad it sucks his pinball collectors

[21:25] We either have to like try to preserve our game or watch it fall the part like is there no middle ground and there is a

[21:32] Middle ground and it's called Rick and Morty and Rick and Morty's playfield is perfect

[21:37] It's exactly what we want whatever spooky is doing that is what people want

[21:43] Let's end this podcast right now with spooky pinball's next title

[21:48] I thought this was gonna be Scooby-Doo and I think a lot of you were excited that it was Scooby-Doo now here's what I know

[21:55] I know that spooky pinball is expanding its operation and will be making

[21:59] 1,000 of these games so they're gonna make 250 more than they did of Rick and Morty that this is not gonna be a

[22:08] Mainstream theme like Rick and Morty and I think Charlie is going back to making games for Charlie and I think it's a

[22:16] Marketing mistake and I don't mean this game's gonna be a mistake and I don't mean this game's not gonna be packed

[22:20] But just from a marketing standpoint he has seen the light with Rick and Morty

[22:25] He sold 750 games in one hour simply because he moved away from spooky themed games

[22:33] How do you have the market research knowledge of that and then go back to doing

[22:41] Horror themed pinball machines now Scooby-Doo would have been the best of both worlds now

[22:46] Here's the thing I'm hearing that Scooby-Doo is coming out from spooky pinball

[22:50] But it's not the next game it is in their lineup so if you wanted a Scooby-Doo

[22:56] I'm here to tell you that you most likely will get a Scooby-Doo from spooky pinball

[23:00] But this is an interesting move for Chuck because it really is this company

[23:05] I think kind of looking inward again and I know that bug is gonna start taking over the reins more at spooky pinball

[23:12] And he knows this Charlie son knows this if we want to grow and we want to be

[23:17] Ultra successful we have to stop making games just for us now

[23:23] Do I think they will sell all 1,000 units of this theme?

[23:28] I don't think it's gonna be a day one sell out

[23:31] I don't think it's gonna sell out immediately and I think they're gonna learn a little bit of a lesson here that this kind of theme and

[23:39] This kind of film it just doesn't have the take my money now kind of feeling to it

[23:46] It might for some of you out there and I'm not here to say like you're wrong for loving this

[23:51] But when I did like all of my top themes they can make for pinball machines beetle Jews big trouble and little China

[23:58] Nightmare before Christmas Edward Sizzarhands Phantom of the Opera when I think about all the things that are kind of like could be in that realm of like

[24:06] Spooky quirkiness this wasn't one of them this wasn't even on any of those shows I've done

[24:11] This is what they want to make I'm gonna end this podcast by sharing with you

[24:17] Spooky pinballs next title. I want to thank all of you out there for your condolences

[24:22] It's really hard for me to even do these shows. I hope you don't sense I'm too negative or down and out

[24:28] But I'm going through a lot and pinball is really

[24:32] Meaningless in the larger scheme of things and I hope you all understand that the only thing that I love about pinball

[24:39] Other than playing the games which is fun. It is fun. The only thing that makes pinball worthwhile

[24:45] Are the people in it. That's it without people in this hobby without the friendships we've made

[24:52] These games are not worth the effort. They're not worth the time and they're sure as hell not worth the money

[25:00] All of these people are spending on these things

[25:02] I spent

[25:03] 150 bucks on Baba and someone could have knocked on my door and offered me a million dollars and I would not have given Baba up

[25:12] But all these games you'd all give them up for a certain price and you play them and half of you out there

[25:19] You know who you are you don't even turn your games on it's fun to talk about this stuff

[25:23] It's fun to speculate about this stuff, but it doesn't really matter

[25:27] Right him all doesn't really matter that much in the larger scheme of things now

[25:33] friendship matters loyalty matters trust matters and you can trust canators pinball podcast that I am going to give you

[25:42] The news rumors and speculation that nobody else will say because now they're going to be pissed at me over in Benton, Wisconsin

[25:50] And I don't care now

[25:52] They're going to be pissed at me over at Jersey Jack pinball and I don't care because I want to give you the

[25:57] information you need to make the right decisions in this hobby and I want to talk about this hobby

[26:03] Without any fear because it doesn't matter. It's just pinball love matters and life matters have a good day everybody

[26:11] This is spooky pinball's next title

[26:19] Dr. Simpel bonus
