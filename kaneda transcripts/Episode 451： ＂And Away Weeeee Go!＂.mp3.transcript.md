[00:00] Right now the Stranger Things owners their soundtrack sounds like this

[00:16] And then meanwhile over in the Rick and Morty Club today this is what their soundtrack sounds like

[00:30] Well the weight is over all of the speculating all of the hype we finally today got to see Rick and Morty

[00:43] Pimball being played by Chuck and company over at spooky Pimball and we're gonna talk about that on this

[00:50] episode of Canadian Pimball podcast because this really is day one for us to see what this game is

[00:58] gonna be like from a stream level we have to clarify that but the reason why the reason why I started this

[01:05] podcast with the tail of two game releases I mean it's unavoidable. Stern Pimball in one corner with

[01:11] Brian Eddie and Stranger Things Charlie Emory in the other corner with Scott Denise and Rick and Morty

[01:18] my god it couldn't be polar opposites in terms of how these launches are being received by the

[01:25] community and we're gonna talk about that and why we think it's going down this way on

[01:29] Canadian Pimball podcast okay let's go away we go now the first and foremost the one thing that

[01:37] I think jumps out immediately when you see a stream of this game is that the theme integration

[01:43] the theme integration is phenomenal right the music the sounds the light show the clips everything

[01:52] that you would want from a theme integration standpoint almost everything I'm gonna clarify that

[01:58] I think almost everything you'd want from a theme integration standpoint is found in this game and

[02:05] it just it it sort of lives up to what we heard from our friends over at the poor man's Pimball podcast

[02:10] that it does feel like you're being dropped into an episode of Rick and Morty and from the moment you

[02:16] plunge from the moment you hear all of those funny Rick call outs and you hear Morty oh gosh you

[02:22] know it's like come on Morty you you know and I don't even want to spoil the phrases I didn't even want

[02:28] to watch the stream because I didn't want all the jokes to be old by the time I got my game but man

[02:34] this is what we just want in Pimball I mean it's not that hard I think we've we've experienced

[02:40] so many years and so many games with lack luster theme integration that it's just so refreshing to turn

[02:48] on a Pimball machine and not have to sacrifice the things you want to see from that theme being given

[02:56] to you in Pimball format now the reason why I said I think it almost gives you everything you want

[03:02] in terms of theme integration I have to I you know I have to be balanced here I still think that

[03:07] on a mechanical level on a mechanical level I mean there's not many toys in the game and you know

[03:13] and in Rick and Morty the portal and going through it and entering other dimensions it seems to be

[03:19] connected mostly through the lights the music and the LCD but in terms of like physical things

[03:26] that are that are transporting you into the world of Rick and Morty I do think this game comes up

[03:31] short if that's what you're looking for but and this is a big but but the theme integration

[03:37] in what it's giving us is so awesome it reminds me it does it reminds me a lot of Batman where there's

[03:44] not a ton of stuff going on physically on the play field itself but because everything else is

[03:50] delivering the theme to you in spades like there's so much of the theme coming at you that you're

[03:57] almost willing to forgive the lack of physical physical elements in the game that are like

[04:04] mechanical toys inspired by the world of Rick and Morty because it doesn't have a lot of that

[04:08] okay I just to go down a list of few things like the light show we all knew the light show is going

[04:13] to be incredible the light shows phenomenal look at the light show when this game is about to go into

[04:18] multi ball and just like the way it sweeps across with like the white and the red the full RGB lighting

[04:25] in full effect in full Scott Denise E. Glory looks incredible should we talk about how that looks

[04:32] in comparison to stranger things which just everything just seems to light up and it doesn't really

[04:36] have that sort of same level of coolness or synchronicity synchronized is that even a word

[04:44] but you know what I'm saying it just it just works perfectly and this is code one this is day one

[04:50] code they've got 18 months to polish this game and there's much more coming and on day one release

[04:58] it looks really good and here's what I love to here's what I love to about this game here's what I

[05:03] love you hit start and all of a sudden you're in the garage and you're going on adventures as

[05:12] Morty right there's no confusion there's no pick 22 characters now there's no like ambiguity

[05:21] about what this game is about immediately you know what you're supposed to do in this game

[05:27] and I've always said it like pinball should be simple to get into the game it should be challenging

[05:34] to beat the game and it's okay if there's some tough shots like pinball is inherently hard for

[05:39] most people but it shouldn't be challenging to understand what to do in a pinball machine and I

[05:46] think spooky pinball is schooling some of these other companies that have been releasing games

[05:52] where when you turn them on you're absolutely clueless about what to do in the game and and I just

[06:00] love the simplicity of it let's talk about just the clips like like I just like when I was watching

[06:05] Worley Durley mode it was awesome and the way they integrate it the Worley Durley scene from

[06:11] you know from the show and you're hitting the orbits which is like going around the loops

[06:16] on the Worley Durley like it makes total sense and it works perfectly and it looks gorgeous you

[06:23] know imagine remember like the remember the roller coaster animations from October Fest compare that

[06:30] those animations to the animations in Rick and Morty in which you're on the Worley Durley now

[06:35] albeit yeah they're they're using footage from the show and the shows a multi million dollar

[06:41] property that has very talented animators behind the scenes but but that's that's the benefit

[06:48] of getting a license in which you can use the assets properly in your pinball machine and you know

[06:55] I never felt like we were going from the show to like spooky game it felt like it was all connected

[07:04] and I love that about it it didn't feel like oh here's some clips but then like the you know

[07:09] the main screen doesn't seem like it fits it because it it's all the same style of animation

[07:15] it's I think everyone's just trying to like articulate that they're really excited that

[07:20] this game feels like it's living up to a lot of people's expectations and you know I've been

[07:26] covering this hobby for a long enough time to know that whenever a game is revealed for the first time

[07:32] there's always a bit of a letdown for the most part it's rare that a game is shown to the world

[07:39] and it's received with a lot of enthusiasm and applause now I'm gonna play devil's advocate the

[07:46] majority of people in the Rick and Morty thread right now that are cheerleading the game are

[07:52] probably buying one and we see the same thing in the stern threads like when people are buying

[07:58] a stranger things you hear much more of a positive slam by the buyers now what will objective

[08:06] third party people think of Rick and Morty pinball who are who don't have a skin in the game

[08:11] I think you'd be hard to look at this game the way it is right now and not get excited about it

[08:18] and not look at it like this looks like a really fun pinball machine and ultimately come to the

[08:24] conclusion that spooky pinball has a hit on their hands and all 750 selling out in four hours

[08:33] I think today felt justified I think you watch this you're like I see it I see it now why people

[08:40] really want this pin in their collection I mean not to mention like when the Rick callouts are so

[08:46] funny I mean this game is really going to stand out in a lineup of pinball machines simply because

[08:54] of the personality of this machine have we ever seen and I'm asking you guys out there have you

[09:00] ever seen any of these modern games based on these big properties have you ever seen them utilize

[09:05] callouts as well as Rick and Morty again it reminds me of Batman because they got Burt Ward and

[09:12] Adam West to do a lot of custom pinball callouts think about how bad the callouts are in stranger

[09:20] things they're horrible they have no emotion there's no passion there's no energy it's just they're

[09:25] just it's like they they've they've phoned it in and they didn't even get creative with the script see

[09:31] that's the thing it's like Rick and Morty lends itself to getting really fun and whimsical and like

[09:38] super super like a reverent around pinball it's almost like Rick is standing over your shoulder

[09:46] and you're Morty I mean that's what it feels like when you when you watch this gaming play like

[09:50] Rick is over your shoulder calling you a piece of SHIT and you're like you know and you're like

[09:55] you're Morty with your hands like trembling trying to hit the shots I think it's great all right

[10:00] so the theme integration for now it looks like an eight or nine out of 10 again I can't give it a

[10:06] perfect theme integration because the lack of toys you know I didn't really see I didn't see

[10:10] many people hit the garage portal to then go through the subway out to the left flipper I don't

[10:16] even think I saw that shot once I don't know maybe I missed it but it is what it is okay so as

[10:21] everything roses now there is one big shot in this game that has a lot of people wondering if

[10:29] whether or not it has to do with the spinner location it's the upper right flipper the shot from

[10:36] the upper right flipper to the left orbit that comes off the upper right flipper it's it's kind

[10:42] of clunky it didn't always even what seemed like a smooth shot it seemed to rattle around and come

[10:50] back down a lot so will that shot that we know people are going to rip around rip around is it

[10:56] going to be a very hard to hit shot is there something that they need to tweak to make that smoother

[11:02] I think that shot out of all the shots in the game seemed to be the one that just didn't seem

[11:08] right it just didn't seem the flow right and I hope there's a maybe they just sucked at playing

[11:13] it you know these aren't the best players and they'll openly admit it and also you know it comes

[11:18] to those like upper flipper shots like who amongst us hasn't played iron maiden and when you first

[11:24] play it the first few times you kind of suck at it but these aren't people playing it the first

[11:30] few times these are the guys who made the game so they've played it a lot so I think that has some

[11:34] people concerned the pop bumper the pop bumper slaying it's cool it's cool it's absolutely neat it

[11:42] it adds a new level of chaos and energy to the game I like that it has the feature the slap save

[11:49] feature so that if it hits it and slaps it right down the middle if it does it quick enough it will

[11:54] save your ball for you I know some people have issues with that but I think you do have to if

[12:00] there's a part of your game that can create a completely unfair drain I think it's so smart of

[12:06] them to think that through and to actually code into the game itself a way to save the game one

[12:12] of the features that you know this feature like even every time I see it it's always a little

[12:17] underwhelming and and I don't even know like if it works extremely well and that's the magnus

[12:22] save on the right side I know it's there it reminds me a lot of the Magnus save in black night and

[12:28] in magic girl had one and there's just something about that Magnus save that when the balls traveling

[12:35] really fast I always feel like it won't grab the ball it only really works when the balls sort of

[12:41] you know moving slower and going back and forth between the out lane and the in lane so I don't

[12:46] know I'm curious to see how satisfying and how useful that Magnus save is because it is one of the

[12:52] neat features of the game and one of the Neater toys so more to come on that but overall overall

[12:59] I think you have to walk away from Merkin Morty Pimball feeling like spooky has once again delivered

[13:07] another great moment for people who have been excited about this game I think everyone's been

[13:13] waiting for the moment in which the hype isn't real in which we're underwhelmed by something but

[13:19] I don't think today's that day and I've been reading and I think it's good I think look all of

[13:24] us love Pimball and we want we want to be excited about games we want to we want themes that

[13:30] excite us we want games that are fun to shoot but most importantly I think we want themes that are

[13:36] integrated the proper way with Pimball and and I still go back to this it's like will he want could

[13:43] just have the right integration I have one right here I could walk over I could touch it I can

[13:49] make love to it it would be in my home this is what I want I don't want to see a show or a movie

[13:58] integrated poorly I don't want to play Pirates of the Care being without Captain Jack Sparrow I don't

[14:04] I don't want to play Alien without Ripley I don't care how creative they got to make up for those

[14:11] lack of assets I'd rather just get a game with the assets with the things I love working with the

[14:18] show creators making those amazing callouts if I were to summarize where I think most people are

[14:24] with this game right now and maybe this is jumping the gun but I'm starting to feel this this is

[14:30] starting to feel like a special game it's starting to feel like a game we've all been waiting a long

[14:37] time to get and again I can already hear some of the people being like it's just another spooky what

[14:43] are you talking about it doesn't have the complexities of a Jersey Jack machine it doesn't have the

[14:48] innovation and and those people they are correct this machine is lacking it is heavily I mean

[14:56] seriously put it next to a dialed in a pirate to the Caribbean put it next to a Willie Wonka or

[15:02] Wizard of Oz right put it next to some of Stern's like Jurassic Park put it next to a pirate you

[15:08] know there's you're you're gonna look at this game and you could look at it and say it's missing

[15:13] stuff but I think what it's bringing to the pinball world a lot like TNA did it's bringing an

[15:21] experience that so many of us have been missing from pinball and it's bringing a world to life in

[15:31] a way that even though it's not as mechanically complex it's still a cheese the ultimate fun factor

[15:39] for that theme in pinball form for people and again a lot of this is like way too early to tell

[15:45] off of a 15 minute stream but I think you'd be hard pressed not to look at this game and just

[15:51] walk away saying it looks like a damn fun game it looks like perfect theme integration for for the

[15:58] for Rick and Morty fans and if you're just a fan of pinball and you love shooting pinball machines

[16:04] it's gonna be a hoot it's gonna be a hoot to play getting one I think after today gets harder

[16:12] I do I don't think this is Alice Cooper like all over again I don't think this is TNA I don't

[16:18] think this is Rob Zombie getting a Rick and Morty is gonna be more difficult for people I don't

[16:23] think people are gonna let it walk but it won't be impossible to get trust me you weigh the thousand

[16:29] or two thousand dollars over MSRP people will sell you their spot this game won't be as exciting

[16:36] six months from now a year from now it's just the reality but right now this is the hot game

[16:44] and this is not me showing it because I'm not flipping it I'm not showing it because I'm not

[16:49] selling it to you as a distributor I'm just saying within the community this is the hot title right

[16:54] now this game makes stranger things feel like it never came out it's weird it's absolutely weird to

[17:03] me and and I'm looking at both games I've watched both games now being played and I think stranger

[17:08] things is a game of like more of excuses and an apologies than it is about like people marveling

[17:16] on how they did what they did I just don't think it's impressing people I don't think people are

[17:21] really happy with it but Stern has a big army of fans and they're they're very very vocal and

[17:29] they come to the defense of every single Stern machine and I've said it I've said it from the very

[17:34] beginning stranger things is gonna go down as one of those Stern machines that you quickly forget

[17:40] I don't think Rick and Morty is gonna go down as a machine we quickly forget if you disagree

[17:45] hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com all right all right so what's left now well Charlie's

[17:51] gonna stream it on adult swim tomorrow and then people have to get their games I mean that's

[17:57] the next big moment is these games are gonna be going out now I have I've switched I'm gonna

[18:03] give you guys a little update I've switched my coin door from black to purple I was gonna go black

[18:10] I gave my reasons why but then I saw new images of how the purple looks when the lockdown bar

[18:17] is on and the legs are on and I went with the purple coin door now here's what I want to say about

[18:24] this experience of buying a spooky machine I've bought a spooky machine I bought a Stern machine

[18:31] I bought a used Stern machine I bought a magic girl machine here's what I love about the spooky

[18:38] buying experience I'm buying a game from them they're making 750 and I'm talking to I'm talking

[18:47] I think it's Morgan Emery let me just make sure because we've had an amazing in amazing as Morgan

[18:53] Emery and I have had an amazing 17 email chain back and forth asking me about what options I would

[19:00] like the coin door back I've been going back and forth she's been nothing but cordial and sweet

[19:08] and so nice in terms of helping me figure out how I want to option out my machine and I'm just

[19:14] here to tell you this why is it that I can option out my machine and get immediate emails back

[19:22] from someone helping me customize my machine exactly how I would like it when I buy a spooky

[19:28] pinball machine for $78,000 but when I buy a $15,000 from Stern pinball they won't let me choose

[19:37] any options they don't let me paint the coin door they don't let me add this or add that absolutely

[19:45] nothing and I'm just here to say that I think this game represents more than just a hit for spooky

[19:53] I think it represents what so many of us pinball buyers just want we want to feel good about the

[20:01] company we support we want to option these games out so they can be the way we would like them

[20:06] and you could go further with options but you can't go too far because then it slows down production

[20:12] but at least they allow you the opportunity to add some things to your game that you would like

[20:19] and Stern pinball has been just doing this one model over and over and over again and I just start

[20:25] I think it's starting to wear thin a little bit I do now look it doesn't matter they're going to sell

[20:32] their thousands of stranger things they're going to sell thousands of Ninja Turtles they're going

[20:38] to sell this they'll sell that they'll put this back on the line when that doesn't sell well it's

[20:43] what they do but I don't care anymore what the big guy does I really love what the little guy

[20:51] has done and I think the response from people isn't indicative of that I think spooky has done

[20:58] something that a lot of us have been hoping someone other than Stern would do I think this is a

[21:06] awakening and should be an eye opening launch for Jersey Jack pinball and Jersey Jack's

[21:13] complexity you know Jersey Jack again they give everything but they fall down on making the games

[21:19] as immediately fun and rewarding I mean think about this stream in five minutes you're going to

[21:24] get more out of that then you would I mean try to stream like Willy Wonka in five minutes or stream

[21:32] Pirates of the Caribbean and you're like confused and yet with Rick and Morty it just makes sense

[21:38] it like clicks right away what you're supposed to do and I think Jack needs to wake up a little bit

[21:44] and understand that sometimes you can go overboard sometimes you can try to try to do too much in

[21:50] these games and sometimes you're just you know you're letting everyone go wild when really just

[21:56] just make a fun pinball machine if you make a fun pinball machine that gives people what they want

[22:02] you'll be successful and this is proof of that am I wrong am I right well okay well what else is

[22:08] going on so here's here's I don't think slash is going to be at tpf I'll tell you why because guns

[22:14] and roses is playing lala polusa like the 24th and 27th or something so I guess I missed those

[22:21] lala polusa dates so it's highly unlikely that slash will appear a tp have to unveil guns and roses

[22:28] but man you know again like I'd hate there's going to be pressure on all these games to deliver

[22:34] this kind of excitement what else is going on so I heard American pinball this is confirmation

[22:41] they're working on two new titles that are pretty much going to be completed simultaneously

[22:48] so hot wheels and something else have been in development side by side so what do you think the

[22:56] side by side game is will American pinball finally have a hit will they have the success that

[23:03] Rick and Morty has had hot wheels ain't it we know that but what else do they have you think uh

[23:09] Sherlock Holmes Robin Hood Valkyrie or is it something completely else I don't know here's what I do

[23:17] know it's still the same team over to American pinball they didn't bring in anyone new so the

[23:24] common sense in me says if you've got the same team who launched two flops two flop albums why would

[23:35] the third and fourth be hits unless they brought in someone new to make new decisions and that's

[23:41] just how I feel about it let me tell you how many times my phone rang after after I offered to

[23:47] help them out zero all right I don't know man I wouldn't have I just wouldn't have gone down

[23:52] down that road of hot wheels but they're they're in it all right what else is going on Dutch pinball

[23:57] launches a photo of big Lebowski playfields on Facebook and immediately everyone starts clapping

[24:03] congratulations congratulations people wait a minute think about this this what is this show

[24:10] okay so there they've got some playfields show us the real production tell us how many games

[24:17] a week you're making give people who got burned a timetable in which they can expect their game

[24:24] Barry but here's the problem with Lebowski it's very simple if he makes tweaks if he makes tweaks

[24:30] to this game and improves upon the a r a games then what does that mean to the value of those a

[24:36] r a games so I'm happy I sold mine I got to be honest I'm happy it's gone so what does that mean

[24:41] is he gonna retrofit new games with new stuff and then if he keeps making them let's just total

[24:46] to be honest the value of Lebowski's the value of them at 12 the 15,000 was because they weren't

[24:53] making that many now if they keep making them what does that mean for the value of them they're

[24:59] starting to lose their their specialness it's starting to feel like a game that came out so long

[25:05] ago that has such a dark cloud over it and look at Rick and Morty no dark cloud nobody feels bad

[25:12] about buying one everyone that buys one feels great the company that makes it feels great you

[25:19] feel great supporting them nobody feels that way around the big Lebowski nobody it's just it's

[25:26] just not how anyone wants to enter into an agreement with a pinball company and what is Dutch pin

[25:32] bar they are real company now do they have customer service do they have coders like what's going on

[25:38] bear you know I want to see Dutch pinball on a door somewhere on a building is it a real company

[25:44] or is it just more of what we got with Andrew highway which is just slowly trickling out images

[25:52] to make us believe everything is going great but who knows they might be sinking behind the scenes

[25:56] I don't know I don't know but I would love to see more from them and they need to over communicate

[26:01] okay so I gave up my royal edition of medieval madness remake in favor of Rick and Morty

[26:09] and it wasn't even a hard decision there's just something about there's there's enough medieval

[26:14] madness is everywhere I can play it in almost every single arcade barcade home collection

[26:20] and I could always get one I could always find a way to get a medieval madness even a royal

[26:27] edition let's not fool ourselves like 500 royal editions they're going to be available

[26:32] and I just I just wanted something new something fresh now I know it's apples to oranges I mean

[26:39] medieval madness has one of the greatest mechanisms in pinball history if not the greatest

[26:44] but it's kind of I just think for a home use game where I'm only going to have one game for a while

[26:51] I think Rick and Morty is the better buy for me I really do and so I'm happy to get it I'm all I

[26:57] look I think everyone who gets the royal editions is going to be super satisfied and my spot got

[27:02] gob gobgo gobbled gobbled up immediately so it wasn't like it was hard and and Joe new heart was

[27:08] amazing it was like I he found someone to take my spot in like a nanosecond so it's gone all right

[27:13] what else so I asked people on Facebook and then I'll end this episode of Kinne just pinball

[27:18] podcast I asked them to tell me on my page what they thought of the Rick and Morty stream today

[27:24] here's what people who are out there thought of a thought of the stream you know before we do

[27:31] this feedback I want to say congratulations on a final episode to special winlitt to Kenon

[27:38] Bell over there special winlitt pinball podcast they did their final episode today and I've always

[27:44] been a big fan of Ken and Bill and I'm going to be sad to see special one lit go away in podcast

[27:51] form but I'm excited to see what they do moving forward I know Ken's going to be on a show with

[27:58] Zach many coming up soon so we look forward to checking that out all right so here's what I said

[28:03] I said and away we go tell me your thoughts see my voice cracked there I got 12 comments let me

[28:10] just read all them is what I'm doing then the show is going to be over then you're going to be back

[28:14] I feel like I get more people are listening more frequently now because there's no more pinball

[28:18] podcast out there okay so Chris Leonhart said have to stay I was pretty impressed overall the theme

[28:26] integration was spot on the call outs were great and will only get better the light show was

[28:33] awesome especially when multi ball started with the spotlight effect couldn't help but notice

[28:39] that nobody could hit the garage shot but who wants the game that you can just rip every shot

[28:45] with ease I like a challenge all right yeah I didn't see the garage shot either Chris it's I mean

[28:51] it shouldn't be too hard because isn't going into the garage would start you into different

[28:56] dimensions and that's the other thing we saw modes being started but we didn't see people starting

[29:02] different dimensions so hopefully it's not too hard to start those alternate dimensions let's see

[29:07] Alex RC wrote the garage shot from the upper flipper was never hit in the game it can also be

[29:14] accessed by hitting the right orbit which also looks tough but was hit twice in a row to start

[29:21] pickle Rick mode so I have less concern the loop shot was hit several times but wobbled out

[29:27] at the spinner maybe a real issue or fixed in production already I also saw it hit smoothly a

[29:34] couple times but it is a concern to see the wobble issue the light show is insane the spotlight

[29:41] effect was awesome the sound was amazing theme integration is jaw dropping I just hope I can

[29:49] make it easy enough to progress and see enough of it I agree nobody well you see the thing is this

[29:56] is like if some of these shots are impossible to hit you can't have that because you're going to

[30:01] have to hit some of these shots to finish modes and to get through the game so I doubt Scott

[30:08] and easy made it impossible John over at Jack bar he wrote here's my thoughts I'm about to be

[30:16] 6k poorer well John you said it right you didn't get any options brother you just bought the base

[30:22] machine see John's going to put this game in Jack bar he's number 26 so he's going to get his game

[30:28] on location his his will be the first game I play a David Rendon said totally surprised on how

[30:35] bad as the light show is Quinn day lows Gabriel said needs more god damn toys well Quinn you're right

[30:44] but here's the thing ain't happening so this is this when it comes to toys on a game we'll use the old

[30:50] phrase from the Jersey Jack team what you see is what you get ain't no one adding any more toys

[30:56] but Chuck did explain how there's going to be much more interactivity with what's in the game

[31:02] there now and I don't think we're seeing all of it uh let's see Michael Raymond said this is how

[31:07] you do theme integration I agree now Robert Brooks gave me five pros and cons his pros are the light

[31:14] show is good play field colors better than I thought the pop bumper where sling could go is cool

[31:21] and fast when the pinball hits it the sounding callouts are pretty decent and the magnet save is

[31:26] cool his cons are it still looks cheap when the ball is plunged it basically goes nowhere the left

[31:34] loop from the upper right flipper did not look smooth no bash toy an upper middle of play field

[31:41] still looks empty all right well look Robert I think I kind of agree with your pros and cons

[31:49] and again you know there's just some parts of this game that you either like or don't like and I

[31:54] think one of them is going to be the amount of interactive stuff in the game and we've heard

[31:59] Scott talk I mean a lot of the stuff is off the shelf pinball parts I mean if you look at the game

[32:05] did they really engineer a major toy not really so you have to you know you have to understand that

[32:14] like this isn't the most mechanically innovative game by any means but I think they make up for it

[32:20] in how they integrate it the theme again it reminds me a lot like Batman in that respect okay

[32:25] Jeff Wilson said I just got the last spot at a distributor thanks to that video the video made me

[32:33] feel like a year from now the game may be in Jjp Pirates of the Caribbean situation all right and then

[32:39] Tom George said what an incredible accomplishment for spooky Scott Denise and all the rest of the crew

[32:48] yes I agree this is a great day for them it's been a great probably two months for these guys

[32:54] they're crushing it selling millions of dollars of games in four hours so that's it ladies and

[33:00] gentlemen we finally got to see Rick and Morty we don't know for sure if we're individually going

[33:08] to love it until we all stand in front of one and play it but I have to say this I'm more excited

[33:14] after seeing the stream than disappoint it when it came to stranger things complete opposite I was

[33:21] more disappointed than than excited and that's where we are in pinball there's gonna be great games

[33:28] mediocre games and bad games now the good news is we have tons of options and I think everyone is

[33:36] just happy to see this game sort of come out of nowhere like in December this game came out of

[33:42] nowhere and all of a sudden it starts to feel like it could be one of the sleeper hits of 2020

[33:49] unbelievable now more to come lots of games coming out this year lots of activity happening in March

[33:55] how long will the spooky and Rick and Morty enthusiasm and hype train last so we'll see but they

[34:04] they've done everything perfectly up to this point and I think people are having an amazing time

[34:10] support that supporting this company and I just don't feel that same enthusiasm hitting the

[34:16] shores of stranger things right now I don't see the same enthusiasm in the Willy Wonka you know

[34:22] thread right now and and I think this is just gonna be a game that took a different approach

[34:28] isn't isn't the huge world under glass that I you know I'm always looking for but I think it

[34:34] just integrates one of the coolest and fun cartoon shows and brings it to life in such a unique way

[34:40] I think people are gonna love it I just think they're gonna love it and I think some people might

[34:45] hate it and it's all right I respect both people's opinions everyone have a great day thank you for

[34:51] putting up with canadus pinball podcasts this is my midweek edition maybe I need to start like
