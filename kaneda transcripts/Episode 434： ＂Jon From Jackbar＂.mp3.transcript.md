[00:00] I know a place where I can go, where I belong.

[00:07] It's here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

[00:12] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:16] Welcome to episode 434 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:24] We have to congratulate Ken and Bill at Special When Lit.

[00:28] They're fundraiser, along with Adam Schwartz's contributions made over $50,000 for Project Pimball.

[00:37] Incredible.

[00:38] I did not get the Stranger Things video from Stern's Marketing Department.

[00:44] We are not in Kahoot's.

[00:46] It was funny that they put up the teaser video after we already gave the world the actual reveal video of the game itself.

[00:55] But on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, we're going to take a little bit of a pause from the Stranger Things madness, from the Rick and Morty madness.

[01:03] And we're going to interview someone who I think has a very, very interesting perspective on Pimball.

[01:09] He is John the proprietor of Jack Bar in Brooklyn, New York.

[01:15] And just to get sort of an operator's point of view on this hobby was really something I've been wanting to do for a long time.

[01:22] So I think you're going to love this interview.

[01:24] This interview also has one of the biggest, probably most meaningful, revelations and moments in Pimball that I've ever done in my three or four years.

[01:35] So I think you're going to love to hear what is revealed at the end of this podcast as well.

[01:40] It's something that you haven't heard before on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:43] So look forward to that.

[01:45] So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, happy holidays.

[01:49] Here is John from Jack Bar.

[01:52] Oh, and before you hear this interview, keep in mind that we had a microphone out on the table.

[01:57] So you're not going to get the crystal clear audio that you normally get.

[02:01] But trust me, it's worth it. You're going to love this conversation later.

[02:05] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm excited.

[02:08] I have traveled on a Sunday morning to Brooklyn, New York.

[02:12] I'm in Jack Bar with the owner, John.

[02:16] John, welcome to the show.

[02:18] Hey, thanks for having me.

[02:19] Now, John, we've been saying through private messages that one of the sort of underrepresented parts of the hobby is the operator.

[02:27] Now, we talk a lot about collectors.

[02:29] You're a collector. You also are an operator.

[02:32] So let's, I'm excited because I want to know what games are doing well in location.

[02:37] What games you have in your collection.

[02:39] And then let's just talk about what's going on in the pinball world. How's that sound?

[02:42] Sounds great.

[02:43] All right. So you got into pinball how?

[02:45] I'm playing since I'm a kid.

[02:47] You know, 46 years old.

[02:49] And I started when I was probably about six.

[02:52] My grandfather owned a restaurant in Coney Island called Big Daddy's.

[02:55] Had a big arcade in the back.

[02:57] And pretty much my parents would take me there every other weekend.

[03:00] Spend the weekend and brighten the beach.

[03:03] Hand me rolls of change and just let me loosen the back.

[03:06] Okay. And you got the pinball bug then.

[03:08] Oh, yeah, for sure.

[03:09] I mean, I was kind of playing video games too.

[03:12] Especially with like Atari and the home consoles coming out.

[03:15] Right.

[03:16] But I just always gravitate towards the pinball machine.

[03:20] Okay. And we're inside Jack Bar.

[03:22] And if you haven't been here before, I haven't been here about maybe six months or a year.

[03:26] And you've expanded the amount of pins.

[03:28] How many pinball machines do we have inside Jack Bar right now?

[03:31] I'm going to be 16 working.

[03:33] And then I always keep one that I'm shopping out at the very front of the bar.

[03:39] So I'm looking at a dial then a spider man theater of magic star wars, Twilight Zone.

[03:44] You got El Vira, which I'm going to jump on and see if I actually like it.

[03:48] What's your favorite pin in here right now?

[03:50] Jurassic Park.

[03:51] Jurassic. Okay. So the new one from Keith L.

[03:53] Oh, yeah.

[03:54] How's it earning from an operator's perspective?

[03:56] It's earning great.

[03:57] Okay. What's great?

[03:58] And can you reveal?

[03:59] I never disclose personal financial information.

[04:02] Okay.

[04:03] But we can talk on a relative basis.

[04:05] Okay.

[04:06] It's definitely of the 16.

[04:09] It's definitely in the top three.

[04:11] Now, when a machine is a great earner, do you look for a machine to pay itself back over the lifetime it's here?

[04:18] Or is that impossible knowing how expensive machines are now?

[04:21] Yeah, absolutely.

[04:22] That's definitely my measure.

[04:25] I'm not like crazy about counting the coin box.

[04:28] I could just tell by looking at it visually, you know, how it's the bills are stacking up right versus other games.

[04:37] So I could tell you that my main measure and I usually do this through the audits.

[04:44] Yeah.

[04:45] If you're going to get a does a machine pay itself back in six months does it do it in a year?

[04:50] Right.

[04:51] So what's the fastest machine is which machine is paid itself back the fastest in your history as an operator?

[05:00] That's a great question.

[05:02] One of them was back when I had reciprocal skateboards when I got tron.

[05:07] Right.

[05:08] When I got tron.

[05:09] And now keep in mind games here are a dollar two for two dollars for three games.

[05:13] Okay.

[05:14] Back then all of my games crossed the board with 50 cents a game.

[05:17] Okay.

[05:18] So I think paid for itself in probably about four or five months.

[05:22] Right.

[05:23] And for those of you who don't know reciprocal was a skate shop in New York City right where there was pinball machines inside it.

[05:29] And then there's a big deal when it closed down because it was one of the coolest sort of like hidden treasure kind of arcades in New York City right?

[05:35] Yeah.

[05:36] Yeah.

[05:37] We built a big community.

[05:38] Okay.

[05:39] You know, we had two sides.

[05:40] So this was a skate shop on one side of Pimble Arcade and the other.

[05:43] We had a mini fridge in there so people could be YO.

[05:45] Right.

[05:46] And you know, I started out with four machines and a group to eleven.

[05:51] Now keep in mind this is a very important point I think is that at that time there hadn't been a place in New York City in probably 20 plus years that had anything more than like one maybe two fuss and ask games.

[06:06] Right.

[06:07] Right.

[06:08] So this is like the beginning of like the barcades were coming back.

[06:11] What year was that when reciprocal start putting games in 2007?

[06:15] Okay.

[06:16] So that was right around Spider-Man, Lord the Rings, Ellie was right around 2008.

[06:22] So Stern machines were still surviving but they really were the only company in town.

[06:27] Right.

[06:28] Back around that period.

[06:29] So fast forward to today, John, it's 2019 and now we have so many pinball manufacturers.

[06:36] I can't believe it.

[06:37] Are you like shocked that it survived complete shock?

[06:40] Right.

[06:41] More than survived it grew.

[06:43] Right.

[06:44] You know, as far as I was concerned, Stern was on their deathbed.

[06:48] No, and they were.

[06:49] They were.

[06:50] I mean, it was, I believe it was Lord the Rings that kind of saved them.

[06:53] But 2008 when they were recession hit, everyone was like non-essentials were being canceled from people's shopping list.

[07:00] So it's good.

[07:01] We're probably in the new golden era of pinball.

[07:04] Yeah.

[07:05] As an operator, which companies excite you the most right now?

[07:10] Well, which of the most reliable can we start there?

[07:13] Can you talk about that?

[07:14] Sure.

[07:15] I mean, reliability, I would have to give it to Stern for sure.

[07:19] You know, and Stern is on the height of both.

[07:23] You know, people will always nitpick and complain about, you know, the coil stops are breaking and that's true.

[07:30] But overall reliability as an operator, I could put a Stern machine in and feel very comfortable.

[07:37] You know, I'm an on-site operator, but I do operate out of one other bar.

[07:41] And if I had to unbox a new Stern in that place and know that I'm not going to be there every single day to service it,

[07:47] I could feel very comfortable knowing that it's going to operate 98%, you know, reliably.

[07:55] Now, the big issue the last year has been the play field issues.

[07:58] And we've seen people have play fields chipping.

[08:00] We were just standing over a Jurassic Park with a post that is chipped.

[08:04] Is that as an operator?

[08:05] Now, I know you're a collector, but as an operator, do you really care?

[08:08] Because, you know, back in the day, people didn't really care about dimples and chips because the games, as long as they functioned,

[08:14] do you really care when you see cosmetic things happening to your games?

[08:17] Sure, I do.

[08:18] I do have, I always say that my roles in order are player, collector, then tech, restore operator.

[08:29] Okay.

[08:30] Put those in one group.

[08:31] Okay.

[08:32] And so my collector side, you know, being more important to me than my operator side,

[08:38] yes, I do care, very obsessive and pulsed by nature.

[08:41] Right.

[08:42] And in that, like, I like a game, I like to try to get it as perfect as possible.

[08:47] I wanted to shine.

[08:48] I wanted to be cosmetically perfect.

[08:50] I like, I mean, not from everything from the play field to mechanisms.

[08:55] I like everything to look nice.

[08:58] So question about play field protectors, because I always wonder, as an operator,

[09:03] is also a collector who is a little OCD with their games, how do you feel about play field protectors?

[09:08] I know that like the jury's out and whether or not people like that.

[09:11] I heard somebody, I saw somebody on Pinside say it best.

[09:15] It's like a couch counter.

[09:18] Like your grandma putting plastic on the couch.

[09:20] It's silly to me.

[09:21] Like the pitmol machine is meant to be played.

[09:23] Right.

[09:24] It's perfect as I wanted to stay.

[09:26] It was built and designed to be played.

[09:29] And if it does gain some imperfections as a result of that, then that's endearing.

[09:35] That's history.

[09:36] Right.

[09:37] Show the game was loved.

[09:38] You know what I mean?

[09:39] Not that like a chip post and Jurassic Park signifies the great love affair we have with the game.

[09:43] I mean, that in particular is, to me, that's unacceptable.

[09:48] Now, you know, when you see the modern play fields and you have a mixture of games here,

[09:52] you're looking at stuff from the 90s.

[09:54] You've got a twilight zone.

[09:55] You've got a theater of magic.

[09:57] Can you tell the difference in quality between the play fields?

[10:00] Do you do?

[10:01] Because people are like, oh, they're using different solvents now.

[10:03] And that's why it's dimpling and cracking.

[10:06] Or like, what are your thoughts on where play fields have gone and been last?

[10:11] There's a clear difference.

[10:12] Absolutely clear difference.

[10:13] I mean, the diamond plate of the Valley Williams 90s era was, you know, bulletproof.

[10:20] You know, and now it's just like a thin layer that like you said at dimples, you can see the dimples.

[10:26] I don't know if that's a result of different products and chemicals clear coating isn't my specialty.

[10:31] Right.

[10:32] Okay.

[10:33] It's very, very obvious.

[10:34] So let's talk today.

[10:36] What's your next game you're going to get in Jack Barra of all the new games coming out?

[10:41] Can you talk about what's coming next?

[10:43] Stranger Things.

[10:44] Stranger Things.

[10:45] Wait, is there a Stranger Things pinball machine coming out?

[10:47] Yeah, I agree.

[10:48] I don't know if you've been on Facebook lately.

[10:51] It's someone that give video of Stranger Things.

[10:54] So you've ordered it already, right?

[10:56] Yeah.

[10:57] When are you expecting it?

[10:59] I'm told probably first we can January.

[11:02] Okay. So it's coming.

[11:03] Yeah.

[11:04] They haven't.

[11:05] Now the rumors are that they have even shipped some two locations to unbox tomorrow, December 23rd.

[11:11] Do you think we're going to see people playing it as early as tomorrow?

[11:16] Yeah, I want to know why.

[11:18] If my distributor is listening, I'd like to know why mine isn't in a box in my bar.

[11:22] Right.

[11:23] And you get some of the games immediately, right?

[11:25] So after Stranger Things, is there another title that you want to put on location here?

[11:30] Rick and Morty.

[11:31] Rick and Morty, all right.

[11:32] So, and you're going to get an early one.

[11:34] We don't have to say what number because apparently when you give what number you have,

[11:37] it's like a bull's eye on the top of your head.

[11:39] Oh, yeah.

[11:40] Yeah, I know.

[11:41] But you're going to get an early one.

[11:42] Yeah.

[11:44] I'm going to be able to say that there's a lot of people who want to play Rick and Morty on location because we hear that a lot that this game is rare.

[11:48] It's limited.

[11:49] You're not going to be able to see it on location.

[11:51] You're going to be able to play it at Jack Bar.

[11:53] I would say as early as mid February, right?

[11:56] It should most likely be here.

[11:58] I don't know.

[11:59] One thing I'll tell you is like as somebody who has 16 games.

[12:02] I can write deposit down with the manufacturer and distributor, depending on the case.

[12:07] And I don't pester them.

[12:10] I don't call them.

[12:11] The game coming when you know, when can I expect it?

[12:14] I let them do their thing.

[12:16] When the game shows up, the game shows up.

[12:18] Building pinball is already hard enough.

[12:21] They don't need customers for rassing them.

[12:23] I mean, in these companies.

[12:24] Pinside you listening?

[12:25] Yeah.

[12:26] I mean, these people are addicted.

[12:27] They want to know when they're going to get their games.

[12:29] So let's talk about stranger things because that is the hot thing right now.

[12:32] Like you saw the video that I put up.

[12:34] What are your thoughts on the game just currently as it stands?

[12:38] It's really hard to sing from that video.

[12:40] Well, for starters, that's what I'm told in this is all hearsay.

[12:44] That's a premium.

[12:45] I'm getting a pro.

[12:46] Okay.

[12:47] This isn't what I get in the early one.

[12:48] I want to get it in here fast.

[12:49] And supposedly all the projection stuff isn't even honest.

[12:53] So it's not on the pro.

[12:54] So here's what I'm hearing.

[12:55] On the pro version where that big screen is.

[12:57] It's going to be a static piece of artwork.

[13:00] I hear it's Hopkins lab, which is I don't know how that's going to work.

[13:05] Because that's a big thing to just be sitting there statically in the middle of the game.

[13:09] It seems to be the both physically and figurative leaf that center peeping in.

[13:13] And then the other part is the projector, right?

[13:16] And the discussion is will that work in a non a room that's not pitch black?

[13:22] And it as I'm looking around here right now, I'd be curious to see on location

[13:27] if that projector mechanism will function the way they intended to it.

[13:32] Because that could be a problem, right?

[13:33] If you're an operator and they've got this gimmick that doesn't really work,

[13:38] unless you have extreme low lighting, I'm not sure the satisfaction will be there when people play it.

[13:45] I mean, I like to think that they thought of that.

[13:48] Right, you know, I don't know.

[13:49] It must have, right?

[13:50] So it had to come into the testing room and turn the lights on and be like,

[13:54] Hey, it's no way to see how it looked now.

[13:56] There's no way they didn't think of that.

[13:58] Whether or not they figured out a solution, I mean, that remains to be seen.

[14:02] So like, when I'm looking at that game, we've been seeing it now for 48 hours.

[14:07] I do feel like it doesn't quite capture for me the 1980s world under the glass in the game.

[14:15] And I was just, I was kind of thinking about it.

[14:17] Like I'd love to see like more like the 80s vibe come through.

[14:21] Because right now, the art looks like it's just a stranger things poster with a bunch of inserts.

[14:26] But I guess we got to see it played.

[14:28] We're going to see it tomorrow.

[14:30] Tomorrow's the big day.

[14:31] Tomorrow's the big day.

[14:32] We spoiled their release.

[14:34] But tomorrow's going to be the big moment in which we see it stream.

[14:37] Yeah.

[14:38] Do you ever, um, do you ever be streaming out of here?

[14:41] Do people ever come here and want to set up their streaming gear?

[14:44] Yeah.

[14:45] It's happened a couple of times.

[14:47] Okay.

[14:48] It's not a regular thing that needs.

[14:49] Okay.

[14:50] You know, we're always open to, you know, we're very hospitable.

[14:54] Right.

[14:55] Anybody wants to do that?

[14:56] Go for it.

[14:57] Are you a fan of Rick and Morty or did you just like hear about the show?

[15:00] I honestly even wouldn't seem to have seen two or three episodes of it

[15:03] when it went a first air, when season one first aired.

[15:05] And I did like it.

[15:06] Whatever reason I fell out of it.

[15:08] It doesn't say anything about the show itself.

[15:10] And then I actually have a good friend who got a job writing for the show for the new season.

[15:16] He's a friend of mine.

[15:17] He used to write for SNL and he's doing that.

[15:20] And I was just really excited to go to him and tell him that.

[15:24] Because the first thing I did was I called him up and I was like,

[15:27] did you know this thing was being made?

[15:29] Right.

[15:30] And he was like, man, I'm just a peon.

[15:31] Yeah, yeah.

[15:32] What most people don't, you know, I also work for Hot Wheels.

[15:35] They're one of my clients.

[15:36] But these big brands and big properties, they have a ton of stuff that's being licensed out,

[15:42] you know, to make products as extensions of those IPs.

[15:45] So not everyone, I bet most people aren't aware that they'll swim that they're doing a pinball machine.

[15:49] No.

[15:50] So have you started watching the show now that you know the pin is coming?

[15:53] Not yet.

[15:54] I plan on it though.

[15:55] Okay.

[15:56] It's good.

[15:57] I've started, I'm on season two.

[15:58] Yeah.

[15:59] I was like, we need to sit down and binge watch this show.

[16:03] So you're kind of living a dream here because you also live above Jack Bar.

[16:07] Yeah.

[16:08] So you're kind of, and your office is inside Jack Bar.

[16:11] So you're surrounded by pinball machines all day long.

[16:14] Yeah.

[16:15] Yeah.

[16:16] How does it, does sometimes people say when you get a little too close to the thing you love,

[16:20] it loses its excitement.

[16:21] Is that true or do you, are you still like in love?

[16:23] You should add to the case in life.

[16:24] It is not the case with pinball.

[16:26] Right.

[16:27] I still allow myself, I mean like I work on them every single day.

[16:31] The first thing I do is I come down here every morning and work on the machines.

[16:35] Sometimes I'm done by the time we open it one.

[16:37] Sometimes I've been doing it till 6 p.m.

[16:39] And but I always allow myself to play after.

[16:42] You know, yeah, if you forget why you're doing something, then you get very tired of it.

[16:47] Yeah.

[16:48] You know, playing pinball is always to me the best remedy to get re-excited with the hobby.

[16:53] I think a lot of us go online and we tap conversations.

[16:56] We listen to podcasts, but you know, a lot of guys collect machines and don't turn them on that often.

[17:01] But you can lose perspective that it is a toy that's just meant to be played and enjoyed in a social environment.

[17:07] And no better place.

[17:08] And this is where they were meant to be.

[17:10] I mean, I see these barcades as the equivalent of modern day arcades.

[17:13] And this is what pinball was always supposed to be.

[17:16] A social toy that brought people together.

[17:18] Sure.

[17:19] Now, your clientele and your in Brooklyn, I mean this is a hip neighborhood.

[17:23] Are majority people coming in here, pinball fans or more beer fans, like your fans, and it's just fun to have something to do?

[17:30] Like what's the mix?

[17:31] Well, when we build the place, the first thing I said was I want to make sure that this place is,

[17:37] not an arcade with beer, but it's a bar with pinball.

[17:41] And the differentiation being that the bar, the pinball is in the background.

[17:45] Though it's obviously there and there's a lot of them.

[17:50] Like we have tons of regulars that don't even touch the pinball machines.

[17:54] They come in because it's their neighborhood bar.

[17:56] So we don't shove it down any way, it's throat.

[17:59] Right.

[18:00] But at the same time, the machines are here.

[18:02] We get a lot of regular players making come in and they are not forced to drink.

[18:06] Right.

[18:07] I actually saw a thread on a pin side the other day where people started debating whether it's okay to go into a bar and just play the pinball.

[18:16] I can't speak for every other bar.

[18:18] I can speak for myself as owner of this bar.

[18:20] Anybody can come in here and just play pinball.

[18:23] You own, I mean you run the bar and the pinball, right?

[18:26] So I think it might be a little different if the machines are owned by someone else inside that bar.

[18:31] Sure.

[18:32] And that way, like the whole point of having the machines there is to get people to buy some drinks.

[18:36] Right, right, right.

[18:37] So, but here it's different.

[18:38] I mean you're making money on whether it's a drink or a pinball machine.

[18:41] It's all going to the same source.

[18:43] So, the thing I tell them are tenders specifically because they obviously don't benefit from people putting money into the machines.

[18:48] But maybe they'll bring somebody that drinks a ton.

[18:52] Right.

[18:53] You know, it would be kind to them and you know they're going to remember that and they're going to have friends that drink.

[18:57] Now, something I've noticed in my short league experience in New York City is people get really heated and into league play.

[19:05] And I watch people like abuse machines and do you ever get that here where you have to tell people like

[19:11] why are you throwing around my machine to win 40 bucks tonight with really, okay.

[19:16] So people respect these machines.

[19:18] Yeah, they, they, for the most part, I mean, there's exceptions to everything.

[19:21] But for the most part, they, I mean, you know, occasional like punch in the lock bar or slap like slapping at a frustration.

[19:29] And it happens.

[19:30] I've done it.

[19:31] Right.

[19:32] So I can't fault anybody for that.

[19:34] My biggest pet peeve and a lot of people know this is drinks on the glass.

[19:38] I hate that.

[19:39] Right.

[19:40] And you've got cup holders.

[19:41] Apparently they might be hard to locate for some people.

[19:44] Sure, especially in a dark book.

[19:45] You know, but it just, to me and maybe I'm forgetting that I'm like around these all the time.

[19:50] But to some degree, these things are my babies.

[19:52] And it just seems so obvious to me.

[19:55] Like the glass is on an angle and it's plugged into the wall.

[19:59] Right.

[20:00] You know, and anybody, I mean, ask anybody like, do you think painball machines are expensive or inexpensive?

[20:05] It's amazing to say they're expensive.

[20:07] Right.

[20:08] Like if I pulled up, if you pulled up in your car, would you, would you, if somebody put their drink on the hood of the car?

[20:13] Right.

[20:14] And you'd be like, what are you doing?

[20:15] Yeah.

[20:16] No, I would.

[20:17] I would.

[20:18] And I'm looking at Primus.

[20:19] The Primus is pretty flat.

[20:20] No, but it's like a coffee table.

[20:21] That's the one I get to the most for sure.

[20:22] I'm sure.

[20:23] Yeah.

[20:24] All right.

[20:25] So I'm looking over my shoulder and I see a willy-wanka in here.

[20:27] Yeah.

[20:28] Now let's talk about wonka on location because I know that and you have, is that a standard or an LE?

[20:32] That's an LE.

[20:33] Which, so as an operator, I'm curious because they made the standard edition for operators.

[20:39] It was 7,500.

[20:40] Didn't have the wonka bit or mechanism.

[20:42] What made you go with the, the LE of the game?

[20:45] The extra Mac.

[20:46] The extra Mac.

[20:47] The extra Mac.

[20:48] Yeah.

[20:49] Okay.

[20:50] Now how's that game been earning with those kills?

[20:51] Kills.

[20:52] Kills?

[20:53] Oh, yeah.

[20:54] Just the theme bright lights.

[20:55] This is really welcome.

[20:56] How do you, how do you, is this way?

[20:57] So let's talk about that because we talk a lot about just themes everything.

[21:01] And I've said that I think theme is the reason why people want to buy a game and put in their home.

[21:06] Is theme everything as an operator?

[21:08] Like how, how do you weigh theme in your decision making?

[21:11] Big time.

[21:12] Oh, absolutely.

[21:13] I mean, dialed in is a great example.

[21:15] You know, I love dialed in.

[21:16] I think it might be Jeff's best game.

[21:18] Anybody who plays it for the most part will say like, yeah, that really is fun.

[21:22] You're a casual pinballer and you walk up to two machines, one to wonka, one to dialed in,

[21:26] which you get a pick.

[21:27] Right.

[21:28] And when you could, you can relate to and you understand the subject that.

[21:32] Yeah, I mean, even as I look at dialed in right now, it is so jammed pack that game.

[21:37] And you can go get that now in Ellie for like $7,500.

[21:42] Yeah.

[21:43] Which is crazy.

[21:44] Probably the best $7,500 you could spend.

[21:46] Yeah, I mean, that's what Rick and Morty is about to cost people.

[21:50] Yeah.

[21:51] If you get the blood sucker edition, I mean, we have tunnel vision in this hobby, right?

[21:54] We see the newest thing and we just like stand out.

[21:57] But man, if you put a dialed in, someone, someone to do this for me on my Facebook page,

[22:01] put a dialed in play field with all this stuff on it next to Rick and Morty.

[22:05] And you tell someone, these games are now the same price in the marketplace.

[22:10] Unbelievable.

[22:11] I feel like I'm going to go get all the Jersey Jack pins in like a couple of years because

[22:15] hobbits are now like $6,500.

[22:18] Now as an operator, do you look at getting machines like used because you can get them

[22:25] for a really good price and they still earn like would the hobbit earn well in 2019 for you?

[22:32] I didn't do that hot when it was here.

[22:34] This is a blessing and a curse that I get one of the first ones off of the line.

[22:38] Jackie even brings it here himself, which is super cool.

[22:41] I'm like, any kid, you know, I'm all the problems that are inevitable off of the line.

[22:46] I'm the first one to do what I remember specifically.

[22:49] I think you posted that the ramp on the hobbit was like so.

[22:52] Yeah, I was about to say that it was splitting over.

[22:54] I don't know if you know this, but you're the, this bars the reason why I got banned.

[22:59] Not anything you did, but I took a picture of the hobbit, the center ramp, the crossing ramp broke,

[23:06] the piece of metal broke.

[23:07] I took a picture of it.

[23:08] I put it up on pin-side and that was actually the post that led to me being banned for life because they said I was trolling.

[23:15] That's a, that's a, that's a hefty sentence.

[23:18] For life, I was, they said I was trolling by highlighting the negatives of the build quality of the new pin.

[23:24] Wait until you tend to do that.

[23:26] You know, I, like just look it out for customers.

[23:29] Yeah.

[23:30] So, no, I love that about you.

[23:31] You, you know, you had pired to the Caribbean as well and that's another pin.

[23:34] I didn't.

[23:35] You never had that.

[23:36] That's the only one I'd invite.

[23:37] And did you not, did you, why, why not?

[23:40] Be cool.

[23:41] I got to play a question.

[23:42] I don't know.

[23:44] You know what, I, my start was like pumping pins out at that time and I probably had just bought TNA and like, I don't know, I mean, you know, I'm not made of money.

[23:54] Was TNA on location here?

[23:56] Yeah.

[23:57] So how did that go?

[23:58] It did pretty well.

[23:59] It started out really strong and then dropped off.

[24:01] I actually know what a bar of great point.

[24:03] Okay.

[24:04] Like a block away from another pinball.

[24:06] I would imagine I mean, theme is everything.

[24:08] I mean, Stern, for, for, for location play, when people are walking in and you've got a good mix of casual points,

[24:13] with pinball players, you know, the pinball players are going to jump on anything pinball.

[24:18] Like they, they just love pinball.

[24:20] I mean, they, they'll jump on, you know, I'm looking at the diners in here and theater of magic, fish tails.

[24:25] But for the casual player, I mean, if you just brought in, I always say like the third grader test.

[24:30] You brought in a kid here and be like star wars, Jurassic Park.

[24:34] Like those are obviously the titles that are going to, people are going to gravitate towards.

[24:37] So how does El Viro bin, which is, because that's like an interesting theme.

[24:41] I've been here for like three weeks, but it's been doing it very well.

[24:44] And how do you like El Viro?

[24:46] I love it.

[24:47] You love it?

[24:48] Yeah.

[24:49] Walk it.

[24:50] I honestly do me.

[24:51] It's a big thing.

[24:52] It's a big thing.

[24:53] Yeah.

[24:54] It really got to play it.

[24:55] But which, which I hope you do after this.

[24:57] Yeah, we're going to have.

[24:58] For starters, it's just really satisfying in terms of like the call outs and the, the video.

[25:02] And it's a, look, I'll tell you, it's a simple layout.

[25:05] It's a very straightforward layout.

[25:06] The shots are relatively easy.

[25:08] But they tie into the game.

[25:11] Like they, they, each of them pays you with like some, some funny line from El Viro, some cool music.

[25:18] The music is cool as hell and it just looks sexy as hell.

[25:21] So in terms of the new manufacturers coming out, have you been following Deeproot and retro atomic zombie adventure?

[25:28] Yeah.

[25:29] Do you think Deeproot is going to be able to make an impact in Pimball knowing all the options that are out there?

[25:35] Oh, wow.

[25:37] I'm always very hopeful.

[25:39] And I don't want to sound negative, you know, because who doesn't hope there'll be more Pimball, you know.

[25:45] Right.

[25:46] I'm all about more competition, you know, going from an oligopoly, we're at now, you know, when I got into his monopoly and then an oligopoly.

[25:54] And soon, you know, there could be more manufacturers.

[25:57] I don't know if there's room for more.

[25:58] But I am very concerned about their game plan business model.

[26:07] And in what concerns you about it?

[26:09] Well, the number of things.

[26:11] I, you know, I listened to that interview when you had Robert on.

[26:15] He sounded a little jaded, maybe.

[26:20] You know, I don't know the guy personally.

[26:22] So just going on how he sounded on your show.

[26:26] But whatever there's plenty of presidents out there that have like that personality and they're successful.

[26:32] So that's not necessarily why they would fail.

[26:35] I am mostly concerned, I think, about them having, because you asked, you know, having games you could have produced.

[26:42] And he had some answer that, you know, maybe I'll get the numbers.

[26:45] 21 games are 50% complete.

[26:48] 21% complete.

[26:50] That's, that's, that's, that's interesting.

[26:54] That's like saying 21 of Canadian's rumors are 50% accurate.

[26:58] Which might be right.

[27:00] It probably is.

[27:02] I mean, but you know, nobody wants 21 games from them.

[27:06] Right.

[27:07] You want one awesome game.

[27:09] Right. And do you think we saw that with Raza right now?

[27:11] Oh, it's hard to say, you know, you get mixed reviews.

[27:14] I haven't seen it in person.

[27:16] It's a John game.

[27:17] John's games are pretty awesome.

[27:19] Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at a theater of magic right now.

[27:21] Now, as an operator, Robert's promise of an indestructible playfield must excite you on some level that you could take.

[27:29] It was, it first, it was a sledgehammer.

[27:31] Now it's a hammer to the playfield and not have any dimples or cracking or wear until you got downgraded from sledgehammer.

[27:38] To hammer.

[27:39] Yeah.

[27:40] Yeah.

[27:41] So, but we haven't seen it yet.

[27:42] Robert Mallett is next.

[27:44] We had it with Robert.

[27:45] It could be like a nerf football at the end.

[27:47] But we haven't seen it yet.

[27:48] So it's going to be interesting, because March is coming up quickly.

[27:50] Yeah.

[27:51] I mean, people, I love 2020 as we look into the horizon and what's coming next.

[27:56] You know, so as an operator, who do you buy?

[27:59] So you buy through a distributor?

[28:01] Is that how you get your game star?

[28:02] Yeah, exactly.

[28:03] Who, can you mention or no?

[28:05] I don't know, like that's like, is that?

[28:07] Yeah, sure.

[28:08] I buy from Trent.

[28:09] Okay.

[28:10] From Trent is a, Trent tilt.

[28:11] From Tilt.

[28:12] Okay.

[28:13] And he's turned bit one of their biggest distributors, right?

[28:15] Yeah.

[28:16] Trent Augustine, right?

[28:17] Yeah.

[28:18] Okay.

[28:19] And he's been doing it for a long time since I think Tron might have been the first game.

[28:22] I bought some of them.

[28:23] Okay.

[28:24] And now does he distribute for J.J.P. everybody?

[28:25] He's a, no, I think he's a stern exclusive.

[28:28] He might, maybe American pinball too.

[28:30] Okay.

[28:31] Okay.

[28:32] But I've asked him about, like, when I bought the monster bash remake, he said he wasn't doing

[28:34] Chicago game.

[28:35] Right.

[28:36] Okay.

[28:37] Now, I've seen on location, even here in New York City over at Sunshine, like, Peter will

[28:41] put out, like a, like a Supreme machine.

[28:44] He'll put out, Ellie's of machines.

[28:46] Do you, do you think it's silly to put a limited edition, high end machine on location when

[28:51] there's pro versions?

[28:52] I mean, what are your thoughts on that?

[28:55] I don't see any problem with it.

[28:57] You know, there, I mean, in my, in my opinion, pros have traditionally been better games, both

[29:04] from gameplay, the gameplay point of view, me as a player, but also, they, you know,

[29:11] well, yeah, gameplay, but also, they're just better location games.

[29:14] There's less maintenance, there's less mechanics on it.

[29:18] Right.

[29:19] Can you name an upper play field in a stern game that's made the game better?

[29:23] Family guy.

[29:24] Okay.

[29:25] The pinball, yeah.

[29:26] Is that the last one?

[29:27] I think so.

[29:28] It's a wild go, right?

[29:29] Yes.

[29:30] How about lower play field?

[29:32] I don't think they've done that.

[29:34] Monsters.

[29:35] Monsters, ACVC.

[29:36] Yeah.

[29:37] I wasn't, I wasn't particularly fond of the ACVC one.

[29:40] It seems like a premium when, you know, if you're an operator, I would, I would say,

[29:43] if you're an operator, I would think you would start at, well, pro will get me the theme.

[29:48] Yeah.

[29:49] Saves me a lot of money.

[29:50] There's less in it to break.

[29:51] There's, I get the game first.

[29:53] Get the game first.

[29:54] Also, from a player standpoint, a lot of the pros just play better.

[29:57] I hear that all the time.

[29:58] I hear that.

[29:59] Yeah, the game of thrones is a great example of that.

[30:01] Right.

[30:02] You know, what about Star Wars?

[30:03] I mean, you have the Star Wars pro right here, do you think that Hyperloop missing is impacts?

[30:07] I've really, I've really played the, the premium on the Star Wars.

[30:10] I think I might have played one game.

[30:12] Yeah.

[30:13] Another bar was in League.

[30:14] It basically stepped up to it and drained three balls immediately.

[30:17] Right.

[30:18] So I wouldn't, you know, count that.

[30:19] Question I have, and I'm curious what your thoughts are about.

[30:23] How confusing do you think modern pinball games are to people who walk in here and try to play a game?

[30:31] And the codes are getting more complex.

[30:33] Obviously, games like Willy Wonka, Pirates of Caribbean, Diodan, these aren't like, you know, just shoot what's blinking anymore.

[30:39] There's a lot that you need to know to really understand the way the game is supposed to be played.

[30:44] Do you, do you think games are getting a little too confusing for casual players who just walking to your bar?

[30:50] Some of them.

[30:51] Yeah, for sure.

[30:52] Which ones do you think are just like Star Wars?

[30:54] Star Wars?

[30:55] Yeah.

[30:56] Which the only game in the room I don't play.

[30:57] Because you just, why?

[30:58] I still want to play chess while I'm playing pinball.

[31:00] I've said this before in the show that it's, it's hard, right?

[31:03] Because you, you know the Star Wars movies and you walk up to the machine and it's not as intuitive.

[31:08] As the narrative of the movie, right?

[31:12] You're kind of like, you choose your character, which is also little right away, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or off of like how Star Wars out, you know, you're not just Luke, who's trying to like defeat the Emperor.

[31:23] You're right.

[31:24] And then you're combining modes and stacking modes and multipliers.

[31:27] So, okay, so you think that's confusing?

[31:29] I would agree.

[31:30] Pirate, Pirate suffered from that.

[31:32] It's a civic problem.

[31:33] 22 characters, you have to select from.

[31:35] I was so confused.

[31:36] With no timeout.

[31:37] That might have been, that might have been the, the, the moment where I made the decision not to buy it.

[31:42] Right.

[31:43] And then when people say it's a great game and I totally believe them, but I just couldn't get past the,

[31:49] having to pick one.

[31:50] I, I never even seen those movies.

[31:52] Right.

[31:53] Do you think we hear this a lot in, that you really can appreciate a modern game on location?

[31:59] Do you think that is an accurate statement?

[32:01] Cannot.

[32:02] You cannot appreciate modern game on location.

[32:05] I firmly disagree.

[32:06] I think you can.

[32:07] I think it depends on how the game is set up.

[32:10] Right.

[32:11] You know, I mean, there's definitely places where, I mean, you can't sneeze and not till,

[32:16] until press in the start button.

[32:18] Right.

[32:19] You know.

[32:20] And so, yeah, any player is just going to be like, what the fuck?

[32:22] And there's a little one who can't curse.

[32:23] So, I, he'll be like, I'm not going to be like, it's all right.

[32:25] It's all right.

[32:26] It's all right.

[32:27] Sunday morning.

[32:28] Well, I guess when, when people say that I think they mean, you really can't get immersed into the game.

[32:33] So, I, we don't think right now the games are not, they're on, but they're not in a track mode.

[32:38] So, how do you set your volumes in a way that you can enjoy the pin here?

[32:43] You know, you hear the call outs, hear the music without being either too loud, right, to make the bar like annoyingly destructive.

[32:50] Or too low, where you can't really hear the machines.

[32:53] I mean, I go into modern pinball by me and Murray Hill and the games are always really low.

[32:58] Yeah.

[32:59] And I'm always like, I'm not getting the experience that I want.

[33:02] How do you figure out that balance?

[33:04] Well, I mean, I set them high by nature.

[33:07] I like, I, I try to come up with a level of volume where if you're standing two machines away, you can just kind of hear it.

[33:14] But if you're standing right in front of it, you could fully hear it.

[33:17] Right.

[33:18] I also have the luxury of being an on-site operator who's here often.

[33:22] So, a lot of times I'll like lower them in the morning while working on them, just to a, like maybe a few, a few levels down.

[33:31] So that in the daytime when the bartender's setting up and the music isn't as loud, and there's only one, maybe two games being played,

[33:39] it doesn't scare everybody out of here.

[33:42] But then as the day progresses, the place fills with people and the music's, we start turning the music up.

[33:48] And I'll start turning the games up a little bit more.

[33:50] Right.

[33:51] But not every operator has that luxury.

[33:53] Right. Do you wish some of these games, when we talk about innovation, what kinds of things would you like to see innovative?

[33:59] That would make it easier, maybe for you as an operator, and maybe easier for you as a collector, or things you'd want to see put into pinball.

[34:08] I don't know. I think Stern should finally let Steve Richie do what he wants and put a flamethrower in a chainsaw in a machine.

[34:15] That would be cool.

[34:16] Right. Does he want to do that?

[34:17] I don't know.

[34:18] But he strikes me as the type.

[34:19] Right. Right.

[34:20] Yeah.

[34:21] He's, they're probably got to keep him on a leash, I don't know.

[34:24] He's, he's, well, he's just one of my favorites.

[34:26] Right.

[34:27] So, you know, stuff like internet connectivity as an operator, would that make your life easier?

[34:32] So when new code comes out, your games are Wi-Fi connected to Stern's network, and the games would automatically update.

[34:39] Would you, would that be easier than having to open up?

[34:41] Not for me.

[34:42] I mean, what, how would that not be easier?

[34:44] It would be a little easier.

[34:45] Right. Right.

[34:46] I know. Sure.

[34:47] But I mean, we're talking about a few minutes of my day.

[34:50] Right.

[34:51] And I actually enjoy the process of updating the code.

[34:54] Yeah.

[34:55] So, you know, so it, to me, I don't look at it like a pain in the ass.

[34:59] But to an operator who's not on location, sure.

[35:02] And especially if I'm a player who goes there, and I'm like, like, like, seven Bs, a perfect example.

[35:07] Right.

[35:08] You know, like, don't get the new game, the operators, we know that just such a thing is code update.

[35:11] You know, what the fuck?

[35:12] Code means.

[35:13] Yeah.

[35:14] So he's like, he just puts it in there, and I can walk in two years later, and Iron Man is still running on .81, or whatever it is.

[35:19] You know, and it's like so frustrating, because you're like, this game is so awesome.

[35:23] They just update the code, but they're never going to do it.

[35:26] Yeah. When I sold my Batman 66, Ellie, the guy didn't even know what code was.

[35:30] And it was like, I'm .5 something.

[35:33] He would have had the game for years, thinking that the way they first shipped Batman was the game.

[35:39] Right.

[35:40] He's no clue. He was just a Batman fan.

[35:42] Yeah. And that was that.

[35:43] What about volume?

[35:44] So why can't you adjust the volume in a game on most games from the outside of the game?

[35:51] Well, in Jack's games, you cannot.

[35:53] But not just in games.

[35:54] No.

[35:55] What I don't want the players messing with the volume.

[35:58] No, but like put it somewhere like maybe in the back somewhere where they wouldn't know, but just operators would know, or maybe, I don't know.

[36:05] So where's on the Jack one, you can do it from the front?

[36:08] Yeah. Well, you could shut that off in the settings.

[36:10] Okay.

[36:11] But I do specifically remember with dialed in, it was default, as you can use that, you know, where the headphone jack is.

[36:16] There's a down volume button.

[36:18] And people were turning it up.

[36:19] And I was like, I didn't know that that was enabled.

[36:22] Oh, okay.

[36:23] And I kept saying, why is it game sold out again?

[36:25] Right.

[36:26] I definitely turned it down.

[36:27] Right.

[36:28] You know, and then somebody casually mentioned to me, like, oh, it's cool.

[36:31] You can adjust the volume with that button.

[36:33] That's for the home, right?

[36:35] It's not really for not.

[36:36] You want that in your house, but you wouldn't want that in a bar.

[36:39] No.

[36:40] I get why.

[36:41] There's a lot of things you don't want to let a player do.

[36:43] Do you, one of the things that's changed a lot in pinballs, pinball machines used to go on location to test before they were manufactured.

[36:52] And that's changed now.

[36:54] I mean, the window in which these manufacturers now keep games secret and create that fear of missing out when they announce the game.

[37:01] But the games haven't been on location.

[37:03] I mean, pressure tests that the way they used to back in the day.

[37:06] Do you wish more manufacturers would put games on location to have them sort of beat on for a few months before they were manufactured?

[37:12] Yeah, they do.

[37:13] It's called jack book.

[37:14] You say?

[37:15] So you do you get feedback and have you ever given feedback that's actually been implemented into some like future manufacturing?

[37:23] Absolutely.

[37:24] Like what kind of thing?

[37:25] I mean, I know a lot of the people at these companies, you know, I'm in the hobby a long time.

[37:29] They know that I have good honest feedback.

[37:31] I'm not an asshole about it.

[37:33] You know, like, like, like, like, an alvira like, I know why I'm in a while.

[37:38] I email them, I'm like, hey, we think about this happening.

[37:41] Right.

[37:42] You know, maybe it just this.

[37:43] I was having a problem with the up down with the house ramp and he gave me some great advice.

[37:47] Is that even though he's not an engineer, right?

[37:49] You know, it was either so.

[37:51] So I, you know, I wrote him about some of those things and he's happy here.

[37:55] It's one thing to be sitting behind a computer and like anticipating how it's going to perform.

[38:00] It's another thing when it's in the field.

[38:02] Jack, I, you know, you know, he'll, you know, he'll tell me who to call at the company.

[38:07] Right.

[38:08] I'll, you know, I'll give him everything.

[38:10] So and they're always amenable to feedback.

[38:13] I mean, I think sometimes people go on the website, pin-side, or we're complaining about everything,

[38:18] like they don't care, but they do care.

[38:20] I mean, I think what, where they struggle now is the demand is so high to get pinball machines

[38:25] that these manufacturers are just trying to get stuff on the line and out to customers as fast as they can.

[38:30] They clearly are not taking as much time as they used to back in the day.

[38:35] But they can't, they can't do it anymore like they used to because they can't put, let's say for example,

[38:40] you can't put stranger things out in a bar four months before production starts.

[38:46] Because then you spoil the reveal of the game.

[38:49] And with Stern having new games out every three months.

[38:52] So it has to be the few months after.

[38:54] Yeah.

[38:55] It's in production.

[38:56] Yeah. And you couldn't do a whitewood.

[38:58] I don't blame them.

[38:59] Yeah, I don't blame either.

[39:00] It was my company.

[39:01] I'd be getting the units out there.

[39:02] Yeah.

[39:03] I don't blame them either.

[39:04] Well, what's your dream theme?

[39:06] It's not currently available.

[39:08] I could just be like, you know, I'll snap my fingers,

[39:10] Canadian pinball, Genie, make any game appear.

[39:13] It's not in set.

[39:14] It's not in set.

[39:15] Oh my god.

[39:16] You got some interesting ones when you, when you said, do you want me to give you a few and then maybe?

[39:24] I would love, I would love G1 Transformers.

[39:27] I love big trouble and little China.

[39:29] That's the animated Transformers.

[39:30] Oh yeah.

[39:31] The first, the Orson Wells movie with Galvatron and Unicron and the movie they put out with that soundtrack

[39:40] with you got the touch and dare and Orson Wells.

[39:43] He was Unicron.

[39:44] It was the last movie he ever did.

[39:46] Wow.

[39:47] He was the voice of Unicron.

[39:48] That's 1987.

[39:49] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[39:50] Wow.

[39:51] I also think that I love big trouble and little China.

[39:55] I love campy movies.

[39:56] I think 80s.

[39:57] I really think that would lend itself to pinball.

[39:59] Absolutely.

[40:00] Think about it.

[40:01] You're Jack Burden.

[40:02] Like you're the character.

[40:03] Yeah.

[40:04] And then you have to go to feet low pan and all the different.

[40:06] You have to go with the raven.

[40:07] Yeah, you get the raven hat guy.

[40:08] You get the guy who blows up.

[40:09] You got low pan who raises up.

[40:11] Just the toys and the campiness of it.

[40:14] Yeah.

[40:15] I think would be terrific.

[40:16] I also just like a simple story like that.

[40:19] That would translate perfectly into pinball.

[40:21] And I think the other thing when I look at pinball and I think this is why Rick and Morty is going to do so well.

[40:26] Just a sense of humor.

[40:27] Like a movie with a big personality.

[40:29] Yeah.

[40:30] That's fun and campy.

[40:31] Translates really well.

[40:32] It's why I'm like a nervous about stranger things because I don't think the darkness of the stranger things world.

[40:39] It's like a little serious to show.

[40:41] And I look at the pin.

[40:43] I'm like, I'm not getting the 80s campiness from that.

[40:46] I'm getting more of that serious element to show.

[40:48] It's a full year group.

[40:49] I don't think it's going to be like, I don't know if that's the fun elements coming to life.

[40:53] It's more like the serious aspects of the show.

[40:55] So I think fun movies.

[40:57] That's like the most fun.

[40:58] Yeah, great.

[40:59] Ghostbusters to me is probably the greatest pinball theme of all time.

[41:02] I'm not happy with how it was executed.

[41:04] Sure.

[41:05] And it was also about 30 years too late.

[41:06] Yeah.

[41:07] But it's just like the execution of it.

[41:09] It was Stern's last DMD game.

[41:12] I was upset that they didn't make it LCD.

[41:14] Sure.

[41:15] And then the design of it was just.

[41:17] Yeah.

[41:18] I've only played it maybe 20 times in my life.

[41:20] But I wasn't like, I wasn't like knocked off my feet.

[41:24] Yeah.

[41:25] I'm hesitant to say it because it's so cliche.

[41:30] Matrix.

[41:31] Yeah.

[41:32] It would have been a fantastic theme.

[41:34] Now, why do we say it would have been because go get it somebody.

[41:37] I know that Warner Brothers right now.

[41:39] They would want someone to incorporate the fourth movie into their life.

[41:43] As a player, I would love them to make it today.

[41:45] Yeah.

[41:46] As an operator or I should say, yeah, but as an operator,

[41:50] I want to be that thrilled buyer because it's too late.

[41:53] Like people are raving about how Rick and Morty,

[41:56] and this is an excellent point.

[41:58] Rick and Morty, it's like about time they released a pin with the timeliness.

[42:03] But Jurassic Park is very much the same time period as Matrix now.

[42:08] It is.

[42:09] But they made it.

[42:10] And I was when I heard that they were doing Jurassic Park.

[42:13] I was like, wow, that time it sucks.

[42:16] They executed.

[42:17] Right.

[42:18] And I had full faith in Keith because I named Kix X.

[42:22] Right.

[42:23] You know, I think Matrix is a little every now.

[42:25] I do think you get these properties that almost everybody's seen it.

[42:29] It's still cool.

[42:31] I would love it if it was only the first movie.

[42:33] But again, I just think about the translation of that theme in the pinball

[42:38] would be really cool.

[42:39] I like the theme of that.

[42:40] All the stuff.

[42:41] I like the theme of that.

[42:42] I like the theme of that.

[42:43] I like the theme of that.

[42:44] I like the theme of that.

[42:45] I'm happy they made these, yeah, sense.

[42:46] Right.

[42:47] Honestly, they created a whole other world.

[42:48] Like based on that theme, but a different story.

[42:50] Right.

[42:51] So you're talking Jurassic Parks.

[42:52] When you play it, yeah, yeah.

[42:53] They were giving you different tasks to do.

[42:57] And you feel compelled to do them.

[43:00] Okay.

[43:01] You know, so I don't remember if Keith said it or somebody else when they did the making of video.

[43:05] He said it so well.

[43:06] I was like, this isn't the story of the people in the movie.

[43:08] This is the story of everybody else that was on the island.

[43:11] Right.

[43:12] Right.

[43:13] And you feel that way.

[43:14] And it's really cool.

[43:15] Well, I'm people love it.

[43:16] I mean, do you think Jurassic Park is going to win Game of the Year at the twippy?

[43:20] It should.

[43:21] Is it the best game of 2019?

[43:22] It's one of Stern's best games, period.

[43:24] Right.

[43:25] Right.

[43:26] And Keith L. Win.

[43:27] Is he their best designer right now?

[43:29] All things considered.

[43:30] Is it freshest designer?

[43:31] That's for sure.

[43:32] Right.

[43:33] Who's your favorite designer of all time?

[43:34] Steve Richie's up there.

[43:35] Steve Richie.

[43:36] Steve Richie.

[43:37] And Black Knight.

[43:38] Where is, why don't you even see one?

[43:39] What's up to the bar and green point?

[43:40] Did you like Black Knight sort of rage?

[43:41] Sort of rage.

[43:42] It was good enough.

[43:43] Do you think he's still a little bit more than you?

[43:45] I think he's a little bit more than you.

[43:46] I think he's a little bit more than you.

[43:47] I think he's a little bit more than you.

[43:48] Do you think he's still got one big hit left in him?

[43:52] I don't know.

[43:53] It might have 20, but he hits left in him.

[43:55] Definitely he needs to.

[43:56] 20 that are 50% done or two.

[43:57] You know, like get away is probably my favorite game of all time.

[44:00] Right.

[44:01] I speed to.

[44:02] Really simple.

[44:03] It has that feel of simple to learn tough to be.

[44:06] Right.

[44:07] That is what makes any guy okay.

[44:08] You can talk about theme.

[44:09] You can talk about technology, build quality.

[44:11] And this is not only thing that matters.

[44:13] It's simple to learn, but tough to be.

[44:16] Right.

[44:17] It's not just in Pimbal, any game in the world as a gamer.

[44:20] Right.

[44:21] Any game should have those qualities.

[44:22] And get away is a perfect example of that.

[44:25] Right.

[44:26] It's five major shots.

[44:27] Right.

[44:28] That's it.

[44:29] I mean, think about Secret Mario Brothers, right?

[44:31] Probably the most successful video game of all time.

[44:33] Simple to learn.

[44:34] Two buttons.

[44:35] Yeah.

[44:36] Hard to get through when you were a kid, right?

[44:38] We played it for hours and hours and hours.

[44:40] And I think it's a good example.

[44:43] I think where people want to see more and more Pimbal.

[44:45] It should be approachable.

[44:46] It should be you should be able to get into a game pretty easily.

[44:49] But then again, make the code hard to get to the end of the journey.

[44:53] But don't make it confusing on how to just play the pan.

[44:56] I think that that's a lesson for for all modern games right now.

[45:00] I guess the next question I have for you, John, is Rick and Morty's coming.

[45:06] You've got.

[45:07] What you want to point out Rick and Morty is that is such a great move on.

[45:14] That's so lensing.

[45:17] I mean, I said I haven't watched the whole show, but just three episodes I watched.

[45:21] Like in a five minute period, an episode of that, like 50 different things happen.

[45:26] Different characters.

[45:27] It's like, right.

[45:28] Just so much opportunity to like create tasks and adventures.

[45:32] Right.

[45:33] Right.

[45:34] Yeah, no, it's them going into different dimensions.

[45:36] It's like you could just see it's like perfect mode based.

[45:39] Yeah, cartoons.

[45:40] And for a mode.

[45:41] Yeah.

[45:42] And the fact that he's making original callouts for the game.

[45:46] I think I don't think we've seen.

[45:48] I really don't think we've seen half of the game yet.

[45:50] I mean, I know we've seen a layout.

[45:51] We've seen the art.

[45:52] But the other half of that game, they're going to kill the other half of that game is Justin Rowland's contributions to just creator of the show.

[45:59] Yeah, that's huge.

[46:00] Once we hear all of his like, I heard he's going to be like cursing out the player.

[46:04] He's going to be also kick ass.

[46:06] That's one of the big things that Spider-Man has going for it.

[46:09] Right.

[46:10] Because Mr. James, what's the actor's name?

[46:13] J.J.

[46:14] So what's the name of his name is?

[46:16] He recorded a whole ton of lights for that.

[46:19] Right.

[46:20] So you press the flipper button when it's in game over.

[46:22] And he's like, we've fishin' for a couple of it.

[46:24] Yeah.

[46:25] It's so cool.

[46:26] Yeah.

[46:27] And that's what was cool.

[46:28] I mean, I loved having Batman because of all that custom Adam West callouts and Bert Ward.

[46:31] I mean, Stern has been accused of sort of cutting corners on getting the assets that people want to see in these games.

[46:39] Yeah.

[46:40] And I think rightfully so.

[46:42] I just think a pinball machine becomes once you make a machine based on a theme people love.

[46:48] That's it.

[46:49] And that's what I think people had issues with Star Wars.

[46:51] You've got one shot at putting everything people love about that franchise into the pin.

[46:57] And then it's too late.

[46:58] It's done.

[46:59] It's been finished.

[47:00] I mean, you can always add stuff later on, maybe with code.

[47:01] And that's always been Mike Bright with Wonka's.

[47:03] It's a musical.

[47:04] I just want to hear the musical being sung by the people.

[47:08] From the film.

[47:09] And it's like almost there.

[47:10] It's like elements of it are there.

[47:11] But I guess on location it doesn't matter as much.

[47:14] I mean, people are probably not going to get too deep into these things.

[47:18] Exactly.

[47:19] Right.

[47:20] Exactly.

[47:21] I mean, I'm obviously, when I buy a $9500 pinball machine, you know, I have to be concerned with whether it's going to earn or not.

[47:27] Right.

[47:28] So right now, because what I want to do is I want to have John come back on the show and do a little bit of correspondence from an operator.

[47:36] So are you comfortable, John, coming back on?

[47:39] Can you just pinball podcast?

[47:40] You're awesome.

[47:41] You do that every once in a while.

[47:42] Because I do think this is a really interesting part of the hobby that, again, I definitely underservice it on my podcast where I'm just talking about, like, what's coming out next?

[47:51] And what are the rumors?

[47:52] Hot Wheels, by the way.

[47:54] What do you think?

[47:55] On location, hot wheels.

[47:56] Do you think that connects with the people who walk through the door of Jack Barr?

[48:00] Yeah.

[48:01] I don't think so.

[48:02] Right.

[48:03] Maybe I'm wrong.

[48:04] But, you know, I think I might have mentioned to you before I immediately have a problem with a PIMO machine having a brand from a toy company.

[48:15] Right.

[48:16] I don't know why.

[48:17] That's one thing that bothered me always about the transformers machine.

[48:19] Right.

[48:20] And I don't know why it just cheapens it to me.

[48:23] Now, that's in my mind.

[48:24] I get it to be an awesome game.

[48:26] But like, you put them, I don't know, I put a machine and it says, Mattel on it.

[48:31] You know, it looks like I just bought it at the KB Toys.

[48:34] Right.

[48:35] I used to work at KB Toys.

[48:36] God bless them.

[48:37] They're out of business.

[48:38] Yeah.

[48:39] Nice.

[48:40] Really good.

[48:41] Great job.

[48:42] Yeah.

[48:43] No, I just tried to save them.

[48:44] I mean, I get it.

[48:45] I get it.

[48:46] I think there's some toy lines or just beloved like GI Joe, Heman, Transformers.

[48:51] But those of all those have also spawned into movies and whatnot.

[48:54] But I mean, hot wheels is just it's going to be interesting because it's a huge property.

[48:59] I mean, I sell billions of them.

[49:01] It's been around for 50 years.

[49:03] But I think it's unclear whether or not that fan base will carry over and buy a pinball machine.

[49:12] That is the big gamble that if it is true, American pinball is making and thinking that that is the theme

[49:18] that will give people the buy machine.

[49:20] Now, as a collector, what do you want to, like do you think, this is a question I always have.

[49:26] I think any of these games are really collectible.

[49:30] And by that, I mean, I always see something worth collecting.

[49:36] How do you, how do you envision it?

[49:38] Like it just means so much to you that you just always want to be near it.

[49:42] Yeah, I mean, for me personally, I'm a collector of heart.

[49:45] So like, look, I have a handful of games that will never see the light of day in this bar.

[49:50] Is there my collectible?

[49:51] Now, what, what, can you list what some of those are that just mean that much that?

[49:55] I have a bunch of homies only and a handful in the box.

[50:00] I have like, I have, I know it's Spider-Man that's pristine, right?

[50:05] You know, I unboxed it.

[50:06] Spider-Man Black?

[50:07] No, I didn't like the color of the color.

[50:10] I like Spider-Man is blue and red.

[50:13] It's for something certain.

[50:14] Right.

[50:15] You know, it's personal preference.

[50:17] But I have a Spider-Man with less than 200 plays on it.

[50:21] I have a Lord of the Rings, Ellie.

[50:23] Right.

[50:24] I have a metallic premium.

[50:25] I have a beautiful judge dread.

[50:27] Some of these games are really fun games that I just can't allow for them to be like beaten in here.

[50:32] Lord of the Rings, Ellie, is the game I regret getting rid of.

[50:37] I had it all brass played it.

[50:39] Yeah.

[50:40] I sold it to Peter at Sunshine and I watched it get destroyed.

[50:44] It's destroyed.

[50:45] It is.

[50:46] It's a shame.

[50:47] That's a shame.

[50:48] It was a beauty.

[50:49] I had everything in that that you would want.

[50:52] Yeah.

[50:53] And now I walk over it.

[50:54] It's like watching your beautiful car just get like crushed.

[50:58] Yeah.

[50:59] I don't know if I should be saying this, but this was so funny.

[51:03] This thing that was said to me back in reciprocal.

[51:05] My friend and you sold me that Twilight.

[51:07] So that's a beautiful Twilight.

[51:08] Yeah.

[51:09] It's going to look that.

[51:10] That's a beautiful example of that game.

[51:12] I've been operating this game for 12 years.

[51:14] But he sold it to me originally.

[51:16] It was 12 years, 10 to 12 years ago.

[51:18] So I mean that game.

[51:19] I won't even tell you how much.

[51:21] But he soon as he sold it, he got in his house and was putting mods on it, shining it up.

[51:27] It just loved this thing.

[51:29] And then he offered it to me first because he needed to sell the two games he had.

[51:33] I put it in reciprocal right away.

[51:36] And I'm like, you know, you cool with me putting it on location.

[51:39] You know, I'll take care of it.

[51:40] Right.

[51:41] And he's like, no, do your thing.

[51:42] It needs to be loved, which is cool.

[51:43] And then he came in for league a couple of weeks after people are playing.

[51:47] And he says to me, he goes, I feel like I'm watching my ex girlfriend get gang banged by all my best friends.

[51:55] Yeah.

[51:56] Yeah.

[51:57] No, there's it's sorry people.

[51:59] I just I have to share.

[52:00] Yeah, for children, children don't know what that is.

[52:02] Yeah.

[52:03] Now it's hard.

[52:04] It is hard, especially when it's something that you've babyed and then you, and then it's out in the wild.

[52:09] It made it easy for me to sell it to someone local because they could just pick it up.

[52:12] I mean, I just sold my Batman and fast Eddie who I love to death came and picked it up and wrapped it for like two hours.

[52:19] And, and you know, right now, I'm glad to hear he takes that much care of fast Eddie.

[52:24] Oh, fast Eddie.

[52:25] If you haven't used him, I mean, he's a tank.

[52:28] I mean, he's an older gentleman who just does the best moves machines by himself.

[52:32] Yeah.

[52:33] Slinges and on his shoulder.

[52:34] He's incredible.

[52:35] And he just, he wraps the HUD of that.

[52:37] Yeah.

[52:38] I hate to be the guy that has to unwrap that.

[52:40] I'm so mad.

[52:41] I think you might just guide him like a 50 new jobs.

[52:43] Yeah.

[52:44] No, he's great.

[52:45] And so, so let's, so we're talking dream themes.

[52:47] We were talking, where were we?

[52:49] We were on what's coming out next or what?

[52:52] Did I lose my train of thought for the first time?

[52:54] So John, we're at like the hour mark pretty much.

[52:57] It goes by fast on Canadian Spinball podcast.

[52:59] Yeah.

[53:00] Any final.

[53:01] I can talk to him all day.

[53:02] Any final thoughts for the listener of the show before we, uh,

[53:05] we say, Sinara, to this episode, 440, something?

[53:10] I mean, I, I, I kind of, I, there was something I wanted to say on the show that I kind of like tossed back and forth in my mind.

[53:18] But I thought this might give it.

[53:21] So my, my girlfriend and I lived together.

[53:23] I actually met her through pinball.

[53:25] She was a regular at the bar here.

[53:27] And I was at, I had a crush on her for years.

[53:30] She was dating somebody.

[53:31] So, you know, I, you know, I stayed away.

[53:33] And I was actually dating someone at the time.

[53:35] And I just always had a crush on her.

[53:37] And, um, she was, we became friendly, but she wouldn't give me the time.

[53:42] Like, she, she wouldn't even entertain the idea.

[53:44] Like I had broken up with that girl at the time.

[53:46] She was still dating someone I was single.

[53:48] And I just was enamored by her.

[53:51] And then they eventually broke up.

[53:53] And here we are.

[53:54] She's, she loves pinball.

[53:56] She's my best friend.

[53:57] She's like just the raddest lady in the world.

[54:00] Right.

[54:01] And now we're having a baby together.

[54:04] Amazing.

[54:05] Yeah.

[54:06] And then we're going to do in March.

[54:07] And I love it.

[54:08] And we live together.

[54:09] And just so like, she's just like the best thing that's ever happened to me.

[54:11] Um, but I did always, you know, like, I just never loved the idea of having a child when you're not married.

[54:19] So, um, in the back of my mind, I always wanted to figure out a way to really profess my love to her.

[54:26] So, she's going to be listening to the show with me.

[54:29] As soon as you give it to me, I'm going to make sure she listens to it with me.

[54:33] And she'll have to sit through the whole thing just to hear me ask her if she would marry me.

[54:38] No way.

[54:39] Get the f out of here.

[54:40] Are you serious?

[54:41] I'm dead serious.

[54:42] I'm going to be my wife.

[54:43] Okay.

[54:44] I don't want to spread a man around you.

[54:45] I want us to have a baby while a married.

[54:46] That just old fashioned that way.

[54:47] And I love her to that.

[54:48] And I, I, I, I'll give her a moment to think about it in an answer.

[54:55] Wow.

[54:56] This is a, I'm speechless.

[54:58] Don, that's amazing.

[54:59] Yeah.

[55:00] Sorry.

[55:01] You're going to have a ring ready when she hears this and like, at this point, you're down on a date.

[55:05] Yeah.

[55:06] By the way, everybody, um, she'll be learning this as you do.

[55:09] But I have her grandmother's engagement ring in a safe waiting for her that her mom sent me a month ago.

[55:16] Okay.

[55:17] And you get all the necessary permissions from her side of the family.

[55:21] And the family that asked for his blessing.

[55:23] He was very happy.

[55:24] I get along great with her folks.

[55:26] They're super rad people.

[55:28] And, um, what's her name?

[55:30] What's her name?

[55:31] Morgan.

[55:32] Morgan.

[55:33] Morgan.

[55:34] Morgan.

[55:35] All right.

[55:36] Morgan.

[55:37] Yeah.

[55:38] I'm looking into the eyes.

[55:39] I mean, I think he's beginning to tear up in front of Canada, which never happens when I'm talking to a guy about pinball.

[55:44] Yeah.

[55:45] The only one crying right now is Zach Sharp.

[55:46] When you heard that, that Canada leaked the Stranger Things video.

[55:50] Yeah.

[55:51] So Morgan, I mean, I feel the love in the air.

[55:53] Now she knows you love her.

[55:54] Has she been waiting for this?

[55:55] Or what's up?

[55:56] I mean, I mean, I probably wouldn't divest like this if I wasn't fully confident.

[56:02] Okay.

[56:03] And what the answer would be.

[56:04] Okay.

[56:05] You know, but I thought that she's definitely just listen to the show for an hour, having no idea that that was about it.

[56:11] Does she listen to the show at all?

[56:14] Um, well, only when she like pops into the office.

[56:17] And I'm in there like, you know, whatever doing paperwork, who counted money and just like listen to the show in the background.

[56:23] Right.

[56:24] She's like, turn that.

[56:26] But, you know, I'm going to be telling her, hey, this was my episode.

[56:29] I want you to listen to it.

[56:30] Right.

[56:31] Okay.

[56:32] Right at that hour mark, she's all of a sudden going to be my fiance.

[56:36] I, that's amazing.

[56:38] I would maybe get like some dinner going.

[56:41] Yeah.

[56:43] I'm going to, I'm going to hopefully I get access to this as soon as it airs.

[56:48] So like she doesn't get the whispers of it.

[56:51] Yeah.

[56:52] I mean, obviously I've never had this happen before in my show.

[56:54] So we could talk.

[56:55] Yeah.

[56:56] We could, we could time this so that it works for you.

[56:59] I'm going to have a kid to hold this until whenever you're ready.

[57:02] Yeah.

[57:03] So are you ready this week?

[57:04] I'm going to, you can tell me that it's going to air in an hour from now and I will make sure that she's listening.

[57:09] Oh my god.

[57:10] Okay.

[57:11] So you're just ready to go.

[57:12] Yeah.

[57:13] Okay.

[57:14] Absolutely.

[57:15] I mean, let's get it done for a holiday.

[57:16] It's for a while.

[57:17] Holiday is a good time.

[57:18] Oh, absolutely.

[57:19] Yeah.

[57:20] It makes, it's the best gift you can give to someone.

[57:21] I want to go into 2020 knowing that this girl is going to spend the rest of her life with me.

[57:25] That's incredible.

[57:26] Look John, I'm, I'm super happy for you.

[57:28] I mean, as someone who locked in a, a woman like Brenda who loves, loves that I love pinball.

[57:35] She's not the biggest player.

[57:36] But yeah, we just got engaged in our rooftop.

[57:38] It was her and Bubba.

[57:39] I was like, it's all I needed in my life.

[57:41] Yeah.

[57:42] Had the red hot chili peppers planned.

[57:43] I was like, we married.

[57:44] I mean, that's that simple.

[57:45] And then yeah.

[57:46] And then it sounds like you're marrying your best friend, which is the best.

[57:49] She is absolutely.

[57:50] That's the most important part.

[57:51] She's just funny and she gets me and.

[57:55] See, people are going to think I stage it though to win a trippy, to win the third trippy award, which is not true people.

[58:00] I don't think of that.

[58:01] I mean, but this is just like, I leak stranger things.

[58:04] You know, the crazy thing is I thought of this as a smording.

[58:06] Really?

[58:07] Someone gets engaged on the show.

[58:09] And I threw out the entire show.

[58:11] I contemplated whether I was going to do it.

[58:13] Okay.

[58:14] Well, let me know how you feel because if you think differently, I can always like, I am.

[58:17] I have never been more.

[58:18] I don't mean about more, you know.

[58:20] Whether or not you want to use the greatest pinball podcast.

[58:22] I'm not a lot of really awesome things happen to me in my life.

[58:25] And she is by far the best.

[58:27] Amazing.

[58:28] Amazing.

[58:29] So much love is so much better than pinball.

[58:30] It just is.

[58:31] Yeah.

[58:32] Well, I can share the two.

[58:33] Absolutely.

[58:34] Absolutely.

[58:35] Well, you know, look, it's, this is incredible.

[58:37] John, I think there's nothing left to say other than Morgan.

[58:40] I know you said yes.

[58:42] This guy is incredibly in love with you.

[58:44] I'm looking at him right now.

[58:46] I'm just happy to be a part of this special moment.

[58:48] I mean, I think I think so.

[58:49] Thanks for giving me the platform.

[58:51] Yeah, no, thanks for coming on.

[58:52] And just so you know, I am, you know, not the shift.

[58:55] The topic off of something so beautiful.

[58:58] But I am, I really love that idea of being like an operator car.

[59:02] And I think there's like so much to add because like I know you,

[59:05] and you have a lot of listeners, but you were saying to me like,

[59:08] like very few of my listeners are, are, you know, location player.

[59:13] Or you said the most of my listeners are, you know, collectors, home collectors.

[59:17] Right.

[59:18] I don't know if that's true.

[59:19] You might be right, but I, I, the reality is majority of manufactured pinball

[59:25] goes to locations.

[59:26] Right.

[59:27] And you know, and I learned this when I bought my, when I bought my first machine,

[59:30] I put it on my apartment. I lived in the East Village.

[59:33] And I was like, okay, pinball machine in my apartment is so sick.

[59:37] Right.

[59:38] Played it for a week, maybe two.

[59:40] And then just end up walking back to 7B and playing the machine over there.

[59:45] And everyone's like, everyone knew me.

[59:47] It's pinball, John.

[59:48] Yeah.

[59:49] You're like, don't you have a machine in your apartment?

[59:50] Yeah, why do you do it?

[59:51] No, I do.

[59:52] But there's just nothing like playing in a bar.

[59:55] Yeah, you know, I'm the same way my people hear the knocker go off.

[59:59] And they're like, my mom bought me and my brother a Street Fighter II championed edition

[01:00:03] when we were young because she was sick of us going to their cave.

[01:00:06] I mean, the coolest kids in the block.

[01:00:08] But then you're like, you want to go out and I want to beat people at Street Fighter.

[01:00:11] Like it was no fun just like playing my brother all day long.

[01:00:14] And still to this day, I go into bar kid in St. Mark's.

[01:00:17] They have a Street Fighter II there.

[01:00:18] I'm 43 years old.

[01:00:20] Yeah.

[01:00:21] And I just kick everyone's ass.

[01:00:22] That's awesome.

[01:00:23] And then I went to Tokyo and got my ass kicked for two and a half a week,

[01:00:25] because everyone over there is so much better.

[01:00:27] One of my good friends and a very good football player, Adam Kane.

[01:00:30] He's used to compete in Marvel versus Capcom.

[01:00:34] And he would love to challenge you.

[01:00:36] Oh, yeah.

[01:00:37] Bring it on.

[01:00:38] Well, he likes to talk about how I told him I was pretty good at Street Fighter II.

[01:00:43] And he invited me to his apartment and he proceeded to.

[01:00:46] And he loves to tell his story still like eight years later.

[01:00:49] He proceeded to be me with every single character.

[01:00:52] Yeah, he can't let that one go.

[01:00:54] Yeah.

[01:00:55] Well, John, this is an amazing episode of Canita's Pinball Podcast.

[01:00:59] Morgan, my god, I'm so happy to be a part of your special moment.

[01:01:03] Love you, babe.

[01:01:04] Yeah.

[01:01:05] And you are the official Canita Pinball Podcast correspondent for On Location Play and Operators.

[01:01:12] So great.

[01:01:13] I'll be happy to keep you just like I inform the manufacturer of how the game is doing.

[01:01:17] I'll let you know too.

[01:01:18] Great.

[01:01:19] And you heard it here.

[01:01:20] He's going to have a Rick and Morty guys in a few weeks.

[01:01:22] So we'll keep you posted on when it arrives at Jack Bar in New York City.

[01:01:25] And I know a lot of you out there who travel to New York City often ask me, Chris, where should I go play?

[01:01:30] Where should I play Pinball?

[01:01:32] This is the place to come.

[01:01:34] I mean, the games are an incredible condition run by a guy who meticulously maintains these things.

[01:01:40] And they're not set up with cheap drains like some other place in Brooklyn than I usually do.

[01:01:44] You can actually move these machines with the tilt going off.

[01:01:47] And they actually have volume on like the place in Murray Hill.

[01:01:50] I'm not going to throw shade out just did.

[01:01:52] Anyway, John, thank you so much for coming on.

[01:01:54] Congratulations again.

[01:01:55] Great to be here.

[01:01:56] I'm looking forward to hearing Morgan's response.

[01:01:59] You'll be one of the first to know.

[01:02:01] This is great.

[01:02:02] I hope you're friendly.

[01:02:03] All right.

[01:02:04] We'll have happy holidays, everybody.

[01:02:05] This will be probably the last show before the holidays.

[01:02:10] I know I'll have to talk about stranger things.

[01:02:12] But I'm going to let John have this beautiful engagement moment more than talking about a big screen that flips down to hit a demigor.

[01:02:18] I appreciate that you're going to talk.

[01:02:20] You're going to have another episode.

[01:02:21] Yeah.

[01:02:22] I'm going to listen to it.

[01:02:23] We'll talk it out.

[01:02:24] We'll figure it out.

[01:02:25] All right.

[01:02:26] Thanks.

[01:02:27] I actually kind of find when you don't have an episode.

[01:02:29] I kind of like, didn't I write you?

[01:02:31] It was like, wait a minute.

[01:02:32] I know.

[01:02:33] I know.

[01:02:34] There's so much pressure.

[01:02:35] Anyway, thank you, John.

[01:02:36] Yeah, thanks, Chris.

[01:02:37] You're welcome.

[01:02:38] I'm glad you're here.

[01:02:39] I'm glad to go.

[01:02:40] I can go.

[01:02:43] I can go.
