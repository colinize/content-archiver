[00:00] The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

[00:01] These bigger than boys are digging it out.

[00:03] I have them like my lacerous clothes off, twerking in their bras and thongs.

[00:07] Timber, face down, boot it up.

[00:08] Timber, that's the way we like the word.

[00:10] I'm sick of it and all of spills.

[00:12] She say she won't, but I bet she will.

[00:14] Timber.

[00:14] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:19] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] It's a Sunday night.

[00:23] I know I don't have time tomorrow morning to do a show.

[00:26] You know how much I love you.

[00:28] I'm gonna do it on a Sunday evening.

[00:30] Here's what we're gonna talk about on this episode of

[00:32] Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:33] We're gonna talk a little bit about this punny factory and if we're gonna get

[00:37] this thing tossed off the roof of TNT, it's not looking good, people.

[00:42] We're gonna talk about George Gomez is actually behind all of these new,

[00:47] limited edition versions of his machine.

[00:50] I'm gonna talk about a conversation a gentleman had between himself and George Gomez.

[00:56] After this gentleman felt burned after he bought Elvira 40th anniversary edition,

[01:02] it saddens me to say that George is on board for all of this stuff and all of

[01:06] these shenanigans.

[01:07] We're gonna talk about Spooky Pinball.

[01:09] We're gonna talk about some clues they've been putting out into the pinball world

[01:13] about what their next title might be.

[01:15] And then we're gonna do a little bit something different on this episode of

[01:18] Canadian Pinball Podcasts.

[01:20] Instead of going into collector's corner, we're gonna do a little bit of an

[01:23] opposite of collector's corner.

[01:25] I'm gonna talk about games that were not worth collecting over the last few years

[01:30] in pinball because almost every single game has either held its value or

[01:36] gone up in value.

[01:37] In fact, it's absolutely bonkers when you look at used pinball prices and

[01:41] nothing's moving.

[01:42] Nothing is moving at all, but everyone is delusionally pricing their games.

[01:47] And we're gonna talk about the titles which just were not worth investing in.

[01:51] All right, let's start out with George Gomez real quick.

[01:54] So imagine if you were a Stern customer and you bought the limited edition

[01:58] version of Elvira.

[02:00] Let's just imagine you bought the first limited edition version of the game,

[02:04] which was the SIG edition of the game, the Signature Edition,

[02:07] which came with a little piece of the red couch.

[02:09] It came with Elvira's signature.

[02:11] And I think that game was originally $15,000 and they only made 99 of those

[02:18] machines.

[02:19] So what happened after that?

[02:21] Then Stern pinball screwed over all the owners of that game by making a 40th

[02:26] anniversary edition of the game, which was much nicer.

[02:30] Now they upped the amount of games they made to 199 of those purple ones with

[02:35] the beautiful and boss decals.

[02:37] But here's the thing, when those games came out, I think some people forget this.

[02:41] Those Elvira 40s, Stern was too coward to put a price on the machine and

[02:47] they gave them all to distributors.

[02:49] Now what happened was this, distributors I heard bought them for $15,000 and

[02:54] then they were told to price it at whatever they wanted.

[02:57] And the initial price that the distros put on this game was $25,000.

[03:03] And there were people who bought it at that price point, $25,000.

[03:09] Now most of these games, they sold around $20,000,

[03:14] which means distros were making $5,000 for everyone they sold.

[03:19] And now what does Stern go and do?

[03:22] They released what I think is even a nicer version of the game.

[03:26] I think this black and white blood kiss edition of the game is the nicest

[03:29] version of Elvira to date and it is only $13,000 when you compare it to what it

[03:36] used to be, $25,000.

[03:38] So this gentleman hit up George Gomez and was like, this is crap.

[03:42] Like you released another version of the game and how it undermines people who

[03:46] believe you when you say this is the final limited version of the game.

[03:49] Now look, Stern Pinball never said that that was the only limited version of the game.

[03:55] And that's the problem going on right now.

[03:57] And what George Gomez said, he said that he trusts the Chief Revenue Officer

[04:02] John Buscaglia and John Buscaglia comes from Topps Trading Card Company.

[04:08] And if there's anyone who knows how to screw over collectors,

[04:11] it's the trading card industry.

[04:13] Now this guy's been over at Stern Pinball for 11 years.

[04:17] I think John's been making some great moves, but lately,

[04:21] it really does seem like Stern Pinball is overdoing it.

[04:25] And the other point George Gomez was making, he was confused as to why this

[04:29] buyer was upset because he said, you have a game where there's only 199 of them.

[04:35] So clearly that game has more value than a game we're gonna make 500 of.

[04:40] And George is not wrong, but the point that George is missing is this.

[04:44] Every time you make another version that's limited,

[04:48] it will chip away the value of the previous limited games,

[04:53] of the previous versions of the game.

[04:55] Because the more games you add into the collector mix,

[04:58] the more you dilute the game itself.

[05:00] Nothing feels like it's the special version.

[05:02] And we saw the same thing because where George's argument does not hold water,

[05:07] is the 40th anniversary of the game is actually more sought after than the one

[05:12] where there's only 99 with the piece of couch because they made that version nicer.

[05:17] And I think they made this version even nicer than the 40th.

[05:21] And even though there's 500, it is now gonna become, I think,

[05:25] the Elvira that's the most stunning and stands out in a collection.

[05:29] And as someone who's looking down at their 40th, and

[05:32] if you drop 20 to $25,000 on the machine, and

[05:37] now the hot version to have is a new version that cost half as much as you spent,

[05:42] how does George Gomez not understand how crappy that's making their own customers feel?

[05:48] And Stern Pimol should not be making any moves that undermines people that are

[05:53] spending well over $15,000 on its products.

[05:57] So there you go, you know, George Gomez is in full support of all of these new

[06:01] variations of machines.

[06:03] Are we gonna get Godzilla like 80th anniversary or 70th anniversary?

[06:08] Are we gonna get a Jurassic Park 40th anniversary?

[06:10] Are we gonna get a Batman 60th anniversary?

[06:13] If Stern keeps doing this, man, it's just gonna be another reason why people are

[06:17] not gonna buy games new and box ever again.

[06:20] All right, so let's talk about this punny factory.

[06:23] Now look, it's not gonna reach the goal of $5,000.

[06:26] And the reason why is this, look, the content will be amazing.

[06:30] But the thing is this, everyone is now saying to themselves,

[06:33] is seeing that thing happen, is that worth it to me?

[06:37] Now the good news is, is Donald will refund anybody's money, so

[06:41] if you donate to the cause, you're not gonna lose any money if it doesn't happen.

[06:46] I think the last I saw it was around $1,000 has been raised since this thing

[06:51] went live on Friday.

[06:53] Now look, I've talked about it, Kerry Hardy's talked about it,

[06:56] a few thousand people have seen this thing, and

[06:59] it's not gonna reach the $5,000 goal.

[07:01] And I've been telling Donald, and he's a listener to the show, and

[07:04] he's gonna listen to this, the problem is this.

[07:06] Donald wants to recover some money on this punny factory, and

[07:09] then you have to ask the question, well, what is a punny factory worth?

[07:14] To 99.9% of the pinball buying community, it is worth almost nothing.

[07:19] Nobody bought these machines.

[07:21] I heard that Andrew McBain only sold 14 copies of this game.

[07:25] I don't even believe that.

[07:26] Where are the other 13 people who bought this game?

[07:30] There's one sitting on pin side for $5,000.

[07:33] Nobody's gonna buy it, nobody's buying that game.

[07:36] And I keep telling this to Donald, I'm like, man, just take whatever you can get and

[07:41] ship the thing to Todd Tucky because you're not gonna get anything.

[07:44] And the reason why he wants to get rid of it, he's not happy with the way it's

[07:47] functioning, so let's see what happens with this GoFundMe.

[07:50] Again, all of us would love to see this thing tossed off the roof.

[07:53] I think Donald's gonna need to cut the amount in half and get it to like $2,500.

[07:57] And then I think we'll see this thing fly off the roof of TNT.

[08:00] Don't hate me, Donald, everyone's still just scratching their heads as to why

[08:04] anybody would even buy this damn game.

[08:06] But I donated to the cause, I gave $50 to the cause.

[08:10] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[08:12] So spooky pinball sent me a prototype of a mechanism that was a bookcase that slid

[08:17] open.

[08:18] There was another clue they gave, it is also something that might be a spinning

[08:22] mechanism.

[08:22] So does that mean that it's gonna be a spinning bookcase?

[08:27] And there's a movie that has a famous spinning bookcase scene.

[08:31] It is no other than Young Frankenstein.

[08:33] So now this game is put into the mix.

[08:36] I don't think it's gonna be Young Frankenstein.

[08:38] I still think it's gonna be Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Evil Dead.

[08:43] I had better information that it's gonna be Evil Dead and

[08:46] it's the cabin in the woods that spins around and

[08:49] that's gonna be the major mech in the middle of the game.

[08:52] So is it gonna be Evil Dead and Looney Tunes?

[08:56] Is it gonna be maybe Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

[08:59] Maybe the Looney Tunes one is just the one that's not gonna happen.

[09:03] I don't know, it's really strange to think that spooky pinball is gonna use

[09:07] the same design for a horror movie and Looney Tunes.

[09:10] So we will see what happens over in spooky pinball land.

[09:13] I think we're gonna see this new theme in the next six months.

[09:16] It's gonna be exciting.

[09:18] And I'm glad that they're dropping clues.

[09:20] It's fun to speculate on what's around the corner from all of these companies.

[09:24] All right, what else is going on in pinball before we talk about games that

[09:27] you never should have bought in the first place, either because they haven't gone

[09:31] up in value or they've lost value over the years.

[09:34] I saw this interesting post about Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:38] This was a gentleman who's bought $70,000 in Jersey Jack Pinball machines.

[09:44] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[09:45] Like that's a loyal customer.

[09:47] That's a lot of cheddar.

[09:48] You gotta make $140,000 before taxes to invest in that many Jersey Jack machines.

[09:55] So this gentleman is in the open beta thing with Jersey Jack.

[09:58] And I guess there's like a forum or a discord where people can talk about

[10:02] the games themselves and give some feedback.

[10:05] And apparently this gentleman made a single statement comment that he was not

[10:11] a fan of Elton John Pinball and they banned him from the Jersey Jack forum.

[10:18] And he basically is like, I'm so done.

[10:21] I'm never buying another Jersey Jack machine again.

[10:24] Jersey Jack Pinball, you need to wake up.

[10:27] You can't be treating your loyal customers like this.

[10:31] Even if a guy says something disparagingly about Elton John,

[10:35] don't ban him before you know who he is.

[10:38] Maybe you should reach out to him and say, hey, like I heard your comment about Elton

[10:42] John, we can't wait for you to play one.

[10:44] We think when you play one, it's going to change your mind.

[10:47] That's how you handle a customer of yours that spent $70,000 with your company.

[10:54] Nope, they immediately put down the ban hammer on him.

[10:58] After hearing Jack's recent interview, I'm just feeling like this company is arrogant,

[11:03] they are smug, and they're not treating their customers the right way.

[11:07] Jersey Jack, you need to hold a meeting.

[11:10] Get your head of communications and marketing in the room.

[11:12] Ken Cromwell, get Brett Abbess in the room.

[11:15] Get all of your design team in the room and start to establish how you're going to start

[11:20] communicating with the Pinball community in a way that doesn't do boneheaded things like

[11:25] this.

[11:26] And I want to buy all of them a copy of a book.

[11:28] It's called Unreasonable Hospitality.

[11:31] And what they need to realize is when people spend this much money on their products, they

[11:36] expect unreasonable hospitality.

[11:40] I can get much better customer service walking into Omega to buy a watch that cost half as

[11:45] much money as a Pinball machine.

[11:48] It's like their only strategy is really fancy launch video, spam us on Facebook that they

[11:53] have games for sale, and that's it.

[11:56] That's it.

[11:57] They don't do anything else.

[11:58] Like what are they going to do tomorrow?

[11:59] What's their sales and marketing team doing every single week?

[12:02] They're seemingly not doing anything to build the right bridges between the brand and the

[12:07] consumers out there.

[12:08] And I bet they don't even care, right?

[12:09] I think that's the thing.

[12:10] That's the vibe I'm getting.

[12:11] That's the vibe I'm getting.

[12:12] They just look at people that are on Pinside and on Facebook, Pinball communities, like

[12:17] we are all toxic and we are to be avoided at all costs.

[12:21] Let's do the opposite of Canadian Collector's Corner.

[12:23] These are games that you should not have collected.

[12:26] I'm going to talk about what the title is and what you can get one for right now on Pinside.

[12:31] The thing I was saying earlier, almost every single Pinball game has held its value.

[12:37] Almost every single stern has gone up in value.

[12:40] Now the problem in Pinball now is this.

[12:43] I've been seeing so many of your beautiful game rooms.

[12:46] So many of you bought these machines for so much less money.

[12:49] And the good news is this, you own the machine.

[12:52] So you don't have to spend these ridiculous prices to get the very games you currently

[12:57] own.

[12:58] A lot of you are now like, well, I'm not going to go spend almost twice as much money now

[13:02] to build a collection when I've already got these incredible machines.

[13:07] Most of you out there probably could not afford to buy back your existing collection if you

[13:13] wanted to.

[13:14] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[13:15] It's not even that you don't have the money.

[13:17] You just wouldn't see the value in it at what your pins are being priced at in the marketplace.

[13:23] You know, I just saw Richie Wrenches coming back to Pinball really after he sold all of

[13:27] his collector's editions.

[13:29] He's now going to come back and try to rebuild his collection.

[13:32] Bad news for Richie Wrenches because you bought your freaking Pirates of the Caribbean for

[13:37] $12,500 for the collector's edition.

[13:40] And if you want to go back and get it now, good luck.

[13:43] You're going to have to spend $35,000 on it.

[13:46] And you think that's not going to put a sour taste in his mouth?

[13:48] All right.

[13:49] So what games are we talking about?

[13:50] First and foremost, I just want to let everybody know that you can still get a Blood Red Kiss

[13:54] edition of Elvira and Jurassic Park 30th, New and Box for MSRP.

[13:59] So just keep that in mind.

[14:00] You know, these things have not sold out.

[14:02] And I think that's indicative of the market.

[14:04] All right.

[14:05] The first game on our list of a game you should not have collected for sale, Houdini.

[14:11] Everybody's favorite disaster, Houdini.

[14:13] A game with a bunch of cool toys.

[14:15] The shots are terribly tight.

[14:17] It's not fun to shoot because Joe Balser designed this game without even a CAD design.

[14:22] He basically like closed his eyes and just screwed a bunch of posts into the play field,

[14:27] which makes this game really unenjoyable to play because a lot of them must make shots

[14:32] are super difficult.

[14:34] And so that is why coupled with the terrible artwork, you can get a Houdini for $5,800,

[14:41] not worth collecting.

[14:43] Another game you should not have collected.

[14:45] I lost money on this next game is Ultraman Collector's Edition.

[14:49] You can go get one again from Great American Pinball for $6,000 on the dot.

[14:55] This game has lost a lot of money and you know, it's just going to keep going down and down

[14:59] and down.

[15:01] Another game that if you bought one and I'm talking to you, Derek, you should have waited

[15:05] because Godfather Elyse are now selling new in box for $9,200.

[15:12] Derek, you just lost $3,000.

[15:15] And if yours is opened up, it's probably worth like $8,000 right now.

[15:21] So Godfather Elyse, a terrible, terrible purchase.

[15:25] The Collector's Editions are holding much stronger than the Elyse on the Godfather.

[15:30] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[15:33] You know, Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, I gotta say, it's holding pretty steady.

[15:37] I believe there's only one for sale right now and it's $8,500.

[15:41] So look, a spooky game that's flat in value is not a bad deal.

[15:45] I think it's actually a little bit more than that game was brand new.

[15:48] So actually Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle was not a bad buy.

[15:52] The Jetsons, I don't know, you know, there's only one available for $7,200.

[15:58] I know that was a contract game.

[16:00] There's not even a single Domino's game for sale.

[16:03] They didn't make many Domino's or the Jetsons spooky pinball.

[16:06] So you do have a rare machine.

[16:08] The only problem with both those games, they were contract billed.

[16:11] The machines are not that great.

[16:13] Here's another one where if you bought this one, you're kicking yourself.

[16:16] Hot Wheels.

[16:17] Hot Wheels, people.

[16:19] You can get a new in-box Hot Wheels for $6,000.

[16:23] Now I think brand new this game was around like $6,500.

[16:26] But man, new in-box after all these years and Hot Wheels is a great property.

[16:32] It just goes to show this stripped down game with no mechanisms in it.

[16:36] It really was a shame that they made a Hot Wheels game with no loop to loop, no car wash,

[16:42] no jump.

[16:43] None of the things that kids love to do with Hot Wheels was found in the Hot Wheels pinball

[16:47] machine, another terrible game to collect.

[16:50] All right, speaking of games that just haven't really held value, the first spooky pinball

[16:55] machine, America's most haunted, there is one available for $5,750.

[17:02] I mean, look, I'd rather have this than punny factory.

[17:04] But this is another game, even though it's spooky's first game and it's rare as can

[17:09] be, there's only 150 of these in the world.

[17:13] And you know, they're kind of just like holding value.

[17:16] But if you think about it, $5,700 for a game that's this rare is not a collectible item.

[17:22] Oh, the next one is terrible for people out there who spent $15,000 on a Toy Story Collectors

[17:29] Edition.

[17:30] You can go get one.

[17:31] The cheapest one available is coming from Flipping Out Pinball.

[17:34] What happened to all those Bo Peep Loops they were loving?

[17:37] So you can get the cheapest one from Flipping Out for $10,499 or best offer and this one's

[17:44] been up there for a while.

[17:46] You know what's nuts about Toy Story CE is like you can buy it from a distributor at

[17:50] such a cheap price and every other CE listed on Pinside is listed for much more money than

[17:55] this.

[17:56] And so is everyone else just delusional or are they going to wake up and realize you

[18:00] just lost $5,000 in two years on this game?

[18:04] Alright another game not worth collecting, Rob Zombie's Spookshow International.

[18:10] How many of these did they make?

[18:11] I want to say they made 500 Rob Zombies.

[18:16] Is that right?

[18:17] Did they make 500 or was it 305?

[18:19] I'm not sure.

[18:20] It's one of those.

[18:21] I want to say they went from 150 America's Most Haunted to something like 350 Rob Zombies

[18:27] and then 500 Alice Coopers.

[18:29] I might be wrong.

[18:30] But anyway Rob Zombie is a game that's not aging very well.

[18:34] It is one of those early spooky builds that feels much more like a garage build than a

[18:40] game made by a legitimate pinball company and you can get one for $5,200 or best offer.

[18:47] Another spooky game that's not holding much value or kind of stagnant is Total Nuclear

[18:51] Annihilation.

[18:52] Now remember this game came out it was like $6,500 and it went all the way up to like

[18:57] $8,000 or $9,000 before they made the remake.

[19:01] So now you can go get the original which I still would argue looks better with the original

[19:06] armor for $6,800.

[19:09] Again this is a game where like the collectability was there for a while but when they made more

[19:13] it's sort of like tank the collectability of the game.

[19:17] Next in our list everyone's favorite art package, October Fests which wasn't even released

[19:22] in October.

[19:23] You know what's sad about October Fests you can get one for $6,250.

[19:27] The real sad part about October Fests is it's actually not a bad game.

[19:32] It's loaded with toys, the code is super fun, it's got more in it than Galactic Tank Force.

[19:38] I think it's a more fun game to play than Galactic Tank Force.

[19:41] The real shame about October Fests is really how hideous it is.

[19:45] It is one of the ugliest games when you actually stand over it.

[19:49] It's really just bad artwork.

[19:51] Can you imagine if they got like Matt Andrews or Zambietti to make October Fests look more

[19:57] like Magic Girl?

[19:59] Like why couldn't they just make it look amazing?

[20:02] Because all the mechs are there but it's just hideous and then it's got that hideous American

[20:06] Pinball back box and that's one of the reasons why I think people just don't like the game.

[20:11] You know what games actually not tanking in value and I thought it would have?

[20:15] Legends of Vahala.

[20:16] I gotta give credit to this game.

[20:18] There's only one available and it's for $8,000 so this game has held its value kind of nicely

[20:23] for people who bought one.

[20:25] Now look, every single Stern LE has gone up in value.

[20:28] Like almost every single one.

[20:30] You cannot find a Stern LE to get for less money than it was MSRP.

[20:35] Maybe Led Zeppelin but those owners are starting to get crazy.

[20:39] But here's one.

[20:40] A WrestleMania LE, $7,500 bucks or best offer.

[20:45] Now I think WrestleMania LE when it came out brand new was $7,500 and for the longest time

[20:52] this game was selling for like $5,000, $5,500 for the LE of WrestleMania.

[20:58] So for it to be back up to $7,500 at a break even point just goes to show where the market

[21:04] is at people.

[21:05] You know I was also thinking about like Mustang.

[21:07] I'm like that has to be a game that hasn't held much value but there's only one Mustang

[21:11] LE for sale and it is $11,900 or best offer and the reason why is you know back in the

[21:19] day when they only made $500 and there's a lot of car enthusiasts people are not trading

[21:24] these games frequently.

[21:25] I mean there are more Pirates of the Caribbean's for sale.

[21:29] There are more Pirates of the Caribbean collector's editions for sale right now than Mustang LE's.

[21:35] And that's the thing about collectability gang it's like if there's none to get then

[21:39] the price will keep going up and up.

[21:42] Here's another game where if you bought one you just lost $3,000 Toy Story LE $9,000 or

[21:49] best offer it's just gonna keep going down and down in price.

[21:52] I don't know if this is worse than that or kind of even but Guns N' Roses LE's continue

[21:57] to sink $7,500 firm for an LE of Guns N' Roses LE and this is a machine with some mods

[22:04] and in good condition $7,500.

[22:07] I mean I'm gonna say this right now a $7,500 G&R LE versus a $10,600 Labyrinth this game

[22:17] is now a great bang for the buck.

[22:19] I mean G&R is still a great game I mean at $7,500 it's an even better game because you'll

[22:24] have more fun playing it knowing you got it for such a good price.

[22:27] Alright what else is on my list here?

[22:29] A dialed in LE just sold for $6,700.

[22:34] I mean that's crazy $6,700 there is a dialed in CE on Pinsight right now for $13,000.

[22:43] I would much rather buy a dialed in CE in which there's only like I think there might

[22:48] be like 150 of those in the world.

[22:50] I would much rather have a dialed in CE than spend $12,000 on an Elton John LE or a Toy

[22:57] Story LE.

[22:58] Alright are you ready for the last one?

[23:00] The worst game for any collector to have bought because it's lost the most money since it

[23:06] came out and it's a Keith Elwin bin is James Bond's 60th anniversary $14,300.

[23:14] Not only that for a game where there's only what 500 in the world right there's no other

[23:20] additions of this game only 500 Keith Elwin games in the world there's almost like 10

[23:26] of them available for sale at any given time on Pinsight.

[23:31] And it's never gonna have a second life it's not like people are gonna flock back to this

[23:35] damn thing.

[23:36] You know I didn't even mention Venom's tanked in value Foo Fighters has also lost $3,000

[23:41] in value both Venom and Foo Fighter LE's are not worth collecting they've both lost that

[23:46] much money in less than a year.

[23:48] So man there you go if you bought one of these games this year congratulations there are

[23:53] still deals to be had in Pinball.

[23:56] If you bought these games and just held on to them you haven't really lost much money

[24:00] but if you had bought other games instead of these games you probably would have doubled

[24:06] your money if you had sold those other games during the height of Covid.

[24:11] I just saw another Batman SLE changed hands for $30,000 it's holding nicely people it's

[24:17] holding nicely.

[24:18] One of 80 it's such a gorgeous machine.
