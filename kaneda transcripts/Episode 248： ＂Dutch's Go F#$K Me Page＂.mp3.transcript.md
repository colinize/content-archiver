[00:13] Welcome to the world's first ever super duper extra awesome

[00:25] Canada's pinball podcast. This is episode 248 on your host

[00:29] Canada. Let's talk about what is going on in the pinball world

[00:33] in the summer of 2018. Now the theme of this show is going to

[00:39] just be about the inability for certain companies to just

[00:43] pull the plug. And you know who I'm talking about and something

[00:46] happened last week that we heard was going to happen. And

[00:51] now it actually did happen and that was Dutch pinball has set up

[00:56] or they didn't set it up personally but there is a go fund me

[00:59] page that has been set up to raise money to help Dutch pinball

[01:04] figure a path forward to the manufacturing of the big obauski

[01:10] pinball machine. And I want to sort of talk about this from a

[01:13] few different angles because it actually reached out to

[01:15] somebody on the donation list who ended up donating a hundred

[01:21] euros to seeing this thing through. Now as of today, Dutch pinball

[01:27] has raised 750 euros. That's roughly a little bit less than a

[01:34] thousand us dollars. Their goal, they're close to it. Their goal

[01:39] is, are you sitting down? 500,000 euros. They're looking to

[01:46] raise on this go fund me page. And I don't want to read the

[01:49] whole thing. This seems to be the efforts of the Seattle 7, a

[01:55] group of pinheads that are funding the startup of Dutch pinball

[02:00] and they want Dutch to build this pin, right? And they say if

[02:04] you donate money, you can actually win prizes, even all the way up

[02:10] to a big obauski pinball machine in every donation of get this

[02:14] 20,000, sorry, 20,000 euros has a chance of winning one of the

[02:21] 15 dude's cars, one of 10 translates. And the goal of maybe

[02:27] getting a machine itself. Okay, so I want to talk about why we're

[02:31] here. And how ridiculous it sounds that they are trying to

[02:36] actually get people to donate their hard earned money to helping

[02:40] Dutch out of the hole. Now, I think the first thing people were

[02:43] just flabbergasted by was just the ultimate sticker shock of

[02:48] oh my god, do these gentlemen, Barry and Yop actually need

[02:52] 500,000 dollars to get things back in a good place. And the

[03:00] answer must be yes. And here's why because the Seattle 7, who set

[03:04] up this page, they're in constant communication with Barry and

[03:09] Yop. So they know firsthand the financial hurdle that is in

[03:14] front of these two men to get the big labauski produced. And

[03:19] it's almost like because that number is so big, I think it

[03:23] actually is going to prevent people from really donating and

[03:27] trying to get them any financial support. Now, that aside, I

[03:33] think anybody that donates money to this go fund me page is

[03:38] kind of foolish. It to me, it feels like you're throwing your

[03:41] money into a dumpster fire. And there's no point whatsoever in

[03:46] doing this because they're never going to raise 500,000 dollars.

[03:50] I mean, that is a ludicrous amount of money to ask for. But what

[03:55] I think it is, I think it's a wake up call. And I think it's a

[03:59] very sobering reminder to everybody out there, just how

[04:03] expensive it is to go into full-fledged pinball manufacturing.

[04:07] Right? I mean, a lot of times we speculate, well, they must

[04:11] have a couple hundred thousand. I don't know how much money they

[04:13] need. But I think this finally, finally, shows everybody out

[04:18] there that these two were nowhere near getting this project

[04:24] back on track. And that a raise lawsuit that is now upon them

[04:30] is going to probably most likely financially just sink the

[04:34] company. And they will probably end up declaring bankruptcy

[04:37] very much the same way that highway pinball did. And there will

[04:41] be no more Dutch pinball. And the reason why I want to say, you

[04:47] know, how this makes me feel. And I think for a lot of you

[04:49] out there, I think it sucks. I think it really does suck. And I

[04:53] reached out to Dave Bischop, who gave a hundred dollars. And I

[04:57] basically hit him up on Facebook. And I was just talking to him.

[04:59] I said, Hey, by the way, like, did you really give one hundred

[05:03] dollars to Dutch pinball? And he said, yes, he did. And he's an

[05:07] early achiever who paid in full for his big libouski machine.

[05:11] Now, not only that, he also bought some of the items that Dutch

[05:16] pinball is selling on their website now, there's he gave them

[05:20] another $1,500 for a play field. And I think a plastic set to

[05:26] go with the game that he hopes to get one day. And you know,

[05:30] at first, you might just say, well, how could you possibly do

[05:34] that? Like, how could this guy who's already out $8,500? How

[05:39] could he give even more money to bury in the up to try and, you

[05:44] know, like, what it makes no sense, right? And I know that's the

[05:49] initial response all of us must have is you've got to be a

[05:52] fool. You got to be a fool to do that. But I have to say, I

[05:57] feel really bad for the early achievers. And I understand

[06:00] the quagmire and the situation they're in, they're out $8,500.

[06:06] There is a very, very slim chance they're ever going to get a

[06:10] game. It's most likely that they're never going to see anything

[06:13] for that money. And that's a really difficult pill to swallow.

[06:18] And it's a lot of money. There's no way you can ever feel good

[06:22] about completely losing $8,500 and getting back absolutely

[06:28] nothing. But the fact that Dave donated $100 to the go fund me,

[06:34] the fact that he bought a play field and other things from

[06:38] bury in the up, it also shows me how terribly bad people want

[06:43] this game. How this is a dream theme for a lot of people out

[06:48] there in the pinball hobby. And they really don't want

[06:51] anything else other than their big Lebowski pinball machine. And

[06:56] it's really, I think this is this an alien. They really go down as

[07:02] being terribly sad stories in the end, terribly sad stories. And

[07:06] a lot of people are never going to get what they paid for. I

[07:10] also think when we look at where the market is on the big Lebowski,

[07:14] you know, Kim Mitchell selling his for $20,000. I think it's

[07:18] pin lawyer who who has a sale pending of his machine for $21,000.

[07:24] I think people will always consider the big Lebowski to be one of the

[07:29] coolest pinball machines ever made. And if you're a collector, it

[07:33] is a machine that you would love to have. And I think the theme

[07:35] itself is a dream theme for a lot of people. I know I see a lot

[07:39] of people speculating on, you know, is it worth $20,000 now? And

[07:45] if investors see games selling for $20,000, will they jump in and

[07:50] help save Dutch pinball? Because does that show them that

[07:53] people consider this game to be worth $20,000? Now, when I

[07:57] read that stuff, I think people are being a little bit foolish,

[08:00] maybe a lot bit foolish because the only reason we all know this,

[08:05] people are spending 20 to $21,000 for a big Lebowski pinball

[08:10] machine is simply because of scarcity and simply because people

[08:14] feel like they're never going to make them ever again. So if

[08:18] you buy one for $20,000, you're betting on the fact that no

[08:24] big Lebowski will ever, ever be made. And I think it's a risky

[08:28] gamble. I really do. I think it's a very risky gamble because we

[08:31] don't know if those new inbox machines from A or A are ever

[08:36] going to be offered for sale. So you're gambling on that. We also

[08:40] don't know if this game will ever be remade by somebody. Now,

[08:44] for the life of me, I cannot understand why? Why? Barrianyop,

[08:51] don't just sell this game to American pinball, to Jersey Jack

[08:56] pinball, to another manufacturer out there who could easily get

[09:02] this game into production because they have an assembly line and

[09:06] a manufacturing capability ready to go. I mean, I think it's

[09:10] absolutely enane that you would make October Fest if you're

[09:15] American pinball and not just go in and grab this game. The

[09:18] game, because we know one thing that people really, really

[09:22] want it. Now, the problem is this, and this is probably why

[09:26] nobody will ever do that is what do you do? If you're doble,

[09:32] if you're Robert Mueller, if you're Jersey Jack, what do you do

[09:37] about the early achievers who paid in fall and didn't get anything?

[09:43] Like, you just can't make those people whole. Like, there's no

[09:46] way to manufacture money out of thin air. And that's the

[09:51] problem with all of this is once you reach the point where there

[09:56] isn't money in the bank to buy the parts to make the games that

[10:02] were already purchased in fall, there's nothing you can do.

[10:06] Other than sell a lot more games and increase the price.

[10:12] Right, so let's say hypothetically each game was $8,000.

[10:15] You then would have to go sell future games at maybe $12,000

[10:20] a pop. And then that way every two games you sell,

[10:24] you've made enough increase to pay for someone's game who already paid.

[10:30] So you get $24,000 for two games versus $24,000 for three games.

[10:37] But it's just not going to happen. It's just not going to happen that way,

[10:40] because money's gone. The money's gone and it's just not

[10:45] going to come from anywhere now. So it's really, it's really,

[10:49] I just feel bad for these people. I really do. I hate seeing

[10:52] these early achievers. They still have hope. They still have hope.

[10:57] And part of me kind of just wishes that Dutch Pimball would

[11:03] once and for all just say it's over. Right, it almost feels like this game is

[11:08] inside some sort of Pimball hospice. And it's hooked up to a lifeline.

[11:14] And the prognosis is grim. There is no recovery.

[11:18] There is no way to recover from this. Unless they get like a billionaire

[11:22] bell out, which they're not going to get. And I don't know how long this is

[11:26] going to drag on. I really don't. So that's where we're at

[11:31] with the big Lebowski Pimball. And this go fun. Me, which again, I think if you donate

[11:36] to it, I think you're just throwing your money away. I think there's a lot more

[11:40] good you could do with your money than that. All right. Let's talk about highway

[11:43] Pimball. It's another thread that is popped up every once in a while. And it's

[11:47] just another thread that just won't really die. And I think people are now

[11:51] starting to share some of the candidate stories from behind the scenes of what

[11:56] it was like working on this title. For me, the thing that stood out the most

[12:00] was was Orch Lawson's comments this week just around the artwork and what

[12:06] went on with the game. And I think the big thing and the big reality check

[12:11] is that all of you were lied to. You were lied to about what they were able to

[12:16] make when it came to the game, the art package. Because as Orch says,

[12:23] Brian Allen's artwork was cemented to Fox. And it was approved, which meant that

[12:27] hand drawn artwork could have could have been used for the title itself.

[12:34] And I know Orch probably would have loved to have commissioned an artist to draw

[12:38] the package and art direct in the most spectacular alien game, but it was never

[12:42] allowed to because Andrew told him that wasn't a possibility. And so we're

[12:48] learning more and more about how ridiculous and how

[12:52] Ascony and a lot of the moves were behind the scenes at Highway Pimball.

[12:57] The other thing that people are trying to figure out right now is how many

[13:02] alien Pimball machines were actually made. And it seems like the consensus is

[13:08] less than 200 and more than 120. So somewhere in that ballpark, it's hard to tell

[13:15] because not all of the play fields have serial numbers on them. And I don't know if they built

[13:20] games in numerical order. Right, so you might have a play field with number 254. And it doesn't

[13:27] mean that's game number 254. You also have cabinets and other games that were made

[13:33] using full throttle cabinets and stuff like that. So that also, it makes it difficult to track

[13:41] what exactly is going on with the game itself. I would like, I would like for the Pimball brothers

[13:48] to actually release the total number of games that were made and shipped. And here's why,

[13:56] even though we don't like the outcome of the company, even though things ended poorly,

[14:01] this game still exists out in the world. And it is now a collectible item.

[14:09] Pimball collectors are out there. Alien Pimball was made by Highway Pimball and roughly 200 are in

[14:15] the wild. It would be nice to chronicle and know for the history of Pimball how many were

[14:22] actually produced and have an accurate number of that. Because I just think that would help people

[14:28] understand what they're getting into if they go to buy one of these games. I still think buying

[14:34] an alien Pimball machine is a very, very risky venture. I do think the game is a design,

[14:39] ticking time bomb. And I know for a fact that owning a game with these negative stories, both

[14:47] both Highway and Dutch are going to leave people. Take it for me. Owning both of these games

[14:54] will leave you disappointed. It will leave you unfulfilled. And you eventually, eventually get

[15:02] rid of either one of the games. I just think you'll come to the realization that is no fun owning

[15:08] something that is limited but has such a negative story attached to it. Now, I also think both of

[15:14] these games have shown me one thing and an important lesson that I think all manufacturers should

[15:20] take away from this is people do want a very limited game. That is rare. That not everybody has.

[15:27] That is worth collecting. And I think I saw a lot of that. I'm going to read more of your emails.

[15:31] But the very mention of a mystery pin that is going to be made in very limited numbers without

[15:38] a negative story attached to it has peaked a lot of people's interests. So I'm not shocked by that.

[15:45] I don't think anybody should be shocked by that. I just think that's where we're at in the

[15:50] pinball world right now. All right. All right. So speaking of I'm sort of going in reverse order where

[15:55] I normally start with like the big manufacturers and what's going on. Let's talk about pinball circus

[16:01] to be remade. And I saw this thread pop up again. And it seems like the individuals making pinball

[16:09] circus are also making kingpin. And they've decided to make kingpin in front of Python,

[16:16] Angelo's pinball circus. Now, now the thread where they announced they were going to remake

[16:24] pinball circus that thread was started four years ago. Four years ago. It's amazing how time flies

[16:32] when people tell their pinball intentions. But it's kind of become a joke. And here's why.

[16:40] Python, Angelo's pinball circus is probably one of the most weird, unique, and out of this world

[16:50] pinball designs. But ultimately, ultimately as funky as it is, it's also probably one of the

[16:57] worst design pinball machines ever to the point where it's barely playable. And so now they have

[17:05] to try and make it playable. And why even bother? Why bother spending four years trying to re-engineer

[17:15] a complete disaster? I get that they want to pay homage to Python, Angelo. But ultimately, at some

[17:23] point, these designers of yester years, sometimes they have duds, sometimes they have concepts that

[17:32] just should never be made. And I do think that this is one of those things that should just be laid

[17:38] to rest and just call it a day. Because years and years and years are going to go on. And I don't

[17:45] even know, do those people who, do they pay for those 12 prototypes? You know, some of you out there,

[17:51] you might be okay with freezing your money for four years, five years. I just think it's insane.

[17:57] I also just don't think we're going to see Kingpin anytime soon either because building one off

[18:02] prototype, that's one thing, you know, manufacturing a game is another. You know, it's interesting.

[18:08] So I want to read what they said. And again, remember, these guys have never manufactured anything

[18:14] more than like a prototype. Someone asked them if they're going to go into large production in

[18:20] the hundreds. Or if that's still undecided, they asked about that for pinball circus. And they

[18:27] wrote the following are primary objectives to get as many of these into collectors hands as

[18:32] possible to honor Python. But we really have no idea how big of a run there will be yet. We know

[18:38] it will be smaller run than Kingpin though. There will be 12 sample games made after that. It all

[18:45] depends on ultimately what the demand will be for the production run. 250 is probably the minimum

[18:52] sized run where the economies of scale make it more reasonably priced. And unless someone like

[18:58] Chuck E. Cheese wants them for all their stores, I'm not sure there is demand for more than 250 of

[19:04] them at the max. There are so many custom parts on a pinball game like pinball circus that building

[19:12] them in small batches would probably make them significantly more expensive than we like them to be.

[19:17] But we will do that if that's what the demand determines. All right. So again, like I just think

[19:22] these gentlemen, I applaud them for their efforts. I think they completely don't understand

[19:29] like where the collector market is at. And by that I mean, there is no way. Would you trust two

[19:37] guys basically in their basement to build 250 games. Kevin from Skippy anybody, that's the problem.

[19:45] Is there's no path to manufacturing that many games by these two people or these three, whoever's

[19:51] on this team, there's no company, there's no warehouse, they don't have a line. This isn't spooky

[19:56] pinball making the games. So I'm just really like, I don't even understand how when you can't even

[20:02] finish one of the games, you're talking to us about numbers like 250 is the minimum,

[20:09] is the minimum. Look how many years it took Charlie to go from zero games to 150 to 300.

[20:21] Charlie has a company around him. He's got employees, he's got, it's his focus.

[20:27] These gentlemen, this isn't their livelihood, this isn't what they're doing every day for

[20:32] nine to ten hours a day. I just, I think we've reached the point where you have to be focused and

[20:39] dedicated to making pinball a reality. And I just think these projects that are sort of doing it

[20:45] on the side and it's like a side hustle thing. And then you also want to talk to people about

[20:51] manufacturing in the hundreds. I kind of think it's comical. I just don't think any that's going to

[20:58] come to fruition anytime soon. All right. Again, four years ago, they said they were going to

[21:04] and now remake pinball circus four years have passed. And now they're already on to game number two

[21:11] and they didn't even finish game number one. And I just take it, take it for what it's worth.

[21:18] Take it for what it's worth. All right. Somebody told me today that some of the monsters artwork

[21:24] might have been put up and then he ganked down immediately on pinside. Of course, I get blamed for

[21:29] that immediately. I did not post any monsters artwork on pinside. I'll leave it at that. I said,

[21:36] I wasn't going to talk about this stuff or leak any of the materials. What I'll say is this.

[21:43] You know, this stuff looks great. And Stern has, I think, another hit on their hands.

[21:50] But Stern also doesn't want to get ahead of themselves. They want there to be hype and they want

[21:57] there to be attention for Deadpool when that happens later this summer. From what I can tell,

[22:03] people seem to be lukewarm about Deadpool. There are people are hoping that's not the design.

[22:08] It sure looks like a Gomez design. To me, it's got like the sword lock on the right side. Like,

[22:13] Lord of the Rings, it's got the Gomez ramp like in Batman in there. So I wouldn't be shocked if

[22:20] that was the final design. But it's interesting to me that pinside yanks down Stern leaks

[22:31] when Stern does absolutely nothing for pinside. If you think about it, Stern doesn't activate

[22:37] on pinside. Stern doesn't post on pinside. Stern doesn't do anything for pinside. Yet pinside does

[22:45] something for Stern. It's probably just Robin being a good guy. It really is though. It's funny

[22:51] to me because in the auto world, when a car, like a spy shot of a car is seen out in the world,

[22:59] people share it all over the place. But it's different with pinball because this isn't like,

[23:04] this game is out at a barcade in disguise and it's a white wood and someone took a picture.

[23:12] It really is artwork. But the thing about monsters is nobody's seen the playfield. Nobody's seen

[23:18] the layout. The design still is a mystery. We know that it's going to be, I'm hearing now,

[23:23] it's franchion art. Borg is designing it and Sullivan is doing the code. So I look forward to it

[23:30] I really do. From what I see, I potentially could be putting one next to my Batman and I'll leave it

[23:36] at that. But I think Stern's got another hit on their hands. And I hope they don't beat up anybody

[23:40] for these leaks always will happen. It's just the nature of pinball. All right, what else is going

[23:45] on in Sternworld? Nothing much. I'm not going to just manufacture news and make up stuff and talk

[23:52] about Stern issues when I'm really not seeing any. I'll read some of your emails. I think someone

[23:57] wrote about Stern quality. I saw this. This was interesting. Someone put up a thread. It was called

[24:04] Price Check. Keller restored monster bash. All right. And he was asking how much is a Keller

[24:11] restored monster bash worth now in 2018? And you know, for collectors out there, we all a few years

[24:19] ago. Remember it was like Keller restored games, hepp restored games. You know, these things were

[24:25] always fetching far above $10,000. You know, $12,000. It was the wait list to get a game restored by

[24:33] these gentlemen was maybe sometimes even a year or more to wait for your game to be restored.

[24:41] And then Chicago gaming company had to go and completely fuck up everybody's plans to collect these

[24:47] restored, you know, high end pins from yesterday years because they just basically said we're going

[24:53] to remake them all. We're going to improve upon the display and we're going to give you a top

[24:57] or we're actually going to make the game look more like a modern version of the game you love.

[25:03] And it's brand new, new in box, right? So you don't have to go pay someone to completely restore a

[25:08] game that has been around for 20 years, you know, being beat on in our Cades or or whatnot. So it

[25:17] completely, to me, I think the remakes have completely fucked up the high end restore market.

[25:24] But I think there's another thing happening too because everyone always just says that like,

[25:28] oh, monster bash remake is the reason why you're never going to sell a restored monster bash for

[25:32] $11,000 right now. I'm not even so sure it's just that. I think the other thing that is really going

[25:39] to chip away at the value of games like monster bash of the older games. I think the biggest thing

[25:48] that is going to constantly see the prices decrease is simply this is people want the newer machines.

[25:57] There are so many new games coming out that people want to play that there's only so much money

[26:03] people will invest. There's only so much room people have for pinball machines that people want

[26:09] the new shiny thing. They want the new experience. People have played monster bash for over 20 years.

[26:17] People have played these games. I think like almost 30 years, right? Maybe 20 years. So they've

[26:22] played these games for so many years that the experience of playing a monster bash is never going

[26:28] to be new again. And the more they play it, the more I think games do get boring. And even if the

[26:37] game is great, you will reach a point where you just want a new experience. And the great news,

[26:43] if you're in the pinball hobby right now, is so many new games are coming out and will come out

[26:51] that I just think people would rather get the new stuff, right? Now look, I still think monster

[26:57] bash remake will sell well. I think Big Bang Bar Remakes will sell well. Of course, these games

[27:02] are classics. And I actually think people are going to want the CGC versions of these games more

[27:09] than the originals. I'm not one of these people who believes in serial matching original

[27:14] balli Williams games will be the ones that collectors always want. I don't think that's the case. I

[27:20] think people are going to want the newer versions. And again, because I think that what they're

[27:25] delivering, and if they start reworking code, forget it. It's the new stuff people will want.

[27:31] So I think those two elements are working to constantly drive down the price of those games.

[27:38] All right. All right. We heard on this week in pinball. First of all, Jeff, congratulations on

[27:43] the one year anniversary. Your site has been a godsend to anybody out there who does a pinball podcast.

[27:50] And I think your site has also been a godsend to anyone out there who just wants to learn what's

[27:55] going on in the pinball world without having to deal with all of the pinball drama and the negativity

[28:01] on the forums. You just get the info and you're on. I like the fact I even like the fact that there's

[28:06] no comment section. So you don't have to like listen to people just being negative and spewing all

[28:10] this hate. All right. We heard that a spooky does not have the license for Godzilla yet. I know

[28:19] that's like a dream theme for them. I kind of wish like no, you know, I want spooky to be able to

[28:25] make the themes that are their dream themes. And I hope they get a chance to I'm part of me

[28:31] worried that Stern will gobble up these themes. And then the people making them won't have the

[28:37] same level of passion that spooky would put into the game. Although you could argue that from a

[28:44] mechanical and engineering standpoint, Stern could do much more with their resources than spooky

[28:51] ever could in making a Godzilla game. And so that's that's that's the trade off is Stern's resources

[28:58] far out number spookies. But spooky's passion for a title like that I think would would blow Stern

[29:03] away. And that's not to say Stern people aren't passionate about these themes because I think a lot

[29:08] of people are passionate about Godzilla. It must kill Charlie to see Stern Pimbal making the

[29:16] monsters. I mean, when your your company is called spooky Pimbal and and that's sort of like horror

[29:22] sort of genre. The monsters is exactly the kind of game that should have a little ghost on the

[29:30] speaker grill. And it must it must hurt them that that Stern is making that title. All right. And

[29:36] there's not much going on in the spooky world. People are waiting for Alice Cooper nightmare castles.

[29:41] There's some discussion about Rob Zombie Pimbal machine and getting the code to be finally

[29:46] complete. Some guy wants his reverse flippers really badly. I think Rodo Davis in that thread

[29:52] constantly saying how great the game is. I think you know Rob Zombie is going to go down as like

[29:58] you know just a B title. I don't think it's going to go down as one that people like are clamoring

[30:03] I did find it interesting that someone was offering a Alice Cooper nightmare castle spot. They

[30:10] were selling their spot for for $900. So you could get their spot for a $100 cheaper than if you

[30:18] were to go in originally. And I'm wondering if this is going to create this can be an interesting trend

[30:24] is if people start selling spots what that looks like. And our people are going to have to offer

[30:31] some sort of incentive for you to go in on their game. So we'll see what happens there.

[30:37] Anything else going on let's see do do do do. Jersey Jack Pimbal the new Hobbit code update seems

[30:43] to be going really well. There might be a problem with the ramp hold magnet that people are noticing.

[30:50] The Pirates of the Caribbean thread is where exactly you would expect it to be at this stage in

[30:57] development right before a game comes out right before a game ships. Here's always what happens

[31:02] in the community. People start to create salacious and false rumors about there must be something wrong.

[31:11] I don't think there's anything wrong. I firmly believe we are going to see Pirates of the

[31:16] Caribbean very shortly. I don't think the sky is falling. I think people just get impatient and

[31:22] I think they start to panic a little bit. And I think that's just a byproduct of people being

[31:29] excited. I also think every single Jersey Jack thread always invites the trolls to come in

[31:38] and just say negative stuff. For some reason the trolls love to complain about

[31:45] Pimbal manufacturing when they aren't even going to buy a game. It's really easy to go in there

[31:50] and shit stir and be like something's wrong. They must not have sales or dialed in sales must not

[31:56] have been you know no like there is no information to indicate anything is wrong. The only thing we know

[32:04] is the game is coming out far later than we expect it. And I do think the delay is definitely going

[32:11] to hurt sales definitely. There's no way around it. I don't think they're going to sell out of

[32:16] the collector's editions. But here's what I'm excited to do. And I know I've been sort of like I

[32:22] don't like the theme. I think this is the theme we have this is the theme we're getting. It's not

[32:26] the theme we want it. Okay put that aside. It is what it is. I still do want to jump on the game

[32:32] and play it and put my headphones on and see what the experience is like. Okay. That's what I want to do.

[32:39] And I think we're at the point now we're all we're all that's left is for us to play Pirates of

[32:45] the Caribbean and make up our minds on it. I've probably been somewhat unfair in like crucifying the

[32:53] choice of theme and nissen that right and how they're launched in the game. And yeah like Jack did

[32:57] everything he said he wasn't going to do. All that being said the games could still be great. I don't

[33:03] like I don't have first hand experience saying I've played Pirates of the Caribbean and it's not

[33:08] great or it's not fun or it's not this or it's not that. No all I can do is watch videos and say I

[33:14] don't want to keep pressing the stupid apron you know the apron button to collect gold all the time.

[33:20] I don't want to do that. I don't want to do it's but I don't know what the actual experience is like.

[33:26] And I think people who have played it have had a really good experience. So that's I'm just going

[33:31] to leave it at that. I want to I want to play the game. All right. All right. Anything else going

[33:37] on the pinball world that I should know about that I've missed on this episode of Canadian pinball

[33:41] podcast. Not really not really. You know I think we're at a point now where I'm really curious

[33:49] as to what's going on a deep route. I want to talk to Robert Mueller. Hopefully hopefully

[33:54] sometime soon. I do like the fact that they've sort of just gone quiet. I think it is beneficial to

[34:01] just go quiet until you have something to say or show. But better to show than say in pinball right.

[34:08] I think people have been curious as to where the pinball brothers at. Where they they've

[34:12] gone off and they're going to go make queen. I don't think they're going to succeed. There's

[34:18] just no way they can survive and people will forget and people will go in on a another machine by

[34:29] the same people who try to salvage Andrew highway's dream. But look I'll never understand the

[34:38] decisions people make in pinball. I just won't. I'll never understand how successful men in the

[34:44] world of business always seem to make foolish decisions when it comes to pinball. And I have to

[34:52] imagine behind all of these rich men who keep sinking money into pinball there's a significant

[34:59] other in their life whether it's their children or their wife or their partner who's probably like

[35:05] what the fuck are you doing. You're telling me that you're going to sink $100,000 or $500,000

[35:14] into a pinball venture and take five years to try and get the game off the ground. It's like

[35:22] why why is there any news on home pin and thunderbirds. Do you even care? No, I'm just going to skip

[35:28] over that game. All right, let's talk about some of your emails and then I'm going to let you guys go.

[35:34] Here we go. Let's go down. We're going to go down from the bottom up. All right, let's see.

[35:40] This is the first new email I got from Todd Yoder and that's subject is mystery pin. Chris,

[35:47] I enjoy your podcast and I just heard your announcement of the mystery game coming. I am intrigued.

[35:54] Please add me to your list of interested collectors and potential buyers. All right, Todd, you're on

[35:59] the list. I got an email from Andrew Frazy. I hope I pronounced that right, Andrew. He said,

[36:07] hey, Chris, first time emailing you. Thank you for your podcast. Your style is very entertaining

[36:13] and digestible. I noticed this listing for Stern Pimball on Glass Door. This could at least

[36:21] partially account for the quality issues lately. I believe Glass Door is like an in like what it's

[36:29] a site that tells you what people make it Pimball or not sorry, what people make it companies. It's

[36:35] sort of like seeing behind the Glass Door. So people share like salary ranges and they I think they

[36:41] can write stuff anonymously to share what a company pays. And so here we have, let's see,

[36:49] quality manager at Stern Pimball. So I guess these are jobs they're looking for and it looks like

[36:57] quality manager do do do. I guess they're looking for quality manager at Stern Pimball and that was

[37:03] posted nine days ago. There's a couple other companies that they're not Pimball related where the

[37:09] salaries for quality manager range from six to three thousand dollars all the way to 110 thousand

[37:14] dollars. Look, Stern quality, you have to remember how many games Stern makes. If the majority of

[37:26] Stern games had quality issues, Stern would be at a business. I don't think there's any denying that.

[37:33] Would I have liked to have seen them, you know, put cabinet brackets into a super early Batman

[37:39] absolutely. Have I had any problems with my Batman? I had a node board go down and they replaced it

[37:45] immediately. So I think for the most part, all Pimball machines will have issues. Stern will help

[37:52] you get a fix. Look, if there's one company that I would, if there's one company, I don't

[37:58] look. I think Jack's quality, I think their customer service is great. I think Stern's is great. I think

[38:02] American Pimball is great. I think Spooky's is great. I think all of the companies that are surviving

[38:09] the sort of, you know, the apocalypse of the boutique Pimball industry have great customer service

[38:17] because without a doubt you can't survive in Pimball without customer service. You know, and

[38:23] that's a telltale sign that a company is doing well. They actually pick up the phone when you

[38:29] call and they get you replacement parts. I got an email from Dan G. Dan says, you know, the title

[38:35] was upcoming mystery Pimball. You see, there's a common theme here. He says, hey, Canada,

[38:42] I've been listening to your podcast for a couple months now. I'm really glad you came back.

[38:47] I'm a collector out in California and I'd love to be put on your interest at list. All right,

[38:52] well Dan, thank you for listening. I'm happy to be back. I think there's a lot of guys like you

[38:56] man who are collectors and just want something new and interesting. I think a lot of people who

[39:02] are Pimball collectors, you know, a lot of them don't share their collections on Pinside. A lot of

[39:08] them aren't very vocal on the forums. And there's a there's a lot of people out there that are just

[39:16] these amazing personalities. A lot of successful men out there and they don't need to flaunt it.

[39:22] They don't need to brag about it. But they do want to have a work of art. And here's the other thing.

[39:29] You know, I keep saying like, it's not just that the fact that this mystery pin, I believe,

[39:34] is going to be rare. It's not just the fact that I think it's going to be beautiful.

[39:38] I also am hopeful that it's just going to be a damn good game. Like, it's not the most

[39:44] important thing. Now, look, I say all this with a caveat because this is being built on a shoestring

[39:52] budget and all the hard work is being self-financed by somebody. And this isn't something that

[39:59] has like all these backers has all this stuff. But again, it's not a lot of plan to be made.

[40:05] Like, if I told you someone's going to make 20 games and then I told you someone's going to make

[40:10] 2000, which one is more likely to happen? Right? I'm going to make 250 pinball circuses or

[40:19] we're going to make 12, which one you think will happen. Right? And that's what's happening here.

[40:25] You know, I think we all believe that even like, even though it was in his mom's basement,

[40:30] we all believe that Kevin Koolik probably would have screwed those games together and got them to

[40:37] people. You know, it's amazing as that sound saying it now. I still think he would have done it

[40:43] if the witch hunt didn't happen. All right? All right. You got an email from George.

[40:49] George is a camp pronounce your last name. George, George, H. George, thank you for emailing me.

[40:57] He says, Hey, bro, love the podcast. Keep it in real. I'm interested in this exclusive machine.

[41:03] If you can put me down the list, I'm in Australia near Wayne and Ryan. All the best boss. Well,

[41:10] George, thank you. I'm not sure if it will be shipping internationally, but I bet you Wayne will

[41:18] want this because Wayne grabs everything. I got an email to do this is spam email asking me how to

[41:27] monitor. They want to monetize my site. I got an email from George went. George says, Hey,

[41:32] Chris, would you mind adding me to the people interested in the rear pinball machine that you

[41:36] mentioned in your podcast? If it's a theme I like, I would be very interested in a collectible game.

[41:41] Like you, I have a Batman SLE and I have a pirate C on order just patiently waiting for it to

[41:48] ship. Thank you so much. Well, George, yeah, I mean, look, here's the deal. Here's the deal, guys.

[41:52] Maybe I didn't clarify something and I want to clarify something. This game, it's going to be like

[41:58] first come first get it like kind of thing. There will probably have to be some pre-order dollars put

[42:05] down for the machine again because that's how it's going to work. It's not going to be paying full.

[42:10] It's not going to work like that. But I think when you see something, I don't think you're going to

[42:18] have a problem putting a small deposit down to reserve your game. That's that's that's look and

[42:27] here's the thing. I mean game number one, I'm going to I want to go in on. But knowing all I know,

[42:34] you remember this, knowing all I know about what has happened in the pinball hobby over the last

[42:39] few years. I will not be fooled. I will not be suckered. I will not go in on anything unless I feel

[42:49] confident that it's actually going to happen. And I say this because we all know that making pinball

[42:56] is hard. You know, there's another company that also is supposed to be coming out with a game

[43:01] sometime. I and I have not heard from them since and their game looked like it was done and then

[43:07] they just like disappeared. And I don't know like what's the deal there. And again, like there's

[43:15] those of you in the hobby who know some of these things going on and those of you who don't. But

[43:21] if you are not one that wants to take a little bit of a risk, then you should just stick with

[43:27] Jersey Jack Stern, spooky American pinball, Chicago gaming. There's so many. There's so many

[43:35] sure things. There's so many games in a box. The only problem is when you buy all those games in

[43:42] a box that that are sure things, there's a very, very good chance that you are just not going to

[43:49] have a pinball experience. That is rare. And that is worth collecting per se. And that's just my opinion.

[43:57] I think collectibles should be something that isn't found everywhere. And that doesn't see,

[44:03] I just think you can own pinball machines. But I think you're always going to want to shuffle those

[44:08] games out of your collection. But you'll be very hesitant to let a very rare thing go that would

[44:16] be hard to replace. Okay, that's why people who own, think about it. People who own original

[44:22] kingpins or the original King Kong from Daddy East. Why don't those games come up for sale often?

[44:30] Because it's not about the money. It's about the ability to actually get one again. You're right.

[44:36] And nobody wants to feel like if they regret selling it, they won't have it again. And there's

[44:41] nothing like having a super rare item in a collection that you can tell a story about. It's like,

[44:46] when I used to have my arcade collection, I could always tell the amazing story of the Fixed

[44:51] Felix Jr. game and how Disney made it and what they did and how they scuffed it up and how they

[44:57] used it as a promotion. It had a story. It had a story. If I had a Pac-Man there, oh yeah,

[45:03] they made 200,000 of these. Oh, they only made like 40 of these Fixed Felix Jr. half of which

[45:10] were destroyed when they got rid of Disney quests. And only 20 of them are in the wild. And if you

[45:15] want to play a Disney original, there's only 20 available out there in the world. Now it becomes

[45:21] worth something. Now it becomes worth collecting. All right, guys, I appreciate you tuning in to

[45:26] episode 248. I would love to hear from you. How is your pinball summer going? What are you looking

[45:32] forward to in pinball? What's the thing that's got you most excited? Please email me. I want to stop

[45:39] just emailing the generic like, you know, reading the emails about the mystery pin. Email me what's

[45:44] got you most excited in the pinball hobby right now. And I will read. I will read that out on the

[45:50] air again. Canada pinball at gmail.com. Everybody be happy. Be healthy. Enjoy your pins. It's just pinball.

[45:58] Don't crucified people. Don't go on witch hunts. Don't you know, don't get too mad about games

[46:06] if they're delayed and shipping. And if you lost money, we feel bad for you. But everyone,

[46:12] you know, we've all learned a lesson. And I think we've all grown up a little bit and realize

[46:16] the reality of making pinball. That's episode 248. I'm going to leave you with this crazy little

[46:21] Japanese anime song. Enjoy.
