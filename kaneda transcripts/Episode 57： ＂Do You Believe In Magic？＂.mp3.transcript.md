[00:00] I have no idea what song that was but it's called Magic Girl and we have to talk about

[00:21] all the ongoing developments that are happening.

[00:24] As I said earlier, this week has just been like the busiest news week in the pinball universe

[00:30] in the last three years that I've ever seen.

[00:33] Lots of speculation, lots of rumors, lots of accusations, see my name being tossed around

[00:38] a bunch of times and I just want to clarify some stuff and that's the point of this sort

[00:42] of micro podcast.

[00:44] I want to discuss what's going on with American pinball.

[00:47] I want to just for the record clarify my position in all of this and then I want to talk about

[00:53] what I think this means and what I think the next steps are going to be as we move towards

[00:57] EXPO 2016.

[00:59] Once again, I want to thank everyone for tuning in to Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:03] I hope you know this takes a bunch of time to get you guys my thoughts and talk about

[01:08] what's going on in the hobby but I know you appreciate it.

[01:11] Every other podcast by the time they get out, we've already discussed this thing five

[01:14] which ways.

[01:15] Alright, so first and foremost, I have absolutely no affiliation with American pinball.

[01:22] I don't.

[01:23] I am not associated with them.

[01:25] I've been talking to Jay Poppin about a year I haven't communicated with Scott over

[01:31] at American pinball or Vishal, the other gentleman who's part of this organization and they're

[01:37] obviously or other people helping out to get these pinball machines made and I have absolutely

[01:42] zero communication with them.

[01:44] That being said, instead of going on to pinside and screaming and kicking and crying, I reached

[01:49] out to them and I'm hoping to talk to Scott this week about American pinball.

[01:53] I think we're about to see some really exciting news that could just blow up the whole entire

[02:01] pinball universe in the short term.

[02:03] So no affiliation.

[02:05] The second thing I'd like to address is duplicate account on pinside, Rick Thorn.

[02:11] Yes, I of course I am Rick Thorn.

[02:13] I have not ever said that I'm not going to put duplicate accounts up since I've been

[02:18] back after my summer hiatus.

[02:21] I am on the site in so many different ways and you have no idea who I am.

[02:27] You might catch two or three a week but there's ten more still actively going.

[02:32] Why?

[02:33] Why am I duplicate accounting?

[02:35] Because I will swoop in and drop information when I find it is important.

[02:40] But in this case, in this scenario, the truth is all of this happened serendipitously.

[02:46] I did not plan any of this.

[02:48] So here's what I was doing.

[02:50] I was simply reading the J-pop thread and I saw a minute earlier someone posted the press

[02:55] release from American pinball.

[02:56] So I quickly grabbed it and I posted it as Rick Thorn as a new thread and all of the

[03:01] sudden people went bonkers.

[03:03] They thought that I created it.

[03:04] They thought that it came from me.

[03:06] They thought that it was all a big scam by canada, big hoax that I've been working on

[03:10] for months, for years.

[03:13] Let me break it to you guys real simple.

[03:15] Yes, I have enough time to read Pinside and do a podcast about pinball.

[03:19] I do not have enough time to create an elaborate hoax that includes pretending to start a pinball

[03:24] company, renting a space in Chicago and putting that pinball company's name on the door

[03:30] of creating images of magic girl being produced in large quantities of putting out a press

[03:36] release about Harry Houdini of writing a press release about Harry Houdini making up all

[03:40] these little details about the machine.

[03:42] It is not a hoax by canada.

[03:45] For those of you on Pinside like Flinibus and the guys on there that continue to think

[03:50] that I'm just trying to fuck with all of you.

[03:53] Am I wrong?

[03:54] Is any of the information that I've distributed been incorrect?

[03:57] Has it been false?

[03:58] Has it been misleading?

[03:59] No.

[04:00] I don't think anything I've ever shared with the community has been false or misleading

[04:04] ever.

[04:05] Okay.

[04:06] Yes, I might be a false or misleading character.

[04:08] If I'm duplicate accounting, I get that.

[04:12] But have fun guys with your continued witch hunt on Pinside, accusing every new member

[04:17] of being canada.

[04:18] Let me guarantee you half of them really are.

[04:21] Okay.

[04:22] So, let's move on from there.

[04:25] We've addressed that.

[04:27] What is the next thing that happened?

[04:29] So out of the blue, after people bombarded American pinballs, Facebook page with all of

[04:35] the vitriol around J-pop and after all of the threads contained so many people bitching

[04:40] about what they're doing, what did they do?

[04:43] They came out of nowhere and showed a picture that looked like about 12 to 15 magic girls

[04:52] in a row being worked on or nothing worked on but just the cabinets there.

[04:56] But this and everyone was immediately like this photo's Photoshop.

[05:01] This isn't real.

[05:02] It's part of a canada hoax.

[05:03] Bullshit.

[05:04] I have nothing to do with that.

[05:05] That photo is real.

[05:07] That is not a Photoshop job.

[05:10] These guys are making a move that none of us saw.

[05:14] The fact that they might make magic girl owners right and they might fix that wrong is incredible.

[05:22] We all were saying this company is going to die.

[05:24] They're going to be dead on arrival because of how tainted they are.

[05:28] How toxic American pinball is.

[05:31] How can you work with J-pop?

[05:34] You have to know if you release a game by J-pop and people lost a million dollars, they're

[05:40] going to burn that company to the ground.

[05:42] What did they do?

[05:43] They waved the only white flag they could which is we're going to build the magic girls.

[05:51] If they're going to build magic girl, can they build Raza?

[05:54] That's the other question I have.

[05:56] Let's look at it step by step.

[05:58] If they make good on this promise, how much do we forgive them?

[06:02] There are still all those Raza owners who need to be made right.

[06:05] How are they going to handle that?

[06:07] That is still unknown.

[06:08] They're promising magic girls by the end of the year.

[06:12] That's insane.

[06:13] As we all have seen, the amount of time between saying you're going to do something and you're

[06:20] intent to build pinball and the actual pinball shipping, there's usually years in between

[06:26] those two moments.

[06:28] For these guys to say by the end of the year, you're going to have your magic girls.

[06:32] That's incredible.

[06:35] That if true would blow people away.

[06:39] Doesn't fix the Raza owners, doesn't fix the Alessand Wonderland owners.

[06:44] There's a lot more that people have to do or these guys have to do to settle all those

[06:48] wrongs.

[06:49] But all of a sudden now, we're looking at Houdini differently.

[06:53] All of a sudden, maybe Houdini is not this game that we're going to root against, but

[06:59] maybe if they come through on magic girl, Houdini is a game that we should look at, open

[07:07] mindedly.

[07:08] This company needs people to do that or they're done.

[07:12] I don't know about you guys, but I still am skeptical.

[07:16] How can we not be skeptical all we've ever seen, our empty cabinets of magic girl?

[07:20] What is the actual play field look like?

[07:23] Are the squiggly ramps still going to be there because we know the guy who paid all

[07:27] that money to make the squiggly ramp molds hasn't even been contacted.

[07:31] I have to assume that these guys who are doing this have enough money where they're not

[07:35] going to go and try and put other people or tip off what they're doing to people who

[07:40] worked on the initial magic girl revival.

[07:44] By that, everyone at Pintasia seems to be still in the blue.

[07:48] There's Bill Brandis.

[07:49] He came on Pinside a few days ago and said that he owns the rights to magic girl.

[07:55] There's no way it's being made.

[07:56] Then this happens like a week later.

[07:58] Who's to believe?

[08:00] Bill's always had a lot of credibility, but now American pinball is actually showing pinball

[08:04] machines lined up.

[08:06] It's so hard to know who's telling the truth and who's lying.

[08:12] See it in a day.

[08:13] Look, Canada, Rick Thorn, Lady Slingshot, I've always just told the truth.

[08:18] Might be hard for you guys to acknowledge it, but I'm just being truthful about what

[08:22] I know.

[08:23] I'm not misleading when you come to me.

[08:24] How many people on Pinside, flinny bus and all these guys you complain and have conspiracies?

[08:28] All they've got to do is email me at canadapimballatgmail.com and I will tell you exactly what is the

[08:37] truth coming from me.

[08:38] Then you can go, instead you want to spread all your lies.

[08:42] These guys have magic girl.

[08:46] Here's the thing.

[08:47] If we look at Houdini and Timing, they have to ship out the magic girls before people

[08:51] will give any money towards Houdini.

[08:54] I think so.

[08:56] I don't think magic girl can come after Houdini if this is going to be the case.

[09:01] People want to feel good about buying Houdini and don't want to feel like they're supporting

[09:05] this evil, toxic organization that is working with a man who ripped off so many people.

[09:11] It's really, really interesting to see what happens.

[09:14] When it comes to magic girl, I think they can only produce the 19 or 23 orders that John

[09:22] took.

[09:23] These people paid $16,000.

[09:24] They get a hyper-limit machine.

[09:27] If they up the number that they produce, then it's no longer that limited.

[09:34] Those machines should not sell for $16.

[09:37] That's going to be interesting to see what they do there.

[09:40] What are they going to do with each of those machines?

[09:42] How many are they going to make?

[09:43] What are they going to be priced at?

[09:45] Will they make additional magic girls now that they've put all this money into getting

[09:49] the game to fruition?

[09:51] If they've got all the parts and they figured out how to make it, shouldn't they be able

[09:55] to make more money off if it's a company?

[09:58] They might just want to bury that game in the past.

[10:01] I think they're going to do that.

[10:03] I think magic girl is just like a blip.

[10:05] This is a make good thing we need to do.

[10:07] Then we're moving on to the future because I think magic girl is still tainted and still

[10:13] an infamous pin and still has caused so much heartache and pain for people that they're

[10:18] not going to want to make that the focal point of their company.

[10:21] I think Houdini is.

[10:22] I also think having not seen the magic girl play field.

[10:29] I also think there's a question of, is zombie yeti's artwork still going to be the art

[10:35] predominantly in the game?

[10:37] Simply because do they have to move stuff around to make the game work?

[10:41] Because even when we saw magic girl at that show, it was designed so poorly.

[10:47] There was literally like a spinning thing in the jig in front of the ramp.

[10:52] You couldn't even hit the ramp.

[10:53] I don't think John never shot it as a white wood.

[10:56] The game didn't even plunge well.

[10:58] I think they have to do a lot of redesigning of it and all those magnets and the big

[11:03] toy in the middle.

[11:04] Did they get all of this to work?

[11:07] What magic girl are people going to get?

[11:09] Are they going to get the magic girl that they saw?

[11:12] Are they going to get some like wood or down version?

[11:14] We're already hearing people complain about the look of the cabinet.

[11:18] It's just a normal Valley Williams cabinet size now.

[11:21] It doesn't look like the coin doors are chrome or powder coat it really even.

[11:27] What's the game going to be?

[11:29] What's the game going to be?

[11:31] It's hard.

[11:32] It's hard to tell.

[11:34] I also think that Houdini is going to be the kind of magical, maybe more magical than magic

[11:40] girl.

[11:41] I'll explain why.

[11:42] It seems like if you look at the Houdini press release, all those different sort of modes

[11:49] and things that the ball is going to do to recreate the magic of Harry Houdini, to

[11:54] me seems like the game is packed with magnets, with mechanisms, with trap doors or coffee

[12:02] kisses, like floating, suspending ball.

[12:06] It just seems like this game is going to be the game that they've been working the hardest

[12:10] on.

[12:11] I think magic girl, they might have just designed it to get it to the finish line, but who

[12:15] knows how that game is going to shoot.

[12:18] Who knows who's coding it?

[12:19] I don't even talk about who's coding this thing.

[12:24] How is this all being done in secrecy?

[12:26] There's not that many pinball coders out there.

[12:28] I'm just so like the rest of you scratching my head about American pinball.

[12:34] Who's on the team?

[12:35] What are they doing?

[12:36] Is it really going to be this amazing game that's going to make it worth the wait for magic

[12:43] girl?

[12:44] Are they going to tackle Razza?

[12:45] What's Harry Houdini going to be?

[12:47] These are all questions we have.

[12:49] So I think we're going to get a lot of answers on Monday when they reveal Houdini in Vegas.

[12:56] It's going to happen.

[12:57] It's on the schedule to be revealed at 9 a.m. in Vegas time.

[13:02] So holy shit.

[13:05] Is it 9 a.m. or noon?

[13:06] It's one of those two times.

[13:07] I think it was 9 a.m.

[13:10] I can't wait.

[13:12] This is going to sort of, I think expo 2016 is going to be defined by American pinball

[13:18] now.

[13:19] For those of you guys with your stakes and your pitchforks saying they shouldn't be allowed

[13:23] at expo, are you kidding me?

[13:25] Don't you want to at least see what these guys are up to?

[13:27] Talk to them?

[13:28] I get it.

[13:29] I get how much we hate Jay Bob and what he did.

[13:31] This doesn't erase any of that.

[13:33] But man, if I have to be honest with myself, the company and the pins that now I am most

[13:38] excited to see at expo are American pinballs Houdini and the actual magic girl that rumored

[13:47] might be coming to expo.

[13:49] So this is insane.

[13:51] And look at what this is done.

[13:53] This is shifted all of the attention away from Batman 66.

[13:58] All of it.

[13:59] This is what everyone is talking about.

[14:01] Getting the hype going into expo is everything.

[14:06] Stern is spending a lot of money to make expo like their biggest expo ever and to blow it

[14:12] out with this big party and it's birthday party to itself.

[14:15] And look what's happened, all of a sudden, a rogue company from the middle of nowhere

[14:22] partners up with one of the most despised designers of all time and drops a fucking

[14:27] bombshell two weeks before expo and everybody now is talking about them.

[14:36] They have the attention, they have the awareness.

[14:38] Not only that, they come in with a game that is priced so competitively when you look

[14:45] at where everyone else is at.

[14:47] If you can't American pinball is trying to break through, they are doing something extremely

[14:52] disruptive.

[14:53] So what does this mean?

[14:54] I think Stern is probably feeling like shit.

[14:58] Shit.

[14:59] How do we get hype back for Batman 66?

[15:02] And I think Stern is moving in the wrong direction with making people give deposits

[15:06] down on Batman before even seeing it.

[15:10] I'm hearing stuff from some long time Stern customers that their distributors as Stern

[15:16] is demanding payments before they even see the pinball machine.

[15:20] What?

[15:21] What are you doing, Stern?

[15:23] Like that is so annoying.

[15:25] It's annoying to the people that love your company, have like given you their hard-earned

[15:31] money time and time again, have even been burned half the time by going in on Ellie's

[15:37] that failed to be as good as you said they were going to be.

[15:40] And here we are, you're asking for the most money you've ever asked from customers and

[15:45] you're not even showing them anything.

[15:47] I think that's a slap in the face.

[15:49] I think that's an absolute slap in the face.

[15:51] And I think if you look at what everybody else is doing, Jersey Jack's not taking pre-orders

[15:57] and pat-lawlers game, spooky would never take a pre-order before showing you something.

[16:03] Stern has taken some pre-order on- sorry, highway on alien.

[16:07] They've at least shown you the play field and the cabinet and some stuff from the game.

[16:11] But they're not asking for non-refundable deposits.

[16:14] That's the other thing.

[16:15] These Batman deposits are non-refundable.

[16:18] You're locked in and you ain't seen shit.

[16:20] I don't think anyone has really done that.

[16:23] Like having shown nothing but a flyer and intention to build something but no pin.

[16:28] So I think Stern is really overshooting here.

[16:33] And I think Stern is acting like the big blue bully if it's a steel line from Todeon.

[16:39] They are trying to bully everyone around.

[16:41] And that's not the vibe you want to put out when you're celebrating your birthday, Stern.

[16:46] This is supposed to be a celebration.

[16:48] This is supposed to be your moment to show what you can do as a pinball manufacturer.

[16:53] And I don't know.

[16:54] Maybe this is karma-biting Stern in the ass a little bit.

[16:57] Because they had no...

[16:59] They had no idea that they'd be going up against Lawler, now going up against J-Pop with

[17:05] made possibly two games.

[17:07] These machines are going to sit next to whatever Stern pulls off with Batman 66.

[17:12] And people are going to compare and contrast.

[17:14] And man, if Houdini shows up at Expo and looks amazing and is 6,995 MSRP, which the Street

[17:22] Place might even be cheaper.

[17:24] And Stern's charging so much more for Batman.

[17:27] And Batman doesn't look as good or doesn't have as much magic going on.

[17:32] I think Stern's fucking in trouble.

[17:36] And simply because they're not putting their customers first, they're acting really

[17:42] egotistical right now.

[17:44] And I think if I were Stern, stop the fucking nonsense.

[17:48] Show us what Batman 66 looks like.

[17:51] Great, show us.

[17:52] If you want people's money to be locked in, show us the game.

[17:55] Show it on Monday.

[17:57] Try and reign on the Harry Houdini parade.

[18:00] Because once...

[18:01] If I were American Pimball and if I were them, I would have amazing shots, press shots,

[18:07] videos of what Harry Houdini Pimball can do.

[18:10] And just fire that out there.

[18:13] Let people get excited by it.

[18:14] And put out an official statement about your plans for Magic Girl at the same time.

[18:18] And also address what you're going to do for Raza.

[18:21] And if they do that, people will have freaking horns welcoming you into Expo like you're

[18:27] in some sort of new found royalty.

[18:29] And again, it all depends on these guys shipping games and getting them out there.

[18:34] Now there's a lot of people still, even with all this information, guys like Iceman.

[18:38] I mean, did Iceman even lose that much money on J-Pop?

[18:42] I don't even think he did.

[18:44] But I get it.

[18:45] He was burned.

[18:46] He was personally in vouch for John and then he got fucked over like a lot of people.

[18:50] But there's a lot of people that are still like, I don't fucking believe it.

[18:53] I don't care if I see 15 cabinets.

[18:55] I don't care.

[18:56] I've seen this before.

[18:57] This isn't real.

[18:58] And here's why I think those people need to just like wait a little bit.

[19:02] Before it was all John.

[19:03] It was all John putting up smoking mirrors with nobody helping him out.

[19:07] Clearly he's got a team now and he's got a real company and he's got investors and he's

[19:11] got money who are helping him out.

[19:14] So this isn't the same Zidware.

[19:16] John's just fucking around with a couple of screws every day.

[19:19] This is a full company with a lot more people and muscle making sure that stuff gets done.

[19:25] And I have to just make that assumption.

[19:27] And because here's why.

[19:29] Why would this company come out now and stir the pot?

[19:33] They wouldn't stir the pot and put out a press release and come in out of nowhere right

[19:37] before Expo.

[19:38] If they didn't feel like they had a pin that was pretty much done to show it Expo to blow

[19:41] people away.

[19:43] There's no way they would come out and be like, oh, we have to come out early because

[19:46] they know nobody's going to give them a pre-order.

[19:48] Nobody.

[19:49] They're not going to get pre-order money.

[19:51] The last company on planet earth that would ever get pre-order money would be these guys.

[19:55] The next to them would be Skit B trying to make a comeback.

[19:58] Nobody would give these guys money.

[20:00] So it's not like they're going to reveal Houdini and ask for deposits.

[20:03] No way.

[20:04] It's going to be like, we've got Houdini's inboxes.

[20:06] You pay us.

[20:07] People need to get those Houdini's and open them up and be like, this company is for

[20:11] real.

[20:12] I have one.

[20:13] I'm playing it.

[20:14] It's in my home.

[20:15] Let's talk about what this means for other pinball companies.

[20:18] Let's do it this way.

[20:19] I want to give option A.

[20:21] If American pinball turns out to be an over ambitious company that bit off more than they

[20:28] can chew and is rushing to reveal these games because they need to get some pre-order

[20:32] money, they're going to fail.

[20:35] If American pinball is just going to flop when they try to actually get the production

[20:41] and they're able to get games to reveal but they don't have the necessary money or the

[20:46] know how to actually mass produce games.

[20:49] Yes, they're going to fail.

[20:50] That won't affect anybody else.

[20:52] They'll be seen as like, what a joke.

[20:55] This is like the final joke of this whole like Magic Girl is they'd wear fiasco.

[20:59] Okay.

[21:00] That's like option A and B is kind of.

[21:03] But the other option is this.

[21:05] What if they're real and what if they do have a game that's almost done and what if

[21:09] they do make good on Magic Girl and the other Raza buyers and Alice in Wonderland buyers.

[21:15] What if they are real company?

[21:17] What will happen?

[21:18] Okay.

[21:19] I think they'll be forgiven for their past sins and people will immediately want to own

[21:24] one of these pins if they're great.

[21:25] I'm going to assume they're actually going to be really good because the designer we know

[21:28] is capable of greatness.

[21:31] All right.

[21:32] What does this mean to the rest of the boutique companies that are out there?

[21:35] I think that this is a fucking disaster and a nightmare for the other boutiques that

[21:41] are out there and I'll explain why.

[21:43] If I'm spooky and I'm like, my games are $6,250.

[21:48] If I'm spooky and this new company is delivering Houdini for just a little bit more than my machine.

[21:56] And if Houdini is jam packed and is of high quality and has all these mechs and all these

[22:01] toys and if spooky games look pretty homebrew and barren in comparison, I'd be really worried

[22:07] if I were Charlie right now because he's built in Empire on very limited boutique run games

[22:14] that are a certain price point.

[22:16] If these guys come in at that price point with a game that is just like, how can I buy

[22:20] spooky when this is so much more?

[22:22] I think Charlie might be in trouble.

[22:26] But I still think this.

[22:27] I still think spooky will be fine because I think the goodwill that spooky generated and

[22:31] I think that the company that they are is always going to have people lined up to buy

[22:34] their next title and if their next title is Jetsons, we'll talk at a later episode about

[22:39] whether I think that's good or bad.

[22:42] I think they're still going to find enough fanboys to go in on it.

[22:45] I think they'll be okay.

[22:48] If I'm Jersey Jack, what do I think?

[22:49] I think Jack is probably also looking at this like fuck.

[22:53] This was really like Pat Lawler was going to be the unexpected thing that we dropped

[22:58] at Expo and it was going to be the talk of the town.

[23:01] Out of nowhere, these motherfuckers came in and they stole a lot of like the hype and anticipation.

[23:07] Maybe not so much of it.

[23:08] I think people are still super excited to see Pat Lawler's next game.

[23:13] I wish Pat Lawler was a little bit of a nicer individual personally.

[23:16] Everyone I know who's like gone up to and met him.

[23:18] A lot of people say he's like pretty nasty dude.

[23:21] Hard to route for someone who's not personally friendly, even if they're a great pinball

[23:25] designer.

[23:26] I wish we could have designers who are also extremely friendly and there are a bunch

[23:29] that are out there.

[23:30] Some of them are real jerks.

[23:34] Anyway, so Lawler's game is coming out and I think the big test for this is an original

[23:39] theme going to be able to work really well and to sell in a climate where people gravitate

[23:45] towards themes.

[23:48] That's going to be the thing.

[23:49] I think it's going to struggle a little bit because of the fact that it's an original

[23:53] IP.

[23:54] Magic Girl is also an original IP but there's just something about that title that is so

[23:58] much hype and it's only going to be this very, very limited game.

[24:04] It's not meant to be a mass produced game but Pat's game has to sell in mass quantities

[24:08] for J.J.P. to really keep going.

[24:11] I would have to assume.

[24:14] That's why I think it's going to struggle especially when you're going against Ghostbusters,

[24:18] Aliens, Star Wars is coming out.

[24:20] Batman, Jetsons maybe, all this stuff is like it's all themes.

[24:25] Themes move games.

[24:28] If I'm Andrew Highway, I've said this before, I think Andrew is also really worried because

[24:32] Andrew is banking on revealing Alien and getting pre-orders, more pre-orders in and getting

[24:38] these games made and he's money to come in and to fly and to get them made.

[24:43] Again, if Houdini is great or Lawler's game is great, Andrew is now competing directly

[24:49] with a lot more titles to get people's money.

[24:53] You can't tell me he didn't wish he came out this penny a year ago or eight months ago

[24:57] when there was much less if hardly any competition for Aliens.

[25:03] I think the timing couldn't be worse for Andrew Highway and he has to be nervous.

[25:07] Who else is out there, Dutch?

[25:08] I think the same thing with Dutch.

[25:10] 10 grand for the big La Balsie, a very niche title.

[25:16] I can't believe orders are going to be flying in especially the way Dutch pinball is struggling

[25:22] to get games out.

[25:23] They're coming out too slow.

[25:25] Dutch is not going to have game number two at Expo and all of a sudden the big La Balsie,

[25:30] the more these new titles come out, do you guys notice how yesterday's hyped games just

[25:35] keep getting pushed further, further down on Pinsline?

[25:38] Nobody talks about them.

[25:40] At Ghostbusters, it just feels like who cares about Ghostbusters now?

[25:45] It just feels like so yesterday's news that I don't even care if Ghostbusters, even

[25:49] if Ghostbusters gets a code update and all of a sudden it becomes a different kind of

[25:54] pin.

[25:55] People will talk about it for a little bit, but the window to keep the conversation and

[25:58] the hype going around a pinball machine, it seems like it's already passed by Ghostbusters.

[26:04] It's a shame because people haven't even gotten their premiums yet and I already think it's

[26:08] kind of like yesterday's pin right now.

[26:12] Maybe a code update could catapult it back into the main conversation but not before Expo

[26:19] and surely not after Expo after all we see.

[26:23] So I don't know, Ghostbusters could be one of these great pins, it's just sort of falls

[26:26] victim to delays and poor timing and once the hype went down it's going to be really

[26:32] hard to get it back up.

[26:33] So who else is out there?

[26:36] P3?

[26:37] I mean, again, if you go down the order of like boutiques trying to make it, if I'm Jerry,

[26:41] I've got to be shitting myself too.

[26:43] Like, fuck, like how am I going to get people to buy and invest in this new sort of technology

[26:48] and this new approach to pinball when they're clearly showing that a theme means everything

[26:54] right with stern themes selling out before even being announced, theme means everything

[26:59] and I've got Lexi light speed as my theme.

[27:02] I got Lexi light speed.

[27:03] How am I going to compete with that as my theme?

[27:05] I've got all these new pinball machines coming in everywhere from 10 grand to 8 grand

[27:09] to 7 grand to 15 grand and that is consuming people's money.

[27:14] So the more people buy those things the less money there is to go to P3 and multi-morphic.

[27:19] So he's got to be like, shit, like my customer base is diminishing, not increasing as money

[27:24] goes elsewhere.

[27:25] So I think it's a really, really hard time.

[27:28] If I were Jerry, all the money he's spending going around his shows, all the money he's

[27:31] spending showing the technology, Jerry, go get a licensed theme, go get one.

[27:36] I think it's like, it might be your only hope here and I'm being serious.

[27:40] Like, I want to see this thing come out.

[27:42] But if not, if you have, if this is what you got, then you've got to release it.

[27:46] You've got to put it out there and see how it does.

[27:48] Alright, what else, who else is out there from the boutique standpoint?

[27:52] Attack from Mars Remake.

[27:53] They're going to show this planetary pinball.

[27:55] Who cares?

[27:56] I don't, look, I know Attack from Mars is a great game, but who cares?

[28:00] There are so many Attack from Mars is out there that I can go buy for $8,000 in great

[28:05] condition, $7,000 in great condition.

[28:08] They remake it.

[28:09] They remake the dots.

[28:10] I really, I'm not saying it's a bad pin.

[28:13] I just don't think people care.

[28:14] I think there's going to be very little hyper interest in an Attack from Mars remake with

[28:19] so many other exciting things.

[28:21] And the reason, again, I say it because people want to buy the new video game.

[28:24] They want to buy the new arcade game.

[28:25] They want to buy the new car.

[28:27] They want to talk about the new car.

[28:29] People want to talk about it.

[28:30] They want to have the thrill of opening it up and they want the thrill of collectively

[28:34] as a community exploring this game for the first time.

[28:38] That's why new games will always be more exciting and entertaining and interesting to the

[28:43] collecting hobby and to the community.

[28:47] We've been talking about Attack from Mars and these games for like what, 20 years of playing

[28:50] them.

[28:51] Nothing new is going to come with a remake.

[28:53] So the future of Pinball is ahead of us.

[28:57] What's happened recently is fucking crazy.

[28:59] I feel overwhelmed by it all.

[29:01] I want to close this episode of Canadian Pinball podcast by just reiterating something

[29:06] I've been feeling and I just think this whole collecting hobby is about the stall.

[29:11] It's about to collapse under its own weight.

[29:14] We've already had way too many titles that we thought were going to be at Expo vying for

[29:18] people's dollars and now we have possibly even two more who knows how many more.

[29:23] What other surprises are coming at Expo?

[29:26] And all of this is because people showed over the last four years that they're starving

[29:31] for games.

[29:32] That they're starving to give Pinball manufacturers their money.

[29:35] The problem now is they've all kind of got on their act together at the same time.

[29:40] And while they're doing that, Stern is like taking prices way up market.

[29:44] The whole thing is like there's only so many needles you can jam in to a collector and

[29:49] pump the blood out before they die.

[29:52] And I think there's too many needles.

[29:54] There's too many tubes sticking out of collectors asking for their money that it sucks.

[30:00] It's going to collapse the market in the short term.

[30:04] And I don't mean like it's going to destroy collecting.

[30:06] No, it's not.

[30:07] What it means is when it collapses, not everyone is going to survive.

[30:12] You are going to see Pinball companies fail by 2017.

[30:17] Companies that you know now that are shipping games will be gone.

[30:21] I guarantee that.

[30:22] If every single Pinball manufacturer survives into 2017, I will take six months off from

[30:30] doing this podcast.

[30:32] All right, heck, a year off.

[30:35] That's how confident I am that someone's not going to make it past this error.

[30:39] There's just no way.

[30:40] I mean, maybe good.

[30:41] Maybe some of you guys who are, some of you guys really want to get rid of Pinball podcasts

[30:46] might even be sent on a mission out of trying to sabotage someone.

[30:50] But no, it's not that I'm rooting against anyone.

[30:53] I'm not.

[30:54] I just think there's too many of them.

[30:55] There's too many options.

[30:57] And it's just a toy.

[30:58] At some point, everyone's going to wake up that this has just gotten out of hand.

[31:02] And it all kind of, all the colliding and everything coming out at the same time is going

[31:06] to sink the hobby in the short term.

[31:10] So what do I think of all of this?

[31:13] I think the next two weeks, three weeks are going to be the most exciting time on the forum.

[31:18] And I will be at Expo and I hope to say hi to you guys.

[31:21] For you guys, you hate the podcast.

[31:24] It's cool.

[31:25] I'm glad you guys listen.

[31:26] If you guys are pissed about me, duplicate accounting, I don't know what to tell you, man.

[31:29] Maybe ask Robin.

[31:30] It might make better sense to keep Knate a closer versus having him be on the outside.

[31:35] But that's episode 57 of Knate's Pinball podcast.

[31:39] Crazy week, crazy week.

[31:41] We will see if all of these companies can deliver on their promises.

[31:45] 2016 is shaping up to be the year I predicted.

[31:48] It's the craziest fucking year in the last 30 years of Pinball.

[31:52] Good night.
