[00:00] As you wish, another episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] Okay, so now we've got the Princess Bride Pinball Multimorphic streamed it last night.

[00:29] I want to give you my first impressions of the game after watching about 30-40 minutes

[00:35] of this game being played by the Multimorphic team.

[00:39] We're going to talk about Stern quality control just a little bit, people sharing photos of

[00:44] Stranger Things playfields.

[00:46] It looks like they're applying the clear coat with nail polish brushes or something over

[00:51] there.

[00:52] I don't know what's going on with these in-house playfields over at Stern.

[00:56] We're going to talk about a Big Lebowski mod.

[00:58] I haven't really been following something really cool each and every one of you can

[01:02] do to your Big Lebowski.

[01:04] And then we're going to talk about Looney Tunes and the code in the game and something

[01:09] that Spooky Pinball needs to do to make the Looney Tunes game.

[01:13] All it should be, that's all folks.

[01:16] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:18] All right, let's talk about the Princess Bride.

[01:20] Now we've been speculating what would it be like putting a movie theme onto the Multimorphic

[01:25] platform?

[01:27] Would it work?

[01:28] Would it make for a revolutionary new pinball experience?

[01:32] Is this going to be the game that gets more people to pull the trigger on this platform?

[01:37] Now I watched it for about, like I said, a half hour or more.

[01:41] And there's some stuff I really like about this game.

[01:43] I really like all the modes in the game.

[01:46] I like how you go through the book like you do in the movie.

[01:50] I like that it's very linear.

[01:52] You start a mode and you're actually watching the entire scene sort of develop right in

[01:57] front of you.

[01:59] You could see the scene on the play field itself.

[02:02] You could see it on the LCD screen.

[02:04] So there is a lot of assets from the movie coming at you.

[02:09] It's not broken up.

[02:10] It's not choppy.

[02:11] There's no mute eclipse.

[02:13] It's like every iconic scene from the movie is being teleported into this pinball experience.

[02:20] And so if you're a fan of the Princess Bride, right, you've got the music.

[02:24] It's very calming.

[02:25] It's unlike any other pinball music out there.

[02:28] And that's what I kept feeling as I was watching this stream.

[02:31] It's really hard to like evaluate a multi-morphic pinball experience because nothing else is

[02:38] quite like it.

[02:39] It is sort of like giving a review to a unicorn, right?

[02:43] There's not many of them out there.

[02:45] It's a super rare platform.

[02:47] And I haven't really seen that many multi-morphic streams.

[02:51] And unlike any other pinball stream, when they show you what's going on with the multi-morphic,

[02:56] it's just different.

[02:57] You've got the big screen as the play field.

[03:00] You got that row of targets that go up and down that can become scoops.

[03:04] You've got the upper half of the play field, which has all of the mechs in the game.

[03:10] And so what are my overall first impressions of this game?

[03:14] Well first and foremost, let's start with the good.

[03:16] I think the assets are great.

[03:18] I think all the assets you want from this game are in the pinball machine.

[03:23] You got the call-outs.

[03:24] You got the clips.

[03:25] And they look great.

[03:26] And I like the fact that you don't have to look up at the screen on the back box to see

[03:31] the clips from the movie.

[03:32] You know, because a lot of these games, you know, you never really see like what's going

[03:36] on up there.

[03:37] And I think when we watch a pinball stream, it's a little deceiving, right?

[03:40] Because when you're focused on hitting your shots, you're really not focused with what's

[03:44] going on on that screen.

[03:46] And a lot of times we complain about the assets on the screen, even though we don't see them

[03:51] very often.

[03:52] So I like the fact that you can still be looking down at the pinball gameplay and still see

[03:58] all of the stuff that you want to see that's on the screen.

[04:00] So I really like that.

[04:02] I also like the fact that it's again linear, like you're seeing the whole scene from the

[04:06] movie that you remember and that you love.

[04:09] Now I'm going to do a little devil's advocate when I go to some of the stuff I didn't like

[04:13] because sometimes it just felt like you could hold the flipper up and watch the entire scene.

[04:18] Like you're not really progressing through the scene with the shot.

[04:21] It's kind of like you're just watching the movie versus the gameplay actually progressing

[04:25] you through the movie itself.

[04:27] I also like some of the really unique stuff that P3 can do.

[04:31] So there's like the scene where you play as Inigo Mintoia and you're like sword fencing

[04:36] with your left hand.

[04:37] And then when that happens, it's one of the coolest modes I've seen in Bimball.

[04:41] You play with your left hand only.

[04:44] And as the ball is tracking whether on the left side or the right side of the game, you

[04:49] only use your left hand to flip both on the left and right side of the game because it

[04:54] tracks and knows if that ball is on the right side of the play field and no other pinball

[04:59] machine can do that.

[05:00] There's absolutely no other pinball machine out there that could track the ball like that

[05:05] and bring that unique mode to life like that.

[05:08] So I thought that was really cool.

[05:09] I like the cliffs of insanity how the ball climbs up those cliffs and you make it to the

[05:15] top and then it rolls down the hill with the as you wish.

[05:19] I like that.

[05:20] You know, so there's some interesting stuff happening in this game.

[05:24] Okay, so that's the stuff that I do like.

[05:26] What was some of the stuff that I'm sort of like, I'm not sure yet, right?

[05:30] After watching this, I'm still not sold 100% that people are going to jump in on this game.

[05:35] It did feel like the gameplay was a little underwhelming, right?

[05:40] It felt like the assets were there, but the actual gameplay itself, like the shots in

[05:46] the game, you're just going from the flippers to the north of the game.

[05:50] There's really not that many interesting shots in the game.

[05:53] There's like the left orbit.

[05:55] There is the shot up the middle, which looks really easy.

[05:58] It did look like there was a lot of flow, but it just didn't feel like there was a lot

[06:02] of dynamic gameplay going on.

[06:05] Like there was a lot of interesting combos or the balls going in a lot of interesting

[06:09] directions.

[06:10] It felt like a very basic design.

[06:13] And for those of us out there, right, we're now spoiled with some really incredible pinball

[06:18] designs from people like Keith Elwin.

[06:20] We've got Steve Richie's Elton John.

[06:22] You got Jack Danger's Foo Fighters.

[06:24] And I think a lot of these pinball machines that we've been loving recently offer some

[06:29] really interesting gameplay and design elements.

[06:33] And I'm just not sure this game delivers.

[06:35] And it's probably also really hard, right, to design a lot of dynamic gameplay with this

[06:41] platform because the designer is sort of hamstrung into only being able to work with that upper

[06:47] portion of the play field.

[06:49] And so I walked away feeling like I wasn't sure whether or not this game in a home environment,

[06:54] the gameplay would get boring pretty quickly.

[06:57] And again, I don't own it.

[06:58] I need to play it, but it just didn't feel like the gameplay was blowing me away.

[07:02] All right, so there's that.

[07:04] And then also, like I was just wondering too, it's such a mode based game.

[07:08] And when you start a mode, like I said, you're going from like the beginning of the scene

[07:12] to the end of the scene.

[07:14] And I'm not sure how many modes there are, whether it's like eight or 12.

[07:18] And I just was wondering how long will the replay value last in this game?

[07:24] If you're always sort of experiencing these modes the same way, is there going to be enough

[07:28] variety and replay value?

[07:30] Now it did really feel like all the modes were radically different.

[07:34] I like the one where the king is introducing Princess Buttercup and it's her nightmare.

[07:39] And because it's her nightmare, you got to play the game where there's no trapping the

[07:43] ball and you got to keep the balls going on the fly to get through the mode.

[07:47] I like stuff like that.

[07:48] I think Josh Coogler is actually the most valuable member over there.

[07:53] I love the way Josh Coogler codes these games.

[07:55] I think he thinks of very interesting modes and really thinks about how the hardware and

[08:01] the software can do really unique stuff to make for a unique pinball experience.

[08:06] Right?

[08:07] I don't really feel that way when I play a stern machine or a Jersey Jack machine.

[08:11] I don't feel like people are taking enough risk when it comes to making truly unique

[08:16] modes in pinball.

[08:17] And I think Coogler has got such a unique mind for coding games.

[08:21] I also like the way you can sort of save a ball after you drain.

[08:25] What is the torture chamber called again?

[08:27] And the way that works is you have to basically keep two balls alive and make it all the way

[08:32] through the end of the scene.

[08:34] And if one of them drains, you lose.

[08:36] Like I like stuff like that.

[08:38] That's a much more fun way to save a ball than like the state fair thing and Wizard of Oz.

[08:44] So there's like elements I really like in this game.

[08:47] And I definitely feel like if you rock up to a pinball show and you put a few games on

[08:52] the princess bride, it's going to put a smile on your face.

[08:56] Now all that being said, after watching the stream and watching the gameplay, I feel like

[09:01] it's a mixed bag, right?

[09:02] There's stuff to really like.

[09:03] There's stuff that's unique.

[09:04] I also feel like when you're looking at it, it doesn't really feel like pinball.

[09:09] I don't know.

[09:10] There's something about it.

[09:11] It feels more like a mobile game and a pinball machine had a baby versus a traditional pinball

[09:17] experience.

[09:18] And that's what Jerry's going for.

[09:20] But because of that, I'm just always wondering, you know, how many people are going to take

[09:25] the plunge and that's the kind of pinball experience they want.

[09:29] At some point last night, they had over 13,000 people watching the stream of the princess

[09:35] bride.

[09:36] That was a lot of people.

[09:37] It must have ended up on the front page of Twitch.

[09:39] But when I woke up this morning and I went to pin side, I didn't see many people talking

[09:44] about it.

[09:45] And I'm just truly curious if people are even interested in this platform.

[09:50] And I'm just going off of what I'm seeing, right?

[09:52] If Stern streamed a new game, there would have been like another 50 pages on pin side

[09:58] following the first ever world premiere gameplay of a stern machine.

[10:02] And so then Jerry shows this game and there's barely anything, just one extra page on pin

[10:07] side.

[10:08] And you know, so as I'm looking at this game, I just think it's too much money.

[10:12] I mean it when I say it.

[10:13] I think this entire package needs to be a loss leader for Jerry.

[10:19] He needs to get units out in the world and he's not going to get many units out in the

[10:23] world at these prices.

[10:26] Like I think the standard edition is over $11,000.

[10:29] Then it's like 12,7 for the LE and then $13,700 for the CE version of this game.

[10:38] I just don't see many people wanting to spend that much money to have an experience like

[10:44] this.

[10:45] If this thing were $6,000 or $7,000, I could see people taking the plunge and getting one

[10:50] into their home.

[10:51] But I think it's all just too expensive.

[10:54] It's just all too expensive.

[10:56] And look, I get the whole value proposition of switching out modular games here and there.

[11:01] That would work out if you had like five or six games that people really want.

[11:06] But right now, where you at?

[11:09] If you're a Princess Bride fan, you also have to be a Weird Al fan to make this thing make

[11:14] sense.

[11:15] Final Resistance came out.

[11:17] I don't hear anybody talking about that.

[11:19] I hear it's a great game.

[11:21] But again, it's a game where not a lot of people are playing.

[11:24] And I still think the majority of people who are buying these games right now already own

[11:29] an old P3 unit.

[11:31] So Jerry is most likely selling more modular kits than he's selling full games.

[11:37] So I think it's going to be hard for these guys.

[11:39] I do.

[11:40] I think at this price point, I think there's even less people that are going to be enticed

[11:45] to pull the trigger and buy one.

[11:47] It's just a different pinball world now.

[11:49] This came out five years ago and it was like 8,500 bucks.

[11:53] I think he's having a lot more success.

[11:56] But for like 12,000 to $13,000 right now, that's a lot of cheddar.

[12:01] And you're also not going to get your game right away.

[12:04] This game's not even going on the line until the summertime.

[12:08] So it's like, why would you buy it now?

[12:10] You've got four months at least before these things even make their way out the door and

[12:15] they're not going to be making many a month.

[12:18] And the way he's doing it, you can't cut the line if you buy the Collector's Edition.

[12:22] I don't know.

[12:23] I think it's going to be a very slow burn.

[12:26] And there's a reason why the Pinball Brothers had to lower the price on Alien because they

[12:30] weren't selling very well.

[12:31] They had to lower the price on Queen because they weren't selling very well.

[12:35] And then here comes Jerry with one of the most expensive pinball machines in the market.

[12:41] And there's not much demand for Multimorphic to begin with.

[12:44] And I just think from a marketing standpoint, it's really going to struggle to find sales.

[12:50] And the Elephant in the Room is simply this.

[12:53] If he made this game on a normal pinball cabinet with a normal play field, he would probably

[12:58] sell three to four more times units than he would on the platform because the price would

[13:03] be cheaper.

[13:04] It would absolutely be cheaper.

[13:05] All right, but that's never going to happen.

[13:07] So my overall impressions after seeing the game for the first time, it looks like a fun

[13:12] game to play.

[13:13] I would absolutely play it at a pinball show.

[13:16] I just don't think at these prices, he's going to find a lot of people.

[13:20] All right.

[13:21] So my first impressions of this game, what else?

[13:23] Let's talk real quickly about the quality of these Stern playfields.

[13:27] Now look, ever since Stern moved into the new factory, it's not just the playfields.

[13:32] The quality of the builds has gone downhill.

[13:35] I have a lot of friends who bought like Elvira when they made that in the new factory.

[13:40] Nothing but issues.

[13:41] I'm looking at these stranger things playfields and they're terrible.

[13:45] Like they're absolutely terrible.

[13:47] All the inserts are lifted.

[13:49] The clear coat looks terrible.

[13:51] I walked over to a venom the other day and the clear coat looks terrible.

[13:55] But then I got people in the Jaws thread saying their jaws looks like glass.

[14:00] So I'm not sure what's going on over at Stern pinball.

[14:03] There seems to be a lot more inconsistency in the build quality of these Stern games.

[14:09] And you know how I feel for this much money, we should not be getting crappy quality machines

[14:14] at this much money.

[14:16] Stern should be the best they've ever been built.

[14:18] And you know the answer.

[14:19] They're not.

[14:20] The people have lifted the hood on these modern Sterns and the soldering is all bad.

[14:25] The clear coats not there.

[14:27] Stuff is connected to places incorrectly.

[14:29] I don't know what the deal is.

[14:31] Are they rushing games out the door?

[14:33] Do they have new line workers?

[14:35] Whatever's happening in that new factory though is just not creating the best quality

[14:40] Stern machines we should be getting for this much money.

[14:43] Alright so that's happening over there.

[14:45] Let me talk real quick about Spooky Pimble.

[14:47] We've got to make a single change to Looney Tunes to make it a much better game.

[14:51] I was watching the stream of that game and right now all the modes in the game are randomized

[14:56] and they're going to have something like 22 episodes of the iconic Looney Tunes series.

[15:02] And people don't want them to be randomized.

[15:04] Luke listen to me.

[15:06] I know you listen to this podcast.

[15:08] This game will be so much better if people can select which episode they play.

[15:14] And not all episodes should be unlocked until you progress through the game.

[15:20] That will make this game 10 times more enjoyable and 10 times more fun.

[15:25] It'll also create more replay value as you try to unlock some of those episodes buried

[15:32] deeper into the game.

[15:33] And don't do it like Rick and Morty.

[15:35] Because Rick and Morty the reason why you randomized it was that was how Rick and Morty

[15:40] was in the show.

[15:41] Whenever they went on a different adventure they didn't know where they were going to

[15:44] end up.

[15:45] But if you do it with Looney Tunes what's going to happen is this.

[15:49] People are going to see all of the game in like a month and then they're going to want

[15:53] to get rid of it.

[15:54] And I don't think you should do it that way.

[15:56] Trust me as someone who's played Batman 66 the greatest coded game by Lyman Cheats.

[16:02] That game is so much fun because you can select your journey.

[16:06] You give the players the control and they will have a lot more fun.

[16:10] And that way when you know you love a few things and you just have like 20 minutes you

[16:14] can go experience the stuff you love and not just have to play some random game every time.

[16:20] So we will see if canada shouting from the rooftops can get spooky pinball to change

[16:25] direction on how Looney Tunes is developing code wise.

[16:29] Alright what else is going on in the pinball world so let's talk about real quick Jersey

[16:33] Jack.

[16:34] You know we haven't mentioned these golden lockdown bars and golden side rails from the

[16:40] Godfather Collector's Edition.

[16:42] Remember they were tarnishing and they were changing color and this happened like almost

[16:47] a year ago and they still have not sent out a fix.

[16:51] Now the latest I'm hearing is this.

[16:53] We are supposed to get a fix any day now.

[16:56] They sent out communication in December that the fix would be available in January.

[17:01] We are almost at March.

[17:03] The other concerning thing is they have not been communicating to everyone who owns the

[17:07] Collector's Edition.

[17:08] And I don't know what they are trying to do.

[17:10] I don't know if they are trying to minimize the amount of people that want the fix but

[17:14] every single one of those original games is going to need a new lockdown bar and new side

[17:21] railing for the game because both of those are having problems.

[17:25] And that doesn't seem like a cheap fix and we know Jersey Jack they make people wait

[17:29] forever for these fixes.

[17:31] When Guns N' Roses was having play field issues it was like a delay of a year by the

[17:36] time you could actually buy a replacement play field from Mirko.

[17:40] So we are going to stay on this and make sure they hold true to their word and we are going

[17:43] to follow to see if they send those things out sometime in the next month or two.

[17:48] Last on my list is a modification to a game that I actually think is pretty interesting.

[17:54] Before I talk about this mod I want to just once again do a public service announcement.

[18:00] Stop ruining your games people.

[18:02] Every week there are like 10 tacky new mods put out into the pinball world.

[18:07] Why?

[18:08] Why are we doing this?

[18:09] What is wrong with you guys?

[18:10] Do you need every single empty spot on your Jaws machine to have something glued to it?

[18:16] Stop doing it.

[18:17] It's like you are ruining all of your games.

[18:19] It's at the point now where less is more.

[18:21] I'm so tired of seeing all of these tacky mods.

[18:24] Now an interesting mod is the Big Lebowski and I don't know how I missed this thread

[18:29] for like a year but there is a gentleman.

[18:31] I think his name is Jeffrey and he has made it so you could add new music to the Big Lebowski

[18:37] game and he's been at this for like a year now with help from the community, adding new

[18:43] music, adding some callouts, making sure the new music works with the existing Dutch pinball

[18:48] code and the callouts.

[18:50] He's got like Kenny Rogers the gambler playing when you're playing the dude of Bides and

[18:55] it's like a really interesting thread.

[18:57] It's like 10 pages long and of course Dutch pinball can't like endorse this whatsoever

[19:02] because they're stealing music and putting it into a game.

[19:06] But man if you think about it, if you buy a $13,000 pinball machine and the pinball

[19:12] company could just turn a blind's eye to people being able to upload music, what a game changer.

[19:18] Like I wish we could do this to more of our games.

[19:22] Can you imagine if people could add like the Johnny Depp scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean,

[19:28] what that game would have become?

[19:29] And yeah, you're never going to get the license holder to sign off on it but once someone

[19:34] has that game in their home, why would you care?

[19:37] Like why would any of these companies really care?

[19:40] When you're in the privacy of your own home, you could do whatever you want.

[19:43] I get that maybe you wouldn't want that on a commercial level, like you wouldn't want

[19:47] to be on location or at a bar, you wouldn't want operators like displaying the game with

[19:52] like music that you don't have the rights to.

[19:55] But do you think any of them really care?

[19:57] I mean I don't think so.

[19:59] There's so few people even into pinball, I don't even think they would care.

[20:03] So if you have a big Lebowski, go find that thread.

[20:06] They're on version like eight or nine of this mod and it seems really really interesting

[20:12] and from the feedback of the people who have done this mod, they say it's a huge game

[20:17] changer.

[20:18] So there you go big Lebowski fans, now you've got something else to put in your game besides

[20:22] a toilet bowl and a joint.

[20:25] Everybody, tomorrow is Killian's birthday which is why I wanted to get the show up today.

[20:30] He is going to be three, February 26th, my little man is three years old.

[20:36] I love him so much and all of your support and all of your contributions means so much

[20:41] to Brenda, to Killian, to my family.
