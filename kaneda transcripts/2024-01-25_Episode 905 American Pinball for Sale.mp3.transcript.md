[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:16] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:17] I'm not feeling 100%, which is why you're not getting the cadence of shows this week,

[00:22] but trust me, I'm on the road to recovery and I still want to get an episode up tonight

[00:28] because here's why.

[00:29] I'm heading to Chicago tomorrow for work.

[00:31] I'm going to be there Thursday and Friday.

[00:33] I know there's so much pinball in Chicago.

[00:36] There are people who listen to this show who live there.

[00:38] There are arcades there, but I'm going to be occupied with work, so I don't think I'm

[00:43] going to be able to steal some time and go to one of those great Logan arcades in Chicago.

[00:49] What are we going to talk about on this episode of Canada Spinball Podcast?

[00:51] Well, look, I'm seeing on Naps Arcade something I've been saying for a while now that American

[00:56] Pinball is in trouble.

[00:58] Now we're hearing a rumor that Mukesh, the owner of AIMtron, which is basically the company

[01:04] that's been bankrolling this failed pinball venture called American Pinball all these

[01:08] years, they are looking for someone to potentially buy American Pinball.

[01:13] We're going to talk about that.

[01:15] Who actually would want to buy this company?

[01:17] Did we see a red flag this week in which the company is now selling the lunchbox and thermos

[01:23] to Galactic Tank Force, which was supposed to be an exclusive item that only those like

[01:29] $17,500 signature edition people were supposed to get that game.

[01:35] So we'll talk about that.

[01:36] We heard some news about Jersey Jack and how many games they have in development.

[01:41] I don't know about the rest of you, right?

[01:43] But with all of these pinball companies right now, what is in development even really mean?

[01:50] I mean every company out there, if you're manufacturing a pinball machine, I'm sure

[01:55] at any given period in time, you probably have two to three games in development.

[02:02] Remember when Robert Mueller was like, we got 18 games in development over at Deeproot?

[02:06] The only thing that really matters in pinball, in life, in any job you have, it's how you

[02:11] execute.

[02:12] And to this day, the company that still executes the best and executes the most efficiently

[02:18] and actually makes new pinball machines every few months is no other than Stern Pinball.

[02:24] Everybody else is really chasing after Stern.

[02:27] And so we're going to talk a little bit about what's next over at Stern Pinball.

[02:30] Jaws hype.

[02:32] Is it going to remain as high as it's been over the last few weeks?

[02:35] Are we going to see people start to cool down on that title before they even get it?

[02:39] I don't think so.

[02:40] I think Jaws is going to do just fine.

[02:42] I can't wait for more people to get the game.

[02:44] I can't wait for more people to get their hands on the game.

[02:48] I got an interesting email.

[02:49] A few people sent me this.

[02:50] If you look at the Translight artwork on Jaws Premium and then you go on Amazon, there's

[02:56] like a Jaws sweatshirt.

[02:57] That's exactly the same kind of image where it's a first person perspective of someone

[03:02] on a boat being attacked by Jaws, machete and all.

[03:07] Did a cheap sweatshirt on Amazon inspire the artistic direction of the Jaws Premium

[03:13] Translight?

[03:14] Now for those of you out there, I must say I still prefer the pro and the le Translight,

[03:19] the iconic Jaws movie poster image.

[03:22] Just looks much better and I think ties the game together.

[03:25] It just works really well on that Jaws pinball machine.

[03:28] I think everyone's starting to calm down a little bit.

[03:31] There's been a lot of debate around this game and nobody's really played the game.

[03:35] I think in the end, this is going to be a game that sells very well for Stern Pinball.

[03:41] Is it going to sell as well as Godzilla?

[03:43] I don't think it's going to sell as well as Godzilla did and simply because everybody,

[03:48] Godzilla was a lot cheaper.

[03:50] Godzilla was $10,500 for the le and when you charge $13,000 for a game, you're not going

[03:57] to sell as many.

[03:58] All the premiums are more expensive.

[04:00] Everything's gone up in price.

[04:01] I think we're going to see great sales for Jaws.

[04:04] I think it's going to outsell James Bond.

[04:06] I think it's going to outsell Foo Fighters.

[04:08] It's easily going to outsell Venom, which by the way, did you see this?

[04:12] Venom is now ranked as the number two greatest game of all time on the pin side top 100.

[04:18] It was as of like a day ago.

[04:20] I'm not sure if everybody caught wind of that and now is going to march in there and make

[04:25] sure we knock that pinball machine all the way down until like the top 30 because there's

[04:30] no way Venom is the number two greatest pinball machine of all time.

[04:35] Let's start off with American Pinball here right now.

[04:37] Who in their right mind would want to buy American Pinball?

[04:41] Think about it.

[04:42] If you make a quality game, their relationship with Ametron is very beneficial to that company.

[04:48] Remember Ametron, I believe Ametron supplies the chips that go into those games, but what

[04:53] would that partnership look like?

[04:55] If you bought American Pinball, would you also be acquiring the actual equipment and

[05:00] everything needed to make the games?

[05:02] Would you be able to just get the keys from David Fix and march in there and start your

[05:07] own pinball manufacturing?

[05:08] Would you be located on Ametron's facilities or would you just be buying the company?

[05:14] Now if you're just buying the company American Pinball and its equipment but you have to

[05:18] move it somewhere else, why would you ever want to do that?

[05:22] They've spent all these years setting up the manufacturing, setting up the line, they've

[05:26] got employees over there who know how to make a pinball machine.

[05:30] So yeah, you wouldn't want to just buy the IP and the reason why you wouldn't want to

[05:34] just buy the brand American Pinball, the brand is not worth anything.

[05:39] So I think if it is for sale, I would have to assume you would be able to get the keys

[05:43] to the building, all the equipment and all the employees, I don't know right?

[05:47] In all the years I've been covering pinball, I haven't seen anybody buy an existing pinball

[05:53] company.

[05:54] Historically we've seen pinball companies close their doors, we saw that with Valley Williams,

[05:59] with Gottlieb, we saw Sega and Data East merged into Stern Pinball, but we haven't seen anybody

[06:04] buy a pinball company other than, the only thing we witnessed was the Abbas family came

[06:10] in and took over Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:13] Now when the Abbas family acquired JJP, they basically took over the company, moved in their

[06:19] people but they still allowed Jack to be there in New Jersey, they were still making games

[06:24] in the same factory.

[06:26] So I'm thinking that's what they might be looking for and I just don't think the numbers

[06:30] add up right now because imagine if you're thinking about buying American Pinball and

[06:34] you ask to see how many games have they sold over the years, I can't imagine this company

[06:39] has been very profitable.

[06:41] I also can't imagine this company has games in its lineup and has like exclusive deals

[06:47] with IP partners that are going to be successful in pinball.

[06:52] Like it'd be one thing if this company had Sonic the Hedgehog or if they had Back to the

[06:56] Future or if they had something that people really wanted in development that was going

[07:00] to be a hit right around the corner but then it begs the question if they had a hit game

[07:05] right around the corner then why would Mukesh want to be selling this company?

[07:10] What I heard a while ago was this, they had to sell all the tank forces or it was game

[07:15] over for American Pinball.

[07:17] Now that I see this rumor today, it's starting to make me believe that all of what I've been

[07:22] hearing over the last few months has been true, that Mukesh gave David Fix a period of time

[07:27] in which he needed to sell all of those tank forces and he did not.

[07:32] That is why we are seeing stuff like the lunch boxes are for sale.

[07:35] Think about it, they probably ordered 200 lunch boxes and thermoses to make 200 signature

[07:42] editions of that game.

[07:44] Now how many of those do you think they actually made?

[07:47] Probably less than 30, I bet only 20 signature editions of that game were sold and even made.

[07:54] They were $17,500.

[07:58] Who in their right mind would order that version of the game when it doesn't really have anything

[08:03] worth it over the regular LE tank version of the game?

[08:07] So I don't think anybody is going to buy this company as I've been predicting.

[08:12] I think we're going to see a few pinball companies close their doors in 2024.

[08:17] There's just too many companies out there, the games are really expensive and it's like

[08:22] now or never, you either have a hit game right now or unless you have a billionaire

[08:27] backer it's going to be really tough to keep the lights on and even with all of the money

[08:33] that AIM Tron has been funneling into American Pinball, I just knew it was going to be a

[08:37] matter of time before Mukesh got fed up with losing money because nobody rich, nobody successful

[08:45] wants to lose money on a venture like pinball.

[08:48] And didn't you always get the sense with American Pinball to like Mukesh and Daval and the original

[08:54] people who started this company, they're not really pinball fans.

[08:58] Like you know what I'm saying?

[09:00] They don't really know this industry very well.

[09:02] They don't really know pinball very well.

[09:04] They always kept hiring people to figure it out and remember karma people, the first person

[09:10] that American Pinball hired to figure out its pinball operations was no other than John

[09:16] Papa Duke Jr. and they lost $350,000 or more building those broken magic girls.

[09:23] So I think it could be game over for American Pinball.

[09:26] Is it going to be game over for Haggis sometime in 2024?

[09:29] I'm in that thread and remember they said they were going to build all of the fathoms

[09:33] by the end of the year and they have not.

[09:36] And now the rumor is they might be asking for full payment on Centaur soon when they

[09:41] have not fulfilled all of the orders on fathom.

[09:45] I used to beat this dead horse a lot.

[09:47] I'm not going to do it.

[09:48] I still feel like this is another company that has to be operating on fumes.

[09:54] And I think again this year is going to be a brutal year for these companies.

[09:58] You got to have your line moving.

[10:01] You got to have a game that people want.

[10:03] And you got to have like your next two to three titles, especially when you're a small

[10:08] boutique company.

[10:10] You can't afford to have any misses.

[10:12] You can't afford to have any duds.

[10:14] Like if Spooky Pinball came out with Ultraman today, remember when they came out with Ultraman

[10:20] it was still during that COVID period and we were buying up everything.

[10:23] But if they came out with a game like Ultraman today, it wouldn't sell.

[10:27] Now Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre I think are going to do just fine.

[10:31] I actually think Looney Tunes is going to end up outselling Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[10:37] And we'll see though.

[10:38] You know, I'm not seeing like sellouts anymore across the board.

[10:41] So it's getting a lot more competitive.

[10:43] And every day I follow this hobby and I see like another pinball company.

[10:47] I saw this on Napsar K2.

[10:49] There might be another pinball company making more basic games coming out from Australia.

[10:54] And I just don't get it.

[10:56] I really don't get it.

[10:58] Do we need more pinball or do we just need fewer greater games that justify the prices

[11:05] of these pinball machines?

[11:07] There's a lot happening in 2024 and pinball.

[11:09] You can tell.

[11:10] You can feel it.

[11:11] You get a lot of pressure on everybody to somehow figure this out, to somehow figure

[11:16] out a way to get people to buy these new games.

[11:20] There's just so many new games coming out in 2024.

[11:24] Let's real quickly go through every manufacturer and what games we think they have coming out.

[11:28] I'll try to remember every single manufacturer.

[11:30] So for a stern pinball, we've got Jaws.

[11:33] And then after Jaws, the rumored games are stuff like maybe there's another version of

[11:37] Metallica.

[11:39] Maybe it is Dungeons and Dragons.

[11:41] Maybe it will be Pokemon and John Wick.

[11:44] And I think the other title we've heard is maybe it's Journey.

[11:48] We also know that stern pinball might be remaking DMD games.

[11:51] So we might get a remake of a game like Kiss or something else with a DMD screen.

[11:57] You would think it would be Ghostbusters, but I just don't get the sense they're going

[12:00] to rerun Ghostbusters or a game like Tron anytime soon.

[12:03] So Stern's going to have another three to four games that come out this year.

[12:08] We're going to get two more cornerstones.

[12:10] And then I do think we're going to see like two more like remakes come out or vault additions

[12:15] come out or anniversary additions come out sometime in 2024.

[12:19] All right, that's just stern pinball.

[12:21] So for Jersey Jack, we are absolutely going to see another game.

[12:24] Elton John production can't be flying off the shelves.

[12:28] And so we'll probably see Jersey Jack's next game sometime in late summer.

[12:32] I expect it to be something like The Matrix or Harry Potter.

[12:36] I think those are the two front runners.

[12:38] And we shall see that.

[12:39] We also learned that Jersey Jack is working on Steve Richie's next game.

[12:43] I mean, that's not a surprise.

[12:44] I mean, he's been done with Elton John probably for a while.

[12:48] Eric Minier must be well into his next game after Godfather.

[12:52] And then we know we're going to get Mark Siden's first title from Jersey Jack.

[12:56] I think that's going to be an exciting period in Jersey Jack history.

[13:00] A new designer from JJP, a new designer to the world of commercial pinball.

[13:04] Remember, Mark only made that Metroid game that was a homebrew game.

[13:08] We've never seen what he can do and we've never been able to buy one of his games.

[13:12] And you know me, I like fresh blood in pinball because I think fresh blood tries to make

[13:17] a name for themselves.

[13:19] All of these like older, cremagini designers.

[13:21] Give me new blood.

[13:23] Give me new people that want to make a name for themselves.

[13:25] So we got that from Jersey Jack.

[13:27] We know Pulp Fiction should be coming out.

[13:29] We also got news on Pulp Fiction, which is not good news for everybody out there.

[13:33] Well, it's good news if you want to save your money for a while.

[13:36] So I'm hearing they're going to build 500 standard editions first and then they're going

[13:41] to get to the Ellie's sometime in the summertime.

[13:45] This whole thing is a joke.

[13:47] CGC did it to us again.

[13:49] And so now we know they're going to need all of 2024 to make the Pulp Fictions.

[13:54] How can we even get excited about what's next from Chicago Gaming Company?

[13:58] I really do not understand why this company revealed so early.

[14:03] They do it every time.

[14:05] It's like they know there's going to be a year and a half delay between reveal and manufacturing.

[14:10] And I guess we just have to accept that.

[14:12] Spooky Pinball.

[14:13] We know what their two titles are this year.

[14:15] I think this is going to be the year of Looney Tunes and will Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw

[14:20] Massacre be the entire year over at Spooky.

[14:23] I think it's going to be most of the year.

[14:25] And then I could see them revealing Ben Hex's Evil Dead game.

[14:30] I think it's Evil Dead.

[14:31] And I think we might see that sometime in the winter.

[14:34] We do know Spooky loves to reveal a game sometime in December.

[14:39] So they're sort of on that like one game every year.

[14:42] And I do think they're going to get to a point now with Spooky where we're going to see two

[14:45] new titles a year.

[14:47] And it's not going to be two new titles using the same design.

[14:51] I think we're going to get two separate designed games from Spooky.

[14:55] So I think we're going to see Ben Hex's Evil Dead sometime this year.

[14:58] We know we're going to get the Princess Bride from Multimorphic.

[15:02] That should be coming out soon.

[15:03] I expect Jerry to show that game for Texas Pinball Festival in March.

[15:08] So another P3 Multimorphic platform game.

[15:12] Is it enough to entice you to go in on the platform?

[15:15] I saw someone trying to sell like Heist Weird Al and all the other modular games the person

[15:21] bought.

[15:22] You know, that person is easily well over $20,000 invested in that platform and they

[15:27] can't even get $13,000 for the package deal.

[15:30] So really something to think about.

[15:33] You know, if you buy a Multimorphic, you got to kind of want to keep it forever or you're

[15:37] just going to get hosed on the second hand value.

[15:40] Who else we miss in American Pinball?

[15:42] It looks like they're about to either sell the company.

[15:45] I don't think we're going to see another game from American Pinball, even though David

[15:48] Fix just went on a show and said, hey, we're making games all the way up to 2026.

[15:54] Then why are there rumors that they're looking for somebody to buy the company?

[15:58] If we do see new games from them, the rumors are we're going to see a Barry O game, which

[16:04] I hear is a single level food truck game.

[16:07] Then we're going to get Whitewater 2 from Dennis Nordman and then we're going to get

[16:12] Cuphead from Ryan McQuade.

[16:14] We know that the third game is a licensed theme and it is based on a video game property.

[16:20] So again, none of that really excites anybody.

[16:23] The only really exciting thing in that mix seems to be Whitewater 2, but again, when?

[16:28] None of that feels like it's anytime soon.

[16:30] Who else we missing in Pinball, right?

[16:32] That's a lot of companies right there.

[16:34] We've got the Pinball brothers.

[16:36] We almost forgot about them.

[16:37] They're still making Alien.

[16:39] They're making Queen and they are going to release with Padready Gaming, two remakes

[16:44] of Valley Williams classic games.

[16:47] We're hearing stuff like Twilight Zone.

[16:49] Is it fish tails?

[16:51] Is it Dracula?

[16:52] We shall see.

[16:53] I think we're going to see the first one sometime in March.

[16:56] So in just a couple months, isn't it crazy?

[16:58] March is like six weeks away, but we're going to get two more Valley Williams remakes.

[17:03] Now the big controversy with these is going to be Padready Gaming does not make a game

[17:09] as good as Chicago Gaming Company.

[17:12] And so I think we're going to have a real debate on whether or not the quality will

[17:16] be to the standards of these iconic classic games.

[17:20] And if they make a version of those games that's not built as well as Valley Williams

[17:24] or as CGC, I don't know who's going to want those.

[17:28] You know, if that's the case, could just make the originals go up in value.

[17:32] All right, who am I missing on this list?

[17:33] Barrels of Fun.

[17:34] I always forget about barrels of fun.

[17:37] We know that Labyrinth is not flying out the door with these guys.

[17:40] We also know that they're most likely going to get to another title maybe by the end of

[17:46] the year.

[17:47] I don't know if they're going to make all 1100 versions of Labyrinth in one year.

[17:52] We shall see.

[17:53] Again, I just don't see games flying out the door with this company.

[17:56] So I think they're going to need possibly the whole year to fulfill the orders they

[18:01] do get.

[18:02] Then we got Dutch Pinball with the Alice in Wonderland coming out sometime this summer.

[18:07] And then we've got Back to the Future at the end of the year.

[18:10] You could ask them a million times to their face.

[18:13] Are you making Alice in Wonderland and Back to the Future and just watch Barry smile?

[18:18] All right, we got Haggis Pinball needs to make those Centaur games.

[18:22] As I said, they might be in jeopardy of closing their doors if they don't get a lot of orders

[18:26] for that game.

[18:27] We've got Home Pin and Spinal Tap.

[18:29] Nobody really cares about that game.

[18:31] I don't even know how those guys stay in business.

[18:34] Who else we got is Turner Pinball going to bring their Ninja Eclipse to market.

[18:38] Then we've got Pinball Adventures with Elements.

[18:41] Are we going to throw that punny factory off the roof of Todd Tucky's building?

[18:45] I saw that our friend Donald won his credit card battle against Pinball Adventures and

[18:50] he's been given a refund and he was not told that he had to send the game back to Pinball

[18:55] Adventures.

[18:56] Now, if that's the case, Donald, what's stopping us from shipping that game to Todd Tucky and

[19:02] let's launch that mofo off the roof of that building?

[19:05] So as you can see right now, I'm looking at like 13, 14 Pinball companies out there in

[19:10] the Pinball space.

[19:12] That is just insanity.

[19:14] When Pinball was at its most popular, we only had like four to five companies.

[19:18] Now we've got like 15 companies and I think it's going to be a brutal battleground in

[19:23] 2024.

[19:24] I really do.

[19:25] And I also am a little bit worried.

[19:27] I'm worried that Stern has to sell so many games a week.

[19:31] Imagine if they make 600 games a week.

[19:34] That means you have to find 600 new buyers every single week willing to spend this much

[19:40] money, 600 buyers that can free up that much space.

[19:44] And yeah, if you have a hit theme, it's going to work.

[19:46] But what happens when you have your next Venom?

[19:48] What happens when it's Dungeons and Dragons, right?

[19:50] Is Pokemon going to be a theme that people really want?

[19:53] Will that cross over into the Pinball buying demographic?

[19:56] We shall see everybody, but it's going to be interesting.

[19:59] It's going to be really interesting.

[20:00] I think the next month is all going to be about Jaws and hopefully some pulp fictions

[20:06] are going out the door.

[20:07] Even if it's just the standard edition, it's also funny.

[20:10] Like why is the standard edition being made first?

[20:12] Why aren't they making the LE first?

[20:14] The play field is exactly the same.

[20:17] It's the topper.

[20:18] They can't get the parts made for the topper.

[20:20] I don't know what it is.

[20:22] Everybody thank you so much.

[20:23] I wanted to just get this quick show up for everybody to have some Canadian Spinball podcast

[20:27] to listen to you in the middle of the week as I'm traveling, but we'll be back with a

[20:31] lot more shows and I'm going to get there.

[20:33] I'm only at like 60%.

[20:35] I need to get back to feeling 100%.
