[00:00] Okay.

[00:10] Welcome everybody. Happy Wednesday. We should see this thing in 10 minutes. It's probably

[00:15] been leaked already. I'm going to go into my community and I'm just sharing photos already.

[00:20] Let's see. Scrolling up 10 minutes ago.

[00:30] All right. All right. We're here. I don't think we missed it yet. I don't think we missed it.

[00:38] What's up? Is it? There we go. There we go. There we go. I know. I know. You know me in this technology thing.

[00:45] It's not the easiest. I think we are ahead of it. I don't think it's happened yet. I think we've got 10 minutes.

[00:52] We're going to watch it live here and see what this 50th is all about. Let's share screen here.

[01:03] Are we going to need a bigger boat? Are we going to need a bigger game room? Is this game going to like hit like everybody thinks?

[01:10] I don't know. I don't know. I'm excited to see it. I'm excited to see it. I think that this game is what's nice about this 50th is much like Godzilla.

[01:24] Much like Jurassic Park. Everyone knows it's a really good game. I have to say this. I just played guns and roses all the way through to sympathy for the devil.

[01:35] Is there something in that mode that makes the flippers change where all of a sudden like the left button controls the right flipper.

[01:43] The action button controls the flippers and the pop up like it's is that what sympathy for the devil mode is it just makes the game go like all hey why are you trying to collect the characters.

[01:54] I will say I haven't played GNR in a while so I did the cheat. I did the coin door opening up to ball save to get to the end.

[02:07] It ruins the game. Like the game is all about getting to the song and enjoying a song and rocking out like it's not a game where going deep through it is more rewarding.

[02:22] But it's like you would need 40 minutes to see the whole game.

[02:28] Okay, I hope they didn't change the playfield. I can deal with FOMO with a different hard package. So yeah for guys that have for guys that have a Jozzellie.

[02:39] I think you're looking at this launch in an interesting way. Is it out yet?

[02:50] Yeah, now I understand why people would get tired of guns and roses because it's just like when you're in a song

[02:57] It's not like really that much fun to shoot it because it's just

[03:02] clunky and

[03:04] Brickie and outlay and Drainy and multi-ball heavy like none of it

[03:08] Rock you don't feel like you're rocking out like the game when you watch the game

[03:12] It's super exciting to watch it someone else played, but when you're playing it in your hands. It doesn't feel great

[03:18] All right, let's see we got 70 people here. Let's see like

[03:25] Where this is gonna drop we're gonna try to watch it with me

[03:29] I'm gonna go to Stern's Facebook page. I'm assuming they're gonna drop it on their Facebook page

[03:34] So I'm gonna go there now and see you know Stern Pimball

[03:40] Nothing yet

[03:44] Celebrating soon is still up

[03:48] So we're we don't have the

[03:51] We don't have the

[03:53] I think I think it's gonna be new

[03:57] Yeah, I'm working from home today. It's a holiday week. I just got a bang on ideas today

[04:02] So I just wanted to focus on creating ideas and

[04:06] And not be distracted not lose two hours to the commute like one hour each way

[04:12] So I'm taking off next week and it's a I just need a break. I haven't had a break in a long time

[04:19] So traditionally

[04:21] It's noon Eastern time so we're hoping this thing is launched in the next like

[04:27] Next seven minutes. Give me one second. I gotta go get my glass of water. Hold on

[04:36] Costa de Canada

[04:42] You

[05:12] You

[05:42] You

[05:55] Okay

[05:58] All right

[06:04] Can it is just Stern's best newer pin

[06:08] I

[06:10] Think yes as of now it is X-Men if the code gets better is a better shooter for sure

[06:18] Here's the thing I keep my garage tidy because it's not that big

[06:22] I just have one car and I like a clean garage

[06:26] Here's the thing about this game that's gonna be funny in the next

[06:29] What like five minutes? I think Ellie owners are hoping it's

[06:35] Not that nice. I do because here's why

[06:38] Think about it. Jaws has been out for a year and a half a year and a half

[06:44] So anyone who's wanted a jaws

[06:48] Probably has one right you either have the Ellie a thousand people have the Ellie

[06:53] How many

[06:54] Thousands of people may might have a premium and then all the pros that are out there because they sold a lot of pros

[07:02] so I was just thinking about this

[07:05] They could actually end up making less jaws 50th anniversary editions

[07:12] Then Ellie's even

[07:15] I you know what I'm saying like I don't know I don't know right it the whole they're not gonna be numbered

[07:21] But that doesn't mean

[07:23] There won't be less of them

[07:25] Like how many Godzilla 70 did they make do they make more than a thousand?

[07:31] I

[07:32] Don't know right it's just like it's just in the end

[07:36] None of the Ellie's matter that much in the

[07:38] Jaws Ellie package. I've always been a big fan of it. I think they did a good job with it

[07:42] I think there's a reason why a lot of people hold on to jaws Ellie

[07:47] It's a combo of things. It's a it's a really nice game

[07:51] The code is probably one of Stern's best ever to be honest to be fair. That's and so and then you have this beautiful

[07:59] Game that looks like a Jaws game

[08:02] I

[08:04] Mean it doesn't have I wish it had more of like a wow mechanit for sure, but man

[08:09] It's like if you walk up to jaws

[08:12] It pulls you in instantly though same way Godzilla does you know a game doesn't King Kong

[08:18] King Kong doesn't Avengers doesn't King Kong is the new Avengers. It's it's great to shoot

[08:24] Nobody will nobody cares about it though that much

[08:28] No, I

[08:31] Always feel like they do 11 11 o'clock

[08:36] Central time so I'm hoping the game comes out in three minutes if not

[08:42] I'll just go back to work and we'll do this in and and 45 minutes. I so it's it's it's hopefully

[08:51] We're at the right place at the right time

[08:56] Yeah

[08:58] There are fewer 70th and Ellie likely around 500 I

[09:04] Don't know

[09:07] Yeah, dude you never hear people talk about Avengers you're not gonna hear people talk about King Kong

[09:13] It's it's a it's a day late in a dollar short in assetless themed game now

[09:21] Just doesn't work

[09:24] I think we accepted it with Jurassic Park because people forget to Jurassic Park was $10,000 for now Lee like it was in an

[09:31] assetless Jurassic Park for 13

[09:34] The moment they made the 13,000 dollar anniversary of Jurassic Park all those prices came crashing down and then all of a sudden

[09:41] There's a thousand Jurassic Park Ali's

[09:44] What would you rather have a jaws or an arcade edition Harry Potter?

[09:48] Jaws I think I think Harry Potter is a nicer looking game

[09:53] I still don't think the Harry Potter code

[09:57] Would excite me the way it's coded right now

[10:02] That the my worry about Potter code gang is the exciting stuff are the multi balls and like the mini wizard modes

[10:08] I don't know if those are mini wizard modes are just multi balls the good luck getting to them

[10:12] Good luck getting to them the thing you're gonna start our

[10:15] Movies and when you start the movies in Harry Potter

[10:19] It's not exciting and it's still stacking everything on top of the movie right now as the code is

[10:26] David feels work is buried the movies buried it's like everything's going on at once I

[10:33] Would not buy Harry Potter

[10:35] Because of that right now the game shoots fine. It's not loaded. It's a fun shooter

[10:40] But it's the code is letting that game down right now

[10:44] All right, let's see what we got is it new yet?

[10:47] Is it up? It's noon

[10:52] Still got the coming soon I'm you know, I feel like people on Pinside are gonna know before I do

[11:09] So it's in an hour

[11:17] Gives me an hour more to do some real work. Um, I

[11:22] Don't know I

[11:27] They normally do

[11:32] Stern's website timed out during a refresh

[11:37] Let's see it's there. Let's see Stern's website

[11:44] Stern

[11:47] All right, let's go to it

[12:01] Where where is it?

[12:04] Where's Jaws 50 is does anyone have a link?

[12:09] It's not well can someone just put a link YouTube now. Okay, it's darn YouTube

[12:16] Red armor uh-oh

[12:28] Videos all right. Yeah, oh

[12:33] I already don't like the red armor I saw it quickly hold on

[12:39] Let's watch this together share

[12:47] All right, hold on we're gonna watch it right here. I got your guys

[12:59] Hey, everybody, it's George Gomez here at Stern Pinball and we're excited to share with you a special 50th anniversary

[13:05] I like that they did Jaws movie poster like that to mark this golden anniversary. I was hoping for that this Jaws 50th anniversary premium edition

[13:13] That highlights some really special cosmic features

[13:17] The playfield integrates glitter enhanced artwork in addition to new brass powder coated wire form ramp even new plate of artwork

[13:26] This collector's item also boasts a distinctive 50th anniversary hologram sticker to go along with a unique

[13:33] Translight and all new cabinet decals. I like it the game is also outfitted with a bold red armor kit

[13:39] including matching legs hinges front molding and side armor

[13:44] While this 50th anniversary premium edition of Jaws will only be available to purchase during this calendar year

[13:51] We also have some exciting code updates across all of our

[13:55] That's how they're limiting it our new content enhancements have integrated team play and co-op modes

[14:01] Into the game menu system kind of want one players can play with their friends share progress and more

[14:07] This new code also introduces brand new wizard modes the wheel award wizard mode

[14:12] And of course the iconic

[14:15] Smile you son of a final wizard mode. You're gonna need a bigger game room with the all new Jaws 50th anniversary premium edition

[14:24] Get connected and learn more at sternpimbal.com

[14:38] Okay, you guys guys saw it all right

[14:43] You get you guys saw it all right wasn't a black screen

[14:52] Ah

[14:55] Well look here's the thing gang here's the thing

[14:59] Here's the thing

[15:01] I like it and

[15:03] I like the

[15:05] It's got glittered play field now so they're they're stealing a page from Jersey jack now adding glitter

[15:12] So

[15:13] Now you're gonna have the nicer play field on the premium than you do on the le the wire forms are nice

[15:21] I like the way it looks like the red

[15:24] Easily if you want to make that white you could easily do that

[15:28] Um, I think it might have looked better with Jaws blue

[15:34] Instead of red it's very popsicle looking

[15:39] um

[15:41] But I I was hoping they would just go with the iconic

[15:47] Movie poster and they did so like let let let me just pull up a Jaws

[15:52] Jaws Ellie

[15:55] Pinball did I just I just hit my mic I might have lost your guys

[16:00] That's annoying when I do that. Oh did I lose you? No, we're still here. Okay

[16:12] Um

[16:20] Um

[16:25] No like it's

[16:31] I don't know I kind of

[16:34] To me this

[16:36] This looks

[16:37] Less Jaws like I got to be honest. I mean this looks

[16:43] I don't know right I don't know

[16:46] But let's let's go to the uh, I'm sure Naps arcade has everything

[16:50] I'm gonna go to Jason's site because he just has everything always right away

[16:57] Now he's not even up yet Jason come on I wouldn't wouldn't what are we doing here Jason

[17:02] Oh here we go. It just went up two minutes ago

[17:08] Oh

[17:21] Oh now I'm just gonna refresh the site because you can see both when he's got

[17:33] All right, let's see show screen

[17:38] Okay

[17:41] Okay

[17:47] The art on the early is just meh, but the color scheme is better

[17:56] Yeah, you know what I would have liked them to have done

[18:00] It is make is sort of make the cabinet look more like

[18:06] The movie poster like directed by Steven Spielberg, you know starring have the actors names

[18:14] It would have been nice to sort of make it feel more movie poster like and less

[18:18] Because it looks a little empty right and you could see it like there's just something about the way our eye tracks art

[18:25] Where you've got the angle of the armor

[18:29] Is a different angle than the angle of the water right and that's that's a jarring

[18:36] You know, and then you've got the red lollipop part crashing through the blue

[18:42] All of that to me is bad art direction like I I just

[18:48] Don't understand

[18:51] These are like they've like artist over there like

[18:56] Zambietti is the head of the art department now like how do you land on this?

[19:02] being like

[19:04] Looks right you know, I'm saying

[19:07] Like they should at angle the blue ocean to be the same angle

[19:14] Maybe as the armor or just found a way. I know there's just something it just looks a little weird

[19:25] Um

[19:29] Yeah, because again like I should have to tell these guys this but like

[19:35] When you have red like red font is like boom it like it hits you like a ton of bricks

[19:42] But what you don't want to do and this is why the white armor if you just if someone's gonna photoshop this and make the armor white

[19:49] And it's gonna look great

[19:51] Because what you want is the only red

[19:55] That's pulling your eye you want it to be the jaws logo

[20:00] When you put red all around it

[20:03] You again, it creates a very unsatisfying thing to stare at

[20:13] But hey, right, I mean I

[20:17] Think white would work much better

[20:21] Um, I'm also thinking like

[20:25] You know don't even kill me but

[20:29] I don't know what like these anniversaries like I don't know like I always feel like brat would brass plating this make it look really good and more premium

[20:39] I don't know

[20:41] I think it should have been like a light blue

[20:44] I do I think if you look at the different blues in the ocean I think if you pull the lightest one

[20:52] And made that the armor color

[20:55] This just adds too much it's too much

[20:59] It's too fire engine red. It's now. It's everywhere. I get you know, you know what they were going for a fourth of July red white and blue

[21:10] Right red white and blue for the July

[21:17] Um, I like the glitters

[21:20] That's something if they brass played it the wire forms why not just even

[21:25] Attempt to brass played it armor package on it

[21:29] I think that would have looked better too because brass again brass just will push your attention towards the art

[21:42] Yeah, I mean I think it's I think it's um

[21:48] I think it's just all right. I think they I think they nerfed the armor

[21:52] I think the and I hate that like I don't want to have to again like gang I just mean is I don't want to have to spend $10,000 in replace anything on a $10,000

[22:00] And I just would not be happy with that armor package

[22:04] This is another example of like why isn't Stern just like we know this game's coming

[22:09] Why didn't they do any market research why didn't they why didn't they share with the community

[22:14] Like three options and let the people vote

[22:17] You know, I'm saying like just let the people vote

[22:20] I don't think we would have landed on the red white and blue maybe we would have right maybe we would have

[22:26] Maybe the yellow from the barrels would have looked better and you had the barrel on the shooter

[22:31] I don't know, but I'm just saying this red is very very jarring

[22:39] I think everything else is nice and look the thing is the armor is easy to change

[22:44] You just shouldn't have to

[22:46] Come on zombie Eddie. You're the chief creative

[22:50] Like well are you are people overriding you on this like I again

[22:54] I just aesthetically

[22:57] It's just starting to get a little mind boggling some of the artistic directions. They're going in

[23:04] It's okay is not the word I want to hear Johnny pinball

[23:08] I want it it should look awesome not okay

[23:13] It feels like it's I think the red is a miss I think the red is a miss there's too much of it

[23:20] And it just doesn't look look at this neogeo here

[23:23] I

[23:24] Imagine if this neogeo just a little bit of red right?

[23:27] Imagine if you frame this cabinet in red which is what they've done because it's got blue and white

[23:32] If you put a red border around this neogeo it would look hideous

[23:37] And that's what they've done they've taken all this blue and white and they overdid the red

[23:42] You don't want too much red

[23:46] Sorry, it's just not it's not the red is a very angry color. It just doesn't

[23:51] Work unless the theme is like Deadpool or something where it blends in with all the art

[24:00] All right, well, I'll share more thoughts later, but gang

[24:05] That's you know, that's how I feel like it's cool

[24:07] Another option for people to buy I look the big news the big news gang is they actually made playfield changes

[24:15] So now the nicest play field is gonna be not in the le you can see what stern's trying

[24:21] And the other big news here

[24:24] Was we're only taking orders through the end of this year. So you know what that means is

[24:30] Fomo they're trying to inject some Fomo into the ordering process without an ability to say it's limited

[24:36] But it is limited to the to the orders they get this year

[24:41] So you know what's gonna come next now

[24:43] are the

[24:45] Last sale like this is it last chance to order it goes back in the vault

[24:49] So they're they're gonna they're gonna they're trying to create their Fomo

[24:57] Yeah, how do you land on red after glitter and brass played it

[25:06] Yeah, I actually think too like because it's a premium you might as well like

[25:12] You might as well just put the armor you want on it and people are going to but this is another example of like market research

[25:18] Like stern come on like if they had shown this

[25:23] You know a couple weeks ago before they ordered all the red armor we could have like told them that

[25:34] Yeah, I look I think Fomo's dead gang. I think in the end like this isn't $6500 anymore. This is nine 10 grand you gotta you know

[25:43] Well, I you know I change it when I look when I look the more I look at it the when I look at the Jason nap

[25:52] I just think the red is too jarring

[25:55] That's how the mind works you can see something at first and be like oh I like I like the artwork

[26:03] That's what I really liked I much prefer the movie poster being carried through so that's what I was like I like that

[26:10] And I like the brass plating I like the glitter. That's what I was looking at but when I look at this

[26:16] Image of the armor. I hate it. I gotta be honest. I hate the red armor on it. I hate it. I but it's an easy fix

[26:23] It's just I don't want to have to fix a $10,000 game

[26:29] I want my pinball manufacturer to have a better creative eye than me

[26:35] All right, you're paying people six figure salaries to have an artistic eye

[26:42] Nobody should be saying oh we would look better if it was this like come on and it would look better if it was not red

[26:54] That glitter makes no sense here. It actually. It's not true

[26:59] The ocean has a glitter on the surface from the Sun. So I I think glitter does make sense

[27:04] Especially most of jaws as scenes you know happening during the day

[27:14] Well look gang what what what what the other big news is now we're witnessing Stern's gonna start using glitter in playfields

[27:23] We're like grown men geeking out over glitter

[27:27] This this is how gaslit we are gang

[27:30] We're now we're now acting like yeah 10 grand 10 grand for an unlimited premiums a good deal because there's glitter on it

[27:38] There's glitter on it

[27:41] Harry Potter playfields loaded loaded. Okay. Well, what's in it besides a moving staircase

[27:48] It shut up canada loaded

[27:52] loaded

[27:55] Do you feel like you're playing Quidditch do you

[27:58] Let me explain when you when in the movies when they're playing Quidditch aren't they flying around hog warts on broomsticks like all the way around the world

[28:08] Didn't Steve Richie design a hyperdrive for Star Wars that simulates flying around the entire world under glass

[28:17] Why didn't they make Quidditch that why didn't they steal from that amazing design and actually put it in a game

[28:24] Where it would make more sense

[28:26] You're telling me it feels like you're playing Quidditch when you just are up in that upper left playfield and you're just

[28:31] hitting a quick wire form ramp or loop that's it that that makes you feel like you're in a Quidditch match

[28:38] Makes you feel like you're chasing after

[28:41] You know that that little whatever ball is really when you that you get that sensation

[28:47] Have you played the game people you haven't doesn't feel like you're in a Quidditch match never does can't say it canada

[28:53] Can't say it because the new content creators are all saying it's amazing. They're having so much fun

[28:59] I'm having so much fun watching everything crash on top of itself in this game

[29:04] I'm having so much fun not really feeling any anything when you start a movie

[29:09] But you know, you know, you know, he's negative. He's negative. You come over to my channel. We love everything

[29:19] Sorry guys

[29:20] Sorry, I don't know yet. It's such an opportunity to make more of a Quidditch feel

[29:26] An opportunity to bring more elements

[29:29] Is there any moment in the game where like you feel like you're casting a real spell? They think about it

[29:34] Like like where the magnet grabs the ball

[29:37] And like you know like you know like when you're when the wizards are shooting wands at each other and like the

[29:43] The power of a spell does it feel does it feel like that?

[29:47] I don't know how to say that

[29:49] Oh, no, it's on the code. It's on the code

[29:55] Yeah, I gotta go back to work too

[29:59] It's not even bias guys. It's not even bias. It's like literally

[30:04] Literally, it is like absolute

[30:06] just cheerleading

[30:09] Of stuff that is so like bear in to me like it's just funny to me

[30:14] I

[30:16] Sorry, I'm the grumpy weirdo. I gotta go back to work though. Everybody look enjoy your day

[30:22] Like I'm glad Stern is offering this stuff to people

[30:25] the I think I like the package except for the armor and

[30:29] You know when they're when they're highlighting for 10 grand

[30:33] You know because if they hired me as a cml. I'm gonna George George. Here's the

[30:37] First of all, if I was a cml, we're not going with the red. Do you guys understand part of marketing's job

[30:43] Is to make decisions that

[30:45] Help you bring the game to market in a successful way. So if I was over there

[30:50] We're not going with the red

[30:52] It doesn't look good. It's not I you want me to sell that with with that red everywhere

[30:59] All right, I want you to comp up what it would look like with blue and with white

[31:03] And you tell me which one we're gonna sell more of and look we're not going against our word with the le owners

[31:09] This is not limited
