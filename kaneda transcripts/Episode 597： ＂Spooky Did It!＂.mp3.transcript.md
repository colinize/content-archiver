[00:00] You did it.

[00:03] The son of a bitch did it.

[00:05] Yeah!

[00:05] Yeah!

[00:06] Yeah!

[00:07] All right!

[00:08] He really did do it.

[00:13] This company went from struggling only having sold 70 America's most honoured before

[00:18] they made them limited to selling 1700 and 50 games through in one day.

[00:25] This is the American Dream.

[00:26] This is why we love spooky.

[00:27] Let's talk about it.

[00:28] A small town girl, living in a lonely world.

[00:35] She took the midnight train going anywhere.

[00:45] You know, there are times in life when you hope you're wrong.

[00:48] You know, like when you say to yourself, is that a bill?

[00:52] And then you hope it's not a bill.

[00:54] Is he going to make that jump?

[00:55] And you hope he makes the jump.

[00:57] Are they going to sell 1700 and 50 games?

[01:00] I don't think so.

[01:02] And yes, they did.

[01:04] Canada was wrong.

[01:05] This company sold through.

[01:07] Now there is a difference between selling out and selling through.

[01:10] But to them, to spooky Pimball as a company, 1700 and 50 games were spoken for in one

[01:19] day.

[01:20] Not even one day, in less than a day, in half a day's time, just a few hours.

[01:26] Halloween Pimball and Ultraman sold through to customers and distributors of the United

[01:32] States and Europe and wherever else in the world, people were trying to get this machine,

[01:37] 1700 and 50.

[01:38] And I just want to say, first and foremost, congratulations to Charlie Emory, to Bug,

[01:45] to Kate, to Luke, to everybody over there, to Benheck, to the entire spooky family.

[01:50] They're all over there.

[01:51] And they must be having one of the most emotional moments in their lives.

[01:57] And I mean that.

[01:58] And the emotions they must be overcome with are more than just joy and celebration.

[02:03] I bet there were a lot of tears yesterday in Benton, Wisconsin, because when you reach

[02:09] this point, and there's a moment in your life where what you believed in, what you worked

[02:15] so hard to achieve, there were many years when they probably wanted to hang it up.

[02:21] There were probably many people that were angry at them, there were obstacles to get

[02:25] to this point.

[02:27] This is such a moment of unbelievable satisfaction and unbelievable emotion overtakes you when

[02:36] you get to this point in life.

[02:38] Your dream is fulfilled in a lot of ways when you come up with a concept to make a Pimball

[02:46] Company in Benton, Wisconsin, to go around America with America's most haunted.

[02:52] And you could barely sell 70 games.

[02:55] I remember those years, they remember those years, and they had a limited to 150 before

[03:01] they would sell.

[03:03] But all of that struggle, all of that hard work, all of the learnings they had, all of

[03:08] that, they continue to reinvest in their company.

[03:12] And they reinvest it in themselves to get to this point.

[03:16] And that is why yesterday, it's more than just a moment of whether or not Halloween

[03:21] or Ultraman will sell as a theme.

[03:24] What sold yesterday, and what people invested in yesterday, wasn't just these two themes.

[03:32] They invested in the American dream.

[03:35] They invested in a family.

[03:37] They invested in people they believed in.

[03:40] And this is such an amazing moment.

[03:42] And I love doing this show because I love talking about this.

[03:47] The personal connection this company has to the community, it showed how powerful that

[03:53] is yesterday.

[03:54] It showed that that is more powerful than almost anything in life.

[03:59] When you care about people, they will care about you.

[04:03] And yesterday, the pinball community, and people out there show that they care about spooky

[04:08] pinball, that they value spooky pinball, and that they are willing to jump in and enjoy

[04:15] themes that might be a little bit obscure.

[04:18] I know Halloween's not, but Ultraman is that that doesn't matter.

[04:22] That if you love this, I'm willing to see what you love.

[04:26] I'm willing to jump in on the thing you love because guess what?

[04:30] We love you.

[04:32] And that is something that marketing can't create.

[04:35] It's something that products don't create.

[04:38] It's something that human connection creates.

[04:41] And I see it and I love it and I love seeing Charlie and company and Luke and Bug and I love

[04:46] seeing the spooky pinball in the community on pinside, talking to you in real time about

[04:53] their games.

[04:54] And they are connected to everybody.

[04:57] They're not hiding behind lawyers.

[05:00] They're not hiding behind walls.

[05:02] They're not hiding behind false promises.

[05:04] They're in the community.

[05:06] And yesterday, the community told them what that meant to them.

[05:10] And that is why yesterday, Kaneda was wrong.

[05:14] When Kaneda said they wouldn't sell out in one day.

[05:18] Now I don't know if they've all been spoken for.

[05:20] I did say that you would probably be able to get one the next day, which is today.

[05:25] And I bet some distributors still have these products.

[05:28] So don't get me wrong.

[05:30] They sold through.

[05:31] It didn't sell completely out.

[05:33] But that doesn't matter.

[05:34] If you're over at spooky pinball, you sold every single game you had.

[05:39] They are now spoken for.

[05:40] Your sales force now might have a few to sell to customers.

[05:44] But many, many people tried to get through the door yesterday.

[05:47] So many people so that the website or their internet went down that there were issues at

[05:53] the beginning of this.

[05:54] I will talk about this a little bit now.

[05:56] So at 10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, I went over to spooky pinball and I went to the

[06:00] went to go see what it was like and the website started to crash.

[06:04] And there was obviously way more traffic trying to order these games all at once because

[06:08] at spooky pinball first come first serve.

[06:11] And also that's the order they build their game.

[06:14] So if you get an early build ultra man or Halloween, you're going to get your game soon.

[06:18] If you get at the end of the line, it could be 18 months.

[06:21] So that's another reason why there's like all of this cattle just bombarding spooky pinball

[06:27] is page by the way, this page looks like it was built like 20 years ago.

[06:31] At this point, chucking company, I have to be honest, you've just made a few million bucks

[06:35] invested in a new website.

[06:37] That thing looks like a WordPress site from like 20 years ago.

[06:40] But that's okay.

[06:41] It's part of the charm of this company is that even the website looks like it came from

[06:44] like the 90s.

[06:46] But the point is everybody was trying to get in and then people could get the games in

[06:50] their cards.

[06:51] And then what was happening was their merchant who handles all their credit cards, they

[06:56] were having issues because of how many were coming through because it seemed fraudulent,

[07:00] right?

[07:01] Imagine if you're that merchant, there's like months where nothing's coming through

[07:04] then all of a sudden you're seeing you know, fan club memberships, $45 here, $45

[07:09] there, you know, and it's paced out over a period of months and all of a sudden in like

[07:13] five minutes, there's like $2,000, $2,000, $2,000, like hundreds of people are trying to

[07:19] submit like $2,000 orders.

[07:21] Now I know that caused a headache for some of you out there and some of you out there

[07:25] got frustrated, but I will say this, I went on there and I saw it crash and I kept reloading

[07:30] and I got through and I got games in the cart and they solved the problem eventually.

[07:34] So if you were persistent, you got a game.

[07:37] So I don't want to see anyone run to Pinside and say, oh because of that I couldn't get

[07:41] a game.

[07:42] No, that is not true.

[07:43] If you were on that site for the first half hour or hour of your life, you got a game.

[07:49] And you could have got a game at Nitro or Joe Newhart at Pinball Star.

[07:52] There were distributors who were online and active telling people they have games available,

[07:58] just hit me up and I'll get you a game.

[08:00] So this was not a case in which you just couldn't get it and that was it, right?

[08:04] This wasn't like when I sold Pepsi perfect and in 15 minutes they were sold out and that

[08:08] was it.

[08:09] Like you could get a game.

[08:10] You could get a game.

[08:11] So there were some bugs there.

[08:13] There is some stuff they need to sort of iron out with their ordering process and I'm

[08:17] going to say this right now.

[08:18] I think Spooky Pinball has another golden marketing opportunity.

[08:22] Spooky, listen to me right now.

[08:24] They simply should sell VIP fan club memberships and what would you pay?

[08:30] What would you pay to be able to cut the line and get one of the first 100 games made?

[08:35] This is a really interesting opportunity for them as well because imagine if they said

[08:39] hey for 500 bucks, you get to join the ultra exclusive Spooky VIP fan club and you get

[08:46] to cut the line and part of the first 100 games you will get one of them and we're only

[08:51] going to sell 50 of these for 500 dollars.

[08:53] I bet they could sell every single one.

[08:55] I bet they could sell every single one and people wouldn't even care to hand over that

[08:59] money.

[09:00] They would feel good about it and they would also love to know that they don't have to

[09:03] enter into this mad dash.

[09:06] This Le Mans start to get one of these games.

[09:09] But you know what for me, I actually find it kind of fun that it's like this first come

[09:13] first serve because remember, Stern Pinball doesn't do this.

[09:16] Stern Pinball doesn't open up the order banks online and you get to come through the

[09:19] door and first come first serve.

[09:21] That would have been fair to get a Mandalorian LE.

[09:24] They didn't do that.

[09:25] Jersey Jack didn't do it with their collective's addition.

[09:28] The only company that actually gives you a shot in a way that doesn't require you have

[09:33] years and years of relationships with your distributor.

[09:36] I mean that's where Stern's at.

[09:38] Nobody can get anything from Stern anymore.

[09:40] It's an absolute market for flipping.

[09:43] This is different.

[09:44] There is no way these are all flippers coming through the door.

[09:46] These are fans coming through the door.

[09:48] Now will people flip these machines and try to make a profit?

[09:52] Absolutely.

[09:53] Is flipping, ruining the pinball industry?

[09:55] Absolutely not.

[09:56] It's been with us.

[09:57] It's always going to be with us.

[09:58] And I don't think these games are going to be like MandoLE flipping.

[10:01] We're like all these are all of a sudden $14,000, $15,000.

[10:05] That's not going to be the case.

[10:07] I mean, let's also face the fact that these are still ultra man and Halloween, right?

[10:12] So there are definitely fan bases for these properties, but I don't think you're going

[10:16] to see the type of like, oh, 2 to 3,000 over sticker like you did on Rick and Morty.

[10:22] Because Rick and Morty is arguably a more contemporary popular theme and there was only

[10:27] 750 Rick and Morty's.

[10:30] So this also just puts more spooky games into the world.

[10:33] There's a thousand more games that they released yesterday than Rick and Morty.

[10:38] So I think you're going to see prices around this be pretty steady.

[10:41] And I think that's good.

[10:42] And I think people who bought these machines want these machines.

[10:45] And I think yes, there will be a chance to get them from secondhand people.

[10:49] But I don't think this is going to be some stupid like MandoLE situation where if you go

[10:54] on the marketplace right now on Pinside, look how dumb it is.

[10:58] Go look at how many MandoLEs are up for sale.

[11:01] And it's like all of these guys are colluding with each other trying to set the price at

[11:05] like 13.5.

[11:07] It's stupid.

[11:08] I think Stern should figure out a way to do it like this where you give new people in

[11:12] the hobby a chance to get the Ellie versions of your game.

[11:16] Because if you're new and you want Godzilla Ellie, the only thing you're going to be able

[11:20] to do is pay way over sticker.

[11:22] So there was a mad dash to get the games and those of us who said no way we were wrong.

[11:27] We were wrong.

[11:28] And like I said, this is one of the good things in life to be wrong about.

[11:32] And I'm glad that I was wrong about this.

[11:35] The other thing this shows is simply that things will sell right now in this marketplace

[11:40] like crazy.

[11:41] And I know a lot of the spooky goodwill is the reason why this happened yesterday.

[11:45] But this is showing the strength of the pinball market.

[11:49] And it's showing that now is a great time to get products out there.

[11:52] We can't ignore the fact that these games sold without gameplay even being revealed to

[11:58] people.

[11:59] What does that say about pinball?

[12:00] That just shows how crazy hungry people are for pinball machines.

[12:05] It shows that people are crazy in love with spooky pinball.

[12:09] American pinball couldn't do this.

[12:11] Deep root pinball couldn't do this.

[12:13] Haggis pinball couldn't do this.

[12:14] There is a level of love for spooky to be able to sell this many games in one day.

[12:20] And that is an amazing thing.

[12:21] I am just going to say right now out of all the companies in pinball right now.

[12:25] If I were to mark them by brand love and brand affinity, I think Stern and spooky are

[12:31] just running away with it.

[12:32] And I'm not taking anything away from Stern.

[12:34] People love Stern.

[12:35] These two companies now, spooky pinball and Stern pinball, that is where people have the

[12:40] love.

[12:41] Stern also has a lot of haters because Stern makes so many games and people think Stern

[12:44] cookie cuts and there's some truth to that.

[12:46] And Stern pinball gets looked at differently than spooky.

[12:49] We do not judge these two companies and their games apples to apples.

[12:53] So Stern pinball is very not present within the community.

[12:57] Stern pinball does nothing on pin side.

[12:59] They don't do much on Facebook.

[13:01] They don't connect with us.

[13:02] They don't really care to talk to us.

[13:05] They are so successful.

[13:06] They don't even have time to talk to each person.

[13:09] Spooky pinball does.

[13:10] Now, as spooky pinball grows and spooky pinball has thousands of customers, it too will become

[13:16] more challenging for this small family company in Benton, Wisconsin to stay that way.

[13:23] And the big challenge for spooky pinball, and I've seen this and I just say this out

[13:27] of love to the family over there.

[13:29] The big challenge for spooky pinball is everyone's going to have to keep the egos and check

[13:35] and remember what got them there.

[13:37] And this is always hard when you grow and you become successful and the money comes pouring

[13:42] in and those people who said ultra man's never going to sell and it sold 500, you're

[13:47] going to have to fight to keep that ego in line because it happens.

[13:50] It happens when you have success and you have this kind of success and it doesn't happen

[13:54] overnight for this company, but overnight what happened was magnanimous for them.

[14:00] And there's going to be a lot.

[14:02] A lot of people's heads getting pretty big and they deserve to be and you deserve to feel

[14:07] that way.

[14:08] But that's going to be the challenge is we can't forget where we came from.

[14:11] We can't forget what got us here.

[14:13] What got us here was connecting to this community, listening to what they want, continuing to

[14:19] make better games and ultimately what got us here and if I'm chucking I'm sitting people

[14:25] in the room, what got us here is quality and we've had our quality issues over the year.

[14:31] But we've continued to make these games better and we've continued to put quality product

[14:36] out in the world and take care of our customers when they have issues and that's been spooky

[14:42] pinball story and I do believe that's been the theme of 2021 for me.

[14:46] It's all about quality.

[14:48] It's about the human touch and quality and just look at Jersey Jack pinball over the

[14:53] last year.

[14:54] Look at how the mood has changed.

[14:56] Look at how the conversation has changed.

[14:58] I get that they had quality issues again with their play fields, but that wasn't really

[15:02] where they dropped the ball.

[15:04] Yes, they did drop the ball with that again, but the major ball they dropped over at Jersey

[15:09] Jack pinball was they stopped talking to us.

[15:12] They took away the human touch.

[15:14] They listened to the lawyers.

[15:16] They're sending out emails that lawyers are writing and they're not communicating with

[15:20] us.

[15:21] They're hiding from us.

[15:22] They're banning Canada on the Facebook page.

[15:25] They unfriended Canada because he wanted to talk about the quality issues, what they're

[15:30] doing and I keep trying to get them to change this course.

[15:34] It is the biggest mistake Jersey Jack pinball is making is removing the human touch from

[15:40] their connection to the community and doing everything behind closed doors and emails

[15:46] that no one can read and that is what lawyers will tell you to do.

[15:50] That is what financial accountants will tell you to do, but they're not doing the right

[15:55] thing.

[15:56] I think that's another reason why spooky pinball who's so transparent and so upfront with

[16:01] us and spooky pinball has had their share of issues.

[16:05] They've had their play field quality issues, but unlike Jersey Jack pinball, spooky pinball

[16:10] win and they fixed their play field issues.

[16:13] I think another reason why people went in on these games and were so excited to go in

[16:19] on these games, there's not one person who's buying a spooky pinball machine in 2021 who

[16:24] does not feel like they're going to get the best pinball play field in the world today.

[16:29] They are.

[16:30] Their play fields are the best.

[16:32] These art packages are phenomenal.

[16:34] The game is packed.

[16:36] Both games are packed.

[16:37] They're the same game.

[16:38] It's so exciting to know that you went in on something and there's nothing you're worried

[16:43] about right now other than probably is the game any good because nobody knows if the

[16:47] game's any good and that's the that's the funny part right is like no one even knows

[16:50] if these games are good, but I am going to take their word for it that they're good,

[16:55] but it's like I said at the beginning, they've created something more powerful than gameplay.

[17:00] Think about that people.

[17:01] This company has created so much goodwill.

[17:05] It's more powerful than gameplay and I'm already starting to see some of the Led Zeppelin

[17:10] Apologists.

[17:11] They know who they are, Bezo Boob.

[17:12] I see them on Pinside trying to make these excuses like well tournament players love

[17:17] Led Zeppelin and tournament players might not like these games and I'm here to tell

[17:21] all of you once again nobody cares what the tournament players think.

[17:26] These games are selling not because of flow, not because tournament players are stacking

[17:33] scores and rule sets and it's not a knock against tournament players, but I just always

[17:37] hate that excuse that a stripped down game that has nothing in it is great if tournament

[17:43] players like it.

[17:44] Guess what?

[17:45] Tournament players have to learn how to play almost every game so it doesn't matter.

[17:48] If any game makes it into a tournament then they have to play that game.

[17:52] So what's this thing about the opinions of tournament players matter more?

[17:56] Now home buyers have spoken and they wanted these games.

[18:00] I also think it must be amazing for Charlie and family who visited the people who make

[18:05] Ultraman over in Japan to bring this product to market and to see the success of it.

[18:11] I mean if you're those Japanese people behind Ultraman how honored are you that this little

[18:16] company invented Wisconsin took a gamble on a theme not many people in America were asking

[18:22] for if any and see how successful it did.

[18:25] What a great moment for those folks as well and there must be so much pride by Charlie

[18:30] and company to call them up and say hey guess what they sold out immediately like that's

[18:36] such an amazing feeling and that must make everybody feel so good and Chuck if you go to

[18:42] Tokyo again I want to go because I love Tokyo and anyone who's been to Japan I always say

[18:47] this you should go to Japan before you buy your next pinball machine it is an experience

[18:51] like no other and also what I love about yesterday is simply this no other company out there

[18:58] would bring you themes like this stern pinball for as big as they are it is a little cookie

[19:04] cutter another comic book another movie another dad rock band at some point it gets old

[19:12] it gets stale and I like that we have spooky pinball bringing us more obscure titles and

[19:19] I can only dream about two things and this is what my dreams are for spooky pinball because

[19:25] they are working with John Carpenter's Halloween and they have a relationship somewhere with

[19:30] John C John Carpenter also made big trouble in little China and after seeing yesterday

[19:37] Charlie if you make big trouble in little China if you thought there was a mad dash to get

[19:43] these games with Halloween and Ultraman just wait to they drop something like a big trouble

[19:49] and little China out into the world just wait until they drop a Scooby-Doo into the

[19:55] world like I know they're building one more building next door to build all these games

[19:59] they could build three more buildings next door and offer three more titles like this

[20:03] and everyone would be like take my money now right now I mean that's the vibe with

[20:07] spooky pinball now I want to say something a little bold I want to say something a little

[20:11] controversial right now if I'm spooky pinball and I'm reinvesting in this company and I'm

[20:16] able to make now two games a year and possibly three if we keep growing what I'm doing what

[20:22] I'm looking at is this and this is like they were minor leagues they were boutique now

[20:27] they're pretty major league in pinball they are they are if you look at how many games

[20:31] people are making they're they're right up there if I'm spooky pinball I want to throw

[20:35] out a crazy what if what if spooky pinball took some of the money from all of this success

[20:41] and reinvested it in one thing and grabbed personnel from some other company what if spooky

[20:48] pinball went and tried to get Keith Lwyn or spooky pinball went out there and tried to get

[20:52] Eric Minier do you think this is a good time for spooky pinball to make a bold move like

[20:57] that or get alignment sheets to do some of the code in your games because there's enough

[21:01] time between releases I don't know part of me feels like we don't see that we don't

[21:06] see personnel move from company to company now I know erics an amazing guy and I know

[21:11] he would like to be in like this small family run kind of company he's that kind of guy

[21:15] I know Keith Lwyn is a great guy as well and I don't know if that would work but I just

[21:19] wanted to throw that what if out there like what if one of them joined a spooky pinball

[21:24] how amazing would that be would that create too much of an ego clash it might it might

[21:30] and since Chuck is where he's at right now I mean he's in the driver seat his family's

[21:34] in the driver seat if you're Chuck today you wake up and on some level there has to be

[21:39] a little bit of you know what everyone told me on making games for me that idiot canada

[21:44] said Chuck's making games for Chuck and it's never gonna work and he must have woke up

[21:48] today and be like see he was wrong I trusted my gut and I made stuff I'm passionate about

[21:54] now Chuck I'm not completely wrong because trust me if you make more mainstream themes

[21:58] like Rick and Morty and big trouble and Grandlands and Beetlejuice you will have way more way

[22:05] more people trying to get the games than Halloween and Ultraman I'm not wrong and I hope Chuck

[22:11] understands that the real thing he discovered yesterday is Japanese culture and the geek

[22:16] stuff from the anime world of Japanese culture will sell and I've been saying it forever

[22:21] and I'm just gonna say it right now on my hands and knees please make Akira or Akira as they

[22:27] would say please make it if you think Ultraman is popular Akira is the number one the number

[22:34] one crossover anime Japanese sort of pop culture phenomenon from the late 80s to now like it's a

[22:42] work of art there was just an auction of Akira sells a single Akira sell just sold for 100,000

[22:50] dollars ladies and gentlemen oh it's not popular no one's gonna buy a hundred grand if you worked

[22:56] with Kattashe or Otomo and the artist who work on Akira this thing would sell so fast it's not even

[23:03] funny and I just want to close out this podcast by saying that I also supported spooky pinball to the

[23:09] point where I bought a game I did not buy a game to flip I bought an Ultraman collector's edition

[23:17] with a butter cabinet I'm gonna get invoiced by spooky pinball any moment now and I want to tell you

[23:23] why I bought it because I do love Japanese culture it's always been my thing and I love nerdy

[23:29] stuff like this and I love to discover things that I haven't fully been into it's like Astro boy

[23:34] Ultraman I know they're all there they're all part of the Japanese world I love and so this

[23:39] thing is gonna look so great in my home one day in my game room that's all inspired by stuff like

[23:46] Neo Geo Akira and this fits in perfectly I also am gonna get game number 500 of Ultraman 500

[23:55] which will be the last Ultraman off the line and a few reasons why I want it number 500 first

[24:01] I thought it would be cool to put next to guns and roses next to 500 but also because I need room

[24:07] before I can put these machines in my house and that gives me at least over a year to find a home

[24:14] before this game will be made and that excites me because I need time to find a home Charlie and

[24:19] company and so I wanted to have a little bit of a delay and a pause I'm not flipping this game you

[24:24] won't see canada's Ultraman 500 up for sale but canada also is in on the Ultraman family so I'm

[24:31] happy to join you guys or in that club and I will say yesterday what was also so much fun before

[24:36] I let you guys go is look at how much fun everybody was having and that's also part of what sells

[24:41] these games yesterday it's like you want to be in on the party it's not just FOMO you just

[24:47] want to be at the party and if you're at the party and you got a game it's fun to say hey I got

[24:53] through the door I'm in I got my game and everyone's doing like jumping jacks that makes you feel

[24:58] good this was a day that spooky has worked so hard for it was a day that has taken them years and

[25:06] tears and blood and sweat and they made it and they made it on their terms and the other thing

[25:13] about this game is money's not going to Jerry at p-rock money staying with them and Ben HECK the

[25:18] family came together for these games that also matters a lot to them this is their game these were

[25:25] their games in their moment with the team that got them there that makes them feel so damn proud

[25:32] and I think they deserve a vacation and it's like I said if I were them I would go spend a week

[25:38] in the Caribbean and go sit by a pool and buy a beach put your feet in the sand you earned it

[25:44] you get to take your victory lap okay you deserve your victory lap and you deserve to just enjoy

[25:50] life come back with a clear mind and make these games and you guys did it congratulations to spooky

[26:05] of my life where I can say I'm glad I was wrong spooky pinball 1750 games sold through

[26:14] possibly sold out in less than a day amazing
