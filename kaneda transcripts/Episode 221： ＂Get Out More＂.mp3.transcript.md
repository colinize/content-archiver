[00:00] It just wouldn't be a Monday morning if I didn't put on the headset and do a little pinball

[00:20] podcast for you guys.

[00:21] I got to take advantage of this small window I have with head to head pinball being delayed

[00:25] because of Ryan's travels.

[00:28] Look, I want to do a little, little, little podcast this morning because there's not much

[00:32] news going on and I think we're going to see a lot of news tomorrow.

[00:36] If the rumors are true that Iron Maiden Legacy of the Beast is going to be unveiled tomorrow,

[00:43] I want to talk about that teaser video that you guys watched on Saturday and give my

[00:49] reaction to that.

[00:50] I also want to talk about the big thing happening today which is spooky pinball accepting orders

[00:56] in five minutes time.

[00:58] Now that will be a little bit later.

[01:01] I'm sorry, like when this air that will probably already have happened.

[01:04] So 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time I think is when they're taking orders.

[01:10] Maybe it was 8 a.m. Central Time which is 9 a.m. New York Times.

[01:14] That's big, big news and I think more and more people are starting to realize the situation

[01:21] when it comes to pre-ordering pinball machines and how all these different companies have

[01:25] different methods in which they will allow you to secure your title.

[01:31] Now I want to let's start with Iron Maiden because I really have to say something that

[01:37] may not make some of you happy out there but I literally was embarrassed being a pinball

[01:43] enthusiast reading pinside this weekend.

[01:47] I was embarrassed by people's complaining, by their crying, by their moaning and groaning

[01:53] about what they got on Saturday when it came to that little teaser video for Legacy of

[01:59] the Beast which just basically showed the logo and confirmed that it's coming out by

[02:05] Stern.

[02:06] And it was the worst kept secret.

[02:08] It's like the Stern even need to invest money in a teaser knowing that everyone already

[02:11] knows the game is coming out.

[02:13] Everyone already knows it's Keith L. One, everyone already knows it's Zombieady on artwork.

[02:18] But here's the thing people, when you're crying about a teaser video, what did you expect?

[02:23] It's a teaser video.

[02:25] Do you remember the teaser video for Game of Thrones?

[02:29] Very similar with just the ball rolling across the Game of Thrones map and that's all they

[02:33] did.

[02:34] This isn't meant to show the game.

[02:36] This isn't meant to reveal the game.

[02:38] It's just meant to tell you, hey, guess what, you're right, it's coming out.

[02:42] Here's a little video to just confirm that.

[02:44] That's all it was meant to be.

[02:46] And I think a lot of you out there were expecting way more than you got and then you complained

[02:52] about it.

[02:53] And I have to say, as the weather gets nicer, I don't know about you guys, but as the weather

[02:58] gets nicer and I spend more and more of my time outside, engaged in the real world, the

[03:05] more and more pathetic post on Pinsides seemed to me because these guys, wherever they are,

[03:12] in America, they're all over the place, they're spread out all over America.

[03:17] What complaining about pinball machine teaser videos on a Saturday really indicates to

[03:23] me that some of you guys just need to shut the computer down, go grab a beer, go out

[03:29] with your friends and get a life.

[03:31] Seriously, get a life because some of this stuff people complain about absolutely is embarrassing

[03:37] and it really doesn't happen in most of the other hobbies I'm a part of.

[03:42] I really do feel like pinball people, some of them literally lock themselves in their

[03:46] room with a computer and pinside is their life.

[03:50] Now, what did you expect Stern to do?

[03:53] I mean, just take it for what it is.

[03:54] Now what we'll probably get is what we normally get from Stern, which is immediate, exclusive

[04:01] breaking of the reveal.

[04:03] So usually they go to someone like IGN, they give them all the assets, they give them

[04:08] high-res images, and the game will be revealed with a news story.

[04:13] If that's going to happen, it normally does happen on a Tuesday.

[04:16] Did I not say on my podcast that you are never going to get a game revealed on a Saturday?

[04:21] I said it, and what happened?

[04:23] You didn't.

[04:24] You will never see a game revealed on a Saturday unless it is at a pinball show.

[04:29] But you are never going to see Stern most likely reveal a game on a Saturday.

[04:35] Even remember even when they revealed stuff at Chicago Expo, we received the information

[04:41] and the images on that Tuesday, Wednesday.

[04:44] They are always going to make sure that a reveal occurs when the media is paying attention

[04:50] and they just don't pay attention on the weekends to this kind of stuff.

[04:53] Okay, so let's put that in the past.

[04:57] Let's talk today about something I think is really interesting because we've never quite

[05:01] seen a company do it this way.

[05:03] We're talking about the 500 Alice Cooper Nightmare Castles that are right now.

[05:09] At this moment, as I speak, it is 9 a.m. New York time.

[05:12] The email order banks are open to get on your list for getting Alice Cooper's Nightmare

[05:18] Castles.

[05:19] Now I'm not going to go down.

[05:20] Charlie did a great job of summarizing on Pinside all the different elements that go into someone's

[05:26] order, how they're going to handle it.

[05:28] Basically the way it works is the first 500 orders they get will be where the games are

[05:36] allocated.

[05:37] You are a previous spooky purchaser.

[05:40] You will be bumped to a faster build date.

[05:45] You'll get your game quicker, but they won't let you take someone else's game.

[05:50] When you order a game, it's your game.

[05:53] There's an order build sheet with a bunch of stuff you can get.

[05:57] Everything from shaker motor to mirror blades to butter cabinets.

[06:02] There's things you can put in the game that would make it personalize to you.

[06:08] Because of that personalization, your $1,000 deposit is non-refundable.

[06:14] This is the big, big thing that I've been reading about.

[06:19] People don't feel like they have enough to go on.

[06:23] Enough videos, enough gameplay impressions, enough feedback to make up their mind.

[06:31] I have to agree that it is really, really hard to be asked to give money in a non-refundable

[06:39] way on something you've never played before, something you've never even seen played

[06:45] very much before, and something that's also not complete yet.

[06:49] People are saying, I don't like the way Alice Cooper sounds.

[06:53] He sounds like a monotone.

[06:55] The reality is there's 700 Alice Cooper clips recorded for this machine.

[07:05] You've heard how many, maybe a dozen.

[07:08] So I think it's way too early to say the game lacks any personality.

[07:14] I also think the gameplay video that Charlie put up to show you how the game has flow

[07:19] and this and that and some of the shots.

[07:22] It's probably not enough for these pinball enthusiasts to know, hey, I'm in.

[07:28] I think we're at a little bit of an interesting dilemma today.

[07:32] This has never really been done before.

[07:34] Remember, there's no other company out there that has taken non-refundable deposits.

[07:40] We go back and we think about where did this come from.

[07:44] If you remember, if you remember Rob Zombie, so Rob Zombie was a game where they took

[07:52] $1,000 deposits on, but their deposits when Rob Zombie was announced were refundable.

[07:59] So all 300 spots for Rob Zombie filled up very quickly, but those deposits initially were

[08:05] refundable.

[08:06] Now what happened is midway through Rob Zombie manufacturing and the production of Rob Zombie,

[08:14] putting customers ordered games a certain way and then they backed out when Chuck and

[08:20] Co went to ship them their game and they said, you know what, I don't want it anymore,

[08:24] I want my money back.

[08:25] Now that created a nightmare situation for Charlie because now he's got this game that

[08:31] he built to a certain customer's specification and now that customer backs out.

[08:36] So now he has to go find another buyer who also wants the game exactly that way and that's

[08:43] difficult.

[08:44] The other thing that happened that became hard is that Rob Zombie feedback wasn't the

[08:49] best.

[08:50] So the game wasn't getting the best reviews and people were a little bit lukewarm and

[08:54] so midway through the production of Rob Zombie, you had a lot of people bailing to go get

[08:59] other stuff that was being reviewed better or was getting better ratings or was just more

[09:05] fun for them.

[09:07] And then it actually became difficult to get someone to take over your Rob Zombie spots.

[09:13] So somewhere along the line Chuck said like, you know, we have to make these non-refundable.

[09:18] You order Rob Zombie the way you want it, you're a thousand dollars, you know, it's non-refundable.

[09:22] So that is carried over.

[09:24] That is carried over to the beginning of orders for Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[09:29] Now this has never been done before where the initial deposit on a game to reserve your

[09:34] game is non-refundable.

[09:36] I've never seen another pinball manufacturer try this approach.

[09:40] Well this work is the question, right?

[09:43] And we don't have any past examples to point to to say whether or not it would work.

[09:50] I think that it's going to be an interesting couple of weeks because here's why, here's

[09:56] why.

[09:57] It's Monday, all right.

[09:58] And now we feel like Iron Maiden is about to be announced on Tuesday.

[10:03] We also have looming in the future Monster Bash remake.

[10:08] Okay, so you've got three titles in a very close proximity to each other and I'm not

[10:12] even mentioning who Dini's which are now shipping.

[10:15] So that's four titles.

[10:17] Batman 66 is also becoming great, five titles, right?

[10:20] So there's a lot of places to put your money.

[10:22] Total nuclear annihilation, six titles.

[10:25] It keeps going.

[10:26] The list keeps going and going and going.

[10:28] And so if you're someone and you're about to buy a pinball machine, are you going to buy

[10:33] a game that you can jump on and know you're going to get immediate satisfaction because

[10:39] you know you like the game?

[10:41] Are you going to go in on a stern game like Iron Maiden, which if you go in on Iron Maiden,

[10:46] there's a good chance you're not going to have to wait a very long time to get the game

[10:49] because the other part of Alice Cooper is Nightmare Castle and this is, you know, this

[10:53] has always been the spooky way.

[10:55] They're a small family run business.

[10:57] So it's going to take them 18 months to build all 500 Alice Cooper Nightmare castles.

[11:04] Now that's a year and a half from now.

[11:06] A year and a half from now, if you think about the amount of pinball machines that will

[11:11] be built, that will be available that you will know about.

[11:14] I mean, 18 months from now, we could quite possibly even know about Toy Story.

[11:18] So that's the thing is, do you, are you okay waiting that long and are you okay having

[11:25] your money non-refundable?

[11:27] You're going to, you have to take the game or you have to find someone to take your spot.

[11:32] I think here's a thing.

[11:35] Is, A, I want to say that I think Charlie has made his best product to date.

[11:38] I think the response to it will be very, very stellar.

[11:42] B, I don't think there's enough information out there for people to be 100% certain this

[11:48] is the game for them.

[11:50] C, I think Hilton and Wise Snow should be told by Charlie to stop convincing everybody

[11:55] the game shoots great because he has zero credibility on the forums and I think he actually

[12:01] hurts buyers.

[12:02] If I was Charlie, I would tell him to just stand down because every time he tries to convince

[12:07] you, it makes people run into the other direction because of his history.

[12:11] D, I think Charlie probably has learned a lesson that marketing is really important here,

[12:18] especially when you're going to ask for a non-refundable deposit.

[12:22] I really do think he needed to have more ready to go.

[12:26] And also if you're going to ask people for non-refundable on day one, you might have to

[12:30] wait a little bit longer until the game is more further along before you reveal the thing.

[12:36] And so that's just, it's just going to be interesting to see where it all pans out.

[12:39] Again, I don't know which way it's going to go.

[12:42] Do I think he's going to get all 500 orders on day one?

[12:46] You know, that's $500,000 on day one in terms of deposits.

[12:52] I don't think so.

[12:53] I don't think all will go that way.

[12:55] I think people will be fairly confident that distributors will have a bunch of games for

[13:00] sale that there's no need to lock your money in.

[13:03] I also think that, you know, I don't know if this system is going to work.

[13:08] I'll tell you why.

[13:10] I have a deposit down on pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition, a game for the most

[13:16] part I've been able to play at shows a few times.

[13:19] It is a $1,000 deposit and it is 100% refundable.

[13:23] At any point, I feel I want to change my mind, something happens in life.

[13:28] I want to move in a different direction.

[13:29] I can go get my money back from my distributor.

[13:33] And so I gave that money over pretty, you know, without a doubt, without hesitation because

[13:40] what's the, you know, I don't need to worry.

[13:43] And also it's for the most part, a Collector's Edition is made one way.

[13:48] So I think a possible solution for Chuck is just make the games one way and don't allow

[13:53] customization.

[13:54] Then you don't have to lock people into their customized machine.

[14:00] The devil's advocate in me says, well, people want to order games.

[14:02] They want the way they want to order games.

[14:04] And I do like customization.

[14:05] I think the DIY trend is everywhere.

[14:10] I can order a car the way I want.

[14:12] I can go get custom clothes made the way I want.

[14:14] Why can't I order a really expensive pinball machine the way I want?

[14:17] So I do agree with his approach there.

[14:21] So I think it's going to be an interesting day.

[14:22] I would love for Charlie to come on the show soon.

[14:24] I think he said he would.

[14:26] I'd love to talk about it.

[14:28] I'd love to see how it went because I'm just curious from a marketing standpoint how

[14:31] that worked out.

[14:32] I think if any company's been a little bit more transparent in terms of how many sales

[14:37] they got and how much interest they got in games, I think spooky parents.

[14:40] Pinball has been that way.

[14:42] With Stern, we never know.

[14:43] We never know what numbers they're talking about and when.

[14:46] So I'll say this.

[14:48] I do wish Chuck and family a lot of luck today.

[14:51] And I wish them many, many orders to come in.

[14:54] I do think they care about the pinball community.

[14:57] And I think they care about the pinball enthusiast.

[15:00] And I think they've worked hard to get a game better for all of you out there.

[15:07] Now whether it's your cup of tea or not, I haven't played it enough.

[15:09] I played one ball on it.

[15:10] I can't give my assessment of it.

[15:13] I look forward to playing it in the future.

[15:15] And I think for you guys out there who want something new in your collection, it's a new

[15:20] pinball machine.

[15:21] And we know a lot of you, pinball is like crack and you just have to buy every new thing

[15:24] that comes out so you might as well buy this.

[15:27] The butter cabinets are interesting because Charlie does recommend that you pick up the

[15:32] game because if anything happens when you scratch the butter cabinet, that's it.

[15:37] You're at a lock.

[15:38] So be very careful when you move those in your home.

[15:41] Something else on this little short podcast I want to talk about, and this is something

[15:45] that if we do hear about Iron Maiden tomorrow, if it does get revealed tomorrow, I think

[15:51] it's safe to say that Stern purposely, I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

[15:57] And again, I can just, I'm almost like here like George Gomez listening to this.

[16:01] But how much could Stern really have changed in the game less than two weeks from TPS?

[16:07] They couldn't have brought what they're going to show tomorrow to TPS to show it.

[16:12] And that's just, that's just my thing.

[16:15] Now the thing is this, if what they reveal is just a little gameplay video with images,

[16:21] which is probably what they will reveal, no one's going to jump on and play the game and

[16:24] exploit it for whatever it's missing.

[16:26] So they can control that much easier.

[16:29] It's much more difficult for Stern to control bringing a game to a show and then saying to

[16:34] people you can't play it like they did with Batman.

[16:36] And they have to listen to people complain about that.

[16:39] So this is a much easier way for them to not go to TPS, release after the fact, steal

[16:46] the thunder from all the games that were shown at TPS.

[16:50] And you know, Stern is like, once the game's on the line, the game's on the line, I mean,

[16:54] these games are going to be cranking out real soon.

[16:56] This is not going to be, I do think we're going to see code pretty complete on Iron Maiden

[17:01] when it ships.

[17:02] We're going to see another, you know, Guardians of the Galaxy or Batman situation here.

[17:07] All right.

[17:08] All right.

[17:09] Anything else going on in the pinball world?

[17:11] That's pretty much it.

[17:12] This is going to be a short one.

[17:14] It's going to be a short one.

[17:15] And I don't know about you guys, but I really am looking forward to the weather turning warmer.

[17:20] I had the demon out for a little bit this weekend and I drove into like a, like started

[17:24] like snowing on the way back.

[17:26] I was, I couldn't believe it.

[17:27] I should not be driving in this weather, but I'm just so anxious to get out.

[17:32] I encourage all of you to get out more.

[17:34] I've been reading Pinside and I have to say the, the climate, the climate is getting like,

[17:40] it's just the same toxicity from the same people all the time.

[17:46] I don't know about you, but I just don't enjoy reading that site anymore.

[17:49] I don't.

[17:50] I like the club threads where people actually make amazing mods for games and chime in

[17:55] on helping people fix stuff.

[17:57] But whenever there's these, like new pin threads, it's the same

[18:01] losers with no life who chime in day in and day out.

[18:06] It's like these guys check Pinside 10 times a day and it's really unhealthy and it's much

[18:11] healthier to just maybe read this week in Pimball, maybe catch up on a podcast or two, maybe

[18:17] play Pimball a few times a week and then actually go out and enjoy your life while you

[18:23] still have it.

[18:24] We all only live once and it be a shame to waste the majority of your hours on a Pimball

[18:31] forum or just even playing Pimball when there's so much else to do in the world.

[18:36] Get to that point where you can balance it all and you'll be much happier.

[18:40] That's just my advice as I look out and it's a sunny, beautiful day here in New York City.

[18:46] Everybody, everybody.

[18:47] Let's see how the pre-order model works.

[18:50] Let's get ready for Iron Maiden and let's have a great spring.

[18:55] Oh, and by the way, I am off to Ireland tomorrow.

[19:01] So you might not get as many Pimball podcasts for me as you do in the past but actually you

[19:06] know they have Wi-Fi there and I'm going to bring the computer and the headset.

[19:10] So what am I talking about?

[19:11] You may even get, remember the old days when I used to get drunk in Ireland and go on

[19:16] Pinside and start paypiling people money?

[19:18] Those were the good old days, the healthy days of Pinside.

[19:22] Now it's turned into just a dumpster dive.

[19:25] Everyone have a great day.
