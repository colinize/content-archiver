[00:00] Well, but Canada then released a post on his Facebook page stating that Elwin's actually making the fourth game.

[00:06] That seems super unlikely to me.

[00:09] That seems super unlikely to me.

[00:12] We had Canada's pinball podcast literally holding court for the last week in live Facebook form,

[00:18] virtually taking over the release from Stern as he revealed in Leap more and more information daily

[00:24] about art packages, pricing, features, gameplay, sometimes multiple times a day,

[00:29] while Stern, forced into their lane by their delayed release decision, rightly or wrongly,

[00:35] sat back and did nothing as just about every single piece of their bond pinball puzzle was unfurled

[00:41] as Leap after Leap became public, culminating in the final Canada bombshell.

[00:46] That in fact, there would be another 60th anniversary edition of the game which would be unveiled

[00:52] at the British Film Institute tribute to James Bond.

[00:55] Say what?

[00:56] But wait, it gets better.

[00:58] Rumour has it that this 60th anniversary machine would be different from the other pro-premium and

[01:03] le models in every way, showcasing all of the James Bond actors with possibly even the inclusion of

[01:10] Daniel Craig and sold through dealers with no ceiling on the price, much like what they did

[01:16] with the 40th anniversary edition of Elvira.

[01:19] Say what?

[01:20] The game would be a single level only EM inspired game,

[01:24] much like what Stern did with the Beatles.

[01:27] But the most interesting part of this rumor is that this new 60th edition version

[01:31] would be completely redesigned by none other than the top pinball designer in the world.

[01:37] Wait for it, Keith Ellen.

[01:40] Say what?

[01:54] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:02] What did I tell you?

[02:03] What did I tell you?

[02:04] Was this not the greatest scoop in the history of pinball scoops?

[02:08] Nobody else was saying it.

[02:09] Nobody was reporting on it.

[02:11] A week and a half ago, what did I tell you?

[02:13] There was going to be a fourth edition of James Bond.

[02:17] Check.

[02:18] It was going to be designed by Keith Ellen.

[02:20] Check.

[02:20] It was going to be a single level game.

[02:22] Check.

[02:23] The dealers are going to set the price.

[02:25] Check.

[02:25] I was just off on one thing.

[02:28] I was off on that it wouldn't be limited.

[02:30] It is limited to 500 games, everybody.

[02:33] But you heard it here first on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:36] And everybody on Pinside said I was crazy.

[02:40] Everyone on Pinside said I was nuts.

[02:42] John Elrich has joined the Canada Club.

[02:45] John over at Jack Barr, he said if he lost this bet, he would join and he joined today.

[02:51] Everybody.

[02:51] Look, this is a victory lap for all Canadian fans.

[02:54] And that's why everyone's going to get to hear this show today because I know that my fans

[02:59] want to hear everyone else out there in the pinball community that listens to pinball podcasts.

[03:04] I know they want each and every one of you to hear why the show is so entertaining,

[03:09] why it is so much fun to speculate, and why it is so much fun to try to scoop these companies

[03:15] on their big plans.

[03:17] Nobody else was saying this.

[03:19] This didn't appear on Naps Arcade.

[03:21] It didn't appear on This Week in Pinball.

[03:22] Well, actually it did.

[03:24] Jeff did put up on This Week in Pinball that I was speculating this.

[03:28] The Loser Kid Pinball Podcast covered it.

[03:30] Craig Bobby covered it.

[03:31] And Keri Hardy covered it.

[03:32] But everybody else missing in action.

[03:35] But I just want to say to all my haters on Pinside, how do you like me now?

[03:39] How do you like the Sixth Trippy?

[03:40] Just put the Sixth Trippy right now in the book bag because the world's most humble

[03:47] and the world's worst haircut pinball podcaster is just here to say, damn, I feel relieved.

[03:54] I mean it.

[03:54] I feel such relief.

[03:56] Like I was telling Brenda last night, I really can't sleep because I went all in on this rumor.

[04:01] I went out on a line and then I thought like Keith Elwyn said on a Jack Danger stream that he

[04:07] wasn't doing a James Bond pin.

[04:09] Keith Elwyn himself chimed in and said, show me where I said that.

[04:13] So he didn't even say that.

[04:14] And someone on Pinside basically made that up.

[04:17] So I want to exonerate anyone who's saying that Keith Elwyn lied.

[04:20] Look, it was hard to like go watch three hours of Jack Danger streaming the game.

[04:24] So that's why I think there was some confusion.

[04:26] But let's just say for the record, I think Kaneda hit it out of the park with one of the craziest

[04:33] and strangest rumors of all time.

[04:36] And I'm just happy that we finally got the reveal today.

[04:39] I'm happy we finally got to see James Bond and Ellie format.

[04:43] And I'm just happy like the game is now all available.

[04:46] Like all the information is available to us on what James Bond pinball is going to be.

[04:51] I'm also happy for all of my other pinball content creators out there.

[04:55] And I'm just pulling their legs.

[04:56] Like I'm just happy that we all have content to talk about.

[04:59] That's it.

[05:00] But I also do feel somewhat vindicated because I take a lot of arrows in the back and people

[05:05] make fun of me all the time.

[05:07] And I'm going to say this right now.

[05:08] The reason why my show is entertaining, the reason why it's enjoyable is because we actually

[05:13] want to talk about these rumors.

[05:16] So many people out there will not talk about stuff.

[05:18] Even if they caught wind of this, they would have buried it because they don't want to burn

[05:23] their relationships with Stern.

[05:25] And how do you think Stern felt looking at Kaneda's Facebook page, right?

[05:28] All throughout the week.

[05:29] And they got to see me put up there what was going to happen.

[05:33] Their big mystery, their big surprise was absolutely spoiled by Kaneda.

[05:38] Do I feel bad?

[05:39] No.

[05:40] The reason I don't feel bad is that loose lips, man.

[05:43] I didn't make this up.

[05:45] They told people this.

[05:46] And those people told me.

[05:48] The other reason I do not feel bad at all is Stern pinball is now charging $13,000 for an LE.

[05:56] This launch has been such a weird week and a half.

[05:59] And I want to say this.

[06:00] I do think the LE looks really good.

[06:02] I'm going to talk about that a little bit.

[06:04] But man, I want to start with the sticker shock.

[06:08] If you ordered this game through Stern pinball with shipping and with tax, it is like $14,500 now

[06:18] for a Stern LE in which they are making 1000 games.

[06:23] Just think about that for a moment.

[06:25] Just a few years ago, a Stern LE was $7,500.

[06:30] We are seeing right now about an 80% increase in the price of a Stern LE.

[06:37] And they are also making twice as many LEs.

[06:40] At some point, and I mean it when I say this, I think we're reaching a ceiling.

[06:44] And I think it's just somewhat deflating a little bit that now this is the new par for the course.

[06:50] Jersey Jack wants 12 to 15.

[06:52] Stern's going to now want 13,000 people for every single LE moving forward.

[06:58] And we know the number is going to keep going up.

[07:00] It's not going to go down.

[07:02] And then it begs the question, how much is this Keith Elwin machine going to be?

[07:06] This single-level game that has all the James Bond's in it and has an LCD screen in the game

[07:12] and has 10 drop targets.

[07:13] There's a lot going on in the game.

[07:15] And this is going to be a game that James Bond fanatics are going to want.

[07:18] And there's only 500.

[07:20] So what's the price going to be there?

[07:22] I think they're going to give them to the dealers for 15 and then they're going to set the price.

[07:25] And guess what the dealers are going to do?

[07:27] Are they going to set it at 20?

[07:28] No, they're going to set it at like 25 to 30,000 dollars.

[07:32] It's absolutely bonkers.

[07:34] For the price of a car now, you can get a single level Stern machine.

[07:39] And I think a lot of people are just feeling like, when does it end?

[07:43] When does the insanity end?

[07:45] And I think some people actually blame me.

[07:47] They're like, Canada, you've been telling them all these years that they have multi-millionaires

[07:53] who buy these games.

[07:54] For these gentlemen, it means nothing to spend 5,000 more, 8,000 more.

[07:59] And I think we're seeing it because here's what's going to happen.

[08:02] Even though I think this price is crazy, I still think we're going to see people flipping these

[08:07] James Bond LEs for more than 13,000 dollars.

[08:11] And you have to look no further than Godzilla's now, all of them.

[08:15] If you want a Godzilla LE opened up, you're now spending 16,000 dollars.

[08:21] So this is it.

[08:22] This is the new normal, right?

[08:23] This is absolutely the new normal.

[08:25] And I think for a lot of people, it's not just the LE.

[08:27] Now it's 9,700 for the premium.

[08:30] It's 7,000 for a Stern Pro.

[08:32] And look, I don't think people feel good about this.

[08:35] And the market's going to decide whether or not I moan about this or praise this move

[08:40] because now Stern's just going to get richer.

[08:42] It doesn't matter.

[08:43] Ultimately, the market will decide and we're going to know real soon.

[08:46] We're going to see the first for sale of a James Bond LE.

[08:50] How much is someone going to ask for it?

[08:52] I think you're going to see people asking 16 to 18,000 dollars for it.

[08:56] And I think some people will fall victim to the FOMO and jump right in.

[09:00] I would just caution each and every one of you, just wait a little bit.

[09:04] The worst day to buy an LE is going to be this weekend.

[09:07] Just wait, see where the market settles.

[09:09] So what do I think about the LE?

[09:11] It looks beautiful.

[09:12] I really do love the Thunderball art package.

[09:15] I've always loved the Thunderball art package.

[09:17] I like the armor on the machine.

[09:19] I just think the game looks really good.

[09:21] And then I watched the gameplay video and I'm not so sure.

[09:25] I really need to see this game being played by like Jack Danger.

[09:29] I want to see how it all comes together.

[09:32] And I think that's going to be a really important part of this game.

[09:36] Like, does that rocket?

[09:37] Is it going to get annoying?

[09:38] I know people are saying it looks like a sex toy vibrating.

[09:41] I want to see this stuff.

[09:42] Like, what does the underwater battle look like?

[09:44] Is it cool or is it a cheap gimmick?

[09:47] What does it feel like when you get on the jetpack and it's just James Bond on a wand,

[09:51] moving over to the tank?

[09:53] I will say when I saw that happen in the gameplay video, it was so underwhelming.

[09:58] For some reason, I just thought it would be such a cool thing for that to happen.

[10:02] But then the way he just kind of like poops out the ball and it slowly just hits the tank,

[10:07] it just didn't feel like dramatic.

[10:08] But again, we're watching this happen without music, without call outs,

[10:13] without stuff on the LCD screen.

[10:15] So I really need to see how this whole game ties together.

[10:19] But man, that sticker shock, it still hurts.

[10:21] Like every five minutes, I forget that Stern-LEs are now 13,000.

[10:24] The other thing about the LE that everybody saw today were the inner art blades.

[10:29] And I know these inner art blades were done by a James Bond illustrator.

[10:33] They look a little strange.

[10:34] I'm not going to lie.

[10:35] The whole black and white, like illustration sketches of James Bond in the game like that,

[10:40] it's just a little jarring.

[10:42] It almost looks like a coloring book that just needs to be colored in.

[10:45] And I'm not sure I like them.

[10:46] I need to see it in person.

[10:48] But I just don't like them because now it's not cohesive.

[10:51] Like it's distracting.

[10:52] And I just don't think they look good.

[10:54] I think what would look much better as inner art blades are either decals based on Thunderbird

[11:00] or you have all the movie posters on the inner art decals.

[11:03] I think the second hand market with inner art decals is going to fix the problem.

[11:07] The other thing I don't like, and I'm nitpicking here,

[11:09] the other thing I don't like about this game is the apron for $13,000 Stern.

[11:14] Come on, work on the apron a little bit.

[11:16] You've got all of this source material.

[11:19] You've got all of this James Bond artwork to play with.

[11:22] And you can't make the apron look better than that.

[11:25] I just think it looks really, really bad and lazy.

[11:28] And that's just the only other thing I'm going to gripe on.

[11:30] I love the left side of the cabinet.

[11:32] I love the Translight on the Thunderball Edition.

[11:35] I'm not crazy about the right side with the movie posters, but it is what it is.

[11:40] But overall, I'm just going to say this overall,

[11:43] this is a very, very, very nice game from Stern.

[11:46] It is one of their nicest Ellie's ever.

[11:49] It is also their second most expensive Ellie ever.

[11:52] And so there's a lot of these out there.

[11:54] Isn't it crazy?

[11:55] Like we moaned and groaned when Batman SLE was $15,000 and there was only 80 of them.

[12:02] Now we have a $13,000 game that they're making a thousand of.

[12:07] The whole hobby has jumped the shark James Bond style.

[12:10] Okay. All right.

[12:11] Let me take a breath.

[12:12] The other thing I was right about is they are going to show the games

[12:16] at the British Film Institute on September 30th.

[12:20] Now I thought they were going to wheel out the Keith Elwin game there.

[12:23] The thing is it might not be done yet.

[12:26] So I think we're going to see the Keith Elwin game in November, December.

[12:30] That's kind of a smart move by Stern because I think Stern wants to get every Ellie sold

[12:35] and also get every Ellie made before they show the Keith Elwin edition.

[12:41] I have already spoken to James Bond fanatics who are getting both.

[12:45] Like it is great.

[12:46] They are getting both.

[12:47] And so let's say like the Keith Elwin game is like 20 grand, 25, and then the Ellie is 13.

[12:52] These are gentlemen that are just going to get two pinball machines in 2022.

[12:58] And they are going to drop somewhere between 33,000 and like $38,000 for two

[13:07] Sterns people, two Sterns.

[13:09] I feel like people forgot when Nick Parks came on this show and said it cost Stern about

[13:14] $3,000 to $5,000 to make a game.

[13:17] I mean, we've all forgotten this.

[13:18] We've all forgotten.

[13:20] We've all been delusional about what we're doing with our money.

[13:22] But look, everybody, this hobby is meant to entertain.

[13:25] It's meant to be fun.

[13:27] If you love James Bond and you realize you only live once and you really want this pin,

[13:31] then go get it.

[13:32] I'm not here to tell you not to buy this game.

[13:34] I do think these prices are kind of crazy.

[13:37] I really do.

[13:38] But this is pinball now.

[13:39] The whole market has changed.

[13:40] And if we go into a recession, this pinball hobby is going to get hit pretty damn hard.

[13:45] The other problem happening in pinball now is this.

[13:47] It's like now that these games are coming out at such a high price,

[13:51] anyone who has an old Stern LE automatically now thinks their games are worth a lot more money.

[13:57] And maybe they are.

[13:58] What's a Ghostbusters Ellie worth if there's only 500?

[14:01] What's a Tron Ellie worth if there's only 400?

[14:03] Right?

[14:04] It's just crazy.

[14:04] Now everyone's going to want $15,000 to $20,000 for machines that were just a few thousand over

[14:10] sticker just a few years ago.

[14:12] But I do think these high prices are starting to sort of eat away at the enthusiasm for a lot of

[14:18] people in this hobby.

[14:19] It just is.

[14:20] There's no way around it.

[14:21] But I also do want to applaud Stern for putting more into these games.

[14:25] At these price points, you're going to need to load up games like this.

[14:29] You're not going to be able to sell games like Toy Story.

[14:32] Our expectations are going to be through the roof and they should be because the prices have

[14:37] gone through the roof.

[14:38] But overall, probably one of the most satisfying days of my pinball podcasting career.

[14:44] I am so happy that the rumor that I put out there hit the nail on the head, hit the ball out of

[14:50] the park.

[14:50] And I just have a favor for all my pinball podcasting friends out there.

[14:54] When you talk about this, just remember how to say my name.

[14:59] It's Kanada.

[15:01] All right.

[15:02] Kanada said it.

[15:03] It came true.

[15:04] I love all you guys.

[15:05] I love all my club members.

[15:07] I love all the other pinball content creators.

[15:09] And I'm just feeling great.

[15:10] It's my birthday this weekend.

[15:12] This was the greatest early birthday gift I ever could have got.

[15:15] So you have my biggest scoop become true.

[15:19] And now hopefully I'm just going to say this.

[15:20] Jason Knapp.

[15:21] I love your site.

[15:22] Jason Knapp.

[15:23] You have given every other single pinball content creator credit for when they've called

[15:28] something before it happened.

[15:30] Jason, I'm just asking you politely, please credit Kanada's pinball podcast for saying

[15:36] this is where it originated and then say everything there is about the game.

[15:40] That's all I'm looking for people because you know me.

[15:42] I'm the sociopathic narcissistic pinball podcaster that just needs everybody's attention.

[15:48] But this is how you get the attention, people.

[15:50] You got to take the shots to score.

[15:52] And I put myself on the line a lot and I've had a lot more right than wrong.

[15:56] And all my fans know it.

[15:57] And all my haters.

[15:58] I just got to say welcome to Kanada's pinball podcast.

[16:01] And I'm putting this up for everybody to hear because I'm super excited.

[16:04] Such an awesome time to be in the hobby and such a terrible time for all of our wallets.

[16:09] Was that a pinball party or what?

[16:11] Later, everybody.
