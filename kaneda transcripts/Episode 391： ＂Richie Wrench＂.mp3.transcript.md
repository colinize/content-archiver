[00:00] I don't know, I don't know why.

[00:03] Dang it up, you're not playing.

[00:06] Yes.

[00:12] Welcome to episode 391 of Canatus Pinball Podcast,

[00:17] the only pinball podcast that will send you a fully populated pinball podcast

[00:22] if the one you got before it has a defect.

[00:26] Okay, so on this episode we're going to talk to Richie Ranch.

[00:30] For those of you who don't know Richie, he's a prevalent member on pinside.

[00:34] He's a collector, a great guy, a successful businessman has a large collection.

[00:41] You'll have to listen to hear how much money he has invested in pinball.

[00:45] But he's probably best known for his love affair with Jersey Jack pinball,

[00:50] collectors editions and he has hit pause on buying a Willy Wonka collectors

[00:55] edition and you're going to hear why he has come to that decision.

[00:58] Now before I go on, I need to make a correction because Ian over when he was interviewed

[01:05] by Zach, he is not from the loser kid pinball podcast.

[01:09] He is from the poor man's pinball podcast and I'm sorry Ian, I get confused.

[01:15] There are so many pinball podcasts now poor man's rich man's loser kid slap

[01:21] save slam tilts head to head coast to coast turn insider pinball podcast.

[01:27] Ah, I think I'm the only one that's named after the actual host of the show.

[01:33] Canada's pinball podcast.

[01:34] Okay, but that was a great, great, you know, chat between Ian and Zach and I can't

[01:40] underscore enough that we learned a tremendous amount about what is affecting

[01:44] these games and I will say this too.

[01:47] When I read Charlie's statement and the more I thought about it over the next couple

[01:50] of days, the more I couldn't help but feel that these other pinball manufacturers have

[01:55] not moved quickly enough to address the problem and fix it.

[02:00] I mean, it's just that simple and the company again that's always in my line of sight

[02:05] with this topic is Jersey Jack and that's only because they knew this problem

[02:10] was occurring on Pirates of the Caribbean for so long and they did nothing to prevent

[02:17] it from happening on Willy Wonka and when you listen to Charlie, they went the

[02:22] extra mile to find the problem, find the solution, implement the solution so that no

[02:28] more games would be affected and they could, you know, solve the problem on the games

[02:33] that were experiencing the problems and I think that's what's going to be required

[02:37] here.

[02:38] Now here's the big problem is that spooky doesn't sell thousands of games and they caught

[02:44] it early enough in the TNA run to then fix the problem and later additions of TNAs have

[02:50] no problems but they, you know, they only sold I think something like 500 TNAs in total

[02:56] and if you're a company like Stern or Jersey Jack and you're sending out way more pins

[03:01] that have this problem, I don't know what you do.

[03:04] I don't know what you do, you know, clearly there's a bad batch of games out there and there's

[03:10] bad mix that's going into these clear codes.

[03:12] Now I think we've beat this topic a lot.

[03:15] We've beat it a lot and we're not going to be like Zach Manie, Zach, I love you brother

[03:19] but after that interview with Ian, Zach also was like, you know what, I don't think people

[03:22] should pause buying new inbox games right now and people are saying, well, Zach's a distributor

[03:28] so if he says that, isn't that a conflict of interest that he's always going to try to

[03:33] convince you to buy and of course Zach is going to convince you to buy.

[03:37] I do think that this is a big enough issue to pause and wait to see what the solbs are.

[03:42] I do.

[03:43] I don't think this is a nitpicking.

[03:46] I don't think this is us being like crybabies and winos.

[03:50] Nobody wants to buy a game with defective clear code and I think Ian said it in a probably

[03:54] much more professional way than I have that this is just incorrect way to make something.

[04:00] Like it's a defect in the mixture of the clear code and no one's going to want to own a

[04:04] game that possesses that defect and so you know Zach as much as other people out there

[04:11] like just play your pins and have fun.

[04:13] No, I think it's silly to ignore this issue and just keep going in and giving these

[04:19] manufacturers our money because when we stop doing that and when we raise our voices

[04:23] enough we will see these companies improve what they put into the game right.

[04:29] See this is the thing that always kills me about pinball and then we'll get to this interview.

[04:33] What kills me is you have all of the power buyer you have all of the power like what happened

[04:39] when people started complaining about Stern's artwork and how bad it was what happened

[04:43] they went and got the best artists that we've seen in pinball in the history of pinball

[04:47] and now their games looks spectacular.

[04:49] What happened when people were complaining like guys like roto Dave were like highlighting the fact

[04:53] that Stern cabinets were splitting right what happened when they did that what happened

[04:57] go open up a new Stern pinball machine right now they have reinforced

[05:01] Valley Williams style brackets in their games they have stronger wood where those brackets are screwed into

[05:07] so they are improving that you know what happens when you complain that you you know you want better

[05:12] animations in a game well Stern implementing LCD screen the squeaky wheel will get the grease

[05:18] and that's the thing too it's like for the longest time I've been saying this

[05:21] that the final frontier the final frontier if you guys really want Valley Williams error games

[05:27] again and you want the magic that used to be under the glass and that world under glass

[05:31] I think people need to start not just buying everything and I think you need to

[05:35] demand more pinball magic on the games and better mechanisms and more interesting layouts and more

[05:41] interesting designs and and not just buy everything and if you keep buying everything

[05:47] if you keep buying every single game some of these games are so barren so some of these games

[05:52] lack so much magic and they lack so much innovation and creativity and yet

[05:58] they're still the same price you're still going to run in and buy every alley of this this this this this no no

[06:04] Don't buy it just don't buy it demand more and if everyone just put their wallets back in their pockets

[06:10] games would get much better because manufacturers would have to go back to the drawing board and

[06:15] figure out how to get your money and how to make these games more special and you just if you look at everything

[06:21] like well every pinball is fun you're gonna get the most mediocre

[06:24] Kinds of pinball machines and I think we've seen a lot of that over the last few years

[06:28] Okay, so what else is going on in the pinball news?

[06:30] So it wasn't me it wasn't me that put a big Lebowski up for sale for $45,000 I think some dude in Texas

[06:40] Another guy the same day put or in the next day put his up for sale for $25,000 now these are legitimate

[06:48] First sale price is now the guy selling it for 45 is now looking like a moron because someone undercut him

[06:55] by 20,000

[06:58] Dollars so we're seeing what we knew would happen people would go in with coin taker and then would flip the games for extreme profits

[07:07] As I said to you earlier, I am not flipping this game for a profit

[07:10] So if you have some arrows that you want to stick stick them in the back of those gentlemen

[07:15] And they're getting those arrows. I mean the downvotes are tremendously large on these threads

[07:20] Nobody wants to see these guys do what they're doing because it is it is

[07:25] It is messed up. I mean you really can't look at yourself in the mirror. I'm serious when I say this

[07:30] I don't mind flipping any other pinball machine

[07:33] I don't if you got in early on a Batman Ellie or you got an early on a ghost busters Ellie flip the hell out of the thing

[07:39] You you got online first and you got it and nobody got screwed

[07:42] But with this game you cannot you cannot

[07:47] It just ignore the fact that you are selling what someone else paid for and you are selling it for a huge profit

[07:55] When you could do the right thing and give up your spot to an EA let them buy it from you for 12,500

[08:03] I'm sure they because here's the thing if you're selling it for $25,000

[08:06] You're selling it for even more money than it would have cost a burnt EA an early achiever to just pay

[08:13] Coin taker 12,500 on top of the 8,500 they already lost right those people are

[08:22] $21,000 in on the game and now you want to sell it for 25 and you did nothing

[08:27] I don't care what anyone says none of these people did anything when they're like well

[08:30] I had deposits down with coin taker. Come on

[08:33] You you could have had a word of mouth deposit down or hundred bucks down you're just on their list

[08:39] I mean they just went down a list of people who said they were interested in the game they got one

[08:44] And it happened so quickly by the time the dust settles

[08:48] Everyone's realizing well the EA's are still screwed again

[08:51] And and you know now the latest I'm hearing the rumor is that yeah, Barry has enough to make 50 games

[08:57] Like he's got a bunch of random parts and all this stuff

[09:00] But I'm hearing that we think 50 more games are gonna be made by him and I'm just like

[09:06] Sure when with what money who's gonna put them together and if those 50 games are made

[09:12] Let's just talk hypothetically. They're not going to 50 EA's

[09:16] They're gonna be 50 more games that are sold for $12,500 and it's starting to look really clear

[09:23] That the EA's were most likely never get their games

[09:28] That these games are just gonna be sold to new buyers over and over again because there's no way to

[09:35] Make up that loss revenue with this approach. It's never going to happen

[09:40] Okay, because nothing that's made today will cost nothing. There's no free labor

[09:45] There's no free parts. There's no free warehouses. There's no free factories

[09:51] You need you know, Barry needs everything to be free now

[09:54] I've also hearing like rumblings and rumors that they've found an investor that they have capital

[10:00] Well then say that remember when Jersey Jack needed financial

[10:04] Investments and he got it and he announced it and it was official. I don't believe anything Dutch Pimbal says

[10:12] I don't believe anything Barry says and I don't believe any of the rumors

[10:18] Especially when those rumors are always trying to make us become hopefully

[10:21] Optimistic again that this thing is gonna work out. It's a four to five year boondoggle

[10:27] It's always gonna be one and I don't think the end of this story is gonna be a good one for the EA's

[10:33] I think it's gonna be even more painful because they're gonna see their games go to other people all right

[10:38] You know that being said we saw

[10:41] Two awesome guys, you know, I'm at a loss for who they are just because I don't know

[10:46] I think it's John and someone else they streamed it last night

[10:49] On a on Twitch the game over and over so yeah

[10:53] I'll say this about the game. It looks awesome the theme integration in Big Lebowski

[10:57] Is really what everyone wanted to see that kind of theme integration in Willy Wonka?

[11:01] It is like exactly what you want you got a movie you love you got the characters

[11:06] You got the call-outs you got the clips you got everything you want then you got these mechanical elements in the game that bring those

[11:12] Those elements of the film to life. It's the perfect it is like the perfect

[11:16] Theme integrated pin almost I could I think you could argue that Big Lebowski might be the greatest

[11:24] Theme integrated pin of all time in terms of the full package it has everything you want

[11:31] Almost there with the full music license, but it it it name me a name me a movie pin that has better theme integration than the Big Lebowski

[11:39] And we'll talk about it on this show email me at canada pinball at email calm

[11:44] All right, so here's a weird thing

[11:46] Here's a weird thing tell me if I'm like if I'm seeing things or making stuff up or if someone who listens to the show is trying to pull my leg

[11:54] But what have we been harping on for the longest time on this show is that Jersey Jack pinball has completely butchered the Willy Wonka code and has

[12:02] Completely butchered how they're using the assets in that game and every time I still watch streams

[12:06] I get it boys the game is fun

[12:08] But every time I watch the way the movie clips are utilizing that game

[12:11] I I I want to go lock myself in the bathroom and stick my head in the toilet. I don't understand it now

[12:17] Here's the thing someone emailed me or Facebook chat at me and said hey look

[12:22] Do you realize in the new code in code 1.13 the only

[12:28] Scene in the movie in which there's synced up audio

[12:31] With the video is the Wonka Vader multi-ball and if you go watch clips of that scene

[12:37] It's true like when when will he says like here we go

[12:40] You know and they bust the ceiling it's synced up his voice is synced up with his face and it's awesome

[12:46] It's like that's all I ever wanted was to see the my favorite scenes from that movie in that game

[12:50] But here's the crazy part in the earlier code and and so many to go verify this for me in the earlier code

[12:57] There's about three to four sequences

[13:00] During that Wonka Vader multi-ball build up in which we see

[13:05] Willie talking and the voice is synced with his clip right and I think part of it's like when he's sitting down

[13:13] He's like, I don't know what's about to happen and he's and he's talking to Charlie and his dad and you actually it's synced up

[13:18] There's like three or four clips synced up in the latest code go back and watch how Wonka Vader multi-ball starts and tell me

[13:26] I'm not crazy, but tell me that they didn't remove the first two or three parts of that

[13:33] Video synced up with the with the audio from that Wonka Vader multi-ball beginning like they you no longer see

[13:42] Willie Wonka sitting in the chair saying I don't know. It's about to happen

[13:45] You don't see him, but here's the crazy part you hear that call out still

[13:50] But it looks like they removed the video that goes with it and and and maybe this is just like the conspiracy

[13:57] Theorist and me, but did they purposely do that like did did they are they are they actually removing

[14:05] Synced up video with audio from the game removing it when that is the one thing people want to see more of

[14:12] Are they now removing it and then it begs the question?

[14:15] Did Jersey Jack ever have the license and the licensing agreement to use

[14:22] Video from the movie with audio at the same time

[14:25] I mean imagine watching the big Lebowski stream and all those clips from the film are never synced up

[14:32] With the actors imagine imagine how that game would play now or how the experience would be so all I'm asking is this

[14:38] And this is where maybe I'm gonna do a whole nother pinball podcast about this, but just tell us the truth

[14:43] Why is it so hard to tell us the truth?

[14:47] You know why is it so hard if Jersey Jack doesn't have permission to use the assets in that way just tell us that

[14:53] Don't lie to us and say well

[14:55] We didn't want to do it that way because it would be repetitive and that's such BS and and that's the thing

[15:01] I think that's the difference and that's why like people are looking at Jurassic Park differently

[15:04] Because Stern didn't lie to anyone and mislead anyone they said hey

[15:08] It's not based on the movie so you're not gonna see any movie clips

[15:10] Okay, now I can accept it for what it is and either like it or not like it

[15:14] But I always feel like Jersey Jack has been spinning this topic

[15:19] They just need to be transparent about what kind of agreement they have with the game

[15:25] Otherwise, it's just it's they did it with pirates, you know

[15:29] And and and even then at the very beginning they didn't tell us they couldn't and then it started to leak out the realities of the agreement

[15:36] But I don't think they have permission to use the clips from the movie with the audio from the actors and and here's why

[15:44] I don't think they they don't have it and they should just tell us that because if they have the rights to use that stuff and

[15:50] They're not using it. It is the most idiotic coding decision in the history of Pimble and I don't think it's idiotic

[15:59] If they don't have the rights you see what I'm saying

[16:01] But they've never come out and just told us we don't have permission to use it and so then I'm allowed then to speculate

[16:08] Okay, then then then you do a permission because to Eric Eric Katz said or no, sorry Eric Katz joke Katz said

[16:15] We we have the rights, but we didn't want to use it because it would get repetitive

[16:18] Well, then that's a lie unless that's true and if that's true, it's the dumbest move ever, okay?

[16:23] Do you agree or disagree can you hit a pinball gmail.com?

[16:26] All right everybody

[16:27] Let's one final thing and speaking of lying and telling the truth

[16:32] American pinball is telling the truth that Houdini is no longer

[16:37] Going to be made after like I guess they put out a final notice a final call to action

[16:42] If you want to get your Houdini

[16:45] Now is your last chance. Well, let me break it to American pinball the demand for Houdini has been dried up now for about a year and a year and a half

[16:56] Even at least over a year I do love this like special like now is your last chance to get something nobody wants right now

[17:04] Come and get it and then they also said there's special deals on it

[17:08] Well, let me tell you the most special deal on a Houdini is everywhere else because you can go grab a nice

[17:15] Home use only Houdini for six thousand dollars games are not holding value games are tanking

[17:21] I just saw monsters premium for like 6200 bucks with like no plays on it

[17:27] Holy cow think about that for a minute you can just wait a few months six months and get these premiums for the price of pros

[17:34] Get these L.E.s for the price of premiums. It's starting to look like buying pinball new in box is a

[17:42] Bad business decision unless it's a game you love and a game you want to keep for a while

[17:48] Because you are going to take a quick hit now which you didn't before and I think that's good

[17:54] I think again. It's gonna make people pause and wait now speaking of buying new in box

[17:59] There's a man

[18:00] He's about to tell you how much money he has in new in box games

[18:04] I have to say the quality is probably not the best. I was talking to Richie. He was on his cell phone

[18:10] He didn't have a headset, but it's okay. It's his first time doing this

[18:14] It's always exciting to invite someone

[18:17] Who's always very vocal and always very animated on

[18:21] Pinside and inviting them on the show and I think he was a little nervous. I think it was his first time

[18:26] I think he did great. I think you're gonna enjoy it. I think he's one of us

[18:30] You know, it's like always fun to have one of us who we see all the time on Pinside

[18:35] Join the show and and provide you some entertainment and I hope I hope I I hope I did a good job and like walking him through and I told him

[18:42] It's just gonna be a casual fun pinball chat and it is so let's air that now

[18:46] Ladies and gentlemen

[18:48] Somebody go verify for me that Willy Wonka wonka Vader if it's different and maybe they just like when they did the code update

[18:54] Maybe they I don't know maybe something happened in that and that's the only thing that happened

[18:58] But I don't know I've just I did these little things

[19:00] You know, it's the little detail sometimes right? I feel like I should have been an investigator

[19:05] Isn't it always like the little clues that break the case wide open and I'm just trying to get the truth out of why

[19:11] Wonka is coded the way it is. Yes, I'm an I'm I want it this game so badly

[19:16] I need to know where things went wrong. All right, everyone have a great day Mr. Richie wrench

[19:21] I want to welcome to Canada's pinball podcast a man who's very well known for wanting his

[19:28] Coin doors powder coded Mr. Richie wrench Richie. Welcome to the show. Thank you

[19:34] Thank you very much now. This is do you listen to pinball podcasts? Because I think I think you

[19:40] Have you heard the show before I've heard of the show

[19:43] I've seen I've heard some of podcasts. You know, and just you know clicking on you know to do pen side or something

[19:52] but this is my first time actually

[19:55] Being on the on broadcast so it's kind of um, you know, it's different and

[20:03] nervous a little bit, but that's hey, that's fun. It's cool. It'll be painless. We'll make it painless

[20:07] So I Richie I've followed you for a few years on pin side not stalking you

[20:12] But I've always loved your excitement mainly around the collectors editions of Jersey Jack pinball machines

[20:19] Why do the collectors editions get you so excited?

[20:23] You know

[20:26] You know pinball my first pinball machine was Frankenstein from my bed

[20:30] And I just got hooked into it and that was pinball

[20:36] I've always been a fan of pinball machines and stuff, but

[20:40] And then there was the time this was you know man wow good years ago. Maybe over 10 years ago 12 years ago

[20:45] and

[20:47] That was the time when you if you wanted a medieval madness or a monster bash

[20:52] You had to go to certain companies that would refurbish them and then the you know people would get their games

[20:58] You know modded out and you know like new and you was spend

[21:03] You know 12 15,000 plus for those games

[21:07] So and I always wanted something that was nice and you know over the top and you know really cool

[21:12] So you know you got power coating done and the legs and at that time nobody was doing that

[21:18] I mean Stern wasn't doing that. I mean it was just you're playing silver legs and

[21:22] The games and of course the games are cheaper back than two but you know that's just I just I just saw

[21:28] I just you know these games people are doing things taking things to the shows and modding them out and you could do things

[21:33] So I thought that was just really cool how they just took pinball into the next level and just made it nicer or the toys and stuff

[21:39] I just I liked it so right and I knew it was something that was gonna be coming down in the industry

[21:43] You know that you know Stern and the other companies would you know pick up on that so and they did so

[21:50] My only thing with the collectors editions or at the time, you know, it was a really collectors editions then it was a you know

[21:56] They called them LE's you know and

[21:59] The LE's was a you know that was a step up

[22:01] That was the one with the powder coating or the few extra toys on you spend an extra no 1500 or 2000 for so

[22:08] Right and you've got and Richie's for those of you don't know Richie's got a I would assume a very successful

[22:16] plumbing business with you know and you've got a showroom in which you display

[22:21] An amazing array of games you've got a bunch of Stern LE's you've got all the Jersey Jack games to date except for Willie Wonka

[22:29] We'll talk about that

[22:30] But you've got a Tron LE you've got a Metallica you've got ACDC back in black Ghostbusters

[22:36] So you like the games that are dressed up and and you're right right when people used to get those older games and restore them

[22:43] They would sort of go an extra mile to make them as beautiful as possible Richie when you do you think these games?

[22:49] Do you think there's still a ways to go in terms of getting the value and these sort of more expensive games right because now collectors editions are

[22:59] $12,500 do you see the value in that over the LE of the Jersey Jack games?

[23:03] I

[23:06] Mean I do see it's like

[23:09] Well if you're talking about the 12,500 hour games and we're talking about Pirates of the Caribbean we're talking about dialed in

[23:16] We're talking about the collector's editions so we're we're drawing by Jersey Jack for

[23:21] For Pirates of the Caribbean absolutely I see it, you know the play field was different

[23:26] They they did a few things on the game that just you know that game

[23:31] I think to this day will still hold its value

[23:35] They only made 200 of those if I believe was correct, you know, so the the the edition was low

[23:42] Doubt in was the first

[23:45] Cletters edition so

[23:47] The play field was the same

[23:49] I think they stepped it up from dialed into Pirates of the Caribbean because they totally changed the play field

[23:54] Which really made it that was that made it unique so they

[23:57] They took a game

[24:00] For someone that was paying the extra money for the collector's edition of people that wanted to invest in that and pay the extra money and say hey

[24:06] This is I saw the value in that very easily and I think those games hold

[24:12] Very well on dialed in maybe not as much

[24:18] They also been and they not the code you average but they didn't change the cabinet artwork either on dialed in right it was sort of like a first

[24:26] Step into this collectors realm they they changed the the armor on it's got some

[24:32] Graph you know, it's got with that like that fireball on it, but the same artwork, right? If you look at it on a side looks just like the Ellie

[24:39] It does

[24:41] But Pirates all new artwork

[24:44] I'm both cabinet and play field which is cool. It was it was it seemed like a special upgrade

[24:51] So

[24:52] Let's talk about I know you like the the you know the crem de la crem

[24:56] Let's talk about why they still can't get you the coin door. What do you think? I mean?

[25:01] Is it that much more work to get the coin door power to code it? What do you think?

[25:06] no no

[25:08] Jersey Jack or Stern just needs to put me on their payroll it would happen. I think that is a

[25:15] That's just my personal opinion. I think it can be done

[25:20] I've you know enough funny way we've talked about this and I've talked to Jack and I've talked with a lot of people

[25:26] But I even hit a poll on it really was 50 50 and I still amaze to this day that you know if you guys someone that's willing to pay out

[25:35] 12,500 I look at the pirates of the Caribbean like right now I'm looking at it right now

[25:40] Stern in my game my number 12 collectors edition

[25:42] I cannot see that coin door being black when everything else on that is

[25:48] Powdercoated I just can't get my head around it same thing on the dialed in I just cannot I'm looking at the

[25:54] You know the metallic purple on this and then then look at a black door, but

[26:01] Some people can take it to the next step on the on the coin

[26:06] covers the housing on the coin on where you insert the coins and then some people have done like chrome or something on that

[26:12] No, take it up even a step up. I've seen those out there done like that. So

[26:16] You know, it's just it's to me. It's I think it should be powder code

[26:22] We're paying that kind of money. That's just my ping-in on the coin door. I've always felt that

[26:27] But at the same time I think the I think the leg bolts should also be

[26:32] powder coated too, so but

[26:35] So and Richie you've you've powder coded these games because I'm rich. He's actually he's on Skype right now

[26:42] You can't see it, but I can see his collection and he's got the the those games powder coated to the color to match the game

[26:48] So Richie, who do you send your coin doors to to get the work done?

[26:52] I

[26:53] Actually send mine to Matt with back alley

[26:56] I'm all my power coating has been done through Matt. I can actually send it here locally

[27:01] here in town and I just choose not to because I know that the quality that I get from

[27:08] Matt from back alley stuff like I'm not gonna have the issues and if I do he takes care of me

[27:12] I love it in this video ladies and gentlemen

[27:15] There's a sea of games with almost all of them if not all of the coin doors have been powder coated so

[27:22] They do look phenomenal and Richie. I think you're on to something that for the amount of money people are spending

[27:28] It does feel like there are certain details that are still left a little bit unfinished and I think

[27:35] It's time that if we're gonna pay that premium

[27:38] Just just powder code everything that can be powder coated to match right it just seems a little bit lazy that they stop at the coin door

[27:47] It is being I mean it is being lazy that they stop it's not that much more

[27:52] If you're gonna have that done if it is a cost issue, I mean for me

[27:57] It's worth it if it's an extra

[27:59] Unjust on it out there if it was an extra $300

[28:03] $400 to get a game that's finished versus when I get it

[28:06] Okay, I'm gonna play it unbox and I'm gonna play it for a little while and then I got to take it apart and ship it and send it to a

[28:12] Madden you know wait a wait a week or two to get it back

[28:16] But you know if that's what it is for now. That's what we do

[28:19] But yes, I agree 100% it it needs to and it can because if you look at pinball

[28:26] Over the years, it's it's always stepping up

[28:30] And it that steps up it steps up whether it be on whether it be hardware toys

[28:36] Technology, you know the camera that Jersey Jack uses

[28:41] It's just so there's not a reason not to do it

[28:46] It can be done. So let's talk about your decision to pause on

[28:51] On

[28:52] Getting Willy Wonka collector's edition number 12 and for the listener of the show why number 12 in all these games

[28:59] And then let's talk about Wonka

[29:01] Wow number 12

[29:03] It's just my that's number 12 is just my lucky number. Okay, in my luck for since I've been a little boy and

[29:10] You know in some of the games if I can get number 12 great, but

[29:13] For Jersey Jack, I just

[29:16] You know, I believe in Jersey Jack from the very beginning

[29:18] So when it was Wizard of Oz, you know, I wasn't able to get the number 12

[29:22] And you know that I wasn't really to the Sun. I was you know glad to get one just get one of the games

[29:27] And it was I think I got number 900 on that

[29:30] And then Hobbit

[29:32] There was

[29:33] There was a there was a there was a there was something that does have I got number 10. I was just not looking at it was number 10

[29:40] I was

[29:41] Somebody else had got number 12. He actually sent me a picture of it. I was like who I was just playing around with me

[29:46] with it and

[29:48] But I could not get it, but when they did the collector's edition

[29:52] I made sure I got in on it early and I asked for number 12 and that guy should just swap

[29:59] He should swap his plaque with you. Come on whoever that is

[30:02] Is that isn't that the only real difference on the or on the apron just swap those things

[30:07] Right, so Richie. Let's let's talk about Willy Wonka because

[30:12] there's obviously a lot of

[30:15] Concern for those people who are

[30:17] pending on a purchase of a collector's edition on the play field issues

[30:22] Which seems to be the main thing right now sort of permeating throughout

[30:26] Pinside and the entire hobby right now because people are seeing this issue pop up

[30:31] On pirates of the Caribbean which you said you don't have that issue

[30:34] But we're seeing it on Willy Wonka. We're seeing it on Jurassic Park

[30:38] What has made you pause on buying or committing folly to the Willy Wonka collector's edition?

[30:44] Well, I started seeing some things on

[30:49] On Pinside and

[30:52] And when I first saw it I was like okay, it was on the Willy Wonka games on the L.E.s

[30:56] I was just kind of watching it

[30:58] Maybe see if there was any kind of leaks that would come across for the

[31:02] For the CE that we're still waiting to see what might be coming down the road here

[31:05] And I just started seeing are start you know seeing these things that people are showing on their games

[31:10] About these about chipping as like that's just it can't be because this game just now came out

[31:14] How can there be some issues with chipping on the boards and stuff so I wanted to

[31:21] Step back and um

[31:24] Look into it more so I looked at some other

[31:26] um

[31:27] Post and one person were directed me to go to the pirates of the Caribbean one

[31:31] Which actually was started uh months ago, I guess and had over well over two thousand posts on it

[31:37] I guess that's something that was going on with that and I didn't know anything about going on with pirates of the Caribbean

[31:41] So I started looking into that one. I was really

[31:44] Shocked and amazed that people were having problems with the pirates of the Caribbean play field so

[31:50] You know of course I went and looked at mine um when I could and uh

[31:55] No issues no issues with the chipping or pulling or anything on the play field

[31:59] But at the same time

[32:02] I had some friends and people show me pictures and I thought okay these are people I know

[32:08] and

[32:09] At the time I was like okay

[32:12] You should be able to get a play field and I asked the question, you know, what's a populated play field?

[32:16] I didn't know I thought it'd be just something simple just to get a play field and be able to switch it out

[32:21] Which I don't work on my games. I like I'm very lucky

[32:23] I have somebody in the area that can work on uh

[32:26] Putting on my mods and stuff like that and he's no other gentleman, but he's great at doing that stuff

[32:31] But he he he did talk to me. He said yeah, that's a very big deal to take a play field

[32:37] Even for him

[32:39] To switch it out and you know he said it'd be well over a thousand dollars to do something like that

[32:45] That's like wow, you know

[32:47] and um and so the solution is to you know buy a play field at a discounted price

[32:53] Which I felt that it should be at no cost to the uh customer especially on people that paying

[32:58] See for me. It doesn't matter if it's if you're paying five thousand dollars for a game or if you're paying

[33:04] You know on these aliens 9,500 and of course on the collectors edition you're paying 12,500

[33:10] You know you got problems with a uh with a board that's chipping

[33:15] You know why are these people even paying five fifty?

[33:18] You know for a play field so I just I had a problem with that so

[33:23] um

[33:24] I made my own decision and got in touch with Joe and uh and then after that I close it

[33:31] What what is the distributor telling you right now? I mean Joe's a good guy. Joe's in in communication with Jersey jack

[33:37] Have they communicated that there's a fix for this problem or is it still been pretty

[33:43] ambiguous what the solve is moving forward with this issue

[33:49] Um, yeah, there's there's nothing really being said Joe's uh Joe knows about it. He's aware of it

[33:55] but I am pretty sure that

[33:58] um

[33:59] Nothing has come down from you know from the Jersey jack side

[34:03] Um to him um if it was I'm sure he would have told me about a abrid shirt, you know

[34:07] Hey, don't step out. This is what's going on. They're gonna do this this and this you know, don't step away

[34:12] Yeah, I mean Joe would Joe would have said that to me

[34:15] Um and he's still supports my decision and you know and if I went back in and you know, it's it's there for me

[34:21] You know to do it, but I think that's what we're doing is given a time to see

[34:25] What is going to be the solution for people that are being affected by this because for me

[34:31] It's also what if you know, what if I get the number 12

[34:35] Collector's edition and then I'm playing it and two months down the road the board starts chipping

[34:40] You know, then I got a serious problem and you know, that's

[34:45] Between Joe and I you know because that's who we bought it from we bought it from Joe. So and I don't want that

[34:50] Um, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna take that chance

[34:52] I'm gonna take a stands that you know the company needs to stand behind their product

[34:57] And no different for me if I'm doing plumbing. I gotta stand behind my product. You know, so

[35:03] Um, I'm a firm believer in that and um, you know, it will kill me to uh, you know, because I'm very big on pinball

[35:10] You know, you talked about earlier about my collection

[35:13] I have my office just as a passion of mine. I'm very fortunate. I can work in the plumbing field

[35:18] Um, you know, we have we do have a successful business

[35:22] But at the same time there's only two people in my company three people have to count my dad

[35:27] So we're a very small company, but if you look at my

[35:30] Profile and you look at the business you think we're much bigger, but we're not so but one of my passions is pinball and

[35:36] And have it in my office space here

[35:38] I didn't want to show toilet displays. I wanted to be for the people to come in the kids to come in and play these games

[35:43] Someone just for the first time I've ever played in pinball and just to see their eyes light up

[35:47] Just brings me pleasure of doing that. So so what rich rich you what would you take from

[35:52] Jersey Jack to get you back in on the game

[35:57] You know, I

[35:58] It's hard to say that because um, I just think they need to do something other than

[36:03] Something other than just give somebody. Hey, here's a play field that you know, you have to pay five fifty four

[36:08] And you know and that's

[36:11] That have to settle with that and some people out there doing that. They're actually being forced to settle with that

[36:16] That's not a solution

[36:17] Uh, a populated play field is a I think that's a fair solution

[36:21] If this is not as I mean one question is is how

[36:25] Why spread is this really?

[36:27] Um, that's that's one question that we really don't know I mean I know a lot of people that are having problems with it

[36:33] But for me if um, I mean one

[36:36] Person is enough that they should get you know, uh, get it taken care of but

[36:41] I know of about 15 to 20 um

[36:45] Better having issues

[36:47] Personally that I know and those people need to be taken care of and I think that's what needs to be done

[36:52] Uh, right. Do you want to see them say that they're going to extend the warranty to cover

[36:58] Playfield issues like this and also rich you just

[37:02] Articulator communicate that they found the problem and they have now fixed it in all games moving forward

[37:11] I think that's very um, that's one of the that's that's the first thing and I'm and I would be surprised if Jersey

[37:15] Jack is not doing that and other companies too if this is affecting other companies as well um

[37:21] You know, there's um

[37:23] I haven't had time to research this I saw I just come across early today is that um

[37:27] That the spooky was having an issue with some of the playfields and they found the problem

[37:32] They fixed it you know

[37:33] Um, so that was one suggestion was them to reach out to Charlie

[37:38] But I mean yes, I mean Jersey Jack or whichever company

[37:42] needs to

[37:44] Uh extending the warranty on the playfields is great, but what's the solution when there is a problem

[37:48] You know is it just is ascending washers

[37:52] Um or you know a discounted price on a playfield to me that's not enough as I don't think that's going to make the people out there

[37:59] in the pinball community

[38:01] Happy and at the same time. I think people are gonna be nervous about buying

[38:05] Games new in the box. I think what you're gonna start seeing is with this going on at this continues

[38:10] people like me will

[38:12] Will wait you know will wait a year

[38:15] Down the road and get um and buy someone else's game that we know there's been no issues or

[38:20] you know

[38:21] They're just maybe you know either

[38:24] Tired to play in if they're already you know moving on to the next game and they want to just selling you

[38:28] Get that at a discount for but for me I just I like the new games and

[38:32] For it to be new but um and I got a great relationship with Joe and um

[38:37] Whether it be a Jersey Jack or no Chicago gaming or

[38:41] Anything I buy directly through him. So I want to and I went and I still will and I will keep that relationship with Joe

[38:49] No matter what I mean I could have bought directly through you know Jersey Jack or through

[38:54] But I said no I'm gonna stay with Joe and buy directly through him because I got that relationship with him

[38:58] So right did you get your money back as you still holding on to it just to wait and see what the the final resolution is

[39:06] Now I tell Joe just to keep it. We'll use it towards another game. I mean, I'm not out of the

[39:11] uh the pinball um buying pinballs. I just I think something will happen

[39:17] I would be really surprised it's still kind of early enough for me at least from when I posted

[39:22] Which I've been um, I do want to say thank you to everybody that's reached out to me and was support because

[39:28] A lot of people have applauded me for taking a stand on it, but I don't think I'm the I think other people have done it before I did it

[39:36] Um, Pinside I think other people have

[39:38] held off or I'm in the same boat as you but the reason I held off on wankas

[39:43] I just wasn't really happy with the way the code was going

[39:46] um

[39:46] But with the collector's edition also richy like when do you think you you're gonna even

[39:51] See it because you're they're asking people to pay up and fall

[39:56] Uh, and I hear distributors are saying early September, but if this issue is happening and they don't have a solve yet

[40:04] I imagine they're gonna have to hit pause on the assembly line of the collector's editions because they can't afford

[40:11] To have the most expensive version go out with any issues

[40:15] That's correct. That's not gonna happen. I think you're gonna see very few people

[40:19] I mean, I love Joe to death and uh, I got the email about the collector's editions. They're great. Okay. This is it

[40:26] This is what they're gonna

[40:27] We're gonna find out what's on it and then it's like oh, okay. It's end of

[40:31] This month in august when we'll find out and then of course

[40:36] When you get the information from jersey jack when they um finally release it

[40:43] Okay, we need our we need our payment, you know

[40:46] Uh, but that's this now

[40:47] You think so are we gonna see it this week because that's that's this is it and of august

[40:53] I I don't know. I don't I don't think so I thought I saw it by now. I thought I saw it last I thought for sure last week, but um

[41:01] Yeah, it's what august 24th 25th. So yeah

[41:05] So five days left

[41:07] So

[41:08] Okay, so I think richie just to sort of close the topic of jersey jack and the play feels I think a lot of people are in the same boat

[41:15] Is you I think a lot of people are gonna be adopting this let's wait and see what happens

[41:20] I want to wait to see what the resolution is I also want to

[41:24] Understand the manufacturers warranties around these play field issues because as you articulated very nicely

[41:32] A play field swap is not an option and having to spend $550 on something that was mailed to you defective from the manufacturer

[41:41] Is also not an option the only real option here right is that they find the problem

[41:47] And they fix it for the price they're charging for these games

[41:51] Okay, so

[42:02] The mafia so talk to me about how that ended up in your collection

[42:08] um

[42:10] Well joe sends me a message that hey, I got a pinball here for you know for a surprise and uh

[42:18] He you know he only had two and um I think they only made ten of these games and they were gonna

[42:24] Supposed to make more but you know maybe because the game didn't take off and it wasn't that popular so

[42:30] They went that's an understatement richie that the game didn't take off but they're you have one in joe is one right

[42:36] correct joe has the other one. How is it

[42:40] Is it fun? Oh, yeah, it's I think it's fun. I

[42:45] I

[42:46] For me if this is a game that was a price that I can I can't remember what the game price is

[42:50] I was saying 500 I think it was really highly priced for a very simple game

[42:55] Yeah, I agree. I mean was was was was wo nnellie about that price to or no

[43:00] Um, you know, I think I think wo nnellie was around that I think it was around like 7,000

[43:07] Yeah, I just um

[43:09] I think it's a great game. I mean for the price that I got it for it was uh

[43:13] I don't think I could ever lose on it and um

[43:17] But it was uh it was unique. I thought it made me well. Okay, if I'm gonna have people coming over and

[43:22] You know looking at it. Maybe it's not a you know a popular game, but I think I would have some people that come over to my uh

[43:29] My pinball party that I always have the week before the Chicago

[43:34] Expo

[43:35] They'll come up and say oh wow, you know

[43:36] I think some Pimp Siders can let they'll say oh wow mafia. It's fun to play it

[43:40] So I like it. I like playing it simple. I like it. My dad likes the simple games. He's not all into the

[43:45] Deep code and the ramps and trying to shoot this up here and this and that so

[43:49] My dad likes the simple ones too. So he liked it. I thought I thought it was a fun game very fun game

[43:54] So you you've got variety there you've got virtual pin you've got um

[43:59] Sterns Jersey jacks

[44:01] Ever consider putting a p3 multi morphing there?

[44:07] Yeah, yeah, I would consider that

[44:10] What

[44:11] All right, but like have you played it? Have you been to to shows? Have you?

[44:16] I'm curious because you do have a you know, you have a wide variety. So I'm just curious as to

[44:21] Whether you have spooky games there

[44:24] You have Chicago gaming company games there, but nothing from American pinball and nothing from p3 multi morphing have you

[44:31] any any

[44:34] Any desire to put any of those games into into the mix? I mean if um, I do if something I have to see in like

[44:42] So I've been to um, I normally go to just the Chicago expo and there's a couple of shows up into the Texas one

[44:49] Couple times and stuff so I try to get out to some of the other ones um

[44:54] But just nothing that's really um

[44:57] That hasn't really grabbed me yet. So not yet, but I'm not gonna say I wouldn't

[45:03] And I think it's great that there's um

[45:05] Other pinball manufacturers out there doing things from heel different varieties and different stuff

[45:09] I think it's great and uh to have that on my showroom floor to show the different ones from you know

[45:15] The Star Wars episode one you know and to Chicago gaming's the remakes on the those and the

[45:21] The Adam's family goal that I have that's actually the

[45:24] Original Adam's family goal. Oh, you know, I got people that come in and see that and say oh wow

[45:28] You know, you got Adam's family goal here, right? So and that's an older game, but

[45:33] Yeah, I like I like the variety. I like the simple games

[45:36] um, yeah, it's fun

[45:38] What would be your dream theme that if you could snap your fingers and and make a pinball machine out of a theme

[45:43] That's not currently available. What would you what would you want?

[45:47] Oh, wow, it'd be a richy wrench one

[45:51] With a toilet

[45:52] Exploding inside well, what about super Mario brothers? Is that close enough to plumbing for you or no?

[45:58] um, wow super theme um

[46:02] I don't know I I thought when Ghostbusters came out. I thought that was a great one. That was really I thought that was really cool and um

[46:10] I haven't really gave that one much value kind of coming up garbage that was that one but um

[46:14] Um, well, well, well, I like I like I like the original ones. I like when they're original

[46:19] um

[46:20] You know, dout in with one that you know, I like the original themes. I like it once. There's something that's original

[46:25] Yeah, I like the original themes. So are you looking forward to deeproot knowing that they are going to have a a bunch of original themes and bring a lot of

[46:33] John poppidukes

[46:34] Magic back into the pinball world. Yeah

[46:38] Okay, so you I i i like a guy like you're a collector. I mean you're a buyer and you but you have him out on display for people to play

[46:45] How often do you play your games?

[46:48] Um, when I'm not working on the field uh

[46:51] 15 18 hours a day. I come here at night. I'll pick a game out and I'll play it and so I play my games about

[46:58] three to five times a week

[47:00] So for myself and then um on the weekends we always have the doors open and uh

[47:05] It's fun. I have to see some people come in some don't some were kind of nervous to come in because they think they quite cost

[47:11] And they look outside. They look outside the door. They see this plumbing company. They seem a big plumbing sign up there and they

[47:16] Okay

[47:17] What's going on here? So guys got pinball machines in a plumbing office

[47:22] Are there any local leagues that use your games because I feel like league guys would love to have access to that kind of collection

[47:28] Or you just you don't want like people beating on them like what's your take on stuff like that?

[47:34] Now I don't mind that um actually when we had our first uh

[47:37] When we had our first grand opening we had the kids that were coming in they were just

[47:42] Playing and beating on the uh

[47:45] You know on the uh on the flipper is like a crazy rabbit my wife and my wife was just going

[47:50] She was just like so nervous like you know because the games and that's like hey, it's pinball

[47:54] You know let the kids have fun shown

[47:57] Say you know how to capture the ball and you just take time with them and they learn so and they have fun right um

[48:04] Yep, do you think um

[48:07] How long do you think this is gonna last because we've had a pretty awesome run the last five years

[48:12] All these manufacturers all these games. I mean as a buyer you've you've had a plethora of stuff to choose from

[48:18] Do you think this is gonna keep going this way or what were your thoughts?

[48:23] I think we're at the edge I think we're at the edge you're talking

[48:27] You know

[48:29] $9,000 $10,000 on games $12,000 on games

[48:34] And I'm just throwing this out there, you know

[48:37] uh

[48:38] distributors need to

[48:40] Manufacturers they need to be put on notice they need to be cautious because

[48:45] You know it's uh it's a lot of money people are spending out on these games and the tolerance is gonna be very thin

[48:51] When people uh having issues and they're gonna be like hey, that's enough and to lose a customer

[48:57] Little by little you have the operator as you have the collectors like me

[49:01] But you know I don't think you want to lose anybody, you know

[49:05] I don't think anybody wants to I don't think Jersey Jack or Stern or

[49:09] Spooky they don't want to lose their customers. So you want to keep you want to you want to keep um

[49:15] You want to keep in touch with that but at the same time it's a lot of money to invest

[49:19] But at the same time it's a lot of money to spend these too. I mean to make these games

[49:23] I understand that so when I look at a game that's 12,500 what goes into make that game? That's a lot a lot of labor a lot of parts

[49:31] so

[49:33] Well with higher prices come higher expectations, but I think you're right. I think people are are sort of

[49:38] At the point now where

[49:41] Oh, they don't really want to spend a lot more and and unless the you know the experience and the quality and and to your point earlier

[49:49] The attention to detail has to go up as you you know

[49:53] Raise the prices of these games because you're a car buff. I'm a car buff and you know

[49:57] There's a reason why it's not just about whether or not it's fun because almost every

[50:01] Enthusiasm car is fun

[50:04] You can only really charge more when the details and the materials

[50:09] are upgraded significantly

[50:11] You know in those higher price cars and the same is true with pinball. I believe

[50:16] So we'll see where it goes, you know, I think you're right

[50:18] I think a lot of people are gonna want more but you know, they're asking for more money

[50:22] So it richy 12,500 another game just went up for sale a week or two ago

[50:27] And that was the big Lebowski's got released any desire to own a rare game like that or what are your thoughts on those 40 games

[50:34] Making it making themselves back into the wild

[50:38] Was that 12,500 for that game it was it seems to be like that's the limit ritchie that everyone's like we can't charge more than that or else

[50:45] People will just lose it

[50:49] Wow, I could have sworn I have to check my emails. I could have sworn I got a message from somebody was trying to sell one for 25

[50:56] For no 25 I thought that was a way out there

[50:59] I mean I could have had one of the prototypes of the big Lebowski's and

[51:03] I don't know there was something that was going on that time kind of scared me away from there having a lot of issues

[51:07] But um, but yeah, I mean that's uh, that's that's that was a good game fun game

[51:13] Um, to have something rare like that. I like to have in my collection

[51:17] um

[51:18] Yeah, the controversy being that the games are that are being sold now were bought by other buyers

[51:24] And so this is like the last last ditch effort to sort of get

[51:30] Dutch pin pinball some revenue to restart the company again

[51:34] Do you do you think like these boutiques like dutch and highway pinball

[51:39] You know, we've got enough companies successfully getting getting people games they pay for do you think it's time that

[51:45] All these companies that just can't figure it out just sort of just go away and and just leave pinball to the companies that can actually get it done

[51:54] No, I don't think so if you did you wouldn't have companies like uh, you know, spooky pinball that's doing a great job

[52:01] But they're getting it done though. I mean my point is it's that those if you if you count the amount of successful companies

[52:07] You need to got spooky Chicago gaming stern jersey jack, you know p3

[52:12] Multimorphic and these are just all companies that they haven't

[52:16] They haven't taken people's money and then not sent them a game right

[52:20] But then you also got the skippies we had the highways we had the zidware we had

[52:26] You know the Dutch pinball we had a lot of companies out there

[52:30] Did the opposite they took money they took pre-order dollars and then they never got people their games

[52:36] So we're and some of them are still hanging on and I just

[52:39] Do you think there's there's room for those hanger ons now or that that that was the question

[52:44] No, I don't think so yeah, I think that's I think the uh, I think that time is uh

[52:50] Common gone. I think with that. I know when we were doing it with uh, you know, jersey jack on the first game

[52:56] He had a lot of people that you know believed in him, you know, of course with his uh, you know the name to you know

[53:03] You know his reputation so but um these other companies. I just yeah, I don't think so if you could give George Gomez one piece of advice. What would it be?

[53:14] Um

[53:16] Wow

[53:19] um

[53:21] It could be anything you could be the coin doors whatever you want what do you what your George Gomez do to get you more excited about the next turn release

[53:29] Oh the next turn release um, I mean yeah, and

[53:34] I think someday somebody's going to uh

[53:39] You know and and maybe yeah, maybe they'll put my name on it or something

[53:43] The uh the first company that's going to actually make a a game with a power coating for it to work, you know

[53:50] Um that would be cool

[53:52] Um, but yeah, I just I just think they need um, you know pay attention to some of the details right and um

[54:00] um

[54:01] You know put the best game out there that they can I mean and the uh the license themes and the original games

[54:07] I think it'd be great so um

[54:10] I like to see Stern doing a original theme would be nice, but um we'll see

[54:15] If they do that well, they just did black night to

[54:19] very questionable

[54:21] sales success so yeah, I

[54:26] Yeah, I know how quickly they're going to go back into the original IP

[54:30] I think for them to do original IP stuff they have to just make

[54:33] Then to have it more of like a boutique limited offering and not try to sell at volume because

[54:40] There's just not the audience for it people say they want original games rich and know you said it too

[54:45] And but then you go and make one and then people don't buy it and then you you know

[54:50] You're just better off

[54:51] Connecting to a theme that has an audience and a fan base

[54:55] Yep, I agree with that. I mean, I like to see I like to see if they did original theme

[55:00] They made it maybe like you said like a low production right number

[55:02] I think you'll have your collectors out there that'll make that you know that game be that much special if it's only

[55:07] 150 of them 200 out

[55:09] Um, right, you know, I mean you have to look no further than wizard of os sold three times if not more maybe four times as many games is dialed in

[55:19] Mm-hmm. It's the theme the power of the theme

[55:21] Um, yep, well, we're cheap. I want to thank you for coming on the show uh as I said like you know

[55:26] Hopefully we can chat again, but I said it would just be you know informal and casual little talk about pinball

[55:31] Anything else going on in the pinball world that you sort of want to talk about um

[55:36] What's what's on your mind besides this woolly want to you know clear code issue

[55:42] Yeah, but you're like getting out of the hobby. Do you ever feel like one day you're gonna look around and wake up and be like oh my god

[55:47] I've got like

[55:48] 150,000 dollars maybe more probably in pinball machines and

[55:53] Maybe it's time to get out

[55:57] No, I'm actually I was actually adding it up

[56:00] It's just not too long ago. I think I'm pushing well over 200,000 already just what I got now

[56:06] About 250,000 what I got so far now, but um no, I just

[56:12] No, I don't see nothing um maybe when I retire down the road. I'll keep a few of these just for me

[56:18] and sell the rest to those that you know that wanted but um

[56:23] You know um no, I don't I don't see nothing in the near future is gonna drive me out other than what's going on right now

[56:30] And I'm sure that's going to um

[56:33] I think we got to give Jersey Jack and the other companies. We just gotta give them a chance and

[56:37] I think it'll come down real soon. I really do. I would be surprised if it's not by

[56:41] The end of this coming week or something. I think there's something coming

[56:44] So I hope there is there there has to be I think you're right. I think six months from now

[56:50] This issue is going to be a blip in an overall very positive industry and people will probably just not

[56:57] Not want to buy games that were made during the summer 2019

[57:01] But they're gonna have to solve the problem that it's I was just opening up Jurassic Park pictures today and some of them are just

[57:09] horribly cracking right out of the box and

[57:12] They will they will find the problem. I think it's my guess is richy that it's all coming from

[57:18] One vendor or or maybe it's just the type of clear code that they've been using with the water base

[57:23] But they're gonna have to figure it out and they will there just no way they're gonna keep playing these games crack

[57:29] And I guess my other thing too would be like, you know, what the Willy Wonka game

[57:32] You know when we weren't at first, you know the one thing I'll say real quick here is uh, you know the unveiling

[57:36] That was like, you know

[57:38] Really hyped up and really big and it was it's a great game

[57:42] It plays great, you know, when we were playing it that day and uh, I was actually there had my

[57:47] My CE number 12 sign and I think on one side always said please powder coat my door

[57:53] You know, but um

[57:56] But but at the time I think they were just talking about how you know, we didn't see the uh

[58:01] You saw the CE as far as the different uh, you know the

[58:05] powder coating and stuff like that but you didn't see the playfield and there was talk about how the playfield would just have some

[58:11] Some sprinkles on it or something, but yeah some sparkles some sparkles. Yeah, some sparkles or something

[58:16] So I'm hoping that because we the reason why we've not seen anything is because they went back and they've maybe

[58:26] You know heard some of our concerns, you know, just like it was with Hobbit, you know

[58:31] With the the playfield and the art. So hopefully um, we'll see we'll see if it's maybe they're

[58:37] They went back and there's some there's some nice things coming with that game and like you said they addressed the playfield and

[58:44] I can contact Joe and

[58:46] Give him my money and I'll be in back in on number 12

[58:49] And again, I died. It's nothing. It's nothing against uh, Jersey black person. It's nothing. I just I took a stance and

[58:55] And uh, I haven't even reached out to a jack or anybody over there. I planned on it this week. I was going to

[59:02] Reach make a phone call and reach out to him

[59:04] But I think there's something I just I would be surprised at his not but I think there is something coming in

[59:10] And it'll be great

[59:11] Well, it has to be special you know, I

[59:13] Marketing is my trade and the problem with jack right now is you can't go backwards

[59:19] You did so much awesomeness with the pirates of the Caribbean with the different artwork on the playfield the awesome topper

[59:27] You can't think back yeah, you can't go backwards

[59:30] And I'm not I'm not saying

[59:32] Can't go backwards. You got to make it make that playfield different than the other ones for the collectors additions for the people to justify the cost

[59:39] Absolutely, and you got you got to make it special, you know, I was so bummed on the uh

[59:46] The doubt in the topper, you know, it was something that was brought up and I was like

[59:51] I looked at the top and I was like wait a minute one of these numbers on here for the jumps like I'm looking at these numbers

[59:55] And I questioned it's like wait, these are part numbers

[59:58] And they forgot to take the part numbers off

[01:00:00] No, that's like I don't see another but that's pat larler

[01:00:04] You're gonna see those part numbers on the woolly wanted topper for some reason

[01:00:09] Pat lar things that every single thing needs a partner moron it

[01:00:13] Because that's how they did it in the valley Williams days it looks stupid now don't need that now and everything

[01:00:20] So I mean so again my point I can live with things like that, you know, I can live with things like that

[01:00:25] I can okay, I can live with that um, but the stance I'm taking on this with the uh

[01:00:31] With the willy wanka and again, I'm taking a strong stand on it and uh

[01:00:35] We'll see I think I'll be back in um, you know

[01:00:39] I know the northbound rich you don't go but don't go back in

[01:00:43] We're all gonna be watching what you do. I think for a listener of the show nobody go back in

[01:00:48] Until Richie's back in on this, but Richie you're leading the army now if people waiting for a solution

[01:00:53] So don't don't cave too too soon

[01:00:56] Yeah, it's got it's not just going to be a solution that they fix the problem

[01:00:59] That's one that's one that's number one. Okay, they found the source they fix the problem

[01:01:04] Number two is take care of the customers that have had the problems

[01:01:08] What are you doing take care of those when those two things you're met by it if you saw them not do that like if they didn't

[01:01:14] Take care of the elite guys that have had issues. Would you be sour on jjp and be like, you know what that's wrong. I'm out

[01:01:21] Yes, okay

[01:01:23] So you are you are leading the charge for all of us my friend so people are you see it if Richie

[01:01:28] It's not that's not even a question if they don't take care of the other early owners

[01:01:32] Or even the pirates that are caring me if you if they don't take care of them no matter what I'm out

[01:01:37] I love this stand and I agree with your stance and I think what yours

[01:01:41] What you're saying right now is the ultimate power that the consumers have is

[01:01:46] We all have the power to change these companies and hold them to the fire with our wallets

[01:01:52] Just don't buy it and they will have to

[01:01:55] Do what we demand to go back in as buyers now? It's harder

[01:01:59] It's easier said than done right because people are addicted to buying these games and they just going on everything

[01:02:04] But if Richie wrench I said this if Richie wrench the man who always goes in if he hits pause

[01:02:11] Then that is the biggest reason for concern if I was Jersey jack and they need to they need to listen to what you said on this podcast

[01:02:19] And here's a good news Richie
