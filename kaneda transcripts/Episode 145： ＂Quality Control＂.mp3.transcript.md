[00:00] But if you can't take me here, while I was, you don't just ever leave me, it's not fair.

[00:12] The summer of Canada continues.

[00:22] Episode 145 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:25] I'm just getting back to New York City today.

[00:28] I was in Cape May, New Jersey.

[00:31] Very beautiful town.

[00:32] I want to give a shout out to Robert and his lovely wife Heather for hosting Brenda, myself,

[00:39] her brother, her brother's girlfriend.

[00:42] Amazing, amazing time.

[00:43] Robert, thank you.

[00:44] I know you're listening to the show, so I wanted to give you a shout out.

[00:47] Now, we've got a great episode here.

[00:48] 145 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:51] A lot of news items we're going to go down.

[00:53] We're going to talk about what's happening at Stern Pinball.

[00:56] I think Stern has done something so egregious that I just have to call it out.

[01:03] And part of that's going to dovetail into the main theme of the show, which is quality,

[01:07] control, and pinball machines.

[01:08] But we're also going to talk about Skippy.

[01:10] We're going to talk about JjP.

[01:12] We're going to talk about Alien Pinball.

[01:14] Talk about the fact that there's like a Jetson review that's happened.

[01:17] So let's jump right into it.

[01:19] We're going to get right to the pinball news on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:23] So I want to start out with Skippy on this episode.

[01:27] And there's one area of the whole Skippy lawsuit that just continues to be a head scratcher.

[01:33] And that is where did the $100,000 that Kevin paid virtual pin?

[01:40] Where did it go?

[01:42] So for those of you who don't know the backstory, Kevin paid virtual pins $100,000 to make cabinets

[01:50] for Predator.

[01:52] Now, this whole thing went belly up.

[01:54] And the only amount of cabinets Kevin got was worth $10,000.

[02:01] So there's like $90,000 in money that's unaccounted for.

[02:06] And that is why virtual pins has been listed in the lawsuit with this whole Predator fiasco.

[02:13] And no one knows where the money is.

[02:15] So there's, I think you have to look at this whole thing.

[02:18] But Kevin has $500,000, probably unaccounted for that went to different areas.

[02:25] Will we ever get the money?

[02:27] What will happen?

[02:28] Nobody knows.

[02:29] We know that they're still going back and forth with the judge and Kevin's mom.

[02:33] And this whole thing keeps dragging out on and on and on.

[02:37] But that's like the latest is there's just like no one knows where the money is.

[02:41] Nobody knows.

[02:42] For those of you who are in on a Predator, if you're expecting to get money at the end

[02:46] of this, I don't know.

[02:47] I don't want to go get a metal detector and walk around Kevin's property because I feel

[02:51] like this guy just put them in coffee cans and buried money all over his neighborhood.

[02:56] Because I don't think you're going to see the money anytime soon.

[03:00] Speaking of Predator, did you also see that there was one guy who was also listed on the

[03:07] lawsuit with with Skit B and his name is Tim Fife.

[03:11] Now Tim bought a Predator machine after, after Skit B went belly up.

[03:17] And there was a lot of back and forth because I know Tim went on to Pinside.

[03:21] I believe he set up a duplicate account, pretended to be someone else, tried to defend

[03:25] the actions of Tim Fife.

[03:28] Now just, let's pause there for a minute.

[03:31] Imagine if I did something.

[03:32] Chris.

[03:33] Chris did something.

[03:35] And I, everyone knows I'm Canadian.

[03:37] Imagine if I did something egregious.

[03:40] And then I went on to Pinside and I tried to defend what I did under a different alias.

[03:46] So just imagine how ridiculous that sounds.

[03:52] And so this is what Tim did.

[03:54] And Tim apparently did an under the table deal with Kevin.

[03:58] He's a collector.

[03:59] He knew that these machines would be ultra rare, ultra valuable.

[04:04] And so he got one under the table, fully knowing that people got screwed out of money, fully

[04:09] knowing that Kevin was going to steal people's money.

[04:12] And so he has a Predator in his home.

[04:14] Now if I'm Tim, the last thing I would do is what he just did this past week, which

[04:19] is he uploaded the photo of his collection on Facebook.

[04:24] And it's his cover photo, a row of machines.

[04:26] And someone circled and pointed out that Predator ominously is sitting there in his row of

[04:32] games.

[04:33] And it's so strange to see it there, annoying that he's also involved in a lawsuit about

[04:38] owning this game.

[04:40] And he, look, it's not like the cover, it's not like the only machine he's not calling

[04:43] it out.

[04:45] But how does one feel good about owning a Predator knowing what happened to other people?

[04:50] It's different than Magic Girl.

[04:52] I don't feel bad owning a Magic Girl because everyone who paid for a Magic Girl got a Magic

[04:57] Girl.

[04:58] But nobody who paid for a Predator got a Predator.

[05:01] And so that machine is also listed in the lawsuit because it is an asset that Keith is

[05:08] trying to go after to retrieve.

[05:11] And so people can get some money back in this whole debacle.

[05:14] So really interesting to see that this Predator thing just continues to go on.

[05:18] I mean, what is it?

[05:19] 2017 of July.

[05:21] And we're still talking about Predator and Skip Bee.

[05:24] I can't wait to the day when this thing finally goes away.

[05:29] All right.

[05:30] Number two, for those of you out there who are looking for games, there is a Pinside user

[05:34] named Damon, D-A-M-O-N.

[05:37] He's selling the mother load.

[05:39] I've never seen a guy liquidate a collection like this guy's collection.

[05:43] It's on Pinside.

[05:44] He's got a thread where he's asking for prices.

[05:47] He wants to know what the price is games out.

[05:49] He has about $200,000 worth of pins he's trying to sell.

[05:55] Everything from a big Lebowski to a Batman super early full throttle.

[06:00] He's got Tron.

[06:01] He's got ACDC.

[06:02] He's got every big title you can think of.

[06:05] This guy is selling.

[06:07] Really curious if you know him why he's selling the collection.

[06:11] At first, I'm like, oh man, he's probably getting divorced.

[06:13] This always sounds like a divorce case.

[06:16] That might not be the case, but he's definitely getting out.

[06:20] And when you have that much invested in Pimball and he's got all these mods and the games look

[06:24] beautiful, you have to imagine if he just got burnt out.

[06:28] I'm actually going to reach out to him.

[06:29] I'm going to try and see if he'll come on the show and talk about why he's selling

[06:32] his big collection and what it was like acquiring such an amazing collection and how he feels

[06:38] letting it go.

[06:39] Because there's a lot of money.

[06:41] There's a lot you can do with $200,000.

[06:44] All right.

[06:46] Topic number three I want to talk about on this episode of the Canadian Pimball Podcast

[06:50] before we get into quality control is Jersey Jack Pimball number four.

[06:56] And we've talked before about this topic and there's, it's kind of like one of the worst

[07:01] kept secrets in Pimball is what are the possible themes that are down the line coming from

[07:06] Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:08] And the title that everyone keeps coming to is Pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:13] And what we know so far is nothing.

[07:15] We haven't been confirmed that it's pirates.

[07:17] But typically when we hear a title this many times, when we hear about it, there's a really

[07:24] good chance it's going to happen.

[07:26] And so the sequence or the cadence of games coming from Jersey Jack appears to be Pirates

[07:31] of the Caribbean and then Toy Story.

[07:35] And there may be some games in between there, but I, you know, I haven't heard of anything

[07:38] else other than the Muppets and James Bond and the Beatles.

[07:43] Okay.

[07:44] So my thoughts on this and they kind of reflect what people are saying is Pirates of the Caribbean

[07:50] as a theme right now is really washed up.

[07:54] Right.

[07:55] The pirate ship has hit the rocks.

[07:57] It has taken on water and nobody cares anymore.

[08:00] And the last pirate movie was a humongous flop.

[08:04] And if you're Jack and you signed this deal years ago and you were told by Disney, hey,

[08:10] we got Johnny Depp returning for the final pirates.

[08:13] We're going to put, you know, it's going to be a $300 million blockbuster.

[08:17] This is the title that you're going to want.

[08:20] I, you know, you can't, you can't fault Jack for not feeling like it was going to be a

[08:24] big hit.

[08:25] But here we go all over again.

[08:27] It's Hobbit 2.0 where Jack is investing in a film franchise that didn't really hit.

[08:35] And now he's stuck with this huge franchise.

[08:37] He's stuck with developing a game for a few years and there's nothing he can do other than

[08:42] release it.

[08:44] That's the problem with these pinball companies.

[08:45] They can't go years into R&D and then scrap a title.

[08:50] They don't have the kind of money to do that.

[08:53] Do you know an interesting side story?

[08:56] Disney was working on Reckit Ralph, Fixit Felix Jr. for two years.

[09:02] They were in production on the movie and it was called Fixit Felix Jr.

[09:07] And they had been working on it, storyboarding it, writing it, doing animations.

[09:11] And two years into production, they realized the story was more interesting if they

[09:15] focused on Ralph and Ralph wanting to be good and they changed the whole thing.

[09:20] Because Disney's got billions and they can do that, right?

[09:23] A pinball company, once they go really far into production, they can't switch gears.

[09:27] So imagine if you're Jack and you're whispering in Jack's ear and you're a guy like me and

[09:32] you're a marketer and you're saying, I don't know Jack, all the feedback leads me to believe

[09:37] that if we come out with pirates of the Caribbean, it's not going to be well received.

[09:43] We should bump Toy Story up ahead of it and re-theme whatever's going on with pirates

[09:49] to something else.

[09:50] See, I don't think they can do that.

[09:52] I don't know when Toy Story is going to come out because the movie is not coming out

[09:56] to 2019.

[09:57] That's two years away.

[10:00] Now we know by the cadence of Jack's games that he's looking to get at least two games

[10:05] out around every year and a half.

[10:08] So which would mean that Toy Story would hopefully come out before the new films come out.

[10:14] Now maybe there's a game in between pirates and Toy Story.

[10:16] Who knows?

[10:17] What we know about pirates is this.

[10:19] It's a wide body.

[10:21] I heard there's no ship.

[10:22] So there's no big ship mechanism.

[10:24] I also heard it's going to do really innovative things that we haven't seen in a pinball game

[10:28] before and I know the designer, sorry his name escapes me, he's a new designer, he's young.

[10:34] So we're getting some fresh blood into the pinball design world.

[10:38] So will we see this game at Expo?

[10:41] That's a big question on everyone's mind.

[10:43] I think we should.

[10:44] I think we should all explain why because by the time Expo rolls around, I think dialed

[10:49] in to have been going out in large numbers and they're shipping fine.

[10:54] Production on dialed in is going well.

[10:56] The collector's edition dialed in will be out by then.

[10:59] It's going to be hard to just have dialed in be the highlight for Jersey Jack pinball

[11:05] come October.

[11:06] So Jack is finally getting the cadence to a point where a game can be shipping for six

[11:13] months and then he's got to show something new to get people excited for the next title.

[11:19] If we see pirates during October that is exciting because it does show is that Jersey

[11:25] Jack finally has gotten manufacturing down where he can compete with Stern and he can

[11:31] get titles out.

[11:33] Is there any interest I think in these titles though and that's, that to me that is the

[11:37] albatross for Jersey Jack pinball.

[11:40] It is the the the quagmire that I don't think this company can get past with all of the

[11:46] amazing themes to pick from even if he just goes back into the 80s and early 90s catalogs

[11:52] of titles and themes.

[11:54] Looking at the success of Ghostbusters why Jack is considering the muppets why he's

[12:00] considering the beetles why he's considering James Bond I think those are horrible titles

[12:07] for pinball I really do.

[12:09] I think if you look at the pinball demographic and even if you want to get kids in the pinball

[12:14] I think there are so many better franchises to go after.

[12:18] Let me name a few.

[12:19] Let me name a few of I was Jersey Jack and I said Jack here's what you should make a pinball

[12:22] machine based on.

[12:24] I say Jack you should make a pinball machine based on the 18.

[12:29] Jack you should make a pinball machine based on the goonies.

[12:33] Jack you should make a pinball machine based on Blade Runner.

[12:38] Jack you should make a pinball machine that is based on let's see the big trouble little

[12:44] China.

[12:45] You should do a pinball machine that's based on Transformers the movie the G1 original

[12:49] movie.

[12:50] I believe it's the 2017 is the 30th anniversary of that movie how great would it have been

[12:59] if he had a 30th anniversary Transformers Generation 1 pinball machine with songs like

[13:04] you got the touch and dare right and nothing's going to stand in our way big unicorn toy.

[13:11] You know hold up the matrix and open it up.

[13:15] We are allies now against a common flow the callouts from that game alone it's over.

[13:20] Never.

[13:21] Like it would have been incredible.

[13:24] Alright not happening didn't happen.

[13:27] So that's my problem that's my problem is I look at pinball and I look at this box

[13:31] of blinking lights and this world under glass and I can't stop myself from imagining the

[13:36] possibilities and that is what has me so frustrated with Star Wars and what we're getting today

[13:42] is I think the bars been lowered so much in terms of what we expect from pinball that

[13:48] people have lost the ability to imagine and dream and even look at culturally what do

[13:52] people want stop making the game you want to make and make the game that people want

[14:00] and the best marketers understand how to do both right get get things that the that excite

[14:06] the designers and the company employees and also get things that excite your buyers.

[14:12] Alright so that's Jersey Jack number 4 we're going to see I mean I I fully expect we're

[14:16] going to see something with pirates in October if that's the case.

[14:21] Alright let's go to alien pinball and highway pinball the latest here is that not all refunds

[14:27] have been processed yet and I'm still confused as to why it's taking so long we've heard

[14:33] from some people that they have their money they've they received their refund from highway

[14:37] and we congratulated highways new management undoing that and giving people their money

[14:41] back.

[14:42] Now why is it delayed for some people and not others I still think this company is trying

[14:49] to do a little bit of of juggling act they're trying to juggle manufacturing the new games

[14:56] and getting them out the door to hopefully keep some of these people who are asking for

[15:01] refunds to say you know what I see your shipping games and I don't really need my money

[15:06] I'll stay in with you guys and I think they're trying to juggle it and you know here's the

[15:11] thing with with manufacturing in these guys they finally have shipped some games again

[15:17] and not a lot of hoopla I'll tell you why because they only sent four games to coin taker

[15:23] 4 4 you can count the amount on one hand that they got out the door now what continues

[15:31] to be sort of strange is why are only four games going out is is this just another beta

[15:39] run of games or is this the final production line is in place or are these the leftover

[15:45] games that Andrew had lying around that just needed a few new mechanisms and and that's

[15:51] what went out it's unclear I don't know but I still think that we're a couple months away

[15:59] before real production ramps up on this game and I've said it before and I'll say it again

[16:06] by the time these guys get their act together how old does alien pinball feel right now

[16:12] I feel like this game it's just been out already it's been discussed it's been talked

[16:18] about we've seen it for for years and it's finally going to trickle out after this bail

[16:25] out but I still think highway pinball is not going to survive they're not going to

[16:31] get to future games this isn't going to be a moment where once this game starts shipping

[16:38] people are going to start to run towards highway pinball and buy the game and that's going

[16:43] to give them enough money and capital to to do the following games three and four see that's

[16:49] the thing that people yeah these guys are in this for pride and pride alone their egos

[16:55] were bruised Andrew sold them a bag of goods that wasn't real and they're doing this

[17:00] just to save face but we all know that is not just about making true on your promise to

[17:08] give people what they already paid for to run a successful pinball company you need to

[17:15] sell a couple thousand of these machines right so a couple thousand aliens have to sell

[17:21] and then you need to be arending your next title and working on it and they're not so

[17:30] the amount of time it would take to then get to game three by that time by that time you're

[17:38] going to have Jersey jacks next game out you're going to have guardians of the galaxy you're

[17:42] going to have Deadpool you're going to have attack from Mars remakes shipping you're going

[17:47] to have dialed in available you're going to have home pin you're going to have spooky

[17:51] Dallas Cooper you're going to have total nuclear annihilation you're going to have P3 you

[17:57] might even have pinball circus the list keeps going what else there's probably some more

[18:02] games coming out we know Aaron at fast pinballs working on a game you see what I'm saying

[18:06] is that you start to go down the list of all the things that will be available for you

[18:12] to buy and that's just like new inbox games that's not even considering maybe I'll just

[18:16] go get now that it's really cheap the the library of hundreds of games that are already

[18:24] proven to be great I can go spend my money on versus highway pinball see I think highway's

[18:31] problem is simple and I think the solution to me would be to scrap all of the bad business

[18:37] decisions that Andrew highway did and start over the cabinets look like shit the back box

[18:43] looks like shit the game is not as cool as it could be he changed too much and that change

[18:51] made it financially harder to stay in business and the manufacturer I think the way pinball

[18:58] cabinets look the traditional look is great you don't really need to change it and if you're

[19:03] gonna change it change it the way John pop it you changed it the Zidware cabinets look

[19:08] even better stupid John though how to get the patent for the screen and the back area of the

[19:14] game which is actually the best place for the screen but now no one else can do it because he's

[19:18] got a patent filed on it isn't that crazy you can't put the screen there in any pinball machine

[19:23] because John pop a Duke filed a patent and he's never gonna make another game ever and okay but

[19:30] anyway what I'm saying is this Andrew highway made all these changes to pinball that ended up

[19:35] being failures the fact that highway pinball is locked into wide body games is a failure the fact

[19:42] that his modular system isn't modular because you can't swap in the games because they're not

[19:48] compatible is a failure and so all of these new guys are doing is their final they're finalizing

[19:55] and they're putting the end chapter on Andrew's failures right this isn't a new chapter in highway

[20:02] pinball this is the conclusion of of of a four or five year journey of lies and false promises

[20:10] and all that stuff so if I were these guys after getting alien out to the whatever amount of

[20:16] people who still want one I would say look the company is no longer called highway pinball for

[20:22] obvious reasons and I would completely throw out the playbook that Andrew handed them and I would

[20:29] start over and that's my advice for them will they do it will work will they want to do it why I

[20:35] don't think these guys want to do it if they were smart if I were these guys here's what I would do

[20:40] if I was these new investors I would call up Barry and Yop and be like hey guys you've got to

[20:46] hit on your hands and no way to manufacture it we're building manufacturing capabilities without a

[20:53] real hit why don't we have lunch and figure this shit out all right let's move on so speaking of

[21:01] Barry and Yop Yop put up his Friday update it's a video where they're sort of doing their news

[21:09] updates and we said every week we're gonna keep you posted you know look I watched it I just

[21:15] couldn't stop laughing I was like oh my god okay so for you guys you think you're gonna get your

[21:19] big Lebowski pinball sometime in 2017 just listen to this statement and let me know if this makes

[21:26] you feel confident that you're gonna get your big Lebowski sometime before you die so just so

[21:32] check this out I also want to thank my new our new contract manufacturer they believe in us they

[21:40] believe in the pinball market the pinball industry they are very good in building

[21:49] uh electro mechanical stuff such as feeders for high-end mailing machines a folding

[22:00] insertor is an electro mechanical machine that goes paper goes into the machine it's folded it

[22:08] goes into the envelope and in fact a pinball machine has a lot of resemblance with that because

[22:14] you you talk about um mechanical you talk about coils metal and and and these guys made made feeders

[22:28] for big companies huge companies worldwide yep a pinball machine and a mail-sword or man those two

[22:35] things though they're so similar you put some paper folded up put it in an envelope that's

[22:41] just like making a pinball machine they got it you guys have nothing to worry about seriously

[22:46] guys you're gonna get your machines mail-sworder pinball machine what do you worry about

[22:51] sleep like a baby tonight they've got it figured out come October they're gonna reveal zero

[22:57] series big Lebowski it's you know maybe the thing will even mail-sort and give you the receipt

[23:03] for three years of pain medications and anti-depressants that you've had have been dealing with because

[23:09] you gave them your money all right big Lebowski it's gonna happen you heard it here first

[23:14] I don't I don't need anything else you don't need to convince me of anything else all right

[23:19] so rounding out our little news items here and this this just goes to show how low people's expectations

[23:28] have become with pinball and there's one game that I think we all can agree universally is probably

[23:35] the most barren pinball machine of all time it's probably the game that has absolutely nothing in it

[23:43] and it's not the company's fault who made it because someone else designed it

[23:48] and it's made to be really simple and barren because it's made for kids even though the theme

[23:53] makes no sense because no kids are into this theme and that is the Jetsons pinball by spooky now

[24:00] a gentleman bought this game and he put it up on pinside his review of the Jetsons and

[24:06] it's pinside user back flipper and I think this just goes to show how low people's expectations

[24:13] of pinball are now look as a theme the Jetsons I love the Jetsons I love the Flintstones I love

[24:20] the Hannerbar Barra stuff you could do a lot with the Jetsons in terms of bringing that world to

[24:26] life under glass and none of it really is happening in the game and yet the game is I believe $6,000

[24:33] $6,500 and so it's not cheap but I just want to read what he says when he reviews this game which by

[24:39] the way he gives it in 8.5 out of 10 okay let me let me just repeat that the Jetsons probably the

[24:47] most barren game of all time is in 8.5 and this guy gets 17 upvotes and no downvotes 8.5 Jetsons

[24:59] think about that let that sink in in a world where the Jetsons gets an 8.5 what is at a 10

[25:07] what does Game of Thrones get what is Tron get 15 at a 10 I mean unbelievable but here's the part

[25:14] that I just when I read it I was just like you got to be kidding me um he wrote where it says

[25:21] toys and gimmicks he says the game hits a home run here in innovation a home run Jetsons in

[25:30] innovation really I am serious what the play field lacks in innovative toys is more than made up for

[25:38] with the innovative and interactive topper okay a fucking topper makes up for the fact that there's

[25:46] nothing on this play field he then writes or maybe multi balls achieved by cranking the right

[25:52] spinner shot over and over the topper has a hand like a clock that moves from pointing left to

[25:58] right as the spinner is hit when the hand moves all the way to the right the character and

[26:04] multi ball are started this was the most commented on feature during my league night the rest is

[26:11] targets scoops pop bumpers and a ramp most games are lucky to get one innovative feature like the toy

[26:17] box on erosmith this one is very cool all right so there there you go all you gotta do is put a

[26:25] topper that moves so here's the thing I do think that innovative toppers are an area of real estate

[26:32] that designers don't utilize well enough you can have toppers become part of the experience and

[26:38] I do agree that people watching pinball would love to see toppers do cool things so that there's

[26:44] that but you've got to be kidding me that the Jetsons has innovation that the Jetsons topper

[26:54] makes up for the fact that the play field looks like a pinball machine that I could find at toys

[27:00] are us you know that this is what's killing me about this hobby is that these people are just

[27:06] justifying what they're buying now sixty five hundred dollars six thousand dollars for the Jetsons

[27:12] and that's what you get how much is a Simpsons pinball party used how much is a family guy

[27:19] how much is a Lord the Rings regular and you want to say that the Jetsons is worth it

[27:27] okay I'll stop there I can't talk about the Jetsons too much

[27:30] all right before I go into you know I want to go into the quality topic I want to discuss on this

[27:36] episode and then I'll read some user feedback because I've been getting a lot about Star Wars

[27:41] you guys out there some of you love it some of you hated some of you say thank you Chris

[27:45] for being honest about the cash grab that is Star Wars but let me go into quality control real quick

[27:51] and I don't want to belabor this but I have some notes on this so here's what happened

[27:56] somebody posted a picture of Star Wars pinball that had ghosted inserts and the big inserts I

[28:03] think it was like the end or one it had a really big ghosting line up here below it and there's

[28:09] a couple different parts of the game that we're ghosting now what happens when you upload a picture

[28:15] of a new-sturm pinball machine with any issue especially a ghosted playfield people will lose

[28:22] their shit because the pain of ghost busters the pain of of cutting corners and and for some reason

[28:31] the most recent stern machines have had ghosting issues people are panicking right it only takes

[28:36] one example to make people sort of lose their shit and worry that their game's going to have ghosting

[28:42] now what I want to do is I want to talk about quality control and I want to talk about Stern's

[28:46] quality control and jerseys jacks and I want to I want to break it down a little bit because I

[28:52] think sometimes people get out of control and overreact the quality issues but then I also think

[28:58] there's moments where these manufacturers do things that really show they don't care right so

[29:05] I'm torn on this because I've interviewed people at Stern I have a lot of friends at Stern and

[29:10] I hear them say we care we care we care okay so but but that's the issue with companies is that

[29:17] your quality control and your reputation it's only as good as the last customer service experience

[29:24] you do because if you completely fuck someone over and they go on to a forum and articulate how

[29:31] they were fucked over or if you do something that clearly is disingenuous and egregious your

[29:37] company did it so your company's reputation will take a day so the way I want to look at it is this

[29:42] when it comes to quality control I think everyone has to ask the following questions

[29:48] for what we're paying what is acceptable to us in terms of what we get when we open up a new

[29:55] in box pinball machine now for some people they want the game to be perfect right every switch needs

[30:00] to be working every cable should be plugged in there shouldn't be any scratches there shouldn't

[30:06] be any dents any dings any ghosting anything so for some of you out there you pay nine grand you

[30:11] pay eight grand no matter what you pay it's new you're so used to every other item you buy when

[30:16] it's new being pretty mint so you don't want to have to you don't want to have to do anything you

[30:20] don't want to have to make adjustments but the reality is this if you're buying pinball you can expect

[30:28] there to be absolutely nothing you might have to tinker with it's it's a big heavy device with

[30:33] lots of cables and lots of things that can shake when shipping so here's here's here's the other

[30:38] question I have a couple more is someone looking over your pin before putting into box so the question

[30:45] I have always is at these companies is there really quality control happening is there someone that's

[30:50] supposed to test and look over each pin before it goes in a box and yank that pin from going into a

[30:58] box if they find something that shouldn't go to a customer and that's a question that I have for

[31:04] all the manufacturers out there is what is the final stage that they that they do before they put

[31:10] a game in box now my hunch tells me this a lot of stuff makes it through into a box and into a

[31:17] customer's home that should never have been passed it's never got in the seal of approval

[31:23] and I think it's laziness and I think it's trying to save money because each each profit

[31:30] for each machine diminishes when you have to reduce something and pull something off the line

[31:35] okay so but when it comes to quality I think it comes down to three things these are the three

[31:40] things that that that I was thinking about number one things that happen during manufacturing right so

[31:47] there's a quality issue of things that occur to a game when it's being built and I think anything

[31:54] that happens to a game while it's being manufactured if it if something happens that there's no way

[32:02] that a manufacturing default or issue should ever be passed on to a customer so whenever people get a

[32:08] game new in box and there's like a scratch or there's you know the playfields already shipped

[32:16] or there's a big dent underneath it or there's you know I'm trying to think other issues that

[32:22] happen in manufacturing I just saw one the guys it was on is dialed in the the side of the inside

[32:28] of the cabinet was all scratched up and and that's how it came when he opened it like that's

[32:33] inexcusable getting a stern pinball machine and the decals are already wrinkled is inexcusable

[32:38] right those things happen during manufacturing the number two thing is things that happen during

[32:43] play see this is the hard part so that's your dimples your chip playfield your ghosted inserts

[32:51] how do you deal with issues when it comes to quality that don't that don't don't present themselves

[32:57] to the manufacturer they can't catch these things because they haven't happened yet and then the

[33:02] third thing is just long-term reliability all right so my point is this when it comes to quality

[33:07] control and stern and jersey jack and spooky and whatnot all of these manufacturers struggle with

[33:13] this topic because pinball machines will have issues pinball machines are not all going to be perfect

[33:19] when it comes to clear coding machines there might be a hundred great games and then there might

[33:25] be five bad ones and and what do you do and that's the problem I mean imagine if you were trying to

[33:32] have a hundred percent consistency with a product you're never going to get it and then you also

[33:37] have to deal with the fact that these things aren't going to the places they were originally intended

[33:44] to go which was out in the arcade which no one gave a shit if the Adam's family are medieval madness

[33:50] or twilight zone or any of the any of the rowdy games if they had a little issue nobody cared

[33:57] but now all of a sudden you've got the majority of your buyers

[34:01] looking over these things with with with a magnifying glass

[34:04] losing their shit if something happens so I want to just give some examples of things that have

[34:10] happened that I think manufacturers should be ashamed of and they should be blamed for these

[34:17] following quality control issues that show me that as much as they want to convince us they care

[34:24] there are times where these manufacturers have made mistakes and those mistakes really have me

[34:32] questioning whether or not the quality control in all of these companies reflects the amount of

[34:39] money we are now spending on these games and maybe all these companies need to make one higher

[34:43] and that person's job is to simply go over each game before it goes in a box with with white

[34:49] club service and if you see something that you know a collector and someone who cares a lot about

[34:54] their game would point out then you need to pull the game and that's that person I'm not sure

[35:00] exists so let's go down a list so remember when Ghostbusters was shipping with different

[35:05] lolly pop rails how do you how do you fuck that up so clearly someone uh knows the part numbers to

[35:15] ordered for the game and you're making 500 green machines how do you paint the wrong

[35:24] lolly pop rails green I don't get that and then how do you not notice that because it was notice

[35:31] right away by by owners but that one maybe I'll give him a little bit of a pass because it's not

[35:37] the easiest thing to spot because they're on opposite sides of the machine all right but here's

[35:42] this one this this is a new one stern shipping star wars to people with no SD cards in it no SD

[35:49] cards which means your star wars pro arrives and you can't play it because the game's not even in it

[35:55] how the fuck does that happen like how does that happen which means no one ever turned that machine on

[36:02] and put it through a final play and and so what does that mean that these games were built

[36:09] and and then never test it is that is that what that means so I don't I don't and how frustrating is it

[36:17] that your game arrives you've been waiting for it you paid for it it arrives and you can't use it

[36:23] because of the tiny little cheap part that they just didn't put in so when I saw that I'm like

[36:30] oh my god like that's an excuseable there's no excuse for that um let's okay so I

[36:38] talked about the dial then the cabinet being scratched that's an excuse well you know come on you

[36:43] got to catch that stuff here's the worst one and this is the one that when I saw this and I saw

[36:49] that they did this and and look I know I've been sort of questioning some of what Stern's been

[36:55] doing lately but this one to me this is a stop the press are you fucking kidding me someone should

[37:02] be fired for doing this because this just goes to show a level of laziness a level of cutting

[37:11] corners and a level of cheapness that I just can't believe I can't believe this when I saw it so

[37:18] here's what happened someone got a brand new Ghostbusters pro they received it they ordered it

[37:27] I believe in May or June and it maybe even July I think it had a July build date Ghostbusters pro

[37:35] and I think it was going over to Germany I don't have the exact details they don't matter

[37:39] he opens up his machine brand new just bought it completely confident that all the issues that

[37:46] played Ghostbusters from last year had been fixed he'd you know and what does he see he sees ghost

[37:55] inserts in his game right away okay and what happens he checks the build date of his playfield and

[38:04] you know what he finds that he has one of the original playfields that Stern knew had issues

[38:13] he gets a playfield with negative reinforcement spelled wrong which was from the first batch

[38:20] of playfields that were fucked up so what did Stern do they built a brand new Ghostbusters machine

[38:28] using old playfields that should have been thrown away now how do you forgive such an error like

[38:38] that and see when I saw that it's just indicative of where we are right now I mean how do you do that

[38:48] Stern my friends over there you know me you were friends on Facebook guys Jared and the crew over

[38:55] there how do you not throw out all of the playfields that were made during the problematic error

[39:07] you didn't not only that you you tried to like pull a fast one on someone and send it to them

[39:17] and it's almost like Stern is operating in a world where the internet doesn't exist where the

[39:22] forums don't exist where people can't share these stories like and I totally I totally feel like

[39:30] they're like oh well this one's going over to Germany no one's gonna give a shit you know

[39:34] hopefully it's just going some guides pro it's it's it's almost a year and a half since Ghostbusters

[39:39] came out I bet he's not a big pinball fan he won't even notice just put it in and we'll save

[39:44] us money and look where we are now I'm talking about it on my podcast a thousand people are going

[39:51] to be aware now Stern that you tried to cut a corner that you never should have cut and it really

[39:57] see the problem is this when these stories come out this defines your company this defines

[40:05] your credibility and and this makes people not excited to support you and I see guys like ice man

[40:14] on Pinside and these other Stern guys that just constantly make excuse after excuse after excuse for

[40:21] stuff like this happening but at the end of the day I'm willing to forgive Stern for so much and

[40:27] I and I get it they're the they're 90% of the market they have such volume mistakes are going to

[40:32] happen and I I will forgive mistakes for happening but this can't be a mistake how these games how

[40:40] these playfields were not discarded is beyond me and and I think this guy deserves an apology if I

[40:49] was Stern I would say you know what give the game back to distributor we're super sorry we're

[40:55] actually going to give you a premium for the for the problem and for such an egregious error

[41:02] and so it look that that's that's it I mean at the end of the day I think these companies sometimes

[41:10] don't care as much as you think they do about getting you the game exactly the way you want it now

[41:15] the other part of quality I want to talk about is while you why you play a game and the

[41:19] wear and tear pinball machine takes and here's the other part I can understand for the life of me

[41:23] we've seen lots of stories recently of Jersey Jack's dialed in having some quality control issues

[41:29] with the playfield primarily the scoop area and playfields are starting to wear there some people

[41:36] have had games chip and when the games chip it's frustrating because some of the artwork goes

[41:42] goodbye when the game chips and it's not an easy fix and and sometimes the chip is so big that even

[41:49] after you put a playfield protector there you can still see the chip area now look it's no big deal

[41:54] none of this stuff ever really affects gameplay but we know what it does it affects the peace of

[41:59] mind of collectors who want perfect machines so for the life of me I can't understand why Jersey Jack

[42:06] doesn't include in a game that costs this much money a simple part like a cliffy a 10 the $20 part

[42:15] that is already installed wherever there's a scoop why isn't that already there I think jack's

[42:21] approach with dialed in is just to stick mylar everywhere it's almost like Oprah Winfrey you'll

[42:27] get some mylar and you get some mylar and you get some mylar they're just like mylar in the whole

[42:32] goddamn game I'm not sure that's the right way to go about it but it's better than nothing but I

[42:38] think all games it's 2017 wherever there's a scoop there should be a cliffy it's just that simple

[42:45] wherever there's a shooter lane put some damn mylar down wherever there's a place where the ball

[42:52] drops consistently onto the playfield put some mylar down we shouldn't have to do this after the fact

[42:59] okay you know I saw the Jersey Jack rubbers are pretty shitty on dialed in I heard the same thing

[43:05] from Hobbit that people are having issues with the rubbers and the machines prematurely wearing

[43:10] and cracking and breaking down that's a big problem nobody wants to have to change out the rubber

[43:17] on their game and these are things these are the quality control issues that these manufacturers time

[43:23] and time again can't seem to figure out everyone needs to realize it's collectors buying these

[43:29] machines at these prices and they don't want to have so many issues the last point I'll make is if

[43:37] you have an issue you know give the company a chance to fix it first don't don't run to

[43:42] pin-side and scream at Sunday night and like my rubber cracked on dialed in and like what a piece of

[43:47] shit you know it's that's the tendency is to get the mom going but at the end of the day both

[43:54] stern and I'll say this in their defense both stern and Jersey Jack and spooky you know all these

[44:00] companies for the most part they've been really good at helping out people who do you have issues

[44:06] I know sometimes we we get down and out when there's there's an error in manufacturing and they

[44:13] pass it on to us but there's pressure there's a lot of pressure to stay in business for these

[44:19] companies and I try to see both sides of the coin one being you know these companies don't make as

[44:26] much money as people think I think sometimes people are like well stern's making millions this

[44:30] it's really hard I was just at the boardwalk and I was I just I went in and out of tons of

[44:37] our cades this weekend nobody there's like one pinball machine at wildwood in New Jersey

[44:43] everyone's making money off claw games everyone's making money off of redemption games your

[44:48] your precious pinball is dead on location where our cades are it's it and we pump so much money

[44:56] into claw machines and one nothing way more and way faster than pinball so these companies are

[45:02] still struggling as much as everyone likes to think that these companies are just swimming in the

[45:06] cash and they're making millions they don't get it they don't get how much it is to first turn to

[45:11] have all those employees and all that overhead and all the factory and all the parts and all the

[45:16] things that have to be ordered all the things that have to go right to get the line moving the years

[45:22] are not as profitable profitable as you think and that pressure sometimes leads these companies to

[45:28] cut corners and to send things out to customers that shouldn't go out to customers all right let's

[45:34] some let's not talk about Star Wars if you guys are in it in on it I'm happy enjoy your Star Wars

[45:40] pinball machine I won't be in on it I want to read some some listener feedback to the show because

[45:46] I've gotten some people who who just felt compelled to reach out to canada and then I appreciate it

[45:51] so for you guys who want to give me your point of view on anything that I discuss it's canada pinball

[45:58] at gmail dot com so let me go back and see the latest so I don't think I I'll see bill dot bill road

[46:10] I really like your synopsis and why do people leave pinball about pinside I've talked to new people

[46:16] on the hobby and one piece of advice I give them is go to pinside to search for tech help and

[46:21] troubleshooting go to pinside to buy and sell and research pricing outside of that stay off of it

[46:28] like you I had a Star Wars pre-ordered with jj for an le and when I saw the release I bailed on it

[46:35] and jj was awesome I finally got to play the pro and I couldn't agree with you more meh in fact

[46:42] people are always bagging on it but I can say that my dad at e Star Wars with upgraded sound

[46:48] does a far better job of bringing the Star Wars universe to life under glass it is admittedly a

[46:54] repetitive game a b layout and not deep rule set but with remastered callouts and audio it does

[47:01] put me in the movie emotionally well bill thank you for reaching out and look I I do I do agree that

[47:11] this isn't the Star Wars we all want it I've said it a million times I also agree that pinside

[47:17] isn't isn't really the place to go to get too involved all the time a pinside in moderation is an okay

[47:26] thing all right let's see I got in a note from Jason Jason I want to thank you for listening to

[47:33] Kennedy's pinball podcast Jason Rochana I just want to email you and let you know you were spot on

[47:38] regarding the lack of immersion on Star Wars I was planning on ordering Star Wars premium until I

[47:43] spent some time on Star Wars pro and dialed in I understand it's hard to compare pro model versus

[47:49] dialed in but Star Wars just didn't do anything for me I love Star Wars and the shots were fun but

[47:54] anytime you enter the mode you didn't feel like you were in the mode take for instance the rank

[47:59] core mode the only thing that even remotely lets you know you are fighting the rank core is the LCD

[48:05] but if you are able to look up at the LCD you see the cockpit of an X-wing it only shows a brief

[48:12] clip of the rank or if you make a shot on the play field you are just looking at colorful arrows

[48:18] I used to say I wouldn't pay 8k for pinball machine but if I'm going to spend 7k for a stern premium

[48:24] that is bare then paying 8000 for dialed in is a bargain you mention you are in on dialed in

[48:31] do you have a J.J.P distributor that you prefer Jason well Jason thank you for the note

[48:36] really hard to compare Star Wars pro to dialed in it's not fair you have to compare Star Wars premium

[48:43] and Star Wars led dialed in that that is more where the game both games are fully featured I'm still

[48:49] shocked that people are buying Star Wars pro I think the game is barren I think Stern made the pro

[48:53] for operators it's an operators dream it's Star Wars is nothing in the game nothing really to break

[48:57] perfect game for an operator you can make more money off of that than a Star Wars led on location

[49:02] I look forward to seeing the premium and the early being played I think people will enjoy it a lot

[49:07] more the hybrid drive has to be cool I'm not an idiot the game looks the game is built around that

[49:12] you take it out the game's barren it doesn't have that much I think it will add a lot I think

[49:18] seeing those balls flying around the hybrid drive will add a lot I think having the ramp pop up

[49:22] that goes into the Death Star will add a lot to the game the game right now we get sort of like

[49:28] 60% of what the game will be so bailing on Star Wars premium or early I think now is silly as well

[49:37] I build on Star Wars Ellie solely because I only have room for one and it was it was a toss up

[49:43] between Star Wars and dialed in I just can't imagine passing on dialed in for Star Wars just seeing

[49:50] what you get in both games and again I'm a guy who likes a world under glass I don't need a

[49:55] bunch of LCD screens making me trying to get me immersed I want the the physical game to do it

[50:02] all right let's see who else so someone hit me up and they they I'm trying to find who it was

[50:11] but someone basically told me that virtual reality is just a trendy thing and it's not going to

[50:18] kill pinball and I don't know what I'm talking about and it's just like it's like 3d tvs and it's

[50:23] not going to catch on if you think that virtual reality is like 3d tvs and it's just a flash in the

[50:29] pan and it's not going to be what people do in the future you're you're dead wrong I also work for

[50:36] a company called Magic League I can't talk a lot about what they're working on but Google

[50:42] Magic League it's augmented reality glasses are coming out wearable tech wearable tech is the future

[50:50] there's no way around it and if you go and see what is happening in the VR world now and you just

[50:58] if you have any imagination for what you you know will be coming VR is the future of movies it's

[51:06] the future of gaming it's the future of home entertainment I'm saddened by a world where

[51:12] everyone's wearing wearable technology I think we are heading to the ready player one world if

[51:17] you haven't read ready player one there's a new trailer that that just came out but the bottom

[51:22] line is is is most people's lives are fucking boring they're mundane they're uninteresting you're

[51:28] going to be able to put on a headset and become a Jedi if you think playing Star Wars pinball is

[51:34] fun and immersive try putting on a VR headset and you will feel like you are in the cockpit of an

[51:42] X-wing going through beggars canyon you'll feel like you're you're approaching the death star you

[51:47] will feel like you're in the movies you'll be holding a totem and it'll be like a lightsaber

[51:53] in your hand and you'll be having a battle with the emperor and Darth Vader as if it's really

[51:58] happening you want you really think that kids growing up today when they want to get immersed

[52:05] in their favorite franchises and their favorite cartoons and their favorite movies are going to

[52:10] want to flip a pinball machine like this is not anti pinball but I just think that people are really

[52:18] holding on to something that they think is going to be around for a lot longer than it is if

[52:24] if I had a guess how much longer these pinball companies have I'd say 10 years max max because

[52:35] it's just gonna shift the shift is gonna happen and even the most cynical even the most sort of

[52:43] stubborn of you out there are gonna have a hard time denying when things become photo realistic

[52:50] VR that you will be able to look down as if you're playing a pinball machine and it'll you'll be

[52:57] able to feel it the sense this again I'm talking in the future you'll be you'll have gloves on

[53:02] where the sensation of hitting of the cabinet and the button and feeling the machine rattle and

[53:08] shake will feel as if you're there I'm like I'm not saying I want to live in that world I don't want

[53:12] to live in an automated virtual reality world where we don't even drive our cars we don't even

[53:18] cook our meals we don't even have to go to work it's the future is going to be pretty fucking shitty

[53:26] we're in the last good error where we can still go by V8 cars that burn rubber and and play pinball

[53:33] machines and and and still like physically do stuff but it's all gonna go virtual it just is um

[53:40] all right what else is there I think that's I think that's kind of wrapping up this has been a

[53:44] sort of my return from my vacation podcast made up for some lost time if you have anything hit

[53:50] me up a canate of pinball at gmail dot com uh the last note I'll make is this enjoy whatever

[53:58] machine you buy I know that I've been like poo pooing star wars it's not the game for me if it's

[54:03] the game for you cool enjoy it all right I think the games are getting a little complex I do I

[54:09] don't understand why uh but I know who the target is for the complexity of these new games and it's

[54:15] just not me I think you can make a game deep and still be fun and still be accessible I think

[54:23] there's a lack of dreaming that is going on in this hobby I think a lot of the designers that have

[54:29] been around forever are too old and they're just used to doing things a certain way and until

[54:36] new blood comes into this hobby I think we're gonna see a lot of rinse and repeat ideas it's a

[54:43] metal ball it's a it's a piece of wood it's ramps it's magnets it's upper playfield it's lower

[54:52] playfield it's back box it's toppers every single thing that is on a game has the ability to be

[54:59] made special every single piece of real estate on a game can do something interesting with the ball

[55:06] it doesn't always have to be the same and sure it might cost a lot of money to put a lot of

[55:12] stuff into a game but if you look down at a wizard of Oz and a dialed in and you say that's $9,000

[55:20] and then you look down at a Star Wars Ellie and say that's $9,000 how can you say that these games

[55:28] are both worth the same amount of money and then you get into that area of like well fun if it's

[55:33] more fun that's cool a Mazda Miata is probably the most fun you can have in a car without a doubt

[55:40] I've owned many many cars my family's a bunch of car fanatics without a doubt the most enjoyable

[55:46] and the most fun experience I've had in a car isn't a Mazda Miata not being said that being said

[55:53] and if a Mazda Miata were $100,000 because it was really fun even though there wasn't much in it

[55:58] nobody would buy it and that's my big issue with where pinball is going these days

[56:03] the stern is stripping stuff out they're removing items they are not dreaming and adding the

[56:11] innovation to these games that there could be considering it's 2017 I shouldn't look down at a

[56:16] Zen pinball game and see more amazing stuff going on when they couldn't physically put more of that

[56:22] stuff in the real game and for the price they're charging now I just think we all should be demanding

[56:27] a lot more not just in terms of the world under glass but we should be demanding a lot more quality

[56:33] control we should be demanding stuff like a $9,000 star wars has rad cows on it it has that beautiful

[56:43] Batman SLE decal that you just invented stern now give it to us in your premium versions of the

[56:50] games don't remove shakers don't remove mirrored back glasses and then charge us more money that's

[56:57] my big issue and the fact that people are going on a pin-side defending it saying how great it is

[57:03] that's cool because what's the saying a fool and their money and that's when I see people saying

[57:09] Jetsons an 8.5 out of 10 there's just a lot of fools out there that are accepting the bare

[57:17] minimum of what pinball can be and for all those people who are really on the bandwagon drinking

[57:24] the cool aid just go back spend a day flipping Adams family mid evil madness twilight zone

[57:34] Simpsons pinball party theater of magic spend a day flipping those great games and remember

[57:42] circus full tear remember those games are $2,000 there's no reason why a $9,000 game should feel

[57:54] twice as complete as a game that costs a third the price i'll leave you on that note have a great

[58:01] week we'll talk to you soon i'm gonna get some interviews i know this has been so much

[58:05] canada p o v it's not my fault people are hard to track down but we'll get some soon i promise

[58:11] and you can take that to the bank canada out
