[00:00] Hey, someone's coming. I think it's Canada. No, it's the clowns.

[00:14] Okay, here we are. Episode 14 of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I can't believe we've made it to a fortnight of episodes so quickly.

[00:24] I want to thank all of you guys who have been listening to this podcast over the past. I think it's been about a month now. I really appreciate it.

[00:33] I appreciate all the feedback I've been getting, both good and bad. I think it's helped make this podcast a better podcast as each episode goes by.

[00:43] We had a lot of fun in our last episode, our last two episodes talking about Ben Heck about a lot of different things, Pinball.

[00:51] And those of you who have spoken to Ben, he's a really amazing guest. He's so knowledgeable in so many areas, not just in the technology and how to make things, but he's also so knowledgeable in pop culture.

[01:05] He's just a real Renaissance man, and we hope to have Ben on the show many, many, many times in the future.

[01:12] I want to start tonight's episode with a little bit of a serious note. I want everyone to really give their thoughts and prayers to Pincyder, Mike Bodak, and I hope I pronounced that right.

[01:28] And for those who have been following the thread, Mike suffered a stroke a few weeks back and has been in and out of different surgeries and in and out of different intensive care units.

[01:43] And it looks like he had a surgery just a couple of days ago that went well and is sort of relieving some of the pressure on his brain.

[01:51] But it's always good to, for all of us to be reminded at times, that there is just a lot more important stuff going on than Pinball and this hobby we love.

[02:01] And there are so many really amazing people that are part of this hobby.

[02:06] And so our thoughts and prayers go out to Mike and his family, and we really hope he has a speedy recovery and is back to enjoying Pinball and the hobby that he loves so much.

[02:18] So all of you out there, if you could please keep Mike and your thoughts and prayers that would be great.

[02:24] I want to tonight, this is just going to be a little bit of a solo podcast. I want to talk about a few recent things I've been seeing on the forum and just give sort of my opinions on them.

[02:37] And those things are stern Pinball. And I keep hearing this topic come up over and over and over in various threads.

[02:47] And the question is often asked, does stern have competition and should stern being nervous? And I want to talk about that tonight.

[02:56] I want to talk about an issue that seems to be of concern to all of the medieval madness remake buyers that are out there that has been sort of blowing up in the thread recently.

[03:12] And the last thing I want to talk about tonight is Pinball magic. And I sort of just want to discuss my thoughts after going to Sunshine Laundry, Matt and Brooklyn.

[03:26] And these guys have just one of the greatest Pinball collections of any location really in America at this point.

[03:34] And just my feelings on Pinball magic and is the magic still there and how much magic does it look like we're about to get in the current games are coming out.

[03:46] So let's start tonight with stern and the stern have competition. And the genesis for this is the recent thread I saw on Dutch Pinball having a factory tour of VIP factory tour recently where they showed the progress that's been made on the big Lebowski.

[04:12] And I think we all can agree that that tour looked really awesome and what was shown there seemed really impressive. And within within seeing this though, something always seems to happen in the pinball world.

[04:27] And that is when you show people your your progress in building a pinball machine and an innovating pinball the way Dutch is people always sort of not everyone but people have a tendency to say, ha, look at what they're doing there.

[04:47] Stern is going to be worried once these guys start shipping pins stern really better take notice and stern better start innovating and putting LCDs in and Stern is is really going to be shaking in in its boots when when this pin starts shipping.

[05:03] And I don't know I want to talk about this because this comes up over and over and over again and I think it's it's so premature every time there's a boutique or a new pin about the ship that people think Stern is nervous.

[05:21] And I want to go down the list of all the people that supposedly are should be making Stern nervous and and just let's look at the reality of what these people have done and what Stern has done.

[05:34] Okay. Is there no one else?

[05:44] Is there no one else? I that is what Stern internally is probably thinking whenever they hear that they have this competition.

[05:52] So let's let's let's go down and let's start with Dutch pinball.

[05:59] Dutch is shown that they have this facility and they have a plan in place to release the big Lebowski and that's great.

[06:11] It looks like they have a modern facility that is ready to go. It's got a little bit of a different sort of production line that were then what we're used to seeing with Jersey Jack and Stern.

[06:22] You know what words more of an assembly line those two have an assembly line where the machine moves along the line and and a little bit is done each time.

[06:31] Dutch has a different format for building their games and and that's great. But here's the thing and the big Lebowski was shown what in 2014 expo it arrived in what seemingly looked like a final form.

[06:52] The pin looked like it was built like it was ready to go into production shortly after it was revealed.

[06:59] But what's happened since then almost two years of gone by and not one is shipped during that entire time Stern has constantly been shipping pins.

[07:11] So there is no way that Stern is nervous about Dutch pinball and Dutch pinball shipping pins.

[07:20] And the thing too is this and I this is just something I can't figure out for the life of me and after talking of Ben Heck this may it seemed like this made even more sense.

[07:32] How can Dutch pinball not be financially hurting. They basically over the last two years have redesigned the big Lebowski.

[07:42] Okay they have gone back over the pin and made many changes. It's basically like a whole new pin that's happening underneath the play field from what they originally showed.

[07:54] It looks amazing the quality is impeccable but here's my question. Where is that money coming from? Who's financing two years of changes and work and keeping the factory lights on and not one game is on the line.

[08:11] And so they're constantly every day going into the red before pin number one even ships.

[08:20] And as Ben said you've got to build your first pin to set your bomb correctly and then you press it and then when you ask consumers for money the money that's coming in is going to the cost of the actual bomb and getting the pin on the line.

[08:42] So I don't know I think as much as we all want to celebrate in clap when we see the Dutch pinball factory and what's going on there.

[08:51] I am still a little bit nervous that everything is going to be great because again financially I don't know where you make that money up.

[09:03] Is it by the are they going to make it up on the pricing of the big Lebowski which it looks like it's going to be $10,000 at that price.

[09:13] I keep seeing people throw out numbers like they're going to they're planning to sell a thousand a year at 10 grand.

[09:21] Have we ever seen a $10,000 pin move at that volume also remember these pins are coming from overseas it's not like they're shipping.

[09:31] You know from Chicago or from a local distributor they these pins are traveling across the Atlantic so.

[09:40] I don't know I really don't know I look forward to the pin shipping soon I still have a lot of questions about how fun the pin is going to be the quality is definitely there haven't played the pin at any shows where it's sort of just grabbed me and made me want to keep shooting and flipping.

[10:01] But let's let's give them the benefit of the doubt they're going to ship this pin it looks like in the next couple months and that seems to be when production is going to start but in terms of competition to stern absolutely no way.

[10:15] Oh now look what you've done you brought the little bobbies down on us.

[10:21] Alright well let's let's go to JJP and this one's probably the most talked about comparison to stern because JJP in terms of having a facility and in a production and manufacturing capability is probably closest to stern in terms of what's out there in terms of options.

[10:47] And Jack has gone on record sort of going against Gary and has said things that have positioned his company as being the Gary's competition often times I think Jack has spoken in a in a not so classy manner about stern and I think that is unnecessary and I think he is calm down from that recently.

[11:15] But let's look at JJP for example so it's I don't know how many Jersey Jack pinball machines have shipped someone was saying in one of the threads they've 5,000 have shipped since they've started making was I don't believe that I would really have to see numbers to support that or maybe that also includes hobbit pre-orders I'm also hearing Jack tell people that eighteen hundred hobbits have been pre-ordered.

[11:44] I also don't buy that I think that possibly there were a lot of orders that initially came in when that machine was supposed to ship around the third movie but I can't imagine the demand is nearly as high for for the hobbit shipping as late as it is.

[12:07] But in terms of competition to stern. You know it's it's really hard to say that JJP is making stern nervous about anything and that's simply because in the last seven years JJP is shipped one pin one and yes they brought innovation and yes they've introduced new things to pinball.

[12:30] But as the stern line is moving and they're going through amazing titles one after another yeah they have some misses but they have way more hits lately and they're learning everything with every new pin they're releasing stern is capturing more and more of the market and and Jersey Jacks had one theme and I will say it's like a theme that is not really a theme that aligns perfectly with the the

[13:00] main collector of pinball but let's look at since Jack announced the hobbit on November 30th November 30th 2012 hobbits announced since then since then stern has released in house avengers Metallica star trek must

[13:23] be the walking dead wrestle mania kiss game of thrones iron man and spider man vault additions and you could also put in there that's

[13:34] there is also built wownell and medieval man is remakes okay so that looks like 10 10 pins have gone have gone on the man manufacturing line of stern while only one has gone on the line at JJP

[13:53] and what's what's really really really really happening here is when people say competition is stern the only way you can compete with stern and if you want to compete with stern is if you can get your manufacturing to a place where

[14:09] stern manufacturing is it's not about pinball it's not about securing license themes it's not about having pat law or design for your Keith code for you stern doesn't beat people on anything else other than their ability

[14:26] to manufacture that is really the main reason why stern is just dominating and I think JJP it when it comes to being a manufacture is still learning I mean it is kind of amateur hour over there when it comes to manufacturing

[14:48] and and something you know I just I think we just have to say this to when you're when you're manufacturing and you need to keep stuff moving and that is how you maintain your business and that is how you have to keep money coming in constantly and it is clear it is quite clear that JJP ran into financial troubles midway through shipping was

[15:17] and here's something that I really I really you know I wish people would just own up to this and they won't because every time I say anything like this I get so much negative backlash from the the JJP fan base and I don't I don't know why like this is not personal but this just just seems to be an observation of what's going on people people people

[15:43] act this way about the hobbit when Jack revealed it and there was all the upcry about the artwork and changes to the dragon what did Jack do he went back and he redid some things he redid some already redid redid some a smog but but that pin that pin was ready to ship in in 2014 the only reason it didn't ship is because of a lack of money

[16:13] if anyone thinks that that's not the case they're fooling themselves if anyone thinks that they've been spending the last two years significantly tweaking the game and making it much better I don't buy that I just don't buy that at all I think it's all been about getting Jack's financials in the right place paying the vendors to get the machine made and by the time all that has settled I think you've got a pinball machine that is too late to get in there

[16:43] I come to market to really be that relevant I mean the movie the movie turned out to be quite the dud and I really hear all this you know apologizing about it or people denying that the movie is not being great it's not really going to impact the pain of the pain is great who cares yes and no I really think that's not the case but you know it's when it comes out we'll see it's

[17:12] to come out in mid-March and I hope they hit that date but I also hope this I hope when they hit that date this pin ships in volume I hope we don't see what happened with was and they just slowly start to come out and then people who pre ordered are still waiting a year to get their pin if if that happens I really don't know what the future holds I think people are just beyond

[17:42] waiting for this thing just get it out but again in terms of competition this stern there's just no way JJP is making stern nervous in fact I think stern is really really really probably laughing at the debacle that these guys can't even get out two pins in seven years I mean if you're Gary you've got to look at that like that's a little bit of a joke and nothing to worry about on your front

[18:12] all right so something new I'm doing on Canada's pinball podcast as we continue to go down the line of of stern competitors and see where they match up is I've actually have a a a a a a a a a a a correspond and his join the staff you might know him better as rare hero we've settled our differences

[18:32] and I I've actually asked him if he could travel across the pond to the UK and check in with highway pinball and see how things are going over there and if they're really ramping up to be a stern competitor and here's what rare reported back when he he when he landed there

[18:51] and there's a lot of shit that I did over there that I find fucking hard to live with and I don't want to see people like you man coming back and having to face the rest of your lives with that kind of shit that's simple as that I don't feel sorry for myself and a lot fucking smarter now than when I went

[19:10] and I'm just telling you just for one there's a choice to be made here well there definitely are many choices to be made in in 2016 and the next choice that people can choose from is is highway pinball by Andrew highway

[19:32] I'll start by saying Andrew is one of the the nicest guys in the industry I had a pleasure of talking to him at expo and he's so approachable and he really will take the time to talk to his customers and I think that's great I think customer service goes a long way in this in this industry now when it comes to what highway is offering and their competition is turned here's another company sort of similar like Dutch we know they have this production facility they are going to be a lot more expensive than that

[20:02] they have all the tools to manufacture but we haven't really seen much manufacturing taking place have way full throttle is their first pen and I still don't understand what happened here so it apparently it launched I think frolic got his full throttle a few months ago I want to say like four months ago

[20:27] and it seemed like they shipped just a handful of them and then all of a sudden no more we're going out I want to guess and say there were some board issues I think I saw and just some other things they were tweaking so I don't know if those first 12 were sort of test units and beta units that were out there that some customers could get early

[20:52] but here once again we have I think a fundamental difference between stern pimbal and the competitors when was the last time you saw stern pimbal put a machine on the line and then ship a few and then three to four months none go out

[21:10] that just doesn't happen right they they iron out the kinks and don't start declaring that their pen is shipped until it's ready for the line and it's ready to stay on that line as long as orders come in and I think with highway there's like this there's always like this moment with all these new companies where they want to chess you know beat a little bit and say we shipped we did it we built the pin and we shipped it

[21:39] but I don't know when you turn your manufacturing on if it doesn't stay on you've sort of failed as a manufacturer you know it's every day that that line is down again where where's the money coming from I just for the life of me I don't know how these companies are really being financed and run if there's just months after months of nothing going out the door

[22:07] how how how can that be how can you stay in business we were talking about this would bend you can't take a bill like a loss leader on your first pin your first pen as to sell and make money to keep the company business now I mean I'm looking less these guys all have angel investors and are significantly wealth in and can eat the cause and look that maybe the case but with highway I really don't think they

[22:36] should have been declaring full throttle shipped and they get everyone can agree that full throttle it doesn't have stern worried at night it's not a license that a lot of people are clamoring for I don't think Stern's worried about the ability to swap out play fields and artwork I don't think many people are going to do that I don't think I think that's been tried I don't think it's going to be that successful I think guys love having who collect having like a lot of pins

[23:06] in the row versus storing play fields but we'll see what happens with that it's too early to tell for sure but here's the things if I'm stern that the pen I'm most nervous about or want to really gauge is alien I think alien is a theme that has a real ability to steal some money away from Stern especially when you look at 2016 and you have two humongous movie franchise is like Ghostbusters and alien

[23:36] ostensibly maybe going head to head in 2016 but here's the thing we all know we're right around the corner from Ghostbusters I mean it is probably the worst kept secret of all in in Stern history and when that pin gets revealed we're going to be able to buy it we'll be able to buy it we'll be able to buy it real soon it's going to ship within a few weeks of being revealed and people are going to have it and they're going to be playing it

[24:04] I think they're going to be playing it long before alien is even revealed and I don't know why alien did what they did with their here's here's an unpopulated play field I mean my god that was like one of the worst ways to sort of drum up excitement for the pen to release an unpopulated play field

[24:26] so you know like I think I think Stern is looking at these guys like all right you've shown 10% of a machine and you're already a year past what you said the release date was going to be on alien and and again you don't see Stern doing this you don't see them placing these arbitrary release dates then missing them I saw someone in the thread say well I think Stern is I'm

[24:53] and this goes back to Hobbit I think Stern is waiting you know I think they're waiting to reveal ghost busters for you know they're going to wait to hijack when Jersey Jack announces the Hobbit are you kidding me Stern is not waiting around to steal the thunder or take the window of the sales of highways alien or J.J.P.s Hobbit they don't have to do this the the only one taking the window of the sales of highway of J.J.P. of Dutch

[25:23] are those companies themselves they continue to trip they can train continue to fumble they can all continue to show they have no idea how to really manufacture a pinball machine and get it going they just don't

[25:38] and you know until they do it's it's just it's like Stern is just having a field day you know and there's only there's only one company that has shown they have any ability to manufacture and that's

[25:53] spooky and and let's end with spooky because I want to end with the best and these guys are the only ones who did it right they built a pin they made it they made it they made it ready to go they made it

[26:05] working they had code and they showed people what they could buy after they made it and they knew how to manufacture it and then they took orders and what what

[26:17] is happened AMH has become sort of like the darling of the pinball community and spooky's become the company that everyone looks at with credibility and respect now a spooky is not trying to compete with Stern

[26:30] Stern ships more games in a week than than spooky's ever made I don't know mainly I'm making that number but I thought Stern could do like 50 games a day

[26:38] right I mean they can do something high number high volume and you know so if you ask me I don't think people anyone is going to come anywhere near Stern's ability to manufacture games it's just not going to happen

[26:54] we'd be happy if a boutique and make two pins in two years at this point you know it doesn't look like Dutch is going to be making more than the big

[27:04] La Bousky they're going to make that if they finally get the thing on the line that they're going to keep that thing in the line for at least a couple years

[27:11] and if they announce their second pin again if it's not in a Stern like fashion same thing with JJP with Pat Waller if Pat Waller's game and Dutch

[27:22] pinball's second title if you don't have that pin those pins ready to be manufactured right near the reveal period you're done you're done no one is going to preorder and wait for years

[27:35] anymore for these things it's getting ridiculous and the reason why you're done is while you're like trying to take credit for just securing the license

[27:43] Stern is going to pump out Jurassic World they're going to pump out Star Wars they're going to pump out who knows what else

[27:49] they're going to pump out you know who trawn VE with original trawn are they can do Lord the Rings V that they're just going to keep making pins

[27:59] they're going to keep making pins and what I really hope is that all these other companies just get your manufacturing down do not reveal anything until you fully manufactured it

[28:10] don't show us the big Lebowski and then go back and then have to re manufacture the whole thing that is silly and that is amateur hours

[28:17] so let's just end there there's been a lot of discussion about whether or not Stern is any competition I think let's just all agree that they don't

[28:24] if you disagree hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com that's k a n e d a pinball at gmail.com and I'll happily read your comments I'll happily invite you on the show

[28:37] but when I said basically what I've just articulated here in the threads you know what I got a bunch of down votes so please tell me where I'm wrong here what I'm missing

[28:47] what I'm not seeing and I'll happily read your comments on the air. All right so if you guys heard what a MMR medieval man has remade threads sounds like these days

[29:07] yeah it's been a rough rough going for some of the buyers of medieval madness remake and I definitely feel the frustration of some of these guys

[29:34] so here here's the issue for for those of you who aren't following the thread it seems that the play fields were printed with black ink that didn't really come through great on the inserts

[29:53] and if you look at the the white inserts especially you know sort of trying to find a picture right now where it says like the king of pain in the middle and then on the left it is like the url of ego

[30:08] and and and those sort of five inserts when you when the light is shining from behind it it seems to be transparent and look a little opaque so it's got people frustrated and I understand why on some of them it looks much worse than others but you can definitely you can definitely see that the in quality is not great

[30:34] and so this this is led you know a lot of people to you know feeling really frustrated that you know they just spent $9,000 on this thing and and and and now the quality of it doesn't seem to be as good as the original

[30:52] and and there's always been the battle back and forth of which ones better the original or the remake and for the most part though the remake folks have always been able to say it's I'm buying the same pen you've had but this time with better quality and new materials

[31:09] so it's a little it's a little concerning to see that this issue has popped up and I think the reason why too because where most things can be fixed and adjusted this seems to be like a hard fix

[31:24] you just can't send people new playfields or do you know reprint them in any cheap fashion and even if you did let let's say they they let's say scenario one is they say we're going to reprint

[31:38] reprint your playfield if you have an issue or the issue is bad on yours what are you supposed to do send someone a playfield and have them rebuild the playfield that that's not a easy fix at all

[31:53] do you have people send in their full playfields and you replace it I don't that seems also like really difficult there doesn't there just doesn't seem to be any simple solution here playfields are big and populated playfields even bigger and sending those items in the mail is just a gargantuan effort and and then normally when these sort of things happen

[32:22] the person has to pay for shipping out of their own pocket and I don't know what they're going to do it seems like planetary pinball is is on top of it and is looking at the situation some of the people that it's afflicted

[32:42] it sounded like some guy was getting like a refund or some money back but not everybody was some people open up tickets and those tickets were were closed here's what I did I reached out to a few people who have been affected by this issue and I want to get them on to talk about it

[32:59] and I heard back from a few people that everyone wants to wait and see how this thing pans out before they come on the show to talk about this issue

[33:09] I played medieval madness tonight in original and I looked at those inserts and they were they were solid black there was no light shining through I heard some people say in the thread to just live with it to just accept it and be okay with it I think that's going to be hard for some people to do I think some people in this hobby treat their pins like their babies and they want to maintain them

[33:38] and want them to be as perfect as possible and whenever there's an issue that's new in box that's the thing it's when it's new in box you want your pin to be as mint as possible that's what you're paying for with a new in box is that it's an unmalested machine

[33:54] and there should be nowhere on it whatsoever and for this to have taken place I think it's going to be interesting to see how they handle this and what the outcome is

[34:05] so we're going to continue to cover this as more develops but I just wanted to shed some light on this issue and I think everyone should follow and see what the resolve is on it

[34:16] so the last thing I want to talk about and this is just a little bit of a plug for sunshine laundromat and I think it's green point I don't I don't I mean it's right on it's right off the edge of Williamsburg in Brooklyn there is I think you guys are most of you guys are familiar

[34:34] but there's a great laundry mat called sunshine laundromat and it used to have about I want to say like 12 pins lined up right next to washer machines and dryers and literally it was like one half of the the store was pinball and the other half was was washer and dryers

[34:52] and there was just a big bang bar just sitting there for anyone to play as well and over the last few months during the winter months they renovated and opened up in January a bar area in the back which is absolutely phenomenal it is it is it is easily the best place to play pinball in New York City now they they and they have I want to say probably like 200 thousand dollars worth of

[35:22] games and they have the best games there I'm going to I'm going to read you down from memory what they have there because I was there tonight they have in the front they have a terminator to they have a star truck the next generation and they have

[35:39] there's one more in the front that I want to say and then you walk in in the back it's cool there's like a door that looks like a washer and dryer and you pull it open and you're in this awesome sort of back bar area

[35:50] they have right when you walk into your right a big bang bar to the left of that they have a circus Voltaire then they have a tronle and then they have a theater of magic and then to the left of that is the bar and if you turn around facing this long wall they have a

[36:10] an anagones of the the Williams and the Jones then they have a gosh I should have pulled up my picture of it let me I'm just going off of my memory I want to say then it's there's a there's a spider man there's an AC DC back in black

[36:28] Ellie that's also a spider man black edition Ellie then there's a white water there's a a tails they were a midnight there's a scared stiff there's a

[36:46] I want to say Adam's family there's a medieval madness I might be missing a game in that row there and then and then there's like another section if you walk down like a

[36:55] step and there's another wall that's filled with like ten or twelve pins there's a safe cracker there's an attack from Mars there's a star track the next generation there's a Jurassic Park there's a I want to say the getaway or high speed or

[37:12] some I forget which one's there there's world championship soccer there's another star track the next generation there's just there's just so many pins and so if you if you're in New York you really have to make it there it's all the games are

[37:29] 75 cents to play and then the big bang bar is a dollar to play the point I wanted to make is when you're in a room that has just so many great pins from every error there's no

[37:45] EMS at all in the house where we're talking mostly everything from the the the DMD error on it really it just does something to me when I get to play all of these like highly sought after pins in a two hour period

[38:03] spending just twenty bucks the first thing it does to me is it really makes me question why do I want to own pins when I can get to this location so quickly and with just twenty bucks I can I can beat on a machine that people are spending twenty thousand dollars to have in their living room or their game

[38:22] when I'm talking about big bang bar and I play the game like big bang bar over and over and over again I'm like yeah this is fun but it's not nearly as good as some of the other pins there and I just you remove it just doesn't feel rare when it's just sitting out there in the open right same thing with like tron elite it's just it's just there like anyone can beat on it tilted kick it scratch it smash it it's it's just there and there's something about games on location that make you feel like

[38:51] they're not as special as we build up in our heads all the time because once we can play them and play them frequently out in the wild

[39:00] the desire to like just have my own it just dissipates and I don't really feel like I I even want to have a big collection because of how easy it is to get to it now I know most you guys out there that's not the case like you're not near anything like that and so you need to either have it in your collection

[39:19] or you're really not going to be able to play such a great variety all the time but one thing that I wanted to talk about is is pinball magic and and what that means and I had a couple people with me that were newbies and they they hadn't played pinball at all

[39:39] and when you're when you're new to pinball and I'll tackle this topic a little bit more in depth because I want to get some newbies on the talk about their experience with pinball

[39:47] but when you're on location and I think one thing hits you immediately it's that I don't know how to play any of these games like I don't know the code I don't know the modes I don't know how to shoot most of these games and so I'm either left trying really hard to read the card on the apron that tells you what to do

[40:07] but you know good luck when you're just stepping up like reading all that then like trying to leave a good example there's so many things to do and then you scan the play field to try to see what's where and you know at the end of the day the first thing you realize is I think every machine needs to have like one magical shot one rewarding shot that is inherent inherently an object without even knowing any of the rules

[40:34] just something that I can say I need to shoot that and I think every pinball machine needs that and it needs to have something that makes it fun to do in the first just few minutes regardless if you know anything about the pin and that's something I think older games didn't much better than newer games

[40:52] but that's not to say like all newer games don't have that and I found myself I want to sunshine two days I went back to back and I found myself one day really you know loving like circus full tear and tells the Arabian nights and these games just they seem to have like so much the toys are so fun and when you see that genie like grab the ball and suck it underneath or you see the ring master pop up I mean I

[41:22] 'll give this J pop was a master at giving you fun stuff to shoot and feeling a sense of of of accomplishment right away and tonight I felt that on a game that I hadn't really played very much and that was

[41:37] tronnelly I think that tronnelly to me was my favorite game the night I just kept going back to it over and over and over again shooting up the center getting this unlocking the spinner getting the spinner multi ball it was addictive

[41:52] with the machine shaking in the music going just really really awesome pin I understand now I people love that pin and and just are obsessed with it but but there's something

[42:05] just I really want to see in the new games that come out in 2016 and I want to see more magic I want to see more toys that make the ball do

[42:13] interesting things I really want to see implementation of magnets and and and just things that make us feel like something

[42:23] incredible is happening under the play field and it got me thinking about game of thrones Ellie and I love that

[42:30] machine I had a lot of fun on it but I asked myself like is there anything magical happening in that pin and it's got great flow it's got

[42:38] great code it's got good scoring but you know I was just I was thinking it and I was like well the ball never really does

[42:46] anything magical it really doesn't it moves beautifully and maybe that's the magic of the game is the flow but I you know I always

[42:56] want there to be something that that just like feels like an illusion is happening before me so let's hope that in 2016 with all these new pins coming out that the magic is back that that that the

[43:14] pinball machines will and pinball designers will start to ask themselves how can I make this ball do something it hasn't done before how can I create something that

[43:25] will really wow people and I haven't felt that in terms of the ball doing something that wowed me I haven't felt that in game of thrones haven't felt that in the

[43:35] hobbit I didn't feel that when I was flipping the big Lebowski so it's a shame that J pop is is worries that because I think that guy does have a

[43:49] knack for creating those wow shots but let's see what the future holds and let's all hope that more magic returns on the play field that's it I know that was a little bit of a of a quick abrupt ending here

[44:05] tonight but again ladies and gentlemen I want to thank you for listening to Canadian pinball podcasts let's all say a prayer for Mike tonight and hope he gets a speedy recovery and let's go play pinball and let's have fun

[44:18] and and do me one favor people just stop posting and it goes busses thread just stop that that it's just it's no one no one is even talking about pinball anymore in that thread it's it's there's a movie coming out with women and it just deal with it

[44:35] Kirk deal with it all right you're going to see it it's going to be good stop whining about women people without them none of us would be here have a

[44:47] good night till next time
