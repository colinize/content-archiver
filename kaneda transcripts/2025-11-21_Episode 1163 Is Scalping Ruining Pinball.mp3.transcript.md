[00:00] Oh, happy Friday everybody!

[00:28] The debate rages on.

[00:31] Scalping pinball machines.

[00:34] Is it something that is ruining the hobby?

[00:37] Project Pinball is making a lot of money.

[00:39] I posted that photo between the revenue and the expenses.

[00:43] I just asked them to comment.

[00:45] I'm not sure.

[00:46] We'll see what happens with their response.

[00:48] But there's a lot of money happening over there and these pinball raffles.

[00:52] I mean, you take six Beetlejuice machines and you're raffling each one for $24,000.

[01:00] Now look, we asked on my live yesterday, should I do one raffle for charity with the five

[01:07] Beetlejuice machines?

[01:08] I'm just here to clarify, we will not be doing that.

[01:11] It seemed like that made a lot of people upset.

[01:14] There are going to be five machines that will be transferred to five Canada Club members

[01:23] for MSRP.

[01:25] There won't be any shenanigans.

[01:27] There won't be anyone who's not a club member that gets a machine.

[01:32] So here's the thing though.

[01:34] Once the person who wins the opportunity, if you will, to buy one of these Canada Five

[01:40] Games, they can do whatever they want with it.

[01:44] If they want to take possession of it and play it, that's on them.

[01:47] If they want to sell their spot because they feel like selling it, I don't know if I'm

[01:52] going to be able to stop them.

[01:55] I might be able to, but should I?

[01:56] I mean, that is the question.

[01:58] There seems to be this philosophical question around who determines when someone should

[02:04] be allowed to sell something they purchased.

[02:08] Now look, I don't think anyone has a problem if someone buys one spot for a game, only

[02:14] one spot and then wants to sort of sell it.

[02:17] I don't think anyone's really questioning that person.

[02:21] It's more the people that have multiple spots with the intention of scalping.

[02:29] And should that be allowed?

[02:32] Should we publicly announce a list?

[02:36] So think about it like this.

[02:37] If Spooky Pinball were to sort of create a list of 999 people that they have allocated

[02:47] a spot for Beetlejuice and some of those names can come from distributors, some of them are

[02:53] coming direct, but at least then you would know that so and so doesn't have like five

[03:00] spots with five different dealers because it is easy.

[03:04] It is easy.

[03:05] It's not hard, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:06] Like I think that's the other side of the coin is it isn't difficult to email every

[03:12] distributor who carries Spooky Pinball and get on their list for a Beetlejuice and pay

[03:18] the deposit and maybe you personally take one game and then you've got three, four other

[03:24] spots to find people to buy the games.

[03:27] And now that we know, unlike some other games where if you did that, you would have lost

[03:32] money.

[03:33] You would have put down four spots for Toy Story CE that were nonrefundable.

[03:39] You would have lost a lot of money.

[03:40] You would have lost a lot of money if you did it with Ultraman.

[03:43] You would have lost a lot of money.

[03:45] Maybe if you did it with these Stern LEs because nobody really wants the recent Stern LE offerings.

[03:50] But there is something to be said for this constant debate and I've seen the threads happening

[03:56] on Pinside and I'm somewhere in the middle on this personally witnessing this in so many

[04:02] other collectible hobbies.

[04:04] I don't think there's really a way to police it.

[04:07] I really don't.

[04:09] If the manufacturers really, really cared about preventing this, they could.

[04:15] But they don't want to get involved.

[04:16] They really don't.

[04:18] It's the reason why Spooky Pinsell this game even direct because they could have sold all

[04:23] 999 direct and they could have made sure that they're not sending multiple games to multiple

[04:29] people.

[04:30] Even if they did that, like even if they did that, I guess you would have to make the spots

[04:35] non-transferable and you could refund people if they wanted out but they couldn't transfer

[04:40] their spot to another person.

[04:43] You could do it that way but you're still just going to get people walk down the street

[04:47] and have every one of their neighbors order a game and then yeah, you might have to take

[04:52] delivery but you're still going to be able to flip the game for a lot of money.

[04:56] Now that this game is getting easily on the table, $5,000 over, it's going to keep going

[05:02] up.

[05:03] I keep saying this.

[05:04] If Evil Dead, and they're almost done with the Evil Dead production, if Evil Dead is getting

[05:09] $5,000 on the table, I think Beetlejuice is going to get a lot more than that on the table.

[05:16] I don't think most people are scalpers though.

[05:19] This whole notion that it's ruining Pimble, I don't agree with that.

[05:22] I don't think this is happening all over the place.

[05:26] There's over a thousand games.

[05:28] How many Beetlejuice spots have changed hands in the last week?

[05:33] Not even five?

[05:35] Maybe 10 at the most?

[05:37] Maybe there's some deals happening behind the scenes but that's nothing.

[05:41] It's nothing for the most part.

[05:44] The majority of people that ordered Beetlejuice are going to take possession.

[05:49] The majority of people who want this game, who are paying attention to content creators,

[05:54] who are on Pinside, the majority of people who wanted a Beetlejuice bad enough got one.

[05:59] I don't think most people who really wanted this game got locked out.

[06:04] Now there were those people that wanted to wait to see the trailer and then tried to

[06:10] get through on Spooky's phone line and on their website.

[06:14] To those people, I don't know what to tell you.

[06:16] You knew that was going to be a problem.

[06:18] They told me they had 30,000 people on their website trying to load the page when the game

[06:27] went up for sale.

[06:28] 30,000!

[06:30] And there's only 1,000 games available to the buying public.

[06:36] It's a really exciting time for Spooky.

[06:38] They're doing great stuff over there.

[06:40] Luke said in a live chat with our fan base here that they are going to raise the price.

[06:46] I think the next game is going to probably be 11.5.

[06:49] And you know what?

[06:50] They're going to get it!

[06:51] They're going to get it!

[06:53] People are sort of seeing these games and the value and the excitement.

[06:58] They're going to get it.

[06:59] Now what they need to be careful is they need to have a ceiling by which they're not going

[07:03] to keep going up and up and up.

[07:05] But I also, you know, let's stop for a minute and say why couldn't Spooky Pimbal find the

[07:11] right balance?

[07:13] See the thing is this though.

[07:14] If you keep raising your prices the way Stern did, you go from 10.5 Godzilla.

[07:19] Here's the issue.

[07:21] If you're going to raise your prices, you need to make sure that the product is in line

[07:27] with raising those prices.

[07:30] So you know, I think that's the problem for Stern lately is they went from 10.5 and everybody

[07:35] that bought a Godzilla LE got some great value.

[07:39] The games were selling for over 10.5 and you know, there was a thousand of them and there's

[07:44] premiums and now there's like anniversary editions.

[07:47] But if you got an LE, you didn't lose money.

[07:50] There hasn't been a single Stern LE since then that has even held at 13.

[07:57] Jaws LEs are starting to sell below that because everyone now realizes the 50th anniversary

[08:04] is the better game.

[08:06] It just is.

[08:07] It looks better.

[08:08] It has a better play field.

[08:09] It has better mechs in it.

[08:11] It's the better game to have and they might make less than a thousand Jaws 50th by the

[08:18] end of this year, which would make it really the LE to have.

[08:22] And so now you've got four years of Stern LEs at 13 all losing a lot of value.

[08:28] So spooky Pimbal, if I'm them, you know, they're not going to get greedy.

[08:32] Luke is smart.

[08:33] They're smart.

[08:34] They understand Don is over there.

[08:35] There's smart people over there.

[08:36] You know, they're not going to get too greedy.

[08:39] What they simply could do and everybody knows this.

[08:41] I mean, the answer is staring them in the face.

[08:44] They don't need to raise their prices significantly if they want to make more money.

[08:50] They just need to sell more games direct.

[08:53] The margins aren't amazing on spooky games.

[08:55] I hear I think distros might be making a thousand per game on a Stern LE.

[09:00] They're making, I think, 2,500.

[09:03] But the problem with the Stern LE now is if you're a dealer or a distro, you've got to

[09:08] commit to buying a bulk of premiums and pros and what happens when the game is not a hit.

[09:14] So all that unsold inventory on the pro and premium games you had to buy eats away at

[09:20] your LE profit.

[09:22] And then you've got games like The Walking Dead where the LE didn't even sell out.

[09:26] They couldn't even move 500 units.

[09:28] But to get back to the question about should we or should we not come down harder on Pimbal

[09:33] scouting?

[09:34] You know how I feel about this.

[09:35] Just let the free market do what it will do.

[09:37] Just let the free market be the free market.

[09:39] Who would complain other than people that missed out?

[09:43] And that's my thing.

[09:44] If you missed out, you just didn't work hard enough.

[09:47] You just didn't.

[09:49] And I know the problem now, and this is why I said spooky could create a new fan club

[09:55] that gives people options to get their next games and they could charge way more than

[09:59] 50 bucks to get into that fan club.

[10:02] Why is that so unfair?

[10:04] How many of you out there belong to a country club?

[10:07] I don't, but I have friends that do.

[10:10] So you pay a membership fee to go to that club and use its resources and enjoy its service.

[10:18] Its golf course, its restaurant.

[10:20] That's why you pay the membership every year.

[10:23] You get to go.

[10:24] Everyone else doesn't get to go when they want to go.

[10:26] You could come as a guest, but you are not a member.

[10:29] So why is it like make people so upset if spooky is just like, I don't know.

[10:35] Like we're just trying to find a way to allow people who have the resources to get access

[10:42] to the products.

[10:43] It's all class warfare.

[10:45] It's like those with money will have an advantage.

[10:49] So you could raise your kids in a way where you don't think money gives people an advantage.

[10:54] It absolutely does.

[10:56] If you go to a restaurant a lot and spend money there a lot, guess what?

[11:02] You become a regular and they're going to treat you differently than someone who walks

[11:07] in for the first time.

[11:08] Is that unfair?

[11:10] If there's a table over there that doesn't have any reservation attached to it and someone

[11:15] walks in at the same time as a regular and that person is in front of the regular, who

[11:21] do you think they're going to give that table to?

[11:25] I know we're living in a new world now.

[11:26] We're like being a socialist is now becoming the trendy thing for Gen Z kids, but ultimately

[11:32] I think the only way to do it is let the market be free.

[11:37] And yeah, there's going to be those people that have four or five spots and they're going

[11:41] to scalp them.

[11:42] And hey, look, here's the thing.

[11:43] There's enough internet sluice going on on pin side and Facebook just out those people.

[11:49] If you want to shame them, maybe just out them and say, Hey, look, you know, Jim Bob

[11:54] over there in like, I don't know, Ohio, he keeps selling these games.

[11:59] Like if you're a distributor and a dealer or spooky, you could always cut him off if

[12:03] you see what he's doing.

[12:04] But I think all of this is a good problem.

[12:08] We would not be having this conversation if it was just Stern, Elise.

[12:12] We're talking about the other thing when we talk about Stern, how much money the games

[12:15] are losing.

[12:16] Nobody's scalping a Stern machine.

[12:18] Nobody.

[12:19] The machines used to be the games that everybody ran to to do this kind of behavior.

[12:25] And I can't wait for the next Stern machine.

[12:28] I get to scalp.

[12:30] I mean that because that means they hit it out of the park.

[12:33] It means they made a great game.

[12:35] We should be rooting for some of this behavior to be happening.

[12:40] If we witness this level of scalping, all it means is something good is happening in

[12:45] pinball.

[12:46] It's good.

[12:47] There's more demand than ever before.

[12:50] It's going to wake people up to be more diligent to get the next game from spooky.

[12:55] If it's Goonies, all bets are off.

[12:58] And that's why people are banging down the door now to get on that list.

[13:02] I bet right now, and I'm just going to say this, and they're not going to do this.

[13:06] But if spooky pinball said, hey, if you give us $3,000, you get the next three games from

[13:11] spooky pinball.

[13:12] It doesn't even go towards the games.

[13:14] Guess what would happen?

[13:15] If they did that, they would sell every single one.

[13:19] You know this, but they're not going to do it.

[13:21] They're not going to do it.

[13:22] The bigger problem in pinball is not the scalping.

[13:27] It's the overpriced nature of the other manufacturer's games.

[13:31] Now speaking of other manufacturer's games, here's another interesting storyline that's

[13:35] going to happen.

[13:36] We're getting more and more streams of Winchester's Mystery House.

[13:41] And I'm in the thread.

[13:42] And I'm just witnessing.

[13:43] I have not played this game enough.

[13:45] I need to play this game more.

[13:48] But in watching the streams, it is pretty apparent that it is a difficult game.

[13:53] And I think that's going to be appealing to certain people.

[13:57] And I think it's going to be a turnoff to certain people.

[13:59] I do think the gameplay is going to be a bit polarizing.

[14:04] They didn't play it safe.

[14:05] And that's what people also like about this game.

[14:09] So when you watch streams, it does get a little concerning for some to see the amount of shots

[14:16] that are bricking and hard to hit.

[14:19] And some people are saying, is this more like a modern day Houdini than the next Keith

[14:24] Elwyn game?

[14:25] A lot of us have been spoiled with some unique non-fan layout games that shoot so good.

[14:34] Spooky Pinball played it safe with Beetlejuice's layout.

[14:37] It's a lot more of a fan layout.

[14:40] The shots don't look too tight.

[14:42] And it's probably a lot of fun to shoot because of that.

[14:45] Fan layouts, when they don't break back and forth, if you look at Star Wars, the new one,

[14:50] it's a fan layout for the most part.

[14:52] But some of those shots are really tight.

[14:54] Like that Death Star shot keeps rejecting.

[14:57] And so, yes, some of them are buttery smooth, but some of them are really frustrating.

[15:02] In the end, it's not going to matter with Winchester.

[15:06] We do speculate a lot on whether or not Winchester's are going to go up in value or not.

[15:11] I don't know.

[15:12] The market on it, it's hard to tell.

[15:13] I will say this.

[15:14] There's more people scalping Beetlejuice machines right now than Winchester.

[15:19] Brian Savage said that people are not allowed to scalp their Winchester's, that they are

[15:25] going to refund your money, and things are non-transferable.

[15:29] You just can't police it, gang.

[15:31] You just can.

[15:32] People just take delivery of the game and then ship it to the new buyer.

[15:37] It's one extra step.

[15:38] It is a little bit of a headache, but it is what it is.

[15:41] But I'm just here to tell you right now, I am very excited about what's about to happen

[15:46] in Pimball in 2026.

[15:48] We are going to see a lot of really great Pimball next year.

[15:54] We've got Beetlejuice.

[15:55] We've got Sonic the Hedgehog, and we've got Back to the Future coming.

[16:01] If you think about just those three games alone, how excited are you for 2026?

[16:08] Very excited, right?

[16:10] Add into that Winchester's Mystery House and the next game from Barrels of Fun.

[16:17] Even without mentioning Stern Pimball once, you are so excited for what's coming in 2026.

[16:27] That's amazing.

[16:29] Add into the mix all of the games that Stern's going to put into the world.

[16:34] Unfortunately, I hope this rumor is not true.

[16:38] The remastered game next year is going to be ACDC.

[16:43] What?

[16:44] They made about 10,000 ACDC games back in the day.

[16:49] We don't need more.

[16:51] Talk about two games where you don't need more.

[16:54] Also, why remaster a game where you've got 10,000 people that own one and you're going

[17:02] to burn every single owner?

[17:05] Stern remake the games that are hard to get.

[17:09] How about a Batman Anniversary Edition?

[17:12] How about Tron?

[17:14] Or how about Lord of the Rings?

[17:18] If you want to sell 10,000 remastered games, make a remastered Lord of the Rings.

[17:27] Get the movie clips that coincide with the code.

[17:31] It is maybe the greatest Stern machine of all time with the worst art package of all

[17:38] time, but it's got the magic.

[17:41] And I understand it might be tricky with the license, but get it done.

[17:46] Everything can get done.

[17:47] They got Michael J. Fox to give his likeness for Back to the Future.

[17:52] Everything is possible.

[17:54] And so, you know, look, this walking dead remastered.

[17:58] I don't know.

[17:59] We're still waiting to see if there's going to be clips that are like animated over the

[18:03] show clips.

[18:04] I don't even know what that means.

[18:06] Stern Pinball never should have launched this game until they had all of the assets

[18:11] approved.

[18:12] Think about it.

[18:13] They are taking customer money and they're not able to even show you what you are going

[18:20] to get.

[18:21] We saw way more on Beetlejuice on day one than we did of even the walking dead.

[18:29] Stern is too far into this hobby to be doing this this late in their company like history.

[18:35] They know better.

[18:36] They just know better.

[18:38] And it feels like the reason they rushed it out is that they need to keep the line going.

[18:44] Star Wars did not sell that well, nor did King Kong.

[18:49] I don't believe that these new games have been selling very well, hence the reason why

[18:54] they rushed this game out.

[18:56] It had to be rushed out.

[18:57] Why would a licensor want you to reveal it until they've approved everything?

[19:02] Why?

[19:03] No, Stern needs to get the orders.

[19:05] They need to keep the line going.

[19:06] They need to get the money in.

[19:08] So again, it just keeps feeling like they're scrambling.

[19:11] So I hope in 2026 Stern gets its act together a little bit better.

[19:16] I hope next year they have a few bangers.

[19:18] You guys want it.

[19:19] I want it.

[19:21] Everybody wants great options.

[19:22] Why would we root for any of these companies not to deliver great options in pinball?

[19:28] So to put a pin in it, we'll see what Project Pinball says about all this money.

[19:32] I don't know, man.

[19:33] How much maintenance does it take to maintain a game in a hospital?

[19:38] These kids are not banging on it like it's a tournament.

[19:41] And I think a lot of those people are volunteering their time.

[19:44] So there's a lot of money being generated with these raffles.

[19:48] The moment I said the word raffle, people went crazy.

[19:52] You guys sound very Irish.

[19:53] The people that complain, Irish people, they're really haters on anyone who's trying to make

[19:59] a buck.

[20:00] They want you to be successful.

[20:02] They'll say stuff like the notions on him.

[20:05] The notions on him to sell a Beetlejuice spot for $5,000.

[20:10] Who does he think he is?

[20:12] And I would respond.

[20:13] I'm a capitalist.

[20:14] I am an American.

[20:16] And it's not being greedy.

[20:18] It's just being opportunistic.

[20:20] I mean, we don't even want to talk about all the people who have their money in crypto.

[20:24] They're not having a good week or month, people.

[20:27] Go look at what's happening over there.

[20:29] Total meltdown.

[20:31] Beetlejuice was where you should have put your money, not Bitcoin.

[20:34] Canada out, happy Friday.

[21:01] I want to be rich.

[21:03] I want to be rich.

[21:05] I want to be rich.
