[00:00] Yalla Bing-don

[00:02] My love for you is growing wide and low

[00:06] Yalla Bing-don

[00:09] I swell and burst when I see what we become

[00:13] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say...

[00:18] You know, I'm not even going to name this an episode.

[00:21] This is not going to be an official, like,

[00:22] Canada's 6-0, whatever. This is just going to be

[00:25] A little bit of a special edition of

[00:27] of Canatus Pimball podcast.

[00:29] It's 9.45 at night and I'm reading Pinside

[00:32] and I really can't believe what I'm reading

[00:35] that the Playfield manufacturer for Jersey Jack Pimball

[00:40] in a private message is threatening to sue somebody,

[00:44] is threatening to take someone to court

[00:47] because that person isn't happy with the product

[00:51] and isn't happy with the company

[00:53] and isn't happy with the conversation

[00:56] they've had with Mirko Playfields.

[00:59] Now look, nobody has covered this Playfield topic

[01:03] more than me.

[01:05] I'm exhausted by it, you're exhausted by it.

[01:08] We did not get into Pimball to have never-ending conversations

[01:13] about quality, never-ending conversations

[01:17] about customer service issues

[01:19] and never-ending conversations about how great Pimball machines

[01:24] that bring tremendous joy can be spoiled

[01:28] because you look down and the product you spent

[01:31] a lot of money on is starting to fall apart.

[01:35] Now I think what's very unfortunate

[01:36] for Jersey Jack Pimball is this wasn't part of the plan.

[01:41] Two things have happened in the last couple weeks

[01:43] that were not part of the strategy.

[01:46] And I didn't really talk about this on any of my shows

[01:48] but I want to remind everybody out there.

[01:51] Do you think it was coincidence

[01:55] that Jersey Jack Pimball announced their Playfield offer

[01:59] at the exact same time they announced

[02:01] Steve Richie was joining the company?

[02:04] It was a complete strategic move.

[02:07] Look at what's going on over here.

[02:10] Don't pay attention to the house that's on fire down the block.

[02:15] Let's do jumping jacks with Steve Richie

[02:17] coming through the door

[02:18] and we're going to layer at the same exact time.

[02:22] The announcement or buried the announcement if you will

[02:25] that Jersey Jack Pimball will be offering people

[02:28] Playfields at cost sometime in 2022.

[02:33] Did you notice how that news went out

[02:35] at exactly the same time as Steve Richie?

[02:37] And I'm okay with that.

[02:39] As a professional communicator and marketer

[02:41] that's sometimes what you do.

[02:43] You sometimes have to juggle the good news with the bad

[02:47] and sometimes the good news can help you

[02:50] sort of steer people away from the bad news

[02:53] which is the Playfield issues

[02:55] that never go away for this company.

[02:57] But here's the sad part for the Jersey Jack Pimball

[03:00] marketing team.

[03:01] They finally put out the communication they wanted to.

[03:05] This was as close to an admission of guilt

[03:10] of Playfield issues as we were ever going to get

[03:13] that you would be able to buy Playfields at cost

[03:16] for basically half the price.

[03:18] Okay, now that is what they wanted out there.

[03:21] If you had an issue, just email Barry with your serial number

[03:26] and you will be on the list to get one for $500

[03:30] basically next summer.

[03:32] I'm on the list to get my backup collectors addition

[03:35] Playfields.

[03:36] As I said, I will happily spend the money

[03:39] because there's no other option.

[03:41] I could kick in scream and cry all I want.

[03:44] But this is the best they are going to do for us.

[03:48] You know this, I know this, they know it.

[03:51] Everybody knows it.

[03:52] They are not going to give us fully populated Playfields.

[03:56] They're not going to pay for us to populate

[03:58] or Playfields or have someone do it for us.

[04:01] This was the best we were going to get.

[04:03] So they thought that they were done, right?

[04:05] They had put their offer out there

[04:07] and they could finally move on to the next chapter.

[04:10] They could finally start to think about the next game

[04:13] and then two super unfortunate things have happened back to back

[04:18] which have made the Playfield issues the spotlight again.

[04:22] And those two things were Jack Winari doing an interview

[04:25] in which he blamed customers for causing the issues

[04:29] with the Playfields.

[04:31] And now if that were not bad enough,

[04:33] now we have Mirko himself threatening to sue people

[04:38] who are posting stuff about his company

[04:41] and threatening to take them to court in the EU

[04:44] and not just like a threat,

[04:46] but a very bullying and aggressive way

[04:49] to talk to a customer of a pinball machine.

[04:53] Nobody who buys a pinball machine

[04:56] is looking to pick a fight with a Playfield manufacturer.

[05:00] Nobody who buys a pinball machine

[05:02] is looking to get into a lawsuit over the game they bought.

[05:06] They buy a game to have fun.

[05:09] They buy a game to enjoy.

[05:11] And when you see messages like this

[05:13] and it's interesting because Mirko did send this

[05:15] as a private message.

[05:17] So you could argue that this message

[05:19] should never have been made public,

[05:20] but the person who Mirko spoke to was so enraged

[05:25] by the way Mirko was talking to him, he shared it on Pinsite.

[05:29] It is now public.

[05:30] There is no putting it back.

[05:32] It is now out there for all of us to consume.

[05:35] And so I read it, I encourage you to read it.

[05:37] It's on my Facebook page.

[05:39] It is what it is.

[05:40] This isn't the first time that Mirko has been very strident

[05:45] with his customers.

[05:46] We have to remember that this guy usually goes on the attack

[05:51] when people question the quality of his products.

[05:54] We also have to remember that Mirko himself put up a video

[05:58] assuring everybody in the pinball world

[06:01] that he had fixed the Playfield issues

[06:03] with his own Playfields.

[06:05] He is the one that did the video

[06:07] where he's screwing the post in

[06:09] to prove that it doesn't pull and it doesn't crack.

[06:12] He's the one who put the Mirko quality seal

[06:15] on all of his Playfields moving forward.

[06:17] And now the world knows that that seal of approval

[06:20] means nothing.

[06:21] The world knows that that video didn't mean anything

[06:24] because people have still seen many issues

[06:27] with Mirko Playfields and Injurzy Jack games over the years.

[06:32] It's not just one game, it's three to four games

[06:34] that Mirko now has Playfield issues.

[06:38] You know, when people bring my name up in this thread,

[06:40] I think they think I'm gonna make this something

[06:42] way bigger than it is that I'm gonna scream

[06:44] from the rooftops that you should never buy

[06:46] another Jersey Jack machine

[06:48] until we drive Mirko out of pinball.

[06:51] Nobody is safe who buys games from this company

[06:53] and I'm not here to do that.

[06:56] At this point, you have more than enough information

[06:59] at your disposal to send Jersey Jack pinball a message.

[07:04] You have more than enough information at your disposal

[07:07] to do what you think is right for you.

[07:09] I can't control what you will do with your pinball dollars.

[07:14] There are a lot of pinball companies

[07:17] out there in the world right now.

[07:19] There are a lot of pinball companies

[07:21] that don't talk to their customers like this.

[07:24] There are a lot of pinball companies

[07:26] that would never, ever in a million years

[07:29] thread into sue their own customers.

[07:33] And what makes this really weird to me

[07:35] is that Mirko is a vendor of Jersey Jack pinball.

[07:39] They should never in a million years

[07:42] ever talk to a customer of Jersey Jack pinball like this.

[07:47] Mirko should not even be involved

[07:49] in any of these battles online.

[07:52] Jersey Jack pinball is not.

[07:54] Jersey Jack pinball is not on pinside.

[07:56] They are not arguing with people on Facebook.

[07:59] So why is Mirko doing that?

[08:02] And the rumor that we saw in the post

[08:04] that someone put up is that Mirko invested money

[08:07] in Jersey Jack pinball when Jersey Jack was

[08:10] in financial trouble and Mirko is a part owner

[08:14] of Jersey Jack pinball.

[08:16] Now I don't know if that's true or not,

[08:18] but now it starts to make a lot of sense

[08:21] why Jersey Jack pinball cannot get rid of Mirko.

[08:25] That maybe they are contractually obligated

[08:28] to work with Mirko because Mirko is a partner

[08:32] of this company and maybe they just can't get rid of them.

[08:35] Maybe it would cost way too much money

[08:37] to get rid of Mirko playfields.

[08:39] So they're stuck with Mirko playfields.

[08:42] It doesn't even matter if that's true or not,

[08:44] it doesn't matter.

[08:46] Mirko should never be talking to customers like this.

[08:49] All posts that are talking about playfields

[08:52] and Jersey Jack quality,

[08:54] all of those should be handled by Jersey Jack's

[08:57] customer service people.

[08:58] They should not allow Mirko to go off

[09:01] on these tangents and fight people.

[09:03] But he did it and he's done it before

[09:05] and he'll do it again.

[09:07] But the real question is not what Mirko's gonna do next.

[09:10] The real question is not what Jack Winari's gonna say next.

[09:14] The real question is not what you're gonna hear

[09:16] on the Jersey Jack pinball podcast

[09:18] where they interview themselves.

[09:19] The real question in all of this is what are you gonna do

[09:24] to send a message if you don't agree with this?

[09:28] What are you gonna do to send a message

[09:30] if you think there's no room for this behavior

[09:33] in the community?

[09:35] Are you gonna put your money where your mouth is

[09:37] and not buy anymore machines from Jersey Jack?

[09:40] Or are you gonna see Toy Story knowing that Mirko

[09:44] is making the playfields and go all in on it

[09:47] and have complete memory loss about all the pain

[09:50] and suffering that guns and roses buyers went through?

[09:53] That's the question is what you're gonna do.

[09:55] It's not what Kanade is gonna say about it.

[09:57] You know how I feel about all of this.

[10:00] I think this entire thing is spoiling

[10:03] one of the greatest pinball companies on planet earth.

[10:06] I think Mirko continues to be the Achilles heel

[10:09] of Jersey Jack pinball and I don't know why

[10:12] they can't get rid of them,

[10:13] but I know when they come out with their next game

[10:16] and if I see Mirko playfields on Toy Story,

[10:19] I'm gonna think long and hard about whether or not

[10:23] I wanna buy that game and I'm also gonna look for them

[10:26] to prove to me that these things are gonna hold up

[10:29] and I'm also gonna wanna make sure I see one thing

[10:32] and this is the one thing I think all of us should ask for.

[10:34] I wanna make sure Jersey Jack pinball

[10:37] changes its warranty back to cover their actual games.

[10:41] I can't believe the way they just rewrote their warranty

[10:45] where they basically cover nothing

[10:47] and if they wanna get my confidence back in them

[10:49] and your confidence back in them,

[10:51] maybe we should demand that the warranty of the product

[10:55] we buy actually includes the playfield.

[10:58] Maybe it's the first two months of ownership,

[11:01] maybe it's the first 500 plays or 1000 plays.

[11:03] I know it's hard to police this stuff

[11:05] but I would like to see them stand behind their products

[11:09] because until they do that,

[11:10] until they actually warranty what they're selling you,

[11:13] they're basically saying if you buy our product,

[11:17] we will not stand behind it because we don't have to

[11:21] because it's not in the warranty.

[11:23] But here's what I think is gonna happen

[11:25] as much as people kick and scream,

[11:28] as much as people complain on pinside,

[11:30] as much as people throw a hissy fit,

[11:33] the moment Toy Story gets revealed to the world,

[11:36] the collector's editions will sell out in one day

[11:39] and it won't matter and they won't have learned a lesson

[11:43] because this hobby is going in a direction

[11:46] in which quality is not the most important thing.

[11:50] This hobby is going in a direction

[11:52] in which customer service is no longer

[11:54] the most important thing.

[11:56] This hobby is going in a direction

[11:59] in which fellow pinciders are not here

[12:01] to help each other out anymore.

[12:03] This hobby is just going in a direction

[12:05] in which people are just looking out for themselves

[12:07] to get their hands on the hot new game and that's it

[12:11] and they don't wanna get locked out

[12:12] of getting the best version of the game.

[12:15] Everyone's buying games sight unseen now.

[12:17] Everyone's buying games before they know

[12:19] what the quality is, before they know what the game play is,

[12:22] before they know what the code is.

[12:24] This hobby is going in a really strange direction.

[12:27] For someone like me who covers the pinball hobby,

[12:30] I'm an observer, like I'm not going in on most of these games,

[12:33] I'm not chasing after most of this stuff

[12:36] and I still get excited and entertained

[12:38] to cover this hobby on your behalf.

[12:41] Would I like to see people put their money

[12:43] where their mouth is and send a message

[12:45] to Jersey Jack Pinball? Absolutely.

[12:48] Absolutely, remember on a personal level for me,

[12:51] they banned me from their Facebook page

[12:53] from talking about playfields.

[12:55] Can Cromwell unfriend it me as well?

[12:59] So on a personal level, I think Jersey Jack Pinball

[13:01] has also come after me in both a passive aggressive way

[13:06] and an aggressive way, they've told me,

[13:08] Canada, we don't want much to do with you.

[13:11] Now Barry did get back to me and Barry is gonna get me

[13:14] a replacement playfield and I'm fine with that

[13:17] and I fully respect their right to ban me on Facebook

[13:21] and it's up to can if he wants to unfriend me.

[13:24] That's fine, I respect that.

[13:26] He's a grown man, that was his decision.

[13:28] It's their Facebook page, that's their decision.

[13:31] I have some people banned on my Canadian pinball podcast page

[13:34] as well, that's the right you get when it's your thing.

[13:38] It's their company, it's their decision to make

[13:41] and they can do what they want.

[13:42] They don't have to do anything other than what they want to do.

[13:46] Whether you think it's the right thing to do or not,

[13:48] that's up to you.

[13:49] But again, all of the power,

[13:51] all of the power in this trivial little hobby of ours

[13:55] and it is a trivial little hobby.

[13:57] All of the power in pinball is yours.

[14:01] Nobody is making you buy a game.

[14:03] You don't have to support any of these companies.

[14:06] We don't need to expand pinball anymore.

[14:09] We expanded pinball too much, the problem is this.

[14:12] We expanded pinball and all the jerks came into it.

[14:16] Really, this hobby used to be such a smaller,

[14:19] more niche community and even though there were jerks

[14:21] like me and Hilton, you let way more people into it

[14:25] who don't really care about pinball.

[14:28] They really just want to have the shiny,

[14:30] new, expensive, collectible and that's all that matters.

[14:32] And now the pinball fans are having a hard time

[14:35] getting the very games that they invited other people

[14:38] to get into and it's a problem and Stern's gonna milk it

[14:42] and Jersey Jack's gonna milk it.

[14:45] Before you realize it, you're gonna look at your wall

[14:48] and see four pinball machines and be like OMG,

[14:52] that's $50,000 I spent on just four pinball machines.

[14:57] We are gonna be there so fast.

[15:00] It's not even funny.

[15:01] I don't know, is this the end game we want it?

[15:04] Did we want pinball to turn into Rolex?

[15:07] Did we want pinball to turn into like fine wine?

[15:10] I don't know, but somewhere along the line,

[15:13] it's turned into that.

[15:15] And look, at these prices,

[15:16] you don't deserve to be threatened with a lawsuit

[15:19] by your play field manufacturer.

[15:22] I think Jersey Jack pinball and I've said this before

[15:24] and I'll say it again, I just think they need to say

[15:26] they're sorry.

[15:27] I haven't heard them say they're sorry.

[15:30] I haven't heard Mirko say, I'm sorry

[15:33] that some of my play fields made their way to customers

[15:36] and have had issues.

[15:38] He's never said he's sorry.

[15:40] We've never heard an official apology

[15:43] from anyone over at JJP.

[15:45] All the marketing in the world,

[15:47] all the communications I've learned in the world,

[15:49] just being honest and being truthful

[15:52] and being transparent and being human

[15:55] is the most important thing.

[15:57] And I think saying I'm sorry,

[16:00] we're sorry some of these games have issues.

[16:02] We're gonna give people a chance to buy the play fields

[16:05] at cost and if you need help swapping in your play field,

[16:09] we can put you in touch with people

[16:11] who are capable of doing such work.

[16:13] But we recommend just play your games, enjoy your games.

[16:17] If there are some play field issues,

[16:19] we are sorry, we're doing everything to make sure

[16:21] this never happens again.

[16:23] We know this has happened on multiple titles

[16:26] and we know you won't believe what we say.

[16:30] We know the only thing that's gonna speak volumes

[16:33] moving forward for this company is action.

[16:36] And we know that you're gonna demand better play fields

[16:39] in future games moving forward.

[16:41] And we look forward to exceeding your expectations.

[16:44] And I would say we're sorry.

[16:46] And I would say we are really excited

[16:49] with what's coming down the pipeline

[16:50] over at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[16:52] We're excited to have Steve Richie join the team.

[16:55] We are gonna ramp up production,

[16:57] but we are not gonna ramp up production

[16:59] at the cost of quality and customer service.

[17:02] And just say you're sorry and say something like that,

[17:05] Jersey Jack, and move on.

[17:07] Stop blaming customers, Jack.

[17:10] Stop doing that.

[17:11] Mirko, stop pretending like there is no issue

[17:13] and it's Jersey Jack's fault.

[17:15] He doesn't want people to know that he's telling people

[17:17] privately that they're overtorking the post.

[17:20] What are you doing?

[17:21] Something's wrong with the way you're doing your games.

[17:23] If something were not wrong,

[17:25] we wouldn't be seeing all these photos.

[17:27] And I think we need to just move past this whole thing.

[17:30] It's just time where we're Jersey Jack and the community

[17:34] and all of us just realize like it is what it is.

[17:38] This is what they're gonna do for us

[17:40] and moving forward, all the power is yours.

[17:43] It's all yours.

[17:44] There is nobody else.

[17:46] It's not like Jersey Jack Pimball

[17:48] is making a drug that you need because you have a disease.

[17:51] You can easily not buy the product

[17:54] and still be happy in Pimball.

[17:56] And there are gonna be many of you out there

[17:58] who don't care that there are issues

[17:59] and buy the next game.

[18:01] And there's gonna be some of you out there

[18:03] who on principle alone will not touch

[18:05] Jersey Jack Pimball again.

[18:07] And I think that's the fair way to look at it.

[18:10] And I'm exhausted by this topic.

[18:12] I'm absolutely exhausted by this topic.

[18:14] I can't believe we're still having it.

[18:17] I wanna thank each and every one of you

[18:18] who listens to Canada's Pimball podcast and supports me.

[18:22] It's been a really interesting year covering Pimball.

[18:25] I think we're in for a very exciting fall

[18:28] into winter of Pimball in 2022.

[18:31] There's a lot coming from Stern

[18:33] back to the future, Godzilla.

[18:36] We're also gonna get James Bond.

[18:37] We're gonna get Rush Pimball.

[18:39] We're gonna get all these things just from Stern.

[18:42] Then we're gonna get stuff from American Pimball.

[18:44] We're gonna maybe get Toy Story revealed this year.

[18:46] We're gonna get cactus Canyon.

[18:48] We're gonna get pulp fiction.

[18:49] We're gonna get a lot of stuff coming out.

[18:51] I know there's a part supply issue

[18:53] and that's gonna really hamper and delay stuff.

[18:56] But Pimball's got a great future.

[18:58] It's got a great future.

[19:00] But again, the one thing ruining this hobby

[19:02] is going to be quality issues at these prices

[19:06] and all of the people that have flooded into Pimball

[19:09] and that are inflating these game prices to the point

[19:13] where it's just becoming comical.

[19:15] Like people didn't want Willy Wonka Collector's Edition

[19:18] for a year.

[19:20] Now every Willy Wonka Collector's Edition is $16,000

[19:23] or $17,000.

[19:24] This is where we're at.

[19:26] This is where we're at.

[19:27] It's so much more fun to be a spectator on this.

[19:31] If you gave me $16,000,

[19:33] the last place I would wanna put it into right now

[19:36] is a Pimball machine.

[19:37] That's just me speaking.

[19:40] It's just the enjoyment is not there for these prices.

[19:43] It's absolutely bonkers.

[19:45] People forget Lord of the Rings with everything in it

[19:48] was like less than $5,000.

[19:51] And that has more in it than Willy Wonka.

[19:54] And now we're looking at these games

[19:56] and we're spending $16,000.

[19:58] $38,000.

[20:00] It's silly.

[20:01] The whole thing is silly.

[20:02] But it's your prerogative.

[20:04] It's your money.

[20:05] If $30,000 means nothing to you

[20:08] and you wanna go get a pirate CE

[20:10] and that's gonna make your life so much better

[20:12] than so be it.

[20:13] So be it.

[20:14] I will continue to wake up.

[20:16] Put a mic on.

[20:17] This cost me nothing.

[20:19] This cost you nothing.

[20:20] And I think listening to Canada's Pimball podcast

[20:23] all these years is probably more entertaining

[20:26] than any Pimball machine ever.

[20:28] I know you will never admit that,

[20:30] but deep down inside.

[20:32] You know it's true.

[20:33] I'll talk to you soon, everybody.

[20:34] When I see you, I feel a thing they know.
