[00:00] You'll see what I want what I really really want

[00:02] Don't tell me what you want but you really really want

[00:04] I'll see what I want what I really really want

[00:07] Don't tell me what you want but you really really want

[00:09] I wanna I wanna I wanna I wanna I wanna

[00:11] I wanna really really really wanna zegas egg

[00:16] If your on that future, forget my past

[00:24] You know I haven't ranted since being back on the Airwaves

[00:27] And I'm just here to tell you right now

[00:29] I'm going to rant about something because when I saw this today, it literally made me feel

[00:34] like they haven't heard a single thing we've said.

[00:39] And there is a level of delusion going on at one pinball company down in Texas.

[00:45] And for so many of you out there, so many of you out there, you tell me your friends

[00:49] with this gentleman, you tell me that you are great friends with Steve Bowden and how

[00:54] nice he is.

[00:55] And I agree with all of you.

[00:56] I haven't met Steve personally, but I have never heard anyone say a bad thing about Steve

[01:01] Bowden.

[01:02] But here's what I'm here to ask all of you out there who are friends with Steve Bowden.

[01:07] Why are none of you?

[01:09] Why are none of you being a good friend?

[01:11] Why are none of you calling up your friend and saying, what are you doing?

[01:16] Like what is this?

[01:17] Like how is this the approach and the strategy of this company?

[01:23] And maybe you should help him out a little bit.

[01:25] Like be a good friend.

[01:26] And I think so many of you out there who claim to be great friends of Steve Bowden are

[01:31] not helping him out.

[01:33] And the reason why I'm doing this podcast right now is because I literally take offense

[01:39] to deep root pinball after that reveal.

[01:42] I take offense to this being the next thing we hear from them.

[01:46] And so today, Steve Bowden shared two things on his Facebook page, which you may or may

[01:52] not have seen.

[01:53] But we are right on the eve of Guns and Roses being revealed to the world by Jersey Jack

[01:59] Pimball.

[02:00] And let me tell you something.

[02:01] It's a final game.

[02:02] It's fully working.

[02:04] It's fully coded.

[02:05] And let me tell you something.

[02:06] Guns and Roses is already over in Australia.

[02:10] It's been on the line.

[02:11] It was on a ship to Australia weeks ago.

[02:14] We are going to see a real Pimball machine that we can buy the moment they announced Guns

[02:20] and Roses.

[02:21] Okay.

[02:22] And here, as a Pimball community, are we here to be impressed by Pimball or PowerPoint?

[02:30] And that is the question I have on this rant.

[02:33] Is it Pimball or is it PowerPoint?

[02:35] Why does deep root pinball continue to give us PowerPoint slides as to a proof point of

[02:44] what they're going to do in this Pimball hobby?

[02:46] And they never show us a working game.

[02:48] And so two things happened today.

[02:50] We got a post from Steve Bowden and his fun with bonus site is now changed over to be

[02:56] a deep root sort of information site.

[03:00] And he posted this thing, which is a link to a script.

[03:04] It's like a narrative of retro atomic zombie adventure land, the atomic shop.

[03:09] And I'm reading this thing and the whole time I'm thinking myself, wait a minute.

[03:13] You guys had a reveal of this game.

[03:15] You had a reveal of this game in which nobody got to see a working game.

[03:20] And the next thing at a deep root pinball is this a link to some storyline, a storyline.

[03:28] Like are we making a cartoon?

[03:30] Are we making a TV show?

[03:32] Are we making a pinball machine?

[03:33] Like I don't need a, like where are you going to see this script?

[03:37] Like where is any of this narrative going to come to life in a pinball machine?

[03:41] Like this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

[03:43] And then a few hours later, he posts this thing called Raza Quick Shots.

[03:49] Welcome to Quick Shots where you will see some features of Raza and what they do in a

[03:54] simple way.

[03:55] Okay.

[03:56] And you know what this is?

[03:57] Is it the game?

[03:58] Is it the game doing this?

[04:00] Is it the game showing these features?

[04:01] No, it's a PowerPoint slide.

[04:05] Another PowerPoint slide about how the skillshot will work on the game.

[04:10] And it shows the back bar and what's going to be on the screen there.

[04:14] And then the pin bar and the different options the player will have on the pin bar when

[04:19] they plunge their skillshot.

[04:21] So thank you very much for showing me a PowerPoint slide about what will be in your pinball machine

[04:29] that was supposed to be revealed two weeks ago.

[04:33] And I don't know about the rest of you out there.

[04:35] But I'm at the point now where like how are they even thinking that this is a good idea?

[04:42] And the other thing that just drove me crazy.

[04:44] So he posts this and I commented.

[04:46] I want to read my comment on Steve Bowden's post.

[04:49] I wrote, hey Steve, when will we get to see this thing in a working game?

[04:56] Seems neat.

[04:57] Just would love to see it in action versus PowerPoint slides.

[05:01] Okay.

[05:02] I wrote that.

[05:03] It's on this page.

[05:04] You know what?

[05:05] He didn't respond.

[05:06] He didn't say anything to me.

[05:08] He clearly saw me write that.

[05:10] He saw me just asking him, when do we get to see a working game?

[05:14] And then John Norris, who works for Deeproot, John Norris wrote, so if I plunge without doing

[05:21] anything, I will see red for regular skillshot and one purple random shot as my skillshot.

[05:27] All right, or super skillshot.

[05:29] Okay.

[05:30] So John Norris writes a question about how it works.

[05:33] Okay.

[05:34] John Norris works there.

[05:35] So I love it that someone who works at Deeproot Pimball is asking questions about their own

[05:40] platform.

[05:41] And Steve Bowden responds to John Norris and says, correct, this lets me know what I

[05:48] did in okay job with my write-up.

[05:51] Thank you, John.

[05:52] All right.

[05:53] Steve, Steve, I'm happy that you responded to John Norris, who works at your company,

[05:59] who should know what's going on with your company.

[06:02] But you didn't respond to me, Steve Bowden, the number one Pimball podcaster in the world

[06:07] with a 3000 listener audience.

[06:10] You ignored my statement in which I asked you, when are we going to see a working game?

[06:16] And so now 3000 of my listeners get to hear this.

[06:21] You don't ignore these kinds of questions.

[06:24] You don't do it reveal like this and then come back at us with PowerPoint slides.

[06:30] I mean, anyone can write on a PowerPoint slide, hey you guys 2021.

[06:37] I mean, if I want to go to investors and say like, where we're going, we don't need

[06:41] roads.

[06:42] You know, sweep the leg.

[06:44] I feel the need, the need for speed and just put like a date.

[06:48] It's an absolute joke that all we're getting is PowerPoint slides.

[06:51] Steve, Deeproot, John Norris.

[06:54] See you over there.

[06:55] Listen to me right now.

[06:57] Listen to me right now.

[06:58] Take notes.

[06:59] You need to show us a working game.

[07:04] You don't need to talk to us about what we're going to see in a Pimball machine with PowerPoint.

[07:10] The fact that this company has said all of these things they're going to do is fine.

[07:15] But back it up with a Pimball machine.

[07:18] The fact that you're backing it up with PowerPoint slides like Steve, you're showing us what the

[07:23] Pimball can do.

[07:24] You're not showing us what the Pimball can do on the actual Pimball.

[07:29] You're showing us with a PowerPoint slide.

[07:31] And this can't happen.

[07:34] This can't happen.

[07:35] And I don't understand why people are allowing this to happen.

[07:39] Maybe people don't care.

[07:41] Maybe people think it's like, you know, a forgotten thing already.

[07:43] But this to me speaks volumes about where this company is right now.

[07:50] You have to be kidding me.

[07:52] You have to be kidding me.

[07:54] You think we're going to give you guys like the benefit of the doubt now.

[08:01] You think this is going to be damage control.

[08:04] You think you can spin this now.

[08:07] You think you can spin this now.

[08:08] And I'm just going to go off on a little bit of a tangent right now.

[08:11] You got in bed with John Papaduke, a guy who's been working on this Raza game for seven

[08:16] plus eight years, right?

[08:18] John Papaduke has been working on this game for seven years.

[08:22] We're about to see what Eric Minier has done with Guns and Roses in just a year or two.

[08:27] And Eric Minier's Guns and Roses blows Raza out of the water.

[08:31] It doesn't have a pin bar.

[08:33] No one's going to walk up to it and say, where's the pin bar?

[08:36] They're going to walk up to it and say, oh my God, look at this thing.

[08:40] It's insane.

[08:42] Like look at this game.

[08:43] And it's a real game guys.

[08:45] It's not vaporware.

[08:46] It's not a PowerPoint slide.

[08:48] It's not like a narrative.

[08:50] Like Eric Minier is not giving us the script of the game.

[08:54] So at what point are you who are friends with Steve Bowding going to call this guy up

[08:59] and say, Steve, what are we doing?

[09:02] John Norris, what are you doing?

[09:05] Robert Mueller, what are we doing?

[09:06] Like are we making scripts?

[09:09] Are we making animations?

[09:10] Are we making, what are we making here?

[09:13] Are we making pinball machines?

[09:15] Like you have to show your pinball machine.

[09:18] And you said so much about the competition.

[09:21] Steve, you got up there.

[09:23] And I mean, Steve, you got up there.

[09:26] There was expo or Tpf, Steve.

[09:28] You were up there with the deep root crew.

[09:30] You were up there, Steve.

[09:32] You had the mic.

[09:33] And you said just wait.

[09:35] You guys all had these smug smiles on your faces as you, as a company, as you guys slammed

[09:42] the other companies.

[09:44] You guys threw the other companies under the bus and were all smug and said, wait, you

[09:49] see what we got.

[09:51] Okay, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

[09:53] What do you got?

[09:55] What do you got?

[09:56] And all you're giving us is PowerPoint slides.

[09:58] Meanwhile, over at Jersey Jack Pimball today, I'm looking at Eric Minier leaning over the

[10:03] game.

[10:04] The games that are on the line, those games are on the line, people.

[10:07] You're going to get your guns and roses.

[10:09] So this is it.

[10:11] Like this is it.

[10:12] Like Steve Bowden, like John Norris, everyone over there, like you need to show us a working

[10:18] game.

[10:19] It's over.

[10:20] Like I don't want to see your scripts.

[10:21] I don't want to see your millions of dollars of animations from the Utah studio.

[10:25] I don't want to see any of that.

[10:27] Where's the game?

[10:28] What was the point of all of this stuff?

[10:31] And you keep doing it.

[10:32] And you keep doing it.

[10:33] And for those of you who are friends with these gentlemen, call them up.

[10:37] Like it's not about NDAs anymore.

[10:40] It's about showing us what you got.

[10:43] You spoke so much smack about everybody else.

[10:46] What do you got?

[10:48] Can't you show us the Pimball or Steve Bowden?

[10:50] Why can't you show us the Pimball?

[10:52] Why can't you show us how you skill shot with the Pimball?

[10:55] Why are you showing the Pimball with a PowerPoint slide?

[10:59] Man, it's not PowerPoint.

[11:02] It's Pimball.

[11:03] This is so sad to me that we are having a company boast about what you're going to be

[11:09] able to do in PowerPoint.

[11:12] Anybody can make a PowerPoint slide.

[11:14] I can make a PowerPoint slide that says the ball levitates that John's Magna Flibary

[11:19] and Magic Girl works.

[11:20] It's all bogus, man.

[11:22] It's all bogus.

[11:24] Because if your Pimball machine can actually do it, wouldn't you show it?

[11:28] And here we are on the eve of Guns and Roses and what you're going to see this incredible

[11:32] game and it's going to be real.

[11:34] And I think everyone over at Deeproot needs to make a real decision.

[11:38] You need to make a real decision over at Deeproot.

[11:41] You need to all just stop talking and get a working game together.

[11:45] A final working game.

[11:48] Until you can show us a final working game, we know as a community, you can't start

[11:54] making it.

[11:55] You can't order parts.

[11:57] Like why isn't Raza working?

[12:00] Why isn't Raza working?

[12:02] Steven, answer us that question.

[12:04] Why can't you show us a working Raza?

[12:08] You're still trying to tease us.

[12:10] Do you not understand, Steven?

[12:12] You can't tease us now a game that was already revealed and couldn't be revealed.

[12:19] Do you understand that?

[12:20] The days of like slowly trickling this stuff out are over.

[12:25] And they're still doing it.

[12:27] And it leads me to believe that they're holding on to some sort of like quantum of hope

[12:32] that this thing can still turn around.

[12:35] But it's unbelievable to me that Deeproot did not have a meeting and say nobody say anything.

[12:42] John Norris, John Papadu, Barry O, Steven Bowden, nobody say anything until we have a working

[12:48] game.

[12:49] And it's like it's crazy to me that the one thing, the one thing they won't show us

[12:54] is a working game.

[12:56] It's pinball.

[12:57] It's a working game.

[12:59] You have to show the pinball.

[13:02] This is it.

[13:03] This is it.

[13:04] I think it's disrespectful to all the other companies that have worked really hard to create

[13:10] a working game.

[13:11] I think it's very disrespectful for all those companies, for you guys who talk so much

[13:17] smack to have nothing to show.

[13:20] So either the next thing you should say is you should apologize to all those companies

[13:26] that you talk smack to or deliver.

[13:30] Like there's one or the other.

[13:31] But it's not this crap.

[13:33] It's not a script from the Ned Raza storyline.

[13:37] It's not a PowerPoint slide about how the pinball works.

[13:40] I mean, you're still going back to this pinball.

[13:42] And nobody can see it work.

[13:44] It's unbelievable to me.

[13:46] And I just want to say all of this ends Monday.

[13:50] When you see guns and roses on Monday, it's over.

[13:53] It's over.

[13:54] You and whatever Deeproot relevancy they want to have, they're going to realize on Monday

[13:59] what a real pinball machine is.

[14:02] What real innovation under the glass is, they're going to realize that they went down a road

[14:08] and they listened to John Papaduke and they did all these things that are what Jay Pap thinks

[14:13] you need to do to succeed.

[14:15] And everyone's going to realize on Monday that Eric Minier is 10 times the designer that

[14:21] John Papaduke is and that Raza's just not worth it.

[14:24] They're going to realize that.

[14:26] Because you're going to see Raza.

[14:28] You've seen Raza.

[14:29] You've seen it at Houston.

[14:31] And you're going to see guns and roses and it's just going to be laughable.

[14:34] It's going to be laughable.

[14:35] The difference between a hardworking humble man who has no ego and that's Eric Minier versus

[14:42] John Papaduke, a man who's got a huge ego who thinks he knows everything about pinball.

[14:46] And it's like, that's great John if you can prove it, but he can't prove it.

[14:50] And all we have is PowerPoint slides.

[14:52] So one company, they're great at creating PowerPoint slides.

[14:56] Another company is great at making pinball machines.

[14:59] And that is this episode of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[15:02] I think it's pathetic that all we're getting are PowerPoint slides.

[15:07] And we're still getting to spin.

[15:09] The spin, the spin, the spin.

[15:11] Where's the game guys?

[15:12] Where is the game?

[15:14] Is it crazy for me to want to see this game in action?

[15:17] Where's the game?

[15:18] And the deep six that went down there, the deep six that went down there.

[15:22] And I listened to Lauren Gray's podcast with Crystal and I could barely make it through

[15:26] it.

[15:27] And I could barely make it through that podcast because it's like, you listen to them.

[15:31] They acted like they had a great, amazing time.

[15:33] You didn't go down there to have text, mechs, lunches with people.

[15:37] That's not why you went down there.

[15:39] You went down there to see a pinball machine.

[15:42] And they talk about everything but the pinball machine.

[15:45] And that is a really sad state of affairs is when you've got pinball content creators.

[15:51] And I'm one of them.

[15:52] And the reason we're here is to talk about the pinball machines and you get them like

[15:56] glowing about the people who cares about the people.

[16:00] It's the machines that matter.

[16:02] This isn't like going down there to sink in by yawn and have text mechs lunch.

[16:06] You went down there for a pinball reveal.

[16:09] And they're still hiding behind that fact because here's what I know.

[16:13] They walked into a room and they saw a raza that wasn't really functioning and they don't

[16:18] want to say it.

[16:19] And they want to hide behind it and they want to keep it secret.

[16:22] But it's not a secret.

[16:24] We know you did not see a fully functioning machine and you should just come out and

[16:30] say it.

[16:31] All of you six, you deep six.

[16:32] You know who you are.

[16:34] You know who you are.

[16:35] Like freedom awaits.

[16:36] And here's the thing.

[16:37] You're going to be liberated all six of you are going to be liberated Monday when guns

[16:43] and roses is revealed because then it's over.

[16:46] It's over.

[16:47] It's over.

[16:48] It's over.

[16:49] You're going to realize you don't need a pinball.

[16:50] You don't need an auto-leveler.

[16:52] You don't need J-pop trying to do crazy rams that don't really work.

[16:56] You don't need all this stuff.

[16:58] You just need a good pinball machine.

[17:00] They didn't spend millions of dollars on the animations in G&R.

[17:03] They put the money into the game and the game is incredible.

[17:07] And that's what we want from pinball.

[17:09] So that's Canadian Spinball podcast rant.

[17:12] I'm sorry.

[17:13] I just can't take deep root sharing PowerPoint slides with me.

[17:17] I'm sorry.

[17:18] I take offense to that.

[17:19] Steve Bowden, what are you doing?

[17:21] What are you doing?

[17:22] I'm meeting you are a math teacher.

[17:24] At some point aren't you saying the mathematics of this don't work out.

[17:29] If we shipped zero games this year, how does that math work out, Steve?

[17:33] You know this more than anyone.

[17:35] What is the math tell you?

[17:37] And you said stuff and you were up there, Steve.

[17:40] When you said you were going to ship more games in any manufacturer in one year.

[17:44] And at what point does everyone who's attached to that ship become accountable for those

[17:49] statements?

[17:50] I'm serious.

[17:52] At what point do they become accountable for what they stood up there and said and the

[17:56] disrespect that was for the rest of the companies out there who are actually working hard

[18:01] and making games?

[18:03] That's all I'm saying.

[18:05] Give us a game, guys.

[18:07] Give us a game.

[18:08] Not this stuff.

[18:10] Not PowerPoint.

[18:11] Later.
