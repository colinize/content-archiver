[00:00] Puff the Magic Dragon, Live by the Sea, And Frolicked in the Autumn Mist, In a Land Called Honolene.

[00:12] Happy New Year's Eve everybody!

[00:18] Is Stern smoking that Puff the Magic Dragon 700 D&D LEs is what I'm hearing?

[00:27] People are not giving me credit for that on Pinsight, it doesn't matter.

[00:30] We're right around the corner, it's almost 2025 and do we think on this New Year's Eve

[00:35] today Stern Pimball is going to announce Dungeons and Dragons the Worst Kept Secret in Pimball.

[00:43] Will 700 LEs sell at $13,000?

[00:47] Will there be enough magic in this game to justify the price?

[00:51] Let's talk about that on this episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[00:54] I'm actually naming this episode,

[00:57] Canada plays DA on D&D, not dead on arrival, but devil's advocate on this game.

[01:05] I know what you're all thinking, you're like,

[01:06] Canada don't do it, don't shell the machine for a Stern Pimball,

[01:10] but I just want to say when you really step back and think about it, Dungeons and Dragons could make for an amazing Pimball experience.

[01:21] It also will never justify the prices that Pimball is currently at,

[01:27] because at these prices the unfortunate thing for each and every one of us is unless it's a triple A theme,

[01:34] nothing feels like you should buy it right now.

[01:37] And we're going to talk about that.

[01:39] Now I also want to say I hope you all enjoyed the end of the year, Canada Kudos Awards.

[01:46] I saw some loser on Pimball Enthusiasts wrote this huge paragraph,

[01:51] someone sent it to me because I'm banned from Pimball Enthusiasts,

[01:53] being like, how dare this guy claim he's a great marketer,

[01:58] and then he releases this terrible award show with a crappy PowerPoint,

[02:04] and the fonts are going off the screen because when I moved it over to my wife's computer,

[02:10] she did not have my fonts.

[02:12] Let me just tell you this right now.

[02:13] That show is just going to be a podcast.

[02:16] I decided an hour before to make a few slides to go along with the damn Saturday morning

[02:22] spectacular, which I never do anything like that ever,

[02:25] and we still have so many people who follow every single week.

[02:29] So if you think that that's an indication of my marketing skills,

[02:34] I don't know what's wrong with people.

[02:35] You know, there's so many joyless losers in the world that are not waking up in a good mood,

[02:41] but Canadians live in rent-free in their head because obviously that guy watched the show.

[02:48] All right, everybody.

[02:49] So we gave Jaws Game of the Year, and I think in summary of 2024,

[02:53] as we are on New Year's Eve, let's all face it, there were 14 games, and there wasn't one.

[03:01] Really one.

[03:02] Triple A, take my money now theme in the entire Pimball world.

[03:07] Jaws was the best theme that was out,

[03:10] but it's still like how many of you do you all own Jaws Pimball machines?

[03:14] It still did not light the Pimball world on fire,

[03:17] and it wasn't a theme that actually is perfect for Pimball.

[03:21] I don't know.

[03:21] It's an okay theme for Pimball going shark hunting,

[03:24] but it didn't really light the Pimball world on fire the way games like,

[03:29] I don't know, like Guns N' Roses sold way better,

[03:32] Godzilla sold way better, games like Ghostbusters sold better,

[03:36] games like Metallica sold maybe just as hot as Jaws.

[03:40] So look, you know, all of these companies, all of the market research that is available

[03:46] is not utilized, and we end up with themes like that.

[03:50] The good news is, as we head into 2025, I don't think we're going to have that problem.

[03:55] I think we're going to have a plethora of great themes this year.

[03:59] We're seeing stuff like Harry Potter, Gremlins, Goonies.

[04:03] I don't know if Back to the Future is going to be ready.

[04:05] Probably not.

[04:06] Stuff like the Matrix, Super Mario Brothers.

[04:09] We've got stuff like maybe Predator from Pimball Brothers.

[04:12] We've got other things coming out.

[04:14] I don't know.

[04:14] What's Barrels of Fun game?

[04:15] Is it Gremlins?

[04:16] What's going to be next?

[04:17] We know Sonic the Hedgehog might come out.

[04:20] Now we do know that the first game introducing us,

[04:23] oh, I forgot, King Kong, the first game introducing us into 2025

[04:28] is going to be Dungeons and Dragons from Stern Pimball.

[04:32] Now let's talk about this for a minute because this title is really being like

[04:38] blasted as not a great theme for Pimball.

[04:41] I think a lot of people think this game is going to be dead on arrival.

[04:45] They think that this game will be a sales flop.

[04:48] They think it's going to be the next Venom.

[04:50] They think it's a theme that most people did not ask for.

[04:53] Now look, on the surface, you're not wrong.

[04:57] Dungeons and Dragons, if you're trying to sell Pimball machines,

[05:02] to people that are 40 to 60 years old who have disposable income,

[05:07] a lot of disposable income now at these prices,

[05:11] this is not where I would land the plane.

[05:14] To give you a little bit of the backstory on why Stern Pimball is making this game,

[05:19] I know how this theme arrived at Stern Pimball.

[05:23] And it wasn't because George and Seth wanted to make D&D.

[05:27] Hasbro went to Stern.

[05:30] Hasbro is the IP holder of D&D and they went to Stern and they wanted to make this game.

[05:38] And so that is how this worked.

[05:41] And maybe Stern wants access to other Hasbro titles.

[05:45] I believe it's Hasbro, right?

[05:46] It's not Mattel.

[05:47] I didn't get this wrong.

[05:48] I didn't Google this before, but I'm really pretty positive it's Hasbro.

[05:53] And so I think that is why they're making this game.

[05:56] And maybe this is going to open the door for Stern to make more Mattel titles.

[06:02] Maybe one of them, I think, or no, did I say Mattel?

[06:04] More Hasbro titles.

[06:06] Maybe one of them is going to be He-Man.

[06:08] Is that Hasbro?

[06:09] Maybe it's going to be another Transformers game.

[06:12] Maybe it's going to be other stuff in the Hasbro sort of portfolio.

[06:16] So that is why they're making D&D.

[06:19] Now, everyone's like, this game's going to flop.

[06:22] It's going to be the next Venom.

[06:24] It's got Dwight on code.

[06:27] It's got Brian Eddy, who really hasn't had a hit-hit game.

[06:31] Stranger Things bailed them out because it is Stranger Things.

[06:35] And the UV mode is so cool.

[06:37] But for the most part, remember when Stranger Things came out, everybody?

[06:41] Remember the response to that game?

[06:44] And so Venom was a flop.

[06:45] Mandalorian didn't do really well.

[06:48] And so here we are.

[06:50] Brian Eddy, the guy we've been waiting for.

[06:53] Is he finally going to bring some of his magic from the Bally Williams days to Stern Pinball?

[07:00] Now look, think about it.

[07:02] Dungeons and Dragons.

[07:04] If there ever was a theme that opened the door or lowered the drawbridge for the spiritual successor

[07:12] to a little game that is still to this day ranked the third best pinball machine of all time

[07:20] with over 2,200 consumer reviews.

[07:24] This has more reviews than Godzilla, than Jurassic Park.

[07:28] Most people in pinball think that medieval madness is the best pinball machine ever made.

[07:36] It is currently number three on the pinside top 100.

[07:40] So if you think about D&D as a theme, it is the perfect spiritual successor to medieval madness.

[07:49] Is Brian Eddy and our Dwight and the team over at Stern, are they going to make a game that is worthy

[07:57] to be sort of like the spiritual sequel to medieval madness?

[08:01] I mean, think about it.

[08:02] You've got castles.

[08:03] You've got dungeons.

[08:05] You've got wizards.

[08:06] You've got dragons.

[08:07] You've got all these different people like knights and orcs and all the stuff that happens in a

[08:13] medieval fantasy world is in the world of D&D.

[08:18] A big question mark for you and me is what is it based on?

[08:23] Is it based on the Dungeons and Dragons movie that just came out that was actually critically

[08:29] acclaimed but did not do that well at the box office?

[08:33] I've seen the movie.

[08:35] It's really good, but it's not the kind of movie I'm going to watch over and over and over again.

[08:40] I think it was just like really surprising how good that movie was, but again, it's not a movie

[08:47] that's become iconic.

[08:49] It's not a movie that you want to own a pinball machine, especially one that's this expensive

[08:54] and put it in your game room.

[08:56] I think the best indication that it's not a movie that's ready for a pinball sort of treatment,

[09:01] it's not a movie that you quote lines from over and over again.

[09:06] It's not a movie that you remember scenes from over and over again.

[09:10] And so that begs the question, is it going to be based on the 80s cartoon of D&D?

[09:15] Or is it going to be an all original D&D journey that's going to be animated by stern pinballs,

[09:23] coding and software team?

[09:25] So a lot of big question marks there.

[09:27] And I think where this gets challenging now is there really is no version of D&D that really

[09:35] seems like they should charge us as much money as they would for stuff like James Bond when

[09:42] you have all the assets or stuff like Godzilla or Jaws.

[09:47] And so Dungeons & Dragons following up the monstrous release of Metallica LE is this title

[09:56] going to be something that people buy on day one.

[09:58] Now I just want to say playing devil's advocate, I think this game is going to be loaded.

[10:05] I think it's going to be loaded with mechanisms and stuff we haven't seen in a long time from

[10:11] stern pinball.

[10:12] I think this game has been in development longer than most games.

[10:16] And that's why it was delayed.

[10:19] I don't think they removed anything from this game.

[10:21] I do think this is the game that Keith Elwin looked at and said, oh my gosh,

[10:28] we're making one of the most amazing, biggest, like craziest mechs stern pinball has ever made.

[10:34] I think what's going to be in D&D is going to embarrass even the building in Godzilla that we

[10:41] all went crazy for.

[10:42] So I think this game is going to feature mechs, mechs, mechs.

[10:47] I think it's going to have a lot of toys in it.

[10:50] I think it's going to make other stuff in the pinball world of recent release look barren and

[10:56] empty.

[10:57] I think stern pinball knows they need to load this game up.

[11:02] I had a phone conversation with Seth Davis.

[11:04] He said the next two cornerstones, Chris, have a lot more creative stuff in them than we've ever

[11:11] done before.

[11:13] So if that doesn't get you excited, I don't know what will.

[11:16] And the thing is this, now all of a sudden you start to realize like if they can make a game,

[11:22] load it with fun toys.

[11:24] A subject matter very similar to medieval madness.

[11:28] Why couldn't they, if you think about it, make a game that's going to be just amazingly fun

[11:36] pinball experience, load it with a world under glass and make it in a way that makes replay

[11:43] value and jumping on it fun time and time again.

[11:47] Now the thing they need to nail and if you go watch gameplay of medieval madness, what's the

[11:52] one thing they really need to nail?

[11:55] They need to nail the campiness, the fun and the personality.

[12:00] I think that's the word I'm looking for, the personality in the game.

[12:05] Medieval madness, when you listen to those callouts, it is so embarrassing how good those callouts

[12:11] are in that game.

[12:13] Have you played a pinball machine since medieval madness?

[12:17] I mean this.

[12:17] In the last four years, does any game have any callouts that are nearly as good as the callouts

[12:25] in medieval madness?

[12:26] And then you ask yourself, what's going on in pinball?

[12:29] Why can't we get more energy, more personality, more liveliness into these games?

[12:36] Right?

[12:37] You want to make it feel like something totally awesome for this much money.

[12:43] You should be laughing out loud when you play your machines.

[12:47] You should hear things that you didn't think you were going to hear that make you laugh.

[12:51] And I mean this.

[12:52] When they do new code updates, why don't these companies insert callouts that are actually

[12:59] like reflective of stuff that's maybe happened in the world or stuff that's happened in the

[13:05] pinball world that would just be really funny?

[13:09] Like imagine turning on your D&D game and there's like a court jester character and he's like,

[13:15] wow, like look at this game.

[13:16] It's got a lot more toys in it than that new avatar game.

[13:20] You know, enjoy your new stern pinball machine.

[13:23] Like why don't they do anything like that?

[13:25] There's like no comedy dialed in that's actually like breaking the third wall and actually doing

[13:33] something unexpected.

[13:35] And I think these companies need to wake up because the opportunity to take this 13 or

[13:41] seven to $13,000 humongous box of lights and speakers and toys, you can make it do almost

[13:50] anything with callouts.

[13:51] Right?

[13:52] There is no barrier to saying something funny in a pinball machine and we just need more of it.

[13:59] And so then I get a little nervous because the guy coding this machine is Dwight.

[14:06] And I'm just not sure that Dwight punches personality into his games.

[14:12] Whenever I hear him talk about games, he really approaches them in terms of like how to score

[14:20] and how to multiply your scoring and how to stack things and stack modes.

[14:26] And then I get really nervous because if Dwight, the king of stacking and multiplying,

[14:33] is now in charge of a game with a 20 sided die and it's like a role playing game like D&D.

[14:41] And he's got like that role playing mindset.

[14:44] You might argue that he's perfect and he probably is, but you might also be a little bit nervous

[14:50] that he's going to go overboard and make this game overly complex,

[14:55] which in my honest opinion is what's making a lot of modern pinball not fun.

[15:01] Too much modern pinball is overly complex.

[15:04] The rulesets are ridiculous.

[15:07] I don't want to know or need to know all of this stuff to enjoy the game to its fullest.

[15:13] And again, go play the original medieval madness.

[15:17] You don't need some stupid rule book to understand how to play the game.

[15:23] It's all pretty straightforward.

[15:26] The inserts tell you like how to progress through the game.

[15:30] The callouts do.

[15:31] It's not hard to understand.

[15:34] And even if you don't even know what you're doing,

[15:37] you're going to get a lot of satisfaction from bashing the castle,

[15:42] putting the ball in the catapult, all the different shots like go somewhere or do something fun.

[15:48] And that's what we need.

[15:50] And I think this game could have that.

[15:52] Remember, stern pinball has got the best flippers and pinball.

[15:55] They got the best gameplay feel.

[15:57] And so, you know, here we are on the eve of this game.

[16:02] Now, the biggest problem in, you know, getting excited about this game,

[16:08] and I'm trying to get you excited about this game,

[16:10] because I want pinball to be exciting.

[16:13] Every pinball machine that comes out, I want to buy it.

[16:17] I want to own it.

[16:18] I want to feel like they did something so awesome that I just have to have it.

[16:23] You know, look at Evil Dead.

[16:25] It's awesome.

[16:25] Like there's so much awesome stuff in that game.

[16:28] I just don't want it because of the theme.

[16:31] I can't get over the theme.

[16:32] I'm just not into those kinds of movies.

[16:33] And I know that about myself.

[16:35] And so that's fine.

[16:36] I'll wait because Spooky Pinball is making Goonies next.

[16:40] And I just watched Goonies movie.

[16:43] It's amazing.

[16:44] It's going to make for an amazing pinball machine.

[16:46] And the big pirate ship is going to be awesome.

[16:49] They know it's next.

[16:51] They know they're working on it.

[16:52] And that's why they won't tell us that they're not working on Goonies,

[16:56] because Goonies is next.

[16:58] And so when that happens, the only thing I ask of Spooky Pinball,

[17:02] and I know other people keep asking this,

[17:04] stop using so many servos, and your games will be much more reliable.

[17:11] Okay, here we go, people.

[17:12] So they're going to make 700 LEDs.

[17:15] I think Stern is lost now.

[17:18] Like, they're just guessing on how many LEDs they should be making.

[17:22] I don't like 700, because now you've got some random number of LEDs

[17:27] that you haven't done before.

[17:28] Just do 500.

[17:30] Like, stop.

[17:31] Just do 500.

[17:33] 700 D&D at $13,000.

[17:36] The problem is this.

[17:37] Is the premium is going to be the same exact game as the LE.

[17:41] And it's $3,000 cheaper or more if they price increase

[17:45] a little bit.

[17:46] I don't think they're going to.

[17:47] I think it's going to be 13,700 units.

[17:51] But again, why would you buy one?

[17:53] Do you really think D&D LE is ever going to hold any value?

[17:59] And why buy one for 13?

[18:02] Also, we know that Harry Potter, I didn't even mention Harry Potter.

[18:06] That's around the corner.

[18:07] That's coming out in February, March.

[18:10] And I know that they switched the order.

[18:12] So Stern now wants to have King Kong ready to go against Harry Potter.

[18:19] That is why Kong got moved after D&D.

[18:22] It was going to come out before.

[18:24] Okay, it's ready to go.

[18:26] Kong is ready to go.

[18:27] And so as excited as we always get to see a new pinball machine,

[18:32] there's nothing exciting about the fact that they're going to want this much money.

[18:37] For what is obviously going to be another hugely depreciating game.

[18:42] And every single game is depreciated.

[18:44] So what's going to make this any different?

[18:46] Right?

[18:47] What is going to make this any different?

[18:48] There's no way D&D is ever going to have the same amount of love as James Bond or Jaws.

[18:56] James Bond has lost a ton of value.

[18:59] Foo Fighters has a huge fan base.

[19:00] Those games lost a ton of value.

[19:03] John Wick, I don't even have to tell you about that in Venom.

[19:06] So is D&D more popular than a Marvel theme like X-Men?

[19:11] No, but look at what happened to those games.

[19:14] And so I would love to say that D&D can somehow find a way past all of those barriers

[19:23] and the hesitation to running into a new and box purchase.

[19:27] But I just have to tell you, as much as I'm excited for this game,

[19:31] and I think this game could be awesome,

[19:33] almost no game now can be awesome enough to justify buying a new and box on day one.

[19:41] Unless you know, it's got crazy demand like Metallica did.

[19:45] And I don't think this is going to have that.

[19:47] I really don't.

[19:49] I think it's going to excite us.

[19:51] I think because expectations are so low, this game will exceed our expectations.

[19:57] But I also think there's going to be a sobering reality.

[20:00] If you just wait, I still see D&D LE going from 13 to 10 grand in less than six months,

[20:08] regardless of how great the game is.

[20:10] I mean that regardless, because 10k is what an LE should cost.

[20:15] It's what the market says LEs should be valued at.

[20:19] And that is why every single secondhand LE, every single LE other than JAWS,

[20:25] is selling for 10,000 or less.

[20:28] And then obviously Metallica is an anomaly.

[20:31] And that's just a whole other thing, right?

[20:33] Whenever they do these remakes of classic iconic games, yeah, all bets are off.

[20:38] Like if it was Lord of the Rings or Tron, you know, those games would be worth like

[20:42] 15 to 20 grand if they only made 500.

[20:45] But those again are anomaly titles, not cornerstones.

[20:48] Remember, Metallica remastered is not a cornerstone.

[20:52] And so that's where we're at in Pimbal.

[20:54] So I would encourage each and every one of you to not buy this game this week.

[20:59] Just wait it out.

[21:00] Trust me, it's never, never, never going to be hard to get.

[21:04] And it's never going to go up in value.

[21:07] And once you know that you have enough willpower now to just avoid it,

[21:12] I also think Stern waited too long.

[21:14] Let me explain this.

[21:15] What have you all been doing the last week?

[21:17] I've been drinking a lot of booze.

[21:19] I've been eating a lot of food.

[21:21] I haven't been thinking like a responsible adult.

[21:25] It's the holidays, right?

[21:26] I went out with Brenda.

[21:27] I'll be honest, I went out with Brenda, spoiled my baby girl.

[21:30] We went out for lunch.

[21:31] I had a few espresso martinis.

[21:33] We walked into Tiffany's next door.

[21:35] And I was supposed to just pick up something.

[21:37] I bought her and then I ended up buying her another piece of jewelry

[21:41] that cost as much as a Stern LE.

[21:44] So there goes my Pimbal purchase for the next few months.

[21:47] It went to something for my beautiful wife.

[21:50] And that is it, man.

[21:51] That's the holidays for you.

[21:53] That's the holidays for everybody.

[21:54] We're all out there.

[21:56] We're drinking.

[21:56] We're spending money.

[21:57] We're making impulse purchases.

[21:59] And we're spending a lot.

[22:01] And come January 6th, the week of January 6th,

[22:04] the week that Stern Pimbal is going to show this game at CES,

[22:09] the week the media are going to spend their own money

[22:12] to go to Stern Pimbal, that is going to be a week

[22:15] that each and every one of us looks at our checking account

[22:19] and realizes the damage that has happened.

[22:22] And we're most likely going to tighten the wallet, right?

[22:26] We're going to close the wallet.

[22:28] There's a reason why people do dry January.

[22:30] Stop wanting to drink as much.

[22:32] You want to eat a little bit better.

[22:33] You want to make a New Year's resolution.

[22:35] And here's the thing.

[22:36] Here's a good New Year's resolution.

[22:38] Stop losing money on Pimbal.

[22:41] Stop losing thousands of dollars

[22:44] and chasing these high-priced, new-in-box games.

[22:48] And these companies will lower prices.

[22:51] It's that simple, people.

[22:53] I have more subscribers than they're making of LEs.

[22:57] And look, I would love to tell you, go in on one.

[23:00] For like the first seven years of my show,

[23:03] I would tell you to go in on every LE because you couldn't lose.

[23:06] It was the safest bet in all of Pimbal

[23:09] to grab every single LE that came out.

[23:12] The worst-case scenario, you would sell it for MSRP.

[23:16] The best-case scenario, you would make a bunch of money.

[23:20] It was a win-win.

[23:21] Now it's nothing but a lose, people.

[23:24] Just wait it out, everybody.

[23:26] Happy New Year.

[23:27] I hope you guys have a great, great New Year's Eve.

[23:31] I always find it a little bit depressing, like New Year's Eve.

[23:34] Like, I haven't stayed up to midnight in 20 years.

[23:37] When you're young, it's fun, but I'm just tired.

[23:40] I really am.

[23:41] All you parents out there,

[23:42] you're surviving the holidays a little bit with your kids,

[23:45] especially if you have young kids.

[23:46] I love it so much.

[23:47] I love spending every moment with my boys and my wife

[23:51] and my sister-in-law is here.

[23:53] But man, these are long, long days, everybody.

[23:56] But you know what?

[23:57] They're long enough that I can get a podcast out at 6.30

[24:00] in the morning.

[24:01] Everybody, be good.

[24:02] I'll talk to you soon.

[24:03] Up the magic dragon,

[24:07] live by the sea

[24:10] and product in the autumn mist

[24:13] in a land called Hanali.
