[00:00] This used to be a fun house, but now it's full of evil clowns.

[00:09] It's time to start the countdown.

[00:13] I'm gonna burn it down.

[00:19] Oh, welcome to Canada's Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] It's 5.15 in the morning.

[00:23] I am without sleep.

[00:25] What is sleep?

[00:26] What is time when Canada's a new daddy?

[00:28] Mama and baby are doing great.

[00:31] They just had to spend another night over in the hospital.

[00:35] There's this little thing called jaundice where like basically the baby gets to go sun tanning for like a day and a half.

[00:40] Get that good foundation going.

[00:43] A true son of Canada, you know, fake, fake before the summertime rolls around.

[00:47] Everyone's doing great.

[00:49] They're gonna come home today.

[00:50] And if you think I'm a terrible husband because I'm not sleeping in the hospital,

[00:55] just so you know, NYU is around the block from where we live.

[00:59] So even Brenda's like, go home and get a good night's sleep because you're not gonna have it for the next 16 years.

[01:07] All right.

[01:07] So let's talk about fun house from Padready Gaming.

[01:11] Let's go around the horn and talk about what's going on with these pinball companies.

[01:15] And here's the thing.

[01:16] I want to start out this show by saying something.

[01:18] There are people in this community who say that Canada is toxic.

[01:23] He never does anything good for the pinball community.

[01:26] He never gets positive changes in pinball.

[01:29] And I just saw, remember a few weeks ago when I said that Jersey Jack pinball for all this money and all the intelligent people over there,

[01:39] nobody stood over in Elton John C.E. and looked up at the ceiling and said, hey, it's projecting all the logos upside down.

[01:50] And when I said that and I made a big stink about it, everybody said, shut up, Canada.

[01:55] You're an idiot.

[01:56] It rotates around.

[01:57] You don't know what you're talking about.

[02:00] And then I wake up this morning to a service bulletin from Jersey Jack pinball going out to all of its C.E. owners of Elton John,

[02:10] explaining to them how to turn the projector upside down.

[02:16] So don't you tell me that Canada doesn't do any good for this pinball hobby.

[02:22] This was going to be the hedge multi bar.

[02:25] Remember, I got spooky pinball focusing on this.

[02:29] I got spooky pinball to change their play fields.

[02:32] And this is why we have 6.1.

[02:35] Twippies and also speaking of Twippies, did you see what the clown Colin has done recently?

[02:42] You know, we all used to love this weekend pinball and they amassed like 7,000 followers or something on like Facebook.

[02:50] And what Colin did, I don't even know why Facebook let him do this.

[02:54] He was allowed to roll over those followers from this week in pinball, a site we all used to love into followers for the

[03:03] Kinetis and now he's bragging that those numbers are great.

[03:08] Colin, you're not fooling anybody.

[03:11] You did not earn any of this.

[03:14] This is not how it works.

[03:16] Your click bait site is not going to work.

[03:19] None of us are big fans of the Kinetis and that is why we all unsubscribe to this weekend pinball.

[03:26] You're never going to make any money doing this because the only way you make money when you want to make pinball content is

[03:32] it's one word, talent.

[03:35] You need talent, bro.

[03:37] You can't hide.

[03:38] Alright, so here we are.

[03:39] We got Fun House Pinball from Padready Gaming.

[03:43] It came out at like noon Eastern Standard Time.

[03:46] What do we think about this game, about the launch and then let's talk about what else is happening in pinball.

[03:51] You know, all the John Wick apologists are coming out of the Woodworks people.

[03:55] The Stern Army, all the fanboys of Timmy Sexton going to start coming out and say,

[04:01] hey, the game plays fun and fast.

[04:03] That's the greatest thing I love is when these people come out and they're like shocked that a fan layout with Stern Flippers is going to play fast.

[04:11] But let's go back to Fun House.

[04:13] So the game is revealed.

[04:14] There's 750.

[04:16] All of the details about this game you got from Kinetis and the game is out there.

[04:20] Now, why I was a little bit surprised to see the sheer number of distributors and dealers like spamming me once again with Facebook ads.

[04:29] Now, I think what happened was this, they were originally going to have 500.

[04:33] I think Nick Parks was going to have 400 of them in the US and then the European distributors were going to get 100 of these.

[04:40] They up that number to 750.

[04:44] I'm also probably 100% confident in this that Nick Parks is allocating games to the dealers that are out there.

[04:53] I saw all the regular dealers like spamming me with Fun House ads on day one and that's fine.

[05:00] They're dealers.

[05:01] I expect that they're trying to sell it.

[05:04] But here's the thing about this launch.

[05:06] I wish I just wish we had yesterday and it's a wish of Kinetis.

[05:11] When a game gets revealed to the world on day one and we saw this with John Wick and now we're seeing it again with this game.

[05:19] It's not enough anymore to just release the details and the photos.

[05:25] This is a very interactive toy and you've made major changes to it.

[05:30] Padready, right?

[05:31] All the inserts now are white, right?

[05:33] They don't look colorful like the original game.

[05:36] Those white inserts are going to look amazing when they're fully lit up with all the full color RGB lighting.

[05:44] Now, here's the problem.

[05:45] On launch day, did you see Fun House LE lit up in all of its glory?

[05:51] No, you didn't.

[05:52] Did you see a video?

[05:53] No, you didn't.

[05:54] And so that is what disappointed me about yesterday's launch is like you've done all these things to the game and you're not showing it.

[06:02] Now, part of me thinks they're probably a little bit nervous about people's reaction to Rudy's voice with Fun House 2.0 Rudy's Nightmare.

[06:12] Because the reception to that code update was never really phenomenal.

[06:18] So, Canada being always a little bit skeptical about all the marketing that happens in pinball because it's usually terrible.

[06:25] I kind of feel like they did it like this on purpose, that they wanted to reveal this game this way and make all the dealers buy their allotments.

[06:35] See, that's the thing about yesterday.

[06:37] All we learned yesterday is who's already bought this game and they're the dealers.

[06:43] And this is the model of pinball and I still to this day am not sure this is how these products should work.

[06:51] And so all of these dealers now have to commit to a certain number of games and buy them from Pedretti and probably Nick Parks.

[06:58] And I think that's Nick Parks' face on the translate.

[07:02] There's a lot of Easter eggs but I saw some gentlemen, a man with a great set of hair and it looked just like Nick Parks.

[07:08] As far as the game itself, I think it looks really neat.

[07:11] I think it looks really cool.

[07:12] Obviously, this LD looks much better than the original Fun House.

[07:17] When you see those two games next to each other, it's night and day which one looks a lot better.

[07:22] There's really one huge caveat and if you go on the marketplace, this Fun House was a game.

[07:28] You could easily obtain it for like $4,000 to $5,000.

[07:32] You know, maybe it got up around $6,000 during the height of COVID.

[07:36] But there's a lot of these games out there.

[07:39] There's not a ton but there's a lot, right?

[07:41] And I think Fun House is a very popular game.

[07:44] It's a Pat Lawler game.

[07:45] It's a game when you look at all the mechanical stuff in it, it embarrasses what's in a $13,000 John Wick.

[07:53] It embarrasses mechanically what's in an Elton John.

[07:56] But you know, we don't like to think like that anymore, right?

[07:59] You got to stay focused on the present Pimball Machines, Chris, that are hoodwinking us with artwork, LCD stuff and LED lights.

[08:06] So as a package, this game is really nice.

[08:10] Now, I still think it's a huge miss not to have video of the game.

[08:15] I would not see enough yet to pull a trigger on the game because I need to see it all together.

[08:21] I need to see how it works.

[08:22] I mean, there are people out there that are saying, you know, the Fun House 2.0 kit is not the best.

[08:27] It's kind of buggy.

[08:28] It's kind of laggy.

[08:29] Rudy's voice doesn't work for me.

[08:31] So I want to see it all together.

[08:33] There's no FOMO around this game, though.

[08:35] Does anyone out there think that if you want a Fun House LE, you've got to order it today or this week or this month?

[08:44] I just don't feel that anymore about anything.

[08:47] It's going to happen again.

[08:48] We're going to get another FOMO game.

[08:51] It's going to have to be something like Harry Potter, The Matrix, Back to the Future.

[08:57] But unless it's one of those triple A bangers, everything's going to be easy to get whenever you want to get it.

[09:04] And these dealers are going to be really anxious to get you the game.

[09:08] I was thinking about this the other day.

[09:10] You know, I was thinking about this whole pinball world.

[09:12] When you have lack of sleep, maybe I'm getting a lack of oxygen to the brain.

[09:17] But I just started to think about this hobby and I started to think about the word dealer and what it means to be a pinball dealer.

[09:25] And the word itself, dealer, means you go to them for a deal.

[09:29] And here's what's weird about all the pinball right now in my mind as I watch John Wick sales, flatline, and people making excuses is a dealer in pinball doesn't really have any ability to create a deal.

[09:44] They can't deal with you.

[09:46] They can only deal one way, right?

[09:48] They can only deal at MSRP or above and maybe they'll throw in some free shipping.

[09:53] But that's it.

[09:54] There's no deals being made anywhere in pinball.

[09:57] And I think that needs to change.

[09:59] And I think all of this hobby and the entire landscape of pinball and the dealerships and the distros and the manufacturers, I think we're going through a period now in which there's going to be a lot of inflection on what this hobby can do differently to save itself.

[10:15] To save itself from the issues it's experiencing right now, which is there is an oversupply of everything.

[10:22] The demand is going down because the prices are so high and you're forcing your dealers and your distros to behave in a way that doesn't allow them to make a deal.

[10:34] And if you think about it, if you're sitting on a Venom LE from a year ago, how can you not be able to make a deal on that game?

[10:44] We still got to list that game for $13,000 and we need to stop this.

[10:50] It's so stupid to me that a dealer pays for this thing in full.

[10:55] A dealer buys this game from Stern Pinball for so much money and then they're not allowed to do what they want to do with it even after they've owned it for a year.

[11:06] Even after they've seen the used market on the game tank, they still are at the mercy of Stern who's been paid in full what they wanted for the game a year ago.

[11:15] Stern has those dealers and those distros money for an entire year and you bet your bottom dollar that Stern has taken that money from those distros and dealers and has invested it into areas of growth where the dealer and the distros sitting on a sinking asset can't do anything.

[11:34] That is the mafia, ladies and gentlemen. Stern Pinball operates like they are the mob and that is why on my very expletive show, I'm like F off Stern.

[11:46] I'm going to say this right now. I am not buying another Stern machine at these prices ever.

[11:51] I'm just going to say it right now. Ever. I'm not going in on anything ever from Stern ever again at these prices.

[11:58] I don't care how dream theme it is. I'm not doing it because I know that at these prices, everything's going down in value.

[12:06] Everything G1 transformers, Akira, everything. I'm not buying it. I'm not buying it.

[12:12] And you know what? It's funny when I adopt this sort of mentality. I feel liberated. Like cool.

[12:17] It doesn't mean I'm not going to buy another Stern ever again. I'm just not buying another Stern at these prices and that's going to be the line I draw in the sand for myself.

[12:26] Now you do what you want to do. I'm not going to get up here and tell you, you should do the same thing. Just be like me.

[12:31] If we hold the line, we're going to force them to lower the prices, which is not false.

[12:35] We will as a community force them to lower prices if we stop buying Stern machines.

[12:40] So speaking of stop buying Stern machines, like John Wick is out, right?

[12:44] John Wick's been out now. It feels like it's been out for like six months after all of the back and forth around this game.

[12:50] It is now popping up on location and we're getting early feedback that a fan layout Stern machine with the most snappy flippers and pinball is really fun.

[13:02] The balltimes are really short and this is a fast, brutal game that you have to hold on for dear life when you play it.

[13:09] And everyone's like, that's awesome. And guess what? Cool. I'm glad.

[13:12] Another Stern fan layout that has a lot of speed. I could go play Black Knight.

[13:17] There's a whole series of Stern machines that play this way. And it's cool. I can't wait to play one on location.

[13:22] I really can't. I can't wait to go to Jack Barr. If I have any free time after Cassian comes home, if I have any free time, I will go play John Wick Pro.

[13:31] I'm never buying one. I'm never buying one. I'm never buying this game. And again, the thing is this, it just doesn't speak to me.

[13:36] I don't see the effort there. I don't see the magic in the game. I'm not buying one at 13. I'm not buying an LE at 10.

[13:42] I wouldn't buy an LE for eight. I just don't want the game. That's how I am. It's okay, people.

[13:47] It's okay to feel like you never want to own something, but you just want to enjoy it on location.

[13:53] But you know, it's interesting when I'm looking at Pinside and I go to the John Wick Owners Club and I know none of these have shipped to owners yet.

[14:01] But man, it is pretty bleak in there. I haven't really seen a Stern Owners Club.

[14:07] After a game being out for over a week, doesn't even have two pages of conversation on Pinside.

[14:14] Because remember, they've been taking orders on this game now for like a week and a half.

[14:20] And the fact that on Pinside, there are not even more than one page of people communicating that they bought one.

[14:29] And here's one of the reasons why. It doesn't mean Stern hasn't sold any.

[14:32] I don't think anyone wants to admit they bought a John Wick LE.

[14:37] Because if you admit right now that you bought a John Wick LE, you might as well wear a t-shirt that says,

[14:43] Dummy, like you're a dummy. Like you just lost three to four thousand dollars.

[14:49] And no one's ever going to think you're cool or you made the right decision.

[14:52] And that saddens me because all the years when FOMA was good and we were buying all these Stern LEs,

[14:58] it was like we were envious of those people. Now we look at John Wick LE owners with empathy and sorrow.

[15:06] And I know we're not supposed to feel sorry for them, but they made a stupid move.

[15:10] Okay, so John Wick sales are flatlined. The other thing that I was thinking about was this.

[15:15] Like how do these two things make sense? So you make a game and it's brutally fast and short ball times.

[15:21] But then you want to market it like there's 40 minutes of clips from the movies.

[15:26] Are you going to see them? Is there going to be enough time to enjoy those clips?

[15:30] See, I would just rather most of the pinball magic be under the glass.

[15:35] I don't care about watching 45 minutes or whatever of a movie in pinball format.

[15:41] I look at John Wick, it's fine. It just still feels uninspired.

[15:46] There's no magical mechs. That weapons chest on the right side of the game just really is a head scratcher.

[15:53] It looks terrible and all it does is open up a ball path.

[15:56] And I love watching Stern Apologist and George Gomez go on this like media tour.

[16:02] Now George is like saying, hey, this was Elliot's third whitewood after we made all these changes.

[16:07] Is that supposed to make me feel like this guy's ready for the big leagues? I don't think so.

[16:13] And when George was doing a podcast, someone asked him,

[16:16] does this mean that Elliot is going to be in the roster of lead designers moving forward?

[16:22] And George didn't say yes. And you know what that tells me?

[16:26] That again, this game was quickly designed.

[16:29] This game was a result of a little bit of an issue with their top designers.

[16:33] Mainly John Borg's Indiana Jones was shelved and that is why I think they did it this way.

[16:39] A little bit of Stern news now for you guys out there.

[16:42] Now you know how Stern is not revealing its production schedule.

[16:47] And you know how like John Wick is not going to sell that wealth into fall.

[16:52] And I was saying like, well, what's Stern going to do, right?

[16:56] They're not going to have a ton of John Wick orders.

[16:58] And I know they're going to still make as many jaws premium in pros as they can heading into June, July.

[17:04] And then what, right? Well, here's the answer to that.

[17:08] Stern Pimbal is going to release a vault.

[17:12] Raymond Davidson is working on a vault game that is coming out.

[17:16] I heard that Stern is going to use, I think it might be Spike one game coming out on Spike two.

[17:23] And what they're going to do is they're going to recreate the DMD dots on the LCD screen.

[17:29] That is what I'm hearing.

[17:31] And so that's the rumors.

[17:32] We're going to get this like vault edition of a game sometime in June, July.

[17:38] So Stern is not going to rely solely on John Wick sales.

[17:42] What game could it be?

[17:44] If I were a guessing man, I don't think this is the Tron vault.

[17:48] I think this is most likely going to be kiss, a remake of kiss, or I think it's going to be a remake of Ghostbusters.

[17:55] Those are the two that I would think Stern Pimbal would want to bring out and just cash out on them one more time.

[18:02] All right. So that's happening over there at Stern.

[18:05] Rest in peace, John Wick.

[18:06] You killed yourself without even a gun.

[18:08] Congratulations, Stern.

[18:10] Any other big news in the Pimbal market right now?

[18:13] It's soft gang.

[18:14] The best thing to happen to Haggis Pimbal is John Wick.

[18:17] I feel like nobody's knocking on the door over at Haggis.

[18:20] I just want to say for all of my fans in Australia, why has nobody just gone over to Haggis Pimbal on a random weekday with your cell phone camera and knock on the door and record it?

[18:35] Can someone do that?

[18:36] Just do that for us as a community.

[18:39] Take your cell phone, put it on Facebook Live and say, hey, gang, we're here.

[18:44] I'm going to go knock on the door of Haggis Pimbal and just see if anyone answers the door.

[18:50] If they do, I'm going to politely ask if we can walk in and see if any manufacturing is happening.

[18:56] Why can't somebody do that?

[18:58] Remember all those years where like Iceman was driving around Deep Roots parking lot and nobody has the guts to knock on the door?

[19:06] Believe me, gang.

[19:07] If there was a Pimbal manufacturing company in New York City that had manufacturing going on and people had been waiting for their games for over a year,

[19:16] I guarantee you, Canada would do a Facebook Live in which I would go to the company, knock on the door and see what happens.

[19:25] It is not illegal to do that.

[19:27] Haggis is loving all of this gun gate debate.

[19:30] I think that company is done.

[19:31] I think refunds should go to everybody at this point.

[19:34] I think the statute of limitations on when refunds should go to people is up and it's ridiculous.

[19:41] They said they were going to finish the fathoms by the end of the year.

[19:44] We're heading towards June, people.

[19:46] We all know that Centaur is not getting made and I think Damien needs to pull the plug.

[19:52] I mean, yesterday, Red Lobster declared bankruptcy, yet Haggis Pimbal remains.

[20:00] That's stupid.

[20:01] All right.

[20:02] So we got that over there.

[20:03] We're waiting on Alice in Wonderland.

[20:05] I think that's going to be sometime in July, back to the futures, not until the end of the year.

[20:11] Spooky Pimbal, you know, just a bunch of code updates on these two titles.

[20:15] It sounds like people are having a good time with these games.

[20:18] There's not as many quality issues with these two games as previous Spooky Machines.

[20:23] So that's good.

[20:25] Just not a lot to talk about with Spooky.

[20:27] You know, that's not a bad thing.

[20:28] When you don't get on to Canada's Pimbal podcast on a frequent basis,

[20:33] sometimes that's not a bad thing.

[20:36] Elton John continues.

[20:38] This game continues to have a really positive reception, a slow burn,

[20:44] but it is always being bumped to the top of the pin side threads.

[20:49] And that just goes to show you, you know, people are buying Elton John.

[20:52] They're enjoying it.

[20:54] They're borrowing games from friends.

[20:56] I think a lot of us would be owning this game if it were not so expensive.

[21:01] I would be an owner of Elton John's CE if it were 12-5.

[21:07] I'm not spending 15.

[21:08] Again, I've just got to draw the line because I think they're going to easily be 12-5

[21:14] if they ever make a thousand of them,

[21:16] especially with what's coming next from Jersey Jack theme-wise.

[21:20] All right.

[21:21] So that's that.

[21:22] Like Princess Bride.

[21:24] I don't know.

[21:25] No real news there.

[21:26] I don't know where this game is at.

[21:28] It feels like another bad marketing move.

[21:31] They revealed the game way too early.

[21:33] Now we're just waiting.

[21:34] Speaking of waiting, CGC, Pulp Fiction LEs.

[21:39] Your guess is as good as mine.

[21:41] I feel like there's no longer that excitement.

[21:44] Imagine if they had this game on the line.

[21:47] When that great 20-minute video that got all of us excited about this game,

[21:53] imagine if they actually scratched that itch when we all were so excited for Pulp Fiction.

[22:00] I just talked to someone who just got three years after they ordered it,

[22:05] a Cactus Canyon remake in Europe.

[22:09] Three years later.

[22:11] Stupid.

[22:12] I also want to clarify a silly rumor that's going around that Lior,

[22:17] you know, Lior the art of pinball, that something happened to him.

[22:20] And there's a rumor, someone hit me up.

[22:22] Hey, I heard that Lior passed away.

[22:25] And I just want to confirm for everybody he has not passed away.

[22:29] He is doing fine and he is working on the Fun House topper.

[22:33] And the reason I know that is I just asked Andrea Padretti,

[22:37] hey, I heard this rumor and he's like, yeah, he's alive.

[22:40] He's working on our topper.

[22:41] So just because you're not hearing from somebody doesn't mean they're gone.

[22:45] All right.

[22:46] And if you don't hear from Canada, I might need to take like a week off or two

[22:50] just to get the new baby settled.

[22:53] But I'm going to have free time because Brenda and I are going back and forth.

[22:56] But if you don't hear from me, don't worry.

[22:59] I haven't gone anywhere.

[23:00] You know, somebody has to do a pinball podcast where we just talk about

[23:04] what's relevant in a short period of time without shilling everything.

[23:09] Have you noticed, man, there was so much like bravado with so many content creators.

[23:14] And then the John Wick gun gate came out and everybody got all angry.

[23:18] Then everybody got all apologetic.

[23:20] That's not the right way to do it.

[23:23] And I really wish there were more content creators that didn't just shill everything

[23:29] and look for more ways to support a greedy company like Stern Pinball.

[23:33] They keep hiding behind the fact that because there's demand,

[23:37] they can price things wherever they want.

[23:40] Someone asked them like, hey, why is the Black Knight topper three times as much money

[23:44] because of demand?

[23:46] George, the only reason there's demand is because your company couldn't just make them normally.

[23:52] Like, why don't you just make them?

[23:54] That Ghostbusters topper is easy to make.

[23:57] Why don't you just make it?

[23:58] The reason there's demand, George, is because you treat it your owners like crap

[24:03] by not fulfilling the demand when the game was out.

[24:06] That's the only reason why, George.

[24:08] If you want to manufacture scarcity and then rip us off by charging us three times as much money

[24:14] as the damn thing should be and then take credit for that, you can do that, George.

[24:19] But Canadian Pinball Podcast is here to tell you, F off, Stern.

[24:23] I'm not buying your products ever again until I see you make a move.

[24:28] That shows me you're not greedy.

[24:30] You're not going to manufacture this BS scarcity and you stop treating your dealers and your distros

[24:37] like you're the mafia.

[24:39] They're called dealers for a reason.

[24:42] Allow them to make deals.

[24:44] Allow them to advertise a Venom LE new inbox for 11.5 because even that is $2,000 more than it's worth.

[24:55] So how's that for demand, George, Seth, and Gary, Canada, out?

[25:12] Thank you.
