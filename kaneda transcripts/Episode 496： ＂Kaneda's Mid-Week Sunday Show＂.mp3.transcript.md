[00:00] Isn't Pimball a game of high energy of fast action?

[00:04] So what would you rather have?

[00:05] In terms of the Pimball moment, would you rather have a mode in which you're trying to get through this?

[00:26] Or this?

[00:30] If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it.

[01:00] And the world must be some fine-tune.

[01:03] And we really deserve a hero in the handself and every...

[01:08] Whoa!

[01:10] Oh, we just find...

[01:14] There is no life I know

[01:19] to compare with your imagination.

[01:24] If I were you, I'd like to know more about the invitation of promise love and candy bar

[01:32] with your animation.

[01:34] Just use your head and in the end you'll find your inspiration

[01:39] to choose your strategy or regret this kind of animation.

[01:44] I'm telling you right now, people.

[01:46] Guns in F and Roses is gonna be the game of 2020.

[01:49] Oh no, Kaneda's hyping it again.

[01:50] He's doing what he did with Wonka.

[01:52] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't know.

[01:55] You don't know what these eyes have seen.

[01:57] Are we Pimball men?

[01:59] Or are we Pimball babies?

[02:00] Let's go right now.

[02:07] Oh, Kaneda, you didn't just do that.

[02:09] You didn't just try to amassculate some of the Pimball buying community.

[02:13] You know, I was called a bully this week on the midweek show of the Pimball show by the Pimball

[02:18] network.

[02:19] I'm a bully because I said that people who buy the Jurassic Park toppers are fools and

[02:24] morons and if you support DLC in the form of a topper, you're hurting the Pimball industry.

[02:30] Yeah, that's what I believe.

[02:32] And I'm happy that I gave the midweek show.

[02:35] By the way, someone needs to tell the Pimball network that the middle of the week is Wednesday.

[02:41] If you do a show on Monday, how is your midweek show a Saturday thing?

[02:47] They can't even get the days of the week right.

[02:51] Let alone, you know what they won't do.

[02:52] The Pimball network will not share with you how many people listen to each episode of

[02:58] each show because you know, it's all about the fun.

[03:00] We're just having fun over here, Kaneda.

[03:02] It must be real fun being in second, third, fourth and fifth place, but we're number one

[03:07] here.

[03:08] So here's a deal.

[03:09] Here's a deal.

[03:10] We're going to talk a little bit about why I think Guns and Roses is going to be so

[03:12] much bigger than people think.

[03:14] We're going to talk about the Hot Wheels stream that happened this weekend.

[03:18] Jack Danger played it yesterday for a couple of hours.

[03:21] I'm going to talk about owning Rick and Morty for a week.

[03:24] And what people who get this game can expect when they unbox it.

[03:28] And I'm going to talk about Deeproot.

[03:30] And what I think this company needs to do so they don't get lapped by the competition.

[03:36] How's that sound for an episode 496 on a Sunday morning in New York City from yours

[03:42] truly, Kaneda?

[03:43] Let's hit the ground running.

[03:45] So let's start out with Hot Wheels from American Pimball because it's a brand new game and

[03:49] we got a great two hour stream from Jack Danger yesterday.

[03:52] He was joined by Josh Kugler.

[03:55] I think Joe Balser was also on hand.

[03:57] Michael Grant, the marketing VP over at American Pimball was on hand in the Twitch stream.

[04:02] I was able to watch a little bit of it.

[04:04] Won't lie to you.

[04:06] A beautiful Saturday and the last thing I wanted to do was stay inside.

[04:10] So I did join the stream at the beginning but then I took Bubba for a walk and I watched

[04:14] another hour of the stream this morning.

[04:16] So I want to give you my thoughts on this game and I will say this.

[04:20] I will say this.

[04:21] After watching the stream of Hot Wheels for about an hour, after hearing the rules, after

[04:26] seeing the game in motion, I do think this is a really good effort from American Pimball.

[04:32] And I do think at the price point of this game, which is $6,000, I think you get a lot

[04:39] of Pimball here.

[04:40] I do.

[04:41] Now I don't think it's like the most amazing game ever.

[04:44] I don't think it's a horrible train wreck that's not going to sell any games.

[04:48] I think it looks like a great entry into Pimball for people.

[04:53] And what I mean by entry, it's at the entry level price point.

[04:57] So if you start to look at what can you get for $6,000 new inbox in the Pimball world,

[05:03] I think this game can really hold its own against what's available on the Stern Pro

[05:10] front.

[05:11] I do.

[05:12] I really do.

[05:13] Alright, so the first thing that jumps out when I look at the stream of this game are two

[05:16] things.

[05:17] The artwork is very colorful.

[05:18] They definitely did a good job capturing that colorful world of Hot Wheels with the

[05:23] Orange track with the bright colors and the cars.

[05:26] I mean, it jumps out.

[05:27] This art package definitely jumps out.

[05:30] But I was never a big fan of the art style on Houdini.

[05:34] I thought it was too dark.

[05:35] I get it with steam punky, but it just didn't feel inviting.

[05:38] I've always thought the art for October Fest was one of the worst art packages in the

[05:42] world.

[05:43] This game will pull you in.

[05:45] And there's nothing about the art package that would make you feel hesitant to buy the

[05:50] game.

[05:51] So kudos to American Pimball for finally getting an art package done properly.

[05:55] So I think that that works really well in their favor.

[05:58] The lights on this game.

[05:59] I mean, it's impossible.

[06:01] It's impossible to look at this game and not be really impressed by the light show in

[06:06] this game.

[06:07] And they've done something that I don't think has ever been done before in a Pimball

[06:10] machine.

[06:11] And that's they've added three LED lights to each of the arrows in the game, which can

[06:17] create a really, really cool strobing effect on the arrows that gives it motion of almost

[06:24] like the way the lights light up.

[06:26] You can tell where to shoot what direction, obviously what direction to shoot in.

[06:30] You can only shoot up, but it gives a nice sense of motion on those arrows.

[06:34] And that's something that has never been done before.

[06:37] And I think it's something that will be copied by other Pimball companies moving forward if

[06:42] they decide to actually invest and give you three LEDs in each arrow.

[06:48] But very cool to see them look at the game and say, Hey, what can we put into this?

[06:53] That is unique.

[06:54] And that hasn't been done before.

[06:55] Now the game is very fast.

[06:56] I mean, it's hot wheels, right?

[06:58] So you knew that this game was going to be flowy.

[07:01] You knew it was going to have a lot of speed.

[07:02] And it definitely delivers on that.

[07:05] And when we first saw this game, I think one of the things that jumped out at everybody

[07:09] was the lack of a loop, de loop, the lack of a jump, the lack of anything physical in

[07:14] it from a toy level that is very impressive.

[07:17] And I will say this after watching the stream, I do wish there was one major toy in the

[07:23] game that had some sort of wow hot wheels like thing to it.

[07:28] And you just never, you know me, you just never see the ball do anything in the game that

[07:34] is truly feels like a magical hot wheels moment.

[07:38] Now that being said, I think if you get over that and most people will get over that

[07:43] who because again, like how are you going to miss something that's not there?

[07:46] But I do think they could have had a loop de loop.

[07:48] And we've seen that done in like the Sonic the Hedgehog game that I shared recently.

[07:53] But the game does have a magnet at the top of the orbit.

[07:55] It does have the vertical up kick.

[07:57] It has two ramps.

[07:58] It has two flippers, you know.

[08:00] So look, the game is designed for speed.

[08:03] And I think when you watch this stream, you will see that.

[08:06] And so I think what stood out to me after watching the stream was this game does feel really

[08:12] fun to flip because of the speed.

[08:14] I mean, it is very much a flow game.

[08:16] It reminded me of watching like Black Knight Pro being played, a game in which the shots

[08:21] are open enough to hit them, a game in which you can combo, a game in which the ball is

[08:27] going around and around and around.

[08:28] And I really like the coding in this game.

[08:31] I will say I think the way they coded this game gives players a lot of different ways to

[08:37] tackle the game where you can battle monsters, you can build tracks, you can collect cars.

[08:43] And then I do love the RPM gauge.

[08:46] That is the big center artwork in the middle between the flippers where your goal is to hit

[08:50] the RPM targets to then raise your RPMs to then increase your scoring.

[08:57] So it's really simple to understand.

[08:58] And that's the other thing is like whenever a coder starts explaining a game to me, you

[09:03] really want a game like Hot Wheels to be easy to understand.

[09:07] And this game really is.

[09:08] It did not feel like, oh my god, my head is spinning.

[09:12] Like what are you doing this game?

[09:13] It's a game that you could easily understand.

[09:16] It's a game that you could explain to your kids to easily understand.

[09:19] And again, that's another reason why I think it's kind of like a great beginner game too

[09:23] for people.

[09:24] It's like, yeah, you might have your deep games in your collection.

[09:27] But if you want to introduce a game into your household that your kids can understand,

[09:32] that your casual friends can understand, this is a good place to start.

[09:36] It's a good place to start.

[09:37] And I kept thinking too as I was watching it on location, it's going to be very bright.

[09:43] It's going to be very colorful.

[09:45] It's going to be easy to understand how to play it.

[09:47] So this game will, I think, play well with operators.

[09:50] Now I'll talk in a little bit about how I think this game will do in the marketplace.

[09:55] But, you know, I have to say, I have to say, this game looks like a game you can just

[09:59] jump on and have fun.

[10:01] And I mean that.

[10:02] Like when you watch this game, it feels like a pinball machine you could jump on and

[10:06] have fun immediately.

[10:07] And I can't say that about every pinball machine.

[10:10] I think there are pinball machines out there and you know which ones I'm talking about,

[10:15] where when you jump on them, it's very confusing what to do.

[10:18] It's very confusing.

[10:19] Had to start stuff.

[10:20] It's very confusing.

[10:21] Which of the 22 characters you should pick before you even get going.

[10:25] You know, so Hot Wheels jump in and get going with the game.

[10:28] You know, some of the things that that stood out that I really thought were really cool,

[10:31] I think this game does a good job in creating moments.

[10:35] And I've always been someone who wants to see a game, just create moments.

[10:39] And one of the cool ones I saw was called Red Line Mania.

[10:43] And so if you get the tack all the way to Red Line, you then enter into Red Line Mania

[10:48] mode and it's a multi ball.

[10:50] But what's really cool about it is the flippers die.

[10:53] The game starts pulsing red.

[10:55] And then all of a sudden you've got a 42nd multi ball just to score jackpots.

[11:00] And that's it.

[11:01] And you just keep going trying to hit as many shots as you can.

[11:04] And then after that 40 seconds, the game kind of dies again.

[11:08] All the balls drain and you continue again where you left off.

[11:12] And I love stuff like that where you're in the middle of the game and all of a sudden

[11:16] something else unique happens and you're in it.

[11:19] And for me, it's like simple things like making all the flippers die and everything drains.

[11:25] And you think you think like, oh, you broke the machine or the game's over.

[11:28] But no, it's not.

[11:29] You're actually about to start something new.

[11:31] And here's why I think coding and orchestrating these things into Pim-All Machines is so important

[11:37] because it sets the mood.

[11:39] You get hyped up.

[11:40] You're ready for something to start.

[11:42] And sometimes, and Pim-All does not do enough of this.

[11:46] Sometimes the best way to get a player excited for a game is to actually create moments in

[11:52] which there's pause in the game in which you're not playing, but you're waiting and anticipating

[11:58] for that thing to happen.

[11:59] Kind of like the way multi ball starts in Adam's family.

[12:02] Like there needs to be moments where the machine is going haywire and you're waiting for

[12:07] a little bit to jump back in.

[12:09] And I think more and more Pim-All machines need to understand that.

[12:13] That you need to create those moments.

[12:14] I think it's so important.

[12:16] Another thing I thought was cool was the loop crash multi ball.

[12:19] This is where you got the magnet at the top and the upper orbit, which can accelerate

[12:23] the ball, but it also can grab the ball in this mode.

[12:26] And then you have to hit the ball off of it.

[12:29] And so just, you know, look, I think they're doing some neat things in terms of how they're

[12:33] using what's in the game.

[12:35] I also like the fact that it's a game about racing.

[12:38] So some of the things in it that work to the players advantage is the fact that you're

[12:43] trying to get through the race as quickly as possible.

[12:46] I don't know if I've really seen a game that really rewards players for getting through

[12:51] the mode as quickly as you can.

[12:54] And so I saw Jack went through a race and it took him seven minutes to get through a

[12:58] race.

[12:59] Seven minutes, right?

[13:00] So Jack's a good player.

[13:01] A better player got through it in two minutes.

[13:04] I think his name was Andy.

[13:05] I love that fact because if you, if you code the game like that, then it's really discouraging

[13:11] the player from trapping the ball and taking too much time to find your shot.

[13:16] It's like you once, you know, for those players who can play on the fly, this game is perfect

[13:21] because Hot Wheels encourages you to use speed to get through the mode itself.

[13:26] After seeing the stream and I thought it was great.

[13:28] So I think Kugler and Danger did a great job and Joe Balls or they did a great job answering

[13:33] everyone's questions.

[13:34] If you're seeing the stream, I think anyone who enjoys pinball who watches this game being

[13:40] flipped will walk away saying the game looks fun and I can't wait to flip it.

[13:44] Now here's, here's where it gets challenging.

[13:47] Here's where the real challenge, you know, challenge accepted American pinball Hot Wheels.

[13:52] Here's where the real challenge begins.

[13:54] Did you see enough in that stream to want to buy the game?

[14:00] Did you see enough to want to own it?

[14:02] Do you think there's enough in this where after having it for a month, you're still

[14:06] going to be excited to play it?

[14:08] And this is the new challenge for all pinball manufacturers.

[14:12] If you show your game and people are saying, good job, it looks fun, I can't wait to flip

[14:17] it.

[14:18] That's not enough anymore.

[14:19] That's not enough anymore to be a successful pinball company.

[14:22] It's not enough anymore to have that be the response to your product.

[14:26] Now, what's good for AP is I don't think anyone's going to walk away with any real negative

[14:31] the way they did on Houdini and October fest.

[14:34] And Jack said it out of all their games to date, this game was the most fun game they've

[14:40] made.

[14:41] And that had to be a little bit of a moment of defeat for someone like Joe Balser.

[14:45] It just has to be.

[14:47] It has to be a little bit of a moment of defeat for guys like Dovel over there who invested

[14:51] so much money in game number one and number two.

[14:55] And now you yank stuff out of the game and the game's more fun.

[14:59] And the game is theme so it's more fun.

[15:01] And I think it's a learning lesson for them that you need a theme that excites people

[15:05] and makes it more fun.

[15:07] And you also need to make sure that you're not just putting stuff in it that doesn't connect

[15:12] with the player.

[15:13] But I will say this as a pinball guy that wants to see magic under the glass, I do miss

[15:18] I do miss all the toys and bells and whistles that were in their first two efforts.

[15:24] And if they applied all of that effort and put all those bells and whistles into a hot

[15:29] wheels theme, right?

[15:30] It's like all the money got wasted on October fest and Houdini.

[15:34] I mean think about the shot in Houdini that fires the ball three feet down the playfield.

[15:41] How cool would it have been to load your hot wheel in it and it jumps that far down the

[15:46] playfield, right?

[15:47] It's like they spent all the money on two themes that didn't deliver.

[15:51] And now that you've got this theme that's so perfect for a lot of those toys and loop

[15:55] the loops and fun gadgets, none of it's in it.

[15:59] None of it's in it.

[16:00] So they have to make up for it with code.

[16:03] And that is the new thing in pinball.

[16:04] That is the new approach to most pinball companies.

[16:07] What you don't get anymore in terms of mechs and physical things you're going to get with

[16:13] artwork, LEDs and code.

[16:16] That those are the three main things now that have taken over in terms of the priority.

[16:20] Make the game look good, make it light up really good and make the code really good.

[16:26] And that is easier than engineering mechanisms in a game.

[16:32] It really is.

[16:33] It's more reliable.

[16:34] It's not going to break down.

[16:36] And it's more of like a one time cost.

[16:39] So that's where we're at.

[16:40] I saw someone use the word like this game is fantastic.

[16:44] And I'm like, I don't know if fantastic.

[16:47] It looks really good.

[16:48] It looks really fun.

[16:49] But to me, it's you get what you pay for.

[16:52] You get what you pay for.

[16:53] The other thing that I thought was going to be someone of a deal breaker, which wasn't

[16:56] when this game was the animations and what's on the LCD screen.

[17:01] So I really thought that the YouTube show wouldn't work really well with this and people

[17:06] would find it too childlike and it wouldn't integrate very well.

[17:09] I was wrong.

[17:10] I was absolutely wrong.

[17:11] I think that the show adds a lot of character and personality to this game.

[17:17] And I think it actually helps tell the story.

[17:19] It starts to explain what you're doing in a fun way and the assets and the production

[17:24] quality that Mattel put into that show.

[17:28] Just in terms of like the sound effects and in terms of the music and in terms of the

[17:32] energy and in terms of the voice actors, see all that's already paid for.

[17:36] So what a great benefit to AP to be able to take from that and implement it into the

[17:41] game.

[17:42] And they mix that with their own animations, which by the way are much better than any

[17:46] of the previous AP animations to date.

[17:49] So I think it all kind of came together pretty nicely.

[17:52] So do you want to buy it?

[17:54] That becomes the question.

[17:55] And unfortunately for all of you saying out there, I can't wait to play it.

[17:59] Well when is that going to be?

[18:01] And that's the real dilemma now for American pinball is how do they get this game out there

[18:06] so that people can play it coming out of this pandemic and so people can make up their

[18:11] mind.

[18:12] The other challenging part from a marketing standpoint for this company is there's really

[18:17] no rush to buy it now.

[18:19] So they've offered 500 free shaker motors to the first 500 buyers.

[18:24] Okay.

[18:25] So that's an interesting marketing tactic.

[18:27] But the issue now becomes is how do you put this game in front of enough people to make

[18:32] them want to say, you know what, you get my money.

[18:35] Because the pinball landscape right now is really interesting.

[18:38] It's very competitive.

[18:39] So this game is a little over $6,000.

[18:42] Ninja Turtles Pro is the same price basically.

[18:46] Rick and Morty even it's sold out so you can't get it.

[18:49] It's around $7,500.

[18:51] You've got Jurassic Park Pro.

[18:52] You've got every single stern pro in the world is now, you know, $6,000.

[18:57] So you're competing with all of that.

[18:59] Now if you're buying a game and you want to spend around $6,000, it's not just new

[19:03] in box pros that you can afford.

[19:06] I mean, you can go get a habit for $6,000.

[19:09] You can go get a lot of other machines for $6,000.

[19:13] Almost every stern premium over the last few years is now around that price point.

[19:19] But there is nothing like the new in box experience.

[19:22] There is nothing like having a brand new pinball machine in your home.

[19:26] A game that hasn't been out for a while because it's going to scratch the itch.

[19:30] It's going to be brand new and you're going to have a unique experience that you haven't

[19:33] had before.

[19:34] So there's a lot to be said for that.

[19:36] So do I think this pin is going to sell well?

[19:38] Do I think people are going to follow up on the stream and buy it?

[19:43] Here's where I think there's a little bit of a miss and I give this advice to Michael

[19:46] Grant and I think the pinball companies out there like American pinball need to start thinking

[19:50] about this.

[19:51] They need to think about how to incentivize people to buy the game during the stream like

[19:58] yesterday's stream.

[19:59] They need to figure out like a one day sale.

[20:03] If you buy the game today, you're going to get this.

[20:06] You've got a captive audience.

[20:08] You've got people watching it and people love to spend money on platforms like Twitch.

[20:14] They love to sort of announce to the world like Neil just bought one and Todd just bought

[20:19] one and you want to sort of create that sort of auction like energy where people are promoting

[20:26] the fact that they love what you just did and they can't wait to show support.

[20:30] Well, then it's like prove it.

[20:31] Show you support us by the game right now.

[20:34] I think there needs to be a little bit more thought that goes into that because all this

[20:38] energy and time goes into these streams and setting them up and then there's no mechanism

[20:43] to sell you the game and there's no incentive to buy the game and that's the other big issue

[20:48] and the big hurdle for this game is there's no Ellie.

[20:52] There's no other packages of hot wheels.

[20:54] It's just this game and we know that American pinball is going to make this game for at least

[20:59] a year.

[21:00] So you answer me one question people who are listening to the show.

[21:04] Why should I rush to buy hot wheels?

[21:07] What's the urgency to buy the game?

[21:09] So I saw it.

[21:10] I thought it was fun.

[21:11] Ninja Turtles looks fun.

[21:13] Guns and roses.

[21:14] I don't know what it is yet.

[21:15] It's going to be too expensive probably.

[21:17] Rick and Morty sold out.

[21:19] But what's the incentive to buy it right now?

[21:21] Why wouldn't you just wait and see what else comes out over the next few months?

[21:26] Maybe wait and see what deep root has.

[21:28] Maybe wait and see what Chicago gaming's next offering is.

[21:31] You see what I'm saying?

[21:32] Like is there something about this game that makes you need to have it now?

[21:38] And if there isn't that need to have it now, then you're probably just going to wait.

[21:43] But American pinball can't.

[21:45] They can't win like that.

[21:47] They can't win with games where people will just stay on the sidelines and wait because

[21:52] we know how hype works in this hobby.

[21:55] And if you don't capture the hype window quickly, it could take you a very long time to sell

[22:00] these games.

[22:01] No greater example of that.

[22:03] There's no greater example of that than do you know this is crazy.

[22:06] Do you know how long it took Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle to sell out?

[22:11] I do because it just sold out last week.

[22:13] Last week it sold out.

[22:15] They sold 750 Rick and Morty's in four hours, four hours.

[22:20] And Chuck just finally sold the last Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle last week.

[22:25] Do you want to know when they revealed Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle?

[22:29] It's the IPF 2018.

[22:32] So it took them two years to sell that many Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[22:37] And four hours to sell Rick and Morty.

[22:39] So that's the challenge of the pinball landscape right now.

[22:42] If you don't create any urgency to buy a game at launch, then you're going to be in big

[22:48] trouble.

[22:50] The slow burn to sell these games and look at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[22:54] If Jack had sold all 500 Willy Wonka Collectors edition, when Jack Ass is like me, he would

[23:01] have sold all 500 on the first month that game was made.

[23:05] If he had first made the Collectors editions games, he would have sold everyone.

[23:09] But he made people wait and they waited and they waited and they waited.

[23:13] They saw stream after stream after stream.

[23:16] Then people started to see reasons why they might not like the game.

[23:19] Then the play field issues happened.

[23:21] And all these things, months and months and months go by and by the time it's time for

[23:26] your game to go on the line, you don't really want it anymore.

[23:30] You may have seen it.

[23:31] You may be able to get an Ellie for so much cheaper.

[23:34] You start to second guess it.

[23:35] They will never.

[23:36] They will never sell 500 Collectors editions of Willy Wonka.

[23:40] And so that's the problem.

[23:42] That's the problem.

[23:43] As how does American Pinball win in an environment in which creating hype and creating the fear

[23:48] of missing out on the game?

[23:50] It's almost impossible unless they say we're only going to make a thousand of these and

[23:54] move on to the next game.

[23:56] See the pinball landscape is really challenging.

[23:59] It's really challenging.

[24:00] Stern makes so much money on every Ellie sold.

[24:04] They make money on every premium sold.

[24:06] The pro is probably their worst margin game.

[24:10] But it's also the best value for the customer.

[24:12] So they got it locked down and they just crank those pros out and they just keep making

[24:18] them.

[24:20] So we'll see.

[24:21] The market will tell us how well this game will do.

[24:25] We will find out and we will know whether or not a lot of people are going to and we

[24:29] will know whether or not a lot of people will be unboxing this game or not in the coming

[24:34] months.

[24:35] But I will say this.

[24:36] I will say congratulations to American Pinball for getting this game out.

[24:39] I look forward to playing it.

[24:41] For me, it's not a game I would buy simply because there's just too much on the horizon

[24:45] and it and within what's available for someone like me, it just doesn't make sense.

[24:49] If I was a diehard Hot Wheels fan, that would be a different story.

[24:53] But I'm a diehard Guns and Roses fan as you know if you listen to a me talk over the

[24:58] last like a few years.

[25:00] Okay, so let's change gears to owning Rick and Morty for a week real quickly.

[25:04] So I want to give you guys a quick update.

[25:06] The game is playing well.

[25:07] I haven't had any issues with the gameplay whatsoever.

[25:11] The game will dimple.

[25:12] I've said this before and I keep looking at my game after each day and there's more

[25:16] dimples appearing and a lot of them come from the scoop and I've lowered my scoop.

[25:20] So you're going to get dimples on this game and it's fine.

[25:22] Like when you stand over it in the normal player position, you don't really notice any

[25:27] of them.

[25:28] So I'm learning to live with this fact and I know I've been OCD in the past.

[25:32] I know I've been someone who's advocated for a play field protector and that's the thing.

[25:36] If you really want to keep your game perfect, perfect, then just throw a play field protector

[25:40] in it.

[25:41] So I don't know how this game is going to play with a play field protector, but give it

[25:45] a whirl.

[25:46] Maybe it's actually going to make the scoop better because that'll raise up the play field

[25:50] height a little bit which might make making the scoop lower unnecessary.

[25:54] So that might have an advantage.

[25:56] But you know, like I'm just going to play this game.

[25:58] I'm going to enjoy it.

[26:00] Brenda blew up the machining and got almost 10 million points.

[26:03] But here are a few other things that you should keep in mind as you're waiting for your

[26:06] Rick and Morty.

[26:07] Number one is you should definitely get the purple coin door.

[26:10] If you are on the fence about what color coin door to get, the purple is the way to go.

[26:15] You will kick yourself if you don't get purple.

[26:17] Trust me.

[26:18] And if you didn't get purple and you ordered black, don't worry about it.

[26:21] You could always call spooky and get a purple one sent to you.

[26:24] The monitor on this game is a little weird.

[26:26] The LCD.

[26:27] For some reason when you look at it, it's all washed out.

[26:31] The areas that should be black turn almost to like a light gray.

[26:34] And then if you bend down and put your chin on the lockdown bar, the colors become black.

[26:39] And so the viewing angle on it is pretty poor.

[26:42] So I heard this was the same thing with TNA.

[26:45] And so what I've done is I ordered a new LCD screen to replace this one that has a better

[26:50] feel to view.

[26:52] And I heard TNA people did the same thing.

[26:54] And people gave me the link to what the LCD is.

[26:58] You need to get.

[26:59] There's an LCD.

[27:00] And then I think there's another board you need to drive it.

[27:03] So I'm doing that because I definitely want the colors to pop more on the LCD.

[27:09] It's not expensive.

[27:10] It's like 66 bucks for this different monitor.

[27:13] And then another 25 bucks for the control board.

[27:16] Look I wish I didn't have to do this.

[27:19] I shouldn't have to replace the LCD.

[27:21] I wish spooky would put the best version in there.

[27:25] And it is what it is.

[27:26] I mean what am I going to do?

[27:28] It's their company.

[27:29] They're putting this stuff in.

[27:30] I'm happy with almost everything else in the game.

[27:32] So I can't really complain that much.

[27:34] And look it's a cheap little fix, but it's not necessary.

[27:36] It's not going to take away from your fun of the game.

[27:39] But I would just like it to look a little bit better.

[27:41] Something I noticed really cool in this game that's super fun.

[27:43] In the attract mode, you can turn on the interdimensional cable.

[27:46] If you've ever watched the show, there's the cable they watch with all the weird TV

[27:50] shows from around the galaxies and universes.

[27:53] And so you can put that on and you can control how many times the attract screen loops before

[27:58] it plays a TV commercial.

[28:00] Super funny.

[28:01] I highly recommend you turn that on with your game if you haven't.

[28:04] I added one washer to the scoop and it's been working very well since.

[28:09] And I just recommend you guys play your game and you determine whether or not your scoop

[28:13] is rejecting.

[28:14] If it is, those are the two solutions I would recommend.

[28:17] One is adding a washer to each screw that's underneath the scoop mechanism or take your

[28:22] thumb and bend down the hood and see if that works for you.

[28:26] But you can get it to a place where it's not rejecting that much.

[28:29] The posts on the game are getting torn apart.

[28:32] And so I ordered more posts from Pimball Life.

[28:36] I'll say this.

[28:37] I ordered purple posts from Pimball Life.

[28:39] They came in and the purple doesn't match the side armor or the leg purple, which is

[28:45] a little weird.

[28:46] I also ordered the purple rubber that you put underneath the playfield legs on the floor

[28:51] that touched the floor.

[28:52] Those also don't match.

[28:54] It's more of a dark purple on the powder coat and the purple that they have is a lighter

[28:59] purple.

[29:00] This is where I stopped at OCD, but it just looks a little weird.

[29:04] So I'm going to order more translucent and black posts to go there.

[29:08] But here's another thing that's crazy to me is spooky puts these posts in the game.

[29:13] And literally after 100 plays, they're already chewed a bit.

[29:17] I do wish they would have put something in there that was higher quality because it's

[29:23] not too hard to change a post in a game, but I haven't seen how much of the, if I have

[29:28] to take any of the plastic off on some of the areas, but you shouldn't have to.

[29:32] You shouldn't have to change the post in your Pimball machine after just like a couple

[29:36] hundred plays.

[29:37] So I have to ding them on that.

[29:40] For a game that costs me $9,500, there should be posts in the game that are stronger.

[29:47] And these are cheap items, people.

[29:48] They're like 60 cents of post.

[29:50] And I'm sure if Chuck is ordering these in bulk, they're even less money.

[29:55] So next time spooky and company put posts in the game that can hold up to a Pimball.

[30:01] So the last thing I'm going to tell you to do with your Rick and Morty order, if you're

[30:05] thinking about ordering it a couple things.

[30:07] One is I would not order the target decals.

[30:11] And I'm going to explain why these things are a joke.

[30:15] And out of all the things in this game, I can't believe that spooky Pimball put stickers

[30:20] on the targets that have absolutely no covering.

[30:23] When you look at a stern target, it's made up like that thick, durable sort of mylarish

[30:28] material.

[30:29] It doesn't wear.

[30:30] It doesn't wear out.

[30:31] It can take the abuse of a Pimball hitting it over and over again.

[30:35] There's a coating to it, like a plastic coating over the decal.

[30:39] Spooky Pimball just puts stickers.

[30:42] Tiny, tiny thin stickers with no coating, nothing in front of it.

[30:46] And literally after 50 plays, they're already starting to break and show cracks and to

[30:53] wear out.

[30:54] 50 plays people.

[30:55] So you're $10 for these target decals.

[30:58] And I know people are like, oh, it's just 10 bucks.

[31:00] But here's the thing.

[31:01] 10 bucks over 750 machines.

[31:05] That's $7,500 that spooky Pimball might get for garbage stickers that are pointless because

[31:12] you're going to have to change them.

[31:14] And they're not going to work.

[31:15] And I'm sorry, but like there is, again, there's no reason why I should have spent $7,500

[31:20] to $9,500 on a Pimball machine.

[31:24] And a simple item like a target decal wasn't designed better.

[31:28] Charlie, you guys really should be embarrassed.

[31:31] And Scott and E Cine Company, you guys, you guys know I love this machine.

[31:34] You have to really hang your heads and shame that you thought you could get by with that.

[31:39] Like did you just learn about a Pimball decal?

[31:42] Unbelievable.

[31:44] So save your 10 bucks.

[31:45] Do not order it because they suck.

[31:48] I don't mean they suck by what they look like.

[31:50] They suck because they're going to wear out so quickly.

[31:53] Now someone suggested just put mylar over them.

[31:56] No, it doesn't really work.

[31:57] I tried to mylar the decals, but it doesn't work because it's not flat.

[32:02] You're going to see there's like a screw protruding up and you see how stern designs

[32:06] it's decals to take that into account.

[32:08] If you try to stick the mylar over these decals, it's going to pop up.

[32:13] It's going to fall off.

[32:14] It is.

[32:15] Trust me.

[32:16] Mylar does not work.

[32:17] It only work on the spinner because the spinner is flat.

[32:22] But everything else is not flat and it's not going to work and it's just going to, I

[32:26] don't know.

[32:27] It's just somebody out there needs to make new target decals for this game that work properly.

[32:35] I would love for that person to be spooky Pimball and to stop putting these garbage $10

[32:41] decals in the game.

[32:42] You hear me chuck, you need to stop putting these in the future games.

[32:45] And because you guys have the licensing property to put these license characters onto the target

[32:51] decals, you need to do it.

[32:52] Like they need to do the fix because it's not legal for anyone else to do this, to make

[32:57] images with the meeseeks and Beth and Jerry and Summer.

[33:01] You can't legally do that and sell it without adult swims permission, but Chuck has that

[33:06] permission.

[33:07] So I think they need to rethink this.

[33:09] I think they also, I'm going to call for it because Canadian's keeping it fair.

[33:13] The same way I called for Jersey Jack to send everyone with messed up play fields, new

[33:19] play fields, wait for it, Charlie Emory and spooky Pimball, they need to redesign better

[33:27] target decals and they need to send those for free to anyone who paid for these target

[33:33] decals.

[33:34] And it's a $10 option, Chuck.

[33:36] It's not a new play field.

[33:38] It's not a new this.

[33:39] You need to make the target decals work.

[33:43] And you need to send them to everyone who ordered them and you need to stop putting the

[33:47] garbage target decals into the games.

[33:49] Why could you do this though?

[33:51] Like surely they know they suck and now you're going to get 750 buyers.

[33:55] Here's why you don't do it.

[33:57] The details matter.

[33:58] You're going to get 750 buyers who are going to be upset that their decals look like shit

[34:04] and I'm sorry to curse.

[34:05] But you're going to, why would you do that?

[34:07] Why would you make the cheapest part of the game, something that's going to cause such

[34:11] a big headache for your customers who you know want to keep their games looking good.

[34:16] And one of the things that nobody enjoys looking at is a warrant target decal.

[34:20] It's just something you don't want in a game.

[34:22] So Chuck, you need to make the fix.

[34:24] It's going to cost you maybe more in the long run and this is the problem when you go

[34:27] cheap like this and you make people suffer through a bad quality item.

[34:31] It's defective.

[34:32] I mean, there's no way else to talk about it.

[34:35] That is a defective sticker.

[34:36] That doesn't work.

[34:37] It doesn't do the job.

[34:38] So it's defective and you need to replace it.

[34:40] And I expect it within a week.

[34:42] Now, I take your time with it, but Chuck needs to fix that.

[34:45] Other than that, I love the game.

[34:46] The other thing that I would say the final thing is they need more adventures in the game.

[34:51] And I know they're coming.

[34:52] You will reach a point where after playing the game over and over and over again, you're

[34:56] just like, all right, I've played the same like four or five adventures over and over

[35:01] again, the same like X amount of dimensions.

[35:04] And you want more.

[35:06] It's a kind of game that just makes you crave so many modes.

[35:10] So many adventures and I know more is coming.

[35:13] But it's, you know, when you look at the show and the way the game is, ostensibly they

[35:18] could give you.

[35:19] I know this takes work, but they could give you pretty much like an adventure per show.

[35:23] Every show has an adventure they go on.

[35:25] Now, they're not all good, but they could easily cherry pick like five great adventures

[35:31] from each season and go from there.

[35:34] And I really do think if you're trying to get through 10 adventures, I would love this

[35:38] game to end up with somewhere around 15 total adventures in it.

[35:42] I really would.

[35:43] It has, I hope it's more than 10 because it's not that it's a deal breaker.

[35:46] It's just that they're so awesome.

[35:48] And you just want as many of them as possible.

[35:50] And I think it's another reason why this game's going to have long term appeal is that

[35:54] more and more can keep being at it.

[35:55] And the way they did it was kind of genius because as Rick and Morty continues to be a

[36:00] show, they could easily pull new adventures and just throw it in.

[36:04] There's nothing about what's on the game that would make that seem silly.

[36:09] It's like they didn't miss out the ability to keep incorporating the fun into the game.

[36:13] And I think that's why Rick and Morty could be a long term keeper for a lot of people.

[36:18] All right.

[36:19] I know I started this show with guns and roses and showing you the difference between

[36:22] Willy Wonka music and G&R.

[36:24] And I'm just going to say this.

[36:25] I'm just going to say this.

[36:26] I think guns and roses is going to be a huge hit for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[36:32] I think it's finally is going to give people who have wanted a Jersey Jack game, but haven't

[36:36] wanted a sort of more childish theme and a juvenile theme.

[36:40] I think it's going to give them something to be excited about looking at the game, looking

[36:44] at the artwork right now.

[36:46] I think it's going to be that cool game that you're going to want to put in your game

[36:49] room.

[36:50] And I think there's a lot more fans of rock and roll and Pimball.

[36:54] I think rock and roll and Pimball goes so well together.

[36:57] And for those of you out there who are like, I don't want a music pin.

[36:59] I think you're wrong.

[37:01] And look at how well people who say that are such BS.

[37:04] Look how well ACDC and Metallica have sold.

[37:07] Look how well they've sold.

[37:09] And I'm just saying looking at guns and roses, Pimball machine, this thing embarrasses Metallica

[37:14] and ACDC.

[37:15] Embarrasses it and Keith is on the code.

[37:17] So you know you're going to get code that's like Lyman Sheets deep, but it's also not

[37:21] going to be a game that's impossible to figure out and overly complex.

[37:25] And so you've got the high energy music of guns and roses.

[37:28] You've got the design genius of Eric.

[37:31] You've got this simplicity of a rock and roll band theme where you're not going to have

[37:36] to like go through 22 characters and you're not going to butcher the assets like Wonka.

[37:40] No, it's all going to be there.

[37:42] You don't need an incredible sound engineer because the sound engineer in this game is

[37:45] slash, axle and duff.

[37:47] You're going to have probably the best sound system in any Pimball machine ever.

[37:51] You're probably going to have one of the coolest lighting integrations in any Pimball machine

[37:54] ever.

[37:55] And so when you see the hand drawn artwork on top of all this, like there's just not

[37:59] a weak link in this game right now.

[38:01] The only thing that has me nervous is Pat Lawler yanking stuff out of it because he's

[38:05] the weak link in the game.

[38:06] He doesn't want Eric to show him up.

[38:08] I know that for a fact.

[38:10] He's jealous.

[38:11] Eric's got the goods.

[38:12] This man's got the goods.

[38:14] You know it probably makes them nervous having me say that, but it's true.

[38:17] It's true.

[38:18] They've got two main designers and one has historically made some of the most iconic Pimball

[38:25] machines ever.

[38:27] One historically made the best selling Pimball machine of all time.

[38:30] And one guy's made one machine, one machine.

[38:33] So people think it's crazy.

[38:35] Canada is saying that he, you know, he's the best designer right now, but I'm telling you

[38:39] right now, I didn't say of all time right now.

[38:43] Eric is a better designer than Pat Lawler.

[38:45] Okay.

[38:46] He knows that a design a game that's more fun.

[38:48] I think Scott Denise he designed a game that's more fun than Pat Lawler with Rick and

[38:52] Morty.

[38:53] I think Keith Owen designs a game that's more fun.

[38:55] So the new guard people, it's all about the new guard.

[38:59] It's hard for these old guys to retire, but they're done.

[39:03] Bring on the new guard.

[39:04] So speaking of new guard, deep root Pimball, let's end with deep root.

[39:08] Where is deep root?

[39:10] Where are they?

[39:11] They are in jeopardy right now of being left behind this momentum that is building as we

[39:18] get back to normal.

[39:20] And if they were ready in the middle of March to show everybody what they've been working

[39:26] on for all this time March, April, May, June.

[39:31] Okay.

[39:32] So three months after the fact they were supposedly ready.

[39:36] Still nothing.

[39:37] And I don't mean like I expect to see everything, but they can't win like this.

[39:42] They can't win with radio silence.

[39:44] They can't win with absolutely no conversation.

[39:47] They can't win with nothing teased.

[39:50] They need to start the conversation.

[39:53] See here's where I'm concerned.

[39:55] Here's where I get a little bit worried because there is nothing seemingly going on.

[40:00] It leads me to believe that they're not ready for manufacturing because if they were ready

[40:05] for manufacturing and they were ramping up and all things were starting to like move

[40:09] and they were getting ready to pull back the curtain and like wow us, we'd start to

[40:14] see something by now.

[40:15] No?

[40:16] I'm not getting anything.

[40:17] I was invited down in July to maybe come down there.

[40:21] I haven't heard a follow up.

[40:23] So is Deeproot getting lapped by the competition?

[40:27] Someone said that they're getting lapped by the competition.

[40:30] Yes and no to that.

[40:31] Yes and no to that.

[40:33] And you could just you could argue that Deeproot has been lapped by the competition for the

[40:37] last five years.

[40:38] Like ever since this company began, they still have not shipped one pinball machine.

[40:43] And if history has shown us anything.

[40:46] The longer you take to get your game out, the harder it is for your company to stay viable.

[40:51] Right?

[40:52] I'm not even talking about whether the game is good or not.

[40:54] The longer it takes your game to come out, the harder it is to keep your company afloat.

[41:01] The delay on getting Wizard of Oz out the door is the reason why Jersey Jack went bankrupt.

[41:06] It's the reason why he lost control of his company.

[41:09] It's the reason why young Brett Abbas is now the owner of Jack's company.

[41:14] You think that makes Jack feel well?

[41:16] You think that sits well with Jersey Jack?

[41:18] His dream has now been handed to the son of a billionaire who had a bail jack out because

[41:24] of all the delays and the mismanagement.

[41:27] But that's on Jack and his team that created that scenario.

[41:31] So this is what happens when you need help.

[41:34] Now how can Robert and Deeproot, how long can they go with no money coming in?

[41:39] It's not like there's a little bit of money coming in.

[41:41] It's not like Jerry who's got P-Rock money coming in.

[41:45] There's no money coming in.

[41:47] There's no other source of revenue.

[41:50] You know when Microsoft made the Xbox, they still had billions of dollars coming in on

[41:54] all their other stuff so they could take that loss to develop the Xbox.

[41:59] But how is Deeproot staying financially?

[42:02] Financially viable without any money coming in.

[42:05] Now you've heard me on this show.

[42:07] I've always wanted more than anything to just see the games.

[42:11] To just play the games.

[42:13] To just have, here's the thing.

[42:15] To just have the opportunity to send Robert and company my money.

[42:20] If you reveal a package that is awesome.

[42:23] If you give us a game that's really neat.

[42:25] If it's stunning, if it's doing new stuff in Pimbal, if it answers a lot of the headaches

[42:30] that we have with current ownership.

[42:32] Yes, people will, people will consider you an option.

[42:37] But how can we be an option when you don't show us anything?

[42:40] When you don't talk about anything, when you don't reveal anything, when you don't even

[42:45] tease anything.

[42:46] This game came out at Houston how many months ago?

[42:50] You know like eight, nine months ago?

[42:52] We're still waiting on a game we've already seen the majority of the gameplay.

[42:57] So something's wrong.

[42:59] It definitely can't be the plan.

[43:01] And if you are ready to go by TPS, how are you not ready to go by 4th of July?

[43:06] How are you not ready to go?

[43:07] What makes you ready to go?

[43:08] I don't get it.

[43:09] At some point, it really boils down to this.

[43:12] All of Pimbal boils down to this.

[43:14] Not just deep root, not just American Pimbal or Stern.

[43:17] All of Pimbal boils down to this.

[43:20] You make a game.

[43:21] You see if people want it.

[43:23] If people want it and they buy it, you will be a successful Pimbal company.

[43:28] If you make a game, people don't want.

[43:30] You will be out of business very quickly in this industry.

[43:33] Chicago Gaming Company makes games they know people want.

[43:36] And so it's easy to sell the classics back to people.

[43:39] Stern Pimbal, it's a numbers game with them.

[43:43] They might not always make the game you want, but chances are they will have a game you

[43:47] want over a fiscal year and they'll get you something.

[43:52] They win by numbers.

[43:54] They win by numbers.

[43:55] It's like if every girl in the high school wants to sleep with you, eventually you're

[43:58] going to find a few every month that you're willing to take the plunge with.

[44:02] That's Stern Pimbal.

[44:03] They might not always be the most attractive.

[44:05] They might not all have personality.

[44:07] You might not even be attracted to all them.

[44:09] But over time enough people offering you something, you're going to buy it.

[44:13] You're going to go into it.

[44:15] And that's Stern for me.

[44:16] They don't make the best possible Pimbal machines.

[44:19] Some of them are really good.

[44:20] But they're cheaper than you know you're paying for it.

[44:23] They are.

[44:24] You know this people.

[44:25] But it's okay because you know what?

[44:26] They make a game.

[44:27] It's based on a theme you love.

[44:29] They put it in a box and they get it to you.

[44:32] When you get your Stern machine, yes it's going to have some cheap things here and there.

[44:36] But chances are it's not going to break down.

[44:38] If it does break down, they've got the best customer service in the business.

[44:42] They do.

[44:43] They will help you out.

[44:44] I know some of you have been through headache moments.

[44:47] But you got to remember Stern sells thousands of machines.

[44:51] It's easy for Spooky Pimbal to pick up the phone and treat you like a human and be amazing

[44:56] to you when you're only selling 750 games over two years.

[45:01] Right?

[45:02] And then Stern selling 750 games in a few weeks all over the world.

[45:06] So it's a little bit different and it's okay.

[45:09] I think they both have great customer service.

[45:11] Okay?

[45:12] See I really just want the J-pop story to come to a conclusion.

[45:16] I want to know if it was worth it.

[45:18] That's it.

[45:19] I just want to know if everything John said he could bring to the table.

[45:23] If all of his ideas and all of his patents and all of his you know new ways to think

[45:28] about Pimbal.

[45:29] I just want to know if J-pop has one more in him.

[45:33] I would happily take more than one.

[45:35] But I just want to know that J-pop has the ability to make Pimbal magic again.

[45:40] He's had...

[45:41] This is the part that just kills me.

[45:43] John's had millions of dollars, millions of dollars of other people's money thrown at

[45:50] him to create Pimbal magic.

[45:53] Throne at him.

[45:55] Seven eight years have gone by.

[45:57] Seven eight years.

[45:58] I hesitate to say the amount of money that he's probably gone through just to make one

[46:05] magical game.

[46:06] I'm going to guess and say John Papaduke through his fingers, through his time and through

[46:12] his promises has probably burned a few million dollars.

[46:17] Like three to five million dollars have pumped into John Papaduke's promises of a magical

[46:25] Pimbal machine.

[46:26] And then the sad part is, well then how many games do you have to sell to recoup that

[46:32] investment on J-pop?

[46:34] And where is this game that is going to come out and make all of us want to give over

[46:40] our money and justify the amount of millions of dollars that he's burned up to get Pimbal

[46:47] magic back in the world?

[46:48] And meanwhile, a young kid with nothing more than off the shelf parts builds total

[46:56] nuclear annihilation in his basement with no help.

[47:01] And it goes on to be a sale success.

[47:04] He then goes on to make Rick and Morty Pimbal.

[47:07] One of the funnest games of 2020 sells out in four hours, makes spooky and company a

[47:15] few million dollars.

[47:16] And now he's on to game number three with nothing but momentum.

[47:21] He's done all of that.

[47:22] Remember this.

[47:23] Anthony has done all of that by his bootstraps in his basement with no millions of dollars

[47:31] with no outside help.

[47:33] He just made a Pimbal machine that he was passionate about and it's a home run and it's

[47:38] another home run.

[47:40] And John Papaduke, where are we?

[47:43] Where is it all?

[47:44] Where's his end?

[47:45] You see what I'm saying?

[47:47] Give me Eric.

[47:48] Give me Scott.

[47:49] Give me Keith.

[47:50] Give me people that want to make a name for themselves and a legacy that they build

[47:56] because they made magic.

[47:58] These guys that are Pat Lawler, John Papaduke, Brian Eddie, I just think it's over.

[48:04] I just think they're they had their time.

[48:07] They had their time.

[48:08] But now it's time for the new guys.

[48:11] And this is why we still just want to see it from deep root.

[48:15] We just want to see it.

[48:17] And we all know one simple fact.

[48:19] Robert knows this.

[48:20] We know it.

[48:21] If what they show us blows us away, I think people will buy it.

[48:26] But it has to do that.

[48:28] And the expectations that it needs to do that keep getting higher and higher and higher

[48:33] as more and more companies show their products.

[48:36] And I'm just going to close this show and say this.

[48:39] Deep root Pimbal, they need to show, sell and ship.

[48:43] Let your atomic zombie adventure land before you see guns and roses.

[48:48] They need to do that.

[48:49] They need to get this game in boxes before people get guns and roses.

[48:53] My guesstimate on when you'll see guns and roses is sometime in August with a fall

[48:59] ship date.

[49:00] I don't think you're going to see it in July.

[49:02] I just don't.

[49:03] And I'll close this show by saying my rumor about jaws really, you know, people really don't

[49:08] care that much.

[49:09] I really wasn't that much excitement about I'm hearing that jaws is going to be a title

[49:13] by Stern in 2021.

[49:15] I thought you guys have been clamoring for jaws all this time.

[49:19] Now, it is 100% speculation that Keith L. Win is making jaws.

[49:23] I mean, I completely made that up.

[49:25] He could be just making Godzilla, which is what I've heard it is.

[49:29] And that is probably what's going to happen.

[49:31] But I just thought it would be more interesting if Keith L. Win actually made jaws because it

[49:38] just makes more sense to me that they would hand him another license without movie clips.

[49:43] That's iconic and had him do the L. Win effort on jaws.

[49:48] Now I see some people on Pinside and the pin monk guy man, Viral, Viralind.

[49:53] I bought this guy's fan for my Rick and Morty.

[49:55] I've been gushing about it and this guy like talks so much smack about me on Pinside.

[50:00] It's funny.

[50:01] He's like, he's never that accurate.

[50:03] I am actually a lot more accurate than I am wrong when it comes to my rumors and speculation.

[50:08] But on this one, I tell you, it's a rumor.

[50:10] I heard from a very good source that it's happening.

[50:13] If it doesn't happen, so what?

[50:15] Right?

[50:16] So what?

[50:17] If it doesn't happen, so what?

[50:18] But I am shocked.

[50:19] I don't really think jaws is as popular as some of the jaws fanatics think.

[50:22] So we'll see.

[50:23] We'll see.

[50:24] Good time to be in pinball people.

[50:25] We got hot wheels.

[50:26] We got Rick and Morty's shipping.

[50:28] They need new target decals.

[50:30] We've got deep rude who's still waiting.

[50:32] We've got to show something soon.

[50:34] We've got the pinball show that thinks Saturday is the middle of the week.

[50:38] That's really exciting.

[50:39] We've got DLC toppers.

[50:41] We've got a lot of good stuff coming out in pinball.

[50:44] If I were you as a pinball listener of this show, I would be excited.

[50:48] You've got a lot to choose from coming out in 2020, 2021.

[50:52] It's an exciting time.

[50:54] I will end this show by saying we want to say, rest in peace to Steve Epstein who passed

[51:01] away.

[51:02] I believe yesterday he was battling a late stage cancer.

[51:06] I believe.

[51:07] And you know, Steve, if you don't know who he is, he's an iconic pinball figure.

[51:11] And Steve, rest in peace, my friend.

[51:13] I've always had great encounters with you at modern pinball.

[51:17] One of the nicest guys in the industry.

[51:20] Everybody, you know what?

[51:21] Play your games.

[51:22] Life is short.

[51:23] We don't have much time.

[51:25] Don't OCD over every dimple anymore.

[51:27] I know.

[51:28] I'm changing too.

[51:29] It's not worth it.

[51:30] Play these games.

[51:31] When you get bored of them, sell them to someone else and they will enjoy it and get

[51:36] something new and enjoy that.

[51:37] But don't for a minute think I'm going to go soft and say everything is awesome.

[51:41] I'm not.

[51:42] I'm not going to say every game is fantastic.

[51:44] I'm not going to say every game is worth 6, 7, 8, 13, 15,000 dollars.

[51:48] No.

[51:49] And my mystery game.

[51:50] Oh.

[51:51] If you could see it.

[51:52] If you could, all I want is that mystery game.

[51:54] I told my friend making it.

[51:55] The only reason I came back last year to the podcast scene is that's the game I want.

[52:00] He's not making many of them.

[52:01] He's going to make them.

[52:03] Who knows when.

[52:04] It's going to be for sale.

[52:05] Not many of you are going to be able to get a chance to buy it.

[52:08] And the people who listen to this show, the order banks are going to go open live on

[52:14] Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[52:15] And I told them, I'm like, dude, I can't wait when we're ready to sell this game because

[52:21] the people who listen to this show, it's like, I bet you're going to sell everyone in Australia

[52:25] first because those people are up earliest.

[52:28] But in one episode, this guy is going to sell out of this game.

[52:32] And it's going to be so funny for those of you who are like, I don't listen to Canada.

[52:35] He's not bad at accurate.

[52:36] Like, he's entertaining.

[52:37] But, you know, I never listened to a single show.

[52:40] And then I love when those guys go on and mention everything I've said wrong about every

[52:43] recent release.

[52:44] And yet, they don't listen.

[52:45] You know you'll listen.

[52:47] You can't make this up.

[52:48] Like, without this show, what are the other shows going to talk about?

[52:51] And I don't mean all of them.

[52:52] You know what I'm talking about?

[52:53] You know, my main competition over there at the net where did it'll competition?

[52:57] In the middle of the week, a Saturday boys get with it.

[53:00] Get with it.

[53:01] Everyone, this is episode 496.

[53:03] Get ready for some guns and effing roses.

[53:05] Don't ever leave there.

[53:21] See, I will be there.

[53:28] I will never want it once for you to know that I can.

[53:38] I will never want it once for you to know that I can.

[53:48] I will never want it once for you to know that I can.

[53:56] I will never want it once for you to know that I can.
