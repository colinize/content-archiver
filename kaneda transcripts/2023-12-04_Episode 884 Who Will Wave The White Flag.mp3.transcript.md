[00:30] a Candidate Review to the world for free!

[00:32] And now we're back in the driver's seat, keeping it positive, just talking about what you want

[00:37] to hear about, and that's pinball everybody.

[00:40] So let's talk about something I saw over the weekend.

[00:43] You know, look, Elton John is a beautiful machine, and as I said on my last show, my

[00:48] fear is this game won't make it into people's homes, it won't make it onto location, not

[00:54] because the game is not beautiful, not because the game is not fun, it's just a lot of money.

[01:02] And when I talk to people, they enjoy the machine, and then you're like, are you gonna

[01:05] buy one?

[01:06] And they're like, no, I'm gonna wait.

[01:08] And you know what's gonna make people wait even more?

[01:11] More than Jaws Pinball, more than Pulp Fiction, more than maybe The Matrix, more than Back

[01:16] to the Future coming out at the end of next year.

[01:19] What's gonna make everybody wait?

[01:22] Because there is a Guns N' Roses LE that is now $7,000.

[01:27] There's a Jurassic Park 30th anniversary that just was like $13,000 two weeks ago, and now

[01:34] they're all selling for $11,000.

[01:38] And when are these companies going to wake up?

[01:42] And that's the point of this show is I think one of these pinball manufacturers, somebody

[01:47] has to wave the white flag and take prices back to 2019.

[01:54] I'm not asking them to roll it back to like 2014.

[01:59] They just need to go back and find the sweet spot.

[02:03] And it's not where it's currently at.

[02:07] Stern and Jersey Jack are fighting a war in which they're both going to lose this battle.

[02:13] And Stern's got the volume.

[02:15] They've got the manufacturing capabilities.

[02:18] Jersey Jack's got the billionaire.

[02:20] And you know who's gonna lose in all of this?

[02:22] We are.

[02:24] Because we're not the billionaires and we're not Stern Pinball making so much money because

[02:29] we all know they did not increase the bomb of these machines.

[02:34] And now they want us to spend $13,000 on an LE with no topper, no real accessories, right?

[02:41] Just like these games used to be $7,500 and all we're saying to you Stern is this, we

[02:47] will happily spend $10,500 on an LE.

[02:53] But if you're gonna make a thousand of them, fine, but you can't charge much more than

[02:57] $10,000.

[02:59] And now that all these games are $13,000, look what's happening to them all.

[03:03] Look what's happening to all these Jersey Jack games once they raised prices.

[03:08] So who's gonna be the first company to actually admit that they may be overpriced their own

[03:16] market?

[03:17] We've seen it happen in the auto industry.

[03:19] We're seeing it happen in the watch collecting industry.

[03:22] A lot of price correction is occurring right now in these kinds of like luxury good categories.

[03:29] And yet the pinball space seems to be unable to read the room.

[03:35] I want people to buy an Elton John and not unbox it and lose $3,000 when they cut the

[03:44] box open.

[03:45] I don't want to see my friends who love Jurassic Park, who now can get one and not spend $18,000.

[03:53] That's what the LEs were going for at the height of COVID.

[03:56] And now you were all excited, right?

[03:58] You bought one for $13,000 and you forgot one simple thing.

[04:03] The original Jurassic Park LE was like $8,500.

[04:09] And so Sternholm was charged $5,000 more for the same exact game.

[04:15] And all they did was change the armor, change the stickers.

[04:20] And I'm seeing everybody say, nope, no more.

[04:24] The market is pushing back.

[04:26] And Elton John is gonna get slaughtered by these market realities.

[04:31] And Jersey Jack has to know this wasn't back to the future.

[04:35] This wasn't Harry Potter.

[04:36] The last three titles they've made are not Take My Money Now kinds of themes.

[04:43] And so they bring out three like B theme games and then they charge more than ever before

[04:48] in the history of pinball.

[04:50] And then everyone who unboxed one is losing money.

[04:54] Jersey Jack, listen to me.

[04:55] I love your products.

[04:57] I think you do put more and your games make Stern pinball machines look outdated.

[05:03] Now that the flippers are great, good.

[05:05] We finally realized how to make good gameplay after 10 years.

[05:09] But here's my advice to Jersey Jack.

[05:11] It's like, Jack, you're not gonna sell a $12,000 Elton John.

[05:16] If guns and roses, LEs are selling for $7,000.

[05:22] It's not gonna work.

[05:24] We don't live in a vacuum and nor can the marketing departments at these pinball companies.

[05:30] And as these pinball companies have scaled up and want to sell more games, how are they

[05:35] gonna sell more games if the prices new in box are this high?

[05:40] How are they gonna sell more games if everyone's witnessing such a plummet in value of second

[05:47] hand machines?

[05:49] And so who's gonna wave the white flag?

[05:51] But the pinball brothers waved it like Alien Ripley Edition is not that expensive.

[05:57] That's a bargain in today's marketplace.

[05:59] Pulp Fiction right at $9,700 seems like a bargain in today's marketplace.

[06:05] Because remember, if Stern made that game, they wouldn't put that kind of topper on the

[06:09] machine.

[06:10] They would charge you like $1,500 to $2,000 for that topper.

[06:16] Which then means a Pulp Fiction LE is more like a $7,500 game with a $2,000 topper on

[06:23] top.

[06:24] And this is where we're at people and I think all of us have sent a message to these pinball

[06:30] companies and the question now becomes, will they listen?

[06:35] You know when I interviewed Jack, he said something, you know, he's like, life is short,

[06:39] you only live once, I know this, we all know this.

[06:42] Like this is not a new concept.

[06:44] Everybody thinks they're going to live forever and wait out these pinball prices 50 years

[06:48] from now.

[06:49] But you can't just say that and then charge anything you want for a game, irregardless

[06:55] of what the market demand is, irregardless of what's happening on the secondhand market

[06:59] in your category.

[07:01] You know, life is short and then I have to decide, is it worth it for me to spend $12,000

[07:07] on a game and just a year later I might lose like $4,000 to $5,000.

[07:13] I could spend doing things I'll never forget with my wife and child.

[07:19] It's $4,000 to $5,000 I can invest in something else.

[07:22] And why wouldn't you just sell me this game for the prices you used to just a few years

[07:27] ago?

[07:28] And this is what I'm calling for in pinball.

[07:30] I think Stern pinball needs to charge $11,000 for the LEs and you know why?

[07:35] Because when you're making a thousand, that's what the prices are going to slide down to

[07:39] and even at that price, right?

[07:42] And then the MNLE at $11,000 is still going to slide back down to like $8,000 or $9,000.

[07:49] But if you start at $13,000, you're going to take such a big bath, you're never going

[07:54] to want to buy another Stern LE again.

[07:57] And I know JAWS is going to be the exception.

[08:00] It is going to be the exception to the rule because it's Keith Elwin.

[08:05] And look, unless Stern wants to only make Keith Elwin games, you know, this is not sustainable.

[08:11] But I really do believe when JAWS LE gets shown to the world and because the last two

[08:15] years of themes have been underwhelming and the last two years of pinball machines haven't

[08:21] really put much mechanical magic into the games, I think there are a lot of people out

[08:26] there who have been waiting on the sidelines like me, a lot of people out there that if

[08:31] they see JAWS and it's loaded and it looks amazing, I think you're going to see a day

[08:36] one sellout of JAWS LE at $13,000.

[08:40] Now look, do I think the game is going to go up in value over $13,000 as we're witnessing

[08:48] all these other games go down and down and down.

[08:51] And I don't fully know yet.

[08:52] It depends how amazing this game is.

[08:55] Like every single game Keith Elwin makes is not going to become the best game in the history

[08:59] of pinball people.

[09:01] He's going to eventually run a little thin on ideas.

[09:04] But if this game looks like it's better than Godzilla, if it's more friendly, more fun,

[09:09] more amazing than Godzilla and Godzilla is arguably his best game, you know, I don't know

[09:14] how it's going to do that without all the assets.

[09:16] Godzilla has every single asset you want.

[09:18] If you love Godzilla, that game looks like they held nothing back.

[09:22] So are we going to see something similar with JAWS pinball?

[09:26] You know, there's people out there that don't like JAWS.

[09:28] They think it's a slow movie.

[09:29] They think it's not going to work in pinball format.

[09:31] They think it's not going to have the energy you need to make an exciting pinball game.

[09:35] So we shall see.

[09:36] We're going to see it in just a few weeks.

[09:38] All right, so look, that's going to happen, but that's not going to happen every single

[09:42] time and it's not going to happen every single month and it's not going to happen every single

[09:46] day.

[09:47] So if I were a betting man, I think JAWS might see a little blip in value because there's

[09:52] going to be FOMO in the first month.

[09:54] But then I think after that, if you ask me, do I think you'll be able to get a JAWS LE

[09:59] for less than $13,000 sometime in 2024?

[10:04] You know, looking at the market right now, I think the answer has to be yes.

[10:07] I think everything is starting to head south and it never used to be like this.

[10:11] You know, I'm just shocked when I see Jurassic Park 30th.

[10:14] Let's talk about this a little bit.

[10:16] You know, what happened to the days you unboxed a game and maybe you wanted to move it on.

[10:20] Maybe it wasn't the game for you and you might list it for like $500 less than a distro is

[10:26] selling it for.

[10:27] But remember, this is a brand new game.

[10:30] This isn't like a two year old game or a four year old Jurassic Park.

[10:33] This is brand new out of the box Jurassic Park and the person who bought it and it's more

[10:38] than just one for sale.

[10:39] If this was just one guy trying to move it on, I would say, you know what, Chris, maybe

[10:43] this is not indicative of the market, but there's like three to four of them where the price

[10:47] on Pinside are all $11,000, which means people are willing to lose $2,000 instantly on buying

[10:55] a brand new game.

[10:57] Never used to see that before.

[10:59] Guns and Roses Collector's Editions now are all the way down.

[11:03] They've slid all the way down from the high of around $20,000.

[11:08] Now you can get one for $13,000 or best offer, which means this game has come all the way

[11:14] down to $12,500, which is where a Jersey Jack Collector's Edition should be.

[11:20] They're not going to sell a thousand Elton Johns that don't have as much demand as GNR

[11:26] did and you have a thousand of them at $15,000 up pop.

[11:30] How do you expect to sell those games when Guns and Roses CE is sitting there for $13,000

[11:37] and there's only $500,000 in the world and GNR had more demand?

[11:41] Now I know people are going to be like, well, Guns and Roses now is not a good game.

[11:45] Everyone's realized there's no flow.

[11:47] We will see if there's a code update today.

[11:49] I heard there's going to be one.

[11:51] I'm not expecting huge things from a Jersey Jack code update.

[11:55] You get the sense that they really don't care about going back and making these games perfect.

[12:00] But again, if they listen and they do that, these games will hold more value.

[12:06] But we're seeing a lot of market collapse happening around us.

[12:10] And all this does to me is say these companies are either going to wake up or they're going

[12:16] to die a death by a thousand cuts.

[12:19] They're going to have to do something.

[12:21] They can't just sit around and have these big factories and not have the orders come

[12:27] in.

[12:28] And remember when I interviewed Jack, right?

[12:30] Remember that great interview I did Saturday?

[12:32] I said, Jack, do you think we've hit the price ceiling?

[12:36] And what did Jack say?

[12:38] He said, I don't think so really.

[12:40] Like he didn't say no.

[12:41] He thinks there's more room to grow.

[12:44] There's more price climbing that can be done.

[12:47] And then when I asked Mike, one of the biggest distributors and dealers in the entire country,

[12:52] Mike, do you think we've hit the price ceiling?

[12:54] And what was his answer?

[12:56] He said, I hope so.

[12:57] I hope so.

[12:59] Distros and dealers are getting destroyed by these prices.

[13:04] Destroyed.

[13:05] They don't want to make people unhappy.

[13:06] They don't want to tie up all of their revenue in games that don't sell.

[13:11] You think anybody who's a distro wants to sell someone a Jurassic Park and two days later,

[13:15] the guy seeing on the internet, he could have saved $2,000 if he just weighed it.

[13:21] And now the incentive is to just wait all the time.

[13:24] And like I said, if everybody's waiting and nobody's buying, then what happens to pinball

[13:29] real fast?

[13:30] I mean, we kind of think like nothing can cause pinball to collapse.

[13:34] Like this pinball market's going to be strong forever.

[13:37] Nobody's going to wake up and nothing can happen that's ever going to make pinball see

[13:40] terrible, lean years.

[13:43] But people, it's all about supply and demand.

[13:46] And if you have 12 pinball companies oversaturating the pinball market with so much inventory

[13:52] at such a high price, that's a recipe for disaster.

[13:57] Throw into that mix.

[13:59] Most of these themes are not take my money now kinds of themes.

[14:03] Throw into the mix that these games are very mechanically missing a lot of magic and engineering.

[14:10] Throw into the mix that every single one of you that's been in this hobby for at least

[14:16] five years, not the newbies.

[14:18] The newbies don't get it.

[14:19] All these companies are operating as if all of us are COVID pinball newbies.

[14:25] You know who they are.

[14:26] They're the guys who came into this hobby over the last three years.

[14:30] They don't know the history of pinball.

[14:32] They don't know what things used to cost.

[14:34] They don't know what real pinball magic mechanically is.

[14:37] They're just getting their feet wet.

[14:39] They got excited.

[14:40] They got bit by the pinball bug and they started buying during COVID.

[14:44] They were bored.

[14:45] They were at home.

[14:46] They had some money.

[14:48] They found a new community.

[14:49] They found a new identity.

[14:51] They found a new online persona to call themselves and all of a sudden they're pinball experts

[14:56] and they're putting up all this stuff and they know everything about pinball and they drop

[14:59] $100,000 on pinball machines and they do this, this, this to the machines.

[15:03] They think everything is amazing.

[15:04] Every mod is amazing.

[15:05] You know who they are.

[15:07] They do all this stuff and their excitement is great and their enthusiasm is great.

[15:12] What they don't know is this, that we had the same excitement they did.

[15:17] We spent that much money as they did, but when we spent that much money, we got twice

[15:21] as many games.

[15:23] When we sold our games, we didn't lose any money.

[15:26] They don't remember the pinball period in which pinball buying and selling was not something

[15:32] that gave us agita.

[15:33] It wasn't something that kept us up at night.

[15:36] It wasn't something our wives were mad about because we could always point at this hobby

[15:40] and say, hey, you don't really lose much.

[15:44] For those of us who bought MSRP years ago, you also loved COVID because you could sell

[15:49] to the newbies.

[15:51] You could make an extraordinary profit on these newbies and we saw it happening not

[15:55] just with scalpers, not just with people trading their games.

[15:59] We saw it happening with the distributors.

[16:01] Remember the days in COVID when distributors were like, I'm all sold out.

[16:05] I got nothing.

[16:06] Then all of a sudden a Godzilla LE would pop up in their inventory for $18,000.

[16:12] They were holding back their own inventory and scalping the community and then saying

[16:18] they were doing nothing wrong.

[16:20] Just hiding it behind is like, oh yeah, I'm selling for a customer.

[16:22] You're not selling for a customer.

[16:25] You're selling to put food on the plate.

[16:27] Look, could you blame them?

[16:28] Could you blame them?

[16:29] People were lining up at the door to buy these things for dumb prices.

[16:33] People are spending $20,000 on Stranger Things LEs and Jurassic Park LEs.

[16:39] People want $50,000 for a magic girl just because some of the mechs work now.

[16:44] Now everybody's waking up and realizing we can't do this.

[16:48] We can spend $45,000 on three Jersey Jack CEs.

[16:53] We can spend 40 grand on three Stern LEs that don't even come with toppers and then

[16:59] they're going to ask me $2,000 for a topper.

[17:02] We can't wake up in a world in which a Black Knight topper was once $480 and now it's

[17:08] $1,500 for the same exact thing.

[17:11] My point on this episode is this.

[17:13] A lot of great pinball is going to come out, but people are not going to buy it.

[17:17] They are not going to spend this much money if everything on the used market is just tanking.

[17:24] Somebody has to wave the white flag.

[17:26] Somebody's got to have the guts to put their pride aside and realize that they will make

[17:32] more profit if they bring the prices back down.

[17:36] Who will it be?

[17:38] Will it be Jersey Jack or Stern?

[17:40] If any one of them lowers their prices, that is going to be the greatest weapon they could

[17:44] fire at their competition.

[17:47] They all act like, oh, we're not competing.

[17:49] Like, oh yeah, it's all great.

[17:50] Kumbaya.

[17:51] No, these companies are competing with each other.

[17:54] There is not enough room for all these companies and it's going to be very competitive.

[17:59] It's going to be a battleground and I just think we're all over it.

[18:03] I think we're all over it and I don't know about you, but I know about me and I make

[18:07] a good living in life and I have a lot of excess money that I can play with every month.

[18:12] But more and more, I'm just like, ah, like why?

[18:14] Like I would absolutely be looking to put an Elton John in my home if it was $8,500,

[18:21] maybe $9,000 at most.

[18:24] There's no way I can justify getting one at $12,000, especially as LEs of GNR are $7,000.

[18:31] And that means like Godfather and Toy Story LEs are about to hit $6,500.

[18:37] Let me repeat that.

[18:38] A Jersey Jack LE is going to be the same price as a Stern Pro pretty soon simply because

[18:44] they oversaturated, they made too many and they charged too much and everything heads

[18:49] south.

[18:50] You know, if I were Jersey Jack marketing, you probably can't do it now because you sold

[18:54] all these Elton John's or you priced them and you said this is what it's going to be.

[18:58] Here's what I would do if I was Jersey Jack.

[19:00] Look, you got Brett Abbas, you got Leonard Abbas, you got billionaires backing you.

[19:04] Make a bold move.

[19:05] Make a bold move that nobody expects.

[19:07] And I know you can't lower the price now and you might have Matrix and you might have Harry

[19:11] Potter around the corner, but the bold move on Elton John is to cap it.

[19:15] I think they need to cap it.

[19:17] I think if they want to move this game, I would say we're only going to make 2,000 Elton

[19:21] John machines.

[19:22] Right?

[19:23] We've been playing this game around for a few months.

[19:25] We look at the demand, we look at the prices, we've heard the feedback.

[19:28] We know you guys want exclusivity.

[19:30] We know you want the premium product.

[19:32] There will be 1000 collectors editions made and 1000 platinum editions of the game made.

[19:38] That way you're not pissing off anybody.

[19:40] There are the same number of them in the world.

[19:42] They are completely different art packages.

[19:44] They are completely different offerings in terms of trims and accessories.

[19:48] And you say you're going to make 2,000 and then all of a sudden Jersey Jack has read

[19:52] the market.

[19:53] They've positioned themselves as more of a high end exclusive white glove bespoke pinball

[19:58] companies which is what I think they need to do.

[20:00] They're not going to win this volume war.

[20:02] Because the last thing you want to see if you say your premium is a $7,000 guns and

[20:07] roses.

[20:08] You know that's what's killing these luxury brands out in the world people.

[20:11] You know it's killing Louis Vuitton sales and Gucci and all these luxury items that

[20:15] people don't really need is stuff like the real real and grailed.

[20:20] All these second hand sites where everyone's trading in their luxury items and now you realize

[20:25] well if I just waited a year I could have got those $1,000 jeans for like 200 bucks.

[20:30] And some of you are like $200 for jeans I spend 20 bucks.

[20:33] But you know my point is this is what's happening in other areas of culture will make its way

[20:38] to pinball.

[20:39] And if pinball keeps doing it this way it's not going to work.

[20:42] We are not going to be able to buy these games, lose this much money and it's not going to

[20:47] be sustainable.

[20:48] Look I'm really excited that JAWS is around the corner.

[20:52] It's going to be an anomaly.

[20:53] It's going to be an exception to the rule.

[20:56] But it's also going to be the game that really really tests this market.

[21:00] If it sells out instantly it might reinforce where Jack is at and where Seth Davis is at.

[21:06] But then it's like what's next from Stern?

[21:09] If Stern's next is John Wick or Journey are you going to spend $13,000 on a Journey machine?

[21:16] I really don't know.

[21:17] I don't really think so.

[21:18] I think someone has to lower prices.

[21:20] The thing is this if Stern lowered their prices to 2019 they would just destroy Jersey Jack

[21:25] pinball overnight.

[21:27] If I'm Jersey Jack that's what I'd be afraid of.

[21:30] These guys can absolutely just cut the legs off of us if they go back to like 10-5 for

[21:35] an LE and then they go back to like what like 8,500 for a premium.

[21:39] The reason why they're never going to do it they're never going to do it now because they've

[21:43] sold thousands at these higher prices and then everybody who bought those inflated prices

[21:49] wouldn't buy again.

[21:50] I think Jersey Jack needs to cap their production numbers and not make stuff unlimited.

[21:55] It almost feels like they've both painted themselves into a corner and this is why I've

[21:59] said it.

[22:00] I think they've opened the door for the boutique companies to eat their lunch.

[22:05] Only thing is we all know that the boutique companies still don't have the talent at

[22:09] the same level as Jersey Jack and Stern pinball but they're catching up, they're getting better

[22:14] every year and eventually they're going to get there and if they get there and the price

[22:19] is much lower I wouldn't want to be Stern needing to have distributors absorb like

[22:24] 4,000 games every few months because it's not going to happen.
