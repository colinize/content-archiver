[00:18] Happy Monday morning, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:20] Welcome to episode 512 of Canadian Pimball podcast.

[00:25] Got a very special guest on this episode.

[00:27] Mr. Ben Heck is going to join the show.

[00:30] Now for those of you out there who know the history of Ben Heck and Retro Atomic Zombie

[00:35] Adventure Land, I think you're going to be in for a treat because there aren't many

[00:39] people who actually have had the experience of trying to work with J-Pop to get a game

[00:45] out the door.

[00:46] So I'm going to air that interview in a little bit.

[00:48] Now before I do that, I want to say that we're on October people.

[00:52] This is it.

[00:53] We could see guns and roses end of this week.

[00:55] Now what I think Jersey Jack Pimball should do, and I'm surprised they're not doing this

[00:59] yet, but they might do this.

[01:00] I think they might announce that guns and roses is the next machine from Jersey Jack Pimball.

[01:06] And I think they should do what Spooky Pimball did.

[01:09] I think they should announce the game this Thursday or Friday, and I think they should announce

[01:13] that the order banks for the collector's editions of guns and roses will go on sale Monday

[01:20] at 9 a.m.

[01:21] I know it's exactly what Spooky did, but let me tell you it exactly worked perfectly for

[01:26] Spooky Pimball and Rick and Morty.

[01:27] And I think Jersey Jack Pimball really should do this.

[01:30] The hype is going to be there.

[01:32] The game is going to deliver.

[01:33] People keep saying, canada, you're going to be wrong again.

[01:36] It's going to be Willy Wonka all over again.

[01:38] I'm here to tell you.

[01:39] I'm here to tell you I might have been wrong on Wonka, but this time I'm so confident

[01:44] I'm right that you guys are going to really love this game.

[01:47] I'm willing to bet it.

[01:48] I'm willing to bet the podcasting farm on this game.

[01:51] You heard it here first.

[01:52] All right.

[01:53] So let's air this interview with Ben Hack.

[01:55] Look, everyone is talking about Deeproot.

[01:58] It's hard to avoid this thing, but I mean it when I say it.

[02:01] This is it.

[02:02] This week, this interview, I wanted to do this interview with Ben before I did my last

[02:06] podcast, but I'm done.

[02:08] Until they show a working game, there's really nothing left to discuss with this company.

[02:12] The only other date that I think we're all looking at is the middle of this month.

[02:16] The virtual pinball expo, will they show up with something, will they change our minds,

[02:21] can they get something completely working in the next couple of weeks?

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:25] When you have years to figure it out, what does a few weeks do for you?

[02:29] I don't get it.

[02:30] You had years to get it right.

[02:32] So let's talk to Ben Hack, what it was like being back there with John Papaduke and

[02:36] what his thoughts are on Deeproot pinball and what we're going to see from him with Chicago

[02:41] gaming company, Ben Hack, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:43] Joining Canadian pinball podcast with no NDA in place, Mr. Ben Hack.

[02:49] Ben, welcome back to the show.

[02:50] Oh, hi.

[02:51] Chris, thanks for having me.

[02:53] It's, you know, Ben, I thought of you immediately this past week and I guess it's not hard to guess

[02:58] why.

[02:59] So I just want to come out of the gate right away because you were involved with this

[03:04] game like eight years ago when it was Ben Hack's zombie adventure land.

[03:09] What were your thoughts, Ben?

[03:10] When you saw this game trying to reveal itself this past Monday, why does it take so long?

[03:16] All right.

[03:17] Well, actually, I didn't think that because I know why.

[03:20] Why?

[03:21] Because John, let's talk about that.

[03:25] So yeah, maybe we should talk about the history behind that because I think people are

[03:28] a little longer.

[03:29] Yeah, let's start with the history.

[03:30] So like walk us through it because you've been involved with Raza from the very beginning.

[03:35] Walk us through like how you got connected with him because this is like an eight year in

[03:39] the making story.

[03:40] Oh, it's culture to nine now actually.

[03:43] Yeah, I can, I still remember exactly how it happened.

[03:47] Yeah, I think it was spring 2011, right?

[03:50] And that was back when I was doing my show, my sponsor show, you know, the Ben Hack show.

[03:56] Anyway, we had Jerry Ellsworth on who's a really well-known engineer like in the video game

[04:02] Geek Circles.

[04:04] And we were doing an episode about Pimball Machines, right?

[04:06] And this is, this was after I'd done the, um, the bill packs in Pimball before I started

[04:11] America's most haunted or ghost squad or whatever I was calling it at the time.

[04:15] Okay.

[04:16] Anyway, on the video I see a comment.

[04:18] It's like, well, if you want to know how to really make Pimball, you should talk to me.

[04:22] And it was from John Papaduke, right?

[04:24] The legend at the time, right?

[04:26] Yeah.

[04:27] And I think he had already started Zidware at that point.

[04:30] I think so.

[04:31] And so I'm like, oh, wow, it's like, um, you know, yes, I mean, I knew who he was.

[04:36] Obviously.

[04:37] And so I think he came to visit my shop not that long after.

[04:40] So this would have been 2011.

[04:42] And then he's like, oh, we, you know, he basically said, ask me if I wanted to help make Pimball

[04:46] and I was like, oh, yeah, because at that time that this was like a couple years before

[04:50] spooky was created, right?

[04:52] So it seemed like a really cool opportunity, right?

[04:55] Yep.

[04:56] Um, so then I think the idea was he wanted me to help him with Magic Girl.

[05:00] And then along the way, he's like, oh, what if we made a game with you in it and they're

[05:04] like zombies?

[05:05] And I'm like, um, I'm not.

[05:06] First of all, I was like, why?

[05:09] And I think his, his reasoning for that, that's the thing.

[05:12] I want people to realize that it was not my idea.

[05:13] I would never make a game starting myself.

[05:15] Right.

[05:16] I'm a different, I'm a different kind of self-centered, egotistical prick.

[05:19] Yeah.

[05:20] Not that kind, right?

[05:21] Right.

[05:22] Uh, and he's like, well, you know, you know, you've got a lot of fans.

[05:25] We're like, you know, video game people and younger people.

[05:27] And, and I think it'd be cool if we had something that would kind of like engage younger

[05:31] people more.

[05:32] And none of which, by the way, Ben have $10,000 for a pinball machine.

[05:35] So great market research, J-pop on that one.

[05:38] Well, as we've seen in pinball, a lot of market research isn't done at all.

[05:43] No.

[05:44] Uh, yeah.

[05:45] But anyway, I'm like, okay, fine.

[05:46] And then, you know, he's like, oh, and then your likeness will be in it.

[05:49] So, you know, you could make some money or something.

[05:52] And even at that time, I'm pretty sure, yeah, I don't have the email anymore because I

[05:57] have my Gmail auto purge after five years.

[06:00] But I think it was like in 2015, remember, there was like empty cabinet gate and then there

[06:06] was like, pentasia gate or whatever.

[06:08] Yeah.

[06:09] So he came to pinball expo when people were expecting to see games and he had empty cabinets.

[06:13] It was really funny, right?

[06:14] He puts up the translate to Raza and he immediately takes it down because he sees people taking

[06:20] pictures.

[06:21] Like, it's like John lives in a world in which he doesn't understand social media or

[06:25] or cell phone cameras.

[06:27] But there was no game, right?

[06:28] The game's remained a mystery.

[06:30] He had everyone sign an NDA and he was showing owners.

[06:35] There was like a blog site that had a password to get to.

[06:38] And that was the only place people saw any momentum on any of these projects.

[06:41] Oh, see, that was long after I lost.

[06:44] He connects with you.

[06:46] He's this pinball legend at the time.

[06:48] His games are pretty famous.

[06:49] And then I was going to save one thing.

[06:51] Yeah, yeah.

[06:52] That's why I brought a few dozen, fifteen thing.

[06:54] So like when they had the empty cabinet gate and then I think more importantly, like when

[06:57] it clearly imploded and then what was it?

[06:59] Bill Brands tried to save it.

[07:01] Bill Brandes with Pentasia.

[07:03] At that time, I actually searched through my email and just out of posterity.

[07:08] I think I might afford it to some friends.

[07:09] But I actually found the email where John was talking about Raza or Ben Hexambia or whatever.

[07:14] And I actually said to him, shouldn't you finish Magical first?

[07:17] Right.

[07:18] Looking back now, I think John probably just wanted to use my board set.

[07:21] Right.

[07:22] Because I don't think he decided out of one.

[07:24] And then I think he ended up making like a p-rock rip off or something.

[07:28] Like he had that Captain Nemo guy do it.

[07:30] Yeah.

[07:31] So let me ask you a question Ben.

[07:33] So like what was it actually like working with John?

[07:38] Was there like a, are you sitting in a room with him?

[07:41] Are you brainstorming?

[07:42] Who's doing the actual work?

[07:44] I like barely worked with him at all.

[07:46] That's another thing to think about.

[07:47] Like he wanted to do stuff with me.

[07:49] Then he wanted, then he had, I don't know if it's zombie Yeti.

[07:52] Oh yeah.

[07:53] You know what?

[07:54] Jeremy told me this.

[07:55] Like Jeremy was a fan of my stuff.

[07:57] And that was one of the reasons he wanted to help John.

[07:58] He's like, oh, I can draw a picture of Ben.

[08:00] Then obviously he's moved on to bigger and better things since then.

[08:03] But yeah, it was like, sometimes John might come to my shop on weekends.

[08:07] And sometimes I would go down to his shop.

[08:09] But I honestly, we probably didn't, I don't know, maybe eight or nine meetings like that.

[08:15] Because the thing was I just got the sense that, oh, you know, he just wants me to be an

[08:18] apprentice and blah, blah, blah.

[08:20] And I was like, I don't want to make his games on him in my own games.

[08:24] And basically spooky.

[08:25] Let me do that.

[08:26] Right.

[08:27] And you know, we only sold 150 Americans most honoured, but thus far they've sold zero

[08:31] razas.

[08:32] Well, actually, no, they've sold a lot of razas, but they haven't built.

[08:37] Yeah, I was just about to say that.

[08:39] That's 150 times more efficient and productive than the current raza out in the marketplace.

[08:45] So and Ben, there was a moment and you told this story where John said to customers,

[08:50] and you said this was the moment you knew he didn't have any idea what it took to build

[08:53] something that he was going to offer you and him to fly to customers homes and build

[08:59] the games in their homes for them for like a thousand dollars extra.

[09:02] Some crazy number, right?

[09:06] I want to say, when was that?

[09:08] How was it?

[09:09] MGC when he announced it?

[09:10] Because I remember we were, they always had, it was at the Sheraton Brookfield, which

[09:13] is a suburb of Milwaukee.

[09:16] And they always have a lot of the speakers were like in the bar restaurant area, right?

[09:20] Yep.

[09:21] So I can still pick this.

[09:23] What I want to say, it was 2012 when that happened.

[09:27] And I'm sitting there, I think this was before Smoky started.

[09:31] I'm sitting there and he says that and I was just like, what?

[09:35] I just couldn't believe it because I travel a lot, right?

[09:40] I know how expensive travel is.

[09:43] And I was like, are you freaking, well, this is what I'm thinking in my head.

[09:45] I was like, does he have any idea how much travel costs?

[09:48] Like let alone assembling the game like a thousand dollars to ship two people around.

[09:53] You'd lose money.

[09:54] Right.

[09:55] And this is a story I've heard from many people that John just doesn't really have a sense

[10:01] of what it costs and what it takes, right?

[10:03] He loves designing stuff.

[10:05] He loves talking about pinball design.

[10:07] But Ben, do you think that's, if you were to summarize why we still don't see a working

[10:12] raza in its 2020, why do you think that is?

[10:15] Is it just a lack of understanding of manufacturing that is just this guy continues to hoodwink

[10:20] everyone with art?

[10:21] What do you think?

[10:22] I think I don't know.

[10:24] It was one of your not so long ago podcasts where you talked about the engineers being

[10:28] the real heroes of pinball.

[10:31] And I think that that was a very poignant statement.

[10:33] It's very true.

[10:34] Like, you don't, we don't talk about the guy who figured out the champion pub, Mac.

[10:39] I'm guarantee John did not design the what actually made the trunk rotate, even though

[10:43] it's pretty simple.

[10:46] The designers are usually like IDMN.

[10:48] Right.

[10:49] Has a woman designed a pinball machine yet?

[10:51] I don't think they, yeah, I don't even need to de-genderize that.

[10:54] It's so monolithic.

[10:56] Yeah, so I think a lot of times, yeah, people, it's kind of like, you know, a tour theory

[11:02] with like movie directors, you know, like Tim Burton is not there painting all the

[11:06] sets and drawing everything.

[11:07] No, he's got an army of people doing it.

[11:09] And that's what it was like at Williams.

[11:10] But another thing people don't realize is like Williams was huge.

[11:13] Williams was much bigger than any of the companies now, right?

[11:16] So like every large company, there's an, you know, you have Bill Gates, but then you

[11:20] have an army of engineers designed in the iPod below him, right?

[11:23] Right.

[11:24] And you, I think you kind of had that scale, you know, with Williams back in the 80s and

[11:28] 90s, but I don't really think any of the companies now have that big a scale because even

[11:32] if Stern, you know, I know you love to talk about how much Stern sells and they do, but

[11:36] they're still as far as I know, no, we're close to what Williams was doing back in the

[11:40] day.

[11:41] So I guess that I'm what I'm saying is that army of support is gone.

[11:44] And so designers have to wear more hats than they did in the past.

[11:48] Right.

[11:49] And we tell, yeah, and the reason why I bring that up is we've seen pictures of deep

[11:53] rude studios, right?

[11:54] And I've seen the Utah facility, the one thing we haven't seen and it still remains

[11:59] a mystery.

[12:00] There's no factory.

[12:01] There's literally no factory anywhere to be seen.

[12:03] And is that, do you think that's just like, how do you, how do you get to that point,

[12:07] Ben, if you're going to, if you're going to start a pinball company today, right?

[12:10] In 2020, isn't the factory the first thing you would build?

[12:14] Well, or you would build it alongside your initial game development.

[12:18] And because I think the best example of that fallacy is, is the Dutch.

[12:22] Well, not all the, not all the Dutch people, but you know, Dutch pinball.

[12:26] Dutch pinball.

[12:27] I mean, they were the bells of the ball, the lords of all creation when they showed up

[12:31] with those three big Lebowski's.

[12:34] But honestly, it's a lot easier to build a pinball machine than it is to manufacture it

[12:38] by a long shot, especially now like weird things you wouldn't think about.

[12:44] There's always things that are going, becoming obsolete, hard to find.

[12:48] Like right now because of COVID, you know, they've turned every point of sale into a Detroit

[12:52] gas station.

[12:53] Right.

[12:54] And actually created a pet G shortage, which is affected pinball manufacturers.

[12:58] There is a hidden shortage all tied to those stupid barriers, right?

[13:01] So there's all in lumbars going up through the roof.

[13:04] There's always something going on like supply chain things.

[13:07] And you know, if you're missing one bolt, the game doesn't go out the door, right?

[13:11] So yeah, people like George Gomez, they keep that machine very well oiled.

[13:15] And it's a very important and difficult part of the process.

[13:19] Because ultimately, either the day, you might get pre-orders or pre-sales.

[13:23] Like us, you know, Tippers not doing that.

[13:25] But you do not get your money until you ship a physical box of lights and switches out

[13:30] the door.

[13:31] Right.

[13:32] And if you don't have every part you need to make that, you're in trouble, including lockdown

[13:36] bars.

[13:37] Yeah, we're going to talk about the pinbar.

[13:38] But so then you think about that for a minute, right?

[13:41] Just getting one game on the line and out the door is a challenge with all the parts you

[13:46] need for that one game.

[13:47] Do you think they made a colossal mistake developing multiple titles at once instead

[13:52] of focusing on one game?

[13:55] If their intention is to actually produce, yes.

[14:00] First of all, no one's going to buy those games.

[14:03] Secondly, they're wasting their time.

[14:04] Like if they have goonies, apparently they do because of the slow.

[14:07] Well, look like a pitch deck to me.

[14:09] I'm sure you probably thought that as well since you're in marketing.

[14:11] It's an investor deck.

[14:12] Absolutely.

[14:13] That's a deck to show investors what they have.

[14:16] Which is why you'd make a bunch of concepts.

[14:19] No pinball company shows like 10 concepts ahead, right?

[14:22] No.

[14:23] Unless you're trying to say, oh, this is what we're going to have in the future, right?

[14:26] Yeah, so that should also be a red flag to people.

[14:30] But I would say it seems more like they're trying to look for future investment than, hey,

[14:35] here's what's coming next.

[14:36] But how do you get investment if there's nothing being built?

[14:39] Like what are people investing in?

[14:40] They're just investing in a design studio.

[14:43] Well, John didn't build anything and he's still got Bill Brands, American pinball and

[14:47] Robert to invest in him.

[14:48] Bill Brands, good friend of the show.

[14:50] But that's the thing.

[14:51] Do you think this is it?

[14:52] Ben, if he can't get this game out the door, do you think John Papadouk has used his

[14:57] lifelines and he's done?

[15:00] If he fails up any further, he'll be getting a government bailout.

[15:05] It'll be like the too pretty to fail bailout.

[15:09] Because Trump will be like, you should see the artwork.

[15:12] It's tremendous artwork.

[15:13] John totally do it himself.

[15:15] You can get tired of places.

[15:17] They've never seen artwork is good.

[15:19] No one's ever seen artwork is good.

[15:20] Beautiful.

[15:21] But on a serious note, I mean, do you think this is it?

[15:28] Is it worth it?

[15:29] I mean, when we see that, like, here's a crazy part, right?

[15:32] Ben, we're not even talking about the game.

[15:34] Where's the game?

[15:35] Yes.

[15:36] I've said this before, Stern saved Zidware the right way by hiring Jeremy Packer because

[15:42] Stern's smart.

[15:43] You know?

[15:44] Right.

[15:45] And look at Jeremy.

[15:47] Since then, right?

[15:48] Look at the success he's had, look at the amount of games he's been on.

[15:52] And it feels good.

[15:53] I mean, he came out of that hell and now he feels redeemed.

[15:56] Yeah, imagine if Jeremy was trapped in the hell or what John didn't even want people

[16:00] to know who he was.

[16:01] So Jeremy was like a princess.

[16:03] Like there was like this ugly king and his beautiful queen was trapped in a tower.

[16:08] So no one could see her like Rapunzel.

[16:10] That's what, because John didn't want people to know who Jeremy was at first, right?

[16:13] And then the young lad, Gary Stern, well, I guess he's an old lad.

[16:17] He climbs the hair and rescues the princess from the tower.

[16:21] And what's left, right?

[16:22] Right.

[16:23] But no, imagine if Jeremy would have been stuck in that, he'd have all this artwork, but

[16:28] none of his games would have gotten made.

[16:31] But in the world we live in, we have tens of thousands of games with amazing Jeremy

[16:35] artwork on them from Stern.

[16:37] Right.

[16:38] And part of me does feel there's a little bit of karma in play right now, right?

[16:42] We've got Jeremy's Avengers flying off the shelves.

[16:45] People love it.

[16:46] It's one of the most beautiful looking Stern machines ever.

[16:48] Ninja Turtles, same thing, great art package.

[16:51] And then we get to Raza, right?

[16:53] They replaced Jeremy's art with new art.

[16:55] And I will say this, I don't think the current Raza cabinet looks nearly as good as the

[17:01] one Jeremy did all those years ago.

[17:03] You mean the art?

[17:04] Yeah, the art.

[17:05] The art itself.

[17:06] It's just, it's like, well, which one are you talking about?

[17:08] Because the very first one was with me.

[17:10] And then I think he had Matt Andrews redo the second one where it turned into like zombies

[17:16] from space or whatever retro atomic.

[17:18] Yeah, yeah, there was like some had like Godzilla on them, some had it.

[17:22] Right.

[17:23] They would have gotten sued for and they've changed it.

[17:25] Yeah.

[17:26] I mean, they had the Robbie the Robot, Godzilla and something else.

[17:30] There was like at least three strikes on that play field.

[17:32] Did you laugh on Monday when you saw the botched reveal?

[17:35] I was pretty surprised that they did what they did.

[17:38] Like, if they, if they pulled the plug that last minute because of outside feedback, it

[17:42] means that they weren't taking any internal feedback and that someone had draconian control

[17:47] inside of the company.

[17:49] Right?

[17:50] Where it's like, oh, this, Steve Richie has a saying, if two people tell you something sucks,

[17:55] it sucks.

[17:56] All right.

[17:57] That's what he says.

[17:58] But Ben, Ben, a lot more than two people say, can he just pinball podcast sucks?

[18:01] Come on.

[18:02] Well, it's because he don't drone on about rules for hours on end and spend half the

[18:08] podcast laughing.

[18:09] It's true.

[18:10] Well, my point was if internally they didn't realize or accept there was a problem until

[18:16] they had external inputs, that's a very bad sign because everyone's wondering this, right?

[18:21] Like, how did it come to this point?

[18:23] It's the emperor's new clothes.

[18:25] He didn't realize his naked until he walks down the street and everyone laughs at him.

[18:29] And I'm saying this just from the information that's publicly available.

[18:32] Right.

[18:33] It's, yeah, I mean, what's crazy is everyone's just trying to figure out, well, how did all

[18:38] these people who work there?

[18:40] How did nobody stand over this machine that week or the night before the media are flying

[18:45] in and say, hey, it doesn't work.

[18:47] We can't have them come over to witness and experience this because Ben, I keep hearing

[18:53] and again, like I didn't sign an NDA, but I keep hearing from from some of the folks who

[18:57] went down there.

[18:59] They did not play a game very, very long.

[19:02] Like, it wasn't, they didn't have a pinball experience.

[19:05] They had a, a tour of a company intending to do all these innovative things in pinball.

[19:12] That's crazy to me.

[19:13] But people who played this Rosalind game at Houston last year, which is the part that I can't

[19:17] figure out.

[19:18] How did you, it's, and it's a, that was almost a year ago, right?

[19:20] How it was, what was the feedback?

[19:23] It was okay, but the ramp was impossible or something.

[19:25] Yeah.

[19:26] And even then, it was like, the feedback wasn't bad at all.

[19:30] So you're kind of thinking, well, okay, make the ramp better and then make the game.

[19:36] Unless, unless you, unless you have someone like John saying, they said my Totten Ramp wouldn't

[19:41] work, which means every ramp I ever designed will work.

[19:44] Right.

[19:45] That was this big thing.

[19:46] He would all, well, John is like the fat washed up middle aged guy who can't stop talking

[19:51] about when he was the high school quarterback.

[19:54] But in his case, that's Williams.

[19:56] And it's like, yes, okay, yes, the Totten Ramp was amazing, but that doesn't give you

[20:00] some magical immunity where, because clearly like the Rams and Magic Girl didn't work,

[20:04] the Rams and Raza weren't that great.

[20:07] So you know what I mean?

[20:09] There's some sort of weird ego at play for my, for my opinion outside looking in.

[20:14] I mean, I don't, I mean, I really don't know that much about John personally.

[20:17] I do know he is kind of egotistical and I think you could see that and it kind of goes,

[20:22] I think you, I don't know if it is you or someone else who is talking about all these

[20:25] pimple companies is like, you know, what, what, what did they keep messing up?

[20:28] And the thing that I see is that they don't iterate their games at all.

[20:31] Like, you think about it.

[20:33] Deep root was supposed to be what March 2019, right?

[20:36] Yeah.

[20:37] And what?

[20:38] A year and a half later, the game is still not showable.

[20:40] So what would they have had last spring?

[20:43] So while they, they, they delayed that obviously because they needed to.

[20:47] But then COVID gave them an extra six months.

[20:50] It's just like when, remember when Hobbit was supposed to launch when there's only two

[20:54] Hobbit movies and then Warner split it into three and it gave Jack an extra year.

[20:58] Right.

[20:59] And he still missed that deadline.

[21:00] Well, but he missed it by less.

[21:03] So anyway, COVID, so if you're that far behind, COVID was a great excuse for deep root,

[21:09] right?

[21:10] And they, apparently, they still weren't ready to launch.

[21:13] Here's what I think happened and this will be a good segue into us talking about some

[21:17] of these innovations.

[21:18] I think the pin bar is the issue because if you think about it, what's the, the, the

[21:23] one new variable, the big variable that they've added into this game that we never saw in

[21:28] Houston, it's the pin bar and getting that thing to work seamlessly within a pin ball

[21:33] experience.

[21:34] I think that's what tank this reveal.

[21:36] I don't think they could get it to work properly.

[21:38] And we heard, right?

[21:39] What's the get properly?

[21:40] It's a touchscreen.

[21:41] I don't know.

[21:42] Well, it's, but it's because it's integrated with the code like the game is all connected

[21:48] through that thing.

[21:49] So you can't just yank it out.

[21:51] It's part of the gameplay experience happens on that touchscreen, which is, which is not

[21:57] a good idea.

[21:58] Yeah, it's not just the start button.

[22:00] It's not just setting the difficulty.

[22:02] It's actually integrated into the entire gameplay experience.

[22:06] And that's why we heard there's one, they used one word in this weekend pinball.

[22:09] They said it was glitchy.

[22:11] That's a, that's a nice way of saying it didn't work.

[22:13] And so do you think Ben, that the pin bar, because that's getting a lot of conversation,

[22:18] what are your thoughts on it as an engineer, as someone who builds stuff?

[22:21] What do you think of this pin bar?

[22:23] Oh, I think it's stupid.

[22:25] How do you really feel?

[22:26] But why?

[22:27] Like, why do you think that?

[22:28] Slaping an LCD into a game is not innovation.

[22:31] It's just window dressing.

[22:32] It's just an animated art, right?

[22:35] And it's, it's, it's very much like dialed in where it's an old man trying to think

[22:41] of what young people think is cool and missing the mark.

[22:45] And it's like, oh, how do I get my kids to play pinball?

[22:49] I know, we need a Fortnite pin, even though that makes no goddamn sense from a theme

[22:52] perspective.

[22:53] For people who love cell phones, let's put a cell phone into the apron and weld the

[23:00] edges of it instead of stamping it and it'll hurt your palms.

[23:03] Although I could, I could pretty much guarantee why that happened.

[23:06] We could talk about that too.

[23:07] Why?

[23:08] Um, because there's only a few lockdown bar stamps in existence and they're, they're

[23:14] coveted.

[23:15] I think Terry has one, Stern has one.

[23:18] So basically, if he's like, I want a lockdown bar and if the two people who have one say no,

[23:23] then he has to weld one.

[23:24] And then someone who's stamped metal, you can give it curves.

[23:27] Like this big press comes in and smashes metal, right?

[23:30] Into your shape, you know?

[23:32] And then that's how you make like a trombone or like a hood of a car.

[23:36] And the curve has actually come from the metal being stretched slightly thinner over certain

[23:40] areas.

[23:41] And that's where you get like the size of a lockdown bar.

[23:43] But since I, I sort of know how to weld, right?

[23:45] So I'm familiar with it.

[23:46] I used to be in the sign business.

[23:47] So what they did with the pin bar was they clearly took a flat piece of stainless steel

[23:51] and then they bent the four sides of it down and then tick welded it and then, uh, basically,

[23:57] you know, sanded it smooth.

[23:59] But so they basically made a box out of steel.

[24:02] Just think about like a cardboard box and how the sides bend to make the box, right?

[24:05] Right.

[24:06] That's basically what they did, which means it has sharp corners because they didn't stamp

[24:09] it.

[24:10] So if they have all this goddamn money, I mean, a stamp.

[24:13] It's not like you can't make one.

[24:14] It's just expensive.

[24:15] So they should have used some of that daddy war box to make their own stamp.

[24:19] If it was like a custom lockdown bar with smooth corners, I think people would have liked

[24:25] it a lot more.

[24:26] Right.

[24:27] And, but that's a huge problem for them because this thing seems to be the cornerstone

[24:31] of the deep root platform.

[24:33] It's on every game, no matter the price point.

[24:36] So if this is the cornerstone of everything they're making and it doesn't work or it's

[24:41] not comfortable, you see how that's going.

[24:43] I can create a problem right then.

[24:44] Because that's why they can't just release.

[24:45] I don't see why it would be glitchy.

[24:47] It's just a second display.

[24:48] It's not even that high resolution.

[24:50] You know, it's not like hooking up two displays to a single-work computer as rocket science.

[24:54] I don't know.

[24:55] I mean, even if it's something they, it's hard to believe that with all those people

[24:59] they couldn't have gotten at least a stable UI.

[25:01] I mean, a UI is easy.

[25:03] I mean, it's not like you're trying to redo Google or Apple.

[25:07] If it's just a bunch of big touch buttons, I mean, honestly, that shouldn't be a rocket

[25:10] science.

[25:11] So my concern with the my concern with that thing isn't actually if it's glitchy or

[25:15] not because, you know, code, they can fix that.

[25:18] My concern would be you see these games and they're like, oh, we've got a story by blank.

[25:24] It's directed by blank.

[25:25] I would worry that the games are going to have all this goddamn story in it and this

[25:29] going to stop the ball every five seconds and make you touch that screen.

[25:32] That's the concern I'd have.

[25:34] That is an interesting point, right?

[25:35] When you look at the back box, so what did you think of that whole back box with the floating

[25:39] on top of the screen?

[25:40] What are your thoughts on that design?

[25:42] The fact that it has two points of separation, the speakers and the back box, I would agree

[25:47] with Oric.

[25:48] It's stupid and it's overly complicated and expensive.

[25:51] But the wraparound part of the back glass, I thought that was awesome.

[25:55] Yeah, the cool.

[25:57] So they could have done that as one unit and made it less troublesome, probably, or complicated

[26:02] to make.

[26:03] I think someone said the arcade version was going to be like that.

[26:06] Yeah, so I think the arcade version is going to be more like what we saw in Houston.

[26:11] Because it is kind of funny though, because it wraps around, but it still does look like

[26:15] separate images on the side.

[26:18] You would think you wrapped around it up one image.

[26:20] I was discussing that with Oric and I have a theory on why that is.

[26:24] It's like, I'm pretty, okay, obviously that's going to be a piece of pet G or polycarbonate,

[26:30] which are types of plastic.

[26:31] Actually, it's probably polycarbonate because if they have like a 90 degree bend, so polycarbonate

[26:35] is different than acrylic and the fact that you can bend it and it won't shatter.

[26:38] It's, well, it's a poly.

[26:40] So what I imagined they did was they probably backprinted onto a piece of polycarbonate, right?

[26:45] And then used heat to bend the corners up, right?

[26:49] Okay.

[26:50] So the reason why I think they have lightning bolts down the sides of the corners are is because

[26:53] the bending process probably would have distorted the art.

[26:56] So they just have a blank piece of art, aka white lightning bolt to hide that.

[27:00] Gotcha.

[27:01] That would be my theory.

[27:02] There also is supposed to be and we did not see it, artwork that lights up.

[27:06] So again, it's all about art.

[27:09] I know.

[27:10] I know where's the game.

[27:11] Where's the game?

[27:12] It's what matters.

[27:13] Art is bullshit.

[27:14] Sorry about, you know what I mean?

[27:16] Art is like the ice and the cake, but it's the fun part.

[27:20] Yeah, if you don't have the spongy inside, it's not a cake.

[27:22] It's just a pile of frosting.

[27:24] It still is crazy to me too, because even looking at the mechs and raza, I have to say

[27:28] this.

[27:29] I don't think there's anything mechanically in that game that looks like it should have

[27:33] taken two years, three years, five years, seven years.

[27:37] There's a static sculpt of Ned with guns that blink, I guess.

[27:43] And there's some spinning discs and yeah, what's in it?

[27:46] There's nothing.

[27:47] That's where the innovation should be.

[27:48] You go higher.

[27:49] You know, if you're spending good money, then you could hire, you know, you could spend

[27:52] like six figures and get a bunch of engineers.

[27:55] That's the thing.

[27:56] If any company wanted to, that's obviously completely stupid to talk about.

[28:00] But if valve or Tesla or Microsoft or Apple, any big, big, big company, if they sicked

[28:08] a bunch of engineers, I'm making a pinball table, it would just put us all to shame.

[28:12] Oh, yeah.

[28:13] Oh, yeah.

[28:14] So that's the thing.

[28:15] I see that.

[28:16] And I'm like, this is not innovation.

[28:18] And I caught some flak for saying this on Pinside.

[28:20] I'm like, whether or not you like the node boards on Stern, it is an innovation.

[28:25] Right.

[28:26] They are also being innovative by ripping you off for the replacement cost, but that's the

[28:30] same shit Apple does.

[28:32] And you know, it's like innovation would be putting more mechanics onto the game, making

[28:36] the mechanics more reliable, making the game easier to manufacture, making the game lighter,

[28:40] easier to ship.

[28:41] I do like their pin crate thing, like deep roots crate that can collapse.

[28:45] I think that's a cool idea.

[28:46] The pin pod.

[28:47] Yeah.

[28:48] Well, you know, it's more environmentally friendly.

[28:49] It makes it easier to ship the game that also helps with resale.

[28:52] Like, oh, because just like a car resale value is very important.

[28:55] So if they make, you know, the transportation of a game easier, I think that will help.

[28:59] They don't have the game.

[29:00] They don't have the game to transport.

[29:02] Like, I know.

[29:03] I don't get it.

[29:04] I'm going to buy one of those Ben and convert it into a podcasting studio for me.

[29:08] And I'm going to go to shows inside the pin pod.

[29:11] And that's where Canadian will podcast from.

[29:13] You could rent out the pin pod in New York.

[29:15] It'd be like a $3,000 part.

[29:17] Yeah.

[29:18] When I saw that, Ben, it just sends the signal that these guys were all, they're all over

[29:23] the place.

[29:24] There's no focus.

[29:25] Like, well, they're dealing on the all the periphery of pinball, but not the table itself,

[29:30] which is ludicrous.

[29:31] In a way, if you think about it, like, how do you, yeah, how can you sustain a pinball

[29:35] company and the pinball itself?

[29:37] Unless the, unless the intention is to get bought out or to sell all the ideas for other

[29:42] companies, like, who, who's going to buy food truck?

[29:46] Oh, God.

[29:47] Let's talk about the titles real quick, because Bible adventures has been your baby forever.

[29:51] Do you want to go back, we'll go back to this?

[29:53] Yeah, I just want to go back to the cabinet for one more second.

[29:56] Aside from the fact that it's needlessly split with the speaker section, I think the

[29:59] cabinet looks really cool.

[30:01] But here's the big, but the cabinet is obviously styled around the idea of a retro-atomic

[30:06] zombie adventure, right?

[30:07] It's like art deco or 1950s aesthetic styling, right?

[30:12] So I think it's also a little worrying that they styled the cabinet to the actual game

[30:18] itself.

[30:19] Instead of having the cabinet be more ubiquitous.

[30:21] Right, because then food truck looks weird in it or gladiator doesn't make sense.

[30:24] Or Bible adventures in 1950s toaster.

[30:28] Right.

[30:29] So that's a little bit concerning to you because it shows that their focus was a little too

[30:32] narrow on Razaf.

[30:33] Yeah, but also Bennett, it shows that John is in control of this shit.

[30:38] Or way too much control, yeah.

[30:39] I've been saying all the stuff we've been seeing from Deeproot for last year.

[30:43] It's blatantly obvious to me just from what I know of John.

[30:46] Even that hammer-tested logo, it's like, oh, you hired a whole art studio, but you let

[30:49] John design your hammer-tested logo.

[30:52] Right.

[30:53] Lofty.

[30:54] So let me ask you a question.

[30:55] Then we'll go on to some of the stuff we saw recently.

[30:56] But a little bit, let's go into the past a little bit.

[30:59] So Robert Mueller, before he started Deeproot, he connected with you and Charlie, right?

[31:04] But he ever, is it the rumor true that he had tried to acquire spooky ones?

[31:09] I shouldn't speak to that, but I would say, yeah, I mean, he was trying to start a pinball

[31:15] company a couple of years before his current iteration.

[31:18] It's pretty well known.

[31:19] He went around.

[31:20] I think he also met with pinball life.

[31:22] I think he met with some other individuals.

[31:24] Did he ever try to get you to work for Deeproot?

[31:28] I probably shouldn't comment on that either.

[31:31] Okay.

[31:32] All right.

[31:33] And he never tried to get me to do the marketing for them, which I think he should have, because

[31:37] we would not have landed on these titles that they currently have.

[31:41] So when he finally deems-

[31:43] I will say one thing.

[31:44] Yeah.

[31:45] He's right from the start.

[31:46] He's just obsessed with John's work.

[31:48] Or, oh, Magic Girl, it's so amazing.

[31:51] And-

[31:52] I still think Magic Girl is the most beautiful pinball machine that never works.

[31:56] In a way, though, it's like, it's collapsed and evaporated so much money.

[32:00] You always use that word, right?

[32:01] It's evaporated so much money in this habit.

[32:03] Well, the word I use is destroyed wealth, but yes.

[32:06] At some point, we have to just take a step back and say, Jeremy Packer is the reason why

[32:13] we loved Zidware stuff.

[32:15] Jeremy Packer and Matt Andrews.

[32:17] Yeah.

[32:18] Jeremy Packer and Matt Andrews is what we fell in love with.

[32:21] Nothing else worked.

[32:23] There was no gain.

[32:24] There was no code.

[32:26] There was nothing to fall in love with other than what Jeremy delivered.

[32:30] And guess what?

[32:31] Now you can go buy what Jeremy creates all the time at Stern Pimball.

[32:35] And TNA, which was Matt Andrews.

[32:37] Yep.

[32:38] Okay.

[32:39] So, let's talk about fire and Brimstone because Bible adventures was your dream theme.

[32:45] And you-

[32:46] Oh.

[32:47] I know you would say it sarcastically, but you were serious now.

[32:48] Oh, it started as a joke.

[32:50] I read an interview with this week in Pimball in which they were interviewing Robert Mueller.

[32:56] And I think you two, and you guys talked about how you guys met and discussed Bible adventures

[33:00] and Robert came up with fire and Brimstone.

[33:02] So, what did you think-

[33:03] Oh, I still remember the exact moment, actually, yes.

[33:07] Yeah.

[33:08] So, what did you think when you saw fire and Brimstone in that PowerPoint presentation?

[33:12] Well, I knew he was going to-

[33:15] I knew that he had been inspired by my theme years ago, so I was not surprised at all

[33:19] by it.

[33:20] So, how do you feel seeing it there now?

[33:22] Do you feel like, man, where is it?

[33:24] Where-

[33:25] Well, I think it's absolutely the wrong approach to take, you know?

[33:28] Like, making-

[33:29] Well, I think he's also taking my idea.

[33:31] My idea was to make it based off the books of Moses, which makes it compatible with the

[33:34] Jewish religion.

[33:35] I wouldn't say it's necessarily multi-denominational.

[33:38] I would say it's basically compatible with the Jewish religion and the Christian religion

[33:42] because there's essentially the same for the first half of the Old Testament.

[33:46] Right.

[33:47] And that's also why I was going to have any Jesus in it.

[33:49] Also, Jesus is boring.

[33:50] You know, he's as exciting as a bull.

[33:52] Well, yeah, always do is like, split mobs.

[33:55] Yeah, there's no fires of pillar and Egyptians being burned alive and stuff.

[34:00] Right.

[34:01] It was way back in 2011.

[34:03] And every week in my buddies and I were hanging out in my shop and we were making pinballs

[34:07] and stuff.

[34:08] Then we would always go to this place that had a pinball machine.

[34:11] I think they actually had a theater magic.

[34:13] So we'd go there and get pizza for lunch and play theater magic.

[34:16] And we were joking about the worst possible pinball themes, right?

[34:20] And then one of us says, oh, what if it was based off the Bible and then we're all laughing

[34:24] and stuff, right?

[34:26] And but then we started talking about it.

[34:28] Yeah, what would the modes be, right?

[34:30] And like, oh, you got to do this and then you got to collect 10 plays.

[34:33] And the more we talked about it, we're like, wait a minute.

[34:36] This would actually fit the rules of pinball really, really well, right?

[34:39] And this was like nine years ago, right?

[34:42] So then it just kind of kept going as like a running joke.

[34:45] Like, oh, my dream theme is to make an Old Testament Puma machine.

[34:48] But then people realized it actually meant it.

[34:50] But then I never, I never really got around to doing it, right?

[34:53] Right.

[34:54] And then I want to say, John was the first one to ape the idea.

[34:57] Like, one of my friends found that John had registered a domain of like creationpinball.com

[35:03] and done one of his classic single page websites, you know?

[35:07] Right.

[35:08] That was probably like 2014.

[35:10] And then I want to wonder.

[35:11] Oh, yeah.

[35:12] So I think it was TpF like five years ago.

[35:15] I was talking, I was basically like just throwing out theme ideas.

[35:18] And I did mention my Bible adventures and Robert was like, oh, that's amazing.

[35:23] Because a lot of people like don't like it.

[35:26] Everyone either absolutely hates their things.

[35:28] It'd be great.

[35:29] But he was like, oh, that's a great idea.

[35:30] But then he changed it to fire in Brimstone, which is stupid.

[35:35] Why is that stupid?

[35:37] Because it makes you think of like hardcore Southern Baptist kind of religious people.

[35:42] Right.

[35:43] Like you're just talking about like the negative punishment aspects of religion.

[35:46] Like if you do not follow God, you will be killed by fire in Brimstone.

[35:49] I wanted to basically make like Cecil B. DeMille, Michael Bay, God of War.

[35:54] That's what I wanted it to be like, just the spectacle, right?

[35:57] Right.

[35:58] And I'm curious to see how badly they mess it up if it ever gets released.

[36:03] Well, and he's designing it too, right?

[36:04] He's not just like, what do you think about that?

[36:08] Like designed by Robert, like is he a pinball designer now?

[36:11] Or is it just something you put on a PowerPoint slide?

[36:13] Well, I mean, to his credit, he only, he doesn't have that much less experience than someone

[36:18] like me.

[36:19] You know, or, you know, because everyone has their own.

[36:22] But you have a history of working in gaming and understanding this stuff.

[36:28] Do you get that sense from him that his background?

[36:31] Don't you need to have some, I guess not.

[36:33] Well, I mean, he's Gen X or so.

[36:36] He probably played video games so long.

[36:38] I guess you're right.

[36:39] I mean, ultimately, it's like for him to prove he's a designer.

[36:43] He just needs to show us a good design, right?

[36:44] It's like no one knew who Eric Minier was until they saw pirates.

[36:47] And now everyone is like Eric's legitimate designer.

[36:50] Right.

[36:51] The thing with doing, you know, a Bible pin or whatever is, I don't know if he got that

[36:56] from me, but it's like, everything in the Bible is numbered.

[36:59] It's basically, there's just everything's numbered because the point of religion, see

[37:03] it, thing is I'm sure people wouldn't want to buy a religion pin for someone as agnostic

[37:08] as myself.

[37:09] But it's all about repetition and memorization.

[37:11] So, oh, there's 10 plagues, 10 commandments, 7 sins, you know, everything's numbered because

[37:17] it's kind of like you're chanting it, you're remembering it, you're drilling it into

[37:21] people's minds.

[37:23] But that actually makes it really good for pinball because, you know, even now, the people

[37:27] who are buying pinball, like the Gen Xers and young boomers, I mean, they were raised

[37:31] going to church, right?

[37:32] So, they're still familiar with these stories.

[37:33] They're part of our collective subconscious.

[37:37] So I think it would really work from a rules perspective, or like you have like, you know,

[37:41] you're on Noah's Ark, what was it?

[37:43] 40 days at sea, so you make that 40 seconds of multi-ball, try to keep the balls active,

[37:47] plug holes in the ship.

[37:48] I had all sorts of stuff for that figured out.

[37:51] So, can you imagine Ben if God asked John Papaduke to make the Ark?

[37:56] We would be done.

[37:57] Like, that we never would have been ready in time for the flood.

[38:00] See, that's something that is non-denominational.

[38:03] Like, there's actually most ancient religions talk about a flood.

[38:07] So something must have happened back then, but who knows what?

[38:09] Right.

[38:10] But then, how crazy was it that they just dropped all their titles out in the world with,

[38:16] like, who does that?

[38:17] That's never been done before.

[38:18] It's either a pitch check to try to get more investment or to see what people respond

[38:23] to.

[38:24] Okay, but let's look at the way this story unfolds now.

[38:27] If you're trying to get investors, and if they just do a simple Google search of Deeproot,

[38:32] now what's going to come up is this fiasco of a reveal.

[38:36] They're going to see that hopefully they read the threads of 250 pages of people slamming

[38:41] a company.

[38:42] Who did this?

[38:43] American Pimbald, isn't it?

[38:44] That's John, right?

[38:45] John's ability to sort of get new money, but at this point, I don't even know how you

[38:50] hide it.

[38:51] Speaking of American Pimbald, they'd be the perfect people to manufacture these games,

[38:55] but they're probably still too pissed at John.

[38:58] So...

[38:59] Well, that's the thing.

[39:00] You know, people have been suggesting that.

[39:01] So how can Deeproot though financially afford to then go higher a contract manufacturer

[39:05] after all this money has been pumped into R&D?

[39:08] Like how do you make money on any of these games?

[39:10] Well, we have no idea.

[39:12] I mean, it's been said how much people believe they have raised, but we have no idea of

[39:17] what their actual remaining assets are.

[39:20] Did he actually say they were burning 750K a month?

[39:23] At some point, he did say that.

[39:25] I mean, if that's true, they don't have any money left.

[39:28] Well, what's crazy to me is the Deeproot Studios in Utah.

[39:31] We don't talk about that.

[39:33] There was no Pimbalming made there.

[39:35] That was the studio, like the animation studio.

[39:38] And they had, I think, a floor too in this really expensive building, and they've shared

[39:42] images of what the office space was like, and it's very impressive.

[39:46] But what happened, like what happens to all the stuff they created there, all the animations,

[39:51] and we've seen some food truck animation, and the stuff looks pretty good at, from a

[39:55] Pimbal standard.

[39:56] It looks really good.

[39:57] But where's it all going to go?

[39:59] There's no home for this stuff.

[40:00] There's no games.

[40:01] Where are the games?

[40:02] It seems like it's all art, and no manufacturing.

[40:07] And art is great.

[40:09] Stern's invested in it, but they obviously haven't invested as much as Deeproot has, but

[40:13] they at least have a game to put it on.

[40:14] Stern really beefed up their art department in the last five years, or at least their

[40:18] animation department.

[40:19] Do you think Deeproot can turn this around?

[40:27] My external opinion, based off what we've seen and the delays, I'm guessing no.

[40:37] What would they need to turn it around?

[40:39] Well, they had their official statement, which obviously we can speak to, and it wasn't

[40:45] very different.

[40:46] Stevie Wonder could have read between the lines of that statement.

[40:48] It sounded like they're going back to the drawing board.

[40:55] The game that's been in development for nine years, how is that tenable?

[41:01] The thing is, I was going to bring this up earlier, but I think we got off topic.

[41:06] So many of these companies, they just refuse to iterate.

[41:08] They don't make five whitewoods.

[41:11] It's like they make a finished looking game, which is what John was notorious for doing,

[41:15] and then never changing it.

[41:17] Predator was like that.

[41:18] Predator was a piece of shit, and they took it to shows for years, and they never adjusted

[41:23] it or improved it.

[41:24] Why not?

[41:25] So many of these designs could just stuck in concrete, and they try to change everything

[41:30] also around the game.

[41:31] But if the game, basic game itself has geometric flaws, then you need to change it.

[41:36] I agree.

[41:37] I even think one of the reasons I sold my Rick and Morty, I think Rick and Morty was

[41:40] a game that could have benefited from a few design tweaks, because once you say this

[41:46] is it with the geometry, that's it.

[41:48] There are some difficult shots in that that could have been the user to make.

[41:51] I would agree.

[41:52] This game, they're going back to the drawing board.

[41:54] The media that went down there, and now became a focus group that gave them feedback to

[41:59] go back and fix some things.

[42:01] So let me ask you a question, because there's a virtual Pimball Expo coming up in October.

[42:06] Do you think they're going to show something then to try to get some confidence back in

[42:12] deep route?

[42:13] I mean, I guess it would be in their best interest, even though I expressed doubt as if they'll

[42:18] succeed.

[42:19] I would think you would basically crunch everyone for two months and have something that you

[42:24] could show for this virtual event.

[42:26] I mean, if it was my company, that's what I would do.

[42:28] I'm like, you're all sleeping under your desks until this is right.

[42:32] I would say if they don't have anything by then, then yeah, they're done.

[42:37] You know, it's hard, right?

[42:38] As Pimball fans, we want to see these companies succeed.

[42:40] We want to see these games come out.

[42:42] We want more options.

[42:43] We want innovation.

[42:45] But we really just want great games, right?

[42:47] I mean, it's not too hard.

[42:48] I mean, Scott Dinesi made a game in his basement for probably less than 50 grand.

[42:53] I don't know how much TNA was to make for him.

[42:55] That's what I kept thinking about reading all the deep route stuff.

[42:59] I kept imagining that scene from Iron Man where he's like, both a pair of fries.

[43:04] Keith L. went made this game in his basement with a box of scraps.

[43:08] Yeah.

[43:09] And that's what Pat Lawler did back in the 80s.

[43:13] Banzai Run was a garage game and he took it to Williams.

[43:16] Right.

[43:17] Right.

[43:18] That's what I did.

[43:20] That's what Keith Ellin did.

[43:21] It's not that hard to attach a bunch of screws to a piece of plywood.

[43:27] The hard part is the code and the manufacturing.

[43:30] And if they're having trouble even getting their prototype game in a playable state, that's

[43:35] troubling.

[43:36] And the thing is, and I said this on Pinside, so I guess it's perfect for me to say

[43:40] here, looking back with the information I have now over all the years of design and

[43:45] working with them.

[43:46] I do actually think John is basically a hack.

[43:50] Left to his own devices, he can't do much.

[43:53] And I think the problem that happens is investors can't tell the difference from your blinking

[43:56] box of lights in a working game.

[43:58] That's exactly how the American pinball people got fooled.

[44:02] They didn't know, they liked pinball, but they didn't know enough about it to realize

[44:04] that John's Houdini was a joke.

[44:09] And yeah.

[44:10] My favorite thing about Ben is when they released the Magic Girl, remember the letter

[44:15] that came with the release of that game, they said we built the game to John's specification.

[44:21] It was very legally worded.

[44:23] A-K-A, it don't work, people.

[44:27] Nothing works.

[44:28] How nobody in American pinball walked, they gave John like, I think $500,000 maybe, maybe

[44:33] $300,000 to spend an entire year in that back room and nobody walked back there and

[44:38] was like, okay, let me play it.

[44:40] Let's see what my 300 grand got me.

[44:42] Let me play it.

[44:43] Nothing works.

[44:45] I think there comes a point where you have to throw a tour theory out and say, hey, if

[44:49] you haven't shipped a game in 20 years or 25 years, you need to prove yourself again.

[44:54] Right.

[44:55] It's like a pilot.

[44:56] If you don't fly within three years, you lose your license.

[45:00] At some point, you have to prove something again and you can't rest on your laurels from

[45:04] back in the Clinton administration.

[45:06] Yeah.

[45:07] And the truth is, those who get it done, George Gomez knows who they are and George

[45:11] Gomez goes and gets them.

[45:13] And there's a few other people that can get it done and we know where they are and what

[45:16] companies those are.

[45:17] And I think all of us have a newfound respect for the companies that actually get it done.

[45:22] And so I do.

[45:23] I think this thing is going to be a distant memory.

[45:26] Once people start to see new games from the other companies.

[45:28] Now speaking of Ben, I do want to transition.

[45:31] What the hell is going on at Chicago gaming company?

[45:33] It's happening.

[45:35] I've been kind of out of that loop.

[45:38] Actually, I know that they're having, hopefully, the final meeting for licensing for my

[45:42] game this week, I believe.

[45:44] And then I'm waiting for them to finish up their next remake.

[45:47] And then that's when, apparently, I'll get the engineering team.

[45:50] So yeah, it's well, and of course, they were delayed by COVID, like everyone else.

[45:55] So yeah, it's just more waiting game.

[45:58] But it's actually, it sounds like it's almost ready to happen.

[46:00] Okay.

[46:01] Are you next in line after the next remake?

[46:04] Are you, is there another game and then you?

[46:07] You know, actually, that part, I think there actually might be another game before mine

[46:11] gets released.

[46:12] So it's another remake and I don't know what it is, by the way.

[46:15] And then I think they have a their first, I don't know, well, yes, original title.

[46:20] That's the license.

[46:21] Well, I don't, I think it's a license game, but it's basically, it's their first non-remake

[46:24] title.

[46:25] Right.

[46:26] And we all, we know all this.

[46:27] So it's Cactus Canyon, then they're original, then you might be up on the docket.

[46:30] Now do you want these guys to move a little bit faster?

[46:32] Because I mean, it is, it's like taken forever to get these games up.

[46:35] Yeah.

[46:36] Well, I have been waiting for like over a year.

[46:38] And so I think what this play field has now been an ice for three years.

[46:43] I don't, I've been kind of, I've been kind of busy lately.

[46:46] I mean, actually, I had no shortage of work during all this.

[46:50] So it's not like I don't have other things to do, but it would be nice to get back into

[46:54] Pimball, get back into more creative work.

[46:56] Right.

[46:57] So the game that you're making for them, have you, you already designed this game and, and

[47:01] you're going to re-theme it to the new theme or is it what's going on?

[47:05] Like what, what's your process with this thing?

[47:07] Yes, that is correct.

[47:08] It was designed back, when did I start on that?

[47:12] I started in November of 2016 and then I, I did a lot of play field iteration on that.

[47:19] Like I have my, my rotisserie thing that I built.

[47:22] I don't know if you've ever seen it, but what it has, it's, it's a rotisserie, but you

[47:27] can shoot.

[47:28] It's at 6.5 degrees and it's all wired up and it has all these quick change plugs and

[47:33] it has an Italian bottom, right?

[47:35] So that was my rapid development system for my next game.

[47:39] So basically it was, instead of having to cut any whitewood, you would make it out of foam

[47:43] and the foam would be like cartridges that you could swap in and out and then I just

[47:46] threw all the old ones in the dumpster.

[47:47] I think someone took some of them.

[47:49] So, yeah.

[47:50] Well, you designed this game during your time at Spooky, right?

[47:53] So Chuck sort of had the rights to your whitewood.

[47:55] Now you guys are working together again in collaboration with Chicago Gaming Company, correct?

[47:59] It's sort of like a, yeah.

[48:00] Okay.

[48:01] And I'm also helping on Spooky's next game.

[48:03] Does it feel good to be back with Chuck and Co?

[48:05] It's a lot different there.

[48:06] I mean, for one thing, it's weird because it used to be like, what?

[48:10] I don't even know if it was a thousand square foot office and a business incubator.

[48:15] And then they got the unit next door.

[48:16] So it was like 2000 whopping square feet.

[48:18] No, it's probably more like 1500 total, right?

[48:20] Like two 750 units.

[48:23] And that's where they made the entire run of AMH, right?

[48:25] Then they got the bigger factory and now they have a bigger factory.

[48:29] So they're on the third space and as we talked about, it's like 95%.

[48:34] Well, let's see, there's an office where they did the game development and the podcast.

[48:37] It's a factory, which is what it should be.

[48:39] It's a pretty good room.

[48:40] And the rest of it is all production.

[48:41] Right.

[48:42] That's what it should look like.

[48:44] You should not walk into a pinball company and it feels like you're walking into an accounting firm.

[48:49] You know what I'm saying?

[48:50] Like it should look like a factory.

[48:51] On the hard studio.

[48:53] Yeah.

[48:54] So their weekend moody's are trickling out.

[48:55] Do you think Spooky needs to make games faster?

[48:59] I mean, I know you're connected with them.

[49:01] Like, what do you think?

[49:02] Do they want to wait this long or do they need to speed it up?

[49:05] I think the issue they have with that is, well, Charlie does concentrate entirely on production,

[49:11] which is good, right?

[49:12] So he's like, you know, based on the size of the staff and the factory, I need to build

[49:16] like 700 games a year or whatever it is, right?

[49:20] And I think what happens is, you know, they probably don't spend enough time on development

[49:25] or the kind of stuff that Robert's doing too much of, Spooky needs to do more of, which

[49:29] again, if Robert teamed up with like an American pinball, it would be a really cool combination.

[49:34] It's just maybe they don't want a team up or they don't want to work together.

[49:37] Yeah.

[49:38] So I know like basically what happens with Spooky is, you know, yeah, I think they need

[49:44] they need more development time for stuff because, you know, but again, you know, the factory

[49:50] is like a beast that needs to be fed and they make sure that it's always fed.

[49:55] Yeah.

[49:56] If it's going to take a year and a half to make all the Rick and Morty, isn't that your

[49:59] development time for the next game right there?

[50:02] And it is.

[50:03] And once again, COVID gave them a boost or gave them some more time.

[50:08] Right.

[50:09] Yeah.

[50:09] So I mean, I guess we'll see actually I'm going down there in a couple of weeks.

[50:12] We have a new system in it now.

[50:15] We have Parker and I are back for revenge.

[50:19] So we have a really, really cheap driver system for the, for the new game.

[50:23] So yeah, it should be cool.

[50:25] And then I can get my royalties off that and well, we're excited to see what you have

[50:30] in the works.

[50:31] Ben, Ben, I want to thank you.

[50:32] Anything else you want to discuss?

[50:34] I just, this has been great.

[50:35] I really, well, hopefully we were vague enough with all this.

[50:40] Well, no, I mean, I'm just going by what I've seen online and what I remember from John

[50:44] back in the day, but honestly, John seems like the kind of person who's just skating

[50:47] by till he turns 64 and can take early social security.

[50:51] Right.

[50:52] Look, here's the thing.

[50:53] You know, it should not, we should not feel nervous about discussing,

[50:57] pinball, discussing these companies.

[50:59] And we shouldn't, I feel this sense with like deep rude in the conversation is like,

[51:04] there's a lot of nervousness.

[51:05] There's, I mean, people went there can't talk people in there.

[51:08] Steve Bowden, like what's going on?

[51:11] Like John Nora is burial.

[51:12] Like no one's saying anything.

[51:13] And I, it's going to get to the point where you can't keep everybody quiet.

[51:18] There's going to be ex employees that talk.

[51:20] This thing, the story's going to come out sooner or later.

[51:24] And I for one think that, you know, I don't want to keep talking about deep

[51:28] rude. I said on my last show, I'm kind of moving on to Guns and Roses,

[51:31] but I did want to get you on it because I know you had history with John.

[51:35] And I did want to hear what your thoughts were on this thing because you're

[51:38] connected to this thing.

[51:39] Like it or not, you know, I would say, yeah, I mean, it really bothers me that

[51:43] Raza started off as Ben Hexambi eventually because that ties my name to an incomplete

[51:49] project. And if there's one thing I always do, I always complete every project I

[51:53] start. There you go for better or worse.

[51:55] And that's one of the things I try to be good at despite all the other flaws.

[51:59] So it does bother me that I was attached to that at a certain point.

[52:02] I don't want people to work. Oh, yeah, actually, there's one more thing I want to

[52:05] bring up. Yeah.

[52:06] Like people are like, Oh, Ben, if you knew John wasn't going to finish things,

[52:09] why didn't you say so?

[52:11] First of all, back in those days, you were not allowed to criticize any

[52:15] pinball companies.

[52:15] You remember that?

[52:16] Like you couldn't say anything about anybody negative or you got dog piled, right?

[52:21] So you couldn't say predators, a piece of shit.

[52:23] And everyone'd be like, no, it's great.

[52:25] It's like, right.

[52:26] So even though I hadn't really figured out what John was all about yet, you know,

[52:31] if I would have told everyone, if I would have, you know, Ben, a whistleblower and said,

[52:34] Hey, Zidware is never going to deliver a game.

[52:37] I didn't know that at the time.

[52:38] But if I would have said that, I would have been crucified.

[52:40] She's like, who is this fucking ginger drunk telling us that the great John

[52:44] Papa do isn't going to deliver, right?

[52:46] Yeah.

[52:46] You know, it's crazy back then.

[52:47] Kevin Coolick, Andrew Highway, John Papa Duke.

[52:50] I mean, they were unanimously supported and anyone you spoke down was completely

[52:56] downvoted and shunned.

[52:58] And that's the thing people, people have incredibly short memories.

[53:00] I don't.

[53:01] And that's exactly what happened.

[53:02] And that's why a lot of this was allowed to happen was because criticism was not

[53:07] allowed.

[53:07] And criticism should also be allowed.

[53:09] Like, you know, people praise spooky for what they did, but they also get a lot

[53:13] of criticism and, you know, you brought it up.

[53:15] If it's got better, you're right.

[53:17] And that thing is you do not improve something by just listening to the kiss

[53:22] ass. Yes, men, you know, you improve things by knowing what's wrong.

[53:26] Instead of what's right.

[53:27] Because if people just blow sunshine up your ass all day, then you end up with

[53:31] Theranos, right?

[53:32] Or something like that.

[53:34] And yeah.

[53:35] So I think that's something people need to realize.

[53:37] And I guess my other thing is, yeah.

[53:39] So back then, you know, you go into John shop and he started out with like, I

[53:44] don't know, 1500 square foot shop, had all these Pimma machines, all these work

[53:48] benches.

[53:49] I mean, it looked legit, right?

[53:52] And then he doubled the size of it.

[53:54] And this is back.

[53:54] So he was like probably six times the size of spooky in space, but he wasn't

[53:59] even building anything.

[54:01] And, you know, you go in there and everything looks legit, right?

[54:04] It's kind of like, you know, if you ever been to the Houston space center down in

[54:07] Texas, right?

[54:09] I haven't, but I'll Google it.

[54:11] You go, they have the sat, they have like one of the remaining Saturn five rockets

[54:15] there.

[54:15] And you look at this effing thing and you're like, why would they build this?

[54:19] If the moon landing was fake, right?

[54:21] It's just so gargantuan.

[54:23] And it was kind of the same thing as like this looks legit.

[54:26] But looking back now, I think John was basically just trying to get bought out

[54:30] or get stormed to hire him.

[54:32] Right.

[54:32] It was, you, I think he was making a gambit that someone would buy him out or hire

[54:38] him before he actually had to produce the games and the gambit was unsuccessful.

[54:43] Yeah.

[54:44] And it's sad too.

[54:45] Cause like a hundred thousand dollars in parts and money went, you know, from

[54:49] coin taker, all those LEDs they gave him and all the parts they gave him.

[54:54] I always talked to Chris.

[54:55] He's like, all John had to do was just send us the stuff back and he never did.

[54:59] And it's, so at some point we really have all it did sit there and bins.

[55:03] It's not like, well, John's also pretty lazy.

[55:07] So that's probably why he never sent it back.

[55:09] But at some point, at some point, you know, this community needs to stop backing

[55:14] people that don't deliver that are charlatans and somewhat, I would say even like

[55:18] crux when they don't, when they take people's money and they give them

[55:21] nothing in return.

[55:22] I mean, that's you're robbing someone.

[55:24] Most of them have been expunged.

[55:26] I mean, do you remember that fat short story about the young woman who like

[55:32] borrows a necklace?

[55:34] Ah, no, do you want me to do want me to tell you the story or do you have it for us

[55:39] right now?

[55:39] So this is, I'll just tell you this really quick story.

[55:42] So I guess this is young woman and she's going to go to a ball with this man she

[55:45] just met and she knows this rich woman, the rich woman's like, oh, you're,

[55:49] you're so pretty here.

[55:50] Take this necklace to the ball, right?

[55:51] So, you know, you can have a nice night out with your, your new man.

[55:54] So the young, young woman takes this beautiful necklace and she has a wonderful

[55:57] time. But then it turns out during the course of the night she loses the necklace and she's

[56:02] like, oh, no, how can I replace that necklace?

[56:04] Right?

[56:05] And so she scrapes together and she loans all this money and borrows all this money

[56:09] from like all the loan sharks.

[56:11] You know, this is like a medieval kind of tale.

[56:12] And then she buys a replacement necklace so she can give it back to the old lady that

[56:16] loaned it to her and she would never know that it, you know, it was lost.

[56:21] And then like, I think that the twist is like 30 years later, the old lady sees this

[56:26] young woman, but now the young woman's all like her fingernails are worn off and she's

[56:29] all threadbare and ragged because she's just spent her whole life slaving away trying to

[56:34] pay back the debt of buying the necklace.

[56:35] And then the old lady is like, oh, dear, I forgot to tell you that necklace.

[56:39] It was a fake.

[56:41] Yeah.

[56:41] You know, that's like the twist of the story.

[56:43] But that's kind of seems to what the deep roots doing.

[56:45] Like he's sitting there atoning for his sins, like, slaving away building games one at a time.

[56:51] But at least it's happening, right?

[56:53] Right.

[56:54] So the reason they bring that up.

[56:55] Okay.

[56:55] So he's, you know, like atoning for the mistakes.

[56:58] Then you have Andrew highway, Kevin or Skitbee.

[57:02] It seems like a lot of the charlatans have been expunged and John who, you know, as I say,

[57:09] am I opinion I believe also is of that ilk.

[57:13] He's like the last hanger on, but he's the he's the worst because I'll tell you why.

[57:17] At least Andrew highway built two games.

[57:19] At least Kevin Cluik had a predator and people owned like he would have been.

[57:23] They'd have played them if they didn't whistle below the licensing deal.

[57:26] John hasn't made you would he would have run on the money before he completed all the predators.

[57:30] Right.

[57:30] But yeah, he would have made like 30 or 40 at least.

[57:33] At least they made a game that works.

[57:36] And Andrew did ship hundreds of games.

[57:38] I mean, indeed.

[57:39] So in all of these, with all of these characters, right, the one who's been the most inefficient has been John.

[57:47] So that's why it's sort of crazy that they built an entire new company around a man.

[57:53] I mean, there's a reason that, you know, there's basically what no remaining unemployed pinball people like all these guys have been hired by somewhere.

[58:02] And well, I guess John's been hired as well, but would anyone with anyone with any other company hired John never, never, never.

[58:11] Pinball is booming right now.

[58:12] If you can get it done and you have a good idea, there's a lot of people that want to buy machines right now, especially with COVID.

[58:20] So Ben, thank you so much for coming on.

[58:23] We look forward to seeing your game.

[58:25] We're happy to see you back with spooky and collaborating with CDC and just happy to tell the story about what it's been like, you know, through your years with the retro time,

[58:34] Exombie Adventure Land that just can never see the light of day.

[58:37] So thank you for your time, brother.

[58:39] No problem.

[58:40] All right.

[58:41] Have a good Sunday.

[58:42] We'll talk to you soon.
