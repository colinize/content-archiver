[00:00] What's up everybody, happy Friday, welcome to Canadian SpinBop Podcast, the

[00:29] only pinball podcaster to win 6 Twippies in a row, then be ineligible and then lose to

[00:37] my new best friend in pinball, Kale over at the electric bat baby, the electric bat is

[00:44] back, we gotta bring one of those to the east coast, we rap every day and make fun of the

[00:50] rest of what's going on in this crazy hobby, we love what is going on in pinball, you can

[00:56] head over to Costco, you can go get a $4700 Star Wars pinball machine or you can probably

[01:03] go get the other Star Wars machine that's fully featured, right, how much is a Steve

[01:08] Richie Pro version of Star Wars, I mean it's gotta be around that price, I would have to

[01:13] imagine, or you could go buy a game with half as much in it, we're gonna go around the pinball

[01:19] horn on this Friday, here's the topics I wanna talk about today, I wanna talk about Spooky's

[01:25] Next Game, how are they gonna handle the launch of this thing that is gonna sell out instantly,

[01:32] are they gonna do something a little bit different, are they gonna give Canada 887 of them to

[01:38] flip for a profit and then split the profits with them, why not just make me the only distributor

[01:47] and then I'll have no problem whatsoever selling it for over MSRP because you know when it

[01:54] comes to scalping games, nobody scalps better than Canada, I used to be great back in the

[02:00] day, I'd swoop in, get a couple of each title that was hot, make a couple grand and call

[02:06] it a day, that was when it wasn't greed, was it, we only asked for like 2000 over back

[02:12] in the day and I'm talking about games like Ghostbusters LE, Batman LE, you know you'd

[02:18] buy it for like 8000 and you sell it for 10 and then COVID hit and these idiots were

[02:24] buying games for 8 and then listing them for 19, the moment a pirate to the Caribbean CE

[02:32] in a box sold for $40,000 was the dumb moment everybody witnessed and was like oh yeah I

[02:38] guess all my games are now worth this and the reality is no they're not, no they're not,

[02:44] everything has slid back down, way back down, can't even sell a King Kong, a brand new King Kong

[02:51] LE new in a box is having a hard time sell for $11,000, I mean literally $2,000 off the latest

[02:58] Keith Elwyn game and it's not going to move quickly and for those of you who paid $13,

[03:03] I don't know what to tell you, here's five bucks, go sign up for Canada's Pinball Podcast

[03:07] and he would have saved you $2,000 and these guys are the ones who are hemming and hawing

[03:12] about donating some money to Canada's Pinball Podcast baby, are you guys signing up for Naps

[03:17] Arcade, I need to know how the forum is, I'm joining it today, I'm gonna sign up, I'm gonna give Jason

[03:24] what he deserves a few bucks and we all should do the same thing, do you think we're gonna get

[03:29] 600 and what we're at, 661 now, we're sliding down to 600, you know I know there's not a ton

[03:35] of Pinball news but that doesn't mean Pinball podcasting can't be fun, there's always topics

[03:40] to talk about, so how is Spooky Pinball gonna handle Beetlejuice, we know it's either Beetlejuice

[03:46] or Gremlins, I think between those two titles more people want Beetlejuice but I think both

[03:52] titles are gonna be day one instant sellouts and after watching Evil Dead and here's the thing

[03:59] and I think we don't give enough credit when we talk about the best designers, the best games,

[04:05] the most loaded pins, the best bang for the buck in all of Pinball right now is Evil Dead,

[04:14] it has the most in it, it has all the assets you want if you love Evil Dead, Caviar, Scooby-Doo

[04:21] Voice, no it's not gonna happen, I'm not gonna, Canada what's wrong with you, what's in your

[04:30] coffee today bro, so look Evil Dead has so many great toys, it has all the assets, it has the best

[04:38] art out of all the new art packages, it has the best topper and you can get that beautiful

[04:44] butter cabinet, if you've never stood in front of a butter cabinet it is nicer than any decal that's

[04:50] ever been on any pin ever, so they're giving you the best bang for the buck and on a theme that is

[04:56] arguably very niche and subculture, it's sold out and now they're going for well over sticker

[05:03] and that's Evil Dead and if they hit with Beetlejuice, with Franchi and Buggin Luke and they only make

[05:12] 888 they're gonna sell out in seconds and I know distributors are taking an interested list, I love

[05:20] these distros man, I saw a thread that was like what do you want to see from your distro and it's

[05:25] like I love when people say stuff like I just want a fair price, come on, distros can't give you a

[05:31] fair price, they can only sell you what the game is MSRP or more, they're not allowed to sell you

[05:38] the game at the actual market value of a game, distros sitting on King Kong LEs right now can't

[05:45] give it to you at a fair price, they can't shave a thousand dollars off, I mean they will if you

[05:51] walk in with cash they just can't advertise it so I think Spooky Pinball has an interesting moment

[05:58] here because it's gonna happen in November, December and when it hits it's just gonna be a

[06:05] feeding frenzy, I love where they are at, I mean think about it out of all the pinball companies

[06:11] this company only needs to make one good game a year to keep it all going and they've secured

[06:20] four to five really great licenses so that means for the next four to five years

[06:27] Bug and Luke are sleeping like little babies and I don't mean like baby babies, I mean they're sleeping

[06:33] like a baby, they're out cold, not because they're drinking with Ben Heck, they're out cold because

[06:39] they have peace of mind, I'm sure there's some things that are stressful but for the most part

[06:45] this company has hit its stride and I would love to be a fly on the wall when they announce

[06:52] Beetlejuice so should they do something different right, should they create some sort of lottery to

[06:57] get one, how do you make it fair because you know that 8088 are going to be spoken for right away,

[07:04] you know, Canadian is going to get one, they're going to hook me up with one, that's how it works

[07:09] people, when you do 1100 podcasts about pinball and you wear a t-shirt that says spooky shill on it

[07:18] you get to cut the line and if you think that's unfair go make 1100 pinball podcasts and walk

[07:25] into the electric bat arcade get wasted and you'll get one too all right so I think they're going to

[07:32] probably just do business as usual and why not right, why not, you don't need to like

[07:37] mess up a system that works, if you're not on a list for this game trust me get on the list,

[07:42] just get on the list, I've been telling people to get on the list before but this time I really

[07:47] mean it, I thought you had to get on the list for Harry Potter but now nobody needed to be on a list

[07:53] because they're making unlimited but for this game trust me get on a list, now let me just speculate

[07:59] what I think is going to happen, I think an instant sell out of Beetlejuice, I think the game with all

[08:05] of its butter and accessories and toppers will be somewhere around $13,000 to your door, now from

[08:12] there this is where I think it's going to get crazy, if it is Beetlejuice and it's the original

[08:19] Tim Burton one right, maybe it's both movies and you can select that would also be cool, nobody

[08:24] would complain about that, get ready people for an absolute bonkers immediate second hand flip price,

[08:32] I mean it, I think they're going to flip around 18 instantly, instantly and I mean that, there's

[08:39] only going to be 888 Beetlejuices, now I don't know that for sure, so what if they knock the number up,

[08:48] now I know they don't want to go anywhere near like Scooby-Doo where it was like what like

[08:53] 1,969 games or something silly like that and I know they want to get to the next game and they don't

[08:59] want to make two games on the same sort of layout ever again, I still think it's going to be 888

[09:05] and I think Spooky is very happy making the amount of money they're going to make and I think they

[09:11] want to pass the value on to their customers, what a novel idea, that's what Stern used to do with all

[09:19] of its L.E.s, that's over and Spooky Pimball really when you think about it right now, the only

[09:26] company, the only company with FOMO still going is Spooky, you don't have it over at Barrels of

[09:33] Fun, they didn't sell out of Dune, they don't have any sellouts of King Kong L.E.s going on,

[09:38] there's no sellouts of Harry Potter anywhere, there's no sellouts of anything else anywhere,

[09:43] it's not hard to get anything, I was just looking up Pulp Fiction L.E., I was curious, I'm like is

[09:48] Pulp Fiction L.E. holding value 8,300 bucks for the L.E., that was like 9,500, 9,700 dollars, remember

[09:57] when people were paying well over for that game when it was announced 8,300 and guess what, it's

[10:03] not sold, it's just sitting there, so this is going to be a crazy November, December, now stuff's

[10:10] going to happen before then, Stern Star Wars is going to be so interesting, are they going to nail

[10:19] it? I think Stern needs to give everybody a new moment of wow and we all feel this way, right,

[10:26] it's like King Kong was not it, D&D was not it, Jaws was the last one I think that really hit and

[10:35] made people happy, but when you think about it, man Jaws didn't even have a shark that ate the ball

[10:42] and I get that they said they were trying to make it work, but in the end that is sort of pathetic,

[10:49] right, it's like you make a game based on a big shark that eats stuff and he doesn't even eat the

[10:55] ball, okay, so when we get episode 4 through 6 and I hope it is that, what do you want in this game?

[11:03] I'll tell you the one thing we better see, I want to see an at-at walker and I want to see the ball

[11:10] go around its legs in an orbit, right, you like quick around like the way the harpoon goes around

[11:16] its legs and that at-at walker better fall down, if they don't have that in a Star Wars game, what

[11:23] are we doing here? Are there no engineers that have any creativity? The other thing they need in

[11:30] Star Wars is simply this, you have to make it, when you blow up the Death Star, the entire games

[11:39] lights should turn off, you should only get one shot and you gotta use the force, I mean that is

[11:46] how it should go, make it a moment and when you blow up the Death Star, think about the Steve

[11:52] Ritchie game, nothing really interesting happens when you blow up the Death Star, it should feel

[11:58] like when you destroy the ring in Lord of the Rings, the entire game should go crazy and you

[12:04] should have some amazing stuff happening anyway, so what if it's not Star Wars, like what if it's

[12:10] something crazy like Fallout, remember when that was a rumor we were gonna get Stern Fallout and then

[12:16] Stern's been picking some really bad themes so it's not lost on me that maybe Jody thinks Fallout

[12:23] was gonna be big and inked a deal, I don't think it's gonna be that, I think it's gonna be Star Wars

[12:29] and then it's gonna be Pokemon, a lot of people are asking me what's Jack Danger's game, did Jack

[12:34] start on Pokemon and Keith Elwyn is gonna finish it, there's no way that's happening people, if

[12:40] anyone's gonna finish a Jack Danger pin, it's gonna be Gomez, like Gomez is the one who will come in

[12:46] and finish a game, he's done it before, he did it with what, like James Bond, he's done it other

[12:52] times, there's no way that Keith Elwyn ever starts out fixing someone else's game or finishing

[12:59] someone else's game, I shouldn't say fixing because Jack's a great designer but no way, absolutely no

[13:05] way, so look Keith Elwyn, Pokemon, I'm worried though, I am worried that Pokemon is not this

[13:13] demo at all, at all, I mean all of us, even if we weren't Potter fanatics, we saw the movies,

[13:21] but people in this community are not into Pokemon, it is just not gonna move like people think,

[13:28] the love affair for Star Wars is a thousand times bigger in this demo than Pokemon and so if Stern

[13:37] is banking on Pokemon being this huge pinball game that's gonna sell so much, I'm gonna say this

[13:43] right now, Donkey Kong would be better than Pokemon for this demographic, Super Mario Brothers would

[13:52] be better, Sonic the Hedgehog would be better for this demographic, these things are not cheap and

[13:59] there are not people in their 30s plopping down 10 to 15 thousand dollars on pinball machines people,

[14:07] it's just not happening, alright, so you know what else is going on in pinball, that's funny right

[14:12] now, is like accessories to accessories are shipping before the accessories even before the game arrives,

[14:22] are you confused, let me explain, so you can order today accessories to your Alice's Adventures in

[14:31] Wonderland topper and you don't even have the game and the game is not even shipping with the topper,

[14:39] did you follow that, so the game isn't even with you, if you do get your game it has no topper,

[14:47] but you can order an accessory to the topper, what I would like is an update on where Barry is at

[14:55] finding a new vendor to make those toppers because that doesn't seem like the easiest thing to just

[15:01] remake, pretty intricate mold going on there, so we shall see what happens there, I also saw people

[15:09] are getting invoiced for their Cliffys on medieval madness remake, so the metal protector for the scoop,

[15:17] Cliffy is going to send you your product, the only problem is the game is not even shipping,

[15:23] you don't even know where your Merlin's edition of medieval madness is and I also just think

[15:29] after covering this hobby for 12 years, I'm still perplexed why Cliffy is still in business and what

[15:36] I mean by that is how come nobody's just bought him and made his products part of the expensive

[15:43] thing we're buying, shouldn't all of these scoop protectors be installed before any game leaves

[15:50] a factory, I mean even Harry Potter recently, the first builds didn't have the scoop protectors and

[15:57] then later builds did, but how did they even forget that, like I really don't understand how that's

[16:05] even happening, so for a lot of you out there, you know you've had your money tied up with certain

[16:10] things and you're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting, now I think what's going to happen

[16:17] in pinball over the next couple of years is we are going to see a consolidation in the amount of

[16:23] companies that survive all of this, can Turner pinball survive, I don't know, will barrels of fun

[16:31] make it to future titles, I think so, I do think so and I'm excited about what they have in the roster,

[16:38] I'm hearing feedback on Dune lately is that people want to see when you're playing the game

[16:44] that there's more audio and video and call outs that are sort of like energetic when you

[16:50] accomplish something in the game, that right now it's a little monochromatic, now I heard that

[16:56] they're working on that and that should be coming in future code updates of the game, again you know

[17:02] how I feel about all this game, by the time this game is code complete, it will be $2,000 less than

[17:10] it was brand new and it will be about a year away from when the game was revealed, you know I just

[17:17] don't like that, I feel like the video game industry went in that direction, games launching early

[17:23] because the company's needed to make payroll and then you're beta testing the thing for an entire year,

[17:29] I'm tired of that, I'm glad to see that Spooky Pinball is hiring another programmer, that's good news,

[17:37] the more these games can be code complete on release date, the better, you're not going to get two,

[17:44] three, four chances to make a first impression and when you launch too early, you might be dead on

[17:51] arrival, like you got to get the game out, you got to put the games in boxes, like even if you don't

[17:57] have Arnold, Pinball Brothers should have had 50 games ready to go on day one, you know like what's

[18:04] this reveal, take deposits, wait a few months, it feels like a lot of these companies, the cash flow

[18:11] has to be an issue and that's a dangerous place to be because for a lot of these companies, they're

[18:18] backed by the Abbess family, they don't have the stern dollars, they don't have cheap overhead like

[18:24] Spooky and I think that's going to cause a lot of these companies to just fade away because I think

[18:31] at these prices people, what are you buying, you're only going to buy great games, everything else

[18:37] you're just going to let come and go, I mean it is crazy to me that King Kong is kind of you know

[18:43] just doing mediocre, it's King Kong, it's Keith Owens and it's kind of like eh, you know nobody's

[18:49] really dying to get their hands on one, that's insane to me, King Kong is going to go down as a

[18:55] mediocre seller, now whether or not it's great or not, you know we'll just let Retro Ralph tell you

[19:00] the game's amazing, you know like Avatar is amazing, people just don't understand, he's going to tell

[19:05] you that because he's having fun and I love that Retro Ralph is positive by the way, I saw him go on

[19:11] the pin side and defend his honor against these cargo short wearing trolls, it's like Ralph you

[19:19] don't need to do it, what you need to do is reach across the aisle and grab a whiskey with Kale and

[19:26] Kaneda, like we're still having fun, you think I would go on the pin side and try and defend myself,

[19:33] you know why I don't even need to, because nobody calls me a shill ever, you know I used to be called

[19:40] toxic and all this and that, I'm not that, I just call it like I see it and in the end, in the end

[19:47] who cares what they think, you got 73,000 subscribers, now they're not pinball subscribers, it was more

[19:55] of the arcade community, but man just chill out Ralph, we're going to get you back, we're never

[20:00] going to get Don back into the Kaneda club, but we're going to get you back brother, all right

[20:04] because people are going to be like oh man Kaneda said nice stuff about you, now you got to go listen,

[20:08] I love these guys, there's a very small circle of content creators that are having a good time

[20:15] and we're all doing it differently and that's good, right, it's good that we have a variety out there,

[20:21] now that being said there's so much pinball content now, I don't even pay attention to like 90% of it,

[20:29] I love listening to a few things, a few people, but the rest man it's like I don't know man,

[20:34] but whatever, you know no one's forced to listen to any of this stuff, all right so what else is

[20:39] going on in pinball, anything like we're at August 1st baby, is August going to see any

[20:45] action in pinball, I don't really think so, I think August is going to be a very dead month,

[20:50] it's going to mostly be about code updates, it's going to be at the end of this month,

[20:55] we start to hear more about Star Wars, it's going to come either end of August, early September

[21:03] and that's good because I recommend to each and every one of you, let's act a little bit like

[21:08] Europeans this August, they take the entire month off basically, let's go outside, let's be out there,

[21:16] connect with the people man, the real positive vibes on pinball are happening at the personal level,

[21:23] on my Patreon chat, that's where it's happening, getting together at arcades, that's where it's

[21:29] happening, going over your friends' homes and playing games, that's where it's happening,

[21:34] you know maybe going on the pin side, speaking of going on the pin side,

[21:38] pin pilot has not resurfaced, we can't find him, he has not come back to apologize for trying to

[21:46] throw CPR under the bus, I hope he returns in four years and eight months, but it's the summertime,

[21:55] get out there, pinball is a winter sport, I'm going to come up with entertaining shows every

[22:00] week, you don't have to worry about this, you're going to have fun, I hope you're enjoying the

[22:05] show, I'm enjoying making the show, everybody get ready, just save your pennies, I mean it,

[22:11] save your pennies because you're absolutely going to want the next spooky game, I know you're going

[22:16] to want the next Jersey Jack game and Stern man, isn't it fun, Stern's on the ropes baby,

[22:23] they had everything, they could have acquired all of their competitors, they could have acquired

[22:29] every theme and now they're on the ropes, I love it, they've got this ginormous company

[22:36] and they made so many boneheaded marketing mistakes and now they need a hit, it's getting

[22:42] serious and I know for a fact, Stern was trying to find a buyer people, if you think that that was

[22:49] not the case, yes it was the case, there were very real conversations trying to find a buyer for

[22:57] Stern Pinball, you know who couldn't afford it, Canada, because most of you are only giving me

[23:02] five dollars a month, this is like Canada's lower class podcast, everybody peace out, we'll talk to

[23:07] you soon
