[00:00] we have rage, without losing our mind

[00:04] We can't let it come out

[00:15] Roblox

[00:25] Alright kids, welcome to episode 411.

[00:35] By the time you're hearing this, Pimbal Expo will have come and gone.

[00:40] And I will not have been able to see what the news is at the show, but what I will give

[00:45] you is an interview I did with Mr. Christopher Franchi, a man who needs no introduction.

[00:52] This is a great talk, I think you're really going to enjoy it.

[00:55] I think Chris sort of lets us behind the curtain in what it's like working in the Pimbal industry.

[01:02] And you know me, I love Mr. Franchi's artwork.

[01:04] I think it's perfectly suited for Pimbal, but I also love these kind of just an outspoken

[01:09] personality that doesn't hold back.

[01:12] And I think you're going to enjoy what he says on his podcast.

[01:15] So without further ado, let's just air Mr. Christopher Franchi, episode 411 of Canada's

[01:21] Pimbal Podcast.

[01:22] Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canada's Pimbal Podcast.

[01:28] I guess I've been super excited to talk to and reconcile with and hear what's going

[01:33] on in his Pimbal world.

[01:35] Welcome back to Canada's Pimbal Podcast, Mr. Christopher Franchi.

[01:39] Chris, welcome back to the show.

[01:41] Thanks sir, how are you?

[01:42] I'm good, I'm good.

[01:44] You know, I want to ask the same question of you.

[01:47] Let's get something, I know we want to get something just cleared out of the way initially.

[01:51] Do you want to take the lead on that?

[01:54] Yeah, yeah.

[01:56] Yeah, because people are probably wondering, it's like, why are these two talking, considering

[02:01] the past that they've had.

[02:03] And of course, everybody knows about the monster's image leak.

[02:07] And just so everybody knows, we had discussed that after that happened.

[02:15] You had, you know, expressed your remorse on what you had done.

[02:19] And I in my up my quest for being a better person, realize that, you know, forgiveness

[02:28] is divine.

[02:30] People make mistakes or knows I've made them myself.

[02:34] For example, I sent them to you.

[02:36] So there's my mistake.

[02:39] So you know, it's what's water under the bridge at this point.

[02:42] And I think, you know, I was fine with the discussion we had about it.

[02:47] And so by God's, be by God.

[02:50] Yeah, and I was wrong.

[02:51] I mean, I never should have shared those with people.

[02:54] And everyone gets excited, right?

[02:57] In this hobby and you share stuff and you get excited.

[03:00] But I was totally in the wrong on that.

[03:03] So I'm glad we were able to sort of bury that hatchet.

[03:08] So Chris, you've been, you had an interesting year in Pimble, right?

[03:12] And trying to think about where we start this, I kind of, I feel like, tell us the news

[03:17] because I know you recently came out publicly and said that your next Pimble venture won't

[03:22] be with Stern Pimble.

[03:23] Is that, is that correct?

[03:26] That yeah, that is correct.

[03:27] I've moved on from Stern.

[03:30] And unfortunately, I don't know that I can say just yet where I'm, where I have moved

[03:38] to.

[03:39] And it doesn't necessarily mean that I am locked down to where I'm going.

[03:45] This is just one place that I'm going.

[03:47] I hope to be at several places.

[03:50] Stern had an issue with, you know, their artists working for other companies.

[03:55] So if you work for Stern, you didn't work for anybody else.

[03:58] And if you work for someone else, then you didn't work for Stern.

[04:01] And that's understandable.

[04:03] Now, like, what do you think about that?

[04:05] As an artist, knowing that this is a community that there's not so many players, is that,

[04:11] did you find that to be difficult?

[04:14] Well, I found it to be difficult when I sat on my hands for a year with no work.

[04:20] And this is after you complete it, Monsters.

[04:23] And that's when that period began, right?

[04:25] Yeah, the, Monsters was more or less in the can by late November.

[04:33] And other than a few odds and it's, I think, I had tinkered with the toper after that.

[04:40] But the basic game part was done then.

[04:43] And then they really showed the Monsters, of course.

[04:47] That was what the first week or the first or second week of January.

[04:51] And yeah, and since then, there's been no work now.

[04:56] There's been a couple of times where I had decided I wanted to leave Stern for work.

[05:04] I wouldn't say greener pastures because pastures are pastures.

[05:07] But just to get work in, that I wasn't getting.

[05:12] And I was talked to, I have someone who's very big in the industry who is my mentor.

[05:20] And I go to him for questions on whether I'm being foolish or whatever.

[05:27] He convinced me twice to stay and wait it out.

[05:32] And I waited it out and nothing really happened.

[05:35] I mean, there's some stories I could tell about what had happened during that time.

[05:42] Can you tell some of them on the show?

[05:44] Yeah, yeah.

[05:47] Well, I think the first thing was they offered, and now it's probably a good timing

[05:52] that they released their Star Wars game because now I can talk about it.

[05:58] They had first offered that job to me to redraw Star Wars.

[06:03] And like anything with a big company like that, I had to do a try out

[06:09] so that Lucasfilm could see my art.

[06:12] And so I did a drawing of Han Solo and a tie fighter.

[06:17] And when I got the word back, the word back was basically, it's too refined.

[06:23] Which, you know, just basically means it's too nice.

[06:26] They wanted something dumbed down more, more, even more comic bookied on what I did.

[06:31] Some of the samples that they had sent me were really crude

[06:34] and they didn't even look like the actors.

[06:35] And so I just made the call like I'm not going to take it down to this level

[06:40] because it looks like crap.

[06:43] These were like pages of comic art from 1978 or something.

[06:49] So I kind of took the angle that I would do more like a comic book cover,

[06:55] which you know, the artworks used a little nicer on the cover.

[06:59] So again, apparently it was too refined.

[07:00] But rather than say, give it another go, they just shut the door.

[07:05] And you know, what I was told anyway was, you know, they said, thanks, but no thanks

[07:09] and gave Stern a list of people that are approved artists for Lucasfilm

[07:15] and told them to pick out of that bunch.

[07:18] Okay, so that was the last time you sort of were working on a project for Stern.

[07:25] Well, sort of.

[07:26] Well, I didn't even work on it.

[07:28] I mean, I, you know, if you consider the artwork a trial, yeah.

[07:31] Was that after months?

[07:32] It was Chris.

[07:34] Yeah, that was after months.

[07:35] That was about two months, maybe a maybe a February mid somewhere around mid

[07:40] February.

[07:41] We start working on that.

[07:43] But the what that the problem that caused from what I was told by the people

[07:49] at Stern was that they had earmarked me to do that job.

[07:52] They figured I would be on that project, you know, for the next year or so or slightly less.

[07:59] And then they booked everything else with, you know, other artists.

[08:03] So when that job fell through for me, they had nothing for me.

[08:06] So it was basically a waiting game.

[08:09] So then, Jesus, I can't remember.

[08:13] There's a couple of months later, I get a call and it was like on a Wednesday or a Thursday,

[08:19] I think.

[08:20] And I came up with a George Gomez or if it was Greg Ferris, one of them called me and

[08:28] said, Hey, we've got a new job for you.

[08:29] Can you come in on Monday?

[08:31] Can you drive to the office?

[08:32] Because I live in Michigan.

[08:34] So it's a four and a half hour drive.

[08:37] So I said, yeah, no problem.

[08:38] I started making plans to do that.

[08:40] And then I got a call back the very next day and they said, never mind the parameters

[08:45] on the on the license have changed.

[08:48] And we no longer need you.

[08:50] So, you know, there's strike two.

[08:53] Right.

[08:54] Do you normally have to drive four hours to hear about an opportunity?

[08:58] Can't they just use modern communication methods?

[09:02] Yeah, they usually wouldn't call me in just to say, Hey, we want you to work on, you

[09:07] know, smurfs.

[09:09] They would call me in when they had, you know, a whitewood when they had plans and, you

[09:14] know, I could say that when I came in for the monsters, you know, they already had

[09:18] a whitewood or it was mostly finished.

[09:21] Dwight had an idea of what he wanted for code and we could sit there and we were scribbling

[09:24] on a blueprint of the play field and I was making notes that I could take home with

[09:29] me.

[09:30] I'm assuming that's where they were with this job because I don't think they would

[09:35] have me drive all the way down there and say, you're working on smurfs.

[09:38] All right.

[09:39] We'll see you know, we'll email you tomorrow.

[09:42] So yeah, I don't know.

[09:45] How does a job get that deep and then, you know, the situation changes?

[09:50] I really have no idea, but that's what I was told whether whether that's factual or not,

[09:55] you know, what actually happened.

[09:57] Right.

[09:58] You know, I wouldn't know, but you know, at this point around mid June or so, like I was

[10:03] getting extremely frustrated and, you know, again, the rumor was spreading that I wanted

[10:07] to leave because I did.

[10:09] And again, I was convinced this time by George Gomez.

[10:16] You know, I basically sent an email to George and to Greg and to Steven in the art department

[10:25] and just said, you know, hey, you know, past three years have been great.

[10:28] You know, but I'm going to be moving on.

[10:30] Bob was a nice work with you.

[10:33] And I got a message back from George that paraphrasing basically said, you know, sit

[10:39] tight.

[10:40] You know, I want to use you and, you know, pay no attention to what anybody else says or

[10:44] anything else.

[10:45] You know, we'll get you some work.

[10:48] And so sat for another, you know, what June, June, July, August, up to another four months.

[10:55] Right.

[10:56] You know, with nothing.

[10:57] Right.

[10:58] And so, you know, now, now that's, that's basically the story behind the lack of work.

[11:05] There were other situations that I don't want to get too heavy into.

[11:09] You know, I mean, I can give some examples, but I don't want to get too heavy.

[11:13] You know, because it's, you know, I just want to be very clear that, you know, discussing

[11:19] this isn't sour grapes.

[11:21] I think, you know, at the time that I departed, it was sort of a mutual thing.

[11:28] So, you know, it's not, you know, this isn't a case where it was just me and I'm angry

[11:34] with them and, you know, et cetera, it was just, you know, I decided to move on.

[11:39] They decided that that would probably be a good idea as well.

[11:44] So you know, there are, there are stories that I can tell just to give you examples.

[11:49] Yeah.

[11:50] I mean, I'd love to hear some of the stories, Chris.

[11:52] And then I'd love to just ask you some questions about, you know, what the journey's been like.

[11:56] Because I know it's been an interesting journey for you.

[11:59] But by all means, I mean, I just love to hear these stories because we don't often

[12:04] get to hear what goes on behind the scenes of putting, you know, pinball art package

[12:08] together.

[12:09] Right.

[12:10] Yeah.

[12:11] You know, I have to say the journey, you know, it has, it has been a, you know, three-year

[12:16] journey or so I got called in what mid-2016.

[12:21] So yeah, just a little over three years.

[12:25] And sadly, it hasn't been all that pleasant to tell you the truth.

[12:28] It's been great to become part of this community and be a part of pinball and to have

[12:33] a pinball machine in your house that, you know, I mean, I've got four of them that, you

[12:38] know, I can say, look, I drew that.

[12:40] You know, that part's fantastic.

[12:43] The relationship with Stern has not been fantastic over the years.

[12:47] Shortly after Batman was released, everything was great.

[12:52] But we started having disagreements right out of the shoot.

[12:56] What were some of those disagreements?

[12:58] Because Batman, you came in at the 11th hour and really pulled a rabbit out of a hat.

[13:03] I think everyone who loves their Batman 66 and I say that Chris, as I look at this beautiful

[13:10] work art in my bedroom, I have an SLE.

[13:14] From that point on, what started to be some of the issues or the tension points that you

[13:19] experienced?

[13:21] Well, the tension points seem to be with, with me and Gary in particular.

[13:30] Someone would ask me to be a guest at an expo.

[13:34] And rather than show up with a table full of markers and a smile, I would make some

[13:41] prints of, you know, if it was Batman, you know, I would put it to get this in some sort

[13:47] of special print with the Batman artwork.

[13:50] And offer that as something you could get to get signed because people aren't, you know,

[13:54] if they don't know I'm going to be there, maybe they didn't bring their translate.

[13:56] You know, I'm sure not everybody has got their Batman 66 and their trunk.

[14:00] You know, can you come out and sign my game?

[14:03] So it's always good to have something to offer.

[14:05] You know, I've done this before in different situations.

[14:07] You only used to work for KISS and so they would have me out at KISS Expose.

[14:11] And, you know, again, it was always good to have something to sign.

[14:14] So I would make these prints and then somebody from Stern would walk by my table and then

[14:20] call him Gary and go, he's got Batman prints on his table.

[14:24] And Gary would freak out.

[14:25] He'd be like, you don't have a license for that.

[14:27] You can't do that.

[14:28] You know, it's our job to report you if you do do that.

[14:31] And what most people don't know is that there's this sort of unwritten rule because I've

[14:36] been in the industry for a long time.

[14:37] I know this.

[14:38] There's sort of an unwritten rule that if you're an artist and you've designed something,

[14:42] people just kind of tend to look the other way as long as you keep it cool.

[14:45] You keep your numbers low.

[14:47] You know, you don't go.

[14:49] It's not like I'm on the home shopping network at two in the morning going, here's my

[14:53] fantastic new Batman.

[14:54] I'm going to do the addition print of 10,000.

[14:57] You know, if you're low key and you're keeping it cool and you're just doing something

[15:01] that, you know, so that people can get signed, you're not looking to get rich or anything

[15:05] like that, it's overlooked.

[15:07] It's overlooked at comic conventions on a weekly basis.

[15:11] You know, somebody who does artwork for Marvel might have a table right across the hall

[15:17] from Marvel's booth itself.

[15:19] And people from Marvel will walk out and go, hey, I chuck, then I'll walk over to the table

[15:23] and go, hey, wait a minute, these are our characters here.

[15:26] You can't do this.

[15:27] You know, it's always overlooked.

[15:29] I mean, when it comes to the bottom line, yes, it's not licensed.

[15:35] It's unofficial, et cetera, et cetera.

[15:38] But again, it's always overlooked, even by those people, the people who count.

[15:42] You know, Warner Brothers isn't going to call me up and go, hey, you made, you know, 30

[15:46] prints of it, you know, that's it.

[15:47] You know, you're going to jail.

[15:49] But Gary could never understand that.

[15:53] And I didn't expect him to understand it.

[15:56] But I did, you know, after I explained it, you know, 70 times, I expected him to, you

[16:00] know, eventually come around.

[16:02] But he didn't.

[16:03] So we constantly locked horns about what I was offering at an expo.

[16:09] And that was sort of a major, you know, sticking point.

[16:14] You know, and what can you do?

[16:16] I mean, how many times can you explain that?

[16:18] It just, it doesn't go anywhere.

[16:20] I saw that.

[16:21] I think it was at T.P.F.

[16:22] I think you brought, was it T.P.F. where you had the Beatles artwork and it seemed like

[16:27] the other Stern people were getting upset.

[16:29] And you seemed visibly upset that they were upset.

[16:35] And I removed it off the table.

[16:37] Right.

[16:38] And it was an awkward moment because there you are.

[16:41] You know, you've made, and I think people would agree.

[16:45] Some of the nicest art packages that people have ever seen on a pinball machine.

[16:49] And you know me, I don't blow smoke up people's butts.

[16:51] I mean, I think your art style is also perfectly suited for pinball.

[16:56] So it was always like sort of hard to see you who people love and Stern who people also

[17:02] love have these moments in which, you know, it's like you don't know, you know, you don't

[17:08] know which side to side with.

[17:10] And it seemed like it could have gone a better way.

[17:13] Yeah, definitely.

[17:14] You know, I was, I had never had anything against Stern.

[17:21] You know, I was, I was never really thrilled with, with the way I was treated there.

[17:26] It's kind of hard to explain.

[17:29] But I didn't hold any grudges because of that.

[17:31] So, so why those things couldn't be worked out, I don't know.

[17:33] But, you know, in my tenure working three years at Stern, it seemed I never broke the ice

[17:39] with, or I broke the ice with very few people there.

[17:43] But you know, for the most part, got a, got a cold shoulder, you know, to tell you the

[17:47] truth.

[17:48] Ferris is either a man with very little personality or just an extreme distaste for me because

[17:54] he would never joke around.

[17:57] He was always, you know, I would send an email that had something plain.

[18:00] He would send back, you know, we need you to change this, you know, and we'll completely

[18:04] avoid whatever humor I was trying to send his right.

[18:07] And is it from the very beginning, like of the relationship, even after Batman, or is

[18:11] this like, do you think there was a little, Batman happened so fast that it's, it's hard

[18:17] to really kind of remember, you know, like what was happening, you know, how were we establishing

[18:23] relationships at that time?

[18:24] I mean, I was, you know, none of us, I think we're in that mindset.

[18:28] It was just, you know, we've got a job to get done and we got to get it done.

[18:31] So I wasn't concerning myself with, you know, did he laugh at my joke or anything like

[18:34] that?

[18:35] It was just like, all right, what's next?

[18:37] What's next?

[18:38] You know, because that job kind of unfolded on me as it went along.

[18:41] They never called me up and said, we need you to do three art packages, you know, in

[18:45] artwork for the play field and all that.

[18:47] They originally called me just to do the drawings of the gadgets.

[18:52] And then Greg kept saying, geez, I wish you, we could get you to do at least one back glass.

[18:57] And I said, send me the template.

[18:58] I'll have one for you by the morning.

[19:00] He's like, you can do that.

[19:01] And I said, yeah, I said, I've already got artwork done that I can use, you know, so just

[19:05] a matter of placing it, you know, and then filling in the gaps.

[19:10] So I did that.

[19:11] He's like, wow, great.

[19:12] Can you do another one?

[19:13] You know, and it just unfolded like that.

[19:14] Can you do another one?

[19:15] Can you do a cabinet?

[19:16] Did you ever see Chris, the original design they had for Batman?

[19:22] Like, was it just Photoshopped art on there?

[19:25] I saw what I believe was a back glass design.

[19:29] And it was, yeah, it was Photoshopped with some elements, you know, some art elements.

[19:37] Like, you know, I think they had like a bad signal shining up in this kind of, but I remember

[19:40] it being very sparse.

[19:41] Right.

[19:42] Like there were some characters kind of going through the middle, but there was like a

[19:45] whole lot of purple background, a lot of wasted space.

[19:49] I know, I don't know who did it, but I know that they weren't pinball people.

[19:53] It was, it was, you know, nobody of, you know, of a name that you heard of.

[19:57] I'm Kevin O'Connor to the play field, but he obviously did not do.

[20:03] I'm familiar with Kevin's work.

[20:05] The stuff I saw was not Kevin's work.

[20:07] It was nowhere close.

[20:08] Right.

[20:09] So, yeah, that's why they were unhappy with it.

[20:13] But I think it might have been casino people, you know, gaming slot machine artists.

[20:17] Right.

[20:18] Right.

[20:19] Chris, so you've done just so the listener knows you went Batman 66, then it was Guardians

[20:24] of the Galaxy, then it was Beatles and then Monsters, right?

[20:28] I have that order, correct?

[20:29] Yeah.

[20:30] Okay.

[20:31] Out of the four, I'm just curious, can you pick a favorite of your children within the

[20:35] Stern pinball family or do you love them all equally?

[20:41] I do.

[20:44] I can say the one I like the least is Guardians because, you know, and it's not that I'm,

[20:52] you know, ashamed of what I've done.

[20:53] I like the artwork, but Batman, you know, that holds a dear, dear place in my heart.

[21:00] You know, Batman always will, you know, is it the best art package I could have come

[21:04] up with?

[21:05] Probably not, but I didn't have any time.

[21:07] But because Batman is so important in my life, you know, such a big thing.

[21:11] You know, I collect TV show, Batman's, you know, the TV show in particular, that, you

[21:15] know, that's my jam.

[21:16] So getting that job was awesome.

[21:19] But so that will always be up there.

[21:21] The Beatles I love just from the retro aspect, it was fun to do something, you know, kitschy

[21:26] and 60s like.

[21:29] And the Monsters I feel was my best work, you know, as far as, you know, designing, you

[21:38] know, the play field, you know, maxing it out, you know, giving it the biggest bang for

[21:42] your buck and really working hard on the artwork to make it look good because the source

[21:48] material was awful.

[21:49] Right.

[21:50] And it looks phenomenal.

[21:51] I think people would say that when you look at Monsters, even when I was a look at Batman,

[21:55] you know, there's like, there's like the blank areas, but there's no areas without detail

[21:59] and monsters and it looks phenomenal.

[22:01] Now let me, let me ask you was, was the plan initially to have the limited edition black

[22:06] and white?

[22:10] Well I'm, I'm sworn to see Chrissy on that.

[22:16] Right.

[22:17] Because it just seems like, well, okay, let me ask it a different way.

[22:21] Initially, they released it, the premium as the black and white, the Ellie was full

[22:27] color.

[22:28] And then were you happy when you saw that they then added the color to the premium or do

[22:33] you wish they would have kept them sort of, you know, exclusive to the Ellie?

[22:38] Yeah, it didn't happen that way actually.

[22:40] I designed all three of them in color.

[22:44] And then at sort of zero hour, they said, we're going to make the premium black and white.

[22:50] And it just so happens that the premium, like I learned a big lesson with guardians because

[22:56] I thought, you know, let's put the best art package on the pro because that's going

[23:02] to be seen the most.

[23:04] I should have made my decision on, you know, who's paying for what?

[23:08] And if you're paying more for a premium, you should get for your money.

[23:11] That should have been my mindset, but that was more, hey, you know, because of, you know,

[23:17] these games going out and out and all that, you know, people are going to see the pro

[23:19] more.

[23:20] So let's give that the best artwork.

[23:22] Wrong choice.

[23:23] Right.

[23:24] So when I was working on the monsters, I'm like, I really put a lot into the premium.

[23:28] You know, as you know, the limited edition was very unique, you know, the casket thing.

[23:33] So that was kind of a thing all its own.

[23:35] But between the pro and the premium, I really wanted to make the premium artwork shine.

[23:40] And when Greg came to me and said, well, we're going to do this in black and white, I'm

[23:44] like, we can't, I can't, no, I can't kill this art.

[23:48] Like let's switch the packages back and forth.

[23:51] So let's move the premium, leave the color intact and put that on the pro.

[23:58] Move the pro artwork over to the premium and then take the color out of it.

[24:03] Right.

[24:04] So that's what I did.

[24:05] And that's, you know, I spent days doing that because you can't just, I mean, you can

[24:11] flatten the art and then just hit one button that converts it to black and white.

[24:16] But it doesn't make it ideal.

[24:18] Like, you know, all the reds will come out really dark and wants like a black.

[24:21] The yellows come out, you know, more mid range rather than a brighter white color.

[24:27] So I literally had to go through like 600, 500, 600 layers one at a time and then you hit,

[24:33] you know, you hit a setting and then you can, for each color, you know, it has a value

[24:38] of gray and a black to white value.

[24:41] And so you can go yellow, you know, where do I want this to hit and you hit and you know,

[24:45] you drag a slider back and forth and you go right about there, reds right about there.

[24:50] So you got to dial it all in and then hit OK, then move to the next layer.

[24:53] So you can imagine with like, you know, 500, 600 layers, that's going to take a long time

[24:57] to do.

[24:58] But I didn't, you know, I wanted it to look as good as it could.

[25:02] So, so that's how that basically.

[25:04] Right.

[25:05] It looks great.

[25:06] It looks great.

[25:07] And I think you were telling me one time there was a desire to try to get actual coffin

[25:13] handles onto the LE.

[25:16] Yeah.

[25:17] Yeah.

[25:18] And so what I originally designed it was, you know, the handles on the cabinet were actually

[25:25] casket handles.

[25:26] I found them for cheap to a surprise like 12 bucks for a set of four.

[25:29] I'm like, can I have a here really?

[25:31] And they were like, you know, metal and everything.

[25:33] There's actually a website and I believe it or not.

[25:37] It's something as easy as like caskethandles.com.

[25:39] It's really that, you know, obvious.

[25:43] And so, so yeah, you know, it wasn't an expense issue.

[25:46] I just said, hey, you know, I can get these for 12 bucks for a set of four.

[25:51] They're my business set of two.

[25:52] So 24 bucks for a set of four, but still.

[25:56] And the concern was that people might actually try to pick up the game.

[26:00] Yeah.

[26:01] George said, you know, yeah, George said people are going to have a couple of beers and they're

[26:04] going to try and move this thing by the handles and it's going to crack the cabinet.

[26:08] And I couldn't argue with that.

[26:10] You know, it's, you know, I mean, you could put metal, you know, plates behind it to help

[26:16] secure it or whatever you could try that.

[26:19] But, you know, for a simple aesthetic, you know, is it really worth it?

[26:24] You know, are people like piling in between pinball machines to watch and they hit their

[26:29] knee on the handle, you know, right?

[26:31] Right.

[26:32] It was just a bigger liability than it was worth.

[26:35] I'm done with.

[26:36] I'll just draw them on there.

[26:37] You know, it's unfortunate.

[26:38] But we even tinkered with the idea or I tinkered with the idea of selling like sort of a

[26:44] vinyl patch where you could put it over your cabinet.

[26:47] It would cover up the handles and then you could put actual handles in there if you wanted.

[26:52] But then there would always be that seam, you know, if you didn't, if you didn't have

[26:55] a decal that covered the entire side, there would always be a seam.

[26:58] And if someone's not real crafty with the vinyl, they don't line it up just right.

[27:02] It's going to look like crap.

[27:03] And so it's just best to abandon it.

[27:06] Chris, I mean, it's your question because as, you know, you did a killer R-packet with

[27:09] monsters, how sensitive are you to win a game finally ships and like people are like,

[27:15] I love it.

[27:16] And then, you know, maybe people have issues with the shots or the code.

[27:21] Do you ever feel like that?

[27:23] Does that get to you?

[27:24] Because we know that people have had like ups and downs with reviews of the monsters code

[27:28] and people want more monsters in it.

[27:30] Like, how do you feel like when a game gets reviewed?

[27:32] Like, how do you take it?

[27:34] I kind of feel, well, you know, it's tough.

[27:37] You know, you got to have thick skin.

[27:39] Not everybody's going to like it.

[27:41] You know, even beyond the code, which is like, you know, the artwork for, you know, for

[27:45] example, with the monsters, you know, there were, there were, you know, a handful.

[27:49] There were a couple of people that were giving me heat for doing an illustration of the

[27:54] monsters that was based on some statues, some macaques.

[27:57] You know, of course, what they don't know is that the guy that made those macaques as

[28:01] a friend of mine.

[28:03] I saw those, I knew that they existed prior to even working on the monsters.

[28:08] And as soon as I got the job, I called them up and I said, you know, with your statues,

[28:12] you created the perfect family portrait.

[28:14] And I'd love to draw this just how it is.

[28:18] You know, I made some different, you know, made different expressions on the faces and

[28:21] all of that sort of thing.

[28:22] But for the most part, I, I use that.

[28:25] And, you know, people like, oh, he just stole this from statues.

[28:28] And it's like, now they're a little bit more winning.

[28:30] You know, just stealing, you know, I would not call it that.

[28:33] Number one, I got permission.

[28:35] And number two, it was intentional.

[28:39] You know, because, you know, people like, you know, if you compare me to zombie Eddie,

[28:43] we're two different types of people.

[28:46] You know, I'm more of an illustrator.

[28:49] He's more of a creator.

[28:51] You know, he'll sit down and he'll just start drawing things.

[28:55] Or as I base my stuff on, you know, in reality, you know, it's like I use photo reference

[29:00] as things like that.

[29:03] You know, a lot of people who do the style of work that I do do do it that way.

[29:07] You don't have a model come in and, you know, here put this on and pose like this.

[29:11] And then they, they use that for lighting references or whatever.

[29:15] So, you know, so that part was tough, you know, because you don't want to come out and

[29:19] start defending yourself because then as soon as you do that, then they jump all over

[29:22] you.

[29:23] But, you know, blood, they're good.

[29:25] And especially on forms, they love some blood.

[29:29] But it was tough, you know, because I consider myself like the, the artist for the red-headed

[29:34] stepchild games.

[29:36] Like Batman came out and everybody hated it because of the, well, at first because of

[29:40] the price.

[29:41] And then, you know, when it became obvious that the code was very young, they crapped all

[29:45] over it.

[29:46] So then I come out with guardians and what happens with that same thing, the code, things,

[29:51] blah, blah, blah, you know, everybody's dead.

[29:54] Yeah, at this point, blah, blah, blah, yeah.

[29:56] But at this point, you know, I had to make fun of that to make myself feel better.

[30:00] I made little pins that has that character and it says, bobly bobo.

[30:03] And I was passing them out at X-bow.

[30:05] And I still have something if you want one.

[30:08] Yeah.

[30:09] Send them my way.

[30:10] You know, yeah, I mean, it was just sad.

[30:12] It was like, you know, God, you know, you want to feel good about this.

[30:14] And like the game comes out, you can't wait for the game to come out.

[30:17] And for everyone to see what you've been doing for a year.

[30:19] And then it comes out and you're like, yeah, this sucks.

[30:22] And you know, and when it's something that's out of your control, when, you know, like the

[30:25] code sucks, well, I didn't do the code, you know, so it's not on me.

[30:30] So and then, you know, a whole different beast comes out when the Beatles comes out.

[30:34] Everybody craps on that strictly because of the price.

[30:38] So now I'm my third game in and I'm like, you know, can I win at all here?

[30:42] Can I have a game release where everyone just celebrates it as being something awesome?

[30:46] Right.

[30:47] That would be great to just experience that once.

[30:50] And I kind of did with monsters, you know, monsters had a lot of hype leading up to it

[30:55] when it came out, you know, there was, there was, you know, when it, right when it first

[30:59] came out, there was no, you know, the hype didn't live up to it.

[31:03] You know, I think everybody really liked it.

[31:06] They really liked the art and everything.

[31:08] But as the code slowly got exposed for being very shallow, then all the dumping on that

[31:15] game started and of course, we all know where it is now, like, you know, tucked back in

[31:19] the closet somewhere.

[31:20] Yeah, I'm trying to think, I'm trying to, I'm trying to think, Chris, I don't even know

[31:24] if it's, you know, just, you know, that's just what's happens to you.

[31:28] I'm trying to think of a game that's come out recently from, let's just take Stern

[31:33] that, that was applauded from day one and didn't get criticized.

[31:37] I mean, well, they all get criticized, but to, you know, to a certain extent, like,

[31:42] I think you can call, you know, you can call Jurassic Park, you know, a victory.

[31:47] Yeah, I think, you know, look, Ellen, Ellen has a fan base.

[31:52] Ellen has a fan base.

[31:53] And I think it's deservedly so not to take anything away from Keith, that basically,

[31:59] he's going to have a cheering section with, with every new game because he, he designs the

[32:04] games to be different from the typical fan layouts that we see in a lot of games.

[32:08] Well, not only that, he's also, you know, you'd consider him a fan who made it.

[32:13] Like, you know, he's one of, he's one of the, you know, he's for the people by the people,

[32:17] you know, so he'll be happy.

[32:18] Absolutely.

[32:19] So he would have a game to appease the people who are the biggest critics who are the

[32:22] tournament players and he's one of them.

[32:24] And so it's, he finds, you know, the perfect marriage for them with the game.

[32:29] So right now, because you've also done something that has really sparked a lot of conversation

[32:34] and that, that has been, you've shared some pinball theme mockups that you thought would

[32:42] be great.

[32:43] And I want to talk a little bit about that.

[32:45] So I just saw Wonder Woman.

[32:46] I believe it was yesterday that looked incredible.

[32:48] We saw Superman.

[32:49] Is it 78?

[32:51] Yeah.

[32:52] And Beetle, Christopher.

[32:53] Yeah.

[32:54] So talk to me about the period in which these came about.

[32:59] Well, these were projects that I had been working on over the past year and a half for Copau

[33:08] for Joe Camonco.

[33:13] The Beatles and I'm sorry, not the Beatles, a Beetle juice, some sort of Beetle thing.

[33:19] Beetle juice and Superman were kind of hand in hand at the same time.

[33:25] Beetle juice was something I suggested and he had, you know, he had he was familiar with

[33:29] the license because of his gaming background, you know, Joe's like the man when it comes

[33:34] to the licensing, he can get anything.

[33:37] And then he, you know, he had just done some sort of a charity event where, you know,

[33:42] the Christopher Reeve family was involved and he's like, Hey, let's do a Christopher Reeve,

[33:47] you know, pinball.

[33:48] Of course, whatever Joe does, it doesn't automatically get done.

[33:52] It has to be brought to someone, you know, usually in the first case, Stern, because like

[33:58] the Beatles started at Stern, Stern passed and then it kind of went around and then Stern

[34:03] changed their mind.

[34:04] But it always starts out at Stern because Joe and Gary are good friends.

[34:10] So he would basically go there and pitch these ideas and both of them, you know, at the

[34:17] same time, basically, he brought them in, Beetle juice and Superman, both of them got

[34:20] shot down.

[34:23] What I was told was they were presented to the teams and nobody was interested in doing

[34:29] them and because you don't want someone to spend a year or something that they don't

[34:33] like because you don't, you know, they don't feel you'll get a good game.

[34:37] They just passed on it though, you know, I was told by one designer in particular that

[34:41] he was never even asked about either one of them.

[34:44] I'm not going to mention names because I don't want to get anybody in trouble.

[34:46] But they're like, why would we do these two titles when we can make black night sort

[34:51] of rage?

[34:52] That'll solve.

[34:53] Yeah.

[34:54] Yeah.

[34:55] Yeah.

[34:56] Yeah.

[34:57] The joke senses become, you know, if it doesn't have muscles, motor, you know, sports

[35:01] cars, superheroes or, you know, somebody with a big gun, then they're not interested,

[35:06] you know, it's got to be all this macho stuff.

[35:09] But yeah, so whatever.

[35:11] So whatever.

[35:12] Yeah.

[35:13] That, right.

[35:14] That was actually a big, a big prop, you know, a big wedge that ended up, you know, driving

[35:21] myself and stirring apart as well because Gary got really, I guess they were getting

[35:27] a lot of backlash because of that.

[35:29] Now, you know, when I posted that artwork, it was like, you know, trying to be good to

[35:36] the community, you know, like, hey, look, you know, this is neat because, you know, at

[35:40] the time, well, now it seems like there's a new pinball machine every week, but, you know,

[35:44] a year ago, you know, there, you know, news was few and far between.

[35:49] So it was like, you know, hey, look at this.

[35:51] Here's something cool.

[35:52] Here's something you'll never see.

[35:53] Here's our work for a pinball machine that's not getting made.

[35:56] And even George Gomez comment, you know, people were complaining, you know, on my post,

[36:00] you know, why isn't this being made?

[36:02] George came in and made a comment about, you know, explaining basically if no one's

[36:06] interested, then why make it?

[36:09] You know, and they were getting beat up pretty bad.

[36:11] So I took that post down and I reposted it with George's comment as part of my, you know,

[36:18] photo comment and backed it up and said, you know, yeah, you guys aren't going to want

[36:23] a game that someone wasn't behind.

[36:25] You know, so backed up what George said, you know, trying to be as PC as possible.

[36:29] Again, just in the interest of giving people something interesting to look at.

[36:34] And I guess people were just going to stern and go and like, well, you know, especially

[36:38] this, especially with Beatles juice.

[36:39] And like, why didn't you make this that would have been great?

[36:42] So Gary took the viewpoint that I did this to make him look bad.

[36:47] Right.

[36:48] Sabotaging their desire to give the fans what they want.

[36:51] Yeah.

[36:52] So, you know, that's what initiated the emails to George and to drag in that was that,

[36:58] you know, I get a, I get a text message from Joe Kamikaze says, well, you're done.

[37:03] It's turned.

[37:04] And I'm like, what, what happened?

[37:05] He's like, well, Gary's pissed because he made him look dumb.

[37:08] I'm like, how did I make him look dumb?

[37:09] What did I do?

[37:11] And he talked about this.

[37:12] And I'm like, are you kidding?

[37:13] Like, okay, well, whenever, you know, and that's when I sent the emails and, you know,

[37:17] it's been nice working with you and I got the email back, you know, just sit tight.

[37:20] Don't worry about it.

[37:21] So, is there like, is there a division within Stern between George Gomez who knows what

[37:27] he needs to make the best games and Gary who seems to be more of the financial driver

[37:34] and easily upsetable CEO of the company or like, well, what's the dynamic between those

[37:39] two?

[37:41] I would say that while the dynamic between those two, I think it's kind of exactly how

[37:46] you explained it.

[37:47] You know, George is the reality guy who's got to get stuff done and Gary's the guy who

[37:52] says, you know, do we really need this?

[37:55] It costs $20.

[37:56] You know, so George tries to keep everybody's vision alive as far as the designers go and

[38:03] keep the, you know, the fans and the buyers happy, but while still trying to address Gary's

[38:08] concerns.

[38:09] So I kind of look at George.

[38:10] I've always looked at him as sort of a referee like he should wear a black and white

[38:13] stripe shirt to work every day and stand between Gary and the pinball designers, call

[38:20] foils, call penalty, you know, whenever necessary.

[38:23] You know, so you kind of old everything to you.

[38:26] Yeah, because the question I have is, and I think a lot of the designers and passionate

[38:30] people at Stern sometimes get criticized for cutting corners, but it seems like the more

[38:35] I hear from designers and from artists like yourself and people, they all want to put

[38:40] the most they can into these games, right?

[38:44] Yeah.

[38:45] Yeah.

[38:46] Yeah, the monster's got, got stripped down.

[38:49] I remember a day dealing with a poor Mr. Borg where he was really frustrated about having

[38:56] to take something out.

[38:59] And he was basically kind of going through the game and just pulling everything out like

[39:04] screw it, you know, it's just going to be like a couple of crumbs laying in there and the

[39:08] pinball bouncing around.

[39:10] And I kind of calmed him down.

[39:16] I didn't quite, it sounded kind of cool, but it didn't quite get it through the phone

[39:20] conversation because he was kind of heated up and, you know, and he's speaking like I

[39:25] know engineering and I'm just like, what?

[39:28] So it sounded kind of neat and had something to do with the multi ball and a clock and

[39:31] something, but I don't really remember.

[39:34] But yeah, I had to calm him down.

[39:36] Like I had to talk him back into leaving the car in the the Dracula that, you know, the

[39:40] little hot wheels car that's mounted in there.

[39:42] He took it out and threw it across the room and I'm just like, I'm like, you know, John,

[39:46] come on, how much is that?

[39:47] It's like a two or three dollar car.

[39:49] Come on, put it back in.

[39:50] You know, it adds a little something, you know, so, you know, I'm granted you didn't go

[39:54] get it sculpted and it's not an original toy, but you know, you got the hermit in there.

[39:57] Like, it's just a car, put it, you know, calm down, put it back in.

[40:02] I love it.

[40:03] I would love to be a fly in the wall when a designer just loses it at Stern and just

[40:06] starts like yanking everything out of the game, be like, screw it.

[40:10] I think, you know, it's funny is like they did make that game where someone yanked everything

[40:14] out.

[40:15] It's called Black Knight sort of rage.

[40:16] Get it now.

[40:17] Bye, bye, bye.

[40:18] I thought for sure you were going to say Star Wars.

[40:21] I mean, clearly something was supposed to go where the tie fighter in the spring was

[40:25] and where that screen was because those just look like, let's just tack on something

[40:31] where something more should have been.

[40:32] But I won't even go down that road with Star Wars.

[40:34] I still think it's the biggest mechanical miss to the biggest franchise in the history

[40:38] of pinball, really.

[40:40] I don't think that was a, that was not a match made in heaven.

[40:44] I don't think that was something to give to Steve.

[40:47] Steve's a great designer, but he doesn't concern himself with as much, from what I see,

[40:53] you know, it's not an insult.

[40:55] I'm just saying, he doesn't seem to concern himself with the aesthetics as much as he

[40:59] does the, the gameplay, you know, and how well everything shoots in the flow and, you

[41:04] know, all the stuff that we know Steve for.

[41:06] But Star Wars was definitely one of those things where the world under glass, as you

[41:10] say, was really important.

[41:13] And, you know, yeah.

[41:15] Well, styles, styles make games, right?

[41:17] And it's interesting how they put certain players on the field for certain titles.

[41:24] And sometimes they get it right, sometimes they get it wrong.

[41:27] Ultimately, it always seems like Gary's just like, let's just keep the line moving and

[41:31] whoever's got time, put them on it.

[41:32] And it's like, there might be some, I don't know how they draw straws to see who gets

[41:36] what, but it's interesting.

[41:39] So Chris, let me ask you a question.

[41:40] So you're at this period and then, you know, you shared some beautiful Willy Wonka artwork

[41:46] and some beautiful Elvira artwork as well.

[41:49] Do you ever look at a game like Willy Wonka and you're just like, oh, like I wish, I wish,

[41:56] I just...

[41:57] Well, that was my way of telling Jersey Jack, you dialed the wrong number.

[42:02] Because when they came out, I'm just like, I'll just put this artwork out.

[42:06] Yeah, that stuff that I had done was for Zingha for a social media game.

[42:13] And I would have loved to have done Willy Wonka.

[42:15] That's, you know, that's one of them, you know, like you, that's one of my childhood

[42:18] staples.

[42:20] And, you know, I just love Gene Wilder, especially in that role, you know, like he's

[42:24] great and young Frankenstein and other things.

[42:27] But like that's like the role that just seems like it was made for him.

[42:31] I would have really enjoyed to do that.

[42:32] But, um...

[42:33] Do you like the final execution of Wonka?

[42:35] I know you're a big fan.

[42:36] No.

[42:37] Oh, wait, will you tell him about the artwork or the game?

[42:39] Well, not just the game.

[42:41] Um, the game, yeah, I had fun.

[42:43] See, I don't pay attention to code as much as not as important to me.

[42:47] You know, I like seeing the ball do fun things and interesting shots and all that.

[42:51] And I think it has all of that.

[42:53] I had a really good time playing it.

[42:56] You know, but I'm not like a tournament player.

[42:58] I'm not like a serious player, you know.

[43:01] My house is full of toys, you know.

[43:03] It's like that, you know, the visual thing is where I get a kick out of it.

[43:07] You know, and I even have, you know, my high suck at pinball so bad that I can't even

[43:10] look up at the screen or all drain, you know.

[43:12] So whatever's going on on the screen doesn't even matter to me.

[43:17] So yeah, I really enjoyed it.

[43:18] Chris, let me ask you a question, because I know that, I mean, you're very passionate

[43:22] and you're an artist and you're very outspoken.

[43:26] And sometimes you're creating art and people take offense to it.

[43:30] And let's talk a little bit about that because I, and I think we live in a world now in

[43:35] which we talk about this sort of offline or online, but off the record.

[43:40] It's we're in a one in done culture where people, you put up something, they find it

[43:44] offensive and then they come after you.

[43:47] And I know that there was an incident with the fantastic art.

[43:50] I know there was a bow and Karen's incident as well.

[43:55] Yeah, let's talk about that because how do you like, sometimes I feel like the people

[43:59] in this hobby, like they're just like this pressure to just always lean a certain way.

[44:05] And you can never do anything in other way.

[44:07] And then you have to get out with a viral which is like complete, you know, she's selling

[44:11] sex appeal and no one's raising any pitchforks and people are even saying like she's the

[44:14] leader of the feminist movement.

[44:16] So why do you think this gets caught up into all the pinball stuff?

[44:20] You know, it's just people in general, you know, I mean, this is a, this is a, you know,

[44:25] a big topic that you can't just graze over.

[44:27] So I'll, you know, I'll, let me start with, you know, something really basic.

[44:32] And that is number one, people have the right to be offended.

[44:37] You know, the people who are offended by my fantastic art, you know, I don't, you know,

[44:43] I don't take away the right to be offended.

[44:48] But I was trying to say to that at first kindly and then when it escalated and I was getting

[44:52] called names, you know, I lost my cool a bit.

[44:55] But what I'm trying to say to them is like, you know, you have the right to be offended

[44:58] and not like it.

[44:59] But just, you know, the world doesn't change because of your viewpoint.

[45:03] I'm not going to change my art because out of 10 people, one person said that offends

[45:07] me.

[45:08] Sorry.

[45:09] I'm just, I'm just not, you know, because I've got nine other people that like it.

[45:13] So but to, to preface all of this, you know, people have to remember one thing.

[45:17] And that's, I'm 53 years old.

[45:19] I'm old school.

[45:21] And as much as I try to, to, you know, get by in this world that I live in today, it's

[45:28] a lot different than what I grew up in.

[45:30] And, you know, as far as what I'm referring to as, you know, the sensitivity to things like

[45:35] that, you know, like people said that the artwork was sexist and all of that.

[45:39] You know, you know, it is what I know.

[45:42] I wasn't set out, you know, I didn't set out to be sexist or to offend anyone.

[45:48] It's just what I know.

[45:49] I grew up with pinball looking like that.

[45:52] And when I couldn't, you know, what most people don't really know the story behind that

[45:57] art.

[45:58] And that was that I couldn't do, you know, I can't use Batman and Guardians and, you know,

[46:02] like when they have these old school artists come in, they've got a whole body of work

[46:06] that they've done in the past that's, you know, generic titles, you know, fathom or

[46:11] you know, whatever.

[46:12] And they can put all these characters into a cool t-shirt design and be good to go.

[46:17] But when I came in, it was like, okay, you know, well, what's going to, you know, what

[46:20] kind of design is going to say something about you?

[46:22] And I'm like, well, I can't use anything that I've done.

[46:25] No beetles, no monsters, no anything.

[46:28] So I'm like, well, I'll just draw something that appeals to me, you know, and so that's

[46:32] what more can I say about me other than something that I would, you know, enjoy doing.

[46:37] So I'm like, I want to do something based on sort of old, you know, 50s pin-up art,

[46:43] old sci-fi cheesy horror movies, you know, all this kind of stuff that I really like.

[46:47] And let's wrap it all into one design that looks really fun.

[46:52] And you know, I think a circular cut in the jacket was not a big deal because the rest

[46:58] of her body was completely covered.

[47:00] I think a lot of people had a problem with the expression on her face because they said,

[47:06] you know, it looked like she was getting her butt kicked.

[47:08] And I'm like, well, no, that's the expression on the face of about 85, 90% of the pin-up

[47:13] art that you see back then, you know, like some, you know, girls in their backyard

[47:18] walking her flowers and, you know, her little puppies tugging on her dress.

[47:22] And she's like, looking at the camera going, oh my, you know, that's the expression.

[47:26] So, you know, and then they said, well, the woman wasn't empowered because she wasn't

[47:31] winning the battle.

[47:32] And I'm like, well, but I didn't grow up with that.

[47:34] I didn't grow up with, you know, muscular, you know, ronda rock, jigsbeat, and the crap

[47:40] out of stuff.

[47:41] I grew up in a different period where the movie posters, which I love and not because

[47:46] they're sexist or anything, were like a creature from the black lagoon, doing carrying

[47:50] a girl, you know, in a bathing suit in his arms because he fell in love with her because

[47:55] they swam together and, you know, the lagoon.

[47:58] You know, so it's, it came from a very, you know, innocent place of just, you know, things

[48:04] that I enjoy.

[48:05] And then it's got turned around.

[48:06] And what happens is when, when you, you know, mean something very well and it gets taken

[48:11] the complete opposite way.

[48:13] And then you don't get, you know, people don't come to you and go, you know, I understand

[48:17] what you did and all that, you know, just know that, you know, I was a little offended

[48:22] by this.

[48:23] You know, no, they come at you and go, you're a sexist, a whole, you know, you piece of crap,

[48:28] you know, I'm, I'm editing out the swear words here.

[48:32] And, you know, and, and when I get attacked, it's just like, you know, I have a hard time

[48:37] going, well, well, I'm sorry, you know, it's just like, hey, what have you, you know,

[48:41] you punch back.

[48:42] You know, I was, it's, it's funny.

[48:44] You say like, I'm 53.

[48:45] I'm, I'm 43 and I grew up 10 years after you were born.

[48:50] No, before you were born.

[48:52] Uh, wait, no, after.

[48:53] Uh, so, uh, it's funny.

[48:54] It's, buddy, is Brennan and I were watching Top Gun this weekend and they're, they're

[48:58] explaining how like the best pilots get their name put on this plaque.

[49:03] And then one of them makes a joke and says, the plaque for runners up is in the ladies

[49:07] room.

[49:08] And I, and I turned to Brennan.

[49:09] I'm like, you know what, they wouldn't be able to say that today.

[49:12] I think the context of this stuff is just super important about it's a shirt for a pinball

[49:18] show.

[49:19] Is anyone really, yeah, exactly offensive.

[49:22] Well, you know, the, the one thing people have to think is that when you're programmed

[49:27] to hear anything like that, like you said, the, you know, the plaques in the ladies room,

[49:31] certain people hear that and it just sets off a trigger.

[49:35] But you know, that stuff is founded.

[49:37] It's, it's founded, you know, and of course, of, you know, uh, a past where people didn't

[49:42] see the same thing.

[49:44] But there's, there's stuff that still goes true today.

[49:47] Like, you know, you open up the door for your girl.

[49:50] You know, if someone, if someone came at you, you know, you're out with Brenda and, you

[49:53] know, you're going out to dinner.

[49:55] You're walking from the cart of the restaurant and somebody comes at you with a knife.

[49:58] What do you do?

[49:59] You stand between your wife and the guy with the gun or the, the knife or whatever, right?

[50:05] You know, that, that's just, that might just, what we both might do.

[50:09] But you know what I mean, like this, it's human nature.

[50:12] It's human nature to kind of protect your woman and, and, and, you know, so that in a sense,

[50:17] you know, for older folks like us, you know, gives them, um, you know, and in a negative way,

[50:23] you know, a slight sense of frailty where that, you know, the guy's the, the macho guy and

[50:27] the girls, you know, so when you say all the plaques in the girls room, you know, uh, you

[50:32] know, it doesn't mean girl sock.

[50:34] It just means you're not a tough guy, you know, you're a girl who needs a door open for

[50:39] your whatever, you know, we never get those, we never get the other side.

[50:43] I mean, I love hearing women talk about many.

[50:45] Have you ever heard like a group of women talk about me?

[50:47] I mean, it is just the same as how we are just opposite.

[50:50] I mean, it's, it's just never represented as much.

[50:53] Well, let's, let's move on because I know we go down this top.

[50:56] I can't move on.

[50:57] I gotta say one thing about that.

[50:59] Have you ever noticed whenever women are talking about men and they say, well, my husband

[51:03] said they always use this dumb cave man voice, well, I'm like, do all men talk like that?

[51:11] Really?

[51:11] Like, yeah, no, it's like, well, it was like that.

[51:13] Jaletta, like they just got it wrong.

[51:15] Like they had the right sentiment, but then they showed men as like just knuckle dragging

[51:19] the end of the halls who are, it's like there's that scene where the guy just goes to

[51:22] bolt after this woman when he's like, and like guys don't like just start chasing people

[51:27] down like, do they?

[51:28] Like, I don't, anyway, so let's talk about what's next for Christopher, Francian, Pimball.

[51:33] So I know you can say like where you're applying your efforts.

[51:37] I guess the question I would ask is when is the earliest we might see your efforts back

[51:42] in the Pimball world?

[51:45] Well, the earliest you're going to see my efforts is that expo, and that's pretty early,

[51:51] but not in the way you'd think.

[51:54] Right.

[51:55] So you're helping out with some, I know what it is, but I'm not going to say.

[51:58] So people will see that also this show, and we can talk after this, but it's supposed

[52:02] to, I'm not even going to ask how you found out how you know.

[52:05] Like you're amazing.

[52:07] Well, no, but we've rebuilt our trust, and this is part of that.

[52:11] It's like, it's, it's not going to, it's, I think people are going to really appreciate

[52:16] it.

[52:17] It's going to be great.

[52:19] And then do you hope to get back onto a full machine soon?

[52:23] Well, yeah, the plan is for the company.

[52:26] I can't say anything yet because I haven't cleared it with them, but for the company number

[52:30] for what I just did a top or for a game.

[52:34] I'll say that much, and it's going to be revealed at expo.

[52:39] I think right around that time, probably at expo, we're going to sit down and discuss

[52:44] a game that they want me for.

[52:46] They're just buttoning up the details on the license.

[52:49] So they don't, as it was told to me, they don't want to jinx it by saying anything ahead

[52:53] of time.

[52:54] So I honestly don't know what it is, but they said, you know, because of my age, it'll

[52:57] be right in my wheelhouse.

[52:58] Well, that really doesn't narrow it down.

[53:01] But you know, I'm like, Vimea hint.

[53:03] Is it a TV show?

[53:04] Is it a movie?

[53:05] So it sounds like something cool.

[53:07] It's a nostalgic culture, something cool.

[53:10] Do you?

[53:11] I mean, we hear this all the time, and I bring it up on the show all the time.

[53:14] Like dream themes.

[53:15] Did you think that?

[53:17] And I felt like recently in Pimball, I don't feel like they're tapping as many of the

[53:22] dream themes that are out there.

[53:23] I know there's obviously licensing challenges that not everyone's aware of.

[53:27] Now, how do you feel about the offerings and I'm like, what kinds of games would you love

[53:32] to see?

[53:33] Are they the ones we've seen like Wonder Woman and Beetlejuice and Superman?

[53:36] Anything else that you're just like is just screaming to be made in Pimball?

[53:40] I think there's a lot of good stuff out there that I would love to do and not just from

[53:46] an art point, but I think we'll also make a great machine.

[53:49] Beetlejuice, I think, was definitely a mess.

[53:51] That would have been great.

[53:52] I think just because of that whole crazy world, you could do so much, you know, sandworms

[53:57] eating your pinball and, you know, so many different places that the characters went.

[54:04] And the changes that the characters went through would just make for a really deep, exciting

[54:09] game, but whatever.

[54:11] A lot of the stuff that I like, I don't know that other people would appreciate.

[54:16] Like I still would love to see a monster serial pinball machine with Franken, Barry and

[54:21] Chuck Gullo and Boo Barry, you know, like a kind of a silly cartoony haunted house, you

[54:26] know, kind of a game.

[54:27] That sounds terrible.

[54:28] I gotta be honest.

[54:29] As the marketer, like, wait, you try and make a game out of serial box characters.

[54:34] Yeah.

[54:34] Well, because they're fun and everybody knows them from a five year old to a 55 year

[54:39] old.

[54:40] Right.

[54:41] But what about every universe?

[54:42] Isn't that better?

[54:43] Yeah.

[54:44] Yeah.

[54:45] I like, I like matches in the universe.

[54:46] I think that'd be great.

[54:47] I think Pee Wee Herman, you know, in weather.

[54:48] Is there no Pee Wee game?

[54:49] I don't know.

[54:50] I mean, like, just thinking, you know, you drain the ball.

[54:53] Ah!

[54:54] Well, all the toys, the bite.

[54:56] I mean, but see, it's also the perfect storyline to get through to, you know, to the basement

[55:01] of the Alavos to then like this.

[55:03] All the scenes and all the toys and the little gizmos in his house and open the garage

[55:07] door and there he there's the bike.

[55:10] Yeah.

[55:11] There's what's that, I wish forget the guy's name, but the like the breakfast machine

[55:14] that was based on what's that guy's name they call those machines were the, you know,

[55:18] the, you know, the group goberg machine or whatever.

[55:21] Yes.

[55:22] Yeah.

[55:23] Yeah.

[55:24] Definitely.

[55:25] I mean, imagine like the, like, remember the game mouse trap, you know, it was kind

[55:26] of the same thing.

[55:27] Yeah.

[55:28] You could do something like that.

[55:29] Fun with a ball bouncing around going through something.

[55:31] Yeah.

[55:32] I can't, I could not tell you why these things aren't done.

[55:36] I would say I could tell you why they're not done at Stern and that's because Peewee's

[55:40] not manly enough.

[55:41] Do you really think that's the case?

[55:43] I mean, it's turned really just like fraternity of like jock mentality themes.

[55:49] Well, from, from what I see, yeah, from what I see, you know, things get shot down.

[55:54] Wonder Woman?

[55:55] I mean, come on.

[55:56] All right.

[55:57] There's two things about Wonder Woman.

[55:59] Number one, like when was the last time there was like a, you know, female, a big female

[56:04] based pinball machine.

[56:05] There just wasn't.

[56:06] And are you, well, yeah, there you go.

[56:08] There's that.

[56:10] And look how popular they are.

[56:12] And number two, look how many women are coming into pinball.

[56:15] So that's one aspect.

[56:16] Number two, like if you're a pinball designer, you know, this Sunday, well, you know, I don't

[56:21] want to work on some girly thing, you know, for a year in my life.

[56:24] I'm like, who wouldn't want to look at Linda Carter for a year?

[56:27] I've been looking at her for 30 years.

[56:28] And I'm still not sick of it.

[56:30] Well, we also haven't seen like a team or Magnum P.I.

[56:34] I mean, there's also like a bunch of iconic, if that's the case and they want to make

[56:37] something, you know, that appeals to men, dukes of hazards.

[56:40] I mean, that'd be impossible to make now because of the rubber black car.

[56:42] But you're going back to the same old stuff, though macho dude, stuff.

[56:47] And why does it always have to be that?

[56:48] Well, I mean, I guess my point would be if you walk into a pinball show, what are you

[56:53] seeing there?

[56:54] They're seeing guys in their 40s and 50s who grew up watching that stuff.

[57:02] So I'm not surprised.

[57:03] What guy in their 40s and 50s didn't grow up wishing Linda Carter was their girlfriend?

[57:08] No, I know that.

[57:10] But as a pinball machine like in a man cave or in a bar, I can understand why they might

[57:18] want to slant it more towards the action realm.

[57:23] For the most part, yeah, I wouldn't say let's do my little pony and then do Wonder Woman

[57:30] and then we'll do whatever.

[57:33] You know, that I get.

[57:35] But to say, hey, we're coming out with eight games this year.

[57:38] One of them is Wonder Woman.

[57:39] I don't see a problem with that.

[57:41] Yeah, I mean, I would actually argue that the newer Wonder Woman would be the way to

[57:44] go if you want to expand pinball because the movie was phenomenal.

[57:49] It's the same character, both the license.

[57:53] I think the TV show is more fun.

[57:56] Absolutely.

[57:57] You know, it's campy.

[57:58] Yeah, but it's the same character.

[58:03] And there's nothing.

[58:04] What's not manly about an ass-kicking woman?

[58:08] It's still tough.

[58:10] Round of rousey, you're going to take her on.

[58:13] How do you think a cure would sell as a pinball machine?

[58:18] A cure, the band?

[58:19] No, a cure, a cure.

[58:21] You know, my character animated movie.

[58:23] Right.

[58:24] Yeah, yeah.

[58:27] It would, you know, the probably the first pinball they'd take in Japan.

[58:33] I don't think it would do that good.

[58:34] I think it's a cool theme because you've got the speed.

[58:38] You've got that.

[58:39] So it just to be a world, you know, with the crazy, yeah, the music, you know, just the

[58:46] whole vibe of that movie is fun.

[58:49] I just don't think I think most people would be like, what's that?

[58:53] You know, they wouldn't know how to say it.

[58:55] I agree.

[58:56] You know, unfortunately, you know, but they should still just make it just for me.

[58:58] But, okay, so, okay, so there's a lot of themes that are there.

[59:03] So how do you think a company like Deeproot is going to do?

[59:06] And have you ever been in touch with Robert as a company like his seems to be working

[59:11] with a lot of artists and designers and he needs to make a splash and pinball?

[59:16] Well, I, I, I wasn't touched with Robert.

[59:20] I just didn't work out well like the, I think the first time I talked to him, he was interested.

[59:28] Yeah, let's talk.

[59:29] And a couple of weeks later, you know, I'd gone back to Stern.

[59:34] You know, this was, this is throughout, you know, the early part of this year where I was

[59:38] going back and forth.

[59:40] You know, I wanted to leave the mentor told me otherwise, you know, don't leave.

[59:46] So I told, I told him that I wasn't leaving.

[59:50] And then I forgot his name.

[59:52] Who's a guy from Deeproot again?

[59:54] Robert Neil there.

[59:55] Robert, right.

[59:56] Yeah.

[59:57] So and then the second time in June when I was like that said, I had enough, you know,

[01:00:01] I'm leaving.

[01:00:02] I talked to him again and he's like, sounds great.

[01:00:05] You know, we'll get you down.

[01:00:06] Let me talk to my guys and I think he said, you tall.

[01:00:09] Was it Utah office or something?

[01:00:11] He's got a Utah and then I believe it's a Houston.

[01:00:14] Okay.

[01:00:15] Yeah.

[01:00:16] So let me talk to those guys.

[01:00:17] We'll set up, you know, we'll fly in.

[01:00:18] We'll show you the, you know, this, that blah, blah, blah.

[01:00:19] All right.

[01:00:20] Sounds great.

[01:00:21] Well, a month went by and I didn't hear from him.

[01:00:24] So again, I'm like thinking like, okay, well, you know, maybe I better just stay put and

[01:00:29] wait for that work because, you know, you know, I talked to Jack and, you know, he's got

[01:00:34] his games lined up for the next two years.

[01:00:37] So there's nothing there.

[01:00:39] You know, everybody was interested in working with me that just seemed like they, you know,

[01:00:43] they were, you know, they're not stern.

[01:00:44] They don't come out with seven games a year.

[01:00:46] So, you know, that would be, you know, yeah, great.

[01:00:49] We'll talk to you in 2021 when we're ready for our next game.

[01:00:54] Robert was really the only contender, but the second time after he had taken a month,

[01:00:58] I'd just like, all right, screw it.

[01:01:00] I'll go back to stern.

[01:01:01] And then I'd know where, you know, like six weeks later, he's like, okay, we're, you know,

[01:01:06] we're ready for that meeting.

[01:01:07] I'm like, oh, you know, dude, sorry.

[01:01:09] Like I went back, like I got tired of waiting.

[01:01:12] And like basically, my parting words were, you know, we all, you know, I'll see in the

[01:01:18] future down the road somewhere.

[01:01:19] Maybe we can work together and he said, I doubt that.

[01:01:22] And I'm like, well, why, why do you say that?

[01:01:24] And he goes, well, you're too wishy-washy.

[01:01:27] And I'm like, well, I waited for a month, for a meeting.

[01:01:31] Like I don't know as long or you expected me to wait, but, right.

[01:01:34] Well, the clock of pinball, you know, moves fast for some and slow for others, it seems.

[01:01:39] Um, yeah, do you ever regret that, Chris?

[01:01:42] Like it sounds like, I mean, I guess if you could go back and change something,

[01:01:46] do you wish you just kind of got out earlier?

[01:01:48] What, what, what do your, what, what things do you wish you did differently looking back on at all?

[01:01:53] Uh, I'm, you talked about the past year.

[01:01:55] Yeah, like the past, the past year, past year and a half, like you've been through a lot.

[01:02:00] I wish I would have left when I first decided I should go.

[01:02:05] Um, you know, my, my usually used to trust your gut and my gut said, you know, move on to say,

[01:02:11] because like I said, it was not three years of friendly times.

[01:02:15] Uh, you know, there was one day that, that Gary called me up screaming at me for like 10 minutes

[01:02:20] and then just hung up the phone.

[01:02:22] And he was yet like I was like incomprehensible, like tell me something about making money off of his name and.

[01:02:30] And I'm like, what the heck?

[01:02:32] And he's talking about canvases and like I could not understand what, but it was a strange phone call.

[01:02:37] It's like, you know, I pick up the phone.

[01:02:39] Hey, Chris, this is George and, uh, I got Greg with me here and Gary's here and then Gary just like,

[01:02:45] you know, give me the microphone.

[01:02:46] You know, it's like a two dot for 10 minutes.

[01:02:49] He hangs up, you know, um, I call George back or George called me back.

[01:02:54] I don't know.

[01:02:55] Some somehow after that phone call, I had a conversation with George.

[01:03:00] Um, and I'm like, what was that all about?

[01:03:02] And he was talking about these canvases that I had made because when I went into see the guys at Stern about a job,

[01:03:08] I would like to bring in them gifts, you know, so I had designed this retro Stern logo,

[01:03:14] which actually ended up on one of their t-shirts.

[01:03:17] Um, you know, it would, it looked like something that they would have had in the late 60s, early 70s or something as a logo.

[01:03:24] And then I had these canvases made and I came in and it gave me the guys.

[01:03:28] And a couple other people that worked there wanted one.

[01:03:30] So I sent them the art file and I said, well, you know, I'm not going to handle this for you and order it and then have it, you know,

[01:03:36] ship it to you and all that and just go order it yourself.

[01:03:39] Here's the art file.

[01:03:41] Gary's under the impression I was selling these to his employees and apparently other people too.

[01:03:46] I'm like, no, they were just gifts.

[01:03:48] But yeah, like I said, literally got chewed out for like 10 minutes and, um, you know,

[01:03:53] sounds like a lot of fun being.

[01:03:55] Yeah, it was always, it was always something like that was me doing something wrong.

[01:04:02] Um, you know, it just got to be annoying, you know, it's just like, you know, and I never felt, you know,

[01:04:09] like I was telling somebody other day, they said, did you see that video about the, uh, the Star Wars art?

[01:04:15] And I said, yeah, do you know that the four games that I did Stern never called me up and said, hey, we're making a making a video.

[01:04:22] Um, we know you live four hours away and it's a lot to ask, but if you're interested, we'd love to have you.

[01:04:27] Why don't you drive over?

[01:04:29] Uh, never once if you'll notice if you're watching either making a videos for those four games, I'm not in them.

[01:04:34] Right.

[01:04:34] Um, and then when they come out of the Star Wars one, they come out with one with just the artist.

[01:04:39] Alone.

[01:04:40] Right.

[01:04:41] Hey, here's, you know, whatever his name is and he did this and I'm like, wow, that's a slap in the face.

[01:04:46] Do you, do you feel that you never were appreciated looking back on it?

[01:04:51] Yeah.

[01:04:52] Yeah.

[01:04:53] Definitely, definitely.

[01:04:54] Um, and that's very important to me.

[01:04:57] Like, you know, I don't need my ego stroked, but it's very important to me to be valued where I'm working.

[01:05:05] Because then I know that I'm making a difference that I'm doing something right.

[01:05:09] And I never felt that way, which always caused me to second-guess my work and to never, uh, you know, taken as much pride in it as, as I should have, you know, and enjoyed the ride for the, for the past three years.

[01:05:23] Right.

[01:05:23] You know, it's been fun going on these expos and all that, but there's always this over the shadow looming over me of, you know, the company that I work for basically hating me.

[01:05:32] You know,

[01:05:34] you know, when you, when you put up your Elvira artwork, it was stunning.

[01:05:37] And when we first saw the Elvira artwork that they delivered with only one translate and, you know, I think I had some commentary on my show that that your Elvira package was far superior.

[01:05:49] And then I saw Zambiyeti jump, jumped in and like defending Greg's art package.

[01:05:54] How do you feel about the Elvira art?

[01:05:56] You know, they're charging on this money, one translate.

[01:05:59] It doesn't look nearly as detailed as we've seen on the monsters.

[01:06:01] And I know Elvira is a theme that, that you love to draw.

[01:06:05] So what are your thoughts on it?

[01:06:07] Um, my, I've got two different thoughts.

[01:06:10] So in case I forget, remind me to tell you about the expo, the Elvira expo art print at the end of this.

[01:06:18] Um, as far as the game goes, um, that's Greg's baby.

[01:06:23] Um, so I'm not surprised that he did the artwork.

[01:06:26] Um, it, it, it falls in style.

[01:06:29] I think some people may have hoped for like, uh, you know, the, the trilogy to be like, you know, to represent maybe the time periods of which they were made.

[01:06:39] Like rather than have three games that look cohesive together, you know, should we have the Elvira look more like the art does these days.

[01:06:49] Um, and that's a, you know, that's a judgment call really.

[01:06:52] You know, what do you do?

[01:06:54] Um, you know, I don't really have an answer for that.

[01:06:57] I think Greg does what Greg does on that game.

[01:07:01] Um, you know, it, it looks like the other games.

[01:07:04] Um, he's, I think he's been inspired by the people that he works with.

[01:07:09] And, you know, he's showed a couple of new tricks here and there on, on this new game.

[01:07:14] But it is what it is.

[01:07:15] And, and, you know, I, I think the, the, the bashing is unfair a little bit.

[01:07:21] I think, you know, what did you expect?

[01:07:23] You know, people knew, you know, Greg was doing it.

[01:07:26] And, uh, is he going to just change his style?

[01:07:29] You know, like out of nowhere and come out with this, you know, super polished, you know, airbrushed, you know, look or, you know, whatever or something more like what I do.

[01:07:37] Uh, if they were expecting something different, you know, shame on them because, you know, people, people tended, you know, they go with what they know.

[01:07:44] But, um, yeah, the, the, Elvira in general, when the game came out, like I, I know Elvira's manager Scott, because we met two years ago at Texas pinball festival and he came up to me and said he really liked my work and hope we could work together some day and he ran up actually to her to Cassandas room and came down with a hardcover book that was personalized to me from her.

[01:08:10] I'm like, wow, that was nice.

[01:08:11] And so we're talking and, uh, party ways and, and, uh, so when this opportunity came up, um, I thought, well, you know, I'm always struggling, you know, this time at Expo, you know, I'm just going to be a good boy.

[01:08:25] I don't want to ruffle any feathers, you know, show up with bat and art, you know, it had Gary.

[01:08:30] God damn it, blah, blah, you know, so, um, you know, I made an Expo poster.

[01:08:35] Uh, I made a pinball wizard poster that's sort of like my take on the classic old iron on t-shirt design.

[01:08:43] Um, and then I thought, well, here's what I'll do for the first time in my life.

[01:08:46] I will call up Scott.

[01:08:47] I will get a license for an art print, even though I'm still going to keep it to 35, which is a relatively no number, low number, because, you know, it's a 35th anniversary of Expo.

[01:08:57] Um, I'll get a license.

[01:09:00] We'll make the prints.

[01:09:01] I'll sign them.

[01:09:02] Cassandra will sign them.

[01:09:03] It'll be fun.

[01:09:04] So we're talking about the details.

[01:09:06] And I said, uh, I said, I think like 50 bucks, like the print's going to cost 10 bucks for an 18 by 24, which I think is a good size, not too big, not too small.

[01:09:15] Um, I think 50 bucks, you know, 10 bucks for printing will take the 40 bucks and we'll split it in half, which is actually a generous royalty to give.

[01:09:23] Like usually, because I've been in licensing for a long time, and I know that usually a typical percentage for a license is, you know, like around anywhere from seven to 10%.

[01:09:34] 10% being pretty high for like something like the Beatles.

[01:09:36] Right.

[01:09:37] So to give somebody half, you know, 50% of your gross, that's pretty good.

[01:09:42] But um, he's like, well, the problem is is Cassandra goes out at $40 for her autograph.

[01:09:47] So she actually be losing money by signing this.

[01:09:50] And I'm like, okay, well, I don't want that.

[01:09:52] Um, but, you know, I don't know about bumping up the price, especially since it's not like the two of us are going to be sitting next to each other.

[01:10:00] I'm going to be at my table in another room and they're going to have to go into.

[01:10:03] Yeah, people get to meet her.

[01:10:05] That's part of that 40 bucks.

[01:10:06] Right.

[01:10:07] Exactly.

[01:10:08] And let's be honest, my signature is worthless.

[01:10:10] So it actually takes away from the value.

[01:10:13] Now I'm joking.

[01:10:14] Thank you.

[01:10:15] Thank you.

[01:10:16] So, so when he said, you know, let's just take her out of it.

[01:10:19] You sell it for 50 and then they bring it over to us and I'm like, I'm not comfortable with selling it for 50 with just my signature.

[01:10:26] So let's go to 40.

[01:10:28] Um, you know, because yeah, Stern, Stern made it clear that I was not to be in the same room they were in.

[01:10:34] So I'm in the other room.

[01:10:35] So I'm like, okay, well, let's go 40.

[01:10:38] So it's 30.

[01:10:39] It is last year.

[01:10:40] This lot.

[01:10:40] This coming expo.

[01:10:41] This, this is the expo coming up.

[01:10:43] Yes.

[01:10:43] So they won't be, they won't be in the same room as you.

[01:10:47] No, no, they have pretty much their own room between them and, um, Marco.

[01:10:52] Yeah.

[01:10:53] They have a whole, they have a whole room to themselves.

[01:10:55] Oh, wow.

[01:10:56] Okay.

[01:10:57] Yeah, I think I remember that.

[01:10:58] Yeah, they've, they've got that like sort of rectangular room where they always have the designers there and the Stern games.

[01:11:06] Yeah, it'll be much more fun to, you know, it's like I would equate it with the Titanic.

[01:11:11] Do I want to be in the first class with the snobs?

[01:11:13] Do I want to be down, you know, above the ancient room with all the fun people?

[01:11:16] Like, give me the vendor haul any day.

[01:11:19] So anyway, so I said, yeah, let's go 40 bucks.

[01:11:21] That's $30 to split 15 to 15.

[01:11:23] It's like, all right, sounds good.

[01:11:25] Send me your final version of the art.

[01:11:26] I'll pass it by Cassandra.

[01:11:27] We'll get it approved and we'll move forward.

[01:11:29] It's okay.

[01:11:30] So I do that.

[01:11:31] And this is on a Friday.

[01:11:33] And then the next Monday I get this really cryptic text from him.

[01:11:39] And I can't access it because it's on my phone.

[01:11:41] But, um, so to kind of paraphrase, it's like another licensee has secured rights for art prints.

[01:11:50] And, you know, basically, therefore me being there with a license art print would be a conflict

[01:11:55] of interest. So sorry we can't do business.

[01:11:58] So I'm like, that can be.

[01:12:00] Yeah.

[01:12:02] Well, you know, I basically found out, you know, by playing smart, shall we say, and pretending

[01:12:08] I knew what had happened.

[01:12:12] You know, and I'll leave the person that I had a conversation without out of this.

[01:12:17] Um, but, uh, basically told them, well, so you squished my license just to, just

[01:12:24] just squished me out of there.

[01:12:26] Uh, and my brevision was told, yes, it's just business.

[01:12:30] That jody.

[01:12:30] So I thought something jody wouldn't do.

[01:12:32] No, it's not jody.

[01:12:34] All right. Well, jody.

[01:12:35] Actually, I don't know who it was.

[01:12:36] I don't know who it was who did that.

[01:12:39] What had basically happened was, you know, this guy knew that I were concerned.

[01:12:42] He didn't know I left.

[01:12:44] So it was brought up in, you know, casual conversation between Friday and Monday that I was doing

[01:12:49] this and they went, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:12:51] I don't know who it was.

[01:12:52] What I'm not telling you is who I had the conversation with afterwards.

[01:12:56] I don't know actually who squished it.

[01:12:58] What do you, what stuff are you bringing to Expo that people can expect?

[01:13:03] That people can expect.

[01:13:05] Well, I'm bringing, um, uh, my pinball wizard poster.

[01:13:09] Okay.

[01:13:10] I'm bringing, um, and again, that's, I don't know.

[01:13:13] If anybody remembers, there was a classic iron on from the 70s, um, that I remember.

[01:13:18] It was like the stupid shirt that I always wanted, but I never found.

[01:13:21] I always saw it in comic books, you know, and stuff.

[01:13:24] But, um, anyway, so I did like, sort of my take on that.

[01:13:29] Um, and it's kind of a colorful,

[01:13:32] almost like, looks like a black light poster, but not quite.

[01:13:35] And I will also have, uh, sort of a commemorative poster of the artwork that I did for the Expo,

[01:13:41] which is that the rocket dude.

[01:13:44] Um, I don't have some random other stuff that I've done.

[01:13:48] Uh, that's not pinball related.

[01:13:50] Um, I will have actually nobody knows this.

[01:13:53] So breaking news on Canada's pinball podcast.

[01:13:57] But are we going to air this?

[01:13:58] Uh, we're not going to air this before Expo though.

[01:13:59] Are we?

[01:14:01] Oh, that's right.

[01:14:02] I'm going to make that clear.

[01:14:03] Oh, yeah.

[01:14:04] So this, um, imagine if you go back in time.

[01:14:08] Oh, and sit on my lap and have one bedroom before Expo.

[01:14:12] But anyway, they'll know about it.

[01:14:14] So you can talk about it.

[01:14:15] That's what I'm saying.

[01:14:15] They'll know about it.

[01:14:16] Yeah.

[01:14:17] Yeah, I let's put it this way.

[01:14:18] I will have had and probably sold up quickly.

[01:14:21] Five trans lights of the Wonder Woman artwork.

[01:14:24] Oh.

[01:14:26] So yeah.

[01:14:28] Um, I have some other trans lights too.

[01:14:30] Uh, um,

[01:14:33] Beetlegeeks.

[01:14:34] I think those games would be hard to get the licensing

[01:14:37] or could, could Mr.

[01:14:38] Kamikawa Paul.

[01:14:39] No.

[01:14:40] No, the licensing is easy.

[01:14:42] If Joe couldn't get the license, he wouldn't have bothered

[01:14:45] having me go through all that work.

[01:14:47] So that, so that the, the, the anger is real of the fans of these

[01:14:52] franchises when they appear at Stern's door with pitch forks

[01:14:55] because it really was just Stern's lack of desire to make them.

[01:14:58] Exactly.

[01:14:59] Yeah, they're totally doable and they're, they're easy licenses to get.

[01:15:02] Okay.

[01:15:03] Which is funny now because moving, you do realize what you've done

[01:15:06] though, Chris, because moving forward, any theme that seems inferior

[01:15:09] to those themes, people are going to be like, why?

[01:15:13] Why did you deprive us of like what we could have had?

[01:15:17] Beetlegeek and Beetlegeeks is like relevant.

[01:15:19] There's a Broadway show like Michael Keenan.

[01:15:22] Oh, yeah.

[01:15:23] Well, I think some, you know, another, I'll say another company has expressed

[01:15:27] an interest in picking up Beetlegeek's.

[01:15:29] Um, you know, well, I don't want to say they're dead.

[01:15:32] They're dead with Stern.

[01:15:33] You know, Stern's not going to do them.

[01:15:36] And actually the, the people who are interested in doing Beetlegeek's

[01:15:40] want my artwork, you know, they don't just want to like, hey, I want to do that game.

[01:15:43] Well, you, but you know, and you also come with, so here's the question I have.

[01:15:47] Like, would Joe help another company get a lot, because Caphow is independent from them.

[01:15:53] Yeah, but Joe wouldn't need to.

[01:15:55] Yeah, if you wanted something like Harry Potter or some huge massive thing,

[01:16:00] you might want to call in, you know, support like Joe.

[01:16:04] Right.

[01:16:05] Let me, Chris, let me question it, because I know we're getting near to the, the end,

[01:16:08] because we're a little bit over an hour.

[01:16:10] Is Jaws ever happening?

[01:16:12] I mean, what were the rumors?

[01:16:13] Jaws?

[01:16:14] Yeah.

[01:16:15] Well, here's the thing with Jaws.

[01:16:18] Jaws you can't get, basically what you get with Jaws is you get the shark

[01:16:24] and you get the logo.

[01:16:25] The music?

[01:16:26] It's even questionable.

[01:16:28] I don't know.

[01:16:28] It's questionable that you get the music.

[01:16:30] I don't know.

[01:16:31] I know they got John Williams music for Star Wars and he did, he did Jaws,

[01:16:35] but it all depends on, you know, how the deal is.

[01:16:38] So no film, no film assets from Spielberg.

[01:16:41] You'd be completely making like a Jurassic Park original Jaws adventure.

[01:16:46] Yeah, that I don't know.

[01:16:48] I know you couldn't use like actors.

[01:16:51] Well, then how do you like, you know, they're what?

[01:16:53] Well, I mean, can they, can they show footage from the movie of the, of the shark

[01:16:56] cruising through the water and all that?

[01:16:58] I don't know.

[01:16:59] It would be like higher to the Caribbean,

[01:17:02] coded where everything but the actors.

[01:17:06] Yeah, yeah, because I actually, I did T-Shirt designs.

[01:17:10] The whole movie's the actor's lines.

[01:17:13] Exactly.

[01:17:13] Well, you know, it's like that's why I told somebody.

[01:17:15] I said, you know, the Jaws isn't about a shark.

[01:17:18] A shark is just the threat.

[01:17:20] The movie's about three totally different people who have to come together and solve a problem

[01:17:25] and problems that they come across on the way to do that.

[01:17:29] You know, the shark is just the bad guy.

[01:17:32] You know, so, you know, Batman's about Batman, about a regular guy becoming a superhero.

[01:17:37] Joker's just the bad guy that makes him have to do that.

[01:17:40] Right.

[01:17:40] So, you know, so to have a shark, a Jaws pinball machine, which is just a bit,

[01:17:45] you know, who did I tell?

[01:17:47] Somebody at Stern, I said, like it would be worthless to do Jaws because you,

[01:17:51] you know, it's shark is just a big, great tube.

[01:17:55] Like, how many different ways can you draw that?

[01:17:57] I feel like Stern should just like recreate the movie scenes, like Turkish Star Wars,

[01:18:01] where Gary is like Richard Dreyfus and he's like, we're going to need a lower bomb

[01:18:05] and he just keeps saying that over and over.

[01:18:07] See, we have to make Gary quint, so he eventually gets eaten by the shark.

[01:18:13] I mean, look, look, you know, Chris, I think everyone's excited to see you get back into the game.

[01:18:17] I mean, everyone would agree that your games are beautiful.

[01:18:20] I do appreciate that you're passionate, you're outspoken,

[01:18:24] because I think people relate to that and I think people appreciate that.

[01:18:28] And I know sometimes it might feel like it gets you into trouble.

[01:18:31] But, you know, it's, you know, I've always said there's nothing worse than being invisible.

[01:18:37] I like to, you know, I come from the days when, you know, there was no internet, you know,

[01:18:42] like, kiss could get away with wearing makeup and nobody knew who they really were.

[01:18:46] They couldn't get, you know, they couldn't get away without these days.

[01:18:50] You know, so that mystique of like having something untouchable and how frustrating it was.

[01:18:55] And, you know, not that I'm a big deal, but, you know, in the pinball industry, it's like,

[01:19:02] I like to meet people. I like to talk about what I do. I like to be visible,

[01:19:08] because that makes it more fun and more entertaining for me to be a part of, you know,

[01:19:13] that's why I wanted to do a podcast. That's why I'm, you know, always a guest at a show,

[01:19:17] because it gets a chance to, to, you know, hang out with these people and they're, you know,

[01:19:21] they're great people and it's big fun. So to sit back and, you know, put a gag around my mouth and,

[01:19:28] and just say, I'm just going to do my work and I'm going to go home. That's, that's not fun to me.

[01:19:33] Right. That's, you know, it has to be because it's side work.

[01:19:36] Pinball art is not my main job. I work for Zingha and I do, you know, I'm a senior care good designer.

[01:19:41] And that's what I do. So if, if, if I'm doing, if I'm spending my spare time doing this,

[01:19:47] it has to be worthwhile. Absolutely. And for those who want to see Chris's Willy Wonka,

[01:19:51] right, you did the Zingha game. Yeah, it's called World of Candy. Super cool. So let me,

[01:19:58] let me ask your question, because I have to be honest here, as the world's, maybe the,

[01:20:05] the, the baitable number one pinball podcast, your pinball podcast blows mine away with production

[01:20:10] value. Are we going to see you back in the podcast, Saddle, to give us more of you in Barlow,

[01:20:16] going around the play field. I'm going to say yes. I'm not going to say when, and I'm also going

[01:20:25] to say it's not going to be me alone. What happened with the old podcast with the Superduper extra

[01:20:32] awesome pinball show? You and Ed Ed Van der Vien. Yeah. Ed Van der Vien from Texas,

[01:20:37] pinball festival. He ended up running from mayor. And I told Ed, and, you know, and he's not an idiot.

[01:20:43] So he knew, you know, I'm like, you can't, we can't do some podcasts where we're swearing and

[01:20:47] talking about all those goofy shit and you're running for mayor. You know, so we just put it on

[01:20:53] the back burner and, you know, waited for that to float by. But unfortunately, he didn't win.

[01:20:58] But fortunately, the podcast now can live on. Yeah. So we just have to figure out, and another

[01:21:03] problem was, you know, working with Stern, you know, Stern's policy is sit down and shut up.

[01:21:11] So that doesn't exactly bow well for a podcast. So that kind of frustrated me to like,

[01:21:16] you know, what's our angle going to be? How can we pull this off, make it entertaining, make it

[01:21:20] truthful? But at the same time, you know, protect Stern's secrets and, you know, not say anything

[01:21:26] they don't want me to say and, you know, be handcuffed and like that. Now, now that's not the case.

[01:21:31] So I mean, that shows called Stern's insider pinball podcast. Yeah. You know, when a game comes

[01:21:37] out, I'd like to be able to say what I think about it without having, you know, if it's a Stern

[01:21:42] game, you know, well, you can't say it sucks. Right. Not that automatically does. I'm just saying,

[01:21:47] I'd like the ability to say, hey, this thing stinks or whatever. Yeah, or just give a balanced,

[01:21:53] you know, point of view on a game, which is not it. And there's no perfect game.

[01:21:58] Yeah, the only thing I can never do is give an opinion on anybody's heart because then I look

[01:22:01] like a dick, you know, if I say it sucks, they're going to be like, oh, you didn't get the job. So

[01:22:06] you're pissed. So we're creeps. Boohoo. So yeah. So that's, well,

[01:22:14] crazy looking forward, I'm looking forward to the future. I just want to, you know, I want to wrap

[01:22:18] up, you know, the whole story was Stern by saying that I'm really proud of the work that I did.

[01:22:26] You know, I'm not, I don't have anything against Stern. You know, everyone has no

[01:22:31] reasons for doing what they do. Why they kept me at arm's length. I don't know. But, you know,

[01:22:37] I'm grateful for the opportunity. I would not be here talking to you if it wasn't for them,

[01:22:41] you know, pulling me in to this world. And so I'm happy to be here and I have them to thank for that.

[01:22:47] Right. And, you know, so just moving on, looking forward to bigger and better things. And,

[01:22:54] yeah, I don't plan on leaving anytime soon because I enjoy it too much. Right. So,

[01:22:58] well, Chris, we really appreciate you taking the time and coming on. I think I speak on behalf

[01:23:02] of myself. And I know a lot of the people who listen to that. I think your artwork is phenomenal.

[01:23:06] And you've contributed a great deal to this industry, this hobby, both on a professional and a

[01:23:13] personal level. And, you know, like I think the experiences you've had at Stern is like in any big

[01:23:18] company and I'm working a big company, you've got people that are cool, people that are jerks. And

[01:23:22] there's a constant tug of war to just get something good out the door. And I think you got some

[01:23:27] of the best pinball artwork and art packages out the door for them. And some of the games have turned

[01:23:32] out to be really good. Some of them are amazing. Some of them are $25,000 for diamond edition,

[01:23:38] but still good games. But we look forward to seeing more of you in this hobby. And I look forward

[01:23:44] to seeing what you reveal at Expo. By the time people listen to this podcast, I will have seen it,

[01:23:50] but I'm going to be in Japan. And you're going to be, you know, signing tears,

[01:23:57] recovering from the next stuff. Yeah. So Chris, thank you so much for coming on. I really

[01:24:01] appreciate it. And we'll do this again soon if Ed can't get his act together anytime you want to

[01:24:04] come on and talk pinball. You know that this is an outlet for you. Yeah, we're going to steal that

[01:24:10] twoppy from you next year, buddy. Everybody's good. You may be a lot this year. I didn't think the

[01:24:14] stuff I didn't stop talking about it. The more I talk about it, I think the more votes I lose.

[01:24:18] So I think I just keep doing my stick and it might work out again.

[01:24:23] I came up with a little campaign for the monsters because people have forgotten it by now.

[01:24:28] You know, and you know, yeah, I'll be honest. I want a twippy too. So I came up with this little

[01:24:32] campaign and I used the Twippy logo for the new awards that nobody has seen yet. And I kept

[01:24:40] on telling Jeff I'm like, you got to reveal that logo because I want to put this little, you know,

[01:24:45] visual campaign out for the monsters for a twippy. And he's like, what's your hurry? And I'm like,

[01:24:50] what do you tell him? He goes, it's mid-October. And I'm like, yeah, but voting ends, you know, on

[01:24:56] New Year's day. And he goes, no, voting begins on New Year's day. And like, oh, that's right.

[01:25:00] Okay. So it's so it's so it's so ill timed because I mean, I get it, but it's tough because you

[01:25:09] have to include. Yeah. Well, this is what this is the thing is you can't let's say he started opening,

[01:25:15] he opened voting right now. It would be unfair to any game that might come out in another

[01:25:19] month and a half because it didn't have as much time to get as many votes. So he has to allow the

[01:25:24] year to expire for what games came out, you know, that there's just there's a lineup and let the

[01:25:29] voting begin. Unfortunately, I think it would know the awards would be a lot sooner if Texas wasn't

[01:25:35] so far out into March. I think the voting should end December 31st because like what really comes

[01:25:41] out in the last two weeks in December and Pimble, nothing. I love it when the voting does end and

[01:25:46] all the votes are sealed. It's it's like what like mid-January or end of January. You didn't have

[01:25:52] febbi, you can almost just mail it in then. And for from a podcasting standpoint, I could just

[01:25:56] become the biggest like idiot like just ranting and raving, but nothing you could do people vote

[01:26:01] to tally. But see, here's what we do though is you know, figure it out like if you hear about some

[01:26:07] you know, stories that the movie stars tell about going to awards and thus, you know, the awards

[01:26:13] company will call them up. You know, are you coming out to our show? Well, I don't know. Well,

[01:26:17] we really think you should come, you know, which is I have to be honest, Zach and Jeff,

[01:26:23] I tried every single way to like get a little, you know, to figure out which way it was leaning.

[01:26:29] And they wouldn't tell me anything. I was nervous when I was in there. And then, you know,

[01:26:34] hope, you know, thankfully, we got it. Anyway, Chris, I just I just I recently watched that the awards

[01:26:41] and was super impressed by your composer and super unimpressed at how much I failed at delivering

[01:26:48] that trophy stom-joke. Right. I mean, nothing's as bad as the the new Pimble,

[01:26:54] Crib's trying to act all gangster walking us through the house. I think that now takes

[01:26:58] the cake for humor that failed to connect. Zach's going to kill me. Wow. Yeah, I'm not saying

[01:27:05] anything. Zach's my buddy. I'm not sure he's going to kill me. I'll just say this. I don't know

[01:27:08] what you're talking about. I haven't seen it. All right. All right. Well, Chris, thank you so

[01:27:11] much for coming on. By the time people hear this, you will have enjoyed Expo. And I think people

[01:27:16] are really going to enjoy this interview. So hopefully we'll chat soon. All right. Sounds good,

[01:27:21] buddy. All right.
