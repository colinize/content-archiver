[00:00] Alright.

[00:01] Oh, yes!

[00:02] Metro Dango from Denmark, and my boy, Canada from New York City is back all again!

[00:10] Let's do this!

[00:11] Yeah, the birthplace of the mafia.

[00:15] I don't know if that's true.

[00:16] It's probably Sicily, but then they came here.

[00:18] Oh, yes, oh yes, oh yes.

[00:21] Chris finally, JJP, eight is out.

[00:24] What do you think, my friend?

[00:26] Well, I'm just glad it's out, right?

[00:28] I knew about this game for, what, a little over a year?

[00:31] It's confirmed it's not Harry Potter.

[00:33] All the Harry Potter fans are crying.

[00:35] I'm glad it's out.

[00:37] It's always fun to get a new pinball machine to analyze, to talk about, and now the speculation is over.

[00:42] So, super happy they got it out the door.

[00:45] Absolutely, man.

[00:46] You told us about this a year ago.

[00:50] You confirmed this a year ago.

[00:52] And thank you for that.

[00:53] And the game is finally out.

[00:57] Yeah.

[00:58] What was your first thoughts when you watched that one minute JJP clip?

[01:05] Yeah, no, I was like, it's very Italian, gaudy, ostentatious.

[01:12] I felt like I was walking in, you know, whether it's Trump Towers or an Italian restaurant, you know, I thought it was like, it was, it screamed red and gold and all this ornate stuff going on.

[01:26] And then my first reaction is like, wow, like this, and I will say, it wasn't what I was expecting because Godfather, I feel like is a little bit more subdued, a little bit more classy, like piano black and gold.

[01:40] So I don't know, I don't know.

[01:41] I was a little bit blown away by how vibrant it was.

[01:45] What about you?

[01:48] Let me tell you this way.

[01:52] I saw that first minute video and I was stunned.

[01:56] I thought it looked amazing.

[01:59] The music was amazing.

[02:01] I was just, I didn't expect this.

[02:03] I was just blown away, really enjoyed it.

[02:06] But I was constantly thinking, when is Zags video going to come out?

[02:12] Because we all know how it works with JJP.

[02:15] And then, I don't know, one hour later, Zags video hit the market and I'm telling you, I don't understand why JJP uses time and energy on their own one minute trailer.

[02:28] Just give everything to Zag, pay Zag a lot of money because that guy can just edit and put on a great show.

[02:35] It was about 25 minutes video and it was so enjoyable.

[02:41] I love the game, but I'm really angry at JJP.

[02:45] So I'm going to start with talking about that and then we can talk about the game.

[02:50] Is it okay with you?

[02:51] Yeah, before we move on, I just want to say from a marketing standpoint, the one minute sizzle video, you need that.

[02:59] Like no one's going to sit down.

[03:01] You can't casually send people a 20 minute video to, you know, deep dive into interviews with Keith and Eric.

[03:08] Like that sizzle video with the high polish is meant, you know, to be passed around Facebook to introduce this game to people for the first time.

[03:17] I think sometimes there's this, you know, people don't understand that a lot of people who buy these games are not on pin side.

[03:23] They're not on Facebook.

[03:24] They don't have 20 minutes to sit down and hear about the rule sets of the game.

[03:29] So I just want to say I'm more excited by the sizzle and the firework kind of stuff.

[03:35] And then then I just want to see the game played like I like streamed to buy someone who's playing it because the one thing I still don't feel we got after both the Zach video and, you know, the JJP video.

[03:47] I still have not seen what it's like to just play this game for five minutes.

[03:51] And they're already asking people for non refundable deposits.

[03:55] I have a big issue with that.

[03:56] We can talk about it later.

[03:57] But tell me what is bothering you about Jersey Jack pinball not sending you a collector's edition to Denmark.

[04:03] I just spoiled it.

[04:04] Yes, because yesterday we talked to each other and we talked few minutes.

[04:12] And as soon as we went into details, I said, stop, we don't we can't talk about this stuff.

[04:19] We have to have it on a proper way on a video.

[04:24] So I don't know your thoughts about this game.

[04:27] You don't know mine yet.

[04:29] So we have this genuine video telling everything.

[04:33] I heard by another content creator that you made three or four shows about this game.

[04:40] I live shows.

[04:42] I didn't watch them.

[04:44] So I don't know what your thoughts are.

[04:46] And I think this is the best way to to interact.

[04:49] Yeah, let's get let's get into it.

[04:51] What's up?

[04:52] So what's up?

[04:53] Yeah, the issue with the preamble.

[04:55] No one needs this.

[04:56] Edit that out.

[04:57] No, you should keep it and people will be like, Jeng is stop rambling.

[05:00] Go on.

[05:01] My my issue is I love this theme.

[05:05] I love this theme.

[05:06] I love the movies.

[05:07] I love everything about it.

[05:09] And I want the C version.

[05:11] Okay, absolutely the C version and JJP won't send C to Denmark.

[05:16] So why why why?

[05:19] I can't tell you why.

[05:23] What does it make sense?

[05:24] What do you mean?

[05:25] You can't say why like because of my bro is a distro here.

[05:30] So nobody so nobody in Denmark can get a C.

[05:34] Oh, no one.

[05:36] No, not my brother.

[05:38] He puts out these games in the biggest showroom here in Scandinavia where

[05:43] everybody can check it out, enjoy it and play it.

[05:46] But no C to us.

[05:48] They did exactly the same thing when G and R came out all the at least we want

[05:54] but no C.

[05:56] I this pin.

[05:57] Look at this pin.

[05:59] You can't buy the limited edition of Godfather.

[06:03] Just look at how the C looks man.

[06:07] I love all the gold.

[06:09] I love Don Vito Corleone.

[06:11] I love everything about it.

[06:13] And the early looks like a stern pro with that black armor.

[06:18] No, it doesn't.

[06:19] No, yeah.

[06:20] There's nothing.

[06:21] There's nothing like gold.

[06:22] No, nothing.

[06:23] Like the C looks really nice.

[06:25] It looks what you know the top or the armor.

[06:27] But the Ellie is not like Baron.

[06:30] You're not missing anything when you're standing over the game playing.

[06:34] And actually in the Ellie's defense, which I rarely do and I would not buy an

[06:39] Ellie by the way, because I think they're going to just lie because they announced

[06:42] they're making 5000, which is stupid.

[06:44] But in the Ellie's, I actually like the Ellie's sculpt of the mobster in the up

[06:49] the middle.

[06:50] There are two different sculpts.

[06:51] You notice that the one of the CE guy guys wearing a hat.

[06:54] I still think both sculpts look a little bit like Bugs Bunny mobsters from

[06:58] Looney Tunes.

[06:59] But we don't know about that because I think they tried something here with,

[07:03] you know, trying to recreate human beings as pinball sculpts.

[07:08] And it's hard to do that.

[07:09] Like we see it with like Incredible Hulk or Scooby Doo.

[07:11] But when you try to make a human look authentic to what they look like in the

[07:16] movie, it can easily get very cartoony and can't be looking, which I think is

[07:21] happening here.

[07:22] So like, all right.

[07:23] So you love the look of the game.

[07:24] You love the God-ing-ness.

[07:25] Yeah.

[07:26] You saw the videos.

[07:27] Like, do you think we've seen enough though to buy it already?

[07:32] Well, I'm a huge audio guy.

[07:37] I need to have the audio experience.

[07:40] I need to know about the audio package.

[07:42] It's, I know, I know where Naps Arcade, he has written some info about it.

[07:48] I know in that interview, he tells about the audio part is amazing, but it's

[07:52] just so important to me and not knowing about how the audio package under

[07:57] gameplay is, is a huge miss for me.

[08:01] The reason why I really like this, why I want to spend 15,000, it's about 20,000

[08:08] here in Denmark with...

[08:09] Yeah, but, but, but, Jeng, let me, let me cut you off real quick.

[08:11] Yeah.

[08:12] You're an audiophile.

[08:13] Well, we're expecting from music and Godfather, bro.

[08:16] There's like one theme song and what else?

[08:18] Like, this is in, what are you expecting to be hit with?

[08:21] Exactly.

[08:22] They come around the theme song all the time.

[08:25] It's, it's, it's not going to be like this month.

[08:27] I mean, it's not going to be one tune all the time.

[08:30] I want to listen to what's inside.

[08:33] What are you listening to when you start a game, when you play, when you go into

[08:36] multiple, what's going on?

[08:38] Okay.

[08:39] So you don't, so you don't know what that's going to be.

[08:41] No.

[08:42] But you still want to buy one, but you still want to buy it.

[08:45] Yes.

[08:46] That's because the theme is just so cool.

[08:49] I love the theme.

[08:51] And if you ask me the best designer that can integrate a theme is just Eric

[08:57] Minier.

[08:58] That's, that's okay.

[08:59] Let me, let me, yeah, let me ask you some questions because, you know, theme

[09:03] integration is something I harp on about a lot.

[09:06] Yeah.

[09:07] Where are you seeing the Godfather movie integrated into the design of the

[09:11] game?

[09:12] The reason I'm so much in love with the C version is when we see those two

[09:19] different cabinets.

[09:21] Yeah.

[09:22] I mean the C with golden lion and gold armor, everything gold.

[09:29] It looks so cool.

[09:31] So what's outside the glass is really where you're seeing that.

[09:34] Okay.

[09:35] That's great.

[09:36] What, what it's, it's a great design.

[09:39] Yeah.

[09:40] That's great.

[09:41] What it, what it's a pin I can have as a one pin in the corner of my living room.

[09:47] But it's not a piece of furniture.

[09:49] It's a pinball.

[09:50] But I'm saying what from the movies when you look underneath the glass.

[09:55] Oh, what are you seeing?

[09:57] Okay.

[09:58] So like, okay, let me, you know, I don't know when I think of theme

[10:00] integration, I think, oh, you've got the rocking ship from the black pearl.

[10:03] You've got the whirlpool from the movie.

[10:05] You've got slimer.

[10:07] You've got a Godzilla bridge and building.

[10:10] You've got a T-Rex in Jurassic Park.

[10:13] That's integrating the theme into the physical game.

[10:17] What in this game from a design standpoint is integrating the Godfather,

[10:23] which you love the movie into pinball format.

[10:27] Chris.

[10:29] No, this is why it's, this is why it's a really, it's really tough theme for pinball.

[10:34] I'm not saying, I don't know what you would do to be honest.

[10:37] Like, would you have like the car that his wife gets, you know, the car bomb explodes?

[10:41] Do you have the horse head?

[10:43] Do you have Don Corleone's office?

[10:45] Like, that's why as a theme, it's like no one's seeing what's not in the game

[10:51] that they want it to be in the game because it's such a weird theme to

[10:55] integrate into pinball.

[10:56] And so that's why I think people are kind of really kind to it because

[11:00] they're not missing something they want it to see.

[11:02] Like when we see Toy Story, we're like, it's missing the claw.

[11:05] It's missing Buzz Lightyear and Woody and the Army men and like the Etch-a-Sketch.

[11:11] It's missing everything we loved about Toy Story one, right?

[11:14] Nobody wanted just like four.

[11:17] But I think when you see Godfather, nothing's not there that you want it to be there

[11:22] because we can't even imagine what we want it there.

[11:25] And I think that's why I was just wanting to ask you,

[11:27] what would you want to see integrated?

[11:29] You're just like the cabinet legs, Chris.

[11:33] But Chris, something, you know, something has happened at JJP.

[11:40] JJP as a company is not the same company that made Pirates.

[11:45] Yeah.

[11:46] And do you mean that in a good way or in a good way or a bad way?

[11:48] I don't know what you mean by that, though.

[11:50] In a very bad way.

[11:51] When you mention Pirates, Pirates, I mean, that's just theme integration.

[11:55] Everything is just, it's filled up.

[11:57] It's so cool.

[11:58] It's stuff that we just love.

[12:00] Yeah.

[12:01] But as you mentioned, Toy Story, everything was ripped out.

[12:05] Everything was just off and that game was off.

[12:07] Audio package was off.

[12:08] Everything was off.

[12:09] Yeah.

[12:10] But this one has got a little bit more in it than the Toy Story.

[12:15] It's not empty like Toy Story.

[12:17] It has got, you know, it has got the horse's head.

[12:19] It has got the water fountain at the Pop-Amber.

[12:22] It has got Don Corleone sculpture.

[12:24] You talked about the sculptures.

[12:26] I like the sculptures.

[12:27] They're fine, but I think I feel like the size of the sculptures,

[12:33] they're just so much, look at how little Don Corleone is next to the mob guy,

[12:38] next to him.

[12:39] I mean, it's all proportions.

[12:41] Well, I mean, like sculptures are always at a proportion, you know?

[12:46] It's two guys so close to each other.

[12:49] Yeah, it's fine.

[12:50] It's fine.

[12:51] Like I don't have an issue with that.

[12:52] So, like, you know, the fountain would be the size of eight pinball machines,

[12:56] you know, went to scale.

[12:58] You know, I mean, look, it's, it's, when you talk about Jersey Jack,

[13:03] and I think it's an interesting discussion because I was a little worried

[13:06] that this game would be built during the Pat Lawler era in which he was yanking

[13:10] stuff out.

[13:11] And I do think that Pat was still the creative director when this game was

[13:16] made.

[13:17] It definitely looks like the bomb on this game is nowhere near what it was on

[13:21] games like Pirates.

[13:22] And look, I'm going to play Devil's Advocate.

[13:24] There's a lot of people out there who remember the Jersey Jack period when

[13:28] they were loading these games up.

[13:29] They were highly problematic.

[13:31] Operators didn't want them.

[13:33] Games were breaking down left and right.

[13:35] The more you put in, the more issues you might have.

[13:39] And, and I think, you know, they were trying to find that middle ground where

[13:43] we still want to give more than stern, but we can't have a game that's impossible

[13:48] for our people to build because it's too complex.

[13:50] That's going to break down all the time.

[13:52] And then we've got nothing but complaints, you know, coming in from both, you know,

[13:56] homeowners and operators.

[13:57] So I think they've been trying to find that middle ground.

[14:00] And I would say this, like toy story, we all know, right?

[14:04] We're not, we're not going to go down that road.

[14:06] But here's my thing with like looking at the stream so far of Godfather

[14:10] yesterday, I haven't really seen anything in the game like mechanically yet.

[14:15] That's like kind of blowing my mind like we saw with the T-Rex or the

[14:19] Godzilla building.

[14:21] And I will, you know, everyone's talking about the 29 ball pathways and the

[14:26] diverters, you know, and ripping them spinners is the new Mech and Pinball

[14:30] these days.

[14:31] But I will say this, all the diverters in the world and all the different pathways,

[14:35] the Duke Kaboom jump, I like stuff like that.

[14:39] You know, not that I don't love toy story, but I think it's more fun to jump a ball

[14:43] from the lower part of the play field to the upper part than it is to just always

[14:48] get diverted in different ways.

[14:49] Now look, different strokes for different folks.

[14:51] But I think we need to see, we need to see Godfather though.

[14:55] I need to see the way it all works, how fast this is.

[14:57] Because the other part, when I watched the video, I thought it looked slow.

[15:01] But then I hear from people who played it and they say it's fast and this will be

[15:06] settled when they stream the game.

[15:08] It's not going to be settled by watching any of the content we have so far.

[15:12] Have they mentioned when they will stream it?

[15:16] Well, look, people have it.

[15:17] Like people are getting the games.

[15:18] Like they're that distributor in, I think it's in France.

[15:21] They just unboxed one in England.

[15:23] So this game is being picked up at Jersey Jack Pinball today.

[15:27] They built a hundred.

[15:29] So we are going to see streams of this game any minute now, which is good.

[15:34] And I also think people should wait to see that before they order the game.

[15:38] That's my big thing in 2023.

[15:41] Wait and see people.

[15:42] You're going to be able to get one.

[15:44] Unless only Genghis can't get a CE.

[15:46] Everyone else will be able to get a CE.

[15:48] I don't want the LE.

[15:51] That's my issue.

[15:52] Let's talk about that.

[15:53] Let's talk about their LE and CE pricing, which remains the same as Toy Story.

[15:57] Do you think it's like a mistake?

[15:59] Should they have adjusted it based on the Toy Story feedback?

[16:02] What do you think?

[16:03] Well, Toy Story sales were just, it just went down the toilet.

[16:09] I think they should have adjusted a bit down.

[16:12] But as I'm hearing right now, the CE's are gone.

[16:16] I don't know if it's true.

[16:17] No, they're not.

[16:18] They're for sale right now on Jersey Jack's website.

[16:20] So who told you that?

[16:22] Because if you're going to make a statement like that and not even check JerseyJack.com right now,

[16:26] you're just making stuff up.

[16:28] No, no, no.

[16:29] I haven't checked their page.

[16:31] When I'm scrolling on my phone, watching different Facebook groups,

[16:37] a lot of distros, they are, they have their, I don't want to say spamming.

[16:42] They are, what's it called?

[16:44] Advertising for sale.

[16:46] And a lot of them, they're writing by this game today, LE version CE gone.

[16:52] Right, right.

[16:53] Multiple distros are writing that.

[16:56] So that's what I heard.

[16:58] Here's what I heard.

[16:59] And again, this is just rumor.

[17:00] I hear Jersey Jack might be holding back more CE's than they did last time.

[17:04] And so like, who knows?

[17:06] I mean, they make more money when they sell them directly.

[17:09] I have a hard time believing that a thousand of these sold at 15 K.

[17:15] Can you hear the fire alarm going off by the way?

[17:17] Like it's going off.

[17:18] Okay.

[17:19] I hear it.

[17:20] Typical New York.

[17:21] Yeah, no, I don't know what I'm going to do this.

[17:23] Like I'm going to try to not go out and listen to the fire safety protocol.

[17:28] Okay.

[17:30] Great.

[17:32] So no audio, no gameplay, no nothing.

[17:34] Okay.

[17:35] So I watched this gameplay video and I watched the coders.

[17:41] Keith, he was talking about his multiples, multiples, multiples.

[17:45] Please don't ruin this game with multiple heavy stuff.

[17:49] But one thing at the back glass, there was this little text that said this mode is going

[17:56] on.

[17:57] And then on that text, it said avoid red and blue shots.

[18:03] Shoot blinking lights, avoid red and blue shots.

[18:06] That's the worst thing you can do in a pimple machine.

[18:11] Just like on the Pimple Brothers aliens.

[18:14] I was in a mission and you don't look at the back glass when you play 99% doesn't look

[18:20] at the back glass.

[18:21] We're looking directly down on the play field.

[18:24] This light is blinking and I want to shoot that on a Jersey Jack game.

[18:29] Blue light is blinking in different multiple lights and then I have to avoid red and blue

[18:34] shots.

[18:35] Yeah.

[18:36] Why not?

[18:37] Watches this and removes all BS like that.

[18:41] I don't understand.

[18:43] I hate stuff like that.

[18:45] Why?

[18:46] Why?

[18:47] If this is programmed by a gamer that plays Pimple, this is made by a programmer.

[18:52] Okay.

[18:53] He just, he wants to make some difficult software programming.

[18:57] But a real key thing would never allow something like this.

[19:02] Real gamers doesn't look at the back glass.

[19:05] I can't.

[19:06] No, but like, no, but it's like, but here's the thing.

[19:08] Everyone who owns a Jersey Jack machine, first of all, I disagree with you that avoiding

[19:12] shots isn't a fun thing to code into a game.

[19:15] It is secondarily.

[19:17] Secondarily, secondarily.

[19:21] Jersey Jack owners are not like stern owners.

[19:25] The rule sets in their games are way more complex.

[19:28] The only way to enjoy a Jersey Jack machine is if you really learn the rule set.

[19:34] So you will learn in that mode that that's what those lights mean.

[19:38] And then you won't even have to look up at the back glass or the Translight, you know,

[19:42] or the LCD.

[19:43] And that's the key to all Jersey Jack enjoyment.

[19:46] And I think it's, it's debatable whether or not they make their games too complex and

[19:52] have a learning curve.

[19:53] But I think for the Jersey Jack fanboys, I know they get off on this stuff.

[19:58] They love the deep rule sets.

[20:00] And so they really, really, really don't have a problem with it.

[20:04] So I just want to say I don't agree with you.

[20:07] I think that can be a fun mode.

[20:08] And I think it's too early to say they need to re-yank that out of the game.

[20:12] And also, we know, by the way, Jersey Jack people never finishes their code.

[20:16] So get ready.

[20:17] If you're a guns and roses owner, where's the final code?

[20:19] If you're a pirate owner, yours go by.

[20:21] Years go by.

[20:22] And they don't, they don't, they, and it kind of annoys me about that.

[20:27] It's like, what else are you working on guys?

[20:29] Finish these codes.

[20:30] Yeah.

[20:31] Yeah.

[20:32] That's just a fair point, man.

[20:33] But I don't understand why they don't finish these codes because when Eric Minier was talking

[20:38] about 16 LEDs in that fountain and he used different molding stuff and blah, blah, blah.

[20:44] I feel like this guy had three years making this.

[20:49] How boring.

[20:50] How boring.

[20:51] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Eric finished this game.

[20:55] So much time.

[20:56] No, no, no, he's, look, Eric probably made this game.

[20:59] How the oldest is from 2020, right?

[21:01] Yeah, but you have to understand he finished guns and roses a good year before it came out.

[21:06] He's finished this game a good year before it came out.

[21:09] He's already, I would assume 80% through his next game if it's not already done.

[21:14] He's very prolific.

[21:16] He's very efficient.

[21:17] Jersey Jack pinballs launches are so delayed that they're probably way ahead of schedule

[21:24] on R&D and development of future titles because of that.

[21:28] Now I also fully expect.

[21:29] But it must be boring.

[21:31] Come on.

[21:32] Yeah, I think I just imagine I never understand, you know, what happens on a random Wednesday

[21:40] in a pinball company when you know your game is three years away.

[21:44] Right.

[21:45] So what are you talking about?

[21:46] Talk about a job in which you might be able to just like coast a few weeks and no one's

[21:49] really noticing.

[21:50] Hey, Eric, how's, how's avatar two coming along?

[21:53] Yeah, man, cool.

[21:54] Like we just spent 40 hours like getting the diverter to like, you know, work properly.

[21:59] Like how is he even like, you know, I don't know.

[22:02] And I imagine Steve Ritchie is really anxious to get his game out.

[22:06] I think we're going to see Ritchie's game at the end of the year.

[22:09] Oh, I think we're going to finally see two Jersey Jack new games in one year.

[22:14] Oh, that could be so cool.

[22:16] And I hope so.

[22:17] But I don't think so.

[22:20] I don't think so.

[22:21] You know how was it last year they said two games a year or was it the year before?

[22:26] Well, Jack's been saying it every year for like seven years now.

[22:29] Okay, that's true.

[22:31] Well, well, there you go.

[22:33] There we go.

[22:34] Well, on the play field, the, the CE version has got glitter and all that pretty, pretty

[22:42] stuff that, that, that we all love.

[22:44] But it also have Don Vito Corleone down at the flippers.

[22:50] It looks so, so, so I'm so happy with their, their having two different artworks for these games.

[22:58] They're not just standard play fields.

[23:00] So it's not just the external.

[23:02] It's not just only the cabinet, the play field.

[23:06] They always do that though.

[23:08] Jersey Jack always switches up the play field art between the Ellie and the CE.

[23:11] They give you more, like they give you more between models than Stern does on a premium and an Ellie.

[23:17] They absolutely do.

[23:19] Another reason to get the CE.

[23:22] I mean, yeah, but here's the, here's the hard part, man.

[23:25] And I've been hearing people like this, this has been, you know,

[23:28] Canada is the bad guy in the hobby.

[23:29] I don't mind taking the arrows in the back.

[23:31] Why?

[23:32] I'm hearing, I'm hearing everybody being like, game's amazing, instant classic, Eric killed it.

[23:36] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[23:37] Everyone's like praising, praising, praising.

[23:38] And then like, while you're buying one like, no, wait, man, 15,000.

[23:40] It's too much.

[23:41] It's like, it's like, it's not, and here's the thing.

[23:44] And I mean this when, when something is out of your price range, it's a lot easier to enjoy it.

[23:51] I love Lamborghini and Ferrari.

[23:53] You know why?

[23:54] Cause I never have to make the decision on whether or not I should buy one and, and, and it's really easy.

[23:59] You don't know, man.

[24:00] You don't know brother.

[24:01] No, but it's really easy to appreciate things when you know you're not going to have to make the stressful decision whether or not to financially pull the trigger.

[24:09] On it.

[24:10] And I think that's why a lot of people, they had low expectations of the game.

[24:14] Yeah.

[24:15] It didn't come in looking like Thunderbirds, right?

[24:17] And it's like, it works.

[24:18] The game, the game looks fine.

[24:20] It's fine.

[24:21] It's everything about it.

[24:22] Nothing is like, but no one really cared that much.

[24:24] It doesn't offend anybody.

[24:26] And I think a lot of people just are not going to buy it, but they can appreciate what Eric did.

[24:31] And I, and I actually like that.

[24:32] I think we need to get back to this period where we can celebrate something but not run to buy it.

[24:38] And at these prices, it's not even if Canada's feedback making people behave that way.

[24:43] It's just everyone is feeling financially strapped.

[24:47] Like if you just bought a Scooby-Doo and Foo Fighter and this game, let's think about if you bought all three games in their top trim.

[24:54] Okay.

[24:55] Yeah.

[24:56] You bought a Scooby-Doo with butter cabinet fully loaded.

[24:58] If you bought a James Bond and you bought a Godfather's CE.

[25:01] Let's add that up right now.

[25:03] James Bond 16th?

[25:04] No, no, I won't even talk about that one.

[25:06] Okay.

[25:07] 13 five for Scooby-Doo with butter cabinet with tax to your door.

[25:11] 13 five.

[25:12] James Bond would be 14 five.

[25:14] And then, okay, so what is that?

[25:16] That's 27 $28,000 28 plus 16 five for Godfather with tax and shipping.

[25:25] Yeah.

[25:26] What is that?

[25:27] $37,000 $38,000.

[25:30] No, it's more than that.

[25:31] It's like 43,000.

[25:34] Like it's absolutely.

[25:35] And I have to pay 25% on top of that.

[25:39] On top of that.

[25:40] So what is going to happen now is at these prices where people used to buy two machines,

[25:45] they're going to buy one where people used to buy one, they're not going to buy any.

[25:49] They're going to wait for it to be maybe used and they're going to like just enjoy what

[25:53] they have.

[25:54] And I think, you know, it's, it's an interesting, it's a buyer's market.

[25:57] And I keep saying it like instantly it's flipped like the FOMO day one sellouts are not going

[26:03] to happen unless you have something as powerful as a back to the future license or an Indiana

[26:08] Jones or a matrix stuff like Godfather will never sell 1000 at 15 K a pop instantly.

[26:16] But have you seen all the Facebook groups, pimple sales groups?

[26:23] Oh my God.

[26:24] I don't know.

[26:25] Well, it's a combination of Foo Fighters and this game.

[26:29] So many pinball machines are out for sale this week.

[26:33] It's only bias market.

[26:35] Yeah, because, because people have to make room, not only room, they need to free up

[26:41] capital capital.

[26:42] And I don't know, maybe I'm wrong and I don't, and I'm the poorest, sorry, the poorest man

[26:48] in America.

[26:50] But unless you're like making a million dollars a year, you are not throwing down $30,000

[26:57] on pinball machines in one month.

[27:00] And there's just no way.

[27:02] And you know, you might have money saved up.

[27:04] And again, you might want to do that.

[27:05] You might see the value in it.

[27:07] But I think a lot of people, you know, they're just gonna, they're gonna wait.

[27:12] And as more games go on the used market, more deals will be had.

[27:16] And this is going to be an interesting test because Toy Story flopped for other reasons.

[27:19] It flopped because nobody wanted Toy Story 4 and it was empty.

[27:24] Godfather's, I think, a real good test because it's arguably much more in it than Toy Story.

[27:30] It's not as offensive to people who love the theme.

[27:33] We'll see what happens, right?

[27:34] We'll see what happens.

[27:35] How long will Foo Fighter hype last?

[27:37] I think it looks great.

[27:39] What do you think?

[27:40] What looks better?

[27:41] Foo Fighters or this?

[27:42] Oh.

[27:48] Looks or what I want.

[27:51] Looks better from an aesthetic standpoint.

[27:54] Looks, it's Godfather CE.

[27:58] Yeah.

[27:59] Epidically.

[28:00] Because I love all the gold.

[28:02] I love Don Corleone.

[28:03] I love all that.

[28:04] But the game that I want, the game that I want to play, it's 100% Foo Fighters.

[28:11] Because I'm a real stern playing like guy, stern code, stern flipper, stern everything.

[28:18] I love that stuff.

[28:21] But this is not a bad game and I would unbox it if they will send a couple of C's to Denmark.

[28:28] I will unbox it and show everything.

[28:30] And I can't share all the details why and I think those details are just so idiotic details.

[28:36] I'm so sorry.

[28:37] But I feel like Eric, when I watch that video, he explained you have to do all the different tasks, really deep code everything.

[28:47] And then at the end, you have to kiss the ring.

[28:49] It was so cool and I was so engaged.

[28:51] I was like, I want this called my bro here in Denmark.

[28:55] Jay, I want this.

[28:56] And he said no C's to Denmark again.

[28:59] Now, have you guys ever got C's?

[29:02] Oh, we have got Pirate C's here.

[29:05] We have got on our show, his showroom.

[29:09] He has got Willy Wonka CE or Willy Wonka CE with all that light underneath.

[29:15] So why, like, why can't you tell us?

[29:17] I mean, is it really like a weird reason or are you going to burn your relationship?

[29:22] That's distro info that, I mean, you know how I am.

[29:26] When I share nothing, I'm just cold.

[29:29] Yeah, I mean, look, it's, well, if anyone at Jersey Jack Pinball is listening to this, you have a CE sold in Denmark if you want to actualize that sale too.

[29:40] True today, yes.

[29:41] Well, look, man, I think it's a good day.

[29:44] What do you think?

[29:45] I think I've seen this show, which has been fun.

[29:47] I love your enthusiasm.

[29:48] American Pinball.

[29:50] What are they doing?

[29:52] Can they, can they follow all of these games and find buyers?

[29:59] They're too laid out, man.

[30:01] They're, okay, let's just, let's be honest.

[30:05] Everybody has seen the pictures.

[30:07] Everybody knows how it looks.

[30:08] Okay, we don't have to hide.

[30:09] That's not true.

[30:10] That's not true.

[30:11] I think you're absolutely wrong.

[30:12] I think 99% of people watching this will not have seen.

[30:15] But anyway, having seen it, what do you think is going to happen?

[30:18] Do they have enough in that game to get buyers away from who fighters, Godfather, final, final resistance?

[30:27] I don't know if we, if we should talk about the game when it's not out.

[30:33] I don't know.

[30:35] We're not talking about the game.

[30:36] I'm asking you, do you think American Pinball waited too long?

[30:40] And do you think?

[30:41] Oh, absolutely.

[30:42] I mean, absolutely.

[30:44] And with all these non-refundable BS that Stern is not non-refundable yet.

[30:51] But I mean, they're just so laid out to the game.

[30:55] And they should release what?

[30:58] This one.

[30:59] Right.

[31:00] Yeah.

[31:01] I know that David Fix is releasing this Saturday before TPF, which is next Saturday, not this one.

[31:08] Okay.

[31:09] So they're mailing games to different locations, so they will have it for play.

[31:12] It will be at Jack Bar in New York City.

[31:14] I will get to play it.

[31:15] This is the other thing I'm a little sad about Godfather Prices is a lot of operators are not buying these games at these prices now.

[31:22] So in all of New York City, there is nowhere for me to play Scooby-Doo.

[31:27] There's nowhere for me to play Godfather.

[31:30] I'm not sure maybe Sunshine Laundromat is putting them out, but I'm hearing from more operators too.

[31:35] They're priced out.

[31:36] Think about it.

[31:37] If you buy a $12,000 Godfather, you're starting out 6,000 plays behind someone who buys a Stern Pro.

[31:48] Yeah.

[31:49] 6,000.

[31:50] Yeah.

[31:51] Yeah.

[31:52] Absolutely.

[31:53] No brainer.

[31:54] No brainer.

[31:55] So Jack Bar bought American Pinball and they didn't buy Scooby-Doo and Godfather?

[32:02] I think David Fix is sending him one.

[32:05] I don't think he even has to buy it.

[32:07] I think it's just, you know, it'll be put out as a marketing and promotional item.

[32:12] Oh, okay.

[32:13] Yeah.

[32:14] And he doesn't want to buy the Godfather?

[32:17] He didn't buy Scooby-Doo.

[32:18] He's not buying Godfather a $12,000, I don't think.

[32:21] Because of the price?

[32:23] Yeah, it's the price.

[32:24] It's the price.

[32:25] It's the price.

[32:26] Also, if you look at the underside of that play field, it's just not the best game to...

[32:31] So, here's the thing, when you look at a Jersey Jack game, and I was telling my friend Derek

[32:37] this, who loves Jersey Jack, he loves the deep rule sets, he loves all this stuff, you can't

[32:42] enjoy a Jersey Jack game on location other than really guns and roses.

[32:49] And because guns and roses is like, you know, it's like you're playing a jukebox and you

[32:52] get right into the song.

[32:54] But the other machines, the rule sets, maybe, sorry, maybe Toy Story because it's simpler,

[33:00] but a complex rule set or a deep one, like Godfather, you're really going to have to

[33:05] play it in a home environment, understand it.

[33:09] You can already see it by all this stuff happening on the LCD, that's way too much to absorb.

[33:14] And then look at, like, Foo Fighters, how simple it is, like their animations, all of it's like,

[33:18] it's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon.

[33:20] That's what most people think about when they think about what should be on a pinball screen.

[33:24] And, you know, I see Jersey Jack's doing it again, like Hobbit-like, where there's like

[33:28] four or five different windows and you got to, and again, for the Neo Fight, like me,

[33:34] it's overwhelming and it turns me off for the nerds who love that stuff.

[33:39] Because I always say Jersey Jack Pinball is like role-playing games of video games.

[33:43] They're like a role-playing game.

[33:44] Like you didn't go to the arcade to play Final Fantasy or Zelda, you went to the arcade to

[33:48] play Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.

[33:50] And I think Pinball needs to be a little bit more like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.

[33:55] And you can get deeper into it, but, you know, it doesn't need to be too complex.

[33:59] So that's why I think a lot of operators are like, if I want to make money,

[34:03] I'm not going to put Godfather Pinball in my location.

[34:07] I've put a Scooby Freakin' Dew.

[34:09] No, not a Scooby Dew.

[34:12] Are you crazy with all the mechanical issues they're having?

[34:16] That's a topic for another time.

[34:18] Jeng is always a pleasure.

[34:20] I hope you get your Godfather CE.

[34:22] Come on, Jen and Jack and Appas.

[34:24] Come on, we've got billionaires over there.

[34:26] They can afford to...

[34:27] Come on, guys.

[34:28] You'll pay for the freight, right?

[34:29] If you direct freight it, will you pay it?

[34:31] We just take it by air so we could have it in, you know.

[34:35] There it is.

[34:36] We'll have it tomorrow.

[34:37] There we go.

[34:38] Let's do it.

[34:39] Let's do it.

[34:40] Get this man his CE.

[34:41] Maybe this will help.

[34:42] Yeah, I'm doing an unboxing video, man.

[34:43] That's it.

[34:44] That's it.

[34:45] See you, buddy.

[34:46] Have a great day out there.

[34:47] Bye.

[34:48] Bye.
