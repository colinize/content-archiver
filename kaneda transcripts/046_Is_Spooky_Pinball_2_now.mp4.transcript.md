[00:00] Oh, it's gonna work.

[00:01] Now we're working.

[00:02] We're back.

[00:04] Oh, you know, it's just, it's never a dull moment.

[00:07] It's never a dull moment in the world

[00:09] of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:20] Join us, join.

[00:24] Now, chat and spooky.

[00:30] It's always a work in progress

[00:32] when it comes to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:34] All right.

[00:35] So we're back here.

[00:37] We're gonna drop this into the stream.

[00:40] It is what it is, you know?

[00:42] Sometimes you get it right.

[00:44] Sometimes you get it wrong.

[00:46] God, it's like, I have so many windows open.

[00:49] I'm surprised this computer even works.

[00:51] I'm surprised this computer,

[00:53] I'm surprised this computer,

[00:54] I'm surprised this computer,

[00:55] I'm surprised this computer,

[00:56] I'm surprised this computer,

[00:57] I'm surprised this computer,

[00:58] I'm surprised this computer,

[00:59] this computer even works.

[01:04] Go here.

[01:06] Boom.

[01:09] Now I'm going back in here.

[01:11] Got a kid.

[01:12] So this thing out.

[01:13] Can I just change the link?

[01:14] Let's see if I can just change the link.

[01:16] Edit post.

[01:20] Yeah, let's just change the link.

[01:23] I think that's the right link.

[01:27] All right.

[01:28] Nobody's found it.

[01:29] Three people have found it.

[01:30] Oh.

[01:32] Oh, maybe I should go turn my soup off and just talk spooky first.

[01:38] I, you know, these unprob two things.

[01:42] They don't really work.

[01:43] It's more fun when I just do them scheduled.

[01:45] But, you know, this one's open to everybody.

[01:48] But I don't know.

[01:50] Let's see.

[01:51] All right.

[01:52] It's all working.

[01:53] We're now functioning.

[01:54] All right.

[01:55] So the week is about to get really interesting.

[01:57] You know, you've got Jersey Jack and American Bimble

[02:01] went to IOPPA with no new games.

[02:11] You know, and no new games at IOPPA.

[02:15] And, you know, so it's like, okay.

[02:18] So you didn't, you didn't really do anything to get any more money.

[02:22] Like, no one's seeing what any company that went to IOPPA is doing.

[02:27] That is not going to generate a single sale.

[02:31] Spooky's going to reveal evil dead one and two tomorrow.

[02:36] It's going to be one game, not two games, but evil dead one and two.

[02:40] And they're going to have the full reveal on Friday.

[02:45] If they're smart, the order banks open up on Friday.

[02:50] And I just want to say this.

[02:52] I just do, I think that this company is now number two in Pimble.

[02:58] I don't mean by volume, right?

[03:01] I don't mean by volume.

[03:02] I just mean they've made like 10 games now or more.

[03:07] They're integrating the themes in the right way.

[03:11] And the game's going to have more toys in it than Avatar, Godfather,

[03:17] and probably Elton John combined.

[03:20] At some point,

[03:23] this company is sort of just giving people what they want in Pimble,

[03:28] except for the themes.

[03:30] Like, they still don't have the themes that have the mass appeal.

[03:37] They're going to get there.

[03:39] I think they've got some stuff coming that has more mass appeal.

[03:42] I still think, you know what, you know, it's crazy to me.

[03:46] Is that Rick and Morty remains like just a turd of a game?

[03:50] I'm sorry, but like the design on that game is just horrendous.

[03:54] And I wish they could remake Rick and Morty knowing now what they know now.

[03:59] Right?

[04:00] Knowing how they can build a game now, knowing the mix they can put into a game.

[04:03] The fact that Rick and Morty, which really was just a reskin TNA 2.0,

[04:08] I just think they should make an all new Rick and Morty game.

[04:11] I mean, it's killer that they legitimately can't make more Rick and Morty's.

[04:18] Goonies would have been a better sale.

[04:21] Of course, Goonies would be a better sale than Evil Dead 1 and 2.

[04:24] Evil Dead 1 and 2 gang is a sea theme.

[04:27] It is not a B theme.

[04:29] It's a sea theme, like at best.

[04:34] But it's campy, it's weird.

[04:38] I don't think this is the big, big, big one over at spooky.

[04:46] But I do love the fact that the games they make based on the themes they make

[04:55] are now going to be loaded, have great artwork with Franchie.

[05:00] They're going to have clips from these movies synced up with the voices.

[05:06] I'm going to use Campbell's going to do the callouts.

[05:09] I just think it's like, it's now Stern Pimble easily is number one.

[05:17] And I think these guys are number two.

[05:20] And that's my point.

[05:22] Now, crappy servos make their games unreliable.

[05:27] And I do agree, Kelly, that they've got to get the quality better.

[05:32] And servos aren't the best way to sort of make games reliable, to make the mix work.

[05:40] That's not really going to work.

[05:42] CGC is number two.

[05:44] I don't think so.

[05:46] I'll tell you why, Kelly, how can you put CGC at number two when they reveal a game

[05:51] and it takes them over two years to get the game to customers?

[05:55] To me, that's not number two.

[05:59] Jersey Jack, I look quality aside.

[06:04] I mean, I just, I think if you want quality, yeah, go buy a Stern Pro all day long.

[06:14] The resale on spooky games hasn't been the best because they made too many Scooby-Doo's.

[06:22] They made, you know, it looked like Texas Chainsaw and Looney Tunes.

[06:28] Again, like, the only, their best resale game is Rick and Morty because it's their best theme.

[06:35] I mean, once they start getting the themes right and they nail more mainstream themes,

[06:41] like the worst is Ultraman.

[06:43] Like, that game is just like, I'm glad I lost my deposit on that game.

[06:48] But again, a lot of this is spooky's past.

[06:51] And I think in the future,

[06:54] I think we're going to see a lot better themes, a lot better mechs, a lot better quality,

[07:02] a lot better artwork, a lot better code, everything that makes a game fun.

[07:07] I think these guys are going to deliver.

[07:10] And I think there are a fun company to support.

[07:14] I mean, there's no other way around it.

[07:16] I mean, you just kind of want to feel good.

[07:19] Don't you want to wake up and feel good about the pinball company you support?

[07:23] They're not ripping you off.

[07:25] They're really not ripping you off.

[07:28] When you see that $1,000 stern topper Metallica, they're ripping you off.

[07:33] When sternalees are 13,000, they're ripping you off.

[07:37] I'm just tired of being ripped off.

[07:39] And I think at this point now, it's like you kind of want to support the underdogs a little bit.

[07:45] And I think everyone's just tired of being ripped off.

[07:48] I think everyone's tired of shortcuts and laziness and mailing it in and waiting a year for a topper to be available.

[07:57] I mean, you still don't even have a topper for for venom.

[08:04] Like you don't have a topper for venom.

[08:07] Where, where is it?

[08:09] I don't, I don't know where it is.

[08:13] You know, and so like I just think we're at a point now where people just are either going to tap out of the pinball hobby altogether and just wait on the sidelines.

[08:27] I think people are fed up.

[08:31] I think people are very fed up with the pricing, the delays, the inconsistency with communications.

[08:42] I think people are tired of losing so much money.

[08:44] I just think they want something a little bit different.

[08:46] And here's the thing, you're going to get this game is going to be less than $10,000.

[08:52] And there's going to be less than 900 of them.

[08:55] And more than 800 and 81.

[08:59] More than 800 and 82.

[09:02] More than 883.

[09:06] More than 884.

[09:08] I'm just going to do this until I get to the number.

[09:11] So yeah, I mean, look, it's not going to be everywhere.

[09:14] And if it's really loaded game and it's fun, it's going to work well for them.

[09:21] You know, the gas lighting Josh is really the part that annoys me.

[09:28] That spooky pinball is going to come out with a game that has way more mex in it and toys in it than a $15,000 jersey jack avatar.

[09:37] Then a $13,000 John Wick.

[09:40] I'm just tired of like of being gasoline.

[09:44] Like Jersey Jack when they launched avatars, they said this is like the most they've ever put into a game.

[09:50] That this is their highest bomb ever.

[09:52] Like, well, where?

[09:54] Where? What happened?

[09:55] Like, what happened?

[09:56] And Wizard of Oz would be $40,000 if this is everything you've ever put into a game.

[10:01] Yeah, more than $666.

[10:06] I just I'm over it.

[10:08] I'm over the spin the lies about loading up games, the manipulation, the gas lighting.

[10:17] It's like I can see with my own two eyes if something is a mechanism or a toy.

[10:22] I can see if you loaded it.

[10:24] I can see if you, you know, made a lot of different interesting shots.

[10:28] I can see if the I can see if the voices of the actors are synced up with the clips.

[10:34] These muted clips.

[10:37] So yeah, I think it's going to be a good week, a good week for spooky.

[10:42] I think it's going to be a good week for spooky.

[10:45] I think they're going to sell all 800 and something of these games.

[10:50] And I think half of them are going to go to evil dead fans.

[10:53] And the other half are just going to go to people that are tired of the other options.

[10:59] Now, the thing is this remember one thing though.

[11:03] Remember that spooky is still spooky that they can't make 800 and something games in six months.

[11:11] It's going to take them a while to make these games.

[11:15] So you're going to be looking at a way.

[11:19] And if history has shown us anything because they make as many collectors additions as people want,

[11:29] it's not going to be hard to get one.

[11:33] So and his history has shown us that if you waited out, you'll usually be able to cut the line.

[11:44] And also maybe save a few bucks.

[11:48] And that's just what history has shown us because sometimes distros bring these games to shows and you can get one there while people are still waiting.

[11:57] So I think there's a, you know, there's still the way to see and play with this game.

[12:05] That being said, I think if you love the theme and you know you're going to own one and you're not going to resell it, go buy one.

[12:12] I mean, that's really where rat is like the only the only thing, you know, the only reason to buy a game now is if you love the theme and you love the game.

[12:21] The whole days of like, yeah, I'll just, I'll show some support and buy a game and play it and then sell it.

[12:28] Those days are over because if you do that, you're going to lose a few thousand dollars.

[12:33] It's at the point now where you only really want to buy something you never want to sell again and then you don't care about the resell value.

[12:40] So that's it.

[12:42] Paul, you don't need to help the company out anymore.

[12:45] Like there's none of this like these companies need help.

[12:48] What these companies need to do is they need to pick themes that are day one sellouts and themes that hold their value.

[12:59] You know, until these companies realize that to what Josh just said there, new inbox is dying people.

[13:06] New inbox is like a suckers purchase unless you love the theme and you're never going to sell it.

[13:12] Like think about all the newbies who rolled into pinball and bought John Wick Ellie, Venom Ellie.

[13:21] Think about all those guys.

[13:23] They went all in.

[13:24] Think about the newbies who bought a Metallica Ellie, an old one, not the new one.

[13:30] Sorry, I still got my call who bought an old Metallica Ellie and there's these dudes exist.

[13:35] There are dudes who came in during COVID and paid $20,000 for an old Metallica Ellie.

[13:43] Think about those guys for a minute.

[13:46] Law them paid 18 for it.

[13:49] Imagine if you dropped 18,000 on an old Metallica Ellie and your game is now worth 10.

[13:58] And the new game is so much better and you can't even get one.

[14:02] I mean, it's just like talk about a punch to the gut.

[14:09] I mean, if you sold your Metallica premium for 12 at the height, tie you, you are, you are laughing all the way to the bank.

[14:17] I saw that now Metallica Ellie's are listed for like 18,000 and they're going to get them all day long.

[14:25] If you have a new Metallica, you're getting 17 to $18,000 all day long.

[14:30] If you have one, I would scalp it in a heartbeat.

[14:34] I would make the $45,000 in a heartbeat.

[14:38] I mean, someone's paying for another game.

[14:41] It's like getting another game for 50% off.

[14:45] Look, unless you love Metallica and you need to have it, you could scalp the new one.

[14:52] Go get the old one for five, you basically take 5,000 off the price of the old one.

[14:58] I look, I, you know, I just saw Batman SLE went up for sale.

[15:05] I don't think spooky prices are going up.

[15:07] I think this game is going to be right below 10 grand.

[15:10] You'll be able to option it out with butter for over 10, but I think spooky prices are going to stay the same.

[15:17] I think when you see this evil dead game and you see what's in it and then you look over and you see the toys and avatar for 15,000.

[15:27] It's not going to cut it.

[15:30] It's not going to cut it.

[15:32] Oh, Harry Potter better be packed.

[15:35] I have not seen the game.

[15:37] I have not seen the game. I told them, you know, they want to, if they want to send me something, I won't share it.

[15:43] Let me see if they sent anything.

[15:45] Sorry gang, I really still have this cough.

[15:52] It's not fun. I'm going to talk for a little bit and then I got to go.

[16:00] I think Harry Potter is going to be, I just, you know, it's weird for me to say this, but like, when was the last time?

[16:10] Jersey Jack nailed it.

[16:13] Nailed it.

[16:15] I mean, you almost might not even have any time they nailed it.

[16:22] Right. I mean, when was the last time Jersey Jack just nailed it?

[16:27] Okay, like, let's just stay on that.

[16:30] Is it clipping? I'm like moving around here.

[16:35] But when's the last time they nailed it?

[16:38] Elton John? Yeah.

[16:43] Maybe Elton.

[16:46] I am.

[16:48] Yeah, but I would argue Elton not the theme people want.

[16:52] Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, Elton, yeah, they nailed it for Elton John fans, but they didn't like nail a theme.

[16:59] Like, Elton, you know what I'm saying? Like, Elton John didn't sell well at all.

[17:03] And, and avatars about to sell worse than Elton John.

[17:08] I just, I just, you know, nail, to me, nailing it is you pick a theme people like are okay with.

[17:14] Like, you know what I'm saying? You pick a theme people are okay with.

[17:18] Then you, you nail, like, like to me, Godzilla is like nailing it. Like Godzilla was in like everyone's dream theme, but it's like we all like Godzilla.

[17:28] You know, it's like King Kong. I like King Kong.

[17:31] You know, like you could call anything King Kong bubble gum. I like it King Kong ice pops. I like it King Kong movie.

[17:38] I like it King Kong.

[17:40] You know, I like King Kong. I like a big gorilla.

[17:44] That's a monster that climbs the Empire State Building.

[17:48] I like Godzilla.

[17:51] I don't think Elton John is in the same universally cool for dudes territory as.

[18:00] You know, Elton John's not as cool as Godzilla and King Kong.

[18:05] Dial then did not nail it. He's got dialed it. Dial then is a disaster idea.

[18:12] It's a disaster idea. It never should have been made.

[18:17] Imagine if all of that effort went into making Toy Story one. Think about it for a minute.

[18:23] Toy Story one was already out for like 15 years as a movie. Imagine if Pat Lawler put all that effort into making Toy Story one.

[18:34] Dial then is another sterile numb game where you feel nothing. Like you want to feel more than you do, but you don't feel anything.

[18:47] Beetle juice and goonies are both coming.

[18:54] But you know, not yet. I just slope these themes that people really want.

[19:00] I hope they arrive before a new inbox is completely dead. I really I mean it.

[19:05] Gang we are launching long range missiles into Russia.

[19:10] Everything is so expensive every time I go to the gas now I just get like three gallons of gas and it's like $20.

[19:16] It's stupid. It's so stupid now like I don't know like I I got to be honest.

[19:22] Well fingers crossed I might have sold my New York City apartment that I'm going to knock this mortgage down.

[19:27] But man the cost of everything in my daycare 6,000 a month.

[19:31] I'm not in the market for new box people.

[19:35] I will have like money every month now once I sell this apartment.

[19:40] I'm just going to invest it in the future for my children and on vacation.

[19:45] I'm not I'm not really into like.

[19:48] I can't even flip ends anymore.

[19:51] It's no fun. They ruined scalping.

[19:57] You know, I just don't I don't see new inbox sustaining itself over the next five years. I think.

[20:04] You think about gang think about it. You really think this hobby.

[20:08] Can flourish over the next few years with where pricing is at.

[20:13] Do you really think pinball is going to like be okay at these prices.

[20:20] I either they lower prices.

[20:24] Or they lower the volume of games like they need to like Stern needs to make only two games a year.

[20:32] And and only have 500 L. E. they need to find a way.

[20:37] To sort of get some.

[20:40] Scare city back some value back.

[20:43] You need to start giving some second hand value to the consumer.

[20:48] And until they do that.

[20:52] Again, only fools rush into these new inbox purchases.

[20:56] I am really, really feel bad for all my friends who went all in on these L. E.

[21:01] I mean, you've lost $4,000 on every game.

[21:06] Except for jaws and Metallica.

[21:09] I mean, think about that like if you bought food fighters and James Bond just those two games alone.

[21:16] If you bought food fighters L. E. and James Bond L. E.

[21:21] You you lost almost $8,000.

[21:25] Just think about that for a minute.

[21:29] You fight early in a James Bond L. E. has lost you $8,000.

[21:36] That's that's a hard pill to swallow.

[21:42] You know, these are these are depreciations now on the level of an automobile worse than an automobile even.

[21:49] $8,000. Like you could buy almost a Submariner Rolex for the loss.

[21:54] You wouldn't lose that if you bought a Submariner Rolex.

[22:01] Oh man. Everybody like my throat is killing me. This has been fun.

[22:06] I got I got about I got to go have dinner have my soup.
