[00:00] Give me fuel, give me fire, give me that what you had to say.

[00:02] Ooh.

[00:03] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:24] I'm going to do a recap of my surprise visit to Pinball Expo.

[00:29] I booked the trip just about a week ago.

[00:32] I'm still not feeling 100%.

[00:34] I paid the price for this trip this morning on the way back to my home in Connecticut.

[00:39] I was literally on the bathroom floor in that big family-sized bathroom outside the entrance

[00:46] to Expo in the fetal position at 7, like, 50 in the morning.

[00:52] And I'm cringing.

[00:53] I, by mistake, I think I took like a pain medication on an empty stomach and I was dying.

[00:58] And I'm like, I'm never going to make it to the airport.

[01:01] I picked myself up.

[01:02] I was nauseous, but it was worth it because being at Expo, it reminded me of once again

[01:10] why we all love this hobby and it is the people.

[01:14] And I can't underscore enough that walking through that show, visiting the operator, stern

[01:21] army party, going back to Expo after that, walking the show floor and seeing all these

[01:28] amazing people, sharing photos and drinks and stories about Pinball, finding out where

[01:35] everyone is from.

[01:37] I loved every single moment.

[01:40] And it was such a good vibes day for me and I really needed it.

[01:44] I've been through a lot over the last three weeks and it's just been so nice to be reminded

[01:50] and really rediscover the core reason why this hobby is so amazing.

[01:55] It is filled with amazing people.

[01:58] People from all over the world who have come together to celebrate a box of lights that

[02:04] makes us feel good.

[02:06] I just want to say this before I go over my recap of the different companies at the show

[02:11] and my observations of being there for 24 hours.

[02:14] I just want to say this, the internet has the ability to bring people together and I

[02:20] love that ability of the internet.

[02:22] But reading Pinside, while I'm at Pinball Expo, you couldn't experience a polar opposite

[02:29] of the vibes.

[02:30] Like at the show, everyone's getting along, everyone's having a great time, everyone is

[02:36] celebrating and playing Pinball and then you go on Pinside and there's so much negativity,

[02:43] there's so much moaning and groaning constantly.

[02:46] It's almost as if some of these people wake up and they want to find more reasons to hate

[02:51] these companies, more reasons not to buy games, more reasons to make themselves personally

[02:58] very uninviting.

[03:00] And I just encourage each and every one of you, if you're in a place where more about

[03:04] this hobby triggers anger in you than excitement, then maybe you need to reevaluate why you're

[03:11] even in this hobby.

[03:13] And when you look at all these games and all these companies and what everyone's trying

[03:18] to do, I would say like 85% or 90% of Pinball Ventures start out with good intentions and

[03:26] a lot of passion and there's a lot of effort that goes into making these games and in the

[03:32] end it's really hard to put all the pieces together to make an amazing Pinball machine

[03:39] but the good news is for each and every one of us is you don't need to buy anything.

[03:45] Most of us have enough Pinball machines to last a lifetime but what we'll never get again

[03:50] are memories with the people and this is why when I walked around the show I really just

[03:56] wanted to focus on the people and talk into people because I'm not going to be able to

[04:00] see most of these people again.

[04:03] I might not see some of you for the rest of my life but I can easily always go find an

[04:08] X-Men or an Avatar or a Metallica or an Alice like I could find these games in the world

[04:15] much easier than I can find time with each and every one of you and that is why when

[04:20] I was at the show I really did prioritize my time to be with people and I think a lot

[04:27] of people should shut off Pinside, you should stop moaning and groaning on the internet

[04:32] and maybe just pick up the phone and call one of your Pinhead friends and spend an hour

[04:38] just talking about why you love Pinball instead of spending an hour on Pinside moaning and

[04:43] groaning like a baby about a game you're not even going to buy in the first place and I

[04:47] think you'll just be better off, your blood levels will go down, you'll be happier and

[04:53] you'll put more positive energy into the universe.

[04:56] What did I think about Pinball Expo?

[04:57] You're like, Kanata what are you talking about right now?

[04:59] Just talk about the games.

[05:00] Alright, so here's the thing, when I got to the show and I walked in right ahead of me

[05:06] was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, there was a line that formed right away.

[05:11] There was a consistent line to play Alice of about like 40 people all throughout the

[05:16] show at any hour of the day.

[05:19] And so we're going to talk more about Alice, obviously when we think about what were the

[05:23] new like major games at the show that everybody was excited to see, you know you had Alice,

[05:29] you had Avatar, you had X-Men and you had Metallica remastered, those were the games

[05:35] that really stole the spotlight, those were the games that had the longest lines and those

[05:41] were the games that a lot of people are really itching to get feedback on.

[05:45] You know because for a lot of people out there on the internet, you haven't had a chance

[05:50] to play any of this stuff.

[05:52] So your greatest moment to get some feedback from people would be feedback from Pinball

[05:57] Expo.

[05:58] Okay, so I walk in, Alice is right in front of me.

[06:02] It was just awesome hanging with Melvin, he's someone that I've met recently over the last

[06:06] few months.

[06:07] I've built a nice relationship with the man.

[06:10] He's an awesome dude, like we'd be friends even if it wasn't for Pinball.

[06:14] And in fact, we often now when we talk, we just try to talk about stuff other than Pinball

[06:20] because we're very similar.

[06:22] I think we're around the same age, we're into the same stuff and we're family man and he's

[06:26] a really cool dude and I mean that.

[06:29] And if you've met Melvin, you know what I'm talking about.

[06:32] He's an awesome dude and when you meet these people and you become friends with them and

[06:37] then you have to give your opinions about their products, of course, it is impossible

[06:43] to be completely unbiased when you get into situations like that.

[06:47] But I'm going to do my best to give you my true feelings on Alice's adventures in Wonderland,

[06:53] things I like, things I might have liked to have seen, things I think they can improve

[06:58] and you know what I think will happen with this game over the next year as they start

[07:03] to manufacture Alice.

[07:05] And then I want to talk about the most exciting game at the show which was easily Metallica

[07:11] Remastered.

[07:12] I mean, I think a lot of people have been debating like whether or not this game even

[07:16] should exist if the original was better, is this game worth the money.

[07:21] I'm hearing a lot of people on Pinside moaning groan and I think a lot of opinions have been

[07:26] formed by people again on the internet who have not stood in front of a Metallica Remastered.

[07:33] And I'm just here to tell you right now, when you stand in front of this game, you will

[07:38] be standing in front of one of the nicest pinball machines Stern has ever made.

[07:44] There's FOMO through the roof with this game.

[07:47] FOMO is not dead, it comes back when the theme is right and the game is great and there's

[07:52] more people that want it than can have it.

[07:55] And that is the case with Metallica LE.

[07:58] I'm happy to see Stern do 500.

[08:00] We're going to talk a lot about that game.

[08:03] We're going to talk about Jersey Jack's avatar.

[08:05] How did it show up at Expo?

[08:07] Was it able to showcase its features in a better light?

[08:11] Pun intended with the UV light.

[08:13] Was there updated code with more synced up video and assets?

[08:17] And we're going to talk a little bit about the danger room that they had set up for X-Men.

[08:22] So let's just go down a list of these games.

[08:24] And I think for a lot of you, before I do this, I want to say have safe travels home.

[08:31] Because I think many of you will be listening to this as you are traveling home from Expo.

[08:36] It was great hanging and I really appreciate all the gratitude that I got from each and

[08:41] every one of you.

[08:42] I can't personally go down a list and name names because there were just so many of you.

[08:47] And for those of you who came to Happy Hour, it was my pleasure to pick up the tab for

[08:52] everybody who's a Canada club member.

[08:55] I really do appreciate it.

[08:57] And for some of you, I will see you again either in New York or in Connecticut shortly.

[09:02] Let's do this.

[09:03] Let me do this in order.

[09:04] I'm going to tackle the four games in order and get to the one that I think just won the

[09:10] show.

[09:11] How's that sound?

[09:12] And the order, if I were to say the top four, and by no means is this like a weighted order,

[09:17] but I think it's just how these games arrived and the conversations I had with people and

[09:22] the enthusiasm around each of these products.

[09:26] I think for me, it goes in fourth place is Avatar.

[09:31] In third place is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[09:36] In second place is X-Men.

[09:38] And in first place is Metallica Remastered.

[09:42] Now let's start from the bottom up.

[09:44] Avatar.

[09:45] JJP showed up with a really nice section at Expo.

[09:49] They always do a good job setting up the Jersey Jack booth at the shows.

[09:54] They've got the steel frame with the lights hanging from it.

[09:58] And they bring a lot of games.

[10:00] And they had Godfather.

[10:01] They had Toy Story.

[10:03] They had Elton John's.

[10:04] They had a lot of Avatar Elise.

[10:07] And then they had, I believe, two or three.

[10:10] I think it was two, I want to say.

[10:13] Avatar CE editions in this pipe and draped area.

[10:18] Now I have played Avatar extensively.

[10:21] And what I was just curious about is how well the UV ink on the collector's edition, how

[10:28] well would it work?

[10:30] Because when you look at this game, that really is the main effect.

[10:36] It is the main wow moment of the game that they have been communicating and selling to

[10:42] us and marketing to us as this like World of Pandora is going to come to life under the

[10:48] black lights in this UV way.

[10:50] And the whole game is going to glow.

[10:53] And with the CE edition, you're going to see blue ink.

[10:56] You're going to see red ink.

[10:58] And you're going to see green ink.

[10:59] And it's just going to come to life in this bioluminescent way.

[11:04] And then when we saw the game a month ago, it wasn't really coming to life.

[11:09] And we know from the video they made, the $100,000 video to sell us on the game that they brought

[11:17] in additional UV lighting over the game to showcase the ink on the play field.

[11:24] And it hurts me to say this, but at Expo, they brought in additional UV lighting to stand

[11:31] over those games to make the playfields glow more.

[11:35] And I'm really concerned that the major feature in this game doesn't really work.

[11:43] And Jersey Jack doesn't have it figured out.

[11:47] And they were saying at the show how they're still not happy with where the ink is on the

[11:53] CE playfields.

[11:55] And they're not going to start making the game until they get it right.

[12:00] Here's my concern with that.

[12:02] It is mid-October.

[12:04] Those games are supposed to be on the line in November.

[12:08] And they're still tinkering with the UV ink on the playfields until they get it right.

[12:14] The game has been in development for two years.

[12:18] How is it that your most major feature, which you've been using in all of your marketing

[12:22] materials, you still don't have it right two weeks before your game is supposed to be on

[12:27] the line?

[12:29] So that means the CE playfields have not been manufactured.

[12:33] It means that those games are not going to be on the line in early November.

[12:37] And it also means that the major feature, which hooked a lot of people on this game,

[12:43] doesn't really work well.

[12:45] And I have a huge concern about this.

[12:48] Like what were you doing for the two years of R&D?

[12:52] How did you make this part of your marketing materials when you didn't figure it out yet?

[12:57] I think they're running a huge risk, Jersey Jack, of almost going into the territory

[13:03] of bait and switch, where they baited you with a launch video.

[13:08] And then the reality is the game itself doesn't deliver that experience.

[13:14] And again, because this game doesn't have any toys, because the lower playfields are

[13:19] not that much fun, it's really relying on that bioluminescent UV stuff to be the wow

[13:27] moment in the game.

[13:30] So that is why, you know, when I talk to people about Avatar, I mean, everybody loves the

[13:34] topper, the game is still stunning.

[13:37] I'm just really, really concerned.

[13:40] And when it comes to code, I heard a few more callouts and stuff, but I'm still not hearing.

[13:46] I'm not hearing those clips exactly the way they would be if they were just lifted from

[13:51] the movie scenes with the audio 100% synced up.

[13:55] Now they definitely released new code, but people, the code of Avatar now is .99.

[14:02] And I think what they've done is they've made it harder to get to those multi balls.

[14:07] So you're not going to be playing them as easily as you were before, but none of that's

[14:12] going to change the fact that the ball times on Avatar are super long.

[14:17] Most of the shots are really far up the playfield.

[14:20] And the big wow moment, that UV moment, isn't really working properly.

[14:27] So I would be somewhat concerned if I was all in on a CE, there was a rumor that they

[14:32] might be adding more UV lighting to the CE of the game.

[14:38] Again, really concerned that your product should not have been launched.

[14:42] It should not have been revealed to the world until you figured that out.

[14:48] I just don't get it.

[14:49] And I really did just sort of hover kind of on the outskirts of the JJP area, because

[14:55] I don't know how to give this company feedback.

[14:58] I really don't.

[14:59] I don't know if they want to hear it, but I don't know how they get this stuff wrong.

[15:04] And that's what's got me somewhat concerned about them as a company, because it's like,

[15:09] do you need us to tell you this stuff?

[15:11] Like, do you really need me to tell you you should not have launched a game until you

[15:17] got the major feature working in the game?

[15:20] And it just seems like common sense.

[15:23] And when a company's not getting common sensical things right, I just lose faith that someone

[15:30] is over there who's their George Gomez.

[15:33] Like, there's no way Stern Pimbal would have got that wrong, right?

[15:37] Like, look what they did with the UV and Stranger Things.

[15:39] It works.

[15:41] Not only that, it's amazing.

[15:42] Like it's way better implemented in the game than the UV is in Avatar, and that's the thing.

[15:49] I just don't get the sense at Jersey Jack that they're testing these products the way

[15:54] they need to, and that they're getting the feedback.

[15:57] If I were to give Ken and Brett some advice, you've got to start taking feedback into account,

[16:05] and you've got to find a way to get your company connected to the right kind of feedback, or

[16:11] else you're going to keep making these mistakes that at this stage, right, 10 years this company's

[16:17] been around 11 years.

[16:18] This is their 10th game.

[16:21] They shouldn't be making mistakes like this at this point.

[16:24] They should be firing on all cylinders, making the best machines they've ever made, and a

[16:29] misstep like this not being able to get the main feature to work right isn't working for

[16:35] me.

[16:36] Alright, so that's why Avatar gets number four on my list.

[16:40] From Avatar, we go to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[16:45] Before I get to Alice, I just want to say, look, at the show, there was Spooky Pinball.

[16:49] They had a lot of Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre's lined up.

[16:53] You've got this sense that we've moved on from those titles.

[16:56] They've been out for a while.

[16:58] They're really excited about their next game.

[17:00] I talked to Bug, but I don't really want to go down some of those older games on this

[17:05] episode because, again, I didn't really want to spend any time on stuff that I'd seen before

[17:10] and you've seen before.

[17:12] That's all the games at Spooky.

[17:14] The games at American.

[17:16] The games at CGC.

[17:18] Nothing new.

[17:19] I want to focus on the new games, not the old games.

[17:22] Also, I just want to say this, the homebrew section was awesome.

[17:26] When you look at the homebrew games and all the stuff happening Friday the 13th, Tony

[17:31] Hawk, Harry Potter, unfortunately, while it looked amazing, it wasn't playable, which

[17:36] was a tragedy.

[17:38] That game looks incredible.

[17:40] I'd hate to be releasing Jersey Jack's Harry Potter after this kid shows the world what

[17:46] could be under glass when it comes to Harry Potter because it's insane looking with that

[17:51] deep cabinet.

[17:52] But there are too many homebrew games to even mention, but what I love about seeing the

[17:56] passion in the homebrew area, that's where the next Keith Owen is going to come from.

[18:02] That's where the next Jack Danger is going to come from.

[18:05] By the look of things, this hobby's got a lot of talent coming up.

[18:10] That's going to be good because the legacy designers, some of them are beyond their prime

[18:16] and these newbies are going to want to get their shot at having a mass produced game

[18:21] happen and the homebrew area is a great stepping stone to nail a job like that.

[18:28] I mean, that's where Mark Siding came from.

[18:30] He made Metroid and now he's making Jersey Jack's Avatar.

[18:34] All right.

[18:35] So Alice's Adventure is in Wonderland.

[18:38] The line was always long.

[18:40] They had a beautiful sort of backdrop with the artwork and they had three games there.

[18:46] For the most part, it was only two games that were playable.

[18:50] They took a third one out that got set up sometime like later Friday and the line was

[18:55] always long.

[18:57] Now I want to say this, the line was long because they only had two games.

[19:04] You're not going to get a long line for X-Men when there's 40 of them or a long line for

[19:09] Avatar when there's like 20 of them.

[19:12] So yeah, lines can be somewhat deceiving.

[19:15] You can't look at the line and say, it's the most popular game at the show.

[19:20] Look, it was definitely popular though.

[19:22] There were other games there where there was only one example.

[19:25] I think there was like one labyrinth in the house and there wasn't really anyone online

[19:30] to play it.

[19:31] But when it came to this game, this has been a very polarizing game.

[19:36] Melvin and DPX and Barry did something that nobody really asked them to do.

[19:43] They took a J-Pop foam core game and they turned it into a working, functioning, work-of-art

[19:50] pinball machine.

[19:52] And I was at the seminar and I heard the stories again.

[19:55] I feel like I've heard these stories so many times and I get it.

[19:58] He made the game based on J-Pops ideas.

[20:02] He didn't add extra stuff.

[20:04] He actually just had to figure out how to make John's stuff, which didn't work.

[20:08] He had to make it work.

[20:10] And here's my feelings about this game.

[20:12] First and foremost, when you walk up to it, it is beautiful.

[20:16] It is a stunning game.

[20:18] It does look like this game that came from the mid-90s with a modern touch.

[20:24] The artwork in person is great.

[20:26] The colorization of the artwork in person is great.

[20:30] The entire machine, when you walk over it and you stand over it, it's much more colorful.

[20:36] It's much more lively and inviting than you've seen in the streams.

[20:40] And I mean that.

[20:41] But are the looks deceiving?

[20:43] Is the game beautiful to look at, but is the gameplay just mediocre?

[20:49] So what is it like to play the game?

[20:51] Because there's going to come a point where we get it.

[20:54] You made the J-pop game work, Melvin and Barry.

[20:57] And you manufactured it and you did all these tweaks.

[21:00] Okay, was it worth it?

[21:02] There's a phrase I always use in my industry.

[21:04] Was the juice worth the squeeze?

[21:07] Was this worth the entire effort?

[21:10] And is this game as good as other pinballs on the market in modern times?

[21:16] And I want to be completely candid here because I hear people saying like, did Dutch pinball

[21:20] pay you to be out there?

[21:21] No, they did not pay for me to be out there.

[21:23] I am not on any payroll with the company.

[21:26] I think this game is hard to evaluate for everybody because I think you have to look

[21:32] at this game in a certain context.

[21:34] And if you do look at it in a certain context, you will absolutely enjoy the game.

[21:41] And you almost need to look at it in that context to justify buying it and enjoying it.

[21:48] Because if you try to look at this game as being something that has gameplay that's comparable

[21:54] to an X-Men or a Jaws or a Theater of Magic or a Circus Voltaire or a Toten, look, it doesn't.

[22:03] This game doesn't come close to having like the tons of stuff those older J-pop games

[22:09] have in them and doesn't have like the kind of crazy layouts we're used to with the modern

[22:15] games happening by the other companies today.

[22:18] Again, so if you look at it like that, I saw some people saying like, it reminds me of

[22:22] Circus Voltaire.

[22:24] And I have to be honest, what are you talking about?

[22:27] Circus Voltaire has one of the greatest mechs and toys in the history of pinball with a

[22:32] ringmaster.

[22:33] Like that does so many different things.

[22:35] And that's just one thing happening that's really unique and whimsical on Circus Voltaire.

[22:41] This game is not Circus Voltaire.

[22:43] It is Circus Voltaire light.

[22:45] It feels more like a magic girl to me than a Circus Voltaire.

[22:49] And that should make sense because this game and its sort of creation and its designs happen

[22:56] when John was doing his Zidware games.

[22:59] So if you look at it through that context of Melvin in less than a year made a working

[23:05] version of a J-pop thought starter, I think you're really going to enjoy this game.

[23:11] And I think it's interesting because all he needs is 500 people that enjoy this game

[23:18] on that level.

[23:20] It is unlike anything else happening in pinball right now.

[23:24] It looks different than every other game on the market.

[23:27] Okay, so what is the game like to play?

[23:30] Now I was only able to play about three to four games on Alice.

[23:35] There was lines all the time.

[23:37] I did not want to cut the line.

[23:39] I did not want to have any special treatment.

[23:42] And so I finally got on it late, late Friday night.

[23:47] And for those of you at the show, you know what I'm about to say.

[23:50] It is exhausting being on your feet, on that concrete all day long.

[23:56] And then you walk up to a machine and you can't really hear it.

[24:00] Like I didn't get pulled into the sound or the music or the call outs.

[24:05] But what I did really like about the game is I just liked standing over it.

[24:11] It just has this really fun whimsical world under glass and the shots are makeable and

[24:19] it's easy to understand what you're supposed to shoot.

[24:24] And I think that's my favorite thing about this game is you're standing over it and there's

[24:30] one big lightning bolt flashing and I know I need to shoot there.

[24:36] There's not everything going at once.

[24:38] There's not like rainbow lighting going all over the place where I have no idea what I'm

[24:43] supposed to be shooting at.

[24:44] So it's very easy for someone to walk up to Alice and have a nice, fun, casual game of

[24:51] pinball.

[24:52] And again, in a world in which Stern and Jersey Jack and everybody else is delivering these

[24:59] modern, deep, ruleset games, I find it somewhat refreshing that there is just a simple game

[25:07] that not everybody's going to own, that is just a unique pinball experience.

[25:12] But it also has some magic that I think works.

[25:16] Like I definitely love that upper play field when you get up there and it is fun to get

[25:21] up there.

[25:22] And there is a little bit of a learning curve.

[25:23] I think Melvin is working on the code so that people get up there more often.

[25:29] But the magna flip area up there is a lot of fun.

[25:33] Magna flipping.

[25:34] Again, I know a lot of you out there don't like it, but there are a lot of us out there

[25:39] that love it when a magnet grabs the ball and just makes the ball do something where

[25:45] invisible forces are making that pinball fly around the play field.

[25:49] I love that about pinball.

[25:51] And so being up there in the Queen's Chamber is a lot of fun.

[25:55] I love it when the magnet grabs the ball near the left in lane, like the flamingo area.

[26:01] That is awesome.

[26:02] The spinning discs that can save the ball are really cool.

[26:06] I love it when you go into the mad hatter mode and the disc just keeps spinning.

[26:10] I think what's interesting about this game, if I were Melvin, I know he's got two buttons

[26:15] on each side and one controls the spinning discs.

[26:18] I think he should work into code more often that you can turn them on by hitting switches

[26:24] in certain modes and not have to worry about using that second button.

[26:29] I don't know.

[26:30] I think it would just be more fun sometimes if they came on in an automated way.

[26:35] The same way in Toten were those shooting stars.

[26:39] Imagine if you had to use a button to activate the shooting stars.

[26:44] It wouldn't be as much fun as them just turning on when the ball is about to drain.

[26:49] The center ramp is easy to hit.

[26:52] You could hit it all day long.

[26:53] I know people were like, oh, the power, it doesn't go up, it rolls back down.

[26:58] You can definitely nail that ramp over and over again.

[27:02] If there's one area for improvement I would like to see in the game, I do feel like the

[27:07] flipper power was a little weak.

[27:10] I don't know if they could turn it up a little bit.

[27:11] I also felt like the games were not that steep that they were playing a little floaty.

[27:17] You could tell floaty gameplay when you just stand over a game.

[27:22] You don't even have to be on a machine to see how the game is going to feel when you're

[27:26] on it.

[27:27] If you stand over an Elton John, you see snappy fast gameplay.

[27:32] If you stand over an X-Men, you see that snappy fast gameplay.

[27:36] When I was standing over Alice, it did feel more like watching Avatar, where the ball

[27:42] is moving much more slower from the flippers to the shots at the top of the play field.

[27:48] I think that's something that they can work on in software.

[27:51] I know Dutch uses those opto flippers and they're probably not as good as the stern

[27:57] flippers, so there's that.

[27:59] I think people are going to see what they want to see in Alice.

[28:03] I think for people that love modern pinball and have been enjoying games like Godzilla

[28:09] and games like X-Men, you name it.

[28:12] All these modern games that people love, Jurassic Park, if you've been enjoying those games

[28:17] and what those games have in them and you walk over to Alice expecting a similar experience,

[28:24] you are going to be extremely disappointed.

[28:27] You are going to think the game is empty.

[28:29] You're going to think there's nothing in the game.

[28:31] There's not much to shoot at.

[28:33] You're going to feel a disconnect in what am I actually doing in this game.

[28:37] That is one thing that I did feel too.

[28:39] The artwork is so interesting and it's so detailed.

[28:44] There's all these characters.

[28:45] I think they need to work on the code a little bit, where some of that artwork and some of

[28:50] what we're seeing in the game, these beautiful sexy women, you're not seeing them come up

[28:55] on the screen.

[28:57] You're not hearing any of Alice's inner monologue as she's interacting with these characters.

[29:04] I think that's something they could explore with code down the road.

[29:07] I think it would help tie together some of that sexy edginess that's on the art.

[29:13] How do you get that into the game more?

[29:15] But also that's J-pop, guys.

[29:18] This is what J-pop did.

[29:19] He always wanted to get to the artwork.

[29:23] He always wanted to wow us with art versus software because none of the Zidware games

[29:29] had really any software that was interesting at all.

[29:33] If you went from a magic girl and then you played Alice, you would be like, oh, gee,

[29:39] this code is incredible.

[29:41] That's really what this game is.

[29:43] It's a working version of a Zidware idea that was made miraculously in just 12 months

[29:52] by a guy that you never heard of before in the pinball world.

[29:57] I think if you look at Alice like that, it will always be an interesting game to have

[30:03] in a large collection or a medium-sized collection.

[30:06] It will always have an interesting story to go with it.

[30:11] You can't say that about most games.

[30:13] There's only 500, 300 in America, and 200 overseas.

[30:19] I wish they could make these games faster.

[30:22] It would be great if all 500 would be in homes in four months while people were still hyper-interested

[30:28] in the game.

[30:29] I do think over time, if they're only doing 10 a week, interest and conversation around

[30:35] this title is going to start to diminish now every single week.

[30:40] It's really going to be, we got to now get these games made.

[30:43] I do wish the team all the best in getting the games made.

[30:47] You know I have a little bit of a personal connection with these guys.

[30:50] I think they nailed the brief on the game.

[30:53] If you look at it in the right context, I think you're really going to enjoy it.

[30:58] If you want to find things to hate about it and look at it like it should be just as good

[31:03] as these modern other games, of course you're going to come away disappointed.

[31:08] You're never going to want one.

[31:10] You'll be able to bag on the game and insult it as much as you'd like.

[31:14] But man, give these guys some credit because they did what nobody else could.

[31:19] Alright, so the final two games, X-Men.

[31:21] So X-Men is amazing.

[31:24] I think X-Men LE is one of the nicest stern machines I've ever seen.

[31:29] Only problem is a nicer stern machine dropped right on top of it at Expo.

[31:34] I don't have too much to say about X-Men because they only got to play it a few times.

[31:38] The new code is getting better and better.

[31:40] They're sort of giving Wicen a lot more support.

[31:44] I think the more they remove him from the software lead, the better this game is going

[31:48] to get.

[31:49] The hard part has been done.

[31:51] The layout is phenomenal and Stern is not going to give up on this game code-wise and

[31:56] I think it's just going to keep getting better every month.

[31:59] I think for $13,000 though, I would like to have seen X-Men have an exclusive topper

[32:05] that's available only on the LEs.

[32:08] I think that is something Stern needs to start exploring as we move forward, but they

[32:13] definitely are a company listening.

[32:15] I'm not going to go into all of the personal conversations I had with people at Stern.

[32:20] They were really amazing while I was out there.

[32:23] I know they want to get better.

[32:25] I know they want to listen to us.

[32:27] I know they are listening to us and I think it's easy to blanket hate them and they're

[32:32] the big bad evil empire of pinball, but I would rather take a different approach and

[32:38] give them constructive feedback and build bridges to the leadership there and actually

[32:44] have meaningful conversations about how we can get these things in a better place so

[32:50] that they still hold their value so that if you're going to spend this much money, you're

[32:54] getting your money's worth.

[32:56] So you don't rip open the cardboard box and lose $3,000 in an instant.

[33:00] And again, it's easy to be a complainer on pin side.

[33:04] It's a lot harder to try to bring about positive impact on these products and on these companies.

[33:11] So yeah, X-Men is great.

[33:13] I think if you have one, you're going to love it.

[33:16] I'm still shocked that the LEDs are not sold out.

[33:19] I really don't understand it.

[33:20] It is such a nice game and I think it's just the fact that it's $13,000.

[33:25] I think the other problem with X-Men is all three of them look amazing.

[33:30] I was telling this to the Stern folks, you guys got to start sandbagging the pros because

[33:34] it looks so damn good.

[33:36] How can you keep making the pro cabinet as good as the LE cabinet?

[33:40] They really need to start differentiating more.

[33:42] I'm sorry, but if a pro machine is just supposed to be on location and allow people to go through

[33:48] the game without all the bells and whistles, you're putting too many bells and whistles

[33:52] in it, it all of a sudden doesn't make the LE worth twice as much money as the pro.

[33:59] And this is one of those pros where they didn't take out much and it might be the best Stern

[34:03] pro in a long time.

[34:05] And I think that's another reason why do I really need to spend twice as much?

[34:10] And what am I really getting?

[34:12] Is it worth it?

[34:13] It's hard to see $6,500 more fun in the LE over the pro.

[34:19] But if they had exclusive modes that were only in the LE or an exclusive topper, that

[34:24] would start to make the LE owners just feel better.

[34:27] All right, maybe I should have done this in reverse order because I've been talking for

[34:31] a while and now I'm a little tired and I'm getting to the number one game of the show.

[34:36] And I was telling people like over a year ago, Stern Pimbal is remaking Metallica and

[34:41] I told you, it was me, nobody else said this story that Metallica visited Stern Pimbal

[34:47] and they saw Rush and they were jealous that their game did not have a modern example and

[34:54] they wanted Stern to make a modern example of their game and this is John Borg's masterpiece

[35:00] people.

[35:01] He actually said he worked about as hard and as many hours on the remastered game as he

[35:07] did on the original one.

[35:09] And when they wheeled this game out and it was that microphone brewery, I want to tell

[35:15] you right now, this is one of the most stunning Stern Pimbal machines I've ever stood in front

[35:22] of.

[35:23] This game blows away the original.

[35:25] I'm sorry everybody who has an original.

[35:28] I know you're not happy.

[35:30] I know you want to justify your Dirty Donnie artwork, but come on everybody.

[35:35] The Dirty Donnie game.

[35:36] Now 12 years later, that looks like the equivalent of the art package on the GNR standard edition

[35:44] games.

[35:45] You know those cartoon characters in those like dune buggies.

[35:49] For some reason when you look at this game and then you put it next to the original,

[35:53] the original does look so cartoonish and this one looks like Metallica.

[35:59] This one reminds me of what Metallica's look and feel and persona was all throughout the

[36:05] 90s and they nailed it.

[36:08] It looks incredible.

[36:09] It is some of the coolest Metallica artwork I've ever seen and it's in Pimbal format and

[36:16] you get to own it.

[36:17] If you're one of the lucky 500 that got an LE and listen to me and you got rid of your

[36:23] original Metallica LE and you know you made a lot of money on that sale.

[36:28] So nobody can complain because there's never going to be a Metallica LE owner that lost

[36:32] money.

[36:33] There's not going to be an OG Metallica LE owner that lost money.

[36:37] There's never going to be a Metallica LE remastered owner that's going to lose a penny.

[36:42] This game is never going to go down in value.

[36:45] It is going to be one of those FOMO games that just holds and holds strong.

[36:50] There's way more interest in Metallica than Jaws just as a theme and then you build it

[36:56] on top of this Lyman sheets and John Borg masterpiece and you make it better.

[37:00] You make everything about the game better and then you only make 500 LE's and you have

[37:04] this metallic artwork on the side that's perfect.

[37:07] The artwork is different on both sides and then you've got the best Translight I've seen

[37:12] in a Stern machine in a long time and you've got modern sound and the best part about it

[37:18] you've got internet connectivity with Metallica and all these new challenges.

[37:23] You're not going to get that in the original game.

[37:25] This game 100% hard stop makes that old game in my mind obsolete not to mention the band

[37:33] footage and the way the animations work.

[37:35] They're incredible but it's going to trigger everyone who has an original.

[37:40] Everyone who has an original is going to justify that their game is better.

[37:43] The same way the guys who didn't get an LE on this new one are like oh yeah the premium

[37:49] is better.

[37:50] I'm telling you everybody and I mean this.

[37:51] I've stood over both of them in person.

[37:54] The premium is nowhere near as nice as the LE.

[37:57] I know you want to convince yourself it is but that Mount Rushmore Translight and the

[38:03] green on the cabinet and the art package is just not as detailed.

[38:07] It's not as nice and that's how it should be.

[38:10] The premium shouldn't be nicer than the LE.

[38:14] So I think Stern is made.

[38:15] I'm just going to say it a modern masterpiece.

[38:18] I think nobody's ever going to question if this game is great.

[38:21] We know it's great and now it's just better and on a global market everybody I talk to

[38:26] the dealers want it more.

[38:28] Everybody want it more and I want to say this.

[38:30] I'm so happy that Stern Bimbal is only making 500.

[38:34] They needed to do this.

[38:36] This was the time to do this.

[38:38] This is them listening to us.

[38:40] They got to get back to the FOMO.

[38:43] They've got to get back to more demand and supply and they got to start creating things

[38:48] that just become masterpieces that are not everywhere.

[38:52] There's only going to be this many.

[38:54] That matters.

[38:55] I think they did it right.

[38:56] I know conventional wisdom says well they should have just made a thousand because that

[39:00] would have made a thousand people happy and now you're making 500 people happy and everybody

[39:05] else is unhappy.

[39:07] I don't buy that.

[39:08] I do think now moving forward Stern's going to have to work on how they allocate these

[39:13] games.

[39:14] How do they do it?

[39:15] We all know the dealer model is like a model from the 80s people.

[39:20] Is that the best way to do it?

[39:22] I got a friend in Australia.

[39:23] He got locked out of getting a Metallica LE.

[39:26] He was on his dealers list for a year or two and then the dealer only gets 25 and has like

[39:33] 75, 100 people that want it and unfortunately he didn't get one even though he was on the

[39:38] list for a year.

[39:41] The dealers are not doing stuff like a lottery system.

[39:44] They can just pick and choose who they want to give the game to.

[39:47] I think Stern might want to figure out how to create a system that maybe is a little

[39:51] bit more fair but ultimately when you do it right and you make things truly limited you

[39:57] are also not going to appease everybody and that's okay.

[40:02] We got to stop living in this world where like everyone has to be made happy like pinball

[40:07] socialism.

[40:08] Like let's just make as many as people want and then none of them are special.

[40:12] Would you rather live in that world which is the world we've been living in?

[40:15] Too many LE's across the board.

[40:17] None of them are special.

[40:19] Everybody's losing money right?

[40:21] So the only people making money are the distros.

[40:24] Is that where you want to be as pinball collectors?

[40:27] I don't want to live in that world.

[40:28] I think they did it right and I think the frenzy around this game is real.

[40:32] I'm just going to say like standing over this game they crushed it.

[40:36] Everything about it.

[40:37] Everything about it.

[40:38] I love the new magnets.

[40:39] I love the new Sparky.

[40:40] I love the Metallica behind them that lights up.

[40:43] I love everything about it.

[40:44] I didn't get a chance to see the UV light work in the game but man the concert footage,

[40:49] the way it's woven in with the animations is genius.

[40:53] You can really tell Stern went the extra mile with this game.

[40:57] James and Lars and the whole band being involved with the callouts is incredible.

[41:02] This game is going to go down.

[41:04] I think one of the top five must have Stern machines.

[41:08] And if this opens the door to another version of Tron like this, another version of Lord

[41:14] of the Rings like this, you know, Sam games that get ported over, how do you stop Stern?

[41:20] And Stern's factory is really just one line right now and they have room to become two

[41:25] lines.

[41:26] Can you imagine if Stern's able to go to their vaults and make some of their best games ever

[41:31] look this good and then also bring out new stuff like Keith Owens, King Kong.

[41:37] This company is just like unstoppable people.

[41:39] I mean it.

[41:40] They're just going to be unstoppable.

[41:41] And for the record, I found out talking to Stern directly, Metallica was supposed to

[41:46] be a Spike 3 game.

[41:48] They just needed more time to perfect the platform.

[41:50] Look at that.

[41:51] They didn't reveal it.

[41:52] They didn't want to pass on quality control issues with Spike 3.

[41:56] They wanted to test it and make sure they got it right.

[41:58] So that is why Spike 3 is going to be on a ladder title.

[42:02] Will it be Dungeons and Dragons, Brian Eddy's game or will it be Keith Owens, King Kong.

[42:07] I think it makes sense to hold it to King Kong.

[42:10] Bigger screen, big gorilla.

[42:12] I forgot to mention that Dutch pinball did not announce that they're making back to the

[42:17] future.

[42:18] I know there's a lot of speculation that someone else is going to make it with them.

[42:22] None of that is confirmed.

[42:23] No deals have been inked.

[42:25] And I think it's smart that they didn't start talking about back to the future because that

[42:28] game is so far away.

[42:30] And you want all the attention to be on Alice.

[42:32] So that didn't make much sense if you ask me.

[42:35] And I want to give a quick shout out to Chris Turner and his game Ninja Eclipse.

[42:40] I walked over to Chris at the show.

[42:42] He's maybe the nicest guy in the world, let alone pinball.

[42:47] And I love the innovation he's done underneath that game.

[42:51] How those boards work and how clean the game is and how he's sort of made manufacturing

[42:56] a lot more efficient with his innovations.

[42:59] This is a great first game to test out all those innovations.

[43:03] And I think if he can now go get a licensed theme with what he's got going with that tech,

[43:10] I think he's in a good place.

[43:12] I also think other manufacturers might start taking notice of how his tech is working and

[43:19] how it could streamline their manufacturing.

[43:22] Because with his boards, if a light goes out, you can repair it.

[43:25] You're not stuck having to replace the whole board.

[43:28] Chris, I want to say congratulations on getting your game to market on selling those games

[43:32] you had.

[43:33] It was nice.

[43:34] He had like four Ninja Eclipses.

[43:35] They all sold.

[43:36] And you know, he's only making a hundred.

[43:38] And will he sell all 100?

[43:40] Maybe with his kind of attitude and his positive energy, I think Chris will find success in

[43:47] pinball.

[43:48] And I think he's moving at his own pace, which is good to see.

[43:51] Everybody, I just want to say, if you ever get a chance to go to a show, go to a show.

[43:55] I think more and more of you need to start turning the internet off.

[43:58] You're surrounded by a lot of negative, cranky people.

[44:02] And all they do is hate.

[44:03] I mean, I saw people like taking photos of me.

[44:05] It's funny.

[44:06] They're taking photos of me, making fun of me on pin side.

[44:09] Look at this clown.

[44:10] Look at this D-bag.

[44:12] All the nasty things in the world they want to say to me.

[44:14] And what's funny to me is those haters are there, right?

[44:17] They're in their room with me.

[44:18] They don't have the guts to ever come up to me and say those nasty things to my face.

[44:24] And they're the losers.

[44:25] They're the losers.

[44:26] They're the losers for making fun of people like that, like spreading their hate.

[44:31] Meanwhile, I'm sitting down at the table with the leaders of these pinball companies, and

[44:36] they're in the bathroom on pin side just trying to get some likes from a bunch of losers like

[44:41] them.

[44:42] Everybody, the majority of this hobby is really cool.

[44:45] You know who you are.

[44:46] I'm not going anywhere.

[44:48] I got thick skin.

[44:49] I'm really happy about what I've done with this show.

[44:53] I'm really happy about how I was received by the community and by the companies.

[44:58] Yeah, they tried to kick me out, but cooler heads prevailed, and it was onward and upward.

[45:04] I'm not trying to focus on any of that negativity.

[45:07] This show, people, as of today has over 2 million listens, Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[45:13] over a thousand episodes about pinball.

[45:16] I think we've done a good thing for pinball.

[45:18] I think we're adding value to pinball.

[45:20] I think there's a lot of good stuff happening in pinball.

[45:23] The prices are high, and the games are going to have to deliver to justify those prices.

[45:29] You know I'm going to call it like I see it.

[45:31] So in summary, I think Avatar is doing a little bit of bait and switch.

[45:36] I think enthusiasm for that game is going to run thin sooner than later, and I think

[45:41] we're going to get Harry Potter in March, because there's no way they're going to make

[45:45] avatars between now and March.

[45:48] There's no way.

[45:49] The orders are just not going to be there.

[45:51] And if the CEUV doesn't work well, who's really going to be plunking down 15K on a

[45:58] game where if they make all 1000, right, there's twice as many avatar CEs as Metallica LEs?

[46:05] Those games are going to sit, and you're going to be able to get one for like 10Gs in just

[46:09] a few months.

[46:10] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, it's going to forever be a polarizing title.

[46:16] Those who see it in the right context will enjoy it, and it will be a unique conversation

[46:22] starter in their game rooms.

[46:24] Much cheaper to buy this game than the fool who bought Magic Girl for 36,000.

[46:30] Did you see that auction at Expo?

[46:32] Little does that person know that Magic Girl is probably going to be remade, and it's actually

[46:37] going to work, and it's not going to cost you 36,000 dollars.

[46:41] Foolish purchase if you ask me.

[46:43] X-Men is amazing, the code's going to get there.

[46:46] My only worry with X-Men is Metallica did override it, and I did feel a little bit bad

[46:52] that X-Men did not have the spotlight of the show.

[46:56] The line to play Metallica was two hours long.

[46:59] There was not an hour long line to play X-Men.

[47:02] Again, there was only two Metallicas, that's why.

[47:04] And Metallica, I think Metallica showed us that Stern Pinball can get even bigger.

[47:11] That Stern Pinball has so many aces up its sleeve, it's not even funny.

[47:17] It really is Stern, and everybody else, a distant second.

[47:21] And the fact that they can make a classic game like Metallica this much better, I would

[47:27] hate it.

[47:28] I would hate it if they even considered Tron or Lord of the Rings, or another Ghostbusters

[47:35] or ACDC.

[47:36] I would hate it because every other pinball company doesn't have that.

[47:40] They don't have a deep portfolio, and they don't have the talent to do these kinds of

[47:45] remastered games.

[47:46] Everybody I'm exhausted, I want to give you a little bit of a longer show.

[47:50] I got to go edit this now, so I can talk for like an hour, and now I got to listen back

[47:53] and edit out some stuff.

[47:55] I'm going to be dead tired.

[47:57] Everybody thank you so much for your support, and I want to end this show by thanking a

[48:01] few people that have edited their pledges.

[48:04] You know they raised the roof club.

[48:06] Clint Warren went from five to ten.

[48:09] Thank you Clint.

[48:10] I want to thank Bill Gunnett.

[48:12] He went from five to ten, and Todd F. Todd went from five to ten recently as well.

[48:18] Everybody thank you, and have a great night, and a safe travel home from Expo.
