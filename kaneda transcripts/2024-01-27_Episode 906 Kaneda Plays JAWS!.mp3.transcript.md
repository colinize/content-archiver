[00:00] We could have had it far, but it's a deal.

[00:08] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:13] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:16] Am I dedicated to this show?

[00:18] I literally just got out of a taxi from Chicago back to New York City.

[00:22] I came through the door, gave Killian a kiss and Brenda a kiss, and then I said,

[00:28] I gotta go do a quick pinball podcast about Jaws Pinball.

[00:32] I played it at Logan Arcade yesterday.

[00:35] I was doing Whirliball, which was like down the street from Logan's Arcade.

[00:40] What Whirliball is, it's bumper cars with like La Crosse added in where you're firing

[00:46] a Whiffleball at a target that is up where a basketball hoop would be.

[00:51] It is a lot of fun.

[00:52] It is a good corporate building exercise, but you don't listen to this show to learn

[00:56] about Canada's corporate building podcast.

[00:59] You want to know about pinball.

[01:01] So let's talk real quick about some pinball news.

[01:04] The rumors have been circulating more and more about American pinball being up for sale.

[01:10] And now there was someone on pinball enthusiasts who's like, that's not true.

[01:14] There's a Barrio game coming out in a little over six weeks.

[01:18] Are we going to see a new American pinball game at Texas Pinball Festival?

[01:24] Is the company really for sale?

[01:26] I am hearing things over there are not good.

[01:28] I think if we were to kick open the door to American pinball, we would not see a pinball

[01:34] manufacturing company taking place.

[01:37] We would not see games on the line.

[01:39] We would not see a bunch of people assembling pinball machines.

[01:43] There have been people who ordered Houdini's months ago.

[01:47] They still have not got those games.

[01:49] And I'm hearing it is dire straits time.

[01:52] And look, you heard it here first on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:55] Look, this wasn't me rooting for this company to fail.

[01:59] But if you make a lot of bad decisions, failure is a natural part of the capitalistic system.

[02:06] If you don't have companies fail, then companies won't learn a lesson.

[02:10] I've always said this, the biggest problem with so many of these pinball companies, nobody's

[02:15] ever held accountable for terrible decisions.

[02:18] And you've got all of these other companies bankrolling these failed pinball decisions.

[02:24] If the Abbas family were not involved with Jersey Jack, Jersey Jack would be out of

[02:29] business right now again.

[02:32] After these last two games, that company is not going to be in business after the Toy

[02:36] Story flop and the freaking Godfather flop and now the Elton John flop.

[02:41] An American pinball that's even worse.

[02:42] I mean, after being in business for almost like eight or nine years, the company comes

[02:48] out with freaking galactic tank force.

[02:51] Nobody wants that game.

[02:52] At most they sold two to 300 examples of that game when they probably needed to sell at

[02:57] least 500 to break even.

[03:00] So they're sitting on like 200 3D printed tank parts that have nowhere to go.

[03:06] 200 thermoses and lunchboxes with nowhere to go.

[03:09] So we've got that going on.

[03:11] Spooky pinball, congratulations.

[03:13] They're starting to ship Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Looney Tunes to customers I think as early

[03:19] as next week.

[03:20] So we should start to see those games go out the door.

[03:24] That is good news and a modern miracle has happened.

[03:28] Chicago Gaming Company is actually making Pulp Fiction, a game which I also played yesterday

[03:34] at Logan's Arcade.

[03:36] It was good to see imagery and video of all of those beautiful Pulp Fiction cabinets stacked

[03:42] up and lined up.

[03:44] Now we didn't see games going into boxes just yet and now we're all going to get spammed

[03:50] by all the pinball distributors reminding us that we can order Pulp Fiction today.

[03:55] It's been funny, right?

[03:56] This game has been out for almost a year and it's been available to purchase for almost

[04:00] a year and now we're going to get inundated with distros trying to sell us new Pulp Fictions.

[04:06] The problem is now, how many have they already sold, right?

[04:10] 12,000 LEs have to be made and then they probably sold a bunch of standard edition games and

[04:16] how many are they going to make?

[04:17] If you're not in on that first run of standard edition games, you might be waiting a really

[04:23] long time like a whole other year to get your game.

[04:26] So a little advice to everybody out there, I would not buy a Pulp Fiction until that

[04:32] game is sent to a distributor and just wait, right?

[04:36] You're not going to get your game anytime soon.

[04:38] Now we're also seeing that Flyers are going into pinball life mailers.

[04:44] If you ordered something from Pinball Life, there are Flyers, according to Naps Arcade,

[04:49] going into the orders that are teasing the Princess Bride pinball.

[04:55] Trust me when I say this, I know 100% fact it is going to be a multi-morphic P3 title.

[05:04] It is not going to be a new pinball company.

[05:07] So get ready for the Princess Bride by Jerry Stelenberg and multi-morphic.

[05:13] I'm really curious to see what they do with the assets.

[05:16] We've never seen a movie ported over onto the multi-morphic platform.

[05:20] So what will that be?

[05:22] We shall see.

[05:23] All right, let's get to Logan's Arcade.

[05:25] So as I said, I was at Whirliball.

[05:27] I checked my Uber app and I saw that Logan's Arcade was basically four minutes away.

[05:33] And when you're in Chicago, even though everything might be four minutes away, you have to wait

[05:38] like 18 minutes for your Uber to get there.

[05:41] But I got a bunch of people, my coworkers, we went over there and I must say this, first

[05:45] and foremost, Logan's Arcade is amazing.

[05:49] It is one of the nicest arcades you can possibly go into and it's got something for everybody.

[05:55] You walk in, they've got the environmental disc of Tron game, they've got all these pinball

[06:01] machines lined up, then they've got this section with all these 80s arcade machines that are

[06:06] super fun.

[06:08] Then they've got another row and room of pinball machines.

[06:11] Then they've got like some candy cabinets from Japan and there was like a Street Fighter

[06:15] tournament going on when I was there.

[06:17] Now I have to be honest, I really wanted to hop on Street Fighter and see how good I still

[06:22] was, but there was a huge crowd of people on a Thursday night.

[06:26] And then I saw Jaws Pinball.

[06:28] Jaws Premium.

[06:30] Right next to it was Pulp Fiction.

[06:32] Right next to Jaws on the other side, there was a Rush LE, then there was like an attack

[06:37] for Mars, there were some CGC games and they had everything that was new.

[06:41] They had a Jaws Premium, they had a Pulp Fiction, they had a Jaws Pro, they had an Adams Family,

[06:47] they had a Foo Fighters LE, they had a Ghostbusters Freakin' LE just out there on the floor.

[06:53] And so I played Jaws Premium over and over and over again.

[06:58] Now I have to say this, at Logan's Arcade, you can't hear the machines very well.

[07:03] There's almost no volume coming out of the machines.

[07:07] And so as I give you my first gameplay impressions, keep in mind that with every game I played,

[07:14] it wasn't like I was absorbing what was going on with the software of the game.

[07:19] I could see the clips and I have to say this, and again, I couldn't hear too much of the

[07:24] game.

[07:25] It does feel like the clips are all over the place in this game and I'm just a little bit

[07:30] worried about that.

[07:31] I've played other Stern games where they've used movie clips and put them together and

[07:36] it just feels very, very chaotic.

[07:39] The clips just don't come at you in this like linear fashion and it's just a little weird.

[07:44] It's almost like they didn't know what to do with the LCD screen in between you starting

[07:48] modes.

[07:49] It's just constantly throwing scenes at you that don't really make sense.

[07:54] You don't even feel like you've done anything yet.

[07:56] You just see them making the chum.

[07:57] Then you see a dog.

[07:59] Then you see this.

[08:00] Every time you hit something, some other clip is popping up on the screen, but none of it

[08:04] seems very cohesive.

[08:05] And so that being said, I jump on Stern Premium.

[08:09] And the first thing I do is walk around the game.

[08:11] I'm noticing the artwork and it's all right.

[08:13] This game is not going to really blow you away from an artistic standpoint.

[08:18] Nothing about the art package is terrible, but nothing about it really jumps out too

[08:23] much.

[08:24] And I will say, I don't really love the Translight on the premium.

[08:28] I liked the pro iconic Jaws movie poster Translight better.

[08:33] And then you stand over the game.

[08:34] And I love for the first time standing over a new machine because when you stand over

[08:39] a new machine, all of the pin side baby stuff dissipates.

[08:43] All of the moaning and groaning we've been listening to and all of your own sort of skepticism

[08:48] it all just sort of goes away and you can absorb in real life what they've done with

[08:53] this game.

[08:54] You can absorb the colors, the shots, the geometry.

[08:58] You can take in the world under glass of Jaws pinball machine.

[09:03] And when I was standing over the game, did I feel like they nailed it?

[09:07] And I have to say this, the reason I liked playing this game at Logan's arcade is you

[09:13] can compare and contrast a modern stern machine with other games from other companies.

[09:19] They didn't have an Elton John.

[09:21] They didn't have any Jersey Jack games, but putting a new stern next to a Chicago gaming

[09:27] company classic like Attack from Mars and thinking about it next to a game like Pulp

[09:31] Fiction, you do start to compare and contrast.

[09:35] Like how does a stern feel?

[09:37] How does it look?

[09:38] Is it really blowing me away?

[09:40] And so we'll talk a little bit about that.

[09:42] I played about five games in a row on Jaws Premium.

[09:46] And I just want to say this first and foremost, the gameplay is just fine.

[09:50] Like it shoots really nice.

[09:52] It's a Keith Elwyn game.

[09:53] There's a lot more interesting shots in Jaws than are in Pulp Fiction.

[09:58] And when you stand over the game and you look at it, you start to realize like so much of

[10:03] this game is happening in the back area of the game.

[10:07] Like everything is sort of happening where that upper play field is and behind it.

[10:12] There's a lot of like ramps.

[10:14] There's a lot of stuff happening.

[10:15] All the pathways to the wire forms.

[10:18] It's a lot of stuff that's hidden behind all of those things that are happening like in

[10:22] the game.

[10:23] And it's really uniquely done.

[10:24] I think Elwyn really did pack a lot of stuff into this game, but all of the stuff is happening

[10:30] towards the top portion of the game.

[10:33] And that was the first thing I felt after a few games.

[10:36] It doesn't have like that Godzilla feeling that there's a lot of stuff all over the game.

[10:42] It just doesn't have that.

[10:44] That was one of my first takeaways of this game.

[10:46] Thinking about how Godzilla plays and thinking about how Jaws plays.

[10:50] I do think there's a lot more to shoot at or at least there feels like there's a lot

[10:55] more to shoot at and a lot more interesting stuff going on in Godzilla than there is in

[11:00] Jaws Pimbal.

[11:01] I also noticed from a gameplay standpoint, there's a lot of stopping go in Jaws, but

[11:07] I think you can control some of that.

[11:08] But you know what I'm talking about?

[11:10] Being able to trap that ball with the upper right flipper is really interesting.

[11:15] And you can do it a lot.

[11:16] And I kind of like that.

[11:17] Like you could tee up your next shot.

[11:19] The only thing is this, that upper right flipper.

[11:22] There's really not something really fun and satisfying to shoot coming off of that upper

[11:28] right flipper.

[11:29] It's like you're dying to have one of those classic Elwyn orbit shots off the upper right

[11:35] flipper.

[11:36] You know, you can keep looping it around and around and around.

[11:38] And it just doesn't have that.

[11:40] For the most part, it feels like the main target of that upper right flipper are those

[11:45] drop targets to the left.

[11:47] And that's fine, but I just will say that there's not a ton of satisfaction of hitting

[11:53] those drop targets.

[11:55] And then when we think about the premium, the major difference between this and the

[11:59] pro is definitely that upper playfield and definitely the shark bash toy up the middle.

[12:06] Now I know there's a lot of debate.

[12:07] There's a lot of debate about whether or not the pro is good enough.

[12:11] And if that upper playfield just doesn't give you enough enjoyment to justify the cost over

[12:17] the pro version of the machine.

[12:19] And here's my take on this game again after playing it like five times.

[12:22] I don't think the upper playfield does very much.

[12:24] I really don't.

[12:25] In fact, getting to that upper playfield, me and my friend played about five games

[12:30] each.

[12:31] And I think we were up there not often.

[12:33] Like it's not the kind of upper playfield where it's easy to get up to it.

[12:37] There's not a ramp in front of it.

[12:39] That's easy to shoot.

[12:41] And that shot to get up there is very narrow and very tight.

[12:44] And you're going to find the balls not going to have the velocity.

[12:48] Unless you hit that shot perfectly, you're not going to get to that upper playfield very

[12:52] often.

[12:53] And when you do get up there, the shots off of that upper playfield are just really kind

[12:59] of like, they're not really that special.

[13:03] And that was one of my takeaways from the upper playfield is like, you see it there.

[13:07] You want to get the ball up there.

[13:09] But when you do get the ball up there, it's really not that rewarding.

[13:13] And the other part is this, and I'm just going to say this, looking down at the game, and

[13:17] I was talking to my friend, and you see like the big shark bite out of the back of the

[13:21] boat and it says Orca, but that upper playfield looks nothing like a ship.

[13:27] It doesn't look like the Orca at all.

[13:30] In fact, I'm kind of embarrassed that this is supposed to be the Orca in a world under

[13:36] glass in Jaws Pimball.

[13:38] It just looks so weird, like nothing about it feels aesthetically like a ship.

[13:45] And again, I'm going off of my friend's reaction.

[13:47] I'm like, what is that?

[13:48] Can you tell me what that is?

[13:49] It just doesn't have any elements to it that feel like the Orca.

[13:54] And I go back to Pirates of the Caribbean and the way the ship rocked back and forth.

[13:58] And there were a lot of details on that pirate ship that made you feel like it was the black

[14:03] pearl.

[14:04] And then you look at this Orca and it's lazy and it looks cheap.

[14:09] And being up there is not that rewarding.

[14:12] And so I do feel like the upper playfield does not add that much excitement to Jaws Pimball.

[14:18] I also felt like the shark fin that popped up, you know, that's on the pro version of

[14:23] the machine.

[14:24] That lighting effect of the blood in the water is really cool.

[14:27] But also I'm going to be honest, the shark fin, again, it happened a lot when I was playing.

[14:32] It wasn't too hard to get that thing activated.

[14:35] But when that shark fin does pop up, again, it doesn't really create a wow moment in the

[14:42] game.

[14:43] And maybe with the music and with the callouts, it will add a lot more wow to the game.

[14:49] And I can't believe I'm going to say this.

[14:51] But to me, Jaws Pimball, the most important element in this game is that shark popping

[14:58] up from underneath the playfield.

[15:01] I really didn't have that much of a problem with the shark at all.

[15:05] In fact, that is probably the most fun toy in the game.

[15:09] That was my takeaway of Jaws.

[15:10] It's like, the shots are fun.

[15:12] The shots are there.

[15:14] There's a lot of great speed in the game.

[15:17] There's a lot of great combos to hit in the game.

[15:20] But when it comes to satisfying stuff in this game, it's all about the flow.

[15:26] The toys themselves leave a lot to be desired in this game.

[15:31] But I will say that moment in which the shark pops up from underneath the playfield is really

[15:37] cool.

[15:38] And everybody that was watching us play it and everyone who played the game, there's

[15:41] just something satisfying about that sequence of putting the chum in the water, getting

[15:47] the shark to pop up, bashing the shark, getting him to go back underneath.

[15:52] There's just, that's Jaws.

[15:54] That's the story of Jaws.

[15:56] And then when I walked over and played the pro machine and the shark is just always there,

[16:01] it doesn't work.

[16:02] I know people are thinking it's the upper playfield is the thing you don't really need.

[16:07] And you don't mind losing that upper playfield if you get the pro version of the machine.

[16:11] But I think the most important thing in this game, the most important toy, the most important

[16:17] feature is to maintain that shark popping up from underneath the playfield.

[16:22] If you lose that, I think you somewhat neuter this game.

[16:26] And I really mean that.

[16:27] And that's why like, oh man, a pro version of the machine I think is missing the most

[16:32] important part of Jaws pinball.

[16:34] And here's the crazy part though.

[16:37] As we were playing the premium and as we were sort of standing over Jaws, I couldn't help

[16:42] but think there's no way that an Ellie version of this game should be twice the price of

[16:50] the pro version of this game.

[16:53] And this is the other part, you know, this game was right next to Pulp Fiction.

[16:56] And I only played one game of Pulp Fiction, ladies and gentlemen.

[16:59] I didn't want to keep playing Pulp Fiction without any music, without any call outs,

[17:05] it's just not the experience.

[17:07] And Pulp Fiction shoots fine, but it doesn't shoot anywhere near as good as Jaws pinball.

[17:12] And I know there's a lot of Pulp Fiction people who are like, oh, you know, Pulp Fiction's

[17:16] amazing.

[17:17] It shoots so well.

[17:18] I think those people need to have their head examined just a little bit.

[17:22] It's a fine shooting game, but there's nothing crazy about the shots in Pulp Fiction.

[17:28] Jaws is a much more rewarding game to flip.

[17:30] But Jaws to me also feels like a game that's not fully there.

[17:35] Like it's not fully baked.

[17:36] I still feel like when I stand over Jaws, there's just still a lot of elements of it that feel

[17:43] really cheap.

[17:44] And that's what's frustrating me about pinball.

[17:47] For so many years, a Stern LE was just a few thousand dollars more than a Stern Pro.

[17:53] Like remember when a Stern Pro was 5,500 and an LE was like $8,000.

[17:59] And now a Stern LE is $13,000 and that's twice the price of a Stern Pro.

[18:06] And when I walked away from Jaws pinball, and we had a lot of fun at Logan's Arcade,

[18:11] me and all my coworkers, we spent about like $40 at most on games and had like an hour

[18:16] and a half and we had so much fun.

[18:19] And when you leave the arcade and you're like, you know, you could own that in LE trim for

[18:24] $13,000.

[18:27] And it just feels stupid.

[18:28] I mean it when I say it.

[18:30] There's nothing about a Stern machine.

[18:32] I don't care if it's Jaws.

[18:34] They had a James Bond there.

[18:36] They had a Ghostbusters LE.

[18:38] These games are just not worth anywhere near that much money.

[18:43] And it sucks because I don't want to like jump on a Stern machine and feel like they should

[18:49] be this much money.

[18:51] And I think that's going to be the predominant takeaway of all of these games.

[18:56] Like Stern makes the best Honda Civics on the planet.

[19:01] And every once in a while, they make a great version of a Honda Civic.

[19:05] But there's no way they can charge these prices consistently.

[19:08] And I know for some of you out there, you don't want me to complain about the price of a Stern

[19:13] machine, but I can't help it.

[19:15] You just stand over them and you feel them and you flip them.

[19:19] And even though the shots are there, they just feel cheap.

[19:23] There's just something about them that does not justify these prices.

[19:27] Now that being said, I definitely think if you like Jaws and this movie is one of your

[19:32] favorites, you're really going to enjoy this game.

[19:35] But my advice to each and every one of you is simply this.

[19:38] Just wait a while and then get one in like six months and save yourself thousands of

[19:44] dollars.

[19:45] I think once the luster wears off on Jaws' pinball and people realize it's a good game,

[19:51] but it's not the second coming of pinball.

[19:54] I think we're going to see all of those elite prices slide back down to reality around $10,000.

[20:00] I also think we're going to see premium deals left and right.

[20:04] And getting a pro might not be a bad decision.

[20:07] But as I said, losing that major moment with the shark to me just makes Jaws' pinball irrelevant.

[20:15] Because then you're just really all about hitting switches and software.

[20:20] And if pinball becomes all about switches and software and shots become the new toys

[20:27] and we stop expecting like there to be that physical world under glass that we can interact

[20:33] with and if we stop feeling like there's wow moments and wow things to shoot, I mean nothing

[20:39] in Jaws is really wow.

[20:41] Like none of the toys are really that impressive.

[20:45] Godzilla blows this thing away when it comes to toys and mechs.

[20:49] It just does.

[20:51] Like I don't care.

[20:52] It's not about bulleting out how many coils are in each game.

[20:56] It's about the physical feel you get when you play Godzilla versus playing Jaws.

[21:02] The thing about Jaws, I just feel like all of it just feels like they played it a little

[21:06] bit safe.

[21:07] Like none of it feels like they really went the extra mile.

[21:12] But again, here's what I think is going to happen.

[21:15] The news ordered one is going to say it's like the greatest Elwynn masterpiece ever.

[21:21] And people who think it's overpriced are going to say it's not.

[21:24] And I tell you right now the answer is somewhere in the middle.

[21:28] And I think what's great about pinball right now, I encourage each and every one of you

[21:32] jump on the machine and find out for yourself.

[21:36] And I think it's way too early to be throwing like $13,000 at this game until you really

[21:43] make sure this game has everything in it you want.

[21:47] And once you play it, I mean it.

[21:49] Once you start to play these games, the magic starts to erode a little bit.

[21:54] It doesn't become more magical.

[21:56] Because again, when I stand over these modern sterns, I can't help but feel we are getting

[22:02] ripped off at these prices.

[22:04] It's just not there.

[22:06] And again, I was just staring at the Orca and I was like, this is as good as they can

[22:10] do for this much money.

[22:13] And then I look over at Pulp Fiction and everything in it, like the sculpts and the

[22:17] toys, there's just more effort.

[22:19] It just looks like there's more passion and effort going into the stuff that's in the

[22:23] Pulp Fiction game than is in the Jaws game.

[22:26] And again, Pulp Fiction was a lot less money.

[22:29] All right, everybody, I'm tired.

[22:31] I've been up early in the morning.

[22:33] And I know if I'm a little bit cranky, cut me some slack, but I wanted to get you a quick

[22:38] show.

[22:39] Happy Friday night.

[22:40] Don't rush in and buy any of these games.

[22:43] All these games are going to be selling for less money.

[22:46] All of these pinball machines right now are overpriced.

[22:49] Everybody knows it.

[22:50] It's the greatest time in the history of pinball to wait and see.

[22:53] And I just don't feel like most pinball is going to survive if every game is over $10,000.

[23:00] It's just not worth it, everybody.

[23:02] I would much rather go to Logan's Arcade when they open up and ask the guy to turn the volume

[23:06] up and sit on the game for like a half hour, then spend $13,000.

[23:12] Everybody have a good one.

[23:13] We'll talk to you soon.

[23:14] You have my heart and soul.

[23:15] You have my heart and soul.

[23:16] You have my heart and soul.

[23:17] You have my heart and soul.

[23:18] You have my heart and soul.

[23:19] You have my heart and soul.

[23:20] You have my heart and soul.

[23:21] You have my heart and soul.

[23:22] You have my heart and soul.

[23:23] You have my heart and soul.

[23:24] You have my heart and soul.

[23:25] You have my heart and soul.

[23:26] You have my heart and soul.

[23:27] You have my heart and soul.

[23:28] You have my heart and soul.

[23:29] You have my heart and soul.

[23:30] You have my heart and soul.

[23:31] You have my heart and soul.

[23:32] You have my heart and soul.

[23:33] You have my heart and soul.
