[00:00] We're going to talk.

[00:10] We're going to clean this camera a little bit.

[00:16] We're going to go get some water real quick hold on.

[00:46] Don't worry you can need it is here.

[01:14] Let's do a show.

[01:24] Let me just close this door.

[01:32] Let's talk about how's everybody doing?

[02:12] I mean, every single day that remind me how little money I make in public relations.

[02:22] I think it's going to be fun about today.

[02:32] I started it a little early because the port jam is the music festival that starts at 11.

[02:42] I think it's going to be fun.

[02:52] I think it's going to be fun.

[03:02] Let's go.

[03:12] I'm going to show you what I mean by my last show about Potter assets.

[03:22] He's going to disagree with everything I say.

[03:32] I think it's going to be fun.

[03:42] I think it's going to be fun.

[03:52] I think it's going to be fun.

[04:02] I think I've been very fair and balanced on this game.

[04:12] I think it's going to be fun.

[04:22] I think it's going to be fun.

[04:32] I think it's going to be fun.

[04:42] I think it's going to be fun.

[04:50] I think it's going to be fun.

[05:00] I think it's going to be fun.

[05:10] I think it's going to be fun.

[05:20] I think it's going to be fun.

[05:30] I think it's going to be fun.

[05:40] I think it's going to be fun.

[05:50] I think it's going to be fun.

[06:00] I think it's going to be fun.

[06:10] I think it's going to be fun.

[06:20] I think it's going to be fun.

[06:30] I don't understand why we have to deal in such extremes.

[06:40] I think that Harry Potter is not the greatest pin ever.

[06:48] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[06:58] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[07:08] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[07:18] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[07:28] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[07:38] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[07:48] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[07:58] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[08:08] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[08:18] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[08:28] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[08:38] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[08:48] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[08:58] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[09:08] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[09:18] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[09:28] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[09:38] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[09:48] I don't know.

[09:58] I think most people are like, yeah, we just want pin.

[10:08] I think most people are like, yeah, we just want pin.

[10:18] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[10:28] I think it's not the greatest pin ever.

[10:38] It's like, it's another muted clip game.

[10:46] I got the Jersey Jack gameplay where Joe's playing and I got the Suarez from France, which plays.

[10:52] So you'll have to hear someone talking in French, get a little cultured people.

[10:56] But it's a good audio of gameplay.

[10:58] But it's more importantly, you can see what I mean, what's happening on the screen.

[11:02] And so here's what I think everybody is like not understanding.

[11:04] Are there synced up audio?

[11:08] Like, are you hearing from the actors in the movie and seeing video with them talking synced up?

[11:14] The answer is yes, but here's the big but, but only only like a few times and not through the modes.

[11:24] So what you're seeing is, is they bought the rights for the voices to do things like ball one locked and then they'll say something.

[11:34] Like, it's like, it's the consistent moments in the game.

[11:42] You know, that like every time you lock a ball ball one ball to will have a synced up video sequence that you will see.

[11:50] Okay, they yeah, it's in there.

[11:52] But what's not in their game is when you start a mode or you're doing stuff like, I don't know, let's say quiddage.

[12:02] Showing Harry on the broom, you're not hearing any of the actors talk to each other through any of the moments in the movie.

[12:11] So you're, you know what I'm saying? Like, does everyone understand what I mean by that?

[12:14] So like, everything is just muted.

[12:16] It's like avatar when you start any of those avatar multi balls or battles.

[12:20] You are not hearing anything from the movie or seeing all the clips and they're, they're like cycling them.

[12:28] But you don't hear the sound effects. You don't hear the screams when they're screaming.

[12:33] You don't hear the dialogue between the characters.

[12:36] And I just think it's, it's, it's a tear.

[12:40] I don't know why because I guess they just are buying a few minutes of footage.

[12:45] See, that's the thing is like, you can buy footage that's fully synced up by the minute.

[12:52] That's, that's how licensing does deals too.

[12:55] Like, they don't, they can't, it's just bad.

[12:59] Again, I don't like it.

[13:01] Should we watch it? You know, see what I mean? Okay. So here's what I want to do.

[13:04] Let's watch this game being played for a few minutes together.

[13:08] And I want you guys to count how many times you see synced up video with voices, right?

[13:17] But I also want you to tell me how many times, let's, this is going to be fun.

[13:22] How many times in Harry Potter pimpal, right? The main character.

[13:26] How many times do you hear Harry Potter talk?

[13:30] How many times are you seeing video clips of Harry Potter actually speaking?

[13:36] How many times do you see Harry Potter speaking to Ron and Hermione Hermione?

[13:44] How many times do you see the golden trio actually talking to each other?

[13:48] Which is what Harry Potter is all about, right?

[13:52] So, so like, can we do it? Do you want it? It should I do it?

[13:59] Because every rebel guitar, this is Wes. Wes, do you want me to pull up how?

[14:05] Okay, I'm also going to pull up real quick, Batman 66 stream.

[14:08] Because I think Wes is like confused like what, what I mean by this.

[14:14] Like actually syncing clips.

[14:22] Alright, let's see.

[14:28] Do do do do.

[14:34] Let's see.

[14:44] Hold on, I'm just, I'm just saying.

[14:56] Oh my god, it's the worst clip ever. Sorry, I'd like try to find a YouTube of Batman.

[15:11] And let's just get Jack Danger plan. Here we go.

[15:31] So here's the thing. Okay, just just watch this.

[15:35] I want you to watch this because I want you to do it. Do me a favor.

[15:39] Hold on, share screen.

[15:43] Hold on.

[15:47] Batman.

[15:53] I wanted to do it when you watch this everybody. When you watch this, what I wanted to do is not only do they like show you everything synced up.

[16:03] But what's imagine all these Batman clips, even when they repeat clips, which they do in Georgia, imagine all these muted where you're not even hearing the sound effects from the moment in the show, right?

[16:15] This is read it like honest. I want you to see how it should be done. Okay, let me play.

[16:23] And also look at just how much is on this screen.

[16:29] Shooting that spinner is going to give us a lot of points.

[16:41] I mean, this is just a better coated A-maver.

[16:47] Okay, now we're up to 13 billion.

[16:51] Why doesn't Mr. Freeze stop the ball save timer? Freeze all timers, my ass. Yeah, right? Freeze most timers. Sure.

[16:58] Okay, so TV targets are blinking. Let's try this. Please don't drink.

[17:14] All right, so let's play. Many points were scored in the making of this video.

[17:22] Synced up. Nothing muted. Here comes the bonus. Ready for a spit take.

[17:34] I mean, this crane is better than 1.7 billion points.

[17:44] I mean, this is how you do assets people.

[17:56] I mean, I don't even see him doing notes. I'm going.

[18:02] I'm going to stop. I'm going to take a screenshot.

[18:06] Okay, hold on. All right. Hold on. Hold on.

[18:17] Hold on people. We're going to do.

[18:27] Okay, let's say. Okay, remember when I said, let's look at the clips.

[18:34] I think I'm going to like, I think I can even zoom in on the clips. Hold on.

[18:42] All right. Let's watch this and see how many times you hear Harry Potter talk and watch how many muted clips are already.

[18:53] The music is in there, muted, why is it muted?

[19:05] This is very fast.

[19:13] I'm looking at the screen while the others are playing.

[19:17] The trash is on the screen.

[19:19] They're mad like that.

[19:21] I love the prank.

[19:23] Shoot left. Left run to begin tryouts for the kid.

[19:29] He's a jack tanker getting started and he moves.

[19:31] We gotta find him.

[19:33] The man's murder.

[19:35] For a man's murder?

[19:38] He's too much to change, you're here.

[19:40] What's the movie?

[19:43] Let's try the two.

[19:45] Oh, there's one.

[19:47] There's a lot of secrets.

[19:49] Here we go.

[19:51] Red gold.

[19:54] He's focused on the enemy.

[19:56] He's gonna throw them red and yellow.

[19:59] So there's red, yellow, yellow.

[20:02] There's the pink one.

[20:04] There's yellow, yellow, yellow.

[20:06] Look at this.

[20:07] How are you supposed to...

[20:09] Alright, you hear the drill?

[20:12] You have one.

[20:15] Corbard.

[20:18] Look, the fire is on the screen.

[20:21] You're gonna have to do it.

[20:23] I'm gonna do it.

[20:25] It's almost 100% of the time.

[20:27] It's like this lane is on the north side.

[20:40] Is this all real?

[20:43] Look at it, it's bass.

[20:46] Are you here?

[20:48] I think that was muted.

[20:50] Aim for the deaf, e-tector, start a battle.

[20:53] Quidditch.

[20:54] It's using up on the front.

[20:56] Head to the order of the females.

[20:59] My best friend.

[21:04] I'm sure.

[21:06] The classic.

[21:08] It's always the first part.

[21:16] You tell me what you see.

[21:18] It's what you have to do.

[21:31] I'm just...

[21:33] I didn't say anything.

[21:35] Don't talk, Harry.

[21:45] Explore the red wall, okay?

[21:48] I'm just gonna do it.

[21:50] We just have a part.

[21:53] You did it.

[21:55] Look, it's now this move.

[21:57] Nothing coming out of it.

[22:06] Come out, travel in line.

[22:08] You see this?

[22:11] You play the game.

[22:14] I like it.

[22:16] Wow, you did it.

[22:19] Oh, that's it.

[22:22] Does it start with the multi-billion?

[22:24] Whoa, it's backwards.

[22:27] I can do it as a block machine.

[22:29] I can do it as a block machine.

[22:32] I can do it as a block machine.

[22:35] It's like a block machine.

[22:38] No!

[22:41] Oh, time for music.

[22:44] I'm so excited.

[22:47] Oh, that's enough.

[22:49] The end of it.

[22:51] Oh, I can't see it.

[22:54] The third Harry Potter yet.

[22:57] No, the protection.

[23:00] Thank you.

[23:02] We did a block.

[23:04] We activate the protection.

[23:06] That's what I did in the rules.

[23:09] We're gonna hear the men in this pair.

[23:12] We're gonna hear the men in this pair.

[23:14] We're gonna hear the men in this pair.

[23:17] We're gonna hear the men in this pair.

[23:20] No, it's not.

[23:23] Oh, the Phoenix.

[23:26] Fox Ribbon in three shots.

[23:29] I used it through.

[23:32] You know what I'm talking about?

[23:34] I think that's yours to save your ball.

[23:37] I'm gonna eat well.

[23:39] I'm gonna lose.

[23:43] It's gonna be too fast.

[23:47] I'm gonna eat well.

[23:50] I'm gonna eat well.

[23:53] You don't know where the ball is.

[23:56] Oh, yeah, it's a push.

[23:59] I can't do it.

[24:02] You can choose to announce what you're gonna do for more points.

[24:09] The left.

[24:11] I think you need to pull the ball and do it to the fly.

[24:14] I will watch in the game on your mind.

[24:17] No, I won't.

[24:20] It's good.

[24:23] The three deaths angels to qualify to death.

[24:27] The ultimate I did, he's on the most famous in the Scalier.

[24:32] It's very rainbow, right?

[24:35] Oh, you're pushing yourself in.

[24:40] There's three.

[24:42] He's up.

[24:45] I'm gonna get to the keeper.

[24:48] Oh, yeah, it's not easy.

[24:51] You don't have to be too late.

[24:54] I don't know where the ball is going.

[24:57] It's something.

[25:00] Good, good, good.

[25:03] That's it.

[25:06] It's all dunno.

[25:08] Hang on.

[25:18] That's an interesting game.

[25:21] William!

[25:24] I'm trying to lie about him.

[25:25] I make a choice.

[25:26] Try going ally.

[25:29] I want to go with you.

[25:30] I'm going with this guy.

[25:31] I go with you.

[25:33] Oh, no!

[25:35] I have to go but...

[25:35] Oh, Jolie.

[25:38] Oh, I can't find it.

[25:40] I have to have a reflex, I can't find it.

[25:42] Whoa.

[25:43] Hey, I have a little bit of a Jolie.

[25:47] Boom.

[25:48] Boom.

[25:49] Boom.

[25:50] Boom.

[25:51] Oh, that's a good one.

[25:52] How much going on?

[25:54] How is this?

[25:55] I think there is.

[25:56] I don't know.

[25:57] Wow.

[25:58] Wisley, and Wisley.

[25:59] Wisley.

[26:00] Wisley.

[26:01] You will bomb a hit action button.

[26:04] I don't know what.

[26:05] But something on the...

[26:06] I don't know what the game is about.

[26:07] I don't know what the game is about.

[26:08] I don't know what the game is about.

[26:09] I don't know what the game is about.

[26:10] I don't know what the game is about.

[26:12] You want to be the king of the village?

[26:14] Ha ha ha.

[26:16] Well seen.

[26:18] 20 million bonus.

[26:22] Sorry.

[26:23] The village...

[26:27] Okay.

[26:28] Yeah, look, it's like I said, gang.

[26:31] It's the most Jersey Jack, Jersey Jack game they've ever made.

[26:35] It's how they...

[26:37] It's how they...

[26:38] This is their philosophy on how pinball should be integrated.

[26:42] I know there's limitations to the license.

[26:44] All I'm saying, gang, is I'm not a fan of like just the way they put so much...

[26:55] Everything's rainbow bright.

[26:57] Everything is just lit up.

[26:59] Like the sounds sound like the wonka chocolate factory.

[27:03] And I'm not a fan of...

[27:04] I think it's Mark Silks call out.

[27:06] It's like all he...

[27:07] It's like...

[27:08] The amount of times the game is just always telling you what to shoot.

[27:13] I look...it's fine.

[27:14] It's fine.

[27:15] I look...it's a beautiful game.

[27:16] It's going to be fun.

[27:17] You're going to see it everywhere.

[27:19] Everyone's going to have one.

[27:20] So like...

[27:21] You know, again, like I'm glad it's out.

[27:23] I just...

[27:24] I was hoping there'd be something magical...

[27:28] From the mech standpoint, I was hoping there'd be more of like a Hogwarts castle under glass...

[27:36] A world under glass.

[27:37] That is not a world under glass people.

[27:39] Like if we start saying that that's a world under glass, then we've all forgotten what a real world under glass looks like.

[27:49] And that is not it.

[27:50] Okay.

[27:51] Again, like the whole world building thing is a little too dramatic as well.

[27:56] Like some games should be like a world under glass.

[27:59] And Harry Potter should be.

[28:01] Right?

[28:02] When you actually are based on a theme where there's castles and if you go to Wizarding World, right?

[28:07] I want to look down at Harry Potter Pimball and feel more like I'm playing a miniature Wizarding World environment.

[28:15] It doesn't feel like that.

[28:17] It feels more like...

[28:20] I don't even know.

[28:22] It doesn't have that...

[28:26] It doesn't nail the world of Harry Potter.

[28:29] I don't know any other way to say it.

[28:31] I'm sorry.

[28:32] That's just the way I feel.

[28:33] I feel like it should have had more scopes.

[28:35] It should have had...

[28:37] How do you not make Harry Potter and have twinkling candlelit vibe?

[28:41] Create an effect that feels like smoky darkness at night.

[28:47] Like some of the spooky and creepy elements of Potter will never happen in this game because it's just rainbow bright everything louder than everything else.

[28:57] And that's...

[28:59] Like Jersey Jack is...

[29:00] To me what they're making here is something that feels like it's a redemption game in Dave and Buster's that's just meant to light up and pull you in.

[29:08] And again, like it's just how they make their games.

[29:11] And I'm just saying the sound...

[29:13] Did I mess up my sound?

[29:17] I might have moved the wire.

[29:22] Let me know. Is it glitching?

[29:24] If it's glitching, get out of YouTube and come back in someone said.

[29:30] Okay.

[29:31] I don't know.

[29:32] I don't know.

[29:34] Okay.

[29:35] So I...

[29:37] Yeah.

[29:40] Yeah.

[29:41] Can hate is not synced.

[29:45] So a lot of you are going to get this game.

[29:49] And I'm just...

[29:51] Yeah. Like I think it's...

[29:54] Let me ask you guys a question.

[29:58] Other than the staircase, what's the next mechanism game that you think is really cool?

[30:04] Right.

[30:05] I just want to know what you guys think.

[30:15] The sound is clipping again.

[30:18] I'm a clipping.

[30:20] I'm a clipping.

[30:22] Death enter fires the ball like dragon and D&D.

[30:28] It's the coolest upper play field I've seen.

[30:34] Okay. You guys are like...

[30:36] Have you guys forgotten?

[30:38] Let me show you guys something.

[30:41] Hold on a second.

[30:48] Hold on a second.

[31:10] Let's do this.

[31:20] Let's do this.

[31:21] Just...

[31:22] I think everyone forgot.

[31:25] Oh.

[31:33] I know this is like the early building.

[31:35] This is funny.

[31:36] It's funny looking bass after.

[31:39] This is not funny.

[31:42] It's a wood libel.

[31:51] It's a spinning dictate.

[31:55] Merocket beads collected.

[31:59] Governor's part.

[32:05] I even think like Potter just like...

[32:08] I mean, pirates was a little bit, you know, the sound, like, feel, I think came through a little bit more than that.

[32:13] It's fine, people.

[32:15] I'm happy.

[32:17] I'm happy this game is finally out because now we can stop speculating.

[32:23] I am not sure when predators coming out.

[32:27] I think that's going to be the next one we get.

[32:29] I think we get it this week, gang.

[32:31] I think we get it this week.

[32:33] I think we get it this week.

[32:37] You know, you're not just...

[32:40] I'm curious when you...

[32:42] People say that...

[32:45] I've been saying mix things about this game.

[32:48] Things I really like.

[32:49] Things I don't.

[32:50] Why is that?

[32:51] I'm not just negative.

[32:52] If I had to give this game a score right now, just from what I've seen, I think it's a B.

[33:00] I don't think this is an A plus game.

[33:03] And I'll tell you why.

[33:04] It's not even about...

[33:05] I don't even care about the media clips.

[33:06] I just think...

[33:07] I think it's kind of like...

[33:09] It's kind of got not much in it.

[33:12] And I don't know why people don't understand that's why...

[33:15] Gang, there's a reason why they didn't take anything out of the base level.

[33:19] Because there's nothing to take out.

[33:21] And I just think this thing needed something much more magical in it.

[33:26] There's no balls flying through the air.

[33:28] There's no crazy use of like magic wands.

[33:31] There's no like...

[33:33] There's no magic happening.

[33:35] There's a diverter.

[33:36] And that's it.

[33:37] And I don't get why everybody...

[33:39] Like gets mad when I say that.

[33:41] Like why?

[33:42] Why should Harry Potter, a world of magic and spells and vault the mortes and battles?

[33:49] Like this...

[33:50] This looks like Willy Wonka guy.

[33:53] He's like...

[33:54] Literally.

[33:55] It's just...

[33:57] You could replace that spinning staircase with something else and you have another game.

[34:00] There's not even like...

[34:01] Think about it.

[34:02] You could change one thing and it would be any other theme in the world.

[34:06] And you wouldn't even have a...

[34:08] You know what I'm saying?

[34:09] It's not like...

[34:10] Oh, that's...

[34:11] I just...

[34:13] It's just...

[34:14] You know...

[34:15] There.

[34:25] A few years ago I felt the best way...

[34:28] The best was yet to come and pinball after the last several releases.

[34:32] I think...

[34:33] Nick, I think you hid it, man.

[34:35] And people are like,

[34:36] Well, you're negative, Knit.

[34:37] I'm like, dude, it's the game, man.

[34:40] The games have all become so expensive and they removed so much of the magic.

[34:46] And...

[34:48] It's just...

[34:49] I don't know...

[34:50] I actually think King Kong's got way more in it mechanically than this game.

[34:55] I do.

[34:56] I do.

[34:57] I don't know which one shoots better because I haven't played Harry Potter yet.

[35:01] Kong shoots fine.

[35:03] It shoots, you know, great shooter.

[35:05] But I think King Kong's got way more interesting stuff to look at as well.

[35:12] Both games don't make me want to buy him, but I'm just going to say,

[35:17] like Kong's got more mechanically happening.

[35:21] And if this doesn't show new...

[35:29] Well, you know, Gang, it's crazy to me that you can get the same game for 10 grand.

[35:35] I actually...

[35:38] I'm so...

[35:40] I mean, let's just pull this up, hold on.

[35:43] I'm so disappointed in the top or by...

[35:45] I mean, like, Gang, it's like...

[35:47] It's like...

[35:55] You know, when you think about...

[36:01] Am I allowed to show this?

[36:03] Is this going to make people mad too?

[36:05] Is this being mean? Is this being cruel?

[36:08] Is this being unfair?

[36:11] The hell is this thing?

[36:13] The hell is that?

[36:16] Like, what am I looking at?

[36:19] It's like...

[36:21] It's like what happens when you...

[36:23] When you sign the interns at Jersey Jack a project and they come back with this.

[36:27] This is what you're going to put on top of your lifelong dream, pinball game.

[36:34] This.

[36:36] Okay.

[36:38] All right, Jersey Jack never cuts corners.

[36:41] Billionaire, backer.

[36:44] This is what you stick on top of your game.

[36:53] Any...

[36:55] I could do better, killing could do better than this in...

[37:00] With crayons.

[37:03] The hell is this?

[37:06] And this is my thing with Jersey Jack pinball.

[37:08] Is how did that entire company walk by this thing for years and be like...

[37:13] No, no, no, no, no.

[37:15] No, what are we doing?

[37:17] We could get...

[37:19] That sculpt on the left is 700 bucks.

[37:23] That's 700 dollars to you and me.

[37:25] It doesn't cost them 700 dollars to make that sculpt.

[37:28] You're telling me they could not in the years they spent making this game.

[37:34] Simply go to an official Harry Potter license sculpt maker who's made and sold thousands of dollars.

[37:42] Thousands of of these to make a topper for them.

[37:48] And light up the put candle LEDs in the windows.

[37:52] But this is what they made.

[37:55] And my point is like...

[37:58] And I've always said this like details matter.

[38:00] And this is like putting on a tuxedo and then wearing a clown hat with a little propeller on the on the top of it.

[38:10] This is atrocious.

[38:14] And again, I know you don't play the toppers.

[38:18] But my point being is that's always been my thing at Jersey Jack.

[38:22] It's like why does a company still after 12 years just do stuff like this?

[38:30] Yeah, look at the spooky evil dead topper.

[38:36] I just...

[38:38] I don't know how you mess up the easiest things and when you mess up the easiest things.

[38:42] So here's what happened. They made this topper and they weren't happy with it.

[38:47] And they tried to get Leora to make them a topper.

[38:51] Well, why'd you wait so long to get Leora?

[38:53] Because they saw the topper on Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[38:56] And why is Leora making...

[39:00] Why can Melvin at Dutch Pimball X

[39:04] get Leora to make a stunning topper?

[39:08] This would have been one of Leora's biggest cash days ever.

[39:14] Because imagine the amount of orders they would have had a place.

[39:19] Because they're gonna make thousands of CEs.

[39:22] And so now thousands of people have to like upgrade their topper because they got this crap on top.

[39:34] Let me just say this. Unboxing videos are boring.

[39:41] I just watched one on Harry Potter's E. It just boring.

[39:44] Just wow, look. It's got legs. It's got a back box.

[39:49] So yeah. Did they nail it? Am I being too mean?

[39:52] Am I the Debbie Downer or is this just like what's happening here?

[40:00] Doesn't it feel like King Kong.

[40:02] No one even cares anymore.

[40:04] You know, you feel that? I feel that.

[40:06] Does anyone even like talk about King Kong anymore?

[40:10] Did anyone even start talking about Dune?

[40:13] Is there even a conversation going on around Dune?

[40:17] I don't even know what's happening with that game.

[40:19] Like is anyone even getting it?

[40:21] Like what? The game came out now. Like what six, seven weeks ago?

[40:25] I'm going to confirm for you right now.

[40:30] Confirm.

[40:32] All right. This is going to be John Borg's game. Get ready.

[40:38] And you tell me that you're not going to want this over Harry Potter. Get ready.

[40:46] All right.

[40:56] All right. So you guys have your Harry Potter.

[41:01] And this will be coming out from Stern Pimble next.

[41:07] And you tell me which one you'd rather have. All right.

[41:13] All right.

[41:23] Why is there a post game? All right.

[41:28] All right.

[41:40] Real handless.

[41:42] We'll take the long way.

[41:45] And you and they won't mute these clips.

[41:58] We gotta do something R2.

[42:05] Really? Really? It's a soul.

[42:15] Movie's eight.

[42:35] I will do it.

[42:54] Who's that?

[42:58] itueth...

[43:32] Oh

[44:02] Hi

[44:17] My connection is unstable

[44:21] Um, I don't know gang

[44:25] I think it's a great time to be a buyer

[44:29] I saw people debating like name it pro do pros are five to six thousand dollars come on this game's ten grand for the pro version

[44:37] So don't you can't like it's apples the oranges

[44:42] Cassie is feeling better. He got a case of hand foot mouth disease. He didn't get that bad though

[44:49] Nobody got infected

[44:52] Yeah, like it's like I said in my show gang that modern pinball now is really a

[44:58] Lot more about the software than the hardware and the game is changed and it's just it's it's the new reality

[45:07] Jenga's you've seen Harry Potter and you've seen predator which one in your honest opinion

[45:14] Are you still excited for predator or do you think it's gonna be able you know what's it's competing it's competing with

[45:22] I know that jang is knows that Arnold is not in predator, but he won't say anything see what we could ask him right now live hey jang is

[45:29] Yes or no is Arnold in predator right and it's like the silence

[45:36] Means he's not in it because if he was in it, he says say yes, right? Why wouldn't you say yeah? Of course I got it's predator

[45:43] You can't wait for you guys to see it like see we all know what the theme is so I don't know why he won't say I don't know yes you do

[45:51] He's not in it he's not in it we all know we all know we all know so

[46:05] Harry Potter week

[46:08] The launch was fine you know retro Ralph and I were talking yesterday he did the feature at video

[46:14] feature at video

[46:17] You know it's funny should we pull it up let me let me pull up the feature at video

[46:25] Let's see history

[46:29] Do do

[46:33] Do do do

[46:39] Where is

[46:44] Harry Potter pinball

[46:47] Harry Potter pinball

[46:55] The feature at

[47:03] This is this is I need a feature at

[47:08] Here we go

[47:10] 18,000 views well done

[47:30] All right, you know what he is I'm going to show this because like most people won't notice it now you can't unsee it so you're doing you get invited

[47:38] Right you get the early access you get to shoot the game you get to interview the team you get to put together the content that's going to get all the views you know

[47:48] You're pretty near the pinball content space and now you're the guy like right is that Betty didn't do it?

[47:54] It wasn't anyone you know Carrie Hardy it wasn't Jason nap it was retro Ralph and

[48:01] You know so all of this was his it was a lot of work like he was telling me a lot of work to do it so much so

[48:08] That Ralph forgot to do one thing

[48:12] You ready

[48:14] Once you see it you can't unsee it

[48:19] Here we go

[48:21] Here we go he's going to kill me

[48:25] He forgot to take the keys

[48:31] Out of the back box

[48:34] My God

[48:39] Ralph you had one job

[48:43] Take the keys

[48:46] Out of the back

[48:48] I could just see like letter letter being like why the F are there keys

[48:55] I was going to say like you know I was going to I was joking like should we should should be called back box Ralph I think back box Ralph could be a new you know just an alternate nickname

[49:11] Chris leaving the keys in one of the second shot is bad

[49:15] Um

[49:20] Now it's just funny it's funny you know we're all just having fun guys like nobody is

[49:25] Thank you for the five bucks

[49:29] I think you did a great job on the video the only thing I was like why is everybody talking like to the side like is that how you do interviews

[49:38] I guess so I don't know I haven't done any I haven't shot any featureettes like that so I wouldn't want to do all the work to be honest

[49:47] Um

[49:49] I think it's a it's funny you know because in the end I've noticed that when these games come out

[49:56] It's just it's fun because what it does is it's just hyper charges

[50:01] Something new for all of us to talk about and we have a lot of fun. It's great for content. It's great for conversation

[50:07] Um, and I think people have a hard time with me just giving Harry Potter a B like they have a hard time with that like that's not a bad score

[50:17] I'll tell you what I really like about Harry Potter. Okay, let me for those of you who think I'm just I'm not crap it on the game and again

[50:23] If you listen to my free show, I say a lot of nice things about the game

[50:27] I think the game shoots great. I think the artwork on the CE is stunning and phenomenal and the story behind it is absolutely incredible

[50:36] I think the um, you know, the fast gameplay is what Jersey Jack needs more of and I think that's great and it's exciting

[50:45] I think the you know the music by David and what's in there musically is good

[50:52] I like that stuff and you know, I think they're the overall display of the game is beautiful

[50:58] What I don't like about the game again, it's more like the muted clip stuff. I just don't like that

[51:03] I think the sound effects and the call outs are so willy-wank a jackpot like slot machine sounding that it's a put it's a turn off because I think when I close my eyes

[51:14] and listen to this game, it sounds more like willy-wank and the chocolate factory and less like Harry Potter

[51:19] and I think that the topers you know how I feel about the toper it's just embarrassing

[51:23] If I were Jersey Jack, I would hold off on putting topers on the games and see they should have done that

[51:29] They should have said like like we're not happy with the toper we're gonna ship the games without topers

[51:34] and then you know order some from someone better and everyone would rather wait for a great toper then get that crap

[51:42] Okay, and I don't like the lack of mechs and magic in the game

[51:50] I don't see the magic and in the mechs and I don't see anything creatively that felt like a real, real challenging thing to do

[51:59] I get that the diverter staircase sends the ball in 13 different directions, I get that

[52:05] It's cool, just that should have been the second or third mech that wowed us, not the main mech

[52:11] and that's and that's my take on Potter

[52:14] It's a be game I think the layout is like a B plus a minus

[52:21] I think the artwork on the CE is an A plus I think the the integration of it all is like a B minus

[52:30] because of all the muted stuff again it's just my opinion I think the sounds and the callouts are kind of like I

[52:36] David can't overcome the wonka like slot machine stuff happening so I don't know if they're gonna fix that but that feels very

[52:43] You know, I don't know I'm like it's like a B minus in that territory

[52:47] So yeah, like I don't know like are people really thinking that this layout is as good as like what we've seen recently from Jack Danger and Keith Thouin or Steve Richie's Elton John

[52:58] I don't see it I'm not even sure I think this I don't I haven't played it yet so I don't know

[53:06] So I

[53:08] Will play it Monday this game is supposed to arrive at automated

[53:13] So I'm expecting to maybe play the game on Monday

[53:20] This is better really okay

[53:24] All right

[53:26] Elemental so you I look I'm I would be the biggest loser if I started arguing about gameplay and I haven't played it

[53:33] So like I I'm just

[53:36] Gonna go off of like what other people are saying but everything is subjective

[53:42] Do I agree it's Eric's best yeah cuz his other stuff I think I think Eric's games in order of what looks like to be the best layouts are

[53:52] Harry Potter

[53:54] then Pirates of the Caribbean

[53:57] then

[53:58] Godfather then guns and roses but man like

[54:02] Eric's I

[54:04] Think Steve Richie helped for sure on this but yeah, but I still don't think

[54:11] Eric is a I

[54:13] Here's my thing with Eric

[54:16] Because his first game was Pirates I always expected to see similar magic in all of his games and I feel like

[54:24] He hasn't delivered anything

[54:27] Mechanically as interesting as his first game and so that's my thing with Eric is like I always feel like

[54:34] He's he hasn't he hasn't like ascended into making magical mechs

[54:40] I think his I don't know if you it's sad, but like his kind of

[54:45] His pedigree is like he couldn't they couldn't do the triple spinning desk they yanked it out

[54:50] They didn't get the treasure chest to open up and since then his games have been somewhat like empty mechanically

[54:57] So I don't know what to tell you guns and roses didn't really have he's like he really does love diverting the ball

[55:04] I'll say that I think guns and roses

[55:12] I mean looking I mean again, I'm very subjective here, but looking down at guns and roses to me is

[55:18] More interesting been looking down at Potter. I know Potter shoots better. So don't kill me there

[55:24] I also think like G and R like what what it does do well and the wow it does create I

[55:31] Haven't seen anything like I haven't seen anything that the Potter machine does yet

[55:36] That is wowing me. So let me ask you guys that question because it's like it. Yeah, it's just a subjective

[55:41] We're just having a discussion here

[55:43] What what is wowing you when you look at Harry Potter below the glass?

[55:50] I just want to hear from you where we're just talking about magic and wow and just moments that make you get

[56:04] Is 96 modes too many?

[56:10] Yes, but not if you're a Potter fan and

[56:14] Not if they make it so it looks like it's gonna be easy to enjoy those 96 because I think the way you know

[56:21] You select between the six movies. I like that. So I think you're getting you know, I like that shoes your own adventure

[56:26] So it's like you know as long as they're satisfying my only fear with 96 is just like they're gonna be

[56:35] Not as satisfying as people want yeah, buddy

[56:41] Come here say hi

[56:43] Come say hi. Hold on hold on don't touch the mic. Can you say hi? Can you wave to everybody?

[56:49] Can you say Harry Potter pinball?

[56:54] Can you say welcome to the jungle?

[56:57] We got what we got

[57:01] We got mighty pups. I don't know if that's the next line

[57:06] Would you pay $10,000 for a Harry Potter pinball?

[57:09] No, nope. Okay. Yes. Okay

[57:14] Okay, tell mommy that she want me to meet you guys somewhere

[57:17] Grace mommy if she wants me to meet you guys somewhere

[57:22] Let's go now. Yeah, okay, we're gonna go in a little bit

[57:26] Open the garage door

[57:28] I hold on again. Give me five more minutes five minutes. Nope. Okay. Don't get it

[57:36] It's gonna pretend to drive

[57:39] You

[57:46] Got it ready

[57:53] I love being dead a boys

[57:57] And if you have girls, it's it's awesome too

[58:00] He just turned the lights on

[58:02] Whenever I get back into my car after kill Ian's been in it

[58:05] I'm always like he messes with everything that it's something

[58:08] Something's always way off

[58:16] Kill Ian don't do that don't do that

[58:22] He's so cheeky like he's so like he just knows

[58:27] Had a mess um

[58:29] How's everybody doing? I've got I got to agree Guns and Rose is not as good as a shooter

[58:34] But it does have more mechanical satisfying show

[58:38] I'm asking what you guys are saying was wow

[58:42] The bouncing car in the tree is wow. Yeah, you're joking there

[58:54] Hold on a second game

[58:56] But you gotta get up

[59:07] Where's the map where the math go

[59:15] Come on get the map

[59:21] Oh my god kill

[59:26] Okay here

[59:37] He would never be a good pinball owner because he's so OCD that he would like every little

[59:42] Come on

[59:46] Well

[59:56] All right

[01:00:08] Okay, we can get another one

[01:00:12] Oh, all right, did we get moments of wow?

[01:00:15] Dude, did we get any

[01:00:18] Um accept my oldest son. Okay, let's see

[01:00:21] I

[01:00:22] Find myself looking back to theater of magic pinball

[01:00:26] Even erosmith with a flying ball, right? I mean did how about the milk can shot and Houdini

[01:00:32] Houdini's got way more magic in it than Harry Potter gain the ball never disappears

[01:00:38] Can we stand that fact for a moment

[01:00:42] The ball never disappears

[01:00:44] It never flies through the air

[01:00:47] It never gets transformed it never goes in one

[01:00:52] Place and comes out another mysteriously

[01:00:56] I don't understand why everyone's just like this games of masterpiece this games pack this games loaded

[01:01:03] I don't understand why am I am are you seeing something? I'm not

[01:01:08] It drops into the cauldron and no it it just passes through Jesse

[01:01:12] Doesn't stay in the cauldron

[01:01:15] The three balls don't like you know what I'm saying? It's just a pass through. It's just that's not that's is that magical

[01:01:25] And then out the Jesse it's this big

[01:01:28] It draw it it passes through something this big

[01:01:31] If it went into the cauldron it should have gone into a subway

[01:01:35] And then that subway should have had the ball reemerge somewhere else. How cool would that have been

[01:01:41] Do we not forget like Wizard of Oz has a flying monkey

[01:01:45] Has a witch that comes up from underneath the play field

[01:01:49] Has a house that spins an upper two upper play feels I thought this had three levels of play. Where's the third level of play

[01:01:55] Is there a third level of play?

[01:02:00] A witch hunt

[01:02:05] Yeah, who did he shoots like crap?

[01:02:10] The toppers that their level

[01:02:19] Um

[01:02:23] Okay, so do you guys actually think I've been too critical of Harry Potter?

[01:02:28] I haven't been that critical. Right. It's a it's a B. A B is a good score, right?

[01:02:33] Yeah

[01:02:37] Isn't I don't know I don't know put this game next to dialed in

[01:02:44] I'm just gonna say this game. I actually think Toy Story has more wow

[01:02:50] In it and I think the Duke Kaboom jump is just more looks to be more fun and wow and like even though that's not even much but

[01:02:58] It's fine gang. I mean look. I think there's those tremendous pressure on me, but I don't even know by who

[01:03:07] Maybe my myself to just find more peace of mind in life and I believe me

[01:03:12] I'm not waking up in a bad mood because of the Harry Potter

[01:03:14] I think the game is is is gonna make a lot of people happy. I think it's good for pinball

[01:03:18] It's gonna bring more people into the hobby

[01:03:20] Which might bring more people to canadus pinball podcast more people to hang out here

[01:03:25] So it's a good thing for pinball

[01:03:27] It's a good thing for pinball

[01:03:29] I think the pressure is on stern stern's Kong is not selling like they thought it would

[01:03:34] Elis are still not sold out. I think barrels of fun. I don't know what I don't know how they get people

[01:03:40] Reignited into dune. I don't know how you do it now

[01:03:44] I yeah, I'd rather have a because the problem with dune is it's expensive, right?

[01:03:50] It's like and I get that they you know they give you a lot in it and I love that they

[01:03:55] They sync up their assets 100%

[01:03:57] But it's just like you know you're asking people for 12 grand now

[01:04:01] And I think the one game that did it the best is evil dead and that's see my my thing is this is

[01:04:08] You know the Harry Potter orders are gonna be tremendous the wait to get one might be long

[01:04:14] And you know, we're gonna get maybe jaws 50th in a couple weeks. Then we might get star wars

[01:04:20] We're gonna get back to the future eventually. We're gonna get beetle juice

[01:04:24] There's a lot still coming. It's all very expensive

[01:04:28] There's so much competition now, you know because if you're stern and you know the last thing you want though is

[01:04:34] You know thousands of orders going to a competitor because

[01:04:38] Those that's potentially thousands of orders. You're no longer gonna get

[01:04:42] And the entire market now is so saturated and I'm worried about

[01:04:48] A lot of people's like

[01:04:50] nest eggs and the world economy and I mean I'm worried

[01:04:54] I'm you know, I'm always worried about my job because

[01:04:57] That's what my industry's turned into it's pretty brutal out there and

[01:05:01] Everyone's just grinding it out and holding on

[01:05:04] But nobody has any job security anymore in corporate America and maybe they never did

[01:05:08] But I it's much worse now than it ever was before

[01:05:11] so

[01:05:13] You know there's only so much you can do I feel like I have the skills to keep doing what I'm doing even if I do

[01:05:17] somewhere else and and

[01:05:20] But you know, I'm saving money now. I'm still spending on stuff

[01:05:25] But like again, I'd rather spend 15,000 dollars a year going out and doing experiential stuff versus like Harry Potter Pimball

[01:05:33] You guys look I can get in my car and Monday can drive 30 minutes to automate it

[01:05:37] um, you know, Frank's gonna be there

[01:05:39] I think we're just gonna play at night when it's closed down and I might just go and like spend all evening playing Harry Potter

[01:05:44] And look if I come back and I mean is if I come back after playing Harry Potter

[01:05:50] And I have a blast right and it's I'm going in

[01:05:55] To the game

[01:05:57] With a very open mind because I know what to expect with the clips. I again, I want to just

[01:06:02] See if I can get connect with the game if it will click with me and I want to spend a few hours on it

[01:06:07] And just see how I you know how it makes me feel

[01:06:11] I want to go into the game too with a little bit of a knowledge of like what to shoot for and how to play the game

[01:06:16] So I'm not just like

[01:06:17] You know confused and flipping around for an hour or two

[01:06:35] Where is Padredi's game um

[01:06:37] I

[01:06:38] Don't know it's supposed to be a toad in remake

[01:06:48] Did anyone here buy dune?

[01:06:50] We have a hundred and thirty one people anyone here buy dune. I'm just curious like

[01:06:54] I don't see many people like in the owners club and I don't see a lot of conversation

[01:07:01] I mean podder conversations

[01:07:03] It's starting to peter out also the podder conversation is you know it's becoming balanced and

[01:07:08] I

[01:07:09] I like reading what people's thoughts are I'm I know you guys like enjoying my point of view my opinions

[01:07:14] And everyone just has an opinion right it's it's ultimately I think what I like to is there's no formal with this game at all

[01:07:22] People keep reaching out to me like would you get it should I get up my dude just go play it just go play it

[01:07:28] There it's never gonna be hard to get a hairy potter in any trim you want jersey jack is just blown up the

[01:07:35] Fomo and the collectibility

[01:07:37] But I get it's like who cares right

[01:07:41] Who cares

[01:07:44] What do you think jgp's next game is uh it's a good question

[01:07:49] I heard it's a

[01:07:51] 90s

[01:07:53] property

[01:07:55] It's not matrix

[01:07:59] I really do think it might be sonic because it's not

[01:08:03] It's not a music pin

[01:08:05] It's not top-gun

[01:08:07] So we'll see I don't I don't think it's beastie boys

[01:08:19] Yeah, I've heard that some of the dunes in the wild are having issues like I was talking

[01:08:26] An operator and he said two coils burnt out and

[01:08:31] That's a little concerning and maybe one of the reasons why there's sort of

[01:08:37] Slowly releasing them. I think they're using the ones on location to problem solve

[01:08:44] Game issues. That's why customers really aren't getting doon yet

[01:08:47] Oh

[01:08:52] Say by the bill would be I think we need more like comedy show pinball machines like the the office would be so funny like

[01:08:59] Heck I feel like a sign fell pinball machine would sell

[01:09:03] You know what I'm saying like

[01:09:05] Lime in lime encoding a sign fell pinball machine would would be amazing

[01:09:10] What can you do to make a beastie boy a good beastie boys pin

[01:09:14] um

[01:09:16] I mean you know in the end like music pins are kind of all like easy to do

[01:09:20] Just make it satisfying to shoot and play the damn music. I mean it like that's literally all it really takes

[01:09:27] Make it fun to shoot and play the damn music

[01:09:33] So yeah

[01:09:37] Three stew just guys we're trying to make money here. Peewee's big adventure would be great

[01:09:40] Absolutely

[01:09:42] I actually think I would love it if spooky made um Edward sys or hands

[01:09:47] I think Edward sys or hands would be the perfect pinball machine

[01:09:51] I think the scenes from it you could ease talk about a world under glass gang

[01:09:56] the ice castles the

[01:09:59] The the hedges you know transformed into dinosaurs

[01:10:03] The houses the row of houses down the block could be in the game

[01:10:07] um

[01:10:08] You know you've got so much in that and the music of Danny elfman and and oh

[01:10:14] mg Edward sys or hands would be so special

[01:10:18] And that's just yeah all the Adam Sandler movies

[01:10:24] Would be funny tropic thunder would be an amazing pin. Can you imagine tropic thunder pin?

[01:10:30] I mean it would they would never make that movie zoolander would be

[01:10:34] um

[01:10:35] How good would a zoolander pin be

[01:10:38] Hey

[01:10:39] You know

[01:10:41] Got the magnum orbit only turns turns right

[01:10:48] So everybody look we're gonna go to this porch jam now um this was fun today fun today

[01:10:54] Uh lots more will come of Harry Potter over the weekend as people unbox it today

[01:10:59] And I think it's gonna be a well-received pin. I think they're gonna sell a ton of them

[01:11:05] I think I've been fair

[01:11:06] I've got mixed feelings about the game and it's more about the way Jersey jack

[01:11:11] uses

[01:11:12] It's screen

[01:11:14] uses the assets and the sounds they have I think

[01:11:18] I think they're kind of just making every game just feels like it's

[01:11:22] Delivered in the same way now regardless of theme it just comes at you like a Willy Wonka

[01:11:28] Slot machine and I just don't like it like think I think but that's their design approach

[01:11:33] That's their UI like that's how they

[01:11:37] That's how they envision the best way to translate a theme into a fun pinball experience

[01:11:43] Some people might like it some don't um in the camp of I don't really it's not really jiving with me

[01:11:48] I think they have the most beautiful games. I think they're always stunning to stand over

[01:11:54] Avatar is another stunning game. So is Elton

[01:11:57] So we're all all their games are stunning. I think where their games fall down is

[01:12:02] I think sometimes they lack soul and they lack heart and it just the games just don't click with you the way other machines do

[01:12:11] and I you know when I saw people say like oh this game is better than Lord of the Rings

[01:12:16] Stick to your last. I would I've seen enough of Harry Potter to know

[01:12:20] That I would still rather have a Lord of the Rings game because of all the

[01:12:25] The way that game connects you to the films the way the mechs in the game connect to the moments of magic

[01:12:33] The way the game

[01:12:34] Invites you to with the way you get to multi balls in Lord of the Rings and the energy when those multi balls happen

[01:12:42] I'm still feeling in that like weird sort of

[01:12:44] Caval like you when you start these multi balls in Harry Potter the way marks voice

[01:12:48] It's just it just doesn't feel like in occasion like a moment

[01:12:53] It just you know Avatar had the same problem this game seems to have the same it's just you're just kind of like

[01:12:59] Going through it and it's just I don't know and that's my worry. It just feels like it's not an event

[01:13:06] Like it's not like wow. It's just

[01:13:09] Well, you know when you when you hear like the call out to Lord of the Rings versus this like you know again just saying

[01:13:18] Just saying all right everybody look

[01:13:22] Have a great Saturday go do some stuff outside. You know how I feel pimples and winter sport

[01:13:28] I'm happy you guys

[01:14:35] They're just more expensive

[01:14:38] We've all been ghast lit if this game came out like

[01:14:42] Wizard of Oz has so much more in it

[01:14:45] Just remember that six five hundred dollars you've been ghast lit later
