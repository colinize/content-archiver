[00:00] It's funny, the group of people that do not use quality in their marketing are the Japanese.

[00:06] You never see them using quality in their marketing.

[00:09] It's only the American companies that do.

[00:11] And yet, if you ask people on the street which products have the best reputation for quality,

[00:16] they will tell you the Japanese products.

[00:17] Now, why is that? How could that be?

[00:19] The answer is because customers don't form their opinions on quality from marketing.

[00:26] They don't form their opinions on quality from who won the Deming Award or who won the Baldrige Award.

[00:32] They form their opinions on quality from their own experience with the products or the services.

[00:37] And so, one can spend enormous amounts of money on quality.

[00:40] One can win every quality award there is.

[00:42] And yet, if your products don't live up to it, customers will not keep that opinion for long in their minds.

[00:56] It's the darling of the rest of our lives.

[01:01] Celts, Cactus, Cactus, Cactus, Cactus, Cactus, Cactus.

[01:06] You know, one word, quality.

[01:09] And it means so much now in the world of Pinball more than it ever has before.

[01:14] And if you think about it, Pinball is the most expensive it's ever been.

[01:18] So once you raise prices to the point we're at now, where the price of entry for a fully featured game

[01:26] is around $10,000.

[01:28] You add a few accessories, you get the LE, you're now somewhere $13, $15, $16,500 with shipping and taxes.

[01:36] And when you're a customer of modern Pinball and you're spending this much money and everybody,

[01:42] it's a lot of money.

[01:43] I mean, we have the price debate on every single episode, it seems like, these days.

[01:48] And you unbox your Pinball machine, right?

[01:50] That moment, because remember, the unboxing moment is that Christmas morning for all of these buyers.

[01:57] For you, for me, it doesn't matter if you're a newbie or you've been in this hobby for a really long time.

[02:04] There is that moment when your new inbox game slides out of that box.

[02:10] And if there's no damage to the box, you expect that game to not only be flawless when it comes to the decals and the artwork,

[02:20] and the T-moldings and the coin doors and the coin boxes and all the bolts are the same.

[02:25] This and that, you also expect the game to work, to play all the mechanisms to be functioning.

[02:31] You expect the company to have put that game in a box, brand new, in a pristine mint condition.

[02:39] Now look, things happen when games are sent in boxes and shipped around the country.

[02:45] We all know that these things are three, four hundred pounds, connectors come loose.

[02:51] There's acceptable things you might have to do out of the box that everybody should be willing to do.

[02:59] But then there are things that are unacceptable.

[03:02] And I think that's where we're at now, as I'm looking at this black and white Godzilla from Stern Pinball.

[03:10] And some of the issues that these new inbox owners are experiencing are things that one hundred percent should have been caught at the factory.

[03:22] And what these issues are telegraphing for a lot of us, and this is not a good week to have this be the thing that people are talking about as Stern is getting ready to launch a new game,

[03:35] and expect us to pony up all this money all over again.

[03:39] I think a lot of people are starting to realize a very simple, fundamental thing.

[03:46] That Stern Pinball is a ginormous, mass-produced product.

[03:51] They do not have the quality of the Japanese.

[03:54] There clearly isn't someone going over each of these games, making sure they're made exactly to the standard and the quality.

[04:04] That Stern expects of its products.

[04:07] It feels like things are being rushed out the door.

[04:11] It feels like there is nobody that is looking up and down a machine and going around it and making sure there's no blemishes.

[04:19] There's no scratches.

[04:21] It's got all the right pieces and parts, the right color.

[04:25] Everything should be this way before it goes to a customer.

[04:30] And instead we're seeing the opposite.

[04:33] We're seeing things that should have been caught at the factory, and we're seeing those headaches passed on to the customer.

[04:41] And the problem in the modern world, which is good about technology, and this is good about pin side,

[04:45] is you can no longer hide these defects.

[04:48] People are going to see them, they're going to share them, and we know that people with game issues will always have the megaphone and speak the loudest.

[04:57] Now the problem now with Stern Pinball is these games are no longer cheap.

[05:02] We no longer approach these games with any cheap and cheerful mindset.

[05:06] We look at these games and you call something a premium.

[05:09] What does that mean?

[05:10] Does it mean anything?

[05:11] Remember, premium is a marketing term.

[05:14] You feel like you're getting something better, something that's more expensive,

[05:18] something that is a higher level of quality and a higher level of craftsmanship.

[05:23] And the truth is, you're not.

[05:24] It is, as Steve Jobs would say, just a marketing word.

[05:28] Remember when Mirko put that quality seal on his playfields?

[05:33] Oh, and by the way, happy to report that Dutch Pinball and DPX have dropped Mirko playfields moving forward.

[05:42] So we are no longer going to have Mirko in Back to the Future or in Alice in Wonderland.

[05:48] I think the new company is called like Baahumbug.

[05:51] Interesting day for a company making playfields.

[05:54] You hope people don't feel that way after they open their games, but I talked to Melvin,

[05:58] and they're very happy with the quality of these new playfields as they move away from Mirko.

[06:03] But all of that doesn't matter.

[06:05] You don't care about a quality seal.

[06:08] I don't want to even hear the word quality in Stern's marketing.

[06:12] You just want the product to be of great quality.

[06:16] That is how you establish your brand as something that people don't have to worry about.

[06:21] You're going to unbox it.

[06:23] You wrote a check for $9,600, $9,700 for these Godzilla's, and you pull it out of a box,

[06:30] and it should be perfect, at least for the most part, right?

[06:34] And so let's talk about what's happening right now.

[06:36] There are customer games that have gone out and people have unboxed them,

[06:41] and the decals on the cabinet either are wrinkling around where the bolts are,

[06:48] which is most likely because Stern is rushing these games into boxes and not allowing,

[06:54] and not allowing those decals to sort of settle before the bolts are put through.

[06:58] Because think about it, the bolts are putting pressure down

[07:01] where that artwork is touching the wood, so maybe it's a timing thing.

[07:05] But more concerning than that is some of these games are leaving with scratches that happened

[07:11] at the factory, and you could see it.

[07:13] And it's almost like whoever is on the line over there at Stern,

[07:17] who's supposed to be looking at these things, is almost turning a blind's eye

[07:22] because they don't want to get in trouble because they allow that to happen.

[07:26] You know, think about it, whenever we see those videos of two guys with the squeegee

[07:32] putting on the decals, and what happens when they throw one on and maybe someone's wrist watch

[07:37] moves across the decal, I mean, that's what it looks like, some of those scratches.

[07:41] You ever have a, you ever move a metal watch across the surface?

[07:44] Like it can create that hairline scratch.

[07:47] And so I think somewhere in this process, some scratch is happening,

[07:51] and nobody wants to say anything, right?

[07:54] But there is clearly not somebody at the end of the line.

[07:58] And this is the most important part of the quality control that happens on a pinball machine,

[08:02] is somebody, before that game goes into a box, has to turn the game on,

[08:08] make sure everything works, make sure the black and white is in CPO.

[08:12] We're going to talk about that, needs to make sure that there's not like wrinkles and scratches

[08:17] on the cabinet artwork.

[08:19] Also needs to make sure this was another thing someone posted on their red T molding on Godzilla.

[08:25] There's like all of this black material that stain the T molding that came from the factory

[08:31] that the guy can't remove.

[08:33] Now look, that's an easy fix, but it's more about what that telegraphs,

[08:38] that nobody went over that machine and saw that before it went into a box.

[08:45] And that's the main point people.

[08:47] It's not about whether or not this is going to happen to your machine,

[08:51] and you are one of the lucky ones.

[08:54] It's more about that stern doesn't have someone over there that is catching this stuff.

[09:00] And what does that mean for the world's largest pinball company,

[09:05] that is selling now $9,700 premiums, $13,000 le's that they're not capable internally of catching

[09:15] these things.

[09:16] Now I hope stern pinball is having a meeting this week and saying,

[09:20] what's going on here?

[09:21] Like whose job is this?

[09:23] Because this should not be hard to figure out.

[09:26] Like there should be specific roles over at stern where someone's job is to do nothing else,

[09:32] but catch these things.

[09:34] And the moment you pass these headaches on to customers,

[09:38] they really do become much bigger headaches for the entire company.

[09:42] Because think about it like this, you know, stern probably makes $3,000 per game.

[09:47] I think about that, right?

[09:49] And if you have quality control issues like this,

[09:52] how many people are going to not buy a future stern machine because of the quality?

[09:58] A lot more than a $30,000 a year salary,

[10:02] which is what you could probably pay somebody if their only job was to go over a pinball

[10:08] machine with a white glove.

[10:10] Like that's your job.

[10:11] Every day we make a hundred games and your job is to go over it with a white glove and catch

[10:18] any blemish that you see.

[10:20] For every blemish you catch and almost reward that person for catching more defects.

[10:26] And here is the thing, we know stern is all about the bottom line now.

[10:29] So they probably don't.

[10:31] There's probably some acceptable level of quality issues that they're willing to put

[10:37] into boxes and hoping nobody says anything.

[10:41] And that's a sad part too, is we all know for every person that speaks up,

[10:46] there are going to be people that don't speak up.

[10:48] They don't want to even think about it and they're just going to accept it.

[10:52] I can't tell you how many people in life I know that would accept a quality issue and a defect

[10:58] like we're seeing here.

[10:59] Just to give you a personal story, I told this to people on my chat.

[11:02] I bought a bunch of furniture.

[11:04] When I sold Batman SLE, I put that like $28,000 into furniture for the house.

[11:11] Beautiful bar, beautiful credenza, beautiful desks, all these things.

[11:16] A lot of the furniture I bought was from Jonathan Adler and we bought this beautiful credenza.

[11:22] It's $5,000 and we love it.

[11:25] It's like a centerpiece in our living room.

[11:27] We love it.

[11:28] It's a work of art.

[11:29] It's gorgeous.

[11:30] It's made of glass.

[11:31] I didn't realize that when I got it.

[11:32] And it's been such a focal point in my living room.

[11:36] And two weeks ago, Brenda noticed that underneath the glass on the upper right drawer,

[11:41] a bubble started to form right on the crease of the artwork that's on the credenza.

[11:47] And it was just an eyesore.

[11:49] So here I have this $5,000 credenza.

[11:52] It's not even two months old.

[11:54] And now there's a visual defect that just became a headache.

[11:59] So every time I looked at it, it was annoying.

[12:01] So I called customer service and they said, hey, you got to call the store where you bought the

[12:06] credenza from.

[12:07] Okay, that was a little annoying.

[12:09] I emailed the store the pictures two weeks ago and I will say their customer service wasn't

[12:14] the greatest at the beginning because on a Monday, I made them aware of the problem.

[12:20] Now, the thing about these issues is when you wake up with an issue, whether it's on a pinball

[12:24] machine or a credenza, every day you're staring at it.

[12:29] You want a fix and a solution immediately.

[12:32] And I think that's the thing too.

[12:33] You have to learn to be a little bit patient.

[12:36] You got to give the company some time to come up with a solution.

[12:40] But in the modern world, I will say this, customer service is terrible in the modern

[12:45] world for the most part.

[12:47] Like I got an email back that said, hey, we've sent your pictures to the furniture team

[12:52] and we will get back to you with any possible solutions.

[12:56] And just that wording alone made me so annoyed because it's like, what do you mean any possible

[13:02] solutions?

[13:03] I bought something for $5,000.

[13:06] It's defective.

[13:07] The only possible solution is a solution where you fix this.

[13:12] There's no world in which I'm just going to live with this.

[13:15] All right, so fast forward two weeks.

[13:16] I let Brenda handle this because her sweet Irish accent and disposition gets you much

[13:22] further.

[13:23] And we finally heard back and the company said, Chris, we would like to give you two options.

[13:28] One is you could live with it and keep it the way it is.

[13:31] And we will give you store credit or a partial refund or we will replace the entire unit for

[13:38] free.

[13:39] It'll just take a couple of weeks.

[13:40] We have to get you into the order banks and the shipping schedule.

[13:43] But would you like a new one or would you like the credit?

[13:46] And I thought those were two great options and I took the brand new unit.

[13:52] I don't want money back.

[13:54] I want to look at something with peace of mind.

[13:56] And so when you think about a pinball machine and you mail someone a $10,000 product, twice

[14:02] as much money as my credenza and you unbox it and the cabinet artwork is destroyed.

[14:10] It has wrinkles.

[14:12] It is scratched.

[14:13] What do you do?

[14:15] You cannot expect a customer to have to do all the work that is required.

[14:21] And it is a lot of work to replace artwork on a cabinet people.

[14:26] Like this is not an easy fix.

[14:29] It's not like a broken translate where you just slide it out and slide in the new one.

[14:34] You have to do so much work.

[14:35] You have to remove the back box.

[14:37] You have to normally turn the game on its side.

[14:40] You have to get off the original artwork and make sure it's super smooth and flat.

[14:46] And when you look at how they install it at the factory on its side with two guys that

[14:53] know exactly what they're doing in a dust free environment, all the stuff you need to do.

[14:58] And you're going to expect a pinball customer who's got this thing in his house who doesn't

[15:04] have any of the tools required to do this.

[15:06] You're going to expect that person to replace the cabinet artwork on his brand new pinball

[15:13] machine or her pinball machine.

[15:15] And I'm sorry, but I'm just going to say this.

[15:16] If you ship a game out with something like that, that customer should get a brand new game.

[15:22] I'm sorry.

[15:23] The defective game should be picked up by the distributor and sent back to Stern Pinball.

[15:29] And Stern Pinball should be the company paying for the shipping and the picking up and the

[15:34] sending back.

[15:34] But here's the thing.

[15:35] They don't want to do that.

[15:36] And I don't think distributors aren't a position to pay for those costs because then it just

[15:41] eats into their entire margins.

[15:42] But then it begs the question, what is the point of distributors in the first place if

[15:47] they are not going to help you out when something like this happens?

[15:50] Now look, it is a huge quagmire.

[15:52] It is a huge headache.

[15:54] And this is why if you just pay that guy $30,000 a year to go over each game with a white glove,

[16:02] you don't have to go down these roads.

[16:04] But the thing is this, we are down that road.

[16:07] And there are multiple people with issues on their games.

[16:10] And now the conversation around a Stern new and box game is I have to walk around it.

[16:16] I have to make sure there's nothing wrong with it.

[16:19] And if there is something wrong with it, you're going to wake up for weeks with a headache and

[16:25] possibly no solution.

[16:27] And I'm telling you right now, it's not worth it.

[16:29] Like life is too short.

[16:31] We spend this much money on these toys because these things are supposed to alleviate the

[16:37] headaches we have in life and give us a moment of enjoyment and pleasure.

[16:41] It's a toy.

[16:42] And the last thing you want is for your toys to create extra headaches to spend $10,000 on an item.

[16:50] And it arrives like this.

[16:53] And it's not just the scratches.

[16:55] Did you see this other thing?

[16:56] They're making these games and the bolts are different colors on different consumer games.

[17:02] Let's talk about that for a minute.

[17:04] If you're making Godzilla black and white, how is it that some people have black bolts in their

[17:11] cabinet and some people have silver?

[17:13] It doesn't make any sense.

[17:16] Again, what this telegraphs to me is sloppy and rushed manufacturing that is happening.

[17:23] How is that even possible?

[17:24] Aren't they're just these are the only bolts

[17:26] we're using for Godzilla cabinets?

[17:29] I don't understand how silver bolts even get anywhere near the assembly line for a Godzilla

[17:35] black and white.

[17:36] And again, it's just these little things are creating huge headaches and huge uncertainty

[17:44] when it comes to our perception of Stern's quality.

[17:47] And then the final thing is just the sepia color issue.

[17:51] And I think everyone's got this issue because Stern is using the same CPU in every single game.

[17:57] So it's not a question of like, oh, I got a good one.

[18:01] I just think depending on the lighting and the angle you take the photo,

[18:06] all of your Godzilla black and whites are going to have this sort of sepia,

[18:12] sort of yellowish brown tint to them because they're using lighting in that back box from the CPU.

[18:19] That's not a bright white.

[18:21] And so that's another thing where it's like, I kind of forgive them a little bit on that.

[18:26] You know, I don't know how that happened.

[18:28] It definitely doesn't look good when you photograph it.

[18:31] It looks terrible at some angles.

[18:33] It just looks terrible.

[18:35] But my whole issue and I've been saying this recently and I just watched Godzilla minus one,

[18:40] minus color, like old school black and white Godzilla.

[18:44] I don't even understand the marketing behind these black and white games

[18:47] because then you turn the game on and every insert is in color.

[18:51] It's just so silly.

[18:52] Like it doesn't make any sense.

[18:53] And I don't know if they're going to do this, but right now or as of right now,

[18:57] I don't think you're going to be able to turn all the clips on the back box into black and white.

[19:03] I think it's going to stay the way it stays.

[19:05] I don't even like it now.

[19:06] I think a game when it goes black and white should go all black and white.

[19:11] Yes, even the inserts, even the lighting and yes, what that means is,

[19:16] is if you want to make a special edition black and white version of a game,

[19:22] then you might have to go and adjust the code a little bit so you can telegraph what to shoot

[19:28] because you can't rely on color anymore.

[19:31] Yeah, that's a little bit more work.

[19:33] Yeah, do it.

[19:34] Yeah, because I'm spending $10,000 on this special new version of the game.

[19:40] Ladies and gentlemen, I think we all know what the answer is.

[19:44] You got to wait and see.

[19:46] Now look, think about it.

[19:47] The person who rushed and bought New Inbox Godzilla premiums,

[19:51] that person has the most risk.

[19:53] If you're someone who waits it out, not only are you going to save money,

[19:58] you're going to be able to avoid any headaches because let somebody else let the New Inbox

[20:04] person lose money, let the New Inbox person find any defects and have to deal with them.

[20:11] And then you can swoop in when the game's been overlooked because we know that the best quality

[20:18] control person Stern could possibly hire is just a customer that spends his or her hard-earned money.

[20:28] It's going to be you and me who looks over a game with much more scrutiny than Stern ever would.

[20:36] That's not the way it should be, but that's the way it is.

[20:40] When you spend your hard-earned money, you want to make sure that your car doesn't have a scratch

[20:45] or a dent in the door, or your pinball machine has all the right color bolts, that it's not missing

[20:51] the pin inside the coin box, which also that's happening.

[20:55] It's just indicative these things are going out too fast.

[21:00] Nobody's looking them over and yet they will happily take 10 grand on a freaking mass-produced

[21:07] premium that is just being rushed out the door.

[21:11] It's leaving so many people with a feeling and I feel it on pin side.

[21:15] I can see it on the Facebook comments.

[21:17] I can just feel it everywhere.

[21:19] It's over.

[21:20] Like these products do not deliver the quality for the money, the experience for the money.

[21:27] They don't deliver the mechs for the money.

[21:29] It's like, how did we get here?

[21:31] How did the entire pinball hobby transform into this super expensive, everything is so much money

[21:38] and they're acting like it's still three years ago when the COVID world was upon us?

[21:44] It's over and everyone else has to roll back prices.

[21:47] Everyone else is rethinking their strategy except pinball companies.

[21:51] Car companies are rolling their prices back.

[21:53] McDonald's is rolling back its prices.

[21:56] Everyone is doing what they can to lure consumers back.

[22:00] And yet pinball is full steam ahead with these ridiculous prices with quality control that's

[22:07] not there and there's barely anything mechanical or innovative going on in the games.

[22:13] You can put up games from 10 years ago and there was a lot more interesting stuff and games were

[22:18] half the price.

[22:19] And look, you're not going to hear this everywhere.

[22:21] Right?

[22:21] And I know you tune into Canadian Pinball Podcast and look, I'm excited to see what this X-Men game

[22:26] is going to be about.

[22:27] I'm excited for you guys to see Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, all the stuff.

[22:31] I can't wait to see Jersey Jack's next game.

[22:34] But now it's just become like, I don't even think about New Inbox.

[22:37] It's not just about space for me or money, you know, or can I scalp this thing?

[22:41] It's just like, I don't think any of these things are worth it anymore.

[22:45] I don't.

[22:45] And I think the only value I see in pinball now are the relationships I've made with each

[22:50] and every one of you.

[22:51] Like it's fun to talk about this stuff.

[22:54] It's fun to communicate with each other.

[22:55] That's where the real value is.

[22:57] And it's fun to just enjoy the games you have.

[22:59] I've been putting so much time on Guns N' Roses.

[23:02] I absolutely love it.

[23:03] I've had no issues over the last few weeks playing the game.

[23:06] I'm learning about the game.

[23:08] And when you learn about these games and you dive deeply into them, you don't need like 1530

[23:14] games.

[23:14] Like that's absolutely a name.

[23:15] Like when you see all of these, you know, Ellie's with less than 200 plays, you know,

[23:20] what does that say?

[23:21] It's like these people bought these things.

[23:23] They never really enjoyed them.

[23:25] They never played them.

[23:27] They never dive deeply into them.

[23:29] It's like weird, right?

[23:30] If you just fully immerse yourself in the few games you have that are great,

[23:35] you're never going to need more new in box.

[23:38] And I think that's where we're at.

[23:39] This hobby is not going to survive the next five years unless someone really thinks about

[23:45] where these things are priced.

[23:47] It's not going to work, especially with quality like this, especially when you pop the hood

[23:53] and there's nothing happening underneath the game.

[23:55] And then you want people to shell out 10 to $15,000 for fully featured games.

[24:01] It's not going to last much longer, everybody.

[24:03] Happy Monday, everybody.

[24:04] We're going to get there.

[24:05] I mean, this is where the fun is at for five dollars a month.

[24:08] I'm going to entertain you more than these games could ever entertain you, everybody.

[24:13] We'll talk soon, later.

[24:23] This is our lives on our day.
