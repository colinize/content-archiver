[00:00] Welcome everybody to the world's most apologetic pinball podcaster.

[00:26] It is gonna be crazy the next couple of weeks.

[00:29] Here's what we know.

[00:31] Stern Pinball is photographing its next game this week.

[00:36] It is John Borg's Star Wars.

[00:40] Is it gonna be episode 1 through 3?

[00:42] We've never had that before.

[00:45] Is it gonna be a return of a new version of episodes 4, 5 and 6?

[00:50] Now I am still on the fence.

[00:53] I don't know.

[00:54] I don't even know which one I want even more.

[00:57] Of course we all want 4, 5 and 6.

[00:59] Come on, Canada, be honest.

[01:01] But I will say if they can really nail Darth Maul pod racing, a lot of fun.

[01:09] I don't know how you get Jar Jar out of the storyline, but it could work.

[01:15] The thing is this.

[01:16] This game needs to pop.

[01:19] So this is also gonna be the game where we see the first, I think, of Stern's Spike

[01:25] 3 in some form.

[01:28] George Gomez did a great interview on the Loser Kid Pinball podcast.

[01:32] We were talking about it on Saturday.

[01:35] And apparently this is gonna be somewhat of a rolling transition into Spike 3.

[01:41] So what I think is gonna happen with Star Wars is this.

[01:44] I think we're gonna get the bigger screen, the narrower speakers, same size trans light

[01:50] that's been on all the Stern machines.

[01:53] It's still gonna look great in a lineup.

[01:55] But I don't think we're gonna get the new cabinet, which is gonna have the new expression

[02:00] lighting system built into the cabinet itself.

[02:04] So that's not gonna come on Star Wars.

[02:06] It's gonna come on the following game.

[02:09] Now, does that mean the following cornerstone game or does it mean the walking dead remastered?

[02:17] I think it's gonna be on the walking dead.

[02:20] And I think they're gonna use that in a really interesting way to drum up excitement and really

[02:26] make the new version of walking dead unlike anything that came out before.

[02:31] If you want people to buy again a new walking dead game, much like they did with Metallica

[02:39] remastered, I think we're gonna see a completely rethought out game.

[02:44] And John Borg said he spent almost as much time, not sure if I believe him, redesigning

[02:50] Metallica as he did when he originally made Metallica.

[02:56] But it is gonna be a John Borg special the next few months, back to back games.

[03:02] Borg is not happy that they shelved his Indiana Jones.

[03:07] Borg loves Star Wars.

[03:09] Borg has been waiting to get one of these juggernaut themes.

[03:14] They've been giving all the big stuff to other people.

[03:17] What was the last big John Borg hit?

[03:20] Was Rush the last big game he came out with?

[03:23] I think it might be.

[03:25] I think I'm missing something that came out after Rush.

[03:28] Sorry, it's Monday morning.

[03:30] I'm always in a little bit of a fog.

[03:32] So this week, they're shooting the game.

[03:35] Jack Danger just had shoulder surgery.

[03:38] So we know he's probably not making any of that content.

[03:41] So hopefully we get something a little bit more exciting than Mr. Sharp walking up to

[03:45] the game with a deadpan face.

[03:48] I think Stern needs to get a little bit better at making some more exciting videos.

[03:53] Will they turn it over to other content creators?

[03:56] Will they ever have Canada do a launch?

[03:58] You asked for it.

[03:59] You wanted it.

[04:00] Now you're gonna get the greatest Star Wars pinball machine of all time.

[04:04] I wish they would have more hype.

[04:06] It's always like George next to the machine.

[04:09] Hi, George Gomez, Chief Creative Officer.

[04:11] It's like, come on guys, come in with some real fire.

[04:15] May the force be with you.

[04:17] The only thing you're not gonna be able to do is keep the money in the wallets, people,

[04:21] because this is the greatest Star Wars pin ever.

[04:24] There's never any real hype.

[04:26] It's just like why we're talking to grown men.

[04:31] That's who buys these things.

[04:33] They need to get a little bit more Bruce Buffer, you know, like presenting the man who's made.

[04:41] Some of your favorite pinball machines, Tron.

[04:45] He's made Guardians of the Galaxy.

[04:49] He's made Rush Pinball, the designer that's been hungry.

[04:54] He's been on the sidelines waiting for his title shot.

[04:58] I give to you the undisputed, the undeniably 80s nostalgic geek, Mr. John Borg.

[05:08] Maybe where is it?

[05:10] It's time.

[05:13] You know what I'm saying?

[05:14] There's no hype at all.

[05:16] It's like, let me tell you what I did with the vertical up kit, baby.

[05:21] You know what I'm saying?

[05:22] You know, I don't want to hear stories about Eric going to drive to get a Harry Potter book.

[05:28] I don't.

[05:29] I don't want to.

[05:30] I get it.

[05:31] Yeah, I get it.

[05:32] I want to hear you haven't been able to sleep until people saw this game.

[05:36] A little bit of energy.

[05:37] You know, I believe in energy and life as you can tell, right?

[05:40] I deal with this every single day.

[05:42] Low energy people, low energy people.

[05:44] Someone said something walking around our company the other day.

[05:47] It really feels like we got law firm energy going on here.

[05:50] And I'm like, you're right.

[05:51] Why is everybody so quiet?

[05:53] We are one day going to be extinct.

[05:55] Every single one of us, one day our voices will no longer be heard.

[05:59] One day we won't be around.

[06:01] What's the point in being around and just being quiet, especially when you're making

[06:05] toys that are meant to get grown adults excited?

[06:09] So they're shooting the game.

[06:10] What does that mean?

[06:11] Do we think there's going to be a teaser this week?

[06:13] It's August 11th.

[06:15] I'm not sure.

[06:17] It feels a little early, right?

[06:19] Because I was looking at when Stern pinball announced X-Men and it was September 4th.

[06:26] So are we going to get Star Wars even earlier than that?

[06:29] And wasn't X-Men rushed out because other stuff wasn't selling?

[06:34] And so I don't know.

[06:35] They're shooting the game this week.

[06:37] It is August 11th.

[06:39] It doesn't feel like the best time.

[06:42] People are traveling a lot in August.

[06:44] They're spending a lot of money.

[06:46] But if it's Star Wars, that's immune to any date.

[06:51] You could release a great Star Wars pin any time of the year and it's going to sell really

[06:57] well.

[06:58] But it is interesting because Stern usually drops stuff around a similar time period.

[07:04] They want to get this game out.

[07:05] I think we're going to get this game in August.

[07:08] I think we're then going to get in late September, early October, the Walking Dead remake.

[07:14] The thing about Stern, a company that can make around 800 games a week, when you think

[07:18] about how many Star Wars machines, they're going to be able to pump out of that factory.

[07:24] It's absolutely crazy.

[07:26] So they'll make thousands of them by the time pinball expo rolls around.

[07:32] I think everybody, and I mean this, everyone is more cautious moving towards these modern

[07:38] Stern machines because the other thing we haven't talked about, what is the actual price

[07:43] increase going to be on this newer Spike 3.5 version of the game or Spike 2.5 if you

[07:50] take into account, not all of Spike 3 is going to be in this.

[07:55] Are we going to see a $500 price increase?

[07:58] Is it going to be $600?

[08:00] Is it going to be $700 I was starting to hear a week ago?

[08:05] Now I think $13,700 hurts.

[08:11] It hurts because I'm watching all these people by all these $13,000 LEs and even if it has

[08:18] a good IP, it's really hard for these games to justify being that expensive.

[08:24] Now, King Kong is a flop.

[08:27] It's a total flop.

[08:29] Stern has nailed, did not want to spend that much money on an asset list King Kong.

[08:35] Jaws 50th has all the assets, has the fans much more excited, but really there hasn't

[08:41] been a juggernaut IP that Stern has nailed in about five freaking years.

[08:49] I mean think about it.

[08:53] That has been their biggest game in the last five years and Godzilla isn't even a massive,

[09:00] massive IP.

[09:02] Stuff like Batman is bigger.

[09:04] Stuff like Star Wars, stuff like Guardians of the Galaxy.

[09:08] You know X-Men is a big property, but again, they always go cheap.

[09:13] If they made X-Men more about the X-Men movies or better yet what they should have made was

[09:19] Wolverine versus Deadpool and made a game based on that movie.

[09:24] Can you imagine how awesome a pinball version of that movie would have been with the Madonna

[09:30] like a prayer, like Wizard Mode where all the Deadpool's are popping up?

[09:34] I mean it was all right there and they really haven't given us anything of this magnitude

[09:41] in a really long time and so this is going to be a really important test for Stern Pinball.

[09:47] They know they need a big hit.

[09:49] They've got the biggest IP that we're going to get and then they've got Pokemon after it.

[09:54] Those are the two biggest IPs in the history of pinball people.

[09:57] Those IPs are bigger than Harry Potter I believe.

[10:00] They're bigger than Avatar and so they're ginormous and the thing I would like to see after we

[10:06] get this round of IP, I really would love to see more variety from the world of pinball

[10:14] in the world of stuff that's humongous, stuff like Super Mario.

[10:17] I want to see more Disney properties.

[10:20] I do.

[10:20] I want someone to do Toy Story right.

[10:22] If we're going to go back to the well and redo Star Wars so nobody's ever going to make

[10:28] a pinball machine based on the best Toy Story movie of all time, that's never going to happen.

[10:34] I would love a Ratatouille pinball machine.

[10:37] A Lion King pinball machine would crush.

[10:40] This stuff would just do so much better than stuff like Venom, stuff like John Wick.

[10:45] I get this stuff is expensive but now we're paying this much money.

[10:50] We want to see more.

[10:52] We want to see iconic IPs.

[10:54] That's why Jaws is doing so well.

[10:56] It's just an iconic thing.

[10:59] It's always going to be iconic and they made the right version of the game.

[11:04] If they made only Jaws 3, that's the equivalent of only making Toy Story 4.

[11:09] So it's going to be a very, very, very competitive pinball landscape and you know how I feel

[11:15] about it.

[11:16] These companies are going to have to make the best product they've ever made.

[11:21] Jersey Jack pinball just made what is easily the best shooting pinball machine they might

[11:27] have ever made.

[11:28] Is it better than Elton John?

[11:30] Ah, maybe.

[11:30] I think so.

[11:31] It's got more interesting stuff going on.

[11:33] Is it loaded?

[11:34] Not so much but it's loaded with assets and it's an incredible theme, Harry Potter,

[11:39] and people are loving the game.

[11:41] I'm not going to argue with that.

[11:42] I'm reading people's feedback.

[11:44] They're loving the game and Jersey Jack games I think are only going to get better from there.

[11:50] It's good.

[11:51] They've raised the bar on gameplay.

[11:53] That's what they needed to do.

[11:55] Spooky Pinball has some incredible themes coming out.

[11:59] We know they know how to load their games.

[12:01] I think the last frontier for Spooky is just quality.

[12:04] If they can get the quality up a notch where it needs to be, they're going to be so damn

[12:10] successful for so many years.

[12:13] Barrels of Fun, a company that just needs to get the themes tighter.

[12:18] They need to get the themes more connected to the community.

[12:21] You can't have a theme in modern pinball times where you can't sell a thousand over four to

[12:27] five months.

[12:28] That's a bad theme selection.

[12:30] They make a quality product.

[12:32] They do.

[12:33] I know some of the early dunes are having some issues here and there, but man, when you stand

[12:38] over a Barrels of Fun Dune machine, it's a really premium item.

[12:43] They just need to get the themes better.

[12:46] Chicago Gaming Company, pointless to talk about.

[12:49] August 11th, when are you getting your medieval madness remake?

[12:52] You don't even know.

[12:53] That's pathetic.

[12:54] Pathetic.

[12:54] Like I don't even care anymore about this company whatsoever.

[12:59] I love seeing Pulp Fiction prices keep going lower and lower and lower.

[13:03] It is what it is.

[13:04] I don't know how any of you feel good about supporting a brand that never talks to you.

[13:09] They absolutely don't care about you.

[13:10] Is there even anyone over there like in a marketing department?

[13:13] There's nothing happening over there.

[13:15] They don't care.

[13:17] I think Turner Pinball, they're not going to sell that many Merlin's arcade.

[13:21] Chris Turner would have been smarter to hold on to the Raza license and release that game.

[13:26] I can't believe we're still talking about Raza, but speaking of Raza,

[13:29] it's going to be the next game from Dutch Pinball X.

[13:32] We all know this.

[13:33] It's going to bridge the gap between Alice and Back to the Future.

[13:37] I don't know how they're going to handle the Back to the Future demand.

[13:40] If they were smart, I don't know what these tariffs, who knows?

[13:42] Like they're going to have to charge a lot.

[13:45] I think everyone's expecting a lot in that game.

[13:48] I have not seen anything.

[13:49] It's why I don't talk about it that much.

[13:52] It's more than a year away.

[13:54] So there's so much that's going to happen between now and then.

[13:58] And you know, we know that Dutch has it.

[14:00] Like there's no speculating.

[14:02] Dutch Pinball has Back to the Future.

[14:05] I think the other companies out there, man, it's hard.

[14:08] Pinball Brothers, how are they going to survive if Predator is not a huge hit?

[14:13] I keep seeing more and more content on Facebook.

[14:16] They've got to get these games out.

[14:18] The key for Predator, I think two things.

[14:20] They've got to get the game out.

[14:22] The word of mouth has to be amazing.

[14:25] And I think they need to make enough money to go license Arnold.

[14:29] I don't think they can.

[14:31] He's so much more expensive.

[14:32] He might not even be gettable.

[14:34] So Gordy Weaver was gettable and there was just a certain amount of money you had to pay to put her in the game.

[14:41] I don't think Arnold is even gettable.

[14:43] And I think what you see is what this game is going to be.

[14:47] And I think in a world in which this game is almost $15,000 to your door, who's buying one?

[14:53] Who is buying one at that price?

[14:56] And so, you know, I think for most of us, the first time we're going to play this game might be at Pinball Expo.

[15:03] But I can't see the Pinball Brothers really surviving if this is what they've got.

[15:10] Padready Gaming has been rumored to have Tales of the Arabian Knights remake.

[15:15] The Funhouse remake was a total flop.

[15:18] And so if they have toad in, yeah, it would be a good time to maybe even start to tease that.

[15:24] Remember they teased they had something magical coming and they had the carpet and all this stuff?

[15:29] That was like a year ago.

[15:31] Where's the follow-up on that teaser?

[15:33] Where's Kingpin, that Pinball Circus Maximus company?

[15:37] They're nowhere to be found.

[15:38] I think 200 people bought the Translight and were expecting that game.

[15:43] That's nowhere to be found.

[15:44] That game was like developed.

[15:46] It's crazy to me that nobody was able to get that over the finish line.

[15:51] And then you've got American Pinball.

[15:53] Carrie Hardy said that Cuphead was coming out.

[15:56] It's coming out.

[15:57] It's not coming out.

[15:58] We are not going to see Cuphead.

[16:00] Mukesh is not going to sell any of that inventory and he's going to move on.

[16:05] Especially if Ametron goes public in India, no one's going to want this Pinball sort of thing on the books.

[16:13] Like why are we losing money on this Pinball venture?

[16:17] Sometimes people forget.

[16:19] Robert Mueller took $61 million from other people who thought they were investing in something else

[16:26] and started a Pinball company and didn't ship one single game.

[16:32] Remember, like $61 million and he couldn't even get a single game out the door.

[16:38] Now, not all of that money was used for Pinball, but tens of millions of dollars went into the

[16:43] Pinball development and into people's pockets and coders and all this stuff and not one single game

[16:51] ever came out.

[16:53] And so as I said, it's a three horse race now.

[16:57] There are only three Pinball companies that people are really feeling FOMO for.

[17:04] Spooky, Stern and Jersey Jack.

[17:07] Everybody else in my honest opinion is on the outside of that race and they're going to have to do stuff

[17:15] that puts them into the pack because that's where the money's going to go.

[17:21] That's where the excitement is and that's what people want.

[17:26] And you know, to get there, it's not just about the game.

[17:30] It's about transparency.

[17:32] It's about communication and it's about making sure your customers

[17:37] feel good and feel excited to support you as a brand.

[17:42] You know, I'm looking at a game like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the owners that get it

[17:47] are having a good time.

[17:48] The problem is it's August and the game was revealed and deposits were taken in September

[17:56] of 2024 when it was like production's going to start in January.

[18:01] Right?

[18:02] You still don't have your game.

[18:03] So I get why people are getting really upset, but again, you don't get a refund until January 1st.

[18:10] They will honor that.

[18:12] But you know what I'm saying?

[18:13] It's like even though your products could be there, you still have to think about the journey you put

[18:18] customers on.

[18:19] People will always remember one thing.

[18:21] I say this at work.

[18:23] I'll say this to you guys.

[18:25] The only thing people ever remember, whether you're buying a pinball machine, whether you're in a

[18:31] marriage, whether you go to a restaurant, whether you try to buy a Rolex, whether you're house

[18:38] hunting with a realtor, whatever it is, whatever moment you decide to do something with other people

[18:44] and where there's a product on the line or some service that you expect from people.

[18:50] The only thing you will ever remember is how they made you feel.

[18:56] How does CGC make you feel as a buyer?

[19:01] How has Dutch Pinball made you feel if you ordered a game eight months ago?

[19:05] How does Stern Pinball make you feel if you went in on some of these LEs and lost $4,000?

[19:13] How do you feel if you bought a $15,000 Godfather's CE and now you're seeing themself for eight?

[19:20] How do you feel about losing $7,000?

[19:24] Okay, so this is going to be the new benchmark.

[19:28] The companies that will succeed are going to be the ones that make people feel great,

[19:34] not just make great products, but make them feel great.

[19:37] And this is why when you think about all the companies out there in the pinball world,

[19:42] the company that is doing that the best is Spooky Pinball.

[19:47] They are in it with everybody.

[19:49] They are transparent.

[19:50] They are the ones that make people feel the best.

[19:54] The product has not always been the best, but they make you feel the best.

[19:58] And I have to say this, everyone's allowed to be a little bit biased.

[20:03] And you know what?

[20:04] That's fine.

[20:04] That's just the way the world works.

[20:06] We're all going to have favorites.

[20:08] Like you might think Stern's your favorite or Jersey Jack.

[20:11] You might think Spooky's are not great because they use servos.

[20:13] But as a pinball content creator that is trying to be as unbiased as possible,

[20:19] I also have feelings towards companies based on how they make me feel as an individual.

[20:27] And so I have a lot of respect for George Gomez and Zambietti and Jeremy Packer and Seth Davis.

[20:33] And I've met with them intimately and they've always made me feel really good.

[20:37] So I have a lot of respect for Stern Pinball.

[20:40] I have a lot of respect for the leadership over at Jersey Jack.

[20:44] I've had very intimate conversations with them, not so much from Eric.

[20:48] You know, he's nice to me.

[20:49] But then, you know, there was times when I saw him at a show and I always feel a little bit

[20:52] sometimes like I'm getting the smug cold shoulder.

[20:55] But that being said, when I had an issue with my guns and roses,

[21:00] on the same day, I get a text from him.

[21:03] And I'll tell you that goes a long way in making me feel great about owning Eric's guns and roses

[21:10] machine.

[21:10] So thank you, Eric, for doing that.

[21:12] That's what people want.

[21:14] And when I think about Spooky Pinball, it's like they're always in it with me.

[21:17] Every time I do a show, every time I do a live Spooky Luke joining, they're hanging out with me.

[21:22] They make me feel good.

[21:23] They make my community feel good.

[21:25] And that goes a really long way.

[21:27] Same with each and every one of you.

[21:30] I hope this show makes you feel good every week about Pinball.

[21:34] There's not a lot of news in Pinball every week.

[21:36] You know this.

[21:37] And so I love waking up and making you feel good about the hobby.

[21:41] I think content creators do an amazing job of making so many thousands of people feel good

[21:46] about Pinball when the manufacturers have nothing left to say.

[21:49] And we sort of bridge the gap between those moments of news and those moments of excitement.

[21:54] So everybody, look, on this Monday, let's really get ready for what's about to drop.

[22:00] I hope the new game from John Borg makes us feel something again.

[22:04] I hope it brings the energy and the love we have for Star Wars to life in Pinball format.

[22:10] And we finally get a modern Star Wars Pinball machine that is magical.

[22:16] That is a world under glass that makes us feel like Luke on his journey or makes us feel like

[22:22] Obi-Wan and young Anakin trying to make their way through the Star Wars narrative.

[22:27] Darth Maul.
