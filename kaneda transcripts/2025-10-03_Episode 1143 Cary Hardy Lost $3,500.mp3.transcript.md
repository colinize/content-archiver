[00:00] And I don't want the world to see me,

[00:04] cause I don't think that they'd understand,

[00:09] when everything's made to be broken,

[00:14] I just want you to know who I am.

[00:17] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:22] Aw, welcome everybody to Canade's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] You made it to October.

[00:26] I feel like we are just a couple months away from Beetlejuice,

[00:31] Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, and I heard from Buggin Luke last night,

[00:37] cause I got a little bit of a rumor that Don,

[00:39] from Don's Pinball Podcast, has been helping spooky pinball with design,

[00:45] and I reached out, I just asked, hey guys, is that true?

[00:48] And they just said, hey look, you know, he's got some ideas,

[00:51] he's in the roller coasters, and we hang out,

[00:54] and some of his ideas may be implemented in a future game.

[00:58] And then they also said, Canada, it might surprise you to know that one of your ideas

[01:04] is gonna make its way into our next game.

[01:08] And I'm thinking it might be my idea to turn on the machine with Beetlejuice,

[01:13] Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, so I am super excited.

[01:16] I also told them, hey look, a good idea is a good idea.

[01:20] If Don's got great ideas, put him in a game.

[01:24] You know who doesn't have great ideas right now?

[01:28] Stern Pinball, they need help, whether it's Don, Ralph,

[01:33] Canada, people need to put more creativity into these games.

[01:38] And I think in the end, nobody really cares where a great idea comes from.

[01:45] If you have a great creative, innovative idea

[01:48] that's gonna make a pinball experience better, more power to you.

[01:54] That's why I do believe the homebrew guys are really where the innovation is gonna come from

[02:00] when we want to get great machines in the future.

[02:04] So as we head into Pinball Expo in just two weeks, I will be there.

[02:09] If you are going to the show, let's do this.

[02:13] I'm absolutely gonna organize a hangout, a happy hour, I always do.

[02:18] I'm absolutely gonna pick up the tab for some Canadian fans or all the Canadian fans that are there.

[02:23] Probably 99% of the show.

[02:26] Only Rob Burke don't want Canada at the show, but Rob hasn't spoken to me recently about not going.

[02:32] So I guess that's a good sign.

[02:34] I'm just gonna take the silence around my attendance as a good thing.

[02:39] So I saw that Star Wars Code 8.5 is out.

[02:43] So I watched Star Wars Code 8.5 for about 15 minutes.

[02:49] There's a lot more going into the game.

[02:52] You know, the Code team, Ray Day and team are there in the video.

[02:57] And as I'm watching it, and I see all these beautiful Star Wars clips and it's got a lot in it.

[03:03] I mean, when you talk about taking the movie assets and putting it into the game,

[03:08] and I know that they can't have text over the movie footage and that's why they're using as much of the screen as they can with the text below it.

[03:17] It does look a little weird.

[03:18] It's not as clean as I would like it to be, but I just had this feeling like,

[03:22] I just don't think they're gonna be able to code their way into our hearts with this game.

[03:28] I think the aversion to buying one runs much deeper than the code.

[03:33] I think a lot of it is not working for us.

[03:36] I think when you look down at it, it just does look like a cheap game.

[03:40] It just looks like something that could be at Costco.

[03:45] That's a big issue.

[03:46] That's a real big issue.

[03:48] And I think for a lot of us out there, if you want to get a Star Wars, yeah, just wait.

[03:54] By the time this code is 1.0, we all know this.

[03:57] This is the problem.

[03:58] By the time it's 1.0, Star Wars, LE will be like 9500 and the premium will be 7500.

[04:05] And they're gonna make premiums forever.

[04:07] We also know that in like a year or so, they're gonna make a 50th anniversary of this game.

[04:14] And it's gonna have probably a nicer play field, probably have the full Spike 3 package.

[04:20] And so everyone is just waiting.

[04:21] It was funny.

[04:22] Kerry Hardy just said he's so underwhelmed by this game that he hasn't even made a video about it.

[04:28] I mean, just think about that.

[04:29] We are the most prolific pinball content creators.

[04:32] And it's like hard for us to even want to talk about it.

[04:35] And I'm sad by this.

[04:36] The reason why I'm sad is this, is that we need Stern every once in a while to put a hit in the world.

[04:43] Because it creates momentum.

[04:45] It creates excitement.

[04:47] As a podcaster, I want Stern to have at least one big hit a year.

[04:51] Because if they don't, if they don't, it's bad for everybody's business.

[04:55] It's bad for their business.

[04:57] I'm gonna lose subscribers.

[04:59] People are gonna fall out of the hobby.

[05:01] There's just not a lot of exciting stuff to talk about.

[05:03] I mean, Star Wars just came out and most people are not excited about it.

[05:10] And there's not much to look at and want to discuss in a way that makes us giddy and entertained.

[05:17] All that's gonna change when Beetlejuice comes out.

[05:19] A lot of people are gonna get excited when they see Raza.

[05:22] Am I making that up?

[05:23] Maybe, maybe not.

[05:24] Raza's gonna sell all the units they need to sell.

[05:28] Harry Potter continues to excite people.

[05:30] They just brought one to the Nima Lima.

[05:33] Is that the name of it?

[05:34] Nima Lima, I always forget what the exact name is of the art store that has this special Harry Potter art.

[05:41] They just set one up in the UK to my friends over at Jersey Jack.

[05:45] You now need to set one up at the Harry Potter store in New York City.

[05:51] How could you have a game in the UK but not one in New York City?

[05:56] Go Yankees!

[05:58] When you're called Jersey Jack Pimball, I'm gonna tell Brett,

[06:02] Brett, just send a game there and get it set up.

[06:05] But that's going well for Jersey Jack.

[06:08] And so do we think we're gonna see the Walking Dead remastered at the Stern Army Party?

[06:13] That's when they ushered out Metallica remastered a year ago.

[06:16] It's hard for me to think about that, that it's been one year since I sat down with Stern leadership

[06:22] and thinking about the year they've had.

[06:24] Not exactly the year I think they thought they were going to have.

[06:28] And I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

[06:31] The new rumor now is that they don't have Pokemon.

[06:36] I mean, I don't even know man.

[06:38] Like, Pokemon to me is funny because it is the world's biggest IP.

[06:42] But amongst the Pimball buying demographic, I just don't know.

[06:47] I really don't know how it's gonna do.

[06:49] I don't want to say it's gonna go one way or the other.

[06:52] Let's just say this.

[06:53] If someone offered you the Pokemon theme and you're a Pimball company,

[06:58] you're gonna make it.

[06:59] Like, you're absolutely gonna make it.

[07:01] Now, is that the theme I would start with if I wanted to sell thousands of games to this audience?

[07:08] No.

[07:08] Die Hard.

[07:09] Fifth element.

[07:10] Big trouble in Little China, right?

[07:12] A tiny little John Carpenter niche movie would have more of you excited than Pokemon.

[07:20] Now, because Stern needs to sell thousands of games a year on the premium and pro trim of these games,

[07:27] absolutely Pokemon is the much smarter choice to do.

[07:30] So will Pokemon be Jack Danger's game?

[07:34] Who knows?

[07:35] You know, there's also that crazy rumor that Keith Elwyn is a huge Pokemon fan.

[07:41] And look, this is the biggest IP in the history of Pimball.

[07:45] Let's not hold back here, people.

[07:46] This all has the data to prove it.

[07:48] Pokemon is so much bigger than Star Wars.

[07:52] It's so much bigger than Harry Potter.

[07:54] It's so much bigger than Avatar.

[07:56] By the way, did you see the new Avatar movie trailer is out?

[08:00] The trailer is out for like Fire and Ash.

[08:03] And nobody cares.

[08:05] Like, nobody cares.

[08:06] James Cameron is just gonna keep making these movies.

[08:09] And there's no cultural, like, significance to any of it right now.

[08:13] And I think it comes out like this December.

[08:15] Nobody cares.

[08:17] And so it's the biggest IP in the history of Pimball.

[08:21] And you're telling me Stern Pimball is not gonna put its biggest designer against it?

[08:26] Well, they didn't put Keith Elwyn against Star Wars.

[08:28] They gave him King Kong.

[08:30] It's gonna get real interesting real soon over at Stern

[08:34] because the alarm bells have to be going off.

[08:36] There are only two pages in the Star Wars fall of the Empire owners club thread.

[08:44] Two pages, people.

[08:46] I don't understand.

[08:47] If you started a thread that said,

[08:49] what do you think of Canada's haircut?

[08:51] You would have like 18 pages in one hour.

[08:54] Stern Pimball developing a Star Wars game for two years,

[08:58] getting all of the assets and they can't even get more than two pages in the owners club.

[09:04] The game has been out for almost a month.

[09:06] Embarrassing.

[09:08] Reset coming baby.

[09:10] Reset time over at Stern Pimball.

[09:13] Maybe they need to call Canada back in there.

[09:15] Maybe the next time I go through those doors,

[09:18] it's because they invite me, not because I asked to talk to them.

[09:23] Tables are turning baby.

[09:25] Now look, we're all losing a little bit lately.

[09:28] You know, I was thinking about it this morning to you like,

[09:30] what would actually happen if Stern Pimball went under?

[09:34] Would the boutique companies with that affect them?

[09:36] I don't think so.

[09:37] I think the boutique companies would do just fine.

[09:40] Maybe there might be some parts that they source from vendors

[09:44] that couldn't survive if Stern didn't place those big orders.

[09:47] But for the most part, you think Jersey Jack Pimball would suffer

[09:51] if Stern went under?

[09:53] Would Spooky suffer?

[09:54] Would Dutch Pimball suffer?

[09:55] Would Barrels of Fun suffer?

[09:57] I think what's crazy is,

[09:59] Stern going out of business would actually be the number one thing

[10:03] that would help preserve the value of Stern games.

[10:06] Stern staying in business is the number one way their games continue to lose value.

[10:12] They've got to find a middle ground.

[10:14] They've got to find it.

[10:15] And the only way out I feel is if they lower prices,

[10:20] they have to.

[10:21] Other companies out there in the world have lowered their prices.

[10:26] I don't understand this.

[10:27] We're just going to keep going off the cliff every single launch.

[10:31] It doesn't make much sense.

[10:34] The Walking Dead remastered.

[10:36] When it comes out, it's going to be $13,000 or more for the LE.

[10:42] I think we might see the price increase to $13,500 or $13,600.

[10:46] And then there's going to be the premium.

[10:47] And that's it.

[10:48] There's no pro.

[10:49] Walking Dead LE used to be like $5,500.

[10:52] It's just going to be so funny to see what happens when they bring this game back.

[10:57] What's on the screen?

[10:59] Knowing Stern's track record, I don't think they went and got the show clips.

[11:03] I think we're going to see like an animated version of everything that was in the Lyman code.

[11:08] There is a new coder working on the game for obvious reasons.

[11:11] If you're taking the old DMD game and putting it onto an LCD, there's just a lot of coding you're going to have to do to achieve the same effect.

[11:20] So are we going to see that at the Stern Army Party?

[11:23] We're going to know in just a couple of weeks.

[11:25] Will Kaneda be invited to any of these parties?

[11:28] I don't know.

[11:29] But I really look forward to seeing all of you that will be at this show.

[11:33] You know you won't be able to miss me.

[11:35] Got my outfits plan.

[11:37] Surprise t-shirt that's going to tease a game coming out down the road.

[11:41] You already know what it is.

[11:42] It's just going to be something that's going to make you laugh.

[11:44] And so we wait.

[11:45] And so we wait.

[11:46] And so ironically we head into fall.

[11:49] And Stern Pinball is feeling like an empire that is in a little bit of a freefall.

[11:54] And they need something.

[11:55] And I want them to have a hit.

[11:57] Because it is boring every three months to have another mediocre Stern.

[12:02] We have to wait a year for the next Jersey Jack.

[12:04] We have to wait a year for the next game from Spooky.

[12:08] Dutch Pinball.

[12:09] Who knows man?

[12:10] Barry's taken forever with Back to the Future.

[12:12] Big Lebowski's are not holding value anymore.

[12:15] You know they kept making them.

[12:16] Keep making them.

[12:17] Keep making them.

[12:18] Now it's been a 12 year old game.

[12:20] It's still not a bad game.

[12:21] But 12 years in one game.

[12:24] You know you start to get over it.

[12:26] And I think we're all over the mediocrity.

[12:29] We want to see the passion.

[12:30] We want to see the new stuff.

[12:31] We want some surprises.

[12:32] We just want to want these games.

[12:34] I mean that is really what it comes down to.

[12:37] No one's going to stop playing Pinball.

[12:38] No one's going to fall out of love with Pinball.

[12:41] It's still really exciting.

[12:43] I mean the silver lining for a lot of you guys out there.

[12:46] You can just jump on the games you own.

[12:48] Explore them more.

[12:50] And get through them.

[12:51] You know as I was watching the Star Wars stream today.

[12:53] I will say like I'm not an expert on how to code a game.

[12:56] But I still just feel like it's all these Star Wars moments thrown into a blender.

[13:01] And it would have made more sense to let you select which movie you want to play through.

[13:07] And you play through that movie and feel those moments in the right order.

[13:11] I think that would have made more sense.

[13:13] And you know how I feel.

[13:15] There should be three Star Wars games.

[13:17] A new hope should be its own game.

[13:19] Empire its own game.

[13:21] And Return of the Jedi its own game.

[13:24] And you should have had Keith Elwyn do every one.

[13:27] It would have been amazing.

[13:28] The ultimate trilogy with the ultimate franchise.

[13:31] And you nail it.

[13:32] All of this just feels like a compromise.

[13:34] It worked when games were 6500.

[13:37] Don't work right now.

[13:38] So that's where we're at.

[13:39] As we head into the winter.

[13:41] And we've got Beetlejuice looming over everybody else's launches.

[13:46] I think we're going to see a teaser at Expo.

[13:48] And I think that teaser is really going to be cool.

[13:52] And I think it's really going to make everybody patient enough to wait for the release.

[13:58] Now when will the release be?

[13:59] I'm thinking end of November early December.

[14:03] I still think they've got a decent amount of evil deads to make.

[14:07] Right.

[14:08] I think they probably got like 300 more to make.

[14:10] And they're going to be making those until like January February.

[14:14] And then Beetlejuice goes on the line.

[14:17] I think historically speaking there's usually been about a two month delay

[14:22] between when spooky reveals a game and they start shipping to customers.

[14:26] But in today's climate that's nothing.

[14:30] Everyone would happily wait two months and get something they're super excited about.

[14:35] You know who's not excited?

[14:37] Carrie Hardy.

[14:38] He bought a King Kong Ellie for $13,000.

[14:44] Game is what?

[14:44] Like four months old, five months old, maybe six at most.

[14:48] He finally after trying to find a buyer for like weeks.

[14:53] He finally got one offer for $9,500.

[14:59] So Carrie Hardy with all of his audience and everybody's aware.

[15:03] It took him a while to lose $3,500 on a King Kong Ellie.

[15:09] Now you go back and you start at 2004 and go all the way up.

[15:16] I mean this go all the way from 2004 Lord of the Rings Ellie go all the way from that

[15:23] to 2021 17 years of Stern machines.

[15:28] You can't name me one Stern Ellie amongst all of those years where anybody lost $3,500

[15:37] off the MSRP of the game.

[15:40] There are a lot of people out there that don't want me to say this stuff.

[15:45] Unfortunately, one of them is our friend John Ehrlich at Jack Bar.

[15:51] He's unsubscribed.

[15:52] I was giving him crap for it yesterday.

[15:54] He'll be back.

[15:55] I'm not worried about John.

[15:56] He's like, you know, Canada, your show is talking me out of pinball.

[16:00] It's like, John, it's not about that brother.

[16:02] It's not about repetition or talking you out of pinball.

[16:05] It's about saying the stuff that needs to be said because unless we say this stuff,

[16:10] we're not going to help these companies make better decisions.

[16:12] And so Stern pinball needs to make better decisions.

[16:16] They can't keep passing on to their new and box buyers a $3,500 loss on a brand new Keith

[16:24] Elwin machine.

[16:25] And over the last 20 years, 95% of those years, you couldn't even lose $3,500 on any Stern

[16:33] machine in any trim level.

[16:35] But now you're losing that in less than six months on the trim level.

[16:39] That's supposed to be the safest.

[16:41] That's supposed to be the one that people want to collect and they don't see a problem

[16:45] with that and they're not making any moves to correct that problem.

[16:48] And I'm not going to shut up about it.

[16:49] And if it is repetitive, I don't really care because the rest of us are going to do what

[16:53] everyone's doing on this show right now.

[16:55] We're all just waiting and laughing on the sidelines.

[16:59] The only people that should be buying these things new and box are operators.

[17:03] If you're making money off these games, I'm happy for you.

[17:06] That's the way it should be.

[17:07] But I don't want to see any of you.

[17:08] I don't want to see any of my friends lose this kind of money because they were impatient

[17:13] and they ran in and they bought these games.

[17:15] I mean, you know, the content creators have to go buy these things.

[17:17] Apparently, I don't like, I don't even buy these things.

[17:20] I don't buy these things that I'm doing just fine.

[17:22] I have more subscribers than every single pinball podcaster combined and they're the

[17:27] ones running buying these things, losing money.

[17:31] I don't understand it.

[17:32] I really don't understand it.

[17:34] Everybody, that's my advice to each and every one of you.

[17:37] Just wait it out.

[17:38] Wait it out.

[17:38] But get on the list for Beetlejuice.

[17:41] I mean it.

[17:41] Beetlejuice is going to sell for $9,999 and overnight it's going to be worth $15.

[17:48] And I'm just telling you right now, that's what's going to happen.

[17:50] I think the evil deads are going to lose value.

[17:52] They are.

[17:53] If you paid over for an evil dead, I get it.

[17:55] It's beautiful.

[17:57] Yes, everything about it is great.

[17:59] The problem is evil dead is still evil dead.

[18:01] It's not a great theme.

[18:03] They did a great job with it.

[18:05] But when Beetlejuice comes out, I just feel like it's going to knock evil dead down a few

[18:11] pegs because everyone's going to want the more mainstream theme that's a lot more campy

[18:16] and relatable than evil dead.

[18:18] It just is.

[18:19] Like most of you guys are not evil dead fanatics, but you're well aware of Tim Burton's masterpiece

[18:24] with Beetlejuice.

[18:25] All right, everybody.

[18:26] Thank you for being a member of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[18:29] More shows are always coming.

[18:31] We're definitely going to be back for the Saturday morning spectacular.

[18:35] I can't wait and get ready for Pinball Expo.

[18:37] We're going to have a lot of fun there.

[18:39] Rolling around Expo as the Canadian Army.

[18:42] Let's show Rob Burke that there's a lot more people that are excited about my presence

[18:47] than who don't want me there.

[18:49] Canadian out.

[19:09] I just want you to know who I am.

[19:13] I just want you to know who I am.
