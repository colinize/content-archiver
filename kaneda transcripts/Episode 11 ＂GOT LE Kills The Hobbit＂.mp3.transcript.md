[00:00] The power of Akira exists in everyone.

[00:03] Huh? Who's that?

[00:05] When one awakens to the power, even if one is not ready,

[00:10] even if one doesn't feel qualified,

[00:12] the holder of the power has no choice but to make a decision.

[00:23] Alright, here we are, episode 11 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts,

[00:29] and we are in New Orleans, and we are, I have to admit,

[00:32] we are a little bit buzz tonight.

[00:34] It's not even tonight.

[00:35] Brennan and I were in Pat O'Brien's bar all day long,

[00:40] drinking hurricanes and celebrating Martigraw.

[00:43] If you haven't been down to Martigraw people,

[00:46] you have to put that on your bucket list of things to do.

[00:49] This city is incredible.

[00:51] Everyone is walking around.

[00:52] It is like a living and breathing circus Voltaire.

[00:57] Everyone is in these like, gesture costumes and just like having a,

[01:03] the time of their lives.

[01:04] And I'm like, you know what?

[01:06] I've had enough hurricanes.

[01:07] I've had a few vacas.

[01:10] And we're going to have a little podcast fun right now.

[01:13] So here's where we're going to cover on episode 11 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[01:17] We're going to cover three topics.

[01:19] We're going to cover Game of Thrones, Ellie, and my opinions of it versus Hobbit.

[01:25] We're going to cover the fact that America's most haunted,

[01:29] just sold new in box for a very high price.

[01:32] And we're going to cover one more thing.

[01:35] We're going to cover just people asking what would J.J.P.'s next license theme be.

[01:42] So let's jump right into it.

[01:44] I want to start with my personal feelings about Game of Thrones, Ellie, versus the Hobbit.

[01:51] Now I was first introduced to Game of Thrones, Ellie, at Pinball Expo 2015 when they unveiled it.

[01:58] I didn't get to really play it.

[02:00] I didn't play it at all.

[02:01] I played the pro a lot.

[02:03] So I was really excited to come down to New Orleans and play Tiger Laws, Game of Thrones, Ellie.

[02:09] Now he had this machine tricked out by Pinball refinery.

[02:13] I can't really tell how much of it was really tricked out.

[02:16] The dragon was painted a little bit differently.

[02:19] The coin door was much nicer.

[02:22] There were some other elements that looked a bit better.

[02:25] But for the most part, I think I'm playing the Game of Thrones, Ellie,

[02:28] that most of you have been playing recently.

[02:31] And I also got a chance to play the Hobbit on location in Brooklyn at the 5th Estate Bar.

[02:38] So I have it in the last few weeks.

[02:41] I have both machines in my head.

[02:44] I want to just say what I believe is to be a definitive winner if you compare these two pins.

[02:52] So here I am, Canada, in New Orleans, having played Game of Thrones, Ellie, a bunch, having played the Hobbit a bunch,

[03:02] which one I think is the better pin.

[03:04] And I have to say without a doubt, the Pinball machine, if I was going to spend $8,000 plus on a machine,

[03:12] the one that is the clear winner.

[03:14] And I really think by a far margin is Game of Thrones, Ellie.

[03:20] This pinball machine has won me over.

[03:27] And I say that with all sincerity because I am highly skeptical of this machine because of the artwork in it.

[03:35] And I think we all were.

[03:37] And I love the Hobbit art.

[03:39] And I love what Jack has done with the play field in the Hobbit.

[03:43] But at the end of the day, when I look at these two machines and I put them side by side,

[03:49] I think that Game of Thrones, Ellie, just blows, blows.

[03:55] And I mean this. It's not like a marginal victory here.

[03:58] I think Game of Thrones, Ellie, blows the Hobbit away.

[04:02] Blows it away in terms of being a better pinball machine.

[04:08] And I'll explain why. I'm going to explain why right now.

[04:11] I think that Game of Thrones, compared to Hobbit, has so many more interesting and rewarding shots than the Hobbit does.

[04:23] It has such better flow.

[04:25] The ball is constantly moving.

[04:28] And the ball is constantly coming back to the flippers in a fast-paced motion that makes it really exciting.

[04:34] And I think that Game of Thrones also has, you know, just like the multi-ball.

[04:40] Like it just gets your energy boiling.

[04:44] Like you're just excited to just that black, when it would black water multi-ball.

[04:49] When that happens, it's just so much more just incredible and satisfying than when you lock three balls in the Hobbit.

[05:00] And in terms of pace, because I think the pace of the ball means so much in the Hobbit.

[05:07] I am not going to be apologetic back to the fact that when I played the Hobbit, that game felt really slow and really floaty.

[05:15] I'm going to keep saying Lord of the Rings. When I played Game of Thrones, the ball is moving quickly.

[05:22] The ball is constantly flowing back to the flippers and just moving at the pace that you wanted to.

[05:33] The Hobbit next to Game of Thrones feels like an EM.

[05:37] It feels like an EM game where the ball is just floating.

[05:40] And I don't care, you know, I don't even care what you guys say about setting up the Hobbit properly to dial it in so that it plays right.

[05:49] It doesn't even matter.

[05:51] It doesn't matter if you set up the Hobbit to be at the right angle and the right flipper power.

[05:57] I don't even care because you know what? It doesn't matter.

[06:00] Pitch, angle, flipper power, don't count.

[06:03] There's nothing to shoot out in the Hobbit.

[06:08] The shots, the rewarding shots just aren't there.

[06:12] All you shoot out in the Hobbit is the upper ramp and these drop targets.

[06:18] And the upper ramp, shots, can be hit with either flipper.

[06:22] So there's no real like rewarding and satisfying feeling you get when you play the Hobbit compared to Game of Thrones where the shots are so freaking rewarding.

[06:34] I mean that center shot that loops up around to the right rail, that you know, will you lock the ball?

[06:42] It's amazing.

[06:44] You got, and I haven't even brought this up yet, the upper play field.

[06:48] The upper play field on Game of Thrones LE is one of the best upper play fields I've ever played.

[06:56] Ever played.

[06:57] And we were talking a lot about the family guy upper play field and how much fun that is.

[07:01] But this is even better.

[07:03] And the reason why the Game of Thrones LE upper play field is so good is it's so fast-paced and it's so energetic.

[07:11] You know the shots you have to shoot.

[07:13] And it's usually three shots that you have to hit before you have to determine whether you shoot the ball in the middle area or off to the sides.

[07:22] But what's great about it is just the ball doesn't spend a lot of time up there.

[07:27] But the shots you have to hit are difficult.

[07:31] And oftentimes they're hard to hit so the ball comes back down.

[07:35] So you don't spend a lot of time in the upper play field but when you're up there it's so satisfying.

[07:41] Now when you play the Hobbit, and I want people to be honest, when you play the Hobbit, tell me what shots are that rewarding.

[07:51] The ball is just floating around the play field.

[07:55] It goes up the ramps and that's it.

[07:57] That is it.

[07:59] There is nothing left in that pinball machine that is that rewarding.

[08:04] Versus the Wizard of Oz, which I will go on the record as saying, I think the Wizard of Oz is much much much more fun than the Hobbit.

[08:15] I do.

[08:16] I don't think the Hobbit has...

[08:19] The ball does not do nearly as much interesting stuff as Waz.

[08:23] And I think Jersey Jack put everything that he could into the Waz and he made Waz incredible.

[08:29] And I think Hobbit is a complete miss.

[08:33] It's a complete miss. It's not as much fun.

[08:36] And Waz embarrasses Hobbit in terms of satisfying shots.

[08:40] When you look at Waz, for example, you have two upper play fields.

[08:44] Two, you got the ball being dragged by the monkey into the upper play field.

[08:48] You got all this stuff going on.

[08:51] You got the right flipper to hit the witch when the witch pops up.

[08:56] What do you have in Hobbit?

[08:58] What nothing pops up other than the trolls, which are so unsatisfying to hit.

[09:03] And other than that, there's nothing going on.

[09:07] I was really frustrated that the Hobbit, which is Jersey Jack, Pinball, Soft Mark, Effort.

[09:18] I was frustrated that it didn't feel like it really was an improvement on Waz.

[09:23] And I just wanted to get to the bottom of it.

[09:26] And I've heard from you guys many times.

[09:29] I've heard from many of you that I should stop calling over to Pinball companies.

[09:33] I called over to Andrew. I called over to Orig. I called over to Gary's Turn.

[09:37] And I was playing movie clips.

[09:39] And people were like, you know what, Canada, you need to stop playing movie clips.

[09:43] You need to, it's juvenile and childish. You need to stop it.

[09:47] So I was like, fine, I'll stop it.

[09:49] So I wanted to hear from Keith.

[09:51] Because Keith is coding the Hobbit.

[09:54] And I feel bad for Keith.

[09:56] Because Keith has been given a lot of flack on Pinside.

[09:59] People are criticizing him for not having any real explanation as to why there's a third flipper,

[10:06] which by the way is pointless.

[10:09] And I wanted to ask Keith in person what his feelings were about coding the Hobbit.

[10:17] And did he feel that he could save a machine that didn't have satisfying shots with deep code?

[10:25] And so guys, I heard you. I didn't call them. I'm not going to play you some pithy movie clip.

[10:31] I went over there and I tried to talk to Keith about the Hobbit code.

[10:37] And I was outside his office and I was being told by the employees that he was actually talking to Jack at that moment.

[10:44] And he would be out in a second.

[10:46] But he never really emerged.

[10:48] So here's what I heard happening when I just knocked on the door and said, hey Keith,

[10:53] can you explain the Hobbit code and the third flipper and why it doesn't make sense?

[10:58] And what are your thoughts of coding this game for Jersey Jack Pinball that teams do not have many rewarding shots?

[11:05] And here's what I heard from behind the door.

[11:09] Why don't you just let me be, huh?

[11:13] Because you're jacked and I'm like this.

[11:18] Nothing. I'm nowhere.

[11:23] Fuck off me!

[11:30] Yeah, I mean, it seems really heated back there. But look, I got to say this.

[11:44] And I know I've been getting a lot of criticism from the community and just to stay positive and only say nothings about every new Pinball machine.

[11:54] But I really wanted the Hobbit to be something special and after playing both the Hobbit and Game of Thrones, I have to say it's not even close.

[12:07] And I'm also really annoyed because I posted it in the Hobbit thread.

[12:13] Sorry, yes, the Hobbit thread. Sorry. I post it.

[12:18] I hope everybody plays the Hobbit before they buy it. Before they buy it.

[12:24] And I got so many downvotes on that for just suggesting that you should play this pin before you spend $8,000 on it.

[12:33] And people consider that to be a negative statement. And that is what annoys me to no end.

[12:40] Is that people are just suggesting that this pin is going to be great without even trying it.

[12:49] And go ahead for those out there. Good luck.

[12:54] For those who have paid and waited three years for the Hobbit, if you think the worth has been wait, we'll justify three years of having your money locked up.

[13:05] I think you're going to be severely disappointed. I don't think the Hobbit is worth a three-year wait.

[13:12] I don't think the Hobbit has many rewarding shots. And I'm going to go on record right now for saying that I think the Hobbit is a complete miss.

[13:23] I think it is. I think there's absolutely nothing about this pinball machine that makes it worth three years of waiting.

[13:34] I think there are no shots in this machine that are that rewarding. It just feels like Jack tried to remake or not remake, but looked at like medieval madness and said,

[13:46] like, oh, they have pop-ups. And we're going to add even more pop-up, five pop-up mechanisms to this machine.

[13:53] And most of the action is taking place under the play field. I think it's boring. I think it's uninteresting. I think it's floaty. And I think it's slow.

[14:02] And I don't care what pitch you put it at. I don't care what flipper power you dial in.

[14:09] The Hobbit compared to Game of Thrones is not even close. Game of Thrones is so much better in every aspect.

[14:21] And I understand now why people who have played Game of Thrones, people who have the LEDs and the pros, you don't even care about the artwork when you play Game of Thrones because the shots are so rewarding.

[14:34] And at the end of the day, a pinball machine should be about rewarding shots and how fun it is to shoot. And when I was playing the Hobbit, I felt so bored watching the ball just sort of float around, sort of struggle to find anything interesting to hit.

[14:53] And when I play Game of Thrones, man, I'm in it. My palms are sweating. I'm trying to hit shots. And when I love about it, it's like how many shots there are to hit and how punishing those shots are when you get them wrong. And you're just like, you're in it and you're trying hard.

[15:10] When I always hear a statement, people say, how much is this pinball to make me play one more time? Game of Thrones made me want to keep jumping in. I did not feel that way about the Hobbit. And I'm going to leave it at that. I'm going to leave it at that. I think Game of Thrones trumps the Hobbit.

[15:28] And I think Hobbit is a three year debacle that is not going to be worth the wait. And I think J.J.P. loyalists are going to realize real quickly that Waz is the better pin and that J.J.P. is in real trouble when it comes to the future of that company.

[15:47] And here's what's going to happen over the next year. We're going to hear everyone who purer the Hobbit start to make excuses and sound exactly like this.

[15:58] Because I know somewhere deep down in my heart.

[16:08] I still love you.

[16:11] Inconceivable.

[16:12] I'm a police man. See my dad.

[16:16] Alright, so when it comes to price police and recent for sale threads and an inconceivable fact, it's that the America's most honoured new and box pinball machine that was listed recently for $10,000 is in pending sale.

[16:35] Let's talk about this for a minute because if there's one thing that continues to irritate me, it's the price police.

[16:45] I despise the price police without end. And I think that these individuals are completely misguided and would love the world to occur the way they see fit and they don't understand the realistic aspect of how things are going.

[17:05] Let's just for those of you who are new to this podcast, someone listed a $10,000 new and box America's most honoured $10,000.

[17:18] I mean this pinball machine sold just a year or two ago for $6,000 new and box.

[17:24] And it's a 150 pinball. It's a 150, you know, making 150 of them, which is rare.

[17:35] And sorry if I'm rambling a little bit or slurring my word, I'm a little bit drunk and nor leans and I just want you guys to understand that.

[17:40] So the fact that America's most honoured could even be listed for $10,000 new and box is kind of crazy to some people.

[17:51] But I say God bless the seller. Why not see what you can get? And so here's where it's at.

[17:58] So it seems that this pinball machine is going to sell for $9,000 new and box plus shipping for $400.

[18:07] So that's for the buyer. That's a $90,400 transaction on a pinball machine that recently cost $6,000.

[18:20] And they were having a hard time selling America's most honoured. So what does this tell us?

[18:25] I mean, it's one thing and one thing only. It's that rare machines, machines with low volume will always, always be desirable in a collector community.

[18:41] And for all those who said, oh my God, this guy is a jerk for trying to sell for $10,000, you guys all need to check yourself.

[18:50] And I've said this many times. When someone lists the pin for an expensive amount of money, the price police, they always parachute in and start insulting the seller saying, what are you crazy?

[19:11] How can you ask $9,000, $10,000 for a pin like that? You're an idiot, you're more on, what are you doing?

[19:21] The seller is completely legitimate in offering a really high price to see if he'll get it.

[19:28] I mean, why would you, I always laugh at these guys who list the pin for sale and it sells in an hour. Those people are the idiots, the people who sell a machine and it sells immediately. Those people left money on the table.

[19:43] But this guy clearly, clearly, clearly is getting way more than people thought he ever would. And more than I thought he would, I have to say this.

[19:53] I think anyone who buys an America's most honoured for $9,000, I personally think that person is a couple cans short of a six pack. I think that person is a little bit more ronic, but I wouldn't say it, but they are.

[20:12] There's no way America's most honoured is worth $9,000. This is like as home brew as pinball machines get and the fact that people are willing to pay it tells me one thing.

[20:26] And it tells me one thing and I think we all need to understand this and in respect that's going forward. It tells me that all that matters in the collector world is availability.

[20:41] There aren't many of these out there. Okay, it is worth $9,000 because there was only $150,000, which is nothing. And if you want one, you need to be in physical possession of those $150,000.

[21:00] And that's not a lot. So when Jersey Jack offers 1,000 limited editions, 1,500 small editions, that's garbage. That's not limited. Okay, I think Stern is going to up the volume on its limited furgo spusters. These aren't really limited pins.

[21:22] Tronely was the last real limited edition Stern with only 400 being made. But spooky at $150,000, my god. It's quite clear why that's worth a lot of money.

[21:37] And so I just want to say this price police. This is a prime example of how you're always wrong. A seller should always list their game really, really high and take the best offer from there.

[21:53] And I have to say this for you guys who are in a Rob Zombie, you guys are you guys should be counting your blessings because if America's most honoured a game that is a generic or original IP that has pretty mediocre artwork.

[22:13] If you're looking at what America's most honoured is going for, you guys who are in on Rob Zombie should hold tight because I think you've got something much more valuable than anyone else going on out there.

[22:26] And I think you're going to reap the benefits of going in on a game that is truly limited with only three and are being made.

[22:33] And I think Rob Zombie is going to sell on the second hand market for more than $9,000. If AMH, new inbox went for $9,000, Rob Zombie, even though there's twice as many, has a theme that's 10 times more desirable than America's most honoured.

[22:50] So for those individuals who are in on that, congratulations. I think you hit Peter in terms of your speculation.

[22:58] And I want to end this whole conversation around selling pins with a recent thread that I saw where a guy, his name's Gorf, was listing a monster bash for $8,500 on pinside for sale.

[23:15] And someone who was seemingly trolling the thread, Blackbeard, offered the guy $6,300 for his monster bash.

[23:28] And I'll say this, if someone's offering $8,500 for a pin and you offer $6,300, of course you're trolling and you're being perceived as insulting the seller's wishes with your offer.

[23:44] And that thread was funny because those guys were going back and forth, just slandering each other and all these downvotes.

[23:54] I don't understand it though. If someone wants to offer you less than you want for your pin in your thread and they're bumping it up to the top, who cares?

[24:04] You're getting all these bumps for sale thread that will help you in the long run sell the pin.

[24:13] I'll say this, now is not the time to spend $8,500 on a monster bash. And Tiger Law was alluding to this in the interview I did with him.

[24:25] But I don't think these pins like monster bash and medieval madness and cactus canyon. I don't think they're worth nearly what people think they are considering what is coming out in the near future and considering what the innovation is.

[24:42] So if you want to buy one of those sort of classics from the last 20 years, at this point in time, I think you're kind of foolish. I think you really, really, really need to wait.

[24:56] So I want to end tonight's podcast with another thread that went up there recently and that was, what do you think JJP's next license theme will be?

[25:08] And I don't even want to tackle this in terms of speculating on what the theme will be in terms of toy story or James Bond or whatever Star Wars, whatever other themes that JJP has been rumored to possibly working on.

[25:25] I think it is so enane and asinine to be speculating what the fourth JJP pin will be.

[25:35] I really do. I'm so, I'm just personally tired of waiting for JJP to ship pins. I'm tired of it.

[25:45] There are almost like two years behind schedule and shipping the Hobbit. And do you really want these guys to have a theme that you love?

[25:55] Do you really want them to be in charge of a theme where they're going to struggle to get it out there in a timely fashion?

[26:05] And I don't even, I don't even think it's worth it anymore. I really don't speculating what they're going to get. And my prediction, and I'm going to go and record on saying this, I think JJP is in real trouble.

[26:23] I really do. I think that they are not good at it. I'm not 100% sure they're going to make it.

[26:34] These guys have shipped since like introducing their first pin. They've shipped two pins in seven years.

[26:44] Can you just like, can we all just think about it for a minute? They've shipped two pins in seven years.

[26:51] And I don't even know what the total number of stern pins that have shipped in that same time period.

[26:56] But I would have to guess that it would be somewhere near six pins, seven, eight pins in that time frame.

[27:08] And I'm just getting tired of the JJP apologists. These people who think that they're bringing all this innovation to the table, and it's all going to be worth it.

[27:20] And we should totally preorder with these guys. I will go on the record for stating that I think that JJP is a bit of a ponsious game. I really do.

[27:30] I think people that order a new habit are going to get it before the people who preordered years ago.

[27:36] And they're using habit preorder money to pay for the WAS machines that people are currently ordering.

[27:42] I think it's all a bit of a farce. I think it's all a little bit of a joke. And I'm just tired of it.

[27:49] I'm tired of people thinking that JJP deserves to be in the same conversation as stern.

[27:56] If I want anyone to make Star Wars, I want it to be stern. If I want anyone to make Jurassic World, I want it to be stern. If I want anyone to make Toy Story, I want it to be stern.

[28:07] You know why? Because I know that they'll make it. I know it'll ship. I know it'll be in my living room and my game room within the year they announced it.

[28:17] But I'm just so tired of speculating with JJP. If JJP really wants to position themselves as a legitimate company that can ship pinball machines, then they need to do one thing.

[28:29] They need to start shipping Hobbits and shipping them quickly. They also need to ship Pat Lawler's machine without taking any preorders and get those going on the line before the end of 2016.

[28:42] And I don't think anything, I don't think anything that's going to happen. I think Hobbits are going to slowly trickle out. I think they're going to send out like 20 at a time, 30 at a time.

[28:53] I think people are still still going to be waiting well into 2017 for their Hobbit pinball machine if they pre-ordered it. And I think it's lame. I think it's pathetic.

[29:03] I think there's going to be so many more exciting pins to buy than that. And I hope I'm wrong. Look, I do hope I'm wrong. But JJP, the ball's in your court. You've got all this financial backing. You want to position yourselves as a legitimate pinball manufacturer. Then stop making people wait three years.

[29:21] Stop making people freeze their money with you and stop start shipping pins today.

[29:27] Well, that's the Canadian's pinball podcast coming at you from New Orleans where Brendan and I have had an interesting day drinking hurricanes at Petabrains Bar, singing a bunch of great songs where they had the dual pianos going.

[29:45] Tiger long Pav have not made it out today. They're watching Netflix and BED. We're all a little bit hungover, a little bit inebriated at the same time.

[29:55] But I want you guys to do me one favor. I want you to join this podcast if you have an opinion. I keep hearing guys like Wysnow, Rare Hero, Beasel Boob, make all these comments about Canadian's pinball podcast.

[30:10] Well, guys, if you have some feelings, join me. Canada, K-A-N, E-D-A, pinball at gmail.com, and I'll happily have you on.

[30:21] And I want you to have a discussion about what you care about. But here's the thing. Don't whine and complain about me. Don't call me out. And then when I invite you onto the show, disappear.

[30:33] And I'm talking to you, Rare Hero. I'm talking to you, Wysnow. I'm talking to you, Beasel Boob. I'm talking to you, Vid 1900. Join me. Talk about it.

[30:44] If you think you can make a better pinball podcast, then go make it. But in the meantime, we're here. We're talking pinball. We're going to do it every few days.

[30:53] And I love you guys. I love this hobby. Keep it up. And God bless and have a good time. And we'll talk to you real soon.
