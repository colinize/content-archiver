[00:00] I have been blind, Lady Enrapt, Is dancing with me, Chilling.

[00:14] Alright, so how do I do this? How do I give you my unbiased first impressions of Jersey

[00:26] Jack Pinball number eight, The Godfather? And the truth is this, and I'm going to be

[00:30] very, very to the best of my ability, honest on this podcast, there is no ability for anybody

[00:36] in the pinball media, anybody who even likes pinball to be completely unbiased with what

[00:41] we see, because we all have our own biases, we have our favorite companies, our favorite

[00:47] designers, our favorite themes. Pinball is a 100% subjective item, we all have different

[00:52] feelings, we all are moved differently by every single game that comes out. I was moved impressively

[00:59] by the Foo Fighters, I did like Scooby Doo, didn't blow me away, I'm not going to say

[01:04] much about multi-morphics games because they don't blow me away, and so for Jersey Jack

[01:08] Pinball, the pinball company that has been around for almost 11 years now, they've loaded

[01:14] up games with wide body adventures like The Wizard of Oz and The Hobbit, you know they

[01:18] were the company that was going to bring us back to the Baldy Williams period of pinball,

[01:23] and they brought a lot of innovation to pinball, there's no denying it, I mean the LCD screen,

[01:29] the LED lights and games, we got loaded games with games like The Wizard of Oz and Pirates

[01:35] of the Caribbean and Dialed In, Guns N' Roses really changed the way we looked at light

[01:41] shows and a concert going experience in a pinball machine, and look here we are, Jersey

[01:46] Jack number 8 just landed in the world today, and we don't know much about the game, so

[01:53] I saw the one minute Scissorail, I saw the 28 minute like straight down the middle video

[01:59] where Keith and Eric are interviewed about the game, and I'm looking at the game itself,

[02:04] and it's really really hard for me to get excited about the Godfather, and look I was

[02:09] never excited about this theme to begin with, so that was part of my bias.

[02:15] Now look I was very curious how they would integrate this into a pinball going experience,

[02:21] and after watching the straight down the middle video, it's clear what they had to do, right,

[02:27] to make a slow Italian drama, mobster movie that's really about family, they had to sort

[02:34] of create their own Godfather adventure, and that's sort of what's happening in this game,

[02:40] it's more about you're part of this mobster game that is inspired by everything happening in the

[02:46] Godfather movie franchise, and look I get it, it's what they had to do, you're not playing like

[02:52] the Godfather movie, it's more of like a choose your own mobster adventure with the different

[02:58] families from the Godfather universe, and you could debate that whether or not that's what you

[03:03] want in a pinball machine that is labeled Godfather the 50th anniversary, remember it's the 50th anniversary

[03:10] of the first film, and so I'm looking at the game, and I'm looking at what's in it, and I'm looking at

[03:15] the artwork, and I'm looking at the gameplay from the video, and I just want to give you my feelings

[03:20] on the game, and I want to give you a disclaimer, make up your own mind on this machine, all of you

[03:26] are grown adults, all of you can see if this is the kind of pinball machine you want in your home,

[03:31] and there might be something about this machine, or many things about this machine,

[03:35] that speak to you and make you want to own one, because remember they want you to buy this game

[03:40] today, okay, so I'm going to look at this as if I was a potential customer for this game,

[03:45] and who I think this game is targeted at, and does this game as the eighth game in the Jersey

[03:51] Jack Pinball lineup, does this game live up to the kinds of games we expect from Jersey Jack Pinball,

[03:58] and I'm just going to go down in no particular order my thoughts and feelings on the game,

[04:03] so the first thing that struck me was how much red and gold is in this machine, and when you

[04:08] look at the art package on the game, it is filled with a ton of like red and gold, and I don't know

[04:14] any other word other than it looks very gaudy, it looks like something I would see in Trump Tower,

[04:21] now look, I am half Sicilian, okay, so I'm half Italian, and my people do have a tendency to get

[04:28] very gaudy and tacky with their displays of wealth, and so when I saw this art package,

[04:35] it definitely popped out like a very very gaudy piece of furniture in some mobster's penthouse

[04:42] apartment, right, it just felt like that, and again, I'm not sure that that connotes Godfather to me,

[04:49] and again, it's just my perception of Godfather and how the movie has been portrayed, and what

[04:55] my feelings are, I just didn't think it would be so loud, so obnoxious, and so gaudy, like I thought

[05:03] it would have been a little bit more subdued, a lot more of like the piano black, and I think the

[05:08] game sticks out in a way that just doesn't scream Godfather to me, and I'm looking down at the

[05:14] play field right now, you know, again, there's a lot of gold, a lot of red, and then there's like

[05:18] that stained glass window with the rose in the middle with all the different objectives, and the

[05:23] first thing I said is here we go again, Jersey Jack Pinball, they always have their deep rule sets,

[05:27] you know, so obviously there's a lot in the game, but looking at this art package, you've got that

[05:32] stained glass window, you've got either Marlon Brando or Al Pacino by the Flippers, then you've

[05:37] got the sort of Italian, Sicilian sort of landscape, and then you've got New York City, and then you've

[05:43] got the Five Families, and there's just a lot going on that's all sort of put together, and I

[05:49] just want to say this, I get what they're going for, I get they're making this like mobster game,

[05:55] or you get to select your Five Families, and the Godfather movie theme is pulled through this,

[06:00] but I'm just going to say this right now, this play field, and what's in this game,

[06:04] After Foo Fighters just felt very underwhelming to me, it just didn't feel very cohesive, and it

[06:11] just doesn't come together, and make me smile the way I smiled when I saw the Foo Fighters

[06:17] package for the first time, this doesn't make me smile the way I smiled when I saw the monsters

[06:22] for the first time, and I'm just going to say that I don't think this is Franci's best work,

[06:27] I don't think it has the detail that we saw like in the monsters, and that's just my initial feeling,

[06:32] but when I look at it, it just doesn't make me smile ear to ear, again, there's just something

[06:37] about it, and I'm looking at it from the bird's eye view, it just doesn't come together, even the

[06:41] way the guns and roses play fields came together, and then you've got this like CE package of the

[06:47] game, the CE's got these ornate sculptures on the legs, it's got the horse head shooter rod thing,

[06:53] it's got the topper everybody's talking about with the mobster car, and the two mobster figures

[06:59] up there with the machine guns, and the main sculpt in the game, you know, is the big bad mobster guy

[07:04] with the tommy gun, and I'm just going to say it right now, and someone said this on my Facebook

[07:08] Live, I look at this game, and I look at these sculpted mobsters, and I don't feel Godfather,

[07:14] it feels like Cactus Canyon meets the Sopranos, and this is why we've been saying all of these months,

[07:22] we're not sure that Godfather is a great theme for pinball, because again, you go from this dark,

[07:27] gritty, Italian drama movie that is so iconic, and then when you try to pull that iconic

[07:34] movie into a pinball machine, it just starts to look a little comical, and that takes away from

[07:41] like the power of the Godfather film in my honest opinion, you know, when I was looking at these

[07:46] sculpts, and like the different bad guys in the game, and the mobsters, it just feels a little

[07:50] bit more like Capcom's kingpin, or like Team Pinball is the mafia even, like it just feels

[07:56] a little bit more cartoonish, and this was always going to be their challenge, is like, well, what

[08:00] do you put into the game physically that brings the Godfather movie to life, and let's just talk

[08:05] about that for a minute, okay? My big worry was that Pat Lawler was going to have his thumb on

[08:10] top of this game, and this game was not going to be loaded the way we expect Jersey Jack games to

[08:16] be loaded, remember, this is another game that's $12,000 for the LE, and $15,000 for the freaking

[08:23] collector's edition, and they're still idiotically going to make a thousand CEs, 5,000 LEs of this

[08:30] game, and I mean it when I say it, if you buy this game today, you're just going to lose money on

[08:33] this game, this game is not going to go up in price, and the only reason to buy it right away is if

[08:38] you're like a diehard Godfather fan, but just looking at the game right now, I'm just looking at it

[08:43] mechanically, and I watched the video, I heard Eric explain everything about the 29 different ball

[08:50] paths, about the three places you can lock the balls, about all the stuff happening in the game,

[08:56] and then looking at the game, and looking at the game in motion, and I'm just going to say it when

[09:00] I looked at the game in motion, and the gameplay video of the game from the straight down the middle

[09:05] video, the gameplay doesn't look that fast, it doesn't, and maybe it's fast for Jersey Jack

[09:11] pinball, but then you go put it next to a game like Food Fighters, and it still seems pretty slow

[09:15] compared to like the snappiness of a stern, and I get it, like a lot of the mechanical stuff in this

[09:21] game is stuff that's diverting the ball, what's not in this game is anything that feels like a

[09:26] major mechanism, where are the major mechs? For this much money, where's the innovation in mechanisms,

[09:33] and I get it, people have also said to me where's the major mech in Food Fighters, and I don't

[09:38] disagree, and this is my overall feeling about all of these games nowadays, if you're going to put a

[09:44] $15,000 pinball machine in front of me, am I not allowed to ask you where's the mechanical

[09:50] innovation, where's the mechanical creativity, where is stuff we haven't seen before, and I get it,

[09:56] there's some stuff in this game we haven't seen before, but what's not in this game or anywhere

[10:01] near in this game is something as cool as the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, or the Castle in Medieval

[10:08] Madness, or the upper playfield in Pirates of the Caribbean, or the triple spinning disc which

[10:13] Eric put in the original version of Pirates before Pat Lawler yanked it out, and that's my thing,

[10:18] is I looked at this game and I said I'm going to know in 30 seconds whether or not this is the

[10:24] new direction for Jersey Jack Pinball, in 30 seconds I will look down and we will know whether

[10:30] or not Jersey Jack Pinball is going to be the fully loaded jam-packed company that they promised us,

[10:36] or if they're going to turn into this, and when I saw this game what it felt to me like is that

[10:41] Jersey Jack Pinball is now just another stern, and they were never supposed to be just another stern,

[10:47] but that's what I feel like, and you could hate me, you could say,

[10:50] Canada you haven't played the game yet, but I don't care, I'm looking at this game and I'm not seeing

[10:55] anything in this game mechanically that's really that interesting, and I would have to wait and

[11:01] play this game before I make up my mind if I were going to buy this game, if you're on the fence about

[11:06] this game, there's absolutely no rush to get on this thing day one, maybe we're all just a little

[11:12] bit fatigued, but I mean it, after Foo Fighters this game is not popping, is Foo Fighters the greatest

[11:17] game ever? Absolutely not, but I don't know, I'm just feeling lately that Pinball is sort of running

[11:24] in place right now, and it's the most expensive it's ever been, and at these prices, and I'm just

[11:30] going to say this, Jersey Jack number eight should be their most impressive game to date,

[11:36] this game should be everything they know so far, I am impressed that they have clips from the movie

[11:42] where they actually sync up the voices with the clips, that is good news if you're a fan of the

[11:47] franchise, but just look at the game, is this game more impressive than Wizard of Oz, is this game

[11:54] more impressive than Dial Then, and I know what people are going to say, everybody's going to fall back

[11:59] and say well it's more fun to shoot, so then the price doesn't matter, and that is where we are in

[12:04] Pinball today, I've already seen it in the comments, the only two ways we can evaluate a pinball machine

[12:10] now are, it looks fun and I can't wait to shoot it, and that's fun, and I can't wait to shoot it,

[12:16] and it does look fun, and I will play this game, and I will have fun with this game, and it'll be

[12:22] just like Toy Story 4, I'll play it, I'll enjoy it, I bet it shoots great, but there's no way I

[12:28] would want to spend $15,000 on a game where there's arguably nothing that crazy going on in it, I don't

[12:38] want to spend $13,000 on any of these sterns, and I'm just feeling like well maybe this is it,

[12:44] like maybe this is pinball Chris, and maybe Chris the problem might be you, not these companies,

[12:49] and maybe they're right, and maybe that's a true statement, maybe I need to learn how to lower

[12:54] my expectations, maybe I need to learn how to look at something like this, and just be excited

[13:00] by it because we got a new pinball machine, and that's always been the approach of everybody

[13:04] else who does pinball podcasts, right, let's just celebrate everything, and let's lower our

[13:09] expectations, and then all of a sudden this game is great, and that's where I'm at, I'm sorry, but

[13:14] I'm just not blown away by this game, I think it's fine, I think they did the best with what they had

[13:19] to work with, but looking down on it, I don't think it's the best art package from Franci,

[13:25] I don't think it's the best world on your glass from Eric Minier, and I sure as heck don't think

[13:29] Jersey Jack Pinball is loading these games up now, where the prices should be this much,

[13:35] I think Jersey Jack Pinball continues to be a company with a little bit of an identity crisis,

[13:40] if they want to be premium high-end pinball, which I'm not even sure they want to be,

[13:45] then they've got to figure something out, a thousand collector's editions is too many,

[13:50] announcing on day one you're going to make 5,000 LEs is still moronic, because now

[13:56] everyone who buys an LE knows they're going to lose money right away, they are immediately going

[14:01] to lose at least like $500 the moment they unbox it, and in just a month you're going to be able

[14:06] to go get an LE for like 10 grand, trust me, you can see it, like these games are not going to go

[14:11] up in value because they're already so overpriced, and that's where I'm at, I don't mind you charging

[14:19] this much, but I better look down at a game and see something that's absolutely blowing me away,

[14:26] and again if it's blowing you away and you're satisfied, I'm happy for you, I just don't feel

[14:33] that way about this game, it doesn't make me smile the way Ghostbusters did, before we knew it didn't

[14:38] shoot very well, it doesn't make me smile the way Foo Fighters does, it doesn't make me smile the way

[14:44] Godzilla did, it doesn't make me smile the way Guns N' Roses did, and again I think it's because

[14:49] of the theme, and they had to go down this weird road where it's like your own mobster adventure

[14:54] inspired by Godfather, I encourage everybody to watch the straight down the middle video,

[14:59] you'll get a lot more in-depth knowledge of this game, and I'm just going to say it, Jersey Jack

[15:04] Pinball is like the role-playing game for pinball fanatics, and my friend Derek, he's listening

[15:09] right now, he loves this, he loves these deep rule sets, he loves when they go down all of these

[15:15] explanations on how to play the game, and I'm sorry but I just don't think that's pinball,

[15:20] I think pinball can be deep, but Jersey Jack just always feels like they over bake it,

[15:26] it's like they've got too much time to make each game, that they always put way too much

[15:31] in it, it shouldn't be this difficult to explain, I don't know it just always feels like there's so

[15:36] much going on, and I'm not sure that makes the game better, and Derek's like damn you Chris,

[15:41] you don't take the time to learn the rule sets, and maybe he's right because I'm a new dad and I

[15:46] don't want to have to take the time or study so much to learn how to play a pinball machine

[15:51] everybody, I want to see the silver ball go around a piece of wood and interact with a world

[15:57] under glass, and I just don't feel like they ever should have made this theme, and that's my two

[16:03] cents on it, let me know if you disagree, and you're probably like Canadian you're just trying to be

[16:08] negative, I'm not, I'm really not, I really do not want to be negative, I think Jersey Jack should

[16:13] have made the matrix or top gun, or something like back to the future, something where like you just

[16:19] understand why that world should come to life under glass, this to me just looks like cactus

[16:25] canyon meets like kingpin, and I'm sorry that's not what I think of when I think of the godfather

[16:31] canada out

[17:01] the way you look tonight

[17:09] lady and red

[17:15] lady and red

[17:21] lady and red

[17:24] lady and red

[17:28] lady and red

[17:34] I love you

[17:53] you
