[00:00] Oh yes, welcome back everybody.

[00:07] Chris and I are back talking about the newest game from Stern, we're five days in 2024 and

[00:15] they released this juggernaut of a game.

[00:17] How are you my friend?

[00:19] Jaws, finally after two years of waiting, I'm excited.

[00:23] I can't wait to talk about this game.

[00:24] Oh yeah, oh yeah.

[00:25] Is it a Godzilla killer?

[00:28] I don't think we know yet, we don't know enough yet.

[00:32] We can talk about the mechanics in it, from a pure week one, mechanically it doesn't blow

[00:38] everyone away the way Godzilla did, but it's too early to call it not a Godzilla killer.

[00:46] So we'll see, I think it's going to be the king of the monsters, one in the ocean, one

[00:50] on, I guess they both come from the ocean.

[00:53] Team monsters, absolutely man.

[00:56] So what do you think about the game?

[00:59] Did you buy one?

[01:00] Did you buy three?

[01:01] What did you do?

[01:04] You know me, I'm always in the market to scalp these things.

[01:07] Well as of today, I can buy a few LEs if I wanted to buy LEs.

[01:13] They're still available from some distributors, but most of them are sold out.

[01:17] I think I have a few on hold from friends of mine, but for the most part I've been reading

[01:22] that they're gone.

[01:23] So all of the moaning and groaning about is Stern going to sell out of this game?

[01:28] Of course they were always going to sell out of jaws.

[01:31] You're wearing the sweatshirt, it's iconic franchise.

[01:33] Did you buy one?

[01:35] Did you buy an LE?

[01:37] Yeah, not an LE.

[01:40] You just said yes.

[01:44] We bought one, but it's the pro because LE is…

[01:46] Well then it's not an LE.

[01:48] I just asked you if you bought an LE.

[01:49] You said yeah.

[01:50] We bought one, but that's for location.

[01:54] People can't wait.

[01:55] So we're going to get one of the first build ones and it's going to fly to Denmark and

[02:00] I'm going to show everything.

[02:02] So it's going to be cool, man.

[02:04] Why not?

[02:05] Why not?

[02:06] Everybody's waiting for the next QTelwing game.

[02:09] It is what it is.

[02:10] Two years.

[02:11] Two years we've been waiting.

[02:12] Okay, so what did you think when you first saw it?

[02:14] There's a lot of hype, a lot of anticipation.

[02:16] Did it live up to your anticipation and your enthusiasm?

[02:20] What did you feel when you saw it?

[02:22] Well first of all, I'm the wrong guy for this because I hate the theme.

[02:26] I mean, I just can't stand the theme, but when you remove that, it's still a QTelwing

[02:34] game.

[02:36] The elite video came out what three days ago or something like that.

[02:40] Yeah, at least.

[02:41] Yeah, and the official video came out yesterday.

[02:45] Or is it today for you?

[02:46] I don't know.

[02:47] Yesterday for me.

[02:48] Yeah.

[02:49] It was kind of a weird Shark Week.

[02:50] I think the community spoiled Stern's plans.

[02:54] But we did see, I think, a lot more yesterday with the Gomez video, the Elwin video.

[02:59] Now did you buy this sweatshirt just for this or did you own this before?

[03:04] I actually bought this sweatshirt because I wanted to make a Joel video for a year ago

[03:10] or something.

[03:11] That's why I bought it.

[03:13] Okay.

[03:14] You told us that this game was on the way for over a year ago, man.

[03:19] Everybody knew for two years.

[03:20] So you're not the biggest fan.

[03:22] So you see the game though, Jenga.

[03:23] What were your initial opinions when you saw it?

[03:27] Well, we saw the elite trailer and removing the theme.

[03:31] When I saw the shots and layout of this game, I was just hooked.

[03:36] I think it looks great.

[03:38] What about the shots?

[03:40] I mean, look, I'm trying to get a sense of why people get either excited or disappointed.

[03:46] I'm trying to be pretty middle of the road on this game.

[03:49] What shots did you see where you were like, oh my God, that shot?

[03:55] Two shots that I just love.

[03:57] At the left side, it has got this ramp with a mini 180 flip.

[04:02] So the ball comes up and down to a left flipper.

[04:06] And from there, you make the right orbit shot that goes up again and comes down to your right

[04:12] flipper.

[04:13] Again, from your right flipper, shoot the turbo to the left.

[04:18] And you can make that loopable shot constantly.

[04:21] When I found out about that on the video, I was hooked.

[04:25] That shot, when you do it, when it goes in and makes the bigger 180 shot and goes up

[04:31] to the upper play field and so much fun up there, I was hooked.

[04:36] The job that comes out, having a basketball.

[04:41] Let's talk about it.

[04:42] There's a lot of cool.

[04:43] There's a lot of debate on pin side right now about the shark itself.

[04:46] So Keith Owen said in the podcast that Stern put out that when they were designing it,

[04:53] they originally designed it as a shark that ate the pin balls and it just wasn't fun and

[04:58] it wasn't working.

[05:00] And so, you know, look, I mean, at some level, you've got to kind of trust Keith Owen, you

[05:06] know, a man who knows what he's doing.

[05:08] And if you think about the Jurassic Park T-Rex, I mean, that makes more sense.

[05:12] Coming through the forest, eating the ball, throwing it around Jurassic Park.

[05:17] That's what the T-Rex does.

[05:19] And I think it probably, you know, we think about the shark coming up from underneath

[05:24] the play field, making it work.

[05:26] I don't know.

[05:27] I don't know.

[05:27] But it's hard for me to like fully just say, yeah, that's it.

[05:31] Like I trust Keith because I also, when I look at this game, I do feel like Stern's

[05:37] mechanical engineering department isn't really doing anything magical in this game.

[05:43] Like nothing is something we really haven't seen before.

[05:47] And nothing makes me feel like they went out on a limb, right, to make this thing work.

[05:53] How do you, I mean, when you look at the game, right, I mean, I look at it like this,

[05:56] you're firing harpoons at a shark in the movie.

[06:00] There's more of a harpoon shot in AC DC and Walking Dead has a harpoon shot, right?

[06:06] A crossbow shot.

[06:07] So you, I mean, they could have put something a little bit more dramatic when it comes to

[06:13] that moment of trying to, you know, hit the shark.

[06:16] And that's the thing.

[06:17] There's a lot of apologists, you know, and shots are the new toys is the new thing in

[06:21] pinball.

[06:22] So look, as much as I think the layout is really cool, I think the game, every day I

[06:26] wake up, Jengas, I kind of get more excited about the game.

[06:30] I, you know, it's hard to hold on to anger.

[06:32] Like nobody's making us buy this thing.

[06:34] It's not a cancer treatment.

[06:35] It's just a pinball machine.

[06:37] But that being said, I still think there could have been a little bit more of a dramatic

[06:43] way in which you battle the shark.

[06:45] What do you think?

[06:46] I mean, can you imagine having that harpoon just on Walking Dead and when that shark

[06:51] thing goes up and the harpoon turns and you need to time and hit, that's a moment.

[06:58] Stuff like that wouldn't be that expensive.

[07:01] Well, and that's the thing.

[07:01] It's like the really good players, the tournament players, they don't,

[07:05] like those toys, they don't want those things in pinball.

[07:08] They just want flow.

[07:10] And that's been pinball is going at a tournament players way.

[07:15] Oh, I mean, Stern has absolutely made these things with more input from

[07:19] tournament players when it comes to the complexity of the codes and stacking

[07:25] multipliers, like, come on, like you see the dudes, you buy these L.

[07:29] E.s.

[07:30] They're just like, they play it a hundred times in five years and they just want.

[07:33] Wow.

[07:34] Moments and I think there's just always that balance of you want a game that

[07:38] shoots well, but I think you also can do both.

[07:41] Like you can create a moment, a physical moment in the game that is memorable.

[07:48] And I just think, you know, pinball tournament players don't like chaos.

[07:52] So they don't like a T-Rex throwing the ball randomly.

[07:55] They don't like magnets taking control of the ball.

[07:57] You know, they turn off stuff like that or they don't want it.

[08:00] So, you know, and that's why make the pro machine for, you know, for those guys.

[08:05] But in the L.E.

[08:06] Premium, I think there should be toys that are like, wow, like they really

[08:11] engineered something special.

[08:13] So I didn't know about Stern having a podcast.

[08:15] I will go and I'll find and listen to it.

[08:18] So what was his real, what did he say about the short mouth not working?

[08:24] I mean, why not?

[08:26] It just wasn't wasn't fun.

[08:28] And it wasn't, you know, it was disruptive to making the game enjoyable.

[08:32] So, you know, like I wasn't there.

[08:34] I wasn't involved in the in the manufacturing or the engineering of the game.

[08:37] But I could see what he's saying, right?

[08:39] Imagine, let's just say for, you know, example sake that the shark did come off

[08:44] and you shot the pinballs into the shark's mouth.

[08:47] I could see how that would, you know, maybe slow down the gameplay significantly.

[08:52] Is it a ball lock?

[08:53] Is it throwing the ball back out?

[08:55] The way the T-Rex does?

[08:58] Yeah, I don't know.

[08:59] And then how much real estate would it take up in the game to create that kind

[09:03] of mechanism and make it and make it work right?

[09:05] So I don't know.

[09:07] I mean, I just I tend to believe that, you know, they made the the the right decision.

[09:12] But look, everybody, we also all know this.

[09:15] Stern is also going to most likely make the the more cost-effective decision

[09:20] when it comes to their games.

[09:21] I mean, let's face it, looking down at this game, Jeng is putting it next to

[09:24] like Elton John and and games with real scopes.

[09:27] I mean, put it next to labyrinth.

[09:29] Like look at the world of labyrinth and how well it sculpted.

[09:32] I'm not talking about design and all that, but just the physical world of Jaws

[09:38] in this game looks pretty damn cheap.

[09:42] I mean, what do you think?

[09:43] I mean, I was like after after Godzilla, I I heard that George Gomez

[09:50] gave Keith Ilven Green light to just go all the way in.

[09:55] And you remember the market two years back, how people just we couldn't get

[10:00] enough machines.

[10:01] I mean, we could just this game got designed at a buy buy buy status of the

[10:05] pinball world. Right.

[10:07] So I really thought when I want to if you look at the middle of the play field,

[10:11] it has got five sharks you have to collect.

[10:15] And I think we haven't seen nothing about the code.

[10:18] But I think you need to hit the shark a lot of times, just like in attack from

[10:23] Mars. So as a finishing shot, I mean, you could have the shark as a bash

[10:29] chart, bam, bam, bam.

[10:30] And as a finishing shot, because you can see it's not a it's not a coil

[10:35] that says, bam, and the shark is out.

[10:37] No, it moves out.

[10:38] So it's a turning motor.

[10:41] And as a finishing shot, it could open its mouth and you can just bash it in

[10:45] there. Yeah. Small details that could be really, really cool, man.

[10:50] But yeah, I mean, also in the movie, the iconic shot is the end shot where

[10:56] the shark has the oxygen tank, the scuba tank in its mouth and, you know,

[11:00] smile, you son of a and then he shoots it.

[11:03] Right. So that's, you know, I get it like, I look, I get it.

[11:09] And I think right now it's fun.

[11:11] It's just fun reading all the back and forth and all the cheerleading and

[11:15] the complaining happening simultaneously on pin side is some of the

[11:19] greatest pinball content happening on the planet right now.

[11:23] I highly recommend.

[11:24] I think it's like 70 pages of these men fighting it out.

[11:28] And here's what happens, Jeng is, is the guys you buy the L.E.s, they

[11:32] instantly turn into like the defenders of the game, right?

[11:35] It's the greatest game ever.

[11:37] It's going to knock Godzilla off the top spot.

[11:39] And then you've got the guys that, you know, aren't in on it and they want

[11:43] to point out every reason why those guys are idiots for buying the game.

[11:47] The truth is somewhere in the middle.

[11:49] And I do think this is a really good effort from Keith Elwyn.

[11:53] I think the team behind him, the software team are the best in the industry.

[11:57] I mean, this game is going to be coded right.

[11:59] It's going to have the assets.

[12:01] It's going to have, I think it's going to be a very, very amazing pinball

[12:04] experience, whether it's worth the money or not.

[12:08] That is just a subjective argument to some people out there.

[12:13] Jeng is, you know, they bought this L.E. and $13,000 to some of those men is

[12:17] like you and I spending a hundred and like $130,000.

[12:21] That money means nothing to them.

[12:23] They're on the list for every single L.E.

[12:26] And so you need a thousand of those people to just sell out.

[12:30] And look, I think it's going to, I think it's going to do just fine.

[12:33] I don't think it's going to be as popular as Godzilla, but I think it's

[12:37] going to be right up there.

[12:38] I think it's going to be in the top 10 games for sure.

[12:41] I think Elwyn is just Elwyn.

[12:44] And, you know, when you look at the rest of the industry, what has anybody done

[12:48] in the last like couple of years, you know, that we're still talking about?

[12:53] Nothing.

[12:53] So, you know, but I, as I said in my last show, I do think when I saw this game,

[13:00] I wasn't like, oh my gosh, everyone's going to be fighting to dethrone this

[13:04] game this year.

[13:04] I do think this is in Elwyn's greatest effort.

[13:08] And I do think that there's going to be an opportunity from for the other

[13:11] manufacturers to show us what you got.

[13:14] Like this is the best Stearns got, right?

[13:16] This is their best designer.

[13:17] It's their best theme.

[13:18] They're going to come out with this year, probably it's their best design.

[13:21] We don't know that.

[13:22] We don't know that.

[13:23] Maybe Pokemon, maybe John, I don't know Pokemon.

[13:27] I don't know.

[13:27] Like we'll see.

[13:28] I still am not sure that Pokemon has the buyer base.

[13:33] I think the people who are into Pokemon are too young to afford these

[13:37] expensive machines.

[13:38] That's, that's my take on it.

[13:39] What do you think?

[13:40] I mean, are you excited?

[13:41] I think Pokemon is, I think Pokemon is going to sell like crazy.

[13:45] We're going to get Pokemon to all our locations.

[13:47] It's, yeah.

[13:49] Look at the theme, Jaws or Pokemon?

[13:53] Come on.

[13:55] But again, you've got to factor in the pinball buying demo at these prices.

[13:59] So Pokemon, we just missed it.

[14:02] Like guys our age, like we didn't grow up with Pokemon.

[14:05] Like that became more children of the nineties, not children of the eighties.

[14:09] Right.

[14:09] So it's, it's for people just a few years younger than you and I.

[14:15] But you know, look, Pokemon, no argument for me on, on whether or not it's a big

[14:19] theme, it's a much bigger theme than Jaws.

[14:21] Like globally as a property.

[14:23] It's ginormous.

[14:24] It's right up there with it's like a location.

[14:27] Every kid will play it every kid.

[14:30] I'm also into retro computing, retro consoles, gaming and Pokemon.

[14:34] I mean, the money they sell for a little Pokemon card can cost $1,000.

[14:39] It's so stupid.

[14:41] So it's going to be, it's going to be great for insider connected and achievements.

[14:47] Cause the entire thing is about catching them all and, and adding more

[14:50] Pokemons that you can unlock through achievements is probably going to be the

[14:55] greatest usage of Stern insider connected ever.

[14:58] Um, and then imagine if they partner with Pokemon, go the game and you actually

[15:02] have to be in front of the pinball machine to unlock stuff within that game.

[15:06] I mean, they have to, yeah.

[15:09] I absolutely have to and send messages go to this city at that location.

[15:15] You can collect Bulbasaur or whatever, all those names.

[15:18] They have to do that.

[15:19] Also, one thing I want to talk to you about you and I, we know, we know some

[15:23] stuff about the upcoming spike three system.

[15:27] When we add everything together, I remember when spike two came spike one

[15:33] instantly got outdated with the screen, but everything just got old and outdated.

[15:42] Same thing is going to happen when spike three comes when all of these spike

[15:46] two games they are still coming out.

[15:48] I don't want to, I want to have that on the location, but I don't know.

[15:52] Now, I don't think they're going to be outdated.

[15:54] I'll tell you why, because what, what's the big difference?

[15:56] It's supposed to be 4k.

[15:58] It's a better display, better animations.

[16:02] Okay.

[16:02] It will have faster CPU.

[16:04] It will have much, much better light control.

[16:08] The light control in this game is from those home pin game.

[16:13] They will start lighting is horrendous.

[16:16] Can we just talk about that for a minute?

[16:17] When you want to turn, yeah, okay.

[16:20] Let's start lighting is in the stone age.

[16:22] Like they're lighting in their game is in bear on all their games.

[16:26] Like it's embarrassing.

[16:28] If you look at JJP games and all the way back to guns and roses, it's a, the

[16:33] light shows, just spooky, light shows blow the way.

[16:37] Like they're just embarrassing.

[16:39] Like, come on, Stern, you're now charging this much money.

[16:42] Their games still look like, that's why when you say like spike one, two and three,

[16:47] the, the, the honest truth is I don't see a big leap forward happening anywhere.

[16:52] You know, since they went to LCD, I don't see like improve the lighting.

[16:56] I don't see.

[16:57] And again, when the screens this small, Jeng is, you're not really going to get much

[17:02] better images.

[17:03] Like you don't need 4k when you're only dealing with a tiny screen.

[17:08] You know, that's when you have a bigger screen.

[17:10] They can put screens on the player.

[17:12] They're not going to do it.

[17:13] They're not going to do a bigger screen.

[17:14] They're not going to do any of that.

[17:15] Screens are not on the top.

[17:16] Why not?

[17:18] I think it'll help them maybe more with computing and Bluetooth and stuff like

[17:22] that. But do you really think that Stern's going to go to spike three and all of

[17:27] us, all of a sudden we're going to start to see a lot more happening on the games

[17:30] like lighting wise and mechanically and really.

[17:33] Okay.

[17:34] I don't know mechanically, but electronically and control.

[17:39] They are limited when they put too much stuff on their system.

[17:44] Their notebooks are not enough.

[17:46] Just like what game was it when they use same coil for the pop bumper because of

[17:53] James Bond.

[17:55] Do you remember James Bond?

[17:56] Yeah.

[17:57] It was all in one.

[17:58] One coil to fire all the pop embers at once.

[18:02] Yeah.

[18:03] It was something like that.

[18:04] I mean, when spike three will come out because they're inside a connector.

[18:08] The internet now, it's not included in the board.

[18:12] You have, they have an external table that's put on there.

[18:17] All their DLC, you and I can play against each other.

[18:21] You and me in Denmark, all that stuff is going to be amazing.

[18:27] Wow.

[18:28] 2024 and we're spending $7,000 to $13,000 on games that aren't even internet

[18:36] connected and I can go spend 500 bucks and play $60 video games that connect

[18:42] you for the last 15 years.

[18:43] So no, it's just, it's, look, it's just, it's about time this entire industry

[18:47] gets connected.

[18:48] It's stupid.

[18:49] Like Jersey Jack took away its score bit.

[18:51] They haven't replaced that.

[18:53] Spooky's got a new.

[18:54] What's up with that, man?

[18:55] I don't know.

[18:55] I mean, I do remove it.

[18:57] You have nothing to replace it.

[19:00] Let's go back to Jaws because you and I, we can talk about this for days.

[19:04] So Jaws pro, I made fun of like, come on, that shark in the shark cage

[19:09] floating above the playfield.

[19:10] Come on.

[19:11] Like, does that look silly?

[19:13] And it's also static.

[19:14] It's always there.

[19:17] Always there.

[19:18] But on the early, it comes up and give you this moment, you know, but the other

[19:23] one is just, I don't know.

[19:26] I love pros, but I feel like now I have seen some people writing on Facebook

[19:33] that the pros, the way to go, I just, and usually I love the pro games, but on

[19:37] this one, I feel like it's just, Chris, it's just too empty.

[19:42] I mean, right.

[19:43] Yeah.

[19:43] They also took away the drop targets, which are pissing everybody off.

[19:47] So there is just a static bank of targets on the left side instead of those three

[19:51] drops.

[19:52] Yeah.

[19:52] They're not.

[19:52] I didn't see that.

[19:54] Yeah.

[19:54] So that's just going to be a nice constant brick.

[19:59] Yeah.

[19:59] Look, I mean, at how much is the pro now?

[20:02] The pros around 7000.

[20:04] 7000.

[20:05] Yeah.

[20:05] You, you people in the US, you make like $100 an hour.

[20:09] So you're so rich, man.

[20:10] 7000 is nothing for you guys, but it's a lot of money for us.

[20:15] I remember the days when Stern, Elise were 6500 bucks.

[20:19] So it's interesting.

[20:22] And those games were really, really cool, man, for $7000 to super.

[20:28] It wasn't like Metallica LE around 6500.

[20:31] Same with ACDC.

[20:33] I mean, and that's the thing.

[20:34] I mean, Cengiz, it's, you know, we can, um,

[20:37] look at ACDC.

[20:38] We can, we can turn off what we know about what we used to get for our money.

[20:43] And look, these games are very expensive.

[20:46] The expectations are very high, but also like the conversation around price.

[20:50] It is fatiguing.

[20:51] Trust me.

[20:52] Like I, I just, I think the LE guys are all, I don't know.

[20:56] Do you think this LE is actually going to go up in value?

[20:58] I saw on pin side, someone's already trying to flip one for 14, five or best offer.

[21:03] Already.

[21:04] Already.

[21:05] So what do you think?

[21:06] Right.

[21:07] We've seen every single Stern LE that's been 13 K slide down to 10 K within a year.

[21:13] So that's a $3,000 loss in one year.

[21:16] James Bond did it.

[21:17] Foo Fighters did it.

[21:19] Vem, Vem.

[21:20] Nobody even bought Vemmle, but the, the few guys who did, they lost their shirt on it.

[21:25] We saw huge losses with those three games, huge losses with Godfather, huge losses with Toy Story 4.

[21:32] I mean, do you think anyone's going to listen to the market and be like, you can't consistently sell at well over $10,000.

[21:40] If you want to, you know, find customers.

[21:43] Well, Chris, usually on a question like this, I would answer, no, this is Keith Helvin, but, but, but, but let's just talk about what happened.

[21:52] We got James Bond that came out not as the best pin in the world, you know, about the code and all that.

[22:00] Right.

[22:00] And it lost a lot of money.

[22:01] Okay.

[22:02] Then we got Foo Fighters.

[22:03] I mean, I love that game and people love that game.

[22:07] And that game lost.

[22:09] It was what, for $9,000 for an LE.

[22:13] Yeah.

[22:14] When stuff like that happens, I know this is Keith Helvin.

[22:17] I know, I know, I know.

[22:18] But I just don't think that anyone will buy this game on the second market for $15,000, $16,000.

[22:25] I don't think so.

[22:26] I have, Stern did sell out in like 10 minutes, but how many games do they sell from there?

[22:31] No, they always, how many games?

[22:34] They sell like 10 games on their website.

[22:36] Whenever people look at that, look, they're all, every Stern LE, I don't know.

[22:41] Can I ask you a question?

[22:43] Yeah.

[22:43] Can I ask you a question?

[22:45] Yes.

[22:46] If Stern sells directly out from their back door.

[22:51] Yeah.

[22:52] I mean, they make more of each of those games than they do through any distributor sale, for sure.

[22:57] If you were a distro in the US and you knew that Stern could just sell out from their own back door, how would you feel?

[23:06] I think they should all be nervous.

[23:08] I mean, you've said this, looking at that new factory and looking at Stern's ability to stockpile games and they've got a loading

[23:16] dock that looks like an airport hangar.

[23:18] Like they're going to, and you're, and you're Seth Davis and you're like, wait a minute, like we're passing on two to $3,000 in potential profit on each game because a truck comes to us.

[23:32] Yeah.

[23:32] It takes it down the block to a distributor warehouse and then they, the truck takes it to the customer.

[23:39] Like what, what exactly, why did we need to lose any money in that transaction?

[23:44] And also, I don't know if they still do this, but don't some distros just drop ship from Stern.

[23:49] They just give Stern the address to where to send the game.

[23:53] Or that happened back in the day.

[23:55] But I, yeah, I heard what I heard.

[23:58] Here's what I heard some people do.

[24:00] I heard some distros have warehouses right near Stern.

[24:04] So the product legitimately just goes right from Stern to a nearby location.

[24:10] And then it gets picked up and sent to the customer.

[24:13] So it's not like it's going from Stern to Florida, you know, back to New York.

[24:19] It's, who knows?

[24:21] I mean, ultimately.

[24:23] Yeah, I don't know.

[24:24] I don't know.

[24:25] Like I, I don't understand like the whole way this model works.

[24:29] It feels like it's a model that is decades old.

[24:32] And if anyone is going to aim for profit, it's going to be Stern, but also Stern does not want to deal with the customer.

[24:38] So that's the reason why I think they're okay, letting the distributors deal with all the customer issues, because they don't want to deal with it.

[24:46] Chris, you're talking about deal with the customer.

[24:50] Okay.

[24:52] Let me see.

[24:53] We just sold, we just sold.

[24:56] Okay.

[24:56] This is a JJP game, but we just sold a Elton John.

[25:01] Okay.

[25:01] Cool.

[25:02] If that customer in a month, rise to me and rush to my brother and says, my ramp switch is off.

[25:12] Do you know what we do as a distro?

[25:15] We just forward that to JJP and they ship the part directly to the customer.

[25:22] Right.

[25:23] I mean, I don't, again, I don't mean by that.

[25:26] I mean, what do you mean?

[25:28] I mean, I bought my, when I bought my Star Wars, I had a lot of trouble with

[25:32] my Star Wars early and I got directly connected to Stern.

[25:38] Yeah.

[25:39] The department of blah, blah, blah.

[25:41] It was not the distro thing.

[25:43] It was me and Stern and they sent me stuff and gave me the best support in the world.

[25:48] But yeah, the thing is this though, Cengiz is like, if they cut out the distros, they're not going to lower the price.

[25:55] So I think people are like, well, I'd rather have a distro who I'm buddies with and pay the same price.

[26:00] I'm thinking as a distro.

[26:02] Here in Europe, they need to have distros, but in the US, if I was a distro there, I would be nervous.

[26:10] Yeah.

[26:10] You've got, look, any middleman job, like you're just the middle guy.

[26:15] That, that always is, you know, you're always at fear of being eliminated from the scenario

[26:21] because you're just the middle guy.

[26:23] You know, you're not, you know, look at, look at what's happening in the car world.

[26:27] People would just love to order cars directly from the, from the manufacturer instead of paying the dealer markup prices.

[26:34] Because when a hot car comes out, the dealers are marking up the cars, right?

[26:38] The money's going just to the dealership, not to the manufacturer.

[26:41] The only reason we need car dealerships though, right?

[26:43] It's cause cars need service.

[26:45] They need oil changes.

[26:46] They, they need parts replaced in pinball.

[26:49] You're not going to take in your pinball machine every thousand plays for like some sort of servicing.

[26:54] So, you know, I don't know.

[26:56] But like, I don't, this is a, this is a can of worms in a Pandora's box conversation that, you know, it's, it's, it's, I don't know.

[27:05] I'm just a podcaster.

[27:06] I don't really have any skin in the game on that side of the industry.

[27:09] I would just be nervous.

[27:11] Going back to Jaws, one of the things that I really love about Godzilla is the whole audio package.

[27:19] Really cool.

[27:20] How do you think they will do it with Jaws?

[27:23] Because Jaws is very dark and, you know, we haven't seen the, you know, Jack Danger gameplay, but let's talk about the audio part.

[27:34] Yeah.

[27:34] Yeah.

[27:35] So they've got the John Williams score from the movie, which is iconic, but to your point, it is not as high energy as the Godzilla music, which really kind of gets you going.

[27:47] Jaws is much slower and purposely meant to be.

[27:51] Yeah.

[27:51] But obviously they're going to need a lot more music throughout the game and throughout the different modes.

[27:56] And we haven't heard any of it.

[27:58] So I, I tend to think they are going to put in, you know, some, a good soundtrack to make the game exciting.

[28:06] Otherwise, that's, that's my other fear of the game.

[28:08] I, you know, I was saying on my show yesterday, I'm just wondering what the replay value is going to be.

[28:13] Like how, like, you know, how, how exciting will it be to keep catching sharks?

[28:20] You know, like, is it going to feel repetitive?

[28:23] Is it going to feel like satisfying after you play the game for four months?

[28:28] Are you going to be over it?

[28:29] I don't know.

[28:29] You know, I, what's the variety of gameplay going to be like?

[28:32] Because I think what makes games special.

[28:35] And I was talking to people who own like Elvira, haven't played Elvira too much, but they love the way the different modes have like different music and shout plays.

[28:43] And, you know, the gargoyles are popping up.

[28:45] Like there's a lot of different personality throughout the game.

[28:49] And that's the thing about Jaws.

[28:50] I'm curious about, will this game have the personality that Godzilla has, that Elvira has, that Batman has.

[28:57] When you think about the games that are kind of keepers for people, it's usually a game with a lot of personality, a lot of variety and a lot of different modes and moments.

[29:07] You can't wait to get to, does Jaws have that?

[29:10] We just don't know yet.

[29:12] I'm not that nervous about the code.

[29:15] I think the code's going to be awesome because Keith Ilwin, he's all over the code also.

[29:21] He doesn't just design a game and he did it with Jamesbust 60.

[29:25] He didn't care about the code, as he said.

[29:27] But this replayability.

[29:30] Or the price.

[29:32] Oh, that's, I don't think.

[29:34] Yeah.

[29:34] Vegas is the biggest single loss in the history of pinball.

[29:36] If you bought one from Stern on day one, biggest single loss ever.

[29:40] You lost $12,000 if you bought it from Stern directly.

[29:43] How much did that Elvira, was it called 40th?

[29:47] Wasn't that like 20,000 also or was it 25?

[29:51] It was 25 is what dealers were selling it for.

[29:54] It was one of those call for prices where dealers bought them for 15 and they all charged 25 at the beginning.

[30:02] So yeah.

[30:03] Yeah.

[30:04] Yeah.

[30:05] Playability.

[30:06] Replayability.

[30:07] So I watched this six minute clip and I can see you have that clip in your background.

[30:12] That's my YouTube video running there.

[30:14] Oh, it was running there.

[30:16] It's something else.

[30:18] On there on Stern six minute clip, Keith Ilwin says actually that.

[30:25] Use your insider connected and go in and collect sharp teeth or something.

[30:34] Having an option like that will make people come back just like with Venom.

[30:39] So it's a clever gimmick.

[30:42] So just that part will give more replayability.

[30:45] People will use their insider.

[30:48] They're really doing some stuff to get that insider connected.

[30:51] I will say this.

[30:52] When you look at the pinball content being shared, especially over the holidays, the achievement stuff is great.

[30:59] Like it's giving people new reasons, you know, wakes up machines and gives you another reason to jump on a machine and do these micro tasks to earn like these achievements.

[31:10] Super smart.

[31:12] Yeah.

[31:12] It's like it's fun.

[31:13] It's all good right now until Stern tries to charge us.

[31:18] Yeah.

[31:18] For more.

[31:19] You know, if that starts, look, if they're like, look, you want season, you want another season to Batman.

[31:25] It's another 500 bucks.

[31:27] Like that's the next thing.

[31:29] And I don't know, you know, like three spike three just having a game like strange or things.

[31:37] Oh, do you want season five?

[31:39] Pay 60 bucks more and it will be on luck and all collectors.

[31:44] Sixty.

[31:44] I mean, all of them.

[31:46] Oh, they're not all the collectors will buy it.

[31:50] Yeah.

[31:50] Well, the poor people will cry about it, but all the collectors will buy it.

[31:55] I mean, well, they.

[31:57] Know, they know their target audience has very little self control and a lot of money.

[32:03] And they're.

[32:05] This is the easiest industry to market to.

[32:08] If I was, you know, if I was marketing to this industry, like you don't even have to do much.

[32:12] You don't, you don't really have to do much.

[32:13] Just get a theme they want.

[32:15] Make a game that's got good flow, decent amount of mechs in it.

[32:19] And you're making money.

[32:20] That's why watching companies like American Pinball, like not be able to figure this out after a decade is comical.

[32:26] Like it's comical.

[32:27] Like how hard is it?

[32:28] Like a company called Barrels of Fun is doing laps around you and you had years to make Galactic Tank Force.

[32:34] It's just weird to me, you know.

[32:36] And so, James, 20.

[32:37] And new franchise art that helps.

[32:40] I mean, but it's just like art's not going to save a Tank Force game.

[32:44] Like you can't.

[32:45] Hey, it's so obvious what people want in this hobby.

[32:49] And Stern knows it and Stern does it time and time again.

[32:52] And look, every once in a while, Stern has a theme that's not that popular.

[32:56] Like, you know, like Venom, you know, they'll make games that maybe are lukewarm responses, but then they can easily just, right?

[33:04] In three months, they're going to have another game or four months, another game.

[33:06] And then they can rerun a hit game that they use.

[33:08] Their portfolio right now is so robust with amazing games.

[33:14] They're insulated for the next five years because even if they don't have hit after hit, they can do a hit and then a classic hit.

[33:22] And I know that Seth said they're never going to remake Ellie's, which was probably the biggest news yesterday.

[33:28] Was, all right, finally, everyone who owns a Ghostbusters Ellie, a Batman Ellie or SLE.

[33:34] Everyone who owns like an older Stern Ellie can now sleep at night knowing they're not going to rerun and make more like another 500 run of Ghostbusters.

[33:43] But what he did not say is that he didn't clarify whether an anniversary edition.

[33:50] With new art, right?

[33:53] With new art and new translate.

[33:55] Like, he didn't clarify if an anniversary edition, you know, also won't be done because that's what I would still be nervous about.

[34:03] Okay.

[34:04] So it was, from Stern, it was like no more Ellie's, but we can make a...

[34:10] Well, think about Jurassic Park, for example, right?

[34:11] So Jurassic Park, they didn't rerun the original Ellie.

[34:16] No.

[34:16] They ran a new anniversary edition.

[34:19] A beta version.

[34:21] Yeah.

[34:21] And which made everybody lose.

[34:23] Everybody lost in that scenario.

[34:25] So I don't know if Seth was saying we're never doing that again, or, you know, we're not going to remake older Ellie's, like, exactly the way they were before.

[34:35] So...

[34:36] I mean, they should just come up with a clear statement then.

[34:39] I mean, out to the public and saying, but why shouldn't Stern be allowed to make anniversary editions?

[34:48] Why not?

[34:51] It's not company.

[34:52] You own Stern.

[34:53] What?

[34:53] Why not?

[34:55] Well, you know, I'll tell you why.

[34:56] Because even though you can do something as a company, you got to really ask, should we do this?

[35:01] Because if the people that have kept you in business all these years and the collectors that are buying everything you sell, you don't want to burn them, right?

[35:11] They're your bread and butter.

[35:12] Like, you want to make sure your base is happy with you and you don't need to do it.

[35:17] That's the thing is like Stern doesn't need it.

[35:19] Like they could do it.

[35:21] And look, but Chris, for a year ago, this scenario was different when we could get Ellie's for 10,000.

[35:30] Okay.

[35:30] And Stern, they built these games.

[35:33] They built all those Godzilla's for 10,000, 10,500 shipped to the people and people sold them through 13,000.

[35:42] It doesn't matter.

[35:43] It doesn't matter.

[35:43] Like you want to see...

[35:44] Yes, it does.

[35:45] No, it doesn't.

[35:47] You want to see your product.

[35:49] You want to see your product selling from more on the secondhand market.

[35:52] It's a good sign.

[35:54] You know, look, if Chevrolet sees that people are flipping zero six Corvettes for 100,000 over sticker, which they are, right?

[36:00] The car is 150,000.

[36:02] You could buy it from a dealership.

[36:05] Now the dealer might want to market up $100,000 and try to gouge people, which they're doing.

[36:10] But if you're Chevrolet, right, you're the OEM, you're the manufacturer.

[36:15] They're not going to look at that.

[36:16] And then next year charge 200,000 or 250,000 for the car.

[36:21] Because they have much, much more cars than pimple machines.

[36:25] No, no, no.

[36:26] We're talking about 1,000 Elis.

[36:29] Okay.

[36:29] 1,000 Elis.

[36:30] That's it.

[36:31] It's just, but again, like...

[36:32] They're just sitting there.

[36:33] We're going to look at the design.

[36:36] Yeah, but they ruin the Elie market.

[36:37] They design, they build, they do everything.

[36:39] The Elie...

[36:40] Yeah, but Jenga's the Elie.

[36:41] They've ruined their Elie market now.

[36:43] It's ruined.

[36:43] Jaws is just a blip in it.

[36:45] But what happens when Dungeons & Dragons comes out and you want 13 for it?

[36:50] Or like John Wick?

[36:51] People are not going to spend 13,000.

[36:53] And so now...

[36:54] John Wick is an awesome theme.

[36:56] With stern lighting, it's not going to look great.

[36:59] It's not.

[37:00] Maybe it will be Spike 3 with amazing light show.

[37:04] It's like, look what happened to James Bond.

[37:06] Imagine if you bought James Bond Elie, right?

[37:09] If you bought Foo Fighters James Bond and Venom Elie,

[37:13] you bought those three games.

[37:14] You lost, you're waiting for it.

[37:16] You lost over $10,000 in a year and a half buying what should have been

[37:22] games that used to hold value, right?

[37:25] You can't name a stern Elie between the years of 2014 and 2019.

[37:31] You can't name one stern Elie that lost $3,000 in value.

[37:34] Not one.

[37:35] From what it's not even your WWE that you're in love with.

[37:39] There's not one.

[37:41] And so now as these owners, as these collectors are waking up from the

[37:46] COVID frenzy, holy crap, I just lost 10 grand on three games.

[37:53] And if I had just waited, just not years, just waited like eight months,

[37:59] I could have got every single game I bought for $3,000 less.

[38:04] And look, Jaws is going to be interesting because as we look at this game,

[38:07] not today, but let's look at this game six months from now with a thousand

[38:12] Elies in the world.

[38:13] Do you really think they're going to be going for 14, 50?

[38:15] No, come on.

[38:16] Not no, we're absolutely not.

[38:18] The game looks cool.

[38:19] The game looks cool.

[38:21] I didn't say it didn't look cool, but is it $13,000 in that package?

[38:26] I don't know.

[38:26] Some people in the industry, they are so rich, they don't care about losing.

[38:31] I get that.

[38:31] But those people, nothing matters.

[38:33] Like it doesn't, it's there, but there is not a thousand of those people either.

[38:38] And now, and the thing is, those games that you're saying there, James Spahn,

[38:44] that's not a bad game.

[38:46] James Spahn is not a bad game.

[38:48] Now, what?

[38:49] Two fighters is not a bad game.

[38:52] Venom, you mentioned Venom.

[38:53] L. E. is not a bad game.

[38:56] The pro.

[38:58] I feel the pro.

[38:59] It was.

[39:00] There's very few bad games in Pimble.

[39:03] Let's be honest, right?

[39:04] Like Thunderbirds is bad.

[39:05] Spinal Tap is bad.

[39:07] Star Wars.

[39:08] Star Wars is brutal compared to, you know, there's very few games, though, that

[39:13] I think people have a visceral reaction to.

[39:17] But, you know, that being said, we also just can't always make the excuse that,

[39:23] you know, this is what it is and it's now going to be this forever, regardless of

[39:27] what's in the game.

[39:28] You know, the whole value discussion is, I don't know, it's a healthy discussion to

[39:32] have.

[39:32] I kind of find it weird when people try to say, like, if a game is fun, it could,

[39:38] it could be worth anything.

[39:38] You know what the number one selling sports car was last year?

[39:42] Had the biggest increase in sales in a world in which there's all these

[39:45] expensive, the Mazda Miata.

[39:47] Mazda Miata.

[39:48] The most fun.

[39:49] It's the most fun you can have in it.

[39:51] You have your Mazda.

[39:52] Have you ever owned the Mazda?

[39:54] We own two Mazda Miatas.

[39:56] And when we had, when my family, my dad likes cars, so there were periods we had

[40:00] Dodge Viper M3, Z06 Corvette.

[40:04] We had, you know, Porsche Boxers, S2000 Hondas, like, super STIs.

[40:10] Like we, we, nice stuff, right?

[40:12] Yeah.

[40:13] The, the Mazda Miata was the most fun I've ever had in a car.

[40:16] And of all the cars we've owned and the, the lightweight, it was like Mario Kart on

[40:21] the street.

[40:22] You could pull the e-brake and slide down the block.

[40:24] It was so much fun.

[40:26] Um, and it just goes to show you, you know, I guess one thing too with pinball,

[40:30] you know, the guys you buy the pros, as much as pros are for hoes, the guys you buy

[40:35] the pros are probably having the most fun.

[40:37] Like the game plays.

[40:38] Have you seen the back glass?

[40:40] The pro and Ellie looks like the same.

[40:42] I don't like that.

[40:43] You know, Stern screwed over the premium guys in this one because obviously you're

[40:47] going to want the iconic movie poster.

[40:49] I don't know why.

[40:50] No, I think the premium back glass is awesome.

[40:54] No, stupid.

[40:54] Not the pro and Ellie.

[40:56] It looks stupid.

[40:57] There's a guy with like, it's like Quint with the machete.

[40:59] It looks stupid.

[41:00] Like that's not a job.

[41:01] Have you seen Frenchies?

[41:03] Christopher Frenchies?

[41:04] Yeah, he's got two left.

[41:05] Did you make a bid?

[41:06] Did you make a bid?

[41:08] No, but it looks awesome, man.

[41:10] I even think he's actually kind of fits with where they went with the art because

[41:15] if you look at what you mean by make a bid, he's selling his last two, his last two.

[41:21] You know this, his last two he'll ever make.

[41:25] You can bid your the amount you want to spend on it and the highest bid takes it.

[41:29] So I put out a what was the bid up on now?

[41:33] No, he won't say it's all private.

[41:35] It's like you have to email him.

[41:37] It's closed.

[41:39] So I bid $13,000 for it.

[41:43] Let's see if he accepts my bid.

[41:45] Oh, he's back.

[41:45] Did you know that Christopher French is back?

[41:49] He's going to interview everybody.

[41:50] He's going to interview you and everybody.

[41:52] Have you heard?

[41:53] He should.

[41:53] Look, if he wants to get the most listens ever, he should interview me.

[41:58] You know, I would take that out instead of always slamming me.

[42:02] Franchi, I'm going to I knew you're going to listen to this.

[42:04] How about you have Canada on?

[42:06] Do you have the guts, Franchi, to have a nice fireside?

[42:09] I think it's like an evening, a dinner, I don't know, some dinner conversation.

[42:13] There's like a candelabra.

[42:15] If you do it with Canada, Franchi, I guarantee you, you'll get the most listens ever.

[42:19] All right.

[42:20] All right.

[42:20] But no, look, he does great interviews.

[42:22] I've always said it.

[42:22] I don't know why he keeps turning the show off.

[42:25] Like just you don't have to rage quit now that the Twippies are gone.

[42:29] We all know there's no more competing.

[42:32] It's just everyone just do, you know, do your content, have your fun.

[42:36] And you don't have to like exit.

[42:37] You can just take a pause and take a break.

[42:40] What did he say there when you when he rage quit it?

[42:45] It was something with you, right?

[42:47] I don't know.

[42:48] I don't think so.

[42:48] I don't think so.

[42:49] I think you know, OK, OK, the Twippies brought out

[42:52] the best and the worst in the game.

[42:54] But you're saying you're saying the Twippies are done and he can just come back.

[42:59] But the people's choice awards is not done.

[43:01] We're just started.

[43:03] You just started.

[43:04] Yeah, we're going to be better.

[43:06] When are the Twippy results getting published?

[43:09] Do you know?

[43:12] I don't know.

[43:14] I mean, the votes summer or either April or something.

[43:17] I think voting still open for like 10 more days.

[43:20] So can't wait to see how many thousands of people contributed

[43:25] to the awards show nobody cares about.

[43:27] I actually voted on Twippies and I and I filled my voting

[43:31] and I got totally confused with the with everything that was included in one.

[43:36] It was, yeah, check out my video.

[43:39] I don't know.

[43:40] There's like the dropdowns became like 200 content creators and 200 websites.

[43:46] It was just it.

[43:48] It was confusing for me.

[43:49] I don't listen to that much podcast and I love watching videos.

[43:55] But the podcast is not my thing.

[44:00] To round everything up, we start the video with your Elise to three or five

[44:06] Elise, whatever.

[44:08] Are you going to have one for yourself?

[44:10] Are you going to flip them?

[44:11] What are your thoughts?

[44:13] Yeah, I mean, the more you hold your Elise spots.

[44:18] No, I don't know.

[44:19] I mean, I have to make a decision today.

[44:24] You know, my my distributor friends are nice and I also don't want to keep them

[44:28] from a sale. So that's that's always how I roll.

[44:31] They're not going to have a problem selling it.

[44:33] I mean, they know that.

[44:35] You know, I'm most likely leaning on just letting it go.

[44:40] Like, I'm not, you know, I don't want to be a scalper anymore.

[44:42] Like, it's just a negative vibes.

[44:44] Like it's let someone have it.

[44:46] It's it's going to be a fun game.

[44:48] It's not a theme for me.

[44:49] It like if I was like a Jaws aficionado, here's the thing,

[44:53] my money is going towards back to the future.

[44:56] And I also just want to say this, there is this really wrong

[44:59] rumor spreading through Pinside that back to the future does not have the assets

[45:03] and that stern past on it because of that.

[45:05] That is absolutely incorrect. Joe Kamnikal.

[45:08] I heard that.

[45:10] I heard that on a podcast show.

[45:12] I don't know. It was on flipping out.

[45:13] It was on. They said it.

[45:15] It's not true. It's inaccurate.

[45:17] And it's it's, you know, it's it's not true.

[45:20] So if you are excited about back to the future, I'm here to tell you,

[45:24] you should remain excited.

[45:26] It's going to have the assets.

[45:28] We're also going to get a lot of, I think, cool stuff this year, Jeng is.

[45:32] I think Matrix.

[45:34] I think Mark Saden's first game at Jersey Jack is going to be really cool.

[45:40] I think I'm working forward to that.

[45:42] And he's getting he's getting help from Eric Minier.

[45:46] He's getting help, support from Eric, support from Steve Ritchie.

[45:51] And I think he was designing a pet Lola was there also.

[45:55] So if it has got all the magic and help and help,

[45:59] Lola is not helping anybody.

[46:01] He wasn't he wasn't a help.

[46:03] Here's the thing. This next game from Jersey Jack,

[46:06] I really do feel like this is it.

[46:08] Like this is it.

[46:09] Like you're either going to show us what you got.

[46:12] If it's Matrix, you got to do it right.

[46:14] It's got to have the assets from the movies, from the first movie people want.

[46:18] If Jersey Jack has four strikes in a row.

[46:22] I mean, I get it.

[46:24] Like you're a billionaire, your billionaire son is running the company.

[46:27] But it's kind of embarrassing.

[46:29] You've got all the money in the world and you can't put it together.

[46:32] And this is it.

[46:33] Like Elton John is cool.

[46:34] Nobody's buying it. Everybody knows that they're already making the CEs.

[46:37] I've never seen Jersey Jack.

[46:39] They're not getting any orders for the platinum.

[46:41] And, you know, they're going to have to quickly move to the next game

[46:44] because there's no one's ordering this Elton John game in two months.

[46:48] Nobody like they're going to, you know, it's going to come and go.

[46:51] Is it out in the secondary market in the US?

[46:54] I mean, they're just rolling out, right?

[46:57] I haven't really seen any for sale yet, but I know that CE buyers are here.

[47:01] I'm so excited.

[47:03] Going to unbox it next week.

[47:05] I just I really want, you know, this is what makes me a little bit sad is

[47:08] looking at Jaws, seeing where we're at in pinball right now.

[47:12] I'm just really sad that Jersey Jack is not in the race anymore.

[47:15] They're not even they're not even close to being

[47:18] the second most exciting games in pinball right now.

[47:21] They're not even close. The sales aren't there.

[47:23] The games haven't been there.

[47:24] It's now it's now.

[47:25] OK, to be honest, no bashing, no nothing.

[47:29] Right. JPP is not making bad games.

[47:34] I mean, look at Elton John.

[47:38] Are beautiful.

[47:39] A light show you're talking about beautiful.

[47:42] And I listen to the audio on the beautiful audio.

[47:45] Everything is awesome.

[47:47] The thing is with JJP.

[47:49] Why isn't it selling the team?

[47:52] Cool. Cool.

[47:53] They may. Yeah.

[47:55] Jack has made Jack made themes.

[47:56] He wanted.

[47:59] Elton John, Godfather.

[48:00] I'm telling you if Toy Story 4, those are three

[48:04] very question of one story one, but that's another question.

[48:07] But when you saw what happened when they got Godfather,

[48:12] when they got guns and roses, yeah, it's like six thousand of them.

[48:18] So when they get a great theme, yeah, they will sell.

[48:22] But who's fault is that?

[48:24] That's my thing is like, who's fault?

[48:25] How can you go three three B themes in a row?

[48:29] You know, like, how do you misread your own market?

[48:32] I mean, look, and here's the sad truth, Jeng is.

[48:34] And I don't mean to be stride in here.

[48:36] If you remove the abyss money, if you remove

[48:40] AIM Trom's money from AIM Trom from Mukesh's money from American Pimbal,

[48:45] if you remove both of that funding, if these.

[48:49] You heard you mean like a normal business where you have to survive on your own sales, right?

[48:54] There's no outside annuity.

[48:56] These companies are American.

[48:57] Pimbal was dumb.

[48:58] But companies are out of business.

[49:00] They're out of business.

[49:01] And so like what's sad is they have all that financial backing.

[49:06] Everyone there is getting a good paycheck and they still can't make great games.

[49:11] Like they're just not doing it.

[49:12] And Stern Pimbal, like there's more.

[49:15] I think you need that pressure.

[49:17] Like we've got to make these games sell because we've got this big factory.

[49:20] We've got all these people.

[49:21] We've got investors.

[49:22] We we we have to deliver.

[49:24] I don't get that sense of urgency from Jersey Jack.

[49:27] I don't get it from American Pimbal.

[49:29] You know, I get it from Spooky.

[49:31] Spooky's got to feed.

[49:32] They got to feed the families of all those people working there.

[49:35] And they know that to sell a lot of Scooby-Doo's to produce the other games.

[49:42] I mean, it is what they're also like helping in a company.

[49:45] And the thing I like about Spooky, you know, for all of like for all the arrows

[49:49] they take, I mean, look, they're they're kind of self aware.

[49:52] We're not going to sell 2000 chainsaws or loony tunes.

[49:55] So let's make eight, eight, eight of each.

[49:57] You know, the game design looks much better than their previous designs.

[50:01] And I think, you know, they're going to sell those games, whether they sell all of them.

[50:04] But then they've got two more games in development.

[50:07] And, you know, they're going to keep chucking, chucking, chucking along.

[50:11] And, you know, but Spooky Pimbal, they're not taking money from people.

[50:16] You know, they're not they're not like taking money from an investor.

[50:18] They built this company from the ground up and they've slowly built to a point now

[50:24] where they're probably selling more games a year than Jersey Jack.

[50:28] Like that's embarrassing to JJP.

[50:33] It's and I love Jack.

[50:34] I love JJ.

[50:35] The thing about JJP and I always say this, the reason why I get so deflated

[50:39] is after 10 years of being in Pimbal, Jersey Jack should be hitting with

[50:44] with its best games ever.

[50:47] And if you put Elton John next to Wizard of Oz, just throw the mic over your shoulder.

[50:51] I'm out of here. Luke Skywalker, lightsaber over the shoulder.

[50:54] Like we're done with this.

[50:55] How is this? How is this an advancement over this? It's not, you know?

[50:59] And like I get it.

[51:00] This year, 2024.

[51:03] This is it.

[51:04] This is like matrix loaded.

[51:07] But what if it's not?

[51:08] The thing is, if it's not, if it's if it's another empty game with like non

[51:13] assets aren't saved up, what would happen?

[51:16] It's a nice team.

[51:17] It's a nice team.

[51:18] It has great music.

[51:20] If I don't, I could design that game and sell it.

[51:25] Make sure the matrix game that was made in the Netherlands when they reskin

[51:29] Johnny Mnemonic is amazing.

[51:31] Right? It's like it's got mechs.

[51:33] They they it's got the phone booth.

[51:35] It's got the sentinels.

[51:36] It's so awesomely done.

[51:38] Right. Jersey Jack better bring it.

[51:41] I mean, I want to see real mechs.

[51:43] I want to see I want to see though the first movie.

[51:47] I want to see ball at time action with magnets where the balls you like.

[51:50] Come on, guys.

[51:51] This is this is not going to you're not going to win with 3,800 RGB LEDs.

[51:57] Like, look, Elton John could light up a city block.

[52:01] It could you could put that damn game and it could light up a city block.

[52:04] Like and it sounds amazing.

[52:06] It looks amazing.

[52:07] It lights up the room and you just don't want to buy it.

[52:12] And and that's because.

[52:14] You don't want to lose four grand, three grand in like six months.

[52:17] Nobody wants to lose money.

[52:20] And it's not fun enough to justify the price.

[52:23] That's the thing.

[52:24] No, Chris Chris Chris.

[52:26] Number one pinball podcast in the world.

[52:29] Cheers, Chris.

[52:30] The numbers do lie.

[52:31] We did this because we wanted to talk about Jaws.

[52:36] Yeah. Well, we talked about a little bit more.

[52:38] We gave people more for the money.

[52:40] I mean, making stuff like this as friends, we just jump over

[52:44] and have a friendly conversation instead of talking about Jaws.

[52:49] We are all over the place.

[52:50] Put it all up. Put it all up.

[52:52] Look, anyone who watches this, it's free.

[52:55] They didn't pay for this.

[52:56] So if they don't like it, they don't get a refund

[52:58] because it didn't cost them anything other than their time.

[53:01] No, they're going to love this stuff.

[53:02] Jangs, people love this stuff.

[53:03] They love you.

[53:04] There's only so much we can talk about with Jaws.

[53:06] We haven't seen any of the code, man. It's just what I'm really looking forward

[53:10] to the Jack Danger video.

[53:12] Jack is there.

[53:13] Keith Elwin is there.

[53:14] Josh Gomez is there.

[53:15] It's going to be.

[53:16] You did this.

[53:17] And it is there.

[53:18] It's going to be awesome.

[53:20] Joel did this great video where he outlined all the shots in the game.

[53:24] You know, the flipping out stream.

[53:25] And then he took it down because I think Stern went after him

[53:28] because he showed the the images from the video.

[53:30] Maybe he's put it back up by now.

[53:32] But here's my thing.

[53:33] What what what what did what?

[53:36] No, they showed they did.

[53:39] Yeah. No, I think they did a great.

[53:41] They did a great YouTube where they showed all the different shot geometry

[53:44] and Jaws and they went off of like the leaked trailer.

[53:49] Anyway, look, Jaws pinball.

[53:51] What's your final word on it?

[53:52] Jengas, is it going to be the number one game of all time?

[53:54] Where do you see it in the top 10?

[53:55] Is this Keith Elwin's masterpiece?

[53:57] Did it live up to your expectations?

[53:58] Give us your final thoughts in a minute.

[54:00] And now it's going to be just in between.

[54:05] Godzilla here.

[54:08] Foo Fighters here.

[54:10] Jaws is going to be here.

[54:13] Absolutely. That's how I feel.

[54:14] It's not going to be better than Godzilla.

[54:17] Godzilla is so special, but it's just under Godzilla.

[54:21] I think I think I think it's going to sell well.

[54:26] What do you think?

[54:27] It's going to sell great. Yes, it's going to sell great.

[54:29] I kind of agree.

[54:30] I think I don't I don't think it's going to dethrone Godzilla.

[54:34] I don't think the you know, I don't think the the the license is as energetic

[54:38] and as fun as Godzilla.

[54:40] So I don't think the personality is going to be there. Right.

[54:42] It's not. Yeah, it's just like three old.

[54:45] We like one campy.

[54:47] Yeah, I think it's fine.

[54:49] Like I think mechanically, the game is leaves a lot to be desired.

[54:52] I was looking for more from a mechanical standpoint.

[54:55] But again, I think it's going to be above Jurassic Park.

[54:57] I think it's going to be below Godzilla and you know, Elwin's fan base.

[55:01] The pin side 100 is kind of irrelevant because they'll vote it up.

[55:04] It'll it'll it'll it'll open at number one.

[55:07] This is what will happen.

[55:08] They always do the story.

[55:10] But yeah, remember what what game went to number one recently?

[55:13] Everyone was like, what? Like, how did that get there?

[55:14] I think it was like Godfather was there for like.

[55:16] Yeah, Godfather was number one.

[55:18] I feel like a day.

[55:19] And they'd like an alien.

[55:21] It was amazing.

[55:22] Everyone caught wind of it and then they shoved it back down into the 20s.

[55:25] It was like, I doubt there's no JJP in the top.

[55:28] Like I think 25 right now.

[55:31] But anyway, yeah, it'll do just fine.

[55:33] I think, you know, is this the two year and the waiting masterpiece game

[55:37] that was going to change every year?

[55:39] I know it's another pinball machine. It's a good effort.

[55:42] I don't think it's Elwin's best.

[55:44] But you know, look, if you love the theme, you got to draw as pinball.

[55:48] You got it from the best designer in all of pinball, you know, and you're happy.

[55:51] And that's what pinball is about.

[55:52] Like you want the theme you love to be made by the company that's going to do it right

[55:57] and do it justice, you know, moment of silence for all the Princess Bride fans

[56:02] out there that now have to go buy a multi-mortific.

[56:05] Oh, I think the theme integration on this game on the early, not the pro on the early

[56:13] with the little boat with the big boat that opera play field.

[56:17] I think if you if you like the theme, if you like the movies,

[56:21] you have got the greatest designer, you have got great shots on layout

[56:24] and you have got you have got toys.

[56:27] We don't know yet.

[56:28] I mean, on the pro, when you shoot the ball,

[56:32] you shoot a ball to the left and a ball in the middle.

[56:35] That's what you aim for. OK. Yeah.

[56:38] But but on the premium, you have the ball to the left.

[56:41] But here you have got the shark.

[56:43] I think you should they make OK pros.

[56:47] But on this one, I mean, I urge everybody to buy the premium early.

[56:53] Yeah, but he was everyone's everyone's realizing this as I look at the game is,

[56:57] you know, you think about it, if you remove how can you have a software run

[57:00] on both of them, you know, pretty similar.

[57:02] And the the upper play field is really just a glorified diverter in the game.

[57:07] And so like it's not it's not really doing that much.

[57:10] You know, it has got the spinner on the upper play field.

[57:14] So yeah, it's the diverter of the pro.

[57:17] The upper play field, it is a glorified diverter.

[57:20] You know, it doesn't really have like its own sort of like

[57:23] mini world experience up there that I think people might think.

[57:27] I mean, look, but again, Cengiz, I look at the boat on Pirates of the Caribbean

[57:31] and then I look at this games boats.
