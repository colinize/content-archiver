[00:00] This is about saving the future of humanity.

[00:02] John will blow up the damn ship!

[00:04] No!

[00:06] No!

[00:14] I thought this week would be a quiet week in the world of pinball news,

[00:19] but low and behold, a lot of stuff has happened this week that we have to talk about

[00:24] on this episode of the Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:28] I think we're at episode 78, but we saw stuff like alien pinball out in the wild.

[00:35] We got an announcement from P3 and Jerry about some stuff going on over there.

[00:42] There is more and is sort of bickering going back and forth when it comes to Mr. KPG's

[00:50] playfield and Ghostbusters.

[00:52] So we want to tackle that and maybe a few more items on this episode of the Canadian pinball

[00:57] podcast.

[00:58] But first, before we jump in, I really have to address something that just makes me think

[01:04] that my listeners are not that intelligent.

[01:09] Here's what my problem is.

[01:11] I interviewed the black knight on probably what was one of my best interviews about pinball

[01:18] that I've done.

[01:19] It was very informative.

[01:21] We sort of tackled a little bit of the history of pinball where the market's going, where

[01:25] we think it's going.

[01:26] It was an incredible interview.

[01:28] We talked for an hour and 50 minutes.

[01:32] Now here's what I did.

[01:33] I broke up that podcast into two parts.

[01:37] Two parts.

[01:38] So why when I look at the listening of each part, 140 peep, there's 140 more listens

[01:48] to part two than to part one.

[01:52] I don't get that.

[01:54] I specifically said in part two of that interview that there's a part one and that don't start

[02:00] with episode 77.

[02:01] So if you're out there and you've listened to just one episode recently where I interviewed

[02:07] the black knight, there is another interview that happened right before that episode and

[02:14] that was episode 76.

[02:15] So I'm really confused as to why those interviews aren't close in number, especially that part

[02:21] one doesn't have more listens than part two.

[02:24] All right.

[02:25] Let's jump right into the topic of the night and this podcast is called Almost Alien because

[02:34] it seems like we're getting close.

[02:37] And I know close is a word that doesn't mean anything to people in the pinball world.

[02:44] But this week we saw at the EAG show over in Europe, Highway Pinball had a booth and

[02:52] this story takes some twist in turns.

[02:56] Before we got to this show, what we know is this.

[02:59] We know that Andrew Highway said that he was bringing two games to the show that we're

[03:04] going to go home with customers.

[03:06] These were going to be the first sort of whether they're beta or first couple production

[03:13] games that we're going to be brought to the show.

[03:16] So we were told that we've also been told that this week was when games were going to

[03:23] start going into production the second week of January.

[03:26] So there's that.

[03:27] So I know that I think it was 20 or 30 machines were promised to go out in January or production

[03:34] in January and the LEDs were going to start to go into production in February.

[03:40] I'm not sure if that means LEDs are coming out in February or March.

[03:44] So what happened?

[03:47] The worst possible thing happened on the first day of the show.

[03:51] They got there.

[03:52] The games were out on the floor and I heard within just a matter of minutes the games were

[03:58] experiencing some issues.

[04:02] There was some issues with the board I believe and the games were quickly taken off the

[04:06] show floor and brought into the back area to be worked on.

[04:11] And the games remained off the show floor for the entire day.

[04:14] So that was day one.

[04:17] That is a nightmare for highway.

[04:19] Right?

[04:20] It sucks.

[04:21] You know, we all know making pinball is hard.

[04:24] It sucks to come to a show like that and have day one be so tumultuous for them.

[04:32] And look, these machines have thousands of parts.

[04:34] And we know they were scrambling last minute to get the game together for the show.

[04:38] So how do we feel about that?

[04:42] That's the first thing that's happened.

[04:43] And I think it just goes to show that months in the world of making pinball are like dog

[04:51] months.

[04:52] Right?

[04:53] You know, the way one year in human year is seven years in terms of being a dog.

[04:58] I feel like that's what it's like with pinball manufacturing because the fact that this

[05:04] machine wasn't rock solid and ready to go before the curtain was pulled off it at this

[05:10] show is a head scratcher.

[05:12] And I think some people have said it, how can you bring a machine to a show where you're

[05:17] really putting the thing together like the day before the night before that is really

[05:24] cutting it close.

[05:27] And problems happened.

[05:29] And we saw the same thing happen when this machine came to Expo back in October.

[05:34] The games had mechanical issues.

[05:37] That was four months ago.

[05:39] So the reason why I say I think months in the world of pinball production, one month,

[05:46] not much happens in a month.

[05:49] When I count the number of days that this machine has been worked on to get it ready for this

[05:54] show, it still feels like there's work to be done.

[05:58] And I guess that's my overall take is that do you think that highway is going to go

[06:06] into production in the next week or two?

[06:10] And I don't think so.

[06:11] And I think someone said it the best on pinside that it's time now.

[06:16] And I said this before and I'll say it again.

[06:19] It's time now for them to stop bringing the game around to stop showing people the game

[06:27] until the game is working properly because the only thing that you accomplish when you

[06:32] bring a game that is not polished, that is not done at this stage, at this stage, because

[06:38] you're so far behind, is you are simply making people feel anxious and nervous about the

[06:48] game being finished anytime soon.

[06:52] You also will have a hard time asking people to pay up because at this stage in the game,

[07:01] if I'm being asked for money, I really think the game is ready to go.

[07:05] And from what we saw on day one, the game wasn't ready to go.

[07:10] And the official statement we got was there were some board issues.

[07:14] There seems like there were some delays.

[07:17] I think it was China in getting the boards.

[07:20] And some there were some soldering issues with the boards and whatnot.

[07:24] So that was day one, day one nightmare, right?

[07:26] Worst thing that could happen, not what people wanted to see.

[07:29] Day two, things are better.

[07:31] We've got a machine on the floor and people are able to play it.

[07:35] Games not 100% working as we could see.

[07:38] The LCD screen in the back box wasn't displaying at full size.

[07:46] So there was that.

[07:48] And it was interesting because people started to speculate, wait a minute, there's more

[07:52] than one display happening on that screen.

[07:55] So maybe that means there's going to be dual video feeds happening.

[08:00] But I think it's just something with how there was a glitch in the board and how they

[08:05] could present it.

[08:06] I apologize, listener.

[08:07] If you hear some slurping sound, Bubba decided to get up off the ground and just goping

[08:13] water down next to me.

[08:15] All right, let's get back to Alien.

[08:17] So there's that.

[08:19] But by far, the talk of the entire reveal at this show for the most part revolved around

[08:28] the beacons on top of the game.

[08:31] And you can go on the pin side, you can see the beacons.

[08:34] They are these big clunky items that sit on top of the back box.

[08:39] Now if you look at the alien flyer and the alien banners that have been used to sell the

[08:44] early and to give you an example of the early might look like there's these nice like

[08:49] streamline beacons that are on there.

[08:53] But the ones on the machine, they don't look good.

[08:57] They look really, really bad.

[09:00] And a lot of people are saying that.

[09:02] And we're at right now where toppers, like it or not, are I think a feature that people

[09:10] really enjoy on an early machine.

[09:13] And not only that, I think we're at an age now where topper development is really blowing

[09:20] people away.

[09:21] The topper on Batman 66 is probably the nicest topper I've ever seen on the machine.

[09:27] The kiss topper was really cool.

[09:29] I didn't really like the Ghostbusters topper.

[09:32] But the AeroSmith topper, have you seen that?

[09:35] It's turned to put up a video of that.

[09:36] It looks incredible.

[09:37] So I think for a highway to show these beacon toppers right now is just bad timing because

[09:45] of what other people are seeing and how awesome those toppers are.

[09:48] And Andrew chimed in.

[09:50] He's good to chime in when people are giving feedback on Pinside.

[09:53] And he said, look, when the lights are off in the room, these beacons produce the best

[09:59] effect in a dark room.

[10:01] And I get that.

[10:02] Totally get that.

[10:03] That these things produce the best sort of visual pop and they look like the old beacons

[10:11] in the movies that doesn't change the fact that they look like crap on top of the machine.

[10:16] There has to be a point where someone steps back and says, this just doesn't look good.

[10:22] This just doesn't look right.

[10:24] And I've said it before and I've been critical of the aesthetic final decisions being made

[10:30] on alien machines and highway pimbal machines in general.

[10:33] I just don't think that I have someone who can stand back and look at a machine and say,

[10:38] this doesn't look right.

[10:40] We saw it on the same thing with the color of the plastic under the flippers, right?

[10:47] It's white.

[10:48] It's still white at the show.

[10:49] I know they're going to be black in final production.

[10:53] But at some point someone looked at that white piece and said, this is good.

[10:59] Let's keep going.

[11:01] And so, you know, look, a lot of talk was about the beacons.

[11:04] Now we did get to see some gameplay footage and I can't really make an assessment of the

[11:10] game.

[11:11] It's too early to tell.

[11:12] None of the video footage I saw sort of blew me away.

[11:17] And I've said this before though, this is not just alien pimbal.

[11:20] I think pimbal video footage in general is not that interesting to look at.

[11:26] It's very rare you can watch gameplay footage of a game and just be blown away.

[11:30] So there's that.

[11:33] I'm still waiting to see if it really does catapult people into the world of alien without

[11:39] Sigourney Weaver.

[11:40] I mean, to me that's just going to be the challenge.

[11:44] I think it'll be much more of the second movie because of that.

[11:49] But let's wait and see.

[11:51] And what I did see the LCD next to the alien head, you know, I think it looks better than

[11:58] the Queen Chamberlok that was there before.

[12:02] It still just feels like it's so incoherensive, everything going on on this game.

[12:09] It just doesn't blend together.

[12:13] It just doesn't feel like, you know, like if you were going to design an entire game around

[12:17] that big alien xenomorph head, then I would have molded it more of the back of the game

[12:23] to be maybe the body of the alien.

[12:25] And I don't know, maybe make it like a great and it opens up in the alien head comes through.

[12:31] It just feels like things are just dropped on the play field that looks a little cluttered.

[12:37] I have to say.

[12:39] And as a wide body, it looks pretty wide open too.

[12:41] I mean, there's not much happening in the lower half of that play field.

[12:45] Everything is at the top end of that play field.

[12:49] So we'll see how fast it plays.

[12:52] It's definitely unique layout.

[12:53] It's got four flippers.

[12:56] But I can't make much of an assessment.

[12:58] I'll wait till I see more when it comes to gameplay.

[13:01] But you know, we're at the point now where I think it's time after this show for alien

[13:07] to just stop with the promises.

[13:12] You know, when I read Andrew's comments in the thread, I again just want to shake the

[13:16] man.

[13:17] Andrew, stop saying everything's a quick fix and it's all going to be done in a week or

[13:22] two.

[13:23] I mean, it's like the constant MO.

[13:26] I don't think the game is done.

[13:29] I know the game's probably further along.

[13:32] But all right, don't show the game again until it's done, until you have something that's

[13:39] ready to go in box.

[13:41] It's just not winning you any points because nobody believes you anymore.

[13:47] When you say things about dates and about how things are simple fixes because every

[13:52] time we see it, it's not shipping and there's still issues.

[13:56] So which leads me to my second point tonight that it probably couldn't be worse timing

[14:04] for Jerry from P3 to announce that P3 is in production.

[14:11] And I say that I think the timing is not great.

[14:14] And I don't know if there is a good time or not.

[14:17] But here's the news that P3, multi-morphic, the P3 platform is going into production.

[14:26] Now I want to pull up the pin-side thread about it because I want to make sure I get some

[14:30] of the dates right around this.

[14:34] But today he announced just a little while ago that production has begun.

[14:39] And we've talked before in this show about what does that mean?

[14:42] What does production mean?

[14:44] So he says right here that the first machines are expected to come off the line in late

[14:52] March with customer shipments commencing in April.

[14:58] So let's count that off.

[15:00] So we've got another half of January, February, March.

[15:05] So that's pretty soon, April.

[15:07] So three months when he expects games to start shipping.

[15:14] And so here's Jerry puts out this announcement.

[15:18] It's half sort of a sales pitch for the platform, half about how they're going to do it,

[15:26] how they're going to do contract manufacturing.

[15:29] Here's the key thing though.

[15:32] And this is something that I'm interested to see because if you read the pin-side thread,

[15:37] it's a lot of congratulations.

[15:39] This is awesome news.

[15:40] So glad to hear.

[15:41] I've always said people applaud Jerry and Jerry's efforts and they have people are fans

[15:47] of pinball innovation.

[15:49] But people may or may not vote with their wallets for this platform.

[15:55] And I'm really curious to see what the orders are.

[16:00] And this is now, this is the time because Jerry announces in his statement that we need

[16:06] to start collecting money now.

[16:08] The games need to start being paid for so we can get production going and in your machines

[16:15] to you.

[16:16] So this is going to be the point, right?

[16:18] This is going to be the point where his machine is around $10,000 and people have to pay

[16:23] up.

[16:24] And here's why I'm also cringing when I read Jerry's note.

[16:29] And I'm cringing for reason that I think you'll understand whenever we have been given

[16:36] a date about when people can expect their machine.

[16:41] And first of all, like those dates are never hit unless it's stern and unless it's spooky,

[16:48] I've never seen another manufacturer hit a date that they've set.

[16:53] Okay?

[16:54] Especially a date that we're getting now that is very aggressive.

[16:59] Three months is very aggressive.

[17:03] I don't know how I feel about that because I want Jerry to succeed and I don't know,

[17:11] you know, he says in his note, like parts 2800 parts.

[17:16] We have some parts.

[17:17] Other parts are being ordered.

[17:20] Other parts are being manufactured.

[17:22] Whenever I hear that that 2800 parts have to come together in one place at one time, screw

[17:30] together on an assembly line to finish a game and get that game to a customer, that makes

[17:35] me really, really nervous that you could promise someone a game in three months unless you

[17:42] have all those parts in.

[17:43] I said the same thing about Andrew Highway when he said production has begun and we're

[17:48] waiting on parts.

[17:50] I don't get that.

[17:53] Production does not begin on an automobile until it's on the line and that car, right,

[18:02] that first car when production begins is done that day.

[18:05] It's done that day.

[18:07] Production doesn't begin when you start manufacturing parts and you start working with

[18:13] vendors to supply you parts and that's the problem I keep seeing these pinball manufacturers

[18:21] fall into.

[18:22] It's a trap they all fall into and I know why they fall into it.

[18:26] They fall into it simply because they need money, right?

[18:30] These companies have capital that they need to raise to order the parts, to manufacture

[18:37] the parts, to get your machines parts to the factory to then assemble for you.

[18:44] That period, right, that period of collecting your money and then getting you your machine

[18:50] when it was promised has rarely, rarely ever been hit.

[18:55] I only have seen spooky and stern really consistently deliver on a timeline and when it comes

[19:05] to taking pre-orders or paying for your game up front and now you have to wait, I think

[19:11] the climate to ask people to do that is over and that's why I'm nervous for Jerry because

[19:18] a few years ago, sure thing, people would have done it.

[19:23] But after what happened with MMR, after what happened with Dutch pinball, after what happened

[19:30] with J-Pop, after what happened with Alien, it's a series of people who have taken people's

[19:37] pre-order money and then not delivered.

[19:40] And then not delivered.

[19:41] I'm not saying that's going to happen here but the climate has to make people anxious

[19:47] about doing this and I've said it before, you should not set a date for release until

[19:54] you are 100% sure that you will hit that date because all you're going to do is upset

[20:02] people and you're going to keep your future sales or future customers away away.

[20:12] You got to be kidding me.

[20:13] There's no way people like right now are handing money, new money to Andrew Highway, they're

[20:19] just going to wait.

[20:20] Why wouldn't you just wait to it comes out?

[20:23] There's nothing you're seeing like in an Ellie package that means you have to go in

[20:27] now.

[20:28] In fact, you haven't even seen the Ellie package.

[20:33] There's no incentive to rush in.

[20:37] Only Stern can really create that environment of hype and rush to buy.

[20:42] Only Stern can do that because only Stern delivers the game to you during a period of your

[20:50] life where you're actually still alive.

[20:55] Stern doesn't make you wait.

[20:58] The same amount of time you have to wait between Star Wars movies to get your pinball machine,

[21:04] especially after they've taken your money.

[21:07] So that's the big question mark that I think is going to be interesting as we follow the pre-order

[21:15] model for P3.

[21:18] No people send Jerry Ten Grand.

[21:22] How many do you think will go in on it?

[21:26] He's also not releasing this machine with any sort of Ellie, any sort of hype package

[21:33] without a new title.

[21:37] The marketer in me still wanted Jerry to come up with a new title because we've been seeing

[21:42] Lexi for years.

[21:43] I know he always tells me it's not a title, Chris.

[21:47] It's a platform.

[21:49] You know how he feel about this.

[21:51] You're getting Lexi lights, but you're going to be playing that game for a long time.

[21:54] We hear all this about how the modular system makes it easy for other people to develop

[21:58] for the game and for the platform.

[22:01] Where are they?

[22:02] Where are all these other games that are so easy to put onto this platform?

[22:05] It's been years since we've seen it.

[22:08] It's been to every pinball show.

[22:10] Those are the only people that have the engineering knowledge or desire to make pinball games.

[22:17] And I haven't seen anyone else jump in to the ring.

[22:20] And maybe stuff is being worked on, but we haven't seen it.

[22:23] I do wish Jerry the best of luck.

[22:26] I just think the climate has shifted away from this model.

[22:31] I want you guys to email me what you think.

[22:34] Do you think it's going to succeed or do you not?

[22:38] I'm Nate at pinball at gmail.com.

[22:42] All right.

[22:43] So, interesting.

[22:45] Interesting to see what happens with these companies.

[22:46] A lot of these games are coming out around the same time as well.

[22:50] Alien, Ellie's will finally start to be shipping right around when games will finally be going

[22:56] out for P3.

[22:57] Will American pinball deliver on Houdini around like the second half or third quarter of the

[23:02] year?

[23:03] What's next from Stern?

[23:04] There's perfection happening.

[23:06] Stern is not just going to stop.

[23:07] We're going to keep going.

[23:08] I was like, a lot of people chasing after that dough.

[23:13] All right.

[23:14] What else is going on on the form that was pretty interesting in newsworthy and in the pinball

[23:19] world in general?

[23:21] I thought it was funny that Zambietti popped into the KPG thread on pinside.

[23:28] Now for those of you, you must have heard me say multiple times about KPG and his ghost

[23:34] busters issue and his open letter to Gary Stern and his petition.

[23:41] The guy won't stop.

[23:44] It's almost like they need to just rename pinside, KPG's pinside.

[23:49] His personal sandbox for him to make so many threads about his one issue with Stern pinball.

[23:58] And it's gotten to the point where, you know, whatever, enough is enough.

[24:01] Stern reached out.

[24:02] Trent told the guy.

[24:03] We're going to help him out.

[24:05] He won't wait.

[24:06] He just won't wait.

[24:07] And I thought it was Zambietti coming in and sort of made a pretty long like funny pose,

[24:12] sort of saying like, it's really, this is really my duplicate account for Jody.

[24:17] No, actually it's me.

[24:18] No, it's Jody.

[24:19] But he said one thing in there that I thought was really interesting.

[24:22] I want to talk about it a little bit.

[24:24] And that was, he said, you know, Stern cares.

[24:28] Like I work for Stern because I know they care and I know they take this stuff seriously.

[24:32] And they're not here to just like rip off everybody.

[24:34] They're not here to screw people over.

[24:38] And I know he's like, take it from me.

[24:40] I've worked with someone who did that with Jpop.

[24:43] But he did say something that really spoke volumes.

[24:47] And I think everyone should think about this a little bit.

[24:49] He's just, you know, it's just, sometimes I wonder if it's even worth it.

[24:54] Like just reading how much people complain and bitch about pinball.

[24:58] And you know, he's kind of right.

[25:02] He's kind of right.

[25:03] There is just, Stern takes so much heat, so much heat.

[25:07] And I really do feel bad.

[25:09] I do feel bad for Stern as much as like, yes, some customers get shotty machines.

[25:14] And Stern will make those machines right.

[25:18] I really have confidence they will.

[25:20] I don't know how fast they will.

[25:22] I can tell you they'll make KPG whole again faster than any other manufacturer even got

[25:29] a single game out.

[25:31] But again, I think KPG is at the end of the line.

[25:34] I think he's at the end of the line.

[25:35] And I think he just needs to accept that.

[25:37] They ignored him on purpose.

[25:39] Let's be honest.

[25:40] They ignored him on purpose.

[25:41] And he knows why.

[25:42] And he almost should have got ignored for what he, his constant tirade.

[25:47] But the constant moaning and groaning about Stern.

[25:52] You have to wonder guys, why, why do people do it?

[25:56] Like Stern keeps making you pinball machines.

[26:00] Stern keeps delivering the premium themes of pinball to you.

[26:05] There is nobody out there.

[26:07] There is nobody out there that would rather, who is an alien fan.

[26:12] That can't tell me.

[26:14] You wouldn't rather have had Stern pinball handle aliens 30th anniversary game with like

[26:22] Zombietti on the art package and Stern delivered it with like imagine if it was a new Gomez

[26:34] or with, imagine if Alien had Lyman on code.

[26:38] And the whole cabinet was hand drawn with the great Geiger artwork.

[26:43] And you wouldn't want that.

[26:45] You wouldn't want that.

[26:47] Really.

[26:48] You think the top would be like cheap looking beacons?

[26:50] Stern would have made a nice beautiful alien pinball machine.

[26:53] And again, they turned a corner.

[26:55] They turned a corner.

[26:57] Yes, they've had some issues.

[26:59] But you can't tell me that Stern deserves just the level of vitriol that they get.

[27:05] And imagine pinball without Stern.

[27:09] Just do it.

[27:10] And see what would it be like?

[27:11] First of all, there would be nobody else.

[27:13] There would be no other companies.

[27:15] It would have collapsed.

[27:17] It would absolutely have collapsed.

[27:20] All pin side would have been was people collecting old games.

[27:25] It would have been, many of them would have been probably $17,000.

[27:29] But now if there never were going to be new pinball machines, we would have stopped there.

[27:34] There would be no Jersey Jack pinball if it wasn't for Stern.

[27:37] It would have all stopped.

[27:40] So it's also embarrassing.

[27:43] It is absolutely embarrassing that the world's number one pinball forum doesn't get any

[27:51] participation from the world's number one pinball company.

[27:56] You know what?

[27:57] It also doesn't get participation from the number two largest pinball company in the world.

[28:04] Okay?

[28:05] It doesn't really get much participation from anybody other than Andrew Highway constantly

[28:12] going on and giving you promises that he misses time and time again and is yet forgiven

[28:18] time and time again.

[28:21] You get Andrew.

[28:22] Spooky goes on every once in a while, but not that much.

[28:26] Because what's the point?

[28:28] Charlie got like just probably tired of everyone moaning and groaning about his machines.

[28:35] Because it doesn't do any good.

[28:40] You know, if people weren't bitching about stuff on pinsod, I really wonder what they'd

[28:44] be doing.

[28:45] They might actually be playing their pinball machines.

[28:48] You know, this podcast, I'll say it, it's a little bit of a catch-22 for me because

[28:52] this podcast exists because of all that bitching, because of all that moaning, because of all

[28:57] that groaning.

[28:58] I parachute it into the pinball hobby and into the forum about three years ago.

[29:05] And I didn't create pinball drama.

[29:08] I didn't create pinside drama.

[29:11] I was banned from pinside for speaking my mind at times.

[29:16] No worse than anyone right now on that site.

[29:20] I never, I never went absolutely batshit crazy like KPG and just wouldn't stop over and

[29:28] over again with all threads about this and about that.

[29:31] And the threads were never about me.

[29:34] And that's always makes people annoyed.

[29:35] You're like, you'll win and look at canadas all threads if they still have them up there.

[29:39] But I brought issues to people attention like a broken ramp on a hobbit and that's what

[29:44] did it.

[29:45] I wouldn't let certain things go.

[29:47] But I also wouldn't let people like KPG and the constant, these guys are the trolls.

[29:55] These are the guys that are obsessed that need the constant attention on pinside.

[29:59] And that is what has driven Jack away, stern away.

[30:03] Look and you, yes, you could argue that these people kept those individuals honest and

[30:08] that's why they don't want to participate on pinside.

[30:12] But the reality is, pinside is like maybe, maybe 5 to 10% of pinball, hobbyist and collectors

[30:22] are actually active on pinside.

[30:25] I would say far more of the collector basis on pinside.

[30:30] I don't think a lot of people who just enjoy pinball and are in pinball leagues around

[30:35] America get that much out of pinside.

[30:38] I really don't.

[30:41] But I think it's time to just like close down that thread.

[30:45] Why the pinside moderation team allows certain individuals to sort of take over the site

[30:54] and constantly regurgitate the same complaints over and over is bullshit.

[31:01] And I want to just end with this point.

[31:03] And this is the problem.

[31:06] When I went on with duplicate account and shared actual information I had about certain

[31:14] manufacturer, okay, highway pinball, information was deleted, everything was erased.

[31:22] I would even if it wasn't me, you would have kicked people out of the threads if they

[31:26] shared the information, even if it was from a valid source.

[31:30] And that just goes to show the state of pinside.

[31:34] It's like they're just protecting certain companies and yet they let Stern get destroyed

[31:41] time and time again and it's completely biased and it's why Robin only has the bottom

[31:49] of the bottom companies on his forum.

[31:51] He doesn't have participation from the real movers and shakers.

[31:56] And I'll say it because he allowed too many people to attack and drive those companies

[32:03] off the site.

[32:04] And this is what we're left with.

[32:06] We're left with this like cesspool of 20 very vocal individuals who just braid each

[32:14] other.

[32:15] I mean go into the KPG thread and read the way these people talk about each other.

[32:21] It's like KPG and Iceman are ready to just like castrate each other and it's like five

[32:27] pages of arguing.

[32:30] And then at the end it's always like yeah we'll have beers at TPS.

[32:32] It's like really, really.

[32:36] Grown man cannot just relax, cannot just talk to each other in a civil manner.

[32:45] But without it, you know, part of me is like well without it there'd be nothing interesting

[32:49] to read on that site.

[32:51] There wasn't for the characters and the personalities that constantly yell at each other on a daily

[32:58] basis.

[32:59] All right, let's switch gears real quick to another announcement.

[33:02] It seems to be like the week of announcements.

[33:05] I don't even think this one is official.

[33:08] We talked a little bit about Rick at PPS announcing on a forum attack from Mars Remake is the

[33:15] next title.

[33:18] The discussion is not about the game, right?

[33:21] Because we know what the game is.

[33:22] We've had the game for 20 what years.

[33:25] So the discussion is really around how much will it cost?

[33:30] And that's the big discussion.

[33:32] And some people like to think that this game is going to come in around 6,500 bucks and

[33:38] it's going to be a steal and it's going to be exactly what the industry needs right now.

[33:44] I think those individuals are going to be sorely disappointed.

[33:49] I can't imagine this game coming in that cheap.

[33:53] There's no way.

[33:55] There's no way.

[33:57] Some people are saying it's going to be closer to like 7,600 8,000 closer to MMR.

[34:03] I think that is probably where this game is going to net out.

[34:07] I've said it before.

[34:09] I don't think the game is going to sell well or be in demand around 8,000 dollars because

[34:15] everyone knows you can go get an attack from Mars right now within that 6,500 price range.

[34:27] And you can even get them for cheaper if they're not in the best condition.

[34:31] So is this going to be a game that really takes off?

[34:35] I've said it before.

[34:36] I think the past is the past.

[34:38] I think there are certain titles that if they were remain, people would be all over.

[34:43] An attack from Mars is a great game, but it's not hard to get.

[34:47] It's not.

[34:48] So it really begs the question, why remake something that's not difficult to get that

[34:55] you can get for cheaper in good condition than you'll probably charge.

[35:00] It made sense to get MMR remade because of how expensive those games were.

[35:05] I still think it's going to be Cactus Canyon and Rick just confirmed in that awkward way

[35:11] on that form that it was attacked from Mars just to throw people off the trail.

[35:15] And Cactus Canyon makes much more sense if you're going to try and get a game at that

[35:20] 8,000 price point because those games in good condition do go from more than that.

[35:26] And then if you added in the continued software with the new colored dots, I think that

[35:33] could be a very, very interesting proposition.

[35:37] But again, I've said it and I'll say it one more time.

[35:39] I'm beating the dead horse on these things.

[35:41] The future of Pimball is far more exciting than looking back.

[35:46] Now there are amazing titles from the Williams error, from the Valley Williams error.

[35:51] I think the quality of those games is still better than what we're getting now, for sure

[35:54] better than what we're getting now.

[35:57] And I own one.

[35:59] I've passed on owning a Ghostbusters.

[36:01] I passed on owning a Batman and I own a Totten because I still think there's more magic

[36:08] and there's more quality in those old Williams games.

[36:11] And when you get a good one, they're freaking bulletproof.

[36:14] They are pretty much bulletproof.

[36:18] And they're special.

[36:19] They were built by a company that I think everyone would agree.

[36:25] They were the best company that ever built Pimball machines.

[36:30] They haven't been beat yet.

[36:32] They are the bar.

[36:33] They are the bar.

[36:35] Jersey Jack is trying to reach that bar.

[36:37] Dutch Pimball is trying to reach that bar.

[36:39] I don't think anyone has built a game that is better than the best of Williams yet.

[36:44] I don't.

[36:45] And that's what everyone's aiming for.

[36:48] So you can get good games from the past.

[36:52] And they're special when you get a good game from the past and it's been either maintained

[36:55] or it's been restored.

[36:57] There's something about getting that.

[36:59] But remaking the old games in 2017, I don't think there's that much interest.

[37:06] I don't think you're going to find people that are excited to do it.

[37:11] With games like Star Wars coming out, rumored Toy Story, Pulp Fiction, Iron Maiden, all

[37:17] these things are happening.

[37:19] All these things are happening.

[37:20] So let's see what happens at T-PF.

[37:24] So T-PF is going to be the big show.

[37:26] I feel like going to Expo is such a let down.

[37:28] I should have just saved all my money and gotten to T-PF.

[37:32] But we'll know soon enough.

[37:33] T-PF is just a few months away and I'm still debating whether or not I go.

[37:37] I'm on the fence.

[37:39] I'm on the fence.

[37:40] All right.

[37:41] Let's see.

[37:42] Is there anything else I'm missing?

[37:44] Let me read some listener feedback to you guys.

[37:48] Want to give a shout out to listener of the show Keith Stevens.

[37:53] Keith, thank you for listening to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[37:58] Keith wrote, he wrote, if you want interaction, stop with the whole, I'm out, I'm done, I'm

[38:04] taking a break and reassess things.

[38:07] It's annoying and screams you're looking for attention.

[38:10] You put on a good podcast, you're entertaining and for the most part you have a good take

[38:14] on the hobby.

[38:16] Stop with the teenage girl dramatics and your viewership and conversely interaction

[38:21] will increase exponentially.

[38:23] All right.

[38:24] Well, and I told Keith I'm like, look, there are going to be times when I get fed up and

[38:28] this whole thing might just take over my life too much and I'm not doing it to be dramatic.

[38:34] I'm not doing it for attention.

[38:36] I'm just doing it because I have a life that's so much more important to me than pinball.

[38:44] I know a lot of people think I'm some crazy sociopath who's not capable of holding a job

[38:50] that should be on medication.

[38:51] All the terrible things that were said about me on cloth and on pinside by certain individuals

[38:58] couldn't be further from the truth.

[39:00] I live a pretty normal life.

[39:01] I have a girlfriend who I love.

[39:03] I have a bulldog that I love.

[39:04] I have things that I like to do and I have a job that I love.

[39:09] I have responsibilities there that allow me the financial ability to buy pinball and also

[39:18] provide me the time to do stuff like this podcast.

[39:21] It's not easy.

[39:22] It's not easy.

[39:23] The only reason why you get so many canadas pinball podcasts weekly is I don't have kids.

[39:30] I don't have kids.

[39:31] I have an awesome job where I'm sort of a little bit.

[39:37] I have my own team there and we're awesome.

[39:39] We kick ass but we kind of aren't micromanaged and don't have the craziest hours because we're

[39:45] really efficient and effective.

[39:50] I did notice when I stopped reading pinside when I stopped doing the podcast, I focused

[39:56] so much more on those things.

[39:59] I read more.

[40:01] I wasn't as stressed out and I wasn't as anxious because I didn't give a shit like what

[40:05] happens with these fucking pinball companies every day.

[40:08] The conversations that I have about these topics are they can wear you down.

[40:14] I'm trying to approach it this time.

[40:16] A little bit more positive.

[40:17] Step back a little bit.

[40:18] Put things a little bit more in perspective.

[40:20] It doesn't mean I'm going to go weak.

[40:22] It doesn't mean I'm not going to call companies out every now and then.

[40:26] I let the whole highway fast go get the best of me.

[40:31] I got too involved on a personal level with that whole scene and I just had to get out

[40:38] of it and it was good.

[40:40] Keith goes on to say I'm tired of hearing about any credence being given to American pinball.

[40:49] I don't give a shit what they are doing until they have at minimum a working playing

[40:53] prototype.

[40:54] This is new and void of J-pop.

[40:57] That is new and void of J-pop's influence.

[40:59] Yeah, look, American pinball has, I think they've done a good job in the following

[41:05] sense.

[41:06] They've done a good job in terms of going away.

[41:10] They made a few announcements about magic girl and how they were sort of ironing out some

[41:15] of the legal issues.

[41:17] They haven't constantly been talking to us and hyping us around Houdini.

[41:23] They've shared some new hires with us.

[41:25] But I think this company's best marketing approach is the one they're taking, which is

[41:29] silence.

[41:30] Just be quiet.

[41:31] Get it done.

[41:32] Get the magic girls out.

[41:34] Talk about that.

[41:35] That starts chapter 2 for them, which is Houdini.

[41:38] They're going to bring it to T-P-F.

[41:40] It's going to be a journey to get Houdini out.

[41:42] It's not going to just happen.

[41:44] I don't think it's going to happen as fast as they predict it when they said nine months.

[41:47] I don't think anyone really will hold them to it.

[41:49] They haven't taken anyone's money yet.

[41:52] No one's going to really hold them to the fire until that happens.

[41:57] I don't think we should give them slack until they actually deliver on the first of the

[42:04] two promises they guaranteed.

[42:07] Keith goes on to say, as a whole, I'm sick of all the secondary manufacturers and their

[42:13] carrot and sticker approach to how they conduct their business.

[42:17] It's laughable when any one of them throws out a deadline date.

[42:23] I usually triple that duration and I'm still usually off by 100%.

[42:28] It's really that bad.

[42:30] I get it.

[42:31] Making pinball is hard.

[42:33] Just stop promising shit.

[42:35] You can't live up to.

[42:38] Yeah.

[42:39] Keith, we talked about that a lot on this podcast.

[42:41] I don't know why they do it.

[42:43] I really don't.

[42:44] I think the only incentive for these companies to put these dates out there is they're starving

[42:49] for money.

[42:51] If they don't get money soon, they're going to go under.

[42:55] If alien pinball doesn't ship in the next couple months, the company could go under.

[42:59] If Dutch pinball can't ramp up production of the Big Lebowski quicker, they're going

[43:03] to go under.

[43:05] We know this to be true.

[43:07] There's no other industry, guys, where companies that have high overhead that are making

[43:13] highly complex expensive products can last unless they're constantly shipping games.

[43:20] So, Keith goes on to say, I have a hard time believing these guys are that inept at forecasting

[43:28] things and putting in a buffer on top of that.

[43:31] I'm perplexed.

[43:32] I just keep thinking about Dutch.

[43:34] Go back to those Dutch threads.

[43:36] After all the J-pop and Kevin Krap people started making excuses, where Dutch would be

[43:40] different and that completed games would be flying off the assembly line.

[43:45] The excuses range from they are contracting out the assembly to they have a state of the

[43:50] art factory to see the video of this robot making wire forms.

[43:55] Have you seen the factory pictures?

[43:58] It's like four guys and a screwdriver.

[44:00] I'm exaggerating but you get my point.

[44:02] Yes, I've seen many pictures of the Dutch factory.

[44:05] Keith, in fact, I remember seeing photos where it just looked like there was like one guy

[44:10] sitting at a lunch table with just empty cabinets in the background.

[44:14] It's hard.

[44:15] It's hard.

[44:16] There's only two factories.

[44:19] Whenever I look inside them, I feel like something is happening and that is spooky.

[44:25] There's always activity.

[44:27] There's always life.

[44:28] There's stuff going on.

[44:29] There's excitement.

[44:30] There's enthusiasm in the employees and stern.

[44:33] Which whenever I see sterns factory, I'm like, man, no one else has anything close to

[44:39] this.

[44:40] Not even close.

[44:41] That is why whenever anyone says they're competing with stern and wants to take a chunk

[44:46] of stern's pie and then they show us their factory, you know, and Andrews got like four

[44:51] guys wearing winter coats because there's probably no heat on in his factory.

[44:56] Being together, alien.

[44:57] It's like, good luck.

[45:00] Good luck.

[45:01] All right.

[45:02] So, he closes with, in short, good podcast, stopping a drama queen and enough with all the

[45:11] mis-manufacturers' self-imposed timelines.

[45:13] So Keith, thank you for being a listener of the show.

[45:17] If any of you else out there wants to write in and talk to Canada and give me some feedback

[45:23] on any of the topics we discuss in this podcast, I implore you to talk to Canada and give me some

[45:25] to implore you.

[45:26] I would love to get some, I would love someone who's in on alien to come on the show and

[45:32] explain to me what they see that I don't, like, why they have faith where I don't.

[45:38] I would love someone to come on.

[45:40] I would love someone to come on the show and talk about why you think attack from Mars

[45:44] remake is going to be successful.

[45:46] Do you think it will?

[45:48] Hit me up.

[45:49] Come on the show.

[45:50] All right.

[45:51] I would love, I would love for anyone out there who thinks stern is.

[45:55] I would love for anyone out there who thinks stern is a bunch of cheap bastards.

[45:59] That thinks stern doesn't care to come on the show and share your opinions.

[46:03] It's really painless coming on this show.

[46:06] You can hear from the interviews.

[46:07] It's just like having a phone call with a friend of yours who's into pinball.

[46:11] It's that easy.

[46:12] It is that easy.

[46:14] The more guests we have on, the less you have to hear me just go on my solo rants.

[46:20] We're going to have another listener of the show Pete's going to be joining me soon.

[46:25] In the next week or so, I'm also looking to get Zambia Deon.

[46:29] We talked today.

[46:30] He's coming on shortly.

[46:31] I got to reach out to George Gomez.

[46:33] I reached out to Mike from Home Pin.

[46:35] A lot of good interviews coming up.

[46:37] That was episode 47.

[46:39] Not episode 47.

[46:41] That was 47 minutes of episode.

[46:43] I think 78 of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[46:46] Sorry.

[46:47] It's a little late at night.

[46:48] That a long day at work.

[46:49] Someone's a little bit slower tempo.

[46:52] But we're going to end this by saying to all the people out there making pinball machines,

[46:57] to all the manufacturers.

[46:59] I'm going to give you the greatest advice ever.

[47:03] Don't ever give a release date until your game is done and inside a box.

[47:09] Don't.

[47:10] Don't bring your game to a show unless your game is done.

[47:18] It's done.

[47:19] You need money.

[47:20] If you need money to make your machine, if you need money for your company to survive,

[47:26] don't ask the consumers who love pinball to finance your company.

[47:31] Go to a venture capitalist.

[47:34] Go to investors.

[47:35] Show them your prototype.

[47:38] Explain to them how much money a pinball machine can make and get their money.

[47:42] Do it the right way.

[47:45] Alright, we will see if alien ships in the next few weeks.

[47:48] I don't think you're going to see any aliens in customer hands in January.

[47:55] I hope I'm wrong.

[47:57] But I think I'm right.

[47:58] And I also don't think we're going to see P3 in three months.

[48:02] I hope I'm wrong.

[48:04] But I'm probably going to be right.

[48:06] Not because I'm going to sabotage any of these efforts, but because history has shown,

[48:12] whenever a manufacturer gives a date, it's almost 99% sure they will never hit that

[48:18] date.

[48:18] Have a good night ladies and gentlemen.

[48:21] Hug your loved ones.

[48:22] Take care of yourselves.

[48:24] Remember, it's only pinball.

[48:27] Stop treating each other like you hate each other on pinside.

[48:30] Hug it out.

[48:32] Have some whiskey.

[48:33] Get a bulldog and relax.

[48:35] We'll talk to you soon.
