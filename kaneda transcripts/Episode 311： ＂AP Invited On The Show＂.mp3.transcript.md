[00:00] I still believe in your eyes.

[00:05] I'm just don't care what you've done in your mind.

[00:18] Welcome to episode 311 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast with a midnight madness mode.

[00:26] Hey, I got someone to send me a review of the monsters. Let's air it for you right now.

[00:33] Hey, Chris, Cam here into coma, Washington. I've had the chance to play a brand new monster.

[00:39] It's about 20 times at my local barcade. Here's what I really like about it.

[00:46] And here's what I don't like about it. The skill shot is just like guardians,

[00:52] only somehow even more boring. The same two ramps as guardians.

[00:58] Uninspiring bash toy. The right out lane is a complete bear.

[01:04] There is just nothing that jumps out as new and exciting to me for a Stern standard size pin.

[01:11] And I like Stern games. So what's an example of a recent Stern that stands out as new and exciting?

[01:17] Iron Maiden. Love that game. Hate the theme.

[01:21] Yes, look, the art by francey on monsters is stunning. But I watch monsters growing up and always felt that I wasn't really sure why I was actually watching it because it wasn't that funny.

[01:32] I have the same feeling playing the pin. It's decent fun for a few games, but then it's just familiar and I move on to another game.

[01:41] Also, the classic music from the show is fine for a little while, but then I can't stand to keep listening to it.

[01:48] I'd actually rather go subject myself to more maiden.

[01:52] Hey, I'm still looking to get my first pin or two from my house. While there are a lot of machines I like to play a few times in a session at the barcade,

[02:01] there's just about nothing that I can find myself playing over and over again at home.

[02:06] I'm interested to see what else comes out this year. If nothing else grabs me, I can actually see myself taking your suggestion to get a Batman premium as I like the theme and it's fun to play.

[02:17] I especially like that moving crane. It adds a dynamic dimension to the shots as the game is played.

[02:23] Hey, nice job on the cast even during the slow news cycle. I like your smart well researched straight up, no filter, no holds bar opinions. It's why I listen. Cam out.

[02:37] All right, Cam. Well, thank you for the review on the monsters. I actually don't play these until I record my show, so I'm listening to it for the first time as you are.

[02:46] So I didn't know if you liked or didn't like the monsters. So interesting not seeing that much originality. I actually was laughing as Cam was describing the monsters as a theme because I also remember when I was a kid sitting down and watching the show and enjoying the quirkiness of it, but also not really finding it that funny.

[03:08] It was just more of like a strange spectacle kind of show and I did prefer Batman of the Adam West Batman show much more than I did the monsters.

[03:19] So what what does this mean? So Cam, here's my thing. Here's my take. I'm glad that you played the game in a barcade environment played at 20 times and realized it's not the game for you.

[03:29] In terms of a game that you should own because you're in the market for one, I do think Batman is great, but I would wait. I would just wait to see what the next six to eight months bring out in the pinball world.

[03:43] And the reason I would wait is Batman's not going anywhere. You're going to be able to find a Batman premium new inbox for a long time. Distributors have them. I know there's rumors. Stern is going to stop making Batman any day now. I don't buy that.

[03:58] I think they're going to make it now that the code is really good. I do think you're going to start to see Batman be put on the list. The short list of great games that Stern makes that are worth owning.

[04:10] So I would wait, but how can you not just wait to see what deep route what Jersey Jack has coming out. And if there's any other mystery pins that might be coming out as well.

[04:20] But thank you for that review. For those of you out there who listen to the show, if you ever want to send me an audio file like that, I will play it. I think it's great to hear from the people who enjoy this podcast. So what I want to talk about on this episode of Can you just pinball podcast. So there just seems to be a lot of speculation happening in the world of Jersey Jack.

[04:41] And I want to start there because as we're moving closer to TPS, I think the rumor mill and the speculation mill is running on overdrive when it comes to Jersey Jack pinball. Now Jack's been doing some interviews and more information is coming to light that I wanted to discuss on this episode. And one of them that's really interesting that I'm not sure I believe. And I want to know what you guys think. Do you think this rumor is true.

[05:08] And I think Jack might have said this. I don't know. I don't think I've seen him specifically say this. The thing with Jack is this though he talks a lot and he runs his mouth to distributors and to other people. So that's where I think these rumors come from the rumors this that pirates of the Caribbean production will stop in March. That that is it. They're going to make the final run of that game in March. And it's sort of like by it now or there are no more questions.

[05:38] I'm not going to make it ever again in the future. And I want to ask you the listener. I know we can't talk in real time. But do you think that's true when I heard that. And I just kind of like that sounds really sort of like a sales tactic. We're not going to make any more of these by it now while they last. And if you look at who's talking a lot about this. It's his distributors are saying, hey, we're hearing that March is it. By the way, I've been

[06:08] got five L.E.s and two collectors additions. If you want it, get them now because they're going to be gone for good. And this sort of like pirates of the Caribbean is closing out production. So grab it now. I don't buy it. I think it's a little bit of a sleazy sales tactic. If you ask me, I'm not again. There has been confirmation on this. So it's not also not fair for me to call them doing something sleazy. That's not confirmed. But if it does come to a halt in March. That is

[06:38] interesting. It definitely clears up the line for the next game, which by the way, the next game that will go on the line at Jersey Jack Pimball is no other than Wizard of Oz. They're doing a rerun of the Wizard of Oz, a yellow brick road edition 250 of them will be made. And it's really strange. The communication around this. So it hasn't again been official.

[07:08] But I hear them. They're taking out problematic parts of the game and replacing them with more, I don't know, problem-free mechanisms. But it sounds like it's going to be another limited edition. I don't think it's going to be like Wizard of Oz pro model for cheaper. I think Jack is going to maybe make this me at $12,500 collector's edition Wizard of Oz, which would make it the third limited sort of version of the game.

[07:37] We have the Emerald City, then 1500 Ruby Red editions and now 250 yellow brick road editions for a grant and plus all the standard edition. So we all know was is the best selling game that Jack has ever made over 4,000 units sold.

[07:51] And so that is most likely going to be what we see at T.P.F. from Jersey Jack Pimball. And then I'm hearing that Willie Wonka will be next. It will be a Pat Lawler game and it will be a standard body game and it will come out sometime in early summer.

[08:12] So that is where we're at. Nothing is confirmed. Nothing is official. That is what the rumor mill is saying. I think people are sort of sad that that Pat Lawler is not doing toy story. I've said it before. I think people want Pat Lawler to do every game.

[08:31] Pat Lawler is Pat Lawler. He is one of the greatest Pimball designers of all time. If you're Jack and you have him making games, why not have him make all your titles or design them at least. I'm sure he's working with Eric though. This isn't like Eric's designing a game in a vacuum. But that does mean that Eric is most likely designing toy story.

[08:52] I wouldn't be surprised if something else happens. I would not be surprised if they flip it on all of us. I would not be surprised if it's actually toy story that's next. If toy stories, a Pat Lawler design. If toy story is a standard body game.

[09:13] I would not be surprised for a moment. I think they understand the rumors. I think they understand the speculation. I do think that it is going to be. Man, it's hard because I do think toy story should be next because the movies are coming out in June. I think it makes total sense for that to happen.

[09:36] But who knows who knows we're going to go back and forth with this one for a long time. But do you think pirates is done? This is it. This is like this game. They're just conceding that this game just did not take off after all that hype from expo 2017. If pirates is now done, I would assume that they have not even made 1000 of them.

[10:01] Do you think they made every single LE and every single collector's edition? So there were 1000 LE's and 250 collector's editions. I don't know. What are your thoughts?

[10:12] I want to read some of your emails and then I'll go back into some more news that I think there might be. So I got this. This was a subject said it's the gift that keeps on giving.

[10:27] So Mike from home pin has been permanently banned from the Aussie arcade forum. I want to read what the administrator of that forum writes. He writes just to make people aware that home pin has made threats against me and the site via email over the Thunderbirds gum tree thread, which I've deleted.

[10:52] I'm putting this up to make it clear that all home pin discussion on Aussie arcade is banned permanently. It's not worth the hassle or stress. Okay, so maybe that's not Mike being banned from Aussie arcade forum.

[11:07] Even worse, any discussion of his game is now banned by Aussie arcade forum. Wow, someone out there is actually more polarizing and controversial than me. You might could give me a run for the money in terms of being banned from the most forums out there.

[11:26] Right now I'm currently banned from Pennside. I just recently got banned from the Toyota Super Forum for making fun of the fact that it's a BMW. I've been banned from the Dodge Demon forum. I've been banned from the Honda Civic Type R forum. You know what the forum that I love the most is the Ford SVT forum. They don't ban me. They actually enjoy me being there and being my presence. So I'm also banned from Klauve. The list goes on and on and on.

[11:56] But I'm not that much of a bad guy and I'm kind of like wreck it Ralph. I go into these forums and I just sort of wreck it up a little bit. Alright, so let's talk more about stuff that you guys have sent me. I've got this email from it says original theme is a subject. It's from the Gmail count dickballs, whatever that. And it says, um, what an original theme pinball game based on the history of pinball work from the sharp stash skill shot to the denisi drop.

[12:25] The base wizard mode you got the Dwight Sullivan unfinished multi ball the Tim sexton three balls in the pants and one drink in the face pop bumpers the Jersey Jack premature up kick the sheets hit fan multi ball.

[12:42] There's tons of material for sure you got to have a hydrofoil in the attract mode a really stupid pinball machine about pinball would be fun. I love your podcast stiff upper lip yours truly dick balls. Well, dick balls. Thank you for that email. I get what you're saying is there's so much ridiculousness that happens in this hobby, whether it's the drama, whether it's the fighting on pinside, like you could have a wears odin

[13:12] like mystery scoop. There's so much stuff that only us pinball geeks know I don't think you could commercially sell such a machine, but I think it would be fun to make a one off machine. I would make it like a pinside machine and just have all the different ridiculous threads from the history of

[13:30] the pinside be different modes in the game. And and that could be pretty interesting. I think that'd be pretty funny. You could have like call out to me your favorite pinsideers. All right, let's keep going on. So I got an email from

[13:44] Let's see this is from Tim Leonard regarding your master. He says, Hey, Chris, I always figured that you wrote the material your master supposedly sent to you.

[13:53] But after your recent episode in which you read his latest message to you, I now believe that he not only is a separate person, but that I also know his real name, Donnie Downer, my God, what a seemingly never ending infuriating

[14:11] diet tribe that was so many negative opinions were stated as if they are factual that it's hard to pick where to start with a rebuttal. So I'll simply address a couple of points. Just because your master hates

[14:26] Houdini, along with you apparently that doesn't make it a terrible game, nor mean that American pinball doesn't care about their games as he also contends. There are plenty of pinheads, including me, that have many years of experience in the hobby, who value a wide variety of quality games and enjoy playing Houdini immensely. Unlike your master and you, we appreciate

[14:54] it's fantastic theme integration and understand that it's uniquely quirky animations contribute to the early 20th century theatrical magic vibe that he's exudes so well. Well Tim, let me stop you there. I mean, yeah, I mean I do think Josh Kugler's animations look like they come from the early 20th century, but I don't think that's by choice. He then goes on to say, additionally, no pinball game is perfect, nor liked by everyone.

[15:24] And Houdini is certainly no exception, but to dismiss the truly creative effort that American pinball has put into this game, not to mention the outstanding game support that they provide on pinside as well, the email and phone is doing a great disservice to them. As long as a long time fan and avid supporter of your podcast, I think you can easily find a better master as this one comes off more like a

[15:54] misguided D level pupil think positive and keep up the genuine informative and entertaining episodes, sincerely Tim Leonard, aka tuna delight on pinside. So for those of you out there, Tim is a big fan of Houdini and I appreciate that. I respect if you like a game. So I listened to what he said, and I wanted to give

[16:20] a double Josh, normal a chance to come on the show and talk about October fest and American pinball. And I've been asking him to come on the show for months, and normal was supposed to come on the show and then he just ghosted me out of nowhere. So I want to tell you something that I wrote to them. So I reached out to them, because I do think avoiding

[16:44] the Canadian Spinball podcast is not the wisest thing to do for any manufacturer where you need to get sales going. And this show, I think, has been fair on our critique of different elements of American pinball games. I've not said that October fest doesn't shoot well. The issues I've had with it are the same issues. Most of you have had, which are the art and the animations and the theme.

[17:12] And so that being said though, the best thing to happen to American pinball would be for them to come on the show and tell you why you should buy it. And I give every manufacturer the floor to do that. And so here's what I wrote to them. I said gentlemen. And this went to this went to Josh and to normal. And this was two days ago. I said gentlemen.

[17:39] I'll extend the offer again to come on the show and sell me and my listeners on October fest. Josh, you've been on before and you know that all my shows with guests are respectful and a great form for anyone to sell my audience on the game. I'll just say this.

[18:00] My show consists of 1,500 to 2,000 listeners who are 100% pinball new inbox buyers. Your target at American pinball.

[18:13] While I might not agree with the theme or some of the art decision, that's just my opinion. I would love to hear your rationale, reason and passion behind this title.

[18:25] The offer is there and believe me, it would only help not hurt Cheers Chris. And that is what I sent to American pinball. I have not heard back. And I'm not sure if they will come on the show or not.

[18:40] And I think what happens is this. And this is just something that I've noticed for a long time is certain people out there in the pinball manufacturing world.

[18:51] I think avoid the show for one reason. I think they don't want to legitimize the show. But here's here's what here's what I want to do this. I want to zoom out a little bit and think about any industry you work in.

[19:04] If there are media outlets out there that are talking to your target on a consistent basis. So I talk to you consistently. For those of you who listen to this show, I hope you feel like even though we haven't met in person, some of us have. But for most of us, we haven't met on the street.

[19:25] We haven't had a beer. We haven't had a meal. We haven't played pinball together. But I hope you feel like you know me that by now after listening to this show, we have a connection.

[19:35] And that connection happens because every week for a few hours, you let me into your head. And I'm glad that you do. And I think you understand where I'm coming from. And I think you listen to this show because part of you agrees with some of what I say. You will not agree with all of it.

[19:53] But we're all talking about the same thing. We're thinking about the same thing pinball. And this show discusses on a regular basis, the new machines coming out, whether or not we think they're good or not, whether or not we think they're marketed properly, whether or not we think they're worth owning.

[20:10] And it's hard to avoid that this show has to have some level of influence on the people who listen. And whether it's, whether it's, you know, whether it's shaping your opinion about a game, whether it's making you go in on a game, whether it's making you reconsider something, whether it's making you avoid something.

[20:31] This show, I don't know how you could listen to someone give their opinions about these pinball machines and not have those opinions start to infiltrate some of what your thoughts are on the game.

[20:42] Now look, I think you're all very smart men, hopefully some women listen and you're all capable of formulating your own opinions about the game. But when a company like American pinball is in need of sales, to avoid a show like this that it gives them an opportunity to win.

[21:00] It gives them an opportunity to tell you in their own voice why you should buy their game. I think that's a mistake. And in my industry, yeah, not all of my clients love every single media outlet that writes about them on a daily basis or a weekly basis, but they don't avoid it.

[21:18] You can't avoid and here's a crazy part. This is the number one pinball podcast. Then number one, get that got voted. And maybe it's not the number one in listeners. Maybe the other listener bases are higher. I don't know. I know that I'm the only one.

[21:34] This is the only pinball podcast that transparently shows you how many listeners we get per episode. Nobody else does that. And and so based upon the information that we all have, this show gets the most pinball new inbox buyer listeners to tune in every week.

[21:57] And so if you're Josh and you're normal, is it inconvenient that this show exists? And I heard Josh write on Pinside. I haven't really listened to Canadian in a while. And my whole thing is, well, maybe you should because every week we're talking about the new games coming out and yours is one of them. And to avoid listening to the show and what we're saying and the feedback we're giving, I think does a disservice to their ability to be able to do that.

[22:27] And I don't mean that in a harsh way. But I think the advice we give the manufacturers on this show is pretty spot on. And I don't and I and again, correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think I've ever given the free information that I give to all the manufacturers out there. I don't think I give it with malicious intent. I don't think I want to see these companies fail. But it just always blows me away at that time and time again.

[22:55] And I try to avoid it. Now look, Stern doesn't need to come on the show because they just, they just, it doesn't matter to them. Stern's not going to, they might lose a few sales here and there if I say the game is bad or whatnot, but they don't care.

[23:08] They have this hobby locked down so tightly that, you know, Lyman Sheets going on another podcast or Dwight doing a show, it doesn't matter. Your orders are in. Their LL's are sold out.

[23:20] And look, you know, if the incident that happened with Tim is going to prevent Stern people from ever coming on the show again, I don't think that's the case.

[23:29] I still have a good rapport with Stern individuals over there. I mean, George Gomez responds to me on Facebook. Look, everything that happened at that, you know, that tournament, it's bygone in terms, you know, as far as I'm concerned and I've apologized to everyone involved.

[23:46] And I would love to have Stern people on the show every once in a while. But what I won't do is I won't hold back to get those interviews.

[23:54] And I think that's probably why American pinball won't come on is if I've said something not positive about them, they just, they avoid it.

[24:02] And I know that some other podcasts were making fun of me for that. They're like, he's so negative about the other manufacturers and then he complains that they won't come on the show.

[24:10] Let me, let me clarify this for a minute. This means nothing. It doesn't matter to me that they don't come on the show. Think about who it's hurting.

[24:18] Who is getting hurt by avoiding Canadian pinball podcasts? Is it Canada? This show is going to keep on going. We're going to keep on being the normal and pinball podcast that I think has the most influence in the hobby.

[24:29] And we're going to keep doing it. And, and so who's getting hurt? You know, who's getting hurt? The boutique manufacturers who continue, who continually avoid the show and don't want to come on and talk about their product.

[24:42] You know who's smart? Who's coming on the show? Who's going to, who's going to be where you hear what's going on at Deeproot first? You'll probably hear it here because Robert has been a great sort of ally in terms of communicating with me and talking to me.

[24:56] He's not shying away from this podcast and go back and listen to what I said about Deeproot at the very beginning. I mean, I've been very skeptical and very cynical.

[25:06] But the lines of communication have always been open between me and Deeproot. And I'm not showing their company. If I was a show for Deeproot, would you, would you listen? And we don't show for anybody.

[25:17] But I'm just saying I hope American pinball reconsiderors because I think it's in their best interest to do shows like this. So Josh, normal if you're listening anytime you want will make it happen.

[25:28] Alright, so I got an email from John Robinson. He says pinball collectability thoughts. He says hi Chris on a recent show I heard you talking about Stern's zero commitment to the collector segment as an owner previous owner of ACDC Luzzi Big Bang Bar, Tron Ali and Iron Man.

[25:47] I realize that nothing is safe or sacred. If there is demand and it buck to be made Stern or Chicago gaming company will definitely do it. I do not view Ellie's as collectible. I do not purchase them so much anymore.

[26:04] Or such anymore. Almost every hobby has those very rare heavily sought after items that add an exciting dynamic.

[26:13] In most cases, rarity of those games in our hobby has been destroyed. Next up, most likely is Kingpin. I remember here in Gary Stern specifically say that Iron Man would never be built again. A couple years later, the vault business model is invented. Next victim was ACDC Luzzi.

[26:34] I got out of Big Bang Bar and Tron Ali a couple months ago before those games tank due to remake and vault. I'm happy for buyers who now have options for new classic bali Williams titles, but it comes at a cost of nothing seems that special anymore.

[26:52] The thrill of the hunt is gone when I can call my distributor and order medieval madness attack from Mars or monster bash. I enjoy the show and your commitment to frequency.

[27:03] John, well, John, thank you. And I agree. I agree. There is nothing that seems safe to collect. There is nothing that seems like a holy grail that much anymore.

[27:16] And I think as collectors and as people who just love pinball, I do think it sucks that some of those sort of rare pinball experiences are going to just be like made over and over and over again.

[27:33] And then we lose some of that specialness of those games like Kingpin, Data East King Kong. And look, a lot of those games, they never were fully completed. They were prototyped. They never went into full production.

[27:48] But there's something about going into the collectors home who has that rare game that you get a chance to play. And it's just unique and unique experience.

[28:01] See, that's the thing that I've always harped on is when I thought Magigar would be that it would be this like you had a stand in one spot on planet earth to experience Magigar.

[28:12] There would only be 20 of them in the world. And unless you were in one of those 20 locations, you could not experience what it would be like to play Magigar.

[28:23] How many pinball games? To me, that's where like the specialness lies. There aren't that many out there. And when you get a chance to hop on one, it's an experience you remember just for its uniqueness.

[28:36] It might not be the best pinball experience if you play like a Data East King Kong. But you'll remember where you were. You'll remember when you experienced it and you'll remember what the experience was.

[28:47] And when we just keep making these games in the thousands, no one's really having that unique experience. And I'll say this too, it doesn't take much sometimes to make it a little bit more unique.

[28:59] And so with Batman 66 Super Ellie, I do now have something unique in my game that only 80 other games have on the planet.

[29:12] Someone can come over and I can show you what it's like when Adam West personally calls out my name. And it's really cool.

[29:20] And I just wish whether it was the game or some unique things, some of that limited experience I think is important to maintain in this hobby.

[29:30] Alright, I got an email from Nelson. It says your master episode, he said sucked.

[29:35] Dude, I know you've gotten criticism for the master's voice episodes. So you have to decide how to convey his opinions. But by not using the voice, the episode just fell so flat.

[29:47] I honestly wasn't sure I could finish the episode. You usually hold my attention even if I'm not really enjoying an episode. But this was just the worst.

[29:57] Oh my god. Alright, so I see I can't win. I take the voice away. People get mad. I put the voice in people get mad. He said the old voice was awesome, hilarious and attention grabbing.

[30:09] Alright, so maybe I don't know. What do you think? I mean, maybe I'll go back. Maybe we'll just get rid of the master all together Chris. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what I do.

[30:19] Alright, I got an email. I said, paid rumors. Are you kidding me? This is from let's see, Canada. Seriously. Is that where we are in this hobby? What a freaking money grubber.

[30:30] It's just like certified collectible. He's trying to create a market for which they presently there presently is no demand.

[30:39] This is from Kooter. Alright, so he's talking about this week in Pimbal. He posted this this week in Pimbal is now asking for donations in which if you donate to Patreon, they will give you rumors.

[30:55] And they will let you in on more inside information in the hobby. And I'll read what what he pasted here. He wrote, I've been asking this is from Jeff at this week in Pimbal, who we're friends of on this show.

[31:06] He said, I've been asking for donations support for a while now, but I find that most people won't give without getting something in return. That is why I set up the trippers a while back.

[31:18] Here is the link to the Patreon page. Alright, so here's what he writes. So basically for $1 a month contribution, the twit perks are you help keep this week in Pimbal running and you automatically entry into the giveaway extravagant.

[31:35] Okay, so here's what I think everyone should do. I mean, I think on some level, if you enjoy this week in Pimbal and it does cost Jeff time and money to make it, I look for $12 a year.

[31:45] You can get all your Pimbal news in a concise way. You get Pimbal rumors. You get stuff that no other site is giving you. Isn't is that not worth $12 a year? I mean, I think it is. I mean, I do. I just I actually just donated a lot more than that to Jeff. Just just to say thanks because I hadn't donated before. I felt like a hypocrite. And it's like, okay, you've got you've been doing this. It's been a lot of hard work. Here you go.

[32:10] And one was a one time contribution. Alright, so then this week in Pimbal contributor, which is $5 a month, you can keep it running. You're entered into the extra avaganza. And you get pro this week in Pimbal swag once a year. Alright, now that $10 a month, you get on top of all that, you get

[32:30] swag once a year, you get swag premium swag. Okay, so for $20 a month, this is the part where I think this person is has issues with. So you get weekly-ish correspondence sharing. So rumors and speculation that is not fit for this week in Pimbal, meaning we don't have enough confidence in those reports to report them on the website.

[32:55] It's probably like everything I say on this podcast is what he's talking about. You also get rumors information speculation on what we're hearing about possible upcoming titles.

[33:04] You get rumors information speculation on what we're hearing about certain licenses and challenges with those licenses. You get rumors information and speculation on what we're hearing about release schedules for different manufacturers.

[33:15] You get early access to some articles, interviews that will appear on this week in Pimbal. You get behind the scenes happenings in the Pimbal world and at twip.

[33:25] Now for a hundred, the super limited edition, and I can't tell if all of these are serious. I mean, I don't think really Jeff expects someone to donate $1,200 a year, but for $50 a month, you get all of that.

[33:38] You get your own personalized twippy trophy. Wait, that's not fair, Jeff.

[33:43] Jeff, you can't, like we work so hard to get that twippy. You can't just buy a twippy trophy for $100. I can't go buy an Academy Award with my name on it.

[33:54] I have the biggest problem with that being on there. Again, I don't know if this is a joke or not. You also get, here are the big things for 100 a month.

[34:03] You get occasional private emails sharing exclusive information about new upcoming games and exclusives before it is made public plus other tidbits.

[34:17] We will ask you to keep this correspondence private. All right. So Jeff, I love the site. I think you guys should donate to the site.

[34:26] I think it's a lot more time and energy and money than you realize it takes Jeff to do it. I wish Jeff would just come out and say that as a marketer, I don't think you can sell people exclusive private information, which some of which might be under a non disclosure agreement with some of these companies or just in good faith.

[34:47] That's why they talk to you, Jeff. They give you this information because they trust you and they're trusting you not to sell it. The problem is in the pinball world, there is no trust.

[34:57] You tell someone an exclusive secret that you're asking them to keep private. We all know that's not going to happen. Then it's going to get out there. Then it's going to hurt the company. Then it's going to hurt this weekend pinballs. Trust between them.

[35:12] I think it would just open up Pandora's box. I appreciate what Jeff is trying to do here. I think he's a little bit behind the eight ball because again, it's just the time, energy, and money this site requires him to do and also do his day job and also balance out his relationship. Not easy.

[35:35] For those of you who think it's easy, it's not. I'm here to tell you it's not. I think we should just kind of eliminate some of these high price perks and just get back to the truth of the story, which is you might need X amount of money a year to make this viable and to make it work.

[35:56] If we don't reach our goal, we might go away. That's just the truth of any endeavor that requires time and money from people. The thing about this podcast is you're lucky. You're lucky that it doesn't cost me that much money. That being said, I'm happy for all of you who donate to my Patreon. There's not a ton of you. I think it's like 80 bucks a month. I don't even know if it's monthly. I think I get one time donations of five bucks here and there.

[36:24] I should sell t-shirts or something else to make it fun because I think you guys would love to advertise this show. I have some awesome t-shirt ideas in mind that I think you'll go crazy over. But anyway, so that's look. I mean, no one else but here's the thing. No one's forcing anyone to donate to any of this.

[36:41] I do think some of that has to be in a little bit of just that you know, you're gonna pay $100 a month and know what, like Willy Wonka is next. Here's what magic girl looks like at Deeproot. I don't think you can sort of sell that stuff and keep it secret.

[36:56] Alright, let's go on. So video game themes, Jim writes, how about an episode on what video games would make a good pinball machine? I know you have touched on this times many times, but can make a fun episode. Alright, I'm not gonna go down this long list.

[37:13] Jim, I will take that into consideration. I do think there is an ability to cross over into the theme of video games and incorporate that into pinball.

[37:23] But why can't we just make great pinball games? Do we need great video games to inspire great pinball? I don't think so. I do not think so. Alright, I'm trying to think if there's anything else that I've seen in the last few days.

[37:36] So there was like also something interesting. There was a deep root Matt, someone over at Deeproot chimed in about how great of a friend John Papaduke is and how great it is working with John and he wasn't around during all the Zidware Fiasco.

[37:52] And look, I've talked to John Papaduke for hours. Some of you have as well. I think the man is a creative genius. I think he's the worst business man on the planet. He needs a boss. He needs to be kept in line. There's a really sad photo that I have that I should share with you guys. I need to find it.

[38:16] Someone took it when they went over to Zidware to visit him to see what was going on with all their money and all their investment. And it's just a sad photo of John by himself, sort of hunched over in the chair, staring at a computer screen, strewn all over the office space or playfield, sketches, design, artwork, cabinets, all these parts and boxes.

[38:43] And he's just sort of just looking at something with this sort of dejected look on his face and you just get the sense that he was so in over his head. Now the problem with J-pop that no one should forget is when he was in over his head, he didn't come out and ask for help. He didn't go get the right people to, you know, to solve the problem.

[39:05] He lied to people and said he was able to make games two and three and he knowingly did that. He knowingly knew he could not deliver game one and he knowingly took money on game two and three.

[39:18] He also, as Tiger Law pointed out, he then went to counter see his own buyers go after them. And he sort of I think what he needs to do and he's never really done it.

[39:29] He's never come out and said, I'm sorry, this was 100% my fault. I, I'm to blame for everything. I have nothing else to say other than I'm going to spend the rest of my days in this hobby trying to correct that wrong.

[39:47] And I finally found a partner that would hopefully put me on that road. And I don't, I will not, you will not see me at shows with the mic.

[39:56] You will not see me taking credit. You will not see me talking about my vision. I will be in the shadows trying to correct the wrongs I created.

[40:06] And we haven't really seen that side of him. And we haven't seen him apologize. And I think that is the part that all new deep route members need to realize is you can't just, you don't just get universally forgiven.

[40:23] You have to understand the full context of what people have been through. But I do believe in forgiveness. And I do believe in second chances. And I do believe in redemption. And I do believe that everyone has the ability to change and become better and to become more self aware of what we're good at, what we're weak at, and where we, where we need help.

[40:47] I mean, I guess the word for that is empathy. And we all should have some of it. But you don't deserve it until you say, you're sorry. And you need help. And I think John just needs to do that. And I think people will move on. And I think it would actually lift a lot of weight off of people's shoulders that are out there.

[41:05] And erase the pain of the money people lost in the faith they lost in him. But it starts to get us on that that road to redemption. Okay.

[41:15] Alright, anything else going on? There's a really cool unboxing video of an old data east Jurassic Park that you have to go watch if you haven't watched that already. And that's it. Saturday morning, I'm going to go watch the dogs at the Westminster dog show. Today's the best day. It's the meat and greet with the dogs themselves. I hope there is an amazing bowl dog there that I can just be like, who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Okay. Everyone have a great Saturday. We'll talk to you soon. Enjoy your pinball machines. And we'll be back with more.

[41:45] episodes of Canada's pinball podcast next week. See you later.
