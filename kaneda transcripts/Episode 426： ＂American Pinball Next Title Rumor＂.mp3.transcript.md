[00:00] Do you want to wait until March to find out what American pinballs next game is?

[00:06] Or do you want to listen to this episode of Canadian pinball podcast in which I have a very, very strong rumor about what their next title is?

[00:15] You don't become the number one pinball podcast two years in a row by keeping these rumors secret.

[00:21] And we ain't taking no hiatus in January now. This show goes on right now.

[00:30] Oh, man, oh, man, we drain so long. Anybody ever wonder when they were seen thunder?

[00:36] Just remember when you come to show us up.

[00:39] Oh, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit.

[00:43] Oh, welcome to a Saturday night edition of Canadian pinball podcast. I'm your host, Canada.

[00:50] I feel the energy tonight because we're going to drop a rumor out into the pinball world about what the next American pinball theme is going to be.

[01:02] And I'm going to say it, it's a rumor. Now you take it for what it's worth. It might be right. It might be wrong.

[01:09] But here's how we'll know if this is accurate or not. They will come out and either tell us it's right or wrong.

[01:16] Okay. Now before we get to that, before we get to that, I was just thinking how badly does Deeproot probably wish that they had got Rick and Morty over Raza.

[01:28] Look at their different reaction just from theme alone. Rick and Morty versus Raza, Raza with a game did not generate nearly as much excitement as Rick and Morty.

[01:42] And we've said it so many times on this podcast theme theme theme is everything. How are you ever going to warm up to retro atomic zombie adventure land as much as you do to a show like Rick and Morty that people freaking love.

[01:58] Now I've watched two to three episodes of it and it is funny. I'm going to keep going because people say it gets better with each season.

[02:06] I'm not, I'm not going to draw a final conclusion now. But I did hear from Chuck and he said, if you are in the fan club, you will get a chance to buy it before everyone else.

[02:18] You'll get a two week head start on ordering your Rick and Morty Pimball machine from Scott Denise and spooky Pimball. And that that thread continues continues to keep blowing up with excitement.

[02:33] Now the only thing left, the only thing left is actually the most important thing we have to see the freaking game.

[02:40] But Chuck was in there yesterday and he was talking like they left nothing out of this machine. So what does that mean? They left nothing out of it.

[02:48] So he's hyping it. I mean he is hyping this machine. So let's just, let's just say that expectations are now through the roof.

[02:56] So I hope they deliver on what those expectations are. But I'm excited. I know you're excited. All right.

[03:03] So why are you listening to this episode of Canatus Pimball podcast? Should we do a market trend segment? No, we're not going to do that.

[03:09] We're not going to do that. Are we going to take off in January right when voting starts for the twip is we're not going to do that either.

[03:15] We're going to keep going with Canatus Pimball podcast. So here's the deal. I'll make this a short and sweet episode because I just want to drop for you what I think.

[03:25] Is the next theme for American Pimball. Now before I tell you what it is, here is what I know so far. I know they are developing two games right now.

[03:36] One of them is a license theme game. One of them is not. Okay. And which everyone is done first is the one they are going to bring to market and reveal at Texas Pimball festival.

[03:52] Now I'm here to tell you that it's not one of those four titles, Valkyrie, Robin Hood. What is it? Sherlock Holmes and poker run. Remember I went all off on poker run and how stupid that would be.

[04:07] They did give us a hint. Remember a few months ago. They said we're working on our next title and they showed a pair of car keys. All right. That was a hint. That was a hint.

[04:18] So here is what I am hearing is the next title from American Pimball. It's a license theme that is based on one of the most successful toy franchises of all time.

[04:33] They've sold six billion of these toys over the years and it just turned 50 years old last year. Can you guess what it is yet? American Pimball's next theme I am hearing is Hot Wheels. Okay. Let that sink in. Hot Wheels.

[04:54] The little toys with the orange ramps and the loop deloups and the fast tracks and the jumps. Now let's let's talk about this for a minute as if it's going to happen.

[05:06] Because I don't know for sure. But what do we feel about Hot Wheels being the next theme from American Pimball. All right. So let's let's talk that this could be the first Pimball machine ever in which we have a loop deloup. Okay.

[05:22] I can just see it now an orange ramp with a loop deloup. I can also see the ball doing jumps. You know, you just Google image like Hot Wheels tracks and there's all these fun different ways. You know, the ball can jump can loop can like go around corners like we're talking speed.

[05:39] We're talking cornering. We're talking jumping. We're talking loop deloup. So do we think that this is a good theme for Pimball. All right.

[05:48] And I'm here to tell you like I don't know I don't know like I know that Hot Wheels is really popular. But the big question always remains will the fan base of Hot Wheels, which is huge. Don't get me wrong. People still collect Hot Wheels.

[06:06] Kids still play with Hot Wheels. Adults still buy Hot Wheels toys. Will that translate over into the Pimball buying marketplace.

[06:17] Because here's the thing that I think is the main issue. If you want to play with Hot Wheels, you can play with Hot Wheels and a Hot Wheels only cost a few dollars.

[06:27] And a Hot Wheels track usually costs like 20 to 30 dollars, maybe 50 bucks at most. So will the fan base, who's into collecting Hot Wheels, like buy a 7 to 8000 dollar Pimball machine that's based on the property they love.

[06:47] And do people who love Pimball do they love Hot Wheels. Now when we've done your favorite themes and when I've seen people write their favorite themes like favorite five themes they would love to see your 10 themes.

[07:03] I've never ever ever ever ever see anyone put on their list of dream themes Hot Wheels. So it just once again it begs the question who is doing the market research over at American Pimball if this is in fact accurate.

[07:28] Now here's the hard part is I am sure that you can make a crazy cool Hot Wheels world under glass come to life via Pimball.

[07:41] I think you can do that and I think you can make a fun Pimball game. But it's not about fun. See when I hear Hot Wheels Pimball I feel like it's the kind of cool thing I would probably walk up to on location and put a few quarters in sure.

[07:57] It just feels like it's that kind of thing. Do you want to own it? And we are now in a Pimball landscape with so many titles that it can't just be something that people want to play and have fun with.

[08:12] It needs to be something and a theme that people want to own. Like people are doing back flips for Rick and Morty because they really want to own it because they can see how it would translate perfectly into Pimball.

[08:26] I'm just not sure Hot Wheels will get you that. And also by the time this game comes out if it even if it even is Hot Wheels by the time it comes out we're going to have Rick and Morty we're going to have stranger things.

[08:40] We're going to have probably teenage mutant Ninja Turtles right around the corner. We're going to have God knows what else guns and roses. What else are we going to have Willy Wonka we're going to have you know all these games available we're going to have probably cactus canyon remake we're going to have royal editions of medieval madness we're going to have maybe Jerry's P3 game that's going to save the universe comes out you know what I'm saying there's just so many themes coming out and it's not just about you know making the best American Pimball game to date.

[09:09] It's about making a game that can compete with the other titles available. And so I'm just curious what your thoughts are if American Pimball's next title is Hot Wheels do you think that that can be a successful game for them.

[09:27] Now you're hearing it here first I'm Canadian Pimball podcast this is what I'm hearing this is what I'm hearing from a few reliable sources that say they heard this from a distributor that American Pimball is working on a hot wheels game.

[09:39] It might be wrong if this rumor is wrong I will happily correct with in a future podcast if American Pimball wants to correct me or not they're not going to confirm it if I asked them so that it's pointless for me to ask them right now.

[09:55] Okay all right because you know this is just what we do we hear something we put it out there for discussion if it is not hot wheels they can easily Josh is on

[10:07] Pinside they can easily go on there and say it's not hot wheels it's not hard to do all right so what else is going on I mean that's it that's it I just wanted to tell you what I heard is the next game from American Pimball.

[10:20] And it's going to be an exciting December we have two titles coming out one from spooky and one from Stern Pimball can't wait to see what those games look like.

[10:30] It's a long ways away Texas Pimball festival so you know the lesson is this don't don't tell anybody what your next game is it's it's amazing to me how many factors let other people in on what they're working on.

[10:49] I mean no one knew that Scott Denise he was working on Rick and Morty nobody knew that nobody was talking about it being Scott Denise's next game we saw a few rumors about Rick and Morty being licensed as a Pimball game but nobody knew if it was Stern or if it was spooky if it was C.G.C.

[11:05] No one knew they kept it secret so I mean I'm pardon me hopes that this is wrong pardon me hopes not that it's wrong because I think it's it's a bad theme for Pimball although I do think it is a questionable theme for Pimball but I just hope I'm wrong because I hope that they still have secrets left as a manufacturer you have to keep your next titles as secretive as possible you have to you can't let stuff out.

[11:34] Early because if it lands on my desk and it lands in my inbox and I'm going to I'm just going to say it I don't really care I'm going to say it I'm going to tell you what I'm hearing and let you guys discuss it and like I said it's really easy for a manufacturer to shut down rumors immediately all right everyone have a great Saturday night this has been episode 426 of Canadian Pimball podcast so you don't have to listen to a show for like an hour and a half to get some news and some rumors going and some
