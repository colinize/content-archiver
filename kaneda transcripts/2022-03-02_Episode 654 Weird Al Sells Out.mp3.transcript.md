[00:00] We've been spending most our lives, Living in an Amish paradise,

[00:05] A Trinbiter, one-sport wife, Living in an Amish paradise,

[00:11] Well, he did it!

[00:17] The crazy SOB did it!

[00:20] Jerry Stelenberg successfully sold 227 limited edition versions of Weird Owls Museum of Hilarity.

[00:31] I keep having to get the name right.

[00:33] So I want to just say this, first and foremost, congratulations to Jerry and team over at Multimorphic.

[00:40] I mean, this man has brought this platform around for like 8 years and yesterday he had

[00:48] his greatest sales day ever.

[00:51] In one day, he moved more platforms and more games than he's done in the last 8 years.

[00:58] So I do want to congratulate him on a very successful day.

[01:02] Now we also have to look at it in a little bit of context, people.

[01:07] You know, don't forget that Stern makes more games than this in 3 days.

[01:12] In 3 days, Stern makes more games than Multimorphic has sold in like 8 years, but this company's

[01:19] not trying to be Stern.

[01:21] And what Jerry has always needed to do, he always needed to get a user base up and he

[01:28] needs to get hundreds of P3s into homes across the world because then his platform starts

[01:37] to make more sense.

[01:39] It makes more sense for developers to start to make kits for the platform if they know

[01:45] their kit can be sold to hundreds of people, right?

[01:49] It's not going to work if you only have 50 games sold.

[01:52] So it is really good news for them.

[01:54] It is great momentum for them to get these games sold.

[01:59] Now was I surprised that a licensed theme game, even though it was weird out and it's

[02:04] not my dream theme and you know my reaction to weird out was like, what weird out?

[02:09] But weird out has sold 20 million albums.

[02:12] And as I've learned over the past couple of weeks, there are many of you in the pinball

[02:17] world that consider weird out to be a dream theme.

[02:21] And so moving 227 weird out games all of a sudden doesn't really seem like it's that

[02:29] hard to do, right?

[02:30] When you just think about it, right?

[02:31] This is twice as many games as Ultraman.

[02:34] I mean, you gotta start looking at this stuff in context.

[02:38] I would argue that weird out has more crossover appeal in pinball than even Rob Zombie, which

[02:44] only 300 Rob Zombies were made.

[02:48] And in a world in which there are now 1000 Ellie's of everything, all of a sudden being

[02:55] part of a little club of 227 people starts to feel like a really appealing thing, especially

[03:03] in pinball now, right?

[03:04] I've said this like this entire industry is over saturating what it means to be limited,

[03:11] what it means to be exclusive.

[03:13] I do think one of the funny and somewhat ironic things we witnessed yesterday was this.

[03:19] Jerry is always touted this whole thing as being the future of pinball, like looking

[03:25] forward, being innovative, approaching this hobby differently.

[03:29] But if you really think about it, the stuff that actually made his company successful

[03:35] were the tried and true tactics of the pinball industry.

[03:40] He created FOMO by doing a limited edition game.

[03:45] He got a licensed theme.

[03:48] These tactics he has avoided since the beginning of his platform and the moment he actually

[03:55] pulled the lever down on the stuff that I've been saying on this podcast for five years,

[04:02] once he marketed this thing the way you're supposed to market a pinball machine, he had

[04:07] success.

[04:09] And he hit his KPIs and he hit his goals and he did it in just one day.

[04:13] I also want to congratulate them on staying true to their word.

[04:17] They're only making 227 LEs.

[04:22] If this were American Pinball, they would have announced, oh wait a minute guys, we're

[04:27] going to make another 227 because we didn't realize how strong the demand was.

[04:32] And I applaud them for this because this is how you do it.

[04:37] You told people we're going to make this many.

[04:39] He created the right amount of FOMO and people walk through the door and hand it over $2,000.

[04:47] And it was a bank wire people like you can't do credit card charge backs, but we do know

[04:53] that once you get your ETA ship date, if you're not happy with that ETA ship date, they will

[04:59] give you a refund.

[05:00] Now this is a great day for them, but here is the thing.

[05:06] It is easy to take deposits.

[05:08] It's easy to take orders from people.

[05:11] Now the hard part begins.

[05:14] Now they have to make these games.

[05:17] I am super curious as to when Jerry will say, game number one of Weird Owl, your ETA ship

[05:26] date is this.

[05:27] And I don't mean the kit because it's a lot easier just to make the kit than it is to

[05:32] make the entire thing.

[05:34] Now how many of these 227 do you think were sold to existing P3 customers?

[05:40] I have to imagine that 100% of P3 platform owners bought this game.

[05:47] How could you not buy this game?

[05:50] This looks like the most fun P3 game to date.

[05:53] It looks like it shoots the best.

[05:55] It's got a theme that people like.

[05:58] It's basically the best game on this platform.

[06:01] And so I would have to imagine that you would buy it.

[06:05] Now at 4800 bucks going in on the LE is not cheap though, so maybe you went for the standard.

[06:12] But all 227 are sold.

[06:14] Here's the other thing I thought when I heard that it's sold out in one day.

[06:18] Jerry now can only make licensed themes.

[06:21] And I mean it when I say this.

[06:23] This is it Jerry.

[06:24] I hope you learned a lesson yesterday.

[06:27] Nobody wants Canon Lagoon.

[06:30] Nobody wants Lexi Lightspeed.

[06:33] Nobody wants Cosmic Cart Racing.

[06:36] They want licensed themes.

[06:38] You sold more in just six hours than you did in six years because you made a licensed theme

[06:47] game.

[06:48] You can't go backwards now.

[06:50] So this is the turning point.

[06:53] This is the tipping point.

[06:55] He is finally learning what I've been saying and the rest of the industry has shown him

[07:00] all these years.

[07:01] And Ben Heck has been screaming about this forever.

[07:05] It is also the reason why David Fix's AP strategy will not work.

[07:10] It won't work if you want to be successful and set your company up for long term pinball

[07:16] success and create a user base and a fan base and a marketplace for your company.

[07:23] You need to make licensed theme games and it worked and I'm happy it worked because I've

[07:30] been saying it forever.

[07:32] Jerry put a licensed theme on this platform.

[07:35] Now is this the license I would have chose.

[07:38] No but I think they were very realistic with their KPIs.

[07:42] I think 227 was very reflective of a couple things.

[07:46] How popular Weird Owl is and how quickly they can make games.

[07:52] That is the big question now.

[07:54] When do you think people will get their games.

[07:56] Here's my guess.

[07:57] If I'm a guessing man.

[07:58] My guess is that Jerry is going to tell people that the first Weird Owls will start to arrive

[08:05] in June.

[08:07] So I think it's going to be about four to five months from now in which people will actually

[08:12] start to get their games.

[08:14] Now that's just half of the equation because the other part and this is the hardest part.

[08:20] How many can they make a week because if you're Weird Owl number one and they can only make

[08:26] 10 a week it's going to take a while to get to 227 because the other thing is this is

[08:32] it a lot faster to just make the kits versus making the whole unit.

[08:37] I'm not sure.

[08:38] Right.

[08:39] Nobody else is doing it this way.

[08:40] Nobody else has like cabinets and the base platform and then the kit.

[08:45] So we shall see how efficient Jerry can be.

[08:49] And the other part right and we've seen this with Spooky.

[08:52] This is a numbers game now.

[08:54] Jerry needs to decide how much money do I want to invest in talent and how much money

[09:00] do I want to spend on people coming in like labor costs.

[09:04] How much money do I want to spend on getting more people in here to make these games around

[09:09] the clock maybe so people get their games sooner because if you have people come in

[09:15] and they just work like a nine to five day you also could have a night shift come in

[09:19] and make the games as well.

[09:21] If you have all the parts inside your factory what's stopping you from having shift A and

[09:26] shift B you know maybe they do it that way.

[09:29] I don't think they'll do it that way because I think he'll want to be on hand as these

[09:33] games are being put together.

[09:35] I really hope they can fulfill all of the weird out orders by the end of the year.

[09:41] I know that doesn't sound very efficient as I said Stern would make all of these games

[09:47] all of them in just three days.

[09:51] I mean think about how crazy that is.

[09:54] Stern could fulfill the weird out LE orders in three days and so we don't know yet what

[10:00] people's ETA will be.

[10:02] We will find out sooner than later.

[10:04] People are speculating it might take Jerry a month to figure out what he's going to say

[10:10] the ETA is.

[10:11] Now do I think people are going to bail on this.

[10:13] No.

[10:14] I think people pretty much tell people six months or eight months because these are weird

[10:19] out fans.

[10:21] Like we know that the majority of the pinball buying community they're not like P3 fanatics

[10:27] they haven't really bought into Jerry's platform.

[10:30] They haven't.

[10:31] You know why I know that because they didn't buy this thing until he had weird out on it.

[10:36] So these are weird out fans and if you're a fan of weird out you are super happy that

[10:41] you got a weird out pinball machine because you are never going to get a weird out machine

[10:46] from Stern or JJP or like spooky or from CGC.

[10:52] So you got a theme you want it from the only company that would probably make this theme

[10:59] and from the looks of it I will say from the looks of this game it looks like it shoots

[11:04] well.

[11:05] It's got one of the coolest toppers in pinball.

[11:08] The artwork from Matt Andrews is great.

[11:11] You know this is like one of the P3 machines where like when you look at it you're not

[11:15] walking away like what is Jerry thinking you know because Jerry I'll be honest he probably

[11:20] will listen to this.

[11:22] Jerry's system has always been a game where like you go up at the show you talk to Jerry

[11:26] you know he's always very nice he's always very cordial you play the game you have a

[11:30] few games on it and you walk away and you're like what is Jerry doing like people don't

[11:35] want to see lightspeed the art's not there this is not there and this is a game where

[11:40] I don't think people are going to walk away and have that feeling and I've always said

[11:45] it like it's funny right it's ironic the closer he gets to just making a normal pinball machine

[11:52] the more successful he'll be and I mean it when I say it if this game didn't have the

[11:57] screen and if it wasn't inside a P3 cabinet if it was just a Matt Andrews art package

[12:04] regular pinball machine on wood I bet you he would sell even more.

[12:09] I mean that's just me we'll never know we'll never know but that's just me because you

[12:13] know it's 13 one that was the most surprising thing is people spend 13100 dollars without

[12:19] even blinking all gone if you ask me like a year ago Chris would Jerry Stelenberg be

[12:25] able to sell 227 weird Al games for 13100 dollars a game more expensive than guns and

[12:33] roses collectors edition I would have been like you're nuts you're nuts but here we

[12:37] are but I'm happy he did it I'm happy they sold I'm happy people are excited to get their

[12:43] games I mean this is what pinball is about you know here's a funny thing who's gonna

[12:47] get games out first fathom or weird Al Haggis pinball all of a sudden looks like man I feel

[12:54] like Jerry Stolt a lot of Haggis pinballs thunder with this game I do I feel like you

[12:59] know we kind of look at the boutique companies in a separate bucket right these are not the

[13:03] big operations these guys are not trying to sell thousands of games they're really trying

[13:09] to sell just a few hundred every six months you know I feel like Jerry had a very good

[13:14] day the other thing Jerry's not gonna do the mistake he's not gonna make he's not gonna

[13:18] pull a Damian he's not gonna take your money and tell you the games are gonna be on the

[13:22] line in two months I mean that's what Damian did I think Jerry's gonna be smarter with

[13:27] the ETAs I think he's gonna be smarter managing expectations because this is it like this is

[13:33] it for Jerry he finally got people to come through the door he finally got people to

[13:38] buy into his vision and yes it's not a huge amount of games sold he's not the new George

[13:44] Gomez of the pinball industry but this is a beginning he finally has some momentum he's

[13:52] always needed to get through this door first he's now got it and if I'm gonna give him

[13:58] some marketing advice Jerry you found what works for your platform find license themes

[14:05] that are a little bit niche get the license for them and make games like this all you

[14:12] need to do Jerry all you need to do to be successful is get a license theme that can

[14:18] attract between like three to five hundred people every new game right and it's gotta

[14:23] be a theme that like activates these niche sort of like subculture fan bases and if you

[14:29] can do that you'll be really successful in getting to your goal because think about it

[14:34] like this we've now got probably 250 to 300 p3s out there because of weird out maybe more

[14:41] you then go after like another fun niche property let's say he had spinal tap and you get another

[14:46] 300 spinal tap fans to buy in you do this three to four times and all of a sudden you turn

[14:52] around and there's 1500 p3s out in the world or a thousand of them and then all of a sudden this

[14:59] is his dream all of a sudden you've got this buyer base and meanwhile Stern's gonna start

[15:04] charging you fifteen thousand dollars per le and all of a sudden Jerry's le's are only 4800 then

[15:11] you start to see the value proposition I was wondering yesterday I wonder if anybody bought

[15:17] this I didn't realize what they were buying into like they don't realize the modular system of it

[15:22] I wonder if any like just casual weird out fans like saw this and got one and now they're like

[15:27] wait what's heist like what's cosmic kart racing I don't know I don't know it doesn't really matter

[15:33] the games are sold there's a lot of positive energy coming out of yesterday for this company and I

[15:39] think it's good and now it's in Jerry's court to maintain this positive energy and this momentum

[15:45] it's gonna come down to transparency it's gonna come down to honesty about their ability to make

[15:51] these games and then it's gonna come down to I think the most important thing is this is the game

[15:56] good is the game gonna be great does the game shoot great is it fun and I've heard from people who

[16:02] have played it that the game shoots great and it's a lot of fun you know you think about spooky

[16:07] it's the opposite people are not happy with the gameplay they're not happy with the code I mean

[16:12] spooky put out one of the most unfinished games I've ever seen since I've been covering this hobby

[16:18] and look at what their years been like it hasn't been good I mean I see spooky now being like

[16:23] we're gonna change the user interface on these games I don't want you to put a game out in the

[16:29] world for an entire year and now you're not happy with the user interface I think people are kind

[16:35] of over it I think people are really disappointed in spooky I think they see those games as being

[16:40] somewhat lazy and they never should have gone out that unpolished so Jerry it looks like this

[16:45] game might be done right I don't think Jerry showed this game incomplete I don't think Jerry's

[16:50] gonna ship this game to people with half the code inside it and so that's exciting I mean I hope

[16:55] that's the case the ball is in his court but for once Jerry has the ball for a little bit right

[17:01] Stern's not in the new pinball game right now Jersey Jack pinball for some reason just can't

[17:06] seem to ever tell us when toy story is gonna happen Chicago gaming company is gonna come out

[17:11] with a game that's been out for 25 years I mean this is a new game it's a new experience brand new

[17:17] experience for everybody and I think it's gonna have I mean this when I say it I think this game

[17:22] is gonna have a really good showing at TPF I do I think he's gonna get more orders for this game

[17:29] after TPF I think his greatest challenge is going to be fulfilling the orders I also think he needs

[17:38] to make another topper that topper is awesome Jerry I think you pulled the Jersey Jack mistake I

[17:43] think you should look at what they did with the cactus Canyon topper just be like oh yeah um

[17:47] there's also a standard plus of weird Al where you can get the topper because you can make so much

[17:53] money with the topper you know it's funny about having a topper on a p3 because are people really

[17:58] gonna take the topper off if they put the heist in and I don't I wouldn't it's just gonna be at some

[18:03] point this whole thing is gonna be so Frankenstein you can have Lexi lightspeed art on one side of

[18:08] the cabinet you can have a cosmic heart racing on the other you can have a weird Al topper and you

[18:13] can have a heist game inside the machine all at once that's what canada should do I should get a p3

[18:18] and see how many different games can I have represented at one time and just confuse people when

[18:24] I take photos standing in front of it anyway I just want to say congratulations to Jerry and team look

[18:29] I've said some like really strident things against Jerry and his marketing decisions but

[18:34] ultimately ultimately this man has paid his dues in this hobby right he made p rock like this is

[18:41] some of the good karma coming back his way it's also and I mean this it's also a testament to why

[18:49] marketing is important you have to give your customers what they want people want it weird

[18:56] Al if this was an unlicensed theme like another heist you're only gonna sell like a handful I think

[19:04] he learned the lesson that it's worth investing in a good license more than anything we don't want

[19:10] food truck we don't want dialed in we don't really want legends of vahala we don't we don't I don't

[19:17] care what anybody else says you give me a licensed theme that has a fan base and you are going to

[19:25] outsell any unlicensed game three to one and you're gonna sell it out so much faster there's a

[19:31] reason why you're never gonna see another unlicensed game from spooky pinball why do you think that

[19:37] is so Jerry congratulations thank you for finally taking the advice not just of canada but the whole

[19:44] pinball community it's not that we didn't want to buy your product we didn't want to buy canon lagoon

[19:51] it's that simple everybody have a great day and thank you so much for the support you can probably

[19:56] hear I'm losing my voice a little bit it's the end of the day but I still wanted to get you a show later

[20:20] you
