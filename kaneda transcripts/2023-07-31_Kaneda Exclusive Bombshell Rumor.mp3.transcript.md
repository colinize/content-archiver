[00:00] Who's ready for an end of the month, Canada Bomb Shell?

[00:02] And no, it's not that Stern's gonna sell games directly.

[00:06] Here we go, hit the music.

[00:07] It's my life, don't you forget.

[00:15] It's my life, it's never over.

[00:27] Oh, Canada's been bought podcast.

[00:29] Coming at you with a rumor that is so damn hot, it's burning my microphone.

[00:34] I just need to tell you this rumor.

[00:36] Now what have I been saying all year, everybody?

[00:39] You gotta wait and see.

[00:40] You gotta pause.

[00:41] Big stuff is coming and man, oh man, oh man, is big stuff coming.

[00:46] I'm not even gonna talk about themes on this episode.

[00:48] Well, maybe a little bit about themes, but that's not the big news.

[00:52] In the world of Thinball, there are two driving forces that will make you buy a game site unseen right now.

[00:59] The first one is the theme.

[01:00] There are some themes out there that you would just buy it even if you didn't see it.

[01:05] Even if Homepin was making it, you'd consider it.

[01:08] But this is not that rumor.

[01:10] The other thing that would make you buy a pin is if you knew it was coming from the hand of a pinball god,

[01:17] from the king of modern pinball, the man who can do no wrong, the man who is the new king in pinball.

[01:24] As I said, this man is running circles around everybody when it comes to pinball design.

[01:31] And he seemingly can do so much with just a little bit more budget than Mr. Steve Ritchie.

[01:37] And that is no other than Mr. Keith Elwin.

[01:40] And here is my big bombshell rumor, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:43] And you heard it from Canada when I told you Keith Elwin was gonna make a fourth version of James Bond,

[01:49] and it was a single level game, and everybody doubted me what happened.

[01:53] It came out.

[01:54] Here is what I am hearing is going to happen.

[01:57] I am hearing that in the year 2024, in the world of pinball, we are going to get more than one Keith Elwin cornerstone game.

[02:08] You heard it here, first people.

[02:10] Keith Elwin is slated to release two games in 2024.

[02:15] Remember, Godzilla came out in September of 2021.

[02:20] And you know this guy could have designed James Bond's 60th with one hand tied behind his back and blindfolded.

[02:26] And so we know that Keith is very prolific.

[02:29] He is always designing pinball.

[02:31] I mean, look how fast he designed Avengers.

[02:34] I think he made Avengers in less than a year.

[02:36] So he has had a lot of time to think about pinball machines.

[02:40] And if you are a stern pinball, this is your closer.

[02:42] This is your ace.

[02:43] This is the best designer you can put on the field.

[02:46] And maybe it is perfect timing.

[02:48] Maybe we need two Keith Elwin games in one year to justify the prices.

[02:53] So that is what I am hearing.

[02:55] And here is my speculation.

[02:56] I think we are going to get game number one very early on in the year.

[03:00] And I think that is going to be Jaws.

[03:03] And then I think we are going to get John Borgs, John Wick.

[03:06] And then I think we might get another game from Mr. Keith Elwin.

[03:10] And with Stern moving into this new factory in August, what does that mean?

[03:13] Could they bump up to a fourth cornerstone a year?

[03:16] Who knows?

[03:17] Who knows?

[03:18] But I am telling you right now.

[03:19] You heard it here on Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[03:21] Next year expect to see two new games from Keith Elwin.

[03:26] New games.

[03:27] Not Jurassic Park Anniversary editions.

[03:29] But two new games from the modern day Pinball King.

[03:34] As if you needed another reason to just wait and see and pause your pinball spending.

[03:39] I mean, it is not good news for you people out there shelling out $9000 for Stranger Things Pro.

[03:45] Stop buying Stranger Things Pros and Premiums people.

[03:49] Stern is going to rerun that game.

[03:52] I am seeing another Stranger Things Premium for $13000.

[03:55] Are you smoking something people?

[03:57] When Stern reruns this game with a UV kit installed, it is going to be $10,000.

[04:03] Why would you spend $13,000 on an old premium when you are going to be able to have it new and box?

[04:10] I bet Stranger Things comes out in that November, December time period when there is a little bit of a low.

[04:15] They are going to make more of them.

[04:17] But you are not here for Stranger Things.

[04:19] Now go to FinSide, Canada saying two Keith Elwin games in 2024.

[04:25] If I am wrong, I bet Keith Elwin will say I am wrong.

[04:28] But that is what I am hearing.

[04:30] It is going to be a big year for Stern.

[04:32] A big year for Keith Elwin.

[04:34] A big year for everybody that listens to Canada and just waits to next year.

[04:40] And now that we know this right now, that you know that Keith Elwin has two big games coming out next year.

[04:45] What is that going to do to the value of Godfather, Galactic Tank Force and all these games?

[04:51] Do you still feel like you want to send $13,000 in on a Venom LE?

[04:55] Do you want to spend $10,000 on a Venom premium?

[04:58] Why don't you just wait a year from now when the Venom code is done, you will easily be able to get those games.

[05:05] I don't know why people just can't be patient.

[05:07] I love patience.

[05:08] I love waiting to buy something.

[05:10] I love waiting until the time in the game is right.

[05:14] And I'm telling you, I just feel it.

[05:16] I feel it in the pinball world.

[05:17] It's in the leaves.

[05:18] It's in the grass.

[05:19] It's in the wind.

[05:20] It's in the sunlight.

[05:21] It's in everything happening around pinball.

[05:23] Now is a time to just wait it out because so much is coming and you know you're running out of room, people.

[05:31] Clearly you're not running out of money, but you're going to run out of room.

[05:35] And you're going to want to get these Keith Elwin games.

[05:38] Everybody, I love doing this show.

[05:40] A little micro episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[05:43] See now you can take this Don and you can do a new show about Canada rumors that are going to pan out.

[05:49] Most of my rumors do pan out, people.

[05:52] Looney Tunes, Spooky Pinball.

[05:54] It's coming, people.

[05:55] It's coming.

[05:56] Everybody have a great day.

[05:57] We'll talk to you more this week.
