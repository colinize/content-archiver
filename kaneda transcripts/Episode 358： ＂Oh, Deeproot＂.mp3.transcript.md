[00:00] Two weeks after, and I say I've gotten over you, yeah.

[00:07] Hey, kids, I'll ever want to go, hey, kids, hang together, baby, make it.

[00:14] Hey, kids, hey, kids, hang together, baby, make it.

[00:17] Welcome to Episode 358 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, the world's most polarizing pinball podcast.

[00:32] Now look, on this episode we are going to talk deep root, deep root, and more deep root.

[00:38] But before that, I have an announcement to make.

[00:41] I am going on a vacation.

[00:43] And what I mean by that is I'm taking a vacation from this podcast for a few weeks.

[00:49] Now, I'm not sure exactly how many weeks this podcast will go on hiatus.

[00:55] But if you remember my last show, I said I think we all should take off the month of June.

[01:00] So I'm at least going to take off the first two weeks in June from pinball podcasting.

[01:07] A few reasons for that.

[01:09] One, now that we've heard from deep root, I don't think we're going to get any, I mean any significant pinball news in the month of June.

[01:19] At all, I don't think we're going to see Stern's new title until July, August.

[01:24] I don't think the Star Wars Topper is ever happening.

[01:27] Where's the damn Ku-Ku-Klaak Monster's Topper? That's not going to happen.

[01:32] But here's the thing, we do this show many times a week.

[01:36] And so what I'm going to do is this.

[01:39] I'm taking a break because I'm traveling to Vegas.

[01:42] I'm going to France. I'm going to South Carolina for work in June.

[01:45] I've got a lot of traveling to do.

[01:47] And I don't want to have to lug my gear around to do the show.

[01:51] I also don't want to just keep putting up shows because I have to.

[01:55] I want to put up shows when I want to.

[01:58] But I mean it when I say there's nothing to talk about.

[02:01] And I feel the fatigue.

[02:02] And I know my pinball podcasting brothers feel the fatigue.

[02:05] And so I'm going to be the first one to walk through the exit door and say we're taking a break.

[02:11] And so maybe that's good for everyone else.

[02:13] They can capture some of my listeners for a few weeks.

[02:16] But we'll be back.

[02:17] The show's not going away.

[02:18] We're not going on some permanent hiatus.

[02:20] But at least for a couple weeks there will be no more Canadian pinball podcasts.

[02:24] Now there'll be one more show before that break happens because I will air

[02:29] Niels interview I did with him talking about pinquests.

[02:33] So that is going to go up.

[02:35] And I also want to talk briefly just to say like I didn't mean it that way to my boy Ken over at special win late.

[02:44] If you heard his last show, I think I said like a couple shows ago that you know this show doesn't hold punches.

[02:49] And we don't rely on getting people to come on as far as manufacturers go for interviews.

[02:56] And that's why this show is more this than that.

[02:58] And I didn't say anything about special win lid.

[03:00] And I know Ken did a little segment saying, oh, you know, we're going to set the record straight.

[03:05] And I want to just say this for all you out there looking for some drama.

[03:08] It's not going to happen.

[03:10] Ken and I are really good friends.

[03:12] We talk all the time about pinball.

[03:14] I love his show.

[03:15] I love special win lid.

[03:16] I didn't mean anything by that.

[03:17] I still think they gave a very candid and honest assessment of Willie Wonka.

[03:22] And I think Ken's approach to the game is probably better than mine in which he's been doing this.

[03:27] And I think he's been doing this for a long time.

[03:29] And I think that's really good.

[03:30] I think that's really good.

[03:31] And I think that's really good.

[03:32] I think Ken is going to have a great time in mind in which he's like let's just wait and see.

[03:35] Jersey Jack hasn't let us down before with the code.

[03:37] So we're not going to go into panic mode yet.

[03:40] And look, they've had great interviews.

[03:42] And they'll continue to have to have great interviews.

[03:44] And I think they do speak their mind in a candidate way.

[03:48] So Ken, there's my on air apology if you took that statement, I said personally.

[03:54] So it's not about some pin graphics woman who's on pin side.

[03:57] That's the weirdest thread ever that pin up girl thread.

[04:00] It's like so strange.

[04:01] Like a woman drops into pin side and all of a sudden these guys act like they've never seen a woman before.

[04:06] All right.

[04:07] But let's talk about deep root pinball.

[04:09] Now I have to read, I have to read deep root statement.

[04:13] And we knew that June 1st was the pending deadline by which Zidware customers were going to have to hear something from deep root.

[04:23] So let me just read this and then let me give you my take on what we're hearing from deep root right now.

[04:30] Okay.

[04:31] So I'm going to read it word for word and then you're going to hear canadus point of view.

[04:35] May 29th, 2019.

[04:37] This is from Robert Mueller.

[04:38] He says we know there is a lot of excitement around deep root and its mysterious pinball project.

[04:46] We also know there is frustration and how long it has taken to see something

[04:51] let alone experience the deep root pinball difference.

[04:56] If all we wanted to do is compete with existing pinball manufacturers and turn out the outdated

[05:06] and uninspired pinball package as it exists in the market today.

[05:11] It would have been a much easier path and accomplished years ago.

[05:17] We chose a different path.

[05:20] The simultaneous development on hundreds of unique pinball innovations and tens of titles has taken much longer than anyone has wanted.

[05:32] The fringe benefit to develop innovative pinball machines is the forced creation of multiple divisions and groups across a wide variety of industries and fields.

[05:45] These would not normally be found in a singular relatively small company, which is why deep root is unique and uniquely positioned to not only provide a different type of pinball experience, but also a cross branded and diverse exploration of new concepts, ideas, stories and experiences.

[06:09] This will keep deep root pinball tied to more popular entertainment choices and trends and our pinball creations relevant for decades to come.

[06:21] There have been endless amounts of speculation in forums or disseminated in the pinball media regarding our pinball project, our finances and even our separate and independent investment funds that have very little to do with pinball.

[06:38] We have definitely had some good laughs along the way at the seemingly endless queue of experts.

[06:46] We will keep on doing what we do best along the following schedule.

[06:53] June 28, 2019. By June 28, we will provide Zidware claimants who won, filed and perfected a claim within the prescribed time and three signed a returned Goodwill agreement, a choice between extending the delivery date or receiving monetary benefits as outlined in each agreement.

[07:18] All other claimants claims or vendors claims will there and after be rejected. That is the final and extent of our self-imposed voluntary Goodwill to deal with the Zidware situation.

[07:31] We jump to November 15 through the 16th, 2019. At a minimum, several Razer prototypes will be available to play at the Houston Arcade Expo.

[07:43] Fall, I love this here. Fall 2019, all the way through the summer of 2020. Knowing exactly when we launch is a valuable trade secret that allows competitors in undesirable competitive advantage.

[08:00] At a minimum, the five days of deeproot will be scheduled and Razer will be available for sale during this time period.

[08:09] We fully intend to make good on our 2018 pinball Expo promises. We regrettably did not accomplish in 2019.

[08:19] Robert J. Mueller, principal and then there's the deeproot address. There's a lot there to unpack and we're going to unpack it now on Canadian Spinball Podcast. Let's start from the top.

[08:32] Obviously this goes up. Obviously people are reading this and the consensus from a lot of people on PINS, not a lot of people, but the comments I've heard are that this is more hot air, more arrogance, more bold claims.

[08:47] I think the consensus too is that there is a disdain or a throwing of shade on the other PINBALL manufacturers. The line that really sticks out for most people is this one.

[09:02] If all we wanted to do is compete with existing PINBALL manufacturers and turn out the outdated and uninspired PINBALL packages as it exists in the market today, it would have been done much easier and accomplished years ago.

[09:17] Let me talk about that line because I think that line has ruffled a lot of people's feathers, has a lot of people upset and sort of has drawn a line in the sand in which we have deeproot and their promises and their words on one side of the sand.

[09:34] On the other side of the sand, it's almost like every other PINBALL manufacturer we know, every other PINBALL manufacturer you might love, every other game you've owned that you might enjoy over the last few years, he is basically saying all of that stuff.

[09:49] It's outdated and it's uninspired. Those are fighting words. That has a lot of people upset because I think a lot of people are looking at their PINBALL collections over the last few years and saying,

[10:03] well, is this true? Are these games outdated and are they uninspired? And here's what I want to say to Robert Mueller and to the PINBALL fans out there. Here's my take on all of this. I agree.

[10:17] I agree. I've been saying that for three years now on this show that you guys are buying PINBALL machines at a premium price and there is very, very little innovation in these games.

[10:31] And I've felt this for years and I've said it for years that I think most people are completely getting ripped off by what they're putting into their games.

[10:42] And so what has been the genesis for deeproot PINBALL is they too, I think, feel that way.

[10:50] And so when Robert gets up there and makes this bold claim that he thinks this stuff is uninspired and outdated and it's sort of what I've been harping on for a really long time, I get that that's a stride in statement.

[11:03] I get that he has shown nothing to back it up. But let me ask all of you out there a question. Who do you want to jump into the PINBALL ring?

[11:13] Do you want someone to jump into the PINBALL ring this late in the game with this many manufacturers? Do you want someone to jump in and just say they're going to make another version of what's out there in PINBALL today?

[11:26] That's how you get more cosmic carnivals. That's how you get more October fest and Houdini's and all these games that I believe are they're not as good as the games from the 90's.

[11:38] They don't have nearly as much interesting mechanical features in them. Most of them, you know, maybe have like check a few of the boxes that we want in PINBALL games, but they don't check most of the boxes and most of these games we all know will not go down as like classic games that decades from now people are going to be like clamoring to get.

[11:57] And so most new PINBALL machines I believe have failed to be innovative, to be truly inspirational and inspiring and like they feel like this is the dream of the designer. I don't feel that way when I look at these games.

[12:13] So the problem with Robert's statements is it's okay for me to say that I'm not happy with this, but he's also not happy, but he has a company that is prematurely, if you will, boasted that they're going to blow up PINBALL as we know it.

[12:29] And it's unfortunate that they said at expo in 2017 or 2018, remember he said by 2019 we were we will make more games in any PINBALL manufacturer ever and clearly that's not happening.

[12:43] So they have to backtrack on that. But here's my point. Here's my point. I've always believed in any category in any industry. It's people who are the most upset and dissatisfied with the current industry.

[12:58] With the current offering in that category, who will make the biggest changes and innovations and leap forwards into that industry?

[13:09] Now look, if this was just Robert Mueller and John Papaduke in a studio like tinkering around, I would laugh these guys to high heaven. I would.

[13:18] I would say there's nothing that's going to come of this. Like it's just going to be vaporware like zidware games words.

[13:24] And but it's not and we know it's not and look, I still I still don't know like if this like expansion into all these different entertainment properties is the right way to go for these guys.

[13:36] But it seems like they are building much more than just PINBALL. But here's a thing. Here's a thing. For those people calling Robert like this, you know, he just doesn't care about us like he's losing.

[13:48] The good will of the community by throwing shade on stern machines and Jersey Jack machines and American PINBALL machines and spooky machines. I say to all those people, you know what?

[13:59] Like I'd rather a guy come in and have this sort of bullish attitude. And here's why because he has to back it up. Now he has to back it up.

[14:08] You know, Robert Mueller is either going to end up being like Elon Musk and really disrupt with an offering or or he's going to feel horribly like there's no middle ground.

[14:19] But but I'd rather have that kind of brazen approach because it's going to give us one or the other. You know what's not going to come out of deep route. You know what's not going to happen?

[14:30] You're not going to get the same game. You're not going to just get like another like cosmic carnival or another haggis PINBALL or all these other games that are just like making PINBALL the same way PINBALL was made 30 years ago.

[14:44] Okay, so that's that's what just excites me because at least at least we have what you could seemingly call a crazy dreamer spitting off like his mouth like all these bold claims.

[14:55] But now he has to back it up now here's the thing here's the challenge here's the challenge and all of this because I'm a dreamer and I relate a little bit with a guy like Robert because I have big ideas and ambitions at work.

[15:05] The thing is this having ideas having dreams is one thing. It's the ability to execute those dreams that becomes everything everything.

[15:14] It's the reason I don't break away and start my own PR agency or creative like you know shop because I can't execute my ideas without the right team around me.

[15:25] And that's why I work for a big company that can execute my dreams. Now he's building a big company around him that I think is going to be able to execute what he's thinking.

[15:34] Now it's all going to come down to manufacturing right I mean that's that's the thing is we've seen this before we've seen many companies prototype many types of PINBALL.

[15:43] Many types of PINBALL games and experiences but then when it comes to manufacturing those games they all fall down right it's like cue the Tiffany song they all fall down like toy soldiers that's what happens when these companies don't have a clue about how to manufacture and that hurdle and that hill.

[16:00] I think is what Robert is is running into it's not because manufacturing it's much deeper than just the assembly line.

[16:09] You got to line up vendors you got to line up parts Robert's going to realize real quick what Jack knows over Jersey Jack if you want to make a game you have to order those parts six months sometimes eight months out just to get the parts in the factory to start making the game now multiply that against thousands of parts now multiply that here's the other hurdle multiply that within an industry in which Stern PINBALL has relations with the game.

[16:38] Has relationships with many vendors and has a lockdown on those vendors supplying parts to competitors so how many of the parts that Robert is are in his prototype how many of those parts does he have access to with a mass order does he have to make things that are readily available to Stern from other vendors that they've had relationships with four decades like the mountain is high to climb here.

[17:04] And then when Robert saying stuff like we have tens of titles that are going to be relevant and entertaining for decades to come yeah I mean I wouldn't necessarily use that hyperbole but I think what he's doing again I get the reason why I still just like it excites me more think about like this are you are are you are you not more excited to see what deep route comes out with then what Stern's next game is let's be honest with ourselves.

[17:34] We know what Stern's games what their games are going to look like every game is a little rinse and repeat we know exactly the kinds of mechs to expect we know the kinds of quality to expect we know the kinds of like you know how much they'll put into these games it's the same every time so gets a little boring gets a little stale I mean over at Jersey Jack they're retreating they're pulling stuff out of these games now they have to make these games more reliable we're never going to see a game like Wizard of Oz

[18:04] again you're just not you're just never going to see that much put into a Jersey Jack game he raised the bar and now with every new launch the bars like slowly going down they have to because the games are we're mechanical nightmares for them right but again all these guys are just trying to make they're trying to make a modern version of a Valley Williams game they're not re imagining what pinball could be and I look I don't think deep roots going to jump as far forward as like Jerry

[18:33] did with P3 right there it's not no no you're I think what they did was this I think they looked at like magic girl and Raza and yeah if they just wanted to make a working magic girl with that beautiful artwork and like fix some of the mechs and code the game they could have had magic girl out the door like a year and a half ago I'm I I'm fully confident they could have done that I think we're just going to see some of the stuff we've

[19:00] speculating about which is much more in terms of connectivity of games I think we're going to see unique use of the screen in the game I think you're going to see more of the storytelling I think you're going to see more of like the ability to you know pick up your game where you left off I think there's going to be a lot of of new stuff that just makes the pinball experience

[19:20] different coming from deeper again I haven't seen anything all right okay so look I think to this the other part that was just going through my head when people are like a Robert to jerk he doesn't care about us like he doesn't know how to win over the good will of the community let me stop you guys for a second and say you know which other guy out there is like a real kind of probably a little bit of a jerk doesn't really care that much about what you think about on Pinside doesn't really doesn't mind because he just lets the product do the talking and he just keeps making money

[19:50] his name is Gary Stern Gary Stern is not like your buddy Gary Stern is not like your friend Gary Stern sold his company to a bunch of investors who have been who have been calling the shots at Stern Timball for years now they're all pouring whiskey and smoking cigars and laughing all to all the way to the bank as you suckers keep buying nine thousand dollar versions of games that are costing them three thousand dollars to make his name is Gary Stern he's not engaging with you on the forum he doesn't really care

[20:19] he laughs all the way to the bank and he has that kind of bullish sort of business mentality that's just like I'm just in this to make a profit and look here's the thing Gary's just in it for the profit if you think they're in this to make you and give you the best pinball games possible and push the envelope of pinball are they are they show me the game point me the game they can't even get a damn star wars to work in two years let alone a monster's topper look I think Stern pinball games are fine I think they're five to six thousand dollar machines

[20:49] that's it that's what they are there are five to six thousand dollar pinball machines they just know that the collectors out there are a bunch of suckers and we keep jumping in and jumping in and jumping in and we just want something that feels more special than the actual thing is so then the special elements of Stern pinball games it's not the pinball experience it's the artwork it's the coding it's the software but there's nothing on the play field that has been very special in a Stern game in a really really really really really really long time and so look that's a big

[21:19] thing that's what you've all been waiting for right so Robert says that comment and it makes people think right now look the other part I'm trying to read like some of the other stuff he says here

[21:29] there's lots of divisions of deep root being grown alright fine alright you know pinball creations relevant for decades to come I'm not sure I would go that far here's the other issue that I've been thinking about it's just basically is this market going to me be strong enough to support this

[21:49] when they finally do get their stuff together and they're act together and what I mean by that is economically you know we're in a in a period now where people have a lot of extra money

[21:58] people the the economy's been strong but if that dips south what does that mean for deep root and decades to come I mean I don't I don't know about you I don't really think pinball has like 20 30 more years of just you know growth there's just no way there is no way

[22:18] kids today are not growing up clamoring for pinball machines don't be blinded by the fact that your kids might like it because you have pinball in your house guess what 99.9% of households don't have a pinball machine 99.9% of kids are not claiming for pinball I think pinball's got another 5 to 10 good years I do then you're going to start to see people aging out a little bit and getting a little bit burnt out new people will of course come into the hobby but I think the next 5 to 10 years are going to be great

[22:48] and I think deep root will be part of that if they get their act together decades to come I don't know I don't know about that maybe that means that they're going to develop machines that can be updated throughout the years to make them constantly new again I don't know we'll see about that now June 18th is the Zidware claim date so people are saying should you take the claim or take the money and run here's what I would do if you if you got burned by John

[23:18] and everybody did nobody won with John pop it up I mean nobody got a working magic girl and nobody got their rosa nobody got their Alice in Wonderland if you got burned by John

[23:28] like we have to go back remember you got burned in the year like 2011 2012 that was 7 years ago 7 years ago you got burned by John pop it up so your money's been gone for 7 years now do you take the money now and run or do you wait and you get a

[23:48] rosa from these guys which they're promising to come out between sometime between the fall of 2019 and this summer of 2020 which is crazy I mean that's like 18 months from now you might have to wait to get your game so look this this to me if I what would I do part personally I would just I mean I would just wait it if you've waited seven years you

[24:15] waited long enough and if you're going to get this game at a discounted price then I would just wait and take the game the problem is they don't tell us yet what the game is worth like if

[24:24] rosa is going to be a spectacular game and cost like $8,000 and you can get one for $5,000 and if you stay in on it or you can get your $5,000 back and call it a day I think that's just a decision you're going to have to make personally if I had waited this long I would just wait it out you know that's what I would do but I think some people might

[24:45] take the money and run and again I can't I can't make up that decision for you guys it's just some of you are just you know you're super angry just want out for good some of you the money doesn't matter everyone's in a different financial

[24:58] situation so if we go on now at the Houston Arcade Expo is where they're going to show rosa and that's November 15 to the 16th okay so that's still ways way in terms of seeing something so I think

[25:12] until then we're not going to hear anything else from deep route and then this window is funny fall 2019 the summer 2020 that is probably the largest launch window ever considering it's not even summer of 2019 now when they say this are they stalling

[25:30] what has happened that has made them go from the you know the five days of deep route at tpf to this and how come this company afford to keep going like this all these months with no money coming in

[25:45] well the truth is a little bit in the middle and I don't know you know look I'm not even going to this is like speculation but I think this is based on what I've heard from people who have talked to people I deep route who have talked to Robert

[25:56] deep route funds is spread across multiple investments and so the investors with deep route funds you know some of their money is going into this deep route pinball and deep route studios venture and Robert promises the people who invest in deep route funds like a certain return and it's spread out so some things are you know are hitting and some things might be missing some things might be at again some things might be at a loss

[26:22] but the investors you know are part of this venture and so that's why they don't need they don't need pre-order money to keep this thing going eventually though you know it is just going to come to the point where they can't keep burning money and losing money without money coming in

[26:40] that's a lot of people on board a lot of salaries but but again you know I mean they have to feel like there's something good coming or it's going to be the biggest disaster ever I love it I love that is this is just like it's like a black and white cookie

[26:56] there's just either side is going to be completely different there is not going to be a middle ground here they are eat well you could eat the black and white cookie in the middle which is the best bite

[27:04] but you know I'm saying this is either going to be the greatest disaster in pinball history or we are going to get one of the coolest new pinball you know experiences that we've we've been waiting for all these years right and so I love it how can you not root for this because you know because the thing is this it doesn't cost us any money to root for this it doesn't cost us anything we get to simply watch on the sidelines and wait to see if all this hyperbole comes to life and comes to fruition far more exciting to me than cosmic carnival and hey you

[27:34] here's here's October fest with one of the worst art packages that the world has ever seen but hey it's got to spirally ramp and we did it now you didn't you couldn't get the art right really I'm so bored look I'm just going to be candid here I'm like really bored with a lot of what we're getting from these manufacturers I mean look at the hype on wankas like dead already even my like screaming from the rooftops about how great wonk is the no one no one's talking about it anymore it's like that it's like the hype is left the building

[28:04] so what is this do now for the pinball landscape well here's the thing it basically to me this puts deep root on a shelf for many many months to come

[28:14] and so okay now if you are thinking about buying a pinball game or getting another pinball game you no longer have to even speculate

[28:22] on whether or not you should wait to see what deep root has because there's nothing coming from deep root in

[28:27] 2019 that you can buy there's absolutely going to be nothing if there are razor prototypes at in November that means there's no way they're shipping

[28:37] roses by the end of the year so that's great I mean I don't know about you but I feel kind of relieved now I don't have to like wonder if I should have

[28:45] waited for a deep root game so I think we can just chalk this company up as nothing is happening no games will be for sale until 2020 so they have missed the mark

[28:56] by a by a long shot but it's no skin off anyone's back so you might as well just like okay let's just go back let's just

[29:03] let's just like put deep root on the shelf and then now we can go back to seeing what the offerings are from Jersey Jack and Stern and Haggis

[29:10] and Sun Coast and CGC you know we know cactus Canyon is the next game from CGC I have all but confirmation on that

[29:17] but we all knew that there's nothing new there and I don't think it's going to be cactus Canyon

[29:21] continued though I think it's going to be the original code which I think is going to hurt that game if they don't have the

[29:27] continued package in it but that is what I'm hearing they haven't been able to you know even get the continued software guy on board to do

[29:35] anything with the game so that's unfortunate and you know so here we are we're back to where we were two days ago right there's no there's not

[29:45] going to be any really like mind blowing thing to happen in pinball now I don't know about you but that leads me to say okay I did

[29:54] something I'm going to be I'm just going to be candid here I did something in the few days ago we could go because I'm bored

[30:00] I'm bored with waiting and I heard that if I am in on a collective edition of wonka which I still emin on I'm going to have to wait to the fall

[30:10] I don't want to wait six months to get another pinball machine experience in my home so I'm going to do something you guys are going to call me crazy you're going to call me all these sorts of names you're going to call me a hit for create but I'm going to put a game in here that I just want to experience and see what all the hype is about

[30:26] I'll let you know what game that is when it arrives but you know and the reason I'm doing this is I've just heard so much stuff about this game

[30:37] and I want to experience it in the right way and I also won't lose any money on this at all like it was like kind of like a no-lose situation for me where I could just get it

[30:46] put it in experience it play it see if it's great or not see if all the hype is real and then I could pass it on if I don't like it

[30:54] and I won't even lose a penny I might even be able to like make money on it that's how silly the market is right now because there are so few options

[31:01] and there are so few games that people are clamoring for and the demand is high on now oh I'm going to take a breath I feel like I just need to like

[31:11] all right Chris it's going to be June soon all right all right we can do this we can do this all right so

[31:16] what is that what where does that leave us stern pinball uh I don't think we're seeing anything new

[31:22] I'll say this about stern lately I doesn't it feel like black knight never came out it feels like the

[31:28] monsters was still the last like stern release I have to keep reminding myself the reason why we have to

[31:34] wait to July August is that black knight actually came out it's it's just that title just like yeah

[31:41] like it's I get it it's fast it's fun but it's just not it just doesn't feel significant and I mean

[31:49] stern is just I can't imagine stern sales are tremendous right now I really hope the next title they

[31:56] come out is something special to me the brine eddie game is the one I really want to see and I think

[32:01] Keith L one is probably next on the line up to let's see what he does you know as as a follow-up to

[32:06] iron maiden those two guys a lot of curiosity around them look Robert Mueller I'm talking to you right

[32:13] now my advice to you is remain mysterious continue to do this stuff I love watching this guy get people

[32:20] riled up I love having a little swagger a little like you know like he you guys on Pinside you fall

[32:26] victim to him so quickly like it's so obvious what he's doing and it's so obvious who he's talking to

[32:32] and it's so obvious he wants to get you riled up because he knows what George Gomez knows he knows

[32:39] what Jersey Jack knows he knows what everybody knows that nobody cares about the 30 personalities on

[32:44] Pinside that moaning grown about stuff like this nobody cares if I showed Robert Mueller's statement

[32:52] to anyone to anyone else I know who's not on Pinside you know what they would do they'd be like oh

[32:57] cool this guy's gonna make like awesome pinball games and they would love the fact that he's throwing

[33:02] shade on the existing product line ups he would they would love it so what the guys got a little

[33:07] swagger the guys got a little like bravado like he has to back it up now I love it you know like

[33:14] everyone else who succeeds in pinball you know has that level of swagger I you know I mean if

[33:20] there's anything that like I always feel like the the only part that hurts Jack is sometimes Jack

[33:24] is just too nice gets pushed around by Pat Lollard Lollard feels like he's like these people are making

[33:30] decisions that Jack can't even control so so look you know like I like if my advice to Robert is

[33:36] remain mysterious because the number one thing that that drives people is curiosity and he's

[33:43] got it everyone's curious what's going on there and I'll say this I didn't hear anything from Jeff

[33:48] over at this week in pinball who visited deep route other than this it's real the stuff that's

[33:55] happening is real it's going to be exciting and we should you know we should root for them to get

[34:01] these things out because it's going to have a real impact on pinball and so I trust Jeff I trust

[34:08] this week in pinball I think he's he's if anyone's aware of what's going on everywhere it's him

[34:14] and so I'll leave it at that you know I look forward to seeing what these guys have cooking I think

[34:19] it's going to be a pretty boring June July if you are a hyper focus on what's coming out next in

[34:25] pinball my advice to everybody would be to just play your games more enjoy your games

[34:31] you know I think a lot of you have a lot of fun with your line ups and that's great you know it's

[34:35] great you know what you should not you should not think any less of the games you love just because

[34:40] there's a deep route promise like hanging over all of us now but look I hope someone raises the bar

[34:49] I hope someone brings more magic back into pinball we've been we've been fooled for too long

[34:55] there's just been all that you know just put artwork down and people think a game is amazing you

[35:00] know the details in the art everything's on the LCD screen I want to mechanism I want a new layout

[35:07] that's like really unique I want I want to be pulled into the pinball experience in a way that's like

[35:14] you know captivating and makes me giddy and makes me like you know immersed in the world

[35:20] I just don't feel that I'm most of these new games I don't know about how you feel that's how I feel

[35:25] I mean and that's why I'm kind of like taking a break too because I just need a break I need a

[35:29] break I sense like when these periods happen we fall back on battling each other and fighting each

[35:36] other and challenging each other we're on the same boat we're on the same boat the pinball

[35:41] fanatic boat it's a boat filled with mostly men it's a boat filled with a lot of personalities

[35:48] and opinions but we're on the same boat and I want you guys to get the best pinball possible

[35:54] and I just think we know what to expect from Stern we already know what to expect from Jersey

[35:58] Jack God did they release Wonka too early or what I mean the more you wake up every day I'm like

[36:03] another day in which why did they release Wonka when they did that's just not the way I would have

[36:08] done it but they did it so wait to see what happens with Wonka code I have no desire other than to

[36:15] say it's beautiful artwork with cosmic carnival no desire to like I don't I don't get it okay

[36:21] happy to have them come on or tell me why I should get it but I just I get it it's a pinball

[36:26] I don't know I'm just yeah cool you did it great nothing special other than art great why

[36:33] um American pinball continues to baffle me they had the greatest creative director in the history

[36:39] who designed them the greatest art package go look at the original Houdini cabinet art and play field

[36:45] and tell me why did they scrap all that I can't get over October fest and how just just

[36:51] bad it looks it they they they're so much in it why they had six months to redo that art package

[36:58] six months it just looks I just can't get over it I'm sorry can't get over it just can't get over

[37:05] something that just you know the easiest thing to do is put good art over the game Joe Balser put

[37:11] a ton into that game Josh Kugler has been working really hard to do the code on the game I

[37:16] and fair it to I heard the code is like gonna have a huge update all that to me all that's great

[37:21] but they messed up because the permanent thing that I have to look at all the time is like one of

[37:26] the most hideous art packages ever and there's no way around that there's no excuse there's absolutely

[37:31] no excuse they could have got franched or do the art package for it seriously he's a he's a freelance

[37:36] or they could have got dirty donny look like the fact that cosmic carnival looks as good as it does

[37:41] and October Fest looks as crappy as it does what does that tell you about who's creatively

[37:47] directing stuff over to American pimple and the thing is this they're all to blame Joe Balser

[37:53] and Josh Kugler and Dovel and Normal all four of those men stood over that game and said it looks

[37:59] good it looks good people are gonna buy this it looks good it looks terrible terrible do you disagree

[38:06] can you to pinball gmail dot com what else is who else is even out there Chicago game people are

[38:10] still waiting on their monster bash remake alleys that games awesome but again like the remakes 30

[38:15] year old games you don't really care all right everyone one more episode for me it's gonna be

[38:23] Neil from pin quest already record it like two weeks ago it's gonna go up I'll do maybe a

[38:28] little sign off but I need a break can you tell I need a break and I will come back on air before

[38:35] my break is up only if only if some big news breaks in pinball I mean only if like I don't know

[38:41] it has to be big news it's it's not gonna be because of toppers release it's not gonna be because

[38:47] there's a new code update it would have to be a new game release maybe if will he want to finally

[38:55] shows us a video clip with the video and the audio together maybe we could see that why can't

[39:01] that be can they can we finally get an answer on that can someone because I've reached out to

[39:06] Jack and Joe I get the most vague responses it's like everything you remember from the movie is

[39:11] gonna be in there yeah but are you gonna have video and audio together like a movie clip and

[39:15] there's just like they can't why can't we get an answer on that why is that so hard my condolences

[39:22] to everyone who bought yellow brick road edition wizard of osses I'm sorry you have it's you know

[39:28] it's funny as I heard from people who bought it it says that they're only gonna make 500 and like

[39:33] the manual or something but they didn't put that on the game itself so why didn't Jack just say

[39:39] that this is the collectors edition of wizard of os and there's only 500 and this is the last

[39:44] wherever gonna make a was it it doesn't make any sense you you know what number game you are but

[39:49] nowhere on the game itself is it say out of 500 I this is why people this is why I need alcohol

[39:59] and meds I don't understand these decisions who makes these decisions why is it so hard okay

[40:06] and then Stern we're not gonna hear anything for a while all right well this has been episode

[40:11] 358 of Canadian pinball podcast I do implore I want to say this I do implore that all my other

[40:18] pinball podcasters out there whether we're friendly or not I think we all should take the month

[40:24] of the first two weeks of June off let's start there I just I think everyone's burnt I can hear

[40:30] it in Marty's voice even said it like it's just you wake up and he's like just like just nothing

[40:35] really left to talk about right now and maybe we can do this once a year or two times a year in

[40:40] which all of us just take a break it's you know the the the late night talk show host they do it

[40:48] everyone who has a show does it and yet we're just expected to keep making pinball content without

[40:54] without stop without a break and here's the other thing we don't get paid for any of this so we

[40:59] keep doing it and doing it and doing it and I don't see you know I we don't get paid you know

[41:06] I got a little patreon that's it but like it burns this out for your entertainment and I think

[41:12] we all need that break I can hear it in Jeff's voice I can hear it in Ken's voice I can hear it in

[41:16] everyone's voice like it's just and I'm gonna be the first one to walk through the exit door

[41:21] so you're not gonna hear from me other than the next show but then it's gonna be some time in

[41:26] like middle late June unless major news breaks all right everyone enjoy your day deep route I love

[41:34] it I love the swagger I love the arrogance I love the cockiness I love that it's like got a lot

[41:38] of you unravel you can't take people with swagger forget it I'd rather have Kanye West creative

[41:45] directing my decisions than like some humble guy doesn't really know like how to get the crowds

[41:49] going you know Kanye West made a billion dollars from Adidas because people want the Yeezies

[41:55] deep route better be the Yeezie of pinball later everybody

[42:15] you
