[00:00] All right, let's do this real quick.

[00:06] Share screen.

[00:10] Let's see what we think. It's probably already out there. It's always already leaked by the time I do this.

[00:19] Feel like I'm going to go in here and everyone's chatting about it already.

[00:30] Um, but, but, but, but I got like two minutes.

[00:33] Just gonna take a look at it.

[00:36] I feel like is that your camera count?

[01:04] All right.

[01:09] Hey guys.

[01:12] How's it going?

[01:16] I waited four hours for the switch. I waited four hours is this is Jersey jack out.

[01:28] 48 ballpads. Is that accurate?

[01:31] Is it out? Have they released it? Have I?

[01:34] Is it like already on Facebook? Should I just go like?

[01:37] Did they launch it early? Like, oh, everyone always does. It's noon, right?

[01:43] Oh, let's see Jersey.

[01:46] Does anyone have a link? Is it out? Have they?

[01:55] I'm not sure.

[01:58] I'm not sure.

[02:01] I'm not sure.

[02:04] I'm not sure.

[02:07] That's just the title.

[02:11] We're all waiting, right? Have you guys seen anything yet?

[02:15] I've got my Nintendo switch.

[02:18] 11 a.m. in Chicago.

[02:20] What are they doing this?

[02:24] Jersey jack.

[02:27] I just want to like, I always love doing these first impressions live with everybody.

[02:33] I don't see anything.

[02:36] It's usually their website.

[02:41] Jersey jack. Don't watch without me.

[02:46] Hold on.

[02:49] It's on Pinside. How's it on Pinside already?

[02:57] They still got Avatar on their website.

[03:00] I love a good countdown that is not accurate.

[03:04] I didn't want to have to watch it on Pinside.

[03:08] It is 12 noon in New York.

[03:11] I played Mario Kart. It's amazing.

[03:14] The pictures.

[03:15] I was looking at pictures.

[03:21] I thought there was going to be some sort of launch video.

[03:27] Can someone put it in the link?

[03:30] Did they take away the countdown clock?

[03:35] I wanted to see something live with you guys.

[03:38] It's on their Facebook.

[03:42] Let me refresh.

[03:49] I don't see it.

[03:56] Let's see.

[04:02] We're going to watch it together.

[04:06] Calm down.

[04:11] Let's do this.

[04:16] Hold on.

[04:17] Let's do first impressions.

[04:22] Okay.

[04:28] Can everybody do this?

[04:31] Dear students, you have been accepted to a special place

[04:39] where every flicker of light holds mystery waiting to be discovered.

[04:47] Return to Hogwarts and reignite the Mac.

[04:54] Relive iconic scenes from all eight Harry Potter films

[04:59] and take to the Quiddit pitch to become the ultimate pinball wizard.

[05:04] Explore the castle and uncover its secrets.

[05:08] Shopped, died on the alley for wizarding women's pills.

[05:12] Rule ported potions in the school dungeons

[05:16] and learn challenging spells that will aid you in your journey.

[05:22] Retake the aid.

[05:25] Danger looks beyond the school grounds.

[05:31] Wands ready.

[05:33] Prepare to defend yourself against the dark arts.

[05:38] Retake the aid.

[05:54] A magical world of adventure awaits.

[05:58] Will you rise to the challenge and become a hero of Hogwarts?

[06:03] The wizarding world is at your fingertips.

[06:08] Master of magic.

[06:12] Wow.

[06:20] All right.

[06:21] Well, I'll get hold on.

[06:23] I don't want to watch it again.

[06:26] I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[06:29] I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[06:32] Hello, Mark.

[06:35] All right.

[06:36] Okay.

[06:37] So it looks.

[06:41] Here's my first.

[06:42] Here's my first opinion.

[06:45] That editing was so fast.

[06:47] I don't like how quick they were cutting away.

[06:50] And I get why they wanted to keep the energy going.

[06:53] I don't know if I can do it.

[06:56] I didn't get it.

[06:57] Okay.

[06:58] So that that like just from a just from a video standpoint.

[07:01] I'm like, I don't like overly fast editing like that.

[07:04] It looks fun.

[07:05] It looks fun.

[07:06] It's like, you know, I like the.

[07:09] For those saying it looks loaded.

[07:12] I'm not sure yet.

[07:13] I have to see it.

[07:14] Like.

[07:15] I didn't see balls flying to the air.

[07:17] I don't.

[07:18] Is that a thing?

[07:19] I don't think they fly through the air.

[07:21] I don't think they fly through the ball path.

[07:23] So I don't think we're going to see.

[07:25] I'll tell you this.

[07:26] I got it.

[07:27] And then.

[07:28] I don't think it looks that loaded gang.

[07:31] And I also didn't see the ball.

[07:33] Really do anything magical.

[07:35] Like I mean, if we're thinking that a turning mech.

[07:40] Is now magic in pinball like just turning to change the pathway is magical.

[07:45] Like go look at the theater of magic trunk and look at all the stuff that did.

[07:50] I want to see as I see more of this.

[07:53] The other thing that you know is my big watch out is.

[07:58] I feel like it's going to be muted clips.

[08:00] And I can tell by I feel like I can tell that by what they showed on the screen.

[08:05] Because if they had like iconic scenes from the movie that you're going to hear those characters talking.

[08:11] I'm a little worried.

[08:13] That this is not going to be.

[08:16] Like it draws or it got Zilla or you know a theme integration that really shows us those actors.

[08:23] So that's my again.

[08:25] I'm only going off of like a minute and a half video.

[08:29] It looks fun.

[08:30] It looks like you know.

[08:34] But again, let me just explain what I mean to like I just don't see the drama in the mix.

[08:38] The way I did in Wizard of Oz like is that all the more with the mask on I don't you know the wizard of Oz like the which coming up way more dramatic.

[08:45] The flying monkey way more dramatic the spinning house.

[08:49] You know everything in Waz had a lot of drama to it.

[08:52] So did pirates so did you know Hobbit had a lot like smacked.

[08:56] So there's like there's no singular thing.

[08:58] Okay.

[08:59] And again, I think that.

[09:00] And then I got I got to run gang.

[09:02] Obviously a lot of thoughts coming on this.

[09:04] I think that this hobby has over the last like four years been gaslit by so many empty games that you shelled out so much money on that you.

[09:14] Now, I'm not saying this game isn't loaded but from what I saw it.

[09:24] It definitely is such an improvement over avatar and I think Elton in terms of stuff in it.

[09:32] But again, people are going to compare this to the earlier efforts of Jersey Jack.

[09:37] And does it have the wow in that area.

[09:40] I think the game is going to shoot much better than probably most Jersey Jack games.

[09:45] I'm all about like how did they integrate the theme into it?

[09:49] Okay.

[09:50] Okay.

[09:51] I also like did they announce the order window for the C.E.s can someone say that in the chat.

[09:57] I think the C.E. top or I got to be honest.

[09:59] I think it looks a little cheap.

[10:01] I was expecting much more of a of a leo or like.

[10:07] I was expecting a little bit more of that.

[10:17] But again, the whole game has this kind of brighter vibe going on.

[10:22] So yeah.

[10:23] Are there only two additions?

[10:25] I didn't see a third addition up there.

[10:28] Are there are there going to be three versions of this game or just two?

[10:33] Okay.

[10:43] Three additions all the same game play.

[10:48] Okay.

[10:49] Well again, again, I just.

[10:51] I'm curious to see how the.

[10:55] How the C.E.s move at that price.

[10:58] And what they do with like the order window.

[11:01] I still think they should have just kept it at 1000 C.E.s and at least let that have some retention value, but I don't know.

[11:10] But overall, like let me go to the Jersey Jack website and see what they're ordering with the telling customers real quick.

[11:21] Jersey Jack pinball your next pinball is here by now.

[11:24] Let's see what they say.

[11:28] I mean, literally it says by now and it takes me right to a Harry Potter collector's edition deposit with no information whatsoever.

[11:38] I think this is like really a little confusing to be honest.

[11:45] There's no.

[11:49] Okay, let's see collector's edition shipping.

[11:52] Charges.

[11:53] Okay, I had to.

[11:56] What?

[11:58] Let's see.

[12:00] Yeah, I just I don't think that top or it looks that great gang.

[12:04] I mean, I mean, it's interactive, which is fine, but I just I'm not like, I'm not like wow.

[12:12] I think the gold looks different than the godfather gold.

[12:24] Yeah, you know, I mean, look, it's um, let's see.

[12:37] What's the deal with the C.E. order window?

[12:39] Has it does anyone know that?

[12:41] I mean, I just would in order of C.E. now until I know what the actual window with or how they're handling it.

[12:48] Did they say?

[12:58] I mean, like, I'm not going to the top is fine.

[13:05] Yeah, I think the gold wire forms are going to look great.

[13:10] It's definitely not worth $5,000 more.

[13:13] You know, you're not going to have any, you're not going to have $5,000 more fun on the C.E.

[13:17] Then you would on the arcade edition.

[13:19] But can anyone answer me?

[13:21] Then I got to run and I'll obviously, you know, obviously do content about this a show tomorrow about this.

[13:25] Can anyone answer me how the C.E. ordering is going to work?

[13:28] And when are you going to see gameplay?

[13:30] Again, I just wouldn't give a non-refundable deposit until you see a little bit more.

[13:41] Anybody? Anybody know?

[13:44] Does anybody know what the C.E.

[13:49] I don't know, have they said anything anywhere?

[13:56] Or they just taking orders and not saying anything?

[14:01] I'm assuming by the silence here that nobody knows anything.

[14:07] Okay. So it's not limited to a thousand and nobody knows what the actual numbers they'll make.

[14:14] See, I have a problem with that from a marketing standpoint.

[14:18] I think that is, that isn't cool.

[14:22] I wouldn't want to buy something being billed as a collectible and a limited game without the transparency of what the limit would be.

[14:32] I don't like that, Jack, did that with the Yellowbrook Road edition.

[14:36] I think it's shady marketing. If you don't, you should know.

[14:40] And again, if it's an order window, then say that.

[14:43] They should publicly have said it before the order banks open.

[14:49] And they have it.

[14:57] I love people are like, it looks amazing and looks awful.

[15:05] I'm so curious about the code.

[15:08] I just looking at the clips they showed, doesn't it feel like it's going to be another muted clip journey?

[15:15] Doesn't it?

[15:16] Like it's starting.

[15:18] I feel like it's going to be another muted clip journey.

[15:23] So yeah, I don't know.

[15:25] I don't know, man.

[15:26] I want it more.

[15:27] I will say this.

[15:28] And then I do.

[15:29] I do, you know, my club members will hear a lot more.

[15:33] I do feel like I wanted to see the ball do something magical disappear over here.

[15:40] Go over here, magic wand battle with magnets.

[15:43] I do feel like I did you see the ball do anything magical yet in a pin about magic.

[15:51] And we've had many pins about magic before that have made the ball do magical things like where's the disappearing magnet?

[15:57] Where's the shoot across the field?

[16:00] Like that quidditch match.

[16:01] Come on, gang.

[16:02] It's just a little orbit up top.

[16:03] Like I'm just saying, like, where's the drama in what the ball is doing?

[16:07] And again, I think this hobby.

[16:10] And I'm feeling good.

[16:11] I got my switch to for 450 bucks.

[16:14] I'm feeling like this hobby has been so ghastly that you guys like don't even know anymore.

[16:20] Like what you should even expect for 10 to 15,000 dollars.

[16:23] And it's really like you'll talk yourself into anything at this point.

[16:28] But you can't tell me though, gang.

[16:30] Like look at this game.

[16:32] It's fine. I think it's pretty.

[16:33] I think it's they're going to sell a ton of them.

[16:35] But put this game next to toad in and tell me about mechanical magic and wizardry and seeing super cool things happen.

[16:45] I'm just saying that I don't I think ball paths are the new toys.

[16:50] I think just things rotating now is like got you guys excited when like the theater of magic trunk not only did it rotate.

[16:57] It had a scoop. It had a magnet.

[17:00] Like you know what I'm saying is a bash toy.

[17:02] Like I'm just saying I'm just saying I think I think everybody does hobby is now like, you know, just just been ghastly.

[17:09] It's good. It's good.

[17:10] I mean, again, I'm saying like I think this game is going to be fun.

[17:13] I'm obviously just giving some quick first impression.

[17:16] I think the edits on the game were like a look in the video where a little quick on purpose.

[17:23] So we shall see.

[17:28] It's not going to sell. It's a location game. This is not gang. It's going to sell.

[17:34] It's going to sell.

[17:35] Totten is only overrated because the software was built for nineteen nineties arcades cause like anyone that craps on toad in needs to understand.

[17:46] You have lineman sheets coding toad in or any of these modern software teams toad in would be one of the greatest games of all time.

[17:53] The only reason toad in gets old is because the software is shallow, but gang, come on.

[18:00] Don't don't don't crap on the greatest magical engineering minds that ever applied their talents to pinball from the mid nineties like and look at stuff now and say you think we've improved.

[18:11] We've got glassy or looking playfields for sure that chip and dimple we've got artwork that screams at you, but you know what I'm saying like don't don't the the magicians were in the nineties.

[18:25] Okay. Okay. Everybody be good.

[18:29] I look forward to seeing like more on this game. A lot will come.

[18:33] Guys, thank you for the support and subscribing. A lot of fun. It's going to be a lot of fun talking about this game.

[18:40] Yeah, I just it nothing's really making me jump out of my seat yet. And I don't know like only Ian over a nudge is probably jumping out of his seat being like you have to love this at all costs.

[18:51] You have to love this. I have to get people to buy a nice magazine. Okay. Later. I mean there was a free plug for you. You owe me money.
