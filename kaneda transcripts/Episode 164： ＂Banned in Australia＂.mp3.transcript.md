[00:00] We think that's the manning of the first-member protects material.

[00:08] We don't talk about the art of harassment, sexism, brutalism, women in my music man.

[00:13] You don't do that in my music man, I'm tired of you, so I'm just...

[00:23] What happens when you try and stand up for what's right?

[00:27] When you try and say people who use words that are hateful, that are hurtful, that are insensitive, that are racist,

[00:34] when you try and point that out what happens in our society.

[00:38] I'll tell you what happened to me yesterday, I was banned by the Aussie Arcade form, banned by them.

[00:45] I can no longer communicate or give my point of view.

[00:49] Yet Mike from Homepin is still a member. Mike from Homepin and others in that community

[00:56] can post racist things, hurtful things, insensitive things, and defend it, and they are completely fine.

[01:04] And then you go over to Pinside.

[01:06] You go over to Pinside, a place where the moderators are now asking people not to talk about anything other than Mike's Pimball project.

[01:19] That if you talk about something else, they might eject you from the thread or moderate your post.

[01:26] And I'm sorry but this is despicable.

[01:30] It is unbelievable that we are in a community that will not allow the discussion of people when people in the community do things that are incredibly egregious.

[01:42] And yet when you read the Pinside thread, when you read the Aussie Arcade form thread,

[01:47] it's amazing that people are somehow blaming me.

[01:51] Like I'm some attention seeking egomaniac that baited Mike into saying something or entrap them, and this is all just about my attention.

[02:01] I didn't put anything in Mike's mouth.

[02:05] I did not put words in his mouth.

[02:08] I did not make him say what he said.

[02:10] I simply went to where he said it and said I disagreed.

[02:14] And what did he do? He kept defending it.

[02:18] Let me read to you something that was moderated by Pinside.

[02:23] Because this again, it just makes me so ridiculously upset that we are now defending.

[02:31] Someone who thinks it's okay to drop the F word and the N word, casually in conversation like it's no big deal.

[02:39] And when they're called out and they defend it, and then there's a whole bunch of people defending it.

[02:45] So someone wrote on Pinside, this is what the post was.

[02:49] I was interested in the Home Pins product, but I choose not to support a racist homophob.

[02:55] I'm out.

[02:56] And that post was moderated with the comment, personal attacks are not allowed.

[03:02] Okay, so Mike's allowed to say these things.

[03:05] He's allowed to say, hell yeah, I use the N word, ask anybody in Vancouver, I used it.

[03:11] Hell yeah, like people who want same-sex equality, I'm going to call them this.

[03:15] And if you say, I don't want to buy your product now, because I don't agree with that,

[03:20] you're going to be moderated by Pinside moderators.

[03:24] Okay, now look, this is exactly the reason why I covered this topic.

[03:30] It definitely makes people feel uncomfortable.

[03:33] I've had people email me saying, you know what, thank you for doing this.

[03:38] I completely agree with you.

[03:41] I've had a person email me and say, you know what, I've unsubscribe to your podcast.

[03:45] I don't want to listen to this kind of stuff.

[03:48] And I don't really, I really can't make you do anything.

[03:54] If you agree with me or you don't, that's your prerogative.

[03:58] But I think this pinball hobby has something that is going on underneath the surface of it at times

[04:05] that nobody wants to address.

[04:08] You know, you can say like it should only be about pinball.

[04:11] We should always only talk about pinball.

[04:14] I'm sorry, but how can you separate the person from the pinball that they make?

[04:19] Right, we did it with John Papadu, we keep forgiving him, we keep forgiving him, we keep forgiving him.

[04:23] You did it with Andrew Highway, you kept forgiving him, you kept forgiving him.

[04:27] As long as they make your precious little pinball machine, you absolutely overlook the person.

[04:35] And I just don't think we should do that.

[04:38] I think people should be held accountable for the things they say and the things they do.

[04:45] And here's the thing too, making a pinball machine does not erase the other sides of who you are.

[04:53] It's not this sort of, it doesn't blanket you, it doesn't just give you this universal approval rating

[05:01] because you're a pinball guy and you love pinball.

[05:04] So everything else you say, I'll take it with the grain of salt.

[05:07] And that's sort of what is going on.

[05:10] It's what Robin and the moderators are trying to do on the pin side.

[05:13] It's what Aussie arcade form is doing by banning me.

[05:17] Let's ban the guy that they call me all sorts of names, egomaniac, a psychopath, a shitster, me.

[05:26] Like I'm a shitster.

[05:28] I didn't say anything wrong, okay?

[05:32] What did I do that was so egregious that I was banned from Aussie arcade form.

[05:38] And you know what's funny is I have friends over there in Australia and man, it's hard press to find people

[05:45] that are really coming out and saying what he said was wrong.

[05:50] So I think it's just a really sad day for the Aussie arcade forum.

[05:55] I mean it is a place that clearly isn't support of this kind of language and this kind of behavior.

[06:03] And you know I find it extra funny that to try and deflect all this, Mike is now leaking pictures of the Thunderbird playfields.

[06:12] I saw it, I saw it. And look hey, I would love to discuss it.

[06:16] I would love to talk about Thunderbird's pinball, but it's not that simple.

[06:20] It's just not that simple.

[06:22] I think Mike from Home Pin should apologize for these statements.

[06:26] And I'll say this, if he apologizes for these statements, you know, I'm willing to like take down these podcasts and remove this discussion from the chronicles of pinball.

[06:37] But he won't, he won't. And that's just the kind of man Mike is.

[06:42] And I don't care if he's making a pinball machine.

[06:45] I am disgusted by what he said and I think you should be too.

[06:50] And if you're not and you think I'm just being some politically correct crusader, that's your prerogative.

[06:57] And that's up to you to think that.

[07:00] But I'll say this, I've talked to many people out there who are in line with what I'm thinking is that we need to get this out of pinball.

[07:12] And to get this out of the pinball community and to get the individuals out of the community, the individuals who send Jack danger, homophobic messages, messages of hate, individuals that are dropping words like the end word saying it's cool, you know, whatever.

[07:29] And I'm just part of my culture. Get them out of pinball. If you want to open up pinball to a broader audience and get more people involved and have fun with it, then you can't be in support of people who are going to say things that are divisive, right?

[07:45] That turn people off.

[07:47] And look, canada, I've been banned from pinside. Go back and ask, why was he banned? What did I do that was so wrong that I should be permanently banned? I don't even care.

[08:00] I don't even care. If I was such a terrible member of the community, right? If I was someone that provided nothing, right? All these people, I read them on the forums.

[08:10] I refused to listen to his podcast. I refused to hear what Mike said. All these people who say that, then why would anyone listen to the show? Why do I have you listening to this show? Why do a thousand plus people listen almost weekly to multiple episodes about pinball? And in my point of view on pinball?

[08:30] And the reason is simple. I think I give a pretty accurate assessment and call it like it is in terms of the people in the hobby, the games in the hobby, and what's going on in pinball, right?

[08:44] If I was so incorrect all the time, I would have a hundred listeners. I would have maybe ten listeners. I'm not bragging about the people that listen to the show, but I'm saying it's that number that keeps me going.

[08:58] Because I know I don't always take the most popular stance. I'm a guy that interviews George Gomez and then a few months later says, you know what?

[09:08] It's absolutely disgusting that Stern doesn't have code updates for Batman. I know that George Gomez will probably hear that. He may never want to come on the show again.

[09:16] I'm someone that interviews Jersey Jack and I get 2000 plus listens when I talk to Jack and when I talk to him, I had dialed in collectors edition on order.

[09:26] And then I canceled my order because I didn't think the value was there. And you know what? A few days ago, Jack sends me an email and says, happy birthday, Chris.

[09:35] And that's why I love Jack. He knows he's got a great product and he's not mad at me because I bailed on it because Jersey Jack knows I will buy a Jersey Jack game one day when it's the game I want, when it's the value I want.

[09:48] And I love his company. I'm super excited for Jersey Jack pinball. I'm super excited to see what Stern comes out with next. Don't get me wrong. Christopher Franchi, John Borg, Guardians of the Galaxy. I can't wait to see that game.

[10:03] I can't wait. I mean, prior to the Caribbean, too, I'm so excited to see what it looks like at expo. I think it's going to blow people away. I think it's going to blow people away.

[10:14] Who, Deenie, how is it going to look finally when we're done? What is Josh Kugler and Jo Balser? What have they been up to all these months leading up to expo? The game's coming out in Q4.

[10:27] You know, the final version of who, Deenie, we're going to get it. Attack from Mars Remake Ellie is incredible. We're about to get monster bash. There's all this amazing stuff going on in the hobby.

[10:37] And it's why I love talking about pinball. But every once in a while, every once in a while, there's going to be a deep root moment where we need to call out people that should not be in this hobby.

[10:51] We're going to call out Mike from home pin. That man is vile. He is vile. His beliefs are vile. And if you want to support him, that's on you.

[11:03] But I wouldn't support a man with those kinds of beliefs. And I'll say it to his face. I'll say it when I see him. But I won't see him because Mike doesn't care about going to American shows. His market is elsewhere. And that's fine.

[11:17] But you know what? Cool. There's going to be those moments where I will go on attack mode and go after people that I think deserve to be attacked because they're saying things and doing things that are hurting this community.

[11:32] People, I got a lot of flack. A lot of flack when I went after Andrew highway from people. You know, what are you doing? He's just you should support everybody who's in pinball.

[11:44] I got a lot of that. I got that yesterday too. Someone said to me, you know what? People hate your podcast. I was at a pinball show in Australia. And everyone, a lot of people were saying they hate your podcast. And that you should support all things pinball.

[11:59] And I responded to that person. I said, I love movies. Should I support? Should I just say I love every movie that I'm excited for every movie to come out?

[12:07] This notion that pinball makes you like have to be universally supportive of everyone in it is absolute bullshit.

[12:17] Should nobody call out Dutch pinball for what they've been doing? Should nobody have called out Andrew highway for what he was doing?

[12:24] Should no one call out Kevin for what he was doing or J-pop for what he was doing? I just don't get that. It's part of our hobby. You have to take the good with the bad.

[12:35] You have to. And pin sight is a place that wants to moderate out the bad. Right? A lot of people in the pinball forums, they want to live in this world with revisionist history. Right?

[12:48] They want to live in a world where nothing ever went wrong. Where no one ever lost money. Where all pinball is good pinball. It doesn't matter. It does matter.

[12:56] It does matter when charlatans and liars and racists and sexists and people and pedophiles enter into our community. It does matter that we say something.

[13:09] You know, what kind of people are you out there if you if you hear someone believe something that is terrible and is vile, that you'll just be like, I don't care as long as the pinball is fun.

[13:22] If that's the kind of person you are, then I think you're living in a world that's a bubble. Right? I think that pinside is a bubble. I think that Aussie Arcade form is a bubble.

[13:33] And for people telling me to get outside of my bubble to understand why they would say the N word and the F word, I need to understand Australian culture.

[13:42] I say to that bullshit, you're in the bubble Australia. You're in the bubble. You're the place that doesn't have a lot of diversity.

[13:51] You're the place that doesn't understand why those words are hurtful. And you saying them flippantly and in a cavalier fashion, that's the bubble.

[14:00] That's the bubble. And you know what? If you stood in front of my friends who are homosexual, my friends who are African American and you said those things, even just try to try to say those things.

[14:11] In a casual way, you should see what it looks like on people's face when you say those words. Right? So look, there's a huge, huge, huge bunch of great pinball news coming.

[14:25] And I can't wait to report on it. And I'm going to report on it. And this podcast is going to continue to share my excitement and your excitement for things going on in the pinball world.

[14:36] But when these moments happen, we will pivot and we will call them out. And for people like Flinny bus on Pinside, fuck you man.

[14:45] This is not me trying to get attention. Okay. I'm not seeking out these kinds of things. Mike said what he said. And then you want to turn it around and blame me.

[15:00] So you call me an egomaniac and attention seeker. And I'm putting words in Mike's mouth. It's such bullshit. And I think all of you on Pinside see that.

[15:11] You see the desire by Pinside to keep the truth from you to keep the conversation stuck on pinball. We don't want the outside world to infiltrate.

[15:22] But you know what? The outside world is part of the pinball world. You fools. John Trudeau is most likely a pedophile. All right. Mike from home pin is clearly a racist. He doesn't care what he believes that is racism. It is racism. Okay.

[15:43] John Papa Duke is just a bad businessman and a liar. Andrew highway bad businessman and a liar. All right. Kevin. A liar. A bad businessman. All right.

[15:57] A lot of good men in pinball. There's a lot of good men. The good outweigh the bad. The good in the community outweighs the bad. And we have a responsibility to get the bad people out. That's all I'm saying. All right.

[16:11] So I've been banned from Aussie arcade forum. I was banned from Pinside. You know, you go back and you ask like, why was he banned? I you look again, no one can really show anything that is like, oh my god, we can't have a guy like this on the forum.

[16:27] But you know what being banned by these forums, all it does is make this podcast more successful because this is the one place where you can't ban the truth. You can't silence the truth. You can't shut off the conversation that needs to happen.

[16:43] That needs to happen. It's happening in the NFL. It's happening in society. It's happening all over the world right now. This conversation around people and their rights and being fair to them.

[16:56] And standing up for them. And it's not a black and white issue. It's not. It's not Republican Democrat. It's not any of that. But there's just certain things that you don't want to be on the wrong side of the fence. You just don't.

[17:09] Okay. And let's get back to pinball now. All right. I think I'm done with this topic. I'm done with it. I think we've said enough. Our next podcast. What is it? It's like, I'm going to Europe on Tuesday.

[17:24] So I'm going to get up before I go my pinball expo predictions. I'm going to get a guest to join the show with me. And we're going to talk all about what we think is going to happen at pinball expo.

[17:37] It's going to be an interesting expo. I think without a doubt, without a doubt, Jersey Jack is going to own the show. I mean, let's be honest.

[17:45] Ain't no Batman code going to be great enough to be more impressive than what Jack brings to that show. A new Jersey Jack machine. Always. Always.

[17:57] Excites us because we know it's going to be incredible. And the quality is going to be there. And the value is going to be there because Jersey Jack is the only company right now that makes games to the highest degree.

[18:14] They don't cut corners. They don't take stuff out. They put all they can into the machines. But I'll also say this. Jersey Jack is also the company that has really yet has really yet to check all the boxes and ultimately make a game that is as fun in terms of the theme and the game itself that we want.

[18:38] I think they're always almost there and we're waiting for Jack to just hit it out of the park like dialing got really, really close. But the theme.

[18:48] You know, it just nah, nah, like he needs something that like can do it. And I'll say this. The pirates theme pirates in general is a magical theme.

[18:59] Pirates and bounties and you know, rum and ships and treasures and you know the ocean and like sword fighting. It's got the right kind of theme that it could do it.

[19:12] But it's a wide body. All right. We'll see. We'll see. But anyway, this has been an interesting week. And I want to thank you out there who support me, who listen to me.

[19:23] I want to thank you guys out there that hate me. I want to thank you guys that can't stand me but listen anyway because you want to see what I have to say.

[19:31] I want to thank all the other pinball podcasters out there for covering this hobby. I know it's not always easy to cover every topic that goes on in this hobby.

[19:41] And you don't always talk about what I talk about. But you know what anyone who spends a lot of time covering this hobby and doing podcast on pinball.

[19:51] We appreciate it. I appreciate it. I know a lot of people appreciate it. And to all the forms out there, you know, I'm glad you guys exist as annoying as it is to have lame moderation going on around topics like this.

[20:04] I'm still thankful for pinside. I'm thankful for Aussie arcade form and all the people on there because again the majority of people on these sites are great individuals. They help people learn. They give great advice. And the conversation is enjoyable.

[20:19] So you know what? I'm glad they exist. But you know, we had a little bit of a misstep. We had a little bit of a moment where someone needed to be called out. He was. He still won't apologize. I think that says all we need to know about that individual. I would never buy a game from him.

[20:35] Have a great day everyone. If you have any feedback send it to me. I'll read it on the air.
