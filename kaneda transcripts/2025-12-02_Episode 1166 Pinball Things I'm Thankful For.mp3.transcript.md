[00:00] It's just one of those days where you don't wanna wake up.

[00:04] Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon.

[00:08] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:11] We are now into December.

[00:13] I don't know about you, but is anyone else out there just feeling like the cobwebs from

[00:19] Thanksgiving weekend?

[00:20] You got all this food in you, all this drink, having like four or five days off in a row

[00:26] and spending it like consuming so much stuff, playing pinball, and then Monday hits and

[00:32] you like crash into Monday and you're like, I cannot just switch gears from what I've

[00:38] been doing like Wednesday through Sunday and just go back to the working version of me.

[00:44] I think everyone's feeling it right now.

[00:47] It's a hard time in my industry.

[00:48] You might have seen the news.

[00:50] OmniCom has acquired InterPublic Group and they announced this week they are laying off

[00:56] 4,000 jobs.

[00:59] So right now I'm not impacted by this, but it's really bummed me out knowing that 4,000

[01:05] people that were going into the holidays are now all of a sudden not gonna have a job.

[01:12] It's just, ah, you know, it's just a hard world out there and it's not gonna get any easier.

[01:18] I mean, 4,000 people would be a great selling pinball machine and now none of those people

[01:24] are gonna be thinking about buying stuff like toys.

[01:28] They're thinking about the necessities for them and their families.

[01:31] There's a lot to be thankful for in this world.

[01:33] I mean it.

[01:34] And as I think about the pinball hobby and we're gonna go around the horn and just talk

[01:37] about what I'm thankful for for each of these companies that are in pinball right now.

[01:43] Hopefully I don't forget anybody, but there are certain things these companies are all

[01:48] doing right or almost all of these companies are doing right.

[01:52] And what I love about this hobby is every single new machine is an opportunity for each

[01:57] of these companies to show us their point of view on what makes a great pinball machine,

[02:05] their point of view on what a world under glass is, their point of view on what a great

[02:11] pinball theme is, what great pinball art is, what great pinball music is, what great pinball

[02:17] design is, and it's a finite amount of space.

[02:21] And that's what makes pinball so much fun.

[02:24] And you know, here I am today and I'm looking now at this X-Men accessory video.

[02:29] Did you see this thing today?

[02:30] It's got this woman's voice who, I don't know, she's probably a stern employee, but it sounds

[02:36] like AI.

[02:38] It sounds like they wrote a script and they are having a female AI person narrate the accessories

[02:45] for this game.

[02:48] And look, nothing about it is like, wow, it's a little weird, right?

[03:11] It's a little weird trying to drum up excitement for a game that has basically been just butchered

[03:19] by the community since it came out.

[03:21] I mean, the game's been out for over a year.

[03:23] It came out last summer and the code wasn't good and it got rushed out and now we're being

[03:29] asked to accessorize it.

[03:32] See, Stern still just doesn't get it.

[03:34] Who wants to spend good money on top of bad?

[03:39] If you've lost so much money on X-Men and you have, if you bought it new in box, are

[03:45] you going to go buy these accessories?

[03:48] Or if you were smart and you weighed it, you really got a good deal on an X-Men LE.

[03:53] It's still a beautiful machine.

[03:55] And if you got an X-Men LE, you don't need the inner art blades.

[03:58] You might be looking at this topper for 1600 bucks.

[04:02] In the end, I think Stern's got to figure out a solution to all of this.

[04:06] They can't do it like this anymore.

[04:08] They can't have a game come out code incomplete for over a year.

[04:12] They can't have a game come out where it takes over a year to get the topper to get the accessories.

[04:18] Does Spooky Pinball make your way to year?

[04:20] Does Barrels of Fun make you way to year?

[04:23] Does anyone else out there in the pinball world make you wait an entire year for the

[04:28] topper?

[04:29] And as we think about, you know, different moves these companies need to make, I think

[04:32] Stern Pinball needs to figure out a way to just get the accessories and the games themselves

[04:37] released at the same time.

[04:38] I mean, that is not a hard ask.

[04:40] I know the Jaws 50th topper is coming out and the only difference from the Jaws 50th

[04:46] topper from the regular Jaws topper is just the frame around the billboard is red.

[04:51] Why would that take a really long time to get approval?

[04:54] Is that enough?

[04:55] Is that good enough?

[04:56] Is that even creative enough?

[04:58] Does it even need a 50th anniversary topper?

[05:01] I don't know.

[05:02] I don't really feel like it does.

[05:03] But hey, if you're going to do it, does making the billboard framed in red make it unique?

[05:09] I don't know.

[05:10] Like the billboard from the movie wasn't framed in red and I get you're matching the armor

[05:14] on the game, but that is what it is.

[05:17] I'm really tired today, by the way.

[05:19] So killie and a couple of things happen that I got to just let you guys know about.

[05:23] So I think it was like Sunday, super tired.

[05:26] We walked away for just a little bit and we have our Christmas tree up and all of a sudden

[05:32] I'm upstairs, Brandon's upstairs and we hear a crash and the sound of like some broken glass,

[05:38] a sound you never want to hear when you have young kids in the house.

[05:42] And we run downstairs and there is the Christmas tree.

[05:46] It has fallen over, but not just that.

[05:50] The sound of a wailing Cassian coming from underneath the tree.

[05:55] Yes, the Christmas tree fell on top of Cassian and he's there just spread out on his belly

[06:02] wailing and he's fine.

[06:05] He wasn't injured and I'm like, I don't know what happened.

[06:07] I think when Brenda put the tree onto the stand, it wasn't exactly straight because

[06:12] I was holding the tree and she was supposed to see if it was straight or not because where

[06:16] he was under the tree, he was kind of like mid tree.

[06:20] So I don't think he was pulling on it because he couldn't reach mid tree.

[06:23] I think he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and then I had to spend hours,

[06:30] hours on Sunday cleaning up everything, putting the ornaments back on, which is no fun at

[06:37] all.

[06:38] And then yesterday at about one in the morning, our other son, Killian, he sat up and he just

[06:43] got sick and just threw up right in the middle of the bed.

[06:47] And I've been up like all throughout the night with a sick little one and he stayed home

[06:51] today.

[06:52] So you can imagine trying to get back into work on a week in which none of us really

[06:57] want to work as we're laying people off and you're exhausted and then you've got to turn

[07:02] on your computer and everyone's expecting you to be creative, to be positive, to keep

[07:07] everything moving forward.

[07:08] And you spend most of the day working in PowerPoint and you're wondering, what are we doing?

[07:13] What are we doing?

[07:14] What happened to the old world in which we could just go to lunch with a client and be

[07:18] like, what's your problem?

[07:19] How can we help you?

[07:21] Why does everything always have to instantly become PowerPoint slides?

[07:27] It's like nobody's able to just talk it out anymore.

[07:30] We have to put everything in slide format.

[07:33] All right, but that's not why you're here.

[07:35] I want to thank each and every one of you for signing up for Canadian Pinball Podcasts

[07:39] and staying with the show into December.

[07:42] Don't worry, I'm not going to be this exhausted on most of the shows.

[07:45] You know that and I know that.

[07:46] So what am I thankful for with each company that is out there in the pinball world?

[07:52] Well, before I do that, I want to say I got an update and this is not surprising.

[07:57] Sonic the Hedgehog is now delayed.

[07:59] Now it's not really delayed because it was never scheduled, but I'm hearing now that

[08:04] it is not happening in April.

[08:06] It is most likely June or July now.

[08:11] If I were a guessing man, I don't think it's going to come out before like October.

[08:15] I don't because when you think about how many Harry Potter's they've made, they probably

[08:20] have only made about like a thousand to 1200 and they probably got like four to 5000 orders.

[08:27] So I just don't think they're ready for another line.

[08:31] They should be, but I just don't think they've ever had like a brand new game on the line

[08:37] when we still have to make all of these other versions of this game.

[08:40] When Guns N' Roses was on the line, were they running another game?

[08:45] I forget.

[08:46] I think so.

[08:47] But maybe it was like Godfather, like a game without a lot of demand.

[08:51] Maybe it was Toy Story.

[08:52] Yeah, it was Toy Story, right?

[08:54] It went G and R and then Toy Story.

[08:56] So I don't know.

[08:57] I don't know.

[08:58] I would love to see Jersey Jack run two games at the same time and just make it that way.

[09:03] Like every six months, we get a new game from Jersey Jack.

[09:07] That would be so much fun.

[09:09] Every six months, a new Jersey Jack game.

[09:14] I mean, that would be pretty cool.

[09:15] All right.

[09:16] So what am I thankful for over at Stern Pinball?

[09:19] So here's the thing.

[09:20] I think we're all thankful that Stern just exists.

[09:24] That Stern exists, that they are here and they make games available.

[09:29] A new game every four months.

[09:32] A brand new cornerstone game comes out into the world.

[09:37] So I am thankful that they just continue to hit us with incredible cadence and incredible

[09:44] manufacturing abilities.

[09:46] The quality needs to get a little bit better.

[09:48] The new factory hasn't been cranking out the greatest quality machines, but this hobby

[09:53] would be so boring if Stern Pinball were not a part of it.

[09:58] And Stern Pinball has made so many great games over the years and I am very thankful for everything

[10:05] they do and the amount of games they put out into the world.

[10:09] If I could give them some advice, I think they need to get the themes better.

[10:12] I think they need to think about the LD market differently and I think they need to get these

[10:17] accessories and the codes of their machines further along so that when they reveal a game

[10:23] and they ask us to buy it, we know everything we need to know.

[10:27] I think the days of like rolling the dice are over because just too many people have

[10:31] lost too much money and the games aren't always going to end up great.

[10:36] They're just not.

[10:38] Even if they do end up great, you'd rather wait like six months and get an LE for five

[10:44] or four thousand dollars cheaper.

[10:46] So Stern Pinball, thank you for really like making Pinball manufacturing your number one

[10:52] priority and I can't wait to see what your new game is in January.

[10:58] Even if it's Pokemon, I'm excited about Pokemon.

[11:00] I want to see it.

[11:02] I'm even more excited to see if this Pinball buying demographic buys that theme.

[11:08] Let's go to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[11:09] What am I thankful for over at Jersey Jack Pinball?

[11:12] This is easy.

[11:13] I'm just happy that Jack Winari like made Jersey Jack that he was not happy with the way Stern

[11:20] machines looked.

[11:21] He was not happy with what they were putting into the games and it's crazy to think like

[11:26] 13 or so years ago, he made the Wizard of Oz.

[11:30] Like 13 years ago.

[11:32] Like if he brought that game out today would be the most impressive game today.

[11:36] So in a lot of ways Jersey Jack was well ahead of its time.

[11:40] They put the big screen into the game and I'm just thankful that Jersey Jack makes what

[11:45] I still believe is the most beautiful, the most premium and the most stunning pinball

[11:52] machines that have ever been built.

[11:55] It really is on a different level.

[11:58] There is just a level of quality and finesse and craftsmanship and detail that takes place

[12:05] in a Jersey Jack game that you just don't see anywhere else.

[12:09] And I'm very thankful that the games finally shoot as good as they look because for the

[12:15] longest time, even though they looked great, the gameplay was anything but great.

[12:21] And I think they figured that out.

[12:22] And I think the next three to four games from this company are really going to be some stunning

[12:28] games that you and I are going to want to own if we want a beautiful game based upon

[12:34] a theme we love that shoots amazingly well.

[12:38] I'm also very thankful for JP to win, who's made some of the greatest graphics and the

[12:43] greatest animations in the history of pinball.

[12:46] I need to correct myself.

[12:47] It's not like he's going over to Dutch pinball for the first time.

[12:51] If you remember and someone reminded me of this, I forget who it was.

[12:54] So thank you whoever said this to me.

[12:56] JP to win did the code or the animations on the big Lebowski.

[13:02] So if he's doing Dutch is back to the future, it's not his first rodeo with Dutch pinball.

[13:09] So that is exciting that he's going to be working on back to the future.

[13:14] Since we're on to Dutch pinball, let's go to them next.

[13:18] What am I thankful for with Dutch pinball?

[13:21] Well, I'm thankful they don't make me have to spend money very frequently because they've

[13:26] only had two games basically come to market in about 13 years.

[13:31] I'm very thankful and I mean this when I say this, the most thankful thing I feel when

[13:35] I think about Dutch pinball is my personal friendship with Melvin Williams and Melvin,

[13:40] you might be listening to this and I mean this.

[13:42] I'm so thankful that Melvin is over there, that he made Alice, that he's making Raza,

[13:49] that he's keeping the lights on so this company can get to back to the future because if it

[13:54] wasn't for Melvin, there would be no back to the future pinball.

[13:58] The company would not be able to make it to make back to the future.

[14:03] So when it comes to Dutch pinball, the thing I'm most thankful for is Melvin, my friendship

[14:09] with him and how this man is going to create a bridge so each and every one of us will

[14:15] finally get to see back to the future sometime at the end of next year.

[14:20] Let's go over to Spooky Pinball.

[14:21] What are we thankful for with Spooky Pinball?

[14:24] It's hard, it's hard to pinpoint it.

[14:26] I think each and every one of us is just so thankful that Spooky Pinball remains a company

[14:32] that is basically listening to everything we've been saying about them over a decade

[14:38] and I'm thankful that as a company they've continued to improve their product game after

[14:44] game after game.

[14:46] I'm so thankful that they are not a company that rests on its laurels because the laurels

[14:51] were not amazing.

[14:53] We went from a company that had hot glue gun technology all the way to being the first

[14:59] pinball company ever to have Spooky Speak, this voice activated way to interact with

[15:05] your machine.

[15:06] From glue guns to that.

[15:08] I'm so thankful they gave a home to one of the most incredible pinball artists of all

[15:13] time in Mr. Christopher Franci.

[15:16] I'm thankful for their transparency, for their friendship as well and I'm just very thankful

[15:23] that these guys have carved a niche.

[15:27] They know what we want and they're giving it to us and they're looking at every inch

[15:32] of a pinball machine and saying how can we make it better and how can we keep getting

[15:37] better and knowing that Goonies and Gremlins is around the corner, I am thankful that they

[15:43] are going to create an utter frenzy every single year now for the next three years as

[15:50] people try to get their hands on those games.

[15:54] I'm thankful because it's going to make the pinball content I get to create so exciting

[15:59] getting people hyped up for those themes.

[16:01] So what am I thankful for when it comes to barrels of fun?

[16:05] My favorite named pinball company in the history of pinball, look I'm very thankful that the

[16:10] people over there at barrels of fun have brought out three games so far.

[16:15] They've brought out Labyrinth, they've brought out Dune and Winchester's Mystery House.

[16:20] I'm very thankful that David Van Es and Team over there are making what I believe are very

[16:26] very beautiful boutique machines.

[16:28] And David Van Es, he's a nice guy and I mean this, like today he called me, we had a conversation

[16:35] and I want to say this, there's a world in which David could have handled something differently

[16:40] and he handled it with a lot of grace, a lot of understanding and I respect that and it

[16:45] goes a really long way and he got me on a weird week, he got me on a weird day and my

[16:50] initial emotional reaction to him was a lot more unhinged and I am very thankful David

[16:56] that you do call people up and you take the time to explain things and you want to understand

[17:02] people and I know you have a big heart and your heart is in it and you know that making

[17:07] pinball is really difficult and you are also a company that is trying to get it better.

[17:13] You know when you put a game like Dune next to any stern you guys should be very proud

[17:19] and I know I shouldn't have to knock stern to say something nice or thankful about barrels

[17:23] but it's true man, you put Dune next to Star Wars man and I would rather own Dune than

[17:28] Star Wars any day of the week.

[17:30] You know and I am thankful that these guys got Carl on board, I am thankful that they

[17:34] picked a theme that most of us would have laughed at, they took the risk and they hid

[17:39] it out of the park.

[17:40] They sold 525 games in basically two days so I am very thankful that this boutique company

[17:47] is giving us something different and I think they are going to continue to do that and

[17:52] you start to like aggregate all these boutique games and we are living in a new golden age

[17:59] of pinball.

[18:00] The prices aren't the best but think about all these offerings coming from different

[18:05] factories, different people like I said different points of view, different creative interpretations

[18:10] of themes, it's awesome.

[18:13] It's not just one company and that's it, it's not just Bally Williams and Dad East or Got

[18:18] Leave or Capcom like the amount of quality across the board is better now than it's

[18:23] ever been in pinball.

[18:25] I mean that like quality pinball playing experiences and you know look I know these games don't

[18:30] have the mechs like they used to but the game has changed.

[18:34] If you brought most of those older Bally Williams games into your homes you'd be bored with

[18:38] them so quickly because they were never meant for home ownership.

[18:42] Like these guys have a hard go all these modern pinball companies, they got to make something

[18:47] that goes into your home that you are not going to be excited about making money off

[18:52] of it because you are not making any money off of it.

[18:54] The chances are you are going to lose money on the resale value but they've also got to

[18:57] make the game compelling not just for like 50 plays they have to make it compelling a

[19:03] thousand plays, 2,000 plays they have to make it so you want to keep coming back and back

[19:08] and back and that is not easy that is not what pinball was ever intended to be.

[19:13] Alright who else is out there in the pinball world?

[19:15] Multimorphic P3 Multimorphic Jerry over there, Portal, Canada what are you going to say,

[19:23] what are you thankful for over at Multimorphic?

[19:26] Well this is easy.

[19:27] I'm happy to see Multimorphic doing what they are doing mechanically.

[19:31] I still think and I've said this before I think the greatest mechanisms are in Multimorphic

[19:37] games and I still to this day wish they would just make it easier to put more of those mechs

[19:44] all throughout the game because you don't have to work around the screen.

[19:47] But in the end what Jerry is putting into his games even if he has to like fit it in

[19:52] in the upper third of the play field it is absolutely incredible.

[19:57] The mechanical stuff these guys have been putting into pinball machines and I wish more pinball

[20:03] companies were reaching for mechanical complexity and fun the way that Multimorphic is.

[20:10] So thank you guys for showing the rest of the pinball world.

[20:13] Mechanically possible because I think a lot of these companies have removed the mechanics,

[20:19] the artwork is complex, the shots are the new toys, that's the way it's been going.

[20:25] So it's nice to see like multi-dimensional mechanisms still happening in pinball and

[20:30] a lot of them are happening over at Multimorphic.

[20:34] Alright who else is on our list?

[20:35] CGC baby, Canada what are you thankful for when it comes to CGC?

[20:41] I'm thankful that they continue to make medieval madness games forever.

[20:46] I'm just thankful for the quality of their games when they get their games out.

[20:50] I know there's been some issues with the upgrade kit with Cactus Canyon but for the most part

[20:56] I think only one company and only one company in all of pinball could have taken Bally Williams

[21:02] classics and made them better and that is what CGC has done.

[21:06] If someone's going to remake Twilight Zone or remake Toad Inn or remake any classic game

[21:14] you'd want that company to be CGC.

[21:16] So thank you guys for doing it, not sure why it takes you forever to do it, not sure why

[21:20] you can't talk to us on a weekly basis but thank you for making all of those stunning

[21:25] remakes of Bally Williams classics.

[21:28] I do hope we see an original licensed themed game from this company sometime soon.

[21:35] The rumor is halo we shall see.

[21:37] Alright who else is out there in the pinball world American pinball.

[21:41] Oh look I'm just thankful they're coming back baby.

[21:44] I'm thankful they're coming back.

[21:45] They're not coming back with David Fix.

[21:47] It's a brand new company.

[21:49] I think Mukesh is going to hopefully get a licensed theme people want.

[21:53] Is it going to be He-Man?

[21:55] It's not going to be Cuphead.

[21:56] Is it going to be something that we really really want?

[21:58] I can't imagine they went through all of this Cuphead R&D and they are not going to make

[22:04] it.

[22:05] It's going to be weird.

[22:06] I do think they're eventually going to make the Cuphead machine.

[22:08] I'm just thankful that they're returning.

[22:10] They didn't quit for good.

[22:12] I think they needed to go away.

[22:13] I think they needed to hit rock bottom.

[22:15] I think they needed to just reset.

[22:17] Now have they reset?

[22:19] We shall see but I am thankful they're coming back with a new leadership team.

[22:24] Alright pinball brothers.

[22:25] I'm thankful for the fact that these guys are sticking it out.

[22:30] They're sticking it out with Predator.

[22:32] You know like we're only going to make 300.

[22:34] I'm thankful for the fact that they are only going to make 300.

[22:38] I'm thankful for tariffs because it makes these machines easier maybe to say no to.

[22:43] Oh, Kanan you're not saying nice stuff.

[22:44] I don't know like what am I thankful for with the pinball brothers?

[22:47] I want to say this.

[22:48] The both the pinball brothers and Padready gaming.

[22:51] I mean this when I say I am thankful you guys are there.

[22:56] You've made the people whole on Alien and that matters man.

[23:01] A lot of people got burned on aliens and you guys came and you made the machines.

[23:05] That was not easy.

[23:07] Picking up Andrew Highways failures and making it work is not easy.

[23:12] You could have ended up like Haggis and you could have gone under and you could have lied

[23:15] to people and you could have never got them their products.

[23:18] It was going in that direction for a long time and you course corrected.

[23:23] So thank you for that.

[23:24] I'm thankful that Padready gaming is going to bring back Big Bang Bar.

[23:28] Really going to use fast pinball board so it'll play a lot better than Funhouse.

[23:34] So I'm thankful that games coming back.

[23:36] I'm also thankful they're going to bring back the J-pop classics.

[23:40] What the quality will be.

[23:41] I don't know what the artwork will be.

[23:43] I don't know but I'm just thankful again.

[23:44] I'm thankful for these options baby.

[23:47] Look none of us need any of these games.

[23:49] I mean when you think about it why would we not be thankful that we've got all of these

[23:53] companies because look the companies executing really well just put the pressure on the

[23:58] companies not executing well.

[24:00] So I'm thankful for competition.

[24:02] I mean if I were to put everybody together turner pinball.

[24:05] I'm thankful for what you're doing with the boards how you're trying to streamline manufacturing.

[24:10] I'm thankful for that stuff man.

[24:13] Now all Chris needs is a theme we really want.

[24:15] We don't need like leftover stuff from Deeproot.

[24:18] I'm never sure why anybody wants to make leftover Deeproot stuff.

[24:21] I mean that Melvin.

[24:22] It's like you know you're going to sell all the Razzes but at some point we're going to

[24:26] run out of J-pop and Zidware and Deeproot stuff and that's good.

[24:31] I'm thankful for the day that nobody wants to remake anything John Papadook Jr. made.

[24:36] I'm thankful for that day in the future.

[24:38] I feel like I'm missing someone and I'm going to hear about it tomorrow but I got to go

[24:43] get ready to go get Cassian and get killing in the bed.

[24:47] Everybody look I'm very thankful for each and every one of you.

[24:50] I want to send a shout out to Tux Browning who's over there in Texas.

[24:55] Tux is a great guy.

[24:56] He's battling through something really difficult.

[24:59] Life is really precious.

[25:01] Every day above ground is a blessing.

[25:04] Life gets hard.

[25:06] A lot of us have a lot of stuff going on that people just don't know about.

[25:11] There is the surface level version of all of us and then there's everything inside and

[25:16] it's a miracle if you find a partner in life that actually gets who you are.

[25:21] It's even more a miracle if you even understand yourself and you really understand what makes

[25:27] you tick and how to make yourself a better person every day.

[25:31] So I'm very thankful that each and every one of you tune in to Canada's Pinball Podcast

[25:35] every single week.

[25:36] I am beyond exhausted but I had to get a show up today so I hope you're thankful that I

[25:42] got you something up that I got you a show.

[25:45] Unlike Guns N' Roses fans right now Axe Rose was supposed to release two new songs today

[25:51] and then nothing.

[25:52] It's so funny if you go to my G&R forum.

[25:55] If you want to read Disappointment, read all the Guns N' Roses fans that are so pissed

[25:59] off that they thought they were going to have the greatest Tuesday ever and now they've

[26:03] got nothing.

[26:04] Everybody be good.

[26:05] We'll be back soon with more shows of Canada's Pinball Podcast.
