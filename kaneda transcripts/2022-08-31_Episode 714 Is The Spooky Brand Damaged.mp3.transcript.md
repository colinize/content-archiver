[00:00] It's not time to make a change, just relax, take it easy, you're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know.

[00:14] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] My favorite post yesterday on Pinside, someone said, hey I checked out that free Canada's

[00:30] Pinball podcast and I thought it was going to be horrible, but it wasn't that bad.

[00:35] Yeah, you know, thank you, you don't get voted, favorite Pinball podcast 5 years in a row,

[00:40] doing a horrible show.

[00:42] So let's talk about the day after this announcement, right?

[00:45] There's been a lot of response to Spooky Pinball, they are in the limelight, they are on center

[00:50] stage right now as everybody waits for Stern's next reveal.

[00:55] The first thing I keep thinking about is does Spooky Pinball know that Stern is going to

[01:00] put out something this Friday?

[01:02] Is that why they are rushing to get these games sold on the Thursday before Friday?

[01:08] I don't know, I really don't know.

[01:10] I know a lot of people in the manufacturing circle, they kind of know what's going on with

[01:15] each other's companies and they keep it a secret, so we shall see.

[01:20] But it is pretty interesting timing when you think about it, why the rush to sell the game

[01:26] this Thursday.

[01:28] The other thing I want to talk about on this podcast is just the simple fact that no matter

[01:33] how I feel about this game, or you feel about this game, ultimately the market will decide

[01:40] whether or not this game is priced appropriately, the market will decide whether or not this

[01:47] is a good move.

[01:48] So there's that, right?

[01:49] And this Thursday at 10am, central standard time, we will see if this game sells out right

[01:57] away or in one day.

[01:59] The other thing I was thinking about this morning is why are we now so obsessed with

[02:04] the game selling out in one day as an indicator of if they got the marketing right.

[02:11] A day one sell out is usually reserved for some amazing game we've been waiting for,

[02:18] right?

[02:19] Some triple A theme, some holy grail revelation pinball machine.

[02:24] It's so strange that now we are so used to this like it either sells out in a few hours

[02:30] or it's an absolute marketing disaster.

[02:33] That's not the case.

[02:35] Like they're going to be making these TNAs now for the next six months, right?

[02:39] That's what they said over a six month period.

[02:42] And so why do they have to sell this thing out in just one day?

[02:46] And it's this new thing in pinball and nobody likes it, right?

[02:49] It's this new approach which we need to lock in these non-refundable deposits on the first

[02:55] day we open up sales or we are going to consider this a little bit of a nervous production

[03:01] schedule.

[03:02] And I want to move away from this and I want to encourage all of us to move away from this

[03:06] behavior.

[03:07] This manufactured FOMO that if I don't get the game on release date, I'm going to be

[03:12] paying more money for this title down the road.

[03:16] If we look at the history of pinball launches over the last few years, that hasn't been

[03:21] the case whatsoever.

[03:23] Isn't it crazy when you think about when games like Deadpool LE came out and they sat for

[03:27] a while, games like Stranger Things LE came out and they sat for a while and you could

[03:33] go and get a Stranger Things LE, new in box for an entire year for $9,000.

[03:40] Now the game is arguably selling opened for somewhere between $13,000 and $15,000.

[03:48] But it's still a really hard pill to swallow when I look at TNA and I look at this game.

[03:54] It's not a $9,000 game to me.

[03:56] It might be a $9,000 game to you.

[03:59] The other thing, now that we've all calmed down a little bit, ultimately when you look

[04:03] at this hobby, every single game is priced subjectively, right?

[04:10] There is the bomb, there's the material cost that goes into the game and then they have

[04:15] to figure out how much above that do I price this game where I think there will still be

[04:23] demand.

[04:24] And that is somewhat of a subjective journey.

[04:27] They are making 250 of these games.

[04:31] It seems like nothing, right?

[04:33] When you think about it, there is a global world out there where there are pinball collectors

[04:37] all over the world.

[04:39] And you are making just 250.

[04:42] In America alone, that means there can only be five per state if these games are bought

[04:48] by pinheads, right?

[04:49] Five per state.

[04:50] It seems like nothing.

[04:52] But then you factor in that it is a small niche community.

[04:56] You also factor in that it's $9,000.

[05:00] And I was thinking about this as I was riding my bike to do this show.

[05:03] I was thinking about, here's the reality of this entire hobby.

[05:07] And this is why it gets kind of scary.

[05:09] Because I think if you were to be honest with yourselves and the people who buy these machines,

[05:15] almost everybody who collects pinball machines, almost anyone who's on pinside every single

[05:20] day consistently, the people who have multiple machines, most of you have six, maybe seven

[05:28] figures.

[05:29] Some of you have eight figures of disposable income at any given time.

[05:35] It doesn't matter if the stock market has gone down over the last six months.

[05:39] It doesn't matter if we're headed into a recession.

[05:43] You're looking at your cash flow and your liquid cash.

[05:47] And you could easily, if you wanted to, drop $6,000, drop $9,000, drop $15,000, heck, drop

[05:56] $30,000 on a single pinball machine if you really wanted it bad enough.

[06:03] And in a world like that, when you only need a handful of people who have that kind of

[06:07] purchasing power, and let me remind everybody, in the United States alone, there are 21,

[06:14] almost 22 million, millionaires in America, 22 million.

[06:20] And if you need to sell just 250 of a pinball machine, I think you're going to probably

[06:25] find some buyers, right?

[06:27] Will this game sell out day one?

[06:29] I don't know.

[06:30] Being surprised is me anymore in the world of pinball.

[06:33] I can tell you how I feel about this game again a little bit.

[06:36] I'll summarize.

[06:37] I don't see $9,000 in value.

[06:40] I don't like Spooky's nonrefundable deposits anymore.

[06:44] And I don't like the way his children are running the company right now.

[06:48] This is second generation Spooky pinball right now.

[06:51] He's handed the company off to his kids.

[06:53] And that's fine.

[06:54] Like, that's the American dream.

[06:56] He's built something.

[06:57] He created something of enough value where the money came in, and they are now making

[07:02] a decent amount of money, especially for a company in Benton, Wisconsin.

[07:07] But I don't like the approach the kids are taking, and I'll tell you why.

[07:10] If you think about it, and I was on Pinside last night, and I was shocked by the amount

[07:15] of vitriol and anger, I was shocked, right?

[07:18] Because Spooky Pinball was always a company.

[07:21] Whenever people spoke about them, they were usually pretty kind.

[07:25] And even if you didn't like something Spooky did, and trust me, a lot of us out there bit

[07:31] our tongue as this company released games that didn't shoot very well.

[07:35] They were brick-fest.

[07:36] Like, we were with them on the journey, but we were always kind to them because we knew

[07:42] they were a small family-run company that was just trying to make it.

[07:47] There was a lot of empathy, and there was a lot of caring that I think this community

[07:51] gave to Spooky Pinball.

[07:52] And we were there.

[07:53] And remember why Spooky Pinball introduced nonrefundable deposits?

[07:59] Because when they did that, every single penny mattered.

[08:03] And if people bailed on their orders at the very end, it could really hurt this company's

[08:08] ability to survive.

[08:09] But that was years ago.

[08:11] That is no longer the case.

[08:13] They are now making a few million dollars per release.

[08:17] They are not on the edge of their seat.

[08:19] They are not on the edge of bankruptcy.

[08:21] But here's what they're doing now.

[08:23] They are continuing that policy.

[08:25] And what that policy now is doing, it's basically screwing over the pinball buyer.

[08:31] Because I think this nonrefundable policy of theirs, it's putting no onus on them to

[08:37] make great games.

[08:39] And I'm still upset.

[08:40] And I think what you're seeing on Pinside right now is a lot of that pent-up anger is coming

[08:45] out.

[08:46] I think we are all still upset that everybody who bought Ultraman in Halloween was forced

[08:52] to buy the game through the Fang Club membership.

[08:55] So we gave them money for the right to buy the game.

[08:58] And then they made us buy the game without showing us the game.

[09:02] And then the games got shown after our money was nonrefundable.

[09:07] Before they built a single game, they did not show us anything.

[09:11] They locked our money in.

[09:13] And then they showed us the game.

[09:14] And the games were underwhelming.

[09:16] And every single person who went in on those games lost their deposit within a couple months.

[09:22] Those games lost $2,000 in value immediately.

[09:26] And none of them have recovered.

[09:27] None of them are worth what we got locked into paying for them.

[09:30] And that is not fair to us.

[09:32] And that was a decision by them.

[09:34] That was a marketing decision by the new people who are running Spooky Pinball.

[09:38] Charlie Emery never did it like that.

[09:40] That was not his approach.

[09:42] And I think a lot of us have been biting our tongue.

[09:44] And I think the part of it is this.

[09:46] It is not an easy black and white story.

[09:48] Yes, we didn't have to go in on it.

[09:50] I think there is this blanket blaming of the community that those are just scalpers and flippers who are upset.

[09:56] No, I want to set the record straight.

[09:58] These aren't just scalpers and flippers that are upset.

[10:01] Everybody's upset.

[10:03] Nobody wanted to buy a game before seeing it.

[10:06] They made us do it that way.

[10:08] And then they did not have a game complete.

[10:11] They were not ready to sell those games to the community.

[10:14] Those games were not finished enough.

[10:16] And they should have shown us those games before they took orders on those games.

[10:20] And that was their decision.

[10:22] And they locked in 1,750 people's money.

[10:25] And then those people lost $2,000 each because the games tanked in value.

[10:30] And it doesn't matter now what any of the fanboys who own one are saying.

[10:35] The games are never going back up in value.

[10:37] OK.

[10:37] And so why is it if someone bought a game on day one?

[10:41] Day one, if someone bought a game from Spooky Pinball.

[10:44] And then when they finally see it, they're like, I'm not satisfied with what you made.

[10:48] Can I have my money back?

[10:50] I'm order number 400 or 500.

[10:52] You're not even going to order parts for my game for the next six months.

[10:55] Why can't I at least get my money back or transfer it to another Spooky game?

[11:01] Why can't I at least get credit with your company?

[11:03] Nope, they won't do that for you.

[11:05] And so they've made a lot of money on these last two games.

[11:08] And so they're continuing this practice.

[11:10] And I don't like it.

[11:11] I don't like that Spooky Pinball is doing it.

[11:13] I don't like that Jersey Jack is doing it.

[11:15] You know who doesn't do it?

[11:16] Stern Pinball.

[11:17] And then just read the responses on Pinside over the last 24 hours.

[11:22] And you know what I'm noticing is this, the brand that Charlie Emery built, the company

[11:27] he built, when Charlie built Spooky, he built it slowly.

[11:32] He built it transparently.

[11:34] He didn't want to overstep.

[11:36] He never wanted to over promise.

[11:38] And he never wanted to under deliver.

[11:41] And Charlie is the reason why this company built so much goodwill with the community.

[11:47] Charlie is the reason so many people support it Spooky Pinball.

[11:51] Now, now that Charlie has stepped aside and the kids are running the company, look at what's

[11:57] happened.

[11:58] They've increased production significantly.

[12:00] They've locked everybody in and they're disappointing people.

[12:04] There's no way around this.

[12:05] When you read the thread, read how people are talking about Spooky now.

[12:10] The brand is significantly damaged.

[12:13] And I hope they see that.

[12:15] And I hope they realize and I hope they call a meeting and say, hey guys, we need to rethink

[12:21] this.

[12:22] We can't just increase the volume.

[12:24] This isn't working.

[12:25] We might be making more money, but we might be setting ourselves up for long term failure.

[12:31] And I think they need to really sit down and take a deep look at what kind of company do

[12:36] they want to be.

[12:37] Because think about it right now.

[12:38] Right now Spooky Pinball.

[12:40] They've scaled up to the point where they want to make like 1750 games.

[12:45] So if TNA is coming out next at $9,000, then how much is their next pinball machine going

[12:51] to be if it's fully loaded?

[12:53] Is it going to be more than $9,000?

[12:55] Are they going to make 1750 Scooby-Doo's?

[12:58] Are they going to lock people in to Scooby-Doo before showing them the game?

[13:02] At some point, and it might be on TNA, it might not.

[13:05] At some point, the consumers in the community, the money is going to stop flowing towards

[13:11] Spooky Pinball because people are going to get tired of it.

[13:14] They are going to get tired of it.

[13:17] Spooky Pinball does not need to do non-refundable deposits anymore.

[13:21] What Spooky Pinball needs to do is make great games.

[13:24] Now here's the thing.

[13:25] They're going to do what they want to do.

[13:27] They're going to keep these non-refundable deposits.

[13:30] They're going to try to create fake FOMO to get you to give your money on one day or

[13:34] you're going to miss out.

[13:35] Trust me, if you don't buy TNA for $9,000, I guarantee you you will be able to get a

[13:41] TNA in 2023 for less than $9,000.

[13:45] Trust me, just be patient and thank Canada.

[13:48] You can go buy me a steak dinner with the money you saved because there is no way a

[13:53] TNA now that there's 750 of them is going to be worth more than $9,000.

[13:59] Just be patient.

[14:00] I implore each and every one of you.

[14:01] I also think just wait because Stern's game is just a couple of weeks away or a week away.

[14:07] Why would you buy this game now unless you absolutely know you want one?

[14:12] But if you absolutely know you want one, I would just wait.

[14:15] Let some other person buy it at $9,000 and you can march in and save yourself money in

[14:19] a few months.

[14:20] Trust me, it's going to happen.

[14:22] So they're going to do what they want to do, but ultimately you have all the power.

[14:25] The community still has all the power.

[14:28] You can decide, I'm not going to do this.

[14:30] I'm not going to run towards the FOMO.

[14:32] I'm not going to lock my money in.

[14:34] And that's what I'm going to do.

[14:35] I don't see myself buying another spooky pinball machine until this company stops the shenanigans.

[14:41] I'm not buying it.

[14:42] I don't care.

[14:43] I'm a 45-year-old man.

[14:44] I also haven't seen an episode of Scooby-Doo in like 35 years.

[14:48] I've grown up and that's cool if you guys want it.

[14:50] But look, I'm just moving past this.

[14:52] I'm done with this.

[14:53] I'm done with these companies and all of their shenanigans.

[14:56] Right now, I am at the position where the only pinball company I really want to support

[15:00] is Stern Pinball.

[15:01] I think they're the only pinball company that doesn't play these silly games with people.

[15:05] I know they're making us wait for toppers.

[15:08] I know that.

[15:09] I know they're making you wait for the rush lighting system.

[15:11] But I don't want to play these games anymore.

[15:14] I want a company that says, here's the game.

[15:16] If you want it, you can have it.

[15:18] And if I give a deposit, I can get my money back or I can transfer it to another game.

[15:22] It's not this like, it's all or nothing thing.

[15:24] And I know that Stern sometimes does nonrefundable deposits, but that's through the distributor.

[15:29] It's not through Stern.

[15:30] As a company, Stern does not require it.

[15:33] Stern just gets it done.

[15:34] So I'm just done.

[15:35] Like I think the whole vibe and this is the crazy part, right?

[15:38] When you think about these pinball companies, look at each manufacturing company as a brand.

[15:43] Look at how sad the CGC brand is over the last like year and a half, right?

[15:47] Chicago Gaming Company used to be a darling we loved.

[15:51] Now they're a company that's nothing but broken promises and delays and delays and delays.

[15:56] Nobody has any confidence in Chicago Gaming Company and everyone's just over them.

[16:00] Look at Haggis.

[16:01] I don't even have to go down that road.

[16:03] Look at Haggis.

[16:04] They absolutely didn't deliver what they said they were going to deliver.

[16:06] And now they took everybody else on a Mickey Mouse ride with that company.

[16:10] They're still hiding out.

[16:11] Nobody knows how many of those fathoms have shipped.

[16:13] Look at Spooky Pinball.

[16:14] They used to be the darling.

[16:15] Chuck used to be the company that everybody rooted for.

[16:19] When I still get back to this very simple point, the moment the kids decided not to

[16:24] inform the dealers and distributors that they were going to do this Monday night, you think

[16:30] Charlie Amory would have kept his distributors in the dark?

[16:34] No.

[16:35] These kids need to learn business acumen.

[16:38] They didn't know what they were doing.

[16:39] I get it because they see the margins.

[16:42] They're going to profit the most.

[16:43] Even if they didn't want to allow distributors to sell this game, they should have at least

[16:48] given them the heads up and shown them the respect they deserve because it's been those

[16:53] dealers and distributors that have helped push their products when they were turds.

[16:58] And I mean this.

[16:59] And it's almost like they don't understand this.

[17:01] A distributor is with you in the good times and the bad.

[17:05] And you can't cut them out when it's the good times.

[17:07] When you know you've got to hit game people want, you've got to keep them in the loop

[17:11] and they didn't do it.

[17:13] And I think it shows where this company is headed.

[17:15] And I think they're in for some trouble.

[17:17] I can see it already.

[17:18] Like they're not used to this.

[17:20] Like I don't know how thick the skin is over there at Spooky Pinball, but they're not used to this.

[17:24] Like you can't find a Spooky Pinball thread that has had so much vitriol as the Spooky

[17:30] Threads over the last two days.

[17:32] And this is what Charlie never wanted.

[17:35] He never wanted to do stuff that disappointed people or upset people or felt like it was

[17:41] a cash grab or felt like he was being greedy.

[17:44] Charlie Emery always did the opposite.

[17:47] And I think they need to reevaluate things.

[17:50] See, it's funny when you listen to the Spooky fanboys.

[17:52] They're like, well, this is just what they needed to do.

[17:54] They needed to keep charging more.

[17:55] They needed to keep making more.

[17:57] They needed to keep growing.

[17:58] And I think people are forgetting like, no, there's common sense that you need to apply as well.

[18:03] If you're going to tell me that Spooky games from now on are going to be pretty much more

[18:07] than a stern premium with tax and shipping, get out of town.

[18:10] I'm done.

[18:10] Like I'm done.

[18:11] And everybody could see right through it.

[18:13] Like everybody can see right through it.

[18:15] Dollars are dollars.

[18:16] You know, as I was saying, the Spooky brand has been damaged.

[18:19] The CGC brand has been damaged.

[18:21] The JJP brand is probably at the lowest it's ever been.

[18:26] Right?

[18:26] I've never seen Jersey Jack Pinball confidence lower than it is right now.

[18:31] I've never seen a lack of interest in Jersey Jack Pinball the way I do right now.

[18:38] If you go to Pinside, someone unboxed a Toy Story CE and guess what?

[18:44] There is no activity.

[18:46] Nobody cares.

[18:47] Nobody's chiming in.

[18:49] Nobody's super excited to get theirs.

[18:51] This is sad to me, right?

[18:53] It's really sad to me.

[18:54] If you asked me like three years ago and you say, Chris, look, Jersey Jack Pinball is going

[18:59] to release a $15,000 Toy Story game and it's going to come out in 2022.

[19:05] And you said, Chris, what do you think is going to happen?

[19:08] And I would be like, oh my God, for $15,000, it must be packed with toys.

[19:13] It's going to be their most epic game of all time, right?

[19:16] I would have all of these high hopes because I would say to myself, how can you charge

[19:20] $15,000 for a machine if it's not your best machine ever?

[19:25] And so Jersey Jack comes out with its most expensive machine ever and it is also their

[19:30] most underwhelming machine ever.

[19:33] So think about that for a minute.

[19:35] How can you release your most expensive machine ever that is also your most underwhelming

[19:40] machine ever?

[19:41] And that is the vibe is all of these brands, right?

[19:44] All of these brands right now are in a really precarious place and they got there at the

[19:51] worst possible time because there's a feeding frenzy in Pinball.

[19:56] It's like Pinball people want to spend money, but they also want the value.

[20:01] They want to get epic masterpiece games.

[20:04] It's so weird to me.

[20:05] It's like they all got it wrong.

[20:06] All of these companies got it wrong.

[20:08] I didn't even talk about American Pinball or Multimorphic, but none of these brands,

[20:13] right, in this period in which consumer demand is higher than it's ever been, every single

[20:19] Pinball brand out there except for Stern has really dropped the ball.

[20:25] They've made mistakes.

[20:27] They didn't read the room.

[20:29] They priced their games all wrong.

[20:32] They revealed their games at the wrong time.

[20:35] They took orders on stuff they didn't know how to make.

[20:38] Like they locked your money in on games that turned out to be terrible.

[20:41] It's like all at once this entire hobby outside of Stern collapsed in on itself.

[20:48] It's crazy.

[20:49] Now it's looking like the only great opportunity in Pinball is Stern's and guess who doesn't

[20:54] need it?

[20:55] It's Stern.

[20:56] They're the dominator.

[20:57] They're the kings of this Pinball world.

[20:59] And they're about to come back out into the Pinball marketplace and everyone else has

[21:03] basically just shot themselves in the foot.

[21:06] They did absolutely nothing.

[21:08] And I'm just going to go out there and make a wild prediction.

[21:10] I don't think American Pinball's tank game is going to light the world on fire.

[21:14] It's not.

[21:15] It's absolutely not.

[21:16] And Stern Pinball is just going to scorch Pinball Earth and they are just going to dominate

[21:23] over the next year and a half.

[21:24] Everyone else has just fumbled the ball.

[21:26] This was the most golden opportunity for all of these other Pinball companies to step up

[21:32] to the plate.

[21:33] It's like Stern was begging them.

[21:35] We're going to take a huge hiatus.

[21:37] Everybody else show us what you got.

[21:39] We're going to give you a great window to dominate Pinball sales, to come out with stuff that's

[21:45] going to actually elevate your brands.

[21:48] And look at what I just said.

[21:49] All of these companies have dropped the ball.

[21:52] Who's really exceeded your expectations?

[21:54] Think about that.

[21:56] Send me an email at canadepinball.com.

[21:58] Name me one Pinball company that has exceeded your expectations of them since Stern Pinball

[22:05] went on their new inbox hiatus.

[22:07] Just one company who's done one thing or made one game that has really blown you away.

[22:15] And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we are not going to just throw $9,000 out the

[22:21] window every time a new game comes out.

[22:23] That is why American Pinball, I think, isn't for a rude awakening this October.

[22:28] If they reveal this Dennis Nordman game, those games better be on the line.

[22:32] But they're not going to be on the line.

[22:33] You know why?

[22:34] Because it's September tomorrow.

[22:36] And they haven't even finished building the 500 Legends of Bahá'lá.

[22:40] They announced like 10 months ago.

[22:42] So what is going on over there?

[22:44] It's still a mess.

[22:45] What is going on over at CGC?

[22:47] Still a mess.

[22:48] What's going on over at JJP?

[22:50] No, nobody really wants Toy Story.

[22:52] They can't make a thousand of these CEs.

[22:54] What's going on over at Multimorphrig?

[22:56] Who knows?

[22:57] Who knows what Jerry's doing?

[22:58] He's not building games.

[22:59] Nobody's unboxing weird owls like six months later after it's been revealed.

[23:04] What's the hold up, everybody?

[23:05] Is this COVID still?

[23:06] Is this still a supply shortage issue?

[23:08] Then why reveal your game?

[23:10] Why lock money in if you can't get the parts?

[23:13] All of these companies have played it wrong.

[23:15] All of these companies have injured their brands.

[23:18] And I think everybody's noticing it.

[23:19] There's only one other brand in Pinball that has not injured itself besides Stern Pinball.

[23:25] And that is the world's favorite Pinball podcast, Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[23:28] We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.

[23:30] Thank you for the support.

[23:31] And we're back behind the paywall.

[23:32] They don't get to hear this.

[23:33] You guys do.

[23:34] Love you guys.

[23:35] Two shows in two days.

[23:36] Who else does that for you?
