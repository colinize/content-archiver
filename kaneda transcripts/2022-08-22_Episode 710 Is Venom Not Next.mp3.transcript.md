[00:00] I wanna dance by a water beneath the Mexican sky, Drink some margaritas by a smooth blue light, Listen to the mariachi play at midnight, Are you with me? Are you with me?

[00:30] Now, is it gonna be like today and tomorrow? Are they gonna give us the teaser this Friday? I know this. I can sense it. Like, you can feel like the calm before the storm. It's about to happen any day now.

[00:44] The question remains, what title is it going to be? And I really don't think anyone knows but the people over at Stern Pinball because I was hanging out this weekend with Chris and Melissa from Cointaker at Jack Bar.

[00:58] I'm here to report to everybody that John and I are on great terms. We hugged it out. He's about to have a new baby any day now and he wasn't gonna let a Godzilla topper topple our great friendship.

[01:13] I had such a good time there. I'm gonna talk a little bit about my conversation with Chris and Melissa who were in town because this weekend in New York City was the big New York City pinball championships.

[01:26] Did you hear it? Did you see it all over the news? Did you hear everybody talking about it? No! In a city as big as the Big Apple, I wanna give them some advice on how they should handle this moving forward.

[01:37] And I didn't go. I didn't disrupt the moment. It's their moment. It's Tim Sexton and Crazy Levy's moment. They had all their tournament players. The best players in the world came through New York City.

[01:49] But I didn't really hear about it. I'm gonna talk about how I would sort of think about running these tournaments. If you really wanna get more conversation and you wanna get more people to participate, you gotta rethink it a little bit.

[02:01] We'll talk about that. But let's start with Stern's next title because, look.

[02:06] From what I'm hearing from everybody is this. So here's what I know. I know what I don't know. We do know that Brian Eddy worked on Venom with Zambietti on artwork.

[02:16] We also know that George Gomez is making James Bond. Most likely a Capow title. Now here's the interesting thing about 2022.

[02:26] I believe it is the 40th anniversary of He-Man this year. It is also the 60th anniversary of James Bond. So you have those two anniversaries happening in 2022.

[02:39] You know, it's also the 50th anniversary of the Godfather. So you would think from a marketing standpoint that these pinball companies would try to sync up a milestone moment with the theme and the launch of the game.

[02:54] But as someone who's been covering pinball for the last like 7, 8 years, these companies always fail horribly at syncing up the release of a pinball machine with an anniversary or milestone for the property.

[03:08] Remember, Alien tried to do it. They failed by like 5 years. Toy Story 4 came out like 3 years ago. Remember when Jack tried to make the Hobbit with the last movie and he missed that by a couple years.

[03:20] So for some reason, it's really hard to sync up your pinball release with a milestone of the theme.

[03:27] Now, if you were to look at this, like and say, okay, there's a James Bond anniversary and a He-Man anniversary.

[03:33] There's really no reason to get Venom out anytime soon because there's no new Venom movie right now.

[03:39] And Venom's a little bit more like of an evergreen release because it's going to be based on the comic book.

[03:45] They're going to make an all original like Venom adventure, if you will.

[03:49] So I don't really know if Venom is something that like needs to come out this year contractually.

[03:55] You know, when Stern signs its deals, they normally are contractually obligated to get the pin out in a certain amount of time.

[04:02] And they also have a window in which they have the license. Now, they could always renew the license.

[04:07] So what is it going to be? Like this is the big question mark. This is the thing everyone is hanging onto.

[04:13] Is it going to be Venom? Is it going to be James Bond? And is it going to be He-Man Masters of the Universe?

[04:19] Now out of those three, I think He-Man is the big question mark.

[04:23] I'm not sure. Like I'm not sure if that's going to be Jack Danger's cornerstone title.

[04:28] We know Jack has been active on social media saying he's a little bit anxious. He's getting nervous.

[04:33] Does that mean his game is next?

[04:35] I mean, Stern's got John Borg, George Gomez, Keith Elwin, Brian Eddy, and Jack Danger all working on pinball machines.

[04:44] Now that's a lot of designers. And they've had six months now to get a lot of games polished and ready to go.

[04:51] Here's what I think is going to happen. I think we're going to see the next game in a week.

[04:55] And I'm hearing from people that are pretty reliable. I'm hearing that the next title is not Venom.

[05:01] Really, really interesting. I think they might move Venom to like Q1 of 2023.

[05:08] And I think we're probably going to see James Bond as the next game.

[05:15] I could be wrong, but that is what I'm hearing from people that are pretty damn reliable.

[05:20] Now, am I excited about James Bond and making like this 60th anniversary of James Bond and bringing James Bond films to life?

[05:28] You know, look, I got to be completely honest. James Bond as a theme, it makes sense for pinball.

[05:35] It hits the pinball demographic, but I am also not really excited about James Bond.

[05:41] I won't be buying one to keep. I might be buying one to flip, but I won't be buying one to keep.

[05:46] It's just not a dream theme for me. There are some of you out there who it is a dream theme for.

[05:52] Now, we will probably see old school James Bond, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, stuff like that.

[05:59] But let me ask all of you a question. How many of you in modern times, how many of you with all of the great content out in the world,

[06:06] all of these great TV shows and new movies, how many of you out there go back and watch old James Bond movies?

[06:15] I'm going to put out a statistic people that's absolutely going to blow your mind.

[06:18] Do you know that 90% of the world's content, right? Content like videos, music, 90% of the content in the world has been made in just the last two years.

[06:32] There's just so much out there. And I don't know, but like I don't go back and watch old movies like James Bond at all.

[06:39] I don't go back and watch old He-Man cartoons at all.

[06:42] I feel like there's almost too much on all of our content plates right now that to go back and watch this stuff is really hard,

[06:49] especially when there's so many James Bond movies. It's not just like one film. It's not just like the first Top Gun.

[06:56] And when you get into like a cartoon series from the 80s, if they do this game, if they do He-Man, I really think they need to have the footage from the original show.

[07:07] I don't think it can be the new Netflix show. That didn't really work. They kind of woke up He-Man. It didn't really work.

[07:13] I hope they don't do what they did with Ninja Turtles. I hope they don't try to like get inspiration from the cartoon show and then reanimate it.

[07:21] Like don't reanimate it. I want to see the clips I grew up with as a kid. I think that was the big miss with like Ninja Turtles.

[07:29] It's like if you're going to do a throwback game to a cartoon series people grew up loving, don't reanimate it.

[07:35] Like if you reanimate it Transformers, it wouldn't work. I think James Bond obviously appeals to the older demographic in Pimbal.

[07:42] I also think He-Man Masters of the Universe is an absolutely incredible theme for Pimbal.

[07:49] If you put Castle Grayskull underneath the glass, you are going to get a lot of really, really giddy people.

[07:57] And just the theme of it like turning Adam into He-Man. I have the power. Are you going to open up the draw bridge on Castle Grayskull?

[08:05] Skeletor, Battle Cat, you know, many faces like all the different personalities in He-Man. I think it's going to be really, really fun.

[08:13] And I think it's perfect for Pimbal. It's very colorful. It's very campy, right?

[08:19] But it's also got a storyline that's really easy to understand like He-Man versus Skeletor.

[08:26] That is something I think a lot of people can get very excited about. And you can see the world of He-Man under glass.

[08:32] You could see the toys in the game. Like you could have many faces where his different faces rotate around and talk to you and do call-outs.

[08:39] Like it's all right there. Like Ram-Man. Like if you don't have a Ram-Man as a pop bumper that pops up and down, like then you're doing something wrong with He-Man.

[08:47] And I think right now, like right now coming out of Toy Story and coming out of a game that doesn't really have many toys in it, I think all eyes are on the next stern machine.

[08:56] I think everyone is looking for there to be like the combination we all want in Pimbal Machines, right?

[09:02] We want a game with great artwork, great code, great flow, but we also need some fun toys.

[09:08] I mean, George Gomez said it the best. He's like every single Pimbal machine should be built around three really satisfying shots.

[09:16] And three toys in the game that create Pimbal moments.

[09:20] You know, when I jumped on Godzilla at Jack Bar this week, and I have to say this, like I don't play Godzilla as much as many of you do.

[09:27] But when I went from Toy Story to Godzilla, it was like going from just an average pin to probably one of the best pins ever.

[09:35] And Godzilla, when you play the game, there is just something about that game that just pulls you in in the first 15 seconds.

[09:43] And it just makes you smile. Like it's just such a good game.

[09:47] The shots are so good. They're so smooth.

[09:50] But it's really about the personality and the campiness of Godzilla that just oozes out of that game.

[09:57] I mean, it comes at you from every single angle.

[10:00] And when you look up at the screen, I just love how the world of Godzilla is just perfectly represented in the game.

[10:07] They like nail the theme integration, just nailed it.

[10:10] And then I go on a Toy Story and it's just not the same.

[10:13] Like they just didn't nail the theme integration.

[10:16] And that's why you really have to play machines.

[10:18] You got to play machines and know you want it before you put your money down.

[10:23] Now let's talk about that for a little bit because I was talking to Chris and Melissa, and they're really good friends.

[10:29] And I love them.

[10:30] And I really think they're going to have an amazing tailgating party September 24th down at Cointaker.

[10:35] And I was talking to them.

[10:36] You know, it's always fun connecting with people like Melissa and Chris because they know more than I do.

[10:40] Like they know more about what's coming out, what's in the pipeline than I do.

[10:45] And Melissa won't tell me.

[10:46] It didn't matter like how many like frozen margaritas I bought them.

[10:50] They wouldn't cave and give me a scoop.

[10:53] But I will say this. I said to her like, is there anything I say on my show that just annoys you as a distributor?

[10:58] And she brought up the one thing that I've been harping on all year.

[11:02] She's like, Chris, you keep telling people like not to buy, not to put down nonrefundable deposits.

[11:09] And the part you keep missing is that nobody is making them do that.

[11:14] Like everyone has a choice on whether or not they want to go in on a game.

[11:18] And look, I totally agree with her on that stance.

[11:21] Like nobody's forcing you to go in on a nonrefundable deposit.

[11:24] But the part I have a big issue with is these companies, when they accept a nonrefundable deposit,

[11:30] they have absolutely no consequences if they blow by their ETA shipment date for you.

[11:37] So if I'm a customer and I enter in on a nonrefundable deposit,

[11:41] I think there should be a date by which I could get my money back if I don't have my game.

[11:47] And that's nowhere in any of the contracts.

[11:50] The only person who put this into the contract was Jerry with multi-morphic.

[11:54] If he misses his estimated ship date by six months, then you can get a refund.

[11:59] Let's face it, it's just been a rough year for nonrefundable deposit people

[12:04] if you bought Spooky's games or if you bought Toy Story 4.

[12:07] Like those were the two games that burned people.

[12:10] Nobody's been really burned on the Big Lebowski because when you order one,

[12:14] Chris and Melissa will tell you it's a year wait.

[12:17] So they're not trying to tell you you're going to have your game in like six months.

[12:21] It's a year from the order date.

[12:23] You know, if you ordered a Haggis, you got kind of screwed.

[12:25] If you ordered a Fathom, you did get screwed.

[12:27] I'm not sure if they're even selling Fathoms, that coin taker, but it's really Spooky Pinball, right?

[12:31] You ordered the game, you didn't get to play it, you didn't get to see it.

[12:35] And then if you know you want to cancel your game, even if your game is like six months away from production,

[12:40] they won't let you cancel the game.

[12:42] So you lost money on your Spooky game.

[12:44] And the same thing with Jersey Jack.

[12:46] I mean, Jersey Jack Pinball, it's just unfortunate.

[12:48] Like if you ordered your Jersey Jack game, you either had to give $1,000 for the LE or 2,500 for the CE.

[12:56] Now, both of those buyers have both lost their money.

[12:59] You can now get an LE for less than a thousand off sticker and you can get a CE for almost 2,000 off sticker.

[13:06] So what do we do as a Pinball community?

[13:08] Here's what we do.

[13:09] I think for the most part, unless it's a dream theme, you know you're going to own, right?

[13:13] You know you're going to own this and bolt it to the floor.

[13:16] I think everyone's going to start to be more patient.

[13:19] I think they're going to take their time.

[13:21] I also think it's going to be a non-conversation as we go into the end of 2022 and into 2023.

[13:28] Because I think Stern is going to clobber everybody.

[13:31] I really do.

[13:32] I think Stern is going to have one of the best like 18 months in the history of Stern Pinball.

[13:38] And they're not going to have non-refundable deposits.

[13:40] Nobody's going to lose money going in on a Stern game.

[13:43] And they're absolutely going to show everybody how it's done.

[13:46] And all the boutiques out there that require non-refundables, I think more and more of us are going to look at those propositions as being a bad proposition for us.

[13:55] Because now there's a much greater likelihood you're going to lose out.

[13:59] There's a much greater likelihood the game's not going to be that great.

[14:02] And there's also just almost like a guarantee.

[14:05] If you wait on those boutique games and don't go in on them early, you'll be able to get one for less than MSRP.

[14:14] See, Stern games hold their value better.

[14:16] You know, Godzilla LEs are still holding strong.

[14:19] You know, I was thinking about this because I still look at Godzilla LE and I still don't like the armor on the game.

[14:25] I wish Godzilla LE just popped a lot more than it does.

[14:30] And I was thinking to myself, Stern's got this juggernaut hit.

[14:34] They've got this amazing game, probably their best game of all time.

[14:38] You could argue it might be their best game of all time.

[14:40] Are you telling me that Stern Pimball is never going to make a special, special edition of Godzilla?

[14:46] They're not going to revisit it at all.

[14:48] They're not going to do like a 40th anniversary like Elvira or Batman SLE.

[14:52] I think Stern Pimball, this is why they're in such a good position right now.

[14:56] Because they have the biggest catalog of games.

[14:59] They have the best catalog of games.

[15:02] Stern could easily on a moment's notice say, hey, we're going to take our top 10 games and you could go down a list.

[15:08] Let's go down the list right now. The top 10 Stern games.

[15:11] Godzilla, Jurassic Park, Iron Maiden, Deadpool, Elvira, Lord of the Rings, Avengers, Stranger Things, AC DC, and Rush.

[15:23] How the heck is Rush over Batman, over Spider-Man, over Tron?

[15:30] Anyway, but those are their top 10 ranked games.

[15:33] Now, Stern Pimball could easily take their top 10 games and say, we're going to do a very special, limited edition like Masterpiece Collection.

[15:44] Like these are our modern masterpieces and we're going to make 250 of each and they're going to be $20,000 each.

[15:53] And they're going to come the most loaded, the most blinged out, beautiful versions of these games we've ever launched.

[16:00] And they would sell every single one easily.

[16:03] You know what I'm saying is like once you know you've got something great, then you can really make money off of it in a variety of ways.

[16:11] But you got to know you have something great first.

[16:14] And this is why Jersey Jack sort of blew themselves up with Toy Story 4.

[16:19] They didn't have something that was worth the price.

[16:22] They didn't have a Masterpiece and they knew it and they priced it like it was some incredible game.

[16:28] Like it was worthy of a price that should have been on games like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[16:32] And so you can't do that, right?

[16:34] You cannot do that.

[16:35] You got to know you have something great.

[16:37] So I think we're going to see Stern Pimball revisit some of their older titles.

[16:41] And look, I didn't even mention games.

[16:42] If you were to go off theme alone, like I still think stuff like Ghostbusters and Tron are in much higher demand than games like Stranger Things.

[16:51] Can you imagine just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine with Canada.

[16:56] If Stern Pimball remade a Ghostbusters special edition, if they close the flipper gap a little bit, how much they could sell it for?

[17:05] It's scary to think how much they could get for the game.

[17:08] Alright, what else is going on in Pimball before I talk about the New York City Pimball Championships?

[17:12] So a little rumor I'm hearing is that Dutch Pimball is working on their game after the big Lebowski.

[17:19] Now it is going to be a game that's going to be another movie property.

[17:22] I am super excited to see what Barry can do over at Dutch Pimball.

[17:26] You know, here's why I'm excited to see what Barry can do.

[17:28] I still think that Barry is one of the best designers who understands how to translate a theme into Pimball.

[17:35] I understand that he has only made one game, but his one game and his one effort is still better than anything Pat Lawler made at Jersey Jack.

[17:47] It's better than anything Brian Eddy made over at Stern Pimball.

[17:51] It's a better world under glass, I would argue, than any single Pimball machine I've seen in the last seven years.

[17:58] Name me one better world under glass than the big Lebowski.

[18:03] You can't, you just can't do it.

[18:05] And so I'm excited that Barry is not done.

[18:08] I heard from Chris and Melissa, they are getting games out.

[18:11] They are going to make it.

[18:12] They are going to make all of the Lebowskis.

[18:15] They are going to make all of the EA's whole.

[18:17] It's been an arduous journey.

[18:20] But you know who's helping Barry out with his next theme?

[18:23] Roger Sharp.

[18:24] So I've been hearing they've been talking to both Warner Brothers and Paramount about a movie property.

[18:32] I don't know what it is.

[18:34] There's a lot of movies to guess from if that's the hint, you know, and it's going to happen one day.

[18:39] Now, is it going to happen one day soon?

[18:41] I don't know.

[18:42] It probably will be a couple of years from now.

[18:45] See, I think Barry needs to go the route that I've been trying to tell JJP to go.

[18:50] Just say you're only making a thousand and charge freakin 15k, 20k and just call it a day.

[18:57] Load the damn pin up and watch everyone sell out.

[19:01] Just load it up, you know, get all the assets, get all the toys in it and only make a thousand and don't overload your manufacturing and then just make one game every two years and be the Bugatti and Rolls Royce of Pinball.

[19:14] Everyone's afraid to do it.

[19:15] Everyone's always trying to compete with volume.

[19:17] Everyone's trying to put these high end games on location.

[19:20] It's a big mistake and it hasn't worked out well for anyone.

[19:23] All right, so we will see Dutch Pinball two years from now.

[19:26] Keep checking out, you know, a Canadian Spinball podcast will be on episode like 909 when we see the next Dutch Pinball game, but I'm rooting for Barry.

[19:33] I am rooting for him to get it done.

[19:34] Okay, let's end the show real quickly.

[19:36] The New York City Pinball Championships happened in New York City over the weekend.

[19:40] I think Ray Day won it by 10 points.

[19:43] There's a leaderboard.

[19:44] I was just going off of that person foremost.

[19:46] I want to say, look, it was really cool that all these players from around the world came into New York City for the New York City Pinball Championships.

[19:54] Now, here's the thing.

[19:56] Here's the thing.

[19:57] And I know Levy and I know Tim Sexton run this entire thing, but I do think they have to figure out a way to make it more interesting and more exciting.

[20:06] I was talking to Levy two years ago.

[20:07] Here's the main thing.

[20:09] If you're going to have a pinball tournament and you want to get people excited about a tournament, what is the number one thing that a tournament should communicate to everybody else out in the world?

[20:22] What's at stake?

[20:24] Right?

[20:25] What is this for?

[20:26] Like how much money is someone winning in this tournament?

[20:29] I read the press releases they put out.

[20:31] I still don't know what was at stake.

[20:33] I still don't know what the prize money was.

[20:35] I still don't know what the champion got.

[20:38] So you don't even have that.

[20:39] They didn't communicate what was at stake.

[20:42] And when you read the press release, like I get it, like they're so excited that it's back on after COVID.

[20:48] They're also very excited about the venue in Brooklyn.

[20:51] But when I read it all, I'm like, all right, it's like, it's more about promoting the fact that we're in a nicer venue and COVID is over.

[20:58] But there will be no reason otherwise to really be like, let's go.

[21:02] But I still think they need to figure out a way to make this thing more of a spectator sport.

[21:07] Now I saw today they put up a video of the pinball championships.

[21:11] Guess how long the video is?

[21:13] 10 hours long.

[21:15] 10 hours long.

[21:18] You just can't get people into it.

[21:20] And then they had seminars.

[21:22] They had podcasters there.

[21:23] Of course, Canada was not invited.

[21:25] Canada, the ultimate hype man in pinball, completely ignored by all this stuff.

[21:29] But they could use my help.

[21:31] They really could.

[21:32] And they could also start to think about this a little bit differently.

[21:35] And I do agree that these laborious 10 hours of qualifying, like beautiful weather in August in New York City and everyone is inside for so many hours playing pinball.

[21:46] See, I just think you need to do it differently.

[21:48] I do.

[21:49] I think it's more fun when it's like single elimination.

[21:52] I think it's more fun when it's heads up.

[21:54] I think it's more fun when it's timed.

[21:56] All of that stuff just makes pinball more fun.

[21:59] But ultimately, look, this is how they want to run this stuff.

[22:02] This is how some of these tournament players enjoy their tournaments.

[22:05] I just think pinball is almost never going to be a really good spectator sport.

[22:10] It's not.

[22:11] It's just not that fun to watch for the casual observer.

[22:14] It's just not there.

[22:16] And if you want to get people excited about it, look, it's hard, right?

[22:19] In New York City, it's hard to do stuff.

[22:21] It's hard to put the machines out.

[22:23] You know, pinball is just always going to be very niche.

[22:25] Like it is going to be very niche.

[22:27] Like when they say, like, oh, there's pinball in 35 bars in New York City.

[22:31] That's nothing.

[22:32] There's like 10,000 bars in New York City, right?

[22:35] So it's still a very small niche community.

[22:38] Look, I think pinball is thriving for the people that want it to thrive.

[22:42] I think pinball is doing just fine with the people that care.

[22:45] Most people just don't care.

[22:47] Most people walk up to a modern pinball machine.

[22:49] They have no idea what to do.

[22:51] These games just don't work for casual people.

[22:54] And again, remember what I said 90% of the content has been created in the last two years.

[22:59] Video games are more fun for most people.

[23:02] Watching Netflix is more fun for most people.

[23:04] If people have free time, the majority of people aren't saying to themselves,

[23:08] let's go play some pinball.

[23:10] And I guarantee you the majority of people are not saying to themselves,

[23:13] let's go buy a pinball machine today and spend like $6,000 to $15,000.

[23:18] We didn't think we were going to spend on a pinball machine.

[23:21] You know, it's just watching the Netflix comedy movie.

[23:24] I didn't finish it yet.

[23:25] The bubble.

[23:26] At the beginning scene, there's a fishtails pinball machine.

[23:29] And I'm like, this is going to do more for getting people excited about pinball

[23:33] than any pinball tournament could ever do.

[23:36] You just reach a broader audience and it's right there.

[23:39] See, to me, product placement is the way to go.

[23:41] The way The Wizard of Oz was in Ted Lasso.

[23:44] If you really want to get more people into pinball,

[23:46] it's all about placing it in content that people love.

[23:50] The only problem is this.

[23:52] If you get too many people into it,

[23:54] the price is going to keep soaring and soaring and soaring.

[23:57] And I think a lot of us sort of like missed the good old days

[24:00] when it was a lot more niche and it wasn't so hard to get every new game.

[24:05] And we weren't paying ridiculous prices for an LE or a collector's edition.

[24:09] And it was like super simple to get on your distros list for one of Stern's 500 LEs.

[24:15] And it was no hassle.

[24:17] How many of you out there for years you could pay below MSRP for your LE?

[24:22] You know, enjoy the game, flip it a year later, make a few bucks.

[24:25] And it wasn't crazy.

[24:27] Like you weren't buying a game for $7,500 and then listing it next year for $15,000 like people are doing now.

[24:33] The entire market is still stupid. It's absolutely stupid.

[24:36] Now speaking of stupid, let me just end this show by saying this.

[24:39] I think a lot of people out there are waiting forever for Stern to get out.

[24:43] It's expression lighting and it's toppers.

[24:46] Now a lot of you guys out there that bought Rush Pinball and you bought the premiums,

[24:51] you were told you would be able to have the expression lighting system available like pretty close to buying the machine.

[24:57] It's been eight months now since Rush has been out and Stern still won't allow these buyers to enjoy the game the way it's supposed to be enjoyed.

[25:07] Why is it taking Stern so long to just release lights?

[25:11] Like it's just a lighting kit.

[25:13] Is there a supply shortage on lights?

[25:15] And don't even get me started on the toppers.

[25:17] The time the Mandalorian topper comes out, I don't know, like half of us are going to pass away.

[25:21] It's just crazy, like the amount of revenue and just its own accessories Stern is leaving on the table.

[25:28] I don't understand why the topper department and the pinball making department can't just sync up.

[25:35] Why is it taking so long to make toppers?

[25:37] Stern, come on, get these toppers released.

[25:40] Which games need toppers like Rush Pinball, right?

[25:43] Godzilla needs a topper.

[25:45] And what about like Mandalorian?

[25:47] How do you have the Led Zeppelin topper came out, but the Mandalorian one still is not out.

[25:51] Anyway, everybody, thank you for tuning in to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[25:54] I hope we get a new game this week.

[25:56] I can't wait to talk about a new game from Stern Pinball.

[25:59] And I do think if this game is loaded with toys, it's going to be a rough week for you Jersey Jack buyers.

[26:07] Because if this game is something that looks like it's got more in it, you're really going to have a hard time writing a check for 12 to $15,000 for your Toy Story 4.

[26:17] Everybody, be good. I'll talk to you soon.
