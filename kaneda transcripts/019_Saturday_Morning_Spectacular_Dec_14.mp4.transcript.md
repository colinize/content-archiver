[01:23] Um

[01:32] Let's get the audacity going

[01:39] I don't even know what I'm doing here

[01:41] Dacity skip

[01:43] Skip okay

[01:46] Sound looks okay

[01:49] Everybody welcome to the Saturday morning spectacular

[01:52] Omni or host canada how we doing we've got 18 people. They're slowly gonna trickle in

[01:58] Interesting weekend pinball. I'm coming at you live Saturday morning lover boy canada in the garage

[02:04] I got the Toyota parked outside. We got the neo-geos in the background. We got fifth element dream theme everybody

[02:13] How's everybody doing

[02:15] We're seeing pinball machines for sale

[02:18] We're seeing manufacturers try to pace out when they're gonna reveal their stuff

[02:23] We've got some news about stern about spike three

[02:27] Jersey Jack is fire sailing its own product. What is that mean?

[02:32] American pinballs leader is now trying to win over some sympathy

[02:38] We'll talk a little bit about that not a lot about that Steve Boundon is now unemployed

[02:44] I don't think Steve Boundon has ever really contributed a single thing to a pinball machine that's hit the market

[02:53] And what would we have done without them the same thing we've done with him

[02:57] Enjoy pinball for a really long time

[03:01] Alright everybody how's everybody doing? We got 24 on deck. What does that mean? Get him in here

[03:09] Get him in here Ross. You know where's Ross?

[03:13] You know it's crazy about Ross everybody is Melvin over at DPX has the entire game

[03:19] He has all of it right now just ready to go. I keep telling Melvin

[03:25] I'm like dude you got to make it like

[03:28] Exactly the way deep rude had it like in that cabinet that all that weirdness is part of it if you put it in a Dutch cabinet

[03:36] It doesn't work if you put magic girl in a Dutch cabinet. It also doesn't work. You got to go weird

[03:41] I mean it is the whole reason why John Papaduke got people to sort of you know buy into his whole

[03:49] Zidware madness is that it looks so different and when you see a magic girl

[03:54] The cabinet is longer than a normal cabinet the glass is longer

[03:59] That big screen under the glass all that stuff

[04:02] It just is what made it unique and I think if you remove all that

[04:06] Yes sort of then just become another pinball machine and I think you know Alice suffers a little bit from that

[04:12] It just doesn't

[04:13] Look like nothing you've ever seen before

[04:17] It looks like everything else we've been seeing in pinball and then it doesn't you know have

[04:22] Sort of that J-pop weirdness going on and I hope Melvin codes more weirdness into the game

[04:28] Because as it stands right now it needs more of it. It just needs more weird wacky stuff going on

[04:34] How do I sound everybody how you guys doing?

[04:37] You've been a fan since 93 oh

[04:41] Fans since I guess Canadian fan is that what do you mean? I don't know. I don't know how many we've got you know

[04:47] We've got look I'll say this. I want to thank those of you out there who have gifted

[04:51] Canada Spinball podcast as a holiday gift

[04:55] So some of your pinball friends now look I'm just speaking to like 50 of you 60 of you maybe and maybe 65

[05:03] If if like we can get 65 of the

[05:07] 735

[05:09] Canada subscribers or 700 and whatever 27 were at

[05:13] To give the gift of canada Spinball podcasts. We will hit 800

[05:18] By the end of the year which I think would be great and look it's only $60

[05:23] I can't even tell you I just bought

[05:26] What did I buy today? I don't know I bought like some totally for killian under bucks some decals for some truck

[05:33] I'm gonna give him another 40 bucks. It's just you might as well just take your money out of your wallet and

[05:39] Light it on fire. Oh man

[05:42] So where are we gonna start this weekend on canada Saturday morning spectacular?

[05:47] Hold on one second. Let me get let me get a simple water here. I'm a little I'm still coughing up the store

[05:54] Hmm so

[05:56] You know, I believe it was a week ago. I was over at automated and we saw all those games at automated

[06:05] We have to talk about that

[06:06] I think what that did and I got a lot of messages from people that are we're like basically

[06:12] I'm glad you showed us that tour of automated

[06:16] The whole stockpiling of games has been something that we've been here

[06:22] Like we heard as rumor all these years and

[06:25] Trust me everybody. That's just one distro

[06:28] And if you go across the

[06:31] hundreds of dealers and I don't know there's probably like a hundred distros even more dealers

[06:37] When you think about I don't know if there's a hundred distros

[06:40] There might be like 20 or 30 like key distros

[06:43] When you think about

[06:45] Everybody's got inventory everybody like there is nobody who is not sitting on a lot of pinball inventory

[06:52] Right now and when you start to think about what that means for this hobby. Let's talk about it right now

[06:58] It's absolutely a red flag that pinball

[07:03] The demand for it at these prices

[07:07] is declining

[07:10] Every month every year

[07:12] We are going to see a decline in the amount of people that get into the pinball hobby not an increase and

[07:20] I really think when you take a step back gang

[07:25] and it basically

[07:28] A stern premium being $9,500

[07:33] Is kind of just like ludicrous a

[07:36] Game that they'll make an unlimited amount of

[07:41] $9,500 if you want the full featured

[07:45] Stern pinball machine

[07:47] Okay, so you got that that that's silly and stupid then

[07:52] You go to Jersey Jack and if you want to get their full featured entry level machine

[07:57] It's $12,000 for a game that you know like avatar L.E.s are gonna be worth eight grand

[08:06] by

[08:08] Easily by the middle of 2025 so you're gonna lose $4,000 and so we have to talk about

[08:15] This guns and roses

[08:18] $2,025 off on a guns and roses L.E. now the problem with this sale a

[08:26] Few things to talk about here. We don't normally see manufacturers put their own product on sale

[08:32] If you look at that just as a move by a manufacturer

[08:37] This significance of what that's telegraphing is simple

[08:41] We've got more games than people want

[08:45] We made too many of these games and that's just Jersey Jack

[08:51] Putting those games on sale with their inventory. I know Mike over it automated has over 50 GNR L.E.s in a box

[09:00] Probably any distributor out there has GNR L.E.s in a box and

[09:05] The issue is is at what is it now like

[09:11] $8,999 or whatever it is $888

[09:16] $985 the market price for a guns and roses L.E. with

[09:22] Probably just a few hundred plays

[09:24] You know in mint condition with all the washers underneath the play field

[09:30] You're looking at $6,500 and you absolutely might be able to get one for

[09:37] $6,000 on the table

[09:39] So they are still almost

[09:42] $3,000 off on what you could get a GNR L.E. for

[09:48] And so then think about it like this the

[09:53] Normal asking price that Jersey Jack wants for a GNR L.E. is $11,000

[09:58] The market street price of the game is almost $5,000 less than that

[10:06] That is a terrible place to be

[10:11] Avatar's are not going to hold any value Godfather's hell no value

[10:15] Elton John is holding value for a few reasons. It's their best shooting game ever and

[10:21] They didn't make many Elton John's but let's be honest

[10:25] They did not make a that was an Elton John C.E.s. They absolutely did not

[10:31] And I think Elton John is

[10:34] It I'll just say this Elton John is a stern machine

[10:38] Released by Jersey Jack Pimball. It is it's a stern machine. They finally made a game that shoots like a stern

[10:46] That has code that's easy to understand like a stern

[10:50] That doesn't overwhelm you with multi balls like a stern

[10:53] That has that beautiful buttery Steve Richie flow like a stern machine and that is why Elton John is holding

[11:01] It's not a theme most people want it

[11:04] But it's it's it's it's still the most fun Pimball

[11:09] Experience you can have

[11:12] On a Jersey Jack game from a gameplay standpoint. There's nothing else in the JJP portfolio

[11:19] That comes close to shooting as well

[11:22] As as Elton John now look when Harry Potter comes out and Steve Richie's matrix comes out

[11:29] Absolutely expect Elton John prices deployment. Okay

[11:33] So we've got like all this stuff pile enough, right? We've got

[11:38] Game after game after game

[11:41] Distros sitting on premiums and pros galore because they have to buy in bulk if they want to secure their stern allotments

[11:48] Stern has kind of screwed over their long long time dealers and distros by adding so many new dealers

[11:57] So everyone's getting less Ellie's than they used to

[12:01] And it's getting really really difficult so Kelly Daniel just said it's getting harder to sell use games

[12:07] Absolutely Kelly

[12:09] Because people are just at a room too

[12:12] So if you look at the forces that are the the macro forces that are hitting this hobby

[12:18] I would say on the market forces are

[12:22] Games are too expensive

[12:24] especially in a inflationary world

[12:27] You kind of want to keep your money in appreciating assets

[12:30] So you want to have your money in some crypto right now in some Netflix and some meta in the smp 500

[12:37] You want to invest in technologies

[12:40] You know and Pimball machines used to be and everybody needs to remember this it's not that we saw Pimball machines

[12:46] First and foremost as an investment

[12:48] But it used to be a place where you could invest your money in it

[12:53] Have your phone and not lose much and that was the justification for so many of us as to why we would keep buying new inbox

[13:02] And I think that's an important point. I don't think Pimball trading is gonna go away. I don't think

[13:08] Your desire to get more machines into your game room is gonna change

[13:13] But the desire to buy new inbox because it's a good buy because you're not gonna lose much is over like you're absolutely

[13:20] Now a moronic move if you buy new inbox unless it's a super rare le okay, so I got a question here

[13:27] From my boys is Jaguar. Do you know what stern's next Pimball machine will be for next year? So

[13:34] We'll get to that. It's either dungeons and dragons or king Kong

[13:37] I have a confirmation of when we're gonna see the game

[13:42] So that's gonna be real soon people we're talking less than three weeks. You will see the new game from stern Pimball

[13:48] So again like why buy anything right now? I think buying anything right now is really a suckers move and don't be a sucker. You're too smart

[13:58] I don't think it's gonna be hard to get anything and so you know

[14:01] We've got all these games piling up the prices the macro forces people are not

[14:07] Uh, they're not into these prices and they're at a room and I think the other macro forces for each and every one of you right now

[14:15] You all have great games already and that's it like it's least so weird to me. I've always said this

[14:19] It's so weird to me if you have so many great games already

[14:24] That you enjoy day in and day out

[14:27] Why would you wake up and feel like you need another game?

[14:31] Uh, and I bet for most of you out there you have not ever seen

[14:36] the end of most of your games

[14:39] if you have you haven't seen it in a while and

[14:43] I think the stuff you have

[14:46] Would bring you enjoyment

[14:48] For now until kingdom come

[14:51] If you just adjusted your mindset a little bit and enjoyed the new stuff

[14:55] On location and only bought something new

[14:59] If it absolutely checked all the boxes for you like a dream theme done right execute it right

[15:06] Uh, and I think a lot of people are there. I think a lot of people are there and I think

[15:11] You know evil dead hasn't sold out

[15:14] Look at all that spooky put into that game the reason evil dead is not sold out is because of the theme

[15:19] It's if that was any other theme with a little bit more mainstream appeal

[15:24] They easily would assault 888 of them by now easily easily. I mean it I look every time I watch the stream

[15:32] I get more and more

[15:34] Excited by the passion and I get more and more deflated by the theme because

[15:40] I just don't care about those movies at all like at all like I don't want to watch them

[15:47] If someone was like hey christ you want to come over and have some lewittray

[15:52] And watch evil dead. I'd be like you know even though you put lewittray on the table. I'm not coming over

[15:57] But if they said let's come over and watch die hard. Yes Christmas vacation. Yes

[16:02] Blood sport. Yes fifth element. Yes total recall predator karate kid top gun

[16:09] You know, I just keep going breakfast club bears bueller's I just keep going keep going keep going

[16:15] All of them would sell much better than evil dead

[16:18] So it but again, I'm happy that evil dead lovers get a great game

[16:24] It's just not for me

[16:26] So look something's gonna give

[16:29] Jersey jack fire selling their games is just the beginning

[16:33] Stern is gonna have to do the same thing you know when I walk through Mike's

[16:37] warehouse

[16:38] Stern's gonna have to put

[16:40] So many of their pros and premiums on sale

[16:43] The they because here's a crazy part

[16:46] Is the distros and the dealers are at a room?

[16:49] They're out of space

[16:52] People forget like stirring kept cranking out more like alvira's more this more that they were making games

[16:59] Few months someone's been taking them. I absolutely

[17:03] I absolutely think there is a warehouse in Chicago with thousands of games on sold new inbox

[17:09] thousands of games new install in boxes

[17:12] And you know map pricing is done. Let's just be honest people the map pricing

[17:18] Model of pinball is over. It's over. So get ready to kiss it goodbye

[17:25] The old world of how Stern has seen

[17:29] It's customers as the distros and not you and me is over

[17:34] You know, I'm gonna say this I everything we said was off the record for the most part

[17:39] For the most part I had a really good conversation with Seth Davis. He's a really good guy

[17:44] I mean is when I say this Seth is a really good guy and he really cares

[17:47] And he's trying to get it right and for people that insult him and they're like okay you have a lot easier

[17:52] You know, it's armchair quarterback from the internet

[17:55] All the market forces that are impacting his business now look. I'm very candid with Seth

[18:00] I'm like you guys you guys

[18:02] picked horrible themes recently

[18:04] Like what is jody doing?

[18:06] You focus grouped all wrong you should be embarrassed that you didn't get back to the future

[18:10] I'm very candid with him. I tell him the prices are too high

[18:13] I tell him there's too many LEDs

[18:16] and you know, I tell him that the problem with the LEDs today

[18:20] And is is that you didn't make them special

[18:23] And if you want to make a thousand and you want to sell a thousand LEDs

[18:28] then you have to

[18:30] Really start giving customers more value and by value. I'm very clear with him

[18:36] exclusive topper for Elise

[18:39] You need that right if only if you like look at the exclusive topper is done for Batman

[18:45] You need an exclusive topper

[18:48] You need some exclusive modes that are only available in the early version of the game

[18:55] It it needs to be done this you just can't

[18:59] Have only decals and artwork and stuff that's easily upgradable you need stuff that's exclusive

[19:08] To justify

[19:10] That almost four thousand dollar premium

[19:14] For the game four thousand dollars

[19:18] Right, so you know, I just think like you need to start thinking about this stuff and believe me

[19:23] He is thinking about this stuff. He is like trying to get this stuff right he he he he walked into a company believe me

[19:30] He walked into a company

[19:33] Um, you know James Bond 60 it's like I don't think that was his idea, you know, I really don't I think

[19:38] Some people made those decisions. It wasn't his decision. I think they've learned a harsh lesson

[19:44] Less shone lesson with that

[19:47] They learned a harsh

[19:49] Ah, can't talk today a harsh lesson

[19:52] With re running Jurassic Park Ellie

[19:55] Re running Elvirus again. I think all of this stuff just like I think that was more Gomez

[20:00] I do I think they needed to like because again because remember when stern was doing those moves more Jurassic Park

[20:06] Elise more Elvirus more this more that you know why they were doing that is because they still saw their customers

[20:14] As the distributors

[20:16] So the number one shift that sssseth really understands the need to make because you got to remember

[20:23] This is institutional knowledge institutional behavior he needs to break the number one behavioral shifts

[20:30] Turned him all needs to make

[20:32] Is they need to realize that their customers are not the distros

[20:38] Their customers are not the operators

[20:41] Their customers first and foremost at the top of the pyramid are the new inbox home buyers

[20:49] So everything they do needs to be in servitude to the new inbox home buyers and he needs a marketing department that understands that

[21:02] I don't think Zack Sharp understands that

[21:05] Everything Zack Sharp does has he done anything for the home collector or the home buyer

[21:10] No has jody no has Jared no I don't even know what Jared's doing anymore other than continuing to flood

[21:19] Facebook with inappropriate photos

[21:21] You know what I'm saying like I don't know that their marketing department

[21:25] Is not focused on the primary target and and he gets it

[21:29] And he gets it and I'm telling you folks ladies

[21:31] I'm gonna be honest ladies and gentlemen like one day

[21:34] I would love to help stern pinball figure that part out

[21:37] You know over a decade I've been studying this industry. I have 30 years almost of public relations marketing experience

[21:44] And I would love

[21:46] Because I could think about it if there was one pinball company that I would love to help them understand how to market to the audience in the right way

[21:54] It would be stern

[21:56] And I know like

[21:57] That would probably make me maybe not be able to do my podcast

[22:01] But in the end I've sort of achieved everything I could ever achieve here

[22:05] So it would be fun to actually make real and tangible changes over at a company that all of you would benefit from

[22:12] And again because it takes the right mindset and it takes the right understanding of how to reach the right audiences

[22:20] And one thing I said to them and they're they've adopted it is I went to them and I said hey look

[22:25] I know you guys want to grow your company

[22:28] But the number one way you're going to grow your company is not what you've been doing

[22:32] It is not this like let's include all these young people into the future of pinball

[22:38] And that's how we're going to grow let's do focus groups with young people and see what themes they want

[22:43] The number one way you're going to grow your business set in George and I was with Gary

[22:48] All you need to do is get everybody that loves pinball right now. Don't be ashamed of who they are

[22:54] Don't have your stern merchandise shop look radically different than who your target audience is

[23:00] And it does right now

[23:02] Don't pretend you're something you're not

[23:05] In brace who you are

[23:07] Love the folks that love you

[23:09] And just if you can get each one of your current customers to invite a new friend into stern pinball and into the hobby

[23:18] You will double your business

[23:21] It's not going to happen overnight

[23:22] But if you go the other route and you start doing all this d e i looking stuff

[23:28] And you start having you know zack sharp focus all on tournament players and like this new stern cup

[23:35] Badges and inner you know insider connect like all this stuff

[23:40] Is not where they need to be applying effort and it's again because shark because zack is again like a zack

[23:46] A smart guy, but he's like he's building programs for like

[23:53] tournament players and

[23:55] And look absolutely like zack needs a counter part that understands what a home collector wants

[24:04] He needs someone to help him there, right? And they need to start getting

[24:09] earned media in

[24:11] Vertical media outlets that introduce new audiences to pinball and it's not casco

[24:17] Right, it's not it's not casco like it's it's not it's not

[24:21] You know trying to make a cheap version of your product and bringing it to a wholesale retail location where nobody goes in there

[24:29] And and just impulse buys like a five or six thousand dollar item

[24:34] So I really do think

[24:36] I really do think there is a

[24:39] opportunity

[24:40] for this company to

[24:43] Finally wake up and and reach their target audience, you know in the right way and

[24:50] You know just just so you know like I would love to have that opportunity one day to help them do that

[24:54] I know I come with a lot of baggage. I know I know it'd be like it like he said to be like an organ transplant

[24:59] You know try to put canada into the system there, but it is what it is but um

[25:04] But you know the thing is this let's talk about it. So let's talk about where we're at here

[25:09] um

[25:10] Like the referral program. I know you guys have seen

[25:13] This referral program. I know vick got a couple games first. I'll fix a great guy. I'm glad. I got a couple games

[25:18] Um, I don't it they're not really doing it, you know

[25:21] I think vick told me I saw him and automated that like he talked to Zach about it

[25:26] Uh sharp and then you know is it it's that sharp right who's at Sir Natcha. I always get him confused. Who's where um

[25:33] The thing is is that

[25:35] What's what's up, franchie welcome to the party? We haven't even got to really uh anything spooky yet

[25:40] We'll talk about the franchie interview too if you want chris now that you're here

[25:44] Uh, the the the thing is

[25:47] You know the loner program isn't really a thing. I think vick was working with them for a period of months

[25:55] I think they sent them a couple games, but it's not like they're sliding anybody. I don't know anyone else who got any machines

[26:03] But what does make sense?

[26:06] What does make sense is for these large companies

[26:10] To get pinball content creators a way to

[26:15] Engage with the product review the product

[26:18] And give their feedback on the product. Here's my here's my issue though because I really am again when I was talking to Seth

[26:24] They're gonna invite media in for the new game probably, you know into Chicago

[26:31] Uh, before they you know unveil this thing probably at ces. I mean, that's a good guess right?

[26:36] I mean stern tends to unveil their games at ces. They've done it multiple times

[26:42] It is sort of like their tent pole moment in the industry

[26:47] Is to bring a new game at ces. So you're gonna see a new game and ces is is January 7th

[26:53] So just do the math like you're gonna see a new stern machine in the next three weeks

[27:01] So whether it's gonna be dnd or kinkong

[27:05] You're absolutely gonna have another stern option

[27:10] And so

[27:12] You know

[27:13] What sturns most likely gonna do is invite people in to Chicago

[27:17] See the game here from the team

[27:20] Uh and play the game the problem I have is like

[27:23] uh

[27:24] You can't really

[27:27] Get a true feel for a game

[27:30] In that fashion and and I don't mean to be uh arrogant

[27:34] Can I be a little bit arrogant mr. franchi? Can I can I turn on my Sicilian hat my lover boy cat

[27:42] I'm not just any pinball content creator though. I mean, I have a larger audience than most

[27:49] And not only that is my audience

[27:52] Our new inbox buyers

[27:54] They are like you know you're not gonna listen to me if you're a tournament player if if you're an operator

[27:58] The only reason john from jack bar listens to me is because he has to because he lost the bet about their being a fourth

[28:04] James Bond game

[28:06] But my audience is exactly exactly

[28:11] The audience stern wants to get excited for a new inbox. I see this little man. What's up brother?

[28:18] Oh copy

[28:19] Thank you. Can you want to say hi? Can I lift you up? Yeah, just real quick

[28:24] Why do I have two skateboards? Can you grab me that one?

[28:28] Yeah, can you bring it to me?

[28:30] Because I want to show everybody

[28:32] No, no, don't skate. Don't skate

[28:36] Yeah, show us how you do it

[28:42] All right hold on a second here people we're gonna hold

[28:45] I see what's going on here

[28:52] Okay, I'm gonna hold you ready ready

[29:02] Nobody

[29:04] No

[29:10] I wanted to learn a lot a lot

[29:16] Oh

[29:19] I

[29:22] Now, the the

[29:32] There you go.

[29:33] For dad.

[29:34] For six fours.

[29:35] All right, but I'm going to give my show mom.

[29:37] No, no, no, no, no.

[29:38] Okay, how about this?

[29:39] So daddy, do dad and I.

[29:40] Yeah.

[29:41] There you go.

[29:42] Okay.

[29:43] Awesome.

[29:44] We'll do a later, right, buddy?

[29:45] High five.

[29:46] Daddy, just this one.

[29:47] No, that one doesn't.

[29:48] You have different wheels.

[29:49] See?

[29:50] High five.

[29:51] Thank you.

[29:52] Thank you.

[29:53] Mommy for the coffee.

[29:54] Okay, buddy.

[29:56] You have different wheels.

[29:57] See?

[29:58] High five.

[29:59] Thank you.

[30:00] Mommy for the coffee.

[30:01] Okay, buddy.

[30:02] Kill him.

[30:05] Okay.

[30:06] The.

[30:08] Mama.

[30:10] Sometimes you just need.

[30:18] Sorry about that.

[30:19] You know, sometimes you just have to take a parenting break.

[30:24] I know, I know.

[30:25] First of all, I want to say thank you to Frank.

[30:30] For getting me another Canadian board.

[30:34] Which is just so awesome.

[30:36] He gave it to me.

[30:37] Automated as a holiday gift.

[30:40] His son puts these together.

[30:43] All right, so.

[30:45] My point was.

[30:48] I think Stern should get me some games.

[30:50] I think.

[30:52] I think Canadian getting a loner game.

[30:55] For a few weeks is what I want.

[30:57] What I don't want to do.

[30:59] What I don't want to do is just be like shuffled through Stern.

[31:04] With all the content creators at once.

[31:08] And you know, just like it.

[31:10] These like fanboy experiences.

[31:13] It's just I don't want to do it.

[31:15] I know it's not really my thing.

[31:18] And I mean it when I say this that.

[31:21] I don't know.

[31:22] I just kind of roll a little bit more independent sometimes.

[31:25] And when I when I because I want to really.

[31:28] And I mean this when I say this.

[31:30] I really want to sit down.

[31:33] And ask tough questions.

[31:36] Of the companies and the designers.

[31:38] And really.

[31:39] You know, like get some valuable info.

[31:44] And some meaningful responses.

[31:46] And it's just like you can't really do that.

[31:49] If you want to do it.

[31:50] Yeah.

[31:51] So you know, I want to do this.

[31:52] In these larger group settings.

[31:53] It just doesn't happen.

[31:54] Now, of course.

[31:55] If I went to Stern.

[31:56] It would be really easy, you know, for George.

[31:59] And whoever designed the new game to carve out some one-on-one time.

[32:03] And maybe I'll do that.

[32:04] Like, but if they invite me.

[32:05] I'll go.

[32:06] I mean, absolutely.

[32:09] I mean, I absolutely would never look.

[32:11] A gift horse in the mouth.

[32:12] And I'm honored.

[32:13] I didn't invite me last time.

[32:16] the John Wick, Boondoggle.

[32:19] But, you know, I think it goes without saying

[32:21] that when you invite me to go tour your factory

[32:26] and see your new game, you're not buying a positive review.

[32:30] Do I wanna give a positive review?

[32:32] Yes, do I wanna be blown away?

[32:33] Yes.

[32:34] And from what Seth has told me,

[32:36] the next two games are gonna be a real increase

[32:38] in creativity.

[32:40] And I think that's exciting to hear.

[32:43] I really do.

[32:44] I think that's very exciting to hear.

[32:45] Especially post X-Men,

[32:47] which was a very creative layout and design.

[32:50] And to know that they're pushing the creativity further.

[32:53] And the one thing that I think everybody,

[32:56] you know, it was the topic of my last show,

[32:59] is that Spike 3 is not what anybody thinks it's gonna be.

[33:04] Like, you got, like, I think the best way

[33:06] to think about Spike 3 gang is to think about

[33:09] the difference between Spike 1 and Spike 2, right?

[33:13] Do you remember what the big difference was?

[33:15] Did you feel the big difference?

[33:18] Was it like, did they launch Spike 2

[33:20] in a monumental way with a new game?

[33:24] No, it was like no boards.

[33:26] And it was like different power supply.

[33:29] And they use Spike as a terminology

[33:35] for their processing, not for their platform.

[33:39] So I really do encourage everybody

[33:42] to sort of let go of this notion

[33:46] that Spike 3 is gonna have this mask.

[33:50] No, Spike 1.

[33:53] Didn't Spike 1 have an LCD screen?

[33:56] Was Spike 1 DMD only?

[33:58] Okay.

[33:59] I forget.

[34:00] Yeah, I guess Ghostbusters was Spike 1.

[34:02] Okay.

[34:03] So, okay.

[34:05] Now, I think what's gonna happen was Spike 3.

[34:08] I think we're gonna get a better screen.

[34:12] I don't think we're gonna get a bigger screen.

[34:15] I think it's gonna go to 4K,

[34:18] which is completely unnecessary on a screen that size.

[34:23] It's like absolutely pointless to put a 4K monitor.

[34:28] But, you know, I guess when they're showing 4K movie clips,

[34:32] it'll make everything look nicer.

[34:33] But they'll have a lot more processing power.

[34:36] I expect the internet connectivity to be improved upon,

[34:39] the lighting to be improved upon.

[34:41] And the ability for the power and the boards

[34:45] to drive more creativity above the play fields.

[34:50] But again, I just don't, and, you know, in talking to Seth,

[34:53] I think you might see more of a gradual rolling out

[34:58] of Spike 3 components over 2025 versus,

[35:04] all right, here's King Kong

[35:05] and all the big changes are in it.

[35:07] That's not gonna happen.

[35:10] That's not gonna happen.

[35:11] So I definitely, you know, think there's gonna be changes.

[35:16] I think they're gonna be for the better.

[35:18] And I think we all are hoping and praying

[35:22] that none of those changes come with a price increase.

[35:25] I just, I just like that's it.

[35:27] Like, but then, you know, Mr. Gomez has just said,

[35:32] hey, it's been three years since we increased prices.

[35:35] Yeah, George, because you took them to the moon, brother.

[35:38] You took them to the moon, you know,

[35:40] and I don't know if there's anywhere to go.

[35:42] That's further than that until you hit Mars

[35:45] and you can't go much further than where they have the pricing now.

[35:49] I think if Stern increases prices,

[35:50] there's gonna be an absolute revolt, an absolute revolt.

[35:55] Because you can't raise prices as like everything else

[35:58] is just plummeting and value.

[35:59] It just, it doesn't add up.

[36:05] It's good having, Francie here.

[36:06] Francie, once again, man, congratulations on crushing it

[36:08] on the evil dead art.

[36:11] And, you know, the George Gomez interview is good.

[36:14] I just, for the record, it was nice to hear Gomez say

[36:17] that he didn't even, he wasn't even aware

[36:22] that any Monsters art got out there.

[36:23] And also Christopher, I also wanna say that yes,

[36:28] and I've said this to you, I did share Monsters art

[36:33] with some people that I trusted and it got out.

[36:37] What I didn't do was like, share it on

[36:41] Canada's Facebook page and like,

[36:44] leak it out on my channels as like a way to burn you.

[36:48] So I'm sorry that I let some people that I trust see it

[36:53] and they let it out, but I didn't put it out.

[36:56] Okay, I just wanna clarify that.

[36:57] And also George Gomez clarified that he was not even aware

[37:01] of that.

[37:02] So for all the Pinsiders out there that have been saying,

[37:05] I'm the reason why.

[37:08] I was not the reason why.

[37:09] I was not the reason why.

[37:12] Man, there's some like Pinsiders.

[37:13] Have you ever noticed these Pinsiders?

[37:14] They just can't, they just can't get over Canada.

[37:17] They can't move on.

[37:19] Like, you know, I don't know what's going on.

[37:22] Like I saw someone was like asking me,

[37:25] like what I thought of like Iceman recently

[37:29] is refusing to watch the Todd Tucky Tor of Automated

[37:33] because of me.

[37:34] He's like, we're all laughing at you, you know,

[37:37] with your porn star hat and your glasses.

[37:39] And I'm like, I'm like cool man,

[37:41] like I know exactly what I'm doing.

[37:43] I make love to a beautiful woman all the time.

[37:45] I'm very confident in who I am.

[37:48] And the one thing I do do is I show my face.

[37:53] I show up at pinball shows.

[37:55] I don't hide behind a computer.

[37:58] And I have no ill will towards Doug Mo Jr.

[38:01] I don't.

[38:02] I mean, you know, he's not Iceman.

[38:04] Iceman was as cool as they get, you know, with Maverick.

[38:08] Like Iceman would have the swagger and the confidence

[38:12] to roll in to Texas pinball festival

[38:14] and like hang out with us.

[38:16] And you know, Doug's a good guy.

[38:18] He is.

[38:18] He actually is a really good guy.

[38:22] And if you read what he says,

[38:23] he kind of says everything I say.

[38:25] I don't know why he thinks everything I say is idiotic

[38:28] what it's exactly what he says.

[38:31] But look, life's too short, man.

[38:33] Life's too short.

[38:34] All these people are parents.

[38:36] They are husbands.

[38:38] They're all working hard to beat inflation.

[38:42] And you know, you're not going to wake up in a good mood

[38:46] if you wake up angry with people.

[38:49] Takes a lot to sort of forgive people and move on.

[38:51] But it's actually really important in life.

[38:55] Yes.

[38:59] I look, I'm glad, you know, Chris,

[39:02] some reading Mr. Franchie Wooder in the bridge.

[39:06] Look, Pinside's not a bad place.

[39:07] Like let's talk about, you know,

[39:10] let's talk about someone that Mr. Franchie knows

[39:12] and real quickly, you know,

[39:14] because I saw a lot of people sharing the news with me

[39:17] that Steve Bowden is no longer Adam American pinball,

[39:21] that David Fix did an interview

[39:22] with loser kid pinball podcast.

[39:24] Now look, as you can just maybe imagine or connect the dots,

[39:29] I've really reluctantly, I don't know how to even put this.

[39:34] I've, first I ignored talking about that company for months.

[39:38] I had to.

[39:41] I don't, again, in the spirit of the holidays

[39:45] and forgiveness, I will say this.

[39:51] And it's hard for me to say this

[39:53] because I'm trying to choose my words very carefully.

[39:56] And as I looked at my little boy,

[39:59] just who walked into the room and this family and this house

[40:02] and, you know, what I do for a living is I make content about,

[40:06] well, my second gig is my real job is my real job.

[40:11] I make content about pinball companies.

[40:14] I provide commentary about my opinions about pinball.

[40:17] I never do any overlap with my clients on my main job.

[40:23] I know what the line is.

[40:26] And I need my real job to support this family,

[40:31] to send my children to daycare.

[40:34] I need my real job to pay for my mortgage

[40:38] and to invest money in the future so I can send my kids the college.

[40:42] All the things I need and worked really hard for.

[40:45] And when I say I need,

[40:47] I've worked really hard to have a career I love,

[40:50] I've worked really hard to have a career I love,

[40:53] to have a company I love working for,

[40:55] a CEO who I adore, who just retired,

[40:59] a new CEO who's great.

[41:01] And I just want to say that

[41:05] if I ever say anything to a pinball company

[41:09] or about a pinball company that they have an issue with,

[41:14] that I would just implore them to just come to me

[41:18] and have a conversation with me.

[41:21] I think that is the mature thing to do.

[41:24] I think that is the appropriate thing to do.

[41:27] And I think, you know,

[41:29] Canadian pinball podcast is me.

[41:32] It's my entertaining sort of alter ego.

[41:36] It is not Chris, father, husband, provider.

[41:41] Okay.

[41:42] And so,

[41:45] the lowest point of my life that I felt maybe my whole life,

[41:51] I was because of what he, you know,

[41:56] what he did to me.

[41:58] And I'm not going to go into details.

[42:01] And it hurt me tremendously more than I've ever hurt that company.

[42:06] It hurt my family tremendously.

[42:09] And again, in the spirit of the holidays,

[42:13] I forgive David Fix for what he has done to me.

[42:18] And I don't wake up and think about it.

[42:21] I don't wake up and think about what he took from me,

[42:24] what he caused me.

[42:26] Because, you know, in his mind, he probably sees it as a fair retribution.

[42:33] You know, the way I look at it all now is,

[42:37] let bygones be bygones.

[42:39] And, you know, I will cover the products they release.

[42:42] And I will do it on my personal time and in my personal spaces.

[42:47] And, you know, they need a hit game.

[42:52] I mean, that's it.

[42:53] They need a hit game.

[42:55] And, you know, you can, you can interview the guy.

[42:58] You can hear all his stories about his relationship with Mukesh and Amtrak.

[43:02] And they find, I mean, nothing mad.

[43:05] A known cares.

[43:06] I got to be honest.

[43:07] I don't care about any words or stories or interviews anymore.

[43:11] I'm so tired of interviewing pinball personalities.

[43:14] All I care about is good games.

[43:17] If you have a great game and you showed it to Distro's, like he said,

[43:20] and orders, you know, people ordered it.

[43:23] Cool.

[43:24] Let's see it.

[43:25] I don't know what else to say.

[43:27] Like, I haven't seen it.

[43:28] No one else has seen it.

[43:29] I know big distributors.

[43:30] I haven't heard any big distributors glowing about it.

[43:34] So I don't really, you know, but again, I don't know how to react to an interview.

[43:40] Where things don't sound great.

[43:43] And I don't know if it's a smart interview to even do.

[43:46] If things aren't like all, like the only thing people want to see is,

[43:50] is a good game.

[43:51] And if you got a good game and you got it in development.

[43:54] And, you know, you say you're not going to launch it until it's done, done.

[43:58] Like it doesn't, I don't, I don't know how to respond to that.

[44:01] Like I don't think any game is really ever fully done.

[44:04] Like there's always improvements you can make with code.

[44:07] I think they're stalling.

[44:10] I think, I think things behind the scenes must be difficult to get a new game to market.

[44:15] And the reason why I'm like, worried about their next game is,

[44:20] it should be out now.

[44:22] Orders should be taken now.

[44:24] Like go up against evil dead.

[44:25] Don't go up against Harry Potter.

[44:27] Don't go up against King Kong.

[44:29] Don't go up against the other stuff that's about to hit them.

[44:32] Like go up against evil dead in Avatar.

[44:35] And X-Men, like these games are not, you know, they're more,

[44:39] you can compete more with those kinds of titles.

[44:43] So, um,

[44:47] again, I look at everybody, you know, I understand the motivation of David Fix.

[44:53] I understand Steve Boud and loves Pimbo.

[44:56] You know, I don't know the guy at all.

[44:59] They don't know me at all.

[45:02] Uh, all I know is, you know, he's had four years at the helm of the company.

[45:08] And he's made strategic decisions that just really didn't work out.

[45:12] And, you know, as we know in Pimbo,

[45:16] one hit game can erase three flops if you nail it.

[45:21] So, I think that's how I see it.

[45:24] Um,

[45:27] But we also live in a world gang where like people are not fair.

[45:32] They they they they they'll make moves.

[45:34] They'll go behind your back.

[45:35] They'll try to get you in trouble with, you know,

[45:38] your employer and all these things.

[45:39] And just like I don't think we should live in that world.

[45:42] I don't I don't.

[45:44] And and so that's what I think is the most important thing.

[45:47] I don't know how to live in that world.

[45:50] I don't I don't.

[45:51] And and and so that's how I'll leave it.

[45:53] I hope they have a good hall that over there.

[45:55] I hope they get a game to market.

[45:57] Uh, and I know nobody cares about the drama.

[45:59] Like if you make if you make a good game,

[46:01] you get a good game out to market.

[46:03] I'm.

[46:04] I you know, I look around my life, ladies and gentlemen,

[46:07] and I'm not longing for anything more like I,

[46:11] yeah, I wish I.

[46:13] Everybody wishes they had some more money and then some more savings.

[46:16] I'm not longing for anything more, but I, you know,

[46:19] two beautiful kids, a beautiful wife,

[46:21] a beautiful house, a beautiful town, beautiful neighborhood,

[46:24] beautiful neighbors, this community is amazing.

[46:27] I've got a beautiful guns and roses machine that I love.

[46:30] I've got two cars I enjoy driving.

[46:34] I've got two parents that are still alive.

[46:37] And when we're not arguing about something stupid,

[46:39] we get along great.

[46:41] I've been given a lot of advantages and leg ups in life.

[46:44] I think that's kind of the way the world is.

[46:46] And I think everybody should be a pretty,

[46:48] pretty thankful for, for what you have.

[46:51] And especially if you're in this hobby and you're,

[46:53] you're able to even have the side coin to buy pinball machines.

[46:59] So.

[47:01] I, you know, that's it.

[47:03] So.

[47:05] We all should be thankful.

[47:08] I have a second copy.

[47:13] Can I get an evil dead skateboard?

[47:15] I really like what you did with it.

[47:18] Can you gift it to Killian for Christmas?

[47:20] I don't know if it's age appropriate, but he would love to have it.

[47:23] I'll hang it on the wall.

[47:27] Thank you.

[47:30] Let's talk about spooky.

[47:32] I watched the stream on Thursday.

[47:35] As I said in my show this week, I don't think there's a company with more good vibes surrounding

[47:43] it right now than spooky pinball.

[47:46] Goonies is next, apparently, with a big pirate ship in cannons.

[47:51] I think Franchie will tell us.

[47:52] Hey, if Goonies is not next, can you just tell us?

[47:59] But I just watch Bug and Luke and Franchie and Ben Hack and everybody over there.

[48:04] As I said on my podcast this week, I think we're reaching a point in pinball where when

[48:11] you buy a game, you want to support a company and you want to feel like some sort of personal

[48:16] connection.

[48:17] I think everything happening in the world now is very personal.

[48:22] I think it was very personal why people voted the way they did in the election.

[48:28] I think mature adults want to understand what were the personal reasons why you feel this

[48:34] way.

[48:35] I've had a lot of good conversations about a post election world.

[48:40] Not from Derek, he still hasn't spoken to me.

[48:44] Really sad.

[48:45] As a man I loved and respected and was part of my family.

[48:48] He was supposed to come over to my house for the holidays and now doesn't even talk to

[48:52] me.

[48:53] I've never been more let down in a friendship in my entire life than I've been let down

[49:00] by Derek Stutzman.

[49:02] I mean that.

[49:03] It is a tragic loss to me.

[49:07] The way he treated me after the election and what he said about anybody that voted for

[49:13] Trump.

[49:14] I'm just going to say it.

[49:16] Yeah, I voted for Trump, but I didn't necessarily like Trump, but my reasons for voting for him

[49:22] are very personal and I will share them with people.

[49:26] If you voted for Harris, I respect you.

[49:28] I respect why you voted that way.

[49:31] I don't know why anyone would be confused that I've always had to moderate socially liberal

[49:36] physically conservative, but of course I'm going to lean a little bit more to the right

[49:39] because of financial reasons in my life and my personal life.

[49:42] Anyway, anyway, my point being my point being everything's personal.

[49:49] And so when you buy a pinball machine from a company, you want to feel some sort of

[49:54] personal connection to that institution.

[49:57] And I don't think any company makes people feel more personally connected to them than

[50:05] spooky pinball.

[50:07] And I said this on my show that when you buy from them, you almost can feel the thankfulness

[50:14] of your purchase that your money is going to go to making these people that I can see

[50:22] with my own eyes, that I can hear from with my own ears.

[50:26] It's going to go to making these people have a great holiday, put food on the table, get

[50:32] everybody jazzed and motivated to hit 2025 running to feel so excited that they've got

[50:38] to build these 800 plus games.

[50:41] And every, you know, every time they sit down to think about new modes and new things,

[50:46] it is like this, how can we as a company say thank you back to those who have thanked

[50:53] us for making these games with the best possible product we can, right?

[51:00] And just pouring passion into these things.

[51:03] Let me ask you a question.

[51:04] Have you heard from Mark Sidon since he released Avatar?

[51:08] Let me let me let me let me ask it again.

[51:11] Where's Mark Sidon?

[51:13] Avatar is out.

[51:14] Have you heard from him?

[51:15] He's one of the nicest guys ever.

[51:17] He is one of the nicest guys ever.

[51:19] I think he should go over to spooky pinball.

[51:21] Have you heard from Mark though?

[51:24] Have you heard from Keith Johnson at all?

[51:27] Like has he, has he been in front of the camera making you feel good about buying an Avatar?

[51:34] But that's my point.

[51:38] Do you think if, if someone really loved what they worked on and is so excited about it,

[51:44] they would just stop talking about it.

[51:47] They would stop engaging the community.

[51:50] They would stop building bridges between the product and customers and future customers.

[51:56] No, you don't hear from them at all.

[51:58] No, no, no.

[51:59] Keith Johnson just wants to put this humongous diner menu of how you play the game on your

[52:06] wall and he's done with you and what you see is what you get.

[52:13] Look Luke, Luke, I'm going to tell you this right now.

[52:15] If you make a Kira, not only will you sell 500 easily, they will not only hold value,

[52:22] they will go up in value, they will not plummet in value like Ultraman.

[52:27] A Kira is probably the most celebrated and iconic work of Japanese anime ever on a global

[52:35] level.

[52:36] Yes, you would easily sell every single one.

[52:39] If you made man, if you got the original soundtrack with that music, it is perfect for pinball,

[52:47] the high energy scenes and you have magnets that can grab the ball because Tetsuo has

[52:53] the telekinesis powers.

[52:55] You've got an upper plate field, you've got everything you need and then you use like holographic,

[53:01] Neo Tokyo, the world under glass just jumps out with a Kira.

[53:06] You absolutely crush it.

[53:13] Just none of these other ones, Robo Tech and Ninja Scroll, they don't have, they're all

[53:21] great, they just don't have the iconic timeless appeal that a Kira does.

[53:27] There's a reason why, like Heritage auctions, whenever they do an Akira auction, like one

[53:32] single frame with Kaneda on his bike sells for like $90,000.

[53:37] Just think about that for a minute, if they don't think that dude who buys that, it's

[53:42] going to be like, be thinking about a $10,000 pinball machine.

[53:47] So I just think, give it a whirl loop, bring me in as a consultant, also don't design it

[53:56] with a crappy design like Ultraman and Halloween.

[53:59] And we say that is it too soon to say Halloween design is not Asian well.

[54:05] Those glad you guys didn't make John Wick those hitmen popping out of the bushes.

[54:12] I don't know, I don't know if you guys were drinking too much when you thought that was

[54:16] going to be fun, it's not fun because you can see them when they don't pop out because

[54:20] they're right there, they're right there, they're right there, they don't pop out of anything.

[54:24] I can still see them before they swing out.

[54:30] Look, the thing is, that's it.

[54:33] Spooky pinball wins the good vibes awards and they know how to do this and they're going

[54:38] to be successful because they will never have to sell thousands of games of one skew.

[54:48] And the moment they dip their toe back into something like goonies, it's day one sell

[54:54] out fighting for a spot.

[54:56] Games will go for three to four thousand over sticker.

[54:59] They're going to have their Metallica, Ellie, remastered moment with goonies.

[55:03] We all know it.

[55:04] I predict it right now.

[55:06] When spooky pinball releases the goonies for $10,000, the market value on those games

[55:11] will be 13 to $15,000.

[55:15] You won't be able to get one.

[55:17] You're going to have to know canada.

[55:18] I will have eight on order and then I will secretly flip seven of them to rich multi-millionaires

[55:25] who will not care.

[55:27] Joe Newhart will tell me he doesn't have one for me.

[55:31] He's going to get me one.

[55:33] Melissa will get me one.

[55:35] The thing is I get them, I get on their list though and I pay money and then you know,

[55:39] it's just also being a little bit facetious guys.

[55:43] The games are going to go instantly and they're going to sell for well over sticker and

[55:51] it's going to be spooky's biggest value game ever.

[55:59] I absolutely believe it.

[56:02] Yeah, stop with the niche horror movies guys.

[56:06] I get it.

[56:08] You're now making enough money where you can easily get some beautiful women in bed.

[56:15] You know what?

[56:16] I haven't said by running joke in a long time.

[56:18] This is why I like toward him and playing his point and I was like, there's no point

[56:23] in being the best in the world at something if it doesn't get you laid.

[56:27] Think about that for a minute.

[56:30] There's no point in being the best in the world at something if it doesn't get you laid.

[56:36] The Elon Musk could be the best in the world at making electric cars.

[56:38] He's getting laid.

[56:40] The best basketball player in the world, getting laid.

[56:44] The best soccer player, getting laid.

[56:47] The best this, the best that probably even the best spelling bee person when they get older.

[56:52] But if you're the best pinball player in the world, that's not going to get you laid.

[56:58] Nope.

[56:59] It's going to make it harder.

[57:03] I can say being the best pinball podcast in the world will get you laid.

[57:07] It's by charisma.

[57:08] Bren is beautiful.

[57:09] She could do so much better than me.

[57:11] So much better than me.

[57:12] The only way I was able to sort of like marry Brenda.

[57:15] Super simple.

[57:16] Personality.

[57:17] 100%.

[57:18] Personality and confidence.

[57:21] You know, you look, she went on dates with jerks and eye bankers with a lot of money.

[57:25] It doesn't mean that.

[57:26] You spend a night hanging out with Canadian in the city.

[57:29] You're going to have a better time when all those guys.

[57:30] You ever hang out with guys that work in finance?

[57:32] I mean, I do it all the time here.

[57:34] I mean, this town is surrounded by people who get like six, seven figure bonuses.

[57:38] I'm in the cheapest house in this town.

[57:41] I don't make the money they make.

[57:44] But whenever I go to like, you know, functions in this town and you're around like a bunch

[57:49] of Patagonia vest wearing financial people, they literally have like, you know, like,

[57:56] what do you do?

[57:58] They can't figure me out.

[57:59] And you're like, I'm a creative at a marketing age.

[58:01] You're like, well, what about the market?

[58:03] I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about right now.

[58:07] You know, charisma.

[58:10] Make them laugh.

[58:12] Make them cry in a good way with surprises, not in a bad way.

[58:20] So everybody look, we've got another half hour to go.

[58:23] I want to talk to you guys.

[58:24] Anything I'm missing?

[58:25] The I haven't talked about CGC.

[58:28] What's weird about CGC right now in my gang is on Facebook, they're like so transparent.

[58:32] Now, like, who's running their Facebook account?

[58:34] Does anyone know like who has the Chicago gaming company handle on Facebook?

[58:41] Because what's so weird about it is they're like confirming things that they really haven't

[58:47] officially confirmed elsewhere.

[58:50] They basically have just said yesterday they are absolutely making more medieval madness

[58:55] remakes in the first quarter of 2025.

[58:58] Like, what?

[58:59] Okay.

[59:00] We know it's coming, but it's just nuts how they're just, and I'm telling you right now, for

[59:06] all of you out there who, you know, who have a royal edition or royal edition, they're

[59:14] going to screw you.

[59:15] They're going to make a final version of medieval madness and your royal edition is going

[59:19] to be made again or made even better.

[59:22] Absolutely.

[59:25] Which people buy pinball and wear cargo shorts?

[59:30] Supporting companies who do what you want pinball companies to do.

[59:34] Royale with cheese, I know.

[59:37] Like I'm so tired of pulp fiction.

[59:41] It's so two years ago.

[59:46] And not only that gang is they made the weight terrible for everybody.

[59:50] They're not throwing in anything extra.

[59:55] And I think they are just a company that I just could care less about right now.

[01:00:02] Good thing about it.

[01:00:03] Like it's going to go, here's how it's going to go.

[01:00:06] It's going to go pulp fictions into medieval madness and then into Twilight Zone remake

[01:00:12] into Halo from Play Mechanics next.

[01:00:15] That's your lineup from CGC for the next probably four years.

[01:00:21] Animal madness, Twilight Zone and Halo.

[01:00:31] Gang cargo shorts.

[01:00:35] Cargo shorts are I think are typically worn by people that are a little bit out of shape

[01:00:44] because they carry everything.

[01:00:47] They don't look good.

[01:00:49] They are comfortable.

[01:00:50] Don't get me wrong.

[01:00:51] I used to have some cargo shorts.

[01:00:53] You just can't look good in them.

[01:00:56] But again, I think they're worn by people that don't care about like fashion or looking

[01:01:00] great.

[01:01:03] But I'd rather hang out with a dude in cargo shorts that loves pinball than an eye banker

[01:01:08] with a Patagonia vest on.

[01:01:13] So it's unfortunate that the trippies won't be at TPS.

[01:01:17] I don't really know what to expect from these new trippies.

[01:01:26] I think French is going to win for best art package.

[01:01:29] I don't know though, French is going to be close because I will say the art package on

[01:01:35] X-Men is also phenomenal.

[01:01:43] The thing is X-Men man, it's like the vibe around that.

[01:01:47] The game is so bad right now.

[01:01:50] Jack hasn't really come out and told us what to expect.

[01:01:56] I don't know if X-Men is going to get votes.

[01:01:59] I think people like seeing French win because of how much he wants it.

[01:02:04] I mean, it's the same thing with Canada.

[01:02:07] You guys understand that, right?

[01:02:11] Like all this is subjective.

[01:02:12] French and yeti are amazing artists.

[01:02:15] But sometimes it comes down to who you just want to see how they're going to react if

[01:02:21] they do win.

[01:02:23] And it's like you want the off the cuff emotionally charged individuals like Canada and

[01:02:30] French, to be the ones who are going to cheerlead and jump up and down and go nuts.

[01:02:38] Where the more reserved people just might be like, thank you.

[01:02:40] Have a good night.

[01:02:41] You know, well, okay.

[01:02:42] I don't know what they're going to do though when it comes to the speeches from the people.

[01:02:51] I don't know.

[01:02:52] I feel like if it's just them talking to a room of 40 people, and I think it's going

[01:03:03] to feel more like a podcast unless like an award show.

[01:03:08] So that's my, that's my only concern is like what was nice about T.P.F.

[01:03:13] It felt like an award show.

[01:03:16] It really felt like an award show because here's a thing.

[01:03:19] Then there's no point in doing it live.

[01:03:23] And I always think they make this mistake because like live from wormhole and why do it live

[01:03:31] if people aren't getting up there and giving live speeches like there's no point.

[01:03:36] You might as well just pre-record the show, get everybody to get like the top three nominees

[01:03:46] from each category to submit their thanks video.

[01:03:51] You know, they're like acceptance speech, if you will.

[01:03:54] And then you can like edit it all together and then you could broadcast it live and then

[01:03:58] have the chat be live, which I think they did that, you know, one year during COVID.

[01:04:03] To me that makes more sense and it's more fun because then you give everybody a chance

[01:04:07] to inject their personality into the show.

[01:04:11] So I don't think they're going to do it that way.

[01:04:14] I think it's going to be, you know, just live from wormhole.

[01:04:19] Like I think they made a huge mistake with like 12 categories for locations.

[01:04:28] Like see, this is the problem.

[01:04:29] It's like everyone's got to stop thinking about like their own personal wishes and think

[01:04:38] about what does the N viewer want to see?

[01:04:42] No one gives a shsh, SHIT best Northeast, best Northwest, best central location, best

[01:04:50] satellite.

[01:04:51] They have like eight different geographical regions where they want to give awards for best

[01:04:56] pinball location.

[01:04:57] It's like no one cares.

[01:05:00] Nobody cares.

[01:05:02] It's like and it's not even like a good thing to vote on because what would someone like

[01:05:07] me know about anything anywhere there?

[01:05:10] And I get what they're trying to be like, well, in the Northeast, I would just say that's

[01:05:14] that way Jack Park can win and that way to like it's just it's too much.

[01:05:18] It's too much.

[01:05:19] I'll tell you this, all pinball locations are great.

[01:05:24] All pinball out there in the world where you don't have to spend $6 to $15,000 are great.

[01:05:30] Sure there's some amazing arcades out there, but they're great.

[01:05:35] Yeah, no, Francie, I'm confused too.

[01:05:46] Should we pull it up?

[01:05:47] Let's pull up the twips right now.

[01:05:49] Let's see if they have like the categories.

[01:05:53] 2024?

[01:05:56] Let's see.

[01:05:58] Let's see if we got the, let's see if we can figure out.

[01:06:08] Chickets available.

[01:06:09] I mean, did anyone buy a ticket?

[01:06:15] All right, so let's see here.

[01:06:21] I'm just, there's like a Twippy webpage and Collins got a story.

[01:06:27] Let's go here.

[01:06:29] All right.

[01:06:31] All right, I'm going to read you the awards right now.

[01:06:37] Content creator awards.

[01:06:38] We've got content creator of the year.

[01:06:42] Okay.

[01:06:43] I'm eligible for that.

[01:06:45] Break out content creator of the year.

[01:06:47] What does that mean?

[01:06:48] Break out.

[01:06:49] Let's, let's, um, I want to be able to see you guys.

[01:06:52] Like, let me share a screen.

[01:06:53] What does breakout mean?

[01:06:56] Does breakout mean your new?

[01:06:58] Is that what that means?

[01:06:59] Break out, but that's not breakout.

[01:07:01] Doesn't mean new breakout means you could have been around for a while.

[01:07:06] And you know why they're doing that?

[01:07:08] A hundred percent.

[01:07:09] I'll tell you why they're doing that.

[01:07:13] They're doing it so they can give an award to probably, um, you know, people who have

[01:07:22] been around, but they're not new.

[01:07:26] It's no breakout.

[01:07:27] Break out means rookie.

[01:07:31] Does it?

[01:07:33] Let me see what the definition of breakout means.

[01:07:36] I just think it means someone who, who grew in popularity.

[01:07:39] It doesn't mean rookie.

[01:07:41] Because why wouldn't they just say best new content creator, best rookie?

[01:07:46] That doesn't make any sense.

[01:07:47] Like breakout is what definition of breakout?

[01:07:51] Let's see.

[01:07:55] Break out.

[01:07:57] The forcible escape, especially from prison and outbreak.

[01:08:04] What does a, okay, see that's what I'm saying.

[01:08:07] Like what does break?

[01:08:09] Does break out, let's say break out a ward mean.

[01:08:16] The award is typically given to the sports person in his or her rookie season at any given

[01:08:22] level, but maybe worn by an athlete who in a given year improves their performance.

[01:08:29] Okay.

[01:08:30] So yeah, it's like a double meaning.

[01:08:33] It either means you're new or you improved.

[01:08:35] Yeah, it really is.

[01:08:37] Just make it the Don Garrison, the Don's Pimball Podcast award where Don's Pimball Podcast

[01:08:43] is the only one on the, on the ballot.

[01:08:46] It's fine.

[01:08:47] Like, look, the dude deserves an award for just, I think he just deserves an award for

[01:08:51] perseverance.

[01:08:53] We should have like Pimball a podcaster that refuses to shake hands award.

[01:08:58] That would be like a shoe in when there.

[01:09:00] He's still upset, still upset.

[01:09:03] We'll see, we'll see if he shakes hands at Stern.

[01:09:06] Um, let's see.

[01:09:08] Okay, so break out best podcast.

[01:09:12] Do you think we're going to win for best podcasts this year again?

[01:09:14] I mean, I know I'm asking a loaded audience here, but like best podcaster.

[01:09:20] Do you think I got it?

[01:09:22] Do you think I, do you think I got it?

[01:09:23] Like, I feel like it's still with me, Zach, Dennis, loser kid.

[01:09:32] Like, who the top like Don's not like he's not best podcast.

[01:09:37] Isn't that not even close?

[01:09:38] Yeah.

[01:09:39] It doesn't work.

[01:09:40] It doesn't work.

[01:09:41] The numbers will never, you know, like I think we got it.

[01:09:44] I think we got it.

[01:09:45] I think, Canada and every canada subscriber and just one other family member and we'd,

[01:09:52] we'd have it.

[01:09:53] Um, we should win breakout too.

[01:09:55] Cause why can't I win breakout?

[01:09:57] Because in the definition of breakout gang, I think we should try to sweep as

[01:10:02] many as we can.

[01:10:03] In the definition of breakout, it just means you've improved.

[01:10:08] So like and that's subjective.

[01:10:11] So that absolutely, I think we should be eligible for breakout best video content creator

[01:10:17] streamer.

[01:10:18] I mean, we're looking at it right here.

[01:10:19] This is the best pinball stream in all of them.

[01:10:20] Well, you know this, you know, this is the best pinball stream in all the pinball.

[01:10:24] Come on.

[01:10:25] You don't want to see pinball in a pinball stream.

[01:10:28] There's just something amazing about potentially winning the best pinball stream in all of

[01:10:34] pinball and not even streaming pinball.

[01:10:38] That is that's where real talent lies.

[01:10:41] All right.

[01:10:42] Then best publication.

[01:10:44] I hope that just goes to NAPS arcade.

[01:10:46] Is that a publication though?

[01:10:47] Is a website of publication?

[01:10:49] All right.

[01:10:51] So when it comes to, yeah, French is right.

[01:10:53] Like when it comes to awards for games, we got game of the year.

[01:10:59] We've got innovation of the year.

[01:11:01] We've got the Lyman sheets best rules in code.

[01:11:05] Best theme integration.

[01:11:08] Best game launch and reveal.

[01:11:10] That's a marketing award.

[01:11:13] Most improved game.

[01:11:15] Wait.

[01:11:17] Wait.

[01:11:23] There's no best art.

[01:11:28] Did they get this wrong?

[01:11:30] There's no best art package.

[01:11:33] Huh?

[01:11:36] Why would there be no best art?

[01:11:39] Where's best?

[01:11:43] Where's best?

[01:11:48] How do you not have best art?

[01:11:50] Which is one of the most celebrated categories in the entire Twitties, which is like one of

[01:11:58] the most fun things to vote on.

[01:12:02] There's no best art.

[01:12:03] I think best theme and theme integration should be separate.

[01:12:09] You know what I'm saying?

[01:12:10] Because like evil dead is not the best theme, but it's the best theme integration.

[01:12:15] See, this is why these committees, French here.

[01:12:17] All right.

[01:12:18] Are you with me on this?

[01:12:19] Who made?

[01:12:20] Who are these committees thinking?

[01:12:22] Like Colin, how do you leave out best art?

[01:12:26] Why would you leave that out?

[01:12:27] And then again, look at, they have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

[01:12:33] There are nine.

[01:12:35] Nine Twitties being handed out for locations.

[01:12:37] Nine.

[01:12:38] There's more Twitties going out for locations than there is for actual game awards.

[01:12:49] So we've got best location, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, West, Europe, Australia,

[01:12:59] Canada, Australia, Asia, Canada, and best new football location.

[01:13:07] We've got the home brew game of the year and then the custom game of the year.

[01:13:11] What does that mean?

[01:13:14] What's the difference between home brew and custom?

[01:13:19] Like are they actually going to give an award to whoever customized their Godzilla the most?

[01:13:28] I don't understand.

[01:13:32] What is that?

[01:13:33] What's a custom game?

[01:13:37] That like some clown like modded up his premium and can win a Twippy?

[01:13:46] What?

[01:13:48] You can't make this stuff up.

[01:13:51] Toppers, best OEM topper, best aftermarket topper, best interactive, aftermarket interactive

[01:13:59] mod or accessory, best aftermarket, non-interactive mod.

[01:14:04] Okay, okay.

[01:14:05] So wait a minute.

[01:14:09] We now, there's no Twippy for best artists, but there's a Twippy for best aftermarket

[01:14:17] interactive mod and aftermarket, non-interactive mod.

[01:14:21] Are you kidding me?

[01:14:23] You can win a Twippy because you three deep printed a sign that doesn't do anything.

[01:14:28] You win a Twippy for that?

[01:14:32] Do you know much work goes into doing an art package for Evil Dead?

[01:14:37] Do you know much work goes into making three pinball podcasts a week and doing a show

[01:14:40] for 90 minutes?

[01:14:41] Do you know much work this takes?

[01:14:43] You get a Twippy for a little sign?

[01:14:45] Doesn't interact?

[01:14:48] I didn't look at all these yet.

[01:14:49] Franchi, thank you for letting me know.

[01:14:51] This is crazy.

[01:14:53] They need to make changes to this.

[01:14:54] Like Colin, come on Jamie, what is this?

[01:14:58] So the problem is now that you do this, now that now, why would you do this?

[01:15:02] Why would you like leave out one of the most popular categories in all of the Twippies?

[01:15:08] We need to get best art back and we're at crunchy.

[01:15:10] I'm telling you right now.

[01:15:12] I'm going to put it on Facebook right now.

[01:15:14] Like the Twippies, I'm going to put it right now.

[01:15:18] The 2024 Twippies are invalid if they do not include an award for best pinball artist.

[01:15:39] Jamie and Colin wake up.

[01:15:44] We don't need nine.

[01:15:46] All right, I'll just post it, Franchi.

[01:15:55] I wrote the 2024 Twippies are invalid if they do not include an award for best pinball

[01:16:00] artist.

[01:16:01] Jamie and Colin wake up, fix this now.

[01:16:04] Very strident, I was.

[01:16:07] They're going to fix it.

[01:16:08] Come on.

[01:16:09] You know, I want to see Franchi versus Yeti here.

[01:16:16] I just, best pinball art.

[01:16:25] Best favorite same thing.

[01:16:29] All right, favorite, all just it.

[01:16:33] Jesus, everyone in the semantics of this world.

[01:16:36] Let me see how do I edit this?

[01:16:38] Edit post.

[01:16:40] Favorite pin.

[01:16:42] All right, favorite.

[01:16:48] All right.

[01:16:56] All right, there we go.

[01:16:59] Up, 100% Franchi, they're going to fix it.

[01:17:01] This is why Canadian need it.

[01:17:05] Too late, Twippies already ordered.

[01:17:08] Order another one.

[01:17:10] Order another one.

[01:17:13] Let's see what else we got here.

[01:17:15] We've got best pinball app or service.

[01:17:19] Best convention or show.

[01:17:23] Just always like T.P.

[01:17:25] He's boring.

[01:17:26] Best tournament.

[01:17:29] Best online community group.

[01:17:32] Best community member.

[01:17:35] Best pinball community member.

[01:17:38] I think we can win.

[01:17:41] Here's the planning committee.

[01:17:44] So hit these guys up.

[01:17:46] Colin, Jamie, Erica S.

[01:17:50] Aaron Siden.

[01:17:53] Mark Siden's wife is on the committee.

[01:17:56] I think Rob,

[01:17:59] who's the best pinball player in the world.

[01:18:02] I think it's the best pinball player in the world.

[01:18:05] It pops up in these weird places.

[01:18:08] Ryan.

[01:18:11] And Will, who's the old this week in pinball.

[01:18:16] So I think canada can win content creator of the year.

[01:18:20] Breakout content creator of the year.

[01:18:22] Best podcast.

[01:18:24] Best video streamers.

[01:18:26] That's four.

[01:18:27] I think it's six twitties people.

[01:18:30] I'm not even joking.

[01:18:31] We could win six twitties.

[01:18:33] We should do it.

[01:18:36] They would never let me win six twitties.

[01:18:39] But we can win six twitties in one year.

[01:18:42] Just think about that for a minute.

[01:18:45] By their rules.

[01:18:47] I'm eligible for six twitties.

[01:18:50] I mean, I, if I don't walk away with at least three of those,

[01:18:53] we know it's not valid.

[01:18:55] It's always hard, right?

[01:18:56] It's always hard because they know the most engaged fanbase

[01:19:01] around the twitties is canada's fanbase.

[01:19:03] They know because they know the only person that promotes the damn show is me.

[01:19:08] Like seriously, like I'm always the number one person that hypes that damn show.

[01:19:18] Why is he French?

[01:19:20] Why does he hate you?

[01:19:21] I don't understand what happened.

[01:19:22] What did you even do to the guy?

[01:19:24] But Hector, the best way to f the twitties is to get canada six of them in one year.

[01:19:31] Can you imagine that?

[01:19:32] We go with six of them.

[01:19:35] Six twitties I should be eligible for.

[01:19:41] The reason why break I have to be eligible for breakout because it can't just be new

[01:19:47] because then then Don won't be eligible either.

[01:19:49] So it's got to just be like, you're having a good year, right?

[01:19:52] You're having a good year.

[01:19:53] That's breakout.

[01:19:54] I think I'm having a good year.

[01:19:56] I've got the most subscribers in the history of pinball subscribers for a podcast.

[01:20:01] I've made the most money out of any pinball podcaster ever through the podcasting, you know,

[01:20:09] through the podcasting amount.

[01:20:11] I've had the most engaged podcasting community there has ever been.

[01:20:17] What else can I do?

[01:20:18] I mean, look, I'm at the top of this very small mountain of dirt.

[01:20:22] I mean, that is really where I've placed the Canadian flag.

[01:20:26] Do your own show like you did last year.

[01:20:28] Look, we could do that stuff.

[01:20:30] But like 9 out of 10 pinball players even know about the trippies.

[01:20:35] They will know about the twitties if they get canada going.

[01:20:37] We're going to win six.

[01:20:39] I'm feeling positive about it.

[01:20:41] I feel good.

[01:20:42] I feel good.

[01:20:43] We should be eligible for six.

[01:20:44] I don't know how they're going to do it.

[01:20:45] Like with the drop downs.

[01:20:46] I hope they get those drop downs, right?

[01:20:48] Franch, you don't worry.

[01:20:49] We're going to get art into this.

[01:20:50] It is a trap.

[01:20:51] I'm going to hit up Jamie right now.

[01:20:53] Like right now.

[01:20:54] We're going to let's call them right now.

[01:20:56] Let's call them live right now.

[01:20:57] See if he picks up and leave him a message.

[01:20:59] Okay.

[01:21:00] Like I'm going to do.

[01:21:01] Remember, this is what made Colin hate me.

[01:21:03] But like this is not like a negative thing.

[01:21:04] I'm not going to chew him out.

[01:21:05] I'm just going to ask him live.

[01:21:06] Why right now people are going to text Jamie.

[01:21:08] Don't answer.

[01:21:09] Do I even have him in here?

[01:21:10] Let's see.

[01:21:11] Warm home.

[01:21:12] I don't know if I have his number saved.

[01:21:15] Does anyone have.

[01:21:18] Let's see.

[01:21:25] I have.

[01:21:28] Is this his number?

[01:21:35] No.

[01:21:36] I don't have Jamie's number saved.

[01:21:38] If someone wants to pee at me, I'll call him live.

[01:21:46] But I don't have it saved.

[01:21:48] Maybe we can come on Facebook message on there now.

[01:21:50] Let's see.

[01:21:53] He is.

[01:21:57] Let's come.

[01:21:58] We're going to call him through Facebook right now.

[01:22:06] I know he's on.

[01:22:08] Jamie, you're on live right now, brother.

[01:22:11] We have a serious, serious question right now.

[01:22:14] Are you ready?

[01:22:15] Yeah, sure that's where we got.

[01:22:16] Dude, we need favorite pinball artist as a category.

[01:22:19] What is up?

[01:22:20] Like I'm going through the show categories.

[01:22:22] I got franchy here.

[01:22:23] You're like, we can't.

[01:22:24] How do you admit that?

[01:22:25] That's like one of the hottest categories that people love to vote in.

[01:22:29] Yeah.

[01:22:30] That's tough.

[01:22:32] Yeah, that's tough.

[01:22:34] When you have 50,000 categories, you got to move them down to the 20.

[01:22:38] I can produce an hour and a half show.

[01:22:41] Dude, you've got nine.

[01:22:42] You've got nine categories for location.

[01:22:45] Nine.

[01:22:46] Yeah, we're going to we're going to spit those out quick.

[01:22:50] It's going to be great.

[01:22:51] You're going to love it.

[01:22:52] Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[01:22:53] But what?

[01:22:54] Art's got to be on there.

[01:22:55] How does that fall out?

[01:22:59] I've heard this complaint.

[01:23:00] You're not the first.

[01:23:01] No, but like, but like, why can't we fix that right now?

[01:23:05] Like, did.

[01:23:06] But how did the committee say we're going to remove art, but have best Midwest location?

[01:23:13] Don't you love the Midwest?

[01:23:15] It's beautiful.

[01:23:16] Jamie, Jamie, this we have to fix this.

[01:23:18] Like, because it goes like, I want you to do it right.

[01:23:20] Like, you can't leave out a category that's had six, seven years of being one of the most celebrated categories.

[01:23:27] Like, now, like, because here's what's happening is like, the rumor is like, it's just a personal

[01:23:32] vendetta against franchi.

[01:23:34] No, I've met Chris a bunch of times.

[01:23:37] I don't.

[01:23:38] Not with you, not with you, but like, who, but, but how did that get?

[01:23:42] Like, how can you admit?

[01:23:44] How can you admit, like, a legacy to award like that?

[01:23:47] And then at you added more location awards.

[01:23:49] So that doesn't hold water, brother.

[01:23:51] You got to admit, like, how do you add location awards and omit a legacy to award that everyone

[01:23:56] love?

[01:23:57] I think this is a good point.

[01:23:59] I think you're bringing up a good.

[01:24:00] So let's just get it fixed.

[01:24:01] The pinball community awards is that it's not just the the Wormall pinball awards.

[01:24:06] Yeah, so let's get art.

[01:24:07] So let's just get art back in as favorite art, favorite artists.

[01:24:10] I mean, I have, I'm going to bring it to the Tooby committee.

[01:24:12] I'm just part of this committee.

[01:24:14] Yeah, we'll bring it up today.

[01:24:16] I will bring it up.

[01:24:17] All right.

[01:24:18] Let's fix it.

[01:24:19] Like, just get it in.

[01:24:20] No, I mean, look, I like, I don't love all these locations.

[01:24:21] I'm going to bring it up.

[01:24:22] I'm going to bring it up.

[01:24:23] No, I mean, look, I, I don't love all these locate.

[01:24:26] I think there's too many locations.

[01:24:27] You know that?

[01:24:28] Like, I just think, I think we're gonna have to breed through that.

[01:24:31] And then break out, like just define breakout for me because like, does that mean rookie

[01:24:35] or just having a really good year or both?

[01:24:37] I think it's a rookie is if I had to read it to it.

[01:24:40] Okay, and there's, I don't have the notes in front of it, brother.

[01:24:42] Okay, and then is there going to be like, it'll be drop down, right?

[01:24:45] So people would vote with drop down to this.

[01:24:47] Yeah.

[01:24:48] you know, but drop down boom boom boom. I know you want to win five to eight. I mean, six, six

[01:24:54] on potentially. Well, not break. No, no, break out is rookie. Then I'm not eligible. But the rest,

[01:25:00] the rest, but here's the thing. The other thing that was interesting that you guys change a little

[01:25:03] bit is theme, best theme is different than best theme integration, right? Because like evil dead is

[01:25:10] the best, maybe integrate a theme, but it's not the best theme. So that's the other issue. It's

[01:25:16] it seems like you guys consolidated in areas that I think are important to

[01:25:24] celebrate like, you know, because like who got the who picked the best theme? Doesn't mean they

[01:25:29] integrated it, right? Right? When you just do, I can tell you that there was a group of people

[01:25:35] trying to get this done and all volunteers who was getting paid. And we're just trying to

[01:25:40] make this to as best we can. And if art is the one like getting everybody going, then I think

[01:25:47] it's probably worth another discussion. All right, I do. No, I also just like my recommendation too

[01:25:51] is like, I would have just kept all the manufacturer awards the way they were and just cut some of

[01:25:57] the other fat that made the show long-winded, right? It's like, but I think what what it's looked like

[01:26:03] what happened is a lot of the manufacturer stuff got truncated and like that's actually

[01:26:08] how you celebrate pinball, right? There's almost like too much community and personality awards

[01:26:16] outside of manufacturer awards. And that's what that's my only advice guys. As you go back and I

[01:26:21] would just have a committee meeting, they're like, look, canator brings up an interesting point.

[01:26:24] We've actually reduced the amount of times we can recognize the ladies in gentleman who make

[01:26:30] these games and actually make the products. And we've increased the amount of awards for content

[01:26:36] creators and locations. And I think that's what I would just look at. And you guys have two and a

[01:26:42] half weeks to just like, you know, to shuffle to shuffle a little bit. I'd be happy to

[01:26:49] I might be above my pay grade brother. Well, no one's getting paid for this. So like nothing's

[01:26:53] above your pay. Well, look, I would look and I'm happy to join an emergency meeting with your

[01:27:01] committee. Oh, yeah. You want to be on the committee? No, I don't want to be on it. But like, come

[01:27:05] out. But I just like, you know, like this, this isn't hard. Like what people, you know,

[01:27:11] build a show for that recognizes. I beg the different how hard it's going to be. I've already put

[01:27:16] it in probably 40 hours just on the script and the things alone. And you know, I want to make sure

[01:27:23] that that what happened in previous years with with audio and video don't ever happen yet. Yeah,

[01:27:28] well, I mean, yeah, yeah, but like, you know, but like, there's, you got to think about like

[01:27:33] in a workshop, like if you just start removing awards that have that have legacy'd one six, seven

[01:27:38] years in a row, like that's not that's like, it's just not fair, I would say to those

[01:27:44] individuals that are that were eligible. Again, these are just like people who are on the

[01:27:48] manufacturing side should be they should take precedence over the content creators, the location,

[01:27:54] you know, they should like like, French and Yeti.

[01:27:58] I'm trying to hand out all bars of gold. Some people are going to complain that it's heavy.

[01:28:02] Yeah, but it's like, it's crazy that like, French and Yeti shouldn't be and the artist for

[01:28:08] Avatar shouldn't be like not even recognized, but like Don will and me. Like that, that's

[01:28:14] weird, you know, like that's not celebrating the best in pinball. It's, you can do both. There's

[01:28:19] my point is like they're they just let's get the art in. I think that'd be a good first and I

[01:28:24] would separate theme and theme integration just because it's two separate things, right? When you

[01:28:30] think about right, what the best theme in pinball is not evil dead, but it's the best theme integrated

[01:28:34] and I would say the best theme in 2024 was probably what like, jaws, right?

[01:28:41] But jaws wasn't, but jaws wasn't the best theme integrated or, you know, maybe it was, I don't,

[01:28:46] you know what I'm saying? But that's that's what makes it fun to vote on because it really does

[01:28:49] make you think a little bit about, oh, okay, like by definition, like I need, you know, two

[01:28:55] two separate games might win for best theme and best theme integration. That that's that's what

[01:29:01] makes it fun to see the results. No one cares about any location results except for those locations

[01:29:08] and that's when you lose audience. Do you think that I was thinking that, you know, how sometimes

[01:29:16] the Oscars and the award shows do free? Yeah, like they show quickly like best short anime. Yeah,

[01:29:21] you could do all that. That's fine, but just but then get more of the meat back on the bone with

[01:29:26] the manufacturer awards which fell off. Like that, you know what I'm saying? Because that's the

[01:29:29] stuff people want to see. Anyway, take take take get back to the committee.

[01:29:34] Jason, producer credit for this. No, it's just common sense, Jamie. You know, I love you. I'm

[01:29:39] like, you're on my Saturday morning show right now. Everyone has faith in you. I think, you know,

[01:29:46] like this has to have been a personal like weird decision and I think just corrected. That's it.

[01:29:51] Look, I can tell you this. I honestly, I can tell you this. When this, when we were approached

[01:29:56] and and we didn't bring this up on the podcast, so I'll give it to you that, right?

[01:30:01] The war mall said we had stipulations and the stipulations were nothing,

[01:30:05] Bologna cheese, right? Come on. I'm not gonna swear because you've

[01:30:08] right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. And had to be completely and not only above the board. Because

[01:30:14] if you look at the reputation of war mall, we don't have a reputation of being a wholes.

[01:30:17] All right, but let me ask you a question. When you say nothing, Bologna cheese, then you've got a

[01:30:21] you can't win a trippy for favorite artist, but you can for best aftermarket non interactive mod.

[01:30:28] It doesn't get any more Bologna cheese than that. That's just like a fucking

[01:30:31] side. I just encourage that's like a fucking sign, bro. You know, that like someone 3D

[01:30:35] prints can win over what French and Yeti put into an R-pack. That's why I would go back. There

[01:30:41] is some Bologna cheese in here, man. You know, and you know that. Like, because you know, that that

[01:30:46] that means nothing. That's not going to make pinball better. I think these manufacturers

[01:30:50] actually do. If you want to make it a legitimate award, right? Would these manufacturers do celebrate

[01:30:54] it? You got to like make them the priority first and foremost, right? The rest of it, it is fun to

[01:31:00] watch the personalities, right? Like the pinball podcasters fighting it out. Like that brings

[01:31:04] audience. That's why podcasting was like, yeah, but I would just look at it. And again, I'm happy to

[01:31:08] meet with you guys. It's like the committees are good bunch of people. I'm surprised Aaron

[01:31:12] over at fast pinball who self proclaims himself as the smartest man and pinball didn't like even

[01:31:17] recognize this. So like you guys are too smart to like retract some of those industry awards. That

[01:31:23] should just it's I think Jamie it's like, it's just like don't

[01:31:28] don't mess up the stuff that actually matters and don't add too much extra that no one even needed.

[01:31:34] That's my only advice. And I'm happy. I gotta be honest, I appreciate the advice, right? Because

[01:31:39] I'd rather you call me get me on the spectacular. And then yeah, we'll make it good. We'll make it

[01:31:45] right. No, because it needs to be right. And I don't want I we don't want any of the stains of

[01:31:51] previous. Yeah, that's it. And then everyone's out there. And look, and then the more people eligible,

[01:31:56] the more interesting the better. Like I love you, brother. They love you. Like as I'm speaking

[01:32:01] you right now, like it's filled with hearts and and everyone like this is it. This is good. This

[01:32:05] is good. And it's never too late, you know, to just make a little bit of a pivot. And then

[01:32:10] everyone's happy. Like it's important. Like everyone needs feedback, you know, and it's just about

[01:32:14] what you do with the feedback. All right, brother. I'll let you go. Yeah. And hey, like

[01:32:20] where's my first class ticket down to Texas? It's it. You know, we are five on three. I want

[01:32:25] people to know that they're listening and watching. Yeah. Warmall is a nonprofit, right? We're not

[01:32:31] just we're doing this so that we can start working with Project Kimball more and working with

[01:32:36] neurodivergent individuals. So that's what we're doing. Okay. I'm trying to get a first class. You

[01:32:42] might get a spirit out of us. Wow. Well, what does Project Kimball do with all that money? No one

[01:32:48] makes a profit there. That's a that's a story for another day. Anyway, I'm just joking. Everybody say

[01:32:53] about it, Jamie. Jamie. Have a great Saturday. Yeah, brother. All right.

[01:33:00] See, that was great. I think we got it. I think we got it. I think we got it.

[01:33:09] Franchi, you're in. You're in now. I'm already declaring a victory on on favorite artists.

[01:33:14] I'm already declaring it.

[01:33:28] Look, Colin. Colin's in here now. Like, it doesn't matter, Colin. It doesn't matter if

[01:33:34] if Franchi and yell that you and will. It doesn't matter. Like it's because because Colin,

[01:33:39] what you can't do is you can't prohibit zombie Eddie from winning the amazing artist on

[01:33:46] Avatar from winning. You can't use Franchi as a as a way to eliminate the category because

[01:33:54] Colin, then you're falling into that slippery slope. We're trying to avoid that happen with me

[01:33:59] last year. Right. We had our you know, we had our kerfuffle, whatever you call it. And then you,

[01:34:04] you know, you removed my ability to win. Don't do it again. All right. And again, we've got a few

[01:34:11] weeks. You guys, the show is in a few months. It just let sleeping dogs lie. Is that the phrase

[01:34:20] I'm looking for? I don't even know. But in the spirit of the holidays, guys, just get get all of

[01:34:25] this stuff out of of our systems. Recognize like whatever manufacturer awards there were before

[01:34:34] just you got to keep them. Those were the most important awards. And I think if we do it right,

[01:34:42] you're going to get a much better audience. And you're going to just have people are going to feel

[01:34:46] like it's valid. And then you're not going to give some other awards show the opportunity to

[01:34:51] just swoop in and recognize artists and recognize this. And you know, I get I think there's there's

[01:34:57] you know, when Jamie says like we don't want the baloney and the cheese, yet you've got some

[01:35:02] baloney and cheese awards in there. And it's probably because some people on the committee are

[01:35:07] friends with people who make non interactive pinball mods. Like that is not that should not be

[01:35:13] a trippy. You can do best mod. Just do best best after market mod. But to break up mods, think

[01:35:21] about how crazy this is calling to break up after market mods into two categories of interacts with

[01:35:28] the ball and doesn't. And then not even break up best theme and best theme integration, which are

[01:35:36] far more interesting to think about. Far more impactful on games themselves. And I also think

[01:35:47] much better like data for manufacturers to look at, right? We what we won, you know, like we won

[01:35:54] for best theme, but we didn't integrate it. Like people that's a good thing to telegraph to

[01:35:59] manufacturers. Okay. So I look again, in the spirit of the holidays, I think all of this can easily

[01:36:06] be fixed. I think everything becomes water under the bridge. I think the committee knows what the

[01:36:12] right thing is to do. And I mean this when I say this, you easily invite me into this that meeting.

[01:36:18] I'll tell you guys exactly what to do. I could I could fix it in five minutes. And it's like, you

[01:36:23] know, to Jamie's point, like don't spend 40 hours on scripts and making sure you get the production,

[01:36:29] right? Before you get the actual awards, right? Like the categories, right? Like get that right.

[01:36:36] I didn't take a strong look at it because selfishly, I was like, oh, I'm eligible. I don't care

[01:36:41] about the rest of it. But now I'm like overly eligible. I, you know, I'm not a rookie. So I could

[01:36:46] potentially win five twippies. I mean, there's too many. Like I should not be able to win more awards

[01:36:52] than Keith L. Win or, you know, Keith Johnson or, you know, just like, yeah, yeah, there's too much of that.

[01:37:02] Okay. Well, Colin, now Colin, the thing is you can't remove favorite artists. So what happened

[01:37:10] was Colin, we were just looking at all the awards and there's just, you know, you sort of reduced

[01:37:15] the amount of manufacturer eligible awards and increased significantly the content creator awards,

[01:37:23] location awards. Like that's not, you know, when we really want to celebrate the finest in pinball,

[01:37:29] you always have to put the manufacturers and all the hardworking people who make the games we love.

[01:37:35] Those awards should be the priority. It was always just icing on the cake to see Canada battle

[01:37:40] it out with franchi and Zach for podcasts. Like that was just fun. End of show drama, if you will.

[01:37:47] But, you know, you can't, you can't start to do too many sort of deconstructing of content creator

[01:37:55] awards and have too many because you want to, you know, you want to celebrate too many of those people.

[01:38:00] The truth is this. There's like very few really, really good pinball content creators and the best

[01:38:06] ones will just always win. And that doesn't mean like people should stop doing what they do, but,

[01:38:11] you know, it just is what it is. And unlike a sport, like I think it just kind of stays the same.

[01:38:17] Like, I'm not getting rusty in my age. I'm getting better at this. So, and I think Colin too, like,

[01:38:23] we want to just make sure it's representing everybody the best. And I think that's a fair way to look

[01:38:28] at it. And, franchi's runner-up categories. You know, that's a thing is like for best artists,

[01:38:36] man, to leave out. I got to be honest, franchi and everybody there. Like, this would be the most

[01:38:41] competitive year for favorite art. You've got avatar looks stunning, Metallica, Ellie looks stunning,

[01:38:49] X-Men looks stunning and evil dead looks stunning. So, in a year in which that battle

[01:38:57] is probably the most interesting battle to watch in all of the awards. You remove it.

[01:39:04] How is evil dead not eligible? Because it didn't ship. And then that's another idiotic thing. So,

[01:39:10] you know, art's not going to change. So, evil dead should be eligible. Like, art should be

[01:39:16] eligible the moment it's revealed. Especially from a company that's not going to like not ship it.

[01:39:22] This isn't Raza. This isn't, well, Colin, you remove the favorite artist category.

[01:39:32] It's not a huge synaptic leap if you remove the favorite artist category to realize that every

[01:39:39] artist is getting snubbed on their opportunity to win. But, Colin, I know you guys are going to change it.

[01:39:44] Colin also just common sense. Because I do think what's hard about some of these award shows is

[01:39:48] context matters, right? So, knowing evil dead is stunning and, you know, it can't win for best code.

[01:39:56] It can't win for best game of the year. But, the art is final. And so, maybe we should let evil dead

[01:40:04] art be eligible this year because of that. And, you know what I'm saying? Because the problem is,

[01:40:10] if you wait a year, so many more games are going to come out. Like, I don't, and the art was

[01:40:16] revealed in December. I absolutely would make evil dead art eligible in this year's Twippies because

[01:40:23] it's fresh, it's hot, it's new, it's exciting. And, and you, and just put it in the drop down,

[01:40:29] and just let people vote, just let people vote the way they want to vote, let people vote. And,

[01:40:34] and I'll tell you another reason why I should do it, Colin, is because there's nothing greater

[01:40:39] than activating a crazy man like myself in the name of Christopher Franchi. You want to activate him

[01:40:49] to get excited, to lobby for votes, to go to his fans. And, and, and you know, that's how the

[01:40:55] Twippies work, my man. They work by exciting the nominees to then go to their fans and their

[01:41:04] community and encouraging them to vote. You know, when you remove that, you remove hundreds of

[01:41:12] people that are interested in checking out the show. And so that's my point, you know, and,

[01:41:19] and, and look, and this is all so easy to fix in just a few minutes. I mean that, not even a few

[01:41:25] hours, a few minutes. It is not hard to figure out what things you need to separate theme from theme

[01:41:32] integration. I would have best favorite artists. I would have a, you know, I think like,

[01:41:42] you know, I would use to have best sound in a game, which was always a little weird, but that's gone

[01:41:47] too. But again, think about it. If you remove best sound from a pinball machine, if you just remove

[01:41:53] that, and this is why you can't remove that, is because when you remove best sound in a game,

[01:41:59] you actually then remove the ability to reward someone like David Thiel from winning recognition.

[01:42:07] You remove, you know, I don't know if there's been like a great sound package is here to be honest,

[01:42:14] but, but sound is not there. I also saw no more best call outs. You know what I'm saying? It's like,

[01:42:23] I would rather lose all the pinball location awards. Just lose them all and restore stuff like best

[01:42:30] call out because a call out and a company directing actors to give that those high energy call

[01:42:38] outs. Like that's part of a memorable game's experience. I think that deserves recognition as well.

[01:42:45] Again, all these things were there. You know, no, but see if the thing is calling is like,

[01:42:53] here's the thing, you can, you can hear a call out on a YouTube stream of a game. I can see an

[01:43:01] artwork. I can't see what it's like to play in the Midwest location nominees. I, I, I, I,

[01:43:08] vehemently think the only filter should be like, are people able to experience or see with their

[01:43:16] own eyes or make or have enough information? Right. I think that's the best way to say it.

[01:43:21] Enough information to come to a a conclusion on this, on this category. And I think theme

[01:43:31] integration, yes, best theme, yes, best sound, yes, best call outs, yes. Of course. Like we're all

[01:43:37] listening to the call outs on evil dead right now. And we know no one knows the game. But right

[01:43:43] now, as of like right now, I mean, it would probably win best call outs in a game. And it should,

[01:43:52] I, you know, I'm, I, again, this is not hard. What did Ian say? Definitely need art, but losing

[01:43:59] location is stupid. Building community is important just because you don't play Pimbo. Ian,

[01:44:04] Ian, having nine twippies for locations is idiotic. It's idiotic, Ian. You're going to have

[01:44:11] nine twippy awards for nine different geographical regions. It's idiotic. I mean, if you want to do

[01:44:20] East Coast, West Coast, North, South, but nine, nine. Ian, I'll tell you right now, I thought you're

[01:44:27] a marketer. Do you want to put the audience to sleep or do you actually want to do awards that

[01:44:33] make people want to tune in? That is the most idiotic category. It's never fun. It's, it,

[01:44:40] all it ever does is make all the locations that lose feel a little bit crummy in a way. And, and

[01:44:47] again, like we saw this, like that's one of the easiest to, to, to game. You know, we're locations

[01:44:54] which is simply set up a laptop and everyone's just like voting and like places were like winning

[01:45:02] that were tiny compared to much larger locations that don't care about winning or trip. You know,

[01:45:06] so I again, whatever. What do I know? People want to hear nine tw... Like you have more awards for

[01:45:12] location than you do for manufacturer awards. Okay, I'm not on this committee. I'm just observing it

[01:45:19] right now. Well, I don't like publication is naps or case. It's not a publication. So can that

[01:45:28] even like are there even any pinball publications like physical publications? I think there should be

[01:45:35] a best pinball news site. But anyway, look gang, I like that this stuff always makes us get, you know,

[01:45:49] talking. I think it does because it's like it's a way to reflect on our hobby and our community.

[01:45:55] And that's that. So, so Ian, you've got Nudge and you've got pinball magazine. What else?

[01:46:08] So like I'm just Ian, I'm just curious. So like are you really trying to win a, a two-dog race with

[01:46:14] magazine? Why would naps be a publication? Is a website a publication now?

[01:46:29] Well, look, I'm fine, you know, gang, like drop Nudge or naps canedicists put everything down.

[01:46:35] Like as long as you put as much as you can in the drop down menus, that's that's a win-win win.

[01:46:41] Right. I just think when you like in the past, I felt like there isn't, you know, remember

[01:46:46] they had like the had the worst category ever. I tell you what the worst category in the history of

[01:46:51] the trippies was was best pinball article. Now that was like the dumbest thing in the history of

[01:46:58] trippies because like you're going to give a guy a trippy for writing one article when podcasters

[01:47:05] have to freaking podcast thousands of hours a year when designers have to spend two years of

[01:47:12] their lives making a game when artists have to slave away for art. You're going to give a guy

[01:47:16] that same award for writing one article. Stupid. Anyway, Colin, happy to connect offline. We can

[01:47:27] we can go through the categories and I can give you just my opinion on what I think should

[01:47:32] should come what should maybe go some areas of consolidation and that's that.

[01:47:40] What is the insane? Franch, you don't want this smoke. Wait, Ian, are you like threatening,

[01:47:45] Franch, you come on, man. Ian, in Simmerdown, as I tell my dad, Simmerdown.

[01:47:51] Ian, I don't think anyone here is is acting like if I don't go to it, I'm going to snipe it

[01:48:03] like a nerd. I don't even know what that means. I don't intend to snipe it like a nerd.

[01:48:10] Curious phrase there. My attendance will be determined by the family inside this house and

[01:48:22] whether or not it's a good time of year for me to get away. But I'm not sure yet because here's

[01:48:28] the thing, Ian, nobody's communicated to anyone on the on the ballot, if you will. What going

[01:48:37] there means for me? Are there going to be chances to give live speeches?

[01:48:43] What's the reason for going? That's the only thing. I would obviously want to see

[01:48:55] where I'm all flake and all my boys down there. But just communicating because if I'm going to

[01:49:03] spend $1,000 or whatever to come down and spend a few days, I just want to make sure what does it

[01:49:10] look like. What do we got going on here? People fighting, we always seem to bring out the best

[01:49:17] of everybody. Let's be honest. I feel like I'm the coolest character here right now. I think

[01:49:21] Jamie was really cool. I don't think anyone's fighting. I think anyone in the chat who is sort of

[01:49:26] getting a little unhinged a little bit should just simmer down. You come to the party,

[01:49:33] that's what pinball is about. Let me ask you a question, Ian. I win favorite pinball

[01:49:41] podcast or what happens. I'm there. Do I get a chance to, is there going to be like an open mic

[01:49:49] for people there to say thank you to the people that voted for them and maybe have a little

[01:49:58] minute or two address? I don't know. Is that a thing? Is there going to be a desk with a mic for

[01:50:07] those in attendance who are being, I don't know. Again, I'm just trying to figure it out.

[01:50:20] Yeah, I mean, gang, gang, we're all grown men. We're all grown men in a hobby that the majority of

[01:50:27] people think we're losers. We all should have invested our money in Netflix stock, meta, and

[01:50:33] Nvidia. If all of us just bought those three shares four years ago instead of any pinball machines,

[01:50:39] we'd all have six figures plus off of just a single pinball machine purchase. Yeah, good times

[01:50:46] to buy pinball new inbox. If you're there, you can say something. We're going to try and

[01:50:54] dial people in. Okay, cool. No, this is good, gang. This is good. I think I'm glad the

[01:51:00] twippers are back. I've never said otherwise. I don't snipe like a nerd. I don't know what that

[01:51:07] means. Ian, it's just Ian, man, you know, you're never going to, you're never going to get like,

[01:51:14] you're never going to try to pigeonhole me as being like a bad guy or trying to shut down,

[01:51:20] you know, this award show. Nobody loves the twippies more than me. I hope you guys understand

[01:51:24] that nobody loves the twippies more than me. Hold on one second, ladies and gentlemen. I'll show you why.

[01:51:45] You're going to do this. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right. Okay, so

[01:51:55] I'm trying to tell you like, you want to know about the twippies here. You want to know what it feels

[01:52:00] like to get up there after years worth of work and win one of these five-hour trophies, brother.

[01:52:07] I'll tell you what it feels like. Girls waiting in the limousine,

[01:52:11] Brenda saying, daddy don't hurt me. You know, people trying to get your autograph left and right,

[01:52:18] open bar, capital grill. That's what it's like, brother, rolling in. I get you want to feel what it's

[01:52:25] like to put on that jacket, you know, be a little bit of a pimped nudge magazine, beautiful photography.

[01:52:33] Take a photo of this brother. Take a photo of this.

[01:52:41] I'm like, I'm like, carefully, carefully putting down my $5 trophy so I don't scratch them.

[01:52:48] Because, you know, they mean a lot more than five bucks.

[01:52:52] All right, dripping in twippies.

[01:53:00] You know what I'll never understand? When when franche smashed his twippy,

[01:53:05] I was there. It was so obviously a joke. I will never understand, franche, after all these,

[01:53:13] how the heck did Mike Vinicore not realize that that was a joke? It was so obviously a joke.

[01:53:21] I still to this day and more upset that people thought that was being, you know, was real and a sincere

[01:53:29] reaction. Like, oh my gosh, like talk about weird. Like I don't understand.

[01:53:38] But it was so obviously staged. I don't know. But he like really like got mad about it.

[01:53:48] All right, everybody. Well, we're well past the normal time. But we had a good, you know,

[01:53:52] free twippies meeting of an alternative twippy council here in committee.

[01:53:59] Everybody be good and have a great weekend and treat your families as good as you treat

[01:54:08] canada with love and respect. All right. Happy holidays. We'll be back. If you haven't signed up

[01:54:15] for canada's pinball podcasts and you want to know what it's all about and what being on the

[01:54:20] winning side of the twippies about, join. We're going to make pinball podcasting great again.

[01:54:26] Oh, that's so funny how easy it is to like get people going. All right. Everybody later.
