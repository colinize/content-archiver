[00:00] No, man, nothing is fucked here.

[00:02] Nothing is fucked!

[00:03] No, man.

[00:04] The goddamn plane has crashed into the mountain!

[00:14] Welcome to episode 108 of Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[00:19] I want to thank each and every one of you.

[00:22] We finally have done it.

[00:23] If you go into iTunes and you search for Pinball Podcast,

[00:28] we now come up as the number one suggestion.

[00:33] God, that feels good.

[00:34] It's been a long run.

[00:36] We have over, I think, like, 110,000 listens to the show.

[00:40] It's incredible.

[00:41] It's incredible.

[00:42] This is a great interview I did with Mr. Rare Hero, Greg Colton.

[00:47] I have to say, this is sort of testament to the typical sort of evolution

[00:54] of how two strong personalities used to clash on Pinside.

[00:59] Greg and I used to get in battles back and forth.

[01:02] We continue those battles over into Gmail.

[01:05] Over time, we realize we both really love Pinball,

[01:09] what's the point of fighting, and we work things out.

[01:12] And I've been asking Greg to come on the show,

[01:14] and he finally has come on, and I think you're really going to enjoy it.

[01:19] And what I love about this interview is how sort of sensible and normal

[01:23] and cool Greg sounds.

[01:25] And I think a lot of people's sort of true nature and true personality

[01:29] just don't come through on the forums.

[01:31] Now, of course, we're going to talk to Greg about the Big Lebowski

[01:35] and his experience waiting to get his Big Lebowski.

[01:39] He's one of the unfortunate few whose machine is sort of hell-captive at ARA.

[01:46] And we had a news update today.

[01:48] We had a news update today, and that's why I was waiting to air this interview with Greg

[01:51] because we heard from Barry and Yop, they met with ARA today.

[01:56] And I want to read you what they said to their customers.

[02:00] They said, as you might know, today we visited ARA,

[02:05] the contract manufacturer of the Big Lebowski Pinball,

[02:09] to see if we can work things out.

[02:11] Last week, the managing director of ARA left the company,

[02:14] and since he was responsible for the project,

[02:17] we had an opening to talk again.

[02:20] After two hours of talking, both ARA and DP concluded that it was a useful meeting

[02:26] and that things look positive.

[02:29] In the next two weeks, we will review and work on a new plan, contract, and terms.

[02:36] We are very positive about this new situation,

[02:39] and we'll send you more updates when there is news,

[02:43] kind regards, Barry, and Yop.

[02:46] Okay, we heard that dread it two words, which is two weeks.

[02:52] We expect to give you guys a news update.

[02:55] I think every Pinball manufacturer out there now knows that you're not allowed to use two weeks

[03:00] as a timeline to receive news.

[03:02] It's not responsible.

[03:04] I don't know, I got mixed feelings from people on this.

[03:07] I got mixed feelings.

[03:08] Some people were excited, some people were thinking it's more bullshit.

[03:12] It's just more time that we're going to have to wait and see what happens.

[03:16] You know, I don't know.

[03:18] It's like, I wasn't in the room, you weren't in the room.

[03:21] They said things were positive, it was a two hour discussion.

[03:24] I still think it's going to come down to money.

[03:27] I don't care what anybody says.

[03:29] At the end of the day, Barry and Yop have to cut ARA a check to pay for the games that have shipped

[03:36] and to pay for the games that have been built.

[03:38] I just don't understand why they can at least pay for the 40 games that were built and shipped

[03:45] and then discuss the new contract.

[03:48] But the fact that owners are waiting months and the company is sort of roading away slowly,

[03:54] if not quickly, because of all the time that's going on, leads me to believe that it...

[04:00] I don't know what the financials are.

[04:02] I really don't.

[04:03] I don't know if they can afford to write that check.

[04:05] I don't know what the renegotiations are going to be like.

[04:07] I don't know how long that's going to take.

[04:09] But I'll say this.

[04:10] I hope they work it out.

[04:11] I hope they work it out.

[04:12] I'm not going to speculate anymore.

[04:14] I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

[04:16] But I know that big Lebowski owners are frustrated.

[04:20] This is a bit of decent news.

[04:22] It is not the news they were hoping for, which is we worked it out.

[04:26] Your games are shipping next week, which is what people wanted to hear.

[04:29] All right.

[04:30] Without further ado, let me roll the tape of Canada

[04:34] and Rare Hero talking it out on

[04:38] Canada's Pinball Podcast Episode 108.

[04:41] I hope you enjoy.

[04:42] I think you will.

[04:43] All right.

[04:44] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[04:47] A guest I've been waiting, I think like almost two years to get on the show.

[04:53] He's no other than Rare Hero on Pinside.

[04:57] Greg Colton works on Family Guy.

[05:00] You guys know him really well.

[05:02] Greg, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[05:05] What's up, buddy? How's it going?

[05:06] Good. Good.

[05:07] You came on right because you want to collect $100

[05:10] because you're going to get Hilton to join the show soon, right?

[05:12] That's the reason why...

[05:14] Did you hear my last podcast where I offered $100 to get him on?

[05:17] Oh, I didn't hear that one yet.

[05:19] Sorry.

[05:20] The offer is out there.

[05:22] Greg, we're going to talk about all this stuff going on in the hobby.

[05:26] We definitely want to talk about the big Lebowski at some point

[05:29] because we know that you're in on one of those 40 machines

[05:32] that's sitting at ARA waiting for a plane ticket.

[05:36] But Greg, for the listeners of the show that may not be on Pinside as much as you and I are,

[05:43] let's do a quick sort of like background on who you are,

[05:46] like what you do for a living and how you sort of got into Pinball.

[05:49] Sure. Yeah, I mean, people listening to your podcast have heard Rare Hero, Rare Hero,

[05:54] Rare Hero, Greg, Greg, they probably don't know what the hell you're talking about.

[05:59] And for the record, Rare Hero, you know, I don't consider myself a hero

[06:04] or nor am I interested in things that are that rare.

[06:07] But that name came from a...

[06:09] Did you ever play the game of Ridge Racer on PlayStation or in the arcade?

[06:13] There's a...

[06:15] Yes.

[06:16] I don't use it in present day metaphor.

[06:19] Tell me.

[06:20] Well, no, I mean, I made this internet name up a million years ago.

[06:24] But Rare Hero is a song in the game that I happen to like.

[06:28] And that's where that came from, like, 20 years ago or whatever.

[06:32] So that's where that came from.

[06:34] Has that been your avatar on other forms?

[06:36] Do you have like one avatar that you use in different places?

[06:39] Pretty much.

[06:40] I mean, I used to use that on Club or K-Love or whatever you call it.

[06:44] Club. Yeah.

[06:45] Club. Yeah, nobody says it the same.

[06:47] And yeah, and even back in the day on RGP Reckhames Pinball.

[06:50] That's what I used.

[06:52] Cool.

[06:53] Yeah, I'm pinnay to everywhere.

[06:54] Every time I get banned, same criminal.

[06:58] Yep.

[06:59] So you're on...

[07:01] You're on Pinside and tell us, Greg, what you do for living.

[07:04] Because I know most people know of, but not everybody.

[07:06] Sure. So I'm a director, animation director on Family Guy.

[07:11] This year, this will be my 13th year directing the show, which is nuts.

[07:16] Wow.

[07:17] It's nuts that it's still on.

[07:18] I mean, you know, in animation, you usually kind of go show to show to show,

[07:23] because everything usually gets canceled after a season or two.

[07:26] So, yeah, just it's a great run.

[07:29] It's a good job.

[07:31] I can't complain.

[07:32] I draw cartoons all day, basically.

[07:33] Right.

[07:34] And you actually helped Stern out a little bit right when they did their Family Guy Pinball Machine?

[07:39] Yeah.

[07:40] So back in 2006, Stern came to us.

[07:45] And wanted to pitch doing a Family Guy Pinball.

[07:48] And the woman at our studio who sort of handles all the licensing, marketing,

[07:55] type stuff, she came to me because she knew I was into arcade games.

[07:58] And at the time, I only had one pinball machine at the time.

[08:02] But she knew I was into that sort of thing.

[08:04] So she's like, hey, these guys from Stern Pinball, they're coming in.

[08:06] Do you want to meet with these guys?

[08:08] Do you want to be in on this meeting?

[08:09] I'm like, yeah, that sounds awesome.

[08:11] And again, this is before I was sort of hardcore into this as a pinball enthusiast, I suppose.

[08:21] But Gary Stern and Pat Lawler, they came to the studio and basically told us what they wanted to do.

[08:29] And Pat brought, you know, the game has a mini pinball machine.

[08:33] Do he plays his mini pinball with in the pinball?

[08:35] So Pat brought the little tiny parts.

[08:39] So he'd already started engineering this thing.

[08:42] And you know, and I don't know if this concept comes through in the final game,

[08:45] but his initial concept was that Stewie's mini pinball is his mind control invention

[08:51] and he's using it to control everyone's minds.

[08:54] But we kicked around ideas with them.

[08:56] And some of my ideas made it into the game, some of their ideas.

[08:59] We were kind of like, let's maybe do something else.

[09:02] It's still the greatest upper play field of all time.

[09:05] I think so.

[09:06] Oh, yeah.

[09:07] I mean, it's a full pinball within a pinball.

[09:10] And you know, granted the slings don't move or anything.

[09:13] But at the end of the day, the coolest thing about that mini pinball that I think some people forget is sort of its purpose.

[09:21] You know, you hit all the shots on the mini pinball, collect everyone's names.

[09:24] That starts Stewie multi ball where you're playing the upper, the mini pinball and the main pinball at the same time.

[09:30] And you have to alternate jackpot.

[09:32] So you got to hit Peter on the upper, hit Peter on the lower.

[09:35] And so I didn't know that.

[09:37] Yeah, it's a really, really cool.

[09:39] It's one of the most unique multi balls.

[09:41] And, uh, wow.

[09:42] You know, upper play field can actually have a purpose.

[09:45] I feel like now they just throw them on there to make the game sort of stand out.

[09:48] But all the recent ones I played like Erasmith and Game of Thrones, they just slow the game down.

[09:53] And I think they're just unnecessary in a way.

[09:56] Yeah, and those I'm not sure they really make sense.

[09:59] I really like it on Simpson's, Simpson's pinball party.

[10:02] That one's really good.

[10:04] I mean, I love Black Knight 2000.

[10:06] I mean, half the game is an upper play field on that.

[10:08] Right.

[10:09] White water.

[10:10] I mean, there's been some great, great upper play fields.

[10:12] But, uh, yeah, lately it just seems like, okay, what can we throw into the L.E.?

[10:16] Okay, upper play field.

[10:17] Right.

[10:18] You know, not sure it really works.

[10:21] So what year was family guy?

[10:23] That was 2006.

[10:25] Am I even born?

[10:26] 2007.

[10:27] We were working out in 2006.

[10:29] It came out around, uh, I believe March or April.

[10:33] 2007.

[10:34] So, um, so yeah, I ended up drawing and designing the, uh, the cabinet art and the translate art.

[10:41] And, um, and the game, the game, the machine was my paycheck, which, uh, you know, that, that, uh, sort of, that sort of got me headfirst into, yeah.

[10:51] I mean, I, like I said, I already had, I had a back to the future pinball machine that I already had.

[10:55] And, um, but this, this was my first kind of like more modern and new.

[11:00] So that was my first new and box, even though it actually didn't come in the box.

[11:04] The guys who delivered it, they, they opened it already.

[11:06] So, I think it's open that one.

[11:08] Right.

[11:09] Now, okay, so is that when you started getting into pinball in the sense like, okay, I've been working on it.

[11:15] When did you start like collecting?

[11:17] Um, well, I started collecting, you know, if we kind of go back in time, I think I started a little bit like you did, because you started with the arcade video games, right?

[11:25] Right.

[11:26] I'm more of a, I, I grew up with video games more and our kid games more than pinball.

[11:30] Like I, yeah, me too.

[11:31] Absolutely.

[11:32] I mean, we're the same age. You're 40, right?

[11:33] You just run 40.

[11:34] Um, so yeah, we, you know, we were that perfect age where we were like five or six years old and we looked up and saw Pac-Man, you know.

[11:41] Uh, so we grew up with that world.

[11:43] So we didn't, you know, we didn't really grow up with pinball.

[11:45] Now, I played it here and there, but, you know, I didn't understand, you know, roles I didn't understand.

[11:52] I didn't understand the point of it.

[11:53] I just, you know, flapped the, the, the, the flip around.

[11:55] You were like, get into, like, so when games like Adams family, right?

[11:59] When those games were popping like early 90s, like that was the fighting game era of arcades.

[12:03] Like, knowing, knowing gave a shit about Adams family, there's like Street Fighter 2.

[12:07] Yeah, I was playing.

[12:09] Yeah, I was going to the arcade to play Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat 2, all that stuff.

[12:13] Um, but I did, if, if I went to a place like, I remember a movie theater, I went to, they had a whole line up of pinball machines.

[12:19] And I remember loving Star Trek next generation.

[12:21] You know, I like the show, you walk up to that game, you see the gun, you see the cannons.

[12:25] Uh, you know, the music, the sound effects are really, really cool.

[12:27] Now, I didn't understand what I was doing, but at the time I really enjoyed it.

[12:31] So, of course, then when I eventually got into collecting pinball, that's one of the ones I wanted to get.

[12:35] But going back in time a little bit, I started collecting the arcade games around 2003.

[12:40] And, um, you know, going to auctions, there used to be these local auctions that were amazing.

[12:46] And this sort of doesn't happen anymore.

[12:48] So, like, this is sort of the difference between the, you know, quote unquote older collectors and the new collectors.

[12:54] Um, there was more that opportunity to find cheap and sometimes busted games and, and bring them home and learn, learn how to, how to fix them.

[13:03] So I sort of started there by collecting, you know, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Cuber, that sort of thing.

[13:08] A friend of mine that I met at the auctions were still good friends. He taught me how to solder.

[13:12] So I, I learned how to fix monitors.

[13:14] It's the most important skill I can't, I still can't figure out. I'm like, I hear the surface, and I hold the solder, dude.

[13:19] And I'm like, I'm just like burning my fingers. I need to figure, I need to take like a, yeah, the soldering class.

[13:23] But, yeah, or maybe even someone in New York would just, I mean, basically what, what my friend did is he just, um, he sat me down like a teacher.

[13:29] I had a Miss Pac-Man monitor I need to fix, and he's like, okay, you're gonna do, like, he didn't do it for me.

[13:35] He sat there as I did it and told me what to do. And it was just really generous that he did that.

[13:40] I can't learn it off of YouTube. I've watched like 20 YouTube videos on soldering, and I just, anyway, okay, so you got into that good error.

[13:49] And that was a good error because I think prices were great back then.

[13:52] Oh yeah, I never, I never spent more than, like on the arcade games, I never spent more than, than 300, and that was pushing it.

[13:59] I mean, I remember picking up, yeah, I got a Donkey Kong for a dollar. I got, I got a, a dedicated Mr. Dew for 50 bucks.

[14:06] So like, that's sort of what was happening. Just picking up games, picking up bulk buys, and selling the ones I didn't want, keeping the ones I wanted, and the hobby basically paid for itself.

[14:16] And then one of my sort of bulk buy situations I got into the, I remember, I just, I drove out to this town in the middle of Bumblefuck, and it was an old arcade operator and his son.

[14:27] They lived on the same block. And between both of their houses, they just had hundreds of games in the garage, in the house, in the backyard, and they were just trying to get rid of everything.

[14:34] So my friends and I, we went there, bought a bunch of games, and he had a, a back to the future pinball. I was like, ooh, that's cool.

[14:41] I mean, the reason I hadn't gotten into pinball yet, I mean, partially I didn't really understand it, but partially it was expensive and potentially scary to fix and repair.

[14:49] But I'm like, how much do you want for that back to the future? Oh, 300 bucks. So, you know, that was within my, my limit.

[14:55] So I brought home this back to the future and sort of tinkered with it, learned how to fix a little bit, and that sort of, you know, that, that's when the bug bit me.

[15:03] Going back to the family guy thing, sort of, you know, working with these guys and learning who they are and what they do.

[15:09] You know, I started researching more. I started learning about Pat Lawler, and that he did Adam's family in Twilight Zone and all these legendary games.

[15:16] And, yeah, and then while I was waiting for my game to be delivered, I was like, well, I want to get another game.

[15:22] So I picked up a Bram Stoker's Dracula. Stoker, not stoker, as you said sometimes. I had never pronounced it right.

[15:29] And so this was the first game I got that was just filthy dirty, everything was broken. It didn't even have glass. The glass was broken.

[15:36] The glass had broken already. So this was the first game where I went online. I started looking at all the repair tutorials and stuff like that.

[15:44] And I said, okay, I'm going to see if I can bring this thing back to life because it was just a dead, complete piece of shit.

[15:50] So took it apart, fixed everything that needed fixing, new rubber, new lights, new plastics, whatever it needed, new optos, put it back together.

[15:57] You know, and there's that moment of truth where you hit the, you flip the switch and holy shit, it works. It works. It's alive.

[16:05] And that was really satisfying to me. So part of what then my sort of collecting world or what brought me satisfaction, I mean obviously playing the games is really fun.

[16:15] But to find these sort of dead games out in the world that are just sitting there collecting dust and no one's getting enjoyment out of them, finding those and bringing them back to life was really, really fun to me.

[16:25] So I picked that up while I was waiting for my family guy to pin the show up. And I think I picked up a revenge from Mars also before it showed up.

[16:33] And then it was just snowballed from there. You know, those, those, yeah.

[16:37] You get bit and then it becomes like it is pinball the way it can take over. And it, it's really just, I don't even turn on my arcade games anymore.

[16:46] I'm so much, I just like, I've just sort of given up on arcade games because they're so repetitive.

[16:51] Our thing is that ball just has that, that fun chaos to it that makes every game interesting.

[16:58] Exactly. And I, you're going, I'm sorry. Well, I was going to say, yeah, I sold most of my, I mean, I still have a handful of our games, but as I kept getting pinballs, I kept selling them.

[17:07] And even though I did love them, I had them to stall before them. I realized like I had a dig dug, for instance. And dig dug is a great looking cabinet. I love the artwork. I love the game.

[17:15] But I didn't touch it for like two years. And like, you know what, if I really want to play dig dug, I'll just, you know, I can play it on my, you know, on a console or something.

[17:25] And yeah, just to your point about pinball, I always being, being so much more fun. I was playing Lord of the Rings this morning before, before, you know, before we started doing this.

[17:34] And I've had that game since 2008, you know, and I did something I'd never done before. I finished, I completed all three multi balls, which is something you need to do to get to Valor.

[17:45] I didn't get to Valor, but I did, you know, I've almost had this game for 10 years and I accomplished something that I've never done before.

[17:52] I'll never, I'll never get to Valor. Like ever. Back to you destroyed, did you ever destroy the ring though? Did you?

[17:58] Yeah, which is still one of the coolest. I love that game. I just, I still think Lord of the Rings is the greatest integration of a theme ever, ever.

[18:07] It's up there. Yeah. And and they're in back again. Just something about the way the music changes.

[18:12] Oh, it's beautiful. The pace. It's, yeah, there's like this majestic quality to that pinball machine that, I think a lot of new titles are trying to reach that ball.

[18:21] And when we hear like integration with theme, I still just go back to Lord of the Rings. I hope I would love Stern to vault edition it and add like better artwork and you know, it's a little pixelated and here and there.

[18:33] Oh, yeah, it would be a bar.

[18:34] It'd be the upgrade the upgrade the audio. Yeah, and actually what's kind of funny. I was going to say, you know, what, so when I started getting into this really sort of hardcore and meeting, meeting other collectors, meeting other players enthusiasts.

[18:46] People, the collectors who've been doing that, who'd been collecting for a while, they hated Stern games or at least like really sort of thumb, you know, stuck their noses up.

[18:57] You know, they, they wanted all the 90s, ballet Williams games and start to them Stern was just trash. They didn't care. And even when they would like Lord of the Rings is awesome. Right.

[19:07] So a lot of people did like suck up their collectors, not pride and by Lord of the Rings, but even then they'd be like, oh, the son, the side art and the, yeah, oh, the sound because I mean, you know, to give them credit, the sound quality of Stern white star was not as good as even the, you know, DCS.

[19:27] ballet Williams games from like the mid 90s. But you know, for me, it didn't detract for I mean the sound design on that game is so good and it's so fun. And like you said, the theme integration is so good.

[19:38] I could get past that, but a lot of people did not a lot of the collectors just Stern was a relevant. So it's really interesting now like the new collectors having like pure Stern collections.

[19:49] Right. You know, like like frolics, you just go down the road of like every Stern new inbox for the last like eight years and it's just like a line of it. So so Greg, in your collection right now, and then I want to start talking about what's going on present day.

[20:03] What's in your collection right now? Oh, geez, I want to go down the list. I mean, is it a lot? If it's a lot, you don't go down the list. I mean, how many have you got? I like 25 games. Okay. What's your favorite right now? Your favorite two that you turn on most frequently?

[20:17] Oh, man, I don't know. I mean, I mean, probably just because it's newest Hobbit, you know, the Hobbit. I've just been playing a lot because it's the newest I think. But I mean, I think my my what's funny is if I really had to think about it, I still think that the 90s Valley Williams games are superior just in terms of toys and mechanics and and just like you say that world under glass.

[20:43] But I do tend to play my stones a little bit more. So there's that whole thing where well, maybe that stuff doesn't matter if the games are really fun because I still love playing Tron. I still love playing AC DC and Metallica.

[20:55] Iron Man. I mean, like Lord of the Rings this morning. So yeah, it's that it's it's kind of that.

[21:03] I said the code keeps you coming back. So the code in certain games is what makes them have longevity where I think the Valley Williams games are they're more fun for for people who are being exposed to pinball for the first time. I think they're easier to explain and yes, and this and like just what's going on is right there. It's down on the play field. And you're not like, oh, here's how you stack.

[21:25] Exactly on AC DC. It's like right. Yeah, you see cares. You see the main. Yeah, you see like your main toy. I think I think George Gomez called it the dummy zone where you just you see one thing that's super obvious that if you know nothing about this game.

[21:41] You know, oh, I hit like medieval madness. Oh, there's Castle. I'm going to hit that castle.

[21:45] But to your point though about about you know depth being confusing. If you look at a game like AC DC. Yeah, that game has crazy deep code. But the cool. Here's what I love about Lyman's games.

[21:57] You don't have to you don't have to know that depth to enjoy the game. He makes these games for.

[22:04] But you can anyone at any level can play if you're totally casual. Oh, it's AC DC. I'm going to pick a song to rock out to. I'm going to hit the bell. I'm going to get the ball in the can and you know simple. Someone can have fun with it. If you're a little more.

[22:17] You know pinball knowledgeable. You look at the songs like mode. You're like, okay, I want to get through as many of those songs as I can and see if I can get to to the final on the core. And you can totally enjoy it on that level.

[22:27] But then if you're one of these tournament guys who are looking for exploits and crazy opportunities where you're approaching it like chess, you can do that too.

[22:36] To me, those are the best games where it works for anyone for any. Yeah, no, I agree. And I think that people kind of demand all three of those things. If you don't have a game that delivers on all three of those levels, I think people are don't want to shell out the money these games are costing.

[22:53] If doesn't have a lot of activity, doesn't have like the immediate appeal. Yeah, at the end of the day, I feel like if the game accomplishes.

[23:02] See, to me, the play field design and the co design have to work in tandem. So, you know, I don't I don't require every game to be super deep.

[23:12] Just as long as what's there kind of matches, you know, so you know Ironman is on the other end of the spectrum where Ironman, when Ironman came out again, the pinball enthusiasts and collectors thought it was a piece of shit.

[23:24] They hated it. They were like, oh, that's Austin, Austin powers remade. There's no modes. There's no depth. There's no toys. What the fuck is going on? And why would you buy this?

[23:33] I bought that game in 2010. I think when it came out was 2010. I think it was 2010. And I loved it because that simple code with that play field works so perfectly.

[23:45] And it's coming back. It's fast. It's brutal. And it's fun. I mean, it's totally fun. And people woke up to that after they stopped making it, which is why they called the addition the game and then everybody wanted one.

[23:57] Greg, well, before we go into the one game that I know is not in your collection right now, which is the big Lebowski, which is what you're very famous for right now waiting for your Lebowski.

[24:07] Let's talk a little bit about it. It's a lot of people. It's a lot of people. Let's talk about Pinside because I think Greg, you are probably one of the most prolific posters in Pinside history.

[24:18] I'm looking at stats here. I'm going to quit. I'm a numbers man. 14,821 posts you've created. So do you feel like you've got in your point across by now?

[24:34] Yeah, I can look guilty as charged. I can be repetitive about stuff. I can get into tips with people. I'd like to think I'm a little better lately, except for the Ghostbusters thing. I know a bunch of people want to fucking kill me about that.

[24:52] But yeah, I mean, I think if you go back and look at my, I mean, don't waste your time. But if you look back at a lot of my older posts, I mean, I think a lot of it is helping the new collectors, giving them advice about fixing things, giving them opinions about what games I think are fun.

[25:10] So look, another number that I want to call out in your favor is you have 30,347 upvotes and only 2353 downvotes, which gives you a ratio on Pinside a 92.8% approval rating.

[25:25] So you're doing something very good. I think Canada would have about 30,000 downvotes. So you are, I think you do contribute. And you are one of the personalities that is on Pinside frequently.

[25:37] And I think both of us sort of similarly, we spend a lot of time on this site. But you know, you get to the point where you can multitask with your life and your job.

[25:46] I have the same type of like work sort of flexibility where I can be doing my job, but be on Pinside with another window open all day long.

[25:53] Exactly. Yeah, I've got to work. I've got a sentiq. I draw on the sentiq and I've got another monogrow open for you know, iChats and whatever else is going on. And yeah, I, you know, I'll be drawing a scene. I want to take a little break. What's going on?

[26:07] You're like these mother. It's a mother fucking ghosted insert. God damn it.

[26:12] Well, let's talk about the Bowsky because this story is so current right now. And Greg, I know you've got the Bowsky number one.

[26:20] What? 56. 56. So you just missed the boat over here the first time. Literally the boat with the games I had had up to number 51.

[26:30] Oh, Jesus. Okay, so you that when that ship, when was that like September or August or?

[26:37] I think around August that last container. Maybe maybe yeah around there. It was last summer. Okay, so and everything was going fine.

[26:44] And so you're an early achiever on the Bowsky. So you were in like two years ago with these guys.

[26:49] 2014. So she's three. Okay, so we're on the we're into the third year.

[26:55] And so you're waiting, you're waiting and like everyone else, you realize your game was built. And when your game was built, you got the story that there were board issues, which I know created a lot of confusion for guys like you because you're like, wait a minute.

[27:11] If there's board issues, is that holding my game up where the boards put into my game? Are you are they going to take games out of boxes and put new boards and like when you heard that like what was the story that they were going to that was their story that was a bunch of games were boxed up.

[27:26] And they're like, oh, we have to unbox these games and fix all the board. And you know, it wasn't entirely implausible. That sounded like something that could happen. But part of me was skeptical. I was like, well, how come?

[27:38] You know, how come the first games that ship didn't have board issues or do they and are they going to get new boards? So, you know, I sat on it for a bit.

[27:48] So my dad go by, right? Munch go by. That's when months go by. And you know, they were really good about communication for a while. You'd always get these newsletters with updates and pictures and schedules and all this stuff. And then, yeah, months went by and it was just quiet. And every time I'd write to those guys. And they always write me back.

[28:04] But they would, but they would be really quiet. They would just say, oh, we have no new information. So that's why there's no new newsletters. Like, well, even within no new information, there's got to be some information that seems

[28:14] just weird to go so quiet. Right. But I mean, on the Chinese New Year's, give us something. What's going on on the boards? Like, there's, you know, there's a soldering issue. Like whatever it is. And so there was never any specific details around the board issue. Right. It was like just this general excuse. And then months are going by. Right.

[28:33] And then finally, the shit hits the fan about what like four weeks ago, about a three weeks ago when we learned that when the ARA letter. Yeah. Right. ARA. When ARA since a letter to people saying, hey, you know, we've got the games here. There's no board problems. We're just waiting to get paid. Right. And what went through your head when you saw that? I was like, fuck. Yeah.

[29:01] Pretty much. Because again, it's like, and we're still at the point where I'm not sure who to believe really, you know, both sides seem plausible. You know, but unfortunately, because Dutch was caught in a lie, that's what really set me off. Like, I've got patients, you know, I know sometimes you see what I'm writing on the forum and it looks like I'm a maniac. You know, sometimes that's just me being cathartic. I'm not really that amped up.

[29:28] You know, and I have patients to wait for this game. You know, I, I don't have a problem. You know, if it takes another year, I'm okay with that, but I don't like being lied to. I don't like being lied to. I don't like feeling like I've been taking taking advantage of my patients being taken advantage of. So that's, that's where where I really broke and was like, oh, well, I can't trust them now. I really need to find out what who's telling the truth, you know, that's what kind of broke down for me. But I mean, I, you know, if we go back in time a little bit, I always had faith in these

[29:58] guys. I know there's a lot of people who like, well, you shouldn't own better. Why don't you pre-order it? You idiot. You know, but if you go back in time, you know, when these pre-orders started, that was 2014, that was before J-Pop fell apart. That was before Skippy fell apart. And Dutch, you know, and Dutch, they had shown the right up in about 2.0 kit and they have licensed it. They created it. They shipped it. I've got it in my game. It's amazing. So they proved that they could license, create and ship

[30:28] a product, you know. So I had ultimate faith in them. To me, what they were up to, plus they brought the three prototypes to, to Expo, you know, when John Papadouk had an empty cabinet. Right. That they, there were no, there weren't any real huge red flags that these guys were full of shit. And I still don't think they're full of shit. I think they're, they're in a weird situation right now. Well, it's, it's, it's interesting because it's hard, right? I mean, I, it's hard to do. I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

[30:58] I, this, this, I, this, I, I, this, I, I, I, always Dr.

[31:00] feel gate when fill over there

[31:03] sort of

[31:04] remember that episode with fill was like uh...

[31:08] these guys are like

[31:10] forcing me to stay on i want out of this shit show and

[31:14] i'm getting all of a sudden people woke up in the head refunds on of their

[31:17] money and does you know what you would say and fill was like

[31:21] that was a red

[31:22] in retrospect that was a red flag to

[31:25] to some extent

[31:26] what i i remember hearing yop at uh... one of the expos and he

[31:30] was basically talking about universal

[31:34] feedback on the game and how they didn't realize that when the movie studio

[31:38] asked you to make a change that you actually had to do it he was like well

[31:42] we just were we're dutch

[31:44] we're dutch and when you say that in the Netherlands it just is like a

[31:46] suggestion but you don't have to follow it and part of me is just like

[31:50] i feel like he keeps playing that we're dutch card a lot in terms of how he's

[31:55] uh... how he handles

[31:57] sort of certain things and

[31:59] okay but we get to this year

[32:01] and right the lie

[32:04] the lying

[32:05] is the real issue i have because if you do have a party debate with the area in

[32:09] that in one corner dutch and the other

[32:12] who do you believe

[32:13] that the the only liar

[32:15] or the company that

[32:17] is hasn't

[32:18] who lied anybody they made the games they shipped them and so what i'm hearing

[32:22] now is this and and great let me know if you've heard differently but i'm

[32:25] hearing that

[32:27] dutch hasn't paid for any of the games that shipped yet

[32:30] that they paid for the development of the game and the way it worked is

[32:34] every time a game ships

[32:35] uh... they get they will get billed after

[32:38] i think a certain amount of games go out right so they got a bill from a

[32:42] r a for those first fifty that went out

[32:45] and that's when the shit hit the fan is when they got that bill it was for

[32:50] more than they had they say they were contractually obligated to pay per

[32:54] game

[32:55] and that's when a ray was like you haven't paid for these fifty yet

[33:00] we're holding on to these other forty we just made

[33:03] and that's where they're at it's like a mexican standoff now well again we we

[33:06] we don't really know if that information is true yet and i mean we talked about

[33:09] this through email already that the

[33:12] the person you got that information from

[33:15] that same person was trying to buy my game and

[33:19] like

[33:21] guilt me into selling

[33:23] my game to him

[33:24] uh... and then he's sending that information to someone else

[33:28] yeah and i want to go into the name of the book that's i've been really

[33:31] it's like

[33:32] but i like that drama that's i like that you brought that up because there is a

[33:36] shady underbelly of this whole hobby

[33:39] where people are really trying to sneak in front of people when they know

[33:43] information

[33:45] and get them

[33:46] either to sell your spot like

[33:48] he Greg it's not gonna happen man sell your spot to me

[33:52] meanwhile they might have information that shows stuff

[33:54] is getting crack

[33:56] so that they've got your spot now

[33:58] uh... i think when i went in on magic girl i can't tell

[34:02] if when i bought mine

[34:04] if people knew good or bad things and we're just unloading it

[34:09] uh... i know that you know that

[34:11] yeah i know it feels like trying like

[34:14] share information that's not validated so i'll i offered yop and bury a chance

[34:18] to come on my podcast and clarify and

[34:21] yops response to me was you were your shows negative canada and i was like

[34:25] dude

[34:26] my shows not

[34:27] negative it's i'm critical in people fucking lie

[34:31] and sometimes sometimes news

[34:34] is negative just by its very nature right

[34:37] if you're talking about negative news

[34:39] is that being negative or is that just talking about wall what if i did

[34:43] what offended me personally was that yop is sort of taking the stance like i

[34:48] don't want to deal with the negativity and it's like bro you lied to your buyers

[34:52] like you're gonna have to deal with the arrows now a little bit and i and i think

[34:57] that it's not i think it's

[35:00] if we had spoken

[35:01] earlier in the week

[35:03] i probably would be right with you going yeah but but but

[35:06] we had this news that the

[35:08] like the head director guy a r a was fired and

[35:12] right now

[35:14] you know i talked i talked to berry last week and uh...

[35:17] we had a nice conversation

[35:19] and he he talked to the the the guy that fired

[35:23] rene and

[35:24] they're meeting with uh... they're meeting with they're all meeting together

[35:28] next week so

[35:29] talks are back on and that's extremely positive i mean again who knows what's

[35:32] gonna happen

[35:33] it's purely speculation at this point

[35:35] but that but the fact that this very at least for

[35:38] all the people about the game this is a very lucky

[35:42] thing that happened because otherwise they might still they might not

[35:45] ever talk again

[35:46] right and and that's positive and

[35:48] and i agree because when when i was at

[35:51] texas pinball festival in the op said

[35:54] he basically said like our lawyers is telling us to wait it could be a month it

[35:57] could be a year

[35:59] and when when he said that i mean that he's like you must have like

[36:02] sunk back in your chair and be like

[36:05] shit like

[36:06] you know i'm like like i want to say

[36:09] i i email them i'm like guys

[36:11] final straw this is bullshit just give me a refund i'm out and you'll never

[36:14] hear from me again

[36:15] i'm done like

[36:17] you know and uh... and

[36:19] they said what we can get refunds we have to

[36:21] wait and see this out we're gonna try to get your game

[36:24] and i said

[36:26] give me a refund or i'm gonna start looking i'm gonna start poking around and

[36:29] looking for

[36:31] more information to find out what the truth of the situation is

[36:34] right you know i told him you dangled that

[36:36] notion that you were gonna contact universal right in the end i'm gonna

[36:40] matter you

[36:41] yeah i said i'm gonna contact universal to because

[36:44] and people like well well why would you do that that's just going to blow the

[36:46] whole thing up they don't give a fuck their multi-billion dollar

[36:49] company would have a guy should have a guy said that

[36:51] yeah you said that no a lot of people were saying it

[36:54] and also i think people misunderstood what my goal was my goal wasn't to

[36:58] to to be the bomb you know or a bomb i wasn't planning on just

[37:02] blowing this up

[37:04] i wrote them a very simple

[37:06] uh...

[37:07] a very simple email it didn't have any of the drama in it i just basically said

[37:10] i

[37:11] this is who i am

[37:12] i'm a customer of this you know i bought this game

[37:15] i'm just curious if you're still in touch with them if you've uh... if you know

[37:18] if you've heard

[37:20] you know uh... why that why the games have been shipped in they got right back to

[37:23] me again they're like

[37:24] they were

[37:25] extremely concerned they said oh we want to make sure that you get your game in

[37:29] that

[37:30] everything is right in the world here so um...

[37:33] yeah so i didn't go

[37:34] i didn't go about it in a negative way i went about it

[37:37] simply and

[37:38] professionally and

[37:40] got results

[37:41] uh... at least in terms of of uh...

[37:44] you know

[37:45] i think people are like paranoid

[37:48] whenever they hear like we're gonna call the license that it's like skit be in

[37:52] predator or over again

[37:54] but that was an entirely different thing

[37:55] of course he never had the list of course so

[37:59] alright so

[38:00] i think we're at this point now right where it's like fingers crossed like

[38:03] berries going to meet with a ray there's really nothing left to speculate other

[38:08] than that meeting happening and i was getting

[38:11] yeah you know report back from very on how when

[38:15] exactly yet this point

[38:16] uh...

[38:17] yeah there's no reason

[38:19] i mean look i understand people are still worried and skeptical and and what

[38:22] have you but

[38:23] at this point it doesn't make sense to keep

[38:27] it you know at least from my you know my point of view

[38:30] you know i'm not gonna keep exploding like i don't have

[38:33] really anything else to

[38:35] offer now that the situation

[38:38] has happened and could lead to

[38:40] a good solution

[38:42] so

[38:43] let's talk about

[38:45] the world of of of pre-ordering and and pain because i think pre-ordering and

[38:48] pain sort of goes

[38:50] goes hand in hand more times than not and

[38:53] but the

[38:55] you know the notion that like when a company shows machine and they need

[38:59] buyers to sort of be like the early investors for the company that was

[39:02] the most probably the most popular way for new pinball companies to get off

[39:05] the ground we saw it with how the pinball we saw it was to be we got sought

[39:08] with dutch

[39:10] uh... you know we didn't really see it with spooky but those those guys like

[39:13] they sort of walked before they ran they and i think they were the only ones

[39:17] who sort of

[39:18] did it right when you're trying to start a pinball company

[39:22] um...

[39:23] but what what are your thoughts now on on this notion of

[39:27] buying a game before a company

[39:30] you know really has its legs underneath them do you think it's dead or you

[39:33] think people still

[39:34] like if dutch i think dutch like when they announced game two people are like

[39:37] what the fuck are you doing like

[39:39] i think people are really skeptical more than ever

[39:42] about ever giving companies money before the the game is on the line

[39:47] yeah i mean i think it's generally

[39:49] dead people say all there's always collectors of a lot of money who will

[39:52] throw money at anything but you have to look at the context of why these

[39:55] pre-orders

[39:56] all started in the first place

[39:58] because if you go back to around two thousand ten

[40:00] that's when start you know what's what again it's funny that

[40:03] it was because games like iron man and tron that

[40:06] stern was almost

[40:08] dead

[40:09] you know because the collectors did not want those games

[40:12] so jersey jack decided to start his company to make a product for

[40:17] the type of pinball collector who wanted more fully featured games

[40:20] uh... so basically a lot of these things

[40:23] popped up because

[40:25] of stern almost going away stern you know fear theoretically not offering

[40:30] what customers wanted

[40:32] uh... but then you had this weird thing where stern then

[40:35] some of their games

[40:37] like acdc

[40:38] back in black and tron ellie

[40:40] started selling for a shitload of money after the fact

[40:43] so then you you saw you know that's when you saw j pop

[40:46] pop up and you saw skipy pop up when they went when they said oh collectors

[40:51] want

[40:52] they want to buy something that could be the next acdc

[40:55] ellie or the next big bang bar

[40:57] and they sort of

[40:59] use that

[41:00] psychology

[41:01] to get people to give them a lot of money but but it was before they even had

[41:06] like with in john's

[41:07] i remember when john announced magic girl

[41:10] there was there was nothing there was barely a concept there was nothing you

[41:13] know and even years later we we i mean you know not to reiterate the story but

[41:16] we know he didn't have a whitewood he he literally had nothing

[41:19] um...

[41:21] but but people wanted that

[41:22] there was there's a there's a thirst

[41:25] i mean i i still think so today

[41:28] these guys are starving there's starving for games there's a reason why

[41:32] but you have a lot of choice now you've got stern

[41:35] you know

[41:36] with with games people want

[41:37] multiple games per year

[41:39] you've jersey jack exists now yes he's

[41:41] slower than he

[41:42] uh... thought he was going to be

[41:44] but you can still get a was revise you can still get a hobbit those are

[41:47] yeah i would get your game i still think i still think right though and i

[41:51] there's more available yes but i still think

[41:55] i still think like there's this allusion that there's more to choose from

[41:59] the new really is right now it's it's still predominantly stern games

[42:03] um... the rest of the manufacturers have they've struggled to get games out

[42:09] in volume and with a cadence

[42:12] that satiate that satiate these guys that just have money burning a hole in

[42:17] their pocket and

[42:18] and that is what j pop saw that's what kevin saw all these guys saw it

[42:23] that wow like a tron

[42:25] which is like when you look at tron ellie even now it compared to like ghost

[42:28] busters and batman

[42:30] it looks so

[42:32] barren and photoshopped and but

[42:34] man that game in box is like six grand and it was selling for like twelve

[42:38] thousand less than that dude

[42:39] i i pre-order to tron ellie

[42:41] i think with

[42:42] a shaker

[42:44] for fifty three fifty

[42:45] wow and they were and immediately immediately right they were selling for

[42:49] double that

[42:50] and more immediately it was it was a slow build but

[42:53] uh... but yet to remember to date they only made four hundred of them and

[42:57] there wasn't a premium

[42:58] so you know the whole premium ellie thing started with i think acdc

[43:03] where

[43:04] the premium in the ellie had the same features so if you missed out on the

[43:07] ellie

[43:08] you could still get the premium and feel like you know you got the same game

[43:11] when we saw that i i it's it's interesting that stern never really figured

[43:14] out that i think what made tron ellie so

[43:17] limited was the fact that there was like a dot pump multi-ball only available

[43:21] with the ellie

[43:23] and i'm shocked that stern hasn't made

[43:26] anything with the code be

[43:28] exclusive to the ellies or any exclusive mechanisms really for the ellie

[43:33] because the premium

[43:34] to in my book

[43:36] really makes the ellie sort of pointless unless you're a guy that just wants

[43:40] the artwork

[43:41] and a little bit of a different trim

[43:43] uh... but they're selling them there's sell in them and there are there's

[43:46] a lot of

[43:47] personally i think you know i think that the

[43:50] the way they do things now is

[43:52] uh... with the three models

[43:54] for me anyway i think it's great i don't think that ellie in the premium should

[43:57] have any fundamental gameplay differences

[44:00] um... you know because i think uh...

[44:03] yeah a lot of the times that you know the collector types they just want

[44:06] something that's a little different you know like with ghostbusters you get a

[44:09] a new our package you get the

[44:12] green shrimp or you know a lot of times games that have a

[44:15] mirrored backlash or in the case of a copy of the master puppets theme which is

[44:18] a little different

[44:20] but uh...

[44:21] yeah i you know i mean back like you know i've got master puppets limited edition

[44:26] but back then

[44:28] the ellie was only about uh...

[44:31] eight hundred more than the premium

[44:33] so it was kind of like

[44:35] you know you will say they're leaving money on the table to me

[44:38] you don't know if you're leaving money on the table until the game is good

[44:41] and gets a reputation

[44:42] that makes people want to buy it like tron no one gives you about tron when it

[44:45] came out

[44:46] then they played it

[44:46] then it got a reputation then it went up in price

[44:49] it's not necessarily

[44:50] and use you you mentioned that a lot on the inside and

[44:54] i mean i think what's weird about the market

[44:56] now though

[44:58] is the complete opposite is happening

[45:01] like these games are well stern is just baking in

[45:05] the the

[45:06] sort of like the second hand market into the price of the game initially now right

[45:10] so for yet well spatio something like that

[45:13] yet let's talk batman super early i don't think about

[45:16] like ten grand for the ellie fifteen for the super ellie

[45:19] and then it's like

[45:22] there's no the games not even great you know it's not i went i went but uh...

[45:27] yesterday went to a local there's a local place near me

[45:30] they've got a an arosmith pro

[45:32] next to

[45:33] a batman

[45:35] i think it's a premium i'm not sure i mean you know they'll play the same so

[45:38] care

[45:40] and i i played arosmith a bunch and i i i played batman and it's

[45:44] arosmith play so much better there's so much more going on at the game at

[45:48] at least the moment you know

[45:49] hopefully the code will get around batman but

[45:52] yet i i think i think

[45:53] lineman to release a game

[45:55] batman the way people think he's going like i don't know i just don't see

[45:58] i don't see the shots there i really don't i mean i know that he'll make it

[46:02] better for sure

[46:04] um...

[46:04] but he doesn't have those shots to work with like you did with like

[46:08] yet i think it's

[46:10] i think it's clunky i think that turned table devices every time you hit at the

[46:13] ball kind of hops and skips

[46:15] right uh... and it's kind of a visual mess to it's it's it's really cluttered

[46:19] you know that the toy box on arosmith i think is one of the stern greatest

[46:23] toys ever

[46:24] and yeah it's what it's a combination

[46:26] it's a combination of two great toys on

[46:30] from

[46:31] mediocre games you know that the fling through the air was from stern's nba

[46:35] and that was a great trick on that game nobody played that game so they made

[46:37] like three hundred of them

[46:39] but uh... you want to have a rare there's a rare game nobody cares about

[46:42] but that it would it would fling the ball through the air and a magnet would

[46:45] grab it on the basketball net

[46:46] or on the basketball thing and drop it through the net

[46:49] great trick and then the box was from indiana jones the

[46:53] stern's indiana jones they had the arc and when you started multi-ball

[46:56] the arc opened up and all the balls tumble about so what board did was he took

[46:59] two of his toys

[47:00] and combined together into a really cool new

[47:03] toy even though

[47:04] you know we saw it but it's

[47:06] to mediocre games making one phenomenal experience with arosmith i mean i i i

[47:11] think it's absolutely when i jumped on arosmith pro at tpf i really i came

[47:15] away from that show being like

[47:17] this pin is fifty two hundred bucks

[47:20] with an LCD

[47:21] dirty donny artwork which is some of the best art on any machine ever this

[47:25] amazing toy

[47:27] great sound for fifty two hundred and i kind of was like

[47:31] it made everything else

[47:33] seem overpriced

[47:34] seem kind of silly

[47:36] and look if stern comes out with like a star wars pro

[47:40] for like six grand with everything in it

[47:44] good luck good luck highway good luck

[47:48] you know to the competitors out there who

[47:51] you know i i think are gonna struggle because turns gonna get that machine

[47:54] out in rapid fire come june july

[47:57] yet what in today's market and again this is why what stern did with the three

[48:00] tears of of games

[48:02] even though a lot of complainers or complainers a lot of

[48:05] collectors complained about it

[48:07] it really is brilliant because it just from a business standpoint because you've

[48:11] got the lower priced option for those

[48:13] for for operators or for those who just don't want to spend as much

[48:16] then you've got the other versions for people who

[48:18] are willing and able to spend more and and no other company

[48:22] has that lower

[48:24] priced option

[48:26] and what's great with it you know something like arosmith pro

[48:30] you could you can play like you don't feel like you're playing a stripped down

[48:33] game you're playing a legit

[48:35] new modern arcade pinball machine

[48:37] uh... and it's cheap it's cheaper than anyone else can offer so you know stern has

[48:41] that

[48:42] kind of uh... they've got that ace where other other companies don't have right

[48:47] you know what do you think about i want to get your opinions growing on some of

[48:50] the other manufacturers and what they have sort of coming to market soon

[48:54] uh... that's a spooky and i was good to think of that theme do you think they

[48:58] can they're going to sell five hundred at sixty three hundred bucks a pop

[49:01] non-refundable deposits

[49:04] i mean i think i can have to actually see the only show the

[49:07] like that artwork right yet and translate artwork possibly yet

[49:11] so i mean i really can't

[49:13] i mean i don't know what i can say about i mean look i really like the guys at

[49:16] spooky i like

[49:17] i like charlie i like then

[49:19] um...

[49:20] you know i i wish they would make a game i i wanted

[49:22] to buy because i like them and they clearly

[49:25] uh... have the capability to make these games so it'll be interesting to see if

[49:29] you know this new game kind of uh...

[49:32] you know they're kind of learning curve at the first few games results in

[49:35] something

[49:36] at least in my opinion a little more interesting on this game i'm not an

[49:39] Alice Cooper fan but um... i'd like their approach where they're kind of

[49:43] making him a character like alvira you know where

[49:46] you know it's not uh...

[49:47] it's about like getting out of the nightmare castle it's not yet great as

[49:51] hits like alas Cooper's on tour and here's like his hands on that you like now

[49:55] he's the he's the mad scientist and i'm assuming

[49:58] the game will have kind of uh...

[50:01] monster basher scared stiff sort of uh...

[50:03] vibe to it i would imagine right so that could be cool i mean but

[50:07] until i see it i really can't uh...

[50:10] i don't know if the wall said uh... right

[50:12] what i think what's going to be challenging for spooky this time around and

[50:16] and i think they know this is

[50:19] to release five hundred of them so that they lose that sort of scarcity is

[50:23] what drives people to buy when it was like one fifty america's on it right

[50:27] and three hundred rob zombies so five hundred is a lot for a spooky machine

[50:32] uh... the not a lot there's a magic there's a magic number

[50:36] that makes people gamble on a game

[50:38] i mean that's why we said you know batman at fifteen thousand

[50:42] is in my opinion absolutely ridiculous but

[50:45] with only eighty

[50:47] there's eighty people who will say fuck it

[50:49] i'll give them that much for that game

[50:51] right and i look at eighty

[50:53] probably wasn't the ceiling maybe was a hundred unit you don't know right

[50:57] means during claims they got four hundred applications for it i don't know if

[51:01] i believe them

[51:02] but here's thing with spooky five hundred to me is a lot for them and

[51:06] non-refundable deposits also changes the game because a lot of guys went into

[51:10] rob zombie like i did

[51:12] with the intentions of just flipping it because it's refundable all just all

[51:16] just put an order down i'll give them a thousand bucks

[51:19] and then i'll just watch the market on it if people are flipping for more than

[51:23] they pay the great

[51:25] i i'm gonna make some money on this if they're not i'll just get my money back

[51:29] and spookies out of sale

[51:32] charlie i like what they're doing with allowing customers to customize the

[51:35] machines

[51:36] and that's his rationale for non-refundable is you're going to be able to order

[51:39] exactly the way you want it

[51:41] uh... and that way we can have you just like ask for your money back at the

[51:45] eleventh hour because we've ordered the parts to make your game the way you

[51:48] want it

[51:49] we know it's gonna have to ramps finally so he's they need to up their game i've

[51:54] said it before they need to be at least where stern pro is

[51:57] to get people

[51:58] uh... to justify you know these sixty three hundred bucks i mean it's it's a

[52:03] competitive landscape and i i there's only so much you can

[52:08] just be the small guy people like and want to support before people want the

[52:12] games to be as good as the people who make them

[52:15] and and and i and i think they know that i think charlie and better

[52:19] are working hard to make this game sing

[52:21] the marketer in me though is spooky if i can give him any advice would be

[52:25] i think they're pigeonhole the little bit in this whole like

[52:28] you know like spookies

[52:30] sort of

[52:31] likes

[52:31] like heavy metal scary theme like mits all like the same category

[52:37] and i and i don't know how

[52:39] long they can go in that sandbox before it's like

[52:43] you know maybe just make a really good jetsons game and everyone would want

[52:47] it like doesn't doesn't line up with your spooky theme per se

[52:51] right

[52:52] i i think there's room outside of that category for them to find buyers and

[52:57] i know charlie's making the games he wants to make but he needs i think he

[53:02] also needs to start making games that

[53:04] people just

[53:05] died of have like if you make big trouble in little china i'd buy it i don't

[53:08] give you a pair

[53:10] i would have a think that would fit with their theme um...

[53:13] but i think uh...

[53:14] again i think when they started their um...

[53:17] sort of their company in their concept

[53:20] you know stern steered clear of those horror things really wasn't until walking

[53:24] dead that they kind of

[53:26] uh... embraced it and jersey jack is

[53:28] full on family friendly type

[53:31] uh... themes but the the sort of scary horror

[53:35] genre

[53:36] it has been really popular in pinball i mean you got

[53:38] you know monster bastard at the way you can addams family addams family could be

[53:41] a spooky game in terms of

[53:43] vibe so you know they're looking for a market that

[53:46] once

[53:47] there there's a market for that sort of thing

[53:49] yet and when i saw everyone lining up for a via a tpf i was like shit like

[53:54] this is way more popular than i ever thought it it was uh...

[53:58] well let's go down to highway pinball which is next on the big it's because they're

[54:03] kind of similar to dutch in the sense that

[54:05] they announced early

[54:07] people have waited a couple years

[54:10] they shipped full throttle similar to like how dutch shipped bob two point out

[54:14] so there's a lot of confidence that they would deliver

[54:17] uh... here we are april twenty seven

[54:21] and what are your thoughts like you you know exactly what's going on with them

[54:24] right now so what your thoughts on on it all get it out

[54:27] well i don't know exactly what's going on but i get just offer my

[54:30] perspective of what i witnessed uh... just you know it's a go to

[54:34] there were a few years where i was going to every chicago expo so i was seeing

[54:38] and your eyeway there every year and talk to him and seeing his presentations

[54:42] and the thing that

[54:44] kind of bumped me on them was that originally

[54:46] they were going to be the

[54:48] european stern that was kind of their

[54:51] their goal they had the factory and they they said they were going to make

[54:54] a free of us three or four games per year right

[54:57] and then and then we get to

[54:59] two thousand fourteen

[55:01] where they announce alien

[55:02] but again on and that was the year uh...

[55:05] yeah that was to the two thousand fourteen right i think that's the

[55:07] announced a lane

[55:08] and that was the year libousky brought perlabousia

[55:11] that's brought three

[55:12] libousky prototypes

[55:14] and andrew

[55:16] announces alien

[55:17] sort of in a j pop weight with nothing he has nothing he doesn't have a

[55:21] white would he bear he claims that it's not been designed but doesn't really

[55:25] have much of a design to show

[55:27] and i'm kind of thinking what were those four games per

[55:30] year okay but no okay to do an alien he says it's going to be out in april

[55:33] two thousand fifteen

[55:35] and you know now we're in two thousand seventeen

[55:38] again where is that original business plan of four games per year if there were

[55:42] some

[55:43] you know which is the ladies

[55:45] which have you

[55:46] well and uh... which also Greg like the four games per year

[55:50] was to justify

[55:53] the swappable playfield model that he built his whole company around

[55:57] right but my point is that if if you if you was designing all these games and

[56:01] as a factory ready to go

[56:02] and and needs workers to work and and games to sell

[56:06] why haven't those other games jump the line why didn't those games come up

[56:09] before

[56:10] aliens that's the thing that always i found really you know the answer to that is

[56:14] you know

[56:15] is obviously there were there were no other games being

[56:19] worked on a design now i know berry has to find three or four

[56:22] see i hear like berry has designed three or four games for andrew

[56:26] but but a cat design of a game

[56:28] and a game actually being physically worked on with white woods and with

[56:32] coders and and designers

[56:34] making next

[56:35] that's a different story you know then just a cat design

[56:40] i think what i think what andrew did incorrectly again i think other people have

[56:43] done it too

[56:45] is your when you announce to early and you and i i remember i brought this up

[56:49] and i think orcs at something along the lines up

[56:52] they did it just to stay relevant and so

[56:56] it's kind of like a head scratching move it's like

[56:58] alright so you announce this triple a title

[57:01] and when he did he clearly didn't even have the right license for the game

[57:06] he right he didn't have

[57:08] he didn't have just sharp on board at that point or i just i Roger sharp

[57:12] and

[57:13] you know

[57:14] so going weaver and and those things he didn't have

[57:18] like what you think you would need to make the right kind of alien game and

[57:23] and i know he had to go back and renegotiate a lot of the license and

[57:27] uh... you work with licensing and family guy now

[57:30] for the life of me Greg i can't figure this one thing out

[57:33] the

[57:34] le art work continues to be

[57:36] delayed and stalled and the early adopters are the guys who put money down for

[57:41] elis and they still haven't seen what their game is

[57:44] and he keeps saying he's waiting for fox approval

[57:48] how many months does it take months or weeks

[57:51] if someone's licensing a family guy making an item that's family guy based

[57:56] for you guys to give approval on something

[57:59] well in their care i can't speak to what happens with them but you know when

[58:03] you're dealing with an old

[58:04] movie with a lot of

[58:06] you know the actors and directors and everyone moved on to do different things

[58:09] and producers

[58:10] it probably does take a little longer because they

[58:13] there's so many

[58:16] so but there's no actors there's no actors at all in the artwork on anything

[58:19] that's artisans the theoretically the things that they well there they're

[58:23] in the video for a giant car that

[58:25] but at least with us though we're you know we're still in production

[58:28] uh... we're hands-on are people in the studio we we do all pretty much all the

[58:33] artwork if we don't

[58:35] we approve it or make notes on it

[58:37] from

[58:38] yeah it's pretty quick they

[58:40] they say we're doing this app

[58:42] um...

[58:43] here's here's here's some of the assets were assets working on so uh...

[58:48] it's not months and here's the part that i just again like i know i

[58:51] bang this drum but i just i wish more people would ask these questions because

[58:55] i think what it does it exposes

[58:58] uh... it it just exposes the fact that like

[59:01] these manufacturers lied to people right they lie all the time and people let

[59:06] them get away with it because all they want is their precious pinball machine

[59:10] but if they would just ask simple questions i think you start to see the

[59:13] tips of certain icebergs that you kind of want to avoid

[59:17] if you're getting ready to give people money and so here's a thing to

[59:21] you artwork that they are using on alien

[59:26] all that artwork

[59:27] is assets that are pre-approved by fox for them to use right there's nothing

[59:32] being hand drawn here

[59:35] it's simply them laying out in different

[59:38] order you know in in in in different design layout

[59:41] the pre-approved assets that that they were given so

[59:46] that would not take months to get approved there there's no way so

[59:50] might that's that's the thing i mean we're just speculating here i i i i don't

[59:55] know why things took so long

[59:56] uh... we we were told in november the ellies are going to ship in in

[01:00:00] january so when that was said

[01:00:03] well get he said they were going to they were all going to ship in two thousand

[01:00:06] fifteen so i mean

[01:00:07] it is what it is at this point it

[01:00:10] it it's people just it's it's it's it's it's you think people reach that point

[01:00:14] Greg and you probably do with about you just read the point where like you

[01:00:16] waited so long you just don't give a shit anymore you're like whatever

[01:00:20] some people i'm sure um

[01:00:23] and get at least for me

[01:00:24] with what about ski it's such a

[01:00:27] specifically weird situation where

[01:00:29] it's one of my favorite all-time movies and i'm sure that alien people are

[01:00:32] saying the same thing

[01:00:33] it's one of my favorite movies uh... weird coen brothers movie from

[01:00:37] the late nineties

[01:00:39] whoever thought this would get made into a bumball machine

[01:00:41] so you know i normally wouldn't

[01:00:44] be pre-ordering with uh...

[01:00:46] sort of unknown companies but you know and this one i just uh...

[01:00:50] i had to do it i had to do it

[01:00:52] i'd kick myself if i didn't do it

[01:00:54] uh... and that and that's why you know we've been talking on email to psych

[01:00:59] you just you

[01:01:00] re re-fun wouldn't work for you i don't think on it

[01:01:03] ever

[01:01:04] you'd call you know i wouldn't say that if but you'd forever

[01:01:07] kick yourself if it came out and someone had like

[01:01:11] like if hilton had game number fifty six

[01:01:14] you know you'd be like

[01:01:15] uh... like i was again it's it's

[01:01:17] it's two thousand seventeen things are uh... you know

[01:01:20] uh... the difference three years makes is crazy

[01:01:24] i mean look at ghost busters one of my all-time dream themes

[01:01:27] and i passed on it um... transformers was one of my dream themes i had the game

[01:01:33] i wasn't entirely happy with it i sold it so i've had dream themes that

[01:01:37] remind remind me why you passed on ghost busters was it just the brutality of the

[01:01:40] game

[01:01:41] well like i was saying earlier to me that the play field and the code

[01:01:45] need to

[01:01:45] to mesh

[01:01:47] and i felt like well uh... to me the brutality of the game

[01:01:50] it isn't just your

[01:01:52] average joe brutality so a lot of people they say well i love playing iron man and

[01:01:56] that can kicks my ass

[01:01:57] but in the case of iron man

[01:01:59] monger comes up

[01:02:00] you shoot him

[01:02:02] the reaction that happens is from the thing you just did so if he launches it down

[01:02:06] the middle with the magnet you took that risk my problem with ghost busters is

[01:02:10] almost everything you do

[01:02:12] flings the ball down the middle or comes down

[01:02:14] it comes out of the pops down the middle so you keep losing

[01:02:18] not due to

[01:02:20] skill reasons but because the game just fucking hates you

[01:02:23] uh... but i probably yeah but i probably would have gone ahead with my order had

[01:02:27] the whole uh... play field uh...

[01:02:30] ghosting thing not happened you know that that that was you know that was a huge

[01:02:34] deal last year

[01:02:35] and you know i ordered the one of the one of the pre-order start march i think

[01:02:39] yeah i was it was it was like early spring

[01:02:43] so my game was still delayed until september because of the whole play field

[01:02:46] thing and they said that the uh...

[01:02:48] the uh... the play fields

[01:02:50] the premium play fields they had it fixed right

[01:02:53] and then i saw two uh...

[01:02:55] brand new premiums that both had ghosting pretty much right out of the box so

[01:02:59] that point is like forget it you know it

[01:03:02] you know and a lot of people are telling me you got to tweak the game you got to

[01:03:05] do all the stuff to the game to make it play better

[01:03:07] and i'll give them that you know me ripping on the game a lot of it has to do

[01:03:10] with

[01:03:11] what happened with the play fields but also just not liking the design

[01:03:15] right i don't like i don't like the linear code i think even if you

[01:03:19] tweak it i just don't think i'm gonna like it if people like it that's great

[01:03:22] you know i'm i'm gonna shut up but i'm gonna shut up about the game on the site

[01:03:25] just people like the game it's selling great

[01:03:28] good for them but for me it was a dream theme

[01:03:30] that didn't quite

[01:03:31] yeah no i i i'm in the same boat is you i ordered the same time you did i was in

[01:03:35] on an ellie and every time i kept playing it i just got so tired of the unfair

[01:03:40] whether the ball just kept hopping over the out lanes or the straight down the

[01:03:44] middle the the flipper gap to me though see to me that's the deal breaker because i'm

[01:03:48] like you know what on some level

[01:03:51] gerry stern george gome is you know these experts have had to make a great

[01:03:55] pinball machine need to walk over and say hey john

[01:03:58] what the fuck is this like this is the most popular theme zombie

[01:04:03] Eddie did the most amazing our package and you've got your

[01:04:06] widest gap ever on a game that's supposed to be

[01:04:10] for you know bring in casuals and bring in fans of this theme

[01:04:14] and people will say that he does it on all of games they're like well no one

[01:04:17] complained on creature yeah well played on this i those games have entirely

[01:04:20] different geometry and entirely different rules

[01:04:23] um nobody likes that guy but nobody likes it on any of his games that's the

[01:04:27] thing it's like this thing you just have to accept and well i love kongo

[01:04:32] i've it's never bothered me on kongo because the geometry and the rules of the

[01:04:36] game don't make it an issue on it it's like a half an inch

[01:04:41] bigger on ghost buses and yeah that's true so i heard i was asking zombie Eddie

[01:04:46] and i heard like because i know he's working with trot on the next one and he

[01:04:49] said no flipper gap so i'm like finally

[01:04:51] fine you know it's crazy i got to tell you some funny so when i was playing

[01:04:54] arosmith uh yesterday so you know in ghost busters have you heard that that

[01:04:59] scare feature where to scream super super loud yeah okay so

[01:05:03] so i i hadn't heard it before right so i'm i'm playing arosmith someone else is

[01:05:06] playing ghost busters that scream happens

[01:05:09] scares the shit out of me and i lose my ball on arosmith that that's what a

[01:05:12] cheap draining game ghost busters is it makes a different game yeah it makes

[01:05:16] other games right i love that scream though could see to me that's the kind of

[01:05:20] code like sort of little quirkiness that that i think needs to be in more

[01:05:25] pinball games i really you know i'm i'm hoping on star wars i keep saying it

[01:05:31] when you shoot the death star you have to get like one shot with all the lights

[01:05:35] on and then it needs to say like it turns off all the lights and say use the

[01:05:39] forest and it has to be with no electronics going it's

[01:05:41] they need to do something like that but they they won't because

[01:05:44] i'm prepared to be underwhelmed with star wars now let's talk quickly so

[01:05:49] there's already there's already what for uh there's already four star wars

[01:05:52] games out there so you've got your pick i know are you a star wars fan

[01:05:56] not at all not in the way good so you get the message so out of all the new

[01:06:00] titles coming out and and we'll go through this quickly and then i want it i

[01:06:04] want you to come back on the show because this has been great we're sort of

[01:06:06] near the hour mark but at all the new titles you've seen at tpf and then

[01:06:10] are coming out what what are you most excited about

[01:06:14] nothing really i mean i i want to play dialed in just because i'm a big

[01:06:18] wallard fan um but i don't see myself buying one um but i definitely want to

[01:06:23] play it which is fine you know i think one thing we have to we have to

[01:06:26] realize is you don't have to buy every game you don't have to want to buy every

[01:06:30] game to enjoy pinball you can you can you know hopefully if you have a

[01:06:35] location you're you you can go play it on location so i'm looking forward to

[01:06:39] playing dialed in if if it hits one of the locations around here um

[01:06:43] you know where's where's around here for you Greg where where you live in these days

[01:06:47] oh lost angeles okay um it though yeah so i mean if it'll make it there if anyone in lost

[01:06:52] angeles is listening we've got i off top my head there's three really good locations there's a

[01:06:58] a bar cave restaurant called button mash in echo park there's 82 in downtown and then yesterday

[01:07:04] i was at this place called ace gogi it's uh it's really weird because it's a Korean barbecue

[01:07:09] all you can eat restaurant but the guy who owns it i think i haven't met the guy but this is my

[01:07:13] assumption the guy who owns it is a huge pinball fan and collector and every rare weird

[01:07:18] le game is there at this uh at ace gogi so that's where i played uh

[01:07:23] aerosmith but he's he's got the spooky games there he's got dominoes and americans haunted

[01:07:29] there's a job is he got everything there's dominoes there's um the can crusher the pebs can

[01:07:34] crusher so uh so he just buys every new thing coming out yeah but he puts an

[01:07:38] on location so people could go play which is really cool well it's kind of like when i go to

[01:07:42] sunshine laundromat and brooklyn it's like that that he's got like every great le and all the

[01:07:46] that he's got all the hot titles and every time i go in there i love it because i spend 20 bucks

[01:07:50] i get to enjoy the best of pinball it's not the same as home use but it's awesome you know

[01:07:57] sometimes you get your fill a pinball for a few hours and we talk about this all the time because

[01:08:01] Greg and i are like well i can go buy an intendo switch for three in our bucks and Zelda can give me

[01:08:06] more hours of entertainment than maybe even a mobile machine could and everyone's happy right like

[01:08:12] our people don't look at us like we're idiots because we just dropped like twelve thousand dollars

[01:08:16] on a collector's edition dialed in they're like you're having fun and you're gaming with the day

[01:08:22] at the end of the day pinball is at least the new the new side of it it's pretty ridiculous and

[01:08:28] you know and i know you like to focus on the new things but but people should remember there's a whole

[01:08:32] world of amazing older games that are still great still play great still have cool max cool toys

[01:08:39] and they're they're way cheaper right i mean these days everything's kind of expensive again that's

[01:08:45] sort of you know when i started collecting you know i could go pick up a uh uh 90s dmd game for

[01:08:50] six hundred bucks um which you know you really can't do anymore right but uh but still you can

[01:08:56] find great games for way less than than the brand new games for sure absolutely you know i

[01:09:01] completely agree and and the reason why i do focus on the new stuff is as we kind of as we even talk

[01:09:05] about it on this podcast there's just so much drama and like passion and and it's it's always like

[01:09:12] this like read it's just ridiculous to see how things unfold with with all these new companies and

[01:09:17] these new games because um i'm just like how like where's the ceiling like how far we'll go like how

[01:09:23] much money will people throw into this hobby before people wake up one day and are like my life

[01:09:28] isn't that much better after i just dropped a hundred thousand dollars on these like six pinball

[01:09:34] machines you know it's like i'm just waiting for that moment where everyone has like a moment of

[01:09:38] clarity and and realizes like that we've all made it kind of like a mistake you know what it's

[01:09:45] well i mean i'm pretty much i'm i'm i don't really plan on buying anything new at these prices i mean

[01:09:50] the i i how many pet lullard games i think i have four or five pet lullard games and

[01:09:57] my entire pet lullard collection cost me less than what one new dialed in costs so

[01:10:04] right from my perspective it just kind of doesn't make sense no no and it's you know like they're

[01:10:09] milking it like these guys are milking it and you know i think the guys who are getting milk they

[01:10:14] like being milked by they they're they're chasing after something and they and i i i i relate

[01:10:19] i mean magic girl was like very much that's like you're chasing after this experience

[01:10:24] and i do think people want to sort of get that baliwillian magic back again and we haven't quite

[01:10:31] gotten there yet oh yeah well that was like yeah dialed in but not the theme i don't you know

[01:10:37] it's gonna be interesting um but it's a great year right i mean Greg i really look forward to seeing

[01:10:43] your constant commentary on pincider because i i love it i i know but i i have to give you props man

[01:10:48] i mean you're passionate about it you you don't let up uh even even if at times it seems like

[01:10:55] you you be healthy or for you and then those around you reading to for you to let up a little bit

[01:11:00] but i but i love the passion because i think it's important to keep harping on certain things at

[01:11:07] times because it it wakes people up and i think this hobby needs people who don't let things slide so

[01:11:14] i give you props for keeping the manufacturers honest and reminding us a million times why you're

[01:11:21] not getting go spusters yeah it's it's fun i think you know without guys like you there is no

[01:11:26] pincider because it comes down to the extreme personalities and the guys who love it so much that

[01:11:30] keep the site going it's like it's like you guys are like down there on the bottom like with the

[01:11:34] ors in hand like keeping the ship moving forward um so for the when the rest of the people arrive like

[01:11:40] what's happening on the site yeah well i think at the end of the day honest honesty honest

[01:11:45] honesty is important and i'd like to think that you know having been in the pinball you know hobby

[01:11:52] whatever you want to call it for uh you know about 10 years i have some experience to back up my

[01:11:58] opinions at the end of the day opinions are opinions not everyone's going to agree with them and you

[01:12:02] know i if i'm wrong tell me i'm wrong i'm not uh i'm not the type of person that will uh you know

[01:12:09] i don't have an ego to fight if i'm wrong tell me i'm wrong and i'll say oh i'm wrong i'm sorry

[01:12:15] you know they will they will they always do well Greg i really appreciate you coming on the show i

[01:12:19] hope the next time we talk we'll i'll be interviewing you about your impressions of the big lebowski

[01:12:26] so fingers that happen soon yeah i mean the story this the story of this game is getting the point

[01:12:32] where it's it's almost as ridiculous as the movie itself right no i know well where's the money

[01:12:38] lebowski i love that quote so like perfect for what's going on um well Greg thank you for taking

[01:12:44] the time look i i you're you're like you're a great guy to talk to about pinball and i think people

[01:12:48] are going to enjoy hearing you on the podcast because uh i think people they just always sound much

[01:12:55] more sensible and like a real human then like what people impressions are when we like hyper post

[01:13:00] on pincide so i think oh yeah i think you're going to come out of this with like with like even like a

[01:13:03] rep increase your reputation you go to the room i don't care about that but yeah no i'll i'll

[01:13:07] definitely can see that um yeah when you write something on a forum the tone doesn't always come

[01:13:12] through you know i might be writing something thinking it's tongue in cheek or dry humor and someone

[01:13:17] thinks i'm being a total motherfucker right so you know that's sarcasm is always missed on forums

[01:13:24] they're like downvotes like i was being sarcastic man like i don't really think oh yeah

[01:13:29] that's one this one guy uh i was sarcastic about something a few months ago and he starts uh

[01:13:36] sending me private messages basically threatening to come here from new zealand and like kung fu me to death

[01:13:42] uh i mean i'm like i'm like dude i was joking he's like yeah well meet me in person and we'll see

[01:13:47] who's joking i'm like oh well okay i mean any any fight that it gets started over like a pinball

[01:13:53] dispute is uh is ridiculous in my book um well Greg thank you so much and again what we're going to

[01:13:59] check it again soon because i think uh it's gonna be make or break for lebao skier in the next

[01:14:03] couple months so neither are gonna be flipping that thing or you're gonna be um asking for refund

[01:14:08] for the 80th time so we'll see what happened yeah we'll see all right man thanks again all right take care

[01:14:15] everyone all right
