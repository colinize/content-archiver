[00:00] Just gonna stand there, watch me burn

[00:05] Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts

[00:11] Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

[00:16] Well that's alright because I love the way it lies

[00:21] I love the way it lies

[00:24] I mean, I love the way you lie just not the perfect theme song for deep-root pinball

[00:33] I just when you think just when you think things can't get anymore hysterical or anymore

[00:39] Ridiculous we get this update from deep-root pinball. We're gonna talk about that

[00:43] We're gonna talk about a stern rumor that I'm not sure is true

[00:47] But if it is true

[00:48] It means one of the most MVP people over there might no longer be over there

[00:54] But this will either be true or not and we'll find out the truth because I'll report it

[00:58] And then it'll get debunked or confirmed very shortly

[01:02] We're gonna talk about spooky pinball bringing Ultraman and Halloween to two separate shows this weekend

[01:09] And the footage we got is not the footage we want it

[01:12] But it's the footage we have to deconstruct and we'll talk real quickly about Jersey Jack pinball and where I think the

[01:19] Prices of guns and roses are gonna go now that we know what's happening with this game

[01:24] Let's start with this stern rumor real quickly because this is something that just landed in my inbox and when you do

[01:31] Canatus pinball podcast here's what happens people know that I will report rumors news and speculation

[01:37] Now look, I don't know if there's any truth to this rumor. It just literally landed in my inbox right now and I'm in Ireland

[01:44] And it's like 8 a.m. Right now, which means it's 3 a.m. Everywhere else

[01:48] So the rumor that I got and I'm not sure if this is true

[01:51] But I will tell you this and within a day this will either be confirmed or debunked because if it's not true

[01:59] They will come out and say that's inaccurate

[02:02] But if it is true, we might get silence or we might get confirmation and it's a pretty big rumor

[02:07] This is the email I got and it says bomb shell

[02:11] Lyman is out at stern

[02:13] 100%

[02:15] He's been for a while feel free to confirm

[02:19] Others have this info, but you can still be the first to report it

[02:24] Well, thank you so much whoever this is for this scoop

[02:27] I'm not sure if it's true, but you heard it here first on canadus pinball podcast that Lyman is out at stern pinball

[02:35] But this is a rumor. This is I can't confirm this

[02:38] I mean, but I will tell you right now that now that we've said it

[02:42] We will get the truth because here's what happens when you say stuff like this that they will either come out and confirm this

[02:49] Or they will say it's not true or there will be silence now

[02:52] There's silence that's usually a good indication that they might not be ready to talk about something yet

[02:59] But it might be true. So I will say if Lyman Sheets is no longer at stern pinball

[03:05] I really would hate to see that because Lyman is the best coder in the history of pinball

[03:10] And when you're someone who's a content creator like a Lyman Sheets

[03:13] You want to work for a company that has constant machines going out the door and we know Lyman takes his time

[03:21] He takes about a year or two before he fully finishes a game and stern pinball is the perfect home for someone like Lyman

[03:29] Because they have so many games going out the door that every once in a while they can put them on something special

[03:36] But if he were to go over to a company like a Jersey Jack or a Chicago gaming company

[03:40] My fear would be is that he would be sitting on his hands forever

[03:45] Waiting for his game to come out. I mean we see it all the time

[03:49] It's like Christopher Franchi leaves stern and then we don't get to see his great artwork on any machines ever right now because he's just

[03:55] Waiting and waiting and waiting if he were still at stern

[03:59] We'd see a couple machines a year at least have Franchi artwork on it

[04:02] I feel the same way about Lyman Sheets

[04:05] I think he's such a talent that I would hate to see his talent always waiting for games to come out and we know and you know

[04:12] But it takes people a really long time to get product out the door

[04:16] We're not going to believe her this you heard it here on canadus pinball podcasts potential rumor that Lyman Sheets is out the door at stern pinball now

[04:24] Let's move on to deep root pinball. They put out an update last night now look deep root pinball is not a pinball company

[04:30] Deep root pinball does not have customers deep root pinball has done nothing in pinball

[04:36] But make a lot of promises say what they're going to do and then deliver on none of it year after year after year

[04:44] They have not shipped a single machine. So when deep root pinball gives an update

[04:49] All of us read this stuff knowing what we're reading. It's not a real update. It's not a real pinball company

[04:57] It's just comedy this entire thing is comedy. It's entertaining

[05:03] We're just excited to see what new way can they entertain us and the thread on pin sight is the most

[05:11] entertaining thread in the history of pin sight

[05:14] Watching Ben Heck go crazy

[05:16] Hoping this company goes under versus iceman who basically just paid $1,500 for entrance into the greatest comedy club of his life

[05:27] Most of the people who pre-ordered these machines they didn't really care whether or not they got a machine

[05:32] They just wanted to be part of something

[05:35] Ridiculous and I'm talking about the December pre-order people if you went in on this game in December

[05:41] You're just someone who knew you had money to burn. I don't get guys like Yolo bird who paid in full for two rosas

[05:48] That's just kind of ridiculous and then you've got the zidware people who have no choice

[05:53] Right it's like Stockholm syndrome. They've been in bed with John Papaduke now for like eight years on Raza

[06:01] At this point they don't even care. They've fallen in love with the myth that is Raza

[06:06] Because you got to remember this

[06:08] Zidware buyers have now had two times to get refunds from Robert Mueller and Robert gave refunds

[06:18] As much fun as we make of Robert and his bold claims the only thing he really did stand behind was he gave each and every one of you

[06:28] Who wanted a refund a refund and most of you did not take it

[06:34] So if you're a zidware person and you get burned now you kind of have nobody to blame but yourself

[06:40] But let's read this latest update from deep root pinball real quick and just and just laugh at at this excuse that

[06:46] Absolutely gives you nothing you really wanted to hear it goes dear Raza customer

[06:52] We are sorry for the length of time without an update

[06:56] We have been contacted by a few of you within the last few weeks

[07:00] The main topics where how many people took refunds is the refund offer still available and what the status of the Raza builds are

[07:10] Now what's interesting here is he tells us

[07:13] That three people took refunds and that refunds are not still available

[07:19] Now I just want to say this the three people who took refunds

[07:24] These three people should be in the pinball hall of fame whoever they are

[07:28] And I really think we should induct them into the pinball hall of fame because you three people deserve it

[07:34] You're the smartest people in the pinball world in the history of pinball

[07:39] It must have taken such willpower to get off the train at this point

[07:44] So you three

[07:45] Congratulations, I almost feel like they should frame the refund check they get from deep root pinball

[07:51] That's going to be worth more money than the machines one day because there are no machines one day

[07:56] Where is Raza?

[07:57] Eight years to get a cyclone remake are we really still having this conversation?

[08:02] We are but the letter goes on to say this a legal matter affecting Raza arose around a month ago that we did not expect

[08:12] We were advised by council to not send out any

[08:15] Substantive communication while they work to resolve it amicably

[08:20] We have taken that advice while patiently waiting for it to be resolved the back and forth has taken much much longer than we expected

[08:28] So we are providing this brief update so you understand what the delay is about it gets even better

[08:34] We cannot discuss the parties or what the complaint is about we cannot provide a timeline

[08:40] What we can say is that we are working hard to resolve settle it and we hope we will be resolved very soon

[08:46] We will be able to give a meaningful update at that time until then

[08:51] Robert J. Mueller principal deep root pinball okay, so they were advised by council

[08:58] Robert is the council. He is a lawyer

[09:00] He's these are his friends these lawyers who are working with deep root pinball

[09:05] And so let me ask a question though

[09:06] So if you just take this at face value there is some pending legal matter with the game Raza

[09:13] So you could ask like what could that be right is it coin taker?

[09:17] Is it zidware complaints like what would be holding this game up after all of these years right?

[09:23] There's only 122 owners right so here's the part right and I just want to talk to the people over at deep root

[09:30] Steve bowed in Robert Mueller

[09:32] So you're telling me that legal counsel is the reason why you can't show us that you have a

[09:37] 122 play fields in house

[09:40] legal counsels advising you that you can open the door and just show us that you have

[09:45] Manufacturing in place that parts are there you can't share a picture of a

[09:50] 122 pin bars right now just to give your owner's confidence that something is happening

[09:56] All of a sudden after eight months remember Robert told everybody that games back in December would ship in four to six weeks

[10:05] And now all of a sudden this happens how convenient is it that now there's a pending legal issue

[10:13] And now no new timeline will be given you know what this means

[10:17] I mean, it's really easy to translate this

[10:19] We are not going to give you an update now for a very long time

[10:24] And not only that you don't know why you don't know what the issue is is this an issue that could keep raza from ever being made?

[10:31] Is it that serious or is it something small

[10:35] But where's the proof in any of this where's the proof?

[10:38] Is he going to share with us the legal notice?

[10:40] Is there any way to prove that any of this is accurate?

[10:43] He has never proven to us that he's ready for manufacturing

[10:47] He's never proven that they have anything happening behind that production door

[10:51] And look this is just going to get made fun of left and right

[10:54] There are still just a hundred and twenty two people who are getting screwed right now all over again

[10:59] And it's kind of ironic when you think about it because you know if the number of people John Papaduk screwed the first time around

[11:06] It was basically a hundred and twenty two people who bought magic girl and raza remember there were about

[11:12] 25 or 22 magic girls sold and then he sold a hundred razzas

[11:18] That's the same number of people that are getting screwed all over again

[11:23] This is history repeating itself

[11:26] I don't buy this I don't buy this do you believe any of this?

[11:31] Does anyone out there even believe any of this or even care?

[11:35] I don't think so I don't think so because you know what it's not real

[11:38] They've not done anything they said they were going to do and I know I gave you guys some fun sound clips to chew on

[11:45] It's all just comedy now this whole thing. It's not a pinball company. It's a comedy club

[11:50] Deeproot pinball is a comedy club. They're not a pinball company

[11:54] You're not a pinball company and to you actually ship people a pinball machine

[11:59] You're the world's greatest pinball comedy club and every time you promise something and don't deliver and then come up with these excuses

[12:07] It gets even funnier the only thing I ask is that we don't take this to the private Facebook group

[12:13] I saw Kim Mitchell my friends suggesting that Kim why why let this be in the open let this be in the open the buyers

[12:20] This time around Kim are not the same as the zidware buyers all of you guys were hoodwinked by jpop the first time around

[12:28] There is nobody and I mean this nobody who got hoodwinked this time around

[12:35] all the people on this journey willingly got on this journey this time around and if you were a zidware customer

[12:43] You had two chances to get a refund and you didn't I say keep this thing in the public forum keep this thing on

[12:51] Pinside I think if you're in on this you deserve to be made fun of but you also are self-deprecating

[12:57] You also are in on the laugh. I mean read iceman man iceman is loving this

[13:03] He paid 1500 dollars to be the center of attention in this deeproot thread

[13:08] And that is worth way more than the machine is to him and I love reading it

[13:12] I love his commentary. I love Ben heck going crazy

[13:16] Ben is about to have a brain aneurysm and he can't let go until this company is gone

[13:22] The whole thing is comical and just think about the hours of content that deeproot has provided not just me the other pinball podcast

[13:30] I love it people say to me

[13:32] How do you do a podcast about pinball?

[13:35] What is there to talk about and I just point at deeproot?

[13:38] This is what there's to talk about we've got great companies like this who for like five years have been saying

[13:43] They're gonna be the greatest pinball company of all time and they're gonna ship more games in one year than anyone is ever shipped

[13:51] And they can't even get one single game out the door that is great comedy

[13:57] All right speaking of getting games out the door spooky pinball

[14:00] They take ultra man to pinfest in allentown

[14:03] They take Halloween to a horror convention both machines are out there in the world

[14:08] And what did we get we got the horrible over the shoulder cell phone gameplay footage being shared with the community

[14:17] This is everyone's first impression of gameplay and it's horrible

[14:21] It is horrible footage and they had to know that look

[14:25] I recommended that spooky pinball doesn't reveal anything

[14:28] Ship the game to owners and let them experience the game for the first time

[14:32] Why not right the games are all sold through they don't need to sell one more game now

[14:37] There are distributors sitting on title so if you want either game

[14:41] Nitro and pinball star they have product available

[14:45] This wasn't a day one sell out in the sense that you couldn't get one it sold through to distributors

[14:51] So here's the thing like for all of us out there that just want to see this game

[14:55] What is a minute and a half due for you of an over the shoulder gameplay footage

[15:00] It does nothing the only thing we can evaluate is the flow of the game

[15:05] We can see the lights we can see the artwork and I'll say this the game looks like it flows much better than previous

[15:12] Spooky pinball machines it does it looks like this game is gonna have a lot more flow and a lot more control

[15:20] Than a game like Alice Cooper or Rick and Morty so I I can see that from the gameplay

[15:24] Footage already I can see that that led strip that lines the upper playfields is annoying people is going to annoy people

[15:34] It does look a little unpolished now until I stand in front of the game itself

[15:40] I don't know if it's annoying to have that going back and forth and seeing those exposed leds if it's annoying while you're playing the game

[15:49] The attract mode of Halloween is very cool the way the lights go up and down and around and you can like

[15:55] Individually control each led. It's very neat now if people think that would look better with a cover

[16:02] That's what the mod community is for they will probably make that right away

[16:06] Yes, I do agree that that does look a little unfinished and I know spooky said like well from the players point of view

[16:12] You can't see those lights like that how is that possible are they talking about like a nine foot tall player

[16:19] Because every video I see

[16:22] That's the thing that stands out the most but otherwise. I mean there's not much to go on right?

[16:28] You can't really hear the call outs at the show you can't videotape the playfield and the LCD screen at the same time

[16:35] All of it sucks like trying to capture gameplay from a show

[16:40] It's the worst footage to get the place is too loud you can't hear stuff

[16:45] It's the worst angle everything about it is bad

[16:49] And I do think spooky should have made a video internally

[16:53] They should have done something and not done it like this

[16:56] You want to control people's first experience with the product you worked on these games for two years right two years

[17:03] You had these games and we've got a lot of great video content creators in the pinball world that would have loved

[17:12] To have gone over to spooky pinball and shot something for you

[17:16] And so it's crazy to me that they did into something as simple as that and I love spooky pinball

[17:23] You love spooky pinball

[17:25] But this is one area of improvement that I hope they think about next time around

[17:31] You don't need to spend as much money as Jersey Jack did on their guns and roses video

[17:36] But there's a happy medium in which you can create a three to five minute video in which you show people gameplay

[17:45] You explain the rule sets and then you just show them some sexy stuff from the game to get them excited

[17:51] And just give people enough where they say okay

[17:55] I've seen enough. I'm happy with what I see and I'm excited to wait for my Halloween or Ultraman

[18:01] But if you're in on either title right now you don't really have much to go on

[18:07] I mean you have people were just playing one ball at a time and they're playing a minute and a half

[18:12] 90 second games 30 second games and then you get you get the same feedback from everybody

[18:17] Oh, I played the game game is fun. It's like well, you didn't play anything yet

[18:20] You don't even know what you're doing like people are walking up to these machines

[18:24] And they have no idea what they're doing

[18:26] So everyone's first impressions of a pinball machine are sort of pointless

[18:31] Now that being said, I'm still in on Ultraman number 500 which they've confirmed for me will be a collector's edition with butter cabinet

[18:40] I need to pay the invoice don't worry spooky. I'm gonna pay the invoice. It's coming this week

[18:44] So speaking of paying for things. I think Jersey Jack pinball doesn't realize how much they will eventually pay for

[18:52] Their lack of communication around the guns and roses issue

[18:55] And it's really sucks

[18:56] It sucks because I'm looking at this thread that now has almost 200 upvotes

[19:01] And I don't think any downvotes on how people should avoid Jersey Jack pinball because they don't stand behind their products

[19:08] I'm not gonna belabor this

[19:10] I just want to say that every week that goes by Jersey Jack pinball you are making a colossal mistake

[19:17] Every week that goes by that you're not admitting there's a problem you're making a mistake

[19:21] Every week that goes by where you're not telling your customers that you will stand behind the products they bought

[19:28] You're making a mistake

[19:30] We know you have passionate people over there. I'm talking to you Barry

[19:34] Keith I'm talking to you Eric. I'm talking to you Ken Cromwell you Brett Abyss

[19:40] We know you guys care. We're not questioning whether or not you have passion

[19:44] But what all of you are doing right now by remaining silent on this issue

[19:49] You are losing the confidence and credibility consumers have with your company

[19:54] You will be defined by this moment. I know you don't care

[19:58] I know you probably saying your people don't read Pinside don't listen to canada

[20:02] But this is a defining moment in your company

[20:05] This was a defining game for Jersey Jack pinball and your silence is speaking volumes and it's telling all of us

[20:13] That you really don't want to stand behind your product and if you're working on a solution tell us

[20:21] If you have some thoughts tell us

[20:24] But you're saying nothing and this dark cloud hangs over your company every single week

[20:31] You say nothing and it's making all of you look bad

[20:35] And I would be embarrassed to walk around a pinball show

[20:38] Knowing that I sold customer games to people and I refuse to talk to them in a moment in which they need it my help

[20:46] And I'm not attacking you

[20:48] I'm just hoping you guys one day wake up and do the right thing and you're still not and I don't understand it

[20:53] And I know that it must be frustrating and I know that there's some cost associated with doing the right thing

[20:59] But you can't avoid it. You just can't avoid it

[21:02] These owners they deserve better than this and you know that you know that

[21:06] All right now speaking of that

[21:07] I know there's been some discussion on guns and roses machines and how the value of these machines will be impacted by all of this

[21:13] And I think it's real simple. It's real simple

[21:16] An Ellie machine is never going to hold value in guns and roses land just because they're making so many of them

[21:22] Even without play field issues

[21:24] Jersey Jack pinball is going to make at least five thousand guns and roses Ellie's you should buy one if you want one

[21:31] You should buy one to enjoy

[21:33] But if you buy a guns and roses Ellie, I think without a doubt a year from now

[21:38] You're $10,500 G&R Ellie probably will lose about two thousand dollars

[21:43] Maybe more that's pretty standard for for Jersey Jack Ellie's when they make a lot of them

[21:48] The only way these machines go up in value if they only have a limited number of them

[21:52] But five thousand is not limited. That's just expected you know

[21:56] None of you are buying a guns and roses Ellie to gain value the collector's editions are the interesting ones

[22:02] Because I do think that they've sort of peaked right now and what I mean by that right now is I think a new inbox one

[22:09] That hasn't been opened where you don't know what the play field is right now. You're looking around maybe

[22:16] 20 grand in opened game

[22:18] You're looking around

[22:20] $18,000 right now is like the going price and until there's a play field resolution

[22:25] I think the prices are going to stay around there

[22:27] You're not going to be able to get a new inbox guns and roses CE for south of $20,000. It's not happening

[22:34] You know, it's still a decent chunk of change over what these games were new

[22:38] But I'm just going to say this right now

[22:40] This is a weird thing to say because of what's happening with the play fields

[22:44] None of it's going to matter like a few years from now

[22:46] It's not you're just never going to see another rock and roll music pin or another music pin ever

[22:51] Quite like guns and roses you might never see another pinball machine with the kind of assets that guns and roses has

[22:59] In the long term a guns and roses collector's edition which I still think is Jersey jack pinball's greatest machine to date

[23:06] It's their coolest machine to date. It's their most accessible pinball machine to date

[23:11] It's just the coolest damn thing that Jersey jack pinball has ever made and the collector's edition of G&R is

[23:18] Absolutely a work of art and I'm not saying that because I own it

[23:21] It just is and I don't think anyone would argue with that when you stand over a guns and roses CE

[23:27] You know you're standing in front of something special

[23:30] This game is going to hold steady right now at where it's at

[23:33] But a few years from now these things are going to go way up in value. They just are

[23:38] It's just the nature of when you have a limited number of something and most owners are never going to let their guns and roses

[23:45] CE's go right now will probably be

[23:49] One of the easiest times to get one of these machines because of the play field issues

[23:54] There's a lot of anxiety

[23:56] There's a lot of insecurity about how this game will be handled from a quality standpoint

[24:02] But as we saw with pirates of the Caribbean even with a crappy play field

[24:07] Look at the value of those machines now. I know that they only made a thousand pirates of the Caribbean games

[24:13] But I'm here to tell you right now guns and roses is a far superior game than pirates of the Caribbean

[24:17] It just is it's a cooler game

[24:19] It's easier to get into and it's just much more of like an experience

[24:24] Like it's just a more enticing game for most people than pirates of the Caribbean

[24:29] The moment they decide to make more pirates of the Caribbean games those prices plummet back down to earth

[24:34] It's a game nobody want it for a year guns and roses is a game everybody want it on day one

[24:41] So it's kind of ridiculous how we're overvaluing a game nobody want it and a game everybody want it

[24:49] We're now starting to talk like it's gonna keep going down in value right? It's weird

[24:54] But if I were you I would just hold tight on your guns and roses collector's edition right now

[24:58] I wouldn't make a move right now you can find them out there

[25:01] There's a few of them out there to be had

[25:03] But again, I think few years from now you're gonna see guns roses new in boxes going for like

[25:08] $30,000 if if anyone still keeps it new in box and again

[25:11] I'm not selling mine so I'm not just doing that to pump up the prices

[25:14] But I really believe that and seeing where this hobby goes

[25:18] I absolutely believe that and hey if Jersey Jack pinball closes its doors

[25:23] Forget it then the price on all these machines is gonna skyrocket. I hope they don't I hope they don't close their doors

[25:29] But you know telling your customers the punch sand is a you're headed in that direction guys

[25:35] All right, anything else going on. I want to talk about the Dutch pinball factory

[25:39] There was a photo of Barry in the factory and it looks great

[25:42] They've got cabinets lined up. It's a nice new space

[25:46] And it's just nice to see that Barry has sort of turned the ship around

[25:50] And he's making these games and hopefully everyone gets made whole by the end of this journey

[25:57] I still think the big Lebowski is one of the greatest worlds in their class

[26:00] I've ever seen in pinball and I feel like all of us are like one day

[26:04] We all will own a big Lebowski it just feels like that kind of game again like 10 years from now when you say

[26:10] What was the machine that gave everybody everything they wanted?

[26:15] It's on the short list of giving something to everybody and if they can get the code in the right place

[26:21] And I know they're adding more code to the game if they can get the code to the right place

[26:26] Can you imagine if Lyman Sheets jumped on this game and polished it to the end?

[26:30] It would be the most sought after pinball machine

[26:33] I think of all time if the code was just where people wanted it to be

[26:38] My god, this is it. This is what we want

[26:41] I just want to end this by saying still no cactus Canyon and still no new game from AP

[26:47] I think august is going to be the date in which we see those two companies finally get back into the ring

[26:55] Everybody's tired of waiting for CGC to do anything

[26:59] How can you be a line worker over at CGC and AP think about it?

[27:04] Where are the line workers in these companies?

[27:07] How can you turn a production line off completely for so many months and years

[27:14] And then just turn it right back on where do they go?

[27:18] Ever think about that?

[27:19] Where do those line workers go?

[27:21] And then where do they get them from?

[27:24] When you get them back in house are they all brand new people because they've been not making anything for you for so many months

[27:32] Do you have to retrain people?

[27:34] Does that make it hard to keep the quality up?

[27:36] It's just something I was thinking about like the stern line workers they go in every day they have games to make

[27:42] Every day at spooky they have games to make every day at jersey jack pinball they have games to make

[27:48] But where are the line workers at CGC?

[27:51] Where are they at American pinball?

[27:53] Confusing right like what are they doing?

[27:55] Are they going to McDonald's?

[27:57] Are they going over here and then they're coming back to build pinball machines?

[28:00] Which is a really difficult thing to do.

[28:03] It's a highly skilled device to make.

[28:06] It's a very very interesting thing to think about

[28:09] You know if you make a pinball company you think you to always want to have games on the line

[28:13] I mean isn't that the goal?

[28:15] Is that the whole point in all of this?

[28:18] And Robert you know you never should have came out of the gate and said you were going to do more games in one year than everybody combined

[28:24] And now here we are five years later

[28:27] And legal counsel is the reason why you can't share a picture of production

[28:33] I don't know where Deeproot goes from here. I really don't but I do enjoy the comedy

[28:38] The part that I can't get is this that he came into my Facebook thread and said

[28:44] We're laughing at you canada laughing at us. I don't understand. What's he laughing at?

[28:51] What is he laughing at can someone tell me canada pinball at gmail.com?
