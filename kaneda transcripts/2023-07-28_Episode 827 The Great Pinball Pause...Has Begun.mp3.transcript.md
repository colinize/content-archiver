[00:00] It's gonna take time, a whole lotta precious time.

[00:06] It's gonna take patience and time, mm-hmm.

[00:10] To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, Black Giant.

[00:16] Cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars.

[00:20] Aw, welcome everybody, happy Friday, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] I'm super excited to do this show.

[00:27] I'm in a really good mood.

[00:28] It's been a great week.

[00:29] I'm gonna explain why.

[00:30] There's something great happening in the pinball world.

[00:33] But even better than that, we got Joe Newhart.

[00:36] Welcome Joe Newhart from Pinball Star to the club.

[00:39] Joe, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:41] We're happy to have you here.

[00:42] We've had a great consistent month with Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:45] We're back up over 600 club members.

[00:47] We wanna welcome Joe.

[00:48] We wanna thank Rodney for upping his donation to Canadian Pinball Club.

[00:53] I mean, with everything getting so inflated in the world, it's so nice to know I have such generous people.

[00:58] Such generous subscribers and fans of the show.

[01:01] But let's welcome Joe.

[01:02] Let's welcome Keith.

[01:03] Let's welcome AP.

[01:04] Let's welcome Daniel Thomas-Bred, Geoff Chad, Marco Kenneth, Matthew Kent, James Brook.

[01:12] Those are some of our new club members to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:15] But here's what I wanna talk about on this episode, because we always get right to it.

[01:19] So what I wanna talk about on this episode, I'm calling this episode, the great pinball pause.

[01:24] And I use George Harrison's, I Got My Mind, Said On You.

[01:28] Because a lot of us, when we think about our pinball buying, that is how we approach pinball buying.

[01:33] I've got my mind set on this new game.

[01:36] But as he says in that song, it's gonna take some time, a whole lot of precious time to do it right.

[01:44] And I'm calling this episode, the great pinball pause.

[01:47] Because I do believe, and I hear from many of you out there, that more and more of you are starting to realize,

[01:54] if you just wait a little bit, if you don't get on the hype train, if you don't join the FOMO hype train,

[02:02] you will be in a much better position, you'll be much happier with your relationship with the hobby,

[02:09] and you won't feel this overriding urge to jump at every single new game that gets released into the pinball world.

[02:19] And now Joe Newhart is thinking, I picked the worst day imaginable to join Canadian's pinball podcast,

[02:26] because he's telling people to wait and see.

[02:28] But we're gonna talk about the great pause, we're gonna talk about John Wick pinball.

[02:32] But before I do that, I wanna say something else that has me in a good mood,

[02:37] something else that has me happy right now.

[02:39] I had a really good back and forth with Jason Knapp yesterday.

[02:43] And I wanna say this, Jason Knapp on Knapp's arcade a month ago said that Stern Pinball had the John Wick license.

[02:52] I never said that this was some Canadian exclusive, I never said I was delivering this for the first time ever.

[02:58] What I was talking about was I heard confirmation that it's happening, so his rumor was right,

[03:03] my confirmation seems like it's gonna be right.

[03:06] But more importantly, Jason Knapp has the best pinball news website on planet Earth,

[03:12] it's a much better place to go to than Pinside,

[03:15] and him and I have had it out back and forth over the last like year or so,

[03:19] and the reason why, and the genesis for our attention was always this simple thing that like,

[03:25] I never felt like I got any credit on Knapp's arcade, you'll never hear me mention,

[03:29] and that's because we've had our back and forth.

[03:32] Yesterday we communicated like grown adults, and we both came to the conclusion that holding on to any animosity is not really worth it,

[03:40] it's just pinball, we're here to have fun, and I just wanna say, as of yesterday, Jason and I are cool,

[03:46] and I'm really happy to be in a cool position with Jason Knapp,

[03:49] and moving forward, I would like the relationship to be much more positive,

[03:53] and that's on me, I know how I behave and I know I can rub people the wrong way,

[03:57] but I just wanted to let you know that if you like Knapp's pinball podcast,

[04:01] and you like Knapp's arcade, that Jason and Chris are cool,

[04:05] and whenever there's drama, no one likes it, like the pinball media drama is silly,

[04:09] I have sent multiple messages to Genghis, to no reply,

[04:13] the other drama that's been going on, it's just a handful of people,

[04:16] I think some bridges will just never be repaired, and it is what it is.

[04:20] Alright, but you don't come to Knapp to hear about pinball media drama,

[04:23] let's first talk about John Wick, before we talk about the great pinball pause going on in the pinball community.

[04:29] So John Wick coming to us from Stern Pinball, it makes total sense,

[04:34] we know that Spooky Pinball was dabbling in this license, Spooky Pinball admits they were trying to make a John Wick game,

[04:42] and then they reskinned it as Halloween and Ultraman, you know those Mike Myers that pop out from behind the hedges,

[04:49] those were supposed to be bad guys that John Wick shoots,

[04:53] I think everybody, and I mean this, there is a hundred percent of us that agree that we are happy that that layout did not become John Wick Pinball.

[05:04] Spooky Pinball has a lot of work to do people, for them to deliver on a dream theme of ours,

[05:11] I think everyone is secretly happy, they're not making games like Star Wars,

[05:16] can you imagine if Spooky Pinball made Ghostbusters instead of Stern, they're just not there yet,

[05:21] and I've said it before, I love the gang over at Spooky, they just need to hire some design help to get to the caliper of these other companies,

[05:31] I mean they're getting better with each game, but I would say that they're not ready for a triple A theme yet.

[05:38] So Stern as John Wick, right, did they steal this from Spooky Pinball the same way they stole Godzilla from Spooky Pinball,

[05:45] and who amongst you is upset that Stern Pinball made Godzilla and not Spooky?

[05:49] But let's talk about John Wick as a Pinball theme, do we like this as a Pinball theme?

[05:55] Now for some of you out there, if you've seen the John Wick movies and you're a grown adult male between the ages of 40 and 60,

[06:05] I do not know how you walk away from those films not feeling great about this theme, these movies are incredible.

[06:14] If you've ever seen like old school like John Woo's The Killer, it is a modern contemporary version of that, the guy has a handgun.

[06:22] With one handgun, John Wick can take out like 900 bad guys on one clip, and every shot's a headshot, and it's super awesome,

[06:30] and it's super fun, and the choreography is amazing, the environments in which the battles happen are amazing, the music is amazing,

[06:38] the acting is amazing, it's got all the one-liners you want from an action movie, it is high energy, it is cool,

[06:45] John Wick just oozes cool, Keanu Reeves just oozes cool, the dude is not on social media, and that's what makes him cool.

[06:55] Everything he does is awesome, he's one of the most generous actors in all of Hollywood, and so John Wick as a Pinball theme,

[07:03] I think it's a good choice, now look, it's not for everybody, I see some people already being like, well I've never seen the movies,

[07:10] easy pass for me, and I do recommend to those people who have not seen the films, who think this is an easy pass in pinball format,

[07:19] do me a favor, go watch the movies, and then make up your mind, because I think if you see these films, you're going to see the potential in them.

[07:27] Now when I think about a John Wick pinball machine, and I think about John Borg doing it, because it's going to be John Borg, right,

[07:33] it's not going to be Keith Elwyn, Keith Elwyn is doing Jaws, okay, that is happening, and then I think we're going to see John Wick from John Borg,

[07:43] which means I'm going to lose my He-Man bet with Jason Knapp, which means I'm going to be spending $500 to Project Pinball,

[07:49] it's alright, it's for a good cause, and that means that American Pinball has He-Man, but it's going to come out after Jaws,

[07:55] it's going to come out in the summer of 2024, and I think it's going to be another title that might divide some people,

[08:01] but I think it's a good choice for pinball, I'll tell you why, it's finally a contemporary movie, it's finally a game that is not a comic book,

[08:09] it's finally a game not for Marvel, it's finally a game that's not another Dad Rock band, it's finally a movie that is popular recently made into pinball.

[08:20] I think a lot of us want to see more of this, we want to see more contemporary titles, I'd rather see more popular movies put into pinball format

[08:29] than remaking Twilight Zone or remaking Big Bang Bar, I mean this is what pinball should be doing, it should be capturing what's popular in culture,

[08:39] what a lot of people love within the target demographic of pinball, and then it should make it into pinball format,

[08:45] and then for these prices which are super expensive right now, you've got to make the games great, there's no middle ground anymore,

[08:52] you can't go half ass on the games, and John Wick, when I think about that game, to me it's going to be a game that's got to be like Tron,

[09:00] it's got to have like that awesome music from the movie, it's got to do interesting things with lighting,

[09:06] I think they really have to create that environment that John Wick's in, it's got to vary like modern, like he's at a rave concert

[09:13] and he's in these interesting museums and interesting buildings and environments and the bad guys are coming at him,

[09:19] you feel like you're the hero in this in real life video game that's just bad ass, and I think the pinball machine needs to do that,

[09:27] now that being said, what I don't want to see with John Wick pinball is just another stern machine,

[09:33] I want to see them approach John Wick with that in mind, and what worries me about stern making John Wick when you think about the environment

[09:41] and the lighting and like all the different things that could be in this game, it's Mustang, you've got the Continental,

[09:46] you've got the Gold Coins, you've got the Weapon Collection, you've got all the stuff going on,

[09:50] you've got all those unique environments in which he's fighting from Paris to the desert to nightclubs in New York to like Russian bath houses,

[09:58] like they've got to figure out a way to bring some of that, like some of that intensity into the game,

[10:03] and what worries me about stern machines people, when you look at modern sterns,

[10:09] they really don't do a great job of creating an impressive environmental feel to the game,

[10:15] and what I mean by that, right, it's like when you think about Jersey Jack's Guns and Roses,

[10:20] it really created that environment with the lighting and the spotlights and all those different things going on,

[10:27] I think that's the kind of vibe you've got to bring to John Wick pinball, now stern did it well with Tron,

[10:33] with the fiber optic lighting of the ramps and the lighting and the music and Tron is absolutely cool,

[10:39] so I'm looking for stern to take that, but remember Tron is like almost 10 years old or is 10 years old,

[10:45] it's been a decade now, and stern knows so much more about lighting and how to do stuff,

[10:51] my fear is this, is that stern's not trying to truly innovate anymore, a lot of that kind of stuff,

[10:58] I think stern is putting everything into the LCD assets, I would like to see stern continue to innovate areas of lighting

[11:06] and design and overall environmental things they can do under that glass to bring a world like John Wick to life,

[11:14] but that's the other reason when I talk about the great pinball pause, unless we pause a little bit and tell these companies

[11:21] we're not going to throw money at everything, why should they innovate, why should they continue to push the limits of what's possible

[11:29] in pinball if we're going to throw money at baron games, and that's the thing is like if all they're going to do is give us artwork

[11:37] and give us LCD animations, is that going to work, now let's talk about the artwork in John Wick, so John Wick is very cool,

[11:45] he's very stylist, he's very urbane, he's like a badass guy in a city taken down like mobsters from around the world

[11:53] and all these hit men, and this like global faction that is after him, like the table that's after him, right?

[12:00] So I don't think John Wick meshes up with a zombie-eddy style of artwork, it would be more of like a Christopher Franci style of artwork

[12:08] that would work well for this game, now here's the thing, I know stern doesn't work with Christopher Franci anymore

[12:13] but have you seen AI artwork people? I mean you can do Franci style artwork now using AI art programs like instantly

[12:23] like I know Franci illustrates over source material, he does, but if you put in John Wick source material

[12:30] you could AI artwork it to look exactly like his art style, you know a lot of artists out there are nervous about artificial intelligence

[12:38] and what it can do in the world of art, and for people that can illustrate from the ground up like zombie-eddy on a blank piece of paper

[12:44] I don't think they have that much to be worried about, but for people like Franci and that art style, like there's a lot of artists that are really nervous

[12:51] that AI can do it instantly and guess what, for free, if you're a stern pinball and you're so profit driven, at some point you might be looking to turn on some of these AI art tools

[13:02] to create mind blowing art packages for pinball machines that can be done instantly by a computer, because if you own the IP and you have right to those assets

[13:11] it's really easy to do it when you have that source material, in the old days like the photoshop drag and drop looked terrible

[13:18] but now you can make the photoshop drag and drop look amazing if AI is helping you out, again just the modern world people

[13:25] a lot of people's jobs are going to be in jeopardy, I work in a world where like copywriters, people who write copy for ads

[13:31] AI is damn good at it, it's scary and it delivers stuff with personality and wit and sense of humor, it's eerily scary how good it is

[13:40] alright so John Wick, do we think it's going to be a blockbuster hit for a stern pinball?

[13:45] look I think it's going to do well, but again there's always a risk and a gamble, the good news is this, we know that John Wick movies are good

[13:54] this isn't like Jack Winard making the hobbit and then the movies turned out to be terrible, because they're making it based on films that people love

[14:02] and there's a lot of fandom and there's a lot of crossover between the pinball buying demographic and John Wick

[14:09] I think it's a good move for stern, I think it's going to be a fun game, I think it's definitely something that has me interested

[14:16] is it a dream theme for canada? No, but I'd much rather look at a game like John Wick than Venom

[14:23] I'd much rather look at John Wick than Rush, I'd much rather look at John Wick than Elton John or Foo Fighters just because of the stuff I'm into

[14:31] I love the movies and so it has me interested, am I going to buy it? No, I'm not going to buy it right away because I'm going to live by my own mantra

[14:39] and nowadays the only time I will buy a pinball machine right away is if it is based on a theme I absolutely want to own

[14:48] and that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to buy it because I'm going to live by my own mantra

[14:55] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:01] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:07] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:14] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:19] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:24] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:29] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:35] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:40] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:45] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:50] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[15:55] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[16:00] and I'm going to live by my own mantra and I'm going to live by my own mantra

[16:05] It was Dandan noodles and vegetable dumplings in spicy chili oil

[16:10] and some scallion pancakes. It was our favorite order every Saturday night

[16:15] from the same restaurant and we'd do two bottles of sake or a bottle of sake

[16:20] and we would eat it and watch Midnight Diner. If you haven't seen Midnight Diner on Netflix

[16:26] I highly recommend it. It's a Japanese show that's subtitled.

[16:30] We would get it every Saturday night and we loved it and it was $38 to our door

[16:37] that included the food, the delivery, the tip, the seamless grub hub taxes

[16:43] $38 that meal was every Saturday night in 2021.

[16:50] Over the last two years the prices of the items continue to go up.

[16:56] Nowadays the same exact order if I go on to Seamless and try to order it

[17:02] it is $68 to get that exact same meal to my door.

[17:09] Everything went up significantly in price. The food, the delivery services, the hidden fees, everything

[17:18] and now Brenda and I even though we love the meal so much we've stopped ordering it.

[17:24] It's not that we don't have $68, it's that I don't think that Don Don Noodles, pancakes

[17:32] and some dumplings are worth almost $70. I don't value that item at that much money

[17:42] and a similar thing has happened in Pinball. It's not that we don't love Pinball.

[17:48] It's not that we don't want to indulge in it but everything people has a price

[17:55] and there is a threshold on every item, a threshold by which we determine as customers

[18:03] do I think this is worth this. Am I seeing the value in that item?

[18:11] And we all know this. If you've been spending $8,000 or $9,000 on Stern LEs over the years

[18:18] you probably still have enough money in your piggy bank to spend $12,000, $13,000, $15,000

[18:26] on the current pricing of these limited edition machines or premiums or collectors editions

[18:32] but even though you have the money a lot of you are starting to feel like I don't want to spend that money

[18:40] I could but I don't because you know what it used to cost

[18:47] and you look down at the machines now and you're not seeing 40% more in creativity, in engineering

[18:56] and the experience is the same. When you get in front of a Pinball machine you have fun with it

[19:03] again there's a certain threshold of entertainment that a Pinball machine can deliver

[19:08] there's just a threshold of how much entertainment could this provide

[19:12] I had a listener of the show send me a picture he bought a Mazda Miata and he said Chris

[19:17] this car is so much fun it is crazy that Pinball machines now cost as much as this car just cost me

[19:27] and there's no way a Pinball experience is as fun as going around a twisty road hitting the apex in a Mazda Miata

[19:36] now look I know we use cargumans all the time but he has a point for each and every one of us

[19:42] we all have a different threshold for some of you out there you might be worth hundreds of millions of dollars

[19:48] it matters not $13,000 to you is like 130 bucks for some of you out there $13,000 might be half of what you make in a year

[19:58] profit and you really have to be careful about how much you spend on Pinball machines

[20:02] some of you can't afford any new in-box machines and you just get enjoyment from listening to the hobby from playing games on location

[20:09] you might own one machine and just be having the time of your life and I mean this when I say it

[20:16] I envy the people that are able to just have fun have a simple life don't chase after everything that's new

[20:25] how are you ever going to be happy if you adopt that mindset that you want to buy every single new Pinball machine that comes out

[20:33] do you want to eat every single food item that a restaurant puts on the menu and so all of this is colliding to create what I'm seeing is a new behavior

[20:42] that people are just waiting and they're pausing and they're saying look at these prices I need a game to check this many boxes before I'm going to buy it before I play it

[20:53] remember the behavior that is pausing isn't buying Pinball the behavior that is pausing is buying a Pinball machine before you play it

[21:04] the fact that people are paying in full right now for Venom L.E. think how stupid that is and I know that's a strident word but it is stupid

[21:12] and I don't care if the money doesn't matter to you and you have stupid money but why would you buy a game that you know is not even close to selling out

[21:22] why would you pay in full now and wait two months when in that two months you will be able to go play the freaking machine and make sure it's for you before you have to pay for it

[21:35] and again for many of us for many years we acted like we didn't even need to play a machine like we've seen enough on just a two minute teaser video to take our money

[21:46] and I think this is really good beneficial behavior you know I've been sick like a dog over the last week I had the hand foot mouth disease from Killian

[21:55] and over the last week I wasn't able to eat I wasn't able to really drink much I was basically just suffering through these mouth sores

[22:04] and in the last week what I did was I didn't drink any alcohol I didn't drink any coffee I didn't eat any unhealthy food and all I did was I rested

[22:16] I didn't do much I couldn't work much I was in chronic pain and I just slept as much as I could I drank a lot of water I cleansed my system I paused my normal behaviors

[22:29] I've slept better than I ever have before I've been more positive and optimistic I've just felt a million times better and I didn't feel this like urgency to go out and just do happy hours

[22:44] and just constantly like throw money at the world because I couldn't right I was forced to not do it and I came out of it feeling so refreshed

[22:53] and I think some of that is happening in Pimball right now that many of you out there are just waiting and it's refreshing and you feel good because you know you're not going to miss out on any of it

[23:05] and FOMO is not a great thing I know for many years I would create the FOMO hype train and I got to be honest you know why I did that I'm going to be brutally honest with all of you

[23:17] the reason why I love creating the FOMO hype train is because I was hoping games would go up in value because if I could get my hands on one then I could sell it to someone who hasn't even played it for two to three thousand dollars more than I paid for it

[23:30] I mean I was basically acting like a distributor I mean that's what distributors of course they want to hype all this stuff because they're going to make money on every game sold as they should because that's their job

[23:41] and it's fun to do that right it is fun to hype that train and get everybody excited but ultimately at the end of that journey for someone like me who's not a distributor

[23:53] I'm telling you at the end it doesn't really make you feel great because at the end of that journey I realized something

[23:59] I realized that these companies aren't putting that much more into these games to justify these prices

[24:05] I realized that there is a threshold for what a pinball machine should cost like new from a manufacturer

[24:12] I'm not against games going up on the second hand market I'm not against pinball machines being collectibles of course there's going to be rare versions of games that people want

[24:22] I mean look at me I mean I bought a Batman SLE back for twenty five freaking thousand dollars because that's what those games cost in the marketplace

[24:30] but my point is this is let the market determine the price of the pinball machines and what's happened now is the market did not determine the price of these games

[24:41] the market did show these companies that great games could go up in value and this has been the biggest problem in pinball over the last two years

[24:50] they've priced everything before it's out as if it's a great game and the problem with that is is that most of these games are not great masterpiece games

[25:02] yet they are all priced that way before we even get our hands on the machines you have to look no further than games like Toy Story

[25:11] then games like Godfather fifteen thousand dollars the most expensive jersey jack machines have ever been and there are two of the most underwhelming games jersey jack has ever made

[25:22] and Wizard of Oz was sixty five hundred bucks it's stupid and I think it's refreshing and I encourage all of you to do the following

[25:31] just pause more wait a little bit more you'll be able to get any single game and if you have to spend a little bit more because you waited and something went up in value so what

[25:44] look at guns and roses collectors edition people it was twelve five right when it first came out people had FOMO they were spending eighteen or nineteen thousand dollars to get one

[25:55] now you can go get one for thirteen thousand dollars only five hundred dollars more than it was brand new five hundred dollars more and in those three years if you invested your twelve five you would have made way more than five hundred

[26:07] dollars in value and that's what I'm doing so I'm taking the money that I would normally buy pinball machines with because none of these games speak to me and look I've got other money invested this isn't like the only money I'm playing with

[26:21] I don't know I'm not as rich as some of you but when I start writing checks for thirteen or fifteen thousand dollars I feel it a little bit I feel it in my pin money right it's like my special fund money like that takes away from like vacation money

[26:34] it might take away from clothes I want to buy or meals I want to have or gifts I want to get for Brenda it takes away from other stuff but what we've been doing lately is what if as grown adults we look around us and we say hey I just have way more than one man needs

[26:50] we have way more than a little couple like us needs we have so much to be thankful for that what if what if we adopt this mindset and we look around us like all of you do me a favor look around your homes open up your

[27:03] I'm not a big fan of your budget look at your vehicles if you have a marina look at your boats look at your pinball collection look at your partner look at your family look at your kids look at the roof over your head look at everything you have

[27:13] look at all the subscription services look at everything that you have and say to yourself do I have everything I need to be happy am I extremely blessed I've worked hard for this but are you extremely blessed to have everything you have in your life and how much more do you need to make you happy

[27:32] do you need to convince yourself that you're now into symbiotes because you want to buy venom or maybe you don't buy venom right now maybe you wait and you play it and you get a sense of whether or not it's for you and maybe you wait a couple more months after that and then you get to see Jaws

[27:51] you wait a couple more months you get to see Elton John you get to see back to the future you get to see John Wick and then eventually when you see the game that you really want because this is how I look at life I need something that is going to enhance what I already have I already have everything I could ever want in life of course I need a house but I have a home here

[28:11] I have a family here that I love who loves me and that's more than that's worth more than any pinball machine I've made friends in this hobby that are more valuable to me than any damn pinball machine and we bond over making fun of these high prices and we bond making fun of these pinball companies trying to sell us this stuff for 40 to 50% more than they were two years ago and I enjoy those conversations we're almost happy in our unhappiness with these pinball companies

[28:40] and I love that because it's free because I don't have to spend money on that the conversations are magnetic they're explosive but they're fun and nobody's getting hurt and everybody's holding on to their money and if we hold on to our money it's going to make these companies make the games even better or it's going to make these companies lower their prices what's wrong with that do you wake up every day and want to make your pinball companies as much profit as you possibly can as if you're an investor in those companies

[29:10] and you have so much to be thankful for you have more than enough pinball machines that you could ever play right now let me play devil's advocate I know you want to buy new stuff games get boring right games get boring like if you own 10 games you're going to be bored of two of them and you're going to want to rotate them out and put something new in that's why pinball is fun it's a little annoying rotating games in and out right these aren't video game cartridges they're not watches they're not games

[29:40] they're not easy things to transport but that being said if you have money you're probably paying someone to do all that heavy lifting and I get it you're going to want to rotate games in and out and that's when pinball becomes fun too right you're trading them like baseball cards like I've got eight machines I rotate a few out every year I buy what's new I get to play it and then I can move it on the only difference is now from four years ago when you do that you're now going to lose like two to $3,000 instead of like 500 bucks because I'm going to end on this note because all pinball

[30:10] back then was in that threshold of where we saw the value five to $10,000 was the sweet spot threshold for pinball every once in a while an amazing game or a super rare attempt like a batman sle sure then you could charge 15 and people would cry about it but still you're going over the threshold but we saw the value in batman sle and that's why when people ask why are you so down on James Bond

[30:39] 60th because people trust me that was the moment Stern showed us their true colors about how they feel about us as collectors they wanted $20,000 for a single level game that most likely cost them no more than $5,000 to make and then what happened then they tried to deny asking $20,000 for it by removing the price from the website and then the dealers are selling them all for $15,000 out the back door

[31:09] and making no money on it it's stupid they went past the threshold nobody has a gun to our head to buy these machines I am enjoying not buying anything I will get whatever I want when I want it but right now the great pinball pause is happening and trust me try it out just try it out for a couple months

[31:32] just pause all of your pinball spending and tell me at the end of those two months much like when canada cut out coffee and alcohol I guarantee you at the end of those two months you are going to be happier you are going to appreciate the games you have even more and you are not going to regret it

[31:53] FOMO is a lie it only happens on triple A titles and none of the stuff coming out is that so trust me people welcome to the great pinball pause of 2023 it's not going to stop anytime soon and we're going to make these pinball companies together either make these games worth the money or we're going to make them lower their price or some of them are going to go out of business it's that simple love you guys happy Friday

[32:22] welcome to the canada club Joe Newhart don't worry every show is not like this but I just wanted to speak about this on this episode and thank you so much for being a club member everybody it's the end of the month we're going to lose 20 of you I implore the 20 of you that always leave every month and then come back just stay I promise you I will never raise the price of canada pinball podcast it's $5 to get through the door
