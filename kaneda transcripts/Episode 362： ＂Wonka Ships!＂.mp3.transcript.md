[00:00] Everybody, why come tonight?

[00:03] Everybody, why come tonight?

[00:06] Sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba!

[00:11] Jersey Jack Pinball gets Willy Wonka out the door.

[00:15] Stern Pinball desperately tries to get you to buy a black knight

[00:19] and the treasure chest can open and close in Pirates of the Caribbean

[00:23] all that and more on episode 362 of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] Well, look, we were wrong.

[00:29] Jack has done it.

[00:31] Willy Wonka is our on a truck heading out, not just to operators,

[00:36] but also to distributors.

[00:38] And that means they are going to make their way into the homes of customers,

[00:44] most likely before July 4th.

[00:47] So we were wrong.

[00:48] I mean, just even like this week, we were like,

[00:51] there's no way Jack is going to get the game out.

[00:53] The game is out.

[00:54] It is in a truck.

[00:55] It is heading there.

[00:56] We saw a great video of Jack.

[00:58] He's given up the summer salt.

[01:00] And I think that's a good thing.

[01:02] We all were worried that Jack was going to severely hurt himself,

[01:06] summer salting in front of his company.

[01:08] So he's resorted to a golf chip, which I think is good.

[01:12] Because none of us wanted to see Jack like break his neck trying to do a summer salt.

[01:16] And the games are in the truck.

[01:18] The truck is heading out.

[01:20] And locations are going to get it this week.

[01:23] And also I heard, you know, flipping out Pinball,

[01:25] Zach Menys company is getting one.

[01:27] And that's where it was like confirmed for me that, you know,

[01:29] these games are going to consumers as well.

[01:31] So it's not just operators getting the game.

[01:33] And I think we just have to stop for a moment and say it is a glorious moment in which

[01:39] Jersey Jack Pinball actually revealed and shipped a game to people within two months.

[01:44] And I don't know if you can hear me applausing in my room.

[01:48] Brenda is running the Vitamix blender right now.

[01:51] I cannot believe it.

[01:52] I told her I was doing a podcast.

[01:53] Brenda you're unbelievable.

[01:54] But look, that's just the sound of all of us cheering right now.

[01:58] That Jersey Jack, this is a huge milestone for them because they've never done this before.

[02:03] If you've been following the Jersey Jack Pinball story for the, you know, over the years,

[02:08] it has always been a story of reveal way too early, make people wait way too long,

[02:13] the hype dies down on the game.

[02:15] And what a better way.

[02:16] I think this is the perfect time to get hype back on this title by getting it into the hands of consumers.

[02:22] So I'm super excited and I think we should give Jack and everyone over there,

[02:27] Jersey Jack, a round of applause for doing it this way.

[02:31] And he held true to his word and we were wrong.

[02:34] I would, you have little faith over on Canadian pinball podcast because I've just seen,

[02:38] they've said it so many times they were going to do it, but they did it.

[02:41] And so what does that mean?

[02:42] How could they do it this time?

[02:43] I think a few things.

[02:44] I think some of you have called it out before.

[02:47] Obviously, they're able to make Willy Wonka a lot easier than some of the other games.

[02:54] And I don't mean that's like the games are stripped down.

[02:57] There definitely isn't as much in this game in terms of like the complexity of the bill.

[03:02] No way around it.

[03:03] There's no way around it.

[03:04] You know, there's not two upper playfields.

[03:06] There's not a huge rocking ship they have to put in it.

[03:09] There's not as much that they have to, I think, attach to the game and to the, you know,

[03:14] the playfield as other Jersey Jack games.

[03:17] It seems a lot easier to build.

[03:18] I mean, if you look at Pirates of the Caribbean when people are pulling that game apart to make it work,

[03:23] it looks like a nightmare to have to build that game on the line.

[03:27] And this game seems like it's a walk in the park.

[03:30] Probably the easiest game to screw together for the Jersey Jack assembly line.

[03:35] So we're happy that that is the case because they need to do that.

[03:39] And we're going to talk about Gary Stern's interview with Head to Head Pinball in this podcast too.

[03:44] Because, you know, it's hard not to look at these two companies as the main two companies battling it out for pinball innovation and manufacturing.

[03:52] And we're going to talk about what Gary said in that interview.

[03:54] I have a lot of thoughts on what he said.

[03:56] But, you know, but Jack's always reached for the moon.

[03:59] And, you know, I think sometimes that gets them into a place where it's overly complex.

[04:03] And they bite off maybe a little bit more than they should have to to make a good pinball machine.

[04:08] And they're going to be a good pinball machine profitable for the company.

[04:11] Now, now look, let's just talk about one thing.

[04:15] People are going to have Willy Wonka's before the 4th of July.

[04:18] That is awesome.

[04:20] All right, that is awesome.

[04:21] Now, now look, you know me on this podcast, that doesn't mean like, okay, we're done.

[04:26] Let's just, everything's good.

[04:27] No, there's going to be a period now in which a few things will happen.

[04:31] And here's what's going to happen.

[04:33] Obviously, people are going to be looking to see how the game is matured since the last streams of the game.

[04:40] And what's interesting about what's going to happen with Wonka is this.

[04:45] A lot of people who are in on Ellie's and C.E.'s are going to be looking very closely at people's response to the game.

[04:55] And now that it is out, now that it is in the home of buyers and out on location,

[05:01] now is the point in which the true reviews of the game will come out.

[05:07] Because when people stream the game and, you know, pinball media streams the game,

[05:12] it's hard for them to be completely bluntly honest about the experience with the game.

[05:17] Because, you know, you're playing the game early and you're the manufacturer has given you the opportunity to take it on a test drive.

[05:24] You know, the last thing you want to do is sort of be very critical of it.

[05:29] And now that it's out there, though, now that it's out there,

[05:33] we are going to get the opportunity for people to play it and give us their objective opinions.

[05:37] Now, we all know that the objective opinions from home buyers won't be as authentic probably as the opinions from people who play it on location.

[05:48] And here's why.

[05:49] Because when you buy something, you want to justify your purchase and you're more likely to say it's good.

[05:55] But if you play it out on location, it's not yours. You didn't own it.

[05:59] You're just playing it to see if it's fun and if it's rewarding experience.

[06:02] So I look forward to getting both of those reviews and feedback from the different players that are going to be jumping on this machine.

[06:09] But look, it's all going to happen very soon.

[06:11] Now, what's going to happen is this, you know, those Ellie and Cee guys,

[06:15] they're going to be watching very closely.

[06:17] Is this game? Is it the game for them?

[06:20] You know, I think everyone's going to love the way this game shoots.

[06:23] I've said it before. I'll say it again. This is the best shooting pat lauler,

[06:27] Jersey Jack game to date. It's the best shooting Jersey Jack game to date.

[06:31] It shoots so buttery smooth. You're going to love shooting this game.

[06:36] Okay. You're going to love shooting this game.

[06:38] And that's never been an issue with the game.

[06:40] I think the main thing people are going to see is how does the sound on the game?

[06:44] How does it feel to have that sound going repetitively in your home environment or on location?

[06:49] The music seems to be an issue for people and then the code.

[06:52] The big, the big question mark for most of us is how will the code mature?

[06:57] And we're going to find out. We're going to find out.

[06:59] We're not going to keep talking about it.

[07:01] But now it's great to just know that Jersey Jack is on a production timeline.

[07:07] Like we've always wanted them to be.

[07:10] And this speaks volumes and gets me really excited because if walk is shipping in June,

[07:16] that means that by the time we get to Q4, right, October, November,

[07:22] there's a very good chance that we will see guns and roses then.

[07:26] I don't know if it's guns or roses or toy story, but I think it's guns and roses.

[07:29] So this means that Jack can sell Wonka for many, many months and then show us the next title to get excited for.

[07:37] And if we get that game two months after it's revealed,

[07:41] all of a sudden start to feel like Jersey Jack is in the exact position they need to be.

[07:47] They need to be to start to chip away at that market share that Stern has and that we want them to sort of be successful.

[07:53] Nobody doesn't want Jersey Jack to succeed.

[07:57] Without them, there isn't as much innovation happening, pinball.

[08:01] There isn't as much going into these games.

[08:03] Let's not fool ourselves.

[08:05] They're trying harder than most to make pinball, you know, magical.

[08:10] And then again, and that doesn't mean that like other companies aren't trying as well, but we know, you know,

[08:15] this is the company that has put more in the machine in the last like five, six, seven years than anybody else.

[08:22] Okay, so Jack and everyone over there take a bow.

[08:25] You got the game out. I can't wait to play it.

[08:27] And when I love about being in New York, I'm sure sunshine is going to get one like this week or next week.

[08:32] They always get stuff immediately.

[08:35] So I look forward to jumping on it.

[08:37] All right, what else is going on? Like I said, the treasure chest in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[08:42] There is a thread on Pinside in which two individuals are working on solves to get the treasure chest to open and close the way Eric originally intended it to work.

[08:55] And I must say go in that thread and watch those videos.

[08:58] Very cool.

[08:59] I think for me, for me, the coolest part of this community and then the coolest stuff that happens on Pinside, right?

[09:05] When all the bickering stops, all the moaning and groaning like ceases, the way the community comes together to create solves for games and creates mods that make the games better.

[09:18] It is unbelievable.

[09:20] All of the people out there, all of you, you know who you are, you know, you little bird, the mod couple, mezzle mods, you know, back, is it back alley creations, you know,

[09:30] all you guys you create incredible mods for these machines take a bow because and all of you out there who are not even part of those companies, right?

[09:38] This is not from a company.

[09:39] This is just an individual who went on a mission to individuals to make that mechanism work the way it was supposed to.

[09:48] And it's so cool.

[09:49] There's two different approaches.

[09:50] One guy is using a servo to open and close it.

[09:54] It moves a little bit slower.

[09:55] Another guy is just created a bracket that attaches to the existing mechanism that just causes it to sort of spring up and spring down quickly.

[10:04] Both of them are really cool.

[10:05] I must say the servo one, I like the way it closes a little bit slower, but it seems like a lot more complex way to create the saw for it.

[10:14] But I must say that is what I love about pinball.

[10:16] As I look at my Batman 66 right now, this game came to life because of all of the mods that the mod couple made for it and mezzle mods too.

[10:26] Like the mods that are in this game made my super alley look like a super alley.

[10:31] It looked really cheap.

[10:32] The atomic pile mod to me goes down is like the greatest mod in pinball history.

[10:37] And I know it's not interactive, but it just makes the world come to life in such spectacular fashion.

[10:45] So as that is happening, is that enhancement is being developed by someone on the Jersey Jack pinball Pirates of the Caribbean community.

[10:53] Another enhancement has been shared with the pinball community that it couldn't help but laugh a little bit at.

[10:59] And that is, if you saw Jack Danger's stream of the black knight, the game that Stern took a risk on took a gamble on it.

[11:07] Do you think it's selling?

[11:09] I mean, is the black knight still going out the door?

[11:12] The Ellie and premium code update and the enhancements we were talking about on the last podcast were revealed to the world yesterday.

[11:20] Okay, and I don't really want to go into like the code changes because you know, it's like, that's fine.

[11:24] I just think it's funny that they they act it like we have exclusive code for premium and L. E's of the game.

[11:30] It's like, Stern, you always do that.

[11:32] Like whenever you have a code update, there's pro code and there's Ellie and premium.

[11:36] They're really trying, you know, they're trying hard to push out Ellie's and premiums of this game.

[11:42] I mean, it's clearly not selling.

[11:44] It is clearly not a hit.

[11:46] And so when we heard there were going to be physical enhancements to the game.

[11:50] I mean, it's like, male enhancements are coming to the black knight.

[11:53] You know, I fully felt like they're going to put like a shlong on the black knight mechanism in the middle of the game.

[11:58] But like, it turns out that the enhancements that Stern has been working on to make the black knight experience better

[12:05] are nothing more than a few plastics and a post that goes in the upper play field that allows the ball to deflect towards the flipper.

[12:14] You know, I really don't think these were like enhancements.

[12:17] I think that's a little bit of hyperbole.

[12:19] And it's just funny. I mean, they're free. They don't cost anything.

[12:23] If you want them, you can put them in your game. If you don't want them, you don't have to put them in your game.

[12:27] They're not really that necessary.

[12:29] I think a couple of them are just meant to prevent plastics from cracking.

[12:33] That's not an enhancement. It's funny. Stern really is trying hard.

[12:38] I think to move this title. And again, I mean, as watching the stream, it's like in the Stern kitchen, there's like nobody really in there

[12:45] but the four people who work on the game and Jack.

[12:47] And it's like, it's not going to take off.

[12:51] There's just no reason why this game is going to fly off the shelves.

[12:55] And we're seeing how easy it is to get this game for a second hand price.

[13:00] And why would you buy one new in box when you can save yourself a thousand two thousand dollars if you just wait?

[13:07] I mean, Ellie versions of this game are going to be selling for like seven thousand dollars like any day now.

[13:13] And we know it. It just keeps sinking and sinking and sinking.

[13:17] And look, am I in my glad they made the game? Am I not glad they made the game?

[13:21] I mean, I don't really care either way.

[13:23] I think that this game was always a big risk for Stern.

[13:28] And I think this game just shows that theme is everything. It is. It's everything.

[13:33] I mean, at the end of the day, you know, people ask me, do you think Willy Wonka is going to sell well or not if the code is this or that?

[13:38] Look, Willy Wonka is going to sell great because of the theme.

[13:41] Sometimes we forget that the majority of people who buy Pimble machines, they're not on Pinside, they're not these diehard collectors.

[13:48] They just simply are guys with game rooms and a lot of money and they just ask their distributor like, what do you got?

[13:55] You know, what will work well for me or my family? And they love buying stuff that they have an emotional attachment to.

[14:02] And for that, and that reason alone, I think Willy Wonka is going to be tremendously successful for Jersey Jack Pimble code or no code.

[14:10] Music or no music change. It's going to sell twice as many as dialed in.

[14:15] It will. And even though some of the Pimble purists might be like dialed in as a better game with better code and better modes and this and that and better music and it have David Thiel and all this, it doesn't matter.

[14:26] Willy Wonka will sell twice as many as dialed in on theme alone.

[14:30] All right, it'll blow away the sales of October fest. Even if you think October fest shoots better on theme alone.

[14:35] It'll blow away the sales of black night on theme alone. All right, and look, it's still a really good game.

[14:41] I mean, don't get me wrong. It's still a really good game. People will stand over that game when they go to a distributor and they play it or they played in an arcade.

[14:48] It's going to have immediate gratification for people that just will. All right. Now, black night, huge risk, game made for like die hard Pimble enthusiasts.

[14:57] You know, here's where I think Stern made the mistake with black night. And I've said it before I'll say it again.

[15:02] The mistake they made with black night, they had a chance to make this feel like a special Steve Richie game for those Pimble enthusiasts.

[15:12] And what they really needed to do was not release it with the same marketing strategy that they release every title.

[15:20] And by that, I mean, the three tiered system of Ellie premium and pro, I mean, $9,000, $7,500 and like $6,000.

[15:29] They basically put what should have been a more niche specialty game down the same journey as like a Batman or a Star Wars or a Deadpool, you know, or a Beatles, you know, not Beatles.

[15:44] But like, you know, you know, I'm saying they basically like a Ghostbusters, they just they just apply the same strategy with black night.

[15:51] And it's like, no, what they should have done is this. They should have done. We're making Steve Richie's like, you know, the third, the third installment in the Steve Richie trilogy.

[16:01] And we're only going to make whatever like 300 and charge 10,000 each. We're going to make like a thousand and that's it.

[16:10] They needed to limit the number of the total games they made. And they should have just made it like that. And they should have made 1000 in total and charged like whatever.

[16:19] And they probably would have sold everyone. But right now, none of them feel special. There's so many out there. There's so many waiting to be bought.

[16:26] And the game just feels like it's you just can't launch something like this the same way you can launch a title like a Batman or a Ghostbusters. And I think that's why it's failing. All right.

[16:36] Look, but look, let's talk Stern Pimball for a minute because Gary Stern talked and Gary Stern doesn't always talk. And he went on head to head Pimball podcast, which is great.

[16:47] I'm glad they got him on the show because I always like to hear from Gary's mouth because he just says stuff that is always very interesting. And I think he said a lot.

[16:56] Right. I was shocked by some of the stuff he said, but you know, two things that jumped out at me. It's what he said and how he says it.

[17:05] Now, when you listen to Gary talk, I mean, there's a level of smugness. There's a level of like ego. There's a level level of attitude.

[17:13] But I don't disagree with you know, Stern Pimball has weathered, you know, he kept talking about the Lehman Brothers crisis and the crash of the Lehman Brothers and how Stern survived in that 2008 period.

[17:25] And you have to give them credit for surviving that era like without them, there wouldn't be modern Pimball. And so, you know, I get where a lot of the arrogance and the sort of like the swagger comes from because it's true.

[17:39] If you for a moment think that without Stern Pimball, we'd have any of this Pimball scene going on and any of this resurgence, you'd be wrong. There wouldn't be any of it.

[17:49] And if Stern Pimball went away tomorrow, you know, Pimball, it might be like the Titanic going down. It might drag every, every other boutique with them, you know, down with the ship because they're just the driving force of Pimball in the world. And that's a great thing.

[18:06] Now, that being said, there is no way that we're stupid to the fact that you look at a game like Lord of the Rings and you look at a game like Simpson's Pimball party.

[18:20] And then you look at a game like Black Knight and you tell me that Lord of the Rings, which is like what $3,700 back when it came out, fully featured.

[18:30] And then there was no right there's no early you just everyone got like a fully packed game. And then if you want like all the bells and whistles on a Black Knight, it's $9,000.

[18:40] So there's no way to look at the modern Sterns and to not look at the Sterns that you know we look back with great appraisal and say the company did start to cut corners did start to get really cheap.

[18:54] They turned it around piece by piece and they have like Stern has like turned stuff around, but still still to this day we are not seeing full featured games in modern Sterns the way we did during Lord of the Rings and some of those other games were just not.

[19:10] I mean, it's impossible to really see like they've leaped forward where the innovations have happened with them has been the spike system.

[19:18] They finally have the LCD, but I want to bring up a few things that Gary said and and give my opinions about what he discussed.

[19:26] So first of all, he they talked a little bit about you know sponsored games so like Supreme and perhaps Blue Ribbon and Primus.

[19:34] And so here's what Sterns going to do. They're only going to use the PBR and Supreme format. I think it's like the Spider-Man, the stripped down Spider-Man game.

[19:46] Those two platforms are the two platforms they are always going to use when they make a third party license pin.

[19:54] So that is like I mean when I heard that I'm like yeah great well so like and it's super it's easy why they're it's easy for them to do that because they're not you know designing for the LCD.

[20:06] You know they're not they really can just poured over artwork it's the same game. It's just like you're really just paying to have artwork and some sounds changed and then you have your your personalized pinball machine.

[20:20] So when I heard that I was like well I think that just means like pinball buyers are going to be very weary of any of those like license games and so there's nothing really to look forward to there.

[20:30] So Gary talked about those 350 people working at Stern pinball every day and that's phenomenal. I mean when you hear that number then that's a huge company.

[20:40] And you look at some of these boutiques and they've got like 20 people in there 10 people trying to screw games together. You know when I go to Jersey Jack there's nowhere near 350 people at Jersey Jack pinball.

[20:51] I mean I would say like maybe like 50 people are walking through the door every day at Jersey Jack and it just goes to show you know the scale of Stern pinball when 350 people 50 of which are working in design.

[21:02] So like 300 of which are probably working on the manufacturing side of the company. That's incredible. It just goes to show how many you know the more hands you have the bigger the line can be the more games you can get out the more efficient you can make these things.

[21:16] That's absolutely a staggering number. Now here's the other part though they have to feed 350 mouths with every game they make. That's a lot of salary. That's a lot of money going out the door. You know I don't know if they have health insurance. I don't know you know but I didn't that's a lot of people.

[21:33] So so like so something Gary said was this he said we are underpricing the pro model of the game. I want to talk about that for a minute because I saw someone even started a pin side threat on that.

[21:46] Do you believe that Stern underprices the pro versions of their games and Gary said they did. Now look I'm trying to look at this two ways like well they have 350 people this huge factory like it's a lot of money to make those pinball machines.

[22:01] But then I remember something Nick Parks said and that the cost to make a stern pro is around 3500 dollars. So who's lying who's telling the truth. Now remember when Nick Parks said that you know what happened when he said that Stern called them up and got all mad and made him make me take down that comment.

[22:23] So why would they be mad if he said that. Why would they be so upset because it's probably true. So I do not believe on any level that a stern pro is under price. You know what it's under price because Gary would love like to make even more money on it.

[22:40] And they're making so much money. So the question is is hey Gary if the stern pro is under price. I got a question for you.

[22:49] Yes Gary is the stern Ellie is that overpriced. Would you answer us that. So if you're overpricing the Ellie and the premium is your pro then under price.

[23:01] They don't want to answer these questions. They know the answers to these questions. You know the answers to these questions the stern Ellie's and premiums were we are taking a bath as a consumer on those games. We are not getting the materials and the things inside those games that we should for that much money. You all know it. You all know it. You still keep buying a dub because it's the only game in town for the most part. All right.

[23:23] So Gary when he talks about other manufacturers he really does talk down about them. You could you could hear it in his voice. He's just like yeah you know those other guys you know trying to do stuff you know and this and that like he just sort of has this like there nobody to me and they mean nothing and I hope that's fuel to Jack to Robert Mueller to you know dovel and normal.

[23:48] I hope that's fuel to Chicago gaming company and it must be because Gary really is very smug like it is he really acts like he could care less about everyone else and I remember that picture of him standing over the big Lebowski just kind of be like and look look devil's advocate. Can you blame him for being smug all these other companies are coming in trying to make pinball machines the majority of them come in and fail to deliver and have lost a lot of your money.

[24:17] When you pay like Andrew highway money and you lose it and bury in the up money and you lose it you know Gary looks at it like that money could have gone to them and you could have had a game instead you simply like lost it by banking on someone else. All right something else was interesting so George Gomez when he made Lord of the rings he had the opportunity to make two games he wanted to make he really wanted to make something else other than the Lord of the rings and the game he wanted to make was the matrix.

[24:46] It's really interesting you know matrix is a theme that we've been hearing a lot about like people really want a matrix game and so what happened was this they were going to they were going to pursue both games but the matrix the second movie came out and was kind of a dud and they started to realize well Lord of the rings are like all really good.

[25:04] So maybe we should probably make the Lord of the rings which is what ended up happening and I think that was the right decision now look if you're going to make a matrix pinball machine I really would make one just based on the first movie I would not make them based on all three because the last two movies kind of sucked. All right what else does Gary say they're in a 14 month design schedule.

[25:25] So from concept to inbox 14 month is the window for the design of games a little like a year and two months so it just goes to show you know these games are worked on for a really long time and I think the reason why Gary was saying that is if they're not in love with a theme they're not going to pursue it because that's a long you know you're working on something for over a year you want to make sure something you're really passionate about what else to Gary say so this is great this is the ultimate shade against Jersey Jack pinball Gary said that what was going to happen is that the game is going to be a lot of things that are going to happen.

[25:55] Why body is way too expensive to make and it's the easiest way to like go out of business and look at I mean all you know Jersey Jack's whole philosophy has been wide body and put more into the games and Gary gives his rationale it's like there's more has to go into it which means more cost which means it's not worth it which means you have to charge more which means you know the chances of it failing are greater and all that and Gary says over and over and over again we're a business like don't get us wrong like we're not hobbyist we are a lot of things that are going to be a lot of things that are going to happen.

[26:25] We're a business and for pinball innovation to advance you need to make money to innovate and if you don't make money you can't innovate now that's a big question I have is do you think Stern pinball is the leader in innovation and pinball and is Gary accurate when he says that and I have to say no way no way

[26:49] Stern would keep making the games the way they've always made them if no if someone else didn't come in and create a more modern more innovative pinball experience and I think Gary needs to like go back and look at who's the first pinball company that put an LCD into the game was it Stern pinball no they didn't innovate that it was Jersey Jack pinball and it was other companies Stern was late to the game on that right that and so

[27:19] so like what innovations has Stern done that have been like you know you know I don't know I'm trying to think about it like do you consider spike one into an innovation I don't I don't really think it's like that that that just made them you know able to make the games cheaper

[27:36] but that's not like a leap forward and I haven't seen anything in a Stern game be like a radical innovation you know even like the artwork on the games like you know the rad cows and other things and and you know there's just nothing to me feels like they broke the barrier down and

[27:54] innovative pinball like they there's still no internet connectivity and when Gary talks about internet connectivity he talks about like you're going to be able to download code and it's like I mean that doesn't feel that innovative so we'll see what happens but look again I think Gary doesn't need to make bold

[28:11] statements like that like they're the ones that are pushing innovation pinball because they're not always that's not always the case and I think you have to sometimes give credit where credit is due and I'm not I'm not knocking Stern I'm saying that Stern has innovated the most important element of pinball

[28:31] and you know what that is I mean it's just it's just manufacturing they've found the way to manufacture and ship games across the globe and and you know to a lot of us that might just be the most important innovation because innovation in manufacturing gets people games faster allows them to make more titles every year

[28:52] and brings pinball to more people I mean yes Stern pinball is the company that is expanded pinball it is the company that is brought more people into pinball in the last like 10 years and any other company and they deserve credit for that they deserve credit for that but they also can give credit where credit is due like Gary you know he'll never say it but he could say look when we saw you know how good it looked when people were putting LCDs into the games we knew we needed to go there I mean they did not innovate that that includes

[29:21] inclusion in pinball all right he also says Beatles is the title of a lifetime and there's only nineteen hundred and sixty four Beatles available Gary clearly the marketplace and consumers do not agree with you and do not think it is the title of a lifetime it is why the games are still sitting for sale you guys again Gary hey Gary is the Stern diamond Beatles and platinum Beatles is that were they underpriced at twelve

[29:51] thousand five hundred and twenty five thousand dollars for a title hey Gary is is the eighty five hundred Beatles gold is that underpriced tell us again how much is it cost you to make that game all right let's go on don't he says this is what I love when they asked about the vault

[30:08] editions and we talked they talked about they asked about Lord of the Rings and you know and Tron and you always get the same answer like it's a possibility that's all they ever say like I'm so sick of hearing like it's a possibility like

[30:19] just just say yes or no like they just dangle the vaults over people's heads but I love it when Gary says you know I don't wait for vaults buy what's available now like buy the monsters buy Beatles buy black night you should you should not wait and hold on your money waiting for vaults because they might not come out so buy what's available he's such a salesman buy what's in box

[30:40] and you can you blame him I mean look for those of you waiting for Stern vault I think your dummies I don't think they're happening anytime soon

[30:47] and it is just so pathetic if you hold on your money waiting for a Tron vault all right what else did he say said 45% of games go overseas in the average age of the buyer isn't there mid 40s

[30:58] what what else did he say says he says if we don't exist they won't exist and he's right if they went under the boutiques would go under

[31:06] what else do do do okay so look here's my take on the whole thing it's like

[31:11] pinball is at a crossroads right now we are in the golden age of pinball there are more titles available to all of you than ever before I mean I hear people are liking October fest that's great

[31:25] Willie Wonka is shipping within two months of reveal that's great Stern's gonna have like Jurassic World in a month that's great we got guns and roses we got toy story we got a

[31:35] viral we got deep route coming at it from a whole different approach it's a great time to be in pinball

[31:41] the economy is held strong all of it is great all of it is moving in the right direction we have the best pinball podcasts going on in the world

[31:49] there's so many good ones out there we've got the best pinball streaming it's a good time to be in pinball

[31:55] so then the final question becomes is pinball a lifestyle right is Stern pinball a lifestyle company

[32:03] and I hear people like like you know they rag on Gary for saying that like it's a lifestyle company we've got t-shirts and we've got

[32:10] communities let me tell all of you right now that pinball is a lifestyle brand it is you spend a lot of your life

[32:19] thinking about pinball you wear a peril that is based on pinball you spend as much as a cheap car on a game made by a

[32:27] pinball company you go on to an internet forum every day and you talk about pinball you listen to pinball

[32:33] podcasts way more than you probably should you do all you do more about around pinball then you do in

[32:39] terms of eating well and exercising and probably making love to your significant other it is a lifestyle

[32:45] brand and you are in that lifestyle and I know you probably wouldn't have it any other way but just

[32:51] admit it that it is a lifestyle when you get sucked into the pinball hobby all right let me read a few

[32:57] emails and then I got to go all right so here's the deal I got an email from Ed see he says welcome back

[33:07] welcome back canada hope you had a great time on vacation now let's talk some damn pinball Ed thank

[33:13] you and I don't know do you want to come on the show I think that's what he's asking we'll get you on

[33:16] the show marked felt rates Chris let's play a little game and then he's got the puppet master from

[33:23] from was that saw he says when everyone gets their willy walkers before you the hype dies further

[33:30] and you still don't have yours you are so going to cancel your order in October when you still

[33:37] don't have your game and code is not progressed why does Jack punish the CE buyers I bet you that

[33:44] there will be used willy walkers available before you get your game well look first of all mark thank

[33:50] you for the the the challenge I think so here's the deal I'm still in on my willy walker collectors

[33:56] addition I see no reason to get my deposit back I still want to see how the game fully develops by

[34:02] the time collectors additions come out will there be used willy wonka elis for sale and this is

[34:09] interesting question and and I've said this I think jack might have made a real mistake pushing

[34:14] the elis to the end and making so many of them so if the if the le is nine thousand dollars

[34:20] and we've seen jersey jack games when they come out and they're making you know they're making

[34:24] five thousand elis so no one who has an le thinks the game's going to hold value because of its

[34:29] limited nature by the time the key sees come out a nine thousand dollar le if it's been out for

[34:35] like a couple months what do you think it will sell for use by the time jack is going to ask the

[34:41] CE buyers for their twelve thousand five hundred dollars now if history has shown us what happens

[34:48] nine thousand dollar jersey jack games will usually sink pretty quickly to like eight thousand

[34:55] dollars okay so that's let's just let's just hold it at eight thousand dollars for an le

[35:01] at the moment I'm asked to buy my CE it will be hard it will be hard to justify

[35:09] for every CE buyer if I can get the game in pretty much mint condition from a home buyer

[35:15] for four thousand five hundred dollars less I mean I really have to love the game and want the

[35:24] game and never want to like go the game to to spend forty five hundred dollars more now the problem

[35:30] I see is this this is the problem if jack we're making two hundred to two hundred and fifty

[35:35] C's fine but five hundred at you know twelve thousand five hundred dollars the more you think about it

[35:43] oh again like the game just needs to be magical it needs to be like a game like like you you know

[35:49] you're gonna own for life to go in at that level so like am I gonna bail time will tell time will

[35:55] tell but I'm just I'm still in on it so for those of you thinking I hyped it and I dumped it I have not

[36:01] I have not you can ask Joe Newhart at pinball star my deposit is still with him okay all right what else

[36:07] did I got to get another email from Jeff Jones so Jeff Jones Jr says welcome back you're my go to

[36:14] audio for my run home along the Hudson in your hiatus I've deferred to other pinball podcasts and

[36:20] I've seen my running pace drop drastically while enjoyable I guess discussions about the latest

[36:27] podcasting recording software audio equipment and travel routes to tournaments only get the heart

[36:34] racing so much glad to have your energy and enthusiasm back well Jeff thank you so much I'm glad I

[36:40] get the heart rate going I'm glad I increase your your rate and hopefully you know everyone who

[36:46] listens to this I bet I've made you guys lose a few pounds probably because you have a viewer like

[36:51] you know vomiting after hearing what I say all right I got an email from Steve sunshine laundromat

[36:56] Steve Paradis Chris so I was in Brooklyn over the weekend and I hit up sunshine cool little spot

[37:02] I noticed on my way out there's a big Lebowski on the shelf I was like wow damn why don't I get to play

[37:08] that is it new or is it broken what's the deal well Steve that game is broken and there are no parts

[37:14] for it and it has been sitting there collecting dust forever many writes October fest my local

[37:20] pinball spot the pinball gallery has it there they have over 70 pins amazing collection kept in great

[37:27] condition they pretty they buy pretty much every new release I have to say we enjoyed playing the

[37:31] game more than any other new title I can think of super fun and original I really care less about

[37:37] the art and the screen how often do you watch the screen when you play pinball well Steve look I

[37:43] agree man October fest is packed October fest is a lot in it October fest is fun to play you know

[37:50] the question just becomes is will people buy it well is it the game that you want to own and that

[37:55] is why I always say like theme matters so much because when when he comes in the door you want to

[38:01] make sure it's a theme that that you know really excite you and you want to keep all right what else
