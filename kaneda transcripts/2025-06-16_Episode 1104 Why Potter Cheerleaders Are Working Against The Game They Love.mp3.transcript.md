[00:00] Ah, Happy Monday morning everybody.

[00:21] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] I hope everybody had a great Father's Day weekend and we're going to talk about this

[00:28] week in Pinball.

[00:29] What's going on?

[00:31] We've got Predator coming out this week.

[00:33] We've got a great discussion happening around Harry Potter.

[00:36] I really hope Jersey Jack Pinball understands what this community is trying to do right

[00:41] now.

[00:42] There's still a lot of divisiveness, which I don't like to see.

[00:45] There's a lot of divisiveness within this community as people are trying to give constructive

[00:52] feedback about this game.

[00:53] I still feel and sense this unwillingness to just accept that.

[00:59] I get that you like the game.

[01:02] I get that you ordered the game, but the truth is this.

[01:06] 95% of people that have ordered a Harry Potter haven't even played it.

[01:12] It's hard to tell what this game is going to be like if you own it.

[01:18] It's easy for multi-millionaires to be like every time I play it.

[01:22] You put a smile on my face.

[01:24] Are you really waking up in a bad mood if you've got millions and millions of dollars

[01:29] and you're standing in front of a pinball machine?

[01:31] Are you really going to be hypercritical about a pinball machine?

[01:35] Then we've got people that are just maybe slamming it too hard.

[01:41] We're going to talk about Harry Potter.

[01:43] We're going to talk about what does it mean if you make pinball content and you get paid

[01:48] with a machine?

[01:49] Does that mean you can still give an objective opinion about said machine?

[01:55] We are also going to talk about Predator Pinball, which is coming out this Wednesday.

[02:00] Have they priced themselves out of the market?

[02:03] It's a lot more expensive than Alien was.

[02:06] We're going to talk about Stern Pinball.

[02:08] Is King Kong dead?

[02:10] Are they going to come out with Jaws 20th this week?

[02:14] Will it be the 20th of June?

[02:16] Did I say Jaws 20th?

[02:17] Jaws 50th anniversary, which is June 20th.

[02:21] So is that going to happen?

[02:23] And then how does Stern sort of like repair?

[02:26] What I believe is a damaged relationship between the collector community and its brand.

[02:33] Are their games just looking too cheap to justify the price of a Stern machine now that we have

[02:40] a Jersey Jack at 10 G's and 12 G's?

[02:44] Do we really feel like a Stern premium is worth it when Harry Potter is also available

[02:50] for 10?

[02:52] How's Predator going to survive at much more money than that?

[02:55] We're also going to talk about Dune Pinball.

[02:57] I've noticed that this game has been out now for a while and I don't see anybody unboxing

[03:05] it.

[03:06] Why did they reveal and release this game so early and can Dune Pinball somehow get

[03:12] people reignited into this theme?

[03:15] And I'm going to give you sort of my opinion and it's not looking great because of everything

[03:21] else going on in Pinball.

[03:22] So let's start with Harry Potter Pinball.

[03:25] So I've played this game a lot and I saw Triple Drain did a show on my Saturday show.

[03:32] I aired some of their commentary because I think everybody that's played this game is

[03:38] coming to the same conclusion.

[03:40] It is Eric's best design to date.

[03:44] It is the most fun Jersey Jack game to shoot to date.

[03:48] So we all agree on that.

[03:51] And then the big question mark becomes, but what about the code?

[03:55] What about the software?

[03:57] Is there like a real unsatisfying nature to the software and how it's currently coded?

[04:03] And I think universally everybody is feeling that this game is somewhat underwhelming because

[04:11] it doesn't make you feel a connection to the movies and it doesn't take you on a journey

[04:18] the way it should.

[04:20] Everything is on all at once.

[04:22] To start a movie, you have to hit the scoop on the far right.

[04:27] There's a lot of debate on whether or not that scoop is too hard to hit.

[04:31] The answer is in the middle.

[04:33] Is it easy to hit that scoop the way Guns N' Roses has the scoop up the middle?

[04:39] No, it's much harder to hit.

[04:41] You are not going to hit that scoop as much as you want to considering how often you're

[04:47] going to want to hit it.

[04:48] Is it as hard as Godzilla's scoop?

[04:51] Maybe, but that doesn't make this any better.

[04:53] I do think a somewhat difficult shot is not going to be satisfying because you can actually

[05:00] play a game and almost struggle to even start a single movie.

[05:06] I don't think everyone's going to have a problem.

[05:09] You're going to learn where that shot is at, but it is off the tip of that lower left flipper.

[05:15] It's not how I would have coded a game because you kind of never want someone to play Harry

[05:21] Potter or Pinball.

[05:22] Even a casual that walks up to the game should feel like and get the satisfaction of choosing

[05:29] their movie and getting into one of their favorite Harry Potter movies.

[05:34] The majority of casual players that walk up to this game will never experience that if

[05:42] that is the shot.

[05:43] They could change that with software.

[05:45] That's something that is fixable.

[05:47] But the big issue on this game.

[05:49] This is the thing I want to say before I talk about the big issue.

[05:52] The reason why so many people are giving feedback that is very constructive, very well thought

[05:58] out is simply this.

[06:00] We care about getting this game to where it should be because we love the way it shoots

[06:07] and we just want this game to be as good as it can be.

[06:12] If Jersey Jack listens to all the shills that are just saying this game is awesome, it's

[06:18] the best pinball experience I've ever had.

[06:20] If they listen to those customers, this game will never get better.

[06:26] I understand the code is at .72 or .70 but the game as it is is coded so bad.

[06:34] I don't understand if your Jersey Jack, the next .30 going into the code would just be

[06:40] more of what they've already been doing.

[06:43] There's not stuff missing from this game.

[06:46] I mean that.

[06:46] There's so much in it already.

[06:48] I don't play Harry Potter and feel like, oh, it's missing so much.

[06:53] The problem with Harry Potter is the overall way in which the entire game is coming at

[06:59] you, in which they bury the movie scenes, in which you don't feel any sense of accomplishment,

[07:05] in which everything is turned on at once.

[07:08] And so you've got this really great group of people and they're giving the greatest

[07:14] feedback because we want to see this game get better.

[07:18] I saw something on Pinside and I love watching the battle between Neil McRae and Bill Brandis.

[07:25] Bill Brandis is saying this is the greatest game he's ever played.

[07:29] It puts a smile on his face like nothing else and he's played it for hours and anyone that

[07:34] doesn't think this is great like shut up and he's getting all the upvotes.

[07:39] And Neil McRae is saying, hey, look, you know, I'm not saying the game doesn't shoot great,

[07:44] but Jersey Jack has lost the narrative on how to create moments and how to story tell

[07:50] in a pinball machine and he's getting all the thumbs down.

[07:55] And here's the thing is Bill is correct that this game shoots great and makes you want

[08:01] to come back for more.

[08:02] But Neil is also correct in that this game does a horrible job at storytelling.

[08:10] It does a horrible job of making you feel a moment like you're accomplishing something

[08:16] and that's what's crazy is both these guys are right.

[08:21] Yet one is getting celebrated for his positivity and one is getting downvoted because it's

[08:27] negative to say this game is failing on a code level.

[08:32] And here's what I think is going to happen.

[08:34] I think a lot of you guys that bought this game early, you're going to get it.

[08:38] There's still going to be a long way to get a Harry Potter, but I think everyone's going

[08:41] to see what I see.

[08:44] Everyone's going to feel what Joel and Travis saw at Triple Drain.

[08:48] Everyone's going to understand what Neil is saying and that's going to leave more of an

[08:53] indelible impression on you versus the gameplay because after you spend a few hours and you're

[08:59] in love with the gameplay, you're going to be so disappointed in how the code is.

[09:04] And then what?

[09:05] Right?

[09:06] And then what?

[09:07] How long are you going to have to wait to see if they fixed the code?

[09:10] And that is why if I were you, there's no reason to rush to buy this game.

[09:15] They're going to make so many of them.

[09:18] They've sold so many of them.

[09:19] And I also, if I were you, I would get the Wizard Edition with the Radcals.

[09:24] I think it looks better.

[09:26] You notice how they're not really showing the Wizard Edition very much.

[09:29] They want to sell as many CEs as they can and they've done a good job.

[09:33] They've sold a lot of CEs of this machine.

[09:36] So speaking of CEs, I was happy to see Retro Ralph because we were going back and forth

[09:40] on this privately and you know, he's always mad at me for some reason.

[09:44] He always accuses me of not playing enough pinball.

[09:47] And then if I just played more, I'd understand how great Avatar is.

[09:52] Okay.

[09:53] Yeah.

[09:54] Sure.

[09:55] Whatever.

[09:56] Avatar a lot.

[09:57] I don't own the machine.

[09:58] It's always funny to me when people who own these machines are on a mission to change

[10:03] our minds.

[10:04] There's a reason why avatars didn't sell very well.

[10:07] And it's not because I was dogging on it.

[10:09] It's just a game that people don't want.

[10:12] And that's the thing.

[10:13] It's like the code itself is the number one reason people don't want that game.

[10:18] And then mechanically, it's a pretty empty game.

[10:21] And that's why we don't see the value in that game at like 12 to $15,000.

[10:26] He did a great feature ret for the Harry Potter game.

[10:30] He had exclusive access to filming the team and the games.

[10:34] I'm not sure if he set up that whole medieval set, but it was a really great, what was it,

[10:39] like 20 minute feature ret on the Harry Potter game.

[10:42] The making of it did a great job.

[10:44] So the lot of machines for Jersey Jack, I think that feature ret is one of the main

[10:49] reasons everyone's going in on the CE is you hear Eric's excitement around the artwork

[10:54] and it makes you want one.

[10:56] So to pay Ralph to make that content, he was given a Harry Potter collector's edition

[11:02] machine as payment.

[11:05] Now you know how I feel.

[11:06] You should never do anything in life you're good at for free.

[11:10] So I do want to congratulate Ralph on making in one single day, the most amount of money

[11:16] any pinball content creator has ever made $15,000.

[11:19] I mean, I've got a podcast for a bunch of months before I can get even that.

[11:24] And that's $15,000.

[11:26] I kind of after taxes because you'd have to make $30,000 before to buy a $15,000 machine

[11:35] and he's just unboxing it.

[11:37] So that's good.

[11:38] Now look, the other part is this though, when you start making content on behalf of a company,

[11:45] you also do lose the ability to objectively review that company's products because you're

[11:52] not going to want to lose access to that company and you're not going to want to piss these

[11:56] people off.

[11:57] And that's fine.

[11:59] That's fine.

[12:00] And that's why, you know, when I do this show and people are like, oh, you're just mad

[12:03] because you didn't get access.

[12:05] Oh, you're jealous because you don't get predator content.

[12:07] No, I don't care about any of that.

[12:09] I don't.

[12:10] I don't need to give you scoops.

[12:12] I don't need to give you early access to stuff.

[12:15] That's not why you're here.

[12:16] The reason you're here is when stuff does happen in pinball, which isn't very frequently,

[12:22] but when a game does come out, you are here because you know that I'm in nobody's back

[12:28] pocket.

[12:29] You know that I'm not going to hold back how I feel about a game because they paid me.

[12:35] And you know, I don't care about any of that access.

[12:38] My whole thing, and I've been in this for 12 years and notice how so many of the extremely

[12:44] positive pinball content creators, and there's a lot of them now, how so many of them have

[12:51] just popped up over the last three to four years.

[12:53] They weren't in it with us.

[12:55] They weren't following this hobby.

[12:57] They weren't making content until now.

[13:01] And it's funny because the last four years, I would argue, have had some of the most

[13:05] underwhelming games in pinball.

[13:07] And yet we have the largest amount of positivity I've ever seen in pinball content as the most

[13:13] overpriced games and underwhelming games have come out.

[13:17] And that's what the manufacturers want.

[13:21] You don't even need Zach many to say bye, bye, bye anymore because all these guys will

[13:26] say it for him.

[13:27] We're just never going to do that.

[13:29] We're going to keep calling it as we see it.

[13:31] As I see it, Harry Potter code right now, it really needs a lot of work.

[13:36] So much is there, but it's all coming at us at once.

[13:41] And they really need to go back and rework the entire foundation of how this game is

[13:47] going to be coded.

[13:49] And I'm worried they're not going to do that.

[13:51] But the feedback they've been getting has been very constructive.

[13:55] And if they were smart, they would invite into Jersey Jack, they would call in five

[14:01] to seven people to give them true feedback, like let them sit down with Joe Katz, let them

[14:08] sit down with Eric Minier.

[14:10] Let them sit down with the JJP team.

[14:12] And I would do a focus group because this is going to be a game they're going to make

[14:17] for years.

[14:18] And if they get it right, trust me when I say this, it will be a masterpiece if they get

[14:24] it right.

[14:25] But as it is, it's so far from that because gameplay is not enough to overcome the issues.

[14:32] And I think the reason why a lot of us are giving feedback is we know they can make it

[14:38] better.

[14:39] Think about another game.

[14:41] Think about Star Wars, right?

[14:42] Star Wars was a game where the reason why we didn't even care about giving much feedback

[14:48] is the things that sucked in Star Wars, we could not change.

[14:52] Yeah, nobody liked the stacking of the modes, but the physical game of Star Wars is atrocious.

[14:59] It's not fun to shoot.

[15:01] It's so cheap.

[15:03] It looks so mailed in.

[15:05] And nothing that we said was ever going to change a tie fighter on a spring or that

[15:10] lazy use of the screen or the really overly difficult shot to get into the hyperdrive.

[15:16] Talk about a hard shot.

[15:18] I've played Star Wars so much, way more people are going to hit the scoop in Harry Potter

[15:23] than ever get into the hyperdrive of Star Wars.

[15:25] And so because Star Wars was just such a mess, we didn't even bother.

[15:30] But Harry Potter, because it shoots so well.

[15:33] The reason why we're giving so much good feedback is because they can fix this game.

[15:39] All right, so speaking about fixing a game, let's go on to Dune next because I'm looking

[15:45] at two games that have just recently come out.

[15:48] And if you look at the Harry Potter hype thread, it's like 170 pages long.

[15:54] If you look at the Harry Potter owners club, it's even got like 20 or 30 pages already.

[16:00] Dune came out before Harry Potter.

[16:03] The Dune hype thread is something like 10 to 20 pages long at most.

[16:10] The Dune owners club thread.

[16:12] Remember this game's been out now for I believe over a month.

[16:16] The Dune owners club thread.

[16:19] Because Dune launched the same week as King Kong.

[16:21] Think about how many King Kongs are out there in the world.

[16:25] Have you seen any customers unboxing Dune machines?

[16:30] And so their owners club is only four pages long.

[16:36] So how is barrels going to get new orders of this game?

[16:42] And we're not even seeing any conversation.

[16:46] And this is the difference between Dune and Harry Potter.

[16:50] The reason why there's so much conversation around Harry Potter is people care about the

[16:55] Harry Potter franchise.

[16:57] They love the Harry Potter franchise and they want to see Harry Potter become as great of

[17:04] a game as it can be.

[17:06] And the reason why I think it's crickets over in the Dune pages is I just don't think anybody

[17:13] cares.

[17:14] And that's the worst place you want to be.

[17:17] You don't want to create something that people don't have an opinion about.

[17:22] It doesn't move them to even engage.

[17:25] And that is why I think it's going to be really hard.

[17:28] And it's also why as a theme and I've been saying this you've been saying it selecting

[17:33] Dune was never a good idea.

[17:37] There's going to be a lot more conversation happening around Predator than Dune because

[17:43] a lot more people in this hobby care about the Predator IP.

[17:48] I'm not saying that Predator is going to be a better game than Dune but deep inside most

[17:54] of the pinball buying demographic you would rather have a Predator game than a Dune game.

[18:02] Especially the modern Dune movies which aren't something that you're just like dying to own.

[18:08] And the reality now is this none of these games are cheap.

[18:12] How much is a Dune going to cost you when you finally get all the accessories and the

[18:17] topper how much out the door is that game going to be.

[18:21] It's going to be over $13,000 with a topper over that easily closer to $14,000.

[18:29] And so the whole barrels of fun sort of communication was we're giving the best value to customers

[18:35] in pinball.

[18:36] Can you now say that when a Dune machine will be $4,000 more than a Harry Potter machine

[18:45] the $10,000 arcade edition because in the end the pinball things that matter the most

[18:51] are the gameplay.

[18:52] It's the code of the game.

[18:53] Those are the things you're really going to experience the most.

[18:56] It's not going to be the radcals.

[18:58] It's not going to be the topper.

[19:00] Yeah, you might have to add a shaker motor to the entry level of Harry Potter.

[19:04] But other than that, that's a 40% cheaper game.

[19:08] It's going to get brutal.

[19:10] And now I'm seeing that the predator price is not cheap.

[19:13] It's like $11,000 or $12,500.

[19:17] There's going to be two different editions.

[19:20] It's a lot more money than Alien was.

[19:23] And I just don't know how many people are keen on writing checks for 10 to 13 to $15,000

[19:30] one on top of another.

[19:32] If I'm an operator, sure, I'll take the new stuff because I can make money off of it.

[19:37] But as a home buyer, are you going to keep buying these things left and right?

[19:43] I just saw how many of you out there bought Avatar CE.

[19:47] Now they're $11,000, another $4,000 loss on a game.

[19:53] And King Kong LE is going to be next.

[19:55] You're going to start to see all these Kong LEs for $10,000, another $3,000 loss.

[20:01] Jack Danger posted that they've got people working on the X-Men LE code.

[20:07] I hope they make that game great, but it's never going to recover.

[20:11] Like the value of the game is never going to recover.

[20:14] There's just too much happening.

[20:16] And Ralph isn't wrong.

[20:18] Once we make up our mind on something, it's really hard to change people's minds.

[20:24] See I heard that like Avatar had this big code update and now the game is better.

[20:28] Well, so then why'd you launch it?

[20:32] How many of you out there would go to a movie for $30?

[20:36] Think about this.

[20:36] How many of you would go see a movie for $30 where the movie wasn't finished?

[20:41] They didn't put in all the special effects.

[20:43] They didn't put in all the lines of the actors.

[20:45] All the scenes weren't even filmed.

[20:47] And you go see it because you know what?

[20:49] We've got enough to show you some stuff.

[20:51] How many of you would go back and watch the movie again if your first experience with it wasn't that satisfying?

[20:59] So you know how I feel?

[21:01] None of these games should be released early.

[21:03] None of these games should make consumers be guinea pigs for the quality.

[21:07] None of these games should make you wait a year before everything's in it.

[21:11] Ridiculous.

[21:12] Name me another product you buy that you wait an entire year before it's complete.

[21:17] And is that being negative, grumpy, weirdo, canada is saying that he's tired of watching his friends lose $3,000 to $5,000

[21:27] on every single collectible pin because these companies release them too early and then you lose all of your money

[21:35] and then by the time the game is complete you can buy it for $3,000 to $5,000 cheaper.

[21:40] What a grumpy weirdo.

[21:42] You should come over to my channel and I'll cheer lead the game on day one.

[21:46] I'll buy it for full price even though I'm not disclosing all the discounts I'm getting from my distro friends on my channel.

[21:53] And no, I'm not talking about you Ralph so don't come at me now.

[21:56] I'm not even talking about you.

[21:58] You know who I'm talking about.

[21:59] So anyway, I mean that's kind of where we're at.

[22:01] That's kind of where we're at.

[22:03] I think in the end there's only one company I'd want to be right now.

[22:07] Well, look Jersey Jack is going to be swimming in the pot or money.

[22:10] It doesn't matter what anyone says.

[22:11] They're going to sell a ton of these games.

[22:14] But the company I'd want to be is just spooky.

[22:16] They launched their game, $888,000.

[22:19] They sold all of them in just a few months and now they just get to make Evil Dead.

[22:24] You don't see anybody complaining about Evil Dead.

[22:27] You don't see it.

[22:28] Like people realize that Evil Dead is maybe the second most beautiful game in all of Pimbal right now.

[22:34] Maybe the most beautiful.

[22:35] The code is great.

[22:37] It makes you feel like you're playing the Evil Dead movies.

[22:40] Even if you don't like the Evil Dead movies too, that game makes you feel such a connection to the moments in the movie

[22:47] and the way it connects to the gameplay and the mechs.

[22:50] It's genius.

[22:51] That game is way better coded than Harry Potter.

[22:55] And that's the thing.

[22:55] It's like sometimes simplicity is important when you're playing a Pimbal machine.

[23:02] And this is why I said as of today, Guns N' Roses code is way better than Harry Potter code.

[23:08] Because when you're playing a Pimbal machine, you just want to know what you're doing.

[23:13] You want stuff to light up on the game to help you feel a sense of accomplishment.

[23:18] And when everything's lit up at once and everything's crashing over itself, it's not fun.

[23:25] It's not.

[23:26] Evil Dead is fun.

[23:28] And when you get into a moment, it's fun.

[23:30] And you feel this sense of accomplishment as you're going through the modes.

[23:36] The modes aren't just like timing out after 30 seconds the way they are in Potter.

[23:40] You play Potter.

[23:41] You don't even realize what's happening.

[23:43] You don't even realize what's ended and what's begun.

[23:47] The whole thing, it's so bad when you're in a movie.

[23:51] And Evil Dead is the absolute opposite.

[23:54] And you're not allowed to say this, Kaneda.

[23:56] You got to tell the company line, you're never going to get your free machine.

[24:00] I'm never going to get it.

[24:01] I'm never going to get my free Pimbal machine.

[24:04] But what I want to do is just get these games better.

[24:08] And I think the Pimbal buying community just needs to be patient.

[24:13] If you buy Potter now, trust me, you're going to get bored with it after a week.

[24:18] The way the game is coded.

[24:20] Everybody, happy Monday.

[24:22] How is it, man?

[24:22] Happy Monday.

[24:23] We're going to get Predator today.

[24:25] I didn't talk much about Predator.

[24:27] Oric Lawson is on the artwork.

[24:29] He did the art for Alien.

[24:31] Was not a great art package on Alien.

[24:34] I'm worried about the art package.

[24:35] I don't think we're going to see any of the characters from the movie.

[24:38] But I don't even want to talk about this game because we're going to see it in like two days.

[24:43] And we can wait.

[24:44] A lot of Predator conversations going to happen.

[24:47] And I'll wait until another show this week to talk about Stern and where does Stern go now?

[24:52] We're going to talk about that.

[24:54] But yeah, it does feel like King Kong conversation has died down.

[24:58] It's just the way it is.

[24:59] And so the last thing I want to say is there's a new picture of Harry Potter and Dimple Gate.

[25:03] Let me just tell you this right now, gang.

[25:05] Every Miracle Playfield, dimples like this.

[25:08] Every single one.

[25:10] My Guns N' Roses has a lot of dimples.

[25:13] But here's the thing about dimples.

[25:15] You don't notice any of them when you're at a normal player's angle.

[25:20] It's only when you lean and put like your ear on the glass.

[25:24] Do you see more of those dimples?

[25:26] It doesn't bother me on G&R.

[25:28] When I was playing Harry Potter, I saw a bunch of dimples.

[25:32] You're not even going to notice it.

[25:33] So that's just me encouraging everybody.

[25:36] Don't try to make another Dimple Gate moment happen.

[25:40] In 2025, you're going to get dimples.

[25:43] If you want the clear coat, that's glossy like this.

[25:47] Go look at a King Kong and there's not as many dimples, but it doesn't look shiny.

[25:52] In fact, I've been seeing King Kong photos where the artwork is chipping off near the magnet.

[25:58] And damn, I don't want to see that happen because if that's happening,

[26:02] the only solution is fully populated playfields.

[26:05] And Stern's not going to send those out, especially on a game not doing very well.

[26:09] The quality people.

[26:11] It's all about quality.

[26:13] For this much money, you shouldn't have to be pulling your games apart.

[26:16] You shouldn't see artwork chipping off.

[26:18] And again, just wait, wait.

[26:21] Let the early buyers be the guinea pig suckers and you will be able to buy all this stuff for so much cheaper.

[26:29] Your grumpy weirdo, Kaneda signing off.

[26:31] Have a great Monday.

[26:39] I don't mind.

[26:41] I'm a legend.

[26:43] I don't mind.

[26:45] I'm a legend.

[26:47] I'm a legend.

[26:49] I don't mind.

[26:51] I'm a legend.

[26:53] I'm a legend.

[26:55] I'm a legend.
