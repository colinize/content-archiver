[00:00] Because though the truth may be this,

[00:03] Shift will carry on,

[00:05] While he's safe to show.

[00:08] Hey,

[00:10] To listen to a word I say,

[00:13] Hey,

[00:14] The screams all sound the same.

[00:17] Hey,

[00:18] Hey,

[00:20] Hey,

[00:21] Hey,

[00:23] Good Monday morning, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:25] Welcome to episode 239 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:29] I hope everyone out there had an amazing Mother's Day weekend.

[00:32] I spent a bunch of time with my mama.

[00:34] I love her more than anything.

[00:36] She's incredible.

[00:37] She is the reason I am the way I am.

[00:39] She's an incredible Sicilian woman,

[00:41] Super strong, super powerful,

[00:43] And does whatever she wants in this world.

[00:46] And I love her for that spirit.

[00:48] So thanks mom.

[00:49] But because I know you're not listening to this podcast.

[00:52] What are we going to do on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast?

[00:56] Is I interviewed Dave Sanders again from Highway Pimball.

[01:00] Now Dave reached out to me and wanted to chat again.

[01:03] After he saw the Andrew Highway interview,

[01:06] He wanted to share more of his story.

[01:08] And I want to talk about for just a few seconds.

[01:11] Why I think it's important that we capture the stories from the people

[01:17] Who were involved in Highway Pimball.

[01:19] And I know that there are some people out there.

[01:21] And you know who they are.

[01:22] The guys who live on their computers, live on Pinside.

[01:25] They're literally just, they need to have people respond to their Pinside post.

[01:30] They want this topic to go away.

[01:32] They want to just bury the story and move on.

[01:35] And here's the thing.

[01:37] Here's the thing.

[01:38] This is a seven year saga.

[01:40] And if you wanted to just go away in like seven days after the company collapses,

[01:46] That's on you.

[01:47] But I think those people involved with Highway Pimball.

[01:50] They finally deserve to have their story told.

[01:53] And the reason why I feel that way is many of them.

[01:56] We're prevented from sharing their story with you because of fear,

[02:01] Because of NDAs and other issues that made these individuals have to bite their tongue

[02:08] All while they watched Andrew Highway be the salesman.

[02:12] Be the guy who was getting the pats on the back.

[02:15] Be the guy who was uploading videos.

[02:17] So you're going to hear a lot from Dave Sanders of what it was like

[02:20] And what was going on at Highway Pimball and his reactions to hearing the things Andrew said about his voluntary pay and stuff like that.

[02:29] And also just finally, Dave Sanders is a friend of the show.

[02:33] And I've always been very friendly with Dave.

[02:35] And I feel like talking and getting this stuff out there is very therapeutic and helps Dave.

[02:41] And I'm happy that we provide that platform.

[02:44] And I do.

[02:45] I think it's an important story to be told.

[02:47] And if you don't want to hear it, you can always turn off this podcast.

[02:51] But based upon my numbers, we are actually getting more people listening when we're covering this alien pimball debacle.

[03:00] Then some of the other shows we've done recently.

[03:02] So I think you also want to hear these stories as well.

[03:05] All right.

[03:06] Speaking of stories, I reached out to Stern Pimball with a very simple question.

[03:12] And I basically said that I would love to interview Stern employees and designers and artists more often.

[03:20] And here's why I said to Zach, I wrote to Zach and I said, Zach, you know, when George Gomez got up there at Texas Pimball Festival and he shared the story of what went into the making of Guardians of the Galaxy.

[03:33] I thought it was incredible.

[03:35] And we all know that Stern Pimball has all of these incredible, hardworking people coming together to make these Pimball machines happen, happen on a frequent basis.

[03:46] You know, they're bringing the themes you love to life in a Pimball machine.

[03:50] But I always feel like the stories that go into making these games are never really told.

[03:56] You know, it's like we know Stern's not on the forums.

[03:59] We know that they don't always upload videos like the making of these games.

[04:04] And I just, for the life of me, I don't know why they don't wrap in, you know, they don't wrap these games within a context that makes you understand what went into making them.

[04:17] And here's why I think those stories are great because when you hear the stories of what goes on to make these games, it gives you a more personal connection to the game itself.

[04:27] Right? I think when we first had Christopher Franci on here to talk about the making of Batman 66, what I love about that interview, and I do implore that Zach and Mr. Gomez and the people over at Stern, go listen to that interview because Chris tells the true story of what went into making the game.

[04:46] And I'll tell you what happens when you listen to that story.

[04:49] You come out of that interview with a greater appreciation for what went into making the game, for how amazing it was that, you know, what he pulled off in such a short time period.

[05:02] And it makes you have a story to tell about the game itself.

[05:06] And that's what happened when I saw the Guardians of the Galaxy video of everything that went into making the game because all that context was MIA or was not available to people when the game was revealed.

[05:18] And so it happens, right? A game gets revealed and you have all these people that are just looking at a rendering of a pinball machine and what happens?

[05:28] They start complaining about this or that or the artwork or that. You know, there's always that immediate feedback.

[05:35] But what they don't have is John Borg talking to us about designing the game. You know, he's nowhere to be seen.

[05:43] We don't have Lyman Sheets talking to us about coding Batman and what his vision is for the game.

[05:49] We don't have anybody really sharing these great stories. And I feel like the stories are lost. They are lost and they are delivered well past the moment of excitement and hype that we have for these games.

[06:03] And I know that, you know, it's so to me, like when I interview Christopher Franchi, when I interview Zombie Yeti, when I interview George Gomez, when I interview Jack from Jersey Jack, I just feel like all the interviews I've done have been very positive.

[06:19] I don't think I've ever done an interview with anybody where someone would listen to it and say that I was disrespectful to say that they came out of that interview feeling worse about the subject matter.

[06:32] So I interviewed, I'm sorry, I emailed them asking to tell these stories and how I would love to use more of the air time for this podcast to tell those stories.

[06:41] And I basically was told that no, not it's not going to happen that Stern people are not going to come on the show. It's not the right time for it.

[06:50] And it was sort of like a blanket no that I saw that I guess that means that Zombie Yeti is not going to be allowed to come on the show.

[06:57] And I really do, you know, think it's unfortunate that Stern is taking this hard line approach with this podcast. I almost feel they're perturbed by the show.

[07:09] And I get it and I walk that fine line on this show of, do I, if I say things and if I take an approach to how I deliver pinball news and my opinions about pinball, it is going to ruffle some feathers.

[07:23] So I have to do the juggling act right of do I, do I take a softer approach on the manufacturers in hopes that they will come on the show and I can interview them for you.

[07:36] Or do I tell you what I really feel? Do I deliver the show in a more hard hitting way with more impact? And you know me, I'm always going to choose the latter.

[07:47] I don't want this show to become watered down and to hold back because I'm worried what the reaction is going to be at a certain manufacturer.

[07:56] And I think you listen to this show because of that. I don't think you want me to become, you know, a shield for any manufacturer. And so I think that's the way this show will remain.

[08:08] But I also implore Zach and George Gomez to go listen to all the interviews this show has ever done. Not only do they always get the most amount of people listening, I also think it's highly, highly beneficial for Stern to engage a bit more.

[08:23] Whether it's on this show or whether or not, you know, I think they're going to go on Christopher Franchise podcast. He's going to be interviewing them. And that's great. That's great.

[08:33] The thing about this too, and this is just me talking directly to Zach, like Stern has nothing to be defensive about. They sure they have some issues here and there that they'll deal with.

[08:44] But no one from Stern is going to come on and get grilled. And I'll tell you why because Stern actually puts machines and boxes and gives people the opportunity to buy what they'd like multiple times a year.

[08:58] And for that reason and that reason alone, I think Stern is the only major pinball player in town. And that's why I own Stern pinball machines. That's why if you ask me what machines am I most excited about coming out? It's Stern pinball machines.

[09:14] You know why? Because I am 100% certain they are coming out. You know, I think also what Stern gets mad about with this show is that I don't, I kind of spoil the party a little bit.

[09:27] And they're, see in their minds, they're trying to protect their IPs and protect their launch schedule and protect information about their games. And I get that. I get that. It is to no benefit for them to have stuff leak early.

[09:41] You know, they're still trying to find out how Ghostbusters leaked. But now you know, they, it's a thorn in their side that we are confirming on this show that Deadpool is next that the monsters is coming out in October.

[09:56] Expo around the Expo time period. You're going to see both the monsters and the Beatles. Right. Those, that's going to happen. The Beatles is a Kapow title.

[10:07] Now look, I didn't start these rumors. These rumors have been out there for a while. And I know it upsets them. It really upsets them that there's some visuals and images of those games that are out there.

[10:20] Visuals and images of those games that I will not share with anybody. And that's just, see that's the line that I won't cross is doing something that's going to actually damage the company.

[10:32] But it probably gives them a lot of anxiety that that stuff is out there. And it shouldn't be. It shouldn't be. You know, at the end of the day, nobody who works at a company should share sensitive materials with anybody out there.

[10:46] It doesn't matter how excited you are to work on a project. It doesn't matter how excited you are about a title that's coming out down the road.

[10:53] Being a professional in any industry requires that you put the company's best interest first. And I understand that. I work on projects all the time.

[11:04] And if people on my team shared what we were planning to do and it got out there, I'd be fired. Our team would be fired. I mean, that's just the way the world works.

[11:15] And then there's a lot of a lot at stake. But it's a little bit different in my industry. Like if I'm working on something for Budweiser and that leaks, that's a huge issue.

[11:24] If a pinball game leaks or images of a pinball game leak, it doesn't matter. Here's why it doesn't matter. There is no competition out there for Stern. There's none. There's a zilch.

[11:36] If a competitor of Stern learns what Stern is doing, there is nothing they could even do to mobilize and take advantage of that information.

[11:45] See, the thing is, the only person it hurts is Stern themselves that you will wait and hold on to your money and you'll wait for the next title if you know what it's going to be.

[11:56] If you know the next title is going to be Deadpool and you don't really like Iron Maiden, they still want you to buy Iron Maiden.

[12:04] And they don't want you to know what the next three titles are going to be because then you might hold on to your money for eight months versus spending it.

[12:11] And they know, Stern also knows that you're fnaddicted to buying pinball. That you might buy two or three if you don't know what all three will be at once if we slowly trickle them out. You'll buy everyone.

[12:25] Alright, let me stop there and just say look, I would love for Stern people to come on the show. I would love for Zach and George to allow the people who work at Stern Pinball to come on here and tell their stories.

[12:37] I think there's a great passionate Stern buyer base that listens to every one of these episodes and I think it's only to their benefit to get those stories out there.

[12:49] And I do think, you know, they should compartmentalize the show a little bit. And in the sense that like, Canadian interviews are a little bit of a different show than Canada is just, you know, ranting and raving other episodes.

[13:01] Now I do get that my ranting and raving episodes. It might just prohibit me from getting those interviews in the future.

[13:07] And there's nothing I can do because the show's not going to change. Alright, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[13:12] I saw on this week in pinball Robert Mueller said he might make a $50,000 game for me. Robert, that's awesome. Where can I pre-order that game? How much do you need down on that? Can you imagine that?

[13:23] 10% down on a game could one day be $5,000. No, look, do I think people would buy a $50,000 pinball machine? Only if you made a one of a kind, big trouble in little China with full licensing rights, would I spend $50,000 on a pinball?

[13:41] But even then, it's just kind of getting stupid. I think the max price for a pinball game, I do. I think the most you can really ask for people to buy for a new inbox machine is between $15,000 and $18,000.

[13:56] Now again, it's all going to come down to supply and demand and what is the theme? People are not going to, you know, I don't...

[14:05] I don't... That's the thing. Nobody wants to spend $12,500 on pirates of the Caribbean. Nobody. Like nobody. And I keep wanting to feel something more for that game. And I'll tell you why, because I do think it looks awesome.

[14:21] But when I just see pirates of the Caribbean and I watch the gameplay and I see the $12,500 price tag, I just for the life of me, I don't get that I need to own this game no matter what it costs.

[14:36] And, you know, Jack just continues to not understand how to do the Ellie in terms of the pricing. Stern sold every single Iron Maiden Ellie, right? I sold mine for well above MSRP.

[14:49] And many others have sold theirs for well above MSRP. Stern knows how to make a game, 500 of them, that make more than 500 people say, I need to own this game. And I'm willing to pay even more than what Stern thinks it's worth.

[15:03] And then guess what? They sell everyone, all right? Now I'm here to also tell you that I got a little information on Iron Maiden Ellie, that the decals on the side of the game, they are not the same metallic decals that are on Batman SLE.

[15:18] And I kept trying to look at them, like is it like Batman does it have like the texture does it have like the depth. And I heard from a friend of mine who has both Iron Maiden Ellie and Batman SLE and says they're nowhere near as nice as the Batman decals.

[15:33] I think they're more, I also heard that they're not even as like impressive as the decals on Iron Man Vault Edition, that that actually has even more of a metallic foil look to it.

[15:45] It doesn't change the fact that I think the artwork is f and amazing. And I am, I am jelly watching you guys open your Iron Maiden Ellie as I think the game looks phenomenal. All right. All right.

[15:55] Let's read some mail. Then we're going to do the interview with Dave Sanders. And I think you're going to enjoy it. And then I got to go to work and hit the gym maybe sometime the day as well. Let's see. All right. I got an email.

[16:09] Okay. Here we go. From Hugh, Hugh, thank you for listening to the show. He said TNA uses P rock. The first thing that Jerry developed was the P rock board set, which Scott used to develop TNA.

[16:27] And maybe Lexi isn't that interesting, but at least give Jerry accolades for what he did for the home brew makers without Jerry. There would be no TNA Alice Cooper and American Pimball used the boards as well.

[16:41] All right. I also got the same sort of email from Tim went about the irony of multi-morphic and how Jerry's system also powered the game TNA and American Pimball and other games as well. And so here's why those emails came in because I said that Jerry when he made multi-morphic should have just made a game the way Scott did and used parts off the shelf and made a Pimball machine and had people buy it.

[17:09] And then that was seven years ago or six years ago, right? And then people reminded me that without Jerry's P rock system there would be no TNA. So I appreciate that. And yes, I will give Jerry the accolades for making the P rock engine. And I think that engine has led to so many fun home brew and sort of small boutique Pimball ventures.

[17:32] But here's the thing. Here's the thing guys. So where did the where did the I'm trying to find the right word. Where did the lack of vision occur? Right. So Jerry makes the engine. And then when he goes to make a car that is going to use that engine, the wheels fall off. Right. Nobody's buying it. So that is to me the real sad part about all the time and effort Jerry has put into the hobby.

[18:01] And he built this engine that can make a Pimball machine. And then the Pimball machine that he decides to make around that engine is not attracting buyers and Jerry's an engineer. Right. He and he gets the engineering side of Pimball and P3 multi-morphic. I mean, it is an engineering feat. Nobody doubts that. Nobody denies that.

[18:25] But sometimes all the engineering ability in the world doesn't matter if you don't have a creative vision that people want because it's the creativity that sits on top of the engineering. That is what emotionally pulls people in.

[18:43] I had an old guy I used to work with. His name is Cliffee B. You don't you might know him. You might not. But Cliffee B works at a company called Epic Games. And I used to work on their brand. And I used to and they made the unreal engine and the unreal engine powered almost all the first person shooters and all these other video games. And they would make a fortune licensing out that engine.

[19:09] But they also made their own games like Gears of War. Right. And they also I just saw like they made this other game called Fortnite recently. And this is the thing. It doesn't matter how good the engine is that powers the toy.

[19:24] The toy itself needs to be amazing and pull people in and that's that's just my my overall take on P3 and multi-morphic is all this engineering went into something that will sell less games than WWE.

[19:39] And you and I just don't know how you justify all that time money and effort when the marketing research they should have done to put them in more of a position to succeed was somehow just not considered.

[19:54] Like how do you get in a room and say well what do people really want? You know I someone told me this and this is the other thing that I think matters the most. And this is where Stern just gets it right.

[20:04] You got to sit in a room and say we're going to make a pinball machine. We're going to make a pinball company. What do people want? What do people want to buy? What do people need in a pinball machine to get them excited? Right. And I think that is what P3 multi-morphic doesn't really like they haven't nailed that.

[20:24] I also think the other company that suffers from that is Jersey Jack Pimball and I've heard this from many people out there is when they sit in a room and you got Jack and you've got Keith and you've got the people at JJP.

[20:35] I don't think they really understand the basic fundamentals of what people want from a pinball game.

[20:42] I want to look at a pinball machine and I want to know what to do without even having to be told what to do.

[20:49] And I think when you look at Jersey Jack machines recently I don't think they accomplished that. I don't think you can stand over pirates of the Caribbean and know what you're supposed to do.

[21:00] You need to have this tutorial on what to shoot at. You know so I think they get that part of it wrong.

[21:07] I also think when you start to get to the rules and like okay well if you're going to explain to someone what you want to do in this game.

[21:14] Can you explain it to them in a few sentences? Let me explain that you here.

[21:19] Look at there's a big grute head on the center of the play field and it looks like you could shoot its mouth.

[21:26] If you shoot the mouth three times the bull, you know, or if you shoot it twice the mouth opens up you shoot it in again and then it starts multi-ball.

[21:34] All you got to do is shoot straight up the middle of the game. I could explain that to anyone and at least they can have something fun happen in their pinball machine that is enjoyable.

[21:43] In just a few minutes those people can be experiencing something that gives them some wow. Talk to me about what I do in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[21:52] What would I tell someone if I was standing next to them is the thing that they're supposed to do that's easy to understand.

[21:59] It just doesn't even need to be explained. They would just walk up there and figure it out and that's the thing.

[22:04] A Stern knows that. Stern knows that if someone walks up to Batman 66 and someone walks up to Iron Maiden and if someone walks up to Guardians of the Galaxy, if someone walks up to like, you know, Star Wars.

[22:15] Like they're going to be able to figure out what to shoot at without any any tutorial.

[22:20] And I think that's to me why when you look at the Valley Williams era of games and you look at the reason why people even still love John Papadu games.

[22:29] It is simply because they're the kinds of games where without anyone telling you what to do, you can figure it out on your own.

[22:37] It's intuitive and it creates a wow moment without even needing without even needing like, oh, I have to pick between 22 characters.

[22:45] I mean, the moment you have someone trying to pick 22 characters and with pirates of the Caribbean, you've already lost like 98% of casual people who will walk up to that game.

[22:53] And that's the thing is like everyone is just trying too hard to make these things too complex, too confusing and layer so many things on top of pinball machines.

[23:05] They don't need it all. They don't. And I think JJP would be more successful if you would make these games more intuitive.

[23:12] Same with all the other people out there. It's just what it's just too confusing on what to do. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think that's what pinball needs.

[23:21] All right. Okay. I'm going to stop rambling see if there's any more emails before I air this interview.

[23:27] Let's see do do do do do do do. Christopher, Fran, she's pinball tips. We're going to start making a franchy moment, a silent moment happen in every podcast.

[23:37] All right. Let's see. I got an email from Joshua Henderson. He said, hi, Chris. I've been listening to your podcast for a while despite knowing that you're banned from Pinside in Claw and keep hearing people discuss you negatively.

[23:50] I still can't help but check back for new episodes being proactive.

[23:55] I agree with George Gomez calling you out, but at least you're offering a unique if blunt perspective on the hobby. It's neat that the pinball podcast out there seem to have varied styles of presentation and personality.

[24:09] You've mentioned that you've owned a Lord of the Rings. I currently own a homie's only Lord of the Rings and Simpsons pinball party.

[24:15] Two of my personal favorite games. Love the artwork theme integration shots gimmicks. Also excited about Batman 66 with Lyman.

[24:23] I'm committed to completing it. I personally like games with deep rules. I've been a tournament player since a young age and enjoyed the strategy, but I'm also a small collector who's lately been putting most of his money towards college.

[24:37] So I can't own that many machines. That's why longevity in the few games I do own is important to me.

[24:44] I'm fortunate that I got into pinball by meeting people face to face and not through an online forum. I personally think Pinside has a wonderful mod community and tech advice.

[24:54] Just don't like the witch hunt towards new users. I was subject to one a day or two after joining. I had to defensively reveal my identity, maybe a sign that I should have deactivated my account sooner.

[25:07] Also not a fan of the moderation. Wouldn't mind talking pinball with you some time Josh. Alright Josh well thank you for the note. I really appreciate it. We'll definitely get you on the show.

[25:18] Look I didn't address my last podcast and where I do sort of outline specifically the bias by the Pinside modulators, but you guys all know that.

[25:29] You know that I'm not some big like evil person. I love how Robyn tries to hide behind. Well because he was banned on other forums like that's proof that he's just not a good apple.

[25:41] You know look I think you know I think you know that online forums are places in which moderators and the people who run these sites they would like to control the conversation.

[25:55] They would like to control it. The same things happening on all the other forums I'm on. I'm on the Dodge Demon forum. You know I got banned from that because I don't love everything about the Dodge Demon and you know what they do.

[26:06] Then they ban you because they only want people cheerleading the product and that's just the funniest thing about forums is you know there's supposed to be this place where you can come and like share your opinions.

[26:19] But for a lot of the forums out there they really only want the opinions that they want to hear and Robin and the moderators they've decided to back certain individuals and allow them.

[26:31] Allow them to just do whatever they want like they'll allow Hilton they'll allow Iceman they'll allow these hyper users to fly off the handle to show games that have cost people thousands of dollars.

[26:43] And this guy who's trying to help you out who's trying to point out the reality of what's going on is hobby and not just that.

[26:52] As I think what I try to do too is get at the root of what it means to be a grown adult who's obsessed with collecting pinball machines and how that's not always a great way to live your life.

[27:04] How you should put more things in your life in front of pinball and hyper focusing and making pinball the center of your world isn't like a good way to live life.

[27:15] Like life should have more balance than just the amount of hours these guys spend on pinside I guarantee you for a lot of the people and the moderators and Robin like think about it for a minute.

[27:28] Pinside is Robin's life like that's his job like he doesn't go into another office like he wakes up every day and is like working on pinside I can't imagine living that kind of life.

[27:41] And so the moderators out there think about those people too like what a thankless kind of crazy job that have to weed through tens of thousands of posts to then moderate them would be a lot easier.

[27:54] See what they should do and it's fine I'm fine being banned what they should do is just ban all the troublemakers and then there's no real moderation that that has to happen he could have a simple policy we are not here to talk smack about manufacturers or individuals if you if you if you one personal insult or threat or derogatory thing about another user and your ban from the site.

[28:18] It's okay to question a pinball companies ethics and operations that is okay but the personal tax and the slander the fighting that will not be tolerated alright and then you get banned cool cool alright let's air this interview with Dave Sanders I think it's great I think you're going to enjoy it everyone have a happy Monday we're getting to that time of year again where there's not going to be any pinball news for a few weeks if not months until we see monster bash remake I don't this summer.

[28:47] Is going to be the summer of iron maiden of monster bash remake and Deadpool at the end of the summer and then hopefully pirates the Caribbean sometime soon but again I am poor all of you to play less pinball when the weather is good we are on a rock hurling through space and life there's so much more than just pinball I literally I just I think some of you as I read the form and I read the negativity and I read like the dumb conversations like how stupid is a conversation

[29:16] questioning whether or not queen is a good ban queen is one of the greatest bands of all time if you can appreciate queen music like I don't even know what's wrong with you Freddie Mercury is probably one of the most talented composers and songwriters that has ever walked the face of the earth in fact I will say that I think Freddie Mercury is more talented than then John Lennon and more talented then Paul McCartney he's just up there like his style and his variety of music.

[29:46] No one's I don't think anyone's even come close and the kinds of musicians that he inspired one of them is my favorite is he goes by the name of W Axel Rose if you go watch the Freddie Mercury tribute concert and listen to Axel Rose and Elton John sing Bohemian Rhapsody you will understand while Freddie Mercury music I mean it's so much better than iron maiden music it's so much better so much more culturally relevant than anything iron maiden ever did all right queen for

[30:15] ever but that doesn't mean anyone's going to buy that pinball machine because the pinball brothers men people don't have memory loss they're not going to go in on that game all right later guys here's Dave Sanders.

[30:25] All right ladies and gentlemen welcome back to canadus pinball podcast Dave Sanders the previous designer over at highway pinball Dave welcome back to the show.

[30:37] You know how's it been Dave so what's start off by saying how do you feel since we've last spoken I know you were hesitant to sort of come forward with your story and since then you have and a lot's happened how do you feel about the community's rallying around you in the last couple weeks.

[30:59] Absolutely blown away it gave me something that I never felt that I had for a long time I mean going back to before highway pinball so I don't I it gave me a sense of support a sense of value if you like

[31:25] because I don't have the best self esteem issues anyway and actually I think I will touch on this I said last time when I came on one of the first things I I briefly touched upon was that when I when I first going contact with Andrew we both got interested in the in a pinball project that I was in a dark place I think for context say let me just tell you a little bit about that

[31:54] where I was coming from sure because yeah because so being on the autistic spectrum being diagnosed with aspergers and the related anxiety problems and everything else like that.

[32:13] Shit went wrong at one point in my adult life and what happened as an upshot of that was I was persuaded when my anxiety problems were really getting bad to go into sheltered accommodation for a year as kind of group therapy sort of thing.

[32:43] What that actually meant for me was it meant being being in a tiny flat in a large building surrounded by people no events of the more anything but they were representative the very very worst of what I was seeing in myself at the time I mean we're talking about people like recovering out of the

[33:13] alcoholics, self-harmers, former drug users all just you know trying to mend themselves but I was getting kind of you know freaked out by how can I possibly put this where I'm not trying to put trying to put them down or anything I just reacted badly to it because I was I was taking

[33:43] some board their problems and they were mixing in with with mine and it was not doing me any good and I felt so you know trapped in there and after a while it started to feel like you know about one step above being sectioned and I wasn't claustrophobic before I before I moved move there but by Christ I was by the time I came out.

[34:13] So yeah, how did you find like how did you find out about the opportunity to work at highway pinball like

[34:23] Andrew approached me via the UK pinball news groups

[34:27] He wanted to do something with pinball, but he knew that then wasn't the right time. This would have been around

[34:34] 2009 2010

[34:36] So highway pinball was being planned for at least two years

[34:43] before we actually made the move to

[34:48] Wales and

[34:51] He was doing the UK pinball party

[34:57] Still at that point as the

[35:01] The Davengers show is in August. So I do remember one time where he was putting up machines and I

[35:13] And he was talking over

[35:17] possible names for such adventure and

[35:24] See at the time this was even before

[35:26] J-pop and Jersey Jack. Jersey Jack might have been just starting

[35:33] Ah, I think the only people who

[35:38] Had really put their hat forward was Quetzal pinball at that time the Spanish guys

[35:43] Who had started doing the the captain Nemo thing and they were in the very early stages

[35:49] So there wasn't the great deal of competition. It was it was it was mainly stir

[35:54] Um, what are the names he was talking about names and he thought of the name Phoenix pinball and I thought well

[36:02] No, a that's pretentious and b it kind of implies

[36:08] That um if we did this we weren't a success and and we went down

[36:14] It I mean it's a phoenix if we went down it would imply that we take everybody else down with it

[36:19] Um, so so I didn't like that name. I just told him well. What's wrong with calling it highway pinball

[36:25] I mean it's it's it's your name

[36:29] You've traded under that name before um

[36:34] Pinball companies

[36:36] Are predominantly named after the founder. I just actually that the um I don't just don't see anything one with highway pinball

[36:44] So highway pinball it was

[36:47] Uh

[36:48] But yeah, we were planning and we were doing sort of like um

[36:53] Potential designs and things for uh for a good couple of years before before we actually took the plan

[37:01] Since we last talked because I I I really want to get what went through your head when you read the interview

[37:08] That pinball news put up with Andrew because you are mentioned in it multiple times

[37:13] specifically on the issue of

[37:16] voluntary work uh that Andrew can continues to uh say that you really wanted to work as a volunteer without any pay

[37:24] So I would love to just get an opinion on that

[37:26] ah

[37:30] uh

[37:32] Okay, that's

[37:34] This is getting onto the whole hm rc saying okay by

[37:42] He and I are obviously using different definitions of what a voluntary actually means

[37:46] I've had a post about this on uh pinside where

[37:50] He's right in the sense that being an asperger's person I always work best under my own hours in my own time

[37:59] and uh

[38:00] My things like my sleep pattern don't work like other people's do

[38:05] So and when I get it uh engrossed in a project also like work on it for hours at a time

[38:10] But it'll always be my own hours. It'll tend to be on it during the night. So I don't fit the nine to five cubicle model

[38:18] so um

[38:20] I would I'd be absolutely useless at stern for example because that's uh they

[38:26] For uh from the accounts I've heard they use the the cubicle system quite a bit

[38:31] So I wouldn't fit into something like that now

[38:36] Working on your own hours working on a project working to a deadline. I call that freelancing

[38:42] Um and I said as much to him uh before I mean uh what

[38:48] What's wrong with you know giving me a freelance

[38:53] kind of

[38:54] Contract under that basis because because that's what um pinball brothers

[39:00] That's what we were actually trying to um sort out once the uh investors took over but uh

[39:07] ah

[39:08] And that never materialized so when you suggested that and it makes sense that

[39:13] You know you'll be paid for your hours work

[39:15] Even if those hours aren't happening you know at a traditional

[39:19] You know nine to five rate um you're still working well it's more like it's more I wanted to

[39:25] It's more like what he was doing with um Barry Ausler where Barry would get a sort of like a monthly

[39:33] Retain for uh fee and it would be done on sort of like a uh

[39:38] Well, it should be done on a project by project basis

[39:43] um

[39:44] But uh yeah, uh, I never wanted to do the uh

[39:48] royalties thing

[39:50] because that meant that some

[39:54] My work in itself would not have any intrinsic value unless

[40:00] the manufacturing and the sales side of the business

[40:05] were uh

[40:06] Equally up to the task i wouldn't get any money unless he sold anything and uh

[40:14] I was i was i was not having that i would that was

[40:19] It was making me assume

[40:22] The risks of the business when it wasn't my business

[40:26] Right now see if i want to ask this something because Andrew says and i just want to i actually want to quote him word for word

[40:33] Um that Dave preferred to have higher royalties instead of becoming a shareholder. Is that is that accurate?

[40:42] um

[40:45] It's accurate in the sense that i wanted royalties per say

[40:54] Slightly less no no slightly more than i wanted shares which was zero

[41:03] shares would have been god damn useless to me because um shares over here

[41:09] Um count as savings and savings are used to calculate things like um

[41:17] Your uh entitlements to a benefit safety net if you need it

[41:23] So one earth would have been the point of me taking shares that i couldn't cash

[41:31] But at the same time

[41:33] would have um blown my

[41:35] safety net um

[41:39] Had uh had i had to leave

[41:42] I think it was his way of trying to tie me down

[41:48] Because i i um i mean i know he wanted i mean we we wanted royalty from each other

[41:54] I know he wanted me on board for x amount of time but

[41:58] he he didn't have to um

[42:03] It wasn't the sort of thing that he really needed to sort of like ask or do

[42:10] Or or or put pressure on to achieve because i mean at that point i mean whether hell else wasn't gonna go

[42:16] uh so

[42:18] Okay

[42:20] Well Dave let me ask your question so like

[42:22] You know we read we read the interview and andrew says a lot and another thing that he says

[42:27] In the interview is that when the investor group took over

[42:32] Uh, they spent three months evaluating the viability of highway pinball and so

[42:38] They do you feel that the investors knew everything they needed to know before andrew exited or do you feel

[42:46] They were sold a bag of goods that

[42:49] Was an accurate which led to the their problems trying to course correct the company once andrew exited

[42:56] Well

[42:58] It's looking back on it with hindsight. I mean it's not really a question is it

[43:04] Uh at the time

[43:07] At the time

[43:09] Uh, I think we were we were um I think we were just kind of comp uh

[43:16] More confident just to actually have that

[43:19] The that that change over to a bunch of people who actually had money

[43:25] At the start um

[43:28] Uh, I think a lot of us felt that you know if we just had the capital investment

[43:33] I mean Andrew had always said about capital investment getting over that final hurdle to get us to um

[43:40] Full production and i guess we were we were we were thinking like well if we just had that capital investment

[43:46] We would ultimately be um all right

[43:51] Of course, none of us in the upstairs department had um access to the figures

[43:58] So things like our overheads for example um, I mean we knew our overheads were high

[44:05] We knew that there were certain things that we had that we weren't using but we had no idea of the uh of the the the scale

[44:13] Just the she just the sheer scale of of how much money

[44:17] What that the um the company really was leeching um at that time

[44:26] ah

[44:28] Were you were you able to look at i know recently

[44:31] The as the liquidation process is going on the actualities are starting to come out in terms of

[44:38] What those numbers where i'm looking at right now the uh 2016 balance

[44:44] It looks like the gross profit for that year was 19,500 and six pounds and the operating cost was 276,000

[44:56] 145 pounds

[44:58] I mean there

[44:59] You know the the cost of operation

[45:02] Was significantly um exceeding any money coming in and that's that's the

[45:07] Production stuff right yes

[45:10] Was there any point Dave to because you know you were around when

[45:14] You know angel was uploading these production videos and factory tours that always seemed a little strange

[45:20] Did he ever ask you or did you ever get the sense that he was trying to stage

[45:24] Those videos to convince people things were okay when really they weren't

[45:30] Well, we knew what the videos were for we knew he was um

[45:36] He was trying to

[45:39] It wasn't so much about just confidence it was

[45:43] He was just trying to um

[45:46] It was him being the salesman um and him uh being the

[45:52] The the the showmanship and it was after a while. I mean we were just all like you know let him get on with it because I mean

[46:00] There wasn't much that um that we could say about it anyway

[46:06] I mean the the instance where uh Andrew was showing off trans show off the fiber optic lighting on alien

[46:15] and was it the white light or was it the black lighting that um

[46:21] Uh, he had threaded up on the machine because we were at we were actually trying to um see what we could do with black fiber optics

[46:30] We if we'd have got that to work

[46:33] I think that would have looked good on the machine because it was nice and subtly it wouldn't have drawn attention to itself

[46:39] um

[46:41] When the machine was off he wouldn't have seen the these

[46:45] Big white wires everywhere that wouldn't have fitted in with the atmosphere of the theme

[46:51] But you know showing off and showingmanship. I mean that's what Andrew was all about

[46:56] So yeah, he was staging this um

[47:03] Staging these videos like that where he walked through the factory and talk and

[47:10] I know Russell in particular

[47:13] His thoughts were why the hell is he showing everybody the empty factory

[47:19] Um

[47:20] But yeah, I mean I'm I'm mentioning I'm mentioning this particular one because that was also the one where he had

[47:25] One of the hungarians lying down on one of the benches just as a as a visual gag

[47:32] Uh, I think it was it was chub with um

[47:36] The face her the plastic face hugger on his face and Andy was just walking past that and and talking

[47:45] Uh as like the preamble to um is later's talk about alien and the fiber optics lighting and everything and we were just so like

[47:54] Everybody was downstairs watching this and so on the most shaking their heads

[47:59] uh

[48:01] And then when it finished everybody went upstairs back to their own departments

[48:07] um

[48:08] Not quite believing some of what they'd actually seen and

[48:15] Chubb was still lying there without face hugger on his face and I went over to him and

[48:21] And I just told him chin up mate. You're not the only person

[48:26] Down here sitting around doing nothing and feeling like a shit

[48:31] Yeah, that was the alien day video uh in 2016 when he revealed the the Brian Allen artwork and the and the fiber optic

[48:40] Cables that were in the game and you know the fiber optic cables. Yeah, I remember the the Brian Allen artwork

[48:48] I still don't understand the the the full story about that

[48:54] Right well what we've heard from oric is that you know andry's sort of went around his back and and hired Brian Allen

[49:01] Andrew actually said in the interview that he wasn't satisfied with orcs artwork and that's why he did that

[49:06] I know that Brian Allen. I actually had him on the show and we talked and

[49:11] Yes, he was he was

[49:13] He wasn't paid for his work and he got really nervous and he was

[49:19] upset and I think I think finally he got made whole

[49:22] So Dave what's also interesting about this latest sort of development and there's a lot of finger pointing between Andrew and the investor group

[49:30] I'd love to hear what the mood was like when the investor group took over like did they call everyone into the room and and how did you guys sort of

[49:40] uh, how did you set a plan of action to try and get the games going? I mean they they were there for almost a year after Andrew exited

[49:51] Oh, how much of this how much of this story remember I think that uh to begin with it was just um

[49:59] It was just a feeling of from relief

[50:04] That finally perhaps we were going to get somewhere the

[50:10] The organization that we got was mostly in um

[50:18] moving forward with um game three and how we were going to start you know approaching that what work had been done with that um and

[50:31] um

[50:32] What needed to be

[50:36] done with the design uh

[50:39] And also the the the the the influence that uh Andrew had on certain elements of the the design field we needed to uh we

[50:53] um

[50:56] So the game needed work david and the game needed work because barit- of the feedback that barry was getting had not been good for uh queen

[51:08] um i mean everybody knows it's queen everybody knows it it would have been queen um

[51:17] Who is Barry getting that feedback from from people who had seen it or or just from

[51:23] Were they pulling we would we would have skype meetings uh once a week it would be

[51:28] myself and Andrew and barry and

[51:32] Russell and James would uh be there as well um

[51:39] But uh one point barry had three designs on the go at one time and that's too much for any one person to be able to

[51:51] give uh their full attention to each i mean

[51:56] Russell's complaint on this weekend pinball was that he he felt that barry didn't do very much well that wasn't the case

[52:05] um barry was actually having to expend far more effort

[52:11] On the amount of work that he was given than uh otherwise

[52:16] should have been

[52:17] because uh

[52:19] sometimes for certain things the uh brief would change from week to week

[52:28] when Andrew would come up with ideas well i'll i'll i'll rather like the idea of this can you squeeze this into the game

[52:35] so barry would have to take the design um

[52:40] Move stuff around shove stuff over so we could fit another new idea in

[52:45] What barry did not have with queen was a set pool of ideas to begin with

[52:52] That he could then design the play field around he didn't have the ideas as the starting point

[52:59] and when i um

[53:02] New the game needed work because it was way way way more complicated than uh it needed to be

[53:09] I took the ideas and i said well okay

[53:12] Keeping to barry's flow as much as possible

[53:17] What can be stripped out of this without compromising the game

[53:21] And it turned out um quite a lot could um

[53:27] the

[53:29] The game the design that

[53:32] Barry was clearly having the best time with in in as much as uh he was putting

[53:39] Uh

[53:39] More of himself into he was allowed to put more of himself into from the off

[53:44] ironically it was playboy

[53:46] probably because uh so few of the design uh team here

[53:53] What did the touch playboy with a barge ball?

[53:56] So we were prepared to let um barry to like get on with it um

[54:03] Andrew was more focused on queen and the other game anyway um

[54:10] I'm pretty sure it's being leaked by this time what sort of other game it was right

[54:19] You uh you've got a good idea of what it would have been

[54:22] The the the title besides queen and playboy yes

[54:29] Um i think it's been on there what

[54:35] What's the genre um

[54:40] ah

[54:44] Is it a movie?

[54:45] It's not a movie it's it's the unlicensed game that we're talking about

[54:49] Uh

[54:50] Was it the the carnival game?

[54:53] It's the fun fair game yes it was it was 360 yeah see i wanted to know how much you actually uh

[54:59] So i knew so i knew what i could say what uh yeah i was just okay just in case things come to

[55:05] For fruition in the future right and that was that was john trudos game

[55:10] Oh, no john trudos game was the madigraf style carnival

[55:14] but uh barry's game was the um fun fair one that like the successor to uh harrick gain and

[55:23] He uh he and i he and i both had um a lot of ideas for you know

[55:28] The sort of things that modern fun fairs had that could that could be um put into that game

[55:34] What happened with that particular game out of uh at the very early stage was andrew um

[55:42] uh andrew put his demands on the table very very early for that game so even before

[55:49] barry had even started designing uh anything for that particular game

[55:55] Andrew had decided right i want a 14 ball multiple in that game

[56:01] So that i could so that we can break apollo 13's record

[56:06] And that was that was literally the reason he wanted it just for a 14 ball multi ball

[56:12] Just for a 14 ball multi ball no context just i mean apollo 13 has the you know has 13 in the title so

[56:20] It aesthetically justifies itself that way but

[56:24] 14 balls on this game and uh he

[56:29] Want also wanted the game to have some kind of um

[56:33] Skeelift type mechanism that would uh

[56:37] That would deliver the excess balls into play um and lock them somewhere

[56:44] so um so andrew has these ideas but he but he has no

[56:50] background in engineering or electro mechanical

[56:53] Anything right so he's just sort of throwing a a crazy vision out there and just expecting you guys

[56:58] to make it

[57:01] Yeah to a degree yes um

[57:05] It's not like it's not like all his ideas um were bad

[57:11] But some of them were ideas that weren't cost uh wouldn't absolutely would not have been uh cost effective or if

[57:20] they'd um

[57:22] Broken down would have absolutely killed a game on location

[57:25] It would have rendered an entire game in operable

[57:29] Um and fixing the things were uh was a night would have been a nightmare

[57:34] Um can you imagine trying to take 14 balls out of the ball

[57:39] Well, it wouldn't it wouldn't have been a ball trough that's the that that's the point

[57:44] Well, I mean we have a six ball ball trough and this ski mechanism would have been for holding into

[57:50] Living all the other balls so um you launch a new ball into play it would come off this ski lift and uh and onto the um

[58:00] Oh one of the ramps and into play that way um even if it had worked that kind of the livery would have been slow

[58:08] And but Andrew said Andrew was saying well, it's another tease never been done before people are people it's got

[58:15] He loved the phrase the wow factor. I grew to hate that phrase

[58:20] But the the wow factor on this game would have been the ski lift

[58:26] But I knew and barry knew that the novelty of that was would wear off so goddamn quickly

[58:33] Once you'd seen a few balls come into play and it would if you thought the double

[58:39] Ferris wheels on hurricane were bad

[58:43] For being slow

[58:45] Right delivering the ball back to you just imagine how frustrating this ski lift would have got very very quickly

[58:53] They both what was the wow factor on on clean you said there's a lot in that game

[58:59] What was like the one like that's the wow that Andrew was looking for

[59:06] Uh

[59:11] Well

[59:13] Seen you'll now you're getting um

[59:18] Yeah, this is getting into sort of like you know crossover territory with what might happen in the future

[59:25] I don't know for sure

[59:28] what

[59:30] Pimble brothers plans are going to be

[59:36] I do know that

[59:38] If they do decide to continue with it they will be doing they will be doing everything that Andrew did and throwing that out the window

[59:45] As far as presentation and marketing goes

[59:49] So they would be going you know

[59:52] Quiet for some time and then

[59:55] Unveiling the game

[59:57] When it's finished when it's in a presentable state when they when when they say okay

[01:00:02] We've got this product you can see it now it works now now you can buy it

[01:00:07] You know the way it will the way it should be done. So okay, that's it. Not to have you yet. I'd love to have you see say anything about how

[01:00:15] Queen

[01:00:17] What the wow factor on queen will actually be because we still we still might end up doing it and

[01:00:25] I still might end up being the one who is gonna design that game because I don't know who else that actually

[01:00:32] Be at this point in time everything's up in the air. I mean I do still have the

[01:00:38] Contract in play with them. So

[01:00:42] This might come about this might not come about but

[01:00:45] Either way you probably won't hear about it for some time and that's really the way it should be sure

[01:00:52] No totally totally I respect that Dave let me ask your question because I think a lot of people are trying to come to grips with

[01:00:59] With who Andrew is and I think a lot of people interacted with him at shows and they they got as you would say

[01:01:06] The salesman side of Andrew which which was usually very jovial very friendly

[01:01:11] The second he got your money

[01:01:13] He would oftentimes disappear from communicating with people did Andrew ever have another side

[01:01:19] Did he ever have like an aggressive sort of hostile sort of short temper?

[01:01:24] I'm that you employees saw but but he hid from the rest of the world

[01:01:30] I'm afraid so

[01:01:33] There's no point denying it because everybody any

[01:01:39] Everybody who knows Andrew and is familiar and with Andrew

[01:01:45] knows he has

[01:01:48] The

[01:01:50] More

[01:01:52] aggressive and forceful side to him anyway. So if I weren't good if I didn't tell you a dozen other people would he probably half heard from

[01:02:04] Certainly on pimble info

[01:02:08] I'm I think this has been touched upon

[01:02:11] But yeah

[01:02:12] There were times in the very first unit that we

[01:02:16] That we had in

[01:02:18] Unit 9 in the Seph Arthur estate

[01:02:23] fairly small unit and

[01:02:25] Andrew had the upstairs office and the sound of his voice would carry and

[01:02:31] the arguments that he would have over the

[01:02:35] phone with people

[01:02:38] They became legendary

[01:02:41] Um the stuff of nightmares almost sometimes they were just they were just so

[01:02:47] Pervasive you couldn't you

[01:02:51] Anyway, you were in the unit you would you would you would hear it and you would hear it clearly and you would know

[01:02:57] Who he was talking to somebody who was disagreed with the um with the way that uh

[01:03:05] The he was doing things or one of the other one actually did feel slighted

[01:03:13] Or yeah, what did he get it would he be yelling at suppliers at ex employees that I mean who who brought out the most vitriol from Andrew

[01:03:27] Oh

[01:03:29] Privately

[01:03:30] privately it would have been um well

[01:03:36] You

[01:03:38] were definitely one of them ex employees were

[01:03:43] were the other ones

[01:03:45] um

[01:03:48] Public uh

[01:03:49] He wasn't trying to be public about it. It's just that we could hear him over the

[01:03:55] Over the phone. He just wasn't good at hiding it if you see one main right

[01:04:01] Well, and he's he's in the interview. He's actually listed myself and oin

[01:04:07] rubber ducks on pinside as individuals that he is

[01:04:10] openly pursuing

[01:04:12] A legal action against which is a little laughable to someone like me. Yeah

[01:04:17] It's ridiculous. I mean even if he could the libel laws here and the libel laws

[01:04:24] In the states are talk and cheese

[01:04:28] um

[01:04:29] You couldn't pursue this sort of thing anyway. I mean, but he was

[01:04:34] threatening to get on the u.n. Meadows case for years even after u.n. Meadows had uh

[01:04:40] gone to Australia

[01:04:42] um

[01:04:45] Andrew was

[01:04:46] Andrew some

[01:04:48] Think he was well. He's

[01:04:49] Violated the terms of his NDA. I'd still get him for that

[01:04:54] um

[01:04:55] It was pretty clear once the uh

[01:04:58] Investigrew started taking a look uh

[01:05:01] Andrew's NDAs that while they weren't worth the paper they were written on

[01:05:06] Well, what they were was they were NDAs not to share information on the games being worked on

[01:05:12] That's what people signed

[01:05:14] These aren't NDAs that they weren't allowed to share

[01:05:17] Like the fact that you know the business practices might be in question or the you know the time

[01:05:24] That's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's everything was covered

[01:05:27] Yeah, well that's exactly it. This is the difference between

[01:05:31] Fact and opinion and this is what always gets muddled in this sort of thing

[01:05:35] I bit when people talk about libel what is libelous? What isn't if you're trying to state something as fact

[01:05:44] That is a an entirely different matter from stating something as personal opinion

[01:05:50] This is how for example fox news gets to say as much as they do because it's

[01:05:58] Um, it's presented as opinion based that's i mean that's that's what punditry is it's opinions

[01:06:06] News is news punditry is opinions that is the difference right well. It's interesting to you if you if you i mean

[01:06:13] Obviously I've covered highway for for for almost two years and while I have delivered most of my

[01:06:20] opinions about highway timball. I have also delivered

[01:06:24] some factual incredible information about the business state of the company and what's what's funny to me is in the end

[01:06:31] This stuff I had was accurate. I mean, so I think Andrew would be he would have a hard time

[01:06:36] Going before any legal body and saying that me or Owen was fabricated

[01:06:43] The realities of his company when we're looking at the spreadsheet now with a liquidation company and everything we were saying

[01:06:50] Was actually occurring

[01:06:52] I don't know how we can see that now yes, but I mean at the time again facts were being um

[01:06:59] Uh facts were being mistaken for opinions

[01:07:02] Uh, do they believe in that question? Everybody just

[01:07:05] Everybody just thought that a lot of this would be uh opinion because

[01:07:13] quite frankly they

[01:07:17] They probably couldn't have accepted them as facts because some of them would have seemed so outlandish

[01:07:24] Or just the stuff that they did just really really did not want to hear

[01:07:29] Right

[01:07:30] David at any point

[01:07:32] You know there was like around 2016

[01:07:36] Did you really have a hard time remaining silent and and not sharing sort of I know you guys were sort of you guys were so close to the project and you saw

[01:07:46] Certain individuals out there trying to sort of

[01:07:50] Reveal some of the truth and share some information and and I've been openly critical of

[01:07:55] Of pin-side and their moderation staff for really taking a one-sided bias

[01:08:00] moderation

[01:08:02] Approach to this whole thing where people who were trying to share

[01:08:05] Where thread ejected were were banned where where we're basically you know their posts were removed and

[01:08:13] How did looking back on it now, Dave? Do you wish they would have allowed more of the truth to be shared publicly?

[01:08:19] So less people would have lost money in the end

[01:08:22] Well

[01:08:26] That's kind of a difficult question to answer because as you say I was so close to the whole thing

[01:08:33] And so far down the rabbit hole and I was so

[01:08:39] Desperate if you like for this thing to you know

[01:08:43] ultimately work

[01:08:46] Oh

[01:08:47] Because I had I had so much to lose

[01:08:52] um if it didn't

[01:08:54] so

[01:08:56] It's kind of a difficult question to answer because I suppose I mean I was terrified at the time I was genuinely um

[01:09:06] scared I what I

[01:09:09] What I absolutely did not want was to be the person to be the catalyst around which

[01:09:16] The whole deck of cards ultimately fell down right

[01:09:20] That was I could not have done that I would not have had the uh the strength of the courage has

[01:09:28] Davis Andrew contacted you after the

[01:09:33] The the announcement came that highway pinball was closing down and and if he has like what what is his mood?

[01:09:38] Binlion with you

[01:09:41] um

[01:09:43] Well he hasn't some he hasn't contacted me since the um pinball news article

[01:09:51] uh

[01:09:52] What about when it was announced that the company that the company was closing

[01:09:56] Did he get in touch at all?

[01:09:59] Uh, he did uh a few times because I mean he was he was concerned because he did have money so like still

[01:10:07] tied up in there

[01:10:09] Yeah, and it did leave me in a bit of a quandary because I mean

[01:10:13] this kind of process

[01:10:17] It needed to play out and it needed to um become public at its own pace

[01:10:23] I mean this was only a

[01:10:26] It was only a couple of days before the the whole liquidation thing was uh leaked anyway, but I I knew that's just telling him

[01:10:34] them

[01:10:35] Would have been a bad idea

[01:10:37] So when we get when we mentioned we talk things over I was I didn't know

[01:10:42] Oh, it's not like I wasn't telling the truth but I was being evasive and um

[01:10:50] uh

[01:10:52] Well the cats out of the bag now right? I mean I think

[01:10:55] Yeah people people know and there's more there's more stories being told every week about what was really going on

[01:11:01] I mean this happens all the time when companies collapse

[01:11:04] Dave what

[01:11:05] What was your question?

[01:11:06] So what what do you think when you saw the number the final number being over two and a half million dollars

[01:11:14] Is how bad highway was in the red that that number shock you or are you kind of like well?

[01:11:20] It kind of makes sense considering how big the factories were all this expensive equipment

[01:11:24] We didn't get games out

[01:11:26] What what did that what did you think when you when you saw that number?

[01:11:29] Well at first it shocked me

[01:11:33] Then when I thought about it it made sense

[01:11:36] And then I remembered something from the very very early days

[01:11:39] Uh

[01:11:40] Back in the uh romney house in the in the first few months when we were reaching out for um

[01:11:48] Technical advice and people in the industry industry or whatever now

[01:11:53] I don't know who actually said this

[01:11:55] It um it might have been Roger Sharp when uh

[01:12:02] The issue was of of licensing came up might have been um

[01:12:07] Mark Richie because Andrew was and I

[01:12:11] Assume still is good friends with the Richies might even have been Jay pop because this was uh before the whole um

[01:12:21] Magic girl

[01:12:23] Started going wrong

[01:12:25] But uh, I do remember there was somebody when Andrew was saying it his plans what he was wanting to do um

[01:12:33] Andrew laughed this off, but one other guy said well, uh, you got a uh spare couple of million dollars to spare

[01:12:40] Well, guess what?

[01:12:43] Turns out that was the magic number

[01:12:45] Uh, yeah, I mean we've we've heard it and Andrew says is he actually openly admits this now that he was just under capitalized from the very beginning

[01:12:52] And it was just never gonna work out

[01:12:55] Um, Dave. How do you feel about it? Yeah, the over ambition as much as under capitalization, but yeah

[01:13:03] Yeah, look but we see it all the time right the pinball is not an easy product to make

[01:13:07] I think people sometimes oversimplify what it takes to make a pinball machine

[01:13:11] Just just one machine alone let alone it an entire company that's trying to compete at a large volume of pinball machines

[01:13:19] Which actually that's a question I have Dave because there's just been a lot of speculation

[01:13:22] How many alien games were made when you know, but but right you know at the end how many total were produced?

[01:13:32] Uh, I don't know the exact number um

[01:13:36] Somebody's been saying around 200 that sounds about right to me. I think

[01:13:43] Around about 200 um in total

[01:13:47] And there are and there are like and I saw someone davis trying to like

[01:13:51] Sort of fix some of the engineering issues the games have had and then it seems like there's

[01:13:56] There's various

[01:13:58] Types of alien machines out in the wild there's the early builds. There's the pinball brother boards

[01:14:03] There's there's almost like three to four different variations

[01:14:06] Of the game based upon the time period in which they were constructed

[01:14:12] Well, there's very little difference between the uh pinball brothers boards and the uh highway pinball boards

[01:14:19] Because they would they were they were being they were done over the same manufacturer

[01:14:24] And we were trying to get them sourced more

[01:14:29] locally um

[01:14:32] But that would have taken time and it turned out that time was the thing that we didn't have as well as money because of the share overheads that

[01:14:41] That that's uh that the company had been left with

[01:14:45] Uh, no, I mean you bring up a good point in terms of complexity because I think this is one thing that helped to do

[01:14:53] us as well

[01:14:55] Um, you've heard about the bicarity baffle ball

[01:14:59] Uh project which was one of the the early things that the the the company did right because the bicarity approached us

[01:15:07] For um the uh promotional thing they wanted a simple game but they could take around a place is but in the pub

[01:15:14] Didn't cost a lot

[01:15:16] And they wanted about 300 units and they they wanted it done by

[01:15:21] this particular um deadline, so

[01:15:25] Andrew pulled out all the stops to make that work and he did make that work

[01:15:31] um

[01:15:32] All credit to him he did make that work. We did make and uh provide nearly 300 units of this simple

[01:15:43] um quasi-mechanical um

[01:15:47] It was it was just a as as simple as like

[01:15:50] figure eight playfields by the glass playfield with a couple of with a spring plunger at each end and the balls would go around

[01:15:57] You try to get them into the other other person's holes. It's simple sort of pub game

[01:16:03] We were in the first

[01:16:05] unit

[01:16:08] a produced and um i do remember all hands on deck in that first unit everybody

[01:16:17] We all all the shipments of parts were in and we were all building which uh building the uh the games up

[01:16:24] putting the cabinets together putting the marquis um the like boxes on

[01:16:29] And the batteries in and the legs on and all the the decals everything else like that everybody working on that at the same time

[01:16:38] and it was

[01:16:42] It was very tight on space at the time. I remember but that's because we were trying to make three essentially

[01:16:50] 300 games in at once in one quick run and these were

[01:16:58] simple get

[01:17:01] Yes

[01:17:01] What I think must have happened was the wrong lessons were taken away from that

[01:17:08] because

[01:17:09] I expect

[01:17:11] One thing that must have gone through Andrew's mind looking at the the type squeeze and how how we were you know just um

[01:17:21] Scramble uh scrambling around just trying to get things things out quickly

[01:17:25] He must have thought well if this is what it's like with 300 baffle balls

[01:17:30] What's it going to be like when we're trying to make 300 full throttles

[01:17:35] and not considering the fact that um

[01:17:39] You wouldn't be making 300 full throttles at one time for a start

[01:17:43] But he he must have thought well if we're trying to make full if this battle baffle ball game requires

[01:17:49] requires this much space

[01:17:52] When we go into full throttle and alien we're going to need

[01:17:57] This much space so we better prepare for that now

[01:18:02] Right

[01:18:03] I think that's what happened. I think that's why we ended up

[01:18:08] going into these

[01:18:10] big units

[01:18:12] So much sooner than we needed to

[01:18:16] It was also that and the fact that as soon as alien as soon as that that the the

[01:18:21] License for alien as soon as we got that as soon as that entered the equation

[01:18:26] See my thought on the first game whatever it was was

[01:18:31] The I expected the figure that we would sell of our first game would be about

[01:18:36] 500 units

[01:18:38] I've known doubt that if we had done things properly and concentrated on

[01:18:44] Full-fraught throttle exclusively and at a reasonable pace

[01:18:48] and

[01:18:49] Spent the appropriate amount of money on it without overspending elsewhere. I've known doubt but at that time

[01:18:57] um

[01:18:58] in 2015

[01:19:00] We would have sold five hundred full throttles

[01:19:04] Because we would have had the European market as well as the US one

[01:19:09] I mean the the the thing bombed in the states

[01:19:13] But it was big in Europe and we would have had things like the max TT and the north west

[01:19:19] 200 in in Northern Ireland events like that to be able to capitalize on as well

[01:19:25] I reckon 500 units would have been a

[01:19:29] reasonable figure and my thinking and my thinking was always well

[01:19:34] It's not it's not your first game

[01:19:38] That's going to determine how

[01:19:40] How well you do it's going to be a second game

[01:19:44] Whether you could how much you're able to build on what you've already done

[01:19:49] Obviously if obviously your first game needs to break even but it's your second one's going to be the teller

[01:19:55] Right and he and you guys must have been somewhat devastated when he announced alien just as full throttle was hitting the market

[01:20:03] Yeah, yeah

[01:20:04] Totally but as soon as as soon as alien

[01:20:08] Entered the equation the attitude became go big or go home

[01:20:12] Right do you think Andrew did Andrew ever

[01:20:15] Because for the life of me what I still can't understand is alien is one of the biggest properties and themes of all time

[01:20:22] and

[01:20:23] Even when they showed the game

[01:20:25] Andrew couldn't sell 500 LEDs for such a juggernaut property did he did you ever hear him like

[01:20:32] Did he get frustrated that he felt like the artwork and the the visuals of the game that he showed people like never really one people over

[01:20:42] Like why didn't it sell do you ever get jaz-ever? I mean it if stern announced alien tomorrow

[01:20:47] I mean is it just because stern so established or do you think anything had to do with like

[01:20:52] Andrews you know Andrews adjustment of what a pinball cabinet looks like and the swappable play feels and all these things that people had to buy into

[01:21:01] Did that hurt the company's ability to sell such a popular theme?

[01:21:07] Hmm, I've never really thought about that um obviously the fact that we weren't stern

[01:21:14] was a factor

[01:21:16] Obviously also the the fact that we were an unproven British

[01:21:22] manufacturer

[01:21:23] It was also the fact that

[01:21:25] quite clearly the game was still in development when

[01:21:30] We were showing it off and trying to sell so there would have been the weariness from that side

[01:21:36] I mean if we showed up with

[01:21:39] um

[01:21:40] A more finished game even if

[01:21:46] He did changing the coffee cam to the uh airlock screen for example

[01:21:52] um

[01:21:54] If we'd have had a more finished and a more polished product to

[01:22:00] To show off

[01:22:04] Um one which demonstrated

[01:22:07] That we really did know our onions as far as um

[01:22:13] Quality and such was concerned. I don't think we'd have had any trouble

[01:22:17] um

[01:22:18] Okay, it's it's the lesson that it's a it's the same lesson that jjp had to learn right so div um

[01:22:26] I want to talk a little bit about Christopher franches podcast tips in a second

[01:22:30] But just to close the book on this how do you feel about the go fun me

[01:22:35] Page that people have set up and I think it now is raised or I think over four thousand pounds for you

[01:22:40] Which I which I know people feel great about donating to

[01:22:44] Hmm. Well actually this is a question that I do want to address

[01:22:48] Uh

[01:22:49] Because I'm actually rather surprised that this uh hasn't actually

[01:22:54] come up more often um

[01:22:57] And that is

[01:22:59] If the investors have been taken over for ten months and I was there with the with the scatted avians for ten months

[01:23:08] Why do I still need to go fun me page now

[01:23:12] Well the answer to that is the um this also ties into what are one other piece of speculation that being well

[01:23:21] What did the investors

[01:23:22] Intentions all along to take over the company liquidated and start again

[01:23:30] The flyer that ointment would have been me

[01:23:33] Or rather the situation that I'd been put in

[01:23:38] Which the hmrc

[01:23:40] Her Majesty's revenue and customs would have been uh

[01:23:44] Investigating by that point

[01:23:47] even if they'd wanted to

[01:23:50] liquidate

[01:23:51] There would have been ramifications and repercussions from the tax man

[01:23:58] Uh if they tried to do that

[01:24:01] Because the the the hmrc knew all uh um

[01:24:04] You all about me by this point and haven't believed for one instance

[01:24:10] Um and choose claims about you know voluntary work, but that's that's by the buy

[01:24:16] Here's what the difficulty was though um

[01:24:21] They the scatted avians really were trying to make good with everything

[01:24:28] I mean, I see I've seen posts on pin-side with people who didn't get their machines and their their attitude is

[01:24:35] I bought from this company. I didn't buy

[01:24:38] I didn't get my product from this company

[01:24:41] Therefore all people associated with this company are crooks

[01:24:46] Which is

[01:24:48] Way too simplistic on balance on aggregate. I have to say that

[01:24:54] Things did turn out less worse for people

[01:25:00] With the investors than had they not more people at least

[01:25:06] Got the machines and the refunds that they were entitled to then if the investors hadn't stepped in

[01:25:16] As for my own personal situation um where was I uh

[01:25:23] Yeah

[01:25:24] The problem with that problem with settling things with the hmrc was that

[01:25:30] Not only

[01:25:32] Did um any

[01:25:34] Settlements related to the kind of figures that that the hmrc was saying that I was due

[01:25:42] Not only did it have to come from the company accounts

[01:25:47] It had to be seen to come from the company accounts

[01:25:51] They couldn't have just

[01:25:54] Paid me off and said right. That's the end of it

[01:25:57] Doesn't work that way. It's got to go through the proper channels

[01:26:01] And uh the hmrc really wanted things

[01:26:05] Um taking care of as quickly as possible

[01:26:09] Neither of the investors or I

[01:26:12] Wanted to go down that path because a it meant that if I got a

[01:26:19] One single lump summit would have had the shit taxed out of it

[01:26:22] And I also knew this other point for uh from the investors point of view

[01:26:26] The company just didn't have the money to cover it

[01:26:29] It could it

[01:26:31] That's single one single thing um

[01:26:35] Pay paying me my dues and paying the um associated penalties that they

[01:26:42] Inherited at the same time which is right there in the in the liquidators report you can see to um

[01:26:51] Penalties hmrc penalties one for 24k one for 25k one of those is definitely

[01:26:56] To do with me

[01:26:59] If

[01:27:00] If if the hmrc had forced them to to to pair all at once the company would have would

[01:27:07] Almost certainly have tanked there and there

[01:27:11] So it was a very very sticky and

[01:27:16] Delegate situation that we were

[01:27:19] Trying to handle over a longer term basis as it turned out the longer term basis turn out of me

[01:27:25] Just as futile, but it's not like they weren't trying

[01:27:30] and they

[01:27:32] Ha so they weren't trying to just liquidate the company

[01:27:35] I mean I think a lot of these people who are upset they really just have faith in the pro in the product or rather

[01:27:41] They have faith in what the product should be right okay

[01:27:46] So do one more question about alien then I want to I want to end on on mr. franches podcast tips that is really lighting the internet on fire

[01:27:54] Um for people who own an alien machine do you do you think they'll be able to get

[01:28:01] Access to the company that made the boards and made some of the parts so these guys can at least keep their machines running

[01:28:08] Um for the long term

[01:28:12] um

[01:28:14] well

[01:28:16] Not being an engineer not not being that kind of of of technical and electrical engineer myself like we'd be hard to say

[01:28:23] But Ben hex opinion of the machine was that it was over engineered anyway

[01:28:28] So I would say the best way forward if this was possible would be to

[01:28:34] bypass some of that um over-engineering um

[01:28:40] reconfigure the ios system so that you don't need those

[01:28:46] Massive great boards the

[01:28:48] Prototypes that we uh that we had didn't have those kind of circuit boards anyway. They only had the um the

[01:28:57] Regular ios boards and I know those

[01:29:01] You should be able to uh replicate somebody who knows what they're doing should be able to replicate those boards without too much trouble

[01:29:09] so i reckon i i i don't think it's going to be a long-term

[01:29:16] issue if the community

[01:29:18] um

[01:29:19] Really puts their minds to it with which they are doing

[01:29:23] Okay, and do you for all your work Dave do you have a full throttle on an alien at least in your possession

[01:29:31] No

[01:29:32] So it's criminal all right. Well let's do one thing first let's you and I take 10 seconds

[01:29:38] And i'm going to do this with all my interviews from now on let's take 10 seconds

[01:29:43] And do a what i'm going to call a Christopher fransche moment of silence an awkward moment of silence

[01:29:48] Can we do that for 10 seconds?

[01:29:50] We've been doing this

[01:29:52] You i've been doing this for the past hour

[01:29:54] Sorry, hold on like what do we let's start right now

[01:29:59] Oh um wait do you have some game show music to play doing these 10 seconds

[01:30:04] You just interrupted the 10 seconds of Christopher fransche silence. Let's start

[01:30:08] Do you i can't even do that right?

[01:30:10] See too

[01:30:11] They ready ready ready on my mark

[01:30:13] three two one

[01:30:18] All right

[01:30:26] All right some more Christopher fransche is just punching his computer room. So Dave I know you saw Christopher fransche

[01:30:33] I'll take cheap gimmicks for 800

[01:30:35] Please I know you saw Christopher fransche's

[01:30:39] Tips on how to make a great pinball podcast did you um

[01:30:43] Did you agree with his advice?

[01:30:46] Um

[01:30:49] Well it was interesting uh well he's

[01:30:53] He's he's coming from radio

[01:30:56] He's he's obviously

[01:30:58] I got the impression he was thinking about this in this in the same way that uh he was

[01:31:03] Thinking about radio

[01:31:05] A lot of the things that he said

[01:31:08] had to do with

[01:31:10] The kind of charisma and the kind of skills that radio

[01:31:15] personalities

[01:31:17] would have um

[01:31:20] That's the impression that I was getting anyway

[01:31:23] uh

[01:31:24] Because I mean if you if you if you

[01:31:27] If you can't get past the way a person talks if they come across as

[01:31:32] it as droning or

[01:31:36] They don't have that kind of energy in their voice. Yeah, you're gonna turn off up to 10 minutes anyway

[01:31:41] Right what do you think the chances are of Christopher fransche's

[01:31:47] New pinball podcast. What do you think the chances of him winning a twippy this year?

[01:31:51] I mean it is it too early to call it

[01:31:54] I think he's got it in the bag with with those tips

[01:31:57] I've never heard the guy speak. I honestly would I I wouldn't have the first idea

[01:32:03] But then again, but then again this time this time last year we just said the same about zack and Greg

[01:32:10] Right and they've they've they did a great job with that show

[01:32:14] Well, Dave. I really appreciate you coming on anything else you want to say before we

[01:32:18] We go on and enjoy the rest of our weekend any any final thoughts you have coming out of this whole

[01:32:25] This whole historical moment in pinball history

[01:32:28] Yeah, when we when we have a few minutes just to talk about gull this is buying kept for a few at first sec

[01:32:34] All right, I will give you a couple minutes because Dave wants to talk street fighter

[01:32:37] So Dave you are a big street fighter fan right

[01:32:40] Well, I wouldn't say I was a world glass tournament player, but what you

[01:32:45] What you said to me in emails about being um a guile player guile all day long got got me thinking now

[01:32:54] I'm guessing then you play gull and nobody else. I assume you know guile's um animation frames inside out right

[01:33:02] Um, can you for example pull off the instant flash kick

[01:33:07] Where you jump or you're knocked down and you know the timing of the animation frames

[01:33:11] So the instant you get up you launch into the flash kick

[01:33:15] Can you know no, I mean here's a thing here. Well, here's then we here's the thing here's the game my street fighter

[01:33:19] And we won't go to my pinball audiences. Oh, they're already hitting cancel on this

[01:33:24] Uh-huh, it depends what street fighter you're talking about because I prefer like street fighter two street fighter two turbo

[01:33:30] I like those matters. I've yes, I can pull off a combo with guile and

[01:33:37] Street fighter two where you in street fighter two champion edition where you're stunned and I can do a combo that stuns you again

[01:33:43] which I learned

[01:33:46] Eons ago from some kid in Japan who was my friend in boarding school

[01:33:51] So like that's my that's my secret weapon, but um we'll play at a show

[01:33:55] We also got to get orcs. He's a big street fighter fan too. We should have a little bit of a street fighter competition

[01:34:00] But Dave, I appreciate you coming on the show

[01:34:03] I think the support from the community has been overwhelming and I'm glad to see people

[01:34:08] Are supporting you and you know that you always have an outlet with this show to come on and talk and and just sort of clear

[01:34:14] There and tell your side of things so and we also hope that there's more pinball in your future because I think people want to see you continue to

[01:34:23] Make some stuff in the pinball industry and hopefully the pinball others can figure stuff out

[01:34:28] I hope so too, but I do have other things to

[01:34:32] Occupy me for the present. I've got a graphic novel to edit in fact as an artist and I work with that

[01:34:39] The American artist I work with

[01:34:41] Who's a comics person and at the moment

[01:34:47] This guy created a universe and I'm currently

[01:34:51] Writing for it. Right. So we're putting material together and hoping to actually get a

[01:34:57] Graphic novel out sometime over the course of this year. Yeah, so that's one thing to occupy me should

[01:35:03] One last question should we end this podcast on the Marty laugh track from head-to-head pinball

[01:35:12] But start a rhetorical question then that must be a yes. All right ladies and gentlemen. We'll see you next time

[01:35:27] Sh separate

[01:35:38] Though the truth may앙 this ship will carry on

[01:35:44] What be safe to show
