[00:00] To dance the dance, to dance the dance, you need a little bit of grace, a little bit of grace for my peace, and above and above.

[00:30] Many people hit me up in the last 72 hours saying, hey Chris, do you know where I can get a Metallica remastered LE for MSRP?

[00:41] And I said, yeah, you can get it in Wonderland because it doesn't exist.

[00:47] It's a fictional thing right now to try to get that game at MSRP.

[00:53] And I tried to tell everybody a few weeks ago, I tried to tell everybody a year ago, that when they remake this game, it's gonna be crazy.

[01:03] Imagine if this game was on Spike 3. Look at all the frenzy to get it, and it's still on Spike 2.

[01:10] And I think it begs the question and the topic of this show today is, is there a new like agony and ecstasy of owning a limited edition game?

[01:22] I'm very curious about how this community views limited edition games.

[01:28] I think there's a combination of excitement and hate. I think there's a combination of eagerness and despair.

[01:37] I think there's a good portion of you out there that absolutely despise the notion of a limited edition game.

[01:47] You think there should be one model of pinball like there was in the 90s and everybody gets the same game.

[01:55] A game can still be limited and not have different tiers.

[01:59] Games like Labyrinth, games like Rick and Morty, where they just make a certain amount and that's it.

[02:07] Everybody has the same game. Nobody feels like they've got an inferior version of the game.

[02:13] Now that works for a boutique company that can only make a finite amount of games by nature.

[02:19] A boutique company is always making limited edition games.

[02:24] But Stern Pinball famously introduced the three tier model.

[02:28] It's been very successful for them and the LEs, especially over the years, have always done tremendously well in holding their value,

[02:39] in selling out pretty instantly and in being the creme de la creme version of a Stern machine.

[02:47] And some other companies followed suit. Jersey Jack has tried it with its collector's editions.

[02:53] You know, I think Jersey Jack right now with just a two tier model, it doesn't work. It really doesn't.

[03:00] I think Jersey Jack needs to wake up. You either have three tiers or if you're going to do two tiers,

[03:07] you need to have just a pro and a limited edition game.

[03:12] I'll talk a little bit about why JJP's model is terrible right now because 12 and 15 just doesn't work

[03:20] and 5,000 versions of a $12,000 machine is absolutely a name and stupid.

[03:27] But we'll talk about that in a little bit.

[03:29] But what I'm noticing right now, and I have a question for each and every one of you,

[03:34] what do you want out of these LEs? Like what do you want? Do you want a thousand of them?

[03:38] So that the moment you unbox them, they lose $3,000 in value.

[03:44] We've seen every single Stern LE that was $13,000 at 1,000 units.

[03:50] 95% of them have tanked in value after just one year. Is that what you want?

[03:57] I think the haters love watching that. I do.

[04:00] I think there's like a little bit of a caste system warfare in pinball where you love watching these rich guys

[04:07] or these newbies who are speculators. You love watching them run in and buy everything instantly

[04:14] and then wake up to the sobering fact that your John Wick LE, your Venom LE, your Foo Fighter LE,

[04:22] your James Bond LE is no longer worth anywhere near $13,000.

[04:28] You're taking a $3,000 to $4,000 hit on the game. Heck with Venom, you're taking like a $5,000 hit.

[04:35] And now Stern Pinball has made a move. They said, hey, we've heard you. We've heard you.

[04:41] 1,000 LEs is not very limited. It's way too many. It might only work on AAA super in-demand games.

[04:50] So we're going to pull it back. They pulled it back with X-Men, 811, and that game is still not sold out.

[04:58] Okay, so that didn't work. That really didn't work as great as X-Men is. 811 still feels like too many.

[05:07] Now, I would argue the reason why X-Men has not sold out is not just because of the code.

[05:12] It's not because of the auto plunger. It's also because everything looks the same.

[05:17] Like all three models look amazing. None of them look bad.

[05:21] And if Stern Pinball really wants to differentiate in X-Men LE, what they've done just isn't enough.

[05:27] It also needed like an exclusive topper. And I think Stern's learning.

[05:31] Like they're going to change this whole thing up because they need to get back to a place where buying a Stern LE is a moment.

[05:39] And it's a special game. And when you get one, here's the kicker game.

[05:43] When you get a Stern LE, you want to make it so damn nice that people don't want to get rid of it, that they don't want to let it go.

[05:51] And I know what some of you are saying. You're like, well, Kaneda, if you love the theme and you buy an LE, you're never going to want to sell it so you don't care if you lose money.

[06:01] And that's fine. Absolutely, right? Like if you're a John Wick aficionado and you just had to have the LE and you never plan on selling it, then you're never going to lose any money.

[06:12] That's not how pinball works. Let's be honest, everybody. Most people, they want to buy a game. They want to enjoy it for a certain amount of time.

[06:20] And even if they love the theme, they might just get bored of the game. And there might just be new games coming out that they'd rather have.

[06:27] So like when King Kong comes out, are you going to want to hold on to your John Wick LE?

[06:33] You might not even want to hold on to your Godzilla LE. You might have had it for like three, four years and you're just ready for the next Keith Elwin game.

[06:41] And for many of you out there, you might only have room for like three to four pins. And if that's the case, you can't hold on to everything. You got to let stuff go.

[06:49] You know, and there was a time, right? There was a time when LEs would hold value nicely and now they don't.

[06:56] Okay, so X-Men 811 wasn't enough. So they've got Metallica remastered LE. What does Stern do?

[07:03] 500 only for the entire world. What happens? They instantly sell out. I was trying to tell people, get on a list. You might as well.

[07:16] And they were available people on the eve of the game launching. If you went around to different distros and looked at who was taking orders, people had orders open.

[07:27] See, I think a lot of people said, Hey, I'm going to wait and see. And I've been telling people for the longest time, wait and see does not apply to everything.

[07:35] Are you going to wait and see if Tron LE comes out remastered or a new Lord of the Rings? No, if you wait, you're never going to get one. You got to move fast.

[07:45] And so 500 Metallica is hit and the LE is really special and they went the extra mile. This isn't just a vault people.

[07:54] This isn't like what they did with Jurassic Park where they just changed the artwork. This isn't like what they did with Elvira where they just changed the artwork.

[08:03] This game is an all new game. They've added so much on top of the amazing masterpiece that Borg and Lyman created.

[08:12] John Borg himself said, I've put more hours into this game than I did into the original game. It's got a thousand new callouts.

[08:21] The band members worked on this game. I mean, this is not your old Metallica. And so, yeah, it divided people. Original owners are pissed off.

[08:30] They want to pretend that the Dirty Donnie art package is nicer. It's not. I've stood over this new game. It's better in every way.

[08:38] It's more Metallica than the old one ever was. And so now everyone's waking up and they want one and they want one.

[08:44] And there's thousands of people that would love to have this game who either are new to pinball and haven't had the original or have the original and want the new one.

[08:53] And so now we get to the title of the show, the agony and the ecstasy of Metallica LE. A lot of you out there are feeling some agony.

[09:02] You wanted one. You didn't get one. You're not going to be able to get one for $13,000 ever. No, don't listen to Iceman.

[09:10] This game is not going to go down in value in six months. You all know that. Deep down, you know it.

[09:16] If you want one now, after everything that's transpired, after everyone realizes how awesome the game is, you're just going to have to pay more money than $13,000.

[09:27] I put up a poll on my Facebook page. How much do you think a Metallica remastered LE is going to sell for on the secondhand market?

[09:36] $13,000, $14,000, $15,000, $16,000. If you're to ask me right now, I think this game is a $16,000 to $18,000 purchase right now because I think a lot of people are never going to let it go.

[09:50] And I think it is a bolt to the floor game for so many people out there. And on a global level, I mean, heck, you can't even get this game in Australia.

[09:59] Only 21 games went to Australia. And I know the list was like 100 people long. And I know in America, all the dealers have like a waitlist that's like three times the amount of games that have been manufactured.

[10:12] So it begs the question, should Stern have made a thousand of these and would that have been the right move? And I'm just going to tell you, no, I like what they did.

[10:22] I like that this is it. We're making 500. We're making Stern Elise a moment again. We're making them truly limited again.

[10:30] Now, I think what Stern could do to make it a little bit more interesting is this. I think these games, if you know the demand is so high, right, and they're leaving some money on the table because they are right when this game sells out this quickly, you know, you could have got more than 13.

[10:47] I think what Stern might start to explore is a few things. I think they might start to explore an exclusive topper that goes on the LE like Jersey Jack does with the CEs.

[10:58] And if you do that, because we all know Stern is going to charge us $2,000 anyway for a topper. Why not put an exclusive topper on a Metallica LE and just charge $15,000.

[11:12] And that way you start to thin out the demand, right? The more money you charge, the less demand there's going to be. That's just the way it works.

[11:20] And it also kind of eliminates scalping even more because if a game's entry level price is 15 grand, it's really hard to go anywhere north of that.

[11:31] And also everybody look for this much money for $13,000, a Stern pinball machine should come with a topper. The LEs should come with a topper.

[11:42] If you ask me, the LEs should also come with exclusive code and other things like that, but they historically have not.

[11:49] And so I think there's a lot of people out there that got left out. I think there's a lot of people out there that would have happily paid more than $13,000 if the game came with a topper.

[12:00] But I'm glad this is happening because this is good. FOMO is good for pinball.

[12:07] For the rest of you out there who don't care about any of this vanity, any of this back and forth around resale price and value, the good news is they're going to make Metallica premium for as long as people want it.

[12:21] They're going to make that premium for years. And so do I think that's going to make the LE values go down?

[12:29] I do not because Metallica LE is just so much nicer than the premium.

[12:34] But the premium is still a nice game. And I hear everybody trying to rationalize it as it's nicer than the LE.

[12:41] There is nobody, and I mean this, there's nobody who has seen both in person that will walk away and say the premium is nicer.

[12:50] And guess what? The premium shouldn't be nicer. The LE should be the nicest package all around.

[12:57] Now I'm curious because I haven't seen a single Metallica LE sell on the second hand market.

[13:05] I might do a little experiment. I might list one at a really high price just to see if anybody bites.

[13:13] So don't come crying to me. Don't ask me to sell you the one I got for MSRP. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

[13:22] Of course I grabbed one. Why would I not have grabbed one? I plan on keeping this game. I really do.

[13:29] I think this game, next to Guns N' Roses, is an awesome one to punch. I really do. But here's the thing. I'm also curious.

[13:39] I'm curious to see what the market does. And we'll see if somebody bites. We'll see if someone bites.

[13:44] The problem is when I list it for sale for a high price, it's going to trigger so much hate, so much animosity.

[13:52] And hey, don't blame me. I'm just the messenger. I just want to see what the market will bear. That is the reason why I'm doing this.

[14:00] I want to see what the market will bear. And I just have a little hunch. I have a little hunch because when you're selling a game like this,

[14:08] you only need one buyer. It doesn't matter if 5,000 people are pissed off at me. All you need is one guy that really wants it with a lot of disposable income.

[14:23] That's it. That's all you need. And if I can hook one big whale, will I sell it? I don't know. Let's do this experiment this week.

[14:32] Also, the other thing that's setting in right now for everybody is this move is amazing. And now everyone's like, oh my gosh, what if Stern does this to Tron?

[14:41] What if Stern does this to Lord of the Rings? This is a new dawn of how Stern could do this. Now, I think this model works. Just do 500.

[14:53] If you own some of these older Stern machines and you've had them for over a decade and you now know that those games are targets for remakes like this,

[15:07] I think if I were you, I pretty much know for a fact that Tron is coming. I don't think Lord of the Rings is coming. I think Tron is coming.

[15:17] If you're sitting on a Tron LE and you want $22,000 for it, I would get that today. If you're thinking of buying a Tron LE for $22,000,

[15:30] now after watching this Metallica launch, I think you need your head examined. It's a whole new world.

[15:37] Now, I know Stern said they're never going to make more LEs of games that had LEs. Apparently, they've moved the goalposts

[15:44] and it's just like we're not going to make more LEs of Spike 2 games that had LEs. I think anything that was an LE in the DMD era is going to be fair game for them to bring on to the new platforms.

[15:58] So yes, you're looking at games like Maybe the Walking Dead, Maybe Ghostbusters, Maybe Kiss. So I don't know. Look, these are Stern's games.

[16:08] And look, Stern's going to have to play this dance with the collector community because if they do this and they burn all those old collectors,

[16:17] is that going to damage them? Or, but here's what I think Stern should do. And I mean this. And I was hoping Dodge would do this when they remade the demon.

[16:26] Imagine this scenario. If you're the original owner of a Stern LE and you bought it when the game was released and they've got to be able to get this data.

[16:38] If you bought your game and you still own a Metallica LE, a Lord of the Rings LE, you know, you still own a Ghostbusters LE.

[16:48] I mean the original owner. You didn't sell it on to somebody else. If you still own the game and we're going to remake it, you get first dibs at the new game.

[17:00] I think that would be the best way to do it. I don't think anyone would argue with that move. I think it's 100% fair.

[17:07] Now look, here's the thing. I'm curious to see what Stern does with the new games. If Dungeons and Dragons is next from Brian Eddy,

[17:16] I don't think they're going to make 800. If you can't sell out of 800 X-Men, D&D is not a more popular franchise than X-Men.

[17:25] I think they're going to take that down to like 500 or 600. And then the big question is going to be this. Keith Elwyn on Spike 3, King Kong, how many do you make?

[17:39] Now look, I think they should make 500. I think it should have all the bells and whistles and I'm okay if they price it even higher.

[17:49] I know you're like, Canada, stop. No, think about it. Keith Elwyn's, King Kong, Exclusive Topper, all this exclusive stuff and the game is like 16-5.

[18:00] I don't know, ladies and gentlemen. I don't know. That's what I would do versus making a thousand at 13,000 a pop. They don't come with a topper.

[18:10] And again, it just doesn't feel that limited. It doesn't feel that special. Like look at Godzilla LE. When you see one, it's not a wow moment.

[18:19] But when you see a Metallica LE, it is. When you see a Batman SLE or LE, it is. When you see a Ghostbusters LE, it is.

[18:29] So we shall see. I'm curious what you guys think. I'm curious if you think I'm crazy, but I really do love the fact that Stern has listened.

[18:39] Even though I don't love the fact that they're remaking LEs of previous LEs because those owners are getting burned.

[18:46] But you have to remember, if you have a Metallica LE and you paid $6,500 for it, did you really get burned?

[18:54] Your game is now worth almost double that. And so you should cash out and get the new one.

[19:01] And you've had 12 years of pinball enjoyment. You've had 12 years of enjoyment on the game. They didn't burn you.

[19:08] But look, if they made more LEs of Jaws, yeah. Like if they made a 50th anniversary of Jaws and released it a year after the new one, yeah.

[19:16] Then you're burning all those LE guys. Like Godzilla was going to be the burn.

[19:20] They were going to do Godzilla LE as the black and white 70th and that would have burned everybody.

[19:27] So I think they're finding that middle ground. Some might call it a loophole, but I think it's interesting.

[19:33] Now Jersey Jack's CEs make no sense to me. There's not a thousand people that want to spend $15,000 on Avatar.

[19:41] And the problem with their business model is like those damn LEs, they make 5,000 of them and they're $12,000.

[19:49] Like you almost have to have your head examined to buy a Jersey Jack LE. If you have 12, you have 15.

[19:58] And I just don't think Jersey Jack machines are collectible. They really only have one machine.

[20:04] One machine that's worth collecting and that's Pirates CE. How many were there? 200.

[20:11] Think about it. 200. That's the only reason why that game is collectible and held so much value.

[20:19] And then the LE of Pirates is the second game that's worth collecting because they only made 800 in total of that game.

[20:27] I don't even think in total. I think it's something like maybe 700 and then there's a few like standard edition Pirates.

[20:33] But that's it. And I get that some people out there hate this.

[20:37] Like you hate that there's collectors that want expensive limited versions of Pinball.

[20:43] But without the collectors people, Pinball wouldn't even be here. It wouldn't even have stuck around.

[20:50] The LEs are what have driven the extremely great sales of Pinball all these years because the LEs are what drive sales in the premium.

[21:00] And it all trickles down. It's what's kept these dealers and distros making a lot of money.

[21:06] And I also heard that like Stern doesn't make much money on a pro.

[21:11] They're probably selling the pro for too cheap and they make some money back on the LE.

[21:17] And so, you know, the cost of making these games has become a lot more expensive.

[21:21] And so that's where we're at.

[21:23] So let's see what Canadian experiment with Metallica LE.

[21:28] Let's see how that experiment goes. How much do you think people would pay for this game?

[21:33] Email me at canadapinballatgmail.com or drop your response into the comments of this show.

[21:41] But people FOMO is back.

[21:43] And ultimately FOMO only really works for the long term.

[21:48] If a game is great. If you look at the difference between 500 Metallica's and 500 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[21:57] It's night and day. There's not the frenzy to get an Alice spot now.

[22:02] I still think they're going to sell out of every game, but I don't think Alice is going to go up in value.

[22:08] In six months, right? When they've made a few hundred and it's easier to get and people realize, you know, there's not the deepest game.

[22:17] You know, and people might get tired of the gameplay and the simplicity of it.

[22:21] You're going to see them trade hands and I don't think they're going to trade hands for over what they were new.

[22:27] I think that game will hold around like 10 to 11 thousand dollars.

[22:31] I don't think it'll go below that, but Metallica LE, I think is the opposite.

[22:36] I think as time goes on, they will become harder to get, not easier.

[22:42] So don't listen to the pin side babies. They don't know what they're talking about.

[22:47] This game is going to keep going on the up and up. Everybody love you guys.

[22:52] Happy Monday. More shows coming this week.
