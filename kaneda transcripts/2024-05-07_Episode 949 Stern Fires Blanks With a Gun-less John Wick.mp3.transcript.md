[00:00] We got it!

[00:02] Time to get it!

[00:30] With no guns in it!

[00:32] There are no guns on the artwork!

[00:34] When you open up that chest underneath John Wick's floor, there's no guns in it!

[00:38] I remember the movie!

[00:40] I remember when he uses that sledgehammer and he opens up that chest!

[00:44] One side are the gold coins and the other side are his guns!

[00:49] How can you make a John Wick pinball machine with no guns in it?

[00:53] What is this?

[00:54] Like the woke Disney version of John Wick?

[00:56] Thank you!

[00:57] No thank you, Stern Pinball!

[00:59] It's hard to stop there!

[01:00] Look, let's get serious though.

[01:01] Like this game looks fine.

[01:03] You know, there's not a lot to hate about this game, but there's also not a ton to love in this game.

[01:09] When the main feature of a Stern Pinball machine that they want you to buy for $13,000.

[01:15] When the main feature is a bash toy that swings out that opens up a ball pathway,

[01:22] that's the main mechanism in this game.

[01:25] Think about a game like Lord of the Rings, right?

[01:28] Would they start as the ball rock being the main highlight of that game?

[01:33] Even that toy has way more drama and excitement in it.

[01:36] But no, you get the bash toy, you get the upper play field,

[01:39] you get the ring that magnetically freezes the ball in midair.

[01:43] That's my thing about this game.

[01:45] It's like, it's fine!

[01:47] There's just nothing about it that screams, take my money now!

[01:52] There's nothing about it that screams.

[01:55] We had to stay up late at night to figure out how to engineer this into the game.

[02:00] And I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but the Stern lighting system is looking so poor right now.

[02:07] Like these games just don't look modern.

[02:10] They don't bring that like Neo Tokyo, New York City, Skyline, World of John Wick to life.

[02:17] I'm sorry, but how can Stern Pinball in 2024 walk up to an Elton John machine

[02:23] and see what's possible from a modern lighting standpoint in Pinball

[02:28] and then try to sell us this like bag of like Tic Tac lights for like $13,000?

[02:34] It's just not there!

[02:36] And I know what you're saying.

[02:38] You're like, Canada, take a deep breath and believe me, I'm not offended by this game.

[02:42] I was never gonna buy this game.

[02:44] I didn't want to hate this game.

[02:45] I don't even hate this game.

[02:46] I love John Wick as a movie.

[02:48] But you can't make a Stern Pinball machine based on John Wick and have no guns in the artwork.

[02:54] Look at Pulp Fiction.

[02:55] Did they remove the guns from that Pinball machine?

[02:58] John Wick fires more guns in like 10 minutes than the entire three hours of Pulp Fiction the movie.

[03:05] And when you look at Pulp Fiction Pinball, you've got the big gun smack dab in the middle of the play field.

[03:11] You got Samuel L. Jackson pointing a gun at you as a sculpt in the game.

[03:16] And then you look at John Wick and it's like Stern wants him to just use nunchucks and pencils and other things like Samurai Swords.

[03:24] But where are the guns?

[03:26] I think this game is gonna have a very meaty ochre response and it's just proving my fear that none of these Stern games can be designed to be worth what they want us to pay for these games.

[03:39] When you lift the play field on John Wick, trust me, ladies and gentlemen, when you lift the play field on this game,

[03:45] it's gonna be empty underneath.

[03:48] Like empty.

[03:49] I mean, think about it.

[03:50] Like where is the engineering?

[03:51] I know this is like a new designer in Elliott Eisman, but like I was expecting more wow toys in this game and they're just not there.

[04:00] They're all right.

[04:02] The artwork by Randy Martinez is nice.

[04:04] I think the artwork looks good.

[04:06] I like the Ellie art package on the game.

[04:08] I think for some reason the premium art package is both on Jaws and this.

[04:13] Stern is really sandbagging the premiums.

[04:16] I think they know that they're not moving a thousand Ellie's anymore.

[04:20] They're really trying to push people towards these Ellie's because the premiums just don't look good.

[04:24] And when I'm looking at this game and I'm thinking about the features of the pro, I just feel like the pro might be the way to go on John Wick.

[04:32] But deep down, ladies and gentlemen, deep down in your pinball souls, you know you're not gonna buy this game.

[04:39] Like you almost have to be a moron and I mean this and I don't want to insult any of you, but you almost have to be a moron to buy a John Wick Ellie new inbox for $13,000.

[04:51] Stern is gonna make every one of these games by the end of this year.

[04:56] It's not even gonna take 12 months.

[04:58] By the end of this year, trust me, new inbox, John Wick Ellie's will be selling for $9,000.

[05:06] So you could save $4,000 if you wait or you could be a moron and buy it today because money is no object to you.

[05:14] I'm trying to look out for each and every one of you.

[05:17] This just isn't gonna work.

[05:18] Stern's just not gonna be able to do this.

[05:20] They don't have enough Elwynn bangers in the portfolio coming out.

[05:24] They just don't.

[05:25] And I really feel bad for all the designers and all the Stern fans because when you think about the direction that Seth Davis has taken this company,

[05:34] he's removed all of our enthusiasm.

[05:36] He's removed all of the FOMO.

[05:38] It used to be so much fun to get that giddy FOMO on the eve of a pinball launch.

[05:43] And now if you're on an Ellie list, it feels like you're on a detention list.

[05:47] It feels like you're being punished.

[05:49] Like if you had to buy an Ellie for $13,000, that feels like punishment.

[05:54] It doesn't feel like a reward.

[05:56] And until Stern fixes this, every single game they come out with now is gonna be looked at like this.

[06:02] And I think they're destroying this hobby.

[06:04] I think they're destroying their very own business model and it's just not gonna work.

[06:09] It's just not gonna work.

[06:10] There's no way these games even fit the bill for this much money and they're overpriced.

[06:15] And they're making games like Elton John look even more attractive because at least games like that feel like modern pinball experiences where there's more innovation.

[06:24] And you know what Stern wants.

[06:27] They want to push us into this world where like Insider Connected and achievements are where we're gonna get the value.

[06:35] You know why they want to push us there?

[06:37] Because that's cheap for them to do.

[06:39] To make these silly badges on Insider Connected.

[06:43] It doesn't cost them much.

[06:44] Those things never break.

[06:46] And so they want to take this highly physical kinetic game, take out most of the mechanical magic, the physical kinetic magic,

[06:54] and then want to replace it with artwork and software and Internet Connected badges as a way to justify these prices.

[07:01] It's not gonna work ladies and gentlemen.

[07:03] I saw this game.

[07:05] I didn't have high hopes.

[07:06] It's not pissing me off.

[07:08] It's just such an easy pass.

[07:10] Like it's like okay this feels like it's gonna be venom all over again.

[07:14] You know some people are gonna buy it and say it's amazing and so much fun.

[07:17] But the truth is this.

[07:18] If you buy this game, you're gonna lose a fortune because the demand is never gonna be there for it.

[07:25] I'm gonna go have lunch.

[07:27] It's sunny outside.

[07:28] Everybody thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[07:30] Obviously we will be talking more about this game this week.

[07:34] But that's my initial impressions of John Wick.

[07:37] Nothing majorly magical in it.

[07:39] And a John Wick game with no guns in the artwork shows me that Stern is the new Disney.

[07:47] They went woke and when you go woke on something like John Wick, you're gonna go broke Stern.

[07:52] We're not buying this.

[07:54] We're grown men.

[07:55] Stop treating us like kids.

[07:57] Especially if you want us to spend $13,000 on a non-essential toy.

[08:01] Canada out. Peace.

[08:02] Canada's pinball farm camp.

[08:04] It's gonna bring you down.

[08:07] C'mon.

[08:08] It's making the fortune.
