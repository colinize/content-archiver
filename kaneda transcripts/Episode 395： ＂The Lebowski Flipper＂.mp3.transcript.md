[00:00] I know there are people with lots of negativity and of course it could go wrong in the end as well but

[00:06] At this point I think you know I'm in 100% control of the company. There are no more lawsuits

[00:12] I don't have any manufacturer to talk to when things need to be done

[00:19] It's all in my hands now and I know that

[00:24] That I can do this

[00:30] Welcome to episode 395 of Canada's pinball podcast

[00:37] Well, you just heard from Barry

[00:39] He has come out of hiding and did an interview with pinball news and magazine podcasts

[00:45] It's two and a half hours long lots of ums lots of pauses lots of laughter

[00:53] But lots of information on what the plan is moving forward on Dutch pinball

[00:58] I will summarize for you the cliff notes and main things that I pulled away from listening to all of that interview

[01:05] And on this episode of canada's pinball podcast we're also going to interview someone who flipped

[01:10] They're a big Lebowski for a big box

[01:13] And I know that was something we all knew it happened when those 40 games from a or a went out

[01:18] So it's I'm just I think you're gonna enjoy listening to what goes on inside the mind of someone who's trading a game

[01:24] That was made for somebody else, but here's the takeaway

[01:28] On all of this and if you listen to the interview

[01:31] I don't know about you

[01:32] But part of what I pulled away was the jovial nature that is still existing in Barry's head

[01:40] There's lots of laughter. There's lots of like playful banter

[01:44] He doesn't seem like he fully gets it and what I mean by that is I just don't think he ever takes this that

[01:52] Seriously and maybe he does but maybe it's just in his nature

[01:56] But I don't want to hear laughter and I don't want to I don't want it to sound like you're having a good time here because

[02:03] Five years have passed and the majority of your customers have been burned

[02:07] I almost don't want to hear anything from you until you figure out what to do

[02:13] But here's what they do best they sell you on hope that it's all gonna work out that you should be as optimistic as they are

[02:22] That they're going to figure this whole thing out now. Here's some of the key points if you're an early achiever

[02:28] And you are waiting for your game they have started to put together what their plan is their plan is to

[02:36] Manufacture these games by themselves. They are gonna move away from a Ra

[02:40] They're not making the games in China the games will be made in the Netherlands by Dutch Pimbal

[02:46] Who will help them make these games?

[02:47] They're not sure yet. They're gonna start small. It sounds like it's gonna be buried and just maybe a couple people

[02:53] Putting the initial games together

[02:56] Okay, he says he has money to do this

[02:58] He also said he is not going to take any more pre-order money to get things going

[03:04] So if you are asked to pay for a game that's not yet in a box do not do that, okay?

[03:10] Be smart this time. So where is that external investment coming from we don't know yet?

[03:16] They avoided bankruptcy with the coin taker deal

[03:20] Here's the really interesting part to make the EA's whole

[03:25] Barry has estimated that he needs to sell between four and

[03:30] 500 big Lebowski's at $12,500

[03:35] Okay, and after that point and only after that point will EA games be made

[03:41] He's not gonna make like two new games and then give an EA a game. It can't happen like that

[03:46] Okay, so then he also went and made the cardinal mistake that all these companies do when they restart

[03:53] Remember Andrew highway used to do this without knowing when they're gonna start production without knowing who their labor is

[04:00] Without having all the parts ready

[04:03] He's already giving an estimate by which he believes all of those games will be made and he said by the end of next year

[04:11] So by the end of 2020

[04:14] Dutch pinball a company that has no manufacturing capabilities right now a company that has never manufactured a single pinball machine before themselves

[04:23] Has just put out on a podcast that they're gonna make 500 games and then you have to ask yourself

[04:29] Well, since they're not making them right now that could be upwards of 10 games a week

[04:35] Do you think that they can pull it off?

[04:37] I mean, that's kind of what spooky pinball is making on a weekly basis and Charlie's got

[04:42] 18 employees and he's been doing it for years and he's figured out you know the assembly line and all the

[04:48] Manufacturing and all the vendors and all the play field issues

[04:51] He has built that company slowly to get up to 500 games a year and now we have Barry without even a company around him

[05:00] Who is making the same promise?

[05:02] So take it for what it's worth that is where we are at right now

[05:06] It seems like the road to get there's going to be long

[05:09] I am doubtful that we will see it in a year from now and I'll say this I walked away from that interview

[05:17] And I listened to the whole thing and half of it was just like you know

[05:20] There's no guarantees, but yet I'm gonna guarantee something you know

[05:24] It could be really hard, but I'm very optimistic. I don't know why

[05:28] ARA selling these 20 get these 40 games through coin taker all of a sudden creates these greener

[05:34] Pastures that they're trying to sell us on I think this story now has reached a point where I

[05:41] Just I'm tired of talking about Barry and Dutch pinball and I walked away from this podcast and I have to be honest with you

[05:48] Even having one of these 40 aRA games. I don't even want it

[05:53] You know, I I I hear him talk and I hear the way he talks about this whole thing and it sort of leaves you just kind of

[06:01] Deflated it does because it just nothing feels quite honest nothing feels truthful

[06:07] Nothing feels good like this just it just shouldn't be this way

[06:11] You shouldn't show a pinball machine in 2014 take 200 orders for games and now six years later

[06:19] You might make those people whole and the one question that we just don't get the one question that we just don't get is

[06:27] Where is the money Lebowski? Where did all that money go? It's still never really fully answered

[06:33] Okay, so that's where we're at you should listen to it lots in there not gonna

[06:38] You're not gonna grab clips from it. I've poor got poor Jeff over at this week in pinball

[06:43] He has to transcribe that thing you got to listen through so many ums and awkward pauses to get to the end of it

[06:49] But that is what it is all right now here's the thing too

[06:53] I think we've all beat in the clear code thing to death you guys know we're waiting to see what the sob will be

[06:58] We're gonna leave it at that okay

[07:00] Lots of negativity lately. I just read in the Willy Wonka's thread someone said

[07:04] Kinatus full of s h i t

[07:06] This is one of the greatest games ever and I have to say if you like Willy Wonka that's great

[07:10] I'm so happy you like Willy Wonka

[07:13] It might not just be the game for me and has anyone out there show of hands ever

[07:18] Changed your mind on a game. I didn't change my mind because of the way the game shot

[07:23] I changed my mind because of the way the game is coded and and I'm allowed to change my mind on a game

[07:29] Because of that right I also don't like

[07:32] Left out lane that is designed like an orbit that drains so easily

[07:38] I played it at sunshine this week and I played two games

[07:40] I played Jurassic Park and I played Willy Wonka and I played $10 on each game the two hot games available

[07:48] Right now and I'll say this look Willy Wonka far more far more impressive to stand over that game than Jurassic Park

[07:54] I mean Jersey Jack games just look leagues leagues above stern machines in terms of of materials used and quality

[08:03] And just like the overall package is so much greater in a Jersey Jack game now that being said

[08:10] Which one did I have more fun playing and on location and this was a wonka SC on location

[08:17] Jurassic Park just plays much better. It's much easier to get into it right away much easier to understand what you're doing right away

[08:24] And I have to say I thought Jurassic Park is a really fun game

[08:28] I think it's really fun to shoot the upper loop is super fast and awesome and within a few games

[08:34] I'm getting multiple multi balls going and you know

[08:37] You feel like you're going through the park and the integration of the shaker motor with the dinosaurs walking

[08:42] It's all very cool

[08:43] Would I own one and again? I'm just gonna be honest if it was based on the movie

[08:48] I'd be much more likely to pull the trigger on Jurassic Park

[08:52] I just have fun at Sunshine and then I play a bunch of games and I just don't feel the desire to then own these games anymore

[09:00] I just don't there's just something about when you have games close to you and at Sunshine the volumes are high and you can get into the games

[09:08] I don't know like I could take 50 bucks there a week and enjoy

[09:13] Jurassic Park as much as I want or I could spend like

[09:17] 6,000 7,500 9,000 dollars and be able to play it whenever I want so I don't know

[09:22] I don't know I think I need to play it more and I think all of us are on the same boat like you have to play a game

[09:28] A bunch of times to know it's a keeper. It's not one of the games where I'm like immediately like I have to have this game and

[09:33] Bolted to my floor, but it's a great game. It's a great game

[09:38] A Stern's use now of the LCD and the way it throws you right into Jurassic Park is really awesome

[09:46] I mean the animations the sound effects the callouts I thought everything in it was really fun. It's immediate

[09:52] That's the other thing about Stern. It's like immediately you're like immersed in the game

[09:57] Wanker the same way the music's going on willy-wanker

[09:59] I think with Wanker the problem is when you jump on it

[10:02] It's still very confusing. I think what to do right away. I just it doesn't have the same like

[10:06] Okay, we're in the chocolate factory when we're going all right, but here's my thing people

[10:11] They're both great games and they're both gonna be magical to some people and misses to other people and it doesn't

[10:19] Nothing is objective here. This is all our subjective

[10:23] Opinions about these games. I think I'm happy if I zoom out

[10:27] I'm happy that we have a Jurassic Park and a willy-wanker game. Okay, the next is El Vira

[10:33] Here's a rumor I heard not sure if it's true or not, but I don't think anyone else has said this

[10:37] I heard there's going to be a super limited edition of

[10:42] El Vira that becomes available

[10:44] Which would kind of make sense because I do hear Stern is going above and beyond with El Vira

[10:50] So if you're waiting and you're waiting to see maybe how this clear code stuff pans out and you're waiting to see

[10:56] What deep roots gonna do you might want to wait to to see what they put into El Vira

[11:02] But it's a good time

[11:03] It's a good time to be part of the hobby you have to admit you have so many options right now and those quality control issues

[11:11] They will ultimately work out and and I do believe that these companies will do right by their consumers

[11:17] I do I do I think they know they have to we're a small hobby

[11:21] We're a small group of people that buys a lot of these machines and the last thing they want to do is get the die-hards upset and

[11:28] Push people away from buying these games now ultimately I think all of us right you take a little bit of a break

[11:35] You have a little bit of a philosophical moment and you start to realize you might not need to own every new game

[11:41] And you can't afford to and you don't have space because there's just so many options coming out

[11:45] There's a whole nother American pinball game coming out. There's a cactus canyons coming out El Vira

[11:51] Deeproot, you know so many so many options of where to go and I implore everybody out there in my last show

[11:58] He said it just be nicer to each other be nicer. Yes, canators allowed to change his mind on a pinball machine and guess what so are you?

[12:06] So here is an interesting interview take it for what it's worth

[12:10] I think I asked him all the tough questions and all the questions you would ask

[12:14] I know you guys like interviews. We're gonna talk to Dr.

[12:17] Frightner Larry. I saw he posted something that is just incredible

[12:21] He just he just like beats down Pinside people. It's it's incredible

[12:25] Anyway guys enjoy this interview. We'll be back later this week with another interview and also please check out

[12:31] Special when let's podcast they did a really awesome thing they went back and they pulled old interviews with Python

[12:38] Angelo and Pat Lawler in which they discuss the clear coat hardness and how actually pinball machines were designed to have the clear coats

[12:48] fall apart and break down so that operators would buy new machines

[12:53] Really interesting take on pinball and then the diamond coating came out and changed all that

[12:57] Maybe we need some more diamond coating in 2019

[13:01] Everybody thank you for listening to canators pinball podcast. I really appreciate it

[13:05] I appreciate everyone who donates to my patreon page and

[13:09] Again enjoy your pinball machines canators pinball podcast out. Let's hear about flipping the big Lebowski

[13:15] Alright ladies and gentlemen canada is crying like a baby after watching big fish with his wife talking

[13:22] to Josh Kush who recently

[13:25] Sold a big Lebowski Josh welcome to the show good morning. How are you doing? How's your labor day weekend going?

[13:33] Fantastic fantastic. All right. Well look you are a

[13:38] Special guest of the show because you've done something that I was planning to do but did not do you

[13:44] Got a big Lebowski. Let's start from the beginning of this story. So you tell us you are a pre-order

[13:51] Or had a deposit down with coin ticker correct

[13:55] Correct now what year was that

[13:59] Honestly, I didn't even know about it till I heard it on your show. Oh real okay. So you are a recent

[14:05] Order for the game very recent in fact when I

[14:09] Corresponded with Melissa. She said that sorry the list is full and there must have been somebody or

[14:16] multiple people actually that

[14:19] Decided for one reason or another that it wasn't for them and they backed out. Wow

[14:24] Okay, so let's take it back even further. So

[14:28] Had you seen the pen over the years had you have you ever played it like what made you interested in the game?

[14:34] Absolutely. I mean I've been you know

[14:37] Intimately involved in pinball as an operator for many years and I've always loved the game. I thought it was beautiful but

[14:46] You know, I thought it was

[14:48] just very well made and I

[14:52] Like the theme and you know, it's always kind of had this mystique surrounding it, you know, right?

[14:59] Okay, so you you played it you you love the game and then you heard about it on this show now interesting because

[15:06] We started to get rumors on pinside that they had reached a deal and that coin ticker would be

[15:13] Opening up the order books to sell those 40 a. R. A games and so then you you sort of lucked out right Josh

[15:20] I mean someone bailed on it and these games so did you just email Melissa once you heard the show and you said put me on the list

[15:27] And then she called you back and said hey, I got a spot if you want it

[15:31] That's that's exactly what happened actually. I emailed with a you know a hell Mary

[15:36] I said hey listen if anybody wants to bow out

[15:39] You know, I'd be more than happy to take their spot over but I never

[15:43] Never in a million years thought that anybody that had the opportunity to get one

[15:48] Would kind of reneg on their deal but apparently more than one person did it was kind of crazy too

[15:55] Because people were waiting to the next morning to see if the games would go up for sale officially and I think

[16:00] By the by midnight that day

[16:04] They probably were all spoken for I mean in a world of

[16:08] Social media and emails and text messages

[16:11] I think people who waited sort of incorrectly

[16:16] Didn't understand the demand on this game so okay, but here's what I want to talk about Josh

[16:19] So you got one and then you sold it now we want I want to talk about that

[16:24] So did you were you planning on keeping it or was your plan to sort of sell it because you you knew the market for it was hot

[16:33] Oh, absolutely. I fully intended on on reselling it immediately

[16:38] You know

[16:38] Listen, I probably lost more than I'll ever make in this hobby

[16:42] Sold games probably way too cheap as I've seen people resell games that I've sold them right away

[16:49] So you know, I thought um this would be a great opportunity to kind of recoup some of those losses and be able to

[16:57] Deliver a game that somebody's really been wanting for quite some time and

[17:02] Somebody that's going to really love and appreciate the game

[17:06] Um a lot more than than I would right now

[17:09] What do you say to those people and and I've been called this and now you know, I'll tell you the that were unethical

[17:16] Vultures who's who've been and

[17:18] bought a game that was someone else's and then sold it for profit what sure yeah

[17:24] What do you what do your thoughts when people are are saying that about flippers on this game?

[17:29] Listen, you know, I I posted on Facebook. I posted it on pinside, you know everybody. It just

[17:35] Honestly, I felt like the most vocal people were the ones that had nothing at stake in the first place

[17:42] If anything those EA's had every right to be upset however

[17:47] You know the way I look at it obviously is a little differently um you had

[17:53] This contract manufacturer a r a that you know, they have a payroll and I'm sure that

[18:00] This was a huge impact to their you know to their cash flow working capital etc. So they've been

[18:08] kind of

[18:09] Out half a million that they've had to front

[18:13] To you know to keep the lights on so if anything

[18:17] The 12 5 and you know, obviously they are there 40 you know 40 of us

[18:22] So half a million capital injection that went into dutch pinball helped to

[18:26] Satisfy that payroll that never got paid at a array and now Barry has a bunch of parts

[18:33] So

[18:34] I would say that there's probably even better chance of EA's being satisfied now than in the first place right

[18:41] Okay, so I get I get the initial purchase of the game

[18:44] Is the only way forward for dutch pinball but back to the question of

[18:51] Flipping it for a profit right because I've done that before on previous games and the reason why I've sort of been like well

[18:56] You know on this one it feels a little little little off because

[19:01] It is hard to

[19:02] Escape the fact right that you bought someone's machine that was already bought and paid for in full and then sold it for

[19:10] Profit now do you feel bad about that? I I because they're do you yeah

[19:15] I just want to hear like what your thoughts are in that part of it because

[19:18] Should people be profiting off of someone else's pain and suffering?

[19:25] Listen, I totally understand where you're where you're coming from on that and you know the fact that somebody's EA

[19:32] Badge was removed from this game that that kind of really drives that point home. I mean

[19:38] um

[19:39] but again

[19:41] Who's to say that these games wanted to continue to sit or right been auctioned off or

[19:48] I mean who knows what would have happened to these games. I mean, you know

[19:51] Do I view myself as a as a savior? No, okay? I'm definitely you know opportunistic and I saw an opportunity in the market

[20:01] And you got to remember I also took a risk. I mean not as much as an EA of course, but

[20:07] You know, I had no idea that these games were gonna flow. I could have been out 12.5. I mean I

[20:14] I did all my due diligence and if I never got the game I had very little record. So

[20:20] You know, there was a bit of

[20:22] risk taking on my part and you know, I should be compensated for that now

[20:28] obviously

[20:30] You know, it's it's it's really a shame what happened to the EA's

[20:34] But I would argue that there are chances of seeing a game now are much higher than before. I mean

[20:42] He could definitely do some sort of small batch production where you know, he maybe sells three games to retail customers that are actually

[20:52] You know, they actually have games that have been produced and then one

[20:57] EA could be satisfied for every three to four that are made new

[21:02] I don't think that would have ever happened had it not been for the 40 of us that injected that half a million

[21:08] Do you think that's ever gonna happen that we're gonna see more?

[21:12] Honestly

[21:14] Listen after I bought the game I was sweating bullets and I was doing a lot of research more so than just your you know

[21:21] Surface stuff and I took a real deep dive and I literally dissected every single piece of correspondence and video that has been put out by Dutch and

[21:31] You know, it seemed like Yop was really the driving force as far as a lot of the production was concerned

[21:38] but

[21:40] Barry

[21:42] You know, it's got a big ego. I mean, I think that it was Barry's ego that got in the way of kind of stepping down

[21:49] From you know, obviously that the ownership piece of it with a Ra because he could have very easily given up

[21:55] 51% of the company and the ERA would have continued to

[21:59] Make the games and they would have been delivered timely and they would have probably had a lot more out there in the wild

[22:05] So the fact that Barry had the ego to not want to let go of the company

[22:11] Was you know kind of viewed as a negative then I think that same negative it can be viewed as a positive going forward because

[22:19] Barry wants to

[22:21] Deliver I really think that I really think that Barry wants to make sure that those EA's get their games initially

[22:28] He recognizes that Dutch pinball would have been nothing without them

[22:33] Okay, so so Barry what's called Barry made off because his own his only plan

[22:39] Is the poll a Ponzi scheme situation which well, it's not well. Yeah, it's not Ponzi scheme

[22:45] It's a Ponzi scheme in that he does need new money to satisfy old clients

[22:52] I get that definition of a Ponzi scheme. I know I'm in finance

[22:55] I get and you know and and I saw the repercussions of what happened to Barty which is illegal

[23:02] Uh, it is illegal

[23:04] However in the way that this is going to be structured it

[23:08] Listen, he's not going to be able to pre-sale any games. Let's face it the only way yeah

[23:15] Let's stop there because then so he needs new capital then without pre-orders

[23:19] Not necessarily because you got to remember the capital that he has is already just laying there in parts

[23:24] He's just got to make the games and coin taker has now

[23:28] exhibited that

[23:30] They can get the games out so it's not like new money is coming in and we don't know what's coming out

[23:36] New money is going to be coming into games that are already made and coin taker has

[23:41] shown the world

[23:43] That they can actually do it right well the world probably doesn't care, but let me ask your question the

[23:50] But he do he has no cabinets and we heard from batten he has some cabinets

[23:54] He has some cabinets he hasn't enough how many he has I saw like let's couple

[23:59] There a thousand less than that's all that's all it takes that's all it takes

[24:03] Okay, but he also said he doesn't have all the parts

[24:05] He said some of the parts were we're we're lean and he needs to order them now we know

[24:11] Um from following this hobby that to order parts for a machine is anywhere between three and six months to get those parts in

[24:17] So we're looking

[24:19] earliest earliest right

[24:21] probably

[24:23] early 2020 mid 2020 before

[24:26] Another game is offered up for sale because you know Josh that no one's gonna

[24:30] Pay for anything unless they see a completed game in a box going to them

[24:35] I agree however, I would not underestimate the power of the collective if people want to see this game get done and get out then

[24:45] Trust me. There's people overseas

[24:48] That will

[24:49] Be more than happy to help facilitate right

[24:52] Barry getting some cabinets and if he's got you know three to four let's say okay, and he put some together

[24:59] Three of them can be sold to new buyers at 125 a pop and you know, whatever that is you know 36k or whatever

[25:05] He'd be more than

[25:06] able to squeeze out one ea for every three to four batch games that are created

[25:12] Do that like you think it's gonna happen together where it's like three here one two and he

[25:17] Or do you think it's just gonna be I see that's that's my big question mark is I don't know when the ea's will actually get made whole

[25:26] I listen it's gonna be a long time coming however you gotta remember it's just Barry now

[25:31] It's Barry and a pile of parts which makes it even more unlikely no

[25:36] It does make it more unlikely for a full stream kind of production

[25:43] Going on. I mean he I've seen things about Barry's looking for warehouses and manufacturing spaces and all that I think that's

[25:52] I think that's pying the sky. I think what the next thing he's gonna be looking for is a hydrofoil and he's gonna sell

[25:57] The Andrew highway into the pinball destiny, but here's the thing. I mean you raise a good point because

[26:02] you know can one man

[26:05] Set up an assembly line in a garage and make this gate. I mean is that what this company is now

[26:11] Reduced to I think so it's gonna be small batch production. I don't think there's uh who what manufacturer in the world would touch this

[26:21] This deal after seeing what happened with a alright people want to know they're gonna get paid and nobody's just gonna say oh yeah

[26:27] Go ahead and set up the line will invest hundreds of thousands of dollars and maybe it'll work out. Sorry

[26:33] American pinball seems to be like they they brought John poppadookin and let him spend I heard it was like

[26:39] $300,000 John spent of their money to get those magic girls made you think they should

[26:45] Call Barry up and be like hey, why don't you make it here? We'll make a thousand

[26:49] The first you know after 300 will have enough

[26:53] Do you think no that's never gonna happen because look Barry would not give up the ownership to a array

[26:59] So he he wants to keep this thing close

[27:02] There's no way that he's gonna have anybody else involved unless it's you know some contract manufacturer

[27:07] That's going to be able to negotiate with him

[27:11] um

[27:12] And he's in control. I mean that's what this has always been about so weird. It's always been about just there having control

[27:17] Yeah, so his ego clearly hurt everyone who believed in him and

[27:22] Where did the where did the almost two million dollars go that I just can't understand where the money went

[27:28] I mean my gosh, I can't even imagine how much money

[27:32] You know was spent in in and R&D development remember they had a huge staff and these were

[27:37] Professional engineers. I mean they're not you know $10 an hour employees

[27:40] So you've got you know the payroll keeps coming

[27:44] And and and that was where the money went. Yes, I've heard your point about you know the penthouse parties

[27:51] But you know, it's not like you know

[27:54] Shipping a game okay several several thousand bucks a hotel you know food and drink you know this maybe 10 20 grand

[28:02] I mean the millions is is in the payroll the the R&D the development the the rent for the facilities etc. I mean that

[28:11] That uh that's where the money went

[28:13] I don't think it was all just spent in dog and pony show

[28:15] I believe Scott Denise. He was wearing a Dutch pinball shirt back in the day

[28:20] I think he was on the website. Yeah, he helped them in in the in the software area

[28:25] He was when when they did the the tour of the game in New York at modern pinball

[28:29] He was there with Dutch pinball and Barry and they were all you know smiles and laughter

[28:35] I think you're right. I also think they probably paid themselves a handsome salary the fact that they said they didn't take into any money salary wise

[28:42] No way they're absolutely they paid themselves

[28:45] So look I think Josh you know to get back to like where we are today

[28:49] There's 40 games out there. How many of them do you think are gonna be opened up and played and how many do you think are gonna be flipped like you did

[28:58] Well, I mean the first somebody beat me to it. They listed it at 45k. Thank gosh. They did that because

[29:04] Well, I beat I beat everyone to it. I listed it for a hundred thousand on eBay

[29:08] No, no, no, I mean once they had the game in hand. I didn't think it was right to list it without having it in hand because that's speculative and and you know

[29:16] I wanted honestly, you know listen. I made a profit. There's no doubt. Yeah, how well you're not gonna tell us right just so listen to the shows like ask him how much he sold it for you

[29:25] You won't reveal that correct you saw what I listed before I listed it for 25 and honestly that was based on the discussion that I had with the seller of

[29:35] the last new inbox game

[29:37] Now granted that was an EA game and didn't have a lot of uh, you know the controversy surrounding these 40

[29:43] However, you know he had some very

[29:47] useful insight for me in in regard to how to consummate a sale

[29:52] Uh, can you can you share that insight with a game of that magnitude um sure so

[29:58] You know a lot of times

[30:00] It's not about

[30:02] How much you get but it's about can the buyer close and is the deal a win win and the gentleman that purchased that game

[30:11] um was

[30:13] Kind of looking to help support

[30:15] This gentleman's business. I mean, he had you know, he had payroll to meet he had other obligations and whatnot and

[30:21] You know, he wanted to open the game, but you know life happens and so he needed the cash and so the buyer felt good about where the money was being spent and

[30:31] You know, I know you you commented on oh, I don't really know if you know

[30:36] That's a good spin and in this then the other but truthfully that the proceeds from the sale are going to help more pinball get out on the street

[30:47] And they're going to be working and that was another factor as to why I

[30:52] Wanted to sell because you know, I can fix pinballs, but you know, I can't redesign pinballs and red manufacture bowling alley max

[31:02] And that sort of thing so that was also kind of one of the main factors to um to kind of consider

[31:08] So that was part of your sales story was that the profits of this will go to

[31:13] Helping expand pinball on location now look I think

[31:19] Are you saying that because there was somewhat of a good cause associated with your sale that the buyer felt also good about

[31:28] paying over for it because of that

[31:31] No, the buyer had really no

[31:35] No opinions one way or another on that honestly. Yeah, he's just a rich guy who has a big collection

[31:40] I mean, I know those guys and yeah, he doesn't have a big collection. He he has a primus and

[31:47] So I said okay, this makes sense and you know, they they did more due diligence on me than I did on him

[31:54] I mean they want to just a primus start to make sense of this what we I'm trying to find like what's that connection?

[31:59] Well because a primus let's face it a primus is a very special one-off type of game

[32:05] Hard to get you can get a primus is it is it was it I mean I see there's like one on ebay for like 20 grand that'll never move

[32:11] But was it hard to get a primus if you want it one

[32:15] Listen, I didn't try to get a primus so I can't vouch for that

[32:18] But I do know that this gentleman had a special connection with that band right knows best clay pool and

[32:25] He was willing to see the value in a special one-off game. So that could be translated to the labowski in that

[32:34] He understands the value of having a one-off game and doesn't mind paying a little bit extra for it and

[32:42] Well, what's a little bit? So did you did you get near 25? You don't have to tell me the exact number

[32:47] Honestly, I didn't I didn't get as high as I thought I would I did not be make a sales record by any means

[32:54] and I actually got a higher offer

[32:57] Than the one that I accepted because this gentleman seemed like the most logical buyer

[33:03] He's been in love with the big labowski. He has a special connection to the movie

[33:09] He

[33:10] Was a Bitcoin early investor. So he you know pisses 20 grand or whatever 25k and makes no difference to him

[33:19] So you know, it was it just felt right

[33:23] Okay, all right, so rich guy

[33:27] Bitcoin millionaire

[33:29] Fan of the movie gets the game and and look I when I flip games. I've always said this you know

[33:34] The as long as the buyer and the seller are happy

[33:38] You know you're who cares right would anyone else things but there this

[33:42] This is a different story and it just is I mean absolutely it's a very high profile sale

[33:47] I mean what do you say to the people that say man like why do you you went in on it 100% to flip it like you were a speculator

[33:56] And what do you say to the people who are like why don't you give up your spot to someone who just wants to enjoy the game like

[34:02] Why did you even do like does the money matter to you? It's not like I

[34:06] Pushed everybody down the list. I wasn't even on the list people bowed out

[34:11] Why didn't those people give it if you're bowing out at 12.5 then you're clearly not in it for the money

[34:16] And you're in it for the love of it then you should have offered an EA your spot instead of bowing out like a pussy

[34:23] Right right

[34:24] Well, okay, but then it but it still lands on your at your doorstep where you have the option

[34:30] And you look you took advantage of it and you know for those who are pinball speculators and flippers

[34:36] This was like getting in at an IPO price on a stock you know is gonna go up

[34:40] I mean it just was everyone knew

[34:42] Lebowski's were worth more than 12.5 on on the secondary market

[34:47] Well for now

[34:49] Who knows on apparently on monday they're coming out with some sort of new news

[34:54] And that could be that there will be more made and it could be more official and coin taker has shown that

[35:01] They can make it happen. So you know what what happens if that happens then then the reach to resell market falls apart or at least takes a hit

[35:10] Oh, absolutely absolutely, but

[35:12] You know

[35:14] Game in a box that can go to your door tomorrow will always be valuable in the big Lebowski world a a newsletter or a promise to make more

[35:22] Will hold no weight in in this story because they've they've absolutely shown no ability to deliver on anything

[35:29] I mean these games were made three years ago by by a game has changed now the game has changed now

[35:35] We don't have the lawsuit hanging over our head. We don't we don't have all these contingent liabilities that we have to deal with

[35:42] And you also don't have a manufacturer and you don't have an assembly line and you you don't have them the things necessary

[35:47] You don't know you're right

[35:48] They're gonna have to tool up slowly in small batch production

[35:52] Absolutely is going to be a long road it could take years right and then you've got the you know

[35:57] The license you're up against and so many other things and as you mentioned the lead time on some of these specialty parts is definitely going to be a factor

[36:05] but

[36:06] You know, I honestly think that Barry does have good intentions with all this and he wants to see those EA

[36:13] Satisfied I really do

[36:16] Yeah, I don't share the same optimism. I'll tell you why

[36:21] Well, I'll just tell you why I mean you know Barry's a crook. There's no way around it

[36:25] He I don't think he's a crook. I do million dollars of people's hard-earned money, right?

[36:31] And here's why he's a crook because at the moment of which a Ra said look

[36:36] The only way to get people what they paid for is to hand over the company, right?

[36:40] At that moment he decided that his ego and his personal desires outweighed

[36:48] The harder money of his consumers

[36:51] He then became a crook and what he's doing right now

[36:54] Which is selling other people's games to new buyers is criminal

[36:59] Like there's nothing there's it do you disagree with that? I mean it's criminal

[37:04] You bought a car Josh you bought a car right the manufacturer of that car sold it to you for $8500

[37:10] You then never got the car they then sold that car to somebody else for 12.5

[37:16] How would you feel

[37:19] I get it, but what if what if that company

[37:23] Would have failed

[37:25] And had no ability to get me my car

[37:28] Should fail you like it's like it's like saying to Bernie made off hey Bernie

[37:33] Like we'll let you try another round of in of funding

[37:37] To fix this no he's in jail he's dead right now right this you you it's not fair

[37:46] In life to give a criminal a second chance like this is it?

[37:51] I don't I don't necessarily agree that it's criminal and you gotta listen

[37:56] Huh this is interesting the because you bring up the birdie main off thing

[38:00] Bernie main off never made a single trade

[38:03] And it was the it was the notoriety of being that guy

[38:07] That could help somebody else and he it was interesting because when he got busted

[38:12] He blamed the victims he said listen the victims were just throwing the money at me

[38:15] What do you want me to do and so the being being the guy was what it was all about

[38:22] And so for berry it's this when you juxtapose it. It's very similar. Berry wants to be the guy

[38:28] He wants to be the

[38:29] Deliverer of the big Lebowski pinball to the masses and there's something there that will I think help propel this little batch production thing

[38:42] Um, yeah, but Josh shouldn't be allowed

[38:44] He shouldn't be allowed to get another go at it because what he's just done to bail himself out is criminal

[38:52] Well, I'm I'm actually kind of surprised that the early EA's didn't file an injunction years ago to stop all of this shit from actually going down

[39:00] Yeah, and they're still not

[39:03] They're stealing good at they should have look what happened to the zidware

[39:06] I mean those guys are at least being made whole right most part

[39:09] I mean, but they got together. I mean with all the as you mentioned the social networking and all these different platforms

[39:16] They could have definitely banded together in some sort of capacity

[39:19] And I read that thread from that attorney that was intimately involved with the zidware lawsuit and that sort of thing and said it's you know chasing

[39:27] You know good, you know bad money with good money. I understand that but

[39:32] But how the Duke had his day in court which was good enough for a lot of people who got burned

[39:36] They wanted to see John

[39:38] suffer and face the music obviously they couldn't control him getting bailed out by American pinball now by deep route

[39:44] But at least he faced some of the music

[39:48] Well, I don't know why buried in just get an extra thousand bucks per EA and just because he was lying

[39:53] You think it was that's my thing is this he the rumor is it was a thousand more euro that aria wanted per game right

[40:00] And that what why didn't he go back

[40:04] To the buyers and say that's what it's gonna cost you like yeah, why not because he's a liar

[40:10] Because that story's probably not even true

[40:12] It was also more of a pride thing to remember. Okay, so once again his pride overrides

[40:18] Everyone's interests

[40:20] yes, and

[40:22] That while that's a negative it could be spun as a positive going forward with his commitment to actually satisfy the EA's if he wanted to just bail

[40:31] But that he wouldn't have had he wouldn't have even gone through trying to facilitate this deal

[40:35] But that's my whole point

[40:36] But that's my whole point is if we live in a society and in a world in which we allow people's ego maniac

[40:44] Sort of sociopathic like entitlement, you know, everything he did like all this criminal behavior

[40:50] If you're basically saying the the driving force behind a personality like that

[40:56] Could drive him into like a legal behavior

[40:59] But it also could drive him into like making it right because he's so driven with his ego

[41:04] But I just don't think we should live in a world in which you get those kinds of second chances because

[41:08] It's not fair like is it fair on any level that all these other pinball companies who are making you know

[41:15] Are doing the hard work to get their customers whole have to watch Barry piss through two million dollars

[41:21] Sell yeah, but they don't have any other. I mean they had one other answer

[41:26] But isn't there an option isn't there another option? Isn't there another option where Barry is just defaults

[41:31] Gets prosecuted for his criminal behavior or at least

[41:35] Declare's bankruptcy and then much like Andrew highway did step down and allows someone else to come in

[41:43] Declare bankruptcy

[41:45] Go and solve it and then someone takes over the project because

[41:50] That that that was my point is that it's not criminal behavior and the fact that he

[41:54] Facilitated this sale and is trying to make it right

[41:58] Shows that the pride in the ego is what's going to drive him to satisfy the eAs as opposed to just declaring bk

[42:07] And walking from all this and just going on as is marry way

[42:10] Yeah, I'm not not I get it. I get it

[42:13] I mean there's you could look at it one way where

[42:16] He's trying to do the right thing now and get everyone made home and we should cheerlead that and support him

[42:22] I just look at it the other way

[42:23] I think that he's done nothing but mislead his buyers for three to four years

[42:29] He's spun this to always make it seem like he's the victim to ares greed

[42:34] And he's never been fully honest about this whole situation and he only talks to

[42:39] You know his friends over like Jonathan juxtain and the people who like who blindly support him

[42:45] Is the only place he'll answer the music like like Josh he would never come on this show

[42:49] Because he would never he would never be able to answer the basic questions of where the where the money go Barry

[42:54] We all know where the money went. It wasn't pissed away. I mean a

[42:58] Certainly a portion of it had had to do with you know the promotion of the game

[43:04] But I would I would say that the largest portion was in you know setting up the manufacturing

[43:10] Okay, but I think everybody to develop the game. I mean they do have a game

[43:14] It's not like this was just pying the sky and in development and no game was ever produced

[43:19] They proved that they could do it and they did it right for the first 40 batches

[43:24] The second 40 batches, you know that there was a lot of other

[43:28] Comical but but Josh he's got okay, so he's got like a hundred and fifty to two hundred pre-order dollars in it

[43:34] 8500 most of them paid in full

[43:37] He then only 40 games went out which is

[43:41] But you know 40 times 8500 what is that like 400,000 at most

[43:47] He had two million dollars

[43:50] You know, and it's just crazy to me because he then at that point in which 40 games were sitting in boxes at a. R.A

[43:56] He did not give those buyers a chance to make up the difference and now three years later

[44:02] We're making up the difference but not with the people who deserve those games

[44:05] That's just look I don't think

[44:08] There's so much anecdotal

[44:11] Stuff going on here nobody I haven't seen an income statement in a balance sheet from Dutch pinball

[44:16] Who knows they could still have some cash?

[44:19] Hopefully they do so that they can pay some 10 people to come in and help start with the manufacturing. I mean

[44:25] We don't we don't see everything and then obviously with it being in the Netherlands that you know

[44:31] I don't know what the what the transparency is with regard to reporting of companies and that sort of thing

[44:36] So I wouldn't necessarily say that the two million dollars is gone

[44:40] And you also have a shit ton of parts. I mean there's money in that too

[44:45] Right, I mean yeah, I mean I think there's more money in parts than in games

[44:48] I mean all the 80 people who own games are all gonna want to buy

[44:53] You know replacement parts and how much is a bowling alley worth and how much is a rug mechanism worth to people

[44:59] I bet they're gonna charge a pretty penny

[45:02] When coin taker sells those parts second, you know to people who bought these games look Josh. I get it

[45:08] I get it

[45:10] Do you feel relieved that you're out of this drama?

[45:14] Absolutely

[45:15] I also feel relieved that there wasn't a new press release during my sale that could have impacted the resale

[45:22] I also feel relieved that there was some guy that listed it for 45k

[45:26] So a lot of the hate that was probably you know going to be coming my way went his way

[45:32] And when I list my game for 25 and he's at 45 my gosh my game looks like a bargain

[45:38] Right now 45 is just ludicrous right what do you think of that price 45 is like I love this game

[45:44] I'm never giving it up price now everybody has a price

[45:49] Yeah, that guy just wanted attention. He I think you just wanted people to know he had it and I think if somebody offered him 45k

[45:55] He would have sold it and yeah of course who him any would it but

[45:59] But you got to be moron act offer 45k especially

[46:02] Yeah, obviously you can get it for for half that price easily

[46:06] Yeah, and you don't do it on pinside where and I think he created like a different profile

[46:10] It's like his first toast. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so at least I listen

[46:15] I take full responsibility for for you know my my my sale

[46:20] I didn't hide behind a fake profile. I listed it on Facebook, you know and

[46:25] And so you know, I was just trying to

[46:29] Obviously take advantage of the timing of all of this and I know that there are people out there that weren't as fortunate to

[46:39] have

[46:41] You know taken advantage of the opportunity and that and that's all it really was to me. I didn't

[46:45] view it as oh, I'm selling somebody else's game

[46:49] I'm not selling somebody else's game

[46:50] I'm paying for a race payroll that they've been floating for the last three years. Yeah, I mean look

[46:57] That's that's one way to look at it. There is a little bit of

[47:01] You know, there's a way to like look at this and justify it

[47:05] But it was a game that was paid for in full by somebody else right. I mean how do you escape that?

[47:11] What is it was it a game that was paid for was it wasn't was it had a yeah?

[47:14] Was it was it was it was it was it was it berries? No

[47:17] Josh hotel rooms that were paid for I mean there's so many different things that money went into Josh before

[47:24] The early achiever plaque was removed on the game that you bought that game specifically was built for somebody

[47:33] And paid for

[47:34] So that's that's why look I'm not blaming you. I'm just I blame Barry. No, I get it. I get it

[47:39] I don't think you're to blame. I don't think coin tickers to blame

[47:42] I don't think any of these new buyers are to blame

[47:44] I think Barry

[47:46] Solly is to blame and he's he's a master manipulator at always shifting the blame or or playing the role of victim

[47:56] Oh, if only we get more money. I can I can make you guys whole well, dude

[48:00] You lied to us for years about how to make this work and and you and you're right Josh

[48:06] He put his ego in front of the the the interest of his consumers and that is when you should go out of business

[48:13] It's not when you should get a second chance. That's my that's my that's my take on this whole thing right

[48:18] I don't disagree with the portion of that right

[48:21] Well, let me issue question because I'm also taking

[48:25] I'm taking some heat about you've seen the the the clear code issues and I think if there's anything that makes a big Lebowski worth a lot of money

[48:32] Is there are no clear code issues on the game because it was made

[48:36] Years ago when which we could still use solvent based clears

[48:41] Have you listened to the show? Am I getting into a broken record territory?

[48:44] But it's it's it's the big no obviously you're having a heat. I mean honestly you're you're having a huge impact because I just heard jack on

[48:52] You know the pinball news podcast and he you know cut his vacation short to kind of

[48:58] address the issue and

[49:00] it is an issue and

[49:02] You know, I've had games from

[49:04] Pretty much every decade and

[49:06] Never experienced the kind of dimpling that I have on my Star Wars

[49:11] Stern game and you know, it's on route. So it definitely takes a beating

[49:15] But I mean to the degree that the that the the dimples are

[49:20] You know manifesting themselves. I mean it's extremely noticeable. This is not something that's just gonna

[49:27] Oh, there's so many dimples now that oh it looks like there's no dimples

[49:31] They never even out. I don't understand where that room is starting

[49:35] Even out. Yeah, this BS and the fact that Steve was like oh this is this has always been an issue in pinball

[49:42] Bullshit those old games they look flawless and they've been paid played 10

[49:47] 20,000 times this is a new issue and I thought it was originally kind of related to the wood being that you know

[49:55] It's both it's deeper wood cheaper wood and water-based clear coats that are softer. It's it's it's a combination of those two

[50:02] Yeah, and you know stuff happens, but you know when you're selling games at the rate that Stern does you know, okay

[50:09] So one or two whatever 10 20 populated playfields. It's not gonna move the needle much for them at all

[50:15] Right can Jersey Jack survive this if their buyers just hit pause and you know

[50:22] Honestly, I

[50:24] You're one of your last podcasts when you were talking about how you know they designed a game for the operators and

[50:31] It's going into people's houses and there's a huge disconnect between

[50:35] What they intended the game to be made for and what it's actually being used for I think that speaks more to

[50:43] Some of the marketing missteps of the Willy Wonka and and honestly the way that I look at the rippling and and the

[50:50] The damage I view that as a great buying opportunity on the secondary market honestly because if it doesn't bother you put a wash or under it

[50:57] You don't see it. It goes away. You get a great deal on a great game and everybody's happy

[51:02] What are you talking about the washers don't solve the problem?

[51:06] They do I had the same issue on TNA. I bought two TNAs the first one no issue and I

[51:11] Rannically the second one that I bought had an issue with the clear

[51:15] and you know I reached out and

[51:18] Got the washers and you know put the washers under it and

[51:22] It looks great and I haven't noticed any further impacts on it. Um, so

[51:27] unless you are a

[51:30] Super

[51:31] meticulous collector

[51:33] I don't really think it's it's going to impact

[51:37] Jersey Jack to the degree that you think right

[51:40] Well, we'll see. We'll see. I mean, we're curious to hear

[51:44] What the solve is and I think that's been the big issue is nobody's even really admitted. There's a problem and and so

[51:51] We still don't have a solve for customers who you know the ones who are having the puddling lift up the clear and take the artwork with it

[52:00] What they're gonna do for those people right are they gonna give them new playfields that are fully populated?

[52:05] We're not gonna do that I the the amount of money that I would cost yeah, but then those people are never gonna buy again

[52:14] Would you would you buy

[52:16] From them again if you bought a brand new $9,000 game and it's it's cracking and taking the clear and the artwork up

[52:25] I would I would certainly be upset about that but at the same time I would see what

[52:32] Type of remedies being offered and what type of support I'm getting and

[52:37] Righty would would would appease you

[52:40] I would like a new play field at cost at the very least, but why should you have to pay for it?

[52:47] Because it's manufacturing things happen you know

[52:50] Sometimes cars are sold that are recalled just you know, I know you like the car analogies

[52:55] I mean things happen in manufacturing you don't pay for it when a car gets recalled you don't pay for any that work

[53:02] That's true. That's true. It's not just that's a big that's a big thing right, but I mean

[53:08] You also have the manufacturer car manufacturers that don't issue recalls because they figure that the lawsuits from all the people's

[53:15] deaths are going to be less than it would be to recall all the cars so I

[53:19] You know, I'd rather than address it than just kind of sweep it under the rug and I do think there are they are going to come out with a fix

[53:28] I actually do think that the problem is

[53:32] Less than is what is being magnified on the forums and whatnot because let's face it the the folks that are gonna be that are being harmed

[53:41] Are going to be the most vocal and people that are satisfied

[53:45] Generally don't come out and say hey, you know, I'm so happy

[53:49] It's only the people that are pissed off that are going to be the most vocal about it. So it's being amplified

[53:54] To such a degree

[53:57] When I think that it's probably not as systemic as a problem as we would all think

[54:02] Yeah, I mean we'll see I mean and you're right. I mean it's it's impossible to know we never we never know how many games are sold

[54:09] We never know when we see problems with games. It's hard to determine the number of them that are affected

[54:16] But when they did the pirates the Caribbean

[54:19] Survey on pin-side it was a large number of games

[54:23] I want to say was somewhere between 40 and 50% of owners

[54:27] We're experiencing issues. So we'll see. I mean this this issue will not go away anytime soon until

[54:34] They announce that they've figured out a better way to make these playfields because

[54:38] It shouldn't be happening Josh. I mean those those posts should not be sinking into the field

[54:42] No, it should not be happening and as soon as you see that I mean you kind of have

[54:47] A duty to hold production and figure out exactly what's going on right and you I mean these are not

[54:55] cheap toys by any means and so yes if I if I purchased one for 10 grand and then started to pull up

[55:02] I would I would be extremely vocal about it and

[55:06] I would be understanding in that you know these are boutique games and things happen and but I would also try to gauge

[55:14] You know the level of support that I'm gonna get going forward and I think that

[55:18] I think that we will see from Jack and stern the commitment to kind of make it right as long as that's there

[55:26] That I don't think that that's gonna impact the sales very much

[55:28] But they do need to figure out a solution whether that's to you know

[55:33] Leave additional cure time or whether to go to you know a different manufacturer of playfields or what have you

[55:40] I definitely think some sort of fixes in order

[55:43] I definitely don't think that they can just continue

[55:46] The way that they're they're going now right well. I've got 2500 collectors that listen to this podcast and I've been telling them

[55:54] To not buy until a solution occurs

[55:58] And I've heard nothing from stern or jersey jack which is it's it's funny to me because they

[56:03] Do try to ignore this podcast, but they know where to get me they know my email is canada pimpaw at gmail.com

[56:10] And it can't be good for business that we are getting on the air waves every week and telling people

[56:15] I just wouldn't buy until I hear what the solution is because none of these games Josh are hard to get again

[56:20] This isn't a situation in which if I hold on my woolly wonky le

[56:23] You know, I won't be able to get one they're making 5,000 of them

[56:27] I think jack is gonna have a tremendously hard time selling those collectors additions with this hanging over it

[56:32] What do you think?

[56:34] Listen if you're paying top dollar for a collector's edition

[56:39] I would think you would expect it to be

[56:42] Perfect in every way. It should be

[56:45] I at that price point

[56:47] Absolutely, absolutely and I do think that they know that too. I mean

[56:52] You know, they're in business to to make money and satisfy customers

[56:56] And I'm sure the margin on those CEs is is is lucrative enough to motivate them to find a solution right

[57:04] So just do you um have you bought any new inboxes besides your libousky flip

[57:08] I bought a new inbox stern a few years ago an arosmith

[57:14] Wow

[57:15] Do you do keep is it all location or is in your house?

[57:18] It was on location for a while and then I actually wound up

[57:21] Trading it for a kiss because uh that was

[57:26] Going to kind of fit the venue a bit better. Okay. How many games on on route do you have?

[57:32] Oh, we've got multiple games mostly in Chicago

[57:37] Okay, so are you is this are you an operator on the side is it what he it's not what you do for a living right? No

[57:42] No, no, no, no, I'm a financial advisor by day and basically the uh

[57:48] The the company takes care of

[57:51] You know right your hobby right the side hustle takes care of the pinball because you know it is very expensive hobby as a financial advisor

[58:00] What what would your advice be to people who are who who are buying these pins like

[58:06] Do you consider pinball to be a good use of your of someone's finances and how much money should someone have in you know

[58:13] Saved up before they spend like nine to 13,000 on a game

[58:17] Well, I mean, uh, obviously it's all subjective, but I would if you were

[58:23] First first let me say this it's not an investment don't view it as an investment because the minute you do that you suck a lot of the enjoyment out of it

[58:31] um, I would say that if you are looking for it as an investment you should probably stick to the earlier ballet Williams games that are you know

[58:40] That don't have a chance of being remade obviously, but you know you should be fully funding your Roth fully

[58:47] Funding your 401k making sure you get your matches and all that and if you've got a kid you should be funding a

[58:53] 529 plan for their college and that sort of thing before you just kind of piss it away on a pinball machine right

[59:00] And I think we we definitely see you know some people have a lot of money in this hobby and some people don't and I think that's what makes pinball great

[59:07] Right, it's it's it's accessible enough to everybody right this isn't like a Ferrari collection or you know

[59:13] It's it's hard to have a car collection and not you know, and that'd be super wealthy, but I think pinball

[59:18] You could definitely have a collection without being a multi-millionaire and years ago if you got into this hobby like 10 years ago

[59:26] Oh my god, you could have a ballet Williams collection for just 20,000 you could have the top titles in your house

[59:31] Oh gosh, I know people that bought you know brand new medieval madness games for 1900 pop. Yeah, I think it was incredible

[59:40] Yeah, it was incredible and but what I think is outrageous is now you mean you've got games like

[59:46] F14 going for you know three grand I mean there's a thousand dollar game or at least it was in my mind and it was for many years

[59:54] The same thing with like

[59:55] You know a lot of those

[59:57] Sea titles that are now literally going for double what they were going for just a few years ago

[01:00:03] I think that speaks volumes to you know a lot of the new people coming into the hobby and not having any

[01:00:09] Reference point as to what these games were actually going for originally right what do you think's making the most magical pins right now?

[01:00:19] Honestly

[01:00:21] You know Jersey Jack games are beautiful. I mean, I really enjoyed

[01:00:25] TNA and a kind of a fresh perspective

[01:00:28] I thought and I also enjoyed helping support that type of initiative. I mean, uh, you know

[01:00:35] In terms of magic

[01:00:38] You know, I probably say you know Jersey Jack has really got you know a lot of passion there and

[01:00:46] You know stern is stern is got some great designers. I mean Keith L. Wynn and you know a lot of these other guys

[01:00:54] They're putting putting out some great products

[01:00:57] But you know they have to mass manufacture whereas opposed to you know Jersey Jack and can take a little bit more time to

[01:01:06] Put in a bit more magic and if you're designing a game to go in somebody's house

[01:01:12] Then you can have a little bit more elaborate mechanisms and that and that sort of thing

[01:01:16] Whereas stern has to focus on operators that just want to be able to plug it in turn it on and earn money

[01:01:24] And they don't want to be bogged down by tech calls. So you know, I think

[01:01:30] There is magic in all of these games

[01:01:33] In that you know the code and the the various titles that resonate with people can can be magical

[01:01:41] But as far as maybe just like you know light shows and mechanisms and that sort of thing

[01:01:46] It's it's probably more uh Jersey Jack. All right. Yeah, I think people would agree that Jack is is aiming higher

[01:01:54] And and we all want to see Jack succeed. I mean that's the people might people might listen to my shows recently and be like well

[01:02:00] You're trying to put Jack into the grave and I'm not I'm trying to

[01:02:05] highlight what I think

[01:02:07] Again is just always seems to boggle me with Jersey Jack is it's like they just don't get their customer base

[01:02:13] Which is when your customer base is a home-use player who's a collector

[01:02:18] You got to make the games as close to perfect as you can and they want games to be deeper

[01:02:23] They want to have more complex mechanisms and and they're fine paying more for that

[01:02:28] That's the thing is and when I see a Jersey Jack game Josh price the same amount as a stern game

[01:02:34] I always just shake my head and like man jack's giving away the farm if he's not pricing his games well above sterns

[01:02:43] I will say that um, you know, you're

[01:02:46] About face on the willy-wanka has been interesting because I remember

[01:02:51] Your

[01:02:53] Delation when you went to the factory and you were

[01:02:56] It was it was really awesome to see. I mean it was like your inner nine-year-old came out and you were like

[01:03:02] Oh my god, this is the world under glass that I've always been talking about and this is you know

[01:03:07] This is gonna change the game and oh my gosh. They've nailed it

[01:03:11] They've hit it out of the park, right and then I and then I think I know the point at which everything got

[01:03:17] Kind of turned around is when you were talking with Joe cats and and basically

[01:03:23] The response was you get what you get you know who the hell says that to a buyer you get what you get

[01:03:30] You're a marketing you know that you have to cater to your market

[01:03:34] And if you tell your market hey, this is what you get and deal with it

[01:03:40] I think that's the wrong attitude. Yeah, absolutely. I mean that you're right. I mean I turned south on the game

[01:03:46] When I started to see the way the code was developing and the movie I love

[01:03:51] Just wasn't coming through in the game the way it should and I still to this day

[01:03:56] Don't understand why they won't answer a very simple question

[01:03:59] And that is do you have the rights to use the movie footage with the audio from the actors sinked up in the game

[01:04:06] And you know a response like what you see is what you get is the last response I want to hear

[01:04:12] What I wanted to hear is we're gonna continue to improve the code of this game to satisfy every willy-wank a fan out there

[01:04:20] He had just said that

[01:04:22] Much different response and we know that you know this code gets polished over the years

[01:04:27] And that's it. I'm out because I don't I don't want to hear in apathetic

[01:04:32] mediocre sort of you know shrug your shoulders response and that just goes to show

[01:04:38] How piss poor

[01:04:40] Some of these companies are when it comes to marketing and getting excitement into their games and a little bit of arrogance

[01:04:46] Maybe mixed with sort of indifference mixed with

[01:04:50] You know hiding the truth from all of us buyers about what kind of assets they have in the game

[01:04:55] And Josh look at stern with with Jurassic Park right they told us right away

[01:04:59] There's not gonna be any movie assets in it. We don't have them

[01:05:02] Here's the game that Ellen design and look look at the difference in response people are like all right

[01:05:06] You told us the truth and we love

[01:05:09] What you did with it and we're not gonna harp on the movie not being there because you told us right away

[01:05:14] It wasn't gonna be there

[01:05:15] Well, it's kind of interesting because

[01:05:17] The way that you talked about you know, they're building this game for location

[01:05:22] But their people are putting it in their house. Well, it's the same thing with regard to the movie assets

[01:05:27] Well, we have all these movie assets, but we're not really gonna use them

[01:05:31] It's like it's like halfway through the process they they change directions

[01:05:36] And it's clearly having an impact at least with stern

[01:05:39] They had an objective they stuck to it. They have some of the best

[01:05:44] Use of the the LCD that I've seen in terms of integrating into the theme and the fact that there's no movie assets is like

[01:05:50] Who cares? That's not what it's about. It's about it's about a journey. It's about telling a story

[01:05:56] And it's about letting literally the best pinball player in history have car blanche with the design

[01:06:05] I mean, that's that's what you want to support right

[01:06:08] Well, right and and these decisions are made at the very beginning of the development of a game and

[01:06:14] Pat Lawler and Joe Katz decided to make Willy Wonka the way they wanted to make it

[01:06:19] And look the reason I was so excited and I'll say this you know jack told me when I was over there

[01:06:24] He said wait you see

[01:06:25] This amazing thing that's gonna happen Chris. He said you're gonna end up on Wonka vision

[01:06:29] And and that that was a thing I was talking about when I was like an eight-year-old

[01:06:34] Gidey about the game was sure

[01:06:36] I thought the way they were gonna do it what was gonna be a magical moment in pinball and be revolutionary like never before in playing pinball

[01:06:44] Has your image been taken and put on to a screen on the play field while you're playing now when you watch the way that happens in the game now

[01:06:51] Oh, it's terrible

[01:06:53] It's like it's no moment. You're not ready for it. It comes out awful and you're like

[01:06:58] What what what what happened? Yeah, exactly. There's no build up. There's no excitement

[01:07:03] There's nothing to say hey call you know call your way for your friend

[01:07:06] They watch I'm about to end up on Wonka vision and they easily could have done it where it's holding the ball for a little bit

[01:07:11] And you're on Wonka vision talking and it's coming and you see yourself talking like you know

[01:07:16] Mike TV does in the movie itself

[01:07:19] It's and that's the thing it's it I just think

[01:07:22] It lacks creativity it lacks imagination the way they did it and it's just not for me

[01:07:27] And I could have sat in a room with them and said hey if we're gonna put this mech in the game

[01:07:32] We got to make this a moment everyone's gonna remember and they completely fumbled it and I'll say it to jack's face

[01:07:38] I'll say it to Joe's face. I'll say it to Pat Lawler's face you guys messed up

[01:07:42] Bringing this movie to life and they did and I'm gonna argue with Larry doctor dr. Frightner

[01:07:47] He's coming on the show to defend willy walk. I can't wait to slaughter him when he comes on the show

[01:07:52] I told him that he's like well, I'm gonna talk to Jack first and find yeah go go talk to Jack all you want

[01:07:57] Nothing is gonna change the fact that they butchered that movie in the code of the game

[01:08:02] It's like they put it in a blender and everything's just happening randomly

[01:08:06] There was definitely some

[01:08:08] lack of direction as far as where they wanted to go and it was just kind of all coming together

[01:08:14] um, you know on the fly and I think that's

[01:08:18] That kind of Pat wanted to make a game for operators now just think about that Josh that is just the dumbest decision to make

[01:08:25] If you're Jersey Jack a bootie company that's making high-end pins for the home buyer

[01:08:30] Well, I agree it completely is missing your target market if you're going to go

[01:08:36] For a different market then you know, you got to you got to go add it in a different capacity than just basically stripping one mech out

[01:08:45] right, you know

[01:08:47] Design a different game for that type of purpose or just stay in your lane and make high-end pins for the

[01:08:55] Collector, right, you know why you can't be all things

[01:08:58] To every market segment because you'll spread yourself too thin and spend a bunch of money that will never come back

[01:09:06] Right

[01:09:07] Well, Josh we are up on the hour way it goes fast, right? Can you just pinball podcast?

[01:09:11] You know whenever I do interviews people

[01:09:14] You look at the clock and you're like wow we've hit an hour Josh

[01:09:17] I really want to thank you for joining the show. I know it's not easy being a big Lebowski flipper and talking about it

[01:09:23] Candidly, but you did so and I thank you for for having the courage to do so. So thank you so much

[01:09:28] Sure, it was my pleasure and you know, I really appreciate you bringing a lot of these issues to light

[01:09:35] For the hobbyist. I mean like I said I would have never even gotten on the list had I not heard it on your show first

[01:09:41] Well, you're welcome. So the cost of that to you for me is a Twippy vote. Do I have your vote?

[01:09:46] well, you you have my Twippy vote

[01:09:50] and

[01:09:51] You guys should you should have a little something there for an evening with drinks with Brenda. I mean

[01:09:57] I appreciate it

[01:09:58] A little finders fee for that Josh gave me that I hope the least I could do. Yeah, no, we appreciate it

[01:10:03] We had omakase last night and it went to a good cause

[01:10:06] So thank you so much for that and all of you out there who donate to canators pinball podcasts

[01:10:10] I do appreciate it. I appreciate everyone who listens so Josh. Thank you so much. We'll get you back on the show

[01:10:16] I this was this is a good debate and well

[01:10:19] I wasn't even a debate, but what I love hearing your opinions about pinball and let's get you back on after deeproot comes out

[01:10:24] I'm gonna do a whole list of what people's response is a deeproot or when it happens in November has that sound

[01:10:30] I think there's a lot of money on the sidelines just waiting

[01:10:34] It is Robert couldn't hit this couldn't be a better time to launch a new pinball company that doesn't have clear code issues

[01:10:41] Absolutely, and he can't be that transparent because he needs some competitive advantage

[01:10:46] I mean you can't you can't let the other competitors know when to gear up their next big title

[01:10:51] And it's gonna be complete blindsided

[01:10:53] I love it

[01:10:54] He's gonna he's gonna walk in like

[01:10:57] Like a nero at the gates of Rome and he's gonna

[01:11:01] Yeah, I love it because he's got that bullish like I want to burn stern down into the ground kind of attitude

[01:11:06] That's that's what we need we need people who are who are stridently

[01:11:11] Trying to showcase how mediocre everything else is and just blow it up. I love it. I love that we have a

[01:11:19] A crazy new company coming out that's gonna try to do that

[01:11:23] So it's exciting and gives us something to look forward to because everyone absolutely

[01:11:27] I mean you got to remember they've got an all-star team and not only do they have an all-star team, but they also have

[01:11:33] The business acumen from other lines of business to know what works and what doesn't and how to pull it off properly

[01:11:41] Yeah, the only thing they don't know how to do is make pinball

[01:11:44] They've never done it before but it's gonna be curious because I love it

[01:11:47] I love it

[01:11:48] There's so much that could go right and there's so much that could go wrong

[01:11:51] But I agree with you they do have the right players on the field

[01:11:56] Be it they might be the players that other companies didn't want they might be like the misfit league

[01:12:00] But I still think they've got the ace in the hole and I still I think it's John pop it Duke

[01:12:05] I think John pop it Duke with the right team around him is is someone I would never want to go against creatively

[01:12:11] Because he just has an ability to do things that other people just can't do because it's the way his brain is wired and you know

[01:12:18] Connect him with engineers and animators and other

[01:12:22] Talented people which Robert has done we expect great things like it's right Josh

[01:12:26] It's gonna be great or it's gonna be disappointing. There's no middle ground with this company

[01:12:30] Well, I think with all the delays you're going to be pleasantly surprised awesome can't wait well, Josh

[01:12:36] Thank you so much. We will talk soon and always a pleasure to have a new guest on canadus pinball podcast

[01:12:42] It's been a pleasure Chris. Thank you. Awesome
