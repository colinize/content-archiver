[00:00] Just like fire, burning up the way, fucking like the world up for just one day.

[00:05] Watch this madness, run a bullshire, no one can be just like me anyway.

[00:11] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:15] Aw, back to back days of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:19] Chris Ward is gonna think this is the new norm.

[00:21] I just gotta give him his $5 worth, everybody.

[00:24] I am on a new mission.

[00:25] And this is gonna be my mission all year, going into the pinball world,

[00:29] because this needs to change.

[00:31] And you know what it is, if you haven't seen my Facebook,

[00:33] my mission now is to end, once and for all,

[00:37] the practice of non-refundable pre-order dollars in pinball.

[00:42] It needs to stop, and I'm tired of it.

[00:46] Because what it's doing to this hobby is total bogus.

[00:49] It is removing all of us as customers.

[00:53] It's removing any power we have to keep these companies accountable

[00:58] for meeting deadlines, for making quality products.

[01:02] And when you think about it, let's look at the examples of the companies out there

[01:06] that have non-refundable deposits, which means once you order their game,

[01:11] you cannot get your money back.

[01:13] Let's start with the first company that did it recently last year,

[01:17] Deeproot Pinball.

[01:18] Oh, why did Deeproot have to do non-refundable deposits?

[01:21] Everything was fine in their world, according to Bobby Mueller.

[01:24] Then we've got Spooky Pinball, non-refundable.

[01:27] And the reason Chuck gave for non-refundable deposits,

[01:30] remember back in the day, he's like, well, people were changing their orders,

[01:34] and then they were customizing their games, and then they wanted a refund,

[01:38] and we were stuck with this version of Rob Zombie that had powder coated this,

[01:43] and then we had to find a new customer.

[01:45] That's the whole reason why Spooky went to non-refundable.

[01:49] Okay, we're going to talk more about that.

[01:51] Then we've got Haggis Pinball, non-refundable deposit,

[01:54] on a game that was supposed to be in production last July.

[01:58] And I'm going to read you a quote from Damian.

[02:00] You know, let's just start with it right now,

[02:02] because this is why it is so bogus that we are handing these pinball companies money,

[02:08] and then once they have our money, we have absolutely no power

[02:12] to keep them accountable to deadlines, to a schedule,

[02:16] and here's the worst part about it, to quality of product.

[02:21] How are we buying these things before we know if they're even good?

[02:25] Would you even buy a movie ticket as a non-refundable movie ticket?

[02:29] What if you spent $20 on a non-refundable movie ticket,

[02:33] and then the movie sucks?

[02:35] Wouldn't you not buy a movie ticket?

[02:37] And the fact that the pinball community is doing this, and again, it's our fault.

[02:42] Why are we sending these companies money, and then we can't get our money back?

[02:46] Like, we're sending them money before we've even seen anything.

[02:50] Hello, spooky pinball with Ultraman and Halloween.

[02:53] We sent them money before seeing any gameplay,

[02:57] any LCD screen footage, any code, anything.

[03:01] Absolutely nothing, and here's $2,000, and I can never get it back.

[03:06] We're going to talk a lot more about that.

[03:07] Let me read you a quote from Damian, who took non-refundable deposits.

[03:11] Here it goes, ready?

[03:12] Being in Australia also meant that I didn't have easy access to other pinball manufacturing suppliers,

[03:19] so I needed to become self-sufficient as much as possible.

[03:22] With a reduced reliance on external suppliers, I can make decisions and affect manufacturing outcomes

[03:30] very quickly to implement efficiencies in both time and money.

[03:35] Let me repeat that.

[03:36] They're going to be efficient with both time and money.

[03:40] People, nine months delayed.

[03:43] So where are those efficiencies?

[03:45] So we have not seen any of those efficiencies at all,

[03:48] and remember, this is the part that kills me.

[03:51] There was a moment when Damian knew that those games were not going to be on the line in July,

[03:56] and he took your money.

[03:58] Why?

[03:59] Let's just ask these questions.

[04:00] Why did Damian take your money non-refundable?

[04:03] Why does spooky pinball need your money non-refundable?

[04:07] I mean, go watch the documentary on spooky, right?

[04:09] How much rent are they paying?

[04:11] They've been given so much, so much by Benton, Wisconsin,

[04:16] so much by the pinball community.

[04:18] Aren't we at the point now where they don't need non-refundable dollars to survive?

[04:22] It's not like they have a hard time finding customers.

[04:25] They can sell games out in one day.

[04:27] But why are they non-refundable deposits?

[04:30] Why did Damian say they're non-refundable?

[04:32] You're telling me none of that money for fathom, none of that money.

[04:36] Went to building these Celts machines over the last eight months?

[04:39] See, we don't know, but you have absolutely no protection.

[04:44] See, I go back to an Andrew Highway scenario.

[04:47] Can you imagine if Andrew Highway's games were non-refundable?

[04:51] The reason why highway pinball went under is because they were refundable deposits.

[04:58] Now, it took people forever to get their money back from Andrew,

[05:01] but he did not have a non-refundable policy.

[05:05] And as much of a crook as he was, the reason why he didn't is he knew back then the climate was different.

[05:13] If he told people, if you give me your money, you can't get it back,

[05:17] people probably wouldn't have given them their money.

[05:21] So the question now becomes, why are we trusting everybody to figure it out?

[05:26] Now, look, I think spooky pinball will absolutely deliver the games.

[05:30] The issue I have with spooky pinball's non-refundable deposit is not whether or not you're going to get your game.

[05:36] Here's my big issue with spooky pinball.

[05:38] I think non-refundable deposits now with spooky means that they're not being held accountable for making a great game.

[05:46] That they're not going to show us the quality of the game before they lock our money in.

[05:51] And there's an extreme danger in that, and we're seeing it right now.

[05:54] Let's look at right now what's happening.

[05:56] You gave money for Ultraman in Halloween.

[05:59] They did not show you gameplay.

[06:01] They did not show you animations.

[06:03] They did not show you anything.

[06:05] And now that a lot of people have seen what those games are and seen like the shot geometry and the in-lane feeders and the animations in Halloween,

[06:15] which have no business being on a pinball machine that costs this much money,

[06:19] now that people are seeing this, a lot of people want out.

[06:23] And here's the thing.

[06:24] Here's the thing.

[06:25] You can't get out.

[06:26] You can't get any of your money back.

[06:28] And the bad part is this.

[06:30] You could go buy Halloween in Ultraman today if you did not pre-order your game and save yourself at least $1,000.

[06:38] And you could get $1,000 off a new in-box price.

[06:42] But spooky pinball doesn't have to make these games great.

[06:44] Why?

[06:45] Why do they have to make these games great now?

[06:47] Because they've already locked in all the money.

[06:49] Remember, these are non-refundable deposits.

[06:52] So if you don't want the game, you're going to lose your thousand or two thousand dollars.

[06:56] And I fundamentally believe this.

[06:58] I think this setup that spooky has only favors spooky pinball.

[07:02] Think about it.

[07:03] Who else does this favor?

[07:05] It doesn't help out the distributors who have customers now that might not want the game after seeing it,

[07:11] and they want to roll their money onto another game.

[07:13] It doesn't help them out.

[07:15] The distributors and dealers are screwed.

[07:17] The customer is screwed.

[07:18] The only people this benefits is the manufacturer.

[07:22] And why, as customers, are we doing this?

[07:26] Why are we removing our own protection, our own leverage to make sure these companies deliver

[07:32] the highest quality products for the money?

[07:35] We've absolutely told spooky pinball, you get an A plus on the test before you take it.

[07:41] And now that we're seeing their test results, and now that we're seeing the games,

[07:46] do all of you want to stay in on it wholeheartedly?

[07:48] And can you imagine what would happen if spooky pinball tomorrow said,

[07:53] we're going to offer refunds on these games?

[07:55] I think they would be shocked at the amount of people that would say,

[07:59] you know what, just give me my money back.

[08:00] I'm going to wait.

[08:01] I'm going to wait to see if these games get good a year from now.

[08:03] I'm going to go buy a Rush.

[08:05] I'm going to go buy a Godzilla.

[08:07] And they should be shocked.

[08:09] And they should learn a lesson, but they're never going to have to learn a lesson now,

[08:13] because we gave them a passing grade.

[08:15] We handed them a diploma.

[08:16] We gave 1,750 non-refundable deposits.

[08:20] Chuck put over $3 million in the bank in one day

[08:25] before any of us saw if these games were any good.

[08:28] And that's the kind of interaction we want to have with these pinball manufacturers.

[08:32] Let's look at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:33] They're also a company with non-refundable deposits.

[08:37] So if you order a Guns N' Roses, and you're super excited for this pin,

[08:42] and you put your money down, you can't get your money back.

[08:45] And then you go on pin side, and you see that all these play fields are having issues.

[08:49] Spotlights are breaking.

[08:51] And then you might not want it.

[08:52] That's the other side of it too.

[08:54] What if there's quality defects in a game, and you have a non-refundable deposit?

[08:58] There's nothing you can do.

[09:00] Why are we doing this?

[09:02] And do you think Jersey Jack Pinball needs the money?

[09:05] They are backed by a family that has billions of dollars.

[09:09] So why do they need that money?

[09:11] It's unbelievable that we are guaranteeing these companies orders before they can show us

[09:18] that the games are great, the quality is there, and when it comes to Haggis,

[09:23] that they can even build the damn things when they promised.

[09:26] So this is my new mission in Pinball.

[09:28] I want this practice to stop.

[09:31] And the easiest thing to do to stop this practice is for each and every one of you,

[09:36] and everyone in this community, to stop doing it.

[09:39] We have all of the power.

[09:41] We can decide not to hand over our money when it's a non-refundable order.

[09:46] And I think each and every one of us moving forward should do this.

[09:50] But I also think we should be more vocal and outspoken and tell these Pinball companies,

[09:55] we're not doing this crap anymore.

[09:57] We're not doing this.

[09:58] I'm not giving you $2,000.

[10:00] And then you go hire an animator for Halloween,

[10:03] whose stuff has no business being on a $10,000 Pinball machine.

[10:07] I'm not doing it.

[10:08] If you're going to get lazy and you're going to let the talented people at your company walk,

[10:12] and you're not going to show me gameplay,

[10:14] and you're not going to let me know if the game is any good,

[10:16] and then you're going to hold my money without giving me any chance to get it back,

[10:19] you did not live up to your end of the bargain.

[10:22] You have taken your company backwards, Spooky,

[10:24] and now you want people to lock their money in.

[10:26] I bet it feels great putting all that money in your checking account,

[10:30] but it's not fair.

[10:31] It's not fair.

[10:32] You're not living up to your end of the bargain.

[10:34] It's not fair if Jersey Jack Pinball doesn't come out and tell us if they've even solved

[10:39] the playfield issue, yet all of the orders are locked in in a non-refundable fashion.

[10:45] And think about it like this.

[10:46] Here's the ultimate test of why this is a stupid practice.

[10:49] The world's number one pinball company that has more volume than all these other companies combined,

[10:54] that releases four games a year, that has the most mouths to feed,

[10:58] that has the most at stake, that has the highest rent and overhead,

[11:02] the world's number one pinball company, Stern Pinball, doesn't do this crap.

[11:07] They don't need to do this crap.

[11:09] They don't play this game with their customers.

[11:11] This happens nowhere else in the world.

[11:14] Can you name me one other product?

[11:16] And I mean this, one other product,

[11:18] where your order is non-refundable before even seeing what the thing is.

[11:23] Non-refundable, it doesn't happen anywhere else and it needs to stop in pinball.

[11:29] And the reason why I'm so animated right now and I'm so heated

[11:32] is I'm seeing these companies take advantage of customers.

[11:36] They are.

[11:36] And they're not going to be held accountable because they don't have to be held accountable.

[11:41] I am shocked.

[11:42] I am shocked how little uproar there is over at Haggis Pinball

[11:47] by the community, by the buyers.

[11:49] What the hell?

[11:50] Like you can go nine months and miss every deadline and he just missed January, right?

[11:55] He just missed January.

[11:57] And I know Damien's a good guy, but what has he done?

[11:59] Has he come out and officially said anything?

[12:02] He said nothing.

[12:04] An email correspondence with people, he's telling you, oh, we're heads down.

[12:07] We're heads down.

[12:07] I've heard all this before.

[12:09] Why did you say January in December, at the beginning of December,

[12:13] when you said fathoms would be in production in January,

[12:17] what did you have in front of you that made you say that?

[12:21] And I just played the sound clip on my last show, but this is my point.

[12:25] What the hell?

[12:26] What the hell is spooky?

[12:28] Like you think this code is good enough?

[12:30] You think this is what people deserve for this much money?

[12:34] No.

[12:34] Go hire talented designers.

[12:37] We need to stop this and we can stop it.

[12:39] Like Spooky Pinball is not going to go hire talented designers and talented coders and

[12:44] talented animators until they learn a lesson with these two games.

[12:48] And that is that they're not good enough.

[12:50] And I know there's just those cheerleaders on pin side that just say,

[12:53] well, we should be supporting pinball companies and this is how you do it.

[12:56] No, it's not.

[12:57] These companies all know one simple truth.

[13:01] If you make a great game and you manufacture a great game,

[13:06] people will buy it without you having to ask them for a non-refundable deposit.

[13:12] Isn't it just that simple?

[13:14] If you make a great game and you manufacture it when you say you are going to manufacture it

[13:19] and it's a quality product, you are going to have no problem finding customers.

[13:24] But when you take money early and you make promises you don't keep

[13:28] or your games aren't living up to the expectations of the people who bought them,

[13:33] then you're in trouble.

[13:34] When you have play fields that are falling apart and you don't fix the problem,

[13:38] then you're in trouble.

[13:39] And the companies that are doing non-refundable deposits,

[13:43] they're doing it for one simple reason, because they're insecure, because they're afraid.

[13:49] That is what drives this whole thing.

[13:51] They are afraid that if people don't like what they make,

[13:55] or they're afraid if they can't figure out their manufacturing,

[13:58] or they're afraid if there's a run on the bank that it's going to severely hurt their company.

[14:04] And guess what?

[14:05] The only reason there would ever be a run on the bank,

[14:09] the only reason customers would ever say,

[14:11] give me my money back is if you did not deliver to them a quality product,

[14:17] what you promised, something worth their money.

[14:20] That's the only reason.

[14:22] If Stern Damaro said we will give everyone their money back who pre-ordered Godzilla,

[14:26] nobody would.

[14:27] We'll give everyone their money back who pre-ordered Rush, nobody would.

[14:31] Nobody would.

[14:32] In fact, people would say I'll spend more money to get a spot.

[14:35] If you, you know, people would be like,

[14:36] I'll spend $2,000 more than that guy if I could have his Ellie spot.

[14:40] And so this is my mission in 2022 to end non-refundable pre-order BS.

[14:47] It is total BS.

[14:48] If these companies need to raise money, then go to investors,

[14:52] go to the bank, go somewhere else,

[14:54] but don't come to us as customers and have us invest in your mediocrity,

[14:59] or your mis-deadlines, or your poor quality.

[15:02] We're not doing it anymore.

[15:04] And I hope all of you get on board.

[15:06] And this is something that we need to shift.

[15:08] We need to change this.

[15:09] This is, this is just unbelievable to me

[15:12] that you could take someone's money and then go 10 months

[15:15] and then stop giving them updates.

[15:17] And we're seeing it in 2022.

[15:20] I mean, this is like Kevin Coolick, Andrew Highway behavior all over again.

[15:24] And it doesn't matter how nice you are.

[15:26] And it doesn't matter if they respond to personal emails.

[15:29] No, a company that gives you a deadline.

[15:33] I mean, when a company is saying that they can make decisions

[15:36] and affect manufacturing outcomes very quickly

[15:39] to implement efficiencies in both time and money.

[15:43] Damian, where are you implementing efficiencies

[15:45] that are impacting both time and money?

[15:48] You're losing money and you're inefficient.

[15:50] You're headed in the wrong direction.

[15:52] Jersey Jack Pinball, are you going to do nonrefundable deposits

[15:55] on the next game before we see if you fix the playfields?

[15:58] They are absolutely going to do it.

[16:00] And then we're all going to have to go in

[16:01] and not have any protection if the playfields start falling apart again.

[16:05] And Spooky Pinball, forget it.

[16:06] I mean, I think people are done.

[16:08] I really do.

[16:09] I think people are done with this whole like small Lutubutik company.

[16:13] I mean, some people's games now are catching on fire.

[16:15] Go look at it.

[16:16] Go look at it.

[16:17] And look, I'm not saying that all Spooky games are going to have these issues.

[16:19] It's just a few isolated incidents.

[16:21] But it doesn't matter if it's a fire or a bad right flipper coil.

[16:26] It doesn't matter.

[16:27] You should be able after you see the game and after you hear feedback,

[16:31] if you don't want it, you should be able to get your money back.

[16:35] The excuse.

[16:36] Think about Chuck's like reason.

[16:38] We can't give refunds because people are personalizing their orders.

[16:41] All right, Chuck.

[16:42] How about you do this?

[16:43] Do what Stern does, Chuck.

[16:45] Remove the personalization from the games.

[16:48] If you do that, then every game has to be great.

[16:51] Make your collector's edition just one way to order it.

[16:54] That way, you know, throw the butter in, throw everything into it.

[16:58] That way, you can't have this excuse that I can't give you a refund

[17:02] because then I can't find a buyer that wants his game arranged this way.

[17:06] It's such an excuse.

[17:07] It's not going to work anymore.

[17:09] I think everyone's seeing through it.

[17:10] And I think it's the one thing.

[17:12] It's the one thing hanging over this hobby.

[17:14] Am I right or am I wrong?

[17:15] I know I'm probably clipping all over this podcast.

[17:18] I usually don't scream like this into the mic.

[17:20] It's early in the morning.

[17:21] Sleep deprived, Canada.

[17:23] Just trying to do a Canada Spinball podcast for you two days in a row.

[17:26] Trying to give Chris Ward his money's worth.

[17:28] The Pinball world is crazy these days.

[17:31] It's crazy these days.

[17:32] I'm seeing the prices.

[17:34] They're absolutely bonkers.

[17:36] It's going to come back down to reality.

[17:38] It absolutely is.

[17:39] It's fun to watch it.

[17:40] It's fun to watch all you guys buying like Stranger Things LEs for like 17.5.

[17:45] Good luck selling that game one day.

[17:47] See, what's happening right now is this.

[17:49] There are not enough new games coming out that people want.

[17:52] There's no inventory.

[17:54] So nobody's moving games out of their collections to make room for the new hotness.

[17:59] Right?

[18:00] And let's face it.

[18:01] Like nobody's really like shifting games out to put Halloween or Ultraman in.

[18:05] Nobody's doing that for Legends of Vahala.

[18:07] You've got this period where there's like not a lot of new stuff everybody wants.

[18:12] So they're holding onto their games and then you've got a lot of new people in the hobby.

[18:15] Now the new people in the hobby, when they want something,

[18:18] they're screwed because there's no inventory with the distributors.

[18:21] So if those people want to go get a Mando LE or Stranger Things LE,

[18:25] they have to pay some stupid price for one to extract it from a guy

[18:29] who doesn't really need to move it on because there's nothing he needs to move in.

[18:33] But once the supply gets better, once new games start flooding the market

[18:38] and Stern starts making all these pros and premiums again,

[18:41] all these people who pay over right now are going to be like holding the bag.

[18:45] They're going to be paying over like double for these games.

[18:48] It's going to be funny to watch when dudes start trying to list these premiums again

[18:51] for like over 10 grand.

[18:53] Nobody's biting guys.

[18:54] Nobody's going to bite.

[18:55] But right now it's what you have to do to get the product.

[18:59] If you want a pro, you might be offering $9,000 for certain pros

[19:03] that they're not manufacturing right now.

[19:05] And that's just the way it is.

[19:07] I love being on the sidelines.

[19:09] I love just sort of watching this from a distance.

[19:11] It's nothing I would do.

[19:13] I just don't think the experience of pinball is a $17,000 experience.

[19:17] But for some of you out there, maybe it is.

[19:19] Everybody, let me know your thoughts on this whole pre-order thing.

[19:22] I'm really heated about it.

[19:24] And I really want to hold these companies accountable.

[19:26] And I think together we can put enough pressure on them not to do it.

[19:30] And remember, we have the power.

[19:32] It's all in our court.

[19:34] If we just close our wallets and say, I'm not ordering this game,

[19:37] if it's non-refundable, they're going to have to change their ways.

[19:41] Okay.

[19:42] Unfortunately, there's just so many people out there that don't care

[19:45] and they'll just buy this stuff.

[19:46] And this cycle will just continue over and over again.

[19:49] Everybody have a great weekend.

[19:52] Saturday morning, spectacular is tomorrow.

[19:54] I'll see you then.

[19:56] Bye.

[20:05] Love you, babe.

[20:06] She's going to be okay, right?
