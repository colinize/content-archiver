[00:00] Empty out your pockets, I need all that.

[00:02] I get the millions and I fall back.

[00:04] They'd be chameleons.

[00:06] They'll change for some change.

[00:07] Days ain't the same.

[00:08] They'd be switching for the fame.

[00:10] Louis Vuitton, I'm in my bag.

[00:12] Get how my memory's gone.

[00:14] I've been hurting.

[00:15] Rock like electric guitars.

[00:17] I be raging.

[00:22] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] It is Wednesday, September 10th.

[00:28] It's my mama's birthday.

[00:30] And I'm here to tell you right now, first and foremost,

[00:34] thank you to Pete Rosen for upping his membership

[00:37] from 50 a month to $100 a month.

[00:43] Pete, this show and every show after it is dedicated to you.

[00:48] So Star Wars, where is it?

[00:51] Has Stern fumbled the launch?

[00:53] Everyone's complaining.

[00:54] Everybody's moaning.

[00:56] And I'm here to tell you right now,

[00:58] Stern Pinball has done nothing wrong.

[01:03] They didn't miss a release date.

[01:06] This hobby is filled with the biggest bunch of babies

[01:11] I've ever seen.

[01:13] How can people say that the game is delayed?

[01:17] They didn't even give you a reveal date.

[01:20] How can you be delayed if you don't even have a date

[01:24] by which you promised something?

[01:27] And I know they put out a teaser.

[01:29] So what?

[01:30] That's what a teaser's meant to do.

[01:32] And I know they're going to do things a little bit differently.

[01:35] They had some dealers over there yesterday under NDA.

[01:40] They saw the game.

[01:42] I am shocked, by the way, just shocked

[01:45] that nobody like told anybody what's in the game,

[01:49] even if you saw it.

[01:50] Because I know for a fact that the dealers played the game

[01:54] and they also were shown all of the Stern marketing materials.

[01:59] And zero, there's zero information on Pinside or anywhere else

[02:06] where someone said, hey, it's got this is the main Mac, the ATST or the ATAT.

[02:13] Where is it?

[02:14] Where's the info?

[02:15] Is it a fan layout?

[02:17] What does the artwork look like?

[02:18] Nothing, nothing.

[02:21] And so today's going to be the real challenge

[02:24] because they're going to usher in the pinball media.

[02:28] Bring in the shields, baby.

[02:30] Open the doors.

[02:32] Bring in the shields.

[02:33] These suckers paid their own travel to come see our game

[02:38] so that we can turn them into a Salesforce first Stern

[02:42] on their own dime.

[02:43] Bring them in.

[02:44] Bring in Don.

[02:45] Bring in Colin.

[02:46] Bring in the shields.

[02:47] Hell, Ralph might even make it.

[02:49] Bring them all in.

[02:50] Show them the game under NDA.

[02:54] So this is going to be when it really gets interesting

[02:58] because you're going to show these guys who live and breathe

[03:02] to have exclusive info about pinball machines

[03:05] and are they going to be able to keep everything quiet?

[03:09] They're not.

[03:10] They're absolutely not.

[03:12] So I fully expect today we're not going to get videos.

[03:16] We're not going to get images.

[03:19] I think we're going to get descriptions of what's in the game.

[03:23] Now, I actually don't think that's a bad idea.

[03:27] I think showing media the game first under NDA is a good idea.

[03:32] It's how you normally would do it.

[03:34] I always felt it was silly that media would go down there

[03:38] after the game was already revealed.

[03:40] Like they're getting nothing.

[03:42] Now, here's the thing, everybody.

[03:44] We got people watching on Facebook right now.

[03:46] I'm going to let you guys go a few more minutes.

[03:50] Then I'm going to pull the plug.

[03:51] And if you want the world's most entertaining, dynamic,

[03:56] insecure, sociopathic pinball podcaster on the planet,

[04:01] you know where to go.

[04:02] Go to Patreon.

[04:04] Sign up today.

[04:05] There are literally, if you sign up today, 500 episodes you unlock.

[04:11] We're now doing fun Patreon lives exclusive for the club members.

[04:16] And we've got the greatest chat in all of pinball.

[04:20] It's impossible to follow.

[04:22] You wake up every morning, though, and it gives you a new reason

[04:25] to smile on planet Earth.

[04:27] We've got fans in Australia, Europe, US, Canada, South America.

[04:33] They're coming from all over to hear what this dude in Rowan,

[04:36] Connecticut has to say about the hobby.

[04:38] So here's the thing, everybody.

[04:40] Stern did not botch this launch.

[04:43] And I'm going to say something now that might be a little bit upsetting.

[04:47] It doesn't matter.

[04:48] It's freaking Star Wars.

[04:50] I think somewhere in all of this, we've become a little bit lost.

[04:55] Thinking that layout matters more than theme.

[04:58] We've been a little bit lost.

[05:00] Thinking that like mechs matter more than theme.

[05:03] We've been a little bit lost.

[05:04] Thinking that artwork matters more than theme.

[05:07] The number one reason.

[05:10] People will buy a pinball machine is theme and theme alone.

[05:16] The themes over the last four years have predominantly sucked.

[05:23] And so now you've got a very hungry pinball community

[05:28] that is starving for a great theme.

[05:32] And I don't subscribe to the people that say that there is Star Wars fatigue.

[05:38] There might be to the Disney stuff, but there is nobody tired of the original trilogy.

[05:45] You know what I'm saying?

[05:46] Like you might not like Chinese democracy, but there is not a Guns N' Roses fan out there

[05:52] that now all of a sudden doesn't like appetite for destruction.

[05:57] It is the OG, baby.

[05:59] And episodes four through six have not, have not like aged poorly.

[06:05] We're now not over it.

[06:07] We want it.

[06:08] We want it in pinball form.

[06:10] We want it served up to us in a pinball game that's enjoyable.

[06:14] The Steve Ritchie game is not that.

[06:16] The Steve Ritchie game, I've already heard from people over at Stern.

[06:19] They said, Chris, Canada, like, let me just tell you right now,

[06:22] this is much better than the Steve Ritchie game.

[06:25] And I think what they mean by that is that this game is going to serve us up.

[06:30] The Star Wars movies we loved in a much better fashion.

[06:34] Okay, so for those of you on Facebook right now, I'm pulling the plug.

[06:39] I'm pulling the plug and you got to go over to Canada's pinball podcast on Patreon.

[06:44] Look at me.

[06:45] Look at me trying to sell my own goods.

[06:47] If you're good at anything in life, never do it for free.

[06:52] And for those of you who are watching right now, who still refuse to sign up and subscribe,

[06:58] and yet you're losing $3,000 on every Stern LE, it's time to get on board, baby.

[07:04] Let's get back to our goal of getting to 800 subscribers.

[07:08] Peace out, Facebook.

[07:10] All right, this gives me so much pleasure to end the broadcast right now.

[07:13] You can kind of hear it.

[07:15] Now look, I'm going to do this right now.

[07:16] I'm going to go live again, but only because I want to see myself, baby.

[07:21] I love seeing the way I articulate this show.

[07:25] Okay, so we're back.

[07:26] Okay, so here's the thing.

[07:27] Here's the thing.

[07:28] There is not a fumbled launch.

[07:31] And this is still Star Wars.

[07:32] And I know, I know half of us are rooting for this thing just to fail because we want

[07:38] to point at Stern and be like, hey, like you don't understand what we want.

[07:43] You're ripping us off.

[07:44] Your new platform is not going to be as special as like JJPs.

[07:49] And it's only going to be a halfway into the spike three world.

[07:52] Look, I'm just here to say on this Wednesday, knowing we're one day away from Star Wars,

[07:58] knowing they made us wait a couple of days.

[08:01] I think all of us just need to zoom out a little bit, put all of our little pinball

[08:06] panties back in the drawer, stop being a baby about it.

[08:10] They didn't mess up yet.

[08:12] Okay, they didn't mess up yet.

[08:14] Now, I think regardless, I've been saying this regardless of if this game is the next

[08:21] like Godzilla, it's not going to shoot like an Elwyn.

[08:25] It's not going to shoot like a Jack Danger pin.

[08:28] It's a John Borg game.

[08:30] But John Borg last time I checked made some damn good games.

[08:36] Do people not love Tron?

[08:38] Do people not love the walking dead?

[08:41] Do people not love?

[08:43] Okay, where's it at rush?

[08:45] Right, dude.

[08:46] And he's made a lot of games.

[08:47] I only should pull up the John Borg catalog right now because, you know, I think this guy

[08:52] is going to make a game that has mass appeal.

[08:56] And I mean that.

[08:56] I think it's going to be an inviting game for everybody.

[08:59] But I also do believe that this game is not going to be special.

[09:05] And I think those two things can again coexist.

[09:09] I think it's going to be a game that when we see it, we're absolutely probably it's going

[09:15] to like exceed our expectations because I do think after all of what Stern's done recently,

[09:22] after this like sort of long drawn out launch, I do think the expectations are low.

[09:30] I do think the excitement is low.

[09:32] I do think the FOMO is non-existent.

[09:36] I agree with all of that.

[09:37] I'm not saying any of you are wrong.

[09:39] There is like no energy this week.

[09:42] There is like nothing going into this launch that feels exciting.

[09:46] And I'm reading the silence.

[09:48] I'm like, it almost feels like Stern knows they don't have a hit.

[09:52] And they're treating it like that or the alternative could be they just know it's freaking Star Wars.

[09:58] And it's going to sell 8000 units easily.

[10:01] And the latter is probably true.

[10:04] And I think when this game comes out, at least we're going to get a new artist.

[10:09] Like finally a new art package on a Stern machine.

[10:14] Something different.

[10:15] That's good.

[10:17] Too many Sterns are looking too similar.

[10:20] Everybody look, I'm just going to be completely honest right now.

[10:24] The main reason that King Kong did not sell well is that it didn't look good.

[10:30] It didn't look good.

[10:32] And it wasn't based on King Kong in the right way.

[10:35] If King Kong looked like the classic Kong movie posters and had footage from the classic Kong films,

[10:44] it would have sold three times more units.

[10:48] And it would have connected with people a hundred times more.

[10:52] When I look at that game, when I still look at that game,

[10:55] it looks like a King Kong child's book I would buy for Killian.

[11:00] It doesn't look like a $13,000 sort of this is the king of the monsters.

[11:06] We made Godzilla to reflect the Godzilla people know.

[11:10] And I would even argue on that game, the main reason why I never really loved the Godzilla LEDs or like,

[11:18] I just never loved the way Godzilla looked.

[11:21] I still don't think that's the iconic Godzilla way to visualize it.

[11:27] And again, I love Zambietti, but I just don't think you can Zambietti everything.

[11:33] There's a time and a place.

[11:34] There's a time when certain styles allow for Yeti to do his magic.

[11:39] And then there's a time where that's just not how we visualize and remember Godzilla.

[11:47] And I think there's a big difference there.

[11:49] And that's why I think Stern losing Franchi was a huge mistake by them.

[11:54] And again, they could have made amends.

[11:56] And I think when we see spooky pinballs, Beetlejuice,

[12:00] and you see Beetlejuice exactly as you remember it, but only better.

[12:06] That's what Franchi can do that like Yeti can't do is he can take the source material

[12:13] and enhance it in a way that is just what you want.

[12:17] That's what nostalgia is all about.

[12:20] I don't want you to take the thing I'm nostalgic for and alter it.

[12:26] You know, I want you to serve it back to me.

[12:29] And that's why I think this Star Wars game, when we see footage from the films,

[12:35] when we see that theme song and that scrolling,

[12:40] does that even the Star Wars theme?

[12:47] When that hits, when that hits and you see the scrolling Star Wars story,

[12:53] and it's going to be like, it's going to say like episode, whatever, like fall of the empire.

[12:58] And it's going to invite us in to like what the journey is.

[13:02] And I'm assuming the storyline is going to be something you are your rebel.

[13:08] And you're trying to take down the empire.

[13:11] And maybe you assume the roles of the different characters from those moments.

[13:15] So, you know, maybe in one scene, you're Han Solo and another, you're Luke Skywalker.

[13:20] So I just think they're going to do it right.

[13:22] I think Ray Day is going to arrange it right.

[13:25] And I think where this game is going to win, it's not going to be on layout.

[13:29] It's not going to be on mechs.

[13:32] I think where Star Wars is going to win is in the code, the sound,

[13:37] and the artwork.

[13:39] And I think the other stuff is going to be fine.

[13:41] It's going to be nothing to write home about.

[13:43] But I think it's going to be just enough to make each and every one of us that's been starving

[13:49] for a theme we really want.

[13:51] I think it's going to make you guys open up your wallets.

[13:54] I really do.

[13:55] And I'm just going to call it right now.

[13:57] I'm going back.

[13:58] I'm going back, baby.

[13:59] I'm going to bring it back.

[14:01] I do think the LEDs are going to be a day one sell out.

[14:04] And maybe not 18,000 a pop.

[14:08] But I would say it's going to be sold out.

[14:12] And I think we're going to see people spending 15 to get one, maybe not 18.

[14:18] And look, I'm also shocked.

[14:20] I went on to pin side.

[14:21] I am shocked.

[14:23] Nobody, nobody has a Star Wars LE for sale.

[14:28] I thought more people would have been panicking and selling those games.

[14:33] But what I've been hearing from people and from collectors, if you love Star Wars,

[14:39] a lot of these guys are just excited to put both games side by side.

[14:44] I can't blame them.

[14:46] I mean, if you're a Star Wars fanatic, you might want to have Mandalorian,

[14:50] the Steve Ritchie game, and now this game.

[14:54] The other thing I'm hearing is this.

[14:56] I am hearing like the Walking Dead remastered is next.

[15:00] It's coming out at expo people.

[15:02] I mean, just think about that for a minute.

[15:04] They're going to release Star Wars now.

[15:06] It's not going to be like on the line this week.

[15:09] And so by the time we get the Walking Dead remastered,

[15:13] it's only going to be like a month after Star Wars is out.

[15:16] They did the same thing with X-Men.

[15:18] They absolutely sandbagged all the excitement around X-Men when they brought out Metallica

[15:25] remastered.

[15:26] I was there.

[15:26] I was there.

[15:27] Like nobody cared.

[15:28] Like everybody was running towards the next.

[15:31] I don't think that's going to happen with the Walking Dead.

[15:33] You know, I know they have a coder on it who's helping on the game.

[15:37] It's weird to me because it's like Lyman sheets made a masterpiece.

[15:42] How are you going to like improve that?

[15:44] Like they better be very careful what they do with this game.

[15:49] I don't think they're going to change the Lyman code.

[15:51] I think they're going to add stuff.

[15:53] And I think they're going to add clips.

[15:55] And if we see clips from the Walking Dead in this game, I don't know, man.

[15:59] Sometimes when I walk across and I see a Walking Dead now, it looks dated.

[16:04] It doesn't look like a game.

[16:06] People are going to be dropping 13,000 on, especially Walking Dead.

[16:10] Because remember, back in the day, a Walking Dead LE was $6,000.

[16:16] It was like 6,500.

[16:19] Okay.

[16:19] And it looked like a $6,500 game.

[16:22] So how are you now going to re-release the same game and charge us

[16:29] $13,000 for the LE?

[16:31] And then the rest are going to be premiums.

[16:33] It's going to be like Metallica, only two trims, no pros.

[16:37] I just don't know.

[16:39] I don't know.

[16:39] I don't buy it.

[16:40] Like, you know, the R&D cost wasn't there.

[16:44] Why should we have to pay twice as much?

[16:46] It just leaves a bad taste in everybody's mouth that you used to be able to get it for this.

[16:51] Now it's going to be this.

[16:52] All right.

[16:52] So look, today I was expecting by today to be talking about Star Wars,

[16:57] but I'm just here to tell you, I'm back on the Star Wars hype wagon.

[17:01] I hear everybody complaining.

[17:03] I think a lot of you guys saying you don't care are going to be ordering the game.

[17:08] And then what else is happening in pinball?

[17:11] I don't know, right?

[17:12] Not a lot.

[17:12] Not a lot.

[17:14] I've been hearing some more stuff about Back to the Future.

[17:18] There's been some changes to the game that have been great.

[17:22] I've been hearing, I will say this, this is something that nobody ever wanted to hear.

[17:28] Are you ready?

[17:28] The only way you're ever going to get your hands on Back to the Future,

[17:33] the only way it's ever coming out and the savior of Back to the Future.

[17:37] This is crazy.

[17:37] What do you think about this?

[17:39] And if I told you 10 years ago, this would be the case.

[17:43] The only game that can actually save Dutch pinball and get them to make Back to the Future

[17:50] and keep them alive is no other than Raza.

[17:56] Retroatomic Zombie Adventureland is going to be the savior of Back to the Future

[18:03] because Back to the Future is not done.

[18:07] Dutch pinball will not have made 500 Alice's by the end of the year.

[18:11] And imagine if they did.

[18:12] Like let's just say DP was more efficient and they finished the 500 Alice's in January.

[18:19] Okay, they don't have Back to the Future ready.

[18:22] It's not even close to being ready.

[18:24] And so they're going to need almost another year to finish and get the game on the line.

[18:30] And so what would they have ready to go?

[18:32] Nothing.

[18:33] Nothing.

[18:34] And then what happens?

[18:35] You go out of business because you're burning hundreds of thousands of dollars every month.

[18:42] What do you do with all your employees if no games are going out the door?

[18:45] They really need Raza to be next.

[18:48] And here's what I think is going to happen.

[18:50] I think in the end there will be some refunds on Alice.

[18:54] I don't think a ton.

[18:56] I would assume that about 50 people will probably bail on Alice.

[19:02] And the main reason why I think 50 people are going to bail on Alice

[19:07] and want to get something else is because of Beetlejuice.

[19:11] I think when we see Beetlejuice, I have a feeling Beetlejuice

[19:15] is going to be the most exciting machine we've seen since Ghostbusters.

[19:22] Since Batman.

[19:23] I mean it.

[19:23] I mean over Godzilla.

[19:24] I mean it.

[19:25] I think Beetlejuice as an IP with Francheon artwork and only 999.

[19:33] And you look at everything that's in Evil Dead.

[19:35] Finally, a company putting a lot of mechs back in a game.

[19:40] Finally, a company that makes a game that is absolutely stunning.

[19:45] And you're not going to have to change anything.

[19:48] And I love what Spooky's done.

[19:49] It's like they don't make you need to like mod up your plastic stern with a bunch of extra scopes.

[19:57] We know this thing is going to be stunning.

[19:59] And I just have this feeling.

[20:01] I just have this hunch.

[20:03] You know, I've been reading the room like the people over there,

[20:06] the level of excitement they have around this game.

[20:10] And I think Beetlejuice is going to raise the bar.

[20:14] And I think it's going to raise the bar for everybody else.

[20:17] I mean it.

[20:18] JJP, stern pinball, like nostalgia.

[20:22] Done right.

[20:23] That is huge.

[20:25] And I think Spooky is not only going to do it right on this game.

[20:29] I think they've got two to three more games in the hopper that are going to do the same exact thing.

[20:35] And it's crazy to say this.

[20:37] But the only company with FOMO right now is Spooky Pinball.

[20:42] Nobody else.

[20:43] Nobody else.

[20:44] Now look, I want to congratulate Turner Pinball.

[20:47] They've shipped Merlin's Arcade.

[20:49] Number nine, I'm happy Chris is getting those games out.

[20:53] You know, people have been lifting the Turner playfields up.

[20:56] And I get it.

[20:57] Like Chris's model of manufacturing is absolutely the innovation.

[21:04] Right.

[21:04] That's a much easier way to make games.

[21:08] It's very clean.

[21:09] There's no switches in the game.

[21:12] It's absolutely incredible how clean it looks.

[21:15] The problem with Turner is the same problem with Multimorphic.

[21:20] It's the same problem.

[21:21] If you innovate and you do stuff that is like evolving pinball,

[21:27] none of it matters if the game isn't great.

[21:31] Like I don't care if a meal was cooked in a brand new kind of oven.

[21:37] If the meal I'm getting over a barbecue is better.

[21:40] You know what I'm saying?

[21:41] And that's what it comes down to.

[21:43] And that's the same issue I have with the Star Wars launch.

[21:46] None of this matters if the game excites us.

[21:49] Like the fumbledness of this launch week and the NDAs and waiting for stuff.

[21:54] None of it matters.

[21:56] In the end, the game itself needs to create a poll on you as a pinball fan.

[22:04] And I think Beetlejuice is going to have the biggest poll on everybody.

[22:09] I do.

[22:10] I don't think the Walking Dead on Spike 3 is going to be that.

[22:15] And then I'm hearing again that Keith Elwyn's game is fallout.

[22:20] Talk about not reading the room.

[22:23] If Stern Pinball, I'm going to say this right now.

[22:25] If Stern Pinball makes fallout with Keith Elwyn, that game is going to be dead on arrival.

[22:34] I'm sorry.

[22:36] There is not the nostalgia for fallout within this community.

[22:41] They don't get who buys their product.

[22:45] Every time Stern tries to make a modern IP, they don't know what they're doing.

[22:51] They're actually picking the wrong stuff.

[22:52] If you ask me, fallout, really fallout is where you're going to go.

[22:58] I actually don't even think modern IP is where I would go ever.

[23:02] There is just enough in the 80s and 90s to fill up a portfolio of games that would sell

[23:10] 8,000 units each if you made the Karate Kid, if you made G1 Transformers, if you made G.I. Joe,

[23:20] you would sell more He-Man than fallout.

[23:23] I'm serious.

[23:23] You would sell more Fragile Rock than fallout.

[23:27] I'm here to tell you right now.

[23:28] If we were going to test this, Stern would sell more Fragile Rock Pinball machines than they would

[23:35] of fallout.

[23:36] You can't look at how much money the franchise made because it made that money in the video game

[23:43] world.

[23:44] It's not going to cross over.

[23:46] It's not.

[23:46] It's not going to work.

[23:47] They're going to do it and then they're going to learn another hard lesson.

[23:51] Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sega version of the game.

[23:55] That's what Jersey Jack is making.

[23:57] That is going to run circles around fallout.

[24:00] Sonic will outsell Pokemon.

[24:02] I mean it.

[24:03] Sonic will outsell Pokemon.

[24:06] There are more people in this community that are into Sonic the Hedgehog.

[24:11] You grew up with it.

[24:12] You grew up with a Sega Genesis and you're just going to have such a smile on your face.

[24:17] When you see Sonic doing the loop-de-loops, jumping up and catching the rings,

[24:21] you are not going to feel that way when you see Pokemon.

[24:25] It just doesn't make you feel that way.

[24:28] Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[24:33] I really, really appreciate it.

[24:35] We're going to be back tomorrow absolutely and we're also going to do a live.

[24:40] I'll probably do it on Patreon, maybe Facebook at the same time.

[24:43] My live reaction to Star Wars.

[24:46] Keep a lookout for that.

[24:48] We know the Stern webinar.

[24:50] The date at which they're going to reveal the materials is tomorrow at five o'clock central time.

[24:58] That's like six o'clock my time.

[25:01] That's when Star Wars is going to be revealed to the world.

[25:04] I hope it's earlier because I want it to go into the city and go to my Japanese Jazz Bar tomorrow night.

[25:11] Then I've got a poker match tomorrow night.

[25:14] So we'll see what happens but everybody, it's going to be a really fun 48 hours.

[25:20] Let's see if these content creators can keep it under NDA and not leak what's in the game.

[25:27] Everybody, peace out.

[25:28] Have you ever had somebody try to take your life?

[25:31] Sometimes I ain't safe by myself when I stay up at night.

[25:44] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known.

[25:50] Don't know where it goes but it's home to me and I walk alone.

[25:58] I walk alone, I walk alone.
