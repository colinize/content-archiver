[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] It's the first of the month, May 1st everybody.

[00:21] What do we think is going to happen in the Pinball World in the month of May?

[00:25] That's what we're going to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:29] I'm also going to talk about the fact that I seem to have triggered some of the haggis

[00:34] fanboys coming at Canada, our very own friend of the show, Mr. Kim Mitchell, who has not

[00:39] won.

[00:40] I think he ordered two Fathom Mermaid editions.

[00:43] Kim, I love you brother.

[00:44] We're going to talk about it.

[00:45] We're going to talk about it.

[00:46] And look, I want to hit this head on and I want to do something on this episode.

[00:50] I want to do a challenge to every single boutique pinball company out there in the world.

[00:56] I'm going to call it the Canada boutique pinball challenge.

[00:59] It's a very simple challenge.

[01:01] And I think the companies that are doing it right would not have a problem winning this

[01:06] challenge.

[01:07] Okay.

[01:08] But I want to start out by saying, look, I don't like it when a pinball company changes

[01:12] the way it's marketing its game midway through the marketing launch of the machine.

[01:18] I don't like it when a company changes its mind and says, hey, this is going to be exclusive

[01:24] to the limited edition mermaid editions of the game.

[01:28] And then they open up that to everybody else.

[01:30] Why would anybody be happy about that other than the company that's trying to make money

[01:36] after they said they would not do that?

[01:39] Okay.

[01:40] So I don't know why it's a problem for me to say that, but here's the real issue.

[01:44] I know that I said that some of these sleazy sales tactics are somewhat reminiscent of

[01:50] Mr. Andrew Highway.

[01:53] And I just want to say for the record, I have never said that Haggis Pinball is headed for

[01:58] financial ruin.

[01:59] I've never said they're out of money.

[02:01] I've never said any of that.

[02:03] Do I think Haggis Pinball is going to end up like highway pinball?

[02:07] I don't really know, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:09] I really don't know.

[02:10] And what I mean by that is this.

[02:13] Do I think five years from now, Haggis Pinball will be kicking and going strong in the pinball

[02:18] world.

[02:19] And that's how you answer that question from what we've seen over the last couple years.

[02:24] They make a quality product that is super beautiful, but my main question with Haggis

[02:29] Pinball has always been about their manufacturing capabilities.

[02:34] And it's not just that they can get a few games out the door, Kim.

[02:38] It's like, can this company consistently keep the line moving?

[02:42] And look, nobody is forcing you to buy a game from any pinball company.

[02:47] Nobody.

[02:49] Losing sleep over Haggis Pinball, like their destiny is in their hands.

[02:53] It's not in my hands.

[02:55] I do a little pinball podcast that talks to just about 600 people now.

[02:59] We're losing a few at the first of the month because that little five dollar bill hit some

[03:03] people and we lost about like 12 people this month, but we're still holding strong.

[03:08] We're still over 600.

[03:10] But look, their destiny is in their hands.

[03:13] And I just want to say, I still think they ran a little bit too far ahead of where they

[03:17] were as a company.

[03:18] If you look at Spooky Pinball and what they did to grow as a company, they walked a little

[03:23] bit more before they ran into a big factory.

[03:26] They walked a little bit more before they took on a lot of overhead and they learned how

[03:30] to make games the hard way.

[03:32] And that's been my thing with Haggis from the very beginning is like they didn't sell

[03:36] a lot of Celts machines.

[03:38] And then all of a sudden they've got this much bigger space, much bigger factory, a lot

[03:43] more overhead.

[03:45] And so I don't know, right?

[03:47] And look, from the very beginning, Damien said this company was going to be a lot more

[03:50] transparent and he was going to let us see behind the scenes on what went into making

[03:56] these games and he's done anything but that.

[03:59] So why should I feel great about a company that trickles games out, doesn't show people

[04:04] anything behind the scenes, and I have friends who have deposits on this game that are still

[04:09] waiting for the game.

[04:11] They were told when they paid in full, they'd have their game in eight weeks and they still

[04:15] don't have the game.

[04:16] Okay, so here's the Canadian challenge.

[04:18] I want to challenge every single boutique pinball company in the world to do two things.

[04:23] Are you ready?

[04:24] And these are not difficult things to be transparent about.

[04:27] I have simply two things I would like to see from every single boutique pinball company

[04:32] in the world.

[04:33] Remember, these companies want your hard earned money.

[04:35] A lot of these companies, nonrefundable deposits, why are we not allowed to ask these two things

[04:41] and at least see these two things before we commit to buying a pinball machine that costs

[04:45] eight to $12,000.

[04:46] We're not allowed to ask for these two things.

[04:48] Here are the two things I would like to know from every single boutique pinball company.

[04:52] There's really only two companies out there that I don't consider to be boutique pinball

[04:57] operations and that's Jersey Jack and Stern Pinball.

[05:01] And I'm actually thinking that Spooky Pinball might have graduated beyond being a boutique

[05:06] company when you look at the amount of games they make and ship a year.

[05:10] So let's take Spooky out of the equation as well.

[05:13] So I consider boutique pinball to be Chicago Gaming Company, to be Home Pin, to be Haggis

[05:19] Pinball, to be like pinball adventures, to be Dutch Pinball, to be pinball brothers,

[05:26] to be multi-morphic.

[05:28] Am I missing anybody from this equation?

[05:30] And so here's my challenge to these boutique companies.

[05:33] I would like to know from each of these boutique companies, how many games a week can you make?

[05:40] Why is that such a secret for all of us to know?

[05:44] It's a very simple question.

[05:46] How many pinball machines can you make a week?

[05:50] How many?

[05:51] Why don't we know that with all of these boutique companies?

[05:55] Why are we still guessing?

[05:56] And when you think about the most successful boutique company of all time, it's been Spooky

[06:01] Pinball.

[06:02] They started out with 150 games.

[06:05] They had a hard time selling all of those America's most haunted.

[06:10] What Spooky Pinball did from the very beginning is they let us know what their manufacturing

[06:16] capabilities were every single step along the way.

[06:20] They let their customers know we can make this many games a week.

[06:25] If you order a game from us, here is when you're going to get it because this is how

[06:30] many games we can make with the personnel that works at Spooky Pinball.

[06:36] And they have been that way since day one.

[06:38] Now say what you will about Spooky Quality and their theme selections.

[06:41] I don't care about that.

[06:43] What I want to focus on is they have been successful in this hobby because they have

[06:48] been transparent about how many games a week they can make because they know that that

[06:53] is not a competitive advantage at all.

[06:56] It simply means they are not spinning anything.

[06:59] They are not trying to mislead people.

[07:01] They are actually trying to properly manage people's expectations about when they will

[07:07] get their game.

[07:08] What a great freaking move Spooky Pinball.

[07:11] I'm so happy that you were not afraid to tell us what you're capable of doing.

[07:16] So there's that.

[07:17] So I would like to know how many games a week can you make Haggis Pinball?

[07:22] How many games a week can you make Chicago Gaming Company?

[07:26] How many games a week are you making Dutch Pinball?

[07:29] How many games a week are you making Multimorphic?

[07:31] I mean this is not really a difficult question and I'm still shocked that if I asked each

[07:37] and every one of you before you give companies your money, your hard earned money as a nonrefundable

[07:43] deposit you have no idea the answer to that question.

[07:47] Absolutely no idea.

[07:48] And you're still handing your money over.

[07:50] And they say, Canade is not being positive.

[07:52] Canade is not cheerleading everything in Pinball.

[07:54] Come on.

[07:55] It's not a very difficult question.

[07:57] Especially in the world of manufacturing.

[07:59] The entire world of manufacturing is built around finite numbers.

[08:03] We have this many employees.

[08:05] We have this many parts.

[08:07] We can make this many games a day.

[08:09] We can make this many games a week.

[08:11] They must know the answer to that question.

[08:14] Why can't we know it as customers?

[08:16] It's ridiculous.

[08:17] Okay here's the second part of the Canade Challenge.

[08:19] Are you ready for this one?

[08:20] This is my favorite one.

[08:22] Because I don't think most of these Pinball beauty companies have the guts to do this.

[08:27] And this is the ultimate sign of transparency.

[08:29] I want these boutique companies without doing a staged video, I challenge them to open up

[08:36] the door to their factory on a random Wednesday and just do a Facebook live and walk around

[08:44] and show us what is actually happening inside your company on a random Wednesday.

[08:50] I don't want a staged video where you tell us everything is alright and we see Marty's

[08:56] shoes hiding in the corner trying to stay off camera.

[08:58] I don't want a staged production room where you say hey production's begun but it's a

[09:02] fake staged production room.

[09:04] I want you to walk around Haggis Pinball Damien and I want you to show me what a random Wednesday

[09:09] is at Haggis Pinball.

[09:11] I want David Fix to show me oh I forgot American Pinball.

[09:14] They're the other boutique company I forgot about.

[09:16] I want David Fix to walk around American Pinball on a random Tuesday or Wednesday and show

[09:23] me what's happening inside American Pinball.

[09:25] I want to know how many games a week can you make American Pinball.

[09:29] If David Fix wants to come out and say American Pinball has sold 2,000 units of Galactic Tank

[09:35] Force.

[09:36] That's what he said.

[09:37] We've sold 2,000 units.

[09:38] Okay.

[09:39] So how many a week can you make David?

[09:41] If you sold 2,000 can you make those games in 6 months, 8 months, 2 years?

[09:47] Can't we as consumers know what their capability is when it comes to fulfilling those orders

[09:53] and how is asking a question like this not a normal thing to do in any other aspect of

[10:00] our lives.

[10:01] Like Microsoft will tell you how many Xboxes they can make.

[10:04] Ford will tell you how many Mustangs they produce a month but when it comes to Pinball

[10:09] we've all got to be stupid and hand over our money and not ask any questions like this

[10:14] and then they take your nonrefundable money and then you're left pounding sand.

[10:18] They tell you to your face you're going to have your game in 8 weeks and then 8 months

[10:23] go by and Canada's the bad guy.

[10:25] Come on Cam.

[10:26] I'm not the bad guy.

[10:27] I'm not rooting against Haggis Pinball.

[10:30] Damien told his customers they'd have their games in 8 weeks.

[10:33] Not me.

[10:34] Can you imagine Cam and I'm talking to you right now.

[10:37] Cam said I know nothing about business.

[10:39] Cam let me tell you something about business.

[10:40] You know more than me.

[10:42] You're more successful than me but I do know this in my business world.

[10:46] If I told my boss I'm going to have that report on their desk in 8 weeks and 8 weeks go by

[10:53] and it's not on their desk and I take 8 months to finish that report.

[10:57] Cam what do you think happens to me in my world of business.

[11:00] I'd be fired and in my line of business it's not even like 8 weeks.

[11:04] I need ideas in like 8 hours or ideas in 8 days and I don't have the luxury to tell my

[11:10] clients hey I'm going to get this for you.

[11:13] You're paying for Chris's services but trust me you're going to have it then and then I

[11:17] blow by that date.

[11:19] Not by a few hours by a few months and then I'm the hot shot toxic guy in Pinball.

[11:24] Come on everybody.

[11:25] I would love to see these companies.

[11:27] I would love to walk through CGC.

[11:29] What is going on over there.

[11:30] I would love to walk through like multi-morphic.

[11:33] What's it like.

[11:34] Are there people there.

[11:35] Here's the other part.

[11:37] This transparency should not be seen as an indictment.

[11:41] Nobody should feel nervous about opening up the door to their chocolate factory and showing

[11:46] us what their pinball company looks like on a random Wednesday.

[11:51] Shouldn't that be a glorious thing.

[11:53] Why is that such a difficult thing for these companies to show us.

[11:57] Because then it leads me to believe that nothing's happening.

[12:00] That you open up the door on a Wednesday and everyone's just sitting there twiddling their

[12:04] thumbs or they don't have people on staff every week and they're just waiting for stuff

[12:08] to happen.

[12:09] But meanwhile they took your money.

[12:11] They already took your money and they don't even have anything happening every day.

[12:15] You know like Stern Pinball does their Friday factory tours.

[12:18] Jersey Jack Pinball shows us what's going on at their company.

[12:21] You know Spooky Pinball would open up the door to that company every single day and

[12:25] you would see nothing but activity going on.

[12:29] Nothing but pinball machines being made.

[12:30] I bet you you could drive over to Spooky Pinball.

[12:33] I think they might be closed on Fridays or Saturdays.

[12:36] But you could drive over there on the days they are open and knock on the door and Spooky

[12:42] Pinball will A. give you a tour.

[12:44] B. let you film everything.

[12:46] C. you'll see a bunch of people who have great personalities and great stories to tell making

[12:52] pinball machines.

[12:53] If I knock on the door to Haggis tomorrow how many people are on the other side of that

[12:57] door.

[12:58] Do you know.

[12:59] Do I know.

[13:00] No.

[13:01] Has Damien let us meet the people at Haggis Pinball.

[13:02] Who are the people.

[13:03] Remember when that guy from Argentina flew over there to become a member of the Haggis

[13:07] team and he promoted that.

[13:08] Well that guy is gone.

[13:10] So who's over there.

[13:11] Why is this such a difficult thing for us to get access to for these companies to showcase.

[13:17] And I don't think it's being negative.

[13:19] I just think this is where we're at in pinball and everybody knows this.

[13:22] Like we just saw nine games revealed to the world.

[13:26] Nine pinball machines.

[13:27] But who can actually make these games.

[13:30] Do you know.

[13:31] It's really weird to me that Pulp Fiction was revealed when it was revealed.

[13:35] When are they going to make this game.

[13:37] Right.

[13:38] When you have no idea.

[13:40] They're saying Q3 of 2023.

[13:42] OK.

[13:43] So what's happening right now at CGC.

[13:46] Are they making cactus canyons.

[13:48] Are they going to have a separate line.

[13:50] None of us know anything.

[13:51] All we know is what we're being told.

[13:53] But we haven't seen anything.

[13:55] When was the last time you saw the production line over at American Pinball.

[14:00] I mean live.

[14:01] I mean that is the challenge.

[14:03] Enough of these stage videos.

[14:05] I want you to go live walk around your company and show me that there are pinball machines

[14:12] being made every day.

[14:14] And then I will buy a game from you.

[14:17] That's my challenge.

[14:18] Tell me how many games a week you can make and go live on a random Wednesday and show

[14:23] me that your company is actively making pinball machines.

[14:26] Look if I went to pinball brothers.

[14:27] I don't think they'd be nervous about this.

[14:30] Andretti gaming over there in Italy.

[14:32] They're making games every day.

[14:33] I don't think Dutch pinball would be nervous about this.

[14:36] Barry is making games every single day now.

[14:39] We all know who would be nervous.

[14:41] We all know who is hiding.

[14:43] And look I know it's a difficult business.

[14:46] But of course it's a red flag if they don't want to open the door to their factory because

[14:50] we all know this.

[14:52] If you have a manufacturing company you're losing money every day.

[14:56] There's not a game on the line.

[14:58] You're losing money.

[14:59] Stern has said this from day one.

[15:01] Gary is like we're a manufacturing company.

[15:04] We are not a pinball company.

[15:07] Everyone in pinball whether they like it or not they will make their money off of their

[15:11] manufacturing efficiencies.

[15:13] But man oh man like a lot of us in the pinball community because we love pinball so much

[15:18] we've been sending checks to these companies way too soon before they've shown anything

[15:24] we're sending in deposit money that's nonrefundable.

[15:27] Alright so that's my challenge.

[15:29] Watch none of these companies go live on a random Wednesday.

[15:32] If they do go live on a random Wednesday let me entice them a little bit.

[15:36] If they go live into their factory on a random Wednesday.

[15:40] Canada will buy lunch for the company.

[15:42] How about that.

[15:43] I will buy them a lunch.

[15:44] A nice lunch for the company if they go live on a random Wednesday.

[15:49] That's my incentive for these companies to let us behind the doors.

[15:52] Alright so it's May 1st.

[15:54] What's going on in the pinball world this May.

[15:56] Okay so look Foo Fighters is Stern's game on the line.

[15:59] James Bond code is going to continue to get better so that is going to happen.

[16:03] I also think we're probably going to see the topper for Foo Fighters sometime this month.

[16:09] I think Stern wants to get these toppers out to people sooner than later.

[16:13] I hope it comes out this month.

[16:15] I always get a little sad that people buy a game.

[16:18] They want to have the full package, the full experience and then Stern makes you wait like

[16:24] two years for the topper.

[16:25] So hopefully this interactive Foo Fighter topper comes out soon.

[16:29] For you Foo Fighter guys out there I know you're having a great time with the machine.

[16:34] The mods for the game are great.

[16:35] The games are playing great and I think you're having a blast on the machine.

[16:40] For you Pulp Fiction guys out there what do you do now right.

[16:43] What do you do now if you're in on Pulp Fiction.

[16:44] This Pulp Fiction hype thread is kind of funny to me because it is May.

[16:49] We are probably not going to see a Pulp Fiction on the line for six months and yet they're

[16:54] still going to be bringing this game around to all the different shows and they still

[16:59] want people to order it.

[17:00] I mean I just still don't understand.

[17:02] Does anyone know why Pulp Fiction was revealed so early.

[17:06] What was the rationale in getting it out the door so soon.

[17:10] And here's the part that makes no sense to me.

[17:12] The game is done.

[17:14] The game is done.

[17:15] The code is done.

[17:16] The game is done.

[17:17] There's nothing left to be done on this game other than make it.

[17:23] Why can't it be made.

[17:24] I keep thinking like well what if they got a few thousand orders.

[17:27] Couldn't that lead CGC to opening up another line.

[17:31] Wouldn't that give them enough money to hire people to make the games.

[17:35] I'm just not sure what the issue is.

[17:38] Alright so what else is going on.

[17:39] So May is supposed to be when we get Godfather Collector's Edition.

[17:44] This is going to get interesting because Godfather's Collector's Edition I think actually got

[17:49] more orders than Godfather LE which is crazy.

[17:53] I think you're going to see all thousand of those Godfathers end up in places which is

[17:57] great.

[17:58] The machine is beautiful.

[18:00] I can't wait to finally play one in New York City where the Godfather takes place.

[18:05] But let's see like how many of these games are going to be unboxed in May.

[18:10] I hope we see them on the line soon.

[18:13] Speaking of Collector's Editions.

[18:15] If you have guns and roses and you want a replacement playfield for your GNR Collector's

[18:21] Edition I heard today from Doris over at JJP they have the replacement playfields in for

[18:27] both the lower and the upper playfield.

[18:30] So that's exciting news.

[18:32] I know for many of us we've waited now two years for this moment but the moment is here.

[18:37] I got the email.

[18:39] Doris is a really nice woman and I know none of us want to have to spend more on this defective

[18:45] playfield but at least they are giving us a shot at it and giving us a shot at it at

[18:51] cost.

[18:52] So make sure you reach out to Jersey Jack Pinball for that.

[18:54] Okay so the other question about May is this.

[18:57] Are we finally going to see some Galactic Tank Force games.

[19:01] Now the rumor is this game is going to be on the line in June.

[19:05] And it begs the question why did you bring it to shows two to three months before the

[19:11] game was ready for the line.

[19:13] Can someone answer me why they do this.

[19:16] Why do they lock in all this money.

[19:19] The game's not on the line.

[19:21] I'm glad they're catching some issues with the game and the targets and they told us

[19:25] they would fix these issues before they make the game.

[19:28] But the hype is quickly dying on this game.

[19:31] And if they had done it right like if they had done it the right way and they said look

[19:35] we've got 200 tanks already built in a box and revealed the game the right way with the

[19:41] right video.

[19:42] They would have sold all 200 of those le tanks on day one and they'd be on trucks making

[19:48] their way to customers.

[19:50] They've given people too much time to think about it.

[19:54] They've given people too much time to complain about the game.

[19:58] And now there's no real positive energy.

[20:01] Now it's just like Iceman and a few other buyers trying to strong on people into thinking

[20:06] the game is going to be great.

[20:08] And I don't know if the game is going to be great or not.

[20:09] It's way too early to tell.

[20:11] But I do know they had a lot of expectations for this game within the pinball community.

[20:16] It was the pinball of enthusiasts that were looking forward to Dennis Norman's new game

[20:21] over at AP.

[20:23] And I think if you zoom out and just look at what they delivered it's a nice package for

[20:27] American pinball.

[20:29] I don't think it's meeting or exceeding where people's expectations were for this title.

[20:34] I don't think people are seeing a mech or toys that blow them away.

[20:37] I think the code is really confusing.

[20:39] The story line is confusing.

[20:41] The artwork is good.

[20:42] It's not franchise best.

[20:43] He gets really triggered when you say that.

[20:45] But simply hold this game up next to Munsters and tell me there's the same level of detail

[20:50] in both games.

[20:51] I think it shows his limitations a little bit working with an original IP.

[20:55] I think he's much better suited for license theme games.

[21:00] He knows this.

[21:01] We know this.

[21:02] It's not a personal insult.

[21:04] It's just where his style works best.

[21:07] And so like that's it.

[21:08] I don't know how they're going to get people hyped about this game again.

[21:11] I mean what are they going to do right.

[21:12] I mean they've had a chance to stream it.

[21:14] We've seen it stream for a few hours.

[21:16] I don't think the streams are making people say take my money now.

[21:20] More big Lebowski's will get out the door this month.

[21:23] Who knows how well Puny Factory and Spinal Tap are going to sell this month.

[21:27] But it's a really crowded space.

[21:29] And the only companies that are going to be successful are the ones making games.

[21:34] It seems so commonsensical but it's true.

[21:37] I think people are going to get bored and buy Godfather simply because it's available.

[21:41] I'm not sure people like are dying to have it.

[21:43] Even if you're not dying to have Godfather if you just want something new in a box you

[21:49] can go get Godfather.

[21:51] They're going to have them as inventory all over the place.

[21:54] I think you might have to wait on Foo Fighters Premium until the next run of premiums.

[21:59] Foo Fighter LEs are all sold out.

[22:01] Scooby-Doo's are going to be trickling out.

[22:03] The thing I'm seeing about Scooby-Doo is like they're bringing these games to shows

[22:07] and they're selling the floor models at the show.

[22:11] As I said if you just wait it you could roll into Allentown Pennsylvania this weekend and

[22:16] drive home with the Scooby-Doo.

[22:18] I might be going to Allentown this weekend I'm not sure.

[22:22] It's about 90 minutes away from here.

[22:24] It's really hard with Killian and Brenda but I'm going to try to make it out to the show.

[22:28] If you're going to Allentown let me know.

[22:30] You might see me there.

[22:31] What else is going on this May?

[22:33] I mean Pinball Brothers and Queen how well is that game selling?

[22:38] They're making them.

[22:39] I'm just happy that they're making Queen Pinball.

[22:42] They're putting games in boxes.

[22:45] The big rumor as you know.

[22:47] Pindready Gaming and Pinball Brothers that's going to be who makes the Twilight Zone remake.

[22:52] If you see what's happening there's a reason why Pindready Gaming is doing all the Balli

[22:58] Williams 2.0 kits right now because Planetary Pinball is fed up with freaking CGC taking

[23:04] forever to make these games and guess who's actually got a consistent line moving?

[23:09] Pindready Gaming.

[23:11] It feels like they have more activity going on than freaking CGC.

[23:16] Ryan White where are you?

[23:17] I just have this feeling of like opening the door at CGC and I don't even know what's

[23:21] going on there.

[23:22] I mean I feel like completely lost.

[23:23] I feel like if you open the door at American Pinball you're just going to see Steve Bowden

[23:27] eating ice cream.

[23:28] Intergalactic ice cream made by Space Cows.

[23:31] If you open up the door at Haggis I think you're going to see like three to five people

[23:34] at most making these machines like Garage building them in a large factory.

[23:39] Come on people these are not $60 video games.

[23:43] This is not a $100 watch.

[23:45] These are 8 to $12,000 toys.

[23:49] If they don't want to let us see what's happening in their own toy factory then why did they

[23:54] get into pinball manufacturing?

[23:56] Everybody thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[23:59] I'm losing my voice a little bit.

[24:01] Oh my god, Canadians only May 1st.

[24:03] Are you going to be able to make it to the end of the month?

[24:06] Of course I'm going to be.

[24:07] Let's see who takes up Canada on this challenge.

[24:10] If they do a Facebook live and they show us what's happening behind the door, Canada will

[24:16] buy that company lunch.

[24:18] What a good offer.

[24:19] What a good offer.

[24:20] My lunches will probably be better than just like ham sandwiches.

[24:23] Everybody have a good day.

[24:24] We'll talk to you soon.
