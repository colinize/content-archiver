[00:00] All the rumors are true, yeah, with your heart that's true, yeah.

[00:03] Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon.

[00:07] Aw, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:10] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:11] What is Canada doing?

[00:12] Two shows and two days.

[00:13] He must be feeling better on this episode.

[00:16] Let's talk about the rumors.

[00:17] And I love rumors.

[00:18] I love talking about what we think is going to happen in the pinball world.

[00:22] It's going to be a very exciting 2022 in pinball.

[00:25] Now, one thing that is not a rumor.

[00:27] The Canada Pinball Podcast, the Facebook Live of Canada, was voted the second most popular

[00:33] pinball stream in the world during this year's TwiPies.

[00:37] Now, thank you, each and every one of you who voted for it.

[00:40] I love doing my Facebook Lives.

[00:43] I love it.

[00:44] There's no editing.

[00:45] I just hit go, record.

[00:46] I beg for stars.

[00:48] And we talk about pinball.

[00:49] We don't even stream pinball.

[00:50] I think that's the most amazing part about it.

[00:53] And we have almost 2,000 people who are checking out Facebook Live of Canada.

[00:57] If you're not there, you should get there.

[00:59] Okay, you are not here to listen to me congratulate myself.

[01:02] I do it enough.

[01:03] Let's talk about the rumors of 2022 that we know.

[01:06] Now the first rumor has to do with Stern Pinball.

[01:08] We don't need to guess when Stern's next game is coming out.

[01:12] They've already told us it will be out in August of 2022.

[01:16] They were taking a break.

[01:17] It was going to be comic book edition of Venom.

[01:21] That was going to come out in April, but they shelved it.

[01:25] Now the rumor is that Venom is now not going to be the next game that they might move Venom

[01:31] back.

[01:32] And so the rumor I'm hearing in August, we are going to get Jaws from Stern Pinball.

[01:38] Jaws the big shark, right?

[01:39] Not Jaws as a codename for James Bond.

[01:42] So we shall see if that rumor comes true.

[01:44] I think Jaws is going to be a Keith Elwynne pin, and I think it's going to have Randy

[01:49] Martinez on artwork.

[01:51] But Jaws I hear is definitely coming from Stern Pinball.

[01:54] So that's rumor number one.

[01:56] The next rumors have to do with Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:58] Now this is a company that when you look at the history of Jersey Jack Pinball, every

[02:03] year this company promises they're going to get two games out a year.

[02:08] It always seems to be like the North Star for this company.

[02:11] Like eventually we will have to get to a point where we can sell more than one game a year.

[02:16] Now the sad thing about Jersey Jack Pinball is the demand is there.

[02:21] Like they could sell more Wizard of Oz games and Hobbits and Dial Dins and Wonkas and Guns

[02:27] and Roses.

[02:28] Like they have demand for their product.

[02:30] They can't make it.

[02:31] I was just at Texas Pinball Festival.

[02:33] The only Jersey Jack machine that was there in the entire show was one title Guns and

[02:39] Roses.

[02:40] And unfortunately JJP's history has been this.

[02:43] Like they have a game and they make that game for like over a year.

[02:48] Only two years they make the game and they just can't seem to reveal, announce and make

[02:53] the follow up game with any sort of consistency.

[02:56] With any cadence.

[02:57] Remember Stern Pinball is making a new game.

[03:00] Fully code it for the most part.

[03:02] Fully featured game.

[03:03] Every four months Stern gives you a new game.

[03:06] Every four months Jersey Jack Pinball in two years usually gives you only one title.

[03:12] This is the big difference between these two companies but here's the rumor I'm hearing

[03:16] that Jersey Jack Pinball is contractually obligated to send out two games this year.

[03:22] And here's why I think they are contractually obligated to get two games out.

[03:26] I think you've got Toy Story.

[03:28] I bet the Toy Story game is contractually obligated to be out by the time the Buzz Lightyear movie

[03:34] comes out in June.

[03:36] That movie is coming out I believe June 17th.

[03:39] So I fully expect to see the Toy Story Pinball machine revealed right around the Buzz Lightyear

[03:45] movie.

[03:46] I also expect Toy Story to be at Pintastic up in Boston which is going to be the end

[03:52] of June.

[03:53] So that to me feels like that's them fulfilling their contractual obligation to Disney to

[03:58] get this machine out right around that movie launch.

[04:01] And it makes perfect sense.

[04:03] What will the next game be right?

[04:04] If that's number one then what's JJP number two?

[04:08] It seems just crazy if they're going to wait to June that they're going to have another

[04:12] game out in the fall.

[04:13] I can't even believe I'm saying this but you know what I think it is.

[04:16] I think it's Eric Minier's next game.

[04:18] I heard the game has been done for a while.

[04:20] I heard they're playing it at JJP for a while.

[04:24] I hear the game is supposed to be fast and have a lot of flow.

[04:27] I think this is Eric hearing the feedback from a lot of people that his games don't

[04:31] shoot as well as other people's games.

[04:33] And I think he wants to answer back with this Godfather game.

[04:37] Yes, I think it is the Godfather.

[04:39] I also think it's probably part of the contractual obligation that we will get this Godfather

[04:45] pinball machine out during the 50th anniversary of Godfather.

[04:50] So I think that's part of it right?

[04:51] It's like we need to get these two titles out and we're obligated to doing it.

[04:55] And also the rumor was that Christopher Franci would be working on the art package with Eric

[05:01] Minier's next game.

[05:02] I still think Franci is working on this game.

[05:05] I still think it's Godfather and I think it's going to happen sometime in the fall.

[05:09] But here's the big caveat with all of this.

[05:12] Even though Jersey Jack pinball is contractually obligated to get these games out, history

[05:17] has shown us that they have often missed their contractual obligations.

[05:22] Remember, Jack was supposed to get the Hobbit out, contractually obligated to get it out

[05:27] with the Hobbit movies.

[05:28] He didn't hit that deadline.

[05:30] They were supposed to get Toy Story out when Toy Story 4 came out in the movie theaters.

[05:35] That was years ago.

[05:36] They contractually did not hit that deadline and that's why Disney said, uh-uh, if you

[05:41] can't get the game out by now, we're not going to release the game.

[05:44] And that is why they reskin Toy Story into Willy Wonka.

[05:48] Like all this is pretty well documented by the people who are behind the scenes.

[05:53] Now here's another rumor I'm hearing that is actually making me nervous.

[05:57] The rumor is that Toy Story is going to be based on the fourth Toy Story movie, not the

[06:03] entire franchise.

[06:04] Now again, this is just a rumor.

[06:06] Now as a Toy Story fanatic, I really, really hope that this is not the case.

[06:11] This would be the most deflating worst case scenario because Toy Story 1 is the iconic

[06:17] film.

[06:18] I would argue that Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 3 are arguably the best films in the franchise.

[06:24] But just Toy Story 1 alone is the one you want to build it on.

[06:28] You want to build it on the relationship between Woody and Buzz and how Buzz thinks he's a

[06:33] space ranger and how he thinks he can fly.

[06:36] That is still the greatest storyline and the greatest character development in the entire

[06:41] series.

[06:42] And then you want to have the claw at Pizza Planet and all the stuff that goes on in that

[06:47] movie is just perfect.

[06:49] Most of the characters that we love in the Toy Story franchise are introduced in that

[06:53] first movie.

[06:54] Yes, they do have a lot of fun introducing new characters throughout the franchise,

[06:59] but Toy Story 1 is really the one you want.

[07:02] It's really the iconic go-to version of the film.

[07:05] And the fourth one I'm worried about because if you remember the storyline in the fourth

[07:09] one, it's a little bit sadder.

[07:12] It's not as much fun.

[07:14] It's like Woody searching for Bo Peep and he's not really with Buzz most of the time.

[07:19] And then you've got the character Forky which becomes the side plot.

[07:22] And then the main human in it is the young daughter and her relationship with Forky and

[07:27] how she's stripping Woody of his deputy status.

[07:30] And it's just the whole thing is just it feels sad.

[07:33] There was like a really sad undertone to the fourth movie.

[07:36] I loved it.

[07:37] Look, I love all Toy Story movies.

[07:38] It was a really enjoyable movie, but I just don't see myself going back to Toy Story

[07:44] 4 the way I do the other three.

[07:46] You know, but to play Devil's Advocate, there's a lot of fun they could have with Toy Story

[07:50] 4 because it takes place in an antique shop.

[07:54] It takes place at a carnival.

[07:56] You've got that ventriloquist doll that looks like Rudy from Funhouse.

[07:59] So that can be really interesting if Pat Lawler puts his Funhouse mech back into a Toy Story

[08:06] game that actually eats the ball and interacts with the ball.

[08:09] This could be sort of like Pat Lawler's follow-up to Funhouse since most of this movie takes

[08:13] place at a carnival.

[08:15] But I still really hope it's more of the first movie and they really bring the characters

[08:20] of Rex and Mr. Potato Head and the Green Army men and the aliens with the claw.

[08:25] I want all of that.

[08:27] That's what I want.

[08:28] I want Buzz Lightyear, Infinity and Beyond and the Etch-a-Sketch and RC the Car.

[08:33] Like those are the iconic Toy Story characters we know the best.

[08:36] But the reason why the rumor that it's Toy Story 4 is that when Pat was making this game,

[08:41] he was making it to launch it with the fourth movie.

[08:45] So that's the part that makes me think that the rumor that Jersey Jack's Toy Story game

[08:49] is based on the fourth movie could be true.

[08:52] The problem now is this.

[08:54] That movie came out years ago.

[08:56] They missed the deadline years ago.

[08:59] So it's not timely anymore.

[09:01] It'd be like making a Matrix pinball machine and only basing it on the last Matrix movie.

[09:07] It's not what people want.

[09:08] I really hope they don't do this.

[09:10] Did you see the JJP seminar at TPF?

[09:13] Jack said something in the seminar that was very interesting.

[09:15] He said something like, when we go after a license, we get everything with that license.

[09:20] And I'm like, what?

[09:21] How did Jack even come to that conclusion?

[09:23] I mean, if Jersey Jack is famous for anything when it comes to licensing a property, it's

[09:28] what they don't get with the license.

[09:30] I mean, look at Pirates of the Caribbean.

[09:32] There's like absolutely nothing from those movies that we loved in the game.

[09:36] Like no Jack Sparrow, no Johnny Depp, none of the humor.

[09:40] None of the humor is in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[09:42] And then you look at like Willy Wonka.

[09:44] Where are all the musicals?

[09:46] Where's the song?

[09:47] Where's the singing?

[09:48] Where's the dancing?

[09:49] Where's everything Willy Wonka is famous for?

[09:51] It's not there.

[09:52] They didn't even get to sync up the voice actors with the clips from the movie.

[09:56] I mean, they did not get everything they wanted.

[09:59] And in the Hobbit, at least they got more clips from the film and they used the voice

[10:03] actor for Gandalf.

[10:05] But Jack does not have a good track record of getting assets.

[10:09] And this is why I get really nervous about Toy Story is it's another Disney movie.

[10:13] And clearly Disney was hard to work with with Pirates of the Caribbean, which is also a

[10:18] Disney movie.

[10:19] And I think this contract was sort of inked at the same time.

[10:22] So I'm worried that Jack got more of a lunchbox deal and is not going to have like all of

[10:27] the clips from the movie.

[10:29] Is not going to have the call outs from the actors.

[10:32] We're not going to see the stuff we love.

[10:34] Now I don't know.

[10:35] I hope so.

[10:36] I really do hope so.

[10:37] I think this is a real crossroads for Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[10:40] I do.

[10:41] I think people are going to look at this next Jersey Jack game and they're going to know

[10:44] which direction is this company going in.

[10:48] Are they stripping the bomb down?

[10:50] Are they trying to simplify their games?

[10:53] Are they going to rely on light shows and LEDs more than mechanical magic?

[10:58] We all want the mechanical magic.

[11:00] I'm worried.

[11:01] I really am worried.

[11:03] When you look at a game like Willy Wonka, like where's the magical mechs in that game?

[11:08] Where?

[11:09] Like where's the stuff?

[11:10] Like the movie itself has all of these different rooms in the chocolate factory with all of

[11:14] this interesting stuff going on.

[11:17] And then you play the game and look, there's like a screen.

[11:20] There's a magnet.

[11:21] There's a gobb stopper hole.

[11:23] But that's it.

[11:24] There isn't much in that game that makes you go, wow, like that's a magical mech.

[11:29] Like I'm seeing something turn on that is like really interesting.

[11:33] And I hope it is called Toy Story.

[11:36] This is going to be the one.

[11:37] If they don't jam a bunch of amazing toys into Toy Story, I think we have our answer

[11:44] on where this company is going moving forward.

[11:47] And I really fingers crossed.

[11:49] I hope this is Pat Lawler's swan song.

[11:51] I hope it's loaded.

[11:53] I'm worried.

[11:54] I think Pat is the guy that was stripping everything out.

[11:57] I think his dream is to have a pin on location that's played everywhere.

[12:01] And I think he's more concerned with like simplicity than he is with magic.

[12:06] But we shall see.

[12:07] All right.

[12:08] What else is going on in the pinball rumor mill?

[12:10] American pinball.

[12:11] There is a rumor that they have the license for He-Man Masters of the Universe and they

[12:16] lost it to Stern Pinball.

[12:18] Now, how could that happen?

[12:19] How could you lose a license?

[12:20] Like, oh, where did you put the license?

[12:22] Is it in the drawer?

[12:23] Is it in the closet?

[12:24] No, I think here's what happened.

[12:26] I think Michael Grant was working over at AP and I think he was maybe in talks to get

[12:31] this license for American pinball.

[12:35] And I think Michael Grant went over to Stern Pinball because maybe just maybe they were

[12:41] in talks and maybe he went over to Stern with this license and got Stern the deal instead

[12:47] of American pinball.

[12:48] I am making up all of this, but that is my speculation because he jumped ship from AP

[12:55] and went over to Stern.

[12:56] It could just be simply like they were shopping around different pinball manufacturers and

[13:00] we know that Jody Dankberg is not stupid.

[13:03] Jody Dankberg knows everybody.

[13:05] Stern Pinball has relationships with every single studio.

[13:08] So maybe what happened was they were talking to Mattel and maybe AP had a few conversations

[13:14] and then all of a sudden, maybe Jody knows someone over at Mattel, maybe Jared who knows

[13:20] a lot of people over at Mattel, maybe they called up Jody and said, hey, we're talking

[13:24] with this company about a license.

[13:26] Are you guys interested?

[13:27] We know you're the number one pinball company in the world and maybe that's how it happened

[13:32] because we know that Stern Pinball also has a track record of just catching when that someone's

[13:37] talking with a license, right?

[13:39] They caught when that Spooky Pinball was talking about Toho Godzilla and then they went in

[13:44] afterwards and they took it.

[13:46] Now everyone right now is very thankful that Stern Pinball made Godzilla and Spooky Pinball

[13:52] did not get that license because we have arguably maybe the best Stern machine of all time in

[13:57] Godzilla because of Keith Elwin.

[14:00] Imagine if like Chuck and Bug made Godzilla, what that game would be like.

[14:03] It would probably be the Halloween game just reskinned into Godzilla in some weird way,

[14:08] right?

[14:09] That's kind of what they're doing lately.

[14:10] But so that is the rumor and here's the thing.

[14:12] I think that Stern is going to make He-Man Masters of the Universe and there is someone

[14:18] in the Stern sort of designer pool that is a big fan of this property.

[14:23] His name is Jack Danger.

[14:25] Jack Danger has mentioned on many occasions that he thinks He-Man would be a great theme

[14:30] for pinball.

[14:31] So I fully expect Jack Danger to make He-Man Masters of the Universe.

[14:38] It will be a cornerstone title for Stern Pinball in 2023.

[14:43] I don't think we're going to see it this year.

[14:45] I think we see it early next year.

[14:48] So put Kanata down.

[14:49] I'm a betting man.

[14:50] Put me down for Jack Danger making He-Man Masters of the Universe.

[14:55] Now the other thing we know is this is that American Pinball has two new games coming

[15:00] and the next game is their Dennis Nordman game.

[15:03] It's an original IP game.

[15:06] I am also hearing, I know this is crazy to say it, that Christopher Franci is doing the

[15:11] artwork for the Dennis Nordman game and that he's very excited for everybody to see the

[15:16] art package on this original IP Dennis Nordman game.

[15:21] Now if you ask me what it is, I don't really know.

[15:24] I mean, how do I conjure up an original IP game?

[15:28] Is it a sequel to Whitewater?

[15:30] Well, that's what he was doing over at Deeproot.

[15:32] Is it something with curvaceous women on it?

[15:34] That's something that I know Franci would be excited about.

[15:37] I have no idea what it is.

[15:39] I do know this.

[15:41] I think American Pinball's strategy of original IP games going up against licensed themes

[15:48] like Toy Story and Godfather and Jaws and James Bond.

[15:53] I think this is a crazy strategy that isn't going to work out in the end.

[15:59] It's just not going to work out.

[16:00] We know that you need a licensed theme to really drive consistent sales.

[16:06] And once Stern gets the supply issues figured out and they start making tons and tons and

[16:11] tons of premiums and pros and they catch up on their orders, it's going to be really hard

[16:16] to compete with like a Keith Elwin Jaws versus an original IP Dennis Nordman game.

[16:22] Now the only way they can compete, the only way they can be successful is if the games

[16:28] are loaded.

[16:30] Now once again, look at American Pinball.

[16:32] They've been another company that have been pulling stuff out of the games.

[16:37] They pulled stuff out.

[16:38] Houdini and Oktoberfest were packed.

[16:42] And then look at Hot Wheels.

[16:43] Look at Legends of Ahala.

[16:45] Arguably two games with very little in them.

[16:48] So they're another company that financially is trying to save money on the bomb.

[16:54] They've taken stuff out.

[16:56] They got burned by Hot Wheels.

[16:57] The other rumor I heard that this company feels like they went in on a license and they

[17:02] got burned by Hot Wheels.

[17:04] But what they don't understand is the reason why Hot Wheels did not sell well.

[17:09] It's not that the Hot Wheels license burns you.

[17:12] Is you put nothing interesting in the game.

[17:16] The reason people didn't buy Hot Wheels is you didn't have a loop-de-loop.

[17:19] You didn't have a jump.

[17:20] You didn't have a car wash.

[17:21] You had nothing about Hot Wheels that people love in the game itself.

[17:25] It is one of the most barren playfields I've seen since I've been covering pinball.

[17:30] And I know David Fick said they might add stuff to Hot Wheels like a jump in a loop-de-loop.

[17:35] Where's that?

[17:36] Like where's any of that talk?

[17:37] He said that like a year ago.

[17:39] So I just wish these companies would understand something very simple.

[17:42] You're not going to make a lot of money, American Pinball, unless you have licensed themes.

[17:49] It's just that simple.

[17:51] Or you need to pack this game.

[17:53] You need Dennis Norman's game to be an original game that has a ton in it.

[17:59] Theater of Magic a ton in it.

[18:00] Like Whitewater a ton in it.

[18:02] When you look down at Whitewater, yeah that's a world under glass with a lot going on.

[18:06] Are they going to make a game like that?

[18:07] Are they going to make a game like Tales of the Arabian Knights?

[18:10] I don't know what it is.

[18:12] But it better be packed and it better be fun and it better do something that just makes

[18:17] us look at it and say OMG.

[18:20] This is what we've been waiting for.

[18:21] This is the kind of original game this industry has been asking for.

[18:26] Because it's not Legends of the Hala.

[18:27] I think they're misguided by the sales of Legends of the Hala.

[18:30] I think it came out when there was no inventory and they're a little bit delusional thinking

[18:35] it's going to work.

[18:36] Now the other rumor I'm hearing is that Riot Pinball is going to make another game for

[18:42] American Pinball.

[18:43] Now that begs the question.

[18:45] Is it going to be Wrath of Olympus or will it be an all new title?

[18:51] I think I speak for all of us when I say the following.

[18:55] Please make it an all original new title and also please work with a different artist.

[19:02] I know Scott does the artwork.

[19:04] He did the artwork for Lov.

[19:06] He did the artwork for Woolly.

[19:07] But he needs to not do the art packages on these games.

[19:11] I get it.

[19:12] You're an artist.

[19:13] But your art isn't good enough for an 8700 or more game.

[19:19] We need better art.

[19:20] Now something weird happened at TPF.

[19:22] Christopher Franci was announced by David Fix as being a member of American Pinball.

[19:28] So Christopher Franci is making a game with American Pinball which I think is Dennis Norman's

[19:33] game.

[19:34] I know for a fact that Christopher Franci is also working on Ben Hex game over at CGC

[19:39] and he might also be working on Eric Minier's game over at JJP.

[19:43] Now I don't think this is really going to work out.

[19:47] Franci is incredibly talented but he has a very specific style.

[19:52] And we haven't seen this before.

[19:53] Like point another artist that in one year has worked on three separate companies games.

[19:59] One year.

[20:00] Like art is very, very visual.

[20:03] It is very specific and it actually becomes the visual identity of your company.

[20:09] It's one thing if David Thiel wants to work on sound packages for everybody.

[20:14] That doesn't really matter.

[20:15] You just want the best sound in your game.

[20:17] But when you put a company's games next to each other there should be some similarity

[20:22] in how they look.

[20:23] And so it's going to be very interesting if we see Franci art on three different companies.

[20:28] Like there's a reason why Stern is in bed with Zambietti.

[20:33] Every time Zambietti does a game it's with Stern.

[20:36] The only games we've seen Franci do are with Stern.

[20:39] So we haven't seen this before.

[20:40] I'm not sure it's going to work out.

[20:42] We'll see how it works out.

[20:44] But look I want to see Franci's art on more pinball but I think someone needs to sign

[20:48] him up and make him their go to.

[20:51] I think Jersey Jack Pinball should be the company that does it.

[20:54] I think this guy's art is perfect for pinball and I think if all JJP games utilized Franci's

[21:00] art they would look stellar.

[21:02] Nothing against the GNR art package which is amazing but maybe you get Franci and then

[21:07] one other illustrator.

[21:08] You get Dane Henry and you get Franci as your go to back and forth.

[21:13] Because if you have two games a year which is their goal then Franci always has one of

[21:18] your games and then you give the other to maybe someone else.

[21:21] But I absolutely don't know if you can have him working on your competitors products.

[21:26] It's really weird because as we know in pinball art is a competitive advantage.

[21:32] Why would you want your artist helping a competitor sell their product.

[21:37] It just makes no sense.

[21:39] But this is going to be a very important game for American pinball.

[21:42] If this game doesn't hit I think AP might be in a little bit of trouble.

[21:46] I really do.

[21:47] I think they're going to have to eventually get a license theme in the hopper.

[21:52] What else is going on in pinball.

[21:54] We got an update from Haggis Pinball.

[21:55] Let me read it to you know because all these Haggis updates are one off emails to customers.

[22:00] Damian just can't communicate with all of us at once.

[22:03] But this is how he wants to do it.

[22:05] It goes received an update from Damian last night.

[22:08] He stated the first group of fathoms will be finishing up being put together in the next

[22:12] week or so.

[22:14] Then we'll move into final testing.

[22:16] We should start seeing a few games ship in April.

[22:19] Just remember that this is not Stern and you will not see a giant row of fathoms on a line.

[22:25] Not sure how many Haggis can build at a time but I would guess five to ten.

[22:29] Alright so here's the deal.

[22:30] We should start seeing a few games in April.

[22:33] Guess what.

[22:34] It's April Friday and it's April 1st on Friday.

[22:37] April Fool's Day.

[22:38] So look for the record I just want to clarify once again my positioning on Haggis because

[22:41] I think everyone is always like I can't wait to canada's wrong.

[22:45] I never said they wouldn't ship fathoms.

[22:48] You can't find the sound clip where I said that.

[22:50] I absolutely never said they were not going to get games out.

[22:53] I've said the following.

[22:54] I think they're going to get the fathoms built.

[22:57] I think the cost for each one they build is going to be so much greater than they anticipated

[23:04] that this company financially is going to struggle.

[23:08] I don't see how you go ten months delayed and don't take a bath on every single fathom

[23:13] you make.

[23:14] That's what I've said.

[23:15] I'm not rooting against them.

[23:17] I want everyone to get their games.

[23:19] I haven't been a fan of their communication.

[23:22] I think going silent the way he did.

[23:25] After he said January would be when production began the fact that they went silent is not

[23:31] a good sign.

[23:32] And I think for those of you out there who love to root for boutique pinball companies

[23:36] that's fine.

[23:37] I love to root for boutique pinball companies as well.

[23:41] What I don't like are missed deadlines and when companies go quiet it's always been a

[23:46] red flag.

[23:47] There's never been an example of a pinball boutique company that went quiet and then

[23:52] everything was just roses when they resurfaced.

[23:55] Again I think you're going to get your games but this company's big Achilles heel is this.

[24:01] If they've lost money on all of this then he's not charging enough for fathom to keep

[24:07] this company viable.

[24:09] He then needs to charge more for the next game and his big problem is this.

[24:13] He doesn't have a licensed theme.

[24:15] Do you think Marty Robbins with an original IP game a guy that's never designed a pinball

[24:20] machine before in his life.

[24:22] This is going to be the savior of this company.

[24:24] No what Damien needs to do is go get someone super experienced to help them out because

[24:30] here's the thing and I mean this when I say it for Marty Robbins to design an epic game

[24:35] from day one.

[24:36] Who is he learning from.

[24:38] Who's his mentor.

[24:40] Whose office is he walking into and getting advice from.

[24:43] Pinball designing is not easy.

[24:45] It's not and to make a great pinball machine you have to learn from someone.

[24:49] You have to be taught some stuff.

[24:51] You're never going to learn it just because you had money and you bought a lot of games

[24:54] and you played a lot of pinball.

[24:56] That's not what makes a great pinball designer and I think that's just my belief on all of

[25:01] this is there is a period in which you need to graduate.

[25:04] You know Jack Danger is also new right.

[25:06] You put Jack and Marty in the same boat.

[25:08] Okay fine but Jack Danger can go down the hallway and go knock on George Gomez's door

[25:14] and Keith Elwin's door and learn from people who know it so very well.

[25:18] George's door is Marty knocking on to help with design.

[25:22] Damian and the guys who did Celts and that's my point is like this company doesn't really

[25:27] have what I think is like a really sound strategy to be super profitable over the years.

[25:33] I mean their strategy seems to be to remake old games.

[25:36] That's fine and look how hard it's been.

[25:38] It's been this hard to get just one on the line and it better be a line right.

[25:43] You can have that big factory you know and just a few people come in and screw together

[25:48] a few games a week.

[25:49] That's not enough.

[25:50] You scaled up much bigger than that and for someone who just said like don't expect to

[25:54] see a lot of fathoms being built.

[25:56] I'm sorry but this company scaled up to spooky size and whenever I see spooky pinball and

[26:03] they open up their door guess what I see.

[26:05] A ton of Halloween's and Ultraman's on the line.

[26:08] We saw a ton of Rick and Morty's when they were building them so Damian didn't need all

[26:12] that space if all he's going to do is put together five games a week.

[26:16] You know this is just my observation.

[26:18] I could be right.

[26:19] I could be wrong.

[26:20] I hope you get your fathoms.

[26:22] It's not personal.

[26:24] I just want people to get their games.

[26:25] All right everybody this has been Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[26:28] Thank you again for all of your votes.

[26:31] We won favorite pinball podcast with 30% plus of the votes.

[26:36] Congratulations to Zach and the Pinball Show who finished second and super awesome Pinball

[26:40] Show finished third.

[26:42] I guess the show's not coming back as Franti said if he won he'd come back so we'll see

[26:46] what happens.

[26:47] I hope he comes back.

[26:48] I really do.

[26:49] I think Franti does a great show.

[26:50] I think it should just be like one hour on Monday and then do an hour interview on Friday.

[26:54] Just break it up a little bit and then we're all golden.

[26:57] Everybody have a great day.

[26:58] I'll talk to you soon.
