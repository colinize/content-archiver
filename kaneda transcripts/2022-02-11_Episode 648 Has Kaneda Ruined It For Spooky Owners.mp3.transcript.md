[00:00] Recognize the real dawn when you see one, sipping on bones in the house of blues.

[00:04] I'm going, going back, back to Cali, Cali.

[00:09] I'm going, going back, back to Cali, Cali.

[00:18] Ah, happy Friday everybody. We're going to Cali for the Super Bowl.

[00:22] I want the Bengals to win, but if I were a betting man, I'd bet on the Rams.

[00:27] So here's what I want to do on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:30] I want to go around the horn. Let's talk about what's going on with each company right now in

[00:35] Pinball. Let's talk about where we think these companies are going to go in 2022,

[00:39] but I want to start out with a little something. I want to ask each and every one of you, why

[00:45] isn't there a hip hop pinball machine yet in Pinball? It's kind of crazy to me. I know I played

[00:50] Notorious B.I.G. there. We've got Eminem, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur. It makes you wonder

[00:58] why there's a lack of diversity in pinball. And it's not really surprising when you think about

[01:03] it, right? Because look who's calling the shots. Gary Stern, Jody Dankberg, George Gomez. You've

[01:10] got, John Borg is the reason why they're making Rush. And it's nothing against their musical taste.

[01:15] But if you were to ask me, if you wanted to sell a pinball machine to your pinball audience,

[01:22] I think that the majority of people who also like pinball ages 40 to 60 year old man, I'm 45,

[01:30] we also grew up enjoying hip hop music. And it's not just like, you know, the West Coast, East Coast,

[01:37] like rivalry music. You've got stuff like Run DMC. Dare I put the Beastie Boys in the hip hop category?

[01:45] Maybe. And not only is there no hip hop in pinball, there's also no pop music in pinball. And if you

[01:52] also are like me, and I think you are, you also grew up enjoying pop music. I mean, almost all of

[01:59] the 80s was pop music. And then the 90s and the 2000s, it's never gone away. And so you have artists

[02:06] like Lady Gaga, artists like Madonna, artists like the Spice Girls, Katy Perry, how many of you out

[02:14] there right now have machines that your wife enjoys, that your wife loves these themes? And the reason

[02:21] why I say your wife, because, because pop music crosses over genders. And if you go to a Rush concert,

[02:28] look at the audience of a Rush concert, probably 95% men. It's not like we have to shame Rush to

[02:34] get other stuff out there, but I'm absolutely floored that there's absolutely no musical diversity

[02:42] in pinball. And if you think about music that would be great for a pinball experience, I think

[02:48] hip hop, rap, and pop music would absolutely make for an incredible pinball machine. And we can't

[02:55] talk about this without talking about the King of Pop, which is Michael Jackson. Now I know for a fact

[03:01] that Jack Guinari was very close to getting the Michael Jackson license, any panic because there

[03:07] was the documentary on HBO about Wacko Jacko. Now we all know Michael Jackson is gone. We all know

[03:14] Michael Jackson probably did some things that he never should have done. But his music still does

[03:21] live on. How many of you out there are playing your Ghostbusters right now that was designed by John

[03:28] Trudeau, a convicted pedophile, if you will. You didn't give up your games, and you're probably

[03:34] still going to listen to Beat It. But I guess we now know what Beat It means. But Michael Jackson

[03:39] pinball machine would probably be the best selling music pin of all time. So I just hope that the

[03:47] pinball decision makers can stop being so myopic. I think there's something special about a musical

[03:54] genre or an artist getting immortalized in pinball form. And I think we're done with Dad Rock. And

[04:01] we're going to get more of it. The Foo Fighters. I mean, who really wants the Foo Fighters over M&M?

[04:07] Do you? Would you rather have Lady Gaga or the Foo Fighters? I'd rather have Pink than the Foo

[04:12] Fighters. So I think this is just a hobby that needs to branch out. And I think each and every

[04:18] one of you has diverse musical tastes. And I think these companies need to recognize that and

[04:25] understand that. And it's about time. Like it's long overdue. All right. All right. Let's go around

[04:29] the pinball world and talk about what's going on with each manufacturer. Let's start with Stern

[04:34] Pinball. The story of Stern right now is the backorder of their games. I've been talking to some

[04:40] dealers and distributors, and you don't even want to know how many orders they have with Stern that

[04:46] are not fulfilled. I don't think Stern is going to fulfill all these orders even at the end of 2023.

[04:53] So it is going to be a serious drought on getting your new pinball machine. If you order a pin today,

[05:00] you're looking at like a year wait, probably to get it. I mean, Godzilla is like a year wait. Who

[05:05] knows when people are going to get their Rush premiums. All of these games are going to be delayed.

[05:10] Stern's not going to stop revealing new products because they have to stay on schedule with the

[05:16] licensors. But this is going to be the biggest issue that faces all of pinball. But here is the

[05:22] thing I want to implore each and every one of you. Do not, and I'm just doing this to save you

[05:27] money, do not pay over sticker for a pro or premium of a machine. And I'm seeing it right now in Iron

[05:35] Maiden premium just went up for like $12,500. People are starting to ask $89,000 for pro machines.

[05:44] If you go in on a pro or premium right now, I don't care what machine it is, you're going to lose

[05:51] so much money because Stern is going to remake all of these pros and premiums. These things are not

[05:56] out of circulation. Stern will never, ever, ever say we are never making this game again. If it has

[06:04] an LCD screen, there is a very good chance that Stern will do another run. And for these more

[06:12] recent games like Iron Maiden, Jurassic Park, Elvira, they're going to keep making these games.

[06:19] They'll make more Batman's. They will. It's just a matter of time once the supply chains open up.

[06:25] And I know a lot of you are buying these things because you just want to have it and that's

[06:30] fine. You can spend your money the way you want. But I think if you go in on a premium or a pro

[06:36] and you pay over, you're going to lose thousands of dollars. And if you are going to get one,

[06:42] I'm telling you, you might as well pay over and get the Ellie of the machine. The Ellie's and the

[06:49] collector's editions are the only games that are ever truly going to hold value. Those are the ones.

[06:56] And if you're going to spend 12, you might as well spend 15. Now, this is the problem I'm noticing

[07:01] in pinball right now is psychologically, we're all starting to fall down the same sort of mindset

[07:08] of like, well, it's just another three, four, five, six, before you know it, you're writing a check for

[07:15] 18 grand for a stranger things Ellie that was $8,000 like a year and a half ago before you know

[07:21] it. It's like nobody's doing the math on the percentage over MSRP. These games are going for.

[07:28] And I love it. I mean, it's not to say stranger things isn't fun, but is it $18,000 fun? I think

[07:35] the big part everyone's missing too is this. These games are made with a budget of three to $4,000.

[07:43] That's it. And if we're going to start spending 20 grand on games that only have $4,000 in material

[07:52] costs in them, this is no longer about like getting your money's worth. Pinball machines are now

[07:57] becoming like baseball cards. We're just trading them like works of art. And that's where it's at

[08:04] in the Ellie game right now. And it's absolutely crazy to me, but more power to you. If you can

[08:11] spend $20,000 on a pinball machine that only costs $4,000 to make and you can enjoy yourself.

[08:18] Personally, if I'm going to spend that much money on a game, I need to see at least half of that

[08:25] amount of money went into the bomb of the game. I need to see like amazing toys and scopes and all

[08:32] this stuff. It's still just a stern people. I think everyone needs to like lift the hood on these

[08:38] modern sterns and see how little is underneath the majority of these games. But if you're going to

[08:46] buy something, you might as well buy the Ellie. Don't go pro and premium. All right. So we got

[08:50] Brian Eddie's Venom coming. It is coming very soon. I saw Zambietti on Facebook. He got his

[08:57] pinball industry awards. He said he's working hard on the next game. His next game is Venom.

[09:03] He's doing the artwork. Now, if I were you, I would get on a list to get a Venom. I think Venom

[09:10] will be out sometime in April, May. I also think Venom will be a hit. I think this game is going

[09:19] to sell out on day one. Well, guess what? Every Ellie is already sold out. But I also think Venom

[09:26] is going to be a game that has more appeal than rush. It really will. And if I look at the market,

[09:31] let's just speculate. I think Stern is going to charge $12,000 for Venom. Ellie, they're going to

[09:38] keep raising the price. And we're going to see, I think by the end of 2022, I think Stern.

[09:45] Ellie's are going to be $12,500. And I think premiums are going to be $10,000. I do. And I think

[09:52] we're going to see Stern do more and more super Ellie anniversary editions, a la Elvira. And we're

[10:00] going to see more of that. I mean, think about it. They probably added just $500 more to the bomb of

[10:08] Elvira 40th. And then all of a sudden, they sold each one to distributors for $15,000. Just think

[10:16] about the profit Stern is making on these games. Let's just say hypothetically, it's $5,000 bomb

[10:23] to make an Elvira. They sell it to a distributor for $15,000. That's an incredible margin. They're

[10:31] making $10,000 on each one. So then they make what, 200 of them? What is that? $2 million on just a

[10:40] rerun with some different armor and stickers. And then they don't even sell you a topper with that

[10:46] $15,000 game. They didn't even redo really the artwork on the game. It's the same artwork. It's

[10:53] just printed differently. Every single Elvira has the same translate art. They got really lazy. I

[11:00] don't even think the 40th has like a true mirrored backlash for like 15 grand. Now 15 grand is just

[11:09] what they sold it to distributors for. And if you go on the marketplace now, it's like a $25,000

[11:17] pinball machine. So you start to do this math, right people? So Stern makes something for five grand

[11:23] and then the community is spending $25,000 on it. Where's that $20,000 difference? It didn't go into

[11:32] any better materials. They didn't give you a better play field. You don't even get a custom call out

[11:38] from Elvira. You don't even get a topper. What happened people? Like what happened to this hobby?

[11:44] Three years ago, if I told you Stern will be selling $25,000 pinball machines easily without

[11:49] adding much to the game, everyone would have said, I'm crazy. And here we are. Now look, the Elviras

[11:55] are kind of sitting there right now. I think some people went in right away, but the market is beginning

[12:00] to cool down. People are saying like, you know what, I'm not quite sure. I'm not quite sure.

[12:05] Personally, again, this is me personally, I don't know how you unbox a $25,000 Stern Elvira.

[12:14] You watch the play field dimple to all hell because those Elvira play fields are horrible.

[12:18] And then like you're going to have the same mech issues as everybody else. You've got the same

[12:23] cheap plastics as everybody else. And then you realize like, what did I do? What did I do? And

[12:28] then you have to go hunt and find a topper for like $25,000. So you're now at like $28,000,

[12:35] $29,000 just to experience a game that everyone else is playing for $8,000. Right? See how stupid

[12:43] it is? You spent like $20,000 more just for $500 in decals and painted armor. All right, so we got

[12:49] Venom next. I think it's going to sell out. It's going to be beautiful. Zombie Eddie's

[12:54] comic book style artwork works best with guess what? Comic book style themes. So I fully expect,

[13:01] I think his Venom is going to look so much better than Godzilla. I still don't think he was the right

[13:06] artist for Godzilla, but he figured it out, but it's not really like his style. Venom will be

[13:12] much more aligned with his art style. Then we're going to get on to George Gomez's James Bond.

[13:19] This one's going to be the really interesting game. This one's going to be the game in which

[13:25] I really think Stern tests how high they can charge for a game. I'm just going to go out on a limb.

[13:32] I think Stern is going to like sell a James Bond SLE. Get ready for it. I think they're going to sell

[13:40] it for like $20,000 like from Stern or through distributors, but I think they're going to price

[13:47] a James Bond SLE at that price. Now think about it. If you're them, why wouldn't you price it that high?

[13:54] It's going to be a George Gomez pin. Was it started by Steve Ritchie? We shall find out,

[14:00] but I don't think we'll ever know. Steve will be the only guy that can tell us if it looks like

[14:05] something he worked on before he left Stern. I think there were three white woods that Steve

[14:10] Ritchie was working on before he departed Stern. Now, who is the artist going to be for James Bond?

[14:15] Now, I would love to see Christopher Franchi come back and be in the rotation over at Stern.

[14:22] I shared on my Facebook page, Franchi did some James Bond artwork for Joe Kamikow's Aston Martin.

[14:28] Yes, Joe Kamikow has one of the craziest car collections and he's got a James Bond Aston

[14:34] Martin and he's got a screen inside the car that has all the villains and Franchi did the artwork

[14:40] for him. Super cool. It looks great. Franchi's art style is perfect for Pimbal. Will Stern forgive him

[14:48] and allow him to make games again? I mean, he's been relegated to almost nothing in Pimbal. Just

[14:54] minor touches on CGC toppers. He's doing like Stern t-shirts now. I mean, it's got to be really,

[15:01] really deflating. You go from an entire Pimbal machine with three different like trim levels

[15:08] to doing t-shirts for Stern. Now, I hope they can bury the hatchet. I hope they can move on

[15:14] because I think Stern needs Franchi back and that's just my two cents. And then we get to Keith

[15:19] Elwin's next pin, which is going to be the one. I mean, it's going to be the one. We've got Keith

[15:24] Elwin and Jack Danger are going to be the next two games we get in 2022 after we get James Bond.

[15:30] I think Jack Danger is going to be either Foo Fighters or He-Man Masters of the Universe.

[15:36] That is my bet. If I could pick which one I'd want, it would be Jack Danger's Masters of the

[15:41] Universe. It would not be Foo Fighters, but my fear is it's going to be Foo Fighters. I don't want

[15:46] it. I hope it's not that. I think Foo Fighters is an easier pass than Rush for me. Just really is.

[15:52] I think the Foo Fighters is a boring stale theme in Pimbal. Okay, Keith Elwin's next one. Here is

[15:57] what I think Keith Elwin's next pin is going to be. It's not going to be back to the future. I really

[16:02] don't think it's going to be back to the future. And I almost guarantee you it won't be back to the

[16:06] future. See, I can make that guarantee because if I'm wrong on that guarantee, everyone will be happy.

[16:12] So it's great, right? Isn't it great that when Canade is wrong, everyone is celebrating? So maybe

[16:17] it's smart for me to say some reverse psychology that I can 100% guarantee it's not back to the

[16:23] future. But I'm here to tell you that I think Keith Elwin's next pin is going to be Jaws. I am

[16:30] almost convinced it is going to be Jaws. And I think the way they're going to do Jaws is the way

[16:37] they did Jurassic Park. It's going to be like an all new Jaws adventure, if you will, inspired by the

[16:43] films. The same way Jurassic Park is inspired by the movies, they get the license for the music and

[16:50] the shark, and that's it. They're not going to get everything else. They're not going to get all the

[16:54] footage from the movie. But I think it's going to be Jaws. And that's what I'm betting my hat on,

[16:59] that Keith Elwin's next pin is going to be Jaws. So we pretty much know half of what's happening

[17:05] over at Stern Pinball. The other half is still a little bit of a question mark. And the one thing

[17:10] I think is not going to happen at Stern next year, even though I thought it would happen,

[17:14] I don't think they're going to do older titles right now. I think the backlog is so bad that we're

[17:20] not going to see a rerun of Ghostbusters. We're not going to see any vault additions at all. There's

[17:26] no way they can be doing vaults when they have thousands. I mean this, they probably have about

[17:33] 5,000 backordered games they have to make. And these are the recent titles like Mandalorian,

[17:39] like Godzilla, like Rush, like you name it, they need to make it. Elvira, Batman, there are so many

[17:46] orders that are unfulfilled. And then they also have to start releasing these new toppers. The

[17:51] Mandalorian topper is coming soon. Zach Manning talked about it. We've been waiting for it. It's

[17:57] the droid from the Mandalorian that spins around. And here's the scary part. It is going to sell more

[18:02] Mandalorians. Zach is right. But you can't go buy more Mandalorians. There are no Mandalorians to

[18:08] have anywhere. And people are still waiting on their Mandalorian orders. And that's the dilemma

[18:13] of Stern. They are so hot right now that so what if they come out with an accessory that will move

[18:20] more games? There are no more games to be had anywhere. I talked to CoinTaker yesterday. They're

[18:26] sold out. They have no inventory. These distributors are just begging for someone else to get them

[18:34] product. Alright, so speaking of someone else to get them product, wake up Jersey Jack Pinball.

[18:39] Where are you? This is the moment. This is the greatest moment for Jersey Jack Pinball to reveal

[18:47] their next title, get orders and start cranking on them. Instead, we still have nothing new from JJP.

[18:55] Guns and Roses demand is gone. Like it's gone. It doesn't mean the game's not great. Just nobody

[19:01] wants it anymore. All the orders have been fulfilled. It is so easy to go get a Guns and Roses

[19:08] LE new inbox right now. There are distributors sitting with them new inbox that you can have

[19:15] tomorrow. Todd Tucky has one. Other distributors have them. The Guns and Roses game was great,

[19:22] but it was like a year and a half ago. We are now ready to move on. Jersey Jack Pinball, 18 months

[19:29] after they revealed Guns and Roses, we still don't have Toy Story. We still don't have their next

[19:36] game. I don't know what's going on over at Jersey Jack Pinball, but it just seems like a bit of a

[19:42] sloppy mess. What was the point of moving this operation all the way to Chicago? What was the

[19:50] point of giving Pat Lawler the reins of this company and you still can't get your act together?

[19:56] This company is pretty much more inefficient than it was in New Jersey. Dare I say, this company was

[20:04] run better when Jack Guinari was at the helm. I think it was. I absolutely think it was. At least

[20:10] Jack was out there and talking to us and keeping some of the momentum going. There's nobody talking

[20:17] about the next game. There's no hype. There's nothing. When do I think we're going to see Toy

[20:23] Story and is it even going to be Toy Story? They had that license years ago and then they

[20:29] didn't release it. Maybe they went in a different direction. I don't think so. I still think it's

[20:34] going to be Toy Story. I don't think it's going to be Matrix. I don't think it's going to be like

[20:39] Avatar yet. It's going to be Toy Story. I think we're going to see it in April, May. I think that

[20:46] is when they're going to show it. But remember people, they did not show Guns N' Roses until

[20:52] the game was on the line. Now, are they going to do the same thing again? The big question mark with

[20:58] Jersey Jack Pinball is just one thing and one thing only. When they make these games, how are the

[21:03] playfields going to hold up? If there are playfield issues with Toy Story or the next title and in

[21:10] the first hundred unboxings, people start to see pooling and clear coat chipping. I think they're

[21:16] done. I really do. I think they're absolutely done. If I were them, I would have to find a way to have

[21:22] some people under NDA really pressure testing these games and I'm worried that they're not. I really

[21:29] am worried that they're not. They clearly didn't do that with Guns N' Roses. They didn't even solve

[21:34] the problem. I don't think the problem's ever been solved to be honest. It's not like the new ones are

[21:38] great. And here we are. Like here we are. Are we going to see art around the posts? Are they going

[21:43] to fix this problem? We shall find out. But man, there must be a lot of anxiety over at Jersey

[21:49] Jack Pinball. Like we got to get this right and there is no margin of error this time around. Like

[21:54] this is it. But I still think they're sleeping on the market and I think now would be the best time

[21:59] for them to get a product out there. I think we're going to see a thousand collector's editions

[22:04] and I think it's going to be 500 buzz editions and 500 Woody editions. I think they're going to be

[22:10] $15,000 to $16,500. That's my guess. That Jersey Jack Pinball is going to charge $15,000 to $16,000

[22:18] for the CE. I think they're going to raise the price of the LE again. And if they're smart,

[22:24] and I hope they do this, if Jersey Jack is smart, they need to put a cap on the total number of

[22:31] games they'll make for each SKU and stop with this $5,000 LE nonsense. It absolutely cripples

[22:39] their manufacturing arm. They don't want to be making just one game for like two years straight.

[22:46] And the greatest way to alleviate that is just raise the price of the game. You're going to sell

[22:52] them all and just make them each more limited. The more limited you make your games, the more

[22:59] you can charge for them. I don't have a business degree, but I know that would work especially

[23:05] in this marketplace. So that's Toy Story. But then what is after Toy Story? Like what is Steve

[23:11] Richie's game? When is Eric Minier's godfather coming out? And then you've got the other designer

[23:17] who did Metroid. What's he working on? How do you have four designers at a company? Think about

[23:22] this for a minute. Four designers at a company that can't even get out two games in 18 months.

[23:29] Four designers. Stern has four designers, and then they each come out with a game every four

[23:33] months. It makes total sense. Jersey Jack Pinball is paying the salaries of people

[23:39] that are doing what? Like what is Steve Richie doing today? Is he running around sharpening

[23:45] pencils? Is he tweaking Pat Lawler's next game? What is he doing? Is he bringing his whitewoods

[23:51] from Stern? You have to look at the schedule and be like, how is his stuff even close? See,

[23:57] here's what I think is the problem over at Jersey Jack Pinball now. They have four designers,

[24:02] but they don't have four software teams working on games. Now think about that for a minute. Even

[24:08] if they design whitewoods, we all know that Keith Johnson and cats cannot handle probably two to

[24:17] three games a year. There's no way. And Keith Johnson is one of the slowest coders ever. Ask Jack

[24:24] Guinari who held up his machines. It wasn't just the designers. It was Keith. Now this was all in

[24:30] my episode 500 that Keith's inability to work quickly or even reach deadlines that were super

[24:37] long. He blew by them. And again, I get that Keith makes great deep code, but it takes forever.

[24:44] So think about that. If you've got the software department that is slow, it doesn't even matter

[24:50] if the design department is fast. And then we also know that the manufacturing wing is very slow.

[24:56] See, this is the problem with JJP. They're all out of sync. Like none of it makes sense. Like

[25:01] absolutely none of it makes sense. I would have done it like this. All they need are two designers.

[25:08] That's it. They just need two designers that are great. Eric Minier and Pat Lawler. Okay,

[25:13] two designers that are great. And then you need two software teams that are great working on each

[25:18] title. Then you need to release a new game every six months. So two games a year. And then those

[25:25] people who are in the design department can go on to their next game. And then you're a company

[25:30] that acts like a pinball company of your size. You come out with two games a year. Stern comes out

[25:36] with like four or five, maybe six sometimes. You come out with two games a year. It doesn't even

[25:40] have to be two games a year every six months. It could just be like, how about this? I'll make it

[25:44] even easier for Jersey Jack. Just every year you come out with a new game during the same time period.

[25:50] So let's just say October 5th is when Guns N' Roses came out. Then October 5th of the next year,

[25:56] Toy Story comes out. Then October 5th of the next year, you've got Godfather. Then the next October

[26:03] 5th, it's like the Matrix. Just one a year. Even that would be fine. But we're not even there.

[26:09] We're not even there. And that's not even that ambitious. So I just think things over at Jersey

[26:14] Jack Pinball continue to be a little bit of a sloppy mess. And I'm going to tell you why it is

[26:19] that way. They don't have their George Gomez. Who is the George Gomez over at JJP? Who's the one

[26:25] who knows what they're doing over there from a manufacturing standpoint? It's not Pat Lawler.

[26:30] Baldy Williams made him look great. He didn't do all that hard work. The people over at Baldy

[26:35] Williams did. So who is their George Gomez? Brett Abbas? Come on. He was handed the company by his

[26:41] dad. I mean, nephatism does not give you the know-how to run a pinball company. I just think

[26:47] that's the issue. And I think having an abundance of money is actually hurting Jersey Jack Pinball.

[26:53] You know what I mean? When you have an abundance of money and money is not the problem because

[26:57] you're a billionaire, then you don't need to stay on schedule. Then you don't have shareholders that

[27:02] need to be answered to. It actually makes you lazier. And I know that's like crazy to say this,

[27:08] but I think the Abbas money is actually working against Jersey Jack Pinball evolving. And again,

[27:14] this was in episode 500. All Jack Winari wanted was just some money to make it through the tough

[27:21] periods. He didn't want to lose the company to them. He didn't want to lose his company to Pat

[27:27] Lawler. He lost it to them. And now it's all being managed by them. And you can't tell me that

[27:33] they're doing a better job. I just don't think they are. I just don't think they are. And I think

[27:38] what would help Jersey Jack Pinball, I think they need like a CEO that's like their George Gomez,

[27:44] and they've never been able to put that person in place. It's not going to be Steve Ritchie.

[27:48] So we'll see. I wish I didn't even have to have this analysis of JJP. I wish I was talking about

[27:54] their next title. Guys, get it out. All right, we're going longer than normal here. All right,

[27:58] so let's talk about spooky pinball next. Look, I'm just going to say it. I know people think I've

[28:04] been really hard on this company. I've been unfairly looking at their games. There was a pinside comment

[28:09] last night where somebody said that Canada is ruining this game for everybody, that he's just

[28:15] a fool and he doesn't know what he's talking about. And these games are great. And I'm ruining the

[28:20] games for everybody. If you like Halloween and you enjoy this pinball machine, why do you care what

[28:27] I think? If you like Ultraman and you think the game is great, why would you care what I think?

[28:32] I don't have the power to ruin it. Like I'm not running over to people's houses as you start to

[28:38] play a game and I unplug your machine or I slam a sledgehammer through the play field. Like what

[28:43] am I, how am I ruining your experience? See, I think what's happening is this. I think ultimately

[28:49] these games are still a very big question mark on whether or not they're going to turn out to be great

[28:56] or whether or not they're just going to end up being a couple of mediocre pins. Because I think

[29:01] pinball is like that. Your game's either great and people talk about it for years and want one

[29:06] for years or people forget about it. And I think the jury is still out on this one. But I think

[29:13] deep down everyone realizes that Spooky should have launched these games way more polished. I don't

[29:18] think they're fixing the hedge multi-bots issue that I brought up. And I think people are realizing

[29:24] that this wasn't really what they wanted. Like they, I think they just wanted more in these games

[29:29] when they shipped. And I keep seeing people compare this to Rick and Morty. Let's just like

[29:34] stop with this BS. Rick and Morty is a much more popular theme than Halloween and Ultraman. Absolutely

[29:43] much more popular right now, much more contemporary. Rick and Morty had Scott Denisi on it. Had Scott

[29:49] Denisi music, had Scott Denisi light show. There's nothing in Halloween or Ultraman from a musical

[29:55] standpoint or a light show spectacular standpoint that is as good as Scott Denisi's Rick and Morty.

[30:02] Rick and Morty was one of the best theme integrated pinball machines ever with all of the clips and

[30:08] Justin's callouts. The best callouts may be in the history of pinball. That's the thing is like

[30:13] Rick and Morty did stuff super, super well. It wasn't the perfect game. It was a clunky shooter.

[30:18] But what it did do well, it did really well. And when you look at Ultraman and Halloween,

[30:24] I don't think there's anything that people are pointing at where it's like they did this really

[30:30] well. The theme integration is not done well. The clips are miniscule at best. The music is like

[30:37] all over the place sound wise. I get it's creepy in your basement. These games are never going to

[30:42] be the next Rick and Morty. The other thing is there's only 750 Rick and Mortys in the world ever,

[30:50] ever. There's 500 more Halloween's and there's like 500 Ultramans. Spooky Pinball did it in

[30:56] reverse. They should have made 1750 Rick and Mortys and 750 Halloween's and 250 Ultraman. You see what

[31:06] I'm saying? Like they're making more of a game that's not nearly as popular and then the game's

[31:11] not doing anything super special. You know, and then the elephant in the room is the people who

[31:16] worked on some of those previous spooky games are no longer there. So that is why people are anxious.

[31:24] That is why people can't even sell their $2,000 deposit spots for $500 people. People are taking

[31:32] a $1,500 bath on their deposit. Why is that? Is that because of Canada? Like one guy with a podcast

[31:40] behind the paywall, which by the way, we're at 386 club members people, we're not declining. It's

[31:47] great. All the haters out there, they can't stand this fact that this is working and we're still

[31:52] controlling the narrative. I mean, look over at the Haggis thread. If it wasn't for my shows,

[31:57] that Haggis thread does not blow up, but let's get back to spooky. It's like nobody wants to be

[32:02] accountable for why this is happening, for why these games during the hottest pinball market

[32:08] ever. This is the hottest the pinball market has ever been and you can't give away your spots for

[32:14] Halloween or Ultraman. So you could blame Canada or you could actually say, why is this happening?

[32:23] Why is it that I'm losing 1500 bucks on a machine that's new in box? When a stern machine, if I had

[32:31] it new in box, I'm making 1500 to $2,000 right now. And look, that's it. That's all it comes down to.

[32:39] And all you owners who have a Halloween that want to cheerlead, it doesn't matter what you're saying

[32:45] because the market is what's objective, not you. You're a fanboy who owns it. I don't care if you

[32:52] think it's great. The market doesn't. It's not Canada. It's the market and the market doesn't lie.

[32:58] And the market is objective. You're not objective. You are a subjective fanboy of the company. And so

[33:08] when all is said and done, my questions about these games and my criticisms of how they launch

[33:15] these games has been more accurate than your fanboy excuses. And spooky pinball is not going to get

[33:24] better if you keep blowing smoke up their asses. And I was in the thread last night and people

[33:30] were saying that this new design team over at Spooky is one of the best new design teams that's

[33:36] in pinball. Okay, blow that smoke up their butts and see what happens. See what happens with the

[33:43] next game. That's not the feedback they need to hear. The most valuable feedback they need to hear

[33:49] is why people are trying to get rid of their games, why people won't even buy the games. I saw

[33:56] someone say like, well, I could see why the tournament players don't like it because the game

[34:00] doesn't shoot traditionally well. I could see why these people don't like it because they don't like

[34:04] the theme. Are we really at the point now where the best pinball players in the world are now being

[34:11] ignored because all they care about is gameplay? This is a machine that's all about gameplay.

[34:18] You can't just ignore it or chalk them up as tournament people who don't like stuff like this.

[34:24] It's not just hardcore tournament players. There's a lot of things in these games that at the white

[34:29] wood stage probably should have been corrected and it is what it is. Now look, I'm just going to

[34:35] tell you right now. I'm going to wait until this game is done to do my final review. And the last

[34:40] point I'll say is this. People are saying I'm mad. This is the funniest criticism of Canada. I'm mad

[34:45] that the prices are going down because I can't do a quick flip that I wanted to do. How dumb are

[34:51] people? If I wanted to quickly flip in Ultraman, why would I buy the last one on the line? Why?

[35:00] Wouldn't I have bought number 50, not number 500? I'm not trying to quickly flip this game. That was

[35:07] never my plan. And if I wanted to do a quick flip, I would have. And so that's not why I'm upset.

[35:14] I'm upset because I think Spooky Pinball was nowhere near ready to release these games when

[35:19] they did. And I think they put them out there way too early. And I don't think people want to be on

[35:25] this journey with Spooky. I don't. I don't think they want to wait every two months to get another

[35:30] code update. I think Spooky should have had these games further along. I think they should have hired

[35:35] people to make these games be further along. And I think they're learning a lesson. And I bet you

[35:40] the next Spooky game is not going to come out this incomplete. They're not liking this people.

[35:46] This feedback, this is not what they're used to. They're used to like being the bells of the

[35:51] ball, not anymore. And to get their goodwill back, their next game needs to be like almost done on

[35:58] launch day. And they need to take these millions from these two games and hire enough people so that

[36:03] the next title is done on day one. I'm sorry. Yeah, you can polish it, but we're not talking

[36:09] polish. Like they put a totally incomplete game into the world and they need to stop that. All

[36:14] right, well, at least they put a game into the world. Chicago Gaming Company. Where is the game?

[36:19] Where is Cactus Canyon? You know, I went into the thread and we're still deconstructing

[36:23] Ryan White's abysmal launch of this game at Pinball Expo. Where's the game? Like it's going

[36:29] to be March and no Cactus Canyon's will even have gone to customers. So why did they reveal it so

[36:35] early? Really strange. CGC is a company to me that's just so hard to get excited about. I have

[36:42] the opportunity to find out what Ben Hex next game is, right? I don't even care. I don't even care.

[36:47] Because when is it going to be? When is Ben Hex next game? When is Mark Richie's Pulp Fiction

[36:51] coming out? This company, they don't do anything. It's like years go by and then they remake a game.

[36:58] Now we're not going to get Lyman sheets on the code of this game. I'm just like, I don't know. I

[37:02] think CGC is a company where this is like clearly not their main priority. It's not where they need

[37:08] to make money. Like Churchill cabinets makes so much money that this is just like a pet side project

[37:15] to them and it shows. And so look, I hope you get your games, but I'm hearing now that Cactus

[37:20] Canyon is still like six to eight weeks out, two more months and you're still not going to have it.

[37:26] I almost bet you that nobody is going to have their Cactus Canyon's by TPF, which is pathetic. It

[37:31] really is pathetic and they never should have launched it if they knew that they had supply

[37:37] chain issues or delays on parts. Then why launch the game? All right. So look, Haggis Pimbal,

[37:44] still no update, still no pictures, still nothing new to talk about.

[37:48] Canade is the bad guy. I hope they get their people, their fathoms. That's it. There's nothing new to

[37:54] say. Damien owes customers games and the pressure is mounting. If I'm them, you know, you kind of

[38:01] want to make sure you get games before TPF, but I want to give Damien and Marty and all of them

[38:06] some advice right now. And they should take this advice. You've been delayed nine months. You've

[38:13] burned through money you weren't expecting to burn. You are now a company. This isn't a personal

[38:19] project anymore. You took people's money. They should not travel to TPF. There is no reason

[38:26] this company should spend money on airline tickets or shipping games to TPF. You don't need to sell

[38:33] more fathoms. You sold them all, but they're still going to do it. And this is the mistake all these

[38:38] companies made. Dutch Pimbal made it. Highway made it. You're going to spend tens of thousands of

[38:44] dollars to fly to Texas to what? To just get padded on the back, shake hands, kiss babies,

[38:51] and take credit for your great bill quality. But you shouldn't do that. You should stay behind

[38:57] and make the games because if you're over here, then who's doing the game manufacturing? And they

[39:02] all do it. They all make the mistake. They all want to do their victory lap, but it's just going to

[39:08] put the company deeper in the financial hole. And let's see. I don't want to see him at Texas.

[39:15] I don't think we should see them at Texas because they need to make up for some of the lost ground.

[39:19] And they're going to come though. This is the thing. Ego is the hardest thing to overcome

[39:24] with all of these Pimbal companies. They want to be with the crowds. But if you don't have anything

[39:30] new to sell, it's a waste of money to be with the crowds. So Dutch Pimbal, I finally saw someone

[39:37] got their EA machine. I think it was EA number 71. That's great. Not seeing too many of them.

[39:43] The Big Lebowski still, you know, I love it. I just don't see myself ever owning one because

[39:49] they just seem so problematic. I'd be nervous. I would just be nervous. I would want to have to

[39:54] buy a backup of every part. But I still think it's the greatest world under glass since I've been

[39:59] covering Pimbal without a doubt. I think Barry's one of the most creative designers ever. I think

[40:04] it shows what you can make when you're passionate about a theme and you don't even care about bomb

[40:10] and you put everything you want into a game. And it's sad to me that here we are and it's like

[40:15] nine years later, like it was 2013, nine years later. And we have not seen that many Pimbal

[40:21] machines that even come close to putting the world under glass like the Big Lebowski did.

[40:26] And that's why this hobby to me, people, it's fun to cover. But man, there's not much progress.

[40:31] There's not much innovation. You're not getting that much for your money. So that's why I would

[40:35] stop chasing after these things as if like they're the second coming of Pimbal. They're really not.

[40:40] We're sort of just taking what we get. They're not really giving us like that magical thing we

[40:45] should be getting for this much money. What's left on Pony Factory? I don't think there's anything

[40:50] there. Deeproot is having an auction. Who knows what they're going to auction off. I bet those

[40:55] Razas, this is my guess. I bet those Razas prototypes are going to end up with Yilo Bird.

[41:00] He was obsessed. He bought like number one and two. He paid in fall. I bet you Yilo Bird ends up.

[41:08] He worked some backdoor deal with Bobby Mueller to get those Razas prototypes. That's just my

[41:13] guess. I've never seen a guy that wanted them so badly. And finally we have Homepin probably

[41:19] arguably easily. Maybe yes. So the worst Pimbal manufacturer on the planet makes everybody else's

[41:27] efforts look good. You know if you're like spooky right now you really want Spinal Tap to come out.

[41:33] It will take the attention away from your games right now. We are starting to see some pictures

[41:38] of Spinal Tap being put together. And in an idiotic decision the volume meter on the amp,

[41:44] which is supposed to go to 11, they showed a picture of the back of the lightboard and volume

[41:50] 11 is in the middle of the dial. It's not all the way past 10, which absolutely ruins the entire joke

[41:58] that it goes to 11. I can't wait to see this Pimbal machine because it's going to look so like out of

[42:05] place next to all these modern pins that are incredible. And I don't know why Mike did this.

[42:11] I don't know why he decided to make a Pimbal company. I don't know why he sunk all this money

[42:16] into this effort. He's also not the most likable guy. And so you put all this together like you

[42:21] make a crappy machine. You don't win people over with your personality. And then you go get Spinal

[42:27] Tap, which some people consider a dream theme. And I think it's going to be a complete and utter

[42:32] disaster. I mean it's got an orange DMD with a 27 inch color LCD above it. I could tell you right

[42:40] now without even seeing the game, that's a horrible decision. So I can't wait to see it because it's

[42:46] going to give us all, I think it's going to unite all of us. I think we're all collectively going to

[42:50] come together and just point and laugh at Spinal Tap. Everybody, thank you for being a club member.

[42:55] This has been Canadian Spinball Podcast. We went a little bit longer today, but you know, I just

[42:59] wanted to drop what's in my head onto the show right now. We'll be back with more episodes and make

[43:05] sure you come tomorrow to hang out at the Saturday morning spectacular. I'll talk to you soon.
