[00:00] Welcome everybody to episode 469 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts on your host, Canada.

[00:21] Thank you for joining on this episode.

[00:23] We're going to talk to Jerry Stelemberg all about his new game, Heist.

[00:27] Very, very cool world under glass.

[00:29] I think this took a lot of people by surprise how much he's put into this P3 game.

[00:34] Very, very exciting and we're going to talk all about the game.

[00:37] A couple news items before we air the interview.

[00:40] American Pinball has announced that they are ceasing manufacturing right now because of

[00:45] the pandemic we're all experiencing.

[00:48] So does spooky pinball.

[00:49] They can't get their parts from pinball life in Chicago, Illinois.

[00:53] So after they build the games they have in their warehouse, they're no longer going to

[00:57] be able to make Rick and Morty's until the restrictions are lifted on these companies

[01:02] in Chicago.

[01:04] And so we're in a new period now.

[01:07] It's crazy right that they announced Hot Wheels and then a week or two later they can't

[01:10] even make the game.

[01:11] What a horrible, what a horrible calamity that is to fall on American pinball shoulders

[01:16] right now.

[01:17] How do you stay in business if you can't even make the products that you just reveal to

[01:22] the world because we all know the hype window.

[01:25] The window in which to secure all your sales, it's very small in pinball and to now have

[01:31] this happen could be a catastrophic thing for American pinball spooky pinball is going

[01:36] to be okay because Charlie already pre sold every single Rick and Morty he did it right.

[01:42] Now we're just going to have to get used to this that manufacturing of pinballs will be

[01:46] on hold and will be on hiatus and I don't think anyone out there really cares that they're

[01:51] not going to get their pinball machines.

[01:53] We have a lot more important things we're facing.

[01:55] I mean I'm in the epicenter in New York City of this global pandemic.

[01:59] I think right now we have 12,000 cases in New York and nobody's really getting tested

[02:05] which is scary.

[02:06] So it's probably much, much higher than that.

[02:08] I'm not leaving my apartment.

[02:10] I'm staying safe and there's no reason to go out.

[02:12] Brenda goes out dressed like an Inja every once in a while to get some essential food

[02:16] items but that's it.

[02:18] I can't even get sick because I have weak lungs right now with my broken ribs.

[02:21] So I'm taking this very, very seriously and if you're listening to this please do the

[02:26] same for your family and if you're on pinside spreading all this fake news about it's

[02:31] going to be over in 10 days and everyone's over reacting you're being a moron.

[02:36] Okay, stopping an idiot.

[02:38] Stop.

[02:39] Turn off the Fox News people.

[02:40] Get smart.

[02:41] All right.

[02:42] So Jerry's going to talk all about heist.

[02:43] You're going to hear that Dennis Nornman.

[02:45] I launched this on my Facebook page.

[02:48] Dennis Nornman has left deep root pinball and he's now over at Chicago gaming company.

[02:53] I mean this guy jumps around and around and around.

[02:55] He's a really nice guy but his ability to finish a project with a company.

[03:01] It just seems to be his story as of the last like bunch of years.

[03:05] He was at Jersey Jack pinball in 2011.

[03:08] I just saw this photo of him and Jack.

[03:10] I'm like what is Dennis Nornman doing at Jersey Jack?

[03:12] He's at deep root most recently.

[03:14] Now he's at Chicago gaming.

[03:16] He was with Andrew Highway.

[03:18] He did the pitch and back game.

[03:20] He did the Elvira game that's now at Stern.

[03:22] It's just he's all over the place.

[03:24] Very prolific pinball designer and I think Dennis suffers from one thing.

[03:28] I think he gets very frustrated when companies are delayed and very slow in getting products

[03:34] out the door.

[03:35] I kind of feel like he wishes the world would go back to the Valley Williams days and

[03:38] when she could go in and do his design job and everyone else could do their job around

[03:44] them and actually get stuff made.

[03:47] He strikes me as a guy that wants to get stuff made and wants people to take care of business

[03:51] and unfortunately he keeps ending up in all these places that have extreme delays and

[03:56] he probably gets tired of waiting around.

[03:58] Now I've always wondered about this whole thing of well why do some people end up under

[04:03] the wing of George Gomez and others don't?

[04:07] And I've just come to the conclusion that George Gomez has everybody he wants working

[04:11] for him and pinball working for him.

[04:14] If you're not working for George Gomez there probably is a reason why you're not.

[04:19] If you are a very talented pinball designer.

[04:21] I don't know what it is because if I'm a designer or if I'm an artist or if I'm a pinball

[04:26] anything wouldn't you want to be at the company that actually makes games frequently and gives

[04:33] you assignments and briefs and allows your creative freedom to be expressed at least once

[04:39] a year.

[04:40] I mean I know but here's the flip side of the coin is while Stern might give you that

[04:45] creative freedom they're also going to force you to make the cheapest game possible.

[04:49] So that's the rub is these designers I think at Deeproot are probably having a lot more

[04:53] fun having the ability to put a lot more into their games but where are they?

[04:59] Where are they?

[05:00] Here we are five years later we're still waiting for Raza I don't know.

[05:02] Alright you got to hear from Julia on the last episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[05:07] I love that she completely completely like did a 180 on everyone thinking she was this

[05:11] big heavy fat old man trying to rip everyone off so I if you haven't listened to Julia's

[05:16] interview with canada I think you'll really enjoy it.

[05:18] So it's always great to get the female perspective on the hobby we thank her for joining the

[05:22] show and everyone remember a week from yesterday the twippies are going to be next Saturday

[05:28] night.

[05:29] Now I don't know if everyone knows how to watch the twippies and let me tell you right now

[05:32] because we're super excited I think everyone needs this moment to celebrate the best

[05:36] in pinball and I hope we win the third twippy for best pinball pockets and if we do if we

[05:42] do there's going to be a special treat for all of you fans out there of canada's pinball

[05:46] pockets I think you're going to love I think you're going to love my what I've done.

[05:52] Okay if I win it only you only see it if I win I think you're going to love it.

[05:55] I don't know I don't know the outcome no one will say anything as much as I'm trying

[05:59] to bribe Jeff in the committee over there to let me know the outcome they will not they

[06:03] will not let me know anything but the way you watch the twippies this year it's going

[06:07] to be on YouTube premiere it's everyone can access it on YouTube it's like a live

[06:12] YouTube show and it's going to be on carry hardies link now there will be a link to that

[06:17] in the in all the communications on this week in pimples website I'm also going to put

[06:23] a link to it on canada pinball podcast Facebook page and what I'll do is I'll start to put

[06:28] the link to it on the the note section of my podcast but it's next Saturday night 8 30

[06:34] PM Eastern standard time this week in pinball twippy awards in which we honor the best in

[06:40] pinball and I think right now because everyone is virtual everyone is remote it's going

[06:45] to be an amazingly fun time to watch the show and I think can and the flipping out stream

[06:51] are going to do a fun red carpet event in which people are going to call in and talk

[06:55] about it and I think they're going to do a pre and a post sort of game show on that

[06:59] game joy post show on the twippies on flipping out stream so also that'll be a fun hangout

[07:05] for everyone out there everyone let's get through this together let's enjoy pinball

[07:09] let's enjoy talking about pinball I know we're all suffering in different ways but hopefully

[07:13] this podcast can be a little bit of a quantum of solace as we all go on lockdown and stay

[07:18] safe in America everyone Jerry Stelanberg ladies and gentlemen the creator the founder

[07:23] of p3 multi morphec mr. Jerry Stelanberg Jerry welcome back to the show thanks Chris

[07:28] good to see you again I wish it was under better global situations and we'll talk about

[07:33] that but today's a huge day for you today you showed the world the game you've been working

[07:38] on the heist how does it feel to finally reveal this game to everyone oh jeez I've been

[07:45] pumping it up for a while I'm super excited about the game I'm super excited about what

[07:48] the team's done I'm super excited to see what people think of it and obviously to see

[07:52] some orders come in overall it's I mean it's been a long project and something we've put

[07:57] our hearts and souls into so it's it's a huge way off our shoulders to get it out there

[08:01] and now it's hopefully some fun times getting some out supporting so as I look at this game

[08:08] Jerry I mean this is by far the most ambitious thing we've ever seen on the platform I'm hearing

[08:14] people say on my Facebook page this is what p3 should have been all along which is kind

[08:20] of like a great compliment that do you feel that way that this sort of showcases the full potential

[08:26] of p3 so I'd never want to say full potential because there are lots of things we still think we

[08:32] can do and want to do with the platform but the way I describe this to people I talked to recently

[08:37] is up until now we've had essentially one traditional type of pinball game in a lot of other things

[08:46] many games or different ideas the racing game things for children things for none pinheads

[08:52] and so we've wanted to from I'm based on feedback from the community create more pinhead

[08:59] games games that you know pinball enthusiasts would enjoy so we recently came out with version 2.0

[09:05] of cosmic heart racing which adds traditional pinball rules to that making that hopefully something

[09:10] that traditional pinball lovers will enjoy and yeah this game we we kind of threw the kitchen

[09:15] sink and we wanted to create something that people would go wow and hopefully convinced them that

[09:21] the p3 makes sense right and I'm looking at it right now pulling up the photos the heist and

[09:26] but this is you know me I love a world under glass and talk to me about let's talk about the story

[09:33] of the game and then I want to talk about the world you brought to life with this title so the heist

[09:38] what what is the storyline of the game that people are going to be experiencing

[09:43] yeah so it's called highest to know the it's a single word name okay we so Steven Silver came up with

[09:53] the story behind the game basically it's this bad guy mr. Big Frank Bigelow he took over this city

[10:00] called ocean city he owns everything in the city he owns all the businesses he owns the

[10:04] policemen he he's your stereotypical kingpin in a city and as a traditional high story goes there's

[10:12] a crew of of either small time operators or whatever usually brought together by some kind of a

[10:18] mastermind character and they all come together each one has a specialty and they all kind of team

[10:23] up to to fight back and to try to pull one over on mr. Bigg reminding you a little grand theft

[10:28] order right with this sort of mob boss sort of overseeing the city and and so as the player who do

[10:36] you play as are you are you building your your group of detectives who what yeah lock us through

[10:42] like who the player is in this game yeah you're not actually representing a specific character you're

[10:47] kind of coordinating the activities of all the characters so your goal as the player is to

[10:53] uh... shoot each character to collect the character

[10:56] uh... to assemble your crew so each time you it you collect a character you run a character job whether

[11:02] it's the wheel man's job you're you're you know driving a race car away from the the police after a

[11:09] a small time crime or something um you have to collect the safe cracker you have to collect the

[11:13] weapons expert you have to collect the mastermind himself or herself in this case so basically the

[11:19] ball is a conduit for progress of all the characters gotcha now this this group of people are they

[11:25] are they law enforcement no these are your stereotypical heist um small time criminals or or you

[11:34] know these are the good guy criminals where they they they are smart they're intelligent they try to

[11:41] coordinate their activities to go against the bad guy gotcha okay i think oceans eleven it's

[11:45] basically exactly like ocean eleven or okay any any stereotypical heist movie they all kind of

[11:50] have the same theme gotcha that makes total sense now thinking about it like that so i'm looking at

[11:55] this there's a lot in this game Jerry so how did you go from i read that you did a focus group i

[12:02] have to say i was a little hurt i wasn't part of your focus group for theme what happened there

[12:07] you did but you you focus group this right and you had a bunch of themes that you were considering

[12:12] how did you land on on heist so we had basically all of the team members suggested their favorite ideas

[12:20] or their favorite multiple ideas we had a group of about uh 20 random ideas from everybody and we

[12:27] we willed it down so we basically had everybody propose what the theme was and they crafted a little

[12:34] story and they kind of decided kind of the main play field features this story would need and then

[12:40] we all voted we got the set of ideas whittled down to about ten and that's when we talked to other

[12:47] people outside the company to see what they would want right and unanimously you said that this

[12:55] one rose to the top yeah it wasn't unanimous but it was the the clear majority for sure okay now

[13:02] you've then you pick the theme what was the next step well how did you then determine

[13:08] how to bring this world to life using the platform so honestly it wasn't me i specifically made

[13:15] the choice on this game to take myself out of the obviously i wasn't fully disconnected but

[13:22] i didn't want to be the one pulling the strings the one deciding what the play field should look

[13:25] like or what the story should be because all the other games are kind of me

[13:30] introducing different ideas to pinball and i didn't i didn't want my influence to take this away

[13:37] from what we needed to be which is a traditional type of pinball game on the p3 that was at hard

[13:43] because i i i i i commend you for that because i think sometimes the hardest thing for a leader to do

[13:48] is sometimes step aside and let the team go it's hard in certain ways and easy in other ways i

[13:58] mean i i work my butt off for this company and i've done it for years and i'll continue doing it

[14:02] for years but at some point it's nice to be able to set aside and rely on people who know what

[14:10] they're doing to do the things that they want to do so for this particular game we had a you know

[14:16] we have mechanical engineers software engineers we have our creative guys doing our videos and our

[14:22] artwork and those kind of things and i basically put it out there what do you guys want to do what do

[14:25] you see your role in this game being and i asked for volunteers to be the creative director

[14:32] and steven silver stepped up he is the brain behind all of our creative videos you know all the video

[14:38] promotions that we've done over the years steven silver created for him or created them so he

[14:43] stepped up he offered to do it we had volunteers from the software team to be the software lead

[14:48] of bj wilson took that role and i was frankly happy to give it to them i mean i'm never going to be

[14:55] fully disconnected like i said i i have pretty strong opinions when when things come down to a choice

[15:01] and they can't decide that i make it for him right or if i see something happening in the design of

[15:06] the game that i just don't like or i don't think we'll resonate with pinball people then then i'll

[15:11] voice my opinion and occasionally i'll put my foot down but generally speaking this is steven

[15:15] silver's baby well how do what are the steps is the first step you have the heist you have your theme

[15:22] do you then map out the storyline and then go and say okay we're going to need a police station

[15:28] we're going to need a grand central station we're going to need this how does it work how do you get

[15:33] to the idea into the physical form i think i can work either way i think there are a lot of games

[15:39] that are designed where someone has an idea of what a mech they want of what mech they want or

[15:44] or some kind of a layout idea and then they they push that into a theme but we did it the other way

[15:49] yeah we started with the story steven came up with the story he came up with the characters he came

[15:53] up with the bad guy he figured out what he wanted the bad guy to represent in the city and then he

[15:58] decided where he wanted the game to be played which in this case turns out to be the city scaper the

[16:04] you know it you can see all the buildings and the roads and the backdrop of the city so once he had

[16:11] all that figured out it was pretty straightforward process to come up with the decorations for the

[16:18] playfield what things would look like yes of course police stations and banks and all the typical

[16:23] things that you think you would need in a heist theme places to steal stuff money or paintings or

[16:31] roads to get your getaway driver to to drive through those roads think of all the things you

[16:36] would want in the build in the city and then we had mr. big who sits in his big office building and

[16:41] he he owns the casino so there's a casino in the in the playfield and those things just kind of came

[16:46] out of the idea well let's start with the the mechanism that obviously is getting all the attention

[16:52] and and and the crane in this game which I know is what you've been alluding to as one of the most

[16:56] versatile mechanisms in the history of pinball talk about tell me tell me I oversold it well I have

[17:03] a playdead it looks very cool and and it's doing a lot and it does way more than my Batman crane did

[17:08] so I do think this is by far the best crane mech we've seen in a game so this thing can go left right

[17:15] up down forward back has a magnet has a you can actually bash it right it's it's doing a lot

[17:24] yeah so it basically can take a ball from not any part of the playfield but but it picks up balls

[17:32] from the lock position it can move them in front of the player it can drop them into other areas of

[17:36] the playfield it can present the ball in different ways it can drop the ball in the playfield it can

[17:44] try to throw the ball to the out lanes it can try to drop the ball straight down the middle

[17:48] it can present a ball to you think I missed multi-ball in Dracula where there's a magnet on the playfield

[17:53] and it drags a ball across the playfield you have to hit it off to start your multi-ball well this

[17:57] can do exactly that just from the opposite side you know it carries the ball from the top it can

[18:02] move it across the screen screen so you're gonna fall off it as well as there's a way to like start

[18:09] a multi-ball yeah we have a crane multi-ball that starts that way if you hit it off then you get a

[18:14] three ball multi-ball if you don't hit it off I think it times out and drops it and you get a two-ball

[18:18] multi-ball so we're just so used to in pinball and you know you listen to the show hopefully still

[18:24] Jerry we're so used to so little mechanical creativity happening in this industry and one of the

[18:31] things I always harp on is where has the mechanical magic gone and and this thing is super cool so how

[18:38] long did it take to get this thing right well you heard me talking about it how long ago was that a

[18:44] year ago yeah we've been working on it that entire time it's a complex device we but a lot of it's

[18:54] founded or grounded in the mechanics used in other things for example the extension of retraction

[19:01] is a stepper motor with devices commonly found in your 3d printers or your CNC routers these days

[19:09] so the actual underlying technology or the mechanism the the mechanical parts of it we didn't have

[19:15] to create them all from scratch we kind of made use of pre-existing things the up and down and the

[19:21] side to side are off the shelf servos that are commonly used in remote control cars to control the

[19:28] the wheels going left and right so the technologies there putting it together in a package that you

[19:33] could bash and it's going to be reliable that's that's what took the long time right because we

[19:38] had our prototype working when I talked to you last that was a year ago and it wasn't reliable at

[19:42] the time but over the course of the year it became a lot more reliable right it's kind of like our

[19:47] flippers honestly you know the floating flippers that back in the day were were cool but they were

[19:52] super flaky and if you flipped real hard for a while they would the rod would snap or the flipper

[19:58] would get loose it just takes time to dial that stuff in now speaking of flippers the other thing

[20:05] that I've noticed is you've added an upper right flipper to this game yes and this is this is

[20:12] part of the ice package but also something people can add to their existing p3 platform correct

[20:18] yes so it's a backwards compatible replacement for the existing side targ get module which means

[20:24] you pull out the existing side target module you put in this one and once this is in there it works

[20:30] it can work in the exact same way your old one did meaning the ball can roll down and

[20:36] roll down the rail or roll down where the flipper is and it'll work just like your old one did

[20:41] so for a game like Lexi or cosmic heart racing you simply won't be able to activate it but the

[20:46] ball will still roll down the rail just like it did before for a game like heist where we integrate

[20:51] it into gameplay and we design the play field around it so there are there's a side loop shot and

[20:55] there are targets and other things you can shoot with it then we obviously enable it in software

[20:59] okay and it looks like because I've been talking a lot about upper right flipper shots that

[21:05] that are clunky and don't work and Rick and Morty this thing looks like it's got a really nice

[21:10] smooth path down the road here of this blazing target right it looks like that is that how many

[21:14] shots are coming off of this upper right flipper so with the upper right flipper you can hit the

[21:19] side loop you can hit the targets that surround the side loop you can get the inner left loop with it

[21:26] and just because of the way the spin works on a pinball you can actually get it to go up the left

[21:31] ramp though we don't have any software that awards you for doing that and I'm looking at the

[21:36] photos right now Jerry this game looks like these shots are makeable like it is when you guys are

[21:41] designing do you do you want to make a game that's accessible and not going to be frustratingly tight

[21:47] like how do you approach what's what's fun and also what's not too easy right because you don't

[21:52] want to game people's game times to be forever how do you find that balance of making the shots just

[21:58] the right amount of difficulty I mean it really comes down to how much you want to squeeze under

[22:03] your play field right there are some play fields that you want to squeeze nine or ten shots because

[22:07] you want to give certain variety I mean I've seen games that do that and if you only have five or

[22:11] six shots then those shots are going to be super wide and easy to hit so the number seven eight nine

[22:17] those are kind of common numbers for play fields we have basically eight shots in this play field but

[22:25] seven of them face the front so a seven shot play field isn't too hard if you divide the width

[22:30] of a play field by seven you can create you know a two and a half inch gap for for most of them

[22:36] which allows you the freedom to to position them where you can make most of the shots pretty easily

[22:42] but I mean it sounds technical but it's all math really the more you put the tighter it's going to get

[22:48] the fewer you put the easier it's going to get right now I'm I'm loving the sculpts of these buildings

[22:54] yeah who who helped you with with that part of the game that was a process we uh we obviously in our

[23:01] previous games we didn't spend a ton of money on creating that that immersive world under glass

[23:07] experience we created toys like the ball lock and lexie or or the rings and the led system and ccr

[23:14] but this was a new experience for us we actually went through a few different vendors to get to our

[23:19] final solution um they look really nice and thank you I'm looking at them and there's also it looks

[23:26] like they light up to some of the signs within the different different buildings is that correct

[23:31] yeah actually every sign in the game is backed by an RGB led or more than one um every not every but

[23:39] most of the window faces are actually lined with leds as well so we can create different environments

[23:45] we can make it feel like daytime or nighttime we can light up or turn off the the signs when

[23:50] certain shots are enabled and we have a lock sign there's a there's a lock and key building that

[23:56] we can we can flash that when lock is lit and yeah yeah our goal in this was obviously to create the

[24:01] decorations to make it an immersive and experience but also to use those buildings as um not shot

[24:09] inserts but to allow you to use them as uh identifiers for windows shoot certain things

[24:14] very cool you know my favorite image I'm looking at on this week in pinball if for those of you

[24:19] listening to this show I know it's always hard to describe something that's very visual please go

[24:25] to this week in pinball and look up the photos of heist by p3 multi morph because Jeff has a gif

[24:31] going of the game which is my favorite because I mean we're talking about the was it the lower or

[24:37] the back one third of the game is that the right number yeah that's about what that's about right

[24:43] and then I'm looking at the screen as the play field where we're sort of hovering over the city

[24:49] and it looks like you're looking down almost like you're flying over the city uh super cool use of

[24:57] of the screen and giving you that sense of depth which is something that no standard play field could do

[25:03] I think Jerry how proud of you when you see this coming to life do you feel like this is really

[25:09] sort of hitting the potential because this this is to me pulling me into this world more than any

[25:16] the other p3 games yeah of course obviously as an engineer I feel like we've created a system a

[25:24] platform in environment where you can create this kind of content but until we brought in people

[25:29] like Stephen and um the artist Jose Fernandez and we have a new audio guy we have our our other

[25:36] artists Roycer Nuda and um we needed all these people to work together and to create or work

[25:44] together with the goal of creating this fully immersive experience we knew we could but it takes time

[25:49] and talented people to make this stuff happen right now who did the animations for for this world and

[25:55] and what's on the screen so Jose Fernandez created all the assets he's an illustrator he drew the

[26:01] the the characters and the items on the screen but Stephen Stephen still were the designer of the game

[26:06] he is an animator by trade so that's what he does and he did it very very cool and

[26:14] I mean interestingly actually started in a rough he and David Van S the animator and other

[26:22] things for spooky they actually work together as an artist back in Houston okay so they're all tied

[26:29] into the pitbull industry together so this game is available starting today we shipped a unit on

[26:37] Wednesday to a location or to a home to the first paid customer it was to a home okay now I I

[26:46] know you must be super bummed out as is everybody that tpf was canceled so talk to me about what

[26:54] what hearing that news was for you and how that impacts your ability to sort of get this game

[26:59] in front of people right now yeah so I mean obviously the whole world's going through kind of a

[27:05] big problem right now we had huge plans for the show and hooked us up with a good time slot for

[27:12] the seminar actually before the show opened so we would have a captive audience of lots of people

[27:17] that would see the game hopefully right before the show opened then we planned on having a bunch of

[27:22] machines there to play as well as a bunch of new unboxed machines that people could just take home

[27:27] so we structured our entire production run in or lead in to tpf to get machines ready to get games

[27:34] built into basically use this show as a launching point and we always planned on announcing it

[27:41] today and we actually planned on having jack danger down in austin on monday to stream it so people

[27:47] around the world could see what it is and get excited about it and then people could play it for

[27:50] the first time at tpf so not having tpf while it didn't screw up our launch plans and obviously

[27:57] hurts a lot on getting the word out and getting people excited about the game because the hope the

[28:03] hope was that people would react like you are but they'd react like that after they played it

[28:08] and they would talk about it they would tell their friends everybody would come over they

[28:12] you know they'd post about it they'd say how cool it was and then all this all this question about

[28:16] wow it looks cool but will it play well that would be answered right and so speaking of that when

[28:22] could we expect a stream of the game so i know when we talked before my plan was to still stream it

[28:29] on monday but since then we've made the choice locally to not have our people go into the office

[28:37] as much we're running one person in the factory at a time and we're not getting together as you know

[28:42] as in social events to do streaming i plan on setting up a stream here at some point we have

[28:49] customers that are going to get the play field that will stream for us but i can't give you a fixed

[28:52] date right now just because everything so much influx i have an idea okay why don't you send a game

[29:00] to jack danger let's talk about it i mean i've talked about and that way because he's because his

[29:08] streaming business is about to explode with views because everything's going to be streamed for

[29:13] the foreseeable future that way he could play it he could show to people and you can get orders

[29:21] that would be great um yeah obviously jack was a big part of our launch plans he he had reserved

[29:26] his plane ticket to austin he was playing on hanging out with us for a couple days before he went

[29:30] up to tpf so i mean jack's jack's a big part of our plans we love the guy he was interested in the

[29:35] the machine super excited about the game so yeah we're certainly talking to him we're talking to a

[29:39] bunch of people but um yeah there's just so much influx right now it's hard to say yeah and let's

[29:44] talk about that because you're right the whole world is upside down right now and everyone's plans

[29:49] that have been disrupted obviously most major life plans are are in front of things like pinball

[29:56] right now was there any was there any thoughts of just delaying it or do you or does that how are

[30:03] you sort of processing what to do yeah it's tough i mean i don't know if there's a right answer

[30:08] and a wrong answer here or but Patrick patla our new marketing guy Jim patla's brother another guy

[30:13] in pinball who's been there for a long time um we talked a lot about this and we were trying to figure

[30:18] out if it makes sense to defer if it makes sense to launch now if it makes sense to launch without tpf

[30:25] there are lots of reasons to launch there are lots of reasons to delay the biggest problem with

[30:29] delaying is you don't know when it's going to get better so we could say let's not launch now let's

[30:36] launch in two or three weeks and in two or three weeks it might be worse than it is now you just

[30:41] don't know so as a small company we have to we either have to you know completely pause operations

[30:48] or we have to bring in money yep and the only way to bring in money is to sell products i completely

[30:54] understand the dilemma and i don't think there are going to be any shows for a while and i think if

[31:00] you listen to the experts on when on how long people are going to be quarantined and social distancing

[31:07] it's going to be a while we we know that mgc's been cancelled uh pinberg will be cancelled

[31:14] and so all in town was cancelled so i think there's going to be a lot of people watching pinball online

[31:20] and so jerry that being the case is the plan it sounds like people are going to have to start selling

[31:27] games with virtual introductions of the games and and that's just going to be every company's facing

[31:33] this right jerry not just you i mean stern stern is delaying they were supposed to show heavy metal

[31:38] today um jersey jack everyone's going through the same thing and i think everyone feels for all the

[31:43] manufacturers out there who wanted to get their games in front of people at tpf so we might see a stream

[31:50] maybe jerry in like a week or so maybe i'm gonna have a rig here in three days hopefully hopefully

[31:57] i'll be able to set it up and stream it but if i don't we have customers that will have the game

[32:00] and has streaming rigs um it's it's just a matter of who does it and when do we do it and i don't

[32:06] know that answer yet yeah and you want look and you want the first stream to be good i mean that's

[32:11] it's that's the other part right is the the challenge sometimes with streaming is when crappy

[32:17] playhairs jump on a machine and it almost makes the machine not as good as it is because they're

[32:23] they're not they're not playing very well right so there's a little bit of making a good first

[32:27] impression um yeah and that's why someone like jack danger the guys at buff will pinball is not

[32:32] that good at pinball jack danger is alright now i i'm joking uh i think he listens uh so

[32:38] jerry like how many uh have most existing p3 have you heard from existing p3 owners today and have

[32:45] have you been getting orders for guys who have have the platform so today was a good day obviously

[32:51] it was a really good day for us we built a bunch of playfields to be ready to ship today

[32:57] and we've sold them all so no we haven't heard from everyone i don't even know if everyone's

[33:02] gotten the news yet it's it's only been out for for half a day right now but um we've gotten a bunch

[33:07] of orders for new machines with p3 with uh heist playfields and a bunch of orders from existing

[33:12] customer it's been a good day let's talk um let's talk price so what does the heist

[33:20] cost heist the the pinball game heist cost 2750 that's 2750 dollar complete pinball experience

[33:32] that you can drop in your p3 um so obviously you have to own a p3 to take advantage of that deal

[33:37] if you buy a p3 with heist we're running a special right now where you get the p3 and heist

[33:43] and the back box display and obviously this includes the upper flipper because that's integrated

[33:47] into the game for our normally standard price of 9995 which normally didn't come with a back

[33:52] box display or the flipper okay so roughly 10 grand gets you this fully featured game from p3

[33:59] and that that's always been the the price of the p3 so there is actually no price increase

[34:04] if this is the first time you order a p3 yeah we've actually done a few things to try to create more

[34:10] interest and show people the platform model right away when they try to buy the machine so we now

[34:15] have that one game special we also have bundles now we have a two game and a three game bundle

[34:20] their prices for that that are less than buying all the parts individually and we're also currently

[34:24] running a special now where you can buy basically everything we have that's lexelite speed

[34:30] cosmic heart racing can in the goon heist and get all of our mini games for i think it's about

[34:36] $16,000 okay i had a little bit of sticker shock with that the value you get everything but it

[34:43] is it is it hard in this climate jerry do you think to with with where things are going and

[34:49] economically any anxiety there and at the higher price point stuff or just sort of put it out there

[34:56] and see if people bite well it really doesn't matter because we can't build a p3 for

[35:02] a low enough cost that's gonna allow us to sell it for six or seven thousand dollars it's not

[35:06] possible there's too much technology in it there's too much custom custom mechs in it so um

[35:12] i mean i don't know a lot of people are buying two or three or four machines a year a lot of

[35:16] people have a whole game room full of stern machines or whatever that costs between what six and

[35:22] fifteen thousand dollars depending on the model they're getting right so if someone buys three

[35:26] machines at six thousand dollars a piece that's eighteen thousand dollars it's cheaper to get a p3

[35:30] with a bunch of games yeah well and that's always been the uh the proposition right and so do you

[35:35] feel like you fought i know we've talked about this in the past but you've got the game now that you

[35:40] feel you're proud to put up against everything else that's out there for customers

[35:47] yes we're definitely proud of this game i think i mentioned somewhere i think i heard you quote me

[35:51] that it is the best game i've ever played um and you said it not me and yes i have played pinball

[35:58] before um i i used to have a twelve game collection myself i've played most of the modern games um

[36:04] this is the best game i've ever played it smooth the shots go well there's flow there's there's

[36:10] places pretty much every shot in the play field can stop the ball and redirect it somewhere

[36:15] so you can hit a bunch of flow shots and then something triggers in the software and it changes

[36:19] what happens with the ball um it's fully integrated with the software experience the the theme

[36:24] you're you feel like you're running a heist movie while you while you play the game it's really

[36:30] that special yeah i mean i know i've i've got to get people on it to see that for themselves but

[36:35] it is that good so yes we're super excited about it um have we crossed a threshold

[36:41] we'll see we'll see what people think exciting day i'm i'm always happy to see new pinball machines

[36:47] and i'm always going to give my my unfiltered and unbiased feedback and i will say i i was really

[36:54] excited when i saw this game and and i've always looked for that world in their glass and i've always

[36:59] wanted to see the p3 platform sort of bring uh the potential you've been talking about because

[37:05] i know jerry as a creator of this thing a lot of this has to just be you know what you're dreaming

[37:11] in your head and what you're envisioning can be done and you feel like this this game has closed

[37:16] that gap between the dreams and the reality of this platform for you yeah certainly because i mean

[37:22] one of the biggest things we struggled with early on was we had to build a presence we had to

[37:26] build some name recognition but what we wound up doing was showing a product that was an un

[37:31] and unrecognized potential right it was a bare bones machine with nothing on it that we used to

[37:37] take to shows and it had little simple sample games that people didn't relate to because they

[37:41] weren't pinball games yet then we came out with Lexi and people were like okay that's a that's a

[37:45] cool game but you're pitching a platform so what else do you have and so it's been a we've kind

[37:50] of pieced this this product line together in a way that would have i mean ultimately it's i don't

[37:57] want to say it hurt us because we were nobody's before we had the p3 and we came out with a product

[38:01] that introduced people to us and they at least know what we are but yeah with this game we feel like

[38:08] people can look at the whole product line see the value of the games this is a 2750 dollar game

[38:13] it's not it's not a six thousand dollar game it's not a nine thousand dollar game it's not a twelve

[38:16] thousand dollar game it's a twenty seven hundred and fifty dollar game so everyone who owns a p3

[38:21] gets this for under three thousand dollars right oh and i fall they expect you to sell this to every

[38:26] single p3 owner that's out there but the goal is to really increase the volume of your owner base

[38:33] right i mean that's always been the the proposition to to to developers is that if you can get your

[38:38] your base level up every time you develop a new game you've got a hungry buyer base waiting

[38:44] yes that's true and i know you push us to get more themes out quicker and to get more products

[38:50] out quicker and to get more sales right away but ultimately as long as we can survive as a company

[38:55] and push forward if we come out with a new game next year that year after and someone hasn't

[39:01] yet bought heist they get to fill up their library with the things we had in the past right so

[39:06] this isn't a product where the next game has to be a maker break it's that the next game game

[39:12] might come in someone to buy it and then they get to take advantage of the entire library we've

[39:15] built over over time so it's a completely different model than everybody else in the industry

[39:20] yes and but we've talked in the past and it sounds but the the level of investment in this product

[39:26] in particular because it is so loaded and there there is such an ambitious reach with this game

[39:32] with the mechanisms and and and what you put into it there has to be right the expectation that

[39:38] this is going to be a unit mover for you yes yeah it absolutely is that right now when i was

[39:44] i have to say i i saw you answer a question about license themes and i was i was watching the

[39:50] gift of floating over that animated city Jerry you have to make an a kira pinball machine theme

[39:56] kira that's what canate is based on have you ever seen it it's just yeah i was like it's just

[40:02] that neo-tokio sort of animated movie that is is what my screen name is from or my avatar is from

[40:09] you have to watch a kira and i guarantee you Jerry if you make a kira it's probably not as expensive as

[40:15] a lot of these bigger 80s and 90s themes you're gonna sell a lot of units to the geeks amen

[40:21] let's let's talk let's let's get you and your best friends together and develop a game

[40:26] i would love to i would love to so this is so where do you go now the games out you're gonna

[40:32] stream it and then is it is it just sort of figuring out ways to navigate the new normal that we're

[40:38] all living in and figuring out how do we get games into homes of people who are going to be stuck at

[40:42] home for months well you know that's one one silver lining and the whole thing for for pinball

[40:48] manufacturers is that yeah people are captive audiences right now so yeah if you're stuck at home

[40:53] and you have a set of games that are maybe getting stale to you then this is something that could

[40:58] liven up your your collection but we did you know yeah there's a lot of challenge in the world

[41:04] right now clearly on the supply chain stuff and we worked our butts off to make sure that we had

[41:11] everything we needed to build these games in time for our launch and i know long-term it's still

[41:17] gonna be a struggle for a lot of people and a lot of companies to create the things that we all

[41:21] need to build these things but we put ourselves in a pretty good place and it was not easy we had

[41:27] and the the machine has 3000 unique parts in it and we have 50 or 60 vendors and i'd say a quarter

[41:35] of them completely shut down right in the middle of our our big need so we worked our butts off to

[41:41] to find other solutions or to work with those vendors to to I don't know allow them to defer so

[41:47] obviously we get a lot of things from overseas and trying to kind of shut down during their during

[41:51] their spring festival they're they're new your celebration and um

[41:56] yeah do you do you expect this to really hurt other manufacturers' ability to get parts and to keep

[42:03] the lines moving as usual yeah i mean there's no even thinking about it it already has

[42:08] every single manufacturer is going to have trouble building building games every manufacturer of

[42:12] everything in the world is going to have trouble creating products it's one it's hard to get products

[42:18] it's hard to get the raw materials it's hard to get the things you need but too now we're having

[42:22] we're not allowed to put a group of people in an office and have them do stuff so even getting the

[42:28] machines built is a challenge so yeah we're all going to struggle with that in the short term

[42:32] we put ourselves in a pretty good place we have the materials the inventory to build a good bunch

[42:39] of machines and we're hoping that can get us through this this global issue how many can you build

[42:45] right now with the parts you have is there any sense of urgency for people listening if they

[42:50] want to get one you've got enough to build is it 20 is it 50 is it a hundred is there any any

[42:55] what's your supply ability like in the near future so our inventory isn't the problem our staffing

[43:02] is the biggest issue right now we can build about three to four a week right now um we could

[43:08] staff up or try to staff up bringing more people to build faster but we we have enough parts for a while

[43:13] right and that's going to have what we don't have a space space and people to build a ton of machines at once

[43:19] where where are these built currently in round rock Texas just north to north of Austin okay and

[43:26] how how how how big is the square footage of the of the p3 assembly area we have a five thousand

[43:32] square foot facility well American Pimble has got 35,000 square feet Jerry yes yes they do

[43:39] uh how we always came out this week and and they they sort of positioned that game for operators

[43:45] how do you see your game is it an operators game is it a home game so obviously our machines

[43:51] a lot more expensive than than what they're promoting right now we see our machine mostly as a

[43:58] consumer based product obviously the the video game console kind of model makes perfect sense for

[44:03] consumers and not so much for our Cades because our Caves want a bunch of machines all lined up where

[44:08] you can all go play at the same time we're in the home you all might congregate around a TV or

[44:13] or one guy in the household is a his a pinball fan and we can only play one machine at a time so

[44:19] we're trying to solve the consumer problem of the floor space issue the price per game issue

[44:27] the variety of gameplay issue and yes if operators want it great we support them we have a two-year

[44:33] warranty now so we're happy to support them through the hopefully heavy plays that they're getting

[44:39] but overall when we conceive the product and as we've built the feature set it we see it as

[44:44] mostly a consumer product gotcha the uh the callouts in this game how who who did the callouts

[44:51] there's seven different voice actors all Houston-based voice actors there's one for each

[44:56] character each main character um and I don't think any of them have done any pinball work before

[45:01] besides actually that's not true there's so Joe Grisoffi his a Houston-based pinball community

[45:07] guy and John Swazie did all the voices for Lexi Light Speed okay I can't wait to hear the

[45:14] callouts because I think with a title like this the callouts and the characters are super important

[45:21] in sort of holding you in and engaging the player yeah we've actually done a lot of unique things

[45:28] related to callouts we have a lot of new code that allows the characters to run conversations

[45:34] and then decide if a higher priority callout comes in what do you do with the conversation that's

[45:37] going on and so so this whole theme obviously story-based it involves the characters working

[45:43] together so there's a lot of communication and a lot of voice calls that work together very cool

[45:47] and uh some of your games are you can connect them any can can you connect to heist together and any

[45:55] player versus player modes or or is that not currently in it it's not in it and I don't think

[46:02] we currently have plans to put it in it we wanted this game to be a pinball enthusiast a thing

[46:07] that they're familiar walking up to and playing and enjoying so it's it's on par with

[46:12] from a functionality perspective it it's the style of a traditional pinball game okay games like

[46:17] cosmic heart racing and heads up are specifically designed to be networked together so you can

[46:21] compete against other people but this year you're trying to get your score you're trying to

[46:25] progress through the game it's a single player type of experience okay any any relief I know this

[46:30] might be a morbid way to think about what's going on in the world but just a relief that because

[46:36] of what's happening the other manufacturers are going to be delayed and you're sort of coming out

[46:43] and you're the only one on stage right now other than hot wheels

[46:46] because

[46:48] relief isn't the word we're excited about the game and we thought it would stand up really well

[46:53] against everybody else we were curious to see what the new company in San Antonio was doing we were

[46:58] curious to see you know the new ones from the other big guys but this game is really that good

[47:03] and we were kind of hoping we take it to tpf and this would be the game people were talking about

[47:07] yeah it definitely has a wow mech and and I love seeing that crane in action because

[47:15] if you look at a lot of the games these days there's a lot of theme in a game there's a lot of

[47:20] theme on the screen there's a lot of theme in the artwork but we rarely see mechanical wow

[47:28] in pinball these days and and I think this game definitely has that and people are excited to

[47:32] jump on it so the next few weeks we're going to see homeowners get some of them and then any

[47:38] locations that you know might get one so if there's anyone out there who might be

[47:45] out I don't know locations are closed though right it's even weird for me to like suggest that

[47:49] I don't think anyone's going to be going anywhere to play and even if the locations open

[47:54] I would tell my family not to go out yeah yeah I'm sorry that's just the reality of the world right

[47:59] if you want to send me one Jerry I'm waiting for Rick and Morty but I'd happily I'd happily give

[48:08] it a whirl now I think we can figure out a business relationship where you send us something and we

[48:13] send you something all right I'll send you yeah what can I send you right now I can send you

[48:19] beer and Oreo cookies and I can give her or you can pay for a machine and we can ship you

[48:24] want it would be great yeah well I get I get a hop on it I got a hop on it like you must know that

[48:29] I mean like you saw everybody buy Rick and Morty before playing and I was one of them right and you

[48:33] saw that everyone jumped in because of theme without understanding if the game was enjoyable to shoot

[48:40] now as you watch some of the Rick and Morty feedback and my show included and people are realizing

[48:45] that it might not be the most fun shooter but everyone's already locked in because of theme are you

[48:52] excited that your game will will shoot as good as it looks and as good as the engineering is in it

[49:00] yes but just because we're proud of the design I don't really care whether you enjoy your other

[49:08] games I just want to give you an experience that we're super proud of and that we believe we're

[49:11] giving you value for your money and that's what this game is I'm actually super excited to play

[49:16] Rick and Morty I haven't seen one locally I know a guy who's getting one so I'm excited to

[49:22] to try that at some point but obviously it uses our boards so I followed the development

[49:27] and the release of it I'm super excited for the game I hadn't I hadn't watched the show I think

[49:31] you said you hadn't either now seen the show before they announced it and my girlfriend and I

[49:35] have since watched the entire series and it's unlike me to say this but I quite like it yeah

[49:41] now I'm excited about the game and the theme integration of that machine is fantastic yeah it's

[49:45] great they did a good job integrating it now a question I just I just have to ask is are you guys

[49:50] going to be okay with this economic slowdown can you weather this storm are you set up to do that

[49:56] so who knows we hope so we aren't in desperate need right now of you know immediate revenue we

[50:06] have some runway I suspect that a lot of companies in pinball and outside of pinball are going to

[50:11] have a lot of trouble and I wouldn't be surprised if we lost some pinball manufacturers and I wouldn't

[50:16] be surprised if they blamed the coronavirus whether or not that was the reason it's just it's a

[50:23] bad situation for everybody and we're going to do our best we hope we get enough sales from this to

[50:29] justify buying a lot of parts to build up inventory for a lot of machines and hopefully funding

[50:35] the development of the next one but we're okay for now but we'll see yeah yeah I mean we have

[50:40] the other big product line too which is the p-rock product which helps fund the development of

[50:44] the p3 so we're kind of dependent on some of the other manufacturers to help us to help us be

[50:49] healthy as well yeah now you the p-rock's been in you guys designed the engine I always say I

[50:54] worked when I was in working in video game marketing one of my clients was a cliffy bee and

[50:59] unreal and it was just amazing how much the nudity they made just off of the engine right and then

[51:06] they of course they made their own games but p-rock makes its way into a lot of games so that's it's

[51:12] you are driving a lot of what people love in pinball behind the scenes as well which is which we

[51:17] hope doesn't end so Jerry like I'm excited I want me to read you some of my feedback on my

[51:23] Facebook page of what people have said if you haven't seen it yet let's let's I mean it's always

[51:27] more fun to react to the negative responses but yeah hit me on hold on I know you know people think

[51:33] I'm negative all the time do you agree with that of people's assessment of the show anything you

[51:36] want to ask me or like things I've said or question anything we just see we tried that didn't we

[51:42] once yeah there are all these awkward silences and things are you going to watch the twippies as I

[51:47] pull up my page here I hope to yes it's next did you vote in the twippies I voted for a couple

[51:54] categories other categories I did not vote did you vote for best pinball podcast I don't know

[52:02] should I plead the fifth on this oh my god Jerry if I again if I lose by vote I know who to come

[52:08] all right hold on I got I'm gonna pull up my heist here someone someone's selling a wrath of

[52:13] Olympus for nineteen thousand five hundred dollars what's wrong with people Jerry there's only six

[52:20] of those out there though yeah but there's a reason for that when they were selling them nobody wanted

[52:24] it I mean that's true but they're also super limited so I guess I could understand why somebody

[52:28] might think that their their baby is worth that much all right you ready you ready for some

[52:32] feedback on your game your baby do it all right all right let me see I got so do do do do do do

[52:42] these are emails you read our Facebook messages okay all right Tony says I'm happy to see they have

[52:49] some fresh ideas in gameplay instead of gimmicks that don't add anything to game flow I'd love to

[52:56] play this if I could find any p3s in the wild yep so it's hard to I mean what's a gimmick and

[53:06] what's a fresh idea anybody could say any fresh idea is a gimmick until people adopt it like it

[53:10] but yeah we try stuff some stuff stick some stuff doesn't and we're hoping to build our customer

[53:16] base big enough to where you can see him anywhere you go right R.E. says some innovation finally

[53:23] awesome great combination of p3 with more traditional play fields goes great together cool because

[53:30] that's exactly what our what our objective was I mean it's always been we want we want to introduce

[53:35] games that are a physical pinball experience with dynamic artwork and some new technology but yeah

[53:40] this game definitely hits hits a good balance between those two things let's see Jeff says I

[53:46] think this looks really cool I'm actually impressed with this actually yeah the actual here at the

[53:52] emphasis on actually now it's like when someone comes up to us at a show and says holy crap this

[53:57] is actually fun yeah or when you tell your wife you look good today Sean says this that's pretty

[54:06] awesome Dave said the theme makes dialed in seem cool in comparison but the mech does look cool

[54:16] he doesn't like heist movies and this is also and this I think this is Dave who is is Dave over at

[54:21] highway pinball so we'll take that with take that with the grain assault and Dave I know you

[54:26] listen to the show don says everything before you go I mean every theme has has people that love it

[54:31] and people that hate it so I think it does look like dialed in though I think the comparisons to

[54:35] dialed in on this game are are completely fair I I've said dialed in is is a very cool packed game

[54:44] but I think this has a mech in it that is more wow than any mech in dialed in and I would I would

[54:50] go to any debate against someone who says otherwise I mean this that crane is moving it's grooving

[54:55] it's magnetized it's it's a it's a crane is awesome wait till you get to play with it because we

[55:00] actually have a bunch of mini modes that use the crane in various ways and it's really fun you

[55:05] should just send me the crane to play with for a few weeks not the game just like I'll take it

[55:11] the this my sick mind okay so Don says looks pretty dope man happy to see things pop in and

[55:17] locking whatever that means hopefully that old pop so Liam said damn even p3 has better artwork and

[55:25] animations than American pinball but we spend a lot of time making sure these animations were great

[55:30] still and did a lot of work the artist did a lot of work I mean this isn't something we just

[55:34] threw together obviously a lot of criticism on earlier p3 games is the artwork isn't resonating

[55:39] with people as much because whatever people say they look like they're from the 90s or whatever

[55:45] but this game we specifically went in with some goals and one of the goals was to make the art

[55:51] and animation experience something that people could could relate to and enjoy right Derek said

[55:58] quick hot take well first off let's give props where do the launch was a professional quality video

[56:06] not grainy or jpeg or cell phone video Jerry and I have to say like thank you for that

[56:12] Stephen is the man thank you Stephen for that it always amazes me that these companies spend

[56:17] over a year plus making a game and then the first time you see it is the worst way to see it all

[56:23] that what yeah I actually agree with you I don't understand that um and then he said but

[56:30] sometimes that's because you spoiled their releases so it's kind of your fault sometimes yeah no

[56:33] I'm gonna leak anything people give me I mean I this might it's what I do here I'm actually

[56:37] you had not heard of this game until now no you know and you did a good job you did a good job

[56:43] of keeping it under wraps I know that you told some other podcasters and they kept it secret but you

[56:48] can't you can't tell me unless you if you were to call me up Jerry and say Chris here's here's

[56:54] the theme here the images keep it quiet of course I'm gonna keep it quiet if you if you tell me that

[57:00] I like not knowing because I do have more fun when someone says hey American pinball's next

[57:05] title is hot wheels and I get to spoil that three months in advance see that's not cool but okay

[57:11] but if you if you support the pinball industry and this is me playing devil's advocate with you but

[57:16] if you support everyone and you say this you say you want people to be successful and you want

[57:20] to encourage them to be successful trying to things and then you you knowingly spoil their launch yep

[57:26] that's that's a bit counterproductive no no but here's here's my counter to that if you want to be

[57:31] successful and you want to have a great launch you can't leak and tell people what your title is

[57:37] and the only reason I know it's hot wheels because they tell people that's the only reason I mean

[57:43] Jersey Jack goes around and tells everybody what his next game is when he's in their homes and he

[57:47] thinks they're not gonna share that information it's like no one knew Rick and Morty was happening

[57:53] nobody knew this was happening nobody knew there's a lot of you know what you could ask anyone

[57:59] right now Jerry what's Stern's next title after Ninja Turtles nobody knows nobody yeah so all right

[58:06] Derek then said the game looks like it has some interesting mechs I'm honestly interested to try it

[58:12] it is a shame they this couldn't have launched a tpf we agree and he says I think we we would

[58:17] have gotten some eyeballs on it last thought given the theme and art style I couldn't help but think

[58:23] what a great licensed grand theft auto would have been and an expensive one at that yeah but all

[58:31] these comments that it looks cool and people are want to play it and and it's majority is very very

[58:38] positive and supportive of of this title so that must make you feel good yeah obviously it does

[58:43] it makes us feel great you know I I can't wait to get back to normal I I have a broken rib and I've

[58:49] been living in this apartment for three and a half weeks now how do you break your rib it's a

[58:54] long story I'll tell you about it it's painful so this this quarantine in this staying at home

[58:59] is actually helped me heal and not having to go into the office but I can't wait till we can go back

[59:05] out and play pinball to we can jump on your machine and I can't wait to see this thing in action

[59:10] and I think people are going to be excited Jerry to see this thing streamed I think a lot of us

[59:14] are going to be connected to the community through streaming services through twitch through the

[59:20] stuff that you guys put up so I hope you I hope you get the orders uh flowing in when people see

[59:26] this game being played and I I can't wait to jump on it and see the game in action as well

[59:31] yeah thank you I wish there was an easy way to get it in front of everybody today um

[59:36] but obviously all the internet call the internet come on Jerry yes but but this whole experience

[59:42] with the p3 has always been I see videos it looks interesting um I don't get it and then people play

[59:48] it they're like oh it's actual pinball I like it there's this cool ball lock on lexie or these

[59:52] cool magnet ramps on ccr people generally speaking have always needed to touch and feel and play

[59:59] the p3 before they fully understood I think the videos do really good justice to this game so hopefully

[01:00:05] people can can get a feel for it without necessarily touching it hopefully they can get that feel

[01:00:09] for it through streams but that's that's always a challenge with pinball you don't really know

[01:00:13] what the experience is going to be until you play it that's what I tell Brenda every Saturday night um

[01:00:20] get a feel without touching it uh okay so Jerry I know I'm I did out that joke or maybe I'll leave it

[01:00:25] it was horrible everyone's like canada you're losing it you're losing it you're never going to

[01:00:29] win a fourth twippy now awkward silence I know well Jerry thank you so much for taking the time to

[01:00:35] come on the show really appreciate it I know this is a big day for you guys congratulations to you

[01:00:40] and everyone at the team has been working really hard I think people see uh the fruits of your

[01:00:45] labor as they look over this game and this definitely feels like the platform you created is coming

[01:00:51] to life in a way that I don't even think a lot of people thought was possible so I look forward

[01:00:55] to seeing people's reaction as they play the game yes so do I thanks Chris I appreciate you having

[01:00:59] me on it's always good to talk to you I'm obviously excited about all the reactions all the positive

[01:01:03] reactions and even the constructive ones as well um yeah let's get it in front of people and see
