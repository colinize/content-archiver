[00:00] This is my big baby, so I never think I'm too much.

[00:06] My big baby's will do the same for you.

[00:18] Oh my god, I can't believe what my eyes are seeing in attack from Mars remake with green trim.

[00:26] Oh my god, I must stop everything I'm doing right now.

[00:30] I must turn off the world and head to PIN side to voice my, my, my

[00:35] abjects suffering to such a terrible decision.

[00:39] Now the world will never get attack from Mars in the proper black trim the way it should be.

[00:45] The world is coming to an end.

[00:48] This new pinball machine is causing me so much stress.

[00:53] Where?

[00:55] Do you guys even hear yourselves today?

[00:57] It's unbelievable.

[00:58] You would think that some terrible thing has happened.

[01:01] A brand new pinball machine has been introduced to the world and everybody's moaning and groaning about it.

[01:10] Right?

[01:11] I want, I want you guys to ask yourself one simple thing.

[01:15] Imagine if you took a bunch of kids and asked them what do you think of this?

[01:20] They be like that's cool.

[01:21] That's awesome.

[01:22] I want to play pinball.

[01:24] But take a bunch of grown adults and show them the machine and they will focus on the one thing that they don't like.

[01:31] The trim package of attack from Mars remake.

[01:34] Now we have to say, like this has been one of those beautifully sort of the whole community is sort of rally behind how disgusted they are with the color of attack from Mars remake.

[01:47] And I have to say you guys have to give Canadian a little bit of credit.

[01:50] My information was pretty spot on.

[01:51] I was just wrong about the number of L.E.s.

[01:54] There are only going to be 500.

[01:56] But I'll say this.

[01:58] I asked around to a lot of people like what they thought about it.

[02:01] And I think a lot of people out there think it looks pretty damn good.

[02:05] Now you won't see people on pin sides say that because again it's this mob mentality where everyone has to agree and say the same thing.

[02:13] Or they will suffer the slings and arrows of the vocal minority there.

[02:19] But do I think they're going to sell all 500 attack from Mars remakes?

[02:25] Absolutely.

[02:26] They will sell everyone.

[02:28] I don't think people realize sometimes who this is targeted for.

[02:32] This game is not being marketed towards the die hard pin side guy.

[02:38] The die hard guy who can go grab an attack from Mars anytime he wants.

[02:43] This is targeting individuals who probably have always wanted an attack from Mars but never wanted to buy a game that maybe is 20 years old that doesn't want to deal with having to restore it and want something brand new in box.

[02:58] They want it shiny and they want it virgin before they plunge.

[03:02] To that buyer I think this looks like a very appealing package.

[03:07] But I get it guys. I get it. I do think this looks a little bit like leftover trim from Ghostbusters.

[03:14] The green on it matches the green on the play field but there's a lot of other greens that it doesn't match.

[03:21] It doesn't match the green on the alien.

[03:23] But I still thought the overall package was pretty damn sweet.

[03:27] It was pretty damn sweet.

[03:28] Now I know it's hard to say it's worth it because we don't know the price.

[03:33] But I was really curious what Rick over at Chicago Gaming and PPS thought of all the feedback he was getting.

[03:41] I did what we always do on this podcast.

[03:44] I simply called him up and asked for his feedback on what he was reading on pin side.

[03:48] What I want to do is share with you guys how that conversation went.

[03:53] Let's roll the tape right now.

[03:56] Hey Rick how's it going?

[03:58] I know you guys are excited to finally show the world what attack from Mars remake is going to be.

[04:04] And there's been lots of feedback on pin side about your game.

[04:07] I was wondering if I could read you some of the feedback and you could give me what your thoughts are on what those people are saying about attack from Mars remake.

[04:15] Does that sound good?

[04:16] Okay let's start right with number one.

[04:18] Pin side user Falcon Punch said love attack from Mars but I have to say that green trim isn't a great look.

[04:26] Doesn't match the cab art at all.

[04:28] Rick what do you have to say to Falcon Punch about his comment?

[04:32] This is the end of your rotten life you mother fucking dope pressure.

[04:37] Wow wow Rick Rick calm down calm down these guys are pinball fans that they love the game.

[04:43] You know they're just a little bit upset about the green trim.

[04:45] I'm sure not everybody is upset with the green trim.

[04:48] Let's read some more feedback from us some more pin side members about this.

[04:52] Well Jay Gentry he had to say this Rick maybe this will make you feel better.

[04:57] Games look nice the green trim oh is a swing and a mist though.

[05:03] They need to switch that over to a gloss black Rick what do you have to say to Jay Gentry about his feedback on attack from Mars remake?

[05:11] Learn respect woman or your face too will be amusing.

[05:16] I don't know if if Jay Gentry is a woman Rick but I'm gonna look into that I think it might be a man.

[05:21] But look I don't think everyone thinks the green trim is bad you know I think people are just a little bit upset because you took something that was a class like

[05:29] and you made some changes to it and whenever you do that whenever you change something people have grown to love over the years.

[05:34] It's always gonna be met with a little bit of opposition but there has to be people that like the green trim.

[05:40] Like maybe rotor Dave maybe he was out there in Dallas today maybe he liked it he said he must concur black is the way to go for AFM.

[05:50] Ooh I he wants black to what do you what do you think about rotor Dave and his comments there about your machine and going with green.

[05:59] I don't give a company fuck about your moral conundrum you meet headed shit sack.

[06:04] Damn Rick these are your potential customers how can you be talking to them this way you know I thought this was gonna be a cordial interview where we could just you know get to the bottom of your design choices on attack from Mars remake.

[06:19] But look like there there has to be there has to be some members here that are happy with this decision like Tiki for example Tiki is a really positive guy.

[06:28] He never has anything negative to say about pinball he's always wanted to support new pinball machines coming out there and introducing pinball to a whole new generation and Tiki said lime green.

[06:39] Whoever made that decision should be fired today yesterday.

[06:44] Oh Rick are you gonna are you gonna fire anyone like what do you think about Tiki's suggestion there that whoever made the decision to go with green should be fired.

[06:53] Shut it in son of a bitch calm down Rick calm down all right this is not the time to take it out on your potential customer base you know some of them are still upset that they went in to medieval madness remake and there are issues with playfields and long delays.

[07:10] So Rick you got to cut these guys a little bit of slack they aren't you know they they aren't fully over that that last episode with with with PPS well look I think

[07:21] I think Beasel Boob he's positive he said I and I can't believe they didn't throw in a 3d translate on the L.E.

[07:30] Oh Rick what do you have to say to bezel boob who who who who's looking for a 3d translate you mother fucking worthless cocksucker.

[07:38] All right this is getting out of control Rick I can't let you just berate all these pinside members I mean these guys are into pinball why are you so upset that they are complaining all day long.

[07:50] About a new pinball machine coming out in the world right isn't this what pinside exists for to have grown men who have nothing better to do than to complain about specific elements on a brand new pinball machine right right so you got to cut them some slack this they're just doing their job this is the whole point of having that forum you know but look I I I'm going to find someone to say something nice like

[08:18] Rocky top said the green trim is ugly oh Rick don't don't let Rocky top have it what do you have to say to Rocky top Rick I will never kiss anybody

[08:29] uglier than you all right well at least you're you're at least you're calming down you're kissing people you know Rick look there's a lot of conversation around like the LCD and the fact that it's

[08:41] wide and how that's going to work I think people will calm down Rick and see your vision once they get a chance to play the game and see some video of it in action but you know look I I think that people have asked for an attack from Mars remake and you gave it to them so I think everyone is satisfied with your choice of of theme here you know just like like musket musket it D musket D on pinside he said if they would ever make king pin or big bang bar they would have to do it.

[09:10] Bang bar they would have my order Rick what do you would you have to say to musket D who who's not really a fan and was waiting for a king pin remake that's what I thought you're a godless turd Rick come on he's not a godless turd he's just a guy who who wants the nicest possible attack from Mars he can get you got to stop

[09:33] from getting these guys it's not fair you know look surely the pinside moderators will be objective here and won't weigh in with too much of a one sided opinion like like our friend force flow he always seems to be that even kill moderator who never weighs in and gives us his personal opinions on things like like he said hmm the let speakers and large LCD look kind of goofy to me since they went with green trim I wonder why they went with blue lights on the side of the screen

[10:02] lights on the speakers instead of green yellow red or orange well what do you have to say Rick to force flow and the pinside moderation staff who who doesn't seem to be a fan of of the color choices that you went with with this remake and for the more you can all go fuck yourselves

[10:23] Rick man you're going to get like a permanent lifetime ban for telling the pinside moderators to go do that what are you doing what are you doing now Rick I mean look I know this has probably been a rough day but low and behold not near the end of the day we saw that if you want to get an Ellie version of attack from Mars remake you can get the green trim or the silver trim right so we heard this so I think that that is not going to be a good one

[10:53] is actually going to appease a lot of people what are my thoughts what are my thoughts I know I had some more sound clips but I'm like you guys are probably like this is the dumbest podcast ever and I'm making you suffer a little bit because episode 100 is going to be that good

[11:09] I'm taking I'm taking your expectations way down before I take them through the roof look I think that a lot of people a lot of people complain and moaning grown whenever something new is shown and I just don't think the green trim is that bad personally I don't I really don't think it's like this horrendous color that we can't live with but but I'll say this people want options people want options

[11:39] and because people are spending a lot of money on these machines now and I don't think you can ask people to spend money on machines upwards of $10,000 and have an attitude that's sort of like take it or leave it

[11:57] it's not really you know it's not really fun to have to go change the trim on a machine I see people saying like I'll just powder code it and send those parts off and what not but that is not what people want to do they'd rather get the machine from the factory the way they want it

[12:15] something else I saw was people are posting pictures of the the scoop hole and the clear coat was already chipping away and so that's already got people concerned with with how this micro play field will hold up I am just for the life of me for the life of me I cannot understand why people don't put clifters in these games from the factory I really don't get it we saw Stern's

[12:44] start to add the protectors to ghost busters these new pins we know exactly where games where why don't games ship this is going to be me being a little bit of baby why don't games ship with

[12:58] scoop protectors in place why don't they ship with mylar already on areas like shooter lanes and and where the ball drops into you know the

[13:11] like balls coming off a ramp and it drops down there consistently as it's heading towards the flippers like that area will always wear why don't they put mylar there so let's see

[13:21] Rotor-Dave just said 12 minutes ago I've never played a remake until today the MMR of the show the flippers were a little weak I guess they have the standard

[13:29] value William flippers assemblies and coils the MMR MMR today seem to feel a bit different to a value Williams machine whatever they're the same games guys the same games

[13:42] they're not different like the same parts the same parts but again these machines are not tailored for the pin sight crowd they are

[13:51] tailored for people who want a brand new version of a classic game and I think they're going to sell every one I really do I

[13:59] really need to take a break right now and and and take us down a notch take us down I know that was just like sort of like an

[14:08] irreverence sort of podcast about all the bitching around attack from Mars but I want to just have a little bit of of a moment of

[14:18] remembrance for someone who's passed away and this sucks whenever a member of the community who's added so much value to the

[14:28] community who's contributed this guy is contributed so much to pinball that it's really hard to even measure his

[14:35] contributions and that is Steve Charlin passed away yesterday and I know a lot of people are sharing

[14:44] stories I didn't personally know Steve but I think that many of you did and I think that this news is really

[14:52] sad I believe he was diagnosed with leukemia I believe like eight months ago so it's really heavy hearts that we want to

[15:02] say you know our thoughts and our prayers are with Steven's family and and the hobby has lost a really valuable

[15:12] member and a great person right more than the hobby it's just sad to see a family going through it lost like this and

[15:21] and it you know I know Steve knew so many of you out there and I know you guys knew him and and we just want to say our thoughts and

[15:29] prayers are with Steven and his and his family as they go through this this tough time so let this put things in

[15:38] perspective a little bit too right I know I know it's hard to and I know the tendency is always to see something

[15:47] and bitch about something and when I do these pinside babies I do it you know I'm not trying to be as

[15:54] mean spirited as I think I once was but I also want people to realize that this is just a pinball machine guys no

[16:01] one's forcing you to buy attack from Mars remake there's nothing about attack from Mars remake that really seems to be

[16:08] of concern or should be really truly bothering somebody out of all the people moaning and groaning and

[16:15] bitching about it I wonder how many of those people were actually going to get one or are excited to get one

[16:20] and and I think people need to just take one step back and look at it and you say okay if I objectively

[16:30] put those three machines in front of casual people I don't think they'd have a problem with the green I think

[16:38] they'd enjoy it it looks great with the mere blades it looks great with that amazing topper and you know I think

[16:44] it would be a beautiful addition to anyone's collection if it's not for you and you want black and I think they

[16:51] heard loud and clear today that the green is not the popular choice you know it's on Rick and

[16:57] company to take that feedback and maybe make some possible changes and there is time to do that

[17:02] unless they stockpiled green parts there there may be a chance to to hear your feedback

[17:09] and I'm not being too critical about the hobby you know you guys do give good feedback and your

[17:14] feedback often does lead to changes being made before games ship I think it's going to be a

[17:22] really interesting tpf because there are there are just a lot of games coming out in this sort of small

[17:29] window you've got attack from Mars remake you've got alien you've got dialed in you've got

[17:35] erosmith all of them are vying for your money all of them are saying that if you want me you're

[17:45] going to have to spend eight thousand nine thousand ten thousand dollars except for like erosmith pro

[17:49] we don't know what the prices yet are on attack from ours I do think that the pricing is going to be

[17:55] higher than people wanted to be but again for the buyer of this hilton you are not the buyer

[18:02] of this machine all these people saying it's silly that they haven't released price and it's

[18:08] going to be silly if this thing costs more than sixty five hundred I guarantee you this machine will

[18:14] cost more than sixty five hundred in its basic form I would be shocked if it's that cheap

[18:21] and the reason I say that is nobody out there understands how to make a pinball company successful

[18:31] and profitable other than a few companies who have done it right and you can't price yourself

[18:39] out of the market they're not expecting to make thousands of this game they really aren't I really think

[18:46] the majority of the orders are going to be elis and I would assume them they're going to make the elis first

[18:51] and see how it goes and see what the interest is from there but for the most part for the most part

[18:58] I think this things I think the elis going to cost around ten thousand dollars or nine thousand dollars

[19:05] between nine and ten grand is what I'm anticipating and for those of you out there go find me a fully restored

[19:13] perfect condition mintas can be fresh as can be attack from ours and tell me how much does it cost

[19:20] is it around it's more it's more around eight to nine thousand it really is if it was if it was perfect

[19:27] and this game will be perfect that's the part people don't get I've had this argument so many times

[19:33] on clob and on pincy with people if you want an unmalested pristine condition version of something

[19:40] get ready to add a few more thousand dollars than what you think a nice home use only example is

[19:47] okay but it's exciting people should be excited about the times we live in with pinball because it's great

[19:57] that we have the option now to buy attack from Mars remake I know again I know people that are really excited to get it

[20:04] and you they just won't go on pinside and be torn apart by the same people that are unhappy all the time

[20:11] I do find it ironic that some of these individuals who love pinball so much are so upset by every single pinball move that has ever made

[20:19] like these guys are just not happy men and and it it's like say something nice about the pinball machine

[20:26] first then maybe make a criticism of it but it's just like green I'm I'm not going to buy this like you were never going to buy it

[20:33] just be honest people you never were going to buy it so attack from Mars remake it came out today

[20:39] most of my information was right I look forward to playing it episode one hundred is coming up real soon

[20:45] you guys will have it for this weekend I look forward to airing it for you guys hit me up with any feedback

[20:50] oh and guys like I want to say I got a lot of great feedback about Brenda joining the last podcast

[20:56] and we had a lot of fun and I think you see why I think Brenda is amazing she really keeps me grounded

[21:03] and I love that she gave like really honest feedback about this hobby and it's again like I'm all about perspective this year

[21:11] I want to be happier and I think everyone who listens to this podcast everyone who's on the forums everyone who's in the pinball

[21:21] this is a happy year like there's a lot to look forward to and we got to just cut that negative shit out

[21:27] and and look for things to get excited about and stop crying about all the little minutia that no one else really cares about

[21:33] but Brenda might come back on I have to do a kitchen renovation first for her and then maybe she'll think about it

[21:39] I'll talk to you soon guys have a great day
