[00:00] Hey everybody, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:13] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:14] I know it's been a while.

[00:16] I've been under the weather.

[00:17] I've been traveling for work and I'm looking outside right now.

[00:21] It is like Wednesday early afternoon and the entire sky in New York City is this ominous

[00:27] orange.

[00:28] I've been outside and it's terrible out there.

[00:30] This is the worst air quality in the world right now.

[00:33] It smells like a campfire just walking around New York City.

[00:37] So I'm going to brave the elements.

[00:39] I'm going to brave my cold and my sore throat and I'm going to do an episode of Canada's

[00:43] Pinball Podcast.

[00:44] Now look, here's what we're going to do.

[00:45] I want to talk about what's going on in the pinball industry.

[00:49] We're going to talk about what's going on with each of these companies.

[00:51] But I want to start today's episode by talking about Harry Potter and Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:58] When I was thinking more about this as I was in the shower, as I was going on walks, as

[01:02] I was flying to Akron, Ohio, I thought one simple question.

[01:08] What will happen at Jersey Jack Pinball the day they reveal Harry Potter and they get like

[01:14] 7,000 orders for the game?

[01:17] And it's an interesting question, right?

[01:19] Because Aston Pinball is about to move into its new facility in which it could probably

[01:24] crank out close to a thousand games a week.

[01:28] How is Jersey Jack Pinball going to handle a theme with this much demand?

[01:33] Now look, we don't know if the game is going to be any good.

[01:36] I'm really nervous about Jersey Jack Pinball, Harry Potter.

[01:39] We've seen what they got with freaking Willy Wonka with Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:44] We've seen how they get these like lunchbox license deals.

[01:48] The same thing with Toy Story.

[01:49] They didn't get a lot of clips from the movie.

[01:51] There's no audio synced up with the actors in the films.

[01:55] Godfather has it synced up, but then there's barely any clips from the Godfather.

[01:59] And I think for Harry Potter to really work for Potter fans, you're going to want to see

[02:03] a lot of those iconic scenes from the movie in the pinball machine.

[02:07] And I don't think you're going to get it.

[02:09] So that's one of my big concerns.

[02:10] But let's just assume that this game is amazing.

[02:13] Okay, let's just assume that it's loaded with mechs.

[02:16] Let's just assume that they don't make you choose between 22 different characters.

[02:21] Let's just assume that Harry Potter is a game that everybody wants.

[02:25] What does Jersey Jack Pinball prepare to make so many games?

[02:29] And it still begs the question, does anyone know the answer to this question?

[02:33] How many games a week is Jersey Jack Pinball making on a weekly basis?

[02:39] How many Godfathers have been going out the door?

[02:42] Now we could probably do something.

[02:43] We could probably look at how long it takes them to make all 1000 Godfather collector's

[02:49] editions, which are now on the line.

[02:51] And I know they always show a picture of like all the games lined up.

[02:55] You know, they never really do show.

[02:57] You never really see a live tour of Jersey Jack Pinball every week, the way Stern does

[03:02] factory Fridays.

[03:04] And I'm going to just make a guess.

[03:05] I think Jersey Jack Pinball is making more like a hundred to a hundred and fifty games

[03:10] a week.

[03:11] I think that's kind of where they're at.

[03:13] Maybe on a good week, it's up to 200.

[03:16] But if Stern Pinball is going to get to 1000 games a week and Harry Potter, let's just

[03:21] say get 7000 orders and you take into account 52 weeks.

[03:27] So here's why I don't think Jersey Jack Pinball is making anywhere close to a hundred and

[03:33] fifty games a week.

[03:34] I'll tell you why.

[03:35] Because if you think about Guns N' Roses, for example, how long did it take them to

[03:38] make like 4000 GNRs?

[03:42] It took about two years, right?

[03:44] So it took about like almost a hundred weeks to make 4000 guns and roses machines.

[03:50] So let's say you do 52 weeks a year.

[03:53] That's roughly only 40 games a week.

[03:56] Now we know the issue is this, right?

[03:58] That the Jersey Jack line is not constantly going every single week.

[04:02] We know there's always a pause between titles.

[04:05] There's turnover time when they have to do that.

[04:07] But let's just say on average.

[04:08] So if they make a hundred games a week on a good week, that means they can make 5200

[04:14] games a year.

[04:16] I think for Jersey Jack to really handle Harry Potter properly, they're going to need

[04:21] to up the number of people working at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:25] The other thing Jersey Jack eventually has to do.

[04:27] They have to get this company to a place where they can run more than one game at a time.

[04:33] I mean think about it right now.

[04:34] How many people out there don't want Godfather?

[04:37] How many people out there don't want another Guns N' Roses?

[04:40] They don't want Toy Story 4.

[04:42] But you probably could sell New and Box Wizard of Oz machines.

[04:46] You could sell some New and Box Pirates machines.

[04:49] You could probably sell some brand new dialed in machines.

[04:53] But unlike Stern Pinball that always goes back and continues to make titles for years

[04:58] and years and years while they still introduce new titles.

[05:02] Jersey Jack Pinball has failed to ever really do this.

[05:05] They've done second lines every once in a while.

[05:08] But for the most part Jersey Jack Pinball has failed horribly at creating a hybrid manufacturing

[05:15] plant that can do more than just one game at a time.

[05:19] And it's going to be interesting to see where Jersey Jack goes right now because we've

[05:23] got a thousand people that are waiting on their Godfather's CEs.

[05:28] We all know the simple truth is this.

[05:30] They sold more collector's editions of the Godfather than they did of the limited edition

[05:35] game.

[05:36] That was the big problem for Jersey Jack.

[05:39] Once they make all these collector's editions of the Godfather, what do they make after

[05:44] that?

[05:45] There's not going to be more demand for the Ellie of the game.

[05:47] And once those Ellie's start selling for thousands less than they were originally, that's going

[05:52] to be the new price.

[05:53] So no one in their right mind is ever going to offer $12,000 for one.

[05:57] And what we're going to see happen, and trust me, this is going to happen, the collector's

[06:01] edition is not going to go up in value.

[06:03] And you're going to see some CE owners who are lukewarm on the game, trade the game and

[06:08] get like, you know, 13, 14, 12, 5 for the game.

[06:12] And then more people are going to watch that happen.

[06:15] And you're going to see people who aren't over the moon with the game want to get as

[06:19] much money as they can on the secondhand market.

[06:21] Now look, the reviews of Godfather by Godfather owners have been very positive.

[06:27] But what I'm not seeing, and I'm not seeing this on pin side, and I'm not seeing this

[06:32] by any of my pinball friends, I'm not seeing many people being converted over to Godfather.

[06:38] The majority of people who bought the Godfather, you bought it before you played it.

[06:44] And if you're that kind of consumer, then it doesn't even matter, right?

[06:48] You've shown these pinball companies, you don't even need to play the game.

[06:52] You don't need to jump on it.

[06:53] You don't need to experience the pinball moments.

[06:56] You are in on the game.

[06:58] I have a hard time believing that for the thousand people that have committed to $15,000,

[07:04] that you see a pinball machine that is worth that much money.

[07:08] Look, I've watched so much footage on the Godfather.

[07:11] I haven't really played it much.

[07:13] And I think the game is just okay.

[07:15] I think it looks flat.

[07:17] I understand what they're doing with the code.

[07:19] But I really want Eric Minier one day to make a game that is based on a theme that he's

[07:25] super passionate about.

[07:27] He openly admits that he didn't really see these movies and hasn't been dreaming about

[07:31] making the Godfather.

[07:32] He wasn't dreaming about making Pire to the Caribbean.

[07:35] He wasn't even a Guns N' Roses fan.

[07:38] But I think Slash made him passionate about the project.

[07:42] But I could just see Eric Minier sitting in a room.

[07:44] Jack Winari walks in and says, hey man, I got your next game.

[07:49] And Eric perks up.

[07:50] He's like, what is it?

[07:51] Is it the Matrix?

[07:52] Is it Sonic the Hedgehog?

[07:54] What is it, Jack?

[07:55] And he's like, it's the Godfather.

[07:57] A slow mob drama.

[07:59] And this is a thing.

[08:00] I just want to feel like one day we're going to get to Jersey Jack Machines where it feels

[08:05] like the designers are making their dream themes.

[08:09] Do you feel this way when Pat Lawler makes Toy Story 4 or Willy Wonka, right?

[08:15] Pat Lawler is not a die-hard fan of either of those properties.

[08:19] But you really feel the passion when you jump on a game like Rush because John Borg loves

[08:23] Rush.

[08:24] I feel the passion in Foo Fighters with Jack Danger and he loves the Foo Fighters' band.

[08:29] I'm not sure if Keith Elwyn loves Godzilla or not, but I'll tell you this.

[08:34] The guy is so damn talented that if I were to look at that game, I would say he nailed

[08:40] what Godzilla fans are looking for in a pinball experience.

[08:43] You know, that's my overarching question for all these designers over at Jersey Jack.

[08:47] Like is Steve Ritchie the biggest Matrix fan?

[08:50] Is he an Elton John aficionado?

[08:53] I thought he was more like into Johnny Cash and a little bit more edgy music.

[08:56] I feel like all great pinball machines, the greatest ones out there, there has to be a

[09:01] level of passion by the designer that they capture in the thing they create.

[09:07] And I go through this in my business on a personal level.

[09:10] When I get an assignment that I'm not passionate about, you're not going to get my best ideas.

[09:16] But when you give me something that I'm super passionate about, you're going to get my greatest

[09:20] thinking imaginable.

[09:22] And as we spend this much money on freaking pinball machines, I think it's a real easy

[09:27] filter when we look at a game.

[09:29] How much of a designer's passion?

[09:32] How much do they understand the theme?

[09:34] How much did they integrate it into the game?

[09:37] How easy is it to detect that?

[09:38] Right?

[09:39] When you look at the big Lebowski, you could see that those Dutch guys are absolutely over

[09:43] the moon with that theme.

[09:45] And they made the perfect theme integrated pin to showcase that.

[09:48] That's why everybody's excited about Dutch's next game, because their next game is not

[09:53] going to be something that is assigned to them.

[09:56] They worked with Roger Sharp to go find a theme they really wanted to make.

[10:01] And that's been the downfall over at American Pinball.

[10:04] They have not brought themes that they are super passionate about to life.

[10:09] They have not brought themes where the designer is just over the moon to create it.

[10:13] I mean, look at Joe Balser's Hot Wheels.

[10:16] There's not even a loop or a jump.

[10:18] If this guy grew up playing with Hot Wheels, how did he end up making that machine?

[10:24] And look at Galactic Tank Force.

[10:25] I don't even know who's passion is coming through in that game.

[10:28] I don't understand.

[10:29] The real passion in Galactic Tank Force was Dennis Nordman was passionate about making

[10:35] a pinball cabinet look like a tank.

[10:39] Like I was there when they talked about the origins of this game, and the majority of

[10:43] the conversation was all about how he just wanted a pinball machine when you folded down

[10:48] the back box to look like a freaking tank.

[10:50] And that doesn't make any sense to me.

[10:52] I don't know why you would invest in a thought like that.

[10:54] I don't know why you would go down that road.

[10:56] And I especially don't know why you would bank your company's future on an idea like

[11:02] that.

[11:03] And let's be honest, everybody, that idea is not working out.

[11:05] Did you see what David Fick said recently?

[11:08] Did you see what he said recently that this game is earning more on location in certain

[11:12] areas than the Foo Fighters?

[11:14] Maybe if it's only David Fick's inside the arcade and he unplugged all the Foo Fighters

[11:19] machines, but there is no way that this game on location is out earning the Foo Fighters.

[11:26] He also said he has 200 orders for Houdini.

[11:29] Well that's interesting.

[11:31] He can't even make the orders for Galactic Tank Force, and that was taking us all the

[11:35] way back to a game that came out like six years ago.

[11:38] Like people need more Houdini machines new in box.

[11:42] And you ever notice how all of his numbers are always so exact?

[11:45] We got 2000 orders for Galactic Tank Force.

[11:49] We have 200 orders for more Houdinis.

[11:52] Remember when he said the orders for Legends of Ahala Standard Edition were double that

[11:56] of the Deluxe Edition.

[11:58] Alright look, David Fick's is a salesman.

[12:00] Every time he says something, I don't really believe it.

[12:03] And I think one of his biggest missteps was when he sold Galactic Tank Force.

[12:08] He told the people that ordered the $17,500 signature edition game that their games would

[12:14] be made first.

[12:16] Now I have some friends who need to have their head examined.

[12:19] They ordered that game for $17,500 and they have absolutely no idea when they're getting

[12:25] their game.

[12:26] I don't understand.

[12:27] I don't understand.

[12:28] They have absolutely no ETA on when their games are arriving.

[12:31] And when you listen to distributors, they also have no idea when the games are arriving.

[12:36] Here's the BS part.

[12:38] David Fick's, he's not shipping to customers games that were ordered, okay?

[12:42] Games that were ordered with nonrefundable deposits.

[12:46] And yet he's showing up at pinball shows and he's giving distributors games that they

[12:51] can sell on the show floor and allowing people to cut the line, buy the game on the show

[12:58] floor, put it in the back of their station wagon and enjoy Galactic Tank Force at home

[13:03] that weekend while all the people that ordered the game first through American Pinball and

[13:07] other distributors are left with nothing.

[13:11] What are you doing, David Fick's?

[13:13] I understand bringing games to shows, but isn't the point of bringing a game to a show to

[13:18] get more people on the game so they can order the game.

[13:21] But those people that order the game should go to the back of the line.

[13:26] If you allow people to just go home with those games and cut the line, what is that saying

[13:30] to your customer base that gave you a nonrefundable deposit that should be next online to receive

[13:36] a game?

[13:37] I just don't like it.

[13:38] You know, I see this practice, it happens all the time.

[13:40] We also saw this with Scooby-Doo.

[13:42] I would go to shows like TPF and there'd be like five Scooby-Doo's there and you could

[13:46] buy it and take it home that day.

[13:48] I know the argument is like these are show games and they're being beat on and so they're

[13:53] going to be used and so we want to just get something out of them.

[13:56] But man, imagine if you order Scooby-Doo and your game's a year and a half away and you

[14:00] could just go to a pinball show by the game and have it that weekend.

[14:03] I don't know.

[14:04] Again, it's just not how I would do it.

[14:05] All right.

[14:06] So I was just watching this Top or Fort Godzilla.

[14:08] Zach put up a straight down the middle video showcasing the RGB LED lights, which are very

[14:15] cheap ladies and gentlemen.

[14:16] If people think lighting is expensive, you need to go have your head examined.

[14:21] There is at most and I mean this at most there is less than $50 in lighting costs in this

[14:29] $1000 topper.

[14:30] It was also funny because the topper lights up in interesting ways and look, it's not

[14:34] a terrible topper.

[14:36] It just looks like it should cost like 350 bucks.

[14:39] It's $1000.

[14:41] But the funniest part of the video is like and I'm not even sure the topper is supposed

[14:45] to be doing this, but it shines a light on Godzilla.

[14:47] Now if you put the topper next to the wall, it creates a silhouette and a shadow of Godzilla

[14:53] real big on your wall like the bat signal.

[14:56] But that's not a feature of the topper and watching Zach sell that as a feature of the

[15:01] topper as another reason why it justifies the $1000 price.

[15:06] Come on.

[15:07] But I will say when I watch the video, I mean it's much nicer than the stern video and once

[15:12] again, you know, it just goes to show you if you give certain people the product, they

[15:17] can make much better sales materials than the damn companies themselves.

[15:23] And I expect Zach to make good sales material because he's a salesman and it's nothing

[15:27] against him.

[15:28] I mean that video makes me want to own that Godzilla topper much more than the one stern

[15:33] put out.

[15:34] I mean, look, I don't have any real topper anger.

[15:36] Like if I had a Godzilla, let me be honest with you, as much as it's a rip off, I probably

[15:41] would buy it just because I love the game so much and I also do love toppers.

[15:46] So if you love toppers and you love certain pinball machines and this is the official

[15:51] topper, are you going to say no?

[15:53] Are you going to say this is where I draw the line?

[15:55] And I'm just saying, like just make yourselves happy.

[15:58] Like if the topper makes you happy, go get it.

[16:01] If you're not going to get the topper and it angers you, don't be angry about it.

[16:06] Just go through life and don't own it.

[16:08] It's not worth holding on to that anger.

[16:11] And I understand that stern pinball is fleecing us, but all they do is fleece us.

[16:15] If you think a stern premium and a stern elite are worth what we're paying, these games

[16:20] are probably only costing stern $4,000 to $5,000 in material and labor costs to make

[16:26] each game.

[16:27] All right, so just do the math on that.

[16:28] They are making more money on a game like Foo Fighters LE than they ever have before

[16:33] on a pinball machine.

[16:35] But we're not going to win this war, people.

[16:37] We're not going to win this battle.

[16:38] It is never going to go in the other direction.

[16:41] The only silver lining in all of this is the games have to be amazing or we are just going

[16:47] to avoid them like Godfather LE.

[16:49] And once you get above $10,000, you better be giving me something magical that I want

[16:54] to bolt to my game room floor.

[16:56] And I love that because it's really fun.

[16:58] It's really fun sitting on the sidelines.

[17:00] Like I've been sitting on the pinball purchasing sidelines now for the last three months.

[17:04] And you know what I've seen?

[17:05] I've seen my checking account go up, go up, go up, go up, go up.

[17:09] Now I can go buy any pinball machine I want easily and not feel it in my checking account

[17:15] simply because I waited.

[17:17] But if I bought all of these machines, I would probably have more of a buyer's remorse feeling

[17:22] knowing that I don't need to have every single new game when it comes out.

[17:26] Speaking of buyer's remorse, there may be some people out there right now having buyer's

[17:31] remorse that they did not buy James Bond Limited Edition.

[17:36] Have you seen this new James Bond code?

[17:38] I mean, there is a lot in this .92 code dump.

[17:42] And this game is finally starting to really come alive.

[17:46] The owners are celebrating this code in the streets.

[17:50] I still think it's a little premature to say the game is great.

[17:54] There are still things people want to see in this game.

[17:57] They want to see video of the Bond Girls.

[18:00] If you don't have video of the Bond Girls for this demographic stern, what are you doing?

[18:06] All these guys owning this machine, they want to see those beautiful Bond Girls more than

[18:10] these ugly henchmen.

[18:11] I don't know if they're going to do it.

[18:13] I don't know if Stern's going to go woke on this one and not have some seductive scenes

[18:17] from all those Bond Girls.

[18:19] And that's part of what makes James Bond so fun.

[18:22] And especially watching it so many years later, you watch these Sean Connery James Bond films

[18:28] and you're like, oh, there's no way they would make this game today.

[18:30] There's no way.

[18:31] But Bond's interaction with the women is really half of the reason why people love the franchise.

[18:37] And I really hope we get more of that into the game.

[18:41] But look, Stern is throwing a lot at this game.

[18:43] But I also was in the thread and I saw people be like, oh, if there ever was a time to go

[18:47] get a James Bond LE, you better go get it now because look what would happen to Stranger

[18:51] Things.

[18:52] And look, I wouldn't have a second wave of FOMO on James Bond.

[18:56] I still think you're going to be able to get a James Bond LE easily.

[18:59] And here's the thing about James Bond LE versus the premium.

[19:02] They look exactly the same.

[19:05] It doesn't look so much different, right?

[19:07] There's not this amazing LE this or that.

[19:09] I don't know.

[19:10] They all look good.

[19:11] And the premium and the LE, they both look really good because each one represents a

[19:15] different film.

[19:16] I like both of them equally.

[19:18] As I was thinking about the fact that Stern is going to be rerunning more Godzilla premiums,

[19:24] Star Wars premiums, Food Fighter premiums, all these premium machines are going to start

[19:30] to make their way out in the world.

[19:32] And I think what we're going to see sometime this year is we're going to see an oversaturation

[19:36] of premiums in the world.

[19:38] And I worry about premium buyers.

[19:40] I really do because I think at $10,000, the smarter thing you can do is get your hands

[19:46] on an LE, spend $3,000 more, but your game will hold value much more than it will with

[19:53] a premium.

[19:54] There's just going to be so many of them out in the world.

[19:57] The big question is, is Stern going to go to San Diego Comic Con and are they going

[20:02] to tease or announce Venom?

[20:04] I don't think they're going to do it at that Comic Con because here's why.

[20:08] The factory change is happening sometime in August.

[20:11] So we know the game is not going to be on the line in the old factory.

[20:15] So I think they're probably going to reveal the next game sometime in September, October.

[20:20] They're going to get the new factory up and running.

[20:23] And then the other big rumor is this people, because they're going to have this new factory

[20:27] with all of this manufacturing capability and the volume is going to go through the roof,

[20:33] that Stern pinball is going to celebrate this new factory by making a vault edition

[20:38] of a game.

[20:40] And if you were to do a short list of which games do people want to see vaulted, I think

[20:44] you see games like Tron.

[20:46] I think you see games like Ghostbusters and I think you see games like Metallica.

[20:51] Will this happen?

[20:52] Will we see Venom and a vault to end out the year?

[20:55] I think there's a very good chance of both of those things happening.

[20:59] And then now I'm seeing more and more people get on board.

[21:02] It's going to be Keith Elwynn Jaws.

[21:04] And I don't know why people are like, well, I hope they get those assets from the movie.

[21:08] Come on, it's going to be just like Jurassic Park.

[21:11] They're not going to have the movie clips.

[21:13] They are going to make an all original Jaws adventure that uses the music, uses some

[21:19] of the iconic call outs and phrases, but it is not going to be the movie up on the LCD

[21:25] screen.

[21:26] There's no way.

[21:27] I hope I'm wrong.

[21:28] I really do.

[21:29] But there's no way that's going to happen.

[21:30] Everybody, you can tell I am kind of losing my voice.

[21:34] I love doing this podcast.

[21:36] It's usually not as physically taxing on me as it is right now.

[21:40] But thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[21:43] Don't pay attention to all the drama.

[21:44] I'm not a bad guy.

[21:46] I'm just a pinball podcast or trying to make his way through the world.

[21:50] Everybody will talk to you soon.

[21:51] Have a great day.
