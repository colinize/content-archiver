[00:00] I do not for one think that the problem was that the band was down. I think that the problem

[00:12] may have been that there was a stone-enge monument on the stage that was in danger of being

[00:16] crushed by a dwarf.

[00:23] Once again, Canadian's Pinball Podcast is going to turn it to volume 11 as we confirm for

[00:29] you that spinal tap pinball will be coming out this September by Home Pin Pinball.

[00:37] Now I am looking at the flyer from Home Pin. I released it exclusively on Canadian's

[00:44] Pinball Podcast, Facebook, Page, and today, but this is what I said would happen. That all

[00:49] of these games this fall, we're going to try to get through the door at the same time. We've got

[00:55] Godzilla. We've now got spinal tap. We've got the new game from American Pinball. We've got

[01:01] cactus Canyon remake. All of these games are coming out between now and Pinball expo.

[01:08] So a two month period of time, we're going to see all of these games trying to make their way

[01:13] in the marketplace. This is exciting, but we're going to talk about spinal tap because Home Pin Pinball

[01:18] is a company that has not been on anybody's radar since they released thunderbirds.

[01:25] And here they are with the theme that I think is a really, really good theme for Pinball. We're

[01:31] going to talk about that. I'm going to talk about Mirko wanting to talk at Pinball expo is

[01:37] everything okay in the water over there in Germany. He wants to fly over here and talk to us at

[01:45] Pinball expo about his playfields. I want to talk about that. And I want to talk a little bit

[01:50] about Jeff at this weekend pinball taking a hiatus apparently something happened with deep

[01:55] root and his coverage of them. So I'm going to talk briefly about that. But let's get right to

[02:00] spinal tap. So I am looking at a flyer that says Home Pin is contractually obligated to present

[02:08] this is spinal tap Pinball. And it says this is spinal tap Pinball bringing the most iconic

[02:15] documentary of all time to Pinball. And they're taking Pinball to 11. Now if you've seen the movie,

[02:21] you know what that means that the amplifiers can go past 10 and go all the way to 11. It also says

[02:27] limited time only don't miss out. So that means that Home Pin is obviously going to offer these

[02:33] up for sale for a limited time only. Now we know that the FOMO works every single time in Pinball.

[02:40] So how will this work with these guys? Are they going to have limited edition games? Is there

[02:45] going to be a limited window of availability? We shall see. But this game's coming out in September.

[02:51] So over the next 30 days you are going to see spinal tap Pinball from Home Pin. They then go on to

[02:57] list the features of this game. And I want to deconstruct each one and talk about if I were putting

[03:03] together marketing material and I were trying to get you excited about spinal tap Pinball.

[03:09] Would these be the things I would mention and in this order? And is this enough information to

[03:15] get you excited about spinal tap Pinball? But before I do that, I just want to say on a macro level,

[03:21] I think spinal tap is a phenomenal theme for Pinball. I think it's campy, I think it's fun,

[03:27] I think it has the right sense of humor and I think the movie itself, this documentary about this

[03:32] ban is perfect for the age demographic of Pinball. I bet almost everyone who's into Pinball has

[03:40] seen spinal tap. It's just a feel good movie. And when we think about the Pinball landscape right now,

[03:45] we're sort of over dad rock over and over and over again and we just keep getting ban pin after

[03:51] ban pin. But this is different like this is a music pin, but it's really not. It's a comedy about

[03:56] rock bands. It's a comedy about like the egomaniac rock bands of the 70s and 80s and it's super

[04:04] well done. And if you haven't seen spinal tap, I don't know where you've been living, but it's a

[04:08] super fun movie. Now it is campy. Now this is not like a mainstream blockbuster hit. This is

[04:14] a cult classic movie. But as we've seen, you don't need to have like this juggernaut movie to sell

[04:21] a few thousand Pinball machines if they do this movie justice. And if this Pinball machine shoots

[04:27] well and has fun, Max and has the most important thing it needs to have because this movie has so many

[04:34] iconic scenes. It has so many iconic lines and it has so much humor in it. This game needs to have

[04:42] theme integration. You need to see the movie you love up on the screen in this game. And so let's

[04:48] go through these features and ask ourselves is Mike over at home pin confirming that this is

[04:54] going to have all of the great clips from the movie we love. So let's go through this feature list

[05:00] and see if we're getting enough information about what's going to be in this pin to excite us.

[05:04] Okay so number one at the top of the list it says stunning cabinet graphics and trim stunning

[05:12] cabinet graphics and trims. So okay that's the first thing you lead with on spinal tap pinball is

[05:18] that the graphics and trim are going to be stunning. Now it says cabinet graphics. Now this has

[05:24] me a little bit like why does it say cabinet graphics and not just say incredible artwork or whatever

[05:29] you want to say but they don't say anything about the play field and so this makes me a little

[05:34] bit nervous is why are they highlighting the cabinet which is the part of the pinball artwork you

[05:39] don't really see when you're playing a pinball machine you are looking at the translate and looking

[05:44] at the play field. So little strange that they were the first bullet as that the second bullet

[05:50] original spinal tap soundtracks. Okay now when I read this I was also somewhat confused. Does this

[05:59] mean it's going to have the spinal tap music from the movie or original spinal tap songs that they

[06:06] made for the pinball machine if I'm reading this the way it is I would assume that this means it's

[06:12] not from the movie because if it was from the movie I think it would say clips from the original

[06:18] movie or songs from the original movie and I'm not seeing that anywhere in this and that makes me

[06:25] nervous because it almost feels like they just licensed the name spinal tap but this is not the

[06:30] movie the other thing that's missing from this flyer entirely is there's no mention of the movie

[06:35] studio or trademarks here at all so I'm starting to conclude as I read the features of this spinal

[06:43] tap game by home pin that it is not going to be a fully theming a graded game or they would have

[06:50] said that like wouldn't you say that on the flyer all of the iconic movie scenes you love from

[06:55] the film will be in here like full assets from the movie like wouldn't you lead with that isn't

[07:00] that the number one thing everyone would want to see on a spinal tap pinball machine flyer all right

[07:06] the next thing it says is replica models of famous tap guitars okay so if you've seen the movie

[07:12] they've got their colorful guitars and and I'm assuming they're going to find their way somewhere

[07:17] into this pinball machine and I saw that now the other thing I was saying to myself is guns and

[07:22] roses has raised the bar on putting instruments into a pinball machine will the guitars in this just

[07:30] be molds that don't do anything or will they be somewhat integrated into the gameplay the way

[07:35] Eric integrated the less Paul and Duff's fender base and the drumsticks so I'm not sure but I'm

[07:41] just saying when you're coming out with a rock and roll inspired theme pinball machine in 2021

[07:47] we are going to compare it to guns and roses so what will the replica models look like and how will

[07:53] they be implemented exploding drummer obviously okay not sure what that means if that's going to be

[08:00] a mech but that's what the next bullet says the next one is really interesting 27 inch LCD monitor

[08:08] and DMD worlds first wow they're double screening us so the 27 inch is the big size monitor that's

[08:16] in Jersey Jack machines and DMD so that's really interesting that they're going to do both is that

[08:23] overkill do we need two screens maybe the DMD is for score and the big one is for what right that's

[08:31] my thing if you're gonna have that big screen I have to believe that you're gonna want to see clips

[08:35] from the movie it would be superfluous to have it having the score and animations and why would

[08:41] you need a DMD but this is a world's first it's never been done before is it a good move will it

[08:48] enhance the pinball experience I'm not sure we're gonna find out this September the next bullet is

[08:54] funny renowned home pin high quality build ends this with a quality build statement now I also think

[09:02] that not many people own a home pin and I know that there were some issues with home pin games but

[09:08] for the most part I've talked to Thunderbirds owners all like 50 of you and they don't really have

[09:13] many issues with their games other than the game itself is not great it's interesting because then

[09:18] below that in smaller print it says industry best warranty and service support now obviously I think

[09:25] manufacturers are going to be hitting this drum after what Jersey Jack pinball went through so

[09:30] proclaiming you have great warranty and customer service doesn't matter what people want to see is

[09:35] that you actually stand behind it so we shall see it then says special mechanisms design for exciting

[09:42] tap pinball action why would you bury that at the bottom if you have special mechanisms that really

[09:49] bring the spinal tap world to life wouldn't you want to highlight that further up in the flyer now

[09:55] maybe they're holding this back maybe they don't want to reveal everything in this flyer maybe

[10:00] this is just enough to get your appetite wet and to confirm that home pin has spinal tap pinball

[10:07] coming out and then it says worldwide availability proudly designed and manufactured in Taiwan by

[10:14] home pin Taiwan company limited all right so there you have it spinal tap pinball will be throwing

[10:20] its hat into the ring this September by home pin what are your thoughts what do you think you know

[10:26] what I think for this to be successful they need to integrate the theme properly it needs assets

[10:33] from the movie it needs to be at least as good as a stern pro I always say that if you're going to

[10:39] make a pinball machine in 2021 it needs to be at least as good as a stern pro the other big question

[10:47] marks for home pin is who designed this game I know Joe boss or I believe is over there did Joe

[10:53] boss or help with this game so we will find out notice it did not say who the designer is it also

[11:00] did not say who the code or is so home pin as a company has been someone of an enigma they really

[11:05] haven't done much they released one game that not many people liked and they haven't done much

[11:10] for a very long time Mike has moved the operation from China to Taiwan the real problem with home pin

[11:17] has been Mike's public relations issues he's been very strident he said things that are very

[11:23] inappropriate and he's pissed off a lot of people this company doesn't have good will but I'm

[11:29] here to tell you this and I know this community and people will forgive you and people will move on

[11:36] if you do one thing the best way to cancel being canceled in pinball is just come out with a good

[11:43] pinball machine be humble about it and here's the most important part make the machine if you make

[11:50] the machine and you put it in a box and you sell it to people and it brings them enjoyment they

[11:55] will forgive you Mike for all of your past actions they will they'll chalk you up as some ignorant

[12:01] older dude who doesn't really know what he's talking about you're not going to win any woke

[12:04] awards Mike but people will forgive you and you will sell pinball machines if you put an enticing

[12:11] pinball machine into the marketplace the same is true with American pinball as much as I rag on

[12:16] AP's older games the moment AP makes a game you want people will buy it and people will confidently

[12:23] buy from them because they believe in their manufacturing Mike is manufactured a game if you've made

[12:29] and shipped a game then you are on a good path to getting customers now if we go back in history it

[12:36] wasn't smooth sailing though like when people ordered thunderbirds they waited a long time to get

[12:41] their machines so I am curious on whether or not Mike has these games on the line because I think

[12:46] for him to get money right now I don't think people are going to buy this game unless they see

[12:52] production happening now I think that's the new table stakes and I think people who went in on

[12:57] phantom I mean look at the people who went in on phantom where is phantom where is haggis pinballs

[13:02] phantom they said those games were going to be shipped in July all right July August we're now

[13:08] it's September and I know Damien has hit some delays but you know what I'm saying it's like

[13:12] I don't think you should reveal your game I don't think you should reveal your game at all until

[13:18] production has begun it's just that simple it's too much of a gamble and nobody wants to wait

[13:24] months because here's the thing too for those of you who went in on phantom those of you who are now

[13:28] waiting and waiting and waiting I feel like some of you are going to wish your money was not tied up

[13:34] with phantom because now you've got spinal tap then you're going to get cactus canyon then you're

[13:39] going to get ap's new game then you're going to get stern godzilla what would be the point of

[13:43] locking your money up and waiting and waiting and waiting the only company out there that tells you

[13:49] flat out if you order a game and we give you your game number here's how long your weight is going

[13:55] to be is spooky pinball you know how many games they're making weekly you know how long your weight

[14:00] is going to be it is going to be an insane fall for pinball and I don't mean like fall like falling

[14:06] down I mean the season fall because there are so many games coming out on top of each other

[14:12] this is exciting this is exciting news to have more options in pinball none of us are invested in

[14:18] these companies if some of these companies succeed great if some of them fail great some of them

[14:22] are going to fail if you think there's enough space in the pinball industry to have this many

[14:28] companies you're wrong the only way that it works the only way it works is if each of these

[14:34] companies deliver stellar products you can't survive in pinball and come out with mediocre products

[14:41] with what's in the marketplace we've seen it happen like cosmic carnival came out with great artwork

[14:47] veiled you can't survive in pinball unless you have a consistent portfolio of great games like how

[14:54] his home pin still around like they didn't sell many thunderbirds they must be making money on some

[15:00] of their other redemption machines over there in china and tywan this has to be successful for mic

[15:06] there has to be a point in which you've invested all these years in a pinball company that you need

[15:10] to make profit you need to sell at volume so we shall see but this is exciting do I have high hopes

[15:18] for a home pin machine I have to be completely honest not yet do I hope Mike surprises us all with

[15:24] the machine that's really cool I absolutely do I always root for these machines to blow us away

[15:30] I want to be impressed by every new machine that comes out all right so speaking of being impressed

[15:37] let's talk quickly about pinball expo 2021 before we get to that I want to say that for those of

[15:44] you in the northeast there is going to be a coin taker tailgate party on my birthday September 25th

[15:53] at coin taker there are going to be a lot of pinball machines a lot of food and a lot of pinball

[16:00] personalities there yours truly might make the trek it's my birthday Brenda has something planned

[16:06] so I'm not sure I can make it but I know john borg is going to be there Eric minniars going to be

[16:12] Christopher france is going to be there Christian lines going to be there and it's going to be

[16:16] an amazing time if you've never been to coin taker I would absolutely think about making the trek and

[16:22] for those of you in the northeast absolutely worth it and I know some people might drive from all

[16:28] over the place to hang out with their favorite pinball personalities and I also want to say that

[16:33] they're somewhat worried about volume of people so if you go to their website I think you can buy

[16:39] a ticket to the affair so make sure you grab your ticket so they know how many hamburgers to get

[16:44] for you guys I don't think any vegans are making their way to this party all right so pinball exbow

[16:49] 2021 I do plan on going and I just want to say as I was looking over the calendar of events at pinball

[16:58] exbow I was beyond shocked to see that Mirko playfields Mirko himself wants to have a seminar

[17:06] discussion or reveal what's new at Mirko at Saturday morning 9 a.m. why do you think Mirko is going

[17:14] to be talking at exbow and should he even be showing up at pinball exbow and I just want to give

[17:20] my thoughts on this because I think Mirko going to exbow to talk to us about what's new at Mirko

[17:28] I'm sorry Mirko you're not welcome you're not welcome the amount of issues we've had with your

[17:34] playfields nobody wants to hear from you are you gonna label this seminar trust us this time

[17:41] because this is the fourth or fifth time he's gone up on stage and he's convinced us that all of

[17:47] his playfields have been solved and there will no longer be issues we've seen his videos I'm tired

[17:53] of hearing from Mirko Mirko I don't want to hear from you nobody else does I just want you to make

[17:58] quality playfields and I want you to stop convincing us that you fix the problems that are your own

[18:03] and just get it done but also it's funny to me that he's taking the stage at 9 a.m. on a Saturday

[18:09] everyone is still sleeping off the party from Friday night so if you think that time slot is by

[18:15] mistake absolutely not so let's go on stage at a time when nobody is gonna be up but I'll tell you

[18:22] this if Mirko is there at 9 a.m. and he can actually get into the country because of COVID I'm

[18:28] not sure he's gonna be able to get into the country I will be there and I want to ask him questions

[18:34] about what is up with all of this I'm not gonna be rude I'm not gonna be disrespectful I'm not

[18:41] gonna boo the man that's the other thing people we're all grown adults if we have issues with

[18:46] companies or personalities or products talk to people like a grown adult do not act like a child

[18:53] do not boo people do not threaten people physically we're gonna get to that with Jeff in this

[18:57] weekend pinball but that being said also don't be a coward I'm always surprised when I go to pinball

[19:03] shows and everyone's like I'm gonna give it to Jay pop I'm gonna give it to Kevin Kool-Aik I'm

[19:08] gonna tell them how I really feel and then no one ever does it's like a room full of cowards I've

[19:12] been there and I've been there with all of you guys and I see how quickly you fold like lawn chairs

[19:17] when you're in front of your pinball personalities and your pinball manufacturers why not grab a mic

[19:23] stand up and ask a tough question the same is gonna happen for Jersey Jack when they get up

[19:28] there Friday night like they're doing the end of day Friday seminar and I was talking to Jack

[19:34] yesterday and I just told him look I mean everyone loves Eric everyone loves what Jjp is trying to

[19:39] do with pinball the problem people have with Jjp is Mirko play fields the problem they have is with

[19:45] the customer service nobody's got a problem with Eric everybody loves Eric but because you're in bed

[19:50] with Mirko Jjp when you get up on stage and you want to talk about what right why would they get

[19:56] up on stage two if they're not going to show their new game or they're not going to tease their new

[20:01] game does anyone really want to hear about the making of G&R right now I mean they did a great job

[20:07] showing us how they made this machine the launch of guns and roses was the best ever but with

[20:12] everything going on in the Jersey Jack world if you're gonna get up on stage the smart thing to do

[20:19] would be maybe to talk about some changes you're making to your customer service some new things

[20:25] you're going to do to improve your customer experience and here's what I would do if I were them

[20:30] because I think Jersey Jack is sitting on a solution to some of their problems and it's simply this

[20:35] why is it when I buy a pinball machine and it's not just Jersey Jack it's from other people too

[20:40] but why is it when I buy a pinball machine for a lot of money and I want to buy backup play fields

[20:46] I want to buy backup spotlights for guns and roses I want to buy backup ramps

[20:51] why does in Jersey Jack pinball have a website where its customers can go on and buy parts and not

[20:59] have to go through distributors not have to share serial numbers not have to jump through different

[21:04] hoops or get approval to buy backup parts for the very game you own and love why don't they have

[21:11] if I were Jersey Jack and you've got like almost two months now between now and expo I would think

[21:18] long and hard about what you want to get up there and say so it doesn't turn into a bunch of

[21:25] people complaining about the quality of your products I would get in front of it and showcase

[21:31] something or announce a new thing you're going to do to help people get parts faster if they're having

[21:36] any issues and then announce your policy moving forward the crazy part is this the one thing people

[21:42] want to hear is Jersey Jack to get up there grab the mic and say moving forward we are going to

[21:49] offer a warranty on all of our play fields moving forward I think you need to say that I think you

[21:54] need to get the applause that will happen if you say that but I think if you continue to remove

[21:59] the things you're covering in your games and you want to get up on stage a year after the game

[22:04] came out I mean we know what Jack wants to do he wants to say hey we sold 5,000 or 6,000 he wants

[22:10] to do that victory lap but I just think in the climate right now and knowing that like Stern's

[22:16] going to be showing new games all these new games coming out I'm just not sure they quite understand

[22:22] where people are at and maybe it's not the best year to get up on stage and that's okay too if

[22:28] you have nothing new to say Jersey Jack it's okay not to do a seminar just because Pimble expo is

[22:34] happening and it's in your backyard it doesn't mean you should go up there I'm just saying that as

[22:38] a marketing and communications professional sometimes you need to know when to take the stage

[22:43] and sometimes you need to know when not to and look also like a lot of companies like Ferrari

[22:48] Lamborghini they don't do presentations at car shows they're above that not to say that Jersey

[22:53] Jack is but you know what I mean sometimes it's good to keep people guessing what's next let me

[22:58] end the show real quickly talking about the hiatus over at this week in Pimble I don't know the

[23:02] details I don't know what happened all I can go off of is what I read that Jeff was doing a

[23:08] story on deep route and he started to get some cryptic anonymous messages from people that were

[23:13] threatening him some more borderline blackmail and he just decided this is not worth it and I'm

[23:20] gonna take a break from the show now I talk to Jeff he's just taking a break it's not going away

[23:25] forever I don't think we're gonna go without the twippy's in 2022 so I wouldn't worry about that either

[23:30] I've been in the situation Jeff is in right now and I've had people do the same exact thing to

[23:36] me multiple times and what sucks about it is this it always comes from an anonymous person they never

[23:44] stand behind their hate and they will say the most deplorable and disgusting stuff to you they will

[23:50] threaten your life your livelihood your family all these horrible things right we're in this to

[23:56] talk about our love of Pimble Pimble and blackmail should not go hand in hand and when you're on

[24:01] the receiving end of it and I mean this and Jeff's out there with his family and you get this kind of

[24:07] message and you get these people trying to take you down like this the thing that happens immediately

[24:13] is you need jerk panic and you just say it's not worth it I'm turning it off and I do the same thing

[24:18] I do the same thing and from experience I can tell you the cowards are simply that they're cowards

[24:24] but what it does do is it absolutely destroys your enthusiasm for Pimble it destroys your

[24:30] enthusiasm to talk about Pimble and it destroys your sort of desire to even contribute back to the

[24:36] Pimble community because why would I want to be a part of a community in which this even exists

[24:42] why would I want to be part of a community that even allows this kind of behavior problem is

[24:47] there anonymous there's no way to out who they are it's the internet and the internet has allowed

[24:53] this level of bullying and this level of harassment and there's nothing you can do about it I

[24:58] mean look at what's happening at Twitch with their racist issues right now it is so hard to stop

[25:04] jerks on the internet from disrupting your good time the more you put yourself out there you put

[25:10] yourself out there as a target and that is why when I turn my show back on I'm like I'm not going

[25:15] to personally attack people I am simply trying to do a fun entertaining show about Pimble you know

[25:20] I haven't had much blowback or much haters I've got some haters that I just block and ban them

[25:25] from my Facebook page and I move on and I do like that ability to just block people and move on

[25:30] because life is too short and Pimble is too much fun and Pimble is not something that we wake up

[25:35] and want to have stress or anxiety around that's not why we're into Pimble so I know Jeff will be

[25:40] back I know he's going to take a break he needs this break in general you guys will survive without

[25:47] you're this week in Pimble fix his website is great it gives us a lot of information a lot of

[25:52] deep dives I think it's going to be hard for Jeff to stay away with all these games coming out I

[25:57] mean this is when it's going to be the most fun this year the second half of this year is going to

[26:01] be where all the excitement lies and I can't wait to cover it I can't wait to do more shows around

[26:07] it and I also think this I don't think some anonymous coward should be able to destroy your ability

[26:12] to enjoy Canadian Pimble podcast I don't think it should be able to destroy your ability to

[26:17] enjoy this week in Pimble and I think the anonymous cowards and you know who they are and they know

[26:22] who they are I always feel bad for them because they got to wake up knowing that they gave that

[26:26] kind of hate and they tried to destroy someone and they have the saddest lives imaginable because I

[26:32] would never ever anonymously try to destroy somebody like that I mean it's just horrible it has

[26:38] no place in our hobby it has no place in society and it absolutely has no place in Pimble so everybody

[26:44] this has been episode 611 of Canadian Pimble podcast I want to thank all of my Patreon supporters we

[26:51] are now at a hundred and 44 people are supporting Canadian Pimble podcast if you're listening and you

[26:59] say Chris I've enjoyed every episode and I want to support you on a monthly basis please we welcome

[27:11] are about to come out and they are going to be opened up to club members early so if you want one

[27:17] there's only going to be a hundred and twenty two viva la raza t-shirts made that's the number

[27:22] of orders deep root got and I want to say deep roots done deep root is absolutely done I think

[27:29] that some people are still holding on and here's my closing thoughts on all of this it is time

[27:35] it is time for Steve Bouton John Norris and Barrio to call it look I think they need to call it

[27:41] Steve Barry John you're one of us you're part of the Pimble community we know that you also got

[27:48] misled by Robert Mueller but it's time for them to call it none of them have said anything and I'm

[27:54] sorry but it's over I don't understand how they're still holding on to hope more more stories are

[28:00] going to come out about deep root but I'm also like tired of covering deep root if you've seen

[28:04] the photos they left that facility a long time ago the whole thing has been a lie for a long time

[28:13] and those people working there they knew stuff was horribly wrong for much longer than they let on

[28:20] and I'm willing to forgive them but they now need to come out and call it I'm calling on you Steve

[28:27] Barrio and John Norris it's time to call it all right Dennis Norman told everybody in 2019

[28:35] games were never going to be made and look we love Dennis he's back at AP he's now one of the good

[28:41] guys he defected at the right time but will they call it let's see I don't want to see them smiling

[28:47] in front of stern machines all right everybody episode 611 have a good day
