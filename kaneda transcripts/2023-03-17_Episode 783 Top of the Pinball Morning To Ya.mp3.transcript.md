[00:00] Happy St. Patrick's Day everybody!

[00:18] I'm gonna head to PJ Clarks today on 54th Street and I'm gonna drink some JMO!

[00:24] Alright, so let's talk about pinball on this St. Paddy's Day.

[00:28] What a great March it's been for pinball.

[00:30] I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had to like decompress the sheer amount of

[00:35] information, news, and games that have come out this month.

[00:39] And I'm gonna start with Pulp Fiction.

[00:40] If you haven't heard the Loser Kid Pinball podcast, go listen to it.

[00:44] A lot of really great information on the game, the ruleset, how many years they've been making

[00:50] this game.

[00:52] And also like the thing that I'm most excited about is David Thiel's work on this game.

[00:56] You know that's what's interesting about this Pulp Fiction game.

[00:59] Not only is it like an incredible theme for pinball, but without a display, the sound

[01:04] effects and the music are gonna be so important in creating the atmosphere for that game.

[01:10] And I think they're gonna nail it.

[01:12] And David Thiel is like the greatest musical composer in the history of pinball.

[01:17] I mean it.

[01:18] When you stand in front of one of his sound packages, whether it's Alien or Pirates of

[01:22] the Caribbean, he's what made Jersey Jack Pinball Machines sound so good.

[01:28] And his departure is the reason why Jersey Jack Pinball Machines have sound so poorly

[01:33] and like slot machines ever since David has stopped working with JJP.

[01:38] Now look, he's a hired gun.

[01:40] And it is shocking to me that Jersey Jack Pinball never got him back on the roster.

[01:44] So Pulp Fiction, it's still crazy.

[01:47] This game is still basically sold out.

[01:49] You can't find a single limited edition version of Pulp Fiction anywhere.

[01:54] Now here's the craziest part.

[01:56] And as someone who has been like scalping machines for like six years now, here's the

[02:00] real scary part.

[02:01] Think about this.

[02:02] A thousand Pulp Fiction deposits have been paid.

[02:05] A thousand.

[02:07] How many of them have popped up for sale since people bought their spots?

[02:12] Zero.

[02:13] Not one single person has tried to flip this game yet.

[02:17] And this is an easy window to go grab like, I don't know, you could probably sell a spot

[02:21] now for at least 1500 or maybe even 2000.

[02:26] But we haven't seen one single person test the marketplace on this game.

[02:31] The other reason why I think no one's actually listed a deposit spot for sale is nobody wants

[02:36] to lose that spot.

[02:37] And it's way too early.

[02:39] That's the other thing.

[02:40] I'm still kind of confused that this game, the early of this game is not going to go on

[02:44] the line until sometime like September, October.

[02:48] Then why did they reveal the game now?

[02:51] Seeing the way people responded to this game, I think people would have responded to this

[02:55] game any time of year.

[02:57] And so CGC does not have a great track record of making machines and making them efficiently.

[03:04] They have a good track record of building a quality product.

[03:07] But when you get that quality product is the real issue.

[03:12] And they've got all this backlog on like Cactus Canyon games to make.

[03:16] And so if you're a Cactus Canyon guy right now, you're not really happy that they're

[03:20] going to now make Pulp Fiction.

[03:22] You're not really excited by this because now you might have deposits down for two games.

[03:27] You are going to wait forever.

[03:29] You want to hear a rumor I heard?

[03:31] I heard that Chicago Gaming Company's next game, it's not going to be Twilight Zone.

[03:36] Their next throwback game, and this makes total sense.

[03:40] Now I'm hearing the next game they're going to make is the Addams Family.

[03:43] Now if you look at the popularity of Wednesday, it's the most popular Netflix show of all

[03:48] time.

[03:49] What a great time to rerun the Addams Family.

[03:51] But where would that even go into the schedule, right?

[03:54] You've got to make these Cactus Canyons.

[03:56] Then you've got to make all these Pulp Fictions and think about it.

[03:59] They're going to sell so many Pulp Fiction machines that they're going to be making Pulp

[04:04] Fiction games well into 2025.

[04:07] And so if the next game is the Addams Family, I wouldn't expect to see that machine until

[04:11] sometime in like 2026.

[04:14] Here's the problem, right?

[04:16] Here's the problem with these companies when you have a hit title.

[04:19] Nobody can really make games fast enough anymore.

[04:22] We have such ADD with all of these pinball machines.

[04:25] Stern Pinball is the only company that can basically make a few thousand games in a single

[04:31] month.

[04:32] And that is a crazy feat in pinball.

[04:35] After Stern Pinball, the next greatest efficiencies are what?

[04:39] Are what?

[04:40] Jersey Jack Pinball?

[04:41] How many are they making a week?

[04:43] Maybe 150, maybe 200 on an amazing week in which everyone is like soldering properly.

[04:51] Spooky Pinball is making like 50 or so a week.

[04:54] I mean, that's what's crazy.

[04:55] It's like it's really easy to show a game people want and take a few thousand orders,

[05:01] but then you've got to go make them.

[05:03] Like Chicago Gaming Company, I have no idea.

[05:05] I think they're like kind of like Spooky Pinball.

[05:07] I think they're around the 50 games a week standpoint.

[05:10] So think about it.

[05:11] If you sell 1000 pulp fictions and you can only make 50 a week, it's a long wait to get

[05:17] to the games.

[05:18] And that's just the LE people.

[05:20] That's not the SE or the SE whatever standard that they're also making.

[05:24] They have three tiers of this game they're going to be taking orders on.

[05:28] I also just love the fact that people are excited by a game that doesn't have an LCD

[05:33] screen.

[05:34] I don't understand why this would upset anybody.

[05:37] And here's why, because if you like an LCD screen, guess what?

[05:42] Everyone else is making games with an LCD screen.

[05:45] You can go get a 27 inch screen with the Godfather.

[05:48] You can go get Stern's screen in every single one of their games.

[05:51] It is good to have options.

[05:53] I love the fact that Pinball is now coming to us in many different forms.

[05:57] And look, I'm not a dummy.

[05:58] I'm reading the thread around James Bond 60th.

[06:01] And I'm telling you this right now, the game is phenomenal.

[06:04] Like these owners are loving the game.

[06:06] Now, do we trust these owners, you know, these people who spend $20,000 on this single level

[06:13] game with barely any assets?

[06:15] I don't really believe them because of course they're going to justify the game.

[06:19] But some people are saying this is the greatest shooting pinball machine of all time.

[06:24] Do you believe that?

[06:25] I actually believe that this is the greatest shooting pinball machine of all time.

[06:30] It's the most expensive machine that's ever been sold by a pinball manufacturer to anybody.

[06:35] But I'm not so sure it's the greatest machine of all time.

[06:39] But what I do like about these single level games, it's reminding people what pinball used to be.

[06:45] And how you used to be able to walk up to a pinball machine, know what to do,

[06:51] and find enjoyment in the game on a single level machine that wasn't ultra confusing.

[06:57] And when you hear the way they're developing Pulp Fiction, it sounds like it's going to be a lot like that.

[07:02] Like you're going to walk up to it, you're going to know what to do,

[07:05] you're going to know how to start the different modes,

[07:08] but it's still going to be really challenging to get through the entire game.

[07:12] And that will keep you coming back for more.

[07:15] What I don't like about a lot of the modern pinball machines now is like there's so much happening on the screen.

[07:21] There's so much you have to memorize and also there's just so much you'll never see.

[07:25] There's so much you'll just never see or want to engage with.

[07:29] And the reason why you don't want to engage with it is it's just too much, it's too confusing.

[07:34] And look, some people like those ultra deep and I would say ultra complex rule sets,

[07:40] I would argue the majority of us do not.

[07:42] We don't want a game to be too easy.

[07:44] We don't want to see everything right away.

[07:46] Like you could have tales of the Arabian Knights and you could finish that game in one weekend

[07:51] and there's never going to be anything new in the game you haven't seen.

[07:54] But I think modern pinball coders are smarter and they know how to add stuff.

[07:59] That is really challenging to get to.

[08:01] And that's all you really want, right?

[08:03] You want that Valoranor, you want that thing to reach for,

[08:06] you want that final wizard mode that requires you to do a lot of really crazy stuff

[08:11] with three balls on a pinball machine.

[08:13] And we're going to get that in all of these games.

[08:15] The thing I don't know when we're going to get is Galactic Tank Force.

[08:19] Where is this machine?

[08:21] It is at the point now where on pin side people are debating whether or not a screw on the

[08:26] Translight is a freaking camera.

[08:29] There is no camera in this game people.

[08:32] It's just a black screw.

[08:34] Can we please stop imagining bonus features in this game that do not exist?

[08:39] Look, it was Dennis Nordman's birthday yesterday.

[08:41] It would have been a great day to reveal the game on his birthday.

[08:46] It is now Friday, St. Patrick's Day, and we still don't know where this game is.

[08:51] The word on the street is that American Pinball is going to release this game the week

[08:56] leading up to Texas Pinball Festival.

[08:58] Well, guess what?

[08:58] It is the week leading up to Texas Pinball Festival.

[09:01] I was told this game was going to be at Jack Bar tomorrow.

[09:05] I don't believe it.

[09:05] I don't believe it.

[09:06] John does not have the game.

[09:08] I doubt it's going to be shipped to him on a Saturday unless someone's going to drive

[09:12] it over to him.

[09:14] I think we're going to see the final reveal tomorrow.

[09:16] If we look at the other teasers, when do they drop them?

[09:19] They've been dropping them all Saturday morning at like 9.30 in the morning or 9 a.m.

[09:25] They've been dropping them all right before my spectacular.

[09:28] So I fully expect to see the full game tomorrow.

[09:31] What I've been hearing is they've been wrestling with how much to price the game at and how many to make.

[09:38] The thing with American Pinball is this.

[09:40] I think they need to shy away from making too many of these deluxe tank additions because

[09:45] I think they need to make them really unique and rare.

[09:49] When you have an original IP like this, I don't care if it's a Dennis Nordman game.

[09:53] It's a really hard sell next to Pulp Fiction, next to Foo Fighters, next to Scooby-Doo.

[09:58] If you have an original IP game, you've got to work extra hard to get the FOMO into the game.

[10:04] The other thing is this.

[10:05] Looking at that damn game, people, there is no way that game is going to be less than $10,000.

[10:11] That freaking full tank addition.

[10:13] There's no way.

[10:14] I mean, there's just so much more in this game.

[10:17] Everybody, you got to remember, Legends of Vahala, I would say is a pretty empty game.

[10:22] Legends of Vahala was $8,700.

[10:26] And you're telling me with that freaking tank and the turret and all the stuff on that play field,

[10:32] you're telling me that game is just going to be like $1,000 more than Legends of Vahala was.

[10:38] Get out of town, people.

[10:39] I expect this tank version to be closer to $13,000.

[10:44] I think they're going to make somewhere between like $150,000 to $250,000 of them.

[10:48] If they make $500 of them, good luck trying to sell $500 at $13,000.

[10:54] There's no FOMO there for such a unique quirky thing.

[10:57] And then the other addition of the game, which is the one most people are going to buy,

[11:01] because most people are not going to need this freaking tank thing in their house.

[11:05] I think we're going to see that at like $9,200.

[11:09] Again, I'm going off of what Legends of Vahala was.

[11:12] What I wish American Pinball would do is just release this damn thing.

[11:17] So hopefully we'll see it today.

[11:19] All right, what else is going on in Pinball?

[11:21] Godfather, Ellie's are going out the door.

[11:24] Now, I've been reading people's reviews of Godfather.

[11:26] I saw Carrie Hardy's video.

[11:28] I didn't think it was fair that Carrie kind of reviewed it after only playing it three times.

[11:33] Like he glows about Foo Fighters.

[11:36] And then he plays Godfather three times and he's kind of sour on the game.

[11:41] I think if you're going to give your first gameplay impressions, you got to play it more.

[11:45] You got to play it at least like 20 to 30 times.

[11:48] You also, if you're going to play a Jersey Jack machine on location,

[11:52] you got to walk up to it with headphones.

[11:55] You have to hear the game the right way.

[11:57] You can't review a game in a loud arcade and really absorb what they put into the game.

[12:04] It's terrible.

[12:04] It's a terrible way to review the game.

[12:06] So I think there's going to be a lot more Godfather reviews popping up.

[12:10] I've been hearing a mixed bag thing about the game.

[12:13] Like I haven't played the game.

[12:15] I can't indict the game on any other level than artwork on theme integration,

[12:21] on light shows and sound, right?

[12:23] Because I've heard all that from the internet streams.

[12:26] So I'm allowed to give my opinions about that stuff.

[12:29] But what I've been telling all of my friends on the side,

[12:31] and you guys are all my friends, so I'll tell you this right now.

[12:34] I do think the flame on Godfather is going to go out pretty quickly.

[12:39] I do.

[12:39] I don't think this is going to be one of these games where people are going to be clamoring

[12:43] to have it for like six to eight months.

[12:45] It's not going to have the kind of frenzy that Guns N' Roses had.

[12:49] And I think people are going to get it.

[12:51] I think they're going to enjoy the way it shoots.

[12:54] But I think this campy gangster game that's not really the Godfather

[12:58] is going to wear thin pretty quickly in people's collections.

[13:02] And you're going to move on to other stuff.

[13:04] You know, and I think Jersey Jack Pinball is just in an interesting place.

[13:08] I've been speaking to many distributors,

[13:10] and they're not happy with Jersey Jack Pinball right now,

[13:13] because Jersey Jack Pinball sold 500 of the collector's editions directly from JJP.

[13:21] It's a much better margin if they sell it directly.

[13:23] The problem is those distributors, many of which are sitting on unsold toy story inventory,

[13:30] really wanted to get these CE sales.

[13:32] Because think about it, for every CE a distributor sells,

[13:35] they're probably making $1,500 to $2,000.

[13:40] So let's say you're a distributor and they cut your allotment of CE's by 10 games.

[13:45] That's $20,000 you are not going to make simply because Jersey Jack Pinball wants to sell it directly.

[13:53] Why would you be happy about that?

[13:54] And the other part I'm hearing is this,

[13:55] is that the ellies of this game are not selling very well,

[13:59] and the reason why they're not selling great is the price.

[14:02] It's not the game, it's the price.

[14:04] If this game was like $9,004 in LE,

[14:08] I think a lot more people would be buying them,

[14:11] putting them in their homes, like checking the game out.

[14:15] But nobody wants to check out a game for $12,000.

[14:19] They really don't.

[14:20] And the CE just looks so much better than the ellies,

[14:23] so that's the one everybody wants with that crazy topper with the Tommy guns.

[14:28] I'm just a little worried that Jersey Jack's going to do the same thing again.

[14:32] By the time the CE's go on the line,

[14:35] the game's excitement is going to wear a little thin.

[14:39] We will see what happens.

[14:40] I'm already seeing some Godfather's CE spots pop up for sale,

[14:44] like deposits pop up for sale for like $2,200.

[14:48] So that's like a $300 loss.

[14:50] Again, I'm just measuring this game against the popularity of pulp fiction.

[14:56] And I think the pulp fiction excitement,

[14:57] this is crazy to say this,

[14:59] the pulp fiction excitement with no LCD screen,

[15:02] I think is like 10 times greater than the Godfather's CE excitement.

[15:07] I never thought I'd be saying this,

[15:09] like that a game with no display could get people more excited

[15:13] about its theme integration than a game with a 27 inch screen.

[15:17] And when Eric Mignor said,

[15:18] we have all of the assets and iconic scenes from the movie,

[15:22] I just don't feel that way when I watch someone play the Godfather.

[15:26] All right, so Godfather, Scooby-Doo,

[15:28] we've got 1,969 Scooby-Doo's to make.

[15:33] Wow.

[15:33] I mean, when you say it like that,

[15:35] Kenyatta, it feels like they're going to be making Scooby-Doo's forever.

[15:38] And I feel like 1,968 are going to be collector's editions.

[15:43] You notice how spooky still hasn't shown us the version of the game

[15:46] with no scopes in it.

[15:47] I can't wait to see this thing.

[15:48] It's going to look so bad.

[15:50] And the reason why is they know that no one's going to want that game.

[15:54] Operators are not going to want it,

[15:55] collectors are not going to want it.

[15:57] And it's going to end up being like the rarest version of the game,

[15:59] like the game with no scopes.

[16:01] Look, Spooky was smart.

[16:03] They were smart.

[16:04] They came out first.

[16:05] They locked in all of that money first.

[16:09] You can't get out of your Scooby-Doo order,

[16:11] even if you want to.

[16:13] They're going to make so many of these games.

[16:15] They're going to be so easy to get

[16:18] that if you want a Scooby-Doo,

[16:19] you're going to be able to get one for like 2,000 to 3,000 less

[16:22] than if you bought it on day one.

[16:24] And I think a lot of people are going to play the market like that.

[16:26] I think it's a buyer's market.

[16:27] I think a lot of these games are going to lose value right away.

[16:30] Is a Foo Fighters LE at 13K,

[16:33] is it going to be worth more than 13K in three months?

[16:36] I don't know.

[16:37] You know, look, I think everyone's feeling the same thing.

[16:39] Every game is overpriced right now.

[16:41] Just buy what you want.

[16:42] Buy what you want to keep.

[16:43] Buy what you want to keep in your collection for a long time.

[16:46] Don't run and buy everything immediately.

[16:48] I've been saying this to my friends.

[16:49] You feel left out right of the freaking Pulp Fiction LE.

[16:53] You're not going to have a hard time getting a Pulp Fiction LE people.

[16:56] Trust me. Trust me.

[16:57] There are many people out there that are holding on to them.

[17:00] There are distributors holding on to them.

[17:02] There are a lot of people playing the market on the game.

[17:05] And the good news is this,

[17:06] is Pulp Fiction LE is not crazy expensive, right?

[17:09] It's like less than 10,000.

[17:11] So even when people try to scalp one,

[17:14] they're not going to be scalping it for like 18 grand.

[17:17] I think you're going to see Pulp Fiction's go for like 11 to 1200 bucks.

[17:20] This was the good old days of scalping.

[17:23] We used to make a couple thousand dollars and everybody felt happy before it got stupid,

[17:28] right?

[17:29] Before like a stranger things went from being 8,500 to 18,000.

[17:33] Like COVID made everything so stupid.

[17:35] All right. What else is going on in pinball?

[17:37] Is anybody even talking about?

[17:40] I don't even see anybody talk about the fact on pinside that Twilight Zone is going to be

[17:45] remade by that pendready gaming company in Italy.

[17:48] Somebody go start that thread and throw me a freaking bone.

[17:51] Speaking of making new games, have you seen this Turner pinball video?

[17:55] I put it up on my Facebook page.

[17:57] I don't know what the heck he's doing.

[17:59] I see another guy with pinball stars in his eyes.

[18:02] I see this big factory with nothing being made.

[18:05] Again, what is it with these people?

[18:07] If there ever was a time we didn't need another pinball company, it's right now.

[18:13] We don't need any more.

[18:14] I mean, freaking think about it people.

[18:16] We have eight new games coming to you from eight different companies.

[18:21] Eight companies, eight games.

[18:24] Who the heck would go into pinball right now?

[18:27] Stern is still going to clobber everybody and now we have another person throwing his hat into the

[18:32] ring with absolutely no experience manufacturing a game.

[18:37] When I see this guy with his prototype, it's like nobody learns.

[18:41] It is so easy to make a pinball prototype.

[18:45] It is almost impossible to set up a pinball manufacturing company as Dutch pinball,

[18:52] as Haggis pinball, as pinball brothers.

[18:54] I mean, you can go down a list of the amount of startup pinball ventures.

[18:59] Their initial manufacturing attempts failed horribly.

[19:02] So why would we be excited?

[19:04] And then you look at this whitewood.

[19:06] It's not exciting at all.

[19:07] So why are you getting on a plane and spending money to go to Texas to talk to people about what?

[19:14] What are we going to hear from Mr. Turner?

[19:16] I don't care about his ambitions and his dreams in pinball.

[19:19] I find it offensive.

[19:20] I almost find it borderline offensive that he's going to have a booth at TPF and spend

[19:25] money to show us that freaking whitewood.

[19:28] What's wrong with people?

[19:29] I mean, why is Haggis pinball even flying to TPF?

[19:32] Why would they spend any money flying to TPF?

[19:36] When they have all of these fathoms to make?

[19:39] That is a week where you are out of the office.

[19:41] It's just money you shouldn't be spending.

[19:43] It's just that simple.

[19:45] Don't travel and do any victory lap until you're done building the freaking games.

[19:51] Or there's someone back at the factory building the freaking games.

[19:55] I am curious to see if Haggis makes it to the next game.

[19:58] Everyone's forgotten my rumor.

[20:00] I'm going to say it again.

[20:01] Marty Robbins is making a game.

[20:03] Marty Robbins' game is...

[20:06] War of the Worlds.

[20:07] The War of the Worlds story, like the Orson Welles story, it is open IP.

[20:13] So that is what I am hearing is Marty Robbins is making War of the Worlds.

[20:17] Do me a favor.

[20:17] When you see him at Texas, be like, hey Marty, how's War of the Worlds coming along?

[20:21] Just scream it as loud as you can and see his reaction.

[20:24] Can someone do that for Kaneda?

[20:25] I mean, look, I'm going to walk around the show.

[20:27] I was talking to Kim and Ed.

[20:28] They're so nice.

[20:29] I can't wait to get the TPF.

[20:31] They've set me up with a media badge.

[20:33] I'm going to be able to play the games after the show closes because I hate trying to absorb

[20:38] these games when every game is on at the same time and it's super crowded in there.

[20:43] Is Kaneda getting special treatment?

[20:44] No, I am not.

[20:46] I have spent many years making a lot of content and promoting Texas Pinball Festival.

[20:51] I'm excited.

[20:51] I'm excited to hang out with you guys at the happy hour at Perry's.

[20:55] I'm excited for the Twippies, even though I think the Twippies should cut the length of the show to

[20:59] just an hour this year.

[21:01] Like nobody wants to celebrate last year's games with all of this excitement going on.

[21:07] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[21:09] We're almost at 580 subscribers.

[21:12] I mean, the Kaneda Pinball podcast keeps growing in popularity.

[21:16] I've been listening to the other shows, but man, man, everyone's going like 90 minutes again.

[21:20] Like I just don't get it.

[21:22] Look, we're barely at 25 minutes and we've covered off on everything going on in Pinball.

[21:28] Let's just take another hour and we'll just like debate more of this stuff.

[21:31] No, this is what you want.

[21:33] I love that you're here and we're going to do more shows.

[21:35] I hope Galactic Tank Force gets revealed today because then I'll do another show tomorrow.

[21:39] Oh, and also I am traveling to Las Vegas Sunday night for that Dodge Last Call event at Vegas Speedway.

[21:47] I might win a chance to buy like some thousand horsepower car or they might hand me a sweatshirt

[21:53] that says, thanks for your loyalty.

[21:55] I'm flying in Sunday night.

[21:57] The event is from like two to seven Monday and then I'm taking a red eye out of Vegas

[22:04] and land in New York Tuesday morning at 7am.

[22:07] It's a crazy trip and then I fly to Texas on Friday.

[22:10] It's going to be an incredible like week and a half.

[22:12] I'm so excited.

[22:13] Everybody have a great St. Patrick's Day and do me a favor.

[22:17] Go get a glass of Jameson and raise a toast to our lives together in this Pinball community later.

[22:25] Top of the morning to you.
