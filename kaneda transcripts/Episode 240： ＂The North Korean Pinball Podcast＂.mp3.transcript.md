[00:00] I don't believe it, I fall in love, you're under the guise, so you take it on the

[00:09] road.

[00:17] Welcome to episode 240 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:23] This is the only podcast that implements on every single show, Christopher Francis, Pinball

[00:31] Podcasting tips.

[00:32] It's Sweep in the Nation.

[00:33] I mean, those tips, they're spreading from Asia to Europe to America.

[00:39] Every Pinball Podcast or out there is figuring out how they can implement them, but luckily

[00:44] for this show, we put them in place from the very beginning.

[00:47] All right, thank you, Christopher.

[00:49] We really appreciate those tips.

[00:50] All right, here's what we're going to do on episode 240 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:55] We're just going to do a little news sort of segment.

[00:57] We're going to go down on what's happening with each manufacturer.

[01:00] We want to talk about that.

[01:01] We haven't done that in a while.

[01:03] We've been doing a lot of nice long interviews for you guys to enjoy.

[01:07] I also want to talk about the definitive Pinball Podcasting list that is on Pinside right

[01:13] now.

[01:14] I want to chat about one podcast that is missing from that list.

[01:18] I don't have any new emails from you guys.

[01:22] So if you want to talk about anything Pinball on this show, email me at canadapinballatgmail.com.

[01:29] I'm actually going to start this show by asking you guys to email me questions for someone

[01:35] who is going to come on the show tomorrow.

[01:38] Tomorrow evening, I am going to be interviewing Jerry from P3 Multimorphic about his platform

[01:46] and his games.

[01:47] Okay?

[01:48] Here's what I want you to do.

[01:49] I want you to email me at canadapinballatgmail.com.

[01:54] Any questions that you would like me to ask Jerry.

[01:58] Any questions?

[01:59] I don't have to say your name.

[02:00] I can ask the questions anonymously.

[02:02] I will make sure that none of the questions are either highly offensive or derogatory,

[02:08] so don't be a jerk.

[02:10] But I would ask anything you want of Jerry.

[02:13] So please do that because I want to make some of what our conversation is about your questions

[02:18] to him.

[02:19] And Jerry hit me up.

[02:20] And the reason he wants to talk is he has some questions about some of the coverage I've

[02:26] been giving P3 Multimorphic.

[02:29] So as I always say to everybody, come on the show.

[02:32] Let's discuss it.

[02:33] Let's have a good conversation and the floor is yours.

[02:36] I mean, this podcast does not hide from interviewing anyone, giving anyone the chance who wants

[02:43] it to have the floor and talk about Pinball.

[02:46] And I think what's funny for you guys to know is that some of the most prolific people

[02:53] who post on the forums and talk so much about Pinball, guys like Crazy Levy, guys like Ice

[02:59] Man.

[03:00] Do you not think I have extended invites to those two gentlemen so many times and every

[03:08] time there's some reason why they can't do it?

[03:11] So here's what I like to do because I know they both listen.

[03:14] I think they do.

[03:15] I would love to have Ice Man and Crazy Levy.

[03:19] You know, we should also get KPG into it.

[03:22] Let's get all of them on to this podcast for some amazing battery out of the most prolific

[03:28] and outspoken pinball personalities out there on the forums.

[03:32] Let's see if they accept that challenge.

[03:34] If we can do it, let's give them some time.

[03:36] You know, because they've always got so many excuses, let's give them to the end of June

[03:40] to accept that offer.

[03:42] They know my email, they know me on Facebook, they know how to get me.

[03:46] They even have my cell phone.

[03:48] They can text me.

[03:49] All right.

[03:50] Let's go down the list of what's happening with manufacturers right now in the Pinball

[03:54] hobby.

[03:55] So here's Stern Pinball.

[03:57] They are selling Iron Maiden's left and right.

[04:02] Iron Maiden has been revealed now for feels like over a month.

[04:07] Right.

[04:08] Now, I know for a fact, this is 100% fact, that Iron Maiden Premium artwork has been approved

[04:15] for a while.

[04:17] All right.

[04:18] Not just like yesterday, not a week ago for a while.

[04:23] So it really begs the question, why is Stern waiting to reveal the Iron Maiden Premium

[04:30] artwork to people?

[04:31] They have never, never, ever, ever in the history of a new game release, made people wait

[04:39] this long to see one of the art packages on the game.

[04:44] And I think it's really weird, right?

[04:48] Because all it leads people to do is have to buy only knowing two out of the three options

[04:56] for Iron Maiden.

[04:57] And it's not really even an option for many people because the limited edition games

[05:02] have sold out.

[05:04] So if you want to buy an Iron Maiden right now, you have no idea when premiums are shipping,

[05:09] you have no idea what it looks like.

[05:11] If you want to buy an Ellie, you've got to pay more than sticker price for it.

[05:15] If you want to buy a pro, I think they're also delayed.

[05:19] But I think the real reason they're doing this, I think they're just trying to get the

[05:24] Ellie's out to all the Ellie buyers before showing the premium.

[05:28] I mean, that is the only thing I can think of.

[05:30] Why wouldn't they just show it?

[05:32] And I do feel like the Ellie buyers, while they're getting an amazing game, they were

[05:37] forced to buy this game without all the information, they probably would have wanted to know

[05:43] if they were making the right decision for them.

[05:47] Because we know that the Power Slave artwork, the Egyptian themed artwork on the premium,

[05:52] is going to be freaking awesome.

[05:54] We also know that the premium is going to have its exclusive topper that is going to

[05:58] be Egyptian Power Slave theme.

[06:01] So think about that for a minute.

[06:02] The topper for Iron Maiden that is going to go on to the premium is actually the exclusive

[06:08] one.

[06:09] I'm hearing that the topper that is going to go on the Ellie is the same topper that goes

[06:13] on the pro.

[06:15] So it sounds like the premium is getting some even special almost limited or exclusivity

[06:22] applied to it.

[06:24] I just hope we see it soon.

[06:25] I hope we see it soon.

[06:26] I don't like ever asking people to make a decision without knowing everything they need

[06:33] to know.

[06:34] Because I think in any business, when the early adopters get screwed, I always think that's

[06:39] just bad business practice.

[06:41] It happens all the time.

[06:42] It doesn't just happen in Pimball.

[06:43] It happens in so many other categories where they know there's a group of people that

[06:47] are just going to rush to buy.

[06:49] All right.

[06:50] So that being said, we are starting to see lots and lots of Ellie's find new homes.

[06:56] That is great to see.

[06:58] The game looks gorgeous.

[06:59] The game looks gorgeous.

[07:01] I normally can look at a game and say that I would change this.

[07:05] I would change that.

[07:06] There's really not much I would change in Iron Maiden.

[07:09] There really isn't.

[07:10] The only thing I wish they would have done is allowed zombie Yeti to create artwork that

[07:14] went around the armor.

[07:15] That's such a tiny, tiny, insignificant little nitpicking thing.

[07:19] I'm reading the pin-side thread and yeah, there are some people out there that are having

[07:24] tiny little issues with their games.

[07:26] But you know here's the thing.

[07:28] I think people forget the volume of pinball machines that Stern sends out to people.

[07:34] And we always sort of seem to have the same types of people seem to always have the issues

[07:38] with their games.

[07:39] I was reading that KPG.

[07:43] He was confused about how the mummy captive ball target worked and was the sensor working

[07:49] in this and that.

[07:50] And sometimes, sometimes, I really wish people would just frame their issues a little differently

[07:59] because instead of declaring that you have an issue, maybe just ask, is this normal first

[08:06] before you're like, my game is about working right?

[08:09] It's broken and people are like, actually, that's how it comes, my friend.

[08:13] But for the most part, I think people are enjoying their maidens and the quality issues

[08:18] at Stern, they're always going to have some problems because of the sheer volume of games

[08:23] they send out.

[08:24] So I don't think there's anything major wrong with the game.

[08:27] I think people are enjoying it.

[08:29] What else is going on at Stern pinball?

[08:30] So as you know, zombie Yeti did not come on the show.

[08:35] As I said, he was supposed to be a guest.

[08:37] I was talking to Jeremy about coming on and he said he would come on and then he just

[08:43] decided not to respond to any of my future Facebook messages.

[08:47] I heard from Zach at Stern pinball that nobody at Stern would be coming on the show.

[08:52] And I'm fine with that.

[08:53] Zombie Yeti is a great guy.

[08:55] Jeremy is a great guy.

[08:56] He went over to head to head pinball to do a little chat with Marty and Ryan, which

[09:02] if you guys are interested, you should definitely check that out.

[09:06] I do wish he would have just like corresponded with me.

[09:10] That's the one thing about pinball people, man.

[09:12] Everyone on some level like that that are like entrenched in pinball, they get shady and

[09:17] flaky at times.

[09:18] And I just don't understand why.

[09:20] Like Jeremy, we're friends.

[09:22] I get it.

[09:23] I get why Stern is going to blacklist me.

[09:26] We are the most controversial pinball podcast out there.

[09:30] But at least just hit me up like man to man and be like, hey man, I can't do the show.

[09:34] That would be nice.

[09:35] I, you know, no one likes to be ignored, especially when they've already had some prior commitment

[09:41] made.

[09:42] And that's all I ask.

[09:43] And that's it.

[09:44] I still think you're one of the most talented and incredible artists and I look forward

[09:48] to your artwork on Deadpool, which I have seen and it is freaking amazing.

[09:52] You guys are going to love Deadpool designed by George Gomez coming out in summer of 2018,

[09:57] which Stern would not like you to know.

[10:00] What else would Stern not like you to know in this little bit of a rumor mill from

[10:03] Canadian pinball podcast?

[10:05] You know, now that Stern has basically come out and said nothing for you, Chris, we're

[10:11] not going to give you anything.

[10:12] It's not the right time.

[10:14] So here's what I'm going to do.

[10:15] Because Stern said to me, it's not the right time.

[10:18] We'll let you know when it's the right time.

[10:20] Let me, should I reveal stuff that's just not the right time?

[10:24] Should I, should I do the complete opposite of what Stern is doing to me?

[10:27] I don't think there's much I can tell you guys that you don't already know.

[10:32] But I will pull something out of my little Canadian rumor hat.

[10:36] All right, let's see, Monsters, which is not even like a rumor anymore.

[10:40] It is actually happening this October, November.

[10:44] I know that Monsters is being designed by John Borg.

[10:48] And I know John Borg is saying that this is his greatest design yet that he's putting

[10:53] as much as he can into this game.

[10:55] You know what that means?

[10:56] That Monsters is probably a re-skin of Metallica.

[10:58] No, we're just kidding.

[11:00] But I also know that they would like to put even more in the game.

[11:05] And they would like to release a possible Monsters super limited edition.

[11:12] But to do that, they have to get permission from Mr. Gary Stern.

[11:15] Now I hear Gary, he's all about the bottom line.

[11:18] Like when stuff gets yanked out of a game, it is Mr. Gary Stern, who is keeping that

[11:24] ship afloat.

[11:25] And look, here's the thing though, you'll never know.

[11:28] You'll never know if they got what they wanted in or if stuff was taken out because Stern

[11:33] is smart.

[11:34] They give you a game that you can decide to either buy or pass on, but they don't let

[11:40] you in on the development process and the prototype versions of the games.

[11:44] And you don't feel like stuff was yanked out.

[11:47] I will say this.

[11:49] I know this perturbs them that I talk about some of these future titles.

[11:52] I think they should just relax because everyone who listens to this podcast is addicted

[11:56] to Pimble.

[11:57] They are going to buy your machine, Stern, whether or not like I reveal photos of it, whether

[12:02] or not I don't talk about it, that you have these people.

[12:06] They are like addicted to the drug that I talk about.

[12:09] But here's the good news for you, Stern.

[12:11] You're the drug dealers.

[12:13] The drug dealers make the money.

[12:16] The guys who just do podcasts about the drugs, but don't manufacture the drugs.

[12:20] They get jack shit.

[12:22] I got zero money.

[12:24] If I could put Pimble in a dime bag and sell it on the corner, I would, to these guys,

[12:29] at the different shows and expos.

[12:32] What else is going on in the Pimble world?

[12:35] If you guys have an iron maiden, I would check out Miesel Mods.

[12:39] They have some really cool stuff going on.

[12:41] They're working on a lot of the lighting features of the game.

[12:44] They have a play field.

[12:45] They have a plastic protector for the center ramp shot.

[12:48] It's always fun.

[12:49] I think Maden is one of these games where a lot of awesome mods are going to be made for

[12:53] Iron Maiden.

[12:54] If you have a maiden, check out what they're doing over there.

[12:57] I wonder if our friends, Yilo Bird, who made all those amazing mods for Batman 66, if

[13:03] he is going to approach making mods for Iron Maiden, I would love to see what he comes

[13:09] up with.

[13:10] Would love it.

[13:11] I mean, the guys work has just transformed everyone's Batman game.

[13:14] Speaking of Batman, there hasn't been a code update for an entire month, which has

[13:19] people wondering when.

[13:21] When I say people, probably 20 people.

[13:25] Here's a thing about Batman 66.

[13:27] The game feels finished.

[13:28] The game feels finished as it is.

[13:30] There are a few things missing, and I want to talk about what those things are.

[13:34] For the SLE owners, the thing that is missing is your personal call out.

[13:39] I still think it's laughable that this is not in the game.

[13:43] This is the final cherry on top of the Sunday that Stern is going to give the 80 people

[13:48] who spend $15,000 on a pinball machine.

[13:53] When I talk to Lyman at TPS, he made it sound like it's kind of difficult because they're

[13:59] going to have to send out 80 different update files to each owner corresponding with their

[14:06] name.

[14:07] You know what?

[14:08] Lyman, here's the deal.

[14:10] Everyone in Stern, listen to me right now.

[14:12] These people spend $15,000 on those machines.

[14:16] I get it's a little bit more work, but do the work.

[14:20] You promise them this.

[14:21] Here's the sad part.

[14:23] Is Adam West recorded not only those personalized call outs for these buyers before he died.

[14:30] He also recorded an awesome voice message recording for these people to put on their phones.

[14:37] When people call, it's like Chris is busy.

[14:39] He's answering the bad phone.

[14:41] He's always out fighting crime or playing pinball, whatever it was.

[14:45] They haven't given that to the owners yet.

[14:49] I think it's time that the SLE owners are made whole with what they were promised.

[14:54] The other thing, major thing missing, are the minor villains.

[14:58] The minor villains right now, there's only one minor villain for season three.

[15:03] There's grayed out areas for the other villains that will be selectable eventually.

[15:10] After that, the only other things I think people want to see, I think they want to see

[15:14] the crane implement it much more.

[15:16] It's this awesome mech that is hardly used.

[15:19] I also think they would like to see the villain vision have some more functionality that the

[15:25] villains will actually taught you on the little TV screen.

[15:28] And finally, just more penguin cracking.

[15:32] People want penguin cracking Brenda.

[15:33] You're telling me to rush it.

[15:34] It's 812.

[15:36] You said you were leaving it 845.

[15:38] 815.

[15:39] 815.

[15:40] 3 minutes.

[15:41] You said a quarter.

[15:42] I know my father begins it.

[15:43] I'm not going to have a Peter processor.

[15:46] Can I bring this computer to you?

[15:48] No.

[15:49] I'm doing it Google 5.

[15:51] I need a computer.

[15:52] All right.

[15:53] You can give me five minutes.

[15:54] Is that fine?

[15:55] Five minutes.

[15:56] We're going to end this thing quickly then.

[15:57] Sorry Brenda.

[15:58] All right.

[15:59] Let me just do a quick update.

[16:01] All right.

[16:02] So unexpected.

[16:03] Unexpected.

[16:04] See, life happens.

[16:05] I'm going to go quickly here.

[16:06] These are someasonic attention.

[16:09] Looking at how hard to find that squared,

[16:17] There are 20,000 followers coming back to get on screen.

[16:25] Once you stick.

[16:26] Last thing you know,

[16:29] 9,000.

[16:30] Now 10,000,000.

[16:33] They can't get to the kind of reveal release schedule that Stern can get to.

[16:40] And it's not even about number of games.

[16:41] It's just simply about he was pired to the Caribbean, pired to the Caribbean, is going to

[16:45] ship in like a few weeks.

[16:48] That is what they need to get to, right?

[16:50] And more titles isn't really the answer.

[16:52] It's more about one thing.

[16:54] See, Jersey Jack will never compete with Stern on volume and cadence.

[16:59] What Jersey Jack needs is one thing and one thing only.

[17:02] They need to make every game a hit.

[17:05] They need to make every game so good that people say I need to have this game.

[17:11] I only live once.

[17:12] I need to go in on this game.

[17:13] I don't care what it costs on buying this game.

[17:16] And we know that through all of his titles, Jersey Jack has failed to accomplish that

[17:22] simple feat.

[17:23] He hasn't made a game that people just want so badly.

[17:28] We've never seen a Jersey Jack game sell for more than it was before it even was released.

[17:32] Look at, I just sold Iron Maiden, a $9,000 game for $12,000.

[17:39] And look at it.

[17:40] And Jack puts so much more in new games and he can't create the same sort of frenzy.

[17:45] And again, like I hope he gets there.

[17:48] We just haven't seen it yet.

[17:49] All right, I'm going to go quickly.

[17:50] Highway Pimball.

[17:52] Let's see.

[17:53] Playboy Pimball by Barrio.

[17:54] There's a Playboy video that Barrio designed.

[17:56] It's absolutely embarrassing.

[17:58] It's a terrible design.

[17:59] It's a creepy game.

[18:00] Just something about this girl pushing her cleavage together knowing that Barrio is standing

[18:05] over that machine that just creeps me the fuck out.

[18:08] I think people need to stop thinking Barrio is the greatest designer ever because all

[18:12] the designs I'm seeing that he did at Highway, nothing special.

[18:16] I think he's a Pimball designer from like, yesterday years.

[18:19] I'm not sure he can make a modern grade pen.

[18:22] It also just shows that the final nail was in the coffin for Andrew Highway.

[18:25] That was never going to work.

[18:26] All right.

[18:27] I'm going quickly because Brenna's got to take the computer.

[18:30] Let's see.

[18:31] A group of people are trying to fix alien Pimball machines.

[18:33] Those group of people will fail horribly at it.

[18:36] All right.

[18:37] Spooky Pimball.

[18:38] Rob Zombies.

[18:39] They're not even selling for $4,500 now.

[18:42] Think about that.

[18:43] The game is now lost like $1,500 in value.

[18:47] And there's only 300 of them.

[18:49] I just think this is indicative of if you don't build a good game in this climate, it doesn't

[18:54] matter if you're spooky, doesn't matter if you're like a nice guy, doesn't matter if

[18:57] you have a family.

[18:58] It doesn't matter.

[18:59] You're just trying to keep Pimball alive.

[19:02] Your games are going to go down in value and people are going to be hesitant about going

[19:07] in on the new ones.

[19:08] All right.

[19:09] Chicago Gaming Company.

[19:10] They're not going to make it to the Northwest show with their new title.

[19:13] People owners are like saying, can they just let us know what the title is?

[19:17] You know, look.

[19:18] I read some guys.

[19:19] His name was, let's see.

[19:21] Roger Dodger.

[19:23] He says, I'm in the market for a new and box Pimball machine.

[19:27] However, my hands are tied with making a decision as I don't know what the next CGC remake

[19:32] will be.

[19:33] You know, it's like these people that complain because they don't know they're like complaining

[19:39] about it.

[19:40] Like your hands are tied because you can't buy your $8,000 Pimball machine when you'd

[19:46] like to, you have to wait.

[19:48] You know, these guys like have Pimball machines.

[19:50] You know, here's the thing.

[19:51] Turn off the forums.

[19:53] Stop like waiting for it.

[19:55] And just go enjoy the games you have.

[19:57] And when they announce it, they'll announce it.

[19:59] They're not going to like do it.

[20:00] Just do a piece you.

[20:01] It is kind of funny that they just want to reveal it considering we already know what

[20:05] the game is because they're all remakes like nothing that happens on the game is going

[20:08] to be innovative or like, you know, new to us.

[20:13] It's going to be all in the display of what they do to these games in the top or which

[20:17] is not going to change gameplay at all.

[20:19] All right.

[20:20] Let me just sign off real quick.

[20:21] Brennan, give me one minute.

[20:22] I'm going to say this.

[20:23] There's a PIN side definitive Pimball podcast list.

[20:27] And on it, there's like, it looks like there's over 20 Pimball podcasts that are listed on

[20:33] there is the definitive Pimball podcast.

[20:36] And there is not one mention of Canadian Pimball podcast.

[20:40] Now if you don't think that this is totally indicative of the ridiculousness of PIN side

[20:45] and the moderators, pretending that the Twippy award winning Pimball podcast, the only one

[20:51] that's transparent with my listeners, you know, pretending I don't exist is like taking

[20:57] it's like saying that North Korea shouldn't be on the map.

[21:01] Like we're just going to remove it from every map that's out there.

[21:04] And I just think it's embarrassing.

[21:06] I think you guys who listen should like hit up your moderators and just feel the fact

[21:10] that you can't even list me on there.

[21:13] Like I'm banned from the site guys.

[21:15] I can't cause any problems.

[21:16] I'm banned.

[21:18] Just listing me on that site creates such an issue for Robin and force flow.

[21:24] And I love to that people are saying that I use bots to get my listener base up.

[21:28] That is such bullshit.

[21:30] I get 1500 on average dedicated listeners to this show.

[21:35] I thank all you guys for listening.

[21:37] And I just want to say, I know you're not a bot.

[21:40] I don't use bots.

[21:41] I think people just need to swallow that red pill and enter the real world.

[21:47] Your Canadian pinball podcast is probably the most frequently listened to pinball podcast

[21:53] out there because we're doing something right because we're adding value because you

[21:58] enjoy it.

[21:59] It's entertaining.

[22:00] I mean, don't even get me started on some of these new pinball podcasts out there like

[22:04] the meltdown pinball podcast.

[22:06] It's like, it's like, come on.

[22:08] Like you don't they don't want me.

[22:10] Some of these new pinball podcasts don't want me to actually listen to their shows and

[22:15] review them.

[22:16] I don't need to because you'll listen to them and you'll see some of the garbage that

[22:20] is being put up on the airwaves now, boring, drunken, rambling garbage that is going up.

[22:27] This is the new thing now.

[22:28] This is the new trend.

[22:29] Everyone who has a thought about pinball wants to put on a mic and have a pinball podcast.

[22:33] And I highly welcome it.

[22:34] Step into my dojo, motherfuckers.

[22:37] This is the coberkai of Brendan, you're turning on the water.

[22:39] I'm about to finish.

[22:41] This is the coberkai of pinball podcast.

[22:43] We do.

[22:45] We do this to entertain and educate you, but we will kick the ass out of all the little

[22:51] pinball podcasts that don't have their shit together and have no skills to put on the

[22:55] mic.

[22:56] All right.

[22:57] Fear does not exist on this podcast.

[23:00] You know, no mercy.

[23:02] Everyone, have a good day.

[23:03] I gotta go.

[23:04] Brendan's gotta take the computer.

[23:05] I'm gonna just upload this real quick.

[23:06] You're under the gun.

[23:07] Oh, so you're taking it on the wall.

[23:09] Who did from a friend?

[23:16] Who?

[23:17] Who did from a friend?

[23:18] Who?

[23:19] Who did from another you've been messing around?
