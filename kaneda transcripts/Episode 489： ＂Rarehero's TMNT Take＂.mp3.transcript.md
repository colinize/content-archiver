[00:00] Go into go into go go go into go go go go go go go lyrics

[00:06] Fill in the gap drop that bass and get the ninja rat

[00:16] All right, so we got a stream of ninja turtles yesterday from Stern in company Jack Danger and the entire Stern team

[00:24] joined us for an hour to reveal the game and I'm gonna talk to a ninja turtles fanatic about this game

[00:31] Mr. Greg Colton rare hero on Pinside and he's gonna join the show and we're gonna go over

[00:36] What we saw during that hour stream and what we think about the game and some things going on in the pinball industry

[00:43] My thoughts on it just to summarize it. I'll say this. I think the game really does a good job in capturing the ninja turtles

[00:50] But I will say this as I saw it. I have to admit ninja turtles isn't really a theme that I brought with me from my adolescence into adulthood

[01:00] It's just not that kind of thing. I mean even when I go back and watch the 1980s cartoon clips

[01:06] I haven't really watched those clips in like 20 30 years

[01:09] I don't remember what the original voices sound it like I don't remember the story lines from the show

[01:15] I it just it just hasn't been something that I brought with me the way I brought with me back to the future or top gun or

[01:22] Karate kid you see what I'm saying I don't feel like most grown adults and most grown men have really thought a lot about

[01:30] Ninja turtles over the years now some have and some are die hards and some of you out there when you were kids

[01:36] You met the Ninja Turtles at the imparks and it drove you crazy

[01:39] So this game might be for you. It's just not for me

[01:43] I mean if I had to choose between Rick and Morty guns and roses and ninja turtles

[01:47] Ninja turtles is at the bottom of that list and guns and roses is at the top of that list Rick and Morty

[01:52] Obviously, I'd like the adult humor in that game over the Ninja Turtles campiness

[01:56] But it's there the campy stuff you love about Ninja Turtles is there

[02:00] I will say this before I air the interview with Greg stern needs to get better at these streams

[02:06] And it's not Jack dangerous fault

[02:08] But there was just something about the volume levels were crappy

[02:12] Dwight kept talking he would and stopped talking and I just think the first way to show a pinball machine for the first time ever

[02:20] It's so stupid to just like hold the ball and and take the glass off and throw it around the switches and and reveal all of what's in the game

[02:28] Just play the game. Why is who do who does this with the video game like oh no go go to level three

[02:34] No go to live too. Oh go to level one like just play the game and let people see what you put into it

[02:39] And when they finally just shut up and play the game it was enjoyable to watch

[02:44] But before that it was just oh it was excruciating just hearing like the non-stop talking like just show the game

[02:53] Show the audio of the game let people hear it let people absorb your hard work Dwight learn to just maybe let the game do the talking

[03:01] Okay, all right. So here's mr. Greg Colton rare hero talking to me about Ninja Turtles and other stuff

[03:07] All right back by popular demand ladies and gentlemen the biggest Ninja Turtle fan has decided to join his arch nemesis

[03:14] Canada mr. Greg Colton rare hero Greg welcome to the show. What's up? Are you are you the shredder to my

[03:21] My Michael and I guess I am the the Steve Richie voiced shredder to your Tim sexton voice Raphael no

[03:29] Greg I wanted to have you on because you're a huge Ninja Turtles fan and we both watched the stream tonight correct right?

[03:37] Okay, so let's talk about it like first just give me your overall feelings on the game to date sure

[03:43] I mean, I've got you know my pro column and my con column

[03:47] But you know like you said I'm a huge Ninja Turtle fan from back when I was just massively massively obsessed with the show when I was a kid

[03:54] So it's just a huge part of mind-stalled of the music the voices everything is completely baked into my head permanently

[04:01] So you know I'm coming at it from that angle. Yeah, yeah, so you're you're a fan so I mean and we've been talking I mean

[04:08] Growing up loving the show the voices the actors the theme song all that matters to you right as as a diehard

[04:17] Yeah exactly and and I mean here's the thing I mean pretty much with any pinball machine that's licensed on something

[04:24] Nostalgic you want it to be true to the license right so and it's not a weird thing to expect for them to have

[04:32] You know the clips the voices things like that because it's been done in the past and it used to be kind of a prestige project for

[04:38] Pretty much any license to have their own pinball machine was like this little thing that was cool to have

[04:43] You know it's cool if you're show your movie has its own pinball machine, so you know you usually they could get you know

[04:48] Swartz now you're to do the Terminator games or

[04:51] With spider-man, you know they had JK Simmons

[04:54] Doing the custom call out so it just that used to be a thing that was common and expected and and as a

[05:01] You know someone who buys machines for a home collection

[05:05] It you know you're always talking about things that are special like to me

[05:08] It's special when they get someone really from the property to be involved and provide custom callouts and things like that

[05:16] So so same thing for turtles and especially it's not like these guys are Schwarzenegger

[05:20] These are our cartoon voice actors. They're all still alive. Yeah, and they've and they've all been out of work since 1988 right?

[05:27] No, they're still they're still working, but

[05:30] But I can't imagine they're massively massively expensive, but I mean maybe for Stern's budget they are

[05:35] I don't know, but yeah, honestly I would have preferred at least in the the audio realm for them to have used

[05:42] Show clips of the characters and maybe hire a few of the actors to do custom callouts

[05:47] You know even just from what I could hear in the stream when Dwight wasn't talking over everything

[05:52] There was a line directly for I just watched a bunch of the first episodes the other day and there was a line in the pinball machine directly from the show where

[05:58] Raphael says oh their the mutation didn't raise their IQ

[06:03] You know and just listening to it in the pinball machine

[06:05] It's it's not Rob Paulson with that sarcastic Raphael voice that I know you know

[06:10] It's it's not the nostalgia

[06:11] Minestology coming out of that pinball machine and we were talking earlier. It would be like

[06:16] Watching Optimus Prime talk to Megatron and it's not Peter Collins saying like one shall stand and one shall fall right?

[06:24] It's like it's like well, that's what happened in the in the Transformers pinball, which which I bought back back when it came out

[06:31] They had a fake Optimus Prime and it sucked right, you know for me it sucked some people don't care some people

[06:38] Either their ear doesn't register that difference or they don't

[06:41] Care about the property that much um, but you know just to say something

[06:46] To their credit even though they are they're using fake voices in this game

[06:50] It's clear their fans. It's clear. They're trying to be those voices and they're actually doing it for the most part a decent job

[06:58] I thought you know Prang shredder

[07:00] Most of them sounded pretty good as far you know, it's not like the Marvel games. Yeah, I mean

[07:05] I fucking hate the the boboly bobo and

[07:10] Yeah, the boboly bobo of boboly bobo that you know

[07:14] Tazzy crazy and and the uh, the you know like the X-Men voices

[07:18] The Marvel voices on the whole have all been terrible. So this is much better than that

[07:22] It's you know on one hand like I said, it's not my nostalgia

[07:25] But it's not offensive like right it gets you through the game, you know like you know who's talking?

[07:31] So let me ask you a question because I was watching this stream and I don't think I've ever seen a stream in which after an hour

[07:38] I was like did I even see anything other than joy

[07:42] Anxiously talking over the entire hour like what what yeah like why didn't they just play the game?

[07:49] I really wish they would just play the game the whole thing where it's like well if you do this and you do this and then

[07:53] You know take the ball by hand and put it into that thing

[07:57] Maybe people let that personally

[07:58] I'd rather them just play the game let's see organically how this game develops

[08:03] There was a point where he was asking Jack danger to grab the ball to do something and they're like dude the glasses on the game

[08:09] And he's playing the game like just shut up and let it play the game

[08:13] So it was a little bit of a weird stream. It was the first ever

[08:17] Covitt stream by Stern it was nice to see the entire design team

[08:22] On the stream we had everybody yeah, which was cool. Yeah, yeah, and I agree these guys are very passionate

[08:27] So great. Let me ask you so it's interesting because this is based on the 1980s cartoon

[08:33] But there are no clips from the 19 years cartoon. So how do you feel about that?

[08:38] So I kind of have a theory or a few theories about why they create these new

[08:44] CG animation sequences and instead of using the clips personally

[08:48] I would have loved to just seen the clips in there because to me that's the show

[08:51] You know kind of like Batman 66 puts the clips up on the on the screen

[08:55] You know, and I could be totally off base with my theory about why they don't use the clips in the case of Batman

[09:00] They have a really nice remastered, you know high-deaf film assets they can use the turtles didn't really age well in terms of the footage

[09:09] It's it's like the best they've got is like VHS

[09:12] Level masters. So my my thinking is maybe they they see that footage think it looks too old for a new game and by

[09:19] Making this new CG artwork that makes it look more

[09:22] Current and modern and then they have this crew of animators there that need to work

[09:26] So that's probably part of it too. They're like well if we just use clips the new guys I'm not gonna do

[09:30] Which would you rather have that but choosing between the CGI and even like a somewhat you know

[09:35] VHS-looking clip would you still rather have the original honestly? I'd rather than do something more like

[09:41] An after effects or a flash thing where they're using maybe zombie eddies artwork and manipulating that on the screen

[09:48] You know having you know a turtle but just like a drawing you know kind of flying with some effect and so because

[09:54] Let's be honest that the animation they're doing for for the screen. It just looks

[09:59] Dated it yeah, like I hate to be mean about it. I mean I feel like I'm Greg for those who don't know you're an animator working on the family guy show

[10:06] So you this is your this is your career. So you see this yeah, I look at things frame by frame like that's how my eye function

[10:13] That's how my brain functions with animation

[10:15] It also is kind of comical when people see stern animation. You're like these are incredible

[10:19] I'm like, okay, have you not played a video game in 20 years guys?

[10:23] It kind of looks like to me like a ps1 and 64

[10:29] Level character model that's been up-res but but you see they put these

[10:34] I don't know if you if you were like watching some of the footage of the the screen

[10:37] But like there'll be these scenes where like the turtles are just kind of moving up and down on one side

[10:41] The foot soldiers are just moving up and down on the other side and to me it just looks like a video game where someone put the controller down

[10:47] Like you know and the screen is basically waiting for you to hit something. So so the characters

[10:52] react to the squish and stuff like that dead Deadpool's like that where the

[10:56] The bad guys are coming at Deadpool and they're just like it's like

[11:00] They're like six inches from them and they they're not throwing a punch until something happens in the game

[11:04] Yeah, it's sort of that weird thing where you know, and this is sort of like they're still trying to figure out that transition from DMD to

[11:11] LCD you know on a DMD when you know quote-unquote nothing is happening

[11:15] You just see the score and then you hit something and then the animation would happen

[11:18] So they're trying to do this thing where you always see something is on the screen like ready to happen

[11:23] What's always weird to me is when they have an animation that keeps looping. I'll give you an example

[11:28] There's like some score you get where like the turtle van like comes down the street and sort of like slides around the corner

[11:35] Yeah, and then like it just does it immediately again

[11:38] And you're like wait it like we just came down this street. We just made that turn

[11:43] Why we do it in exactly the same way again every time you hit the swit like it just it just doesn't I don't know it feels weird

[11:50] Right, it's like it's like a skipping record. Well, that's well, that's kind of that's kind of a DMD theory in a way too

[11:55] You know on a lot of DMD games you hit the shot and there's like a little clip that plays but you know because usually it was

[12:01] As quicker and it was dots and a little simpler like it didn't quite strike you as being as repetitive right

[12:08] As like in yeah in this case, it's like there's a little rat in the front of the screen and the van's coming towards him

[12:13] Or runs away and that that just keeps happening every time right so let me ask you Greg because I'm just curious to this game's very colorful

[12:20] There's a lot in it. There's a lot of animations going on

[12:23] I walked away from the stream. I don't feel like I got as much of a connection to this game as other streams

[12:30] And maybe just because they were trying to do a lot with a lot of people talking and I

[12:34] How did you feel do you feel like you clicked with you after seeing the stream?

[12:39] I mean, I'm sort of half and half. I really I want to see more gameplay

[12:42] I really want to see just sort of organically like people hitting the shots how things happen if there's sort of a

[12:48] satisfying feeling from hitting a bunch of shots and making a mode start or

[12:53] Starting a multi-ball and getting jackpots and whatnot like you know

[12:57] I mean, it's it's really hard to tell that stuff until you really play it

[12:59] But I feel like you can kind of tell it from a stream. I'm not gonna run out in order one

[13:03] Let's put it that way

[13:04] But I could still see myself possibly in the future

[13:08] Wanting to get it like I don't want to write it off because you know like I sort of wrote off Jurassic Park

[13:14] Because it's like I was I was so so on the art

[13:17] I didn't like that they weren't using the movie assets. I thought the voices were terrible

[13:21] And that was just from seeing stuff online and then I played it at a friend's house and in person it blew me away

[13:26] It's an incredible experience. It's super fun. It felt great

[13:30] So like I don't want to write this game off. I mean, I like I like board designs a lot that they always shoot great

[13:35] They're always fun and and from what I could tell so far

[13:39] The rules don't have that like stuff that I usually don't like lately about the white's rules

[13:43] It kind of looks like he's making a game that that I could like you know

[13:47] Yeah, it was funny because like I agree like I'm like man, Dwight like it's not annoying

[13:51] Unfortunately, you're annoying us, but not shutting up about it. Just like let us watch this rule set

[13:57] Unfold it was also kind of weird the way after an hour like Jack danger clearly has the game

[14:04] And Jack they didn't just let Jack do his thing. It was kind of strange. They pulled the plug on the stream

[14:09] It was like that's it kids like

[14:12] Gord or Eurelie now and we'll see you in two days with the pro

[14:16] So I agree. I think we all need to see a little bit more and Greg

[14:20] If you're not chasing after Nellie. I mean you're in a great position to just you know see how this game goes

[14:25] I mean they're gonna be making premiums of this game for three four years

[14:28] Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't really jump on Ellie's and the last Ellie I bought was Star Trek Ellie and

[14:34] And that's sort of when I stop buying new pins anyway, so

[14:38] Yeah, I'm fine waiting like I'm not an Ellie person

[14:41] I'm you know to me the premiums the same exact thing

[14:43] So if if I do want a game if I end up wanting it

[14:46] I'm more than happy to just get a premium or or not whatever you know new used and I'm not in a rush

[14:51] but

[14:52] I sort of feel like had I watched this

[14:55] Stream and I think if it had you know for me and again just being a huge fan for when I was a kid

[15:00] If it had the real voices if it had the real clips

[15:03] I think I would be calling my distributor right now and being like fuck it. I want it

[15:07] Yeah, I kind of agree like I love Transformers. I love he man. I love GI Joe

[15:12] If this was the we were talking about this earlier

[15:15] It always feels like stern games of late

[15:18] There's sort of interpretations of the thing you love. They're not direct porting the thing you love into the game anymore

[15:26] And some people seem to like that you know they like that it's it's own thing

[15:30] I think was it elwin or someone said something about some games being like like the pinball machine is a DVD clip player

[15:36] You know and then some people don't actually don't like that when it's too literal to the source material

[15:43] That's a that's a cop out that that's I mean who doesn't want to watch movie scenes they love over and over again or like cartoon clips over

[15:50] I don't buy that that like if you use the willy-wonker clips. It's gonna get boring and repetitive

[15:55] No, I mean I think it just depends on the game. I mean like I said with Jurassic Park

[15:59] It it turned me off at first and then I saw creatively

[16:03] Why they did it right and it worked and like I respected decision

[16:08] They made because it made for a really good game right you know whether that's the case on turtles

[16:13] I don't know because it does look like they're using plot lines

[16:17] lines of dialogue and stuff that they could have just cribbed from the clips right and so I

[16:23] That maybe there were you know, like I said, maybe my theory about being too old and then want it and then wanting it to feel fresh

[16:29] That could be a possibility or maybe there was some weird licensing thing where they couldn't use the footage

[16:34] I really don't know

[16:35] As a marketer by trade I'd never mentioned that on the show by the way

[16:39] I mean I mean client to believe Nickelodeon would want them not to go back a lot of these companies like they've got the

[16:46] Current version of turtles and they don't like to rehash the past as much as possible

[16:51] Well, but in this case it is the old version and Nickelodeon is absolutely cool with

[16:58] Licensing the old nostalgia turtles, you know the that arcade one-up company made a bunch of turtles our kids

[17:04] And it's the classic 90's Kenami games and you know, they didn't update the graphics to be the new version

[17:10] So they're you know, they're you can still buy like t-shirts and merch and all sorts of stuff just because nostalgia sells

[17:15] I mean that's part of why Nickelodeon bought turtles not just to have a new version of it

[17:18] But to have like the entire catalog of turtles that people have nostalgia for to sell product

[17:24] What about the game mechanically anything how how did you feel about the toys the flow the the gameplay itself?

[17:30] I mean it looked pretty good. I mean, you know, Borg tends to sort of have a sort of a wheelhouse and like it looks a little bit

[17:37] Tron which is cool because I like Tron it looks a little bit like like the ramps coming back remind me of

[17:43] Apollo 13 that kind of had a split ramp coming back

[17:46] But in this in this game, it's got the little controllable

[17:49] Diverter which is cool. Yeah, I don't like in my mind of course, you know

[17:52] We we always designed the game in our mind before we see it right so like in my mind

[17:55] I was thinking like oh how cool would it be if one of the subterranean drills would come up from the playfield and open up

[18:00] And you know the balls would spill out for multi-ball something along those lines or you know, they won't really have you on the the mouseers

[18:07] You know, I was thinking it could be cool if they had um, you know like a tack from ours if the Martian is bouncing up and down if they had

[18:13] Mousers are all around with their their jaws are chomping and you yet to you know shoot targets to destroy the mouse

[18:18] So I you know in my mind it's like okay, they could have done this they could have done that

[18:21] But you know the game they come up with I mean it's it's legit to the light you know sometimes toys don't feel like they make sense for the license

[18:28] I mean, I don't know just we were talking about transformers. It's like why am I hitting Optimus Prime? He's the hero right

[18:33] So in this case all the toys make sense for the theme the balls come out of the turtle van

[18:38] It's four balls. It's like four turtles coming out of the turtle van, you know the glider. That's part of the turtle

[18:43] Yeah, uh pizza pizza's pizza and

[18:46] Crang is in there. I mean he doesn't do much, but he's he's cranked

[18:49] Yeah, it's kind you know when I was watching it

[18:51] It's you know, it's like a some of the parts kind of game for me

[18:53] There's not like a singular thing in it. That's kind of like a wow or like an innovative thing that I was like wow

[18:58] How'd they how they engineer that I was laughing when I was watching this stream though because for some reason in pinball Greg like people get

[19:06] Impressed when you just throw a lot of balls into a multi-ball like for some reason people were really impressed

[19:11] There were seven balls and play it once and I'm like why is this impressive like it's so easy just to code that are you impressed?

[19:18] Are you impressed by a lot of balls going around at once? I mean I used to know I used to own a

[19:23] Apollo 13 and that had a 13 ball multi-ball so it's like once you've done that it's like

[19:27] To prepare you know where to go. I'm gonna make a Apollo 14 from American pinball. I just like take a no

[19:33] Okay, so let me ask you a question. So

[19:36] I know you're in the market possibly for this game. You're also a big fan of Rick and Morty to animated

[19:44] Franchise is brought to market at the same time. Yeah

[19:47] What are your thoughts like which one do you think is integrating the theme better?

[19:51] Which one do you think I mean they're completely different approaches?

[19:55] Right, but I mean can you imagine if it makes you wonder if Stern had done Rick and Morty would you see

[20:00] Clips from the show or would you see their own like CG Rick and Morty's floating around the display?

[20:06] Right

[20:08] It makes you wonder but yeah, I have a Rick and Morty on order and you know

[20:12] I haven't played it yet. So I'm gonna be pretty much getting it blind

[20:15] But I mean I'm a huge fan of

[20:17] Scott and TNA

[20:19] You know, I used to buy a lot of new games and I really don't anymore, but TNA is like the one

[20:24] I guess modern game that I have right now and and I love it

[20:28] So you know, I know you know people have debated the game plan Rick and Morty whether it's you know smooth or clunky or whatever

[20:34] But I don't know I trust in Scott's instincts when it comes to game design

[20:38] So I'm still really excited to get it and yeah the integration is incredible

[20:41] I mean even if it's not the greatest smoothest game or what have you

[20:46] I think it's gonna be so much fun fun to explore fun to play fun to play with friends fun to watch my my

[20:52] daughter call people a piece of shit after watching the play. Yeah

[20:56] Well and and Rick and Morty I would I'm just gonna go out on limb and say the majority of people were buying this game from spooky pinball

[21:03] We're not

[21:04] Rick and Morty fans. I think most of them are Scott and easy fans and they

[21:09] Acquired the show after the fact and enjoyed it. I'm one of those people. I

[21:14] Yeah, I mean it could be a little both. I mean I was a fan of both

[21:17] So like everything came together for me. How do you think this thing is gonna sell for Stern?

[21:22] I mean there's a lot of debate and this is all just speculation

[21:24] They'll never give us numbers

[21:25] But do you think this is gonna be a home run? Do you think it's gonna be middle the road? What are your thoughts?

[21:31] I mean considering the situation we're in with with COVID it's it's hard to say

[21:36] I mean, I'm sure you've heard the same things I've heard that like games are still selling really well to

[21:40] Homebuyers right now

[21:42] Unfortunately, I don't think they're gonna

[21:44] Do as well with operators right now and I think this game would actually do really really well in locations

[21:50] I think anything nostalgic does well in location plus Ninja Turtles has a history with the arcade people love the four player

[21:56] Ninja Turtle arcade

[21:57] So I think that would also translate to people wanting to play the pinball machine as for homebuyers

[22:02] I mean

[22:03] I don't it's again, it's hard to say I think

[22:06] You know, I was telling you the other day. There's like a very specific age split with this game

[22:09] I think if you're like our age like 43 or younger maybe you know

[22:13] I'm a few little old to have been obsessed with Ninja Turtles. So you know, let's say like 41 and younger

[22:19] You're gonna get this theme if you're like

[22:21] 45 and older you're like you miss the phenomenon and you're not gonna get it

[22:25] So those people aren't gonna buy on theme but people who are you know, let's say 41 42 or younger

[22:30] Especially maybe if they have have kids it's like they haven't installed it for it kids like Ninja Turtles

[22:36] It's it's a good family game. So if people want to buy a game for their

[22:40] Family game room. I mean it could connect with people

[22:43] You know, I interesting because I I went in on a few L.E.s

[22:47] Selfishly to flip them to flip them. I'm not like I have three on order

[22:52] Uh, and I did I did you know I did get a text tonight from coin taker saying

[22:57] Uh, we uh, we gotta give up your L.E. Because Chris and Melissa know me by now and they're like dude

[23:02] You always make a reservation at a restaurant you never come eat here

[23:05] Uh, so

[23:07] Apparently it is selling pretty well if if they are asking for my spot. It means they have a lot of demand for the game

[23:14] We will see there's always there always that one day spike, you know

[23:17] There's that one day spike where there's the FOMO is at the highest because

[23:22] You get the verbiage from Stern. I love how Jared posted. I feel privileged to be one of only 500 people out there to spend

[23:29] $9,000 even though he called it like in a leased club or something. Yeah, and we all know that he's probably only spending like 3500 on his

[23:37] At cost price from Stern. Uh-oh, Jared. I just said that but you know what I mean he's not spending nine grand

[23:44] But you know look I think if you love this theme

[23:48] You're gonna be happy with this game. I mean I didn't see anything in it that made me be like, you know

[23:52] I mean there was nothing to really worry about but to your point if you're

[23:57] Into the content from back in the day

[24:00] You're gonna have to compromise a little bit, but but so what you got a modern day into Turtles game

[24:05] Which is kind of a modern miracle because

[24:07] They didn't need to remake this theme there is already a game out there exactly

[24:12] But this is I mean clearly already a billion times better than the old one and yeah, you know

[24:16] There's the things we expect so yeah when I see

[24:20] Their animation and I'm like oh man. I just wish it was the show. It's like okay

[24:24] I feel like me

[24:25] Even I can get over that in the sense that you know when you're playing the game the display is a display

[24:31] You know, it's not like you're watching on an 80 inch TV screen and then the display is the you know you're looking at the game

[24:39] You know the game is the game

[24:41] The displays the display I

[24:43] I can deal with some janky animation on the display if the game is super fun

[24:47] And I'm into it and uh and yeah, well like I said we'll see I think there's enough good stuff

[24:52] And I think it looks like it plays great the rules actually look really interesting

[24:55] It looks like they you know they have enough

[24:58] Sort of simplicity to under you know like just modes and

[25:01] multi-balls and stuff like that and and then some of the nuance like the you know picking your character and that those different things

[25:06] So yeah, it kind of looks like it has something for for everyone and it looks like the type of game you can kind of learn over time and

[25:11] Learn some of the nuance so the music's in craft. I forgot if I'd mention that the I thought the music was incredible

[25:17] right Jerry Thompson's music is uh

[25:19] Awesome, so that's a plus you know and and as I was watching them explain the co-op play in this game

[25:27] I was like this game was designed for the internet. I mean they clearly oh we got to get into the internet

[25:32] Well, no, I mean, and we're gonna talk about it like clearly they designed this game to connect people's Ninja Turtle machines

[25:37] And I know it's coming. It's just been delayed, but come on Greg you know these modes are meant for

[25:44] For buddies to be able to play remotely right, but you know and I've been said I've been yammering on pin sight about this like the whole

[25:52] We need internet pinball gameplay thing. I personally think is a bit misguided because it's one of those things

[25:58] You think oh this would be so cool, but if you really think about it in practice

[26:02] You know compared to a video game when you're playing an online video game

[26:04] You see everyone on screen together. You're all interacting in the same space. You're all synced up

[26:09] One-to-one if you're staring at a wood play field and you're quote-unquote playing with someone online

[26:16] Like what does that really do for you like you can't see what they're doing?

[26:19] You're doing your thing with your play field is it really?

[26:22] Is there a satisfaction to it? Is it really I sort of feel like if you had an online game in your house

[26:28] You try it like three times and be like oh this is

[26:31] Let me run a let me run a scenario by a minute like I get it

[26:35] But I think you could if you design the game from the ground up and I mean by the from the ground up

[26:42] To have that ability imagine this imagine I'm playing you and we're competing to hit

[26:47] Every shot in the game and there's like two lights

[26:51] There's a green light and there's a yellow light and they're they're all lit and when I hit my shot

[26:56] My lights go off on your machine so you know

[27:00] You know you're like racing against me to do something in a mode maybe and I think you could do it

[27:04] You would just have to design the games from the ground up with that in mind

[27:09] But would that be fun like you know

[27:12] There's pinball is such a tactile force feedback sort of the game like you hitting a thing on your thing when I'm not there to

[27:20] Witness it

[27:21] And the only thing that I see is like a light changing on mine. Is that really something?

[27:26] Doing is that doing it doing anything for me?

[27:28] Yeah, you just described the greatest pinball experience. No, I mean like

[27:32] With Jerry's p3 like I mean at least his is very physical with his heads up game

[27:37] He has on multi-morphic where there's those those actual drop targets going up and down

[27:41] If you have a machine and I have a machine you're you're physically controlling what's happening in my machine

[27:46] I mean, it's it's it's fun when you're at the show and you play it

[27:50] I don't know. I just think it it's something that nobody really knows I think in the realm of pinball look at the concept of

[27:57] Playing against each other online is it's just kind of a gimmick

[28:01] I don't see it really being a game changer. I don't see it selling more units

[28:05] You know and also I mean you got to think of the user base

[28:09] You know online games fortnight Mario Kart

[28:11] There's tens 20 hundred million people playing you know if how many people are gonna have you know

[28:17] Even if a string game sells sells well

[28:20] You know there might be a few thousand people who have this game and then how many of those are actually online and then how many of those are actually online

[28:26] At the same time I see it as a versus mode Greg that's just like an added bonus feature to game

[28:31] I don't see it ever becoming like the main purpose of a game

[28:36] To be a connected experience. So I just I just I think it's something as a bonus

[28:40] Yeah, like like I've got my Rick and Morty and I'm a little bit bored and you've got your Rick and Morty

[28:44] And you're a little bit bored and we want to go against each other and see who can you know and you could you could do a player first player mode

[28:51] Just just just for shits and giggles maybe I don't know but like yeah

[28:54] I just I just honestly I don't think it would be I really just don't think it would be that that's fun or satisfying

[28:59] I mean I'm not gonna argue against games having internet or Wi-Fi for other reasons

[29:05] I think having social media connectivity is see when when stern finally releases

[29:10] Internet in their games

[29:11] I think it's gonna be for social media connectivity

[29:15] So you can like find out where games are so you can maybe compare high scores on different games

[29:19] I think there's a lot of things you could do for operators and owners where you could

[29:24] You know change settings on the game from your phone like you wanted to change the pricing or if you wanted to change the difficulty or something

[29:31] There's a lot of cool things you could do with an online connected game

[29:34] I just think pinball is such a specific type of game that playing against each other quote unquote

[29:41] Online sort of isn't what it would excel at in the teaser video for Ninja Turtles

[29:47] Why was Zack Sharp so serious in it? Have you seen his face in that video? He looked like it this

[29:53] He claims his job serious. He was going to war against this machine. This was no

[29:57] This is no turtles against shredder eating pizza. This is this was serious business

[30:01] It's the stern at the stern army. They're going to war. Yes. Why do they

[30:07] Market these games and I know I talk about this lot, but but this is such a fun theme right and right

[30:14] There's so many fun and creative ways you could maybe introduce Ninja Turtles

[30:18] I'm just shocked that there's no

[30:20] Pizza integration with a national pizza chain and my idea was always to have a a button on the game

[30:27] And this is if you're internet connected that would actually order pizza to the location of of each machine

[30:33] Like that would be super simple and awesome. I don't know. I just feel like it's always

[30:37] You can't order a pizza on your phone like

[30:39] I mean like I just for for them to break people always talk about

[30:45] Expanding the reach of pinball right and I think Ninja Turtles is a mainstream theme

[30:49] That does get you beyond the typical pinhead audience. There's a lot more people in the Ninja Turtles that are into pinball

[30:56] And so I don't know. I just always feel like they sometimes stern

[31:00] Misses some opportunities to broaden and think

[31:03] Creatively outside of the pizza box and how they can launch these games like the today's launch feel

[31:09] Was there even like an IGN story today? I think I saw one on Kotaku

[31:13] I don't know who had the exclusive, you know, I get right

[31:16] I really don't know. I mean canada had the exclusive last night

[31:19] But like I don't know maybe maybe I'm overthinking it

[31:22] I just always feel like they could do more than just like this. Yeah, well those those videos are kind of a template all the other videos are kind of similar

[31:28] It's the dark room. It's I think it's usually exact playing

[31:33] Yes, he's taking it very seriously

[31:35] I mean that just might be from his mindset as a tournament player like

[31:39] That that's what pinball is me versus the machine. There's nothing else around just darkness

[31:43] It just looks like he's he's like playing the game with no pants on and that's why he's just like so worried

[31:48] They're gonna like pan below the way. No, all right. So let's talk about

[31:53] You're on pinside a lot

[31:55] Not that much anymore, but a couple thread you think I'm bitter that I'm not on

[32:01] Um, but let's talk about some of the other stuff happening. So do you think deep route will make it out in 2020?

[32:09] No

[32:10] Just just flat out now no, I just I just have I have no confidence or or care like even if they did

[32:15] I really don't give a fuck like the whole story behind

[32:18] That company with with Jay Popping involved with just the bravado the arrogance

[32:24] Never really proving they had any

[32:26] I mean, it's really the same thing that happened at Jay Pop. He had all these plans

[32:30] But no way to actually manufacture

[32:33] We still haven't seen that they have the ability to manufacture and do what Stern does do what spooky does do

[32:39] Jersey Jack does um

[32:41] Right. Yeah, I don't know nor do I really care. I mean if they came out with a game. I wouldn't even play it

[32:45] Right

[32:46] That's how much that's a little I care about what they're up to

[32:48] Okay, so hot wheels american pinball how I I listened to Josh Kuhler today and another podcast and he was saying how

[32:55] You got to get your order in now if you want to buy July so

[33:00] How do you think they do coming out of out of this pandemic? I practically forgot that was even that even existed still

[33:07] Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, there's people who buy stuff like that's a thing

[33:11] We've got like the pin-side mindset of who buys games what type of games people want to buy what type of themes

[33:18] Sell or don't sell but there are a lot of people who they're just not part of this

[33:22] Universe they have a game room in their house or a room that they want to be a game room they call up a distributor

[33:26] Hey, what do you have I got this this this oh give me that one so who knows?

[33:30] I mean it could do okay, but I mean and you said this before with hot wheels when it comes to

[33:34] Nostalgic type licenses most of them work when they have

[33:38] When they're character based because you remember the characters you remember the lines dialogue you remember

[33:43] The scenes and the stories and hot wheels doesn't have that and I know they're using like some

[33:49] animated videos and whatnot for their

[33:52] For modes and what have you but um, but that's not anything anyone has an attachment to um

[33:58] So so I I think it's a miss for a theme pick

[34:01] I don't think it's gonna move the needle much at all. Why can't they why can't American pinball figure this out by now

[34:06] Like what what's going on over there? What are your thoughts? I mean this is the third swing at the plate

[34:12] These are these are not like newbies to the industry like balsars been around the block a million times

[34:17] What's happening? They've got endless capital. It seems to make these games

[34:22] I don't know. It's kind of like in the old days when you had

[34:25] William the state of east got leave I feel like they're the got leave like got leave would get licenses like

[34:30] Like waterworld and barbed wire. It's like

[34:33] Shit no one cared about but they probably got it cheap, you know, you know, I'm like okay

[34:39] I take water world over October fest, but I'm just at this point

[34:43] It just feels like do you think if hot wheels doesn't

[34:46] succeed that we're gonna see game four and five from these from these guys?

[34:50] I don't know. I don't know what they're their money. So I mean, does that they're a company that makes other stuff right?

[34:54] That's like sort of the main business

[34:56] It sort of feels like pinball sort of the pet project

[34:58] So I suppose if pinball isn't putting them in the ground financially

[35:03] They can keep trying right

[35:06] Yeah, it would be nice if they if they came out with a theme that was that was a

[35:10] More relevant or had more

[35:12] Nostalgia, you know, if you're gonna go for an old theme. It's got to be something that has nostalgic pool on people that makes them

[35:18] So excited. They they want to buy the game. I mean, that's that's the situation

[35:22] With with Stern and all these companies they theoretically

[35:26] They're trying to pick themes that will make you buy the game without playing it

[35:29] Which seems so easy to do and then I see half of these themes and I'm like

[35:34] What are you thinking like let me let me let me ask you about beetle juice for example, right?

[35:39] It is just phenomenal. So why was that passed on and George Gomez said like we could have made it and we passed on it because nobody was passionate about

[35:48] Beetle juice, but we're passionate about black night. That's that's weird. Yeah. I don't know

[35:52] I mean again, you know sometimes like I was saying with sort of the the the age thing where if you weren't the right age at the right time certain phenomena

[36:01] You just weren't part of it like for instance with us like you know like we're not into Pokemon right like I don't care about Pokemon

[36:06] You don't care about Pokemon. I'm assuming but if we were just a few years younger

[36:10] Pokemon was huge and that would have taken us you know, I was in college when Pokemon came out

[36:14] So it's like I just totally missed it

[36:16] But I can't deny that it's a huge phenomenon with with a massive amount of fans

[36:21] So maybe they just were like weren't in the right sort of age bracket to be swept up in that Tim Burton

[36:26] Scene of of the 80s, you know, it was like peewee beetle juice Batman

[36:31] But that's where I get confused because

[36:34] Clearly beetle juice falls into that time period that hits the core buying demographic right on the bullseye

[36:42] Yeah, I agree. It's weird that none of them connected with it if that's what happened

[36:46] I mean maybe there's something other reason maybe maybe it was hard to license maybe

[36:50] But that's what frustrate frustrate me about pinball themes is

[36:55] Stern just seems to be all over the map lately though. I mean you're going Ninja Turtles

[37:00] Monsters. I mean there's like

[37:02] 20 something years between those properties

[37:05] Sure, and it's okay. It's okay for different. You know, it's okay for them to shoot for different demographics

[37:10] I mean the thing with Stern is you know, they always have what five six different titles still in production at any given time

[37:16] So it's actually good for them to kind of have a portfolio of things that hit different age groups

[37:21] You got beetles and monsters for people who are

[37:24] Around in the 60s. You've got stuff like Ninja Turtles or Jurassic Park for people who's nostalgia's the 80s and 90s

[37:30] Right, you know, I don't think it's a bad thing that they bounce around to different eras

[37:34] I think it's it's it's good for them to have that like you know for their distributors to have something for everyone in a sense

[37:40] And they don't care. I said this on my show earlier. I mean just you know

[37:44] They've got a menu of of themes from various

[37:47] Generations and all money goes to Stern and

[37:51] And after this it'll be Godzilla or it'll be Led Zeppelin and then they'll keep going and keep giving people options

[37:58] So Jersey Jack pinball. Did you see the little teaser they put up today?

[38:02] Yeah, I really have no idea. What was that about so it was like what is it the game has changed?

[38:07] Yes, like innovation US for innovation like and the games about to change and then it quickly cut to all their games

[38:14] What what do you think's about to change in the game? Well, look we know the next two games right toy story and guns and roses

[38:21] So okay, we have themes

[38:23] But what the what would massively be an innovative change? I mean, I guess would it be internet?

[38:30] Possibly. I don't know what what I can't imagine what would be so innovative to spark that trailer

[38:36] Yeah, I was watching it and as I saw all those

[38:39] Adjectives pop up, you know you asked for innovation and I was kind of like I was telling someone

[38:45] I think they've already

[38:46] Delivered on these questions, you know

[38:49] I think Jersey Jack has

[38:51] Innovated I think they have changed the game. I think what people are really hoping for

[38:56] From Jersey Jack is that they find more of the simple fun in the game

[39:02] And I think that's to me what I'm hoping they find in guns and roses and in toy story

[39:07] Is they stop overbaking their products would you agree with that? Yeah, yeah, I think uh, yeah sometimes they I mean look there

[39:15] They're they have the passion to to shoot for

[39:19] You know like you're in the case of the halvage is a massively huge rule set with a billion modes and what have you but

[39:25] Uh, I don't know sometimes sometimes less is more like sometimes pinball doesn't need that and you know

[39:30] It depends on the design. It depends on the theme, you know

[39:33] I'm not an advocate for

[39:35] Purely making a machine one way or the other, you know, I love TNA. I love iron man those are super simple games

[39:40] I but I also love Lord of the Rings or Simpsons which are more complex and deep games

[39:46] You know, whatever works for the theme and design

[39:49] You've cooked up, but like I was telling you the other day, you know like with toy story

[39:53] You know you've got okay, you can make toy story where you shove four movies worth of material into a game

[39:58] Or you can just make it about Andy's room like the game could be Andy's room and

[40:02] That could be an amazing game, you know

[40:04] I don't think they're gonna have like some game changing thing

[40:09] Uh, I've I've fully expect guns and roses to be a game that will respond to the feedback that they've gotten from pirates and some of the

[40:20] Some of the skepticism around making these games too complex and and too

[40:23] complicated because even as I think about pirates and it's it's a game that no one can stop talking about because of the fact that they're not making anymore

[40:30] But I would just imagine Lord of the Rings if Keith made it so you have to select from each member of the fellowship

[40:38] You could choose from at the beginning of the game with different attributes. It's just like why it's too much

[40:43] It's like it's like a role playing game and when when you step up to a pinball machine

[40:47] You know you go back to kind of like the the sort of Valley Williams

[40:52] Theory you want there to be something super obvious

[40:56] That looks fun, you know like medieval madness. Oh, there's a castle. I'm gonna hit that

[41:01] But then you have all this other nuance that you can discover later

[41:04] but if if you're

[41:06] If you get a wall of text and characters and attributes and all this shit from the second you press start

[41:12] It's overwhelming. I'm just like I don't know what any of this means. I don't give a fuck right

[41:17] That's me, but I feel like that's probably a lot of people who would step up to that game maybe in and at home use

[41:22] You can memorize those 83 characters and what they do. Let's talk about the game that I feel like everyone's forgotten about

[41:29] Stranger things are you are you a fan of the show? There was a stranger things. What?

[41:35] Is it an amazing? I like the show. I mean, but think about like that show is so popular

[41:40] Brian Eddie the man who designed some of like the top five games on Pinside and maybe arguably the best game of all time and medieval madness and attack from Mars

[41:50] His return to bimbal. What do you think has this game just fallen into a black haul or is this just canada being a cynic?

[41:57] I like what do you think yeah?

[41:58] Hey, he's a real you know just

[42:01] Brian Eddie's a super nice guy. It was a real sweet guy. I mean just on a personal level

[42:04] He's a friend and I like him a lot

[42:06] So you know if I talk any shit about the game. I don't want I hope he doesn't take too much of friends

[42:11] But yeah, I don't know like I think it came out with the code kind of under under baked and that I mean that's not his fault

[42:17] It seemed like they were going for more of the

[42:20] The dark and spooky thing rather than making it a little bit more fun with some of the stuff about the kids and and what they do

[42:26] You know people were skeptical of the

[42:29] The projector, you know, I mean I get that they're trying something new

[42:33] But just to have a giant wall in the game. I don't know if that was what anyone really wanted

[42:38] Can I run an internet idea by you? Okay, because I know we we talk about internet as terms of gameplay

[42:43] But let me let me run a scenario by you imagine

[42:46] If all the Ellie machines came with a walkie-talkie attached to like the lockdown bar

[42:54] Why I don't want my pinball my pinball machine never a microphone and to be listening to it

[42:58] It's a walkie-talkie and you could like you could hit the channel

[43:02] I'd be like anywhere else out there. You could talk to other Ellie owners via their walkie talkies

[43:08] Wouldn't that be amazing? No because we have phones and if we want to talk to people we can just call people

[43:14] The game came out and it had the big ramp and it had the demigorgan and it didn't have season three

[43:21] Is that a problem Greg when you've when you've got to franchise? That's in the middle of it's

[43:27] Of it's narrative and you leave it out

[43:29] No, I think that's not that big of a deal when it comes to a pinball machine, you know a pinball machine is in a

[43:34] Complete DVD box set you don't always need the entire story of the thing

[43:40] To be to make the machine good if you kind of have the basics of the characters and some of the villains

[43:45] It's it's enough, you know like you know like the sopranos came out and that didn't have the whole show in it

[43:52] But it had looked there's there's you know the mob and you're trying to rob people and shake people down from money

[43:57] You know it has the essence of the theme and sometimes that's enough. I mean

[44:03] You know like I don't know I'm bringing up Avengers because it's not a great game, but like Avengers was just based on the first movie

[44:09] But whatever it's fine. It's the Avengers all the characters are there and then

[44:13] You know same like Guardian's

[44:16] Yeah, exactly. It's it's not a that's not a deal breaker. I don't think that was a big deal that it

[44:20] It

[44:21] Just had the first few seasons

[44:23] But don't you wish like Rick and Morty where you can add the fourth season and they they inked a deal with Justin

[44:30] Where they can incorporate the the newer season. I think that's cool

[44:35] I mean especially the Rick and Morty because it's comedy so it's like to update your game and get more funny

[44:40] That's awesome. Do you think we're gonna see that? I'm curious about that with spooky. Do you think we're actually good to see that happen?

[44:46] I mean they already said all the modes that they've planned aren't even in the game yet

[44:50] So if anything we're gonna keep getting updates with with more modes

[44:54] I'm always a little skeptical because the incentive to keep making something better and better

[44:59] It it's got to lean a little bit when you've already sold out in four hours and you've got everyone

[45:04] Money and they're committed, but I feel like they are gonna do a justice and I feel like Scott

[45:10] Is on a mission and every time I talk to him. He's like look Chris. It's not about that

[45:14] He's like now I feel an obligation

[45:16] To make this game as amazing as possible and I love hearing stuff like that because I love hearing that

[45:21] He's still restless to make sure this game goes down in history as a great game and not just as a sellout in four hours

[45:29] And then they abandon ship like the monsters

[45:32] Yeah, I mean they're passionate about the game they're passionate about the theme

[45:36] And just the way they set up that game actually lends itself to you know because sometimes you know like we were saying sometimes

[45:41] Too many modes is just too much. It's like you can you can just go too far

[45:44] But because we're gonna moody the modes are all random how they start

[45:48] Just having more of them in there just adds sort of more fun because you're gonna even if you have a real short game

[45:53] Where you only start one mode you're probably gonna see a lot more different content

[45:58] Once they add more stuff into the game and that's just a plus for that type of design that games fun because you've got the modes and the adventures

[46:06] And then you've got the dimensions you go into and it almost feels like

[46:10] those two things working in unison

[46:13] exponentially

[46:15] Make the game refreshing every time you play it because you don't know what dimension you're gonna hit and you don't know what

[46:21] Adventure you're gonna go on and and they're all fun and quirky and weird it's it's it's it's a fun game

[46:28] I I can't wait to get mine. I'm not sure when it's ready to ship

[46:33] I'm trying to fly out from my building. It's weird now Greg. It's ready to just so much coming out right now

[46:38] I'm kind of like do I just wait and see over the next month, but no, I mean I don't know

[46:44] I don't think I don't think I don't I'm not getting Ninja Turtles over Rick and Morty

[46:48] I can definitively say that there's there's right it does not make me want to give up Rick and Morty

[46:53] Guns and roses different story because I'm a huge G&R fan

[46:56] But I don't think we're gonna see G&R this summer. What do you think do you think the move to Chicago?

[47:02] Do you think Jersey Jack is gonna get games out the door anytime soon? Yeah, well, I mean they just dropped that teaser

[47:07] So does that mean something in relation to the one the next game is coming? It's it's hard to say it

[47:12] But but as far as yeah, they also dropped it on the day Ninja Turtles got announced now

[47:18] That's an interesting bullish move. Don't you think yeah, they might just be trying to get some attention

[47:24] Well, all they gotta do is give me like leak some stuff to canada and I'll get them attention

[47:28] I mean, I think they're I think they're nervous

[47:30] They might have caught wind that I might have some G&R details. I'm gonna share next week

[47:34] Yeah, but as far as like you know, you know, you got Rick and Morty coming mines a little bit later

[47:38] I think mine is one 70 or so

[47:40] um, but yeah when my Rick and Morty family is imminent

[47:44] Like I have to decide to sell a game. So that's everything with Ninja Turtles, you know kind of going back to that if

[47:49] I'm at the point where if I get something something's got to go and then I have to look at my collection and be like

[47:54] Okay, is there anything I'm ready to say goodbye to you?

[47:58] To get something new and that and that's tough. What do you got? I'm gonna tell you right now. What should go? What do you got?

[48:03] Here we go. All right, this is my collection

[48:07] Simpson's pinball party Lord of the Rings revenge from Mars monster bash bram stupor's Dracula circus Voltaire black night 2000

[48:14] Adam's family whitewater starts with next generation family guy roadshow

[48:19] No good gopers the shadow tron le

[48:23] acdc doctor who theater magic metallica

[48:26] medieval madness Iron Man and tn. Okay

[48:30] Man, um you missed it you missed on that tron Ali a few years ago for a big profit. So you missed the

[48:37] I love tron though. I don't that's the thing. I don't want to get ready to try right um

[48:42] I would like roadshow

[48:44] I love roadshow. It's so good. No good gopers. I see

[48:50] I have some quirky games that some people would easily let go but I

[48:53] I love that game a lot. I like games with personality and cartoon characters and and those two

[49:00] Fit the bill for me plus plus I bought my gopers from

[49:03] The actor that did the voice of Pac-Man in the 1980s cartoon. So I don't know. It's got a cool story attached to it

[49:09] Uh, I keep thinking theater magic. No particular reason other than

[49:14] I'm just not as attached to it. I guess as other games

[49:18] But then what happens is then I turn it on and play it and I'm like man, this is a great game

[49:21] Right, but uh, so yeah, honestly, I really don't know yet at one point I was thinking

[49:26] Simpson's strangely enough because it is a great game

[49:29] But it's one of those games that you just you have to hunt her down for like 45 minutes and have a really good game on it

[49:34] So now you have a very

[49:37] special version of start track the next generation. Oh yeah, you want me to play some here. I'll play something cool that's probably

[49:44] Most people haven't heard okay

[49:47] Yeah, so I bought my start track the next generation from gates McFadden who played dr. Cruster on the show

[49:54] Let me get my pug off the couch as she can

[49:58] Yeah, so I bought this start truck next generation around 2008. I think brand new in the box

[50:05] She had never

[50:06] Opened it. So I got to open a valley Williams game. All right, so every actor who got a start track next generation

[50:13] Has a custom ROM on their game that has uh some other outtakes from the recording session

[50:18] So these are hers

[50:20] Hello

[50:23] James Cleve and James Cleve and

[50:26] Hello

[50:28] James Cleve and James Cleve and do you have medical insurance? Do you realize most of my patients die?

[50:34] There you go. There's a bunch of now. How are you playing those right now in the computer?

[50:39] No, that's my machine if you're in the attract mode and you press both river buttons it plays those. Oh, that's cool

[50:45] now

[50:48] I don't know why she was sending that but this is um she was sending that wow

[50:52] So that's like I mean you and I have debated about I mean this game is obviously very valuable

[50:56] It's very rare start trick the next generation

[50:59] When you look at a game like that Greg I mean how do you look at a game like that then then pan over to like a modern stern and be like

[51:06] $9,000 like

[51:09] Well, that's why I really don't I don't buy too many new games anymore

[51:12] That's why I get so picky about every little aspect. I'm like okay if I'm gonna drop that much

[51:18] this game has to bring

[51:20] Everything that I'm hoping for which you know never seems to happen but uh

[51:26] But yeah, look I mean I never considered my it's kind of funny. I was never a belly Williams now when I started in this hobby

[51:31] I was the guy who kind of liked like I like stern games. I like the east games. I like Sega games and all the all the

[51:36] Collectors hated everything that wasn't belly Williams and it's kind of funny that now a lot of the collectors are pure stern

[51:45] stern army stern only

[51:47] um and like sometimes I'm seen as like the anti-stern guy even though I still have

[51:51] Seven stern games that I've owned you know, I haven't owned any spiked games but from like Sam and white star

[51:56] I've owned almost every game at one point or the other so yeah, I'm not anti-stern but like yeah, I

[52:01] I

[52:02] Think that just in general the 90s games are the greatest games the greatest designs and

[52:08] greatest implementations of the themes they're based on

[52:10] um and yeah, so yeah, it's hard to look at the sticker prices

[52:14] if the game isn't

[52:16] Bringing everything at the table. I mean, you know, I know sometimes you talk about like what games used to cost

[52:21] But like when I ordered tronle it was 5350 shipped with a shaker. That's crazy

[52:28] That's how much that was they were selling for like 12k plus inbox for for a long time

[52:34] Yeah, after they were they kind of drag because what happened was like when games like tron and ironman were coming out

[52:40] those were like sterns

[52:42] Like lean years where borg was the only designer

[52:45] Lonnie was the only programmer on staff and lineman was helping uh

[52:49] like

[52:50] remotely and the games were just considered cheap and and the collectors who you know were mostly about valley Williams games

[52:58] But with sometimes by stern games, you know, a lot of the collectors they like lord of the rings

[53:01] They like pirates they like simpsons they like family guy

[53:04] But once once like ironman and tron came out people were like they're cheap their photoshop

[53:09] There's nothing on the play field these games suck and they wrote them off completely

[53:13] And then a year or so later when people started to play them and realize oh these games are really fun

[53:19] That's when the prices started to shoot up, you know, and that's why they remade ironman. It was a flop at first

[53:24] And then people discovered how fun it was and then the demand went up

[53:27] Yeah, and and also like tron at least still one of the only

[53:31] truly

[53:32] unique Ellie machines they've ever made because it has a unique

[53:36] mode in it

[53:37] It's it's amazing to me how and there's no there's no premium there's no premium

[53:42] And the death punk multi ball continues to keep the the prices of that game pretty stable

[53:49] You know, I get I get labeled as someone who rags on stern two and like the too long as games

[53:54] I've ever had in my collection were Lord of the Rings and Batman 66 and I

[54:01] completely understand

[54:03] Why people love stern machines? I've loved stern machines. I just for the life of me can never understand how a starttruck the next generation

[54:12] can be

[54:14] God tin for $5,000 and people like no, I'd rather go in on this

[54:20] Pro version of a

[54:22] Monsters it's like weird to me. It's like it's the new style of

[54:26] Collector I think where like when I started you know collecting was more about

[54:32] You found stuff cheap around town on Craig's list at auctions and you took it home and you fixed it yourself

[54:38] and and and that was part of the hobby was fixing your own games and bringing them back to life

[54:42] and collecting old games like new games just weren't a factor and

[54:46] Now you've got a lot of new people in the hobby who

[54:49] They don't have that experience of going out and hunting games

[54:52] I mean partially because it's hard to find those games anymore. You know the inventory of used shitty broken games

[54:57] Got sucked up by like people like me and my friends

[55:00] So like those options aren't even out there if you want to go that route. So

[55:04] New games is what

[55:06] People gravitate towards because you can get them. You know, I want a game. Okay. There's new games

[55:10] I can go get one right now and I get it like there

[55:13] There's there's a hassle involved with buying a used game site unseen having a shift having a package

[55:20] Taking the word of the seller that everything is the way that they describe it. I mean it's

[55:26] Everyone has good and bad experiences, but when you buy a new inbox

[55:29] Most likely you're gonna have a much better experience than if you know

[55:33] Then if you're rolling the dice on a game that you haven't seen in person. Yeah, theoretically. You're right

[55:39] I mean, I look I bought a lot of new games and some were absolutely perfect and never had a problem and some were non-stop problems

[55:44] We're ahead. Yeah, I have the the play field up and was constantly working on them

[55:49] Um, oh really quick. So I know you mentioned, you know

[55:51] Tron is like the true Ellie because it's got extra stuff

[55:54] No one ever talks about it because no one really cares about these games

[55:56] But rolling stones Ellie and avatar Ellie

[55:59] They also have some custom stuff that aren't in the pro version and those games don't have premiums

[56:03] But you know, no one really wants those

[56:05] I still think for the prices of these Ellie's I can't understand why they just can't throw a unique mode into each one

[56:14] It just wouldn't make the experience of owning it

[56:17] And then maybe Jared could actually say he's in an elite group of 500 Ninja Turtles Ellie owners because there's like

[56:25] Something something unique to the gameplay in the Ellie

[56:29] Yeah, well look it take it's so hard for them to even get these games

[56:33] Finished like to to expect an extra thing every time it's just a whole other

[56:37] How how long do you think it takes to code a multi-ball mode like how I mean I'm always like I don't buy it

[56:44] I really don't I don't buy it. I keep take that long

[56:48] This switch plus this switch equals this sequence of things happening

[56:51] Well, that's a thing every every game is different

[56:53] Every game is different logic and every game has a different flow to it in terms of right not physical flow

[56:58] But like how

[56:59] What's happening in any given time is time what you're hitting what you're likely to hit and I think it's actually fairly difficult because Pimball is not

[57:07] You know linear like a video game every every Pimball machines physically

[57:12] Different and every little thing can make it a totally different experience to program I think to find that sweet spot

[57:20] I agree with that

[57:21] But once you get the entire game programs adding one little sweet extra

[57:27] Can't be that hard, but apparently it is and then here's the thing Greg

[57:31] They don't need to because the people buy anyway

[57:34] It's like if if people would expect more and demand more from stern with these LEDs

[57:40] They would get more. I mean, I'm still flabbergasted when I see a

[57:45] $9,000 Jersey Jack machine next to a $9,000 stern. I mean I I look

[57:50] I agreed the sterns are more fun

[57:52] more approachable and

[57:54] Usually based on better themes, but if you just look at the what's in these games. It's it's comically

[58:00] World's apart. Yeah, well the only Jersey Jack I've had so far is hobbit and I know how you feel about that

[58:05] I did sell my hobbit, but honestly, I still like the game. I think it was a really fun game and and

[58:10] You know, it was kind of like a cinematic experience in a Pimball machine pretty much I'm like

[58:16] You know anything probably since Lord of the Rings um, but yeah, just physically that game was a beast and and gorgeous

[58:25] You've listened to most of my shows. I mean I

[58:28] I'm hard on Jersey Jack not because I'm not impressed by their games

[58:32] I'm far more impressed with their games than stern machines

[58:35] There's just always that thing about each one that always is like

[58:40] Well you want to own you want to own it. Yeah, I want to

[58:45] Yeah, it's the same thing with me, you know when I brag on

[58:49] Stern games and and I you know, I've done it a little too much a part of it is sick

[58:53] You know sometimes people think I'm like this massive

[58:55] Sternator which I'm really not because honestly I'm really

[58:58] I'm friends with a lot of people that work there because you know when I did the family when we did family guy Pimball

[59:04] I did the artwork for the machine

[59:05] So I had a brief sort of stint working with stern and I became friends with a lot of those guys and you know

[59:10] I it's one of those weird things where I sort of have to walk this line of being like a friend, but also a customer

[59:16] Yeah, so sometimes I say shit that you wouldn't say to your friends

[59:19] But it's because I'm a customer of an expensive machine

[59:22] Um, but honestly, you know, I used to buy Stern games all the time

[59:25] I used to buy new inbox games all the time and

[59:28] When I talk shit, it's really just

[59:30] Because I kind of want to be in that place where I feel inspired to want to buy one of their games

[59:34] It's it's right. It's not to hate on them. It's because I I want to kind of

[59:40] I kind of want to give them money, you know, right? Right?

[59:43] Well Greg, I appreciate you taking the time to come on to the world's most hated and most adored Pimball podcast

[59:50] Can you just been ball podcast any final thoughts on turtles? It sounds like you want to see more of the game

[59:55] You know, I'm surprised on your show. We didn't even once mentioned the artwork

[01:00:00] Well, let's talk about it because I yeah, we um what do you think about zombie eddies art package on this game?

[01:00:05] I mean, I think it's really nice um what I what I think is cool is

[01:00:10] That you know the original show didn't have one singular style really like the first few episodes were done by

[01:00:17] Toe animation the next

[01:00:19] Big syndication package of episodes was done by like three different studios

[01:00:22] So they all had their own model sheets and they all had their own style and then like the toy packages had their own style

[01:00:26] I feel like

[01:00:27] Jeremy has sort of picked from

[01:00:30] His favorite things from the different styles and sort of combined it into kind of a

[01:00:35] Anomage that also is his style, you know, like like this is really subtle

[01:00:40] But if you notice like like a lot of the drawings the turtles have a line down the center of their nose

[01:00:45] That's specifically from like the first five episodes and it never happened again. So it's like

[01:00:50] You know, he threw that in there. That's kind of like, you know for the hardcore fans, I think

[01:00:54] um

[01:00:55] But yeah, I think it look I think it looks great just as a as a fan of the show um

[01:01:00] It it looks

[01:01:01] You know because you look at a lot of old turtles merchandise and box like the box art of

[01:01:07] of

[01:01:08] Toys and and merch like they they can look pretty goofy on a lot of that artwork and I think he

[01:01:15] He kind of clashed it up, you know from what

[01:01:17] The actual merchandise the eighties used to be I think the game looks great. I I

[01:01:24] I was a little disappointed that everyone saw the artwork in low-res with crappy video screenshots of the distributor

[01:01:33] Seminar that they did you know, it's like it's always unfortunate and then when we saw the final

[01:01:39] Version of it and HD today like he put it up this morning and I saw it was like no like this is this is

[01:01:45] awesome like it just it immediately hits you and yeah and and capture the spirit of Ninja Turtles perfectly

[01:01:52] I do it's always tough to it's always tough to sell these

[01:01:56] The visuals of these games online honestly like even great art packages like

[01:02:00] Reving shitty art or games that you think are gonna look shitty when you see them in person a lot of the times

[01:02:04] They look way better just because they're they're sort of bathed in their own

[01:02:08] Light from you know, which cast shadows and gives it some depth

[01:02:13] Uh, it's like I've had games in the past that like technically have

[01:02:16] Bad art, but like they actually look pretty good in person when you're playing

[01:02:20] Yeah, I mean his look nobody knows better than the artist

[01:02:25] How to capture their art to look the best and and Jeremy's very smart. He understands all of this I

[01:02:31] I always hear him being like why did they use this shot the saturation levels are off and like when he put up his shots this morning

[01:02:39] It was awesome

[01:02:40] So I just hope I don't understand why Stern can't figure out how to get content out

[01:02:47] Into the world and understand the way the internet works

[01:02:51] So if you're gonna do a distributor call in which you show them video footage of the game

[01:02:57] Like do they really expect these people not to screen grab it and share it immediately? It's like why do they do that like

[01:03:03] Just go live every time

[01:03:06] That surprise every time these leaks happen um

[01:03:09] You know, I a lot of the

[01:03:12] I think a lot of the leaks though

[01:03:14] They're not from distributors. I think some of it's from regular media, you know, they're not like

[01:03:19] The usual pinball suspects, but but even in that case, you know, you can

[01:03:24] You know, they can and they can put like passwords on or you know, they could they can make it so like they could give them the

[01:03:30] The materials and you can't open it until you know right before the release date. Yeah

[01:03:35] I mean no one cares though right in the real world like nobody cares. It's like

[01:03:40] Yeah, this isn't the new iPhone where if you leak it early and it's not what people want

[01:03:45] Apple stocks gonna lose billions in value. I mean, it's so silly. I saw that they had Jared

[01:03:50] Well, we usually know anyway like we like we knew this was turtles

[01:03:54] Last year right like you only think that really caught everyone by surprise was Rick and Morty

[01:03:58] I think he came out of nowhere. They kept that secret right

[01:04:02] Yeah, no totally and it's like we know it's zombie Eddie. We know it's John Borg. We know it's an interturtle

[01:04:06] So it's like surprise surprise. It's John Borg. It's just zombie and it's an interturtles. It's like

[01:04:11] So yeah, I mean, I thought it looked great. I wish that they would do one thing for

[01:04:17] The people and I wish they would implement more of like a rad cow the foiled artwork

[01:04:24] I don't understand why Stern has never brought back

[01:04:27] the foiled

[01:04:29] artwork that they pulled back man 66 SLE like it's not expensive. They just haven't done it

[01:04:35] I didn't become a I'm sure I didn't become a standard like I've got I've got an iron man

[01:04:40] The first iron man ball where and that's where they that's not the first time they use the foil

[01:04:44] If I think the first time they use the foil artwork was on Mustang LE I think

[01:04:49] Um, but it did it on iron man ball and it's absolutely gorgeous. It's awesome

[01:04:53] And yeah, I can't imagine that it's that much more expensive than a regular decal

[01:04:57] um

[01:04:58] Yeah, that would be an amazing just standard thing to do on any machine right and these are and also like

[01:05:04] These are no longer mirrored back glasses the way they used to be. I mean it is very much

[01:05:10] It is a piece of glass instead of plastic, but it's still just like

[01:05:14] glued onto it instead of like or printed on it. I've seen the I've seen the back and forth where people have debated

[01:05:20] Whether it's a true back glass anymore. I mean

[01:05:23] Honestly, I only have one way to fight out right just

[01:05:28] So smash it on the ground. So artwork was I think the artwork one people over in the end

[01:05:34] Which which which I'm glad because Jeremy is great and he's a great asset for stern

[01:05:39] Dwight didn't screw this game up even though he did all he could to screw up the stream tonight

[01:05:44] It's a guy like it's literally just like just Dwight. Oh, I that's that's my main memory of the stream

[01:05:51] Um, the game seems like

[01:05:53] Yeah, I mean we went over that. Yeah, it's got a lot in it

[01:05:56] I think this game's gonna go down if if you were to ask me

[01:05:59] I think this game is gonna be fun

[01:06:01] It's gonna be appealing to those who like Ninja Turtles if you don't really like Ninja Turtles

[01:06:05] So I don't think it's gonna move people onto the other side and jump into it the way

[01:06:11] someone might

[01:06:12] Jump into iron maiden if they didn't like the band as much. I don't think it has that same Paul

[01:06:18] Yeah, I don't know I mean at the end of the day

[01:06:21] Again with with every game that appeals to a certain demographic those gonna be people who are into it

[01:06:25] They're gonna be people who aren't into it. You can't please everyone and yeah, if you don't like turtles go by

[01:06:30] Iron maiden or go whatever monsters or whatever speaks to you, but um

[01:06:35] But at the end of the day, it's like even if you're not into the theme

[01:06:39] It's it's a basic good versus evil

[01:06:42] Concept which I think is good for pinball. You're the good guy. You're fighting the bad guy

[01:06:45] So like even if you don't know anything about Ninja Turtles

[01:06:48] You could walk up to this game and and kind of figure figure it out or at least the vibe of it pretty quickly

[01:06:54] Isn't it weird that we even care like how well a game sells?

[01:06:58] Like like like none of us are investors in the company like we're not investors like and we never get the data anyway

[01:07:05] It's just a weird thing that we all spend years like trying to speculate

[01:07:10] As if we're vested in this I think what we all want though is just we want to see the things we love

[01:07:16] Brought to life in pinball format in a way that does it justice so on a skill of one to ten Greg

[01:07:22] How well does this game in your mind

[01:07:25] Deliver the Ninja Turtles that you love on a scale of one to ten dang

[01:07:29] I mean like I said it's it's got its pros and cons

[01:07:32] But I think it all came from a good place like you know sometimes a license can feel cynical

[01:07:36] You know like oh, we're just getting this license because it's the hot thing

[01:07:40] It definitely seemed like everyone involved with this

[01:07:43] love that show

[01:07:45] so like

[01:07:47] You know, I can't give it a shitty number

[01:07:49] One to ten I give it an eight and eight yeah, let's say I just based on the passion that went into it

[01:07:54] Yeah, I wish I had the real voices. I wish it had the real clips, but

[01:07:58] It's it's still like an awesome 80s Ninja Turtle theme game if

[01:08:04] That's you want yeah, I'm around there as well

[01:08:06] I mean, I I think if you love turtles and like Jared loves Ninja Turtles and the guys

[01:08:11] Gushing over this game and look at this game's gonna put a smile on people's faces

[01:08:15] Then it's gonna put a smile on people's faces other than Zack Sharp when they play it

[01:08:19] And I think people are getting they're gonna enjoy it and

[01:08:22] You know look and here's the good news if you don't like this game

[01:08:26] Good news is in two to three months sterno have something else for you

[01:08:30] And then in three months from then they'll have something else for you to choose from and that's why

[01:08:34] It really does when I was watching the stream tonight

[01:08:36] I almost didn't care. I was more impressed by the camaraderie of the stern team

[01:08:42] And I was and I and I have respect for these men because they they make it happen

[01:08:47] I'm so sick of all the excuses by all these other companies

[01:08:51] Stern just gets it done like they're I like it or not they get it done

[01:08:56] They get the game in a box and you can have it in a few weeks. That's amazing in 2020. Yeah

[01:09:03] And it's nice to see that again like collaborative

[01:09:07] Kind of collaborative level they were all it seems really passionate about this theme and like

[01:09:11] New what they were going for I think sometimes when a game comes out and it's not that good

[01:09:16] I get the feeling it's because like everyone was kind of working in their own

[01:09:20] Bubble designer doing one thing

[01:09:22] Programmer gets the design they're like okay. What's this? I have to make a game out of it

[01:09:26] This seems like a situation where everyone had like a common goal. Yeah

[01:09:30] And it's probably ultimately made for a better game nobody said what you see is what you get

[01:09:37] That will go down in infamy as the line of willy-wanka

[01:09:41] When they were streaming. Oh is that yeah, that's what they said Joey

[01:09:44] What you see is what you get what do we were asking questions about the code and how it would mature

[01:09:49] Well Greg

[01:10:13] It provides friendships with people that I never would have met and to me ultimately that's the power of

[01:10:20] Pimball it is how it connects people and that we can even geek out over this stuff
