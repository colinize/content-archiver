[00:00] You're out of touch, I'm outta touch,

[00:04] but I'm outta my head, when you not all around,

[00:08] say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say,

[00:12] Uh, welcome, everybody, to Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[00:15] It's Monday, it is mid June, and I'm watching,

[00:19] all of these, John Wick, Ellie,

[00:21] Pop Up For Sale, on, Pinside, and, I've been, thinking, about,

[00:25] it, all, day, who's, gonna, take, advantage,

[00:28] of this moment in pinball.

[00:30] Stern pinball usually does not get it this wrong,

[00:34] but my gosh, did they really get it wrong?

[00:38] Let's talk about a moment in which the big pinball juggernaut

[00:43] has swung and missed for the fences with John Wick,

[00:48] who out there in the pinball world

[00:50] should have been taking advantage of this moment right now.

[00:55] Before we do that, a huge shout out to John

[00:59] for sending me these pin stadium lights

[01:02] for my Guns N' Roses machine,

[01:04] the one machine that doesn't need more lighting.

[01:08] We're gonna figure out if these neoconsert additions

[01:11] are worth it.

[01:12] I also wanna give a huge shout out to Mr. Ryan Lowe,

[01:17] who just sent me and Brenda some Morimoto Rose,

[01:22] and a little bit extra to go on a date night.

[01:25] Thank you, Ryan Lowe.

[01:27] I really do have the best fans in all the pinball,

[01:31] and also a thank you to Ken Cromwell over at JJP,

[01:35] who's gonna give me another sticker sheet

[01:38] of all of those Guns N' Roses records

[01:40] because I destroyed mine on day one.

[01:44] All right, so here we are.

[01:46] John Wick, who bought it?

[01:48] Unless Stern can manufacture 999 Donald Garrisons

[01:54] in the world, for the most part,

[01:56] this game is never gonna sell.

[01:59] And if you bought one, and I mean this,

[02:01] if you bought an LE of John Wick,

[02:04] you just lost like $4,000

[02:07] because there's less demand for this game

[02:11] than even Venom.

[02:13] I mean it, I mean this thing had a much rockier launch

[02:17] than Venom with the Nunchucks and the Swords and Gungate,

[02:21] and I think people are just tired.

[02:24] I mean, I'm watching these James Bond 60th Snows

[02:28] selling for like $12,000 or best offer,

[02:33] and now you're trying to push these John Wick's for 13,

[02:37] and Stern is looking really vulnerable.

[02:40] Now maybe they're gonna bring out Metallica Ride

[02:43] the Lightning 40th Anniversary next month,

[02:46] but right now they've got nothing.

[02:49] They've got nothing that people want.

[02:52] So who can take advantage of this moment?

[02:55] Who's ready to take advantage of this moment?

[02:57] When you think about all the scheduling out there,

[03:00] Spooky Pinball still gotta make Looney Tunes

[03:03] and Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[03:05] so this is not the right time for them.

[03:08] Barrels of Fun still has to make all these labyrinth games.

[03:11] Now if you ask me, I think they're stalling

[03:14] on cutting the number they're gonna make.

[03:16] They need to just say, we're only making 750.

[03:19] They're not gonna get 400 more orders of labyrinth.

[03:24] Just cut it and say by the end of the year

[03:27] we will be done with labyrinth production,

[03:30] but we know they can't take advantage

[03:33] of John Wick being such a soft seller.

[03:36] You know, Dutch Pinball, they're not ready.

[03:38] I mean, Alice in Wonderland, if they dropped it right now,

[03:43] would have been better timing than Q3 of 2024.

[03:49] I just wanna say Melvin Williams over at DPX.

[03:52] He reached out to Canada.

[03:54] Really nice guy.

[03:55] We're gonna have a talk sometime soon.

[03:58] I'm gonna try to figure out if I can do my interviews again

[04:01] if I have time and I have to figure out how to do it

[04:05] so I can record it the right way,

[04:06] but they're not coming out with Alice in Wonderland

[04:09] until Q3 and we all know that Back to the Future

[04:13] is not coming out until maybe, I think,

[04:15] the earliest, the end of this year.

[04:18] So that takes Dutch Pinball off the table.

[04:21] Haggis Pinball can't even make its own damn game.

[04:23] Like, I think they're out of business.

[04:25] Haggis Pinball can't take advantage of this

[04:27] so we count them out.

[04:29] Then you've got Multimorphic with Princess Bride.

[04:33] Where's that game at, people?

[04:35] I mean, what a great time to announce

[04:37] that Princess Bride games are shipping

[04:40] while John Wick is dead on arrival.

[04:43] But hey, did anybody unbox a single Princess Bride game?

[04:47] Nope.

[04:48] When did they take money on that game?

[04:50] Like, two months ago, three months ago?

[04:52] So there's another company that can't take advantage of this.

[04:55] That eliminates them.

[04:57] Turner Pinball, I don't know, man.

[04:59] Like, yeah, as bad as John Wick is.

[05:02] I don't think people are gonna go buy Ninja Eclipse.

[05:04] No offense, Chris Turner.

[05:05] I know you're listening to this, but we should talk.

[05:08] We should talk about marketing, brother,

[05:10] because you need a theme people want.

[05:12] And even though your game is priced as cheap as a Stern Pro,

[05:16] Stern Pro still carry names like Star Wars and Jurassic Park.

[05:21] And so, you know, you're not really gonna win over people

[05:24] because those options are still far more enticing.

[05:28] And so we're not gonna see them take advantage of it.

[05:31] You got the Pinball brothers would be a great company

[05:34] to hit with the right title at the right time.

[05:37] John Wick dead on arrival and the Pinball brothers

[05:40] is serving up ABBA.

[05:42] In one of the ugliest cabinets of all time,

[05:45] I don't think that game's gonna do well.

[05:48] But Dreadig Gaming's got Funhouse, Remake, 2.0,

[05:52] Rudy's Nightmare.

[05:54] That's something that I think is shipping sometime soon.

[05:57] I think it's on the line right now, so is ABBA.

[06:00] But let's be honest, ladies and gentlemen,

[06:02] these games are not gonna move units.

[06:05] I mean, Stern Pinball will make 1000 John Wick LEDs.

[06:10] Just think about that for a minute.

[06:13] Where are those games going to go?

[06:16] The answer is, they're most likely, most of them,

[06:20] are gonna go to dealers and distributors.

[06:24] And most of them are going to be unsold

[06:27] when those dealers and distributors

[06:30] send Stern a check for $10,000.

[06:34] Now here's the crazy part.

[06:35] I think we're gonna see sooner than later

[06:38] on these John Wick LEDs,

[06:41] I think we're gonna see Stern allow their dealers

[06:44] to sell this game with some sort of summer sale

[06:48] where they're allowed to sell it for like 11 grand

[06:52] or $12,000 and that will be a price they can advertise,

[06:58] because they're not allowed to do that.

[07:00] They've gotta do these backdoor deals.

[07:02] And I think we're gonna see Venom-L-Lease in box,

[07:05] be able to sell them for less than 13.

[07:08] It's the beginning of a whole new period of pinball.

[07:11] These games are piling up,

[07:12] they're not gonna make less of them,

[07:14] and they're charging so much money,

[07:16] when a game doesn't sell, it's gonna sit.

[07:19] All right, so John Wick sitting in boxes,

[07:21] who's gonna get your money?

[07:23] And I think I've noticed this on pin side.

[07:25] I think sales are really soft across the board.

[07:28] I think a lot of you are at a room.

[07:31] Some of you are looking at the economy,

[07:34] maybe a little bit nervously,

[07:35] like it's an election year, who knows what's gonna happen.

[07:38] Some of you have decided to take the pinball money

[07:41] and do other stuff with it.

[07:44] It's also the summertime, I've noticed this.

[07:46] I've always said this, pinball's a little bit

[07:48] of a winter sport.

[07:49] When you're out there in the summertime

[07:52] and you're taking vacations and you're traveling more,

[07:55] you're eating out more,

[07:57] you're spending your money on a lot more activities.

[08:00] And pinball is not really an active sport.

[08:03] You are standing stationary.

[08:06] It is perfect in the winter time

[08:07] when you don't wanna go outside.

[08:09] But right now, I'm even noticing it

[08:11] on my Saturday morning spectacular,

[08:13] not as many people join,

[08:15] because people are traveling on the weekends

[08:18] in these months, and so it makes total sense.

[08:20] So I think sales are normally softer this time of year.

[08:24] Now that being said, who could take advantage

[08:26] of this moment?

[08:27] Chicago Gaming Company,

[08:29] could they take advantage of this moment?

[08:31] Well, they still gotta get all these people,

[08:33] these Pulp Fictions,

[08:34] and everyone who's got a Pulp Fiction LE on order

[08:38] is waiting for their game.

[08:40] I forget how many Pulp Fiction LE's there are.

[08:43] I think there's a thousand of them.

[08:44] And that's the same amount of games

[08:47] that Stern is gonna make of John Wick.

[08:49] It's the same amount of games that Jersey Jack is making

[08:52] of Elton John Collector's Edition,

[08:55] and they've confirmed they're making all 1,000 units.

[08:58] Is Jersey Jack in a good position

[09:01] to take advantage of Stern's mishap with John Wick?

[09:05] Well, here's the thing,

[09:06] it's like they should be getting ready for their next game,

[09:09] but I just don't think we are there yet.

[09:12] I actually don't think Jersey Jack's next

[09:15] is going to come out before Stern's next Cornerstone game.

[09:21] So I think Jersey Jack is gonna miss a golden opportunity

[09:26] to take advantage of the weak John Wick sales.

[09:30] And Elton John, it's hard to tell how well it's selling.

[09:34] I think it's still gonna be a little bit of a slow burn game.

[09:37] I think it's just really expensive.

[09:39] I think people are excited that the game shoots well,

[09:43] but I think most people are probably gonna wait

[09:46] until they see what's down the road from Jersey Jack,

[09:50] because Steve Ritchie's not going anywhere.

[09:53] Steve Ritchie is gonna help mentor Eric Minier

[09:56] and Mark Sidon, and I think the next two years

[09:59] are gonna be great for Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[10:02] I think the pressure is on Stern Pimbal for sure.

[10:06] So Jersey Jack, it's not the right time.

[10:08] They've gotta sell these Elton John units.

[10:11] You know which company should be hitting

[10:13] with something right now that we all want?

[10:15] They've been around for like eight years,

[10:18] and that company is American Pimbal.

[10:21] They know how to make games.

[10:23] They screw games together well, and they just have nothing.

[10:28] They have absolutely nothing ready,

[10:31] nothing around the corner.

[10:33] They've had Ryan McQuaid over there for three years.

[10:37] Can you imagine going to work every day for three years,

[10:42] and you haven't executed anything?

[10:45] Anything.

[10:46] Ryan McQuaid has never released a commercial Pimbal machine.

[10:50] Is he even a Pimbal designer

[10:52] until he has something out in the world?

[10:54] Well, of course he is.

[10:55] He designed the Sonic the Hedgehog game,

[10:57] but that was like five years ago, right?

[11:00] Six years ago, he started on that.

[11:02] And so it's funny, right?

[11:03] Who's paying this guy's salary for three years,

[11:07] and he hasn't executed a single thing?

[11:10] If there ever was a time for American Pimbal

[11:13] to call an audible, get whatever they've got next

[11:17] on the line now, just pull the plug on this barbecue game.

[11:20] Nobody's buying it, and just kind of quickly get

[11:23] to your next game if you have a next game.

[11:26] So American Pimbal, nothing.

[11:29] CGC, nothing.

[11:31] Are you noticing what I'm getting at people?

[11:34] The world's largest Pimbal company, Stern Pimbal,

[11:38] has one of its biggest flops ever happening right now.

[11:43] There are about 12 other Pimbal companies.

[11:47] Not one Pimbal company right now is geared up

[11:51] to take advantage of this moment.

[11:54] Nobody, like nobody's got a game ready to go.

[11:58] Nobody's been waiting for this moment.

[12:01] When you think about the Pimbal landscape right now,

[12:04] the games that are currently out there,

[12:07] they just don't feel like this is it.

[12:10] Like at the most expensive this hobby's ever been.

[12:14] With all of these companies making the effort,

[12:17] we currently right now, when you think about it right now,

[12:20] the new in-box games, the brand new stuff,

[12:24] John Wick Without Guns, Elton John, Abba,

[12:28] Fun House Remake, Barrios Barbecue Challenge,

[12:34] Pulp Fiction, which has taken two years to get out,

[12:38] Looney Tunes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[12:42] Labyrinth, and The Princess Bride.

[12:45] Like that's really it.

[12:47] And when I tell you the Pimbal buying demographic,

[12:51] 40 to 60 year old men, that's what we're hitting them with.

[12:58] Everybody, it's gonna get a lot better.

[13:01] This is a period in which I don't know,

[13:04] like some weird decisions were made.

[13:07] Maybe it was the COVID virus,

[13:09] maybe it was just the lack of market research,

[13:12] but whatever it is and whatever it was,

[13:16] I think every single Pimbal company

[13:19] is gonna have a real awakening and a re-understanding

[13:24] of who it is that buys your games.

[13:28] Your target audience is so easy to figure out.

[13:32] Abba, no.

[13:34] Elton John, kind of, but not as good as it could be.

[13:37] Fun House Remake, nobody asked for it.

[13:40] Barbecue Challenge, dead on arrival.

[13:42] You know, we need somebody to wake up

[13:45] and realize it's not that hard.

[13:50] The moment these companies stop making bad decisions,

[13:55] stop making games that they wanna make for themselves,

[13:59] and actually look at what we want,

[14:02] what we're willing to buy,

[14:05] what if they delivered we would buy instantly.

[14:08] I mean, seeing all these games now not sell out,

[14:11] it's not really a testament that FOMO is dead.

[14:16] It's more of a testament

[14:18] that they've gotten the themes all wrong.

[14:21] If you think FOMO's dead,

[14:23] then what's gonna happen when back to the future comes out?

[14:26] What's gonna happen if the Matrix comes out?

[14:29] What's gonna happen if Harry Potter comes out

[14:32] or Top Gun or Karate Kid or Die Hard or Fifth Element?

[14:36] If these things happen and people deliver things

[14:39] that you really want, Beetlejuice, Batman 89,

[14:43] like if things came out that really struck

[14:46] an emotional chord, you will see FOMO all over again.

[14:51] But the reason why there's no FOMO is it's just like

[14:54] stuff you don't really want.

[14:57] And as I've been saying in this pinball market,

[15:00] as we're seeing all these used games

[15:03] sit forever for sale and these new games not moving,

[15:08] the thing now is you have to get it right more than ever.

[15:12] Now I'm waiting.

[15:13] I'm waiting to see who makes the big next move.

[15:17] Who do you think it's gonna be?

[15:18] You think it's gonna be Stern and Metallica,

[15:21] Spike 3 anniversary?

[15:23] You think it's gonna be that?

[15:24] Is it gonna be a black and white edition of Godzilla?

[15:26] Is Spike 3 even gonna be worth the hype?

[15:29] I'm just gonna go out on a limb right now

[15:30] and I think Spike 3 is gonna be underwhelming.

[15:33] I don't think it's gonna make a Stern machine

[15:35] look or present as good as a Jersey Jack.

[15:38] I think it's all gonna be about internet connectivity.

[15:42] I think it's gonna be about them wanting to get to DLC.

[15:45] And I think DLC and Seth Davis steering this company

[15:49] towards DLC, I think is gonna backfire on Stern.

[15:54] So I think that's gonna be underwhelming.

[15:56] I think if Jersey Jack can get the juggernaut themes

[16:00] that shoot well, that have great artwork,

[16:02] where the code's not too confusing,

[16:04] I think Jersey Jack has great momentum

[16:07] going into the second half of this year.

[16:09] I think CGC is gonna make some moves that are interesting,

[16:12] more to come on that on a future show.

[16:15] I think Spooky Pinball's got some huge themes

[16:18] that are gonna make their older themes less desirable.

[16:22] I was on pin side today.

[16:23] I saw for the first time a Rick and Morty

[16:26] like Bloodsucker edition.

[16:27] Normally these games were going for like almost like $2,000

[16:31] more, but now all of a sudden you can go get one

[16:35] for what the game like used to cost.

[16:37] And all of a sudden it's like we're waiting.

[16:40] I think everyone is in a little bit of a wait and see.

[16:43] All of these big rumors, some of them are gonna come true.

[16:47] I think most of them are going to happen.

[16:50] And I think that's where we are at.

[16:53] Nobody's ready to jump on Stern as Stern is wounded.

[16:57] Stern wounded themselves.

[17:00] I think they're out of touch right now.

[17:02] And I think the next four months of pinball

[17:05] are gonna be really interesting

[17:07] because someone's gonna have to make a major move.

[17:10] And if I had to put my money on who it's gonna be

[17:13] over the next four months,

[17:15] who's gonna come out with the game

[17:17] that's gonna have the most wow?

[17:20] Oh my gosh, I didn't see that coming.

[17:22] I think it's gonna be Jersey Jack.

[17:24] Do you think I'm right?

[17:25] Who do you think it's gonna come from?

[17:27] Hit me up at canadepinball at gmail.com

[17:29] and I will read your responses on the next episode

[17:33] of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[17:35] Canada out.

[17:35] We tried for something to hold.

[17:37] Don't wanna not a man.

[17:39] Hey, when you're not on time.

[17:41] You're out of touch.

[17:43] You're out of time.

[17:45] You're out of time.

[17:47] You're out of time.

[17:49] Yeah, for me, I'm not out of now.

[17:54] We journaled.

[17:58] We tried, tried, tried.

[18:00] We tried, tried, tried.

[18:05] You're out of touch.
