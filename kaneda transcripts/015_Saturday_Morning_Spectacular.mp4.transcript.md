[00:00] All right, we're live.

[00:05] Let me get this camera a little cleaner.

[00:15] Oh, it's a very...

[00:21] Oh, welcome to the garage of Canada.

[00:25] Where we talk, pinball.

[00:30] How's everybody doing?

[00:32] I'm in like a...

[00:34] Finally, Brian's in the house.

[00:36] We got Robert.

[00:37] We got Charles.

[00:39] Who else we got in the house right now?

[00:42] Apolline.

[00:43] Morning, everybody.

[00:46] Morning.

[00:47] Brian.

[00:48] Robert.

[00:49] Causes in the house.

[00:51] This is going to be a fun one.

[00:53] There's a lot to talk about.

[00:55] We're finally getting, right?

[00:57] Right at the precipice of all this new stuff

[01:01] that we've been waiting for ever for.

[01:03] Harry Potter.

[01:05] Predator.

[01:07] King Kong.

[01:09] People having play fields chipping again.

[01:12] Stern can't put washers in a game that would help the play fields.

[01:17] Again, we all know these games aren't play tested.

[01:20] They're not.

[01:21] Like they're rushed to customers before you know what the quality is on anything these days.

[01:27] You have paid in full.

[01:29] I mean, that's just the way it goes.

[01:31] And your warranty is not going to cover anything.

[01:34] So you got to just cross your fingers that you're not going to get a dud.

[01:39] What's everybody feeling like?

[01:41] You guys feeling good?

[01:43] Let's get this link over to the Facebook page.

[01:46] Let's get people joining.

[01:48] We're going to look at Harry Potter.

[01:50] Let's get that going.

[01:52] Here we'll go naps arcade.

[01:56] Jason has the video.

[01:58] We're going to watch it.

[02:00] I'm going to watch it together.

[02:05] Yeah.

[02:12] Watch it in there.

[02:14] In use the Harry Potter.

[02:17] I would have liked a little bit of the.

[02:22] And intro music to Harry Potter.

[02:24] But yeah, you know, whatever.

[02:26] They're going to have it.

[02:27] This game is going to have the Harry Potter theme song people.

[02:29] They've got everything.

[02:30] It's not going to not have that.

[02:35] But I'm just we're going to talk all about it because this is going to be mostly about Potter and predator.

[02:41] The launch of these two games.

[02:43] The marketing of these two games.

[02:46] The vibes around these two games.

[02:48] How I think they're going to do.

[02:50] You know, look, I was a little overly strident yesterday.

[02:54] Maybe it was the tequila talking.

[02:57] Maybe it was just the annoying weight for both of these games.

[03:01] But it's just time to get them both out.

[03:05] And I feel like everybody feels that way about both games.

[03:08] I mean, that's where we're at.

[03:09] Everybody's just hired of the weight that teases.

[03:12] At least Jersey Jack gave us a date.

[03:15] They give us a date.

[03:16] Thank you.

[03:17] Now we can all plan our weeks around this game and this launch.

[03:22] That's all we've ever asked for.

[03:24] It's going to be June 5th.

[03:26] The same day in Nintendo Switch 2 comes out.

[03:30] We'll talk about whether or not we think that's an issue.

[03:35] And yeah, we're heading right on June tomorrow.

[03:38] It is May 31st.

[03:40] And we're in summer now.

[03:42] Right?

[03:43] Summer Fridays.

[03:45] Economies like, well, who knows tariffs?

[03:48] Who knows?

[03:49] Everyone's sort of outside more often.

[03:52] Your kids are doing sports and activities.

[03:55] And you're going to have to ask yourself.

[04:00] You know, I'm looking at guns and roses.

[04:03] Collector's edition is now an $8,000 game.

[04:06] Man, what happened?

[04:07] Right?

[04:08] It's $4,000, $4,250 loss now.

[04:15] It's crazy, right?

[04:17] Some people paid $18,19 for that game when it first came out.

[04:21] I'm just like, I'm just getting to this point gang.

[04:25] And maybe it's because I'm just getting nervous about everything happening in the world.

[04:28] I'm getting a little nervous.

[04:29] I'm getting a little nervous.

[04:30] I have to be honest.

[04:31] Like, I am.

[04:34] My company was acquired and hasn't gone through yet.

[04:37] I'm nervous about my job, my career.

[04:40] I think the whole industry is nervous.

[04:41] It's not just me sharing this feeling.

[04:43] There is a lot of cost cutting going on.

[04:46] A lot of different industries are feeling it.

[04:50] Sterns feeling it.

[04:52] Right?

[04:53] And so when you're a decent salary at a company and you get nervous, you get nervous.

[05:01] And now look, the thing about life.

[05:06] It is whatever will be will be.

[05:09] I've been like, go three times in my career from jobs.

[05:14] From whether they're just like lost a big client and the company's downsized or it wasn't the right fit.

[05:21] It just, it happens.

[05:23] You know, they're jobs.

[05:24] Some jobs work out some, some jobs don't.

[05:26] But my point is this.

[05:28] The point I want to make is this.

[05:30] It's really sometimes hard for me personally.

[05:35] To look at these $15,000 toys.

[05:39] And feel like, you know, I shouldn't be doing that.

[05:45] Not if there's uncertainty in my career and my livelihood.

[05:50] It's like, I've got money saved up to make it, you know, but not to retire yet.

[05:56] So, so that's kind of like where I'm at right now is I'm trying to juggle the beautiful feeling of.

[06:04] Having these amazing kids and an amazing wife and amazing town.

[06:08] This community comes alive during this time of year had a lot of fun.

[06:12] And I'm just starting to realize that I don't think my life would be happier.

[06:17] Or I'd be happier or I'd be more.

[06:21] Yeah, you fulfilled if I bought an expensive pinball machine right now.

[06:26] And that's just my predicament.

[06:28] Some of you guys have a lot more money than me.

[06:31] You have a lot more space than me.

[06:33] And your priorities might be different.

[06:35] Your kids might be older.

[06:37] They might be out of college.

[06:39] You might be an empty nester.

[06:41] Everybody's going through their own personal journey in life.

[06:45] I just know me personally.

[06:48] Buying a $15,000 pinball machine just would not do anything for me.

[06:53] It would not.

[06:54] It would not make me wake up in a better mood at all.

[06:58] Yeah, the New York City apartment is sold.

[07:01] David's out.

[07:02] It's out.

[07:03] Okay, so, but you're not here to hear me talk about my fears and anxieties in life.

[07:08] You are here.

[07:10] And you're a subscriber.

[07:11] Most of you to donate this pinball podcast because we want to talk about pinball.

[07:15] We want a distraction, Chris, from all the other anxieties in life.

[07:20] First and foremost, I just want to say before we get this thing going,

[07:23] go nicks tonight, go nicks in Indiana.

[07:28] Can we finally do it?

[07:29] Can we beat this team in Indiana?

[07:33] And can we get to game seven?

[07:35] That's happening tonight.

[07:38] Harry Potter pinball.

[07:39] Now, let's talk about Harry Potter retro jangos here because jangos is in the house.

[07:44] Seemingly the only guy that pinball brothers wants to give any assets to.

[07:48] We're going to talk about that.

[07:50] That strategy.

[07:51] Let's start with Harry Potter.

[07:54] So how many of you think that the way the game was shown for the first time was orchestrated by them.

[08:03] Or was it a mistake?

[08:05] Was it timed to go out like that?

[08:09] I don't know.

[08:11] It feels like that's not how I would do it.

[08:14] It also feels like well, if you're going to tease it and you're going to do something.

[08:19] Just to get everybody excited about the launch date.

[08:24] I think it was probably orchestrated.

[08:28] I think they did that on purpose.

[08:30] I don't think it was a mistake.

[08:33] I don't.

[08:34] They've had the video up on their website.

[08:36] Let's watch the video right now.

[08:37] Let's do that.

[08:38] How about that?

[08:39] Are we good?

[08:40] All right.

[08:41] Let's watch it.

[08:42] Let's watch it together.

[08:44] Do this.

[08:53] All right.

[08:54] Let's see.

[08:56] Full screen.

[09:14] All right.

[09:20] I want to go back and pause on the cabinet.

[09:31] All right.

[09:32] Sorry.

[09:33] Sorry.

[09:34] The screen went blank.

[09:35] I have to like toggle.

[09:36] All right.

[09:37] All right.

[09:38] All right.

[09:40] All right.

[09:42] The screen Goes ahead.

[09:43] Of the foods that food gets.

[09:45] Ok.

[09:46] I'm sorry.

[09:48] Well.

[09:50] I hope the online product.

[09:51] Let's decide when things will decrease.

[09:55] Here is the table,ushima.

[09:56] Can we start up with anything?

[09:59] Food is the gym, please.

[10:01] Food is the gym, so you're going to go over puffs.

[10:03] Food is the gym always going.

[10:06] Food follows the check.

[10:07] Food goes over.

[10:08] I like that. Finally, I always hate it when they don't do the art to take into consideration

[10:16] what's going to be screwed to the cabinet, right? So really, I like that a lot. I think it's

[10:22] framed nicely. Like even in the back right where that back left leg is, look at that. Like the art

[10:27] is silhouetting and contouring where the leg goes. So I like that.

[10:33] It looks too bright for Harry Potter though. But again, this is the wizard edition. I fully

[10:42] expect the other two versions to be more dark, more dramatic. But this is basically their pro

[10:49] version of the game. And if you walk up, this is for operators. This is for a location.

[10:55] If you want the game to telegraph that it's Harry Potter, then this does the job.

[11:04] This definitely does the job. I think what's a little weird about it is it's like

[11:10] it's a collage, but there's not any action happening here that we know of, right? It's like they're

[11:19] all looking to something happening to the left, but nothing's happening to the left. So

[11:26] but again, does the job. It does look a little photoshoppy. It does look a little

[11:34] awkwardly layered. It does feel like they're going for a little bit of how like

[11:39] Franci would have done a cabinet, but it's not as good as I think Franci would have done.

[11:44] But you know, and then we've got a little glimpse of what's on the the translate below the screen.

[11:52] A little bit of what's happening on the screen. And you know, this is Harry Potter. So hold on,

[12:00] I'm going to I'm going to stop sharing screen because I'm going to go real quick and pull up just so

[12:06] we have it. The predator image from retro Django who's got the exclusive

[12:15] congratulations, Djangoes. I congratulate you. It's great as a pinball content creator every once

[12:21] in a while to get that exclusive info. It's not always going to be me. It's not always going to be

[12:26] Jason now. We'll talk about predator in a little bit. I've reached out to them twice now.

[12:36] I have feelings about their ghosting me on after I've been promoting this pin years.

[12:44] They know how much I love the theme. Yeah, not the exclusive haircut, right? His is much higher

[12:52] than mine. My little half mohawk does not go nearly as high. Okay, so let's talk about Potter.

[13:01] I want to just be candid. It doesn't matter if this game is good or bad or okay or a masterpiece.

[13:10] It doesn't matter. It's they're going to sell 8,000 units of this game.

[13:16] This will be the best selling game in the history of Jersey Jack easily. It will outsell Wizard of

[13:23] Oz. I think it will have half as much in it mechanically as Wizard of Oz, but it'll be twice as easy

[13:30] for them to make. It's also twice as expensive more than twice as much money as Wizard of Oz was,

[13:36] but that was 12 years ago. I think this game is going to be received with a lot of polarizing

[13:48] feedback. I think this game and Jersey Jack in general, there's a division within the community.

[13:56] I don't think a lot of people look at Jersey Jack pins with open minds. I think the Stern Army

[14:02] is rooting against this game. I think Jersey Jack has also lost a lot of its own fan base over the

[14:10] last four releases. And I think that's why I would say 80% of us don't really have much faith

[14:21] that Jersey Jack is going to nail it. You just don't have the faith like you would if it was

[14:27] like Stern and Keith L. Winner making it. And they did it to themselves, right? I mean, I'm still

[14:33] in mourning that we only got Toy Story 4. Nobody wanted the Godfather. Nobody wanted Avatar.

[14:40] Elton John's a great shooter, but nobody really wanted that theme really when you think about it.

[14:45] So this is it, right? This is it. This is the biggest IP they've ever had. It is the third biggest

[14:56] IP in the history of Pimball. Number one being, I'm going to say number one is Star Wars,

[15:03] then probably Avatar, then Harry Potter. Maybe Potter is below Star Wars. Maybe Avatar is

[15:11] further down the list in terms of most valuable IPs. Box off is numbers. It would be probably

[15:17] Avatar first, but but this is up there, right? This is a huge mega theme. It's definitely some,

[15:24] no, Beatles is not, it doesn't work. No, wait, it's like Beatles IP is not as valuable as Pokemon

[15:31] or Star Wars. Like Beatles are not selling like merch the way Star Wars does doesn't have movies,

[15:40] TV shows, like Beatles is a big music catalog for sure, but it's not one of the biggest IPs. I

[15:46] mean, heck, Beatles didn't ever even sold out, bro. So like, no, no, no, no. So the game's going

[15:56] to sell regardless, right? The game coming out, the game coming out on the same day as Nintendo

[16:02] Switch 2 doesn't, doesn't do anything. That that only impacts rare hero, Greg Colton, and like

[16:09] four other dudes who are also buying Nintendo Switch on June 5th. Yeah, like I want an Nintendo

[16:17] Switch as well. I didn't get one on the pre-order. It was like annoying trying to pre-order it,

[16:22] and I'm not going to go at midnight. I'll just, I don't know, I'll pay $100 more and just get one

[16:26] off eBay. I don't, you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm not going to take crazy time away from my life

[16:35] to save $100, you know, to spend $450. I'd rather spend $550 and just get it from a scalper. I don't

[16:40] care. Like, I really don't care. I go get a couple drinks and a lobster roll, and I'm spending a

[16:46] buck 30, you know, it happens like every week. So I think that this game is going to sell.

[16:52] I think it's going to be a moment, right, for Jersey Jack. And the reason why

[16:58] I hope it's not, but I think it could potentially, just from a brand and a reputation

[17:04] standpoint, it might be their kiss of death. And the reason why I say that is not that I don't

[17:09] think it's going to commercially do well for them. I just, what I want for Eric and Jack and Ken

[17:18] and Brett and Leonard, I just want them to have a masterpiece. You know, I want them to have a game

[17:27] like Godzilla. I want them to have a game that just universally, everyone's like, yeah, it's

[17:34] really cool. It's really fun. They nailed it. You know, every time I walk up to it, I want to play

[17:41] another game. It's got fun, Max. It's got toys. It's got that world under glass that you just

[17:48] love looking at every time you walk up to the game. I just, I want that for them. And I know my

[17:54] podcast yesterday was like more strident. And I'm, it was probably too strident, you know, me,

[18:00] I get, I get a little boozy and I get a little, I get edgy. I get edgy. I get a little angry.

[18:05] You know me, Kenyat is not like a, sometimes I'm a happy drunk. It's a 50, 50 thing. It was a long

[18:12] work week. I was like tired and I just, I'm tired of waiting for Harry Potter. But I do want these

[18:18] guys to be very successful with the launch of this game. I don't know if media is going to get

[18:23] invited to go there to play it. I'd never got to follow up. They initially, like texted me,

[18:29] Kenyat's to have you over to play it. But then I never heard back. And I think their launch plans

[18:35] shift it. But I, and I'm, they're, they're probably just like we don't even need to bring the media in.

[18:43] It wasn't a drunk show. It was a podcast. And Retro Django, Django, you're not a pot. You're not a

[18:47] subscriber. Come on, man. Subscribe. Subscribe, you know, I, I, I will, here's it. Retro Django,

[18:55] and you know, you know this man. I'll subscribe to your stuff. But it's just your, your, your,

[19:00] your, you know, Don's just got to accept a, a, a truce or a ceasefire. He still refuses to like

[19:07] shake hands with Kadehada. Like I don't get it. Like Don, it's okay. We're, we're both now stuck

[19:14] doing Facebook lives with backwards stuff all over our, our, our clothing because you can't flip

[19:22] the mirror around on Facebook lives. It makes watching any Facebook lives. This why don't do

[19:27] any Facebook lives really anymore because I just think it's annoying to watch. You can't turn it

[19:31] around. It's like they don't want you to do Facebook lives. I don't know what it is. I don't know

[19:35] what, what the deal is. You got, you, you're back. You're back. You're un, you're unblocked brother.

[19:41] You're unblocked. Dust off that five bucks. Um, okay. So the thing is this. What do you guys think?

[19:51] Do you think that Harry Potter is going to be loaded? Let's, let's, let me ask you guys questions

[19:56] and let's just, I want to read your responses. Do you think Harry Potter is going to be loaded

[20:04] like a dialed in or a, a hobbit or a wizard of Oz or a pirates? Okay. So Kyle says no. I don't.

[20:13] Dave Sanders says no. Wow. Two, two empty games, Baron Games. Why do we have so little

[20:20] faith that they'll load this game up? It needs to be says someone Wayne says no. Robert Castle says no.

[20:28] Brian says load it like a Stern pro. Wow. Load it with lights. Yeah. John Gallo. I kind of feel

[20:37] like it's going to be a light show and then some, look, this game, this game, this game needs to

[20:44] have a big sculpted Hogwarts castle, right? In the game. Like that needs to be in the game.

[20:50] There needs to be a quidditch, uh, wire form going around the whole world of Hogwarts. All

[20:58] us. Steve Richie's hyper drive. It's right there. Just yank it. I mean, Richie basically copied all

[21:05] his old layouts for Elton John. Why not bring the most fun mech from Star Wars and put it in the

[21:10] Harry Potter and make it more usable. That's the one thing I hate about Star Wars. Why let no,

[21:16] no, actually, it's not true. I hate a lot about Star Wars. But the fact that it's so hard to get

[21:21] into the hyper drive fun is stupid. It's every other game you should be up there. Okay.

[21:29] Yeah. I mean, every operator is going to buy Harry Potter. I mean, it's just like stupid. You

[21:33] want to make money or an operator. I mean, come on. You're going to make way more money on a

[21:37] $10,000 Harry Potter than you are going to make on a King Kong, on a Venom, on a John Wick.

[21:46] So I like literally the things I want to see in this game. I want to see the quidditch. I want to

[21:52] see magic wands. I want to see magnets. I want to see battles. I want to see creating spells.

[22:02] You know what would be amazing? And I wish they would do this for a home mode. Is if they put a

[22:08] microphone in the game and you could actually cast a spell by talking to the machine. What's that?

[22:17] I don't know the Harry Potter is Spirios. So blah blah blah. Can you know, so blah blah blah blah,

[22:23] but whatever it is, you know, you can someone here must know it. What's that thing they say in one

[22:27] of the movies? A Trino's Patrottas. I have no idea what it is, but you know, you get the point.

[22:33] You get the point. I hope it's not Rainbow, Rainbow Puk. Midlife is crisis. Yeah, pretty much. Pretty

[22:42] much. All right. So Harry Potter, it's going to do well. It's going to do really well. They've

[22:50] four to 500 Harry Potter's already in box ready to ship out. I don't believe that, Jen. There's no way.

[22:56] No way. Maybe. I hope so. I heard they're all going to be CE's first that go out because they're

[23:01] going to say the artwork needed to be changed. Supposedly, I broke this rumor a while ago that

[23:08] there's going to be a moving staircase. So you're going to have, I think that's going to be cool.

[23:12] I think the staircase might move and that might take you to one upper play field and then take

[23:17] you to the other upper play field. I could see that being a really neat feature in the game. The

[23:21] only thing I'm trying to think about though is like, I hope there's not like a big staircase,

[23:26] like in the middle of the game. And that's the main mech of just getting you back and forth to

[23:31] two upper play fields. Because I don't know, like that just feels like, like that would just get

[23:36] old over time. You can just have two ramps and have a much more satisfying toy, but we shall see.

[23:43] Isn't there a North East West game show? Yeah, there's something. Look, the game's coming out next

[23:50] weekend. June 5th. So distributors are going to get this game probably next weekend, maybe sooner.

[23:59] So I think we're going to get a lot of hands on time. What's also fun is we're going to get that

[24:04] $100,000 highly polished 22 minute video that Jersey Jack is going to make. They do a good

[24:12] job of releasing a launch video that really goes in depth into the game is high quality.

[24:21] They did it with Avatar. They almost fooled us with Avatar. Remember, they almost fooled us with

[24:27] that video with the, but they brought in extra black lights and they almost fooled us when Mark

[24:34] side in talks about the game as if there's actually toys in it. And he's like, oh yeah,

[24:39] then the Colonel toy is like, is that toy, bro? It's not a toy. There are no toys in Avatar. There

[24:46] is nothing mechanically that interacts with the ball in that game. That's a toy. So to stop saying

[24:53] that word, there's nothing. Cake topper company. Remember, people, they put cake toppers into a story.

[25:01] Cake toppers. The scram. Oh my God. That weird shrimp suit, whatever, like take the most obscure

[25:11] thing from the movie and make it one of the main features. All right. So look, here's the thing.

[25:20] We got to wait just five days. I can do it. You can do it. We can do it. Let's go on to Predator.

[25:27] Okay. Predator pinball pinball brothers, tease in this game.

[25:31] Django is just shared an image of the left in lane. Stick around. Not sure why the post

[25:41] is surrounded by bullets that look like lipstick. Not sure about that art, bro. It looks like it's

[25:48] everything I feared. It's like flat plastic jungle. I want to see more sculpts of a jungle. I'm a

[25:55] little nervous. I'm very nervous. It's pinball brothers. I will say I'm annoyed that they have

[26:02] yet to get back to me. They got back to me the first time like a week ago and have since now

[26:09] ignored every single one of my emails. And like, I just get to say this. Like, Jason Napp,

[26:16] I talked to him today. He's too. He's like, they haven't given me anything. Like, why aren't you

[26:22] giving everybody a little bit of something like, I'm glad Django's got that image, but give

[26:27] something to Canada, give something to carry, give something to Jason. Like, it only benefits

[26:35] your company to have the give something to Zach, right? It only benefits your company to have

[26:42] the top, let's say the retro Ralph should have something. You know what I'm saying? Give the top

[26:47] 10 content creators each something exclusively to share with their audiences to get them excited.

[26:56] You know, they're just using one. You're just using one. Yeah. And that's it. Like, you know,

[27:03] I don't, I get that Jeng is over there in Europe, but like, man, it doesn't require you to be in

[27:08] Europe to send an email. I think these guys are going to be in trouble with the tariffs. We're

[27:13] going to talk about this when we talk about Dutch today, but man, it's, it's not looking good for

[27:17] anybody shipping games from Europe. They can't get those Alice is over because of 50%

[27:22] tear of potential. If they ship it and it takes, they see, they're not sure. Like, whether or not,

[27:30] they ship on a day when the tariffs are 10%, but if it lands in America when the tariffs are

[27:35] 50%, they have to pay that to get the games out of customs. Not good. Look, I, I prefer predator

[27:46] over Harry Potter. I wish Jersey Jack or Stern was making predator. I just want to see the game,

[27:53] though. I want to see the game. I'm tired of all these teases, red polo shirts, gym hoppers,

[28:02] mailbox. It's just like, and they still don't have a release date. This is my issue. It's like,

[28:09] it's just like, you know, just Jeng is telling everybody, oh, it's coming shortly. What is it?

[28:13] Like, what? Just tell us. If it's June 12th, the day predator came out, tell us now they're about

[28:21] to get destroyed by Harry Potter. And I mean, it's like, you got to be, you got to have your head

[28:26] examined to release your game now. The same exact time that Jersey Jack is releasing the biggest

[28:33] IP in the last, what is it? Like the last six years of pinball. When did Star Wars come out?

[28:41] Like, when did Star Wars, Steve Richie came out? This is the biggest IP since then. It's going

[28:48] to be better than that game. It's good. Like, okay, so this is, you've got eight years and you're

[28:57] releasing your game. You're releasing your game on top of the biggest IP game. Stupid. Now,

[29:07] look, I get it's boutique. I get they only need to sell like a thousand or whatever they're going

[29:11] to say the numbers, but then start, then just show the game before Harry Potter. Because,

[29:18] because I'm going to be candid gang. If I love what I see with Harry Potter and there's only a

[29:24] thousand CEs, I'm going to, I'm going to get one. But only if there's a thousand CEs, I'm not

[29:30] going in on this order as many as you want. No, if they do the unlimited C E window, I'm out.

[29:38] I'm not, it doesn't mean I'm never going to get the game. I'm just not doing it. I mean, I'm not

[29:42] going to get burned. I'm not going to lose five grand. Like, you're going to lose five grand.

[29:47] If they end up making a few thousand CEs, so I'm just not doing it. I'm not doing it. All right,

[29:54] I need to go get a glass. Hold on one second gang. Look at the here. You can look at the

[29:59] the car. Why I go.

[30:47] Man, someone should do a podcast about Himbal and do one thousand ninety five episodes.

[30:57] It should be balanced. It should be objective. It should be

[31:02] no shilling. Oh, wait, it's me. Hey guys, we're back. Okay.

[31:08] All right, let's look at this thing here. Hold on. I forgot to share a screen.

[31:12] I mean, um, blah, blah.

[31:19] All right. Like, like, really, really, jang is you had to put, you had to put your

[31:27] watermark or cry. Just put your little face. I always do the little conator face. It's fine.

[31:33] It's fine. Yeah, the artworks looks terrible. Those, those bullets look terrible.

[31:42] You know, I don't like the bullet. Like, what? I don't understand. Like bullets don't,

[31:48] like, they don't, like, if you're going to show, like, bullets and you're going to show

[31:55] ammo, at least show it like in a normal way. Also, like, why would you put bullets

[32:01] in an area where it's all about a big knife in the scene where he knifes the guy.

[32:06] Throws the knife at the guy. Stick around. So why are you having it? Why isn't there a knife there?

[32:12] It would have made more sense if it was all like Rambo knives surrounding that magnet. But why would

[32:18] you put bullets and not a knife? So I'm just, just seeing this little mistake and weird thing

[32:30] makes me worried. It's a post. It's not a magnet.

[32:36] It's just like, you know, and then I don't know, like, a lot of flat plastics, a lot of screws.

[32:47] It's a wide body game. And yeah, so I know. I'm not, Albert, I feel the same way. I'm not a fan of it.

[33:00] Like, if you're going to get people excited with the teas, this is not it.

[33:06] Like, nothing about this. The plastics are fine. Normal like every other game.

[33:14] Yeah, like, Hans, I don't, I don't know though, man, I just, yeah, like, sure.

[33:21] But it just feels flat. I'm more excited about the retro Django watermark across this. Like,

[33:30] that's the best part of this image. So, yeah, I mean, it's, it's all we got. It's all we got to go on.

[33:46] Well, there's molded plastics, I believe on the Alice in Wonderland slingshots.

[33:57] So, I don't know. I really don't know. Let's talk about, we're going to see, I don't know,

[34:06] I think we're going to see this game a week after Harry Potter. Let's talk about barrels of fun.

[34:11] People are playing Dune. I think people are warming up to Dune. It's definitely a slow burn.

[34:18] But I've been hearing more positivity around the game. And I think what Dune, you know,

[34:25] is why again, they made a mistake. They should have let people know it was going to be Dune

[34:30] well before showing it. They should have got people watching the movies.

[34:34] Because once the initial disappointment wears off, that it's actually the theme you didn't

[34:40] necessarily want. Then you warm up to the game. And I think Dune's got more and more people

[34:48] realizing when they stand over it, that it just looks really nice. It's a really nice looking pin.

[34:57] And the assets are all there. And the music is incredible. The sound is incredible. The scenes

[35:04] from the movie are in it with the voices synced up. They've got everything. So I think Dune is going to,

[35:14] I think what's going to be interesting though, because I do think what Harry Potter ends up

[35:22] becoming is going to determine and basically impact a few hundred games, whether either being

[35:32] sold or not sold for barrels of fun. I really said that in a weird, complicated way. If Harry Potter

[35:39] is amazing, it's going to take sales away from Dune. If it's not, because I think a lot of people

[35:45] are waiting to see everything before they pull the trigger on Kong, Dune, Predator, and Potter,

[35:51] right? Four games. Most of you, if you're smart, you would just wait because if you wait it,

[35:58] all of a sudden you can go get King Kong, Ellie, and Premium now. You're going to be able to get

[36:02] those for less money by the time you want one. You're easily going to be able to get, let's see,

[36:09] I think Dune, you'll have to pay sticker prices. No deals on a Dune yet. They're not making that many.

[36:15] But you'll be able to get whatever you want. You want to have to pay a penny over. And you'll be

[36:21] able to probably play every single one of these games before you even have to make up your mind.

[36:27] That's smart from a consumer standpoint. And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.

[36:35] I think that's what's going to happen. I think if Potter takes people's money, that's going to

[36:40] steal sales away from Dune. I think even more so than Predator. Because I do think that,

[36:48] I think here's my thing about Predator. And I still think Predator is going to sell out if they

[36:51] make only a thousand. I'll tell you why. It's the theme alone. There is enough

[36:57] dudes out there like me and Jenga's who actually grew up as like boys that were into

[37:06] you know, alpha male kind of stuff. I don't understand like who didn't like the Predator movie.

[37:15] Like it is one of the greatest action movies of all time. It is it is that fun of a movie.

[37:23] Everything about it is so awesome. It holds up over time. It's like when you're a young boy who

[37:31] doesn't who didn't want to have like friends like that arms like that dropped in the jungle like

[37:37] that holding the sheen guns like that blasting aliens like like the whole thing. And the one

[37:44] liners and all the humor and all the it's just it's kind of like a perfect action movie.

[37:51] So I don't understand. I don't think they're going to have a hard time selling like you think.

[37:58] Gang believe me if they could sell a thousand labyrinth machines labyrinth.

[38:04] Name me a dude you know like a man's man who's like in the labyrinth bro come on like

[38:12] it's so hard being just like a normal bro these days or or dude like because you're you can't

[38:18] just be that way anymore. It's like it's considered toxic. Oh you got to like labyrinth. You got

[38:23] you you need to like that stuff. No I look I'd rather have Predator than never ending story like I

[38:28] get it I get it but it's come on come on gang like what didn't you grow up wanting to be Luke Skywalker

[38:36] and Maverick and like Arnold and like the Terminator and you know what would you want it to be

[38:42] a character from labyrinth a character from never ending story. I really I don't get it I don't

[38:52] get it I don't know but Jung is maybe we're the dying breed now it's like you know what is what is

[38:58] gender what is masculinity. You know I mean the the the the the do you get you guys remember like

[39:06] five years ago just the the blatant attack on masculinity by like all marketing remember like

[39:13] Gillette's commercial like trying to redefine what a dad is and what being a masculine man is

[39:23] and like trying to indict us for like just normal stuff like you're not allowed to look at a

[39:30] pretty woman anymore you're not allowed to ask for her number you're not allowed to like do this

[39:36] you're not allowed to tell your kid to punch back like it's just like whoa like we went there like

[39:42] we as a society and as a culture like we went there like we were like okay we're gonna now

[39:48] turn over what a man is and allow women to determine what you know what the funny part about all

[39:56] if it was in the end like all the data shows that most women just want it men to act like men again

[40:03] and they were like and then like the most attractive males they were seeing in like pop culture

[40:09] were like Vikings they just want it like men to be men it's just funny to me it's just funny to

[40:16] me look I love women I love men I love I love everybody I really I have friends of every you

[40:24] every lifestyle you could think of I've got friends I New York City like some of you might not be

[40:30] surrounded by everything but I have friends of every religion every race every identity every

[40:36] every lifestyle and in the end it's like I always feel like people are happiest when you just like

[40:42] be honest and let them be themselves it's just the way it goes it's just the way it goes and like you

[40:47] know I just saw the the woman I forget her name she was in sex in the city right she just

[40:53] apologized and she feels embarrassed that the show was too white and it's like what's happening here

[41:02] I was in New York City for 24 years and yeah like people have friends that look like them it's not

[41:08] like you have to apologize and there's nothing wrong with having like certain content and have

[41:15] characters where there's more of like a monochromatic cast like who cares right it's like I don't I don't

[41:21] watch like I don't know like other movies man oh man this would be so much better if there were more

[41:26] like white people in the scene like it's just so stupid so and it's always it's always like the guilt

[41:34] the guilt of privileged I'm just gonna say this it's always the guilt of like privileged white

[41:40] people is driving all of it and they're you got to remember like it's they're they're usually wealthy

[41:46] they're usually white and they're the ones who are driving it it's not everybody else screaming

[41:51] about lack of representation it's the white people anyway gay welcome to Kedatus pinball podcast

[41:57] chats we go off all right let's see let's see what do we want to talk about next

[42:05] um all right you set this up you know all the all that marketing backfired all of it none of it worked

[42:13] knowing none of it worked the only one that worked was Nike and Kong Kaepernick but that was

[42:22] that was just different you know and and I get it and it was at the right time and it was more about

[42:29] you know their their target audience was like urban kids and it worked because they made a move

[42:33] that aligned with what their buying audience wanted to see but you know everybody else failed miserably

[42:40] all right so dune pinball I still don't think they're gonna sell a thousand at this price I don't

[42:48] I think they end up making around 800 of them I don't think they're gonna sell a thousand

[42:56] and I think um I think that's that's just like where we're at like they didn't they Stern can't

[43:03] even sell out of King Kong Ellie let's talk about King Kong um I've been in the thread

[43:08] I've been reading people's own I like the owners club all right because the owners club is like

[43:14] I you gotta do both you gotta go into the hype thread because you're gonna hear from people who have

[43:19] played it but don't own it and then in the owners club you're gonna get a lot more of like positive

[43:26] sentiment because they own the game right but look overall I just think overall

[43:32] people are having a really good time with King Kong I mean you know what I'm saying like it's

[43:36] seemingly is a very great game like it's a great shooter it's got a lot to do more is coming

[43:44] um it's not gonna hold value but that who cares right the reason it's not gonna hold value is

[43:49] the market is saturated uh they every one of them looks the same and it doesn't have like assets

[43:56] the way that a game needs to have to really like be bolted to people's floors that's my issue with

[44:02] Kong still to this day you know I know there's some issues with like the vertical upkick there's some

[44:08] chipping on some playfields by a rail that you need to put a washer down I know there's some like

[44:13] tweaking on the gong I know Stern's working on a fix for that but people are loving the gong shot

[44:18] I've been reading a lot about that people love the gong shot so it does seem like the premium does have

[44:24] a toy in it that is very very satisfying so I think people uh you know are leaning more towards

[44:32] the premium and the le is congele sold out no it's not sold out it'll never be sold out gang it

[44:38] trust me like you're you the reason why kinkong le will never sell out and will will never hold value

[44:44] is again it's like I just said every single unboxing of kinkong I can't even tell you

[44:50] if I'm looking at the unboxing of a pro of premium or an le that's why this game will never

[44:57] hold any collectability they made everyone look the same and huge mistake they should have sandbag

[45:03] the artwork on the pro instead you spend half as much money and you have the same exact looking

[45:09] game as someone you spend twice as much money and everyone's just going to go buy that elite translate

[45:16] from the dude in europe and then they're all going to look exactly the same and once Stern release

[45:20] is the accessory kit with the other you know new side armor and shooter rod for 250 bucks you

[45:27] know what I'm saying expression lighting whatever and I doesn't have expression lighting but you'll be

[45:31] able to get the inner or decals it's going to be the same exact looking game so it's just it's just

[45:37] um it is what it is right and I think you know look we can it's not even about complaining gang when

[45:43] you listen to canate is pinball podcast and if you listen to me right now I'm not like I'm not

[45:47] complaining about the price I'm just warning you what will happen if you buy MSRP at these prices

[45:54] but I don't it is what it is and you know someone has said this in the x-men thread because I was

[45:58] just in that thread and poor x-men owners guys you guys have the worst go ever because if you're an

[46:05] x-man fan you got one of the most creative layouts of all time I said it on my show yesterday I think

[46:11] Jack Danger is as good if not better than Keith L one I do I think it's two games are

[46:18] are like as good if not better than any two games Keith L one has designed they're both just

[46:25] amazing designers all right it doesn't have to be one or the other x-men to me if you love x-men

[46:32] and that design is beautiful the artwork is stunning it is I think one of the nicest looking

[46:38] stern machines of all time which makes the pain of these owners even worse because these people

[46:48] are in pain because they're looking at the most stunning machine ever based on a theme they love

[46:56] with one of the most creative layouts in the history of pinball some of the most satisfying

[47:00] shots in the history pinball some of the coolest toys in the history pinball well maybe not

[47:04] cool but amazing toys really one of the best art packages ever and it's just got the worst

[47:12] software it's like and that's the one thing they can change but it's just everyone's waiting for

[47:17] it to change it's just not like it needs a total overhaul a total they need to start over on the code

[47:26] and I mean that this is not a game where you can just like add some more because what's in it isn't

[47:34] great and they're just not gonna fix it um I just don't think anything will fix it

[47:44] now John Wick is done the problem with stern now is they just they all they care about is keeping the

[47:49] line going that's it the line going is what their biggest concern is and at the speed they're moving

[47:55] and if we get jaws 50th they're just gonna move on they've moved on already they've moved on from

[48:00] X-Men this is not a priority for them so the and the big rumors like Keith L. Win is on Pokemon um

[48:08] and there's no jaws 50th news I mean it's just like it's either gonna happen or it's not

[48:13] and if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen in June so again and it's gonna happen by June 20th

[48:18] which is the actual 50th anniversary of jaws so like look you got Harry Potter June 5th you got

[48:25] Predator June 12th and I think you're gonna get jaws 50th on June 20th and and the the thing

[48:34] that's crazy is I'm hearing that jaws 50th might be limited to 750 units which I don't think

[48:40] that rumor is true and you know why because George Gomez said they would never do an le of a game

[48:46] that already had an le or make more le's now what I hope they don't do is this I hope they don't

[48:52] get a little fuzzy with the language because I think they might be like well we made a thousand jaws

[48:58] at least of that art package and that trim this is different this is 750 anniversary editions of

[49:08] jaws it's not an le they might call them you know 750 anniversary editions not le's not limited editions

[49:16] no no no I don't think they're gonna do it they they know that if they do that and they

[49:21] undercut all the jaws le owners yeah because remember godzilla 70th was supposed to be

[49:29] in le yeah it'll be 750 anniversary premiums you know cause they might do that they might do that

[49:40] and it's like it's it's gonna get I don't know I think Stern's gonna start making some real

[49:46] a desperate moves at times you know I like King Kong's not selling like they needed it too

[49:52] they threw everything at it they invited every single content creator on the planet to get in there

[50:00] they had every arcade one up you know dingleberry you know these like think about like if you make

[50:08] content about arcade one ups like I yeah I'm gonna call you a dingleberry because why would anybody

[50:17] review those like it's just the nobody who's in their arcades who takes any of it seriously like

[50:23] that that's like saying you're a car enthusiast and I'm gonna review like Killian's Power Wheels

[50:29] like you know like a one fourth scale version of the Corvette I'm gonna review like just dingleberries

[50:35] um but you know it's you know it's sad though we're the dingleberries the pinball content creators

[50:42] because we get less views than arcade one of dudes get you know this is probably the smallest

[50:50] niche gaming category if I was into fortnight and I had the percentage of the community following

[51:00] me that I do in pinball I'd be a millionaire I'd be a millionaire I I messed up I messed up I should have

[51:08] gone video game console content creator personality pinball hey hey hey hey these some of these dudes

[51:17] these kids they've got a million subscribers subscribing to their channel for one dollar a month

[51:24] think about that every month making a million bucks

[51:30] yeah tads in the house what did tads say

[51:39] you'd actually have to play fortnight you know yeah it's true I mean Ian knows this like you

[51:44] could be the world's number one pinball podcaster and not even play one game at pinball for a year

[51:49] and that's the beauty or maybe that's just my talent my entertainment skills right I think it's

[51:53] just more my entertainment skills like it's just you know you know what's crazy Ian is like I could

[51:58] not even play a single game at pinball for a year be the world's number one pinball podcaster simply

[52:03] because what I'm saying is still accurate about all these games because in the end like it's all

[52:10] like yeah like nobody wants to hear you talk about the rules sets and how you get to multipliers and

[52:16] what's more interesting that or I just bought a game for $12,000 and the playfields are chipping

[52:21] and what the heck Jersey Jack you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying are you invited no I

[52:27] don't think they sent out an invite did anyone get invited Ian did you get invited Todd did you

[52:34] get did anybody get invited to Jersey Jack yet I have not been I don't know if Jason has I

[52:41] no one said anything to me did anyone else get invited yeah I don't think they I don't think

[52:50] they invited people I don't think they're gonna do a media day I really don't I don't think they

[52:55] need to I think they were going to but I think now with the delay I think they're gonna just let

[53:03] that you know let the internet do its thing it's gonna it's gonna sell without all of our jackasses

[53:08] like playing the game I can't listen to endless driv I don't get why people do podcasts about

[53:16] tournament talk and rules it's just it's killer man I also don't like pinball streams gotta be

[53:23] honest gang I think watching people play pinball is 10 to mount to watching paint dry it is so boring

[53:31] have you ever watched like an IFBA like championship it's it's literally like okay here we go

[53:39] balls going south the north north the south oh look at no he nudged it what a save what a save

[53:47] okay yeah oh go he's got he's got that three times multiplier lit is he gonna hit it oh he just

[53:52] hit it oh he's on three times multiplier all right yo okay now he's gonna just go for those

[53:57] orbit shots okay it's OMG can you like it is like the it's like it's like it's like there is like

[54:12] okay I'm trying to figure out way to say this it is like

[54:16] it is like watching I don't even I don't even have an analogy it's just bad it's just bad

[54:28] and also what's sad to me is when you go to a pinball show have you ever seen these tournament

[58:31] districts are making more in one day then this guy makes all year like he's just he's lost he's lost

[58:44] weird dude what's up everybody you know I had my review at work and it was funny um

[58:53] you know and it was a good review it was a good review I'm I'm I'm a new manager who's good review

[58:59] but she said something it was funny she's like Chris I'm gonna tell you some things that are

[59:03] gonna be hard to hear all right you should tell me stuff and none of it was hard to hear because

[59:09] it's like nobody knows me better than me so you know when you get review that's like oh you know

[59:16] sometimes you like to disregard other people's ideas like yeah that's true like yeah sometimes

[59:22] you don't want to mentor junior talent and you know get them like you know help them but like well

[59:27] I'll put in the effort if I feel like they're they're like they want it right but anyway my point

[59:36] being is none of it was hard to hear all of it was accurate and in the end in the end most important

[59:44] thing are we getting good work executed are the clients happy and are we happy right I mean

[59:52] working in companies is hard though people you know you know it's hard about working in companies

[59:56] not everybody's gonna like you not everybody's good at what they do but you have to kind of

[01:00:03] pretend every day that you like everybody you can have favorites and as you get older and

[01:00:10] you're a leader that pretend amplifies but we're humans like we have our favorites we have the

[01:00:19] people we like to work with we have our favorite clients we have our favorite co-workers and you

[01:00:24] know it's just the way it is it's like one big high school just everyone's older I mean it's

[01:00:29] seriously it's like that's what corporate America's like uh hard to hear

[01:00:39] do do do do do yes it is an 86 jeng is and jeng is

[01:00:46] show you initial deep brother those who know know what's on this car the tofu shop

[01:00:57] um all right what do you guys want to talk about

[01:01:03] right now the corporate jobs I mean we all I love I love where I work I hope I can work there

[01:01:10] as long as I can I I just who knows you know I don't know everybody everybody has a expiration date

[01:01:17] and you never know in corporate America my dad got forced into early retirement the thing is

[01:01:21] when my dad got forced into early retirement and it did depress him but man like the the dude had

[01:01:29] enough to retire like you know that's the difference like I think my dad was 56 and he hasn't had a

[01:01:37] work since I mean he still does stuff and he helps out the community but he is a luck luckily

[01:01:43] he came up during a generation where corporate America gave you a pension gave you dividends

[01:01:50] with because they gave you stock with equity and they gave you know and he did four one K when nobody

[01:01:56] did and he invested his money wisely and the most important thing that my dad always showed me through

[01:02:02] his actions he never um lived above his means it's a key it's the key to life it's the key to life

[01:02:18] we were told no we couldn't have everything and he also didn't just go run and buy a beach house

[01:02:24] and a boat he probably should have he you know the value of that would have been better than like

[01:02:28] stocks um but he never did he's just like I am I'm not gonna extend too far and he's he's my goal

[01:02:38] in life is you become like enough cash flow annually where like you don't have to work again

[01:02:47] it's like he's free like free he doesn't have to put up with anybody's BS that's freedom

[01:02:59] all right we want to look at Pinside prices someone said do we really do you really want to see

[01:03:03] what's for sale let's go let me pull it up Pinside Pinside mark the Pinside Marketplace is really just

[01:03:10] the place where delusional people go to think their game is worth more than it is I'm telling you

[01:03:18] right now here here's a game I would buy transformers Ellie let me show you guys let's look at again

[01:03:28] I'll share a screen in a second hold on

[01:03:29] um

[01:03:34] geez

[01:03:37] let's do let's do $10,000 see what's

[01:03:47] let me let me see if I can just put in limited edition or Ellie

[01:03:52] all right yeah let's just look at the Ellie prices this will be fun all right so we're

[01:03:57] gonna share screen okay there all right all right let's look at Ellie prices because I think

[01:04:10] you know everything else is because it's nice to know because you know where these games started

[01:04:15] and now you know where they're at Venom Ellie 411 this person is not just on cocaine they have

[01:04:23] just ingested so much meth that they think this game is worth 11,000 of Venom Ellie

[01:04:31] I get that it's new and also the most annoying description is new out of box

[01:04:38] what was that mean it's not new out of box it's used the moment you take it out of the box

[01:04:44] it's used there's no such thing as new out of box I don't I don't even get what that means

[01:04:50] then why'd you take it out of the box just to see if it was in there like you didn't trust the name

[01:04:54] Venom on the box doesn't make any sense um Venom Ellie is is an $8,000 game so this is $3,000 over price

[01:05:03] King Kong Ellie 13 that said automate it my boy Mike you know now we're already seeing

[01:05:11] those sell for 12 I think one even went for 11 somewhere same thing automated has got another

[01:05:18] D&D those are not moving at 13 the walking dead Ellie here's someone who knows the remake is coming

[01:05:24] all 11,000 dollars get out of here that Mike too all these are like bikes prices

[01:05:30] you know you see I'm gonna sell it you just can't move a walking dead Ellie because it's like the

[01:05:35] remake is is rumored to come let me move up a little bit hold on a second because we got all right

[01:05:43] all right we got a Metallica remastered Ellie 16 5 I am I don't think you're getting 16 5 from Metallica

[01:05:57] Ellie anymore I think it's like 14 this game I do I think it's a little bit more than an Ellie

[01:06:04] but the demand is dried up you're not getting 16 5 Elvira Ellie 15 get out of town this is

[01:06:10] you remember the Ellie is not even the 40th or the signature edition of Elvira Ellie is

[01:06:17] not worth anywhere near 15 you can get the the nice versions for less than that

[01:06:24] sorry again I got a little stuffy nose just hit me um

[01:06:28] Lebowski 12 4 yeah it's a $1,000 loss that game the game was of 13 5 right from

[01:06:37] from Dutch just goes to show you man everything's losing money

[01:06:43] what's iomoon all right let's see I'm here let's go here here we go so Elton John CE brand new was

[01:06:54] 15 here we have it for 13 all right basically a $2,000 loss and it's still not sold

[01:07:03] a new collector's quality Indiana Jones for 17 9 I mean this is where it just gets like you know

[01:07:12] if you want to I don't know if you want to get 18 for a mass produced game like Indy the problem

[01:07:20] with these like Indies is there are just so many of them out there right and you can get like a

[01:07:26] beat up one for like cheap and with these collectors quality custom ones like this one looks like

[01:07:35] it as black armor that's not how I would want my Indy if I'm going to spend 18 on Indy it's got

[01:07:40] to be fully brass played it it's got to have that that topper from that company that made the gold

[01:07:48] played it you know the gold leaf arc of the covenant another big Lebowski for sale for 12 to

[01:07:56] pirate sea this pirate CE is $37,000 I mean this is just stupid this is so dumb I'll tell you why this

[01:08:06] game this this game is pirate CE was $12,500 now they want more than my the car behind me costs

[01:08:19] I mean just just think about that for a minute I it's stupid it's so dumb King Kong look at this look

[01:08:28] at this guy he's trying to sell his King Kong for 13 five another new out of box what's with this

[01:08:37] guy in Arizona like that doesn't make any sense you can go get new ones from dealers for less money

[01:08:42] these are the people that I just don't get I mean I don't get it because it's it'd be different

[01:08:47] if they're like weren't any dealers with new ones for cheaper that will ship it to your door

[01:08:53] if that if that didn't exist right and there were only used King Kong's then you might pay a

[01:08:59] premium for a local pickup of the game but what what moron out there would buy this game toy story

[01:09:12] 007 triple 07 for 11 five I know I don't know if that's my boy Frank see always gets 007 as his

[01:09:20] games that's not selling bad cats no no see here's here's where it's just like you know you got the

[01:09:36] $2,000 off on a a D&D that's you know you got another D&D like they're not moving you know when

[01:09:47] my friends you bought D&D LE I tried to tell them oh my gosh why would you why are you buying now

[01:09:53] and like there's there's like there's tons of them I want to find some interesting stuff let's see

[01:10:02] you know the same is true for everyone who bought a a avatar C right it was $15,000

[01:10:18] there was still sitting in boxes that distributors for 15,000 here's a scary part gang 12 12 5

[01:10:25] and it's unsolved so it's not worth 12 5 I think I think you're looking at more like 11 for an

[01:10:34] avatar CE now especially with Harry Potter I mean Harry Potter is gonna shave $2,000 off the price

[01:10:40] of every single avatar machine the guardian's LE for 16 they need to crack pipe prices

[01:10:48] James Bond 60 that was a $20,000 pin you're looking at a $7,000 loss there

[01:10:55] it's funny doing this gang doesn't this just make make it so easy not to buy LEs

[01:11:02] I don't understand like how did that person have a guardian's LE for like 16 and this one's for 11

[01:11:11] new unboxed Lebowski with Starry apron oh I love that they're like

[01:11:18] advertising the Boothamberg playfield you know it's like the last builds of the Lebowski's have

[01:11:25] like a better playfield and this guy's taken a loss too another LV lots of LVirus for so these LV

[01:11:32] are guys are smoking crack like they're literally smoking crack at these prices this tronally

[01:11:40] you know with the remake potential looming it's you know it's not the best here's a Ghostbusters 16 5

[01:11:49] Metallica with the top or let's see what this one is going for point being gang is

[01:11:55] whenever I do this I don't know how you guys feel I don't know how you guys feel but whenever I do

[01:12:01] this it makes me not want to buy anything it just you know you're like wow I could see four games

[01:12:08] and it's like $52,000 two games could be $60,000 all I think about when I see this is how

[01:12:17] broken pinballs become do you remember because like all of us remember when

[01:12:23] nothing was like over 10 grand unless it was a truly special game and now it's just like

[01:12:30] everybody just threw everything like this is like this is so stupid it was so easy to get a

[01:12:35] Star Wars Ellie when it came out it was easy wasn't hard to get and Star Wars Ellie when it came

[01:12:40] out was like $80 500 like maybe $89,95 this is why the hobby sucks now for like people coming into it

[01:12:48] because like at $15,000 this stupid it's like the ugliest art package it's a cheap game it looks like

[01:12:56] a $6,000 game not a $10,000 game in this this this jerky wants 15 and then you got this jerk

[01:13:03] at that one's 15 when right below it there's one for 12 not selling like this is what kills me

[01:13:12] about the community are you like a jackass like when you're gonna list something for sale what don't

[01:13:19] you first go see are there any others for sale and if I'm serious about selling my game I can't

[01:13:28] list it for $3,000 more than another one that's for sale that hasn't sold yet

[01:13:35] what is wrong with these people are they not even like checking I don't get it I really don't get it

[01:13:48] see I think I got that stranger thing sold I talked about it I think last week it sold I knew I'd sell it

[01:13:53] but all right gang I think that's gonna be showed today I think it was a good one I walked away

[01:14:02] for some water but anything I miss anything I think the only thing I didn't talk about were the

[01:14:07] tariffs and what it's gonna do to Alice's adventures in Wonderland they've got a container of

[01:14:16] games they just don't know what to do now I don't know how do you how do you get those 50 games to

[01:14:21] America you know on one day the tariffs are 10 percent the next day they're 50 no one's gonna

[01:14:31] pay a 50 percent tariff and like coin takers gonna have to pay the tariff to get the games out of

[01:14:37] customs so I don't know good luck there man good luck there it's why I'm at the back of the Alice

[01:14:49] line I'm at the end of that line I knew this would happen I knew everyone was gonna like get impatient

[01:14:57] and I was just like all right well you know I'll just get it at the back because if I take it I take

[01:15:01] it if I don't I don't and I don't think about it ever I don't really do drunk shows definitely don't
