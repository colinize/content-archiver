[00:00] This week on Canadian Spinball Podcasts, we're going to invite every single pinball podcaster

[00:18] out there to come on the show and talk about pinball podcasting.

[00:22] And we won't invite Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[00:24] The number one pinball podcast in the world.

[00:26] No, I had a laugh at Head to Head Pimball's podcast today because it's like everybody

[00:31] except me and special when lit.

[00:34] Oh, come on, Marty.

[00:36] Come on, it's about time you invite the world's number one pinball podcast on the show.

[00:40] I've sent you nice emails.

[00:41] I've tried to bury the hatchet.

[00:44] Why can't head to head?

[00:46] Get over the fact that Canadian Spinball Podcast exists in the world.

[00:50] Let's do a show together.

[00:52] I've invited them on this show every time they want to come on.

[00:56] I'll roll out the red carpet and we'll have a great pinball conversation.

[01:00] But look, when there's no news, what did I say was going to happen?

[01:04] Pinball podcasters will talk about pinball podcasting, but we're not going to talk about that

[01:08] on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[01:10] What we're going to talk about is I got on my bike and I rode all the way to Brooklyn

[01:15] because I heard that Sunshine Laundromat had a willy-wonk of pinball machine and I've

[01:21] been waiting to jump on the game again.

[01:24] I'm going to read some of your feedback that I've received over the last few days and

[01:28] I want to talk a little bit about that because this is the big news.

[01:31] Willy-wonk has shipped before July 4th.

[01:34] So Jersey Jack has got a game to customers faster than any other game they've ever revealed

[01:40] and released to date, which is very big news.

[01:43] So there's code 1.07 in the game.

[01:47] Now I don't know about you, but I'm confused about code numbers.

[01:52] When we for a minute talk a little bit about what does a code number mean?

[01:58] Now in the world of Stern, 1.0 equals pretty much finished code, right?

[02:05] They consider 1.0 to be like the game's kind of done, but we will continue to polish the

[02:10] game moving forward.

[02:11] So you might see a Stern game gets a 1.03, 1.05, 1.06.

[02:17] OK, Jersey Jack ships willy-wonka with code 1.06 and then allows you to upgrade immediately

[02:25] to code 1.07 and there's a lot of new sounds and speech and other stuff in the game.

[02:31] But I'm just confused as to why there's no standard within the pinball industry in terms

[02:37] of code numbers, right?

[02:39] It's confusing.

[02:40] It's like, you know, in a car, it's like we test zero to 60 and quarter mile and then

[02:47] the numbers indicate how each car performs.

[02:50] But when it comes to pinball code, there's no standard of measurement.

[02:54] And so what does 1.07 mean?

[02:57] What is finished is finished 2.0 is finished 3.0.

[03:01] I think in Jersey Jackland, they get the code even all the way up to like 2.0, I think.

[03:07] I think Hobbit might be a 2.0 something.

[03:09] I don't know, it's really confusing.

[03:11] I also think it's really stupid.

[03:13] I think it's like this marketing decision.

[03:16] Oh, if those guys are saying they have this many miles per gallon, we're going to say

[03:19] we have one more mile per gallon and that means we're better.

[03:22] And I think it's a lot of just that stupid hyperbole and I wish we could have a standardization

[03:28] of codes.

[03:29] OK, so willy-wonka is on 1.07 code and I said to myself, I want to go play it.

[03:34] I want to go play it in an environment in which I can hear it and sunshine is great

[03:38] at this.

[03:39] And so it was a really hot day.

[03:43] I mean, really hot day in New York and I got my bike fixed.

[03:47] One of the tires was flat and I rode all the way over the Williamsburg bridge, all the

[03:53] way to sunshine laundromats, about a 45 minute bike ride and in, in, in, in, soldering.

[03:59] Yeah, just brutal heat, brutal heat and humidity and I locked my bike up and I walk into

[04:04] sunshine and they weren't open yet.

[04:06] The guy wasn't there yet.

[04:07] I got there at like 1210 and they were open at noon.

[04:11] Finally at 1215 he gets there, turns on the games.

[04:14] I'm in there by myself.

[04:16] I mean, there's nobody in there.

[04:17] All the games are turned on and I'm so excited because, uh, Wonka's there in living

[04:22] color and it's 1.07 code and I can't wait to play.

[04:27] I can't wait to play and I take out $10 in quarters because I'm like, I'm going to play

[04:31] this game over and over and over today and I'm going to see, uh, you know, how the game

[04:35] is progressed since I played it at Jersey Jack and I go to put the quarter into the machine

[04:39] and I can't because I notice that there's tape over the coin slot and I'm like, huh,

[04:47] that's interesting.

[04:48] Why is that there?

[04:49] The game is on and, and then all of a sudden, uh, I go to hit the start button because

[04:53] it's blinking and it says trough error.

[04:56] All right.

[04:57] And then I go over to the guy and I said, hey, like, is this work?

[04:59] It's on and he starts shaking the machine violently and he's like, oh, the balls sometimes

[05:04] get stuck in the trough and so he shakes it in.

[05:06] The ball jumps into the shooter lane and then I'm starting to play and I'm like, all

[05:11] right.

[05:12] Well, maybe it works.

[05:13] And so I play a game.

[05:14] I play one game just to, you know, just to make sure it's flipping and then I remove

[05:18] the tape and I put the quarters in and I start a second game and I, and on the second

[05:23] game, once again, the balls got stuck in the trough and they wouldn't load into the shooter

[05:28] lane and the game's broken.

[05:31] So the guy comes over and he's like, well, I guess the tape is there for a reason and

[05:34] he gives me my dollar back and he's trying to shake the machine and I'm like, it's okay.

[05:38] It's okay.

[05:39] So the game is broken and he needs to have a trough worked on over at sunshine.

[05:44] So week one broken.

[05:45] So then I walk over to Pirates of the Caribbean.

[05:47] I'm like, let me just play some pirates.

[05:49] Okay.

[05:50] No one's here.

[05:51] It's good as a home use environment.

[05:52] I put my dollar in and that game starts going into ball search mode.

[05:57] Game is not working.

[05:58] All right.

[05:59] So I don't know about you, but that that was my experience in terms of going on location

[06:04] to play to Jersey Jack machines and I was bummed out.

[06:07] I was bummed out that Willy Wonka in week one, a game that is designed for location play

[06:14] isn't working and look.

[06:17] I'll cut them some slack.

[06:18] You know, there's sometimes games need something worked on out of the box and and sunshine, you

[06:23] know, they get games early on and they just throw them right out onto location and a lot

[06:28] of people go to sunshine.

[06:29] So it is a good place to test the reliability of games because they're going to get played

[06:34] very frequently when you land in that environment.

[06:38] But look, you know, here we are week one game broken already.

[06:42] I'll tell you what games weren't broken.

[06:45] Black Knight was working fine.

[06:46] Star Wars Deadpool.

[06:47] I got this great photo.

[06:49] I'll upload it of Willy Wonka sitting between Deadpool and Star Wars, both of which were

[06:54] working completely fine.

[06:56] So I ended up playing after riding my bike 45 minutes all the way to Brooklyn.

[07:02] I ended up playing mostly Black Knight, Star Wars and Deadpool and some Batman that had

[07:09] there as well.

[07:10] Monsters is gone already.

[07:11] I don't know where that went.

[07:12] They had a Monsters L.E.

[07:13] It's already out of there.

[07:14] I was hoping that October Fest would be there.

[07:16] It's also not there on location.

[07:18] So frustrating, frustrating at the game was not working properly.

[07:25] Now I do have friends who have received their Willy Wonka's and I can't wait for people

[07:29] to upload their reviews of the game and talk about the game.

[07:32] I'll say this.

[07:33] I'm a little curious as to why more people who have received their Willy Wonka's have

[07:39] not shared anything on the game.

[07:42] I mean, the thread is like dead.

[07:43] I keep going back in.

[07:45] Hoping that people who took the library of their Willy Wonka's will be talking about

[07:49] it and giving us their feedback on it.

[07:52] I will say this.

[07:53] In one game I did play or the two games I did play at Sunshine before the game broke,

[07:58] they definitely have some work to do in terms of the sound mixing.

[08:02] A lot of like loud like chimes and bells and you know, it does sound a little bit more

[08:07] like a casino slot machine than it does a pinball game.

[08:11] So I think they're working on that on evening out the sound in the game.

[08:14] But here's the one question.

[08:16] And I brought this up on my last podcast and I want to read some people's feedback because

[08:20] apparently I'm not allowed to talk disparagingly about this game at all.

[08:25] And I want to just for the record say this, when I first played Willy Wonka, the game

[08:31] shot amazing.

[08:32] They told me the code was 0.40 that the code had a long way to go.

[08:38] Now do you believe that within two months we went from 0.40 code to 1.07?

[08:44] Okay.

[08:45] I don't see twice as much game in there as when I played it.

[08:48] But I think the code was pretty far along when I jumped on it.

[08:51] So I focus primarily on the way the game shot, on the lights of the game, on the geometry

[08:58] of the game, on the mechanisms of the game, of the artwork on the game.

[09:01] And everything I saw when I played that game at the very beginning, I really enjoyed.

[09:05] I mean, this game is a dream to shoot.

[09:07] It just is.

[09:08] It's a phenomenal shooter.

[09:11] It's buttery smooth.

[09:13] The lights are really awesome.

[09:14] I'll say this though too.

[09:16] And I think everyone would agree with this.

[09:18] When you play the game in a dark environment, it is really dark.

[09:23] And it's interesting that there's, there needs to be more spotlights in this game if they

[09:27] want to put this game into bars and into locations.

[09:31] And it boggles my mind.

[09:32] Here's what boggles my mind, that these manufacturers don't test the way the games look in a dark environment.

[09:39] Barcaids, location play, not always the brightest overhead lighting, even in your home and in

[09:44] your game room.

[09:45] If you play this game in a dark room, it's, it's brutally dark.

[09:50] And I think people are going to realize that you need a pin stadium light set up to make

[09:56] the game come to life in a dark room.

[09:58] And I hate advocating that pin stadium is needed because it shouldn't be needed.

[10:02] And aren't we at the point now?

[10:04] I don't understand this.

[10:05] Why can't manufacturers all this innovation, all the stuff they're putting in pinball machines?

[10:10] Why is lighting still still piss poor on some

[10:14] many new pinball machines that accompany like pin stadium businesses booming?

[10:20] All they need to do is design a cabinet in which they indent on the sides of the cabinet

[10:25] enough room to put an LED strip and problem solved.

[10:29] I mean, we don't need spotlights anymore.

[10:31] LED strips were not available in the 90s when we were using spotlights left and right.

[10:36] The technology is so cheap.

[10:39] And I'm talking like LED strips, you know how much they are?

[10:42] I mean, pin stadium doesn't want you to know how much they are.

[10:44] They're like five bucks.

[10:46] And people are spending like a hundred plus dollars to get this, you know, pin stadium

[10:50] app when manufacturers could easily incorporate that technology into their games.

[10:55] Can you tell this podcast is not sponsored by pin stadium?

[10:58] Great time to get them.

[10:59] You know, I love it.

[11:01] I love everyone's got like a sponsor now.

[11:03] Nobody sponsors the world's number one pinball podcast.

[11:06] Nobody.

[11:07] I should give my mom the sponsor the show.

[11:08] Anyway.

[11:09] So the game is dark.

[11:10] I certainly need some lighting improvement.

[11:12] All right.

[11:13] So here's the thing.

[11:14] And I have a few friends who have the game and I asked them one simple question, one simple

[11:19] question.

[11:20] And this is a question I want you to ask.

[11:22] This is a question I think anyone who's a front, a fan of Willy Wonka should ask.

[11:26] One simple question.

[11:28] And the question is this, does the game make you feel like you're going through the chocolate

[11:35] factory?

[11:36] Is that like a profound question?

[11:39] This Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory does the pinball machine does playing it make

[11:45] you feel like you're going through the chocolate factory and you know what the answers I got

[11:50] from my friends who own the machine right now was no, it doesn't.

[11:56] They said they think they're taking a different approach in which it's about collecting

[12:00] Wonka bars to exchange them for score.

[12:03] Now, the question I have is this and this is just a question I have for anyone who wants

[12:08] to answer it at JJP, at Joe Katz, you know, all you other pinball podcasters that are

[12:13] out there, there's a good chance you'll be able to interview Joe Katz and maybe Jersey

[12:18] Jack, please ask him this question because I've emailed them this question.

[12:21] I just can't get a straight response.

[12:24] There's one of two things is happening here.

[12:26] They have the rights to those songs and to those scenes from the movie and they decided

[12:32] to go a different approach with the game.

[12:35] They decided not to make the game feel like a mode based journey through the chocolate

[12:40] factory.

[12:41] Okay, and if they made that decision, I'm here to tell you right now on Canatus Pinball

[12:45] Podcasts, if Joe Katz and the design team decided not to do that, I think that was a stupid

[12:52] decision.

[12:53] And maybe you agree, maybe you don't, but you don't take an iconic movie that has all

[12:58] these iconic scenes, has all these iconic songs and decide not to use them in a way that

[13:04] makes you feel like you're recreating the magic from the movie.

[13:08] You just don't do that.

[13:10] So the question I have then is this, if that's what happened, does Joe Katz love Willy

[13:15] Wonka?

[13:16] Is he a huge fan of Willy Wonka or was he just working on the game and assigned to do

[13:22] the coding for this game and he decided to make that decision?

[13:25] Now that's that scenario one, right, that they decided, even though they had the rights

[13:30] to take the game in a different direction.

[13:32] And I'm a little worried that might be the case.

[13:34] The other scenario is very simple.

[13:36] They just don't have the rights to use the clips from the movie with the audio from the

[13:40] film.

[13:41] And if that is the case, all I would like, all I would like, all we deserve is for them

[13:46] just to tell us that is the case.

[13:49] That is what we're up against.

[13:50] They told us that with pirates and guess what happened?

[13:53] People got over it.

[13:54] People enjoyed the game for what it was.

[13:56] So I would just like to know what happened, how, why is Willy Wonka Pinball developing

[14:02] this way?

[14:03] And I think it's a fair question to ask.

[14:05] And the reason why I started this podcast with everything is awesome.

[14:08] I think some of you are just annoyed that I even asked these questions.

[14:11] But why?

[14:12] Why don't more people ask these questions?

[14:15] I just can handle over your money and just see if the game becomes what you wanted to

[14:20] be after you bought it?

[14:21] Why?

[14:22] Did it so silly?

[14:23] All right.

[14:24] And so I've struggled.

[14:26] I've struggled with this because you know I love the way this game shoots and I love

[14:30] Willy Wonka and I want this game to be awesome.

[14:33] And I think it's just a code issue.

[14:34] I really do.

[14:35] I think code makes or breaks this game more than anything.

[14:38] I'm willing to get over you know some of the issues people have raised about the

[14:42] mechs in the game and how they don't reflect the way those items are in the movie.

[14:46] I'm willing to get over that because I still think the game is gorgeous to stand over.

[14:50] And I still think the game is so much fun to shoot.

[14:52] I think it has much more going for it than working against it.

[14:56] Now let me read something that someone wrote on my last podcast.

[14:59] This is from J. Sebastian.

[15:01] He writes, man, you're all over the place.

[15:04] You don't get it.

[15:05] Do you?

[15:06] You have a duty.

[15:08] It's an implicit duty.

[15:09] But still you can't be hot and then cold.

[15:12] It pisses people off and discredits your opinion.

[15:16] You could just say quiet.

[15:18] Just stay quiet or be very short about changing your mind.

[15:22] Also, you use Pirate of the Caribbean off to talk about IP assets or lack of on Wonka.

[15:28] You forgot how you savaged the game about not having assets.

[15:32] Sheeshman, you're like a 15 year old.

[15:35] You're hot.

[15:36] You're cold.

[15:37] Well, let me tell you something, J. Sebastian.

[15:38] And I wrote back then and I said, look, man, I can do whatever I want.

[15:42] Here's why.

[15:43] It's my show.

[15:44] And if I'm not allowed, if I'm not allowed to change my opinion about a game, that's

[15:50] ridiculous.

[15:51] I'll tell you why, J. Sebastian.

[15:53] It's also ridiculous that yeah, I savagely like discredited Pirate of the Caribbean for

[15:58] the lack of assets.

[15:59] I thought it was a shitty deal.

[16:00] Guess who else thought it was a shitty deal?

[16:02] Jersey Jack Pimbal thought it was a shitty deal, which is why they went back to renegotiate

[16:06] the Toy Story assets.

[16:08] So if we all just shut up and just accept it what we got from them on the assets with

[16:14] pirates, they would not have gone and renegotiated the Toy Story because we complained they're going

[16:20] to make it better.

[16:22] And here's the thing too with pirates.

[16:23] Read the reviews now.

[16:25] Go on Pinside, read the Pirates of the Caribbean reviews.

[16:28] That game is getting like glowing reviews from owners who say the game is like amazing

[16:33] and awesome.

[16:34] And that's great.

[16:35] And I can't wait to play one properly in a home use environment.

[16:39] Now if you're telling me I can't change my mind on Wanka, why?

[16:44] Why can't I?

[16:45] Should I not?

[16:46] I love that he's like, stay quiet on it.

[16:48] Stay quiet.

[16:49] Okay.

[16:50] I have a Pimbal podcast.

[16:51] And what would I do every day or every week when I want to Pimbal podcast?

[16:54] If I don't speak my mind about how I feel on a game.

[16:58] So I'm like a 15 year old.

[16:59] I would love to see a 15 year old capable of delivering 364 Pimbal podcasts.

[17:05] That is one per cautious child.

[17:07] All right.

[17:08] So look, have I flipped flop on a game?

[17:10] Sure I have.

[17:11] Have I done it in the past?

[17:12] Absolutely.

[17:13] Batman 66.

[17:14] I used to say it's one of the worst games ever.

[17:16] It's now one that turns greatest games of all time.

[17:19] The reason why opinions change in Pimbal, Jay Sebastian, is simple.

[17:25] It's because manufacturers show us products before they're done, before they're complete.

[17:32] Name me another $9000 to $10,000 toy that customers buy before it's finished.

[17:37] All right.

[17:38] It's stupid.

[17:39] Dubai, I watch without all the mechanisms in it.

[17:41] Oh, I hope it tells time properly one day.

[17:44] Right?

[17:45] Dubai is skateboard with three wheels.

[17:46] Hey, I can't wait to the manufacturer finishes that fourth wheel.

[17:50] It's stupid.

[17:51] The notion that we are all guinea pigs with these games that we give manufacturers all this

[17:57] money.

[17:58] And then we have to make up our mind on a game.

[18:00] Often times before we even get to play it because Stern Ali sell out before they even

[18:04] ship a single one.

[18:06] Stupid.

[18:07] And then all we get in terms of knowing if the game's going to be great or not are a bunch

[18:10] of streams.

[18:12] Often times the streamers are not really there to give their opinions about the game.

[18:16] There's rarely any pinball reviews that are completely objective.

[18:20] We know that for a fact.

[18:21] Yes, there are some great reviewers out there.

[18:23] Greg and Zach, don't get mad at me.

[18:25] You guys do amazing reviews.

[18:26] All right.

[18:27] Don't take it.

[18:28] I can already see Zach being like, what are you talking about?

[18:30] No, look, it's really hard.

[18:32] It's even hard for them.

[18:34] It's hard for Jack Danger because often times they're asked to review these games before

[18:38] they're done.

[18:40] And they're on the same boat we're in.

[18:42] And so you know, what do you have to wait?

[18:44] A year or two before a game finally becomes great.

[18:46] I mean, Batman is just finally finished after two years.

[18:50] Ridiculous.

[18:51] There's still no Star Wars top.

[18:53] Or she just talked about the Star Wars top right now.

[18:55] By the way, it's not out yet.

[18:56] It's been two years.

[18:58] Great job, Stern.

[18:59] You can't put a freaking R2D2 toy from China on top of a game.

[19:03] Great deal with that top.

[19:04] You got the monster's top are out already.

[19:06] Anyway, so you know what I'm saying?

[19:08] It's like, I think flip flopping and changing your opinion about a game is just natural

[19:12] considering the environment of Pimball.

[19:15] All right?

[19:16] And man, why doesn't it feel like you're going to the chocolate factory?

[19:19] So look, here's the deal.

[19:20] I'm not going to belabor this.

[19:22] I'm not going to beat Willy Wonka into the ground.

[19:24] Now I'm not going to savagely abuse the game.

[19:27] I think everyone needs to get time on this game and decide if it's a Pimball machine for

[19:32] them or not.

[19:33] I think the code direction of the game right now is pretty piss poor.

[19:37] I think they should have made it more mode based about going through the chocolate factory.

[19:42] That's my opinion.

[19:43] I think they would have had a home run classic had they had taken that approach.

[19:48] All I want from Jersey Jack is to communicate to us why the game is the way it is.

[19:53] And if they decide it to go against, you know, making the game the way the movie feels,

[19:58] then that's on them and we're allowed to critique or criticize that decision.

[20:03] Are we not?

[20:04] So I also heard from someone else, like they have the rights to three or four of the songs.

[20:09] Okay?

[20:10] So where are they?

[20:11] Are they being sung in the game and why aren't they delivered to us the way they are in

[20:15] the movie?

[20:16] And why would you chop it up?

[20:17] Why would you start mashing that up?

[20:19] Why would you do that?

[20:20] I don't understand.

[20:21] It'd be like getting the rights to family opera.

[20:23] We're not going to use the score that Andrew had we're not going to play music of the

[20:27] night or all I ask of you because you know what?

[20:30] It'll get repetitive.

[20:31] I've heard that.

[20:32] I've heard that excuse.

[20:33] I mean, Jack sort of told me that we didn't want it to feel repetitive.

[20:35] Let me explain something.

[20:37] Pimball is repetitive.

[20:39] If by nature it's repetitive toy.

[20:42] It's coded to be repetitive.

[20:44] There's no way around that.

[20:46] But here's the thing.

[20:47] It's okay to be repetitive if you're repeating things that people love.

[20:53] If you're repeating the iconic magical scenes from movies, it's okay.

[20:57] Like when you play Lord the Rings, isn't it repetitive?

[20:59] Like every mode is always the same.

[21:01] You can change the way in which you approach the game.

[21:04] That's where the randomness comes in, right?

[21:06] You give the player the ability to select.

[21:09] What they want to play when they want to play it, that breaks up them and not any of the

[21:13] game, right?

[21:14] You give them a chance.

[21:16] The randomness of the ball.

[21:18] I mean, Pimball is like this great.

[21:19] This is why I love Pimball.

[21:21] It's this dance, this balance between the repetitiveness of the code but also the chaoticness

[21:28] of the game itself and the randomness of the way the ball will go.

[21:32] That's why we love Pimball.

[21:34] But if you remove the magic of the theme from the game or slice and dice it too much and

[21:40] mash it up too much, I think you fail to create what people are really looking for in these

[21:46] games.

[21:47] Maybe you agree, maybe you don't agree, maybe you do.

[21:49] I don't know.

[21:50] I don't know.

[21:51] But I just think it's starting to feel like, I don't know why they went about it this way.

[21:54] So easy to just give people what they want.

[21:58] That's all this Pimball podcast has always been about.

[22:00] Just give the people what they want.

[22:02] We don't have a huge laundry list of things that we want but the things that we do want

[22:07] in a game we want to see for the prices of these games, all right?

[22:10] All right.

[22:11] So man, so that means the following.

[22:13] It means I'm going to just wait and see what people's reviews are.

[22:16] I look forward to seeing people's feedback and we're going to get a lot of your feedback

[22:19] who played the game and I can't wait.

[22:20] I just want, if you've played Willy Wonka, email me at canadapimballadgmail.com or at least

[22:26] right in the pin side thread what your thoughts are on the game.

[22:30] I'm just curious what other people think.

[22:33] It's not just my voice because ultimately the only thing that you should ever do, don't

[22:37] just listen to me go play this stuff.

[22:39] Make up your own mind.

[22:41] I love that people get mad at me because I flip flop.

[22:45] Make up your own mind.

[22:46] What?

[22:47] It's my fault that I hyped you then I got you discouraged on the title.

[22:52] Go play the game.

[22:53] See if it's what you want.

[22:55] Right now the code is not what I want.

[22:56] All right.

[22:57] So speaking, I heard Christopher Franche gave me a shout out at Pintel.

[23:00] Fantastic.

[23:01] I guess there was a discussion he was having there.

[23:03] I heard that he said that I think that designing pinball games is easier than it really is.

[23:09] And I simplify the process of designing a game.

[23:12] Look Chris, I don't really, you know, I don't know how hard or easy it is to design a pinball

[23:18] game.

[23:19] I've never designed one.

[23:20] I do know this.

[23:21] It's not this impossible skill that only a select few group of people can do.

[23:26] Now if you give someone eight hours a day to sort of sit over a play field and figure

[23:33] out how to design a game, I think a lot of engineers out there and a lot of other like

[23:38] graphic artists and designers could figure out how to design a pinball game.

[23:43] Now look, is it an art form?

[23:45] Absolutely.

[23:46] Is it the best designers are in a different level than everyone else?

[23:51] There are good designers.

[23:52] There are bad designers.

[23:53] There are mediocre designers in pinball.

[23:56] Same thing with coders.

[23:58] You know, it's all over the place.

[23:59] So I don't think it's easy, but I also don't think it's this like unobtainable skill set

[24:04] that you have to do for 30 years because I would love to see new designers in the hobby.

[24:09] And I think we have to look no further than Scott Dinesy and Eric over at JJP to realize,

[24:13] look, rookie guys are coming out with really interesting designs.

[24:16] And I think we need more of that.

[24:18] We need more fresh thinking in pinball.

[24:21] You know, when Pat Lawler says like, this is the most innovation you could ever put into

[24:24] a pinball machine in 2019.

[24:26] He's not telling the truth.

[24:29] It's not.

[24:30] Like, there's other things you can do.

[24:32] And I also, I heard there was some like beef between Pat and Eric in terms of, this is

[24:37] just rumors on Pinside, but that Pat wanted nothing to do with Pire to the Caribbean because

[24:41] he saw it was a design nightmare.

[24:43] I don't know if I believe that.

[24:44] I don't, but maybe it's true.

[24:46] Who knows?

[24:47] All right.

[24:48] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[24:50] So we are very close to a new Stern pinball game.

[24:53] Now here's when I think Stern is going to reveal their next pinball machine.

[24:58] Are you waiting for it?

[24:59] Are you ready?

[25:00] They will reveal their next pin, the week of or at Comic Con.

[25:05] Now let's Google when Comic Con is 2019.

[25:08] Now Comic Con San Diego is coming up.

[25:11] I'm just pressing Comic Con.

[25:14] I think it's July, right?

[25:15] Let's see.

[25:16] Do do do.

[25:17] I love when you guys have to hang on while I Google stuff.

[25:19] All right.

[25:20] July 18th through Sunday, July 21st is Comic Con San Diego.

[25:24] So I would expect to see the next Stern machine revealed on that date.

[25:29] Now the good thing about Canadian pinball podcasts putting that date out there in the world,

[25:33] history has shown that Stern pinball hates it when Canadian pinball podcasts predicts

[25:39] anything correctly.

[25:40] So they'll normally adjust the reveal window, just to prove me wrong.

[25:45] They've been doing it for years.

[25:46] It's great.

[25:47] I love it.

[25:48] I love that we get in their heads a little bit.

[25:49] So what do we think it's going to be, Jurassic World?

[25:52] The other title that I think is really interesting that some of you are starting to speculate

[25:56] that I could see happening is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[26:01] Turtles in a half shell, Turtle Power.

[26:03] Right.

[26:04] Why do I think this could be the case?

[26:05] Well, one reason why is one of their marketing guys over there, Jared, is the biggest TMNT

[26:11] fan.

[26:12] So if he's whispered any title into their head, which one would it be?

[26:16] The other thing is Roth Rills, which the sharps are a part of, who make the arcade cabinet

[26:21] for TMNT.

[26:24] We know they have to deal with Nickelodeon.

[26:26] I think it's Nickelodeon on that title.

[26:28] And so the licensing seems like it would be a slam dunk for them to acquire and do.

[26:33] But the question then becomes, is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles still a relevant title

[26:38] in 2019?

[26:39] And would it make a great pinball machine?

[26:42] I'm torn on this one.

[26:44] And part of me says yes, part of me says no.

[26:46] It's still an iconic franchise.

[26:49] We still all remember the four player game from the early 90s in the arcade.

[26:56] But I don't think guys in their 40s and 50s, which is the target audience for pinball.

[27:01] If you even Gary Stern said mid 40s is the target.

[27:04] So our 45 year old men clamoring for a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pinball machine.

[27:10] And I think if you look at it through the lat lens, the answer is no.

[27:13] I also think jaws is like a no too.

[27:15] Like that's not what they want.

[27:17] More and more mid 80s to mid 90s is the sweet spot for all licensing themes for pinball.

[27:24] So give me top gun over in Turtles.

[27:27] Give me karate kid.

[27:28] Give me big trouble.

[27:29] Give me matrix.

[27:31] All right, there's so many more movies I would rather see a pinball based on than that.

[27:34] I'd rather have John Wick than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[27:38] But again, it's a timeless theme.

[27:40] It's been around for decades.

[27:42] And I think if like zombie Eddie did the artwork and it had some really cool stuff going

[27:47] on and be very colorful, that theme song is just attractive.

[27:51] You know, part of what I realized in the arcade this weekend at Sunshine was this is where

[27:56] Stern wins.

[27:57] They just win on theme and theme song.

[28:00] And within the first few minutes, you're hearing the Batman theme.

[28:03] You're hearing the Star Wars theme.

[28:04] You know, you're hearing Ghostbusters.

[28:06] It's just unbelievable to me that if you put the roster of games, that's stirring

[28:12] has available for people.

[28:15] It's just home run after home run after home run when it comes to theme.

[28:19] And that is why they do so well.

[28:21] That is why they are so successful.

[28:23] And that is why Stern pinball has probably 90% of the pinball market.

[28:28] You know, I was hearing from people that are loving October fest and it's great.

[28:32] It's great, but they're not going to sell like a fraction of those compared to like Deadpool.

[28:37] It's just the way it is.

[28:38] It's just the way it is.

[28:39] So do you think Ninja Turtles is coming out?

[28:41] Here's the other thing I heard.

[28:43] And then I got to go.

[28:44] I got to get on a call at 10 a.m.

[28:45] The other thing I heard is that Greg Ferris is doing the artwork for Elvira and I heard

[28:52] it looks amazing.

[28:54] I heard it looks stunning and it looks like a version of like back in the day.

[29:00] So you're going to see a lot of Elvira's cleavage in this game.

[29:05] I also heard that Stern had like two art packages, one with her cleavage and one where they

[29:09] put like lace over her cleavage.

[29:11] So that's going to be interesting if Stern tries to take something like Elvira who her

[29:15] cleavage is her trademark and tries to cover it up in a much more sensitive era that we

[29:22] live in right now.

[29:23] I mean, right?

[29:24] Elvira goes against where the social trend is when it comes to female empowerment.

[29:28] I mean, she's all about like sex cells.

[29:30] Like that's her stick.

[29:32] Will they allow her stick to come out or will you know, I think it would be kind of lame

[29:37] if Stern tries to cover up Elvira.

[29:40] I doubt Cassandra will allow them to do that because that is what it's all about.

[29:45] That is why people love Elvira and it is what it is.

[29:49] I always hate it when we try to like politically correct a just something like Elvira.

[29:55] Let Elvira be cleavage abound.

[29:59] Okay.

[30:00] I also heard the title of the game might be Elvira and the haunted house and that there

[30:06] be like a big castle in the back.

[30:08] Alla medieval, not medieval man is kind of.

[30:11] Yeah, we'll see.

[30:12] I don't know.

[30:13] We'll see what happens.

[30:14] I don't know.

[30:15] Lots to come on that.

[30:16] All right.

[30:17] What else?

[30:18] But that's coming in October.

[30:19] So you don't have to wait.

[30:20] That's definitely happening.

[30:21] Elvira in the haunted house.

[30:23] Can't wait.

[30:24] Kind of like Alice Cooper in the nightmare castle, which are shipping just fine.

[30:27] Everyone's getting their games.

[30:28] They're going to hit all 500 soon.

[30:30] What else is going on?

[30:31] So look, another rumor keeps popping up.

[30:33] I need to even want to talk about this because it's stupid.

[30:36] It's stupid.

[30:37] I did this before.

[30:38] I recorded about this and it's that the big Lebowski continues to be rumored to be coming

[30:45] back.

[30:46] And I keep hearing this from different people and I don't know what to tell you.

[30:49] I hate talking about it because it gives false hope.

[30:53] If it happens, it happens.

[30:54] You know me.

[30:55] If the big Lebowski comes back, I have to have one.

[30:58] It's just such a cool game.

[30:59] It's like to me, it's like the perfect pinball world under glass.

[31:02] But the drama is just ridiculous.

[31:05] I also heard someone whisper in my ear that like, Raza is going to be a little underwhelming

[31:10] considering the hype.

[31:11] What do you think about that?

[31:13] Deep root, I saw they uploaded some artwork from Raza and I took a look at it and I don't

[31:18] understand the strategy.

[31:20] Really, nobody is going to be impressed by artwork at this stage.

[31:25] I mean, the days of, I'm going to show you an art package and get you excited about a

[31:29] pinball machine.

[31:30] John Papadu tried that and that those days are long gone.

[31:35] So Raza, is it going to underwhelmos our expectations too high on the game?

[31:42] How will we respond to Deep root?

[31:44] We know they are going to have to reveal their cards in October and let me tell you something.

[31:48] It's July now, August September, October three months.

[31:53] That finish line is closing in on Deep root like a speeding bullet and they have to know

[32:01] they are going to get one chance to pull the curtain off a game and it has to blow people

[32:06] away.

[32:07] They know that.

[32:08] I heard they are not shipping games internationally.

[32:11] I mean, they are really going in on wowing people in the domestic market and they have talked

[32:16] a lot of talk and whatever they show has to be like better than what we are getting from

[32:21] Stern.

[32:22] It has to be better if not more impressive than Jersey Jack and it has to have some innovation.

[32:29] Here is the silly part.

[32:30] It also apparently according to their own verbiage, it has to cost like very little money,

[32:37] like $5,000 and all this innovation and all this leap forward and all this connectivity.

[32:43] I don't know why they did that to themselves and I always said they spoke a little bit prematurely

[32:49] on what the games are going to cost, how many they are going to make, how impressive and

[32:55] how you know, expectation setting is really important.

[32:59] We saw that with Wonka.

[33:01] So October is coming very quickly for Deep root.

[33:05] So we will see.

[33:06] We will see.

[33:07] I think a lot of people who decide not to take the money and take the games from Deep root

[33:12] are also anxiously awaiting to see if they made the right decision.

[33:15] Would I have taken the money or would I have waited for the games from Deep root?

[33:20] It is hard to tell.

[33:21] It is hard to tell.

[33:22] But I think those people have been abused for so many years that it just made sense to

[33:27] take the money.

[33:28] No, sorry.

[33:29] To take the games.

[33:30] No, most of them are taking the games.

[33:32] They are not taking the money, which is interesting.

[33:34] Anyway, look, I am going to close this podcast on this final note and I just want to just

[33:39] implore all of you out there.

[33:40] Pimbles great.

[33:41] Pimbles fun.

[33:42] Pimbles awesome.

[33:43] This podcast will always exist to try and push manufacturers to give us the most magic

[33:48] we can get in a game.

[33:50] I also think we exist to expose things that are somewhat troubling us and on our mind.

[33:56] I saw someone post on the Jersey Jack thread on Facebook that I missed her negativity.

[34:00] Mr.

[34:01] Come on.

[34:02] I'm not Mr. Negativity.

[34:03] I get down and out on games.

[34:05] Sometimes I call it like it is.

[34:07] If we were always wrong and people didn't agree with what I say on this show, why would

[34:11] anyone listen to just some crazy guy in New York rambling about Pimble?

[34:15] I love Pimble.

[34:16] I know you do too.

[34:17] These companies, they're so close.

[34:19] But sometimes they make compromises on these games that really hurt the game.

[34:25] If history has shown us anything, it's when we do give constructive criticism to these

[34:29] Pimble companies, they'll get better.

[34:31] You best believe if you think the next American Pimble game is going to have crappy artwork

[34:35] again, it's not.

[34:37] They have to have heard the feedback.

[34:38] If you think the animations are going to stay crappy in American Pimble games, they're

[34:42] not.

[34:43] They're listening to the feedback.

[34:44] So feedback is important.

[34:46] And ultimately, when you ask people to spend a lot of money on a non-essential toy, we're

[34:51] allowed to give our opinion about the game.

[34:53] I don't want to live in a world in which everything is awesome because that's boring and everything

[34:57] is not awesome in Pimble.

[34:59] There's a lot of improvement that needs to happen in this hobby to justify where these

[35:04] prices are at.

[35:05] Just remember two things.

[35:08] Remember two things.

[35:10] Lower the rings, fully featured game, $3,700.

[35:15] Go look at Black Knight Pro.

[35:17] Almost twice the price of that game.

[35:19] Go look at it.

[35:21] Number two, you can't make a Willy Wonka Pimble machine that doesn't feel like you're going

[35:27] through the chocolate factory.

[35:29] Everyone have a great day.

[35:30] I'll talk to you soon.

[35:31] When you're part of a team.

[35:38] Woo!

[35:39] Yeah, I'm going to...
