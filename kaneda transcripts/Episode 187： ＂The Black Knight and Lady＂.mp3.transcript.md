[00:00] Welcome to episode 187 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, AmiHos Canada.

[00:21] I have a special podcast for you today.

[00:24] It is an interview with someone we all know very well, the Black Knight, Christopher Thompson

[00:29] and his wealth of pinball knowledge.

[00:31] But on this special episode, Chris brings his girlfriend Carla onto the show to also talk

[00:39] about pinball.

[00:41] And I think all of us out there can relate that when you're obsessed or addicted or a

[00:46] fanatic of pinball that also impacts the people around us.

[00:51] And I think everyone can relate to trying to get other people into the hobby, trying to

[00:55] explain why we love this hobby and exposing them to the hobby.

[01:00] So we're going to hear from Carla and Chris about all of that.

[01:03] I think you're going to enjoy it.

[01:05] It's about an hour and a half.

[01:06] I'm not going to do like news and everything.

[01:08] I'm actually going to put up another podcast after this.

[01:10] So I don't want this to go too long or I'll start to become head to head pinball in

[01:15] a two hour podcast.

[01:16] Oh, speaking of, you should go listen to their last podcast because I joined the show,

[01:23] Marty Ryan and myself, we talk all about what went on in pinball in 2017 and what we expect

[01:29] to happen in 2018.

[01:31] Really, really great episode.

[01:32] I have to say I listen to it and it's their best show to date by far.

[01:36] All right.

[01:37] Enjoy.

[01:38] Mr. Christopher Thompson and Carla and canada talking about pinball.

[01:44] Ladies and gentlemen, in the spirit of the holidays and bringing people together, I want

[01:49] to welcome back to canada's pinball podcast, Chris the black night, but he's got a special

[01:55] guest with him in the room with him.

[01:58] His girlfriend, Carla, welcome to the show.

[02:01] Yep, it's happy holidays.

[02:03] Time from the Washington State pinball stronghold.

[02:06] And I'm joined here today by my girlfriend Carla who on pinside is known as the Rose of

[02:13] Erragone.

[02:14] Hello.

[02:15] Thank you.

[02:16] All right.

[02:17] Well, I'm excited because Carla, I definitely, we hear from Chris all the time.

[02:23] He's an expert.

[02:24] He knows more than sometimes I believe is humanly possible about pinball and its history and

[02:29] where we're going with this hobby.

[02:31] But I'm excited to have a female pinball enthusiast and as Chris was telling me, you're also a

[02:37] collector.

[02:38] Talk to me about that.

[02:39] How did you get into pinball?

[02:40] Right.

[02:41] So, you know, I've been with Chris for about two years now.

[02:45] I didn't know nothing about the hobby prior meeting him, but his passion, his knowledge

[02:51] for pinball is so big that, you know, I start liking it.

[02:56] And now I'm owning my own game.

[02:59] I like to restore games.

[03:01] Everything is, it makes more sense.

[03:03] So I really enjoy the whole thing about owning a game and the artwork is beautiful.

[03:09] Right.

[03:10] Let me ask you a question.

[03:11] So, on date one, does he tell you like, there's something I got to mention.

[03:15] Like, I am really into pinball.

[03:18] Did it come up right away?

[03:19] I'm trying to remember it.

[03:21] I don't know.

[03:22] I know I mentioned I said, I think I said something like, I have some collect, I collect

[03:30] something that some people don't collect or it takes up a lot of room in the house or

[03:34] something like that.

[03:35] Right.

[03:36] And I said, what is that?

[03:37] And he's pinball.

[03:38] I'm like, what is pinball?

[03:39] I didn't know nothing about it.

[03:41] Right.

[03:43] I don't think she was scared off, but like I said, she was kind of more intrigued.

[03:47] Right.

[03:48] So I think from the standpoint, she was just interested to find out what it was about.

[03:53] But I think, well, one thing that you shared, and I know that you want to share with

[03:58] Canada, was what you like to do with videos.

[04:01] I do.

[04:02] I mean, there's so much to do.

[04:04] I really enjoy, you know, when we do the pinball videos, when we do the restoration.

[04:10] I mean, there's so much to do.

[04:12] I think, you know, there should be more, more women in the hobby.

[04:15] There's like the artwork is beautiful.

[04:18] Now, I really enjoy everything.

[04:20] So Chris, how do you, so unique Carla, she doesn't even know anything about pinball.

[04:27] You're obviously like this pinball historian slash, you know, connoisseur.

[04:32] How did you get her into it?

[04:34] Well, you got to go slow.

[04:36] And once a word of advice for somebody that wants a girlfriend that likes pinball is don't

[04:43] blaster in the first like couple of weeks because I've had some experiences in my lifetime.

[04:49] I've dated a few people and it hasn't always ended well.

[04:53] Okay.

[04:54] I had, I just does a joke and Carla knows about this because she's heard it before.

[04:59] But I've had people that I dated and, you know, obviously I have a lot of these machines

[05:04] in my house.

[05:05] I mean, they're all over almost in every room of the house.

[05:09] So I've had people that have come in, seen the machines and done a 180 and walked straight

[05:15] out because they thought I was a giant kid and they never grew up.

[05:20] And I said, well, you know, it's, I've even lost one that said either the machines go

[05:24] or, or I go and I said, well, I guess I'll see you later because they were there before

[05:30] me and if you can't appreciate it for what it is, you can't appreciate a person's, you

[05:35] know, personal passions.

[05:37] Right.

[05:38] What they are, then that probably not the one that for you anyway.

[05:41] Oh, definitely.

[05:42] There's nothing, you know, it's always weird, right?

[05:44] There's nothing.

[05:45] I always think there's nothing cooler than going over someone's house and seeing some sort

[05:49] of collection or something unique that they're sort of passionate about.

[05:52] It's much better than just seeing a bunch of IKEA furniture that means absolutely nothing

[05:57] to them.

[05:58] So, that would be a lot more colorful for sure.

[06:00] No, the thing is that, you know, she's, you know, she can speak for herself, but as you

[06:04] can hear, she's not as much of a player.

[06:08] She likes some of the other aspects there.

[06:10] What I consider to be kind of more on the 201 level when people get interested in things

[06:14] like the restoring and games or collecting artwork, you know, like for her birthday, I

[06:21] got her both Super Mario translates from Gottlieb, the Super Mario brothers and then Super

[06:28] Brothers' mushroom because she likes Super Mario.

[06:31] I know that's kind of strange.

[06:33] Yeah, that's my childhood.

[06:34] But that's what she likes.

[06:36] I still think that theme would be amazing to make it a modern version of a Super Mario

[06:43] Brothers' theme.

[06:44] How do I like it?

[06:45] Well, people underestimate that game was very popular.

[06:47] Super Mario Brothers was a very popular game and it's time even though it's not an adult

[06:52] theme.

[06:53] A lot of people played it and it got played out.

[06:55] So not everything has to be completely tailored to say some way that's in their 30s or 40s

[07:03] or 50s.

[07:05] You know that from the standpoint of the market, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the

[07:09] demographics for everyone.

[07:11] Right.

[07:12] I mean, there has to be a, there's probably a pinball machine for everybody because you

[07:15] know my staying, you know, I think everybody should own a pinball machine or something in

[07:19] their house.

[07:20] I mean, there's got to be something that people like.

[07:22] Right.

[07:23] So Chris and Carla, so you start to get a little bit more of a story.

[07:25] Get into the hobby.

[07:26] Do you teach, how do you teach someone pinball and like share the passion?

[07:32] So did you teach Carla how to play first or do you explain the machines and the mechanism?

[07:38] So what's the, what's step one of getting someone excited?

[07:42] I just, we go ahead.

[07:43] I think about the history of the games.

[07:46] That's what I like, you know, in the artwork.

[07:48] And of course, you know, every time I come to Chris's house, you know, we play, we play

[07:52] something.

[07:53] And, you know, I'm not a great, I'm not a best player, but I have fun.

[07:58] But I really enjoy playing the game when it's beautiful.

[08:03] When it's just like, I can tell Chris, you know, he's, he, look at me, weird.

[08:06] I said, like, oh, that game is so gorgeous.

[08:08] And I'm like, and then he's like, what?

[08:11] And I'm like, yeah, I'm like, well, not used to doing that.

[08:13] I mean, that's not something you hear for somebody saying, wow, I really like this stuff.

[08:17] Like, like, big shot, you know, I really think that that game is sexy.

[08:20] Right.

[08:21] I really enjoy playing that game.

[08:22] So I can see the other side of the hobby.

[08:25] Right.

[08:26] And, you know, I'm not good player.

[08:28] I like more of the restoring and making the game beautiful.

[08:31] But I enjoyed the whole thing.

[08:35] So there is a whole side of this hobby.

[08:37] And I think this side and Carla to your point, I think it, it goes underrepresented on

[08:43] the forums.

[08:44] And that is the aesthetic appeal of Pimbo, right?

[08:47] It's a work of art and that what first draws people into a game is the visual pop that

[08:56] a game has.

[08:57] And then you're right.

[08:58] I asked you.

[08:59] Right.

[09:00] And we sort of went through a period where Pimbo went from being all hand drawn artwork.

[09:04] Then it went through like a rough period of Photoshop.

[09:06] But we're sort of back in this era now where hand drawn artists are becoming the hot

[09:12] commodities, even amongst the new manufacturers.

[09:16] Well, not to forget, remember, God leave him premier in the 90s did the same thing.

[09:21] Like I say, Pimbo is a circle.

[09:24] A lot of times things are tried and it doesn't always work out and then they circle the wagons

[09:29] back the things that have worked in the past.

[09:32] So that's why I give an example.

[09:33] I'm going to give an example because if you think of atrocious or at least some people's

[09:37] opinions of trans-like images like Genesis, you know, some of the photo realistic or

[09:44] Hollywood heat, you know, the Miami Vice Clone.

[09:46] Right.

[09:47] Yeah, some of those were pretty bad.

[09:49] And you know, they obviously even Bollyham Williams tried it for a very short amount of

[09:54] time, but it didn't last.

[09:56] So you're right.

[09:59] I think aesthetically when it comes to artists, I saw, as he mentioned on a podcast recently

[10:04] about who is the best Pimbo artist and a lot of people.

[10:08] I'm not, I wouldn't know.

[10:09] I'm not knocking Christopher Franci or Dirty Donnie or the modern artist.

[10:13] You know, what I call the, you know, John Yosey's of today now reinvented in a different

[10:21] manner by a new generation of artists.

[10:23] That's fine.

[10:24] I don't have any problem with that.

[10:26] Anything that keeps Pimbo alive from the standpoint of interest is a good thing.

[10:31] Right.

[10:32] And, you know, so Carla, what?

[10:36] You have a collection now, Chris was saying.

[10:38] So you have your own games.

[10:39] How does that work in the dynamic of...

[10:42] There you go.

[10:43] The environment.

[10:44] The floor.

[10:45] You know, actually, you know, from seeing the games at Chris's house, I was just like, well,

[10:49] I wanted to own one, but I said, like, I need to learn how to fix it first.

[10:55] I love that.

[10:56] You hear that?

[10:57] This is the first thing she says.

[10:58] You don't want to follow it.

[10:59] No, I don't want to fix it.

[11:01] Right.

[11:02] So you know how to sort her and work on games and all that jazz?

[11:05] Not yet.

[11:06] But we've all been learning that too.

[11:10] But you know, right now, it's just like, just baby steps.

[11:14] But I said, well, I need to know the basics, at least how to fix it if something's wrong.

[11:19] And actually, my first game was bank shot.

[11:22] And we bought it, we cleaned it.

[11:25] I spent a lot of time working on it.

[11:28] So I really enjoy it.

[11:29] I don't know.

[11:30] Remember what bank shot is Chris?

[11:33] I'm Google.

[11:34] I'm Google looking up some of these because as you guys know, we don't really talk about

[11:39] bank shot on Candidates football podcast every day.

[11:42] But I'm looking at it right now.

[11:44] No, but the reason it pops, it should pop is because of Roger Sharp.

[11:48] Right.

[11:49] That's the game that Roger Sharp called the shot.

[11:52] This is the one in front of like was a congress or a 1970.

[11:57] Right.

[11:58] So this is the game.

[11:59] And so, you know, but it was just an opportunity.

[12:02] But as you heard from her, one of the things that impressed me was of course that she wanted

[12:08] to learn how to, it worked.

[12:10] She wanted to know how to make it work and how to fix it before she was willing to buy

[12:14] a game.

[12:15] And she took my advice.

[12:17] In this case, instead of dropping an enormous fortune into a modern game, she took the,

[12:25] what I considered to be the smart route and she went and bought this EM because it's an

[12:29] electron mechanical.

[12:31] And if you can learn how to fix that and your basic skills, you're already off to the

[12:36] races.

[12:37] I mean, are there, are there is not the hardest to fix, right?

[12:41] No, no, no.

[12:42] It's just easiest.

[12:43] Really?

[12:44] So, what, how do you rank, how do you rank difficulty in terms of maintenance with games,

[12:49] in terms of DMD, solid state, EM?

[12:52] Any game from the 90s because of the complexity of toys, unlike the challenges today with

[13:00] the games are based on the electronics as, as you know, if you want to talk about that

[13:05] because of the, the, the, the solid surface mounted device component technology, which

[13:11] makes it difficult to diagnose, especially if a game doesn't have solid diagnostics,

[13:17] meaning from the actual computer itself.

[13:20] But when it comes to complexity, it's always going to be any game that, and Wizard of Oz

[13:26] falls into this category too because of the number of toys.

[13:30] Any game that has a lot of toys and a lot of working parts or another game example that

[13:36] any game that has a lot of optos that are infrared sensors over mechanical cherry switches

[13:43] is going to be a much more difficult to maintain than any electro mechanical game.

[13:49] There are exceptions in the electro mechanical world because a lot of the ballet games that

[13:54] I collect that are Ted Zale games with these zipper flippers, they use the lot of, very

[14:00] advanced features that were complex for their time and still are in comparison to a lot

[14:05] of the stuff that even Stern does today.

[14:08] But those are, those are an anomaly.

[14:10] Right.

[14:11] So any solid state game that had a lot of toys from the 90s like Road Show and even Funhouse

[14:17] with Rudy with its, its face, anything that has a lot of toys is going to be a lot more

[14:22] maintenance intensive just because of things of wear and tear.

[14:26] Something that is simpler, that's why EMs are so good.

[14:30] I mean most of it is, a lot of the stuff is very similar in technology.

[14:36] It isn't necessarily the same in terms of the parts and then they, it's put together,

[14:40] but the technology is still the same.

[14:43] So if you have a score reel, it may be, it may look different, it may, but its operations

[14:49] is still the same.

[14:51] It still works the same.

[14:53] It just might work a little differently based on the way it's put together.

[14:57] But the understanding of the wiring in the circuit theory is the same.

[15:01] You know, they, you still have to have a scoring motor, you still have to have, it's some type

[15:06] of means for doing the switch matrix with relays, but you can follow the, what they call

[15:11] the oil drop test.

[15:12] Yeah, I don't know if you've ever heard that term.

[15:14] That's what they use in the, in the aircraft mechanic world like when I was in the services,

[15:19] you do a, you'd start from the beginning and you'd follow the oil drop through the system.

[15:24] That's the same way you do with electronics.

[15:26] Even though that's not a circuit board.

[15:28] And when they started introducing circuit boards in 1976, all that wiring and all those relays

[15:35] and all this stuff, the guts that you saw in EMs now just disappeared into a transistor.

[15:42] Got you.

[15:43] Which you can't see anymore, which makes it more difficult in itself because you have

[15:47] to have a different set of skills.

[15:50] That's all.

[15:51] These older games are, are parts really hard to find or is it, did the parts not really

[15:57] fail that much?

[15:58] It's more about if, if you're taking a game that's been in a garbage dump or in somebody's

[16:04] warehouse for 30 or 40 years and hasn't been turned on, it could be a challenge, but it

[16:10] also depends on how complete the game is when you get it.

[16:14] I can take an EM pinball machine that hasn't been operated in two decades and make it work

[16:21] within a couple of weeks.

[16:23] Which, and it usually though, but remember when it comes to parts, yeah, some parts can

[16:28] be hard to find, but just like the solid state games of today, some parts have been reproduced

[16:36] and are available and will already end up having to find a donor machine.

[16:41] That's the other option, which isn't anything different from, say, what Stern Games from

[16:46] the White Star did in the 2000s because a lot of games from that area have been parted

[16:50] out to make other games that are still around work.

[16:55] It still happens.

[16:56] Sure.

[16:57] Okay, so, so Carl gets a bank shot.

[17:00] Yep.

[17:01] First game.

[17:02] What, what, what happens there?

[17:04] Do you get bit by the bug or you buy more games?

[17:07] How many you got right now?

[17:08] That was the first thing that she stepped in a part.

[17:12] She's stuck in a part.

[17:14] It, so was it working when you got it or it needed some, needed some love?

[17:18] You know, it, it was working, but it needed a little bit of TLC and I'm a really picky,

[17:23] you know, what's around my house.

[17:24] And then I said, Chris, we need to make it beautiful.

[17:28] This is a, this is a canada, this is a canadaism.

[17:31] Right.

[17:32] It's like I can't, I got it, I got a clean this thing up.

[17:35] It's got to look nice.

[17:36] Of course, you know, I, I have to look at it.

[17:39] You look at it.

[17:40] And then I said, well, we need to paint the cabinet.

[17:42] We need to, you know, make sure that play feels beautiful and clean and shiny.

[17:48] And I said, you know, Chris uses a collector of quality for, for a game.

[17:54] I use jewelry quality.

[17:56] So it's like shiny and like beautiful.

[18:00] So the first thing that I did, well, I moved the play field by myself and of course my

[18:05] arms were bruised.

[18:06] It's such a game apart by herself.

[18:09] Yeah.

[18:10] And he actually just assembled it and took it apart herself and did you help put it back

[18:16] to check?

[18:17] Yeah, put some of it back together because there were some parts that were maybe not in

[18:22] their optimal position.

[18:23] Right.

[18:24] And of course, we had to go to, you know, this store and then by the, the type of the

[18:29] cranked tools because I didn't have any.

[18:32] Right.

[18:33] I got her started.

[18:34] One of the things that you could see, I tried to kind of break her and easy.

[18:36] I didn't try to just have her have both feet in the water at once.

[18:40] Right.

[18:41] But, you know, it was, you know, it was over time.

[18:43] I mean, she didn't rush to buy the game.

[18:46] She took her time.

[18:47] You know, she wanted some help.

[18:49] I have some good friends of mine that are, that work is, you know, dealers, brokers,

[18:53] restores.

[18:54] You know, they can cut her a good deal so she didn't get up, you know, lemon.

[18:59] You know, it's her first experience is the most important.

[19:02] And so I wanted to make sure that she got a good deal that was fair and it wasn't going

[19:07] to give her a lot of problems in the, in the long run.

[19:09] Right.

[19:10] We really enjoyed doing it together.

[19:12] You know, I know that, you know, sometimes we could get a little bit, you know, perfectionist

[19:16] and things.

[19:17] But, you know, overall, we, you know, we enjoy, we enjoy, you know, spending time together.

[19:22] Right.

[19:23] Right.

[19:24] And Pimbo is like working on a machine.

[19:26] It's very social.

[19:27] You know, lots of father, son projects, lots of couples working on stuff, modding the

[19:32] games.

[19:33] So you got this game now.

[19:35] Now I see you figured that out.

[19:37] Yeah.

[19:38] I mean, Brenda like, she helped, she saved me.

[19:42] I didn't say this on my last podcast, but I was pulling my Batman out.

[19:49] I was pulling it back.

[19:50] And the new Stern rail system is effing terrible.

[19:53] Yes, it is.

[19:54] Like the play field, I should not hold right off the rail.

[20:00] And the game fell into the cabinet.

[20:03] And I like had a panic attack.

[20:05] And I had to hold the back up.

[20:07] And I'm screaming to Brenda because she's in the shower.

[20:09] I'm like, big.

[20:11] Gotta come out.

[20:12] And she's like, what the hell?

[20:14] And I'm like, just, just lift the front up and help it lift it up.

[20:18] Yeah, luckily I didn't mess it up.

[20:19] But literally I've seen people pull those play fields out of the railing system.

[20:23] I'm so careful.

[20:24] And it's a locking system.

[20:26] It's, it's terrible.

[20:27] Anyway.

[20:29] So, Carl, I want to talk about, see, you've got this game in here.

[20:32] I want to talk about like women in Pimbo and in the hobby.

[20:35] Because we go, we go.

[20:37] But we see this topic all the time.

[20:39] And it oftentimes, it gets into a little bit of like, it's a boys club on Pinside.

[20:47] And you're on Pinside, right?

[20:49] I am.

[20:50] Yes.

[20:51] And do you, I guess my first question is, too.

[20:54] Hey, baby, Query, you got to laugh at this one.

[20:56] If you weren't aware, they thought she was me.

[20:59] Did you know that?

[21:02] Because her answers were like very long and well informed or.

[21:07] Because she talks to me.

[21:09] Right.

[21:10] They literally they thought, well, this, this is the black night in the sky.

[21:16] Because you know, she's about to handle all the time.

[21:18] So I'm learning, you know, the things that someone told me.

[21:21] She stuff for me, but she, you know, she lived in Vancouver.

[21:25] You know, she has a name that was similar than mine.

[21:27] And I'm, and she's like, I'm not him.

[21:30] But people didn't believe it.

[21:32] And it got to a head and then had to be resolved.

[21:35] So those moderators, without them, there'd be no world stability.

[21:40] It got fixed.

[21:41] It, it, it gets fixed.

[21:43] It just, it had to come to a head.

[21:45] And then people were like, they backed off and they realized, yeah, that's, she's not

[21:49] me.

[21:50] Right.

[21:51] Right.

[21:52] So go ahead now.

[21:53] Yeah.

[21:54] No, I mean, it's like, I mean, Carla, I mean, what's your take when you go into like Pinside

[21:58] and do you ever find it like offensive or you, you don't really care?

[22:02] You know, actually, it was a fence at the beginning, you know, when I first started posting

[22:07] things, you know, people, they were a few people that they were actually making fun of

[22:12] me.

[22:13] And I was just like, oh my god, you know, how rude is that?

[22:17] Right.

[22:18] But you know, there are other ways, you know, I still log in and read about it.

[22:21] I don't post much now.

[22:25] But I do like the Facebook, you know, groups.

[22:27] I do post and then they were being like, wonderful to me.

[22:30] They actually comment and like my pictures and everything.

[22:33] And then you're talking about the, the, the, the, the, uh, owner's groups, right?

[22:37] The owner's group.

[22:38] Yeah.

[22:39] I like it.

[22:40] I think you mentioned it to the owner's group.

[22:41] The, the close groups.

[22:42] Yeah.

[22:43] But Pinside actually, it, you know, it was frustrating for me at one point.

[22:48] And I was just like, well, I can't deal with that.

[22:51] I don't know what worked to you.

[22:54] Okay.

[22:55] They're not nice.

[22:57] Right.

[22:58] Right.

[22:59] Well, it's like, you know, a Pinside, it's like sort of a little bit like you kind of

[23:03] have their wilder to navigate which threads get toxic and which threads are fine.

[23:09] And there's certain threads were, I think the most positive threads are, are, are usually

[23:13] the club threads where people actually own the game and want to help each other.

[23:19] Yeah.

[23:20] It own it and, and work on issues and like, modded and, and talk about playing the game.

[23:25] The speculation threads are where things get really volatile.

[23:29] Well, a lot of the problem is, is that people that are actually knowledgeable of what's

[23:35] going on in the industry don't post.

[23:38] They're not even on Pinside.

[23:39] Right.

[23:40] They just, I mean, they, they, I don't post that much anymore.

[23:44] I mean, I'm on it, but I'm not really there.

[23:46] And it's, it's, it's annoying.

[23:49] I mean, if I was a person, it was a part of industry direct.

[23:54] And, you know, from my contacts, they don't want to post.

[23:58] There's no benefit to them posting because it's just, there, it's just going to be more,

[24:04] you know, a superfluous argumentation.

[24:07] And it doesn't really matter to them.

[24:09] It just doesn't.

[24:10] I mean, it, it, pinnable is a niche industry.

[24:12] You know that.

[24:13] It's, you know, it's hard to make a profit, a, a good solid profit.

[24:18] So a lot of the negative press that might be generated out of some of the speculation

[24:23] is not going to help anybody.

[24:25] Right.

[24:26] So just stay, they just stay away from it or they are too busy.

[24:30] Sure.

[24:31] A lot of these guys are super busy and they have not, do not have time to sit here and

[24:36] play, you know, mind games with somebody else.

[24:39] So that job is left up for whoever else wants to do that.

[24:42] Sure.

[24:43] I'm not interested in it either at all.

[24:45] No.

[24:46] So Carla, what, what is your favorite game from, from just a visual and artistic

[24:53] standpoint that you just loved or you do own it?

[24:58] You know, the first, the first game, I will say, Paragon, that first time that I wanted

[25:05] to Chris has, he had, well, he did, he still have a back glass in the whole way.

[25:10] And I'm like, you know what?

[25:12] I will own that game.

[25:13] I love that game.

[25:15] She got her wish, Chris.

[25:18] I don't know if you knew that, but I posted it with her.

[25:21] She helped me restore it, but I ended up finding, and she was with me.

[25:27] We did a road trip for it.

[25:28] We found a documented home you solely bought in June, sorry, July of 1979, Paragon.

[25:37] Wow.

[25:38] And I can say that game looks gorgeous.

[25:40] 38 years old, never left the same house.

[25:43] And you're the, so you're the second owner?

[25:45] Correct.

[25:47] I, this is the kind of game, you can aided that I aspire to get.

[25:52] That's what I go after.

[25:53] People ask me all the time, they go, how do you find this stuff?

[25:56] I said, well, I mean, some of it's networking, some of it's contacts, some of it's, you

[26:01] know, big game under hat on, but that was the, you know, her dream title.

[26:06] Yes.

[26:07] So we, how did you find this one?

[26:09] You can't, you can't like, you can't find this like white whale and not tell us.

[26:13] Okay.

[26:14] Well, the way this worked is it was twofold.

[26:17] One of my friends down in California told me that there was a family down near, was it

[26:25] Los Angeles?

[26:26] Los Angeles.

[26:27] Los Angeles?

[26:28] That, that had this game and they were looking to sell it.

[26:31] And, and they, so I contacted them directly and they ended up sending me a video.

[26:38] I didn't want this.

[26:39] I needed pictures of the game because you, you know, you never know exactly what you're

[26:43] talking about here.

[26:44] I mean, it could have been a bunch of crap or not, but this, you know, this is one of

[26:48] those little old lady from Pasadena things.

[26:52] And this one was true.

[26:53] It was basically a family that, that they in night, July or July of 1979 had walked into

[27:00] a distributor's office that's no longer there.

[27:03] They're long gone.

[27:05] And they really liked that game for some reason and the husband bought it brand new.

[27:11] In fact, I still have.

[27:12] Yeah, we have the receipt.

[27:13] I have the sales receipt from July of 1979.

[27:17] What did it cost back then?

[27:19] What was it?

[27:20] 1989.

[27:21] I think it was 1980 and that included, well, the delivery was 1995.

[27:28] Which, when you think about it, like that's expensive for 1970.

[27:33] Well, that was, that was the going rate for the game, but that was brand new.

[27:37] I've upcharged from the distributor and, you know, we, I told them that I said I would

[27:44] buy it for $1,900 and you're probably rolling in your grave right now, but, but I said I

[27:50] would buy it for $1,900 unless I was able, because they couldn't open the back box.

[27:56] And I said, if the back glass is near perfect, I'll give you $2,000.

[28:00] Now, the game is worth, obviously, a lot more, but it didn't work.

[28:07] Okay.

[28:08] So that obviously lowers the cost.

[28:10] So we ended up actually taking a flight to Los Angeles, flew down there.

[28:17] I rented a minivan and loaded this thing up with a lot of ass pain because they had it

[28:23] in a pool room back in this minivan and drove it 1,000 miles back to Vancouver, Washington.

[28:30] Wow.

[28:31] And then restored it and it had some problems that CPU had corrosion damage and it had other

[28:37] issues.

[28:38] But, but, you know, yeah, I got it very fair price for it, but at the same time, somebody

[28:43] had to restore it.

[28:44] But here's the kicker.

[28:46] You want the real funny kicker to the story?

[28:48] You ready?

[28:49] I'm waiting.

[28:50] You know, I got to have the punch line, right?

[28:52] Okay.

[28:53] So if you, you probably didn't see it, but I posted pictures of it on Facebook and what

[28:59] was the funniest was I had a before and after picture because this play field was almost

[29:06] as close and nice as a factory play field could be, which is a lot because the problem with

[29:14] paragons is they usually get sunken inserts.

[29:17] They get what's called a dishing.

[29:19] They, it was a manufacturing fault for a valley back then.

[29:24] Right.

[29:25] I got a restoration of the game and I showed a picture of the before and after I, we finished

[29:32] it together, myself and Carla.

[29:34] And the same day, I got a call back from the original owner who wanted to buy the game

[29:41] back for me and Carla couldn't believe it.

[29:44] Right.

[29:45] Wow.

[29:46] Because I told him, I told her I said, yeah, that's the, that's the old owner.

[29:50] He wants to buy the game back.

[29:51] And she says bullshit.

[29:52] No way in hell is he going to do that?

[29:56] And he did.

[29:57] He wanted to triple his offer and buy the game back for $6,000.

[30:01] Too bad.

[30:02] I said, sorry, but the game is, you know, in safe hands and, you know, it's, you know,

[30:10] obviously in safe hands and it will be in my collection for a long time.

[30:13] That's actually my fourth paragon.

[30:16] But she plays it every day when she wants to and she's all happy because she got her

[30:20] dream game.

[30:21] Right.

[30:22] But sellers regret is an interesting part of this hobby, right?

[30:25] And I mean, I think it's something that every collector has to consider.

[30:30] Yes.

[30:31] That's why you have invoices.

[30:35] I try to teach people to stuff all the time, but they're like invoices or bullshit.

[30:40] And I was like, there's a lot of importance because I said, look, you, you signed this

[30:44] invoice.

[30:46] You know, they were, I mean, they were, they were cordial.

[30:49] They weren't mean or anything.

[30:51] Right.

[30:52] I had it happen about a dozen times or so in about 30 years.

[30:57] So it happens.

[30:58] But the most important thing for you to do, and I, you know, this is a topic that you could

[31:02] do for another podcast another day is, you know, what are the proper steps when you go

[31:08] to buy that pinball machine that you've determined that you want?

[31:14] Used or new?

[31:15] We're primarily talking used and making sure that not only, you know, you cover all

[31:20] your bases and you're not going to have to worry about these kind of things down the

[31:25] road because if I didn't have that invoice, you know, there's all sorts of things that

[31:30] can happen with people.

[31:32] People get all crazy like, you know, I, you know, I had a guy a long time ago that threatened

[31:37] to sue me in small claims court if I didn't sell his game back to him.

[31:41] Wow.

[31:42] Well, it was a long time ago, but it does happen.

[31:45] So the best way to do that is to course, you know, make sure that when you load the game,

[31:50] you load it fast, you know, it's give the money, secure the deal, sign the invoice, load

[31:55] the game and get the hell out of there.

[31:57] Right.

[31:58] No, it deals the deal.

[32:00] Deal the deal.

[32:01] Don't sit there and bullshit with the other person.

[32:04] It's like, I'm here for business.

[32:06] I'm not here for pleasure and visit your, the rest of your collection.

[32:09] So I'm looking at it.

[32:10] I'm looking at your paragon here on Facebook and you know, it's, it's gorgeous.

[32:14] I mean, I think the hardest part with these games, you know, the play field obviously looks

[32:19] immaculate, but the cabinet is, looks brand new.

[32:23] Yeah, it is.

[32:24] It's unfaited, but that's what happens.

[32:27] Sometimes you get lucky, but I mean, if you're a hardcore collector and you know what you're

[32:33] looking for, you know, I, that's what I do now.

[32:36] I don't, I don't have any player quality games in my collection.

[32:41] So, you know, I, you know, if I find the diamond and the rough, I, I have a good friend of mine

[32:46] just, just two weeks ago, he's selling me a wizard that was bought by a guy when he was

[32:53] 12 years old.

[32:54] It was a gift by his parents and he had it for, well, wizard was 1975.

[33:01] So he's in his 50s and he had it for 30 some years and that's coming into the house so I

[33:06] can restore that pretty quick.

[33:08] So this stuff's out there.

[33:09] I mean, these aren't, these aren't unicorns.

[33:13] But they do, if you, if a collector wants a game like that, they have to be willing

[33:19] to do the detective work and put their feet to the ground in order to, you know, find

[33:25] what they're looking for.

[33:26] And I told you, I think what, two years ago, that when I said that, you know, Carla's

[33:31] dream game, you know, was, you know, said, well, ask me what game she wanted and said

[33:35] Paragon.

[33:36] And I said, I'd find one for her.

[33:38] Right.

[33:39] And you found the nicest one probably in America.

[33:41] Well, it turns it, but it makes for an interesting story, which then goes back to your point,

[33:48] what's pinball about?

[33:49] Well, pinball isn't necessarily about just playing the game.

[33:53] The adventures in the stories, I mean, the hunt, I call it the hunt.

[33:56] You've heard that before.

[33:58] Sure.

[33:59] The hunt for collectors that have been doing this for a long time, it's not owning the game.

[34:04] It's finding the game.

[34:06] Oh, yeah.

[34:07] It's the same is true with, you know, when I was collecting our cave games and it's,

[34:12] it's just like there's those, speaking of the hunt, and I think what's interesting, well,

[34:18] before I, I want to talk a little bit about remakes with you guys, because I think remakes

[34:22] definitely has an impact on hunting for.

[34:24] Yeah, I want to know from both of you and Carla in terms of the newer games, what games

[34:35] that are currently sort of coming out over the last like couple of years, do you look at

[34:40] and say like, wow, like that game just looks awesome.

[34:44] You got, you got an opinion on that.

[34:46] Right.

[34:47] Yeah, I like dial in.

[34:48] I play that game and it's nice.

[34:49] Right.

[34:50] Really, Joette, I like it.

[34:53] I like more when they don't have a translate.

[34:56] I like more of the actual backlasses, but I have to be beautiful.

[35:02] Yeah, for me, probably it would be Houdini, because I think it offers a lot of features

[35:07] for what you're buying in an old-schooler 90-style, Valley Williams package.

[35:14] Now I can't tell you from the standpoint of the electronics because I haven't done

[35:18] a assessment for that particular game.

[35:21] I'm assuming it's probably p-rock equivalency, but, you know, as far as not the, you know,

[35:27] I'm not interested in remakes, you know that.

[35:29] I mean, I can definitely give you a perspective that you were interested with, you know, planetary

[35:34] pinball of Rick, because I don't know if I'd call that what you had mentioned was a revelation

[35:40] because I pretty much knew most about it as most of the old guys do already.

[35:44] Well, it was interesting what he did today.

[35:46] Like, let's jump there because I'm, you know, trying to sell a Towsr the Caribbean Knights,

[35:51] right?

[35:52] And even in just listing my machine, you, I see more, more now than ever before in the

[35:58] comments section, they might remake this game and it, like, creates pause amongst potential

[36:04] buyers.

[36:05] But we have saturation problems right now, as you know, and, you know, coupled with

[36:10] the new games that are competing against the saturation of the stern titles from the 2000s

[36:15] and the 2010s, you know, you've got this, you know, the market is, as, you know, we talked

[36:22] about the, you know, things like the stall and stuff.

[36:24] You know, the prediction came true is exactly the prices are dropping.

[36:28] But when someone says, for example, that, you know, that the, the warning bell signs

[36:34] are out because all these people are selling monster vases that this is definitely the

[36:40] next title.

[36:41] That's not how it works with Rick.

[36:43] I mean, I'm an acquaintance friend of Rick, okay?

[36:46] He looks at the market.

[36:48] He sees what's, what is most profitable from the standpoint.

[36:52] He prioritized that as his next title.

[36:55] I don't know if it's, he hasn't made a decision.

[36:58] Oh, he's got multiple as he stated.

[37:01] He has multiple games that are in development.

[37:05] Whether, whether, whatever, what, what direction he pushes his resources to, to release the

[37:11] next game is his choice because he has the rights.

[37:15] But he made it very, the movie he made today, and this is for the listener of the show

[37:20] of the heaven's scene.

[37:21] This is Rick announced, hey, enough of all the speculation, we're going to, we're going

[37:27] to make the following games, not sure which order and we might add some games to this list,

[37:32] but we're going to remake cactus canyon, monster bash, theater of magic and big bang bar.

[37:39] By just saying that in, you know, December, whatever it is, 19th or whatever, 16th, 17th,

[37:46] he, he is collapsing the high end value of all those games immediately for, because

[37:55] or not collapsing, but he's knocking them down.

[37:58] Like he's knocking them down.

[38:00] Well, no, I'm not, you know, I'm not saying that's that would be a repeated statement.

[38:05] When you ask, you know, I've talked about this before, you know, I'm not in the remake

[38:10] market.

[38:11] I only prefer original games of any type.

[38:13] It doesn't matter.

[38:14] You know, when I, you know, when today and on a separate matter, when you compare, where

[38:20] we're going, that's a separate issue.

[38:21] Let's stay on topic.

[38:22] But the thing with Rick, he's, he's a planner.

[38:26] You know, he, all his comments that he makes are not by accident.

[38:31] When he made the statement today, that was a very strategic move on his behalf to kind

[38:39] of shore up potentiality of future customers.

[38:43] Not necessarily to damage the market, but certainly he wants to see, he wants to see

[38:49] who's, who's like, he's finishing what games people are saying they really want.

[38:54] Yes, he's fishing, but he's also doing it strategically because he has the resources

[39:00] and the game monster bash has been under development for quite some time as a remake.

[39:06] And if he sees that everybody wants monster bash and he puts it the priority efforts of

[39:11] his resources in the monster bash for a save versus cactus canyon, there's no doubt

[39:16] that he's had a lot of the development cycle of the ability for him to produce the game

[39:23] is the key because he can't produce more than one or two games if he was at full steam,

[39:28] which he's still kind of moving up that ladder as we speak in order to continue to build

[39:34] his business for what it is.

[39:36] I mean, he is a competitor of Stern.

[39:38] I don't know if Stern should be really that concerned since they still control a lot

[39:42] of the market, but this is all strategic.

[39:46] I mean, it's the same thing as like when you want to talk things like deep root.

[39:49] You know, why did deep root do what they did or release the statement with this week

[39:53] in pinball?

[39:54] You know, there's a certain measure of things like sensationalism.

[39:58] There's a certain things in seeing what kind of reactions they get, but you know, Rick's

[40:04] not a stupid guy.

[40:05] He's been doing this stuff for about 25, 30 years as a parts manufacturer, as a distributor,

[40:13] and as a pinball guru.

[40:15] And he's been, he knows all the people in the industry.

[40:18] Right.

[40:19] But you got to admit, and Carl, I love to hear your opinion on this too.

[40:25] Like imagine if both you guys, if you owned a big bang bar, like part of you just got

[40:31] to be like, shit.

[40:33] Like thanks man.

[40:34] Like you just, you just cut my legs off because now you can't go sell it for what you

[40:39] could have.

[40:40] And the game might not come out for three, four years.

[40:42] Right.

[40:43] But there's always going to be a market for a person that wants an original.

[40:46] But not, but not that, that market's not as big.

[40:51] No, it's not because you've got a lot of new people with money that don't care.

[40:56] It will reduce the market definitely.

[40:58] It will affect you.

[40:59] You can think of it as owners.

[41:00] You could compare it to the housing market.

[41:02] You know,

[41:03] yeah, yeah, exactly the same thing with housing market.

[41:06] Of course, it will affect who the current owners for those titles are, because you know

[41:11] that if somebody come in, kneeling to the hobby, it will prefer to buy even if it's a remake.

[41:18] But you know, it will cost less.

[41:21] Right.

[41:22] But it will cost less in the actual.

[41:24] But what they're, it will affect bottom.

[41:26] Yeah.

[41:27] Yeah, of course.

[41:28] And what they're doing, but here's the thing, here's the difference though.

[41:30] They're not just like remaking like a photocopy.

[41:34] They're enhancing the games a little bit.

[41:36] And those enhancements people want.

[41:39] Well, it not everybody.

[41:41] I mean, if you ask me and most of the purists, we don't want that.

[41:45] We want a carbon copy that's identical to the original game in every way.

[41:50] We including logos.

[41:51] I mean, that's the only way I would buy a remake because, but that's, but that's

[41:55] me as a collector.

[41:57] I will always know the difference.

[42:00] And if someone tries to show me an attack from Mars, I'll always know the difference between

[42:06] a remake and an original game.

[42:08] It's weird.

[42:09] It's like in other collectible industry like hobbies, like transformer toys.

[42:13] I brought this up.

[42:14] Yeah.

[42:15] They make remakes and they're worth like a fraction of what the originals are worth.

[42:20] Yeah, but people are, I mean, not everybody are probably playing with their transformer

[42:24] toys.

[42:25] They're setting them on a shelf.

[42:26] So remember, what are people buying the bottom line in this case is this?

[42:32] What are people doing with these machines?

[42:34] Well, why do people buy remakes?

[42:36] Because they want a nice looking game that they can play.

[42:39] And less expensive.

[42:40] And that's less expensive.

[42:42] There's no bottom line other than that.

[42:45] I mean, if I was a new collector and I'd have to step back in time.

[42:50] If I had gotten into the hobby, say, five years ago.

[42:54] And I had just started out and trying to build a collection.

[42:57] And I had a choice between spending $12,000 on an original cactus canyon or an $7,000

[43:05] or $8,000, whatever the market can bear, you know, remake.

[43:10] You know, of course, it's a no-brainer, but they don't care.

[43:14] It's a matter of wanting to play the game that they couldn't play otherwise.

[43:17] Yeah, it takes time.

[43:19] It's also peace in mind, right?

[43:21] I mean, I think I learned this when I bought my tails.

[43:25] Unless you really know what to look for when you buy an older game, you don't know what

[43:31] you're walking into.

[43:32] That is true.

[43:33] When you buy a new inbox, there's a lot more possibilities.

[43:35] And that's why it's nice to have an old collector on your side to help go beside you.

[43:39] Which you most don't.

[43:40] But that's the thing.

[43:41] It's like most buyers don't.

[43:43] And most buyers, they see the pretty pictures they're sent.

[43:49] But there could be a litany of issues that are waiting for them.

[43:54] But if you buy a new inbox, you remember you're talking about a game that's, you know,

[43:59] 20 to 25 or going on.

[44:01] Not quite the exact same.

[44:03] 20 to 25 years old.

[44:04] And all these games from the 90s, these, this specifically, the WPC 95 games that are

[44:12] using the audio visual board, we're having the same phenomenal problem that we did with

[44:18] the WPC games when they became 20 to 25 years ago is that they need to have additional

[44:24] servicing on the boards to bulletproof them.

[44:27] And the same problems are not happening with the audio visual board because the components

[44:31] are no longer available.

[44:33] So you have options.

[44:34] Either you go to somebody that knows what they're doing and restores the game properly.

[44:39] You take your chances and roll the dice or you buy a remake.

[44:43] And I'm not going to deny that if you're a new collector that is not familiar or comfortable

[44:49] working with electronics, that going a remake route is probably a smart move.

[44:55] But you're also not looking at it from the standpoint of wanting to maintain and keep

[45:00] that machine running for 20 or 30 years.

[45:03] You're not because you're not at that point in the collecting career.

[45:07] I mean, I've got games in my house that are 50 years old.

[45:12] Now in some cases, I've games that have got games that are 50 years old that never saw

[45:17] an arcade, which is pretty amazing, but it happens.

[45:21] But I still have to take care of that.

[45:23] Sure.

[45:24] I can't just let them sit in the corner and otherwise that things will happen.

[45:29] But right now that's not the mood of the collectors.

[45:32] We are kind of slowing down as you saw if you want to look at the market based on not only

[45:37] on the saturation level or people with lack of funds or lack of space, but the market itself

[45:45] has reached that tipping point that I knew was going to happen.

[45:50] That when the prices hit around 10 to 12 thousand dollars, people start sitting back in

[45:56] their chairs and going, is this really worth spending the outmuch money?

[46:02] Right.

[46:03] And we're at that point now.

[46:05] I couldn't agree more and I think it's just going to get worse next year because I'm actually

[46:12] about to do a year in review and a year prediction show with my friends in Australia.

[46:20] And we were just counting out the number of pinball companies and it's around like 14

[46:28] manufacturers.

[46:29] Yeah, there's a lot of them.

[46:31] Not in a state of, yeah, it just apparently skid be, but about eight of them are legitimately

[46:39] promising games in 2018 and there's no way.

[46:45] Because even if you just count the stirring games, they've got like five titles coming

[46:49] next year.

[46:50] A lot of competition.

[46:53] And you know, people like Rick and through you know, planetary pinball and CGC are positioning

[46:58] themselves based on his strategic comments to ensure that he has viability as the source

[47:06] for a games that were bright, they're proven as games that were successful in games that

[47:10] are reliable because he's refined a lot of the things he done for manufacturing with CGC.

[47:16] So he has a good name.

[47:18] So it's curious because you know, after he posted his comment, a lot of people were like,

[47:25] what about like Adam's family, you know, Twilight going in any end of Jones, that's the

[47:30] watershed.

[47:31] And that's the watershed.

[47:33] Right.

[47:34] Anything's fair game, but you know, realistically speaking, we're talking, you know, decades

[47:39] right because there's so as other people, I saw the poster briefly, you know, browse through

[47:45] it.

[47:46] You know, when you have a game that made close to, you know, 14,000 games or something, you

[47:52] are not going to see a mad dash to, you know, wanting to get a remake of Twilight's

[47:57] own or Adam's family or I mean, it would be nice and all, but it's all about the bottom

[48:03] dollar line.

[48:05] And if you can't make the sales, like what he was doing with the tech for Mars, he can't

[48:12] produce.

[48:13] And remember, you've talked about how many games do you need to sell in order to make

[48:18] a profit?

[48:19] Right.

[48:20] Okay, if you can't, if you're selling a thousand of a game, you're not going to make, you're

[48:27] just going to start making profit.

[48:30] That's just in anything beyond, you need to sell more, the more the better, but you need

[48:35] to get up in the two, three, four thousand, five thousand, five thousand to hit these days.

[48:41] He's making his, yeah, and he's, he's just remaking hits.

[48:48] I'm curious, Chris and Carla feel free to jump in on this too.

[48:52] As a pinball historian, as someone who, who does like enjoy the interesting stories behind

[48:59] games, and I know we had our own podcast talking about the backstory of Big Bang Bar.

[49:04] Are you sad and at all that some of what makes those stories special is that only a very

[49:10] limited number of them came to fruition that wants to floodgates open.

[49:16] It's, you know, it's kind of no longer as special anymore.

[49:20] Well, I don't, I don't, Carla does look at me like she doesn't really have an answer.

[49:25] I guess I can do my story in half, you know, or I'm still kind of new.

[49:31] Well, I mean, she looks at it from a history standpoint, but you know, I, I, we talk a lot

[49:36] about history of games at times, but I try not one, one of the golden rules that, that

[49:42] Chris knows, I'm going to talk to myself in the third person here is don't overwhelm

[49:47] your girlfriend with suprifless facts.

[49:50] Okay.

[49:51] And I really don't mind.

[49:52] Including pinball.

[49:53] All right.

[49:54] No, I really don't mind.

[49:55] We can talk about all the time.

[49:57] We, we listen to your podcast all the time when we're doing you when we're traveling here

[50:02] at home.

[50:03] I mean, it makes us road trips go fast.

[50:07] She still thought one of your favorite podcasts was the one that you did with Jersey Jack.

[50:11] He kept listening to that one on the road.

[50:13] Oh, yeah.

[50:14] It was great.

[50:15] I think I listened to that one like three times.

[50:16] You know, it was with a snowball.

[50:17] She liked listening to that one when we would travel to do road trips to pick up games.

[50:21] I, I owe Jack another visit to talk about pirates, but I always like to do it a little bit

[50:26] closer to in the games ship because here's my, here's my concern when it comes, anything

[50:31] that comes to a remake.

[50:33] This is the only major concern.

[50:35] Anything that's good for keeping pinball enthusiasm alive on cool with, there will always

[50:40] be a place in any hobby.

[50:42] And this is my thought specifically to answer your question, remakes versus history versus

[50:48] the real games.

[50:50] Is there always be a place any game or any hobby that's popular enough that will always

[50:56] be copycats always, okay?

[51:00] If you truly want a piece of pinball history, you'll buy the original game.

[51:06] If you want to play that same, the game that looks to, it looks almost identical, it

[51:12] may play almost identical.

[51:15] There is absolutely no problem with the remake.

[51:18] The only problem that I do have with it and I'm going to use a specific example, although

[51:23] it's not exactly the same and it kind of leads into another area is that when a game

[51:30] starts to take on the properties of a home model game.

[51:36] That's when I start to have concerns.

[51:39] And I give an example, and it is not an exact example, but it leads into a topic that I

[51:45] alluded to with you in regards to spike.

[51:49] If you take a game like the original Electro Mechanical Game Fireball with its zipper flippers

[51:56] and its Electro Mechanical Workings, you know, they've remade that game in various incarnations

[52:02] from 1976 to 1985.

[52:07] The problem was, as they made a home model using electronics in 1976, and they sold a ton

[52:14] of them, but they were extremely cheap and they were in the long term were very unreliable.

[52:23] My problem that I see in that example would be, you're not getting the quality for what

[52:29] you're paying for, which is my concern right now with Stern with their current spike

[52:36] generation as they move in the spike generation three.

[52:41] But to keep it where we were, Chicago Gaming and GPS, the quality there is on par.

[52:48] It is on par with the original.

[52:50] The original.

[52:51] The original.

[52:52] Based on PCSMD technology, they have raised their bar in terms of their quality, they've

[52:56] worked their kinks out with their system.

[52:59] It's not spike, it's more reliable.

[53:01] I'm not sure I'm keen on having to replace some of the LEDs on the masterboards and stuff,

[53:07] but for the most part, it is generally a good reliable system that operates both well

[53:14] in a commercial environment and a home environment, which means they are providing that commercial

[53:19] grade quality product, which is totally fine by me.

[53:22] Yeah, it hurts the collectors.

[53:24] But once again, in 10 to 15 years, I don't think it's going to matter.

[53:29] It doesn't matter if there's 5,000 attack from Mars remakes floating around.

[53:35] Every time that you find an original attack from Mars, it will be determined.

[53:40] It's just like a classic car.

[53:42] But at some point, at some point, and this will happen, all the people that care about

[53:49] an original attack from Mars will be older dead.

[53:52] Yeah.

[53:53] I think it will happen.

[53:55] I'll probably be older dead.

[53:56] Who knows?

[53:57] Right.

[53:58] I think we're going to get to a point.

[54:00] Because I don't know the sort of thing.

[54:03] I'm always curious with so many new titles coming out, do people even care about remaking

[54:10] stuff from 20, 25 years ago?

[54:12] Like why?

[54:14] It's just an nostalgia thing for some people that it's a discovery.

[54:20] For a lot of people, a lot of people, like what Carla talked about early on.

[54:25] She didn't have much experience in pinball.

[54:28] She didn't grow up.

[54:29] She was born in carbonate.

[54:31] Carla, you're on the same boat as 99% of most people on the planet when you said that.

[54:37] Right.

[54:38] Except she has a good friend.

[54:40] It's abnormal to have grown up around pinball too much.

[54:45] Even I didn't completely grow up around pinball.

[54:49] I wasn't growing up in a coin-operated environment.

[54:51] I just liked this as a child.

[54:54] It comes and goes and phases.

[54:57] Who keeps pinball alive?

[54:59] The collectors do.

[55:01] When pinball wanes as it will, and it is right now, people are starting to say, hey, this

[55:08] isn't quite as fat as it was.

[55:10] Yes, it's still very popular on routes, at least out here in Portland.

[55:14] There's still the mecha area.

[55:16] It's still going strong.

[55:17] But eventually it will fade and it will become a fad and then it will come back again just

[55:22] like it always has.

[55:23] But where it will be in 25 years from now, will it be relevant as a form of amusement and

[55:33] entertainment?

[55:34] I can't tell you that.

[55:36] I know for me, I'll still be playing pinball and so will probably you be.

[55:40] Yeah.

[55:41] I mean, like 20-25 years from now.

[55:46] It'll be ready player one world will be upon us.

[55:49] It's funny on Pinside.

[55:51] People are like, no, virtual reality is not really going to catch on.

[55:54] Well, it will.

[55:55] It will.

[55:56] It's a way.

[55:58] But once again, I'm just like you.

[56:00] You make the jokes.

[56:01] It's like you want to be different.

[56:04] Collect pinball machines.

[56:05] Yeah.

[56:06] You're going to go self-apart from all your cronies and all your friends and they're all going

[56:11] to find fascinating and unique because they don't know that on any other people to do

[56:16] it.

[56:17] And like I said, I don't do, I don't collect pinball machines as an EP like some people

[56:23] do on various websites.

[56:25] I don't.

[56:26] I don't like that.

[56:27] What do you say as a what?

[56:29] As an EP.

[56:30] What is that?

[56:31] You never heard of EP?

[56:32] No.

[56:33] Electronic penis.

[56:34] We made a lot of the censor right now.

[56:38] That's what they call it as an EP.

[56:40] Okay.

[56:41] I think I've heard every insult, especially lobbied at me.

[56:45] I've never been called that.

[56:46] It's about an EP.

[56:48] Some people they do that.

[56:49] Some people want to have this fantastic collection so they can show it off to their friends.

[56:55] But eventually that wears off.

[56:58] And when it comes down to it, if you're not in the hobby for the right reasons, you don't

[57:02] stick around.

[57:03] Yeah.

[57:04] Just don't.

[57:05] I've watched so many people over the years come and go and yet there are some people that

[57:12] I've known for 30 years that are still here.

[57:15] See, and those people are the ones that band together with this band of brother stuff

[57:20] that you like to talk about because these people are the people that keep pinball live

[57:25] when the periods are quote unquote dead or the manufacturers aren't producing games.

[57:30] Because we keep it alive for the next generation of people.

[57:34] I'm trying to teach people as protegeys on how to fix games.

[57:38] I got one right beside me.

[57:40] Right.

[57:41] It's a great point because those people, the knowledge base, because imagine not just

[57:48] those people too, imagine if companies like Mark Goe and pinball life, if they just went

[57:53] away, right?

[57:54] If you lose the resource of the knowledge and the materials you need to keep the machines

[58:00] going and you lose the hobby because they just beat it.

[58:04] That's a concern.

[58:05] I mean, Steve Young is getting old.

[58:08] I mean, Steve Young is the EM got, especially for got live EM wedgehead parts.

[58:13] He's getting old and he has a lot of parts that he produces for ballet too in Williams

[58:17] games.

[58:18] And some of these people are getting pretty old.

[58:22] They're in their late 60s, early 70s and somebody has to pick up the torch and carry

[58:28] it forward.

[58:29] That's been the joke with Tim Arnold, you know, with the pinball fan forever is when is

[58:33] he going to get a protege to help carry the torch when he passes on and stops being

[58:38] grumpy because he's not going to be grumpy anymore if he's not alive.

[58:42] So it's a challenge.

[58:44] But once again, somebody has to carry the torch and eventually though, and I'm a motivator,

[58:51] you know that.

[58:52] I try to be, and at least I think Carla can agree to that.

[58:55] I agree.

[58:56] Okay.

[58:57] When it comes to this hobby, there's a right way to do it and there's a wrong way to do

[59:00] it.

[59:01] And the wrong way to do it is saying, look at me, look at how great my collection is.

[59:05] And the best way to do it is let me teach you how to fix your game.

[59:11] Or how about you share this with a five year old child that's never seen a pinball machine

[59:16] other than on their computer.

[59:18] Right.

[59:19] Right.

[59:20] This is the kind of thing that even though they may not grow up with it, just exposing

[59:25] them the pinball.

[59:26] And you know, I'm in a story and for a reason because guess what?

[59:30] A lot of the knowledge that I report, which I haven't wrote any long thesis articles on

[59:36] Pinside quote unquote, you know, in a while is that there's a lot of knowledge that's

[59:41] been lost because it's not been documented.

[59:45] People like Duncan Brown, you know, people like, I mean, even clay, there's a lot of people

[59:49] that have a lot of knowledge.

[59:51] But unless it's documented, it gets lost.

[59:54] And what's really surprising, canada, is that this is happening with games that were made

[59:59] in the 90s.

[01:00:02] I think that's hilarious because the games aren't that old.

[01:00:06] When you say, like, when you say stuff is lost, what do you, what?

[01:00:10] Like the design, the design of Twilight, so why did Ted Estes and Pat Lager do certain

[01:00:15] things with the game when they designed it?

[01:00:17] And people go, wow, I didn't know that.

[01:00:20] Right.

[01:00:21] They have no idea why.

[01:00:22] So you have to contemplate it writing a book, maybe?

[01:00:26] I am writing a book.

[01:00:27] All right.

[01:00:28] I'm not writing a book.

[01:00:29] I'm not writing a book about Valley Williams games.

[01:00:32] Well, I am sort of, it's about Ted Zail.

[01:00:35] I'm writing a book.

[01:00:36] I've got the transcript.

[01:00:38] It's about Ted Zail, one of the masters of pinball innovation that created a lot of the

[01:00:44] things that people take for granted today in pinball.

[01:00:47] Seth, there should be more, because there's, there's enough people in this hobby where

[01:00:52] there should be more documentaries about pinball.

[01:00:54] Yeah, it'd be nice.

[01:00:56] She likes, you like watching people.

[01:00:58] It's easier than reading a book.

[01:01:01] She likes spooky.

[01:01:02] She liked this one that spooky did for his little, you know, historical thing.

[01:01:06] She watched that one.

[01:01:07] She thought that was great.

[01:01:08] I mean, that's what I tell Chris all the time.

[01:01:10] I say, you know, you have so much knowledge that even for me, it's hard to remember things,

[01:01:15] you know, for my own game.

[01:01:17] And, you know, you know, he's asked me, right?

[01:01:19] Right.

[01:01:20] I know.

[01:01:21] I'm like, okay, can you talk about my game?

[01:01:24] But, you know, he need to really, you know, make sure that he's not going to be a

[01:01:28] person.

[01:01:29] He writes a book.

[01:01:30] I get on his case all the time, you know, he, he had actually, he had a, a, a, a, a

[01:01:34] recreational room at my house.

[01:01:37] Yeah.

[01:01:38] And I hear so funny.

[01:01:39] Now, he wanted to talk about something that's related to Carla.

[01:01:42] She can share what she provided me.

[01:01:45] All right.

[01:01:46] Get ready for this one, because it's funny.

[01:01:48] All right.

[01:01:49] No, I mean, I do.

[01:01:50] I'm really.

[01:01:51] He's taking over your home.

[01:01:52] Tell her what she did for me.

[01:01:54] No, actually, I gave him one of my rooms.

[01:01:57] One of my large bedrooms at my house, so he can restore games.

[01:02:01] Unbelievable.

[01:02:02] How cool is that?

[01:02:03] You're moving in.

[01:02:04] It's not well.

[01:02:05] Well, you're moving in.

[01:02:06] It's in the wrong direction.

[01:02:07] Carla, when a man says, can I borrow a room for pinball restoration?

[01:02:14] That's when you know it's time to get out.

[01:02:16] No, I said, well, teach me.

[01:02:20] I want to.

[01:02:21] I mean, how cool is that?

[01:02:23] You got a girlfriend.

[01:02:24] She's got a fairly large home.

[01:02:27] So, but I've got a decent size home, but I don't have enough room for all my games.

[01:02:32] So I've got games that I need to restore that have been studying in storage.

[01:02:36] And she says, get them out of storage.

[01:02:38] I'll give you a bedroom, and you can restore them in my house.

[01:02:41] I mean, I don't know how many times you've heard that in your life.

[01:02:47] All I heard was the engagement's over.

[01:02:49] We're not on a fast track for that, but we're going to get along just like that.

[01:02:56] Well, how interesting teams.

[01:02:58] So, do you guys, so you know, Chris, in Carla, do you guys, are you guys ever in the market for like some of the newer games coming out?

[01:03:07] Well, you know, even I like it.

[01:03:10] We've been to places and play the newer games.

[01:03:14] I'm not so much into spending a lot of money in pinball for now.

[01:03:19] I like, you know, I have my, you know, my budget and then, you know, it just I have other things, you know, in my life going on.

[01:03:26] But I call priority.

[01:03:27] I have my priorities.

[01:03:29] Yes.

[01:03:29] I'm really interested in here.

[01:03:31] You say that, Carla, because I think a lot of the people like on the forums, like they become so desensitized to like eight, nine, 10,000 dollars.

[01:03:41] But you're buying machines and you can still get into, you know, different errors of machines for a thousand, 2,000 dollars.

[01:03:50] Like you can get five machines for the price of one.

[01:03:53] Right.

[01:03:53] Do you just, well, I'll give you an example.

[01:03:55] I this, this, see, I don't have any problems with the new machines.

[01:03:59] But what I remember, I always go for bang for the buck, you know, so when I saw the market turn.

[01:04:07] The first thing I did, as I said, it's time for my Metallica premium monsters to go.

[01:04:14] Because I knew that the market would start dropping as because they're still under production.

[01:04:19] Right.

[01:04:19] So I sold it and bought three more three new machines and pocketed the rest of the cash and paid for my groceries for three months.

[01:04:29] So you got to add at the right time because I know that, I mean, I just know better.

[01:04:34] And I know when the sell or when the keeps on, but it wasn't what I'm saying is there's no gain, for example, for me.

[01:04:40] The problem in my case in Carla would probably love to have like a 30 machines, which she probably won't hear it anyway.

[01:04:47] If I get them all out of storage, but I got that many it starts.

[01:04:51] But the thing is, is I'm, you reach a point when you're collecting at least for me as long as I have been that it starts to take on the aspect that, well, this is just one more machine.

[01:05:03] Okay. Because I literally, I mean, I've owned over 600 and some machines.

[01:05:07] So, I mean, and that's a lot of games in 30 years.

[01:05:11] I mean, I think that's a right now when, you know, when Chris get a new machine, you know, we, we restore the game together.

[01:05:17] So it's just like a different face now to, you know, when you were buying a game.

[01:05:22] So we really enjoy it. We really enjoyed the hobby that way.

[01:05:25] But the same thing, I don't think I will, I will own that many machines, you know, myself, but because I'm, but I like beautiful, beautiful games.

[01:05:35] But I want to put that much money in.

[01:05:38] Chris, why didn't, why didn't you buy Carla magic girl?

[01:05:41] It's like the most beautiful game.

[01:05:43] We did have one.

[01:05:44] It's now sale here at $22,500 in Portland last week.

[01:05:49] Oh, really?

[01:05:50] Who else?

[01:05:51] I'm not, you don't know what it was because it wasn't who I thought it was because there's the ones I knew were either sold or they got.

[01:05:58] So I, I'm happy I got out at the price I got out at how you did too.

[01:06:07] Well, it's funny because like the second people heard I sold mine.

[01:06:10] A lot of my, the other owners who had it, I think they're now tempted to try and find another buyer, but there aren't many buyers out there.

[01:06:22] And the word is out on the street, man.

[01:06:24] You know that.

[01:06:25] Yeah.

[01:06:26] That game is, is what it is.

[01:06:29] It's a piece of artwork and that's where it stands.

[01:06:32] Right.

[01:06:33] It's still an amazing thing.

[01:06:34] I mean, for someone who has a big collection, it's going to a very, very large collection.

[01:06:38] It has to because they, you can't, as you know, I mean, if that was your only game, it's just not going to work.

[01:06:44] Yeah.

[01:06:45] I mean, not only literally, I mean, it just won't do you think, do you think deep root succeeds with John Papadu get the home?

[01:06:53] No, I don't think so.

[01:06:55] I think that was a shameless publicity stunt.

[01:06:58] I recognize they're using sensationalism for making their statements and willing to offer the interview with this week in pinball.

[01:07:07] I think it's a, these kind of circumstance.

[01:07:10] And I said this on Pinside after I explained that I had talked to some other former designers, not currently presently active in pinball.

[01:07:19] We're talking from the 90s and the 2000s that all shied away from dealing with Mr. Mueller and his investor crew is that that kind of company is a cancer.

[01:07:32] They are dangerous.

[01:07:33] They're cancerous.

[01:07:35] They have no interest in, they're not dedicated to any portion of the hobby.

[01:07:40] They're only in it for purposes of can I make a quick buck?

[01:07:43] They are not going to offer support if they even manage to pull off one game.

[01:07:48] What kind of customer support are we would own or expect to get out of that company?

[01:07:53] It was curious.

[01:07:54] He's like, you know, I offered Robert to come on the show and he said, yes, at first.

[01:07:57] And he said, no, this would probably be the only interview that would actually ask the tough questions of them.

[01:08:02] But why do rich guys go into pinball to make profit when they could easily make a much better return in the market?

[01:08:11] I think initially, well, as I stated up front a while back, because remember this plan that they had is not new, it started back in 2015.

[01:08:20] Right.

[01:08:21] I mean, I knew that before was posted with information.

[01:08:24] They had ideas of getting into the pinball market actually before that when Jersey Jack pinball, if you want, if people want the listeners want to know, that was actually back in 2013.

[01:08:38] When I was living in San Antonio, which is, you know, the headquarters for deep root, they had an interest in getting into pinball when they saw the potentialities for the success of Jersey Jack pinball, not of course realizing the pitfalls and the challenges that he was having.

[01:08:54] That and they shelved it, but they're looking at it as a potentiality for purposes of investment profit.

[01:09:02] They didn't necessarily understand what they were getting into, but they saw that there was a garnished interest in this niche hobby, like any other potential hobby that they could cash into because they saw large volumes of cash being exchanged for individual games such as Magic Girl.

[01:09:22] And that was a potential hotbed for them to be able to make money.

[01:09:28] Well, because I've known sees the difficulties in manufacturing.

[01:09:34] Well, they didn't look at that.

[01:09:35] They looked at what John, John, John Puck Diet said, well, if you give me $16,000, I'll give you a game and that perked up their interest because they thought crap, man, that's their only.

[01:09:46] He's only saw like 25 games and he's making $16,000 a piece.

[01:09:51] Shit, we could do that too.

[01:09:53] But see, they're not looking at it from the mindset of an industry professional that understands how to build pinball machines because they have zero experience.

[01:10:03] Zero.

[01:10:04] And everybody that wanted to have anyone that has any knowledge of what they are wanted nothing to do with them as an industry professional in the coin operated business because they knew it was a damaging circumstance, not only because of that, but because of course the problems regarding to IP rights, the court battles, and everything else that was shamelessly and terribly strung out through the whole John Puck Diet thing.

[01:10:33] It's just terrible.

[01:10:34] But who are all the people on their website right now?

[01:10:37] Are those people like, are you familiar with any of those names?

[01:10:40] Some of them.

[01:10:41] I know them only from the standpoint of their other business because think of them like a big shark swallowing up a smaller shark.

[01:10:52] Okay, they're the kind of company that what they did when they made a lot of money by their investments is they kind of snuck in and they would break up companies.

[01:11:02] They would buy up resources and break up companies.

[01:11:05] So like Gordon Gecko style.

[01:11:07] Yeah, and they're, I mean, this is not the kind of people that you want to have in this hobby, which has already been damaged enough by false promises by various companies.

[01:11:17] And it's too small.

[01:11:19] And as you mentioned, I think very distinctly, one thing that was truly to be noted was, yes, we do take care of our own.

[01:11:28] Yes, we do pay attention because the people that know each other in this hobby do protect each other.

[01:11:35] And the word gets out on the street just like when a bad seller is a, you know, tries to sell bad machines or rip somebody off, that word gets out on the street.

[01:11:46] Pretty damn fast and it doesn't necessarily require a pin sight.

[01:11:51] Right.

[01:11:52] Carla, let me ask you.

[01:11:53] I'm going to give you three games.

[01:11:55] You tell me which one to think looks the best.

[01:11:58] Awesome.

[01:11:59] Ghostbusters.

[01:12:01] Batman 66.

[01:12:04] And...

[01:12:07] Erasmith.

[01:12:08] Oh, yeah.

[01:12:09] This is a trick question.

[01:12:11] Absolutely, I'll say Erasmith.

[01:12:13] Oh, I love Steven Tyler.

[01:12:16] You lost Kudo points from Canada.

[01:12:19] No, actually, I think Donnie's art package on Erasmith could possibly be like Stern's most detailed game today.

[01:12:28] Yeah, I actually played that game when we went to the x-point.

[01:12:32] Yeah, pinnigogo.

[01:12:34] And I really enjoy it.

[01:12:36] I really like Steven Tyler and I grew up in that era too, listening to Erasmith.

[01:12:41] So I feel more connected to that game.

[01:12:44] Okay.

[01:12:45] I like it.

[01:12:46] It's in beautiful colors, nice artwork, nice lighting.

[01:12:51] And actually, I did pretty good playing it.

[01:12:54] It's a good...

[01:12:56] I mean, look, for...

[01:12:58] I think Erasmith...

[01:13:00] The pro itself for $5,200 was the buy of the year last year in terms of what you got in it.

[01:13:07] All right, so Karla, I give you $10,000 to buy any new machine.

[01:13:12] What do you get?

[01:13:13] Nothing from 1976.

[01:13:15] It's gotta be...

[01:13:17] Oh, that's a tough question.

[01:13:21] If I have a really expensive taste.

[01:13:24] Well, this is hypothetical, but I do have expensive taste.

[01:13:28] Well, $10,000, oh wow.

[01:13:32] That'll pretty much get you.

[01:13:34] I like everything, but...

[01:13:36] I like the island, yeah.

[01:13:38] I like the selfie mode and the lighting and everything.

[01:13:42] Of course, Magic Girls, you know, beautiful.

[01:13:45] It's out of the range there.

[01:13:48] So dialed in.

[01:13:51] Yeah.

[01:13:52] Chris, do you think dialed-ins are still selling well?

[01:13:55] Do you think Jack kind of shot himself in the foot by revealing pirates so early?

[01:14:00] I think it's...

[01:14:01] From what I saw, his sales are dialed in are trickling now.

[01:14:05] They're starting to slow down.

[01:14:07] He did what he did.

[01:14:09] I mean, the problem, once again, it's not that he blew his wand on doing this thing that

[01:14:16] expo of pirates in the Caribbean, but the fact is that the game caters to a certain crew

[01:14:23] and once you get to that, once those people are satiated, who else are you gonna sell it to?

[01:14:29] Right.

[01:14:30] There's no fan base, right?

[01:14:33] It's an original IP.

[01:14:35] There's no lineage other than if you're a pat lawyer, fanatic, okay, I got it, you bought

[01:14:39] the game.

[01:14:40] But once you're a JGP fanatic, you know, you...

[01:14:44] But once you remember that price, you're starting it at $75 to $8,000 and you're going up

[01:14:50] from there, you have a limited window of potential customers.

[01:14:57] And once those are satiated, who do you sell it to?

[01:15:01] They're gonna sit.

[01:15:02] Right.

[01:15:03] It's the same thing as what happened to Hobbit.

[01:15:05] Right.

[01:15:06] I would say that in the world, diehard pat lawler fans, I would say it max $4,000.

[01:15:17] I don't think $4,000 people bought the game.

[01:15:21] Okay.

[01:15:22] But my point is this, in the world, there are 2 billion Star Wars fans.

[01:15:29] Yeah.

[01:15:30] Go tell me which thing you should make a game based on.

[01:15:35] Like, I think Jack, I mean, I really hope Jack, one day gets the game aligned with the right

[01:15:43] theme.

[01:15:44] I think Toy Story could be it if it's pat lawler making it.

[01:15:47] I agree.

[01:15:48] Toy Story, I think that will be a good, good title.

[01:15:50] He's got to get to it though.

[01:15:51] I mean, I'm a little concerned that pirates is going to struggle even though it's nice

[01:15:56] thing.

[01:15:57] When Houdini is more lucrative as a potential sales machine than dialed in, that's not good.

[01:16:04] How do you think Houdini is going to do?

[01:16:06] I think it's going to sell the first thousand or so and then I think it's going to slow down

[01:16:11] because there's going to be too many new titles to compete.

[01:16:14] I think that's the challenge.

[01:16:16] It's just getting over that hurdle once they get past their first thousand or so, it's

[01:16:22] going to be tough because they got that all that competition.

[01:16:25] You got your planetary pinball coming right up behind them, you know, with the next title

[01:16:30] which is going to be Monster Bash most likely because it's the furthest along and you know,

[01:16:36] he's going to drop the bomb probably in Texas and then it's going to be what's Houdini.

[01:16:41] Yeah.

[01:16:42] But here's the problem.

[01:16:45] How many Houdinis can they make a month?

[01:16:47] Because my issue with them is, well, they can take them 18 months to make a thousand and

[01:16:53] they're not going to have that big of a window to keep interest in.

[01:16:57] They're going to have less than a year and they're going to, you know, the hype will die.

[01:17:01] It's high so hype is already somewhat died anyway, but they're still making refinements with the

[01:17:07] code and doing what they need to do.

[01:17:08] But yeah, if their production facilities is incapable of pumping out, I'm just going to

[01:17:13] guess, I mean, let's say from their factory size, they can get maximum of 50 games out of

[01:17:19] a month.

[01:17:20] Okay.

[01:17:21] You know, that it's, yeah, they're not going to make a thousand games in the first year.

[01:17:25] They're not going to be able to make that production run.

[01:17:28] So that means it's going to go over a year, then hype is going to die down and then they're

[01:17:33] left going, are we really going to get these sales?

[01:17:36] I mean, as we know, it's a really tough business.

[01:17:40] The window opportunity will close usually within three months of hype and then people move on

[01:17:46] because that's why I think these companies are all going about it wrong because they don't

[01:17:55] understand marketing.

[01:17:56] If you know, you can only make 50 games a month, right, at your capacity and you know the

[01:18:02] hype window to sell a game might be only six months after it's like shipping.

[01:18:07] Then you need to be a boutique company that makes a limited run of maybe let's say 400,

[01:18:13] yeah, 400 games and you're done with the run because anything more than that would just take

[01:18:20] you too long to go find new buyers.

[01:18:22] Now, but you also, then you have to consider your overhead costs, your production costs.

[01:18:27] Yeah, and then it's just like, why don't you pinball?

[01:18:30] Why make pinball?

[01:18:31] No one is going to say, pinball is the most lucrative man means to make money and profit because it just

[01:18:39] isn't.

[01:18:40] When Balli and Williams, in the 90s, they, even though nobody can say that they were perfect

[01:18:48] in their marketing procedures, but they always did this the same way.

[01:18:54] And I just remember this is when X-Po is big, you know, the X-Po today is kind of a joke in comparison because

[01:19:01] it just, you know, you don't have the operator followers that are, you know, going there for that purpose.

[01:19:08] But if Balli and Williams, they would have their flagship title, they would bring it out and that was their game.

[01:19:14] Now, they might show a prototype to just be a little bit of a teaser and say, hey, this is going to be coming up in the next three to

[01:19:22] six months, but this is the game that you want to buy.

[01:19:25] And they did that for a long, long time and it stopped working in the 90s because operators were like, that was due to

[01:19:32] the overstock problems where they would, you know, build so many games and, you know, they couldn't sell them because

[01:19:38] everybody was waiting for them to go and close out, which, you know, backfart.

[01:19:41] But that, you know, they don't do that anymore.

[01:19:44] And they just don't put their resources at the right time, at the right place and they kind of, you know,

[01:19:53] blow their water early and then they're left kind of holding the bag when the thing actually gets done.

[01:19:58] I mean, that's why, you know, you've talked, other companies blew in the face.

[01:20:03] I mean, we don't need to talk about highway, we don't need to talk about Dutch.

[01:20:07] I mean, I just, I, that's the reason I don't even need to read about them anymore because it's joke.

[01:20:12] I mean, it's just, it's stated joke.

[01:20:15] Yeah, and I work about it.

[01:20:17] What I don't get, and it's just plain and simple.

[01:20:21] There's only room in the marketplace for boutique.

[01:20:25] Yeah, the market is just not strong enough to, the market is satiated.

[01:20:32] It gets satiated very quickly.

[01:20:35] And, and what you remember, all we've still, just like we had the problem in the 90s and I don't need to reflect about the past

[01:20:41] to compare this is that once a market is satiated and saturated with the number of titles that are available,

[01:20:48] people sometimes don't even know the difference.

[01:20:51] Right. The only thing, the only part of the market that is still not tapped is nobody is making a Rolls Royce, a Rougati, a pinball.

[01:21:01] If you, if you put everything imaginable into a game and you made just 50 of them in charge, $25,000.

[01:21:09] But the game like had the magic, like crazy, it actually got to be awesome.

[01:21:14] Yeah, people would buy it. The same way Bugatti is fucking awesome. Bugatti doesn't get beat by anything.

[01:21:21] You know, it's, it's, but no one's doing it. It's, it's weird.

[01:21:25] Yeah, I wouldn't think so. The crazy, the crazy amount of cost, the problem is of course is if you make a title that's like that and you have a crazy amount of development cost and, and bling that needs to pull that off.

[01:21:37] Yeah, you can't do it. It can't be, it's, it's a gamble. And Bugatti is a good, but Bugatti is a good example because Bugatti never made money.

[01:21:46] Volkswagen lost like tens of millions of dollars on Bugatti. It was just, but, but.

[01:21:51] Companies can't, pinball companies can't lose millions and millions of dollars and remain in business.

[01:21:58] They just can't. It's a proven fact from history that if they continue to lose money over and over again and within a few years, it's done.

[01:22:09] Unless they can absorb huge losses. Stern is, for example, preparing for the future right now every step of the way since 2007.

[01:22:21] They have carefully and meticulously planned every single step that has currently been implemented to ensure they're survival when the tide turns.

[01:22:32] Right. They have to the, I can see it based on the designs of their games. I can see it based on the designs of their electronics.

[01:22:41] I can see it from every single corner cutting thing that they do because they know that in the long term, if the tide turns and it can tie and can turn quick, they have to be able to downsize or reduced to say one or two titles a year or whatever is required in order to survive.

[01:23:02] And that's if they want to based on the investor council, which I don't know ultimately what their long term viability is if they just get tired and say, you know, we don't want to do this anymore.

[01:23:13] Right. It wouldn't take that much. No. It's, but I don't, I don't know. It's definitely all this is, is not going to last forever.

[01:23:23] Well, I'm down a positive side, though, on a positive note that does not mean that pinball will go away. That's the one thing that I want to ensure the view any new viewer collector owner player, whoever listens to these podcasts. That does not mean that pinball will disappear because I have heard that statement for 30 years when pinball dies. Nobody's going to care and not a, you know what, bullshit.

[01:23:49] Still here, it still will be in the future, even when VR takes over.

[01:23:55] And everyone knows why I mean, it's just something that can't be replicated accurately.

[01:24:03] I tell people like pitch and bat baseball, I got one right beside me at 1962 World Series. You can't replicate that on your iPhone.

[01:24:12] Right. Let me ask you a question. Do you consider pitching bat tinball? Yes. Only because of the design based on the cabinets and the mechanics and how they were actually implemented.

[01:24:23] It's not technically a pinball machine by technicality. Right. It's always been classified it is because of its its proximity to other. You know, when it was in the arcade in the 60s and the 70s, it was side by side with other games because of the same type of shape.

[01:24:40] It also uses a pinball. It's very similar. It's a smaller ball, but it's it's a ball bearing. There's no pins and pinball machines anymore either.

[01:24:52] Well, no, but you get pins and bowling ball. Some people classify, although this is a real loose one, some people classify bowlers ball bowlers as pinball machines too.

[01:25:04] Those are pins and pins. Yeah. It's more literal. Yeah. And you may do. I mean, unfortunately the shuffle bowlers, you know, they're like they take up like 20, 30 feet of your house.

[01:25:16] Right. So Carla, are you going to give Chris anymore rooms to put any more games in? Are you telling him like enough? We've got enough.

[01:25:24] No, actually, you know, I have a five-bedroom home. So you can have all the rooms with a condition that all the games has to be playable, beautiful, jewelry quality.

[01:25:36] jewelry quality. We need to make it a phrase. I'm going to be sanding and painting a lot of cabinets. Right. Now I mean, I really enjoy the hobby. I think, you know, his his design for his home is similar to mine.

[01:25:51] You know, with the with the signing in collection staff. So, you know, I wouldn't mind.

[01:25:59] He just wants me to get all my back glasses that I have hiding in closets and storage rooms and stuff on the walls.

[01:26:05] Yeah. It's it's look, I mean, the art is great to display. I mean, I always think when you're collecting anything, if stuff's like in too much storage or in boxes or in closets,

[01:26:19] I have it. It's like the, yeah, it defeats the purpose. I mean, there's no point for it. Just to have it inside a box. And that's what I tell Chris all the time. You know, if you're buying back glasses, you know, these, these play it beautiful, that's free.

[01:26:33] You know, but it has to be you have to wake up in the morning and see the beautiful back glass. You know, he does have a lot.

[01:26:42] A lot of them that I really enjoy and every time I walk through his house, I see something different. And then one of the one of the pleasures, I will say, see that many back glasses.

[01:26:53] It is gorgeous. Yeah. No, it's get you got to get those up. Get amount of boxes. All right. Well, I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

[01:27:01] I'm working on this frame. If you frame anything, frame is expensive. The back glass. I can take the back glasses.

[01:27:09] Yeah. I can't sit at my house. Oh my god. I don't have porous. They're so fragile too. I can't obviously because I don't use like me or those mirror hooks since that's that looks like ass.

[01:27:20] Yeah. I put them in frame. Yeah. And it's expensive. That's the thing too. Like when you want to start like framing printer, trans lights or back glasses, it's not cheap.

[01:27:30] My mom is in get expensive. Yes, it can. I have some work around. I mean, I'm getting some additional help to keep my costs down. But I try to do at least I know it's going to sound crazy. But I've been framing back glasses two, three a month for almost two years.

[01:27:47] Wow. I mean, it's just pulling them more and more out of storage. Some of them are brand new. Some of them are new old stock. Some people have seen on Facebook.

[01:27:57] I've got some stuff that's pretty rare. Like lockedness monster. Right. Right. That stuff's really rare. I mean, shoot. I might even buy that giant Rick Barnett just brought out the giant big foot back glass. I might even buy that one.

[01:28:13] Oh my god.

[01:28:16] I'm all by am all. Well, I don't know. I don't have enough wall space for that Chris. Right. Well, Chris and Carl, I want to thank you guys are coming on the show. This has been good. I can

[01:28:27] Carl, I appreciate like another point of view on perspective. I think you are a true trooper to allow. I mean, you must you're you're dating one of pinball's greatest sort of resources and

[01:28:43] historians and enthusiasts and I'm glad that he's infiltrated your home with with the workshop and jewelry quality game. So keep him going.

[01:28:57] And we'll get you guys back on the show soon. I think there's going to be a lot a lot to talk about next year. And I know there's going to be a lot of.

[01:29:04] And I've seen some stuff. There's going to be a lot of amazing art packages and the games are going to keep looking better because as competition heats up.

[01:29:13] Games have to visually pop like never before. So I think Carl, you're going to be really, really excited by what comes out in the next couple of years.

[01:29:22] Absolutely. And I'll be more knowledgeable to you. Right. Right.

[01:29:26] You know, I learned everything in two years that she's trying. Well, if you finish writing that book.

[01:29:34] This has been a long time coming, can you make a long time?

[01:29:37] Believe me, he will. I get on his case all the time and I said, I want that book.

[01:29:43] Right. Right. Well, we'll talk soon. And Chris, maybe we should we should discuss making some like YouTube, like documentary style stuff.

[01:29:52] Because I do think there's so many stories that we could visually tell the the tale without making people turn pages.

[01:30:02] So it's an 80 culture. You should make sure you're letting the viewers. We will be getting another video up here before Christmas.

[01:30:11] And the rows of Eragon here, Carl will be doing the narration for Paragon. We're going to be actually doing the tutorial review for that game.

[01:30:20] So she's doing it. I'm just I'm going to be behind the camera usually usually and behind the camera.

[01:30:26] I was wearing my PJs. You know, feel me. Right. Right.

[01:30:29] Right. Right. Right. This time I will be in front of the camera. Right. Right.

[01:30:32] It's her it's her dream game. So she gets the full meal deal treatment. Right. Awesome. Well, guys have a happy, happy holidays.
