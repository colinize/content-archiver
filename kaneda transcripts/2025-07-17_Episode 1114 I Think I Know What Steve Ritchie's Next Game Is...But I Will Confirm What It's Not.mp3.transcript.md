[00:00] I'm a Bobby girl in the Bobby world,

[00:04] Life in Plants, Wings, It's fantastic!

[00:07] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up!

[00:30] I'm gonna tell you right now, I think I have a pretty good idea what the next Jersey Jack machine is gonna be.

[00:48] It's a Steve Richie game.

[00:50] I have a really good sense of what this title is gonna be.

[00:55] And I'm curious to see how the pinball community responds to this.

[01:01] Because it's like one of those things where on paper, I think it sounds like a really good idea.

[01:08] Avatar on paper, really good idea.

[01:13] But then I think about who we are, what you really wanna own, what you're gonna free up space for,

[01:21] and what you're emotionally drawn to.

[01:25] And I don't know, I feel like it might be another Avatar situation.

[01:32] Now I'm not gonna reveal what I think it is just yet.

[01:36] I wanna do a little bit more confirming and snooping around.

[01:41] This is what Canada does in these slow summer months.

[01:45] I'm not snooping around American Pinball.

[01:48] I don't care about Cuphead.

[01:50] It's not gonna be successful.

[01:53] It will be the final game from American Pinball.

[01:57] I'm not snooping around Turner, Pinball, Chris Turner, where are you?

[02:01] I know you're listening to this.

[02:03] You popped into the chat for just a little bit.

[02:06] Where are the Merlin arcades?

[02:09] He's gotta sell those games.

[02:11] Am I snooping around Spooky Pinball?

[02:14] Some distributors, Joe Newhart, I'm talking about you brother.

[02:17] They're starting to take a list of people who are interested in the next Spooky game.

[02:25] Joe, that game is sold out.

[02:29] Do you really need an interest list?

[02:32] If they make a thousand or less Beetlejuice games with Christopher Franci on artwork,

[02:40] in this pinball world in which so many companies out there

[02:44] have delivered games with no nostalgic value,

[02:48] this game is sold out already.

[02:52] It's already spoken for.

[02:54] If they sold out of Evil Dead, which is a theme not nearly as popular as Beetlejuice or Gremlins.

[03:02] A lot of Gremlins haters out there, I've noticed that.

[03:05] Go back and watch Gremlins.

[03:08] It's such a good movie.

[03:11] Same with Goonies, same with Beetlejuice.

[03:14] Way more appeal to most of us than Evil Dead 1 and 2.

[03:18] And look what they did with it.

[03:20] Look what they did with that game.

[03:22] It is shaping up to be the best buy of the year.

[03:27] So yeah, Canada is also taking an interest level list on the next game from Spooky Pinball.

[03:34] Joe Newhart, I texted him today, hey Joe, put Canada at the top of that list.

[03:40] Do I buy it from Joe? Do I buy it from Melissa?

[03:43] I know Bug and Luke will hold the game for me. I could go right to the source.

[03:47] The thing is when you know the mayor, you don't need to be friends with the cops.

[03:53] And that's why I love Spooky Pinball. You can go right to the source.

[03:57] I mean come on, it's a little premature to get on the list.

[04:00] We know people want it.

[04:02] And Joe can thank me because it was Canada's live that uncovered the fact that Spooky Pinball had 25 games left to sell.

[04:09] They had like 25 or 30 games left.

[04:11] Mike at Automated bought 5 and Joe Newhart bought the rest.

[04:16] But it's because I was doing my show.

[04:18] My cut for those final games sold $0.

[04:22] But it might get Canada at the top of that list.

[04:25] They're listening to this right now in Benton, Wisconsin, and they're not in their heads.

[04:30] They're like, yeah, it was Canada.

[04:33] It's always been Canada.

[04:35] We wouldn't be where we are if it weren't for Canada.

[04:38] That's how every Pinball manufacturer feels.

[04:42] Well, at least that's how I think about it in my head.

[04:45] Alright, so Jersey Jack's next one.

[04:47] Now here's another interesting thing.

[04:49] And I've been saying this for a couple years now.

[04:52] I know that Jersey Jack was interested in making a game targeting a different demographic.

[04:59] And if you were going to make a game that targeted a different demographic

[05:04] and you wanted to make it a lower volume run, would there be no better theme than Barbie?

[05:12] And I've been saying this and I'll say it again.

[05:15] Barbie without sell.

[05:17] It would sell more units than Elton John, Godfather, Avatar combined.

[05:24] So three of those games, which they spent so many years and put so much effort behind,

[05:30] Barbie without sell all of them.

[05:32] And in fact, I think, I'm just going to say this, I think Barbie would be one of the best selling Pinball machines ever.

[05:42] When you talk about the amount of people out there who are into arcades and into vids,

[05:48] go look at how many more Ms. Pac-Man sold than Pac-Man.

[05:54] Now you're going to say, well, Ms. Pac-Man's a better game and it's still Pac-Man.

[05:58] All that's true.

[05:59] My point is this, the people out there in the world with disposable income that have little girls that love Barbie,

[06:08] what do you think they're going to buy?

[06:10] What would they put into their game room?

[06:12] You know me, I love the color pink.

[06:14] Talk about a game that would stand out in a lineup.

[06:18] You know, I'm just saying you would sell way more Barbies than John Wicks than Venoms.

[06:24] The thing is Barbie's not cheap and that's probably the number one reason there is not a Barbie Pinball machine,

[06:30] but there should be.

[06:31] And it's not like they don't license out the damn theme.

[06:34] They put that damn license on everything.

[06:37] So it's definitely gettable.

[06:39] It's just going to be expensive.

[06:41] And I think these companies are scared to test that territory.

[06:45] I'm telling you, if Barbie comes out, can it is a buyer.

[06:48] You know, I keep thinking about how beautiful the Jersey Jack platform is.

[06:52] mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

[07:22] The Matrix. It is not Top Gun Maverick. It is not Sonic the Hedgehog. It is not Super Mario Brothers.

[07:31] It is none of those. It is not a music pin. So it is not the Beastie Boys.

[07:38] All of those things I just said you all would most likely want and you would buy. Do I wish it

[07:45] was all those things? Yes. Do I like all of those properties I just mentioned more than what I think

[07:53] it might be? Yeah I do. But you know what's interesting about this hobby and I'm sure you

[07:59] all feel this. Games keep coming out. So if a game comes out and I don't want it it's not like

[08:05] that's our only option. If Godfather comes out and I have absolutely no desire to own it. Same

[08:11] thing with Avatar. Well Stern's going to give me three other titles I might want to consider.

[08:16] Spooky's going to give me a title I might want to consider. Chicago Gaming Company will reveal a

[08:21] game that will take two years to get. But other than that really there's not that much else that

[08:26] you can actually get your hands on and really want. You know I asked a major distributor out there

[08:32] not going to name names. Now I know a lot of them. How many predators did you sell? You know what

[08:37] they said? Two. Two predators. I mean if this isn't a potentially company ending game for Pinball

[08:46] Brothers I don't know what they're going to do. And by the time they get this Arnold List Predator

[08:52] on the line we're going to see Star Wars with the assets. Would you rather buy a $15,000 Predator

[09:01] with no Arnold or Harry Potter for 10 or Star Wars with the assets or how about the other 40 to 50

[09:10] games you could go get now at a much better price than they were like four years ago and just have

[09:16] Pinball fun. Because Pinball doesn't keep evolving. Like there's nothing in Predator. There's nothing

[09:22] that Pinball Brothers are bringing to the table. That is better than what the other companies have.

[09:29] I would rather have a dialed in LE for $6,000 to $7,000 than a Predator. All of these stern

[09:38] premiums now James Bond, John Wick, Foo Fighters, you name it almost every single stern premium now

[09:46] is sliding back down to $7,500 bucks. And all of a sudden it's like okay the market has corrected

[09:55] itself. All of the LE's for the most part are sliding down to 10. That's the highest they ever

[10:02] should have been. So now you can go get a lot of great stuff for a much better price. And the market

[10:10] is really soft. It's especially soft in the summertime. And there's a variety of reasons.

[10:15] It's like people are spending more money in the summertime. You're traveling. You just don't

[10:20] have the time. You're not thinking about staying inside and playing your pinball machines.

[10:26] Speaking about staying inside and playing pinball machines, I was in the Alice's Adventures in

[10:31] Wonderland thread. And I'm reading about this game. And I'm always curious about Alice. You know

[10:36] I'm friends with Melvin. You know what's some funny thing happened. And I don't know what's going on

[10:41] over there at Dutch. But they made these games for the US. I think there's like 25 US games.

[10:48] And something was wired incorrectly. And it's a funny thing that was wired incorrectly. It was the

[10:54] out lane spinners. They had the wires backwards. So the spinner was spinning in the wrong direction.

[11:01] It's supposed to save your ball. Instead the spinners were spinning the ball into the out lanes.

[11:08] And some of the owners that were getting the game were like wait this doesn't make any sense. I

[11:12] thought this is supposed to help me stay alive. And they were sharing video of how when the ball

[11:17] would hit the spinner, it was getting kicked into the out lane. Easy fix. But man, how do you wire

[11:24] that wrong at the factory, Barry? Come on. Do I need to send over another pizza party? But overwhelmingly

[11:31] the response to people that have Alice and keep in mind, it's 25 people. Stern makes 25 games

[11:41] by lunchtime. And people have waited like six, seven months to get these games. Now, I don't

[11:48] know what's going to happen with tariffs and the manufacturing schedule and the toppers on this game.

[11:56] But what I do hear people saying is how beautiful the game is, which we knew, but also just it's

[12:04] unique in a lineup. And you know how I feel about this game. I've said it all along. It's not the

[12:09] best of anything, but it's different. And what Dutch has made is something that does feel like

[12:17] you're playing an occasion. It creates an occasion when you play Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,

[12:24] because there's just nothing else like it in the market. And I think that's one of the things that's

[12:29] sort of working against both Jersey Jack and Stern a little bit, is it always just feels like more

[12:36] of the same. And they're two big companies. And you know, it's hard to sort of move in unique

[12:42] directions if you are big, you don't want to take too much of a risk. I think Stern suffers from this

[12:48] more than Jersey Jack. I think when you put Jersey Jack games in a lineup, you see a lot more variety,

[12:55] variety of themes, variety of artwork, variety of layout, variety of toys, everything about a Jersey

[13:02] Jack just feels like they've got more variety and they have far fewer games than Stern. When you

[13:08] put Sterns in a lineup, they all do look sort of the same. And it's not just like the artwork. Look,

[13:15] and I'm not saying that's a bad thing. Like they look good in a lineup, but it also does suffer a

[13:21] little bit from a sea of sameness. So for those of you out there that just want something different,

[13:27] if I were to use a car argument, it's like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland are like people that

[13:33] just want to buy a sob, you know, they just don't want to be in what everybody else is in. I wish

[13:39] we had more of that in pinball. I wish we had more of that that was successful. I would say

[13:45] multi morphic is trying to be that, but it's not a successful execution of a different platform

[13:53] that's just unique. It absolutely has a lot of innovation in it. It has a lot of engineering in

[13:59] it, but it's just not clicking. And look, it's not just me saying this, like where are the unboxings

[14:06] of portal that game has been out what since March, April, May, June, July, five months, six months,

[14:13] where are all the portal unboxings? Are you seeing them? Am I missing them? And this whole thing of

[14:20] like, we're going to show a game, half a year goes by a year goes by and hardly anybody has the product.

[14:29] It's just weird to me. And it's another reason why you should just wait and see because portal

[14:35] is also a really expensive game. Let the multi morphic people buy it new and box.

[14:41] Let them take the huge hit. And then I love it when the multi morphic guys want to sell like

[14:48] eight games with the platform. And you know, these guys are like now like 30 grand in on all these

[14:54] are like, they'll take like 17,000 or 15,000. They're never going to get back even close to what they

[15:01] put into the platform. And now the new games like portal on its own as just a kit is like five to

[15:08] $6,000. That's insane. It's almost like the price of an entire stern pro and you're stuck with it.

[15:15] And if you want to sell the platform, you're going to take a huge loss on everything you own.

[15:19] I just wish there was more. Think about it. Like what about Chicago gaming company?

[15:23] Doesn't it feel like what three years ago, Pulp Fiction was revealed? All right. So they

[15:29] fulfilled the Pulp Fiction orders. I think they're pretty much close to being done with Pulp Fiction.

[15:35] Then they're going to do another run like the third or fourth run, if you will,

[15:40] of medieval madness. Okay. When's that happening? It's July 17th. And then what?

[15:47] Isn't Mark Ritchie working on Halo forever and a day? Like what's up with these companies? Like

[15:53] they just can't get their acts together. So when you really think about it, I know there's like

[15:58] 15 pinball companies out there, but the truth is there's really only like four that are consistently

[16:07] executing the right way. Stern pinball, Jersey Jack pinball, Spooky pinball. Okay.

[16:14] Once you get even those three out of the way, who is next? Like who consistently delivers on an

[16:23] annual basis? Great games that don't make their customers wait forever. Who really? Is it just

[16:31] a three horse race? I mean, am I missing anybody? Not American pinball. Barrels of fun. I mean,

[16:38] look, it's only their second game, but man, like where the dune unboxings slowly, like slowly

[16:45] trickling out games. I mean, people were emailing me this weekend, like Barrels of Fun is selling

[16:51] damaged cabinets. And they're like, this is a sign that this company is having issues and

[16:56] cash flow problems. I'm like, I don't know. Maybe they're just trying to sell their damaged

[17:01] cabinets. I don't know who's in the market for a damaged cabinet. And I don't really get it.

[17:05] Like if you order cabinets from your vendor and some of them are damaged, wouldn't you get a refund

[17:12] on those damaged ones? Or are you damaging them yourselves? And that's why you can't use them.

[17:18] Might be a little bit of both, but I wouldn't say Barrels is like crushing it. I think the dune

[17:24] launch was a little strange. I think the dune launch didn't really go according to plan. They

[17:31] launched it on top of King Kong. I wouldn't even have done that. I mean, you know, it's kind of

[17:36] weird, right? Because like King Kong didn't really take off, but it was like, there was just too much

[17:40] happening at once. Right now would have been a good time to release dune. The code would have been

[17:46] further along. You would have had more attention on it. I do think a game like dune really did need

[17:54] a pinball show. It really needed to be at a high traffic pinball show with a captivated audience.

[18:03] And I think if they had waited, I think it would have had a stronger reveal. The problem is there

[18:08] was no real show to wait for. They kind of missed their backyard show at TPF. And then there really

[18:15] wasn't another large show to appear at. So it's going to be a slow burn. I'm assuming they probably

[18:22] have enough orders to get them to expo at least. And so, you know, they're probably making, I don't

[18:29] know how many a week, 20 a week, 15 a week, 30 a week. Nobody tells me. I'm never sure what the

[18:35] real capacity is at these boutique companies. I know we want to see more from them. When it comes

[18:41] to barrels of fun, for me, the main thing is the themes. I'm just not sure they understand what the

[18:47] pinball buying community wants. And the reason I say that is simply this. And I say this to my

[18:50] friends over there, and they're listening to this. I say this, like, you guys should know what people

[18:55] want. And your sophomore game, you put a lot into it. But it should have been a theme that easily

[19:02] moved you 800 to 1000 units easily. If you picked a theme that people wanted and people just didn't

[19:10] want Dune. So barrels of fun is not lighting the boutique world on fire right now. Dutch pinball

[19:15] is not either, right? It's like slowly trickling these Alice's out. So it really is kind of like a

[19:22] three horse race. And spooky Jersey Jack and Stern, you know, those are the ones that have been the

[19:28] most consistent recently. They're the ones that release games with the most cadence. It doesn't

[19:34] mean they always make the best games. Stern has just as many misses as hits. I think Stern has more

[19:40] misses than hits recently. And that is why I think they're going to go back to the Star Wars. Well,

[19:45] we're going to see Star Wars sometime end of August, early September usually, but it's definitely

[19:51] feeling like a slower summer. I was just on Naps Arcade yesterday. Jason, congratulations on launching

[19:58] the new website. His kids worked on this with him. There is now a lot more stuff you can do with Jason

[20:06] Naps and Naps Arcade. He's got a forum. He's got a marketplace. He's got the blog still. The blog is

[20:12] still free. So if you want to go on Naps Arcade and get all your free news, you're still going to be

[20:17] able to do it. I did give him some marketing advice because to get to the forum is a five dollar

[20:22] donation or five dollar subscription, if you will. And you know, it's hard to get people to buy something

[20:28] they haven't experienced yet. And I gave them like the real, real as like, look, Jason, when it comes

[20:33] to getting people to donate, which I've done successfully with my podcast, you got to let

[20:39] people know what they're going to get. They've got to experience it sometimes for free and then

[20:44] charge because I think if he charged five dollars a month for the entire thing, most people would

[20:50] sign up. I would sign up. I want the news. I'm going to sign up anyway and show my support because I

[20:55] love what he does for the hobby and I know how much work goes into it. None of you really get how

[21:01] much work does go into it because you simply wake up every day, two to three days a week. You have a

[21:07] new Canadian Spinball podcast. Every day you can go on NAPS Arcade and get entertained. There's a lot

[21:13] of work. There's a lot of work that goes into it. It's not like Pinside where I don't see Pinside as

[21:19] a lot of work. They don't do any moderation. All the work is being done by the hyper users and then

[21:26] he's just making so much money off of the traffic. Where's the hard work? I don't understand how that's

[21:31] hard work. Congratulations, Jason. For those of you listening, let's throw some support Jason's way.

[21:38] I think he has the greatest and really the only pinball news website you need to go to

[21:44] that allows each and every one of us to avoid Pinside. I want to end this show by saying our

[21:50] thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Rob Anthony. Some of my really good

[21:55] friends were super close to Rob. He unfortunately passed away, I believe a couple days ago.

[22:02] Really, really sad. He was always a great member of this community. He was always filled with so

[22:07] much enthusiasm at the pinball shows. A dog lover, a great man and it sucks. I always say to

[22:14] everybody out there, life is really short. The friendships we make in this hobby are what matter

[22:19] the most. We can't take any of these games with us. Nobody up there in heaven cares about limited

[22:25] editions versus pros. Take care of yourselves. You never know when your time is up, but you can

[22:32] definitely every day make a little bit of a decision to put your health over everything else. It's

[22:38] so important and sometimes this hobby can be really sedentary. I always say as many times as you

[22:44] play pinball, do pushups. As many times as you post on Pinside, do a pull up and just try to take

[22:50] care of yourselves a little bit each day and it will go a long way because you never know what's

[22:54] going to happen. It doesn't even matter. You can be in the best shape of your life. You could be a

[22:58] vegan and you could just wake up the next day, feel something on your body and in four months

[23:03] you're gone. I've seen it happen to people. Everybody be good. Thank you for being a member

[23:08] of Canadian Pinball Podcast in this three horse race where everybody else is trying. They're all

[23:14] trying. I can't wait to tell you what I think the next Jersey Jack game is going to be. I think

[23:19] it's not going to hurt Harry Potter sales at all. I'll just say that later.
