[00:00] Alright everybody, finally, finally, the back to the future people can shut up, it's

[00:26] not going to be back to the future, we heard today from Stern Pimball that it is going to

[00:30] be James Bond 007 is coming out next week from Stern Pimball.

[00:38] There was a lot of debate whether or not it would be Venom or this game, as I was talking

[00:43] about more recently, I thought it would be James Bond because of all of the 60th anniversary

[00:49] stuff going on with 007.

[00:52] So what do I think about this game?

[00:54] Well I haven't seen it.

[00:55] I don't know much about it other than I think it's going to be Sean Connery based, I think

[01:02] there are going to be four movies that the game is based on, I think there is going to

[01:07] be an Aston Martin mech in the game that's going to be the major mech.

[01:11] I also think this is going to be a game in which Stern is going to get assets from the

[01:16] movie.

[01:17] I don't think this is going to be another one of these like muted clips, right, where

[01:21] we don't see the actors and the actresses actually speaking to us.

[01:25] If I just sort of anticipate the way this game is going to feel, I think it's going

[01:29] to be a lot like Batman 66.

[01:32] I think it's going to shoot better than Batman 66, but I think there's going to be a lot

[01:37] of what you love in James Bond coming through in the game.

[01:41] I think they're going to really make this game very campy, very funny, and very engaging

[01:47] if you're a fan of the franchise.

[01:49] I also think this game is going to shoot well.

[01:51] I think Gomez has had a lot of time to put into this game.

[01:56] Part of me feels like because George Gomez took this game over from Steve Ritchie and

[02:01] Steve Ritchie has gone on the record to say a lot of nasty stuff about Stern.

[02:05] I don't think that really impacts George.

[02:07] I don't think he cares about that.

[02:09] I think he's busy running the biggest pinball company in the world, but I do think George

[02:14] Gomez is going to make this a little bit of a statement game to his friend Steve and say,

[02:19] look at what we can do.

[02:20] Look at what we have done and look at what I've done with this property that you were

[02:24] originally working on.

[02:26] So I do think this is going to be a game that's going to have some fun toys in it.

[02:30] You know, here's why I'm really excited about James Bond.

[02:32] I am excited that this is a George Gomez pin.

[02:34] I do like George Gomez games.

[02:36] I'm also really excited because modern day Sterns, if we think about Stern lately, they're

[02:42] a company that's putting a lot more into their games.

[02:45] They seem to be firing on all cylinders recently.

[02:48] And there's so many talented people in Stern pinball.

[02:52] And when they get passionate about a project, and I mean this, when there's real passion

[02:56] behind a project over at Stern, they tend to deliver and they tend to bring out something

[03:01] pretty special and they tend to do the franchise justice.

[03:06] So I do think this is a game where if you like 1960s James Bond, they're going to deliver

[03:12] a game that you're really going to want.

[03:14] How do I think this game is going to do when it's released next week?

[03:17] I think it's going to be bonkers.

[03:18] I really do.

[03:19] I think this is going to be a day one sell out.

[03:22] I think this is going to be a game that a lot of people are going to want to get.

[03:25] I think it's been a really bad year for pinball releases.

[03:28] I don't think there's been a pinball release since Rush.

[03:32] And Rush arguably was kind of like last year.

[03:34] I don't think there's been a pinball release all year that has gotten people very excited.

[03:39] And I think you've got this entire community just wanting to be excited about a pin.

[03:45] I think you've got everybody in pinball just waiting to gush over a title.

[03:49] And without even seeing this game yet, I know this is going to sound crazy.

[03:52] Without even seeing this game, I'm already going to predict that James Bond from Stern

[03:58] Pinball is going to win the Twippy for best pinball machine of 2022 simply because I know

[04:06] every other machine that's come out this year has been underwhelming.

[04:10] And so I do think that everyone is going to move towards this game like a moth to a flame.

[04:16] And even if you don't like the James Bond theme, I think it's going to win you over because

[04:21] it's going to be campy.

[04:23] It's going to be fun.

[04:24] And those are two really important elements for pinball.

[04:28] James Bond is also just an iconic IP.

[04:32] Now, whether you like the Sean Connery movies or not, it's still James Bond, right?

[04:36] If you look at the pinball demographic, what do you want to have callouts from?

[04:41] James Bond or Bo Peep?

[04:43] And so on this level, I think a lot of guys are going to be really into this theme.

[04:48] When you also look at pinball as a global marketplace, James Bond has a humongous global

[04:54] following.

[04:55] And I think people in Europe and other parts of the world that love James Bond, they're

[05:00] really going to want this pin.

[05:02] And I know my friend Neil McCrae over in the UK, he's really, really, really going to

[05:06] want this pin.

[05:08] And so for all those pinheads in the UK, this is a dream theme for them.

[05:12] I'm trying to think like what are the weaknesses of this game we haven't even seen yet.

[05:16] There might be some people out there that would argue that old James Bond didn't really

[05:21] age well, that the themes in the movies aren't really aligned with the current like wokeness

[05:26] of culture.

[05:28] I think Stern's smart.

[05:29] I don't think we're going to see clips of like James Bond like smacking women around

[05:33] and then all of a sudden they're in bed together.

[05:35] You know, I think they're going to leave all of that stuff out.

[05:37] I think what you're going to get a plethora of the sense of humor and the campiness of

[05:41] old James Bond.

[05:42] Here's why I also think James Bond is going to be a really good theme for pinball.

[05:47] I think it's a really simple story to understand.

[05:50] You're playing as James Bond and you're trying to defeat the bad guys from each movie.

[05:56] It's very similar to Batman and Robin and you're trying to jail the villains.

[06:00] So I think when you walk up to this game, it's going to be pretty easy to communicate

[06:05] and articulate to people what the goal of the game is.

[06:10] You know, and how cool is it you're playing as James Bond.

[06:13] You need to go through these four James Bond movies and defeat the bad guys.

[06:17] It's almost like the rule set starts to just write itself.

[06:20] You know, it's like you get to multi-ball when you're battling a boss from each movie.

[06:24] If you successfully defeat each of the four bosses or villains, then you get to like a

[06:29] wizard mode.

[06:30] You know, you start to see like, this is what pinball should be.

[06:32] This is why I've always said pinball needs to be easier to understand and easier to follow.

[06:37] And it needs to make sense for the property.

[06:40] It's another reason why I like Toy Story is such a big miss for so many people because

[06:43] Toy Story is not a movie about a carousel.

[06:46] And then you make a pinball machine about a carousel.

[06:49] You know, it's just hard.

[06:50] You know, everyone would rather be James Bond.

[06:52] Like I only want to be Buzz if I'm going to pizza planet.

[06:55] I only want to be Buzz if I'm trying to save Woody from Sid's backyard.

[06:58] I don't want to be Buzz in Toy Story 4 because he's just a buried character in the background.

[07:03] But I think people are waiting.

[07:05] I think people have been thirsty for a new game from Stern Pinball and it's finally here.

[07:10] It's finally here and it's coming out in September of 2022.

[07:14] You know, we're also hearing rumors that this release is going to come with a price increase.

[07:19] Now I thought they were going to keep the price the same.

[07:21] You know, but it's obvious that the cost of operations keeps going up and up and up.

[07:25] I don't like it.

[07:26] I don't want to see these games get any more expensive.

[07:29] You know, I just don't want to spend another four or 500 bucks on a pro premium and Ali.

[07:33] Now when Stern does a price increase, they usually do it across the board.

[07:37] And I think we're going to see Ali's this time be like 11.5 and premiums be 9.5.

[07:42] I mean, it's crazy.

[07:43] Like a pro is now going to be like 7,200 bucks like for a stern pro.

[07:48] And you know what's interesting about all these price increases is like they used to

[07:51] happen gradually.

[07:53] Now just a few years later, they're 50% more than when games like Ghostbusters came out.

[07:59] 50% more for a stern Ali.

[08:01] But even with all that in mind, the frenzy to get one's going to be crazy.

[08:06] Like even if they make a thousand of them, I'm already seeing the FOMO setting in today.

[08:12] Like people are nervous.

[08:13] They don't know if they can get one.

[08:15] Stern sent out an email how they're going to have a few for sale on Stern's website.

[08:19] Those are going to sell out in just a matter of seconds.

[08:22] It would have been fun for Stern to do a few creative things.

[08:24] You know, you've got this rich collector community.

[08:27] It would have been funny if Stern said, if any of you out there own an Aston Martin,

[08:31] we will allocate a game to you.

[08:32] Right?

[08:33] I know that's like favoring the rich, but it would just be funny.

[08:35] You know, I think people would get it.

[08:36] Like how many of you listening to this right now have an Aston Martin that collect pinball?

[08:42] Probably not many, if any of you.

[08:43] I don't know.

[08:44] I just think this game is going to be good.

[08:45] I think it's going to be a winner for Stern.

[08:48] I'm not going to overhype it.

[08:49] I hope I haven't overhyped it here.

[08:51] As you can see, I think I'm coming down with a little bit of a cold.

[08:53] So I'm a little bit strained.

[08:54] My voice is a little bit strained.

[08:56] I'm a little bit tired.

[08:57] Our nanny is on vacation.

[08:59] And so Brendan, myself are juggling doing work and watching out for Killian and a Stern

[09:04] pinball machine is coming out all happening at the same time.

[09:07] The good news is this.

[09:08] Now that this game is back, I will be doing my Saturday morning spectacular is again on

[09:13] Facebook, a lot to talk about.

[09:16] I think this game is going to be a home run for Stern pinball.

[09:19] Doesn't it make total sense now?

[09:21] Why spooky wanted to get those TNA orders in last week?

[09:24] Because now who's going to go buy a toy story this week?

[09:28] You know, who's going to put money aside for American pinball's next game?

[09:31] And then the next game from pinball brothers, Queen Pinball.

[09:33] What is going to happen right now with the launch of this game?

[09:36] Whether you like James Bond or not, there's no denying the fact that millions of dollars

[09:41] are going to flow towards Stern pinball.

[09:43] And that millions of dollars now can't flow towards other pinball companies.

[09:48] I think we're headed for a period in pinball right now where the brief is really simple.

[09:53] You need to make a great game.

[09:56] People want.

[09:57] And if you're going to make a small run of a pinball machine, that's fine.

[10:00] But you got to make sure there's a small enough market that wants what you're making.

[10:04] And I think the pressure is going to be on American pinball more than any other company this fall.

[10:10] The pinball brothers, like, I don't know, like, I don't really know, like, what they're

[10:14] planning to sell with Queen Pinball.

[10:16] I don't think it's going to sell that well.

[10:17] Home pin with spinal tap.

[10:19] This is horrible news for them because there's only so much money to go around.

[10:24] And in a community like this, when there's only so much money to go around and only so much

[10:30] room you have in your home, you're going to want to buy the best pinball possible for the money.

[10:35] And it almost kills me to say this.

[10:38] As expensive as these stern machines are now, I can't look at anyone else that's doing it

[10:44] better than they are.

[10:45] And I think this game is going to come out.

[10:47] There's going to be no shenanigans.

[10:49] And every single person who orders an L.E. is going to have their L.E.

[10:53] by the end of October.

[10:55] Like, that's incredible.

[10:56] And it's exciting to see Stern come back to the hobby like this.

[11:00] And this hobby is super boring without stern pinball.

[11:03] And I can't wait to see this game.

[11:05] And I can't wait to give you my first impressions on James Bond pinball next week.

[11:10] And hopefully I will have more of my voice back.

[11:13] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[11:16] Even when I'm exhausted, I'm always going to put the mic on and give you my thoughts as

[11:21] things happen in the pinball world.

[11:23] Everybody have a great day.

[11:24] James Bond is coming.

[11:25] Get your wallets ready, people.

[11:27] Later.
