[00:00] Will a simple kind of life never did me no harm, a raise of me a family and working on a farm?

[00:04] My days are all filled with an easy country charm, thank God I'm a country boy.

[00:13] Welcome everybody to Canadians Pinball Podcast, the world's favorite Patreon podcast.

[00:19] I want to give a big shout out to the two knuckleheads listening right now, Big Matt and Little Matt.

[00:25] Thank you guys for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[00:27] I also want to give a huge shout out to our K-Time Jonathan over there.

[00:31] He is now joining Steve Jablonski at $100 a month.

[00:35] I'm so happy all of you guys are enjoying this show and everyone listening is subscribing

[00:40] to Canada's Pinball Podcast because now it's getting serious.

[00:44] Canada is a homeowner.

[00:45] Yes, we found a home in Connecticut.

[00:48] There's not much room for pinball machines.

[00:50] There's not a lot of room for the demon, but I'm going to sneak a pinball machine into

[00:54] the house and I think the demon has to show up into this Connecticut town.

[00:59] We'll talk more about that.

[01:00] We'll talk a lot more about the house of Canada and moving the family to the suburbs

[01:05] and what it's going to mean for Canada's Pinball Podcast, but it's not going to change

[01:09] much.

[01:10] We're still going to do this show every single week.

[01:12] So let's talk about Jaws Pinball, the number one pinball machine of all time.

[01:17] It enters the pinside top 100 with like 208 votes.

[01:23] All of a sudden everyone's like Jaws.

[01:25] Is it number one?

[01:27] Everybody needs to stop giving much weight to the pinside top 100.

[01:31] Here's the way we all should be thinking about the pinside top 100.

[01:36] It's like the billboard top 100, but imagine if the music industry only had five new songs

[01:43] a year and that's what the pinball industry is like.

[01:46] So when a new game comes out, it's like a new song coming out and if the song is good,

[01:52] it's going to enter the charts at number one.

[01:54] Same way with Jaws pinball because the only people that have it right now are people that

[01:59] own the machine.

[02:00] So you're getting 200 people who own the machine that want to justify their purchases with

[02:06] a very good rating.

[02:07] It has like a 9.2 rating, but what will happen much like the billboard top 100 music is over

[02:14] time as more games come out and more people play this game on location and at friends

[02:20] houses.

[02:21] Jaws will slide down the list.

[02:23] It's not going to stay the number one game of all time.

[02:26] It is not the greatest pinball machine ever made.

[02:29] It is not Keith Owens greatest game to date, but hey, it's a brand new game.

[02:34] The honeymoon period is happening right now.

[02:36] I just love the fact that the pinside 100 always triggers people.

[02:41] Let me tell you this and I was talking to a distributor.

[02:43] The pinside 100 does matter because you know who does look at it.

[02:47] It's not you.

[02:48] It's not fans of the canada club.

[02:50] It's absolute newbies who have no idea what game they should get.

[02:55] So imagine if you're brand new to pinball, right?

[02:57] You stumble into this hobby, you get bit by the bug and you want to know what are the

[03:01] best pinball machines I should consider owning.

[03:04] You might end up there and you might see Jaws number one.

[03:07] And I actually heard from somebody that sold in Elton John and the guy canceled his order

[03:13] and ordered a Jaws instead because he's like, I want the best pinball machine ever made.

[03:19] And Elton John is not number one on the list.

[03:22] And I kind of almost want newbies like that to get burned and make stupid decisions like

[03:26] that because ultimately you should play every single game.

[03:30] You should never go off of like the pinside 100.

[03:33] You shouldn't even listen to too much of what other people say.

[03:37] And even if you get recommendations, make sure you play a game.

[03:40] Make sure you love a game because for these prices, if you go in on anything, you better

[03:45] make sure you love it or you're going to be burned real soon in the secondhand marketary.

[03:49] So what's going on in the world of pinball?

[03:51] Well look, we're three to four weeks away from three new games.

[03:55] We're going to get in the following order, Funhouse.

[03:58] I know that the game has been submitted.

[04:00] The reason why we haven't seen Funhouse yet and Kari Hardy hasn't unboxed it and Andrea

[04:05] Padretti hasn't shown the world why he's remaking this game first is that Rick over

[04:10] at Planetary has to approve the game.

[04:13] And that's one of the things that people forget.

[04:15] When you remake a planetary pinball game or a Balli Williams classic game where Rick has

[04:21] the rights to the game, he has to approve it before you can show the game and reveal

[04:26] it to the world.

[04:27] You want to know what I heard?

[04:28] I heard that Centaur was submitted to Rick over at Planetary for approval and it did

[04:34] not get approved, which means there's work to be done on the game, which is even more

[04:38] laughable that they took money on that game like seven months ago and it doesn't even

[04:43] have final permission to be sold to customers.

[04:46] So you were never getting those games in January, people.

[04:49] All of that was a big lie.

[04:50] Alright, so we got Funhouse coming out.

[04:53] I think Funhouse is going to be a little bit dead on arrival.

[04:56] I really don't think there's going to be a huge market.

[04:59] I don't care what you do with the artwork.

[05:01] I don't think there's going to be a huge market for an $11,000 Funhouse.

[05:05] And the standard edition is probably the way to go, but here's the issue.

[05:09] You could still go get a perfectly well-conditioned Funhouse for much less money than that.

[05:14] I mean, these games were trading for like $5,000 to $6,000.

[05:18] And so to get someone to spend $11,000 on an Ellie of the Game, I think that's going

[05:24] to be really hard.

[05:25] But we should see this game in like a week or two.

[05:28] I know they wanted this thing to be out in February.

[05:31] They're well past the time they wanted to get the game out.

[05:34] I also think it's a colossal mistake to launch any game around a Stern launch.

[05:39] And even though Stern John Wick might be like three to four weeks out, you want to stay

[05:43] clear of launching any game when Stern's about to launch because Stern's going to beat you

[05:49] on manufacturing.

[05:50] There's no way around it.

[05:51] They're going to get those John Wick games into boxes.

[05:54] They're going to get them to customers way before Padready Gaming's going to do it.

[05:58] And why would anybody ever lock up a nonrefundable deposit on a Funhouse game?

[06:04] I think what I'm hearing is this.

[06:06] Those Funhouse machines, I bet most of them are made.

[06:09] I think we're going to see a few hundred Funhouses already in a box on day one.

[06:14] I think that's how they're going to have to do it.

[06:16] And I think it's smart, right?

[06:18] If the game is available today and there's no shenanigans, there's no like not knowing

[06:23] when you're going to get your game, there's no fumbling with the numbers of the game.

[06:27] I'm reading the Spooky thread.

[06:29] This is happening in the Spooky thread where like everyone's sort of confused.

[06:32] Like how did you bring game number 200 of like Looney Tunes to a show?

[06:38] And my number is lower than that.

[06:40] How come I didn't get my game yet?

[06:42] Now the reason they do that is that Spooky basically allocates their games.

[06:47] Some go to Europe, some go to distributors, and some go directly to customers.

[06:52] And while they do build the games in order, they basically allocate all of their games

[06:58] in numerical order.

[06:59] So if they're making 888 Looney Tunes, let's just think about this for a minute.

[07:04] The first 50 games might go direct, right?

[07:07] So one through 50 on the serial number games are going to go direct.

[07:11] Then maybe games 50 through 100 might go to Joe at PimballStar.

[07:16] Adding into the mix of that is like ButterCabinets might create some delays.

[07:21] So you might be game number 75 with the ButterCabinet.

[07:25] And you might actually be watching someone unbox game number like 85 ahead of you because

[07:31] you might be waiting for your ButterCabinet.

[07:33] Now look, I know Spooky does get as close as possible to making these games in numerical

[07:38] order and I like that.

[07:40] I never like it when you don't know, right?

[07:43] Jersey Jack will make the total number of games, but when it comes to their plaques and

[07:47] what number you are in terms of collector's edition.

[07:50] It's all random.

[07:52] Like I have Guns N' Roses number 500.

[07:54] That does not mean that my game was the last one off the line.

[07:58] I don't like that.

[07:59] I think it should be the last one off the line and even if you want a special order

[08:03] to your number, then you should just wait until your number is up in the queue.

[08:08] Because when you do it the other way, right?

[08:10] Let's take like Toy Story 4 for example.

[08:13] They didn't make a thousand Toy Story 4 CEs.

[08:16] They didn't make a thousand Godfather CEs, but we'll never know how many they actually

[08:21] made because someone might have serial number 1000 even though they only made maybe 500.

[08:28] And I think it should be more like cars.

[08:29] I'm going to use a car argument.

[08:31] The first game off the line should be game number one and the last game off the run should

[08:36] be the final number that that game is out of.

[08:39] So if you're going to make a thousand Godfather CEs, I don't want to see number 1000 on a

[08:45] game that was made right away just because you paid for that number.

[08:49] And paying for the number is stupid.

[08:50] Let's just end this practice.

[08:52] There's no reason why pinball companies should be selling you the number.

[08:57] If they want to give you number 12, remember Mr. Richie Ranch.

[09:00] He always had like Collectors Edition number 12.

[09:03] I'm fine with that.

[09:04] If you want to get number 12, then you always get game number 12, which is built after game

[09:09] number 11.

[09:10] But when you get to these dumb things where guys just want like 007.

[09:14] Let me break it to all of you guys and I've met you guys at shows.

[09:18] None of you look like James Bond.

[09:20] None of you should have serial number 007.

[09:22] All right, I said it.

[09:23] All right, so we got Funhouse coming out and then we've got Abba coming out April 6th in

[09:28] just like a week and a half.

[09:29] So we've got two new games coming out.

[09:32] Abba is coming out by the pinball brothers.

[09:34] It's the worst kept secret in pinball.

[09:36] We've seen the disco ball.

[09:38] We know it's Abba.

[09:39] A lot of questions about this game.

[09:41] I can't wait to see the game.

[09:43] It's an easy game for me to pass on.

[09:45] This is not the kind of music pin that I would go in on.

[09:48] I would much rather have an Elton John over Abba and I would much rather have guns and

[09:53] roses over Elton John.

[09:55] I just think we have so many music pins now or if you're going to pick a music pin that

[10:00] you want to be in your collection, it depends how big is your collection.

[10:04] How many games do you have?

[10:06] Now I would always prefer a story driven mode based pinball machine over a music pin.

[10:12] So when it comes to Fun House, Abba and John Wick, just by the pure nature of things, I

[10:18] think John Wick has me the most excited.

[10:21] It has me the most curious to see what Stern is going to do with John Wick because I've

[10:25] seen all four John Wick movies.

[10:28] They're super entertaining.

[10:29] I still don't think it's going to sell at these prices.

[10:32] I think there's going to be a lot of hesitation to go in on John Wick at these prices.

[10:37] Again, if John Wick was like 6,500, 7,500 and 9,500, I think a lot of us are looking at

[10:44] John Wick much differently than we are now because if you look at it now, how are you

[10:49] going to sell a thousand John Wick's at $13,000 of pop?

[10:54] It ain't going to happen.

[10:55] You know what also might not happen right now?

[10:58] Stern Pinball might not be for sale.

[11:00] So we've seen a lot of conversation around this.

[11:03] Have they updated the language?

[11:05] Is that old language?

[11:07] We all know that all good things come to an end.

[11:10] They do.

[11:12] One day, Canada Spinball Podcast will no longer be on the airwaves.

[11:16] One day, I will decide I've had enough.

[11:19] I'm moving on.

[11:20] There's too many of you that won't upgrade your subscriptions from $5 to $10.

[11:25] One day, I'll walk into McDonald's and a large fry will cost me $15.

[11:30] And I'll think, why am I breaking my back every week and people will only kick me $5

[11:35] a month for three shows a week?

[11:37] But we're not there yet.

[11:38] But all good things come to an end.

[11:41] And there's going to be a time in which George Gomez and Gary Stern will retire from Stern

[11:47] Pinball.

[11:48] And that is why when we see a character like Seth Davis come into the company, it has a

[11:53] lot of people wondering what is the future of Stern Pinball?

[11:58] Is Seth there simply to cook the books, get the numbers as high as possible, high as possible

[12:04] and you only do that when you want to become an acquisition target?

[12:08] And there is a lot of companies that could easily absorb Stern Pinball in the entertainment

[12:13] industry and in the amusement industry.

[12:15] This is a small, tiny little company.

[12:18] Heck, Leonard Abbess, with his own personal wealth, could easily afford to buy Stern Pinball.

[12:24] And so it's got a lot of people wondering what will happen.

[12:26] And I'm just going to say this.

[12:28] One day, George Gomez will be gone.

[12:30] Now I see the successor to George Gomez.

[12:33] The spiritual successor to George Gomez.

[12:35] If you were to ask me, who is it going to be?

[12:38] Who's the guy that knows how to design games?

[12:40] Who's the guy that knows what customers want?

[12:42] Who's the guy that's super talented?

[12:44] Who's the guy that's very likable?

[12:46] The guy that everybody in that company probably respects?

[12:49] I would have to say that George Gomez's successor would most likely be Keith Elwin.

[12:55] Now look, over the years, I'm sure Keith Elwin has developed a lot more business acumen working

[13:01] next to George Gomez and Gary and the investors.

[13:04] He's seen the way the company works.

[13:06] He's seen the way it operates, all the way from the top to the bottom.

[13:10] And especially the bottom, because that's where he started.

[13:12] He was designing a game in his basement and now he's the world's number one pinball designer.

[13:17] And so I think if Stern Pinball gets sold and Keith Elwin takes over as the general

[13:22] manager or the president of Stern Pinball, I think people will feel really good about

[13:28] that.

[13:29] The problem I see with all of it is I don't see a future for Stern Pinball at these prices.

[13:34] I just don't think it's very sustainable and I don't think the customers in the community

[13:38] is going to really put up with losing this much money if you're spending this much money

[13:43] on every brand new game.

[13:44] Now speaking of losing money on brand new games, you know the game Godfather, right?

[13:49] So good news for you Jersey Jack Godfather owners out there.

[13:52] Jersey Jack has a solve for your gold armor and side rails.

[13:57] They sent out an email yesterday.

[13:59] They've worked with the vendor.

[14:01] They are now going to replace yours with a new lockdown bar and side rail.

[14:06] They've added extra clear coat to both items so the tarnishing problem won't happen in

[14:12] the future.

[14:13] That is really good.

[14:14] It's going to be really easy for you to swap in and out the new stuff.

[14:18] They're going to mail the new stuff in a box.

[14:21] It has prepaid postage.

[14:23] They'll put the old stuff into the box and mail it back to Jersey Jack.

[14:28] So it's taken about a year to get this fixed but that is a good thing.

[14:32] Jersey Jack also has a major code update coming for Guns N' Roses.

[14:35] I don't know what that means.

[14:36] How's it going to be major?

[14:38] You know what I hear like major code update.

[14:40] Remember when Lyman used to do major code updates on games like The Walking Dead and

[14:44] he took like an okay game and made it amazing.

[14:48] Major code updates on Batman 66.

[14:50] I don't really see how Guns N' Roses is going to have a major code update unless they really

[14:55] figure out how to dial down the multi-balls, how to make the game more rewarding to get

[15:00] through each song.

[15:02] I think they're going to have to balance out the scoring.

[15:04] I think they have to figure out a way to make all those mini wizard modes mean more and matter

[15:09] more when you get to them so the scoring is more improved there.

[15:12] I think if they really wanted to make a major code update to Guns N' Roses they might revisit

[15:17] some of the songs that don't have great light shows and they might also add a few more songs

[15:22] into the mix.

[15:23] I think that would be incredible.

[15:24] I don't think we're going to get that.

[15:26] It's weird that we don't because they're working so close with Slash on the game.

[15:30] He can even give you another tracker too.

[15:33] Why not?

[15:34] It's all his stuff.

[15:35] And so that's good news over at Jersey Jack and look we're seeing more and more Elton John

[15:39] machines being unboxed.

[15:40] I really want an Elton John but I'm not going to get one and the reason I'm not going to

[15:45] get one it's not just the price.

[15:47] It's this simple thing I keep thinking about.

[15:49] Steve Richie is still over there.

[15:52] He's going to make another game at Jersey Jack that is probably going to shoot just

[15:57] as good if not better than Elton John and I think it's going to be based on a theme

[16:03] that I want much more than Elton John.

[16:06] Maybe it's going to be Top Gun.

[16:08] Maybe it's going to be Harry Potter.

[16:10] That's what I'm hoping for and the reason why it's easy for me to wait and see what

[16:14] the next Steve Richie game is going to be at Jersey Jack is if that next game comes

[16:19] out and it's not something I really want then I can go get an Elton John for much less money

[16:26] than $15,000 or $12,000.

[16:29] It's never going to be that hard to get this game.

[16:31] Alright what else is going on people?

[16:33] We got Pulp Fiction going out the door.

[16:36] People are still waiting on their Pulp Fiction LEs.

[16:38] I'm just curious like how long the Pulp Fiction hype is going to last.

[16:43] People are loving this game.

[16:44] As I've said I think it's the last great LE game you bought at the right price at like

[16:49] $9,700.

[16:52] What do all of you think a Pulp Fiction LE on the second hand market will trade for?

[16:57] It's an interesting question right because I would have said like a year ago when the

[17:01] game first came out if they were putting games in boxes then I think people would have spent

[17:07] more over but now that they've got the standard editions rolling out the door people are

[17:12] playing them, there's streams of the game.

[17:15] The mystery and the intrigue of this game is going to get weaker over time not stronger.

[17:22] My guess is if you have a Pulp Fiction LE in a world in which Stern toppers are $2,000

[17:29] I think your Pulp Fiction LE is going to be worth $2,000 over the price of the standard

[17:36] edition game simply because of that beautiful topper simply because there's only a thousand

[17:42] and they're never going to make more toppers.

[17:44] It's also a nicer looking back box than the standard edition game.

[17:48] There's a lot to love in that game.

[17:50] It's got the mirror blades that you can buy from CoinTaker but it comes installed with

[17:54] those mirror blades.

[17:55] The game is absolutely gorgeous and then you add it all together.

[17:58] You're at like $11,700 around $12,000 for a Pulp Fiction LE where there's only $1,000.

[18:05] I think that's an enticing thing.

[18:07] It's like the same price as a labyrinth.

[18:09] Elton John Platinum Edition.

[18:11] I think you're going to see that game trade for that when the game comes out later this

[18:15] year.

[18:16] All right, what else is going on in Pinball?

[18:18] There's no news.

[18:19] There's no conversation happening around Barrios' BBQ Challenge.

[18:23] I think American Pinball has done people.

[18:26] I've said it for a long time.

[18:27] This is a Nepo Baby company.

[18:29] This company was made because they got ripped off by J-Pop.

[18:33] It's been a series of disastrous decisions for almost like eight years now.

[18:37] But this is arguably the worst decision they've ever made.

[18:41] And I think as long as David Fix is at the helm of a creative company, a man that has

[18:47] no creative vision of what this community wants and what will work in Pinball, this company

[18:53] will never make a game that will take your money.

[18:56] And I don't think they get to Cuphead.

[18:58] If they get to Cuphead, it's going to be a disaster.

[19:01] That is not a theme that a lot of people want.

[19:04] It's way too niche in the video game space.

[19:06] And so I think American Pinball is a company that is running on fumes.

[19:10] And I think Mukesh is going to pull the plug on this company before we get to Ryan McQuade's

[19:15] game.

[19:16] And honestly, even if that game comes out, I don't think you care.

[19:18] I know I don't care.

[19:19] I don't look forward to anything coming from American Pinball.

[19:23] And it's truly sad.

[19:24] I really think this company could have gone in a really great direction.

[19:28] They just hired the wrong people.

[19:30] And this is what bad leadership can do.

[19:32] They can take a company that has so much potential and do nothing with it.

[19:36] That's the ultimate definition of American Pinball, a company that had potential, did

[19:40] nothing with it, had terrible creative leadership and horrendous art design.

[19:45] Like it was so weird how bad their art design was over all of the years they made games.

[19:51] All right, everybody.

[19:52] So look, we're at this calm period before the storm.

[19:54] Three new games are about to come out in like four weeks.

[19:57] I can't wait to cover all of it.

[19:59] We will be back with more Canadian episodes this week.

[20:01] I'm going to go back to the 1980s and see which themes we need to turn into pinball

[20:06] machines.

[20:07] I hope we get there.

[20:08] I hope we get Beetlejuice from Spooky.

[20:09] I hope we get Gremlins from Spooky.

[20:11] I think it's going to happen.

[20:12] I really think it's going to happen.

[20:14] If Spooky makes Beetlejuice, I mean, it's over, people.

[20:17] You're all going to want one.

[20:19] Everybody chat soon.
