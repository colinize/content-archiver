[00:00] I feel like that is the music that plays inside George Gomez's head every time he sees

[00:18] a new episode of Canatus Pinball Podcast has been uploaded to the world.

[00:23] Okay, so are you sitting down?

[00:26] This is going to be the week in which we see the next new Stern machine.

[00:31] You heard it here first.

[00:32] This week we will be introduced to the next major cornerstone title from Stern Pinball.

[00:38] They once again have done it to us where they don't go to the big trade show to reveal

[00:45] the game.

[00:46] They wait until the following week or two and then pull the curtain off the machine.

[00:51] I thought it would be at Comic Con.

[00:52] It seemed like it would make a total home run to bring the new game to Comic Con and have

[00:58] hundreds of thousands of people who go to Comic Con, see your new machine.

[01:02] Instead they decided to bring Star Wars home edition there.

[01:05] We'll talk a little bit about that and why they did that.

[01:07] But look, who cares?

[01:09] Who cares?

[01:10] All the complaining and moaning and groaning is about to end this week because we will

[01:15] see the next latest and I'm hearing one of the greatest games from Stern Pinball.

[01:20] Now here's how it's going to work.

[01:22] On Monday, the distributors will be briefed on the game.

[01:26] What that means is I think Stern does a video walk through or maybe it's live via Skype.

[01:31] They do a walk through of the new game for their distributors and they explain the way

[01:35] the game works, what the theme is.

[01:38] They give them enough information to then take that information and be able to sell the

[01:43] game.

[01:44] It's like them empowering their Salesforce with all the right key messages around the

[01:49] game.

[01:50] What happens during that walk through is Gary just walks up to machine.

[01:54] He goes, you pull the shooter back and you watch the ball go, we around the play field

[02:00] and then you make thousands of dollars from Stern Pinball because we're the only pinball

[02:04] manufacturer in town that will get these games to consumers in a week or two.

[02:08] Can you place your orders now?

[02:10] Absolutely you can.

[02:11] All right.

[02:12] That's what's going to happen on Monday.

[02:14] Now, when will the full reveal of the game take place?

[02:17] Here's what's going to happen.

[02:19] This always happens.

[02:20] The second distributors know about the game, they will tell everyone and their mother what

[02:26] the theme is, what the game is and then all of that will leak onto Pinside and into the

[02:30] forums and into the inner circles of pinball enthusiasts.

[02:34] If the title is big, here's what always happens.

[02:36] If it's a big title, it will sell out within 48 hours.

[02:42] If it is Jurassic Park, will it sell out immediately?

[02:46] Absolutely.

[02:47] The Jurassic World might take a little bit longer.

[02:51] I think it's between those two.

[02:53] Here's the funny part.

[02:54] The code name over at Stern Pinball with the distributors is JAWS.

[02:59] They're calling the code name of this game JAWS.

[03:02] Now we know that doesn't mean it's going to be JAWS the big fish.

[03:06] That's in the ocean based on the 1970s something film we all love.

[03:10] It means that they're insinuating the big JAWS from a dinosaur.

[03:16] The T-Rex JAWS, the Indominus Rex JAWS.

[03:20] That's why they codenamed it.

[03:21] They're so funny, Stern.

[03:22] They have such a good sense of humor.

[03:24] You know, I'll tell you what, it looks like they're having a really good time over there.

[03:29] It's Stern.

[03:30] Like they're having a lot of fun.

[03:31] And they must be because you know what leads to having a lot of fun in life when you make

[03:35] a lot of money.

[03:37] And Stern Pinball is very successful.

[03:39] The Pinball hobby is growing and they are capturing the majority of the money that is flooding

[03:46] into the Pinball marketplace.

[03:48] They must be blown away.

[03:50] Looking at the last 11 years of Pinball, right?

[03:53] 2008, Pinball is on the verge of collapsing.

[03:56] The economy is collapsed.

[03:57] Stern is about to go out of business.

[03:59] They hold on with Lord of the Rings.

[04:01] George Gomez masterpiece and 11 years later, they've seen so many, so many charlatan companies

[04:08] come and go, so many other people try to show them how to do it in the Pinball business.

[04:14] And the Pinball business is booming and they are collecting most of that revenue and they

[04:20] deserve it.

[04:21] They deserve it.

[04:22] Okay?

[04:23] Alright, so we're going to see the new game.

[04:25] Now what does that mean?

[04:26] What does that mean?

[04:27] Is it going to be Jurassic Park or Jurassic World?

[04:29] Now I think most people are really hoping it's Jurassic Park.

[04:33] Okay, Jurassic Park is the iconic movie.

[04:36] It is a movie most of us have seen tens of times, if not hundreds of times.

[04:42] It's a movie in which we remember the theme song, all the different themes and scenes

[04:47] from the movie, all the different lines from the movie.

[04:50] You know, Dino, DNA, hold on to your butts.

[04:55] How awesome would it be when you go to tilt the machine and it goes, ah, right?

[05:00] Jurassic World.

[05:01] I was entertained by Jurassic World, but it's not the iconic film.

[05:05] It's a movie you see maybe once or twice.

[05:07] It's not a movie you're going to watch over and over and over again, like the original

[05:11] Jurassic Park.

[05:12] The other thing about Jurassic Park, it was a Steven Spielberg movie and it was the

[05:16] first time CGI graphics, right?

[05:20] It was the first time they were able to apply CGI in ways that blew us away.

[05:25] I mean, it was a groundbreaking movie.

[05:27] When people saw Jurassic Park for the first time, it was like nothing they had ever seen

[05:32] before and that can't be said about Jurassic World.

[05:36] I think it's a little bit of a shame now.

[05:38] There's like no kind of like groundbreaking theatrical, you know, movie going experiences

[05:44] anymore.

[05:45] The last one was Avatar for people, right?

[05:47] When that whole new 3D world that James Cameron developed came to life with Pandora.

[05:53] All right.

[05:54] So I think everyone's hoping it's Jurassic Park.

[05:56] We will find out this week.

[05:58] If it is Jurassic World, I think it still will sell very well because we all love dinosaurs.

[06:03] I don't know about you, but I'll watch almost any movie with dinosaurs running around

[06:07] in it.

[06:08] It could be a movie about knitting dinosaurs, dinosaurs that want a nituous sweater.

[06:13] And I'd be like, you know what?

[06:14] I have an hour and a half to watch this film.

[06:16] Okay.

[06:17] So will this game, the question I have coming out when it is, will it put a dent in Willie

[06:23] Wanker's sales?

[06:24] To me, these are the two games that are going to go head to head for your money this summer.

[06:30] Okay.

[06:31] Will they battle it out for pinball supremacy in the summer now?

[06:36] How do I think Willie Wanker stacks up when it comes to being a competitor for Jurassic Park

[06:43] or Jurassic World?

[06:44] Well, we have to look at it depending on what the theme is going to be.

[06:48] So if it's Jurassic World, I think Willie Wanker has an advantage.

[06:52] I think Willie Wanker is a classic movie.

[06:55] It's iconic.

[06:56] It falls into that bucket of movies.

[06:58] People have watched over and over and over again.

[07:01] Also movies that people introduce to their children.

[07:04] It becomes part of the family movie going experience.

[07:07] Right?

[07:08] I don't think Jurassic World has that level of cash.

[07:11] Shay.

[07:12] I don't think it has that level of cultural significance.

[07:14] And so therefore, I think that Willie Wanker is a superior theme than Jurassic World.

[07:20] Now, if it's Willie Wanker versus Jurassic Park, hold on now.

[07:24] We have a whole different competition stirring up here.

[07:28] If you were to ask me which theme is more powerful and people have more of an emotional

[07:34] connection to in the pinball demographic, which remember is 40 to 50 year old men, which

[07:41] theme speaks more to those people would be more exciting for those people to buy, would

[07:47] be more people would be more enthusiastic about owning.

[07:51] And I think without a doubt, it would be close.

[07:53] It would be very close.

[07:55] But I think Jurassic Park would edge out Willie Wanker.

[07:58] I'm a little bit surprised too.

[08:00] Willie Wanker is a very cool theme.

[08:01] But when people start saying, oh man, it's a dream theme.

[08:05] How many grown men do you know?

[08:08] Willingly start having conversations about Willie Wanker between the ages of 40 and 50.

[08:15] Willie Wanker is not really the cool flick to put on for most of these guys.

[08:20] Willie Wanker is not really the movie.

[08:21] When you're at a bar talking about amazing movie scenes, people are like, oh yeah, but

[08:26] what about when Varukas Salt wanted it now?

[08:29] No, it's not.

[08:31] And it's a timeless classic for sure.

[08:34] I'm not arguing against that.

[08:37] But I think a lot of the grown men who are really in the pinball, they like Willie Wanker.

[08:42] I don't think they're over the moon in love with Willie Wanker the way they are with some

[08:48] other movies like Back to the Future, like Jurassic Park, like the Karate Kid, like Top Gun.

[08:55] Again, Ghostbusters.

[08:56] I think those are all themes that are much, much, much, much, much more indelibly linked

[09:04] to the psyche of a man between the ages of 40 and 50.

[09:07] Do you agree or disagree?

[09:09] So the question then becomes, is how will they integrate the game and how will it compete

[09:17] with Willie Wanker?

[09:18] We know, you know, Jersey Jack Pimball's approach to Willie Wanker.

[09:23] Pat Lawler created one of, I think the best shooting games we've had in a really long time.

[09:27] The theme integration is there from a visual standpoint.

[09:31] You got the big gob stopper rotating.

[09:33] You got the big Wanker vision.

[09:35] You've got all the characters from Willie Wanker on the Playfield art.

[09:38] If you stand over a Willie Wanker, there is no doubt you are in front of the world of

[09:43] Willie Wanker.

[09:44] Now, does the theme and the movie we love come to life in that game the way we wanted

[09:50] to?

[09:51] That's a subjective question that's open for debate.

[09:54] I would say that a lot of what I love in that movie is absolutely missing from the way

[10:00] that game comes to life when I play it.

[10:03] I just don't feel like I'm going through the chocolate factory.

[10:06] You know how I feel people.

[10:08] Now, how will Stern integrate Jurassic Park or Jurassic World into this game?

[10:13] I can't believe we're even, imagine if it's not Jurassic Park or Jurassic World, they're

[10:17] going to be laughing their asses off over at Stern Pimball at this podcast.

[10:22] But let's just hypothetically go down the road that it is Jurassic Park or Jurassic World.

[10:27] Okay.

[10:28] What kind of mechanisms will it have?

[10:30] The great news is the Data East Jurassic Park is filled with a lot of fun mechs, especially

[10:36] the highlighted one, which is the big dinosaur head that bends over and eats the ball, which

[10:41] is something we haven't really seen in a Stern Pimball machine in a really long time,

[10:46] which are toys that actually interact with the gameplay, but like magical toys.

[10:50] You know, not like the Black Knight was a good mech.

[10:52] I mean, it got us halfway there.

[10:55] You know, at least the ball interacts with the toy itself.

[10:58] You still don't, you still do not bash the Black Knight.

[11:01] I love that they always find a way to put targets in front of the toys now.

[11:05] Like if Stern made Lord of the Rings now, you wouldn't bash ballrog.

[11:09] There'd be like a target in front of ballrog or a magnet in front of him, but you never

[11:13] really hit him.

[11:14] It would be kind of lame.

[11:15] Anyway, so will there be a T-Rex or an endominous Rex toy in the game that takes what the Data

[11:23] East version did and takes it to the next level?

[11:27] Will there be like the Jurassic Park gates that open up?

[11:30] You kind of need those.

[11:31] What a great bash toy that would be to open up the door to the park.

[11:36] Will there be Velociraptors that run around in the game?

[11:40] Will there be a lower play field in which we have that big sea creature from Jurassic World?

[11:45] If it goes that way, will there be TeraDactyls?

[11:48] I don't know.

[11:49] There's so much that would come to life in the Jurassic Park world that could make a perfect

[11:54] world under glass in Pimbal.

[11:56] But here's the thing that I'm worried about.

[11:57] I'm always worried about this with Stern.

[11:59] This is the one area.

[12:00] I'll just like, all right, Jurassic Park.

[12:02] You're going into Jurassic Park.

[12:04] It's like a jungle, right, in which the dinosaurs are loose.

[12:07] The pop bumper area of Jurassic Park or Jurassic World.

[12:11] It shouldn't just be crappy, stern pop bumper plastics.

[12:16] All right, they should have made like trees, like jungle trees in which the ball bounces

[12:21] between actually bring the world to life and look at every element of that world and

[12:26] sculpt it into the game to the best of your ability.

[12:30] At least they tried with Ghostbusters to sculpt the city over the pop bumper area that

[12:34] made it look much more interesting.

[12:36] I really hope Stern is starting to turn a corner here and look at these games.

[12:42] The reason why I point out the pop bumper areas and Stern games, they're just such wasted

[12:48] real estate when it comes to creativity and putting the world there.

[12:53] But look, let's see what happens.

[12:55] This is stupid.

[12:56] I'm starting to critique a game I've never even seen.

[12:59] I don't even know if it's that theme.

[13:01] So we're not going to keep going down that road.

[13:04] But if it's Jurassic Park and it's Keith L. Win, right, and it's a unique design.

[13:09] I don't know who the artist is.

[13:11] It's not franchy.

[13:12] Is it zombie Yeti?

[13:13] I don't know what the game is going to look like.

[13:15] But if it is Jurassic Park, this game will sell out by Tuesday.

[13:20] If distributors know it's Jurassic Park, the phone calls they will make.

[13:24] All 500 will be sold out.

[13:25] I hope Stern does 500.

[13:28] If I were them, I would have done 250 SL SLEs because it's the 25th anniversary of Jurassic

[13:34] Park last year.

[13:35] I would have done or 250 L's.

[13:37] I would have made it special.

[13:39] I'm so I don't like these 600 800 L's.

[13:42] They don't feel limited.

[13:43] Come on Stern, zoom it, zoom it back down.

[13:45] Alright, zoom it back down.

[13:46] That's a stupid phrase.

[13:47] I'm never using that again.

[13:48] Alright, so we'll see.

[13:50] We will see this week, but it's super exciting.

[13:53] I definitely think if it's a home run game, it will hurt Willy Wonka sales.

[13:57] There's no way around it.

[13:59] I mean, Willy Wonka's are just on the line, but they're not flying out to people.

[14:03] People have still not seen the collector's edition.

[14:06] Jack just made a mistake.

[14:07] By the time the collector's edition is on the line, people will be extremely fatigued

[14:12] by Willy Wonka.

[14:13] They just will be.

[14:14] And the excitement will move on to the next game.

[14:17] I don't know about you out there, but I think a lot of people in Pimble are like me,

[14:23] not in the sense that they have incredible fashion sense and are brilliant.

[14:26] I don't mean it like that.

[14:28] They're like me.

[14:30] And here's why I think they're like me.

[14:31] I think most people, mentally, mentally, they stated themselves, okay, I could get one

[14:38] new Pimble game a year.

[14:40] I could get one new one.

[14:42] And I think most people feel that way because if they needed to, they could financially

[14:47] make it work in which they could buy a new Pimble machine a year, maybe to at most.

[14:51] But I think most people fall into that bucket.

[14:54] I think it's an issue of space and I think it's an issue with money with people.

[14:58] So when two big games come out at the same time, so let's hypothetically say Jurassic Park,

[15:04] Keith Allen or Jurassic World, and Willy Wonka Pimble, people are going to have to make

[15:09] a decision on which one do I go for.

[15:12] You know, we went 38 people recently who just bought a big Lebowski that they weren't

[15:16] expecting to buy for $12,500.

[15:20] So that money's gone to a Pimble machine.

[15:22] But now those people, they might have bailed on their Willy Wonka's to get Lebowski.

[15:27] Now that this new Stern game is coming out, will people bail on Willy Wonka and put the

[15:32] money into the Stern machine if they like what they see more?

[15:36] Okay, now what I think is going to win this battle and I've said this all along.

[15:39] This is, these games need to check a lot of boxes for people and they really need to,

[15:45] you know, if you're a manufacturer, you need to make sure your games hit on all the boxes

[15:49] and you've heard me talk about them before.

[15:51] But here's what the boxes I think are in order of priority if you want to get your game

[15:57] sold.

[15:58] And it's also the reason why, again, I'm like, if you don't check box number one, it

[16:02] makes it harder and harder or puts more pressure on the following boxes to deliver and get

[16:08] your sales going.

[16:09] And it's the reason why October Fest is not selling at all.

[16:11] So first and foremost, the most important box is theme and theme alone.

[16:17] If you nail the theme in pinball, you will sell a ton of games if you nail the theme

[16:21] in pinball.

[16:22] That is what people have the emotional connection to.

[16:25] The number two most important theme or box is theme integration.

[16:29] So after theme is theme integration, how well did you integrate that theme into the

[16:34] pinball machine?

[16:35] So for example, Game of Thrones, first box, check with a big check mark, second box,

[16:42] theme integration.

[16:43] Fifth throwings is probably one of the worst theme integrations of a huge franchise I've

[16:47] ever seen.

[16:49] Same can be said for Star Wars, right?

[16:51] So that is like once you fail to check the second box with an impressive theme integration

[16:56] game, I think your sales start to fall off immediately, right?

[17:00] So the first box is, do I have your attention?

[17:02] Would you want to buy this game?

[17:04] Yes.

[17:05] Do you like the way we theme integrated this game?

[17:07] If it's a no, good luck selling that game, you're going to have a lot of trouble.

[17:11] All right, after theme integration, the third most important thing I think in a pinball

[17:15] game, you know, is, and I go between these two, three and four are very close, is the

[17:21] code in the game.

[17:23] How good is the software in the game and does it connect to the property in the right way?

[17:30] And I think three and four go together.

[17:31] The next is how well does the game shoot?

[17:34] And the reason why I say that I put code a little bit above how well the game shoots

[17:39] is a game like Batman.

[17:42] Clunky doesn't shoot the best, but the code just elevates it.

[17:45] So I think the code does matter more than the game layout and design, but they're very

[17:51] closely linked.

[17:52] You could almost put them together, okay?

[17:54] And then the last thing is just the artwork on a game.

[17:58] How beautiful is the game to stand over?

[18:00] How amazing is it?

[18:01] You know, if you've never played the game before, this is what's funny.

[18:05] The reason why some games sell out before people even play them is they have almost just

[18:12] like one, two and five, is it five?

[18:15] Already figured out, right?

[18:16] They've got the theme, right?

[18:18] They've got the world under glass and they've got the art package nailed.

[18:21] Now no one's ever flipped it.

[18:22] No one knows if it's any fun.

[18:24] No one knows what the code is.

[18:25] But on just theme and almost art alone, you could probably sell a game out before people

[18:31] even flip a single ball.

[18:33] All right?

[18:34] That's most important.

[18:35] And we're going to see Willy Wonka and the next-dern game battle it out and whoever

[18:40] can check the most of those boxes will sell the most games, okay?

[18:46] And it's also the reason why I've been down and out on Willy Wonka because I think you

[18:50] could argue that the world under glass isn't exactly what everyone was looking for when

[18:54] it comes to the movie being put under the glass.

[18:58] And most importantly, the code in the game continues to still be a head scratching mystery.

[19:03] I just saw that they released code 1.09, right?

[19:08] And you get all excited.

[19:09] You're like, oh, new code from Jersey Jack.

[19:11] They've listened to us.

[19:12] They're putting new stuff in the game.

[19:13] They fix things that people have been complaining about.

[19:16] And then you open up the notes on the new code update and you're like, wait, did I miss

[19:21] it?

[19:22] Where is it?

[19:23] I don't see anything.

[19:24] Is there anything there?

[19:25] There's two lines of stuff that are just little bug fixes that have nothing to do

[19:29] whatsoever with enhancing the game.

[19:32] And then you really start to worry that, wait a minute, maybe the game is what it is.

[19:36] And it's just done.

[19:37] And there is not any new stuff coming to this game.

[19:41] And that, you know, look, I fully expect in code 1.10, the code update is going to be like,

[19:46] we've now programmed into the game.

[19:49] We're going to tell you what Joe Katz had for lunch last week.

[19:52] So if you update to 1.10, throughout the game, Joe Katz will call out his, you know, what

[19:57] he had for lunch last week.

[19:58] I mean, that's where we're at with this game.

[20:00] Have they heard none of the feedback that people want?

[20:03] The voice clips put in with the movie clips.

[20:07] I will not shut up about this until Jersey Jack Pimball fixes this problem.

[20:12] I'm out on this game.

[20:14] Like it's the easiest fix.

[20:15] The clips are there.

[20:16] They run over and over again.

[20:18] I don't care if they're repetitive.

[20:19] Go watch.

[20:20] Go watch a stream of the Big Lebowski Pimball and go look at the clips from the movie.

[20:26] Then all those clips in the Big Lebowski.

[20:29] Imagine if all those clips were muted with no voice happening during those clips.

[20:34] I mean, I want to hear Jesus curse me out over and over again.

[20:37] And the clips in the Lebowski, they're absolutely repetitive and you see them over and over again.

[20:42] And you guess what?

[20:43] It's freaking awesome.

[20:44] That's why people love the way that game is coded because the movie is jumping out of

[20:51] the game and into your eyes and ears.

[20:54] And that's what people want, Jersey Jack, when you wake the F up and fix that major problem

[20:59] in Willy Wonka, I'm sorry.

[21:01] Wake up Joe and Jack.

[21:04] Put the voice into those scenes.

[21:07] All right.

[21:08] God, it's so easy.

[21:09] You have the rights to do it or be honest with us and tell us you don't have the rights.

[21:15] Now speaking of this, speaking of this, if Stern makes Jurassic Park and Jurassic World,

[21:21] what will the assets be like in the game?

[21:23] Right?

[21:24] That's a big question mark.

[21:25] Will they get Chris Pratt?

[21:27] Will they get all the original cast from the original Jurassic Park, Jeff Goldbloom?

[21:33] Sam is it Sam Neal?

[21:35] Will they get all those people to, and will they have the rights to use the clips from those

[21:38] movies?

[21:39] You know, they need it.

[21:40] We need Newman being like, I don't want like voice actors recreating those scenes for

[21:46] us.

[21:47] So once again, will assets be the Achilles heel of these big themes?

[21:52] And lately, that's been the case.

[21:54] The bigger the theme, the harder it has been to secure the rights to the things we want

[21:59] to see.

[22:00] All right.

[22:01] Oh, man, I feel like I haven't taken a breath.

[22:03] Have you taken a breath since I started this podcast?

[22:05] All right.

[22:06] So I want to read a few of your emails.

[22:08] I want to respond to something that someone has, people have been saying like they feel

[22:12] let down by Stern bringing Star Wars home edition to Comic Con.

[22:18] The consensus is their mad that Stern hyped this as the big reveal at Comic Con.

[22:23] I want to tell people everyone, here's the truth.

[22:26] You want the truth?

[22:27] I'll give you the truth because Stern doesn't talk to us about the truth, but I'll give

[22:29] you the truth.

[22:30] And I don't mean like Stern's lying.

[22:32] They just go about business as usual.

[22:34] And Stern also has something that a lot of these distributors don't have or manufacturers.

[22:39] They have really strong relationships with their licensors.

[22:44] And they sometimes do stuff that the licensor has asked them to do.

[22:49] So do you not think that Disney had no say in what happened at Comic Con in their Star

[22:55] Wars area?

[22:57] Disney is the ones who wanted Stern to put out that the new game would be revealed and

[23:01] would hype it a little bit.

[23:02] All right.

[23:03] So Disney asked Stern to do that.

[23:05] And if you're Stern, what do you do?

[23:07] You do that because you're looking at the bigger picture like so what?

[23:11] Like we're going to hype that you're going to see the next new thing from Stern

[23:13] Pimball.

[23:14] And honestly, a lot of people read between the lines and a lot of people were like, this

[23:20] is it.

[23:21] And who cares if you were disappointed for like seven days and now you're going to get

[23:24] the new Stern title?

[23:25] Again, some of this I think Stern maybe does it on purpose and overhipes it to watch the

[23:31] Pinside babies go absolutely nuts and lose their minds when they're not satiated with

[23:35] something.

[23:36] All right.

[23:37] Let me read some emails from you guys.

[23:39] What's been going on in your minds in the Pimball world?

[23:43] I got an email from BB.

[23:46] Maybe it's BB8.

[23:47] It's from Dell 31.

[23:49] You know Dell, he says Star Wars home.

[23:51] He says, Canada, listening to your podcast and you've completely missed the point of

[23:56] those frustrated about Star Wars home edition.

[24:00] You're rambling about privilege and how could Stern make something not for the hardcore?

[24:05] It has nothing to do with that at all.

[24:07] Here's the problem.

[24:09] I want to hype this game through a teaser trailer that was targeted to Pinside audience.

[24:15] That people got hyped on Pinside expecting their next big reveal.

[24:19] In fact, you even started the podcast off by saying we found out what the big reveal

[24:24] was.

[24:26] When folks found out the big reveal is Star Wars home.

[24:30] Well of course, people were pissed because who gives enough.

[24:33] Now if Stern just dropped Star Wars home without any teaser or hype, I think the reaction

[24:39] at least for me would be different.

[24:41] I understand what they're doing and support trying to get more people in and why not test

[24:47] the waters with the biggest franchise ever.

[24:50] Sure, but don't hype this BS and then be surprised people are pissed.

[24:54] As you said, Stern's target audience is not Pinside, so why would Stern hype something

[24:59] to an audience that they know is not watching hype videos?

[25:02] If they were, they wouldn't spend money on Star Wars home and just buy use.

[25:08] Dell 31.

[25:09] Well Dell, Stern didn't hype the game on Pinside.

[25:12] Did they?

[25:13] Did they go on Pinside and say, hey everybody, hey you hardcore people, you're about to

[25:18] have a big reveal from us.

[25:19] No they didn't.

[25:21] They did not.

[25:22] They simply put up a post that obviously Disney approved and made some content to say that

[25:28] there was going to be a big new reveal at Comic Con.

[25:34] In Disney's mind and in Stern's mind probably a home edition based on one of the biggest

[25:39] franchises ever is a big deal for them that they're going to sell a, I think it's $4,500

[25:45] Star Wars home edition and they're going to give distributors the cheapest Stern product

[25:50] based on the biggest theme Stern's ever had for consumers to now consider to buy.

[25:57] I think a lot of you guys on Pinside are just, you're reading into it.

[26:00] You're projecting yourself into their marketing move and you're not.

[26:04] You were never the target and they didn't do what you just described.

[26:08] So I think just everyone just get over it.

[26:10] We're about to see the cornerstone this week.

[26:14] So who cares, right?

[26:15] Let's just move on.

[26:16] So Lonnie said Star Wars, this Lonnie pain Star Wars home edition, I don't see what all

[26:22] the hate for Star Wars home is all about.

[26:24] It would be one thing if this was the only Star Wars available.

[26:28] But there are other fully featured Star Wars out there for the collectors.

[26:33] I watched the Stern stream and the game actually seems pretty cool.

[26:36] Might go well in a large collection of a collectors as well.

[26:40] Lonzo on Pinside goes by Lonnie pain in real life.

[26:44] I couldn't agree more Lonnie.

[26:45] I think you're right.

[26:47] I think this is a game that it's just, it's nice that Stern gives people options at different

[26:52] price points and I think this is for distributors.

[26:55] This is for distributors when someone walks into their distribution company and has all

[27:00] these expensive, confusing pens, they can show them this and say, hey, look, if you're

[27:04] a beginner, maybe you want to start here and then we can go from there.

[27:08] All right, I got an email from Gregor.

[27:11] Gregor, why is burger?

[27:13] Why is Gerber?

[27:14] Okay, Gregor says, hey, canada.

[27:16] Still listening to every episode just didn't have anything to write in because I'm sadly

[27:22] not spending that much time on Pimball anymore, but your podcast keeps me up to date effortlessly.

[27:29] And the beginning of your last podcast got me to start the Game of Thrones code update

[27:33] stream with Dwight and Jack and he did address why he updated Game of Thrones and the, in

[27:39] fact, Ghostbusters update is still coming to sum it up.

[27:44] Game of Thrones was his first game after returning to Pimball and he always wanted to do an update,

[27:49] so that's why that one was first.

[27:52] And Ghostbusters is going to be an even bigger one and it's being worked on right now already.

[27:57] Yay, can't wait, can't wait.

[28:00] Just want to let you know since you obviously didn't watch it.

[28:03] Okay, so I did not watch that stream and look, Dwight updating Game of Thrones, it's

[28:09] fine.

[28:10] I mean, look, I'm all for.

[28:12] I'm all for coders updating games and adding things into them and continuing to polish

[28:18] these games over the years.

[28:19] If you ask me one thing, I always love when I say that on my podcast, if you ask me one

[28:25] thing, as if you're there in a room and I walk in, I kick in the door, I'm like, you

[28:28] get one question of Canada, what would you ask me?

[28:32] But here's my take on all this and you might hate me for saying this, but I think additional

[28:39] code updates in games that happen years after the game come out is the biggest loss of

[28:46] revenue for Stern Pimball ever.

[28:49] It is so silly to me that when a game is like at 1.0 and everything's in it that they

[28:54] want in it, it is crazy to me that they don't understand the revenue potential to charge

[29:02] additional money to get, you know, very enhanced code updates down the road.

[29:09] You know, and look at the video game industry, look at DLC content in which people pay money

[29:16] to get more out of the game and look at a game like Fortnite where the game is free

[29:22] and yet people spend $300 million a month to get stuff out of the game to make the experience

[29:31] better.

[29:32] Here's what's funny, you can give someone a Pimball machine for free and charge them,

[29:39] you know, $1,000 per mode is to get the game to wake up.

[29:45] I guess what, these people would do it.

[29:47] I'm not saying I would ever do that, but you know what I'm saying is it's crazy to me

[29:52] that they're going to do all this work and look who's paying for that work.

[29:56] You get it for free and I just think Stern is missing an opportunity to get people to

[30:01] pony up a few hundred bucks for a completely new experience with the game.

[30:06] I wonder if Deeproot is going to go that approach and charge less for the game, but then

[30:11] charge you for software downloads that really changed the game and add more to the game.

[30:19] And look, and you can't complain about it.

[30:21] We're seeing it left and right in every other area of entertainment, but yet in Pimball,

[30:27] you buy a game, the game might be done.

[30:30] They might continue to polish the game because some diehard haters are complaining about

[30:34] a few things and then they give you that extra work for free.

[30:38] You didn't pay for it.

[30:39] You didn't even know it was going to be in there.

[30:42] So you know, curious to see if Stern listens to this and takes me up on it.

[30:46] Okay, what else is going on?

[30:48] He says, Greg also says, and I'm, and may I suggest for your Patreon campaign, since you're

[30:54] not depending on, on the money, how about donating it to a cause of your liking?

[31:01] I bet you would get even more Patreon subscribers.

[31:04] Okay, so I am donating it to a cause of my liking.

[31:08] The cause of my liking is taking my beautiful wife Brenda out for dinner once a month with

[31:14] the Patreon amounts I get.

[31:17] And look, as a wife of a Pimball podcaster, you have no idea.

[31:21] You have no idea the amount of time she has to sit and watch and hear me record this

[31:28] podcast.

[31:29] Now I could be having a nice breakfast with my wife Saturday morning, instead I want

[31:34] to get this news up and she loves me and she understands that I love doing this.

[31:39] But that's why I take Brenda out and we enjoy a meal with the money you donate to Patreon.

[31:46] And if you want to see a happy wife, which equals a happy life.

[31:50] And if you want to see this podcast go on and on and on into the future, please donate

[31:56] to Canada Pimball podcast Patreon account.

[31:59] It's not hard to find.

[32:00] Go to Patreon, search for Canada Pimball.

[32:02] It's also Patreon, backslash, Canada Pimball.

[32:05] I will happily moving forward share the photos of the exact dinners and what we ordered

[32:11] at that dinner that you helped contribute to for all the countless hours that I have sacrificed,

[32:20] that she has sacrificed to get you guys this Pimball podcast.

[32:24] How's that for a cause?

[32:26] He also says PS, I still think you'd be having more fun on your daily commute if you

[32:31] would trade in your Honda for a Tesla Model 3.

[32:34] No way, no way.

[32:36] The Honda is so much more fun than the Tesla.

[32:38] I just like burning stuff as Jerry Seinfeld says and the C8 Corvette is common.

[32:42] I'm going to get the 06 version and trade the Honda in on that.

[32:46] Have it have a demon and a 06 C8 sounds like a good combo.

[32:50] All right, I got an email.

[32:51] Let's see.

[32:52] I think that's it for my Gmail.

[32:54] I got a bunch of people wrote in on Facebook, but you know what?

[32:57] I'm going to leave it there.

[32:58] I want to close off one final thing that happened to me as well.

[33:02] After my last podcast, I got hit up by another of American Pimball's distributors.

[33:08] And they said to me that that game is not selling well for them either.

[33:14] And so at what point, at what point do some of these people actually go out and be a

[33:20] little bit more vocal about how to help American Pimball?

[33:24] And I think, you know, what I said in my last podcast, I mean, if you want to help

[33:29] American Pimball, then I think you need to start giving honest feedback.

[33:32] And I think distributors need to go back to them and tell them why they think these

[33:37] games are not selling.

[33:39] And if they are selling, then I would happily report how well they're selling.

[33:43] But where are they selling?

[33:45] 3000 people chiming in on a Joe Balser October fest thread.

[33:50] Does not indicate to me that the game is successful.

[33:53] If you go back to so many or a lot of the conversation was around the damn monkey

[33:58] grabbing us.

[33:59] Remember the the ass grabbing monkey?

[34:01] The people couldn't stop talking about that.

[34:03] And so that gets added into that tally of people talking about the game.

[34:09] And the same 50 people, this is the thing too.

[34:11] The same 50 people on Pinside sort of slapping each other around in a thread,

[34:17] which happens all the time that drives up the thread count in a post.

[34:22] But a club thread about unboxing the game is different.

[34:27] And that is why that thread is much more indicative of how well the game is selling.

[34:34] Because people are not going to go to a club thread and talk about unboxings

[34:39] unless they're doing one thing unboxing the pin they just bought.

[34:44] And they're not going to be in the club thread unless they actually own the game.

[34:48] All right.

[34:49] And that's why you're not seeing much activity there.

[34:51] So take that to the bank.

[34:53] All you October fest, a polygist out there is the same thing with the P three thread.

[34:58] I mean, like months go by.

[35:00] No conversation in the unboxing thread.

[35:02] I mean, are P three even being made right now?

[35:04] Are they going out?

[35:05] Like where are they?

[35:07] Okay.

[35:08] Come on.

[35:09] Come on, like cosmic carnival unboxing threads are we going to see 250?

[35:13] I think they said they had they were making plaques for like the first 250 games.

[35:18] I mean, that's ain't that some wishful thinking that you're going to sell 250 cosmic carnivals.

[35:23] It's going to be hard.

[35:24] It's going to be hard in this climate.

[35:25] You know, they haven't even shipped all the monster badge remake out of these.

[35:28] People are still waiting for those.

[35:31] So, you know, long story short, I could help American pinball.

[35:35] I could significantly help American pinball with their decision making.

[35:39] Because I think they have the right engineering talent.

[35:42] I think they have a very creative coder.

[35:44] I think the code Josh puts into the game is very creative and very fun.

[35:49] I think they've got fun down, but getting fun down in pinball does not mean you're going

[35:54] to be successful.

[35:55] It doesn't.

[35:56] That's that's like par for the course.

[35:58] They've got the right engineer on board.

[36:01] They've got the designer.

[36:02] They've got the coder.

[36:04] But man, you know, who's letting them down is is the people running the company?

[36:09] What they need, what American pinball needs is one thing.

[36:13] They need their George Gomez.

[36:16] Who is the George Gomez of American pinball?

[36:20] Who is the person sitting over that company?

[36:23] Not the designer, not the coder, not the artist, but the guy sitting above the people,

[36:29] sitting above the engineers and the coders and the designers and the artists.

[36:34] And he is the guy holding the wheel.

[36:38] All right, George Gomez is the smartest man in pinball.

[36:42] He is without a doubt.

[36:43] He's the smartest man in pinball.

[36:45] He sits above it all and he's able to navigate that big ship.

[36:49] I mean, navigating stern is like navigating the Titanic and he does it tremendously well.

[36:54] And if you ever sit down with George Gomez and I've had the pleasure of doing it a couple

[36:58] of times, you will understand immediately, immediately how smart he is, how passionate he

[37:06] is and how driven he is to make sure they get it right.

[37:10] And it annoys him to know when people think what he does is freaking easy and they

[37:16] could do it themselves.

[37:17] And it's the reason why when stern pinball sees all these other boutique companies pop up,

[37:23] trying to steal their market share.

[37:25] It's the reason why George Gomez is probably thinking in his head, they don't get it at

[37:32] all. And I'm just going to we're going to keep doing what we do.

[37:36] But we're also going to light a cigar and pour some cognac when we watch another one of

[37:42] these dingbats fail because they don't get it.

[37:45] They don't get it.

[37:46] They think just because we're not on pinside, we don't care.

[37:50] They think just because we're not like, you know, chiming in left and right that we don't

[37:55] care. He's probably like, I'm managing 350 people on a daily basis to get you guys.

[38:02] You're not essential toys and I'm trying to make them as good as possible while managing

[38:06] multiple, you know, design schedules at once while managing multiple personalities at

[38:13] once while managing multiple, you know, licensure and vendor issues all at once.

[38:18] He does it.

[38:19] Right.

[38:20] So who is there George Gomez?

[38:22] Do you think double and normal walk into American pinball every day and have that level

[38:28] of understanding what it's going to take to succeed in pinball?

[38:34] I don't think so.

[38:36] And here's what they need to do.

[38:37] They need to go higher their George Gomez.

[38:40] Every pinball company to succeed needs to find their George Gomez.

[38:45] And I mean that.

[38:46] And I think the same thing can be said at Jersey Jack pinball is who is Jersey Jack pinball's

[38:51] George Gomez because Jersey Jack to me, Jersey Jack to me is Gary Stern.

[38:57] Right.

[38:57] They're the same guys.

[38:59] Their names are on the company.

[39:01] They are the ones who are like the face of maybe that company.

[39:04] But after those two guys, they need their operations man to put everything in motion.

[39:10] And they almost don't even need to be a part of that.

[39:12] And I don't think Jersey Jack pinball has their George Gomez.

[39:17] And it's the reason why I think Jersey Jack pinballs are oftentimes lacking

[39:23] cohesiveness are lacking like a design decision and direction.

[39:27] And I think all their games always fall a little bit short here and there because I think

[39:32] they don't have their George Gomez who sits above stuff and quite gets it and drives

[39:37] them to do it.

[39:38] And again, I mean this.

[39:39] I think you're going to see over the next 12 months of Stern pinball.

[39:43] I think you're going to see them start to fire off on all cylinders.

[39:47] And I think it's going to be a wonderful thing.

[39:50] And I think if nobody else can figure out who their George Gomez is, I think they're

[39:54] going to struggle.

[39:55] I absolutely do because the other thing and the most important thing is this.

[40:00] And you could say what you will about like who's putting quality in and who's

[40:04] making premium pinball experiences.

[40:06] The other thing that George Gomez does, his main job is to make the company money.

[40:14] Are you doing something people want that will make us money?

[40:18] Can you combine passion with profit?

[40:21] He understands how to do that.

[40:25] Yeah, they might not knock it out of the park every time, but I've bet you they've made

[40:30] money on every game.

[40:32] Even if it doesn't sell tremendously well, there's still going to make money on black

[40:36] night.

[40:37] That's part of running a successful business.

[40:40] I think everybody else when they get delays, when they get hiccups, when they hit

[40:45] walls, when when pirates of the Caribbean is not on the line for an entire year,

[40:51] Jersey Jack Pimball is losing tons of money.

[40:55] Right.

[40:55] And a lot of that comes down to you.

[40:57] If you ask Jack, they didn't order parts for pirates.

[41:01] They almost didn't even have faith or belief in their own game.

[41:05] That by the time pirates of the Caribbean demand spiked, it spiked.

[41:09] People love this game.

[41:11] They are now buying it used for thousands more than it was new.

[41:15] When the demand for the game spiked, guess what?

[41:17] They had no games to make because they didn't order the parts because they just wanted

[41:25] to move away from it.

[41:26] That was a bad decision in hindsight because they didn't have their George Gomez, right?

[41:32] Stern will keep a game on the line for years.

[41:34] Even if it's not juggernaut sales, they'll just still make it available and they'll have

[41:38] the parts there to do another run if distributor orders come in.

[41:43] Jersey Jack didn't have that.

[41:45] They didn't even, they couldn't even make them if they wanted to.

[41:48] All right.

[41:49] I went off on a little bit of a tangent here and I wanted to.

[41:53] I wanted to because it's can you just bimball podcasts and that's what we do.

[41:56] But man, in your life and anything you do, if you work for a company, find your George Gomez

[42:01] and you'll be successful because the guy is just that good.

[42:04] And I think we're about to see with him at the helm and these designers inspired by him.

[42:10] And I think you're going to start to see some pinball magic coming from Stern more and more this year.

[42:14] All right.

[42:15] Everyone, this has been episode 373 of Canadian pinball podcast.
