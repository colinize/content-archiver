[00:00] A Soul Slides Away, But Don't Look Back in Anger, I Heard You Say.

[00:10] Sit Up, Sit Up, Sit Up, Sit Up, Sit Up, Sit Up, Sit Up.

[00:30] It is Thursday afternoon, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast. Let's talk about what's happened over the last 24 hours.

[00:37] So, the design team over at Stern Pinball has streamed the game. This is great. They stream the game right away.

[00:44] It's always nice to see more of a game when you are being asked by your distributors to pony up $13,000 for the FOMO version of the game, the LE.

[00:56] So, we got about 35 minutes from the design team showing us King Kong. What do we think now?

[01:03] Have the gripes around the artworks subside it? Does the game come together now that you've seen it?

[01:10] Is there enough in this game? Carrie Hardy is saying this might be the next Godzilla, the greatest game of all time.

[01:19] Nobody knows. I don't know. You don't know. What I do know is I think each and every one of us is seeing a game that looks like a lot of fun.

[01:30] I mean, you can't really like Pinball and not watch a stream of that game and not want to hop on it.

[01:38] That doesn't mean you have to buy it. It doesn't mean I saw enough to want to own one.

[01:43] But from a pure Pinball standpoint, Keith Elwyn once again has delivered a game that has a lot in it.

[01:51] It's got a lot of things to shoot at. It's got a lot of code in it.

[01:56] And there's obviously a lot more coming in this game code-wise.

[02:00] But here's my thing about King Kong. And it's like more of like my macro observation of this game.

[02:06] And you think about the Keith Elwyn machines recently that people really love. You got Jaws and you got a game like Godzilla.

[02:14] Okay, so just let's take those two games, for example.

[02:17] Imagine if Jaws and Godzilla, imagine if nothing in the gameplay changed at all.

[02:24] Same mechanism, same artwork, same toys, same layout.

[02:29] Imagine if nothing there changed. But imagine if both Jaws Pinball and Godzilla on the screen had animations and not live action footage.

[02:42] Imagine if they took scene for scene, second for second, and they just animated everything that was on those screens.

[02:49] So you'd have animated Roy Scheider, you'd have an animated shark, you'd have everything animated.

[02:55] Same thing with Godzilla. Animate all of those Godzilla clips and make it more like King Kong.

[03:01] And here's what's crazy. Is I think the animations in King Kong look really good. They're a little bit disjointed.

[03:09] It's hard to kind of follow a little bit as I was watching the stream because you're like bouncing back and forth between some jungle stuff.

[03:18] Then he's in a city throwing taxi cabs. Then I'm back in a jungle with a spider. Now I'm climbing a building.

[03:25] It's all over the place and I'm not sure how I feel about that. It doesn't feel like I'm on this journey.

[03:32] It doesn't feel like there's a progression that makes much sense. It's like everything's happening at the same time.

[03:38] And I don't know. I don't know how I feel about that. It just feels disjointed.

[03:42] We did have the same complaint about Jaws early on. That it did feel disjointed and as that code matured, I think things got a lot more cohesive.

[03:53] So this game is still early on when it comes to software. So maybe it is going to become more cohesive.

[03:59] But my point being this, if Godzilla and Jaws were animated like this game is, I don't think they would have nearly as much appeal.

[04:10] There's something about when you go animate it with the game. It feels more like a Netflix cartoon.

[04:17] It feels a little bit more like it's for kids. And you lose a lot of what was in those King Kong movies because you lose the ability to create more of an emotional connection with the subject matter.

[04:31] And it feels more childlike. And that's also what a lot of the griping is around the cabinet artwork is.

[04:37] It just feels more like a comic book. It's almost like King Kong vs X-Men.

[04:43] It feels like King Kong is a special guest in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle episode.

[04:48] That's what the artwork starts to feel like. It doesn't feel like the iconic Kong imagery a lot of people are used to.

[04:56] But that being said, what's here in pinball format looks really cool. And it looks really fun. And I can't wait to play one.

[05:06] I think that's like a healthy way to process what we've seen on this game so far.

[05:11] It's not the artistic direction I would have gone in. I would have liked it to have felt a lot more like a jungle and a city without so many bright colors.

[05:21] The palette I think is all off. People are saying King Kong looks more blue than he does gray.

[05:29] Isn't he a silver back gorilla? I think he's kind of all over the place. The toy looks gray and silver.

[05:35] But some of those Kong images in the game and on the cabinet look a lot more blueish.

[05:40] But who cares? We're grown men complaining about the hue color of King Kong pinball that costs $13,000 or $7,000.

[05:51] I know there's a lot of people that are going to miss the gong in the pro of the game.

[05:56] But man, for half the price, a stern pro is not a bad buy. You're going to get most of the game.

[06:04] And also historically speaking, stern pros are the only things that hold value these days.

[06:09] Like it holds better value than the LE. Will this King Kong LE sell out? I think it will. I do.

[06:17] Will it hold value like Jaws? I don't think so. I really don't.

[06:22] I think this game is going to be really fun for people. I don't think it's going to be a bolt to your floor game for years, though.

[06:29] And I don't think it has the same personality as Godzilla does. I don't think it has the same personality as Jaws.

[06:38] And again, it's because of the animated nature of the game.

[06:42] Remember Jurassic Park, when it comes to the Keith Elwyn games, once they made more LEs of Jurassic Park and now there's a thousand LEs out there,

[06:51] it's not nearly as in demand as Godzilla.

[06:56] But if Jurassic Park had the movie clips and had the moments that we remember and love on that screen,

[07:04] I think Jurassic Park would be much more of a bolted to your floor game.

[07:09] So it just begs the question, like how many more times is Stern going to go down this road?

[07:14] Now look, the animations, though, when you think about it, I think it's unfair to say these animations aren't good.

[07:20] It's like everyone forgot where we came from. We used to get DMDs in games for like two decades,

[07:26] and now we've got this on a screen and you're going to complain?

[07:30] I mean, the animations are pretty damn good for a pinball machine. I don't know what you're expecting.

[07:35] I'm not going to get like PlayStation 5 graphics in a pinball machine, and I know everybody would prefer some movie clips from the King Kong films,

[07:43] but as far as animations go, these are pretty damn good.

[07:47] Show me another company's animations that are this damn good, with no other source material.

[07:53] I think they're pretty damn good.

[07:55] But after watching the stream for 35 minutes and seeing the animations over and over again,

[08:01] I do feel like it lacked a little excitement, and by that, I mean, I think that just has to do with how I'm connecting with the material.

[08:10] It's also because I'm not playing the game. I'm watching a stream of the game.

[08:14] So watching this game being streamed, the gameplay looked great. The shots looked amazing.

[08:20] There's a lot of fun stuff in the code. It still feels like a lot of clips crashing over each other,

[08:26] so I'm not sure how it's going to be, but I think they're going to do a lot of fun stuff with this game software-wise,

[08:33] and I think there's a lot on that play field to like.

[08:36] For those of you saying, like, why is King Kong hitting a subway car, he's famous for doing that, for wrecking a city's public transportation,

[08:44] so I don't have a problem with that at all.

[08:47] Would I have liked King Kong to have swatted the balls with his hands? I think that was the initial plan with the mechanism.

[08:53] Yes, at least he hits something and is more interactive with the game itself.

[08:58] But man, this game should have had an Empire State Building. The fact that there's no Empire State Building is still a huge miss in this game.

[09:05] I don't care if it's on the screen. It should have been a mechanical thing in the game.

[09:10] So that's it. The good news is, is the media are there today, and Stern's making these games.

[09:15] I mean, there's like an ocean of them being made right now.

[09:19] So this game's gonna make it out into the world in just a few weeks, and we're all gonna get a chance to play it very soon.

[09:26] That is awesome. That's how you do it.

[09:30] Then I went and watched Gameplay of Barrels of Fun's new game, Dune Pimbal.

[09:35] And I feel bad, because I don't even want to evaluate this game right now,

[09:40] because there's really not a lot of code in the game right now.

[09:44] On some of the gameplay streams, there's almost like no code in the game.

[09:48] The screen itself is just like the desert. There's like no movie clips.

[09:52] Nothing is happening up there, and it's pretty barren like the desert.

[09:56] And then there's other clips I saw where there are movie clips, but it says pending licensure approval.

[10:02] So wait a minute. It just feels like this game's not ready.

[10:06] It's not ready to show us yet. I mean, how can you release a game when your movie clips have to have a watermark on them,

[10:15] that it's not ready for licensure approval? So when is that gonna be?

[10:19] And I just want to be able to evaluate Dune Pimbal when it's got the fun stuff in it,

[10:25] and software is so necessary in creating the environment of a game.

[10:30] I really like the sandworm mechanism. I think it's super awesome.

[10:33] It's one of the coolest toys I've seen in Pimbal in a long time.

[10:37] But in watching more of the gameplay and going back and forth between Dune and King Kong,

[10:42] it's clear that Kong has a lot more to shoot at, has a lot more going on in the game.

[10:49] Now Kong does not have a mech that's as impressive as that sandworm,

[10:54] and boy, are these games the opposite of the spectrum when it comes to artwork and colors and brightness, right?

[11:01] One game is brown and sand colored, and the other game has got every color in the rainbow.

[11:07] If you put these two games next to each other, you would have the widest spectrum of color palettes ever in the history of Pimbal,

[11:15] and the only thing that would make it more so if you had a black and white version of Godzilla next to King Kong.

[11:20] The other thing in the Dune stream, and I'm trying to get a sense of what it's like when you're playing it,

[11:26] the expression lighting system in that game, for some reason, it reflects onto the play field,

[11:33] and you can see all those little tiny lights from the system reflecting onto the game itself.

[11:39] I'm not sure from a player's perspective if you see that, but it's really, really off-putting and distracting,

[11:46] so I'm wondering what it feels like when you stand over the game.

[11:50] And that's where my feelings are on Dune right now. I almost don't want to say too much until I see more of the game.

[11:57] It's a shame because you really only get one chance to make a first impression,

[12:02] and it just doesn't feel like this game is ready yet, and again, it's because those assets are not in the game.

[12:09] And so you don't really know what you're getting yet, and I think Stern had a much better reveal of King Kong than Barrels did of Dune.

[12:19] And so I don't know why Barrels didn't just wait a few weeks and get more approval before they revealed the game.

[12:26] I think they need to keep the line going, and they need to get orders in because they'll lose money every week.

[12:32] The line is not making stuff because the line's not making labyrinth right now.

[12:36] We know those orders have to be dried up.

[12:38] And then we also got news the other day that Predator might not even come to America

[12:44] because Pinball Brothers is dealing with tariff issues,

[12:47] and they've been doing interviews that have basically been saying that we might need to halt production of our product because of tariffs.

[12:56] And so what does that mean for Predator, which was supposed to come out in two weeks,

[13:01] and now it's up in the air on whether or not this game will even be revealed or even be on the line anytime soon.

[13:08] So that's a bummer because out of all the themes, it really was Predator.

[13:13] That was the one that I was most excited for just on a theme level out of all four of these themes.

[13:19] And so now it's interesting when we're going to see Harry Potter.

[13:23] They turned on their marketing for the game.

[13:25] They definitely wanted Harry Potter to be on everyone's mind before we saw King Kong.

[13:31] Now that we've seen King Kong, what do you think is going to happen?

[13:35] Do you think Jersey Jack is still in a rush to get us Harry Potter?

[13:39] Do you think they're ultra confident now that they can easily beat King Kong so they can wait a little bit longer?

[13:45] I'm also hearing that there's licensing delays on Harry Potter as well.

[13:50] I'm not sure about that, but I think a lot of people think about it.

[13:53] If you didn't order a Kong LE and you didn't order Dune yet, you're really going to wait to see Harry Potter before you pull the trigger.

[14:01] I mean, that's the smart move to make.

[14:03] And even when you do see Harry Potter, we know they're going to make this game for years.

[14:08] So it's a really good time, everybody, to welcome in all these new games.

[14:13] It's fun debating these games. It's fun critiquing these games. It is.

[14:18] You know, I see some people out there. It's like you're not allowed to say negative stuff about Pimbal.

[14:22] Come on, this is what we love. We love giving our opinions.

[14:26] Most of us are not that talented.

[14:28] Most of us couldn't even glue together a stick figure, let alone assemble a Pimbal machine.

[14:33] So I want to say kudos to the teams over at Barrels of Fun, the team at Stern Pimbal.

[14:40] What you guys do is not easy. What you men and women do is not easy at all.

[14:46] And I know it's frustrating. You work so hard on these games, and then you turn on Pinside and you listen to Canada

[14:53] and you listen to the very community that you are trying to excite.

[14:58] And you're getting met with so much anger, so much hostility.

[15:04] Everyone's got an opinion about how you could have made your product better.

[15:08] And that's got to suck on some level because it's such a small hobby.

[15:13] It's such a niche little community.

[15:15] But in defense of us, the community, y'all did it to yourselves.

[15:20] The moment you ask us for $10,000 to $15,000 for games, we're going to have much stronger opinions now

[15:27] than if these games were like $6,000 or $7,000.

[15:30] And because a lot of us are just priced out of buying all these new and box games,

[15:35] an opinion doesn't cost anything.

[15:37] And so that's why you're getting so many opinions about these games.

[15:41] And look, stuff like artwork, it's subjective.

[15:44] Gameplay is subjective. Fun is subjective.

[15:47] And the reason that's not subjective is how well a game sells.

[15:51] Numbers don't lie.

[15:52] And I think King Kong is going to do well for Stern.

[15:55] I don't think it's going to do extraordinarily well for Stern.

[15:59] I don't. I really don't.

[16:00] I don't think it's going to sell like Godzilla did.

[16:02] Remember, Godzilla came out right at the beginning of COVID and it was much cheaper.

[16:07] So I don't think we're going to see that here.

[16:09] I also don't think Kong is as good of a game as Godzilla.

[16:14] I just don't.

[16:15] It might be more fun to shoot, but that animated nature of the game,

[16:19] I think it's going to make more people feel a little bit dissatisfied.

[16:22] It feels a little bit more juvenile and comic book like.

[16:26] It's still going to be fun, but I'm just not sure it's going to sell like Godzilla.

[16:30] I don't know how well Jaws sold.

[16:33] I think it sold pretty well.

[16:34] So we shall see.

[16:35] I wish these companies were more transparent about how many games they sold

[16:39] when every new game comes out.

[16:41] It would be nice at the end of the year to get like an earnings report from these companies.

[16:46] It's a lot easier with the boutiques because you know now,

[16:49] Spooky sold 888 evil deads.

[16:52] Do I think they're going to sell a thousand Dune machines?

[16:55] Not yet. Not yet.

[16:57] Now look, if barrels of fun announced Goonies,

[17:01] they would have sold a thousand in one day,

[17:05] even with incomplete software.

[17:07] So it just goes to show you when you don't nail the theme,

[17:11] it's going to be a slow burn to get 1000 people to spend 11 6 plus on a Dune machine.

[17:18] So I hope they get that software in sooner than later.

[17:22] So we can look at this machine with more of their vision for it.

[17:26] Everybody, my voice is shot.

[17:28] Have a good Friday tomorrow.

[17:30] It is good Friday tomorrow.

[17:32] Why don't we all do this?

[17:33] Why don't we on good Friday just turn off pin side,

[17:37] turn off the Internet,

[17:39] stop worrying about these pinball games.

[17:42] It's all going to be all right.

[17:44] None of this matters that much.

[17:46] It's not worth getting that bent out of shape over.

[17:50] I think both of these games brought some really interesting things into the pinball world.

[17:55] Neither one of them is a theme I would have selected

[17:58] and both of them have an artistic approach that is very polarizing.

[18:04] And ultimately the customers will decide and the market will decide

[18:09] if enough is in these games to warrant the prices.

[18:13] Everybody have a great day.

[18:14] We'll talk to you soon.

[18:28] I heard you say
