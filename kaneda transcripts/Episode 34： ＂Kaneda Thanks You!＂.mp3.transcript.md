[00:00] I don't need their blessing now

[00:02] I don't need their reputation

[00:04] He'll always shut me down

[00:06] What I take this path I take it

[00:08] And maybe I'll be left out

[00:10] Never let this be my city

[00:12] Yeah, let you get that blessing now

[00:14] Forget me now

[00:15] Cause I was never welcome

[00:19] No promise never welcome

[00:24] Well, it's never welcome

[00:26] Yes

[00:31] If you can't say something nice

[00:35] Don't say nothing at all

[00:39] That's right

[00:40] It's a Sunday here in New York City

[00:42] It's a day remembrance, a day of thanks

[00:45] And we're gonna do something a little bit different on Knators Pinball Podcast today

[00:49] Episode number 34

[00:51] We are going to say thank you

[00:53] To all the different reasons

[00:56] Why we love Pinball

[00:57] We're gonna say thank you to all the different people in the hobby and in the community

[01:02] That we think are important

[01:04] That make this whole thing interesting on a daily basis

[01:07] And why are we doing this?

[01:09] Why is Canada gonna say thank you

[01:11] And not put up a typical podcast?

[01:14] I think one of the main reasons is that

[01:16] You've been reading a lot on the forums recently

[01:19] And people bickering about drains on ghost busters and magnetic slings

[01:24] And there's always so much that we're unhappy about or fine fault with

[01:29] And we're all guilty of that

[01:30] So I think it's a good to every once in a while

[01:33] Say time out, step back, and give thanks to the Pinball hobby

[01:37] Now the list I'm about to go down of things I want to thank are in no particular order

[01:42] They're not alphabetical

[01:44] I just wrote down a list of things that I wanted to say thank you to

[01:48] And a list of people I wanted to say thank you to

[01:50] So without further ado

[01:52] Let's get going the first thing I want to thank are the men and women who won't grow up

[01:58] And what do I mean by that? I don't mean pin-side babies

[02:00] I mean the men and women out there who stay young at heart

[02:04] It is these individuals that keep pinball alive

[02:08] You know when you get into your 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s

[02:13] There's so much pressure on people to behave that age

[02:17] And one of the things I've noticed in all of my friends and people that I see growing up

[02:21] They usually let go of the things of their childhood, of the toys of the childhood that they played with

[02:27] And I hate that I always think people should keep the things that they love

[02:32] Especially things they love as a kid

[02:34] They should keep those things around them into their adulthoods

[02:38] And without those individuals, without the men and women who say

[02:42] You know I still want to have a pinball machine in my world

[02:45] I still want to have one in the home

[02:47] It is without these individuals, there would be no pinball

[02:51] You know because pinball would be dead, a lot of things would be dead

[02:55] If people grew up and acted like adults

[02:58] I always say I don't ever want to act like an adult

[03:01] Because when I see people acting their age when they're 40, 50, 60

[03:05] It's usually not a lot of fun

[03:08] So to all of you out there who stay young at heart, thank you

[03:11] I appreciate it and you keep this hobby going strong

[03:15] With that being said, we have to thank the men

[03:19] And I'm just going to say men here because I believe it to be men

[03:22] Even though there's probably strong women behind each of them that keeps them going too

[03:25] But I want to thank the men who keep making pinball possible

[03:30] And there's so many of you out there from coders to artists to manufacturers

[03:35] But I want to just highlight sort of the specific people that are at the top of the mountain for organizations

[03:41] I keep pinball going

[03:43] And the first person I want to say thank you to is Gary Stern

[03:47] And I have to say, Gary, without Gary, there would be no pin-side

[03:53] There would be no future for pinball

[03:55] There would be no discussion about pinball in the current day

[03:59] Because Gary Stern single-handedly kept pinball alive

[04:03] When pinball was headed for obsolescence

[04:06] In its dark years when no one was playing pinball

[04:10] Nobody was buying pinball

[04:12] Our kids were dying

[04:14] Companies were getting out of the pinball business

[04:16] He single-handedly stayed in it

[04:18] And I have to say this

[04:20] I know Gary gets up there a lot and says, I'm a manufacturer

[04:24] First and foremost, Stern is a manufacturing company

[04:26] We're not a pinball company

[04:28] I want to call BS on that

[04:30] Because Stern, Gary Stern loves pinball

[04:34] Well, yes, they can manufacture pinball effectively

[04:36] And they could do other things as well

[04:38] He loves pinball, that's why they stayed in it

[04:40] You don't need to know anything else other than ballet Williams

[04:44] Close this pinball shop up

[04:46] They didn't even sell it

[04:48] They just got out of it completely

[04:50] And went on to make other things like slot machines

[04:52] And gambling devices

[04:54] And other machinery that is so much easier to manufacture

[04:56] Makes more money in terms of being on a route for an operator than pinball

[05:02] And they got out completely

[05:04] But Gary, Gary, looked at this machine

[05:08] That's complex

[05:10] That isn't making much money in the current time

[05:12] When everyone else is bailing

[05:14] That's extremely difficult to make

[05:16] And he stayed with it

[05:18] It's because the man in the bottom of his soul loves pinball

[05:20] So Gary, thank you

[05:22] The fact that Stern is still around

[05:24] And you're stronger than ever and you're new factor

[05:26] You've got what eight-nine machines on the line

[05:28] It is incredible that Stern has as many machines on the line

[05:30] As almost everyone else added up together

[05:32] These guys are cranking out each day

[05:34] So Stern, thank you

[05:36] Without you, there wouldn't be any modern pinball

[05:38] The next person I want to thank is George Gomez

[05:42] Who day in and day out

[05:44] Keeps the Stern company going and running

[05:48] The man is incredible

[05:50] Think about how much is on his plate in terms of sourcing where parts come from

[05:54] Making sure he's got the long way

[05:58] Making sure he's got the line moving

[06:00] He's got all these workers who know how to put these machines together

[06:04] And of course every once in a while they're going to make him a game where stuff has to be changed

[06:08] But that's the whole point

[06:10] When you've got thousands and thousands and thousands of games going out

[06:14] And you have all these different parts

[06:16] They're going to get it right and they always do

[06:18] They always do

[06:20] So George Gomez, thank you so much

[06:22] It is great having you at the helm of Stern

[06:24] And we look forward to your next game

[06:26] So George, thank you

[06:28] I want to thank Jersey Jack

[06:30] I mean Jersey Jack has brought

[06:33] Pinball to another level

[06:35] He has taken a risk that I think against

[06:38] All the obstacles that were in front of him

[06:42] He went in and decided to make a modern pinball machine

[06:46] When everyone must have told him he was crazy he went and did it

[06:50] And I know we've all been hypercritical of all the different various business practices

[06:54] And the long waits and all that

[06:56] But the man built a pinball machine

[06:58] And the Wizard of Oz pinball machine

[07:00] We're going to talk about machines specifically later

[07:02] Is a thing of art and so is the hobby

[07:04] We'll talk about those later

[07:06] But Jersey Jack for jumping into a category that is an insane move

[07:10] And for doing it

[07:12] And you had to do it by any means necessary it seems

[07:14] We want to thank you

[07:16] Because without any competition

[07:18] Without any competition

[07:20] We would never see Stern start to up its game

[07:22] Jersey Jack is the reason why we can thank Stern for making a game as beautiful as it goes

[07:27] But we're going to get to that

[07:29] I want to thank Andrew Highway, another one

[07:31] Jumping into the pinball category

[07:33] That is a business move that I think 99 out of 100 financial advisors would tell you is the silly thing to do

[07:40] But these men they love pinball

[07:42] They don't want to start a business that does anything else because they would not feel the level of fulfillment

[07:47] That they get when they make a pinball machine

[07:50] So Andrew Highway from the UK

[07:52] Thank you for bringing pinball back to the UK

[07:56] And thank you for making another alternative for people to buy when they want to buy a new inbox pinball

[08:01] And you've successfully shown that you can make and ship a game

[08:04] So thank you Andrew Highway

[08:06] I want to thank

[08:08] Is it Yap?

[08:09] Job from Dutch pinball

[08:10] I always get these names wrong because the spelling is so out there

[08:13] But Dutch pinball, another group of guys

[08:15] Have to thank these guys for all they've done in terms of the big Lebowski egg

[08:20] And they're the reveal of the Lebowski in 2014, raise the bar

[08:24] Raise the bar on what people expect from a pinball reveal

[08:27] And of course they had their complications and they had their issues

[08:30] But they're a young company they didn't quite understand all the stuff with licensing

[08:34] But they went back and they re-engineered the machine and they made it better

[08:38] And they wanted to make it the best possible machine before they shipped it

[08:41] And now it's in box and it's shipping and it's making it to people's homes

[08:45] So everyone at Dutch pinball, thank you guys for again getting into

[08:50] I think is an insane business to get into

[08:53] And showing that you can make a beautiful pinball machine

[08:56] And then you can put it in a box and you can get it to customers

[08:59] I want to thank Jerry for multi-morphic

[09:01] And of all the people I've mentioned so far, Jerry is the one who's probably the biggest dreamer of them all

[09:07] And he has a whole new platform for pinball

[09:10] It's trying to tackle a pinball solution in so many different areas

[09:14] And you know, I even think sometimes maybe he's trying to solve too many of the issues of pinball

[09:20] But that's what dreamers do

[09:22] That's what innovators do, they look at something and they say you know it's not good enough

[09:25] We can make the following things better

[09:27] And multi-morphic, it looks like it's going to come out this year

[09:30] And we're super excited, Jerry, that you have looked at pinball

[09:33] And you have tried a different approach

[09:35] You should applaud people that don't just cookie-cut

[09:38] And don't just do what's been done before

[09:40] But take quantum leaps forward

[09:42] Will those leaps work out?

[09:44] That is yet to be known

[09:46] But we have to applaud people like this who dream and push the envelope on what pinball can be

[09:50] Without a doubt, without a doubt

[09:53] We have to thank Charlie and Ben Heck from Spooky Pinball

[09:57] I think out of all the people who have jumped in the pinball

[10:01] And said they're going to make pinball games and they're going to make a boutique company

[10:05] And they're going to start small and learn how to do it

[10:08] And they're going to make a limited number

[10:10] And they're going to make sure everyone gets their pin

[10:12] And they're not going to take pre-order dollars

[10:14] I think Spooky Pinball is the pinball company out of all them

[10:18] That the fans of pinball just love the most

[10:21] And they just did it right

[10:23] And they made it work and they're making it work again

[10:26] And it is super exciting to see Rob Zombie come out

[10:29] It's super exciting to see this company grow before our eyes

[10:33] This is the dream of boutique pinball fulfilled

[10:36] And in the proper way it should have been fulfilled

[10:39] And these guys are the model for anyone else that wants to come out there now

[10:43] And start a boutique pinball company

[10:45] So Charlie, Ben and the whole crew of our Spooky, I thank you guys

[10:49] Not just for shipping games, not just for being different

[10:52] But for being accessible and friendly too

[10:54] It shows it's like being part of their family when you hang out with them

[10:57] I love that about that company

[10:59] I want to thank Rick from Planetary Pinball

[11:02] Rick is doing something that people are on the fence about within the community

[11:07] And I'm on the fence too about some of the stuff they're doing

[11:09] But they've remade medieval madness

[11:11] A game that on the second hand market was selling for 12 to $15,000

[11:15] It was super hard to get

[11:17] It was really hard to find one in a nice condition

[11:20] And Rick has remade it

[11:22] And got it to people and I'm sure as we've seen with all pinball

[11:25] There are going to be issues when you take on remaking a pinball game

[11:29] Even making a new one, it's not easy making pinball

[11:32] And everyone agrees with that

[11:34] But Rick is doing something he's not allowing the past to die

[11:37] He is going to bring back titles that have never been experienced by people in new unbox before

[11:43] He's going to bring new technologies to those games

[11:46] Make them even better

[11:48] The colored dots from medieval madness

[11:50] It's going to be incredible when that finally comes out

[11:53] And sure, who knows what that's going to do to the pinball market when you have new games coming back out they were old

[11:59] But that's just it, it doesn't matter, it's going to happen

[12:02] Whether we like it or not

[12:04] And I think Rick should be congratulated for remaking games

[12:07] I don't even know where to begin doing something like that

[12:09] And they've gotten games out of the people

[12:11] I want to also just thank all the people out there who are making homebrew games

[12:17] Mr. Cuggler, Cougler, did I say it right?

[12:20] And all the other people out there, the people making the minions pinball

[12:23] The people made the Matrix pinball, the people who are doing Buffy the Vampire Slayer

[12:27] All the people that are saying, you know, there's a theme out there that I would love to see in pinball

[12:31] And I'm just going to go make it

[12:33] God, that's amazing

[12:35] When you look at the amount of time and effort that goes into making these one-off custom games

[12:39] It's absolutely incredible, it just goes to show that there are so many individuals out there that just love pinball so much

[12:45] They're going to spend countless hours and resources of their own time and money to do it

[12:52] And then share it with us and then bring it to shows and let us play it

[12:55] And that's incredible, it's absolutely incredible

[12:58] So I want to thank all of those guys out there

[13:00] There's too many to list, there's so many fun projects going on

[13:03] I want to thank Scott from Riot Pinball who made Rath of Olympus

[13:10] I love what Scott did and I love the fact that he built this game

[13:15] And he did the most responsible thing of I think the year when he said, look, if you want to make Rath of Olympus

[13:24] We need to make a hundred of them and if you want to come in on it, here's the game he brought it to shows

[13:28] That's not cheap building that thing, it's not cheap bringing it to shows

[13:31] Let people play it, let them make up their mind

[13:34] And he said, hey, if we don't get a hundred, we're not going to be able to go into manufacturing and production of this machine

[13:39] And they didn't reach that number but Scott never took pre-order dollars

[13:43] He never let everyone just send money in and then realize the numbers weren't going to work

[13:47] And then have people lose their money or have the lay is on refunds

[13:50] He did it right and I think that's the way to do it

[13:53] You need to build your machine, show it to people and then ask for their money

[13:57] It's something that doesn't always happen in the hobby, it's something we know people have been burned by

[14:01] So I want to thank those people

[14:03] And I'm going to keep going down a list of people we want to thank

[14:06] So let's switch gears from the people who make pinball machines

[14:11] Let's say thank you just to the overall category of people who restore pinball machines

[14:17] Okay, to Chris out there from HEP

[14:20] Even to the people who make the mods, the mezzal mods

[14:24] The whole restore community, the mod community, all the guys who take machines and make them better

[14:30] These people are incredible individuals

[14:33] They don't let games just get lost to wear and tear

[14:38] There's so many games that have been beat past the point of being fun to play

[14:44] Beat past the point of looking good and shooting properly

[14:48] And these individuals, it's amazing to see what they can do in terms of stripping down a game

[14:53] Signing it down to the very wood, even repainting them, restensitling them

[14:58] Rebuilding playfields, putting new parts in, polishing every piece of metal on it

[15:03] The restore community is just an absolutely amazing thing to have

[15:08] I think everyone is very lucky to know that if you have a machine and you want to make it look like it just rolled off the assembly line

[15:15] And make it even better than it rolled off the assembly line

[15:18] There are individuals out there who will do that for you

[15:21] I think we all should be thankful of those individuals

[15:23] And I said it quickly but the modder is out there

[15:26] I love the mod community

[15:28] I think it's incredible that there are individuals out there that make games better

[15:33] That give you these little fun things to put into the game that just enhance the experience

[15:38] The pinball machine is a universe under glass and these individuals make that universe come to life

[15:44] And it's so exciting to see the things they can do

[15:47] When I put a Lord of the Rings like it came from Stern next to my Lord of the Rings

[15:51] It's night and day and mine looks so incredibly different because of the path of the dead mod

[15:59] From guys like pinball refinery, the lighted Gandalf staff, the eye of Sorong

[16:05] All the different things that people made, the mirror blades, all these things

[16:10] It comes down to guys like Cliffey too

[16:13] The guys who make the protectors, let's talk about mods like those

[16:17] The mods that just preserve a pinball machine

[16:19] What we do without Cliffey out there

[16:21] So thank you Cliffey into the mod worlds that is out there making stuff for pinball machines

[16:26] I want to say thank you to the different titles that are about to come out or have come out recently

[16:32] Because it is a new golden age of pinball

[16:35] We live in a time where arcade machines are dead

[16:39] No one buys new inbox or arcade machines

[16:41] It's all councils now

[16:43] The fact that we are still having these 300-400 pound ginormous boxes arrive at our homes is incredible

[16:52] Let's look at the games that we have to be super thankful for that are coming out in 2016 or just came out recently

[17:00] We have to start with Ghostbusters

[17:02] This game is absolutely incredible

[17:05] I've never seen a game get so much attention, so much conversation, and have so much passion behind it

[17:11] We forgot to mention that Zambi Yeti the artist in terms of people who are taking pinball to the next level

[17:18] I think we are blessed to have a guy like him, his talents, providing artwork on Ghostbusters

[17:23] Ghostbusters to me, I think is a single most important pin to come out

[17:28] I want to say in the last 5-10 years

[17:31] And I will tell you why because I think it brings pinball back

[17:34] It brings pinball back to where pinball always used to be

[17:38] And that is, first and foremost, the game needs to be fun

[17:42] It needs to be fun and everything about it should be fun and draw you in

[17:45] The artworks should draw you in, the cabinet art, the play field art, the toys

[17:50] There should be tons to shoot out

[17:52] You should look down at that play field and see the universe of the theme come to life

[17:57] I think for years Stern was just mailing it in getting cookie-cutter and I said it before

[18:02] I think guys like Jersey Jack made them raise their game

[18:05] And this is Stern's awakening pin

[18:08] We are all excited to see even more what comes from Stern down there

[18:12] But I think Ghostbusters represents a turning point in Stern

[18:16] And the bars been raised so high and Ghostbusters is a pin

[18:19] It's shipping right now too

[18:21] We have to be thankful that this pin was revealed, we can discuss it

[18:25] But now it's shipping

[18:27] And that's an incredible thing

[18:29] No one's had their money tied up for years

[18:31] No one's had a wait a long time

[18:33] They didn't lie to people about release dates, it's coming out

[18:37] And what's happening now, we're discussing the outlane drains, we're discussing the magnetic slings

[18:42] And there's so much, I think, skewing a little bit too negative right now

[18:46] I think people should be happy that this game is going to ship

[18:49] And whatever needs to happen to that game to make it the best game possible

[18:53] I think we should be thankful, it's going to happen

[18:56] Guys, whether the outlands may be drained too much, someone will make a fix for it

[19:00] Whether the slimer toy isn't registering, they'll make a fix for it

[19:04] Relax, everything needs to relax

[19:06] I love how people will wait two, three years for a pinball machine

[19:09] And Stern ships a game that people only had a wait a couple months for a month even

[19:14] And people get so anxious and impatient

[19:18] And demand that everything be perfect out of the box

[19:21] Relax, thankful, be thankful that it's out you have it

[19:25] And all the fixes will come, they are not going to cut bait on this

[19:28] This is their most popular machine of, I think, I think this is the best ordered machine they've ever had

[19:34] That's what I'm hearing

[19:35] I want to say thank you to the Hobbit pinball

[19:38] The Hobbit pinball is a beautiful pinball machine

[19:42] You know, say what you will about game player shots or this and that

[19:46] It is hard not to look at the Hobbit and just be in awe of how beautiful that machine is

[19:50] I'm thankful that the Hobbit is shipping

[19:53] I'm thankful for that, for people who love that theme

[19:55] They now have a pinball machine that brings that theme to life

[20:00] And I want to thank Jersey Jack for staying alive to make a second game

[20:04] It's not easy, we all know it

[20:06] And the Hobbit is a machine that we all are hoping to see the best code possible

[20:11] Bring that game to life

[20:13] But I'm thankful the Hobbit exists

[20:15] Because without games like the Hobbit, I don't think Jersey Jack ups its game

[20:20] And I don't think people realize how beautiful pinball machine can be

[20:24] And the quality that can go into a pinball machine

[20:26] So we're thankful for the Hobbit ships

[20:28] I want to thank the Big Lebowski

[20:30] The Big Lebowski is a beautiful pinball machine

[20:33] I remember seeing it at Modern Pinball and they went on their little road tour with the game

[20:37] And I was blown away by the way the thing looked

[20:40] I think it's a really fun theme

[20:42] I'm thankful that it's finally done

[20:45] I hope people get their machines quickly

[20:48] But the fact that it's shipping says a very positive thing

[20:52] That the Dutch pinball guys have done it

[20:55] They probably showed the game too early

[20:57] But that's a mistake that a lot of these guys make

[21:00] So I'm thankful they stuck it out

[21:02] And they made the machine and it's in a box

[21:04] And I look forward to seeing people getting the Big Lebowski opening it up, playing it

[21:08] And seeing how that game comes to life

[21:10] And seeing how the code progresses in that game

[21:12] And what it ends up becoming

[21:14] And it has all the right theme, the right artwork

[21:18] It has all the things on the outside and the shots to be a really fun pinball machine

[21:22] And I hope it knocks it out the park

[21:24] I want to thanks Dern for making Spider-Man VE

[21:27] They really made that game look twice as good as a Spider-Man before it

[21:32] And I know they raised the price a little bit but they did a lot more work than people were expecting

[21:36] They changed the dots, they changed the toys, they changed the art

[21:39] They made the Spider-Man game that I think is going to be the one that people look for

[21:44] Years down the road

[21:45] And that game is an amazing game

[21:47] So I'm thankful that Dern is going to look at the classics and remake them

[21:51] When they can make them better or add something to it

[21:53] Yes, I hope they don't just remake a game as the same game

[21:57] But if they remake Tron with the old Disney sort of classic look and feel to it

[22:02] You can't tell me guys that you won't be thankful and run to buy that game

[22:06] So I think it's fun to see Dern exploring vault additions and bringing old games back

[22:11] I would even go buy a load of rings if they redid the art and redid some stuff on that

[22:15] And fix some of the issues and made the best version of Lord of the Rings and made it a limited run

[22:20] And I'm thankful that they even allow us that option

[22:23] Can we just be thankful in general for the options we get?

[22:26] Nobody makes us buy anything, right?

[22:28] So thanks Dern for giving us the option to do these things

[22:31] I want to say thank you to the Wizard of Oz

[22:34] The Wizard of Oz I still think is like Christmas under the play field

[22:38] There is so many toys and things to shoot at and lights and whatnot

[22:42] I mean that is Jersey Jack's statement pin

[22:45] He came out and he said I need to make a game that just puts everything I have into it

[22:51] A game that hearkens back to the Valley Williams days

[22:54] And I think Jack succeeded in making a pinball machine that at the end of its run

[22:59] After all the issues they had with that game

[23:02] When the code came to life and people now are saying that this game is sort of like a future classic

[23:11] I'm glad that that game finally got through all the Quagmire's that got stuck in

[23:18] And people are really happy with it and really satisfied with it

[23:21] And that's all that matters

[23:23] Is I think that everyone who owns a Wizard of Oz has it and is having fun with it

[23:28] And that's all that matters

[23:30] Be thankful that you can buy a beautiful looking pin like that

[23:33] That does look, levels above anything else that's out there right now

[23:37] And it's fun and it's different and it's not the same old kind of pin

[23:41] I think we should be thankful that that happened

[23:44] I want to thank Full Throttle

[23:47] Full Throttle from Highway Pinball for being out there

[23:50] I think it's great that Andrew built his first machine, got it on the assembly line

[23:55] And proved a point that Highway can build a pinball machine

[23:58] Yes, I don't think that titles for everyone

[24:00] I don't think the theme appeals to everyone

[24:02] But it's not for me

[24:04] But am I thankful they did it?

[24:06] Yes, I'm thankful for they did it

[24:08] Because I think more machines out there, more competition out there

[24:11] Makes everyone's machines better

[24:14] That's the thing that's great about competitions

[24:17] If there's just one guy making games

[24:19] Then you have what Stern was doing years ago

[24:22] Games like CSI, you know you start to just get these like cookie cutter looking games

[24:26] Because there's no point in improving your offering

[24:30] Because there's no competition

[24:31] So I want to thank Full Throttle

[24:33] I want to thank Alien Pinball from Highway

[24:35] I think Alien is a great theme

[24:37] And I think it deserves a pinball machine

[24:39] And we'll see what happens with that pinball machine

[24:41] We're all anxiously awaiting the next video

[24:43] And the reveal of the full play field

[24:45] And I said I'm really not going to say anything else about this pinball machine

[24:48] Until I see the reveal

[24:49] Because there's not enough to judge right now

[24:51] So we hope they're knocking out of the park

[24:53] But I'm thankful it's going to happen

[24:54] I'm thankful we're going to get something to react to soon

[24:57] And then lastly I just want to say thanks for thankful for Game of Thrones and World Nelly

[25:03] I'm thankful for all the machines that Stern is shipping

[25:05] They're still even making stuff I think like Metallica and Star Trek and stuff still falling off the line

[25:10] But yeah, I'm just thankful all these games are coming out

[25:13] And there's more to come

[25:14] There's more to come and that's exciting

[25:16] Alright so lastly I just want to thank some people

[25:18] And some of these are going to be hard to thank

[25:20] But I want to, this is it, this is Sunday, Canada

[25:22] This is a day of thanks

[25:24] First I want to thank Robin for making Pinside

[25:28] Why is this guy dealing with it?

[25:30] I don't even know

[25:32] He's not making a lot of money off of it, he's not monetizing the site

[25:35] But the guy has made a forum where people can come on every day and talk about pinball

[25:40] And he's made the best forum out of all the forums I've seen

[25:43] I've been on all the different gaming forums and blogs and hangouts

[25:48] And Pinside is just the best, it looks the best, it aggregates the content the best

[25:52] It's such a better system than everything else I've ever seen out there

[25:56] So I want to thank Robin for doing it

[25:58] And it's got to be a selfless job

[26:01] I can't imagine being Pinside and doing all this work

[26:05] And at times, seemingly there's no financial reason to do it

[26:12] Just for the love of pinball I guess

[26:14] But Robin, thank you for creating Pinside

[26:16] I think it's a great place

[26:18] And I want to thank the moderation team on Pinside

[26:22] And I'm saying all these things, I'm not, I have no agenda, I'm not trying to get back on Pinside

[26:27] I've been off it for a few months and I'm happy doing this and where I'm at

[26:30] So I just want to say this, I'm just thanking these guys because the moderation team

[26:33] And talk about the most thankless job

[26:35] These guys have to hear grown men constantly emailing them and wanting to them all the time about pinball conversations

[26:42] Can you imagine that? Like you're literally getting emailed in PM constantly by grown men

[26:48] Who can't handle pinball conversations who need you to take action

[26:52] And these guys, for the most part, they all have jobs, they have families, they have other things they want to be doing

[26:57] And they've got to swoop in and constantly doing stuff

[27:00] So moderation team, I know you guys have the most thankless job on the planet, thank you

[27:05] I want to thank Wise Snow

[27:07] I want to thank guys like Hilton and Wise Snow, they're the same guy by the way

[27:11] But I want to thank him and all the operators out there who are operating pinball

[27:15] I mean at the end of the day, pinball is dying or not if not dead as a thing to put in the world to make money on

[27:25] As much as there are barcades popping up and there are certain bars that have pinball machines

[27:29] It's still got to be freaking hard to drop like a $5 to $8,000 machine inside a bar and make your money back on it

[27:37] It can't be that easy, but these guys do it and they love pinball and they keep pinball live out in the wild

[27:44] Which I think is the most important place to have pinball because you can put all the pinball machines in your home

[27:50] But that's not really the best environment to play pinball

[27:53] It really is out there with friends, drinking beers, for people games and just having fun on the machine

[28:00] I get the home collecting is where the future is at and I'm going to thank you guys in a second

[28:06] But the operator is to serve a round of applause for keeping pinball in the wild

[28:11] Which is where games were intended to be

[28:14] I want to thank guys like Ted and Beasel Boobe out there for adding comic relief to the community

[28:21] Constantly making jokes and having fun with people and keeping people lighthearted

[28:27] I know sometimes we all have a tendency on there and people on there to just get too serious and take things to heart

[28:35] But there needs to be comic relief constantly on a site about Gromand talking about pinball

[28:41] So guys, thanks for your constant additions to the forums

[28:45] I think it's great that people chime in and take some of the heaviness out of the discussion

[28:51] I want to thank guys like Vid for just the wealth of information

[28:56] This guy knows more about pinball than almost anybody and he shares it

[29:02] That's the thing too, it's one thing to just know something

[29:05] It's another thing to spend a lot of time going on there and helping to educate people and share your information with them

[29:11] And with that, I think with the thank all the people out there in the community not just on forums

[29:18] But just that are just helpful, that are just helpful out there

[29:22] I want to thank guys like Al and Eddie Kramer and different guys in the pinball community who fix machines

[29:31] And put machines on location

[29:34] I've never been in a hobby where if you ever have an issue, there's usually guys like locally who can come help

[29:40] They'll drive to your house and help you fix something, I mean it's incredible

[29:44] I'm super thankful for that because I wouldn't know what to do

[29:46] Most of us out there wouldn't know what to do

[29:48] We rely on these people to keep our machines running

[29:52] I want to say thank you to guys like Fralic

[29:55] Guys who buy new and box pinball machines, guys who collect in the home

[29:59] You guys know who you are without you guys, there really won't be a future because the future is the home collector

[30:06] And that requires people to sink a heavy financial investment into the hobby

[30:12] Let's be honest, every machine is a vacation, you're not going on with your wife and kids

[30:18] Every machine is Apple stock, you're not buying

[30:22] Every machine is savings, you're not putting away

[30:25] So it's not easy to always justify these machines coming to the door for most people

[30:30] So I want to thank you guys for I know putting up with a lot of heat sometimes

[30:35] From your significant others when it comes to buying new and box pinball machines

[30:39] But I want to thank you guys for keeping your machines in good condition

[30:42] And then selling them and passing them on to the next person

[30:45] Because so much of what keeps the pinball economy going is the buying and selling the machines

[30:51] And I think it's great, it's so easy, it's so easy to find usually a machine you want in great condition

[30:57] And have it in your game room within a week

[31:00] I had a game come all the way from Canada and it was a little bit more difficult but it's still got here

[31:05] I mean it looks great

[31:08] So I definitely want to thank the community who buys and sells machines and keeps it going

[31:15] And also lastly I just want to thank all the podcasts that are out there

[31:21] Coast to coast podcasts, Nate Shivers, Nate you know I love you

[31:24] I've always loved Coast to coast, he's the main reason why I even did a podcast

[31:28] I want to thank Don and Jeff, I want to thank the pinball podcast, that flipping contest

[31:33] I want to thank Jack Danger, Dead Flip, all the guys on Twitch that are streaming

[31:37] The Pinheads podcast out of Australia, Coinbox podcast

[31:43] I love the spooky podcast, I love all the ones that are out there

[31:46] There's more that I haven't even mentioned but I think it's just great that for you guys that really want to just listen to people talk about pinball

[31:53] You know you have it out there, you have all these different options to choose from

[31:58] And with that I just want to end by saying I want to thank every single person who listens to Canadian's pinball podcast

[32:04] Whether you like the show or hate the show, I want to thank you for tuning in on a weekly basis and hearing what we have to say

[32:11] I want to thank the people who have discussed this podcast, I want to thank the people who refused to listen to it

[32:18] You know I think they'd be entertained if they did but I like I want to thank everyone out there who even consider listening to Canadian's pinball podcast

[32:25] Now there were a few people I wanted to thank that I was hesitant because I was like how I want to say something nice about every game, every person

[32:32] And just a night you know everyone can find something nice to say about somebody so let's there were some individuals that I was hesitant

[32:38] And like could I find something nice so let me let me there's a few of them let me let me call him out right now

[32:43] John Papaduke, John Papaduke now let's see I do want to thank John Papaduke for his contributions to pinball

[32:51] I think his games were some of the most beautiful games ever and I think he was way ahead of his time

[32:57] And I think no one would disagree with that I think his machines were beautiful they were magical and they were fun

[33:03] And that's what pinball should be and I am as disappointed in him as the rest of you are

[33:10] But what I am thankful and there is a silver lining in what happened with Zidware I am thankful that everyone now thinks twice about preordering a pinball machine

[33:20] Okay there was two people that made made us all now think twice before we invest and that's John Papaduke

[33:26] And the second guy I'm thankful for is Kevin Koolik

[33:30] Now Kevin what am I thankful to Kevin about let's see

[33:34] Well I am thankful my best friend's name is Kevin so I do like his name but no I think what I'm thankful for is that Kevin Koolik is also shown people

[33:46] But even if you build the game right so he got further along than John did with with any of those Zidware games

[33:52] Even if you build the game and put it out in front of people doesn't mean you have the ability to manufacture

[33:57] And I think I'm thankful that people are now smarter they are smarter about where to think their money

[34:04] And I think that's something that even though people went through some pain and lost a lot of money

[34:10] We are all thankful that we now are smarter positioned to buy new in box pinball machines

[34:15] Alright so like that is this Sunday rainy Sunday

[34:23] Canada's pinball podcast day of thanking and celebrating the people in this hobby

[34:30] And the games in this hobby and just the hobby itself

[34:34] I think we all should be thankful at times and appreciate what we have

[34:38] And realize that these are just machines that are meant for fun

[34:41] They are meant for fun and even though we take things to all these crazy places

[34:47] Because we are so passionate about these toys they are just toys in boxes that are meant to be have fun

[34:53] So I think like a practice when you have in church where you turn to the person to the left and to the right

[34:58] And you say you know peace be with you

[35:00] I think everyone this week should say what they are thankful for a few times in the hobby and to the people they know

[35:07] So that's our episode 34 I want to thank everyone for listening

[35:11] There is going to be some fun fun fun stuff happening this week in pinball

[35:16] The main thing is going to be the gameplay footage of the magnetic slings on Ghostbusters

[35:23] It is going to happen this week so look for my review of that footage when it happens

[35:30] The exciting week I know everyone can't wait to see that

[35:32] It will end all the speculation and it is going to be interesting

[35:35] If people aren't impressed what happens with Ghostbusters moving forward

[35:39] But have a great Sunday evening watch Game of Thrones tonight

[35:44] Tell the people you love that you are thankful they are in your life

[35:47] And give your pinball machines a little kiss tonight

[35:50] Be like here is a kiss from canada from me to you

[35:54] Good night

[35:55] My mother thanks you

[35:57] My father thanks you

[35:59] My sister thanks you

[36:02] And I thank you

[36:04] Thank you
