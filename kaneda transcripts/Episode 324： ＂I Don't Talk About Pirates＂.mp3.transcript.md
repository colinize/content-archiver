[00:00] I got me the Christ Lauren, He Stuffed Party, Totallyorial and !

[00:05] Bring your Chippa TS-Mari!

[00:14] Her agency is a friend

[00:16] Welcome to episode 324 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast mentioned in

[00:30] a lawsuit paper by Andrew Highway.

[00:32] So ladies and gentlemen, here's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[00:35] We'll do a little bit of the news.

[00:37] We'll do a little bit of your emails.

[00:40] And then I also want to focus on one thing.

[00:42] I want to do a little bit of a marketing analysis of what?

[00:46] What you would do if you were a new pinball company and you were trying to build a successful

[00:52] pinball company from the ground up in 2019 going into 2020.

[00:57] And I'm going to explain why I want to have this conversation with all of you out there

[01:01] because I think it's an interesting thing to think about and to discuss as we move towards

[01:06] the Texas pinball festival 2019.

[01:10] All right.

[01:11] Is that fair?

[01:12] Is that going to sound like a good episode?

[01:13] I think you'll enjoy it.

[01:14] So here's where we're going to start.

[01:16] There is new monsters code available as of yesterday.

[01:19] It is 0.96 of the monsters code update.

[01:23] And there is there's some decent amount of changes in the code.

[01:26] I'm not going to list out everything that is happening in the code update.

[01:31] But here's the main thing I've been reading people say.

[01:33] And as we get closer to 1.0, there is more and more of a feeling that the door is beginning

[01:41] to close on what this game could potentially be.

[01:47] That people are starting to admit that maybe, just maybe, this is what the game will be.

[01:54] And we've seen 96% of what the game's vision is.

[01:59] So will we see drastic changes as we get to 1.0, which is pretty much the finish line

[02:06] when it comes to stern games?

[02:07] Now yes, some of them continue to be polished.

[02:11] But we're looking at monsters becoming nearly finished probably sometime in 2019.

[02:17] And I think the takeaway I'm getting from people is this that this game is if you're

[02:22] a monster's fan, it's fun to shoot.

[02:24] But overall, the objective in the game is to get to jackpots and collect the jackpots,

[02:31] right?

[02:32] And to use the zap button to delay collecting the jackpots to build them up.

[02:37] Okay.

[02:38] And I think what people are starting to realize is they're not going to see in the monster's

[02:44] pinball game.

[02:46] They're not going to see the amount of clips and scenes from the show and storylines from

[02:53] the show.

[02:54] They are not going to see that stuff come to life the way they saw it come to life on Batman

[03:00] 66.

[03:01] And for fans of the show, and I've seen people write this, you know, they connect with

[03:05] a lot of iconic episodes of the monsters.

[03:09] And there's a lot of scenes from this show that they would love to see brought to life

[03:13] in the pinball machine.

[03:15] And I think it's starting to dawn on people that that is probably not going to happen

[03:20] ever.

[03:21] Okay.

[03:22] And there's a reason why it took Liman she's two years to get Batman 66 to the point where

[03:28] he considers it pretty much done.

[03:30] But I think Batman fans are walking away satisfied.

[03:34] Finally, after all those years, that the game itself brings to life a lot of the iconic

[03:40] scenes from the TV show.

[03:42] And I don't think people are going to get that in the monsters.

[03:45] And here's why I think that when Liman codes a game, he codes it to tell a story.

[03:51] He codes it in a way where you're going on a journey.

[03:54] And if you get through the journey and you get through the modes and you get through

[03:57] the storyline of the game, you will have a high score when you get to the end of that

[04:03] road.

[04:04] I think Dwight, he codes his games differently.

[04:07] I think Dwight makes his games all about a journey to a score, not a journey to a story.

[04:15] And I think there's a big difference in that.

[04:18] And I don't think people have the same sense of satisfaction when they play a Dwight

[04:24] game as they do a limingame.

[04:26] And I think some of that has to do with the fact that scoring and how to get to the score

[04:32] and the multiplier strategy and canceling the jackpots and just collecting the jackpot

[04:38] is ultimately I don't think as rewarding for people as it is in Batman where it's more

[04:45] about jailing the villains and the minor villains and understanding their modes and how their

[04:50] modes connect to each other.

[04:52] I think that is just a far more rewarding experience than if it was all about jackpot

[04:57] collection.

[04:58] I have to say in Batman, I don't even really know how to get to the super jackpots and

[05:05] what the super jackpot shots are all the time, but it doesn't matter.

[05:08] I end up hitting them because I'm playing through the game and progressing through the

[05:13] story and the modes in the game.

[05:15] So what does that mean for monsters owners?

[05:17] I don't know.

[05:18] I don't know what it means.

[05:19] A lot of you bought the game without fully understanding what the code would be and now

[05:24] you have probably what the game will end up being.

[05:28] So if you enjoy it now, I think you will enjoy monsters for a long time.

[05:33] If you were looking for a lot more from the monsters, I think you're going to be disappointed

[05:39] and will ultimately end up probably moving on to a different pin sometime soon.

[05:44] Alright, so that's what's happening in Sternland.

[05:47] There is still no Star Wars topper and this thing has become probably the laughing joke

[05:54] of the entire pinball accessory industry.

[05:59] They remember they put that they were waiting final approval on one of the stern of the

[06:03] Union addresses, but then it even fell off the last view.

[06:06] We haven't heard anything about where the Star Wars topper is.

[06:10] I don't know what to tell you.

[06:11] I really don't know what to tell you.

[06:13] It doesn't even look good.

[06:14] I can't believe it's been so long to get it.

[06:17] Now speaking of topper, someone found in the new monster's code that there is going to

[06:21] be a raven and a clock topper that is going to interact with the game, which is cool.

[06:29] I don't understand one thing though and correct me if I'm wrong.

[06:33] Stern knows when these games are going to release.

[06:35] Why don't they make the toppers available with the games on release?

[06:41] Why is there always a delay now between the topper and the game?

[06:46] That they get those two manufacturing processes lined up so that when you open your box on

[06:53] your Ellie and your premium, that the topper that goes with it, that goes with the game

[06:58] play, comes with the machine.

[07:01] I don't understand.

[07:02] I really don't understand.

[07:04] They used to be much better about shipping the game with the topper and look, it's not

[07:10] too hard to engineer a topper.

[07:12] I still wish they would just give you everything at once so you don't have to go back and buy

[07:17] more.

[07:18] Maybe that is the strategy over at Stern.

[07:21] What else is going on in Pimbal?

[07:22] Deeproot.

[07:23] So here's the thing.

[07:25] There is going to be no deeproot at TPS.

[07:27] This is not news to you, but I do have some deeproot news that many of you do not know

[07:32] about that I want to share right now.

[07:34] That is that we will not see any time in 2019 Magic Girl or Alice in Wonderland.

[07:42] I have confirmation about this from someone who is very high up the food chain at Deeproot.

[07:47] He goes by the name of Robert Mueller.

[07:50] And he said to me that they are planning something very, very special for both of those titles

[07:56] and they want to make sure they have the time to create the kind of magic they want in

[08:01] that game.

[08:02] Now I added some of that stuff at the end.

[08:03] He didn't say all of that, but he basically said we have really big plans for both titles

[08:07] and we're they're going to not come out this year.

[08:10] Okay, so he did not say that Raza would not come out this year.

[08:13] So I fully expect that Raza will be the game that will come out in 2019 from Deeproot.

[08:20] And that will most likely be the game that Robert probably offers up to the Zidware customers

[08:27] as part of the deal that we all know about.

[08:29] So I would expect to see Raza sometime by that date.

[08:33] I believe it was in June in which Deeproot needs to make an option available to Zidware

[08:39] customers.

[08:40] And it makes sense when you think about it that Raza would be that game because the

[08:44] majority of people who got burned by John Papaduke, they were in on Raza, not Magic Girl

[08:50] and not Alice in Wonderland.

[08:52] And also if you remember, nobody is really owed a Magic Girl.

[08:57] Everyone who bought a Magic Girl got a Magic Girl from American Pimball.

[09:01] So that sort of takes the need to satiate those owners.

[09:05] So I think Robert is probably doing the smart thing and making Raza the first game.

[09:10] And you know, Alice in Wonderland, which I think is the most beautiful Pimball machine ever.

[09:14] If you look at the artwork on that game, if he can make that game sing, I think we're

[09:18] all in for something special.

[09:20] Now, the other thing I heard about Deeproot is it seems that they're approaching Pimball

[09:25] differently.

[09:27] And I keep hearing sort of like a common sentiment over there.

[09:30] And it goes something like this.

[09:32] We just wanted to make games like Stern and Jersey Jack and spooky like we could do that

[09:36] immediately, but we don't want to do that.

[09:38] We want to give you something more than that.

[09:40] And we're also looking at how Pimball machines are manufactured and how they're made.

[09:44] And we're tackling it from the inside out, right?

[09:48] We're not just looking at it from the outside saying how can we just, you know, create parody

[09:53] with these other manufacturers.

[09:55] We're going over the entire process in which Pimball is made and applying innovation to it.

[10:01] And they're saying stuff like they can make a game a month if they wanted to, they could

[10:06] pump out games that fast.

[10:07] Now I know that sounds like very bold, disruptive talk.

[10:11] But here's the thing.

[10:12] If you do look at the Pimball industry and you look at the players in it, there really

[10:17] has not been much innovation in terms of the manufacturing process that takes place with

[10:23] these companies.

[10:24] You've got an assembly line that moves with people with soldering irons, soldering wires

[10:31] to switches in a game.

[10:32] I mean, it is very archaic.

[10:34] This is still the same way these games were made 30 years ago.

[10:39] And there hasn't been a lot of innovation in that sense.

[10:43] And so should a game be made that way and is deep root figuring out a whole new quad manufacturing

[10:51] process to get the games out?

[10:53] We'll see.

[10:54] We'll see.

[10:55] But, you know, 2019 begs to see something from them.

[10:59] And I can't wait to see what they deliver.

[11:02] And I'm glad that they've kept its secret and close to the vest.

[11:04] I think that is the way to do it.

[11:06] All right.

[11:07] What else is going on in Pimball?

[11:08] So, Magic Girl.

[11:10] I did the Magic Girl Proto story where I told you there was one for sale that was 0,

[11:15] 0, 0, 0.

[11:16] And I did end up getting an email that sort of clarified a little bit more about that

[11:21] machine.

[11:22] I want to, let me read it to you because I got two emails regarding this game.

[11:26] And I just think it's interesting to see what people are saying.

[11:29] Magic Girl 0, 0.

[11:30] All right.

[11:31] This isn't for being read word for word on the air.

[11:34] All right.

[11:35] I'm not going to read it word for word on the air.

[11:37] But apparently Magic Girl 0, 0, it came from Sunshine Laundromat.

[11:42] So Peter had the game over there.

[11:44] So here's the deal.

[11:45] Okay.

[11:46] That is where the, that is where Joe from Pin Graphics got the game from Peter at Sunshine.

[11:51] Now I'm not surprised to hear that Peter buys like almost every new game.

[11:55] And it is kind of incredible that he puts the rarest games out on location.

[11:58] Now I'm not surprised that Magic Girl never ended up out of box and on the floor at

[12:04] Sunshine.

[12:05] And here's why a few reasons.

[12:06] There's nothing in the code that would have allowed Peter to set the game at $1 or $2

[12:12] per play.

[12:13] The way the game was set up is it just registered one coin for one credit.

[12:18] So each quarter would be a credit.

[12:20] Okay.

[12:21] So that's a big problem.

[12:22] The secondarily, the game doesn't really work.

[12:24] So you've got that.

[12:25] Third, the game is prone to breaking down.

[12:29] And how do you explain to people who walk up to a Magic Girl at a place like Sunshine where

[12:34] they put their money in and then the game is just like a codeless mess?

[12:38] So I think it would just been a very unrewarding experience for all those involved.

[12:44] So that is where that game is coming from.

[12:46] All right.

[12:47] The other thing that I got an update on was when I announced about Tim Fife and the

[12:52] legal papers with Predator, I wasn't really sure what was happening.

[12:56] And so thankfully, Tim actually responded on my podcast post and he wrote the following.

[13:01] He said, in regards to the legal filing noted in the podcast, it was simply a formality

[13:08] filing.

[13:09] What happened was the judge in the bankruptcy case ruled in my favor and granted me

[13:14] sanctions against Keith, the lawyer representing the victims.

[13:19] With appeal, that decision to a higher court during the appeal process, the bankruptcy case

[13:25] was subsequently closed.

[13:27] The higher court denied Keith's appeal and again ruled in my favor.

[13:32] The bankruptcy case had to now be reopened for the judge to make a final ruling as to

[13:38] the dollar amount.

[13:40] Side note, two things came to light during Keith's appeal.

[13:44] One, what Keith had stated and based his original case against me on Perkevin's testimony

[13:50] was not accurate at all.

[13:52] And therefore, my lawyer is now arguing for full reimbursement of all my legal fees

[13:58] and at a non-discounted rate.

[14:01] Second, Keith actually appears to have violated my attorney client privilege.

[14:06] After giving my testimony at Keith's office with my lawyer, my lawyer accidentally left

[14:11] my case file at the office there.

[14:14] During one of Keith's later legal filings, he actually referenced a 5% legal fee discount

[14:20] in my agreement with my lawyer.

[14:23] If I pay fees immediately, I was entitled to a 5% discount.

[14:27] It appears Keith actually looked in my file that was left at his office and read my agreement

[14:32] with my lawyer, which was marked confidential.

[14:35] My lawyer is filing a new request to show cause to Keith and hopefully the court addresses

[14:41] this soon will see.

[14:44] Nothing like Pimbal ending up in a legal dramatic battle like that.

[14:49] Man, kind of curious, but maybe your lawyer shouldn't leave your shit behind at the other

[14:54] guy's office.

[14:55] Was that strategic?

[14:56] It sounds like it.

[14:57] I mean, I'd have a hard time not opening up any folder that said confidential on it.

[15:03] But let's move on.

[15:04] Everyone who had a predator is not going to get one.

[15:06] Let Tim be.

[15:08] He got rid of his game.

[15:09] His tail of the predator's saga is over.

[15:13] Let's see.

[15:14] What else is going on in the Pimbal world?

[15:15] Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[15:17] Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[15:18] This is the one that I've heard a lot about from people.

[15:22] I'm here to tell you that we are making a pact with you, the listener of the show.

[15:27] I am no longer going to dedicate so much time to Pirates of the Care being.

[15:33] We've exhausted it.

[15:34] I've let everyone who's in on that game, who likes that game.

[15:37] I've let them say their piece, but I'm done.

[15:40] I'm done.

[15:41] I think we agreed to disagree on how great this game is and that's okay.

[15:45] But I'm no longer going to dedicate so much air time to this game.

[15:49] I think I've been fair enough on it.

[15:52] Now, when it comes to TPS, I still read in the Willy Wonka thread.

[15:55] People hoping to see Willy Wonka there.

[15:57] It's not happening.

[15:58] You're not getting it at TPS.

[16:00] You will get yellow brick road and that's that.

[16:02] You can move on from that.

[16:03] Okay.

[16:04] So, American Pimbal.

[16:06] They're the focus of this podcast.

[16:08] I want to talk about American Pimbal and I want to look at them a little bit differently.

[16:13] I want to look at them through the lens of a marketing strategy.

[16:18] The reason why I say this and the reason why I think this will be a fun discussion is

[16:22] if you, the listener, if you, the listener was going to start a Pimbal company in 2018,

[16:29] 2019.

[16:30] If you told you you have the financial money to do it, you have the, you know, the manufacturing

[16:35] capabilities to do it, you have enough resources at your disposal to enter the Pimbal market.

[16:42] I want you all to sort of forget all the Pimbal companies you know.

[16:46] Imagine if you were at the helm of American Pimbal from day one.

[16:51] This is before J-Pop gets signed up.

[16:53] This is before anything happens that we know about.

[16:55] I want all of us to imagine ourselves in that role.

[16:59] And you are at the helm of a new Pimbal company.

[17:02] Okay.

[17:03] And the reason why I want us all to do this is I want to talk about the creating success

[17:10] in this industry and what it takes and what work you have to do and what questions you

[17:15] have to ask yourself about how to become a successful Pimbal company.

[17:20] And we know that there are some companies that have been successful.

[17:24] The majority of them though have failed, have failed to be successful, have failed to

[17:29] turn a profit.

[17:30] Okay.

[17:31] And so if I told you you're starting a company, you're going to have to do some homework

[17:36] and you're going to have to do some research and you're going to have to ask some questions

[17:40] about how you don't fall victim and fall into the same traps that everyone else who came

[17:47] before you fell into.

[17:49] And I don't think it's tremendously hard.

[17:51] I have to be honest.

[17:52] I don't think it's tremendously hard to do one thing to do the market research required

[17:59] to put your company on a path to success because doing that research, luckily for a lot

[18:05] of people out there who are getting into Pimbal, the information and the data and the analysis

[18:11] needed to understand what people want.

[18:13] A lot of that is free and the access to it is free and access to the community and focus

[18:20] groups are free to understand what it takes to make a successful Pimbal company.

[18:25] So if we're to fast forward to today and where American Pimbal is at, they've released

[18:30] to Dini to mediocre sales, wasn't a sales juggernaut.

[18:34] They have October Fest, which they revealed at Expo of 2018.

[18:40] TPF is going to be this company's moment.

[18:43] They must know it.

[18:44] This game lives or dies by its reception at TPF.

[18:48] If people enjoy it and say it's fun, its ability to live on will continue.

[18:54] Okay.

[18:55] And so there's nothing else to say about that, right?

[18:58] But I'm here to say that I think that all of these companies, these new companies like

[19:03] American Pimbal, when I look at them, I can't help but look at them and say, well, how

[19:08] did it come to this?

[19:10] How did your company make so many decisions that led you to a point where you're not selling

[19:17] games immediately after you reveal them, that you don't have the kind of demand and people

[19:23] banging down your door to get your product all the time?

[19:28] And Pimbal, as we know, is a product and is a toy.

[19:32] If you do it right and you give people what they are craving, the frenzy to get the

[19:39] games is tremendous.

[19:41] And we see it all the time in this hobby.

[19:43] And so that is why I want to do this little bit of a marketing analysis of a company like

[19:47] this because if you're going to start a Pimbal company, I think the number one goal needs

[19:53] to be how do we create a game where the demand far exceeds our ability to even make them.

[20:03] And how do we create a product that becomes sought after and holds value nicely?

[20:08] So here's the thing.

[20:09] So here's how we would normally approach it.

[20:11] And I want to tell you where a lot of these questions came from and this approach came

[20:14] from.

[20:15] So I just spent the last couple of weeks with people from Can Lion.

[20:20] And if you don't know what Can Lion is, it is the award show in Can France.

[20:25] And the Lions are the celebration of the best marketing work in the world.

[20:30] And they aggregate campaigns from all over the world on a global level.

[20:34] And they pick the campaigns that are most successful in creating a marketing program in which

[20:41] there is a great insight in which the creative is phenomenal in which a company's business

[20:47] results were driven by the great marketing that was put out in the world.

[20:52] And I have to be honest, a lot of it can sometimes just look like art.

[20:56] A lot of it can be like hoidy toy, like marketing, like sipping rosé in France.

[21:01] But I'll say this.

[21:02] In my years working in marketing, I was really impressed by the people over there who came

[21:06] over, these two amazing women.

[21:08] And they talked to us about if you're trying to become a successful business and you need

[21:15] to turn on the right kind of marketing to gain market share, there is a way to approach

[21:20] it.

[21:21] And so one of the things that they talked about was what are the barriers in which your

[21:26] company will encounter as it enters the marketplace.

[21:30] As a new pinball manufacturer, right?

[21:33] So if all of you will get back into that mindset, what are the barriers that you need to overcome

[21:39] if you want to be successful in the pinball market?

[21:41] Right?

[21:42] Now, I took a stab at what I think some of the barriers would be.

[21:44] Again, this would be me if I was in AP's office on day one.

[21:49] So barrier number one is there is market saturation that there's a lot of products out there.

[21:55] So there might be more supply than demand right now for pinball machines.

[22:00] So that might be a barrier.

[22:01] I need to know that there is enough of a demand and enough new buyers available to my company

[22:10] for me to enter the marketplace.

[22:12] The other thing that I would look at in terms of a barrier is that I would know that people

[22:18] want themed pinball machines.

[22:21] That themes are the things that people crave.

[22:23] If I looked at what the greatest selling games were recently, they were all themed titles.

[22:28] And so a barrier to entry for a new company like American pinball would be the high cost

[22:34] for themes that people want.

[22:36] So I would know that it's expensive to lock in a theme that has a high demand.

[22:43] The other barrier is that they're probably getting access to those themes would be a barrier

[22:48] for me because a lot of the themes are locked up by stern pinball.

[22:53] So that is another barrier to overcome.

[22:56] And then we have a barrier is this that people are demanding innovation from pinball machine

[23:03] but they don't want to pay a ton for it.

[23:06] So there is a if you're a new company, you know, you need to differentiate and make your

[23:11] game better than what's available but at what cost?

[23:15] Like what will be the price point in which people won't pay for my innovation?

[23:20] And finally, and I think this might be one of the biggest barriers to the entire industry

[23:24] is there is only a finite amount of talent that is available out there on day one of your

[23:31] company that knows how to make a pinball game.

[23:35] And so how do you do it?

[23:36] How do you know you're hiring the best designer?

[23:38] How do you know you have a great coder?

[23:40] How do you know you have a great artist?

[23:42] And if we look at American pinball, I think you know they went with Joe and Josh and you

[23:49] know that's who they put on the court.

[23:53] And so if I were starting a pinball company, I think it would be difficult.

[23:57] It would be difficult to understand, well, who's going to design my game?

[24:01] And how do I know who to hire?

[24:03] And that seems to be a common theme in this industry where nobody's going to get like new young

[24:08] designers like who's designing the pinball tables over at Zen Pinball?

[24:12] It seems to be the same older designers from yesterday years that everyone taps into.

[24:17] Okay, so those are the barriers.

[24:19] So you have to overcome those barriers, right?

[24:22] The next question I would ask is what do we know about the pinball market?

[24:25] All right, I'm sitting in American pinball's office.

[24:29] What do I know about the market?

[24:30] So I do know this that collectors will pay more for rarity, right?

[24:36] And the early model, the perception of the early model within pinball has proven to be

[24:41] very successful in pinball.

[24:43] If I just stepped back and said, look, you know, Stern is selling out of these LEDs when

[24:47] they get the theme right.

[24:48] Spooky pinball survived when they limited the number of games they were making.

[24:53] So the limited number is a really important driver of demand because it creates a sense

[25:00] of scarcity and fear of missing out.

[25:02] So that is something, if I was a new pinball company, that I would embrace and try to figure

[25:08] out.

[25:09] So I think if you look at American pinball and you look at their approach to pinball,

[25:14] they have acted in a way that is somewhat ignorant of this concept that we're just going

[25:21] to make one game.

[25:23] We're going to make it in an unlimited amount.

[25:26] And what that creates is absolutely no desire to have to own the game now.

[25:31] There's absolutely no rush to buy the game.

[25:34] And as you're going to see in some of the other insights I have within this market, creating

[25:38] that kind of scenario is a huge mistake.

[25:41] So the other thing that I think we could say is that the three tiered model has proven

[25:46] to be most successful.

[25:47] But if you don't want to make three versions of the game, limiting your game is the other

[25:52] way to go.

[25:53] We've never seen much success in an unlimited amounts of game.

[25:57] Like that's just, that's just hasn't worked for anyone in the new world of pinball manufacturing.

[26:03] Okay.

[26:04] So here's the other thing.

[26:06] The other thing I would say is that theme is more important than innovation.

[26:10] And this is something that is absolutely true.

[26:14] You might not want it to be true, but it is true.

[26:17] And we have to look no further than a game like dialed in.

[26:20] I think dialed in represents 100% the realities of how pinball buyers will behave when the

[26:29] innovation is there, but the theme is lacking.

[26:33] And we saw that dialed in never really captured the imagination of the pinball buying public.

[26:39] It had everything that people had been asking for or so called Jack thought they were asking

[26:46] for, right?

[26:47] We kept hearing people wanted original titles.

[26:49] We kept hearing people wanted a new pat law or game.

[26:53] People wanted innovation.

[26:54] People wanted toys, play field mechanisms, all this magic magnets, you know, holograms,

[26:59] everything drones.

[27:01] Jack put everything that he thought people wanted into the game, but he learned the ultimate

[27:07] hard lesson in life is even though people, you know, and these are mostly the diehard pinball

[27:12] collectors, even though they say they want an original IP, the majority of pinball buyers

[27:18] and new pinball buyers, especially.

[27:21] So whether you're in old hardcore pinball enthusiasts or new to the market, theme is the

[27:27] most important thing and getting the theme right is crucial, right?

[27:33] Is absolutely crucial.

[27:34] All right.

[27:36] So what else do we know as crucial as well when it comes to the pinball market?

[27:39] So here's another thing that is an observation everyone should be aware of by now.

[27:44] And that is the reveal to ship date is critical when it comes to pinball sales.

[27:49] If you botch your launch and your reveal, we time and time again, it is shown that that

[27:56] will be devastating to sales.

[27:58] The next thing is we know that people will buy before playing, which makes the aesthetics

[28:03] and the visual appeal of a pinball machine greater than ever before.

[28:08] So you need to make sure that your game is just sexy, even before people flip it, all

[28:13] right?

[28:14] We also know that a game relevance, it fades within a year, all right?

[28:19] You need to capture as many sales as you can within that first six months to a year

[28:24] after that there will be a lot of new titles out and interest in older titles does fade

[28:29] significantly.

[28:30] So you really need to get as many people through the door immediately as you can, all right?

[28:37] And the last point I'll say about the pinball market that every company, especially new

[28:40] companies need to be aware of, if your game loses value on the second hand market quickly,

[28:47] future sales will suffer significantly.

[28:51] And that by that I mean, if your game is new and before people are even in on one, they're

[28:57] seeing people sell it used for much less than the new price, that really is going to damage

[29:04] people going in on your game because they're going to be hesitant that the game is not great,

[29:09] that the game loses value quickly.

[29:11] And this entire market has been spoiled a little bit by losing very little money over a lot

[29:17] of years, but that's going to change with a lot more games in the marketplace as more

[29:21] and more people need to free up room.

[29:23] All right.

[29:24] So then, you know, something that every company has to do is this, what is the job to be

[29:29] one?

[29:30] And I was doing this for major brands like Stellar, Twa and for Spike Seltzer, Bonenville,

[29:36] Spike Seltzer.

[29:37] We did it for Budweiser, we did it for Bud Light.

[29:40] So the job to be one and there could be many jobs to be one.

[29:43] So for example, let me give a company like Oreo Cookies.

[29:47] Oreo Cookies might have a job to be one, which is to get people who used to love Oreo

[29:52] Cookies, but no longer eat them to try them again.

[29:55] So that could be a job to be one.

[29:57] We might have a brand where most people who buy the beverage are women, so a job to be

[30:02] one might be, let's get men, more men to buy Spike Seltzer.

[30:08] So that could be a job to be one, all right.

[30:10] So in the pinball market, what is the job to be one?

[30:13] And you might only have one.

[30:15] And I think if I were a brand new pinball company, I would have one job to be one.

[30:20] It would not be to expand pinball and try to get new people into the hobby that are not

[30:25] into pinball.

[30:26] The job to be one, I think, for all these companies is very simple.

[30:29] And that is we need to steal consumers away from Stern.

[30:34] That is the job to be one.

[30:36] We need to make a better game than Stern pinball.

[30:39] And so if we look at which companies have successfully achieved that goal, it hasn't been

[30:46] many.

[30:47] It hasn't been many.

[30:48] I don't really think Stern has suffered much over the last seven years as all these new

[30:52] boutique companies have come into the market.

[30:54] They just haven't.

[30:56] And the reason why is while some companies have beat Stern in certain areas, nobody, and

[31:02] I mean nobody has given people all of what they want it and nailed it on every cylinder.

[31:10] They just haven't.

[31:12] Jersey Jack games might be deeper, but I would argue that Stern's artwork is much nicer.

[31:18] Jersey Jack might have a bigger display, but that doesn't mean it's a better display.

[31:22] And I think there's a lot of confusion on the Jersey Jack display that they're still

[31:25] trying to figure out.

[31:27] Some games might be cheaper, but they also break down less than Jersey Jack games.

[31:33] You know what I'm saying?

[31:34] So there's been, you know, you win here, but you lose there.

[31:37] And ultimately nobody has made a game that has made everyone universally say, yep, that's

[31:43] just better and more fun and sexier and more reliable and just where pinball needs to be.

[31:49] And that is leagues above everything that Stern is putting into game.

[31:53] So how do you do that?

[31:56] How do you steal market share away from Stern?

[31:58] So this is the first thing and this is where I think a lot of these boutique companies

[32:02] are falling down.

[32:04] The first thing on my list of how do we accomplish our job to be done is we need a theme that

[32:10] people want.

[32:12] Theme is everything.

[32:14] We need to give people a game that they would want to buy without even seeing it because

[32:19] the theme is so exciting to them.

[32:22] All right.

[32:23] So we lock in a big theme.

[32:25] I would not even get started on making my pinball game.

[32:28] I think it's absolutely silly that these companies and this is where again, my assessment

[32:34] of a company like American pinball, what is the point of making Houdini and October

[32:41] fest and spending all the money on those two themes and all the hours and all the development

[32:47] costs and all the material creation costs and all the talent that you're hiring and

[32:52] manufacturing that you're creating.

[32:55] All of that is being applied to manufacture two themes that people don't really want.

[33:01] If they had taken all that money all that time and applied a little bit more market research

[33:06] to it, they would have been much better off biting the bullet and acquiring a theme

[33:13] that people really want it and make a game based on that theme even if it costs them

[33:19] more just to create a product that would land with a real impact because your first game

[33:27] out of the gate, it needs to be amazing.

[33:30] This whole notion of like you'll incrementally just keep getting better, not the case that

[33:36] is not worked in any other industry.

[33:38] You can't be a disruptor.

[33:40] You can't change market share.

[33:42] You can't steal customers away if what you deliver is in superior than what's already

[33:50] available and available with more frequency and more cadence than what you want to deliver.

[33:59] I just think that to me is where a lot of these companies are falling down is if dovel and

[34:06] normal, if they have money and they have millions of dollars to pump into a pinball venture

[34:12] which they clearly have.

[34:14] We know they come from a, their dad is very successful.

[34:19] It's Google, you can search it.

[34:20] I think they made like 20 plus million dollars in revenue last year, maybe even more.

[34:25] So clearly whoever's funding this company, it's internally funded.

[34:29] They have a lot of money but they made a lot of decisions that completely were ignorant

[34:35] to market research.

[34:38] What you don't want is where they're at now.

[34:40] You don't want to end up where people have to get over the theme to enjoy the game.

[34:47] You never want to be there.

[34:49] It's the same problem as really plaguing pirates of the Caribbean.

[34:52] When people don't love the theme and then you have to fall in love with the pinball,

[34:57] despite the theme, that is a recipe for sales disaster.

[35:03] The other thing is this, as a new company, you need to hire the talent, capable of making

[35:10] a game that looks and plays and shoots and sounds as good as if not better than Stern.

[35:18] So if Stern's artist in their arsenal right now are Zambi Yeti and Christopher Franchi,

[35:26] you need an artist that is as good as them or better.

[35:30] You can't create a game that doesn't look as good as Stern's game.

[35:36] I think it's hard to stand over Octoberfest and stand over Houdini and say that that

[35:43] art package is superior.

[35:45] I know that American Pimbo was talking to Brian Allen who did the awesome hand drawn alien

[35:50] artwork and they never went forward with him.

[35:54] So right off the bat, my game, your game, if we, again, if we're creating a company,

[36:00] I would go get an artist that was as good as if not better than what Stern has in their

[36:07] arsenal.

[36:08] I think the inability to make these games sexier is so sad to me because there are so

[36:14] many talented artists out there that are easily available.

[36:18] I mean, every single tattoo artist out there in like major cities is just as good as these

[36:23] guys and all the comic book artists that are available that you could freelance.

[36:28] They go on Deviant Art and like look at all the all the incredible artists that are out

[36:32] there and artists are not that expensive.

[36:37] We've sort of glorified the few artists in this industry as being like all you can do.

[36:43] Like all you can go after is Yeti and Franchi.

[36:46] I'm sorry, but there are so many talented artists and no one is hiring them.

[36:52] And when I look at Octoberfest, I just don't see a caliber of art that is that great,

[36:57] right?

[36:58] Okay.

[36:59] And also then you're looking at your talent in terms of designers and coders and again,

[37:06] we keep hearing people making excuses for what's on the screen and the animations on the

[37:11] screen.

[37:12] And I do agree with Ben Heck.

[37:13] If you can't make the animations better or interesting, then maybe don't do animations.

[37:20] Maybe just think about how you could put other stuff on that screen that would work well.

[37:24] Okay.

[37:25] And then ultimately you need to create demand for your product and scarcity and limited

[37:31] addition nature has proven to work.

[37:34] Avoiding that does show the absolute ignorance to the market.

[37:37] So I want a game.

[37:39] I want to make 500 of a game and I want there to be 1000 people that want it.

[37:44] Or I want to make 1000 versions of a game and I want 2000 people to want it.

[37:50] I need to know what it takes to get there.

[37:53] And if you look at Houdini and October Fest, first of all, there's no awareness of how

[38:00] many they're going to make.

[38:02] So I don't need to buy one today.

[38:03] I can just wait.

[38:04] And that's a big problem for them.

[38:06] And also I don't think they did any market research on any of those themes to know what

[38:12] the real demand was.

[38:14] And so this is where we're at.

[38:16] And I just wanted to go over this because I don't want these companies to fail.

[38:22] I don't want these companies to end up in these scenarios where their games been revealed

[38:28] and it's and sales are not picking up that they have to go around the shows and spend

[38:34] a lot of money and tore the game around the country and try to slowly build demand for

[38:40] a title.

[38:41] If you end up there in 2019 where you need to slowly build demand, you failed already.

[38:49] If people have to stand over your machine and flip it before putting an order in, you've

[38:53] failed already.

[38:55] And the reason why I say that is Stern Pimbal is able to sell the games site unseen.

[39:01] They're able to sell the games with just a twitch stream.

[39:04] They understand that enough of Pimbal can create sales if you just get enough of that

[39:11] correct.

[39:13] And Houdini and October Fest, they're the opposite of Stern's approach.

[39:19] You know, again, imagine if Stern revealed, let's say, one of their hot titles and then

[39:26] they say, you know, you can order yours tomorrow.

[39:27] Why do they sell 501 day?

[39:30] Why?

[39:32] And then October Fest is revealed and how many do you think they sold in that one day?

[39:37] 500, 50?

[39:39] Probably five, right?

[39:41] And that's just the problem with these new companies is I think they don't do the market

[39:47] research.

[39:48] And again, it's not me wanting them to fail.

[39:50] I just think they need to start doing more of that research and they need to spend all

[39:55] of their money, all of their money on two things.

[39:58] They need to spend all their money on getting a theme people really want and they need to

[40:03] spend all of their money on an art package that people will go bonkers for because I fully

[40:10] believe they'll figure the rest of it out.

[40:12] You know, I think American Pimbal, they've got great mechanisms.

[40:16] They've got all this great engineering.

[40:20] They've got that part down in spades.

[40:22] There's a lot more going on in those games than a Stern game, but where are they falling

[40:26] down and why aren't the sales there?

[40:29] And that is why.

[40:31] That is why.

[40:32] So we'll see what's going to happen.

[40:33] You know, what's interesting is with a brand like Deeproot, you know, how many themes are

[40:37] they going to have that have that kind of pull?

[40:40] I think if they think a lot of original games are going to fly off the shelves, I think

[40:44] they're wrong.

[40:45] I don't think people want the originality as much as they want a theme they love so much.

[40:50] I'm going to have a new episode up this week where me and someone talk all about themes

[40:55] and what themes we think would make awesome Pimbal machines.

[40:57] And I think you'll realize when you go down a list of themes of popular movies and TV

[41:02] shows, there are so many amazing themes that have never had a Pimbal game.

[41:09] And if they did have a Pimbal machine, I think the sales and the customers would line

[41:14] up.

[41:15] Would fight each other to get Ellie versions of some of these themes.

[41:19] And that is why if you release these original theme games, they're just going to fail.

[41:25] They're going to be dead on arrival like the Vahala game by Riot.

[41:29] Like, who are you making these games for?

[41:32] There is absolutely zero research that shows this is what people want.

[41:36] And I would extend that to Spooky Pimbal.

[41:40] The themes they choose have absolutely nothing to do with market research.

[41:44] It is all just what Chuck and Bug want to make.

[41:48] And that is a recipe for long term failure.

[41:51] And he might be like, we sold everyone.

[41:52] The people really want these games already trying to get out of them without even getting

[41:56] them yet.

[41:57] And the only reason he did Alice Cooper is because Rob Zombie introduced him to Alice Cooper.

[42:02] It's not like Chuck is going out there and spending money on the right themes.

[42:07] He is getting like these sweetheart deals on these themes.

[42:10] But now he's at the point where he's going to have to eventually give people a theme.

[42:17] That's a jug or not if he wants to keep the company going.

[42:20] These companies are not going to stick around forever with these half-ass themes and these

[42:25] half-ass designs and these half-ass approaches.

[42:28] It's just not going to happen.

[42:30] They will all fail to steal customers away from Stern if they don't give you the themes

[42:35] you want.

[42:36] All right.

[42:37] Let me read some emails and I got to go to work.

[42:39] All right.

[42:40] All right.

[42:41] I got an email from James Foggan.

[42:43] He said, uh, canada, get a grip.

[42:46] Willie Wonka and Toy Story versus Guns and Roses.

[42:50] Mate, there is no competition on theme.

[42:52] A new G&R machine will blow the doors off either of the other two.

[42:56] What fully grown man is going to walk up to Willie Wonka or Toy Story in a bar and tell

[43:01] his friends?

[43:02] I mean, come on.

[43:03] This Toy theme, hype is delusional.

[43:05] Would it make a great game?

[43:06] No.

[43:07] It's for kids.

[43:08] I think I'm going to buy $10,000 pound games.

[43:10] G&R will be the first smash hit for JJ Peep.

[43:13] James, well, James, here's the thing.

[43:15] I think you're wrong.

[43:16] I think you're wrong.

[43:17] I think a lot of grown men love Willie Wonka.

[43:20] I think a lot of grown men love Toy Story and I think a lot of people who have pinball

[43:24] in their homes also have wives and have kids and they want a game that is family friendly

[43:31] too but also classic.

[43:33] And I think you have to look no further than Wizard of Oz selling four to five thousand

[43:38] units for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[43:39] Why did it sell that many?

[43:42] That's more than Iron Maiden will probably sell.

[43:44] That's more than, you know, that's on par with like Metallica and probably ACDC.

[43:50] And so look, I do think Guns and Roses will be successful but I am here to tell you right

[43:54] now.

[43:55] There is no way Guns and Roses in 2019 will out sell a Willie Wonka Pimball machine.

[44:01] It's not just because there's been a Guns and Roses Pimball machine before but I just

[44:05] don't see it being as successful.

[44:08] They might be equally successful but I don't think Guns and Roses will blow either one

[44:12] of them away.

[44:13] Here's the thing.

[44:14] I think they're all going to be very successful and that's a good argument to have.

[44:17] I mean, how often have we said the next three Jersey Jack games are going to be home runs.

[44:22] Often times we're making excuses for them.

[44:24] I mean, he's had pretty much disappointments in a row.

[44:28] Hobbit dialed in and Pirates of the Caribbean were sales flops for Jersey Jack.

[44:33] I think all three of these are going to be sales juggernauts for him and I hope he

[44:37] gets there.

[44:38] I hope nothing stands in the way of him achieving that success.

[44:42] Let's see.

[44:43] I want to think I have a couple more patrons or Patreon Donators to the show.

[44:47] Thank you guys so much.

[44:48] I want to say thank you to Woody and thank you to Clint Warren for dedicating your resources

[44:55] to Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[44:57] Again, I thank all of you guys who become Patreon Donators of the show.

[45:00] I thank you for the support and let's go on.

[45:03] So let's see.

[45:04] I got an email from do do do do do do do do do do do.

[45:08] All right, Michael.

[45:09] He said Pirates of the Caribbean talk is killing us.

[45:12] Canada, I'm a big fan of the show, but I have to be honest.

[45:15] All of this Pirates of the Caribbean talk on almost every show has been beat into death.

[45:19] Please bring us some different content.

[45:21] One other note.

[45:22] I'm in lockstep with you about Pimball not being very magical these days.

[45:26] Creativity is nowhere to be found.

[45:28] We need innovation in these new games.

[45:30] We creative use magnets ramps use something in a different way.

[45:34] That's why system 11 games still stay in many collections because many of them aren't

[45:38] creative, not just basic fan layout.

[45:41] Keep up the great work Mike P.

[45:43] Well Mike, look, I agree with you.

[45:45] People want the magic.

[45:47] People want the innovation and they know that that magic is not coming from Stern.

[45:52] It's not.

[45:53] Magic?

[45:54] They make it.

[45:55] Stern makes really good games.

[45:58] They make really good games.

[46:00] Every once in a while we'll get a game from Stern where the code is great.

[46:04] The code is great.

[46:05] But in terms of play field magic and Stern Pimball, where is it?

[46:12] Where is it?

[46:13] Magic.

[46:14] Oh my God.

[46:15] Did you see that?

[46:16] Did you see what the ball just did?

[46:17] Oh my God.

[46:18] No, it's nowhere.

[46:19] They don't need to make magic.

[46:20] You don't need to conjure up magic when you can fool everybody with tricks.

[46:25] You see them saying real magic goes beyond just being like hoodwinking people.

[46:34] And I think Stern has done a great job in giving you just enough to get your money out of

[46:39] your wallet.

[46:40] But you clearly out there, you Pimball buyers, you don't need magic.

[46:44] You just want to have fun.

[46:45] Stern games are fun.

[46:48] You will have fun playing Pimball and you will have a lot of fun playing Stern Pimball

[46:51] games.

[46:52] And I realize that this is enough fun to satisfy our buyers.

[46:56] But magic?

[46:57] The magical.

[46:58] Again, tell me the magical mechanism that we've seen from Stern gameplay recently.

[47:03] And email me at kineativepimballatgmail.com if you can find it.

[47:06] Right?

[47:07] All right.

[47:08] What else is going on?

[47:09] Doo, doo, doo, do magic girl.

[47:13] Pyrids commons.

[47:14] Not reading Pyrids commons.

[47:17] Brian Mallard says, hey, Chris saw you were traveling here for business.

[47:21] This is mini-miniapolis.

[47:22] If you're coming back and looking for a place to play some pins and have a few drinks,

[47:27] let me know.

[47:28] I have a JJP pirates, but I have no clue how the fuck to play it so I can't talk you into

[47:33] liking it.

[47:34] Got a decent sized game room besides that.

[47:37] Pin ghetto on pin side if you wanted to see the collection and the fridge is always stocked.

[47:43] Anyway, I just thought I'd extend my invite if you were passing through again.

[47:46] We have quite the pinball community here.

[47:48] Alright, well thank you so much, Brian.

[47:50] I will definitely take you up.

[47:52] He also says take care and good luck on the Twippy.

[47:54] Well thank you, Brian.

[47:55] If I go through mini-apples again, I will definitely reach out.

[47:58] I'm trying to think if anything else is going on.

[48:00] Alright, I got another email here about the greatest of all time.

[48:04] I'm not going to read more emails about which pins are the greatest of all time.

[48:08] We all know that no pinball machine is the greatest of all time.

[48:11] The only thing within the entire pinball hobby or community that can honestly and objectively

[48:19] say they're the greatest of all time and that is one thing.

[48:22] Canate is pinball podcast is the greatest pinball podcast of all time.

[48:25] Peace out people.
