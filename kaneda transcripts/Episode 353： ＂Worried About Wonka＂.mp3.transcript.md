[00:00] I wasn't planning to do a show today.

[00:02] I had interviewed Jerry from P3 and that is still going to go up shortly.

[00:07] But something happened in the world of Pimball last night and I don't know.

[00:10] I slept on it and I thought to myself, you know what?

[00:14] Let me just air for you what's going on inside my head right now around a particular game.

[00:22] And the reason why I want to do this show a little bit differently and not start off

[00:25] with, you know, my intro music and I will get to my theme song in a little bit.

[00:29] But I wanted to just have a little bit of a conversation with you about a game that

[00:34] I've been really excited about and I am still really excited about it.

[00:38] But again, just because of what happened last night, I feel compelled as someone who has

[00:44] a check out there and a deposit down for a $12,500 version of this game.

[00:51] I think it's only right that we're allowed to ask questions and wonder what will be in

[00:57] the final product of the game that we're waiting for if you haven't guessed it by now

[01:02] that game is Willy Wonka.

[01:04] Now here's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[01:07] I want to talk about where this game is going, not from a design standpoint in terms of

[01:13] layout, not in terms of mechanisms, not in terms of artwork.

[01:17] I think we know where those things are with the game and we're very satisfied with those

[01:22] things in the game.

[01:23] The sound in the game has people somewhat polarized but we'll see where that lands.

[01:29] For me what I want to talk about on this episode is quite frankly the way the game will be

[01:35] coded and how the code of the game will bring to life the Willy Wonka movie that we all love,

[01:42] the iconic film of Willy Wonka.

[01:45] And so here's what I want to talk about.

[01:47] The question I have, the question that is on my mind, the question that I've asked of

[01:53] people who are working on the game and I just can't seem to get a straight answer on

[01:58] this and that's why I want to do this podcast because I think all of us should just ask

[02:03] this very basic question is how will the iconic scenes from Willy Wonka that we all love,

[02:11] that we all have grown up with that have been around since 1971, how will those iconic

[02:18] scenes, how will they translate into this pinball game?

[02:23] And you know me, you've listened to this podcast.

[02:26] I love when a pinball machine tells a story.

[02:32] Okay, and so this is one of the most iconic stories of all time.

[02:37] Now the thing about Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory, when you think about the narrative

[02:40] of the film and of the book, it does have a very linear narrative progression and we all

[02:49] grew up loving that progression.

[02:51] There's probably no better story that starts at this incredible beginning of the search

[02:57] for the golden tickets.

[02:59] All right, there are five golden tickets out there and the beginning of the movie sets

[03:04] the tension so perfectly, right?

[03:07] You have to find one and people all over the world are hunting for the tickets and then

[03:12] you have the five children who locate the tickets, Charlie being the final one, but memorable

[03:17] moment, they meet at the gates of the Wonka factory and then the movie just takes you in

[03:23] all these amazing different directions.

[03:26] Each room, each room holds a new mystery, a new adventure, a new terrifying interaction

[03:34] with the chocolate factory for the children.

[03:37] And we all remember that.

[03:39] And pinball, if you think about pinball outside of this movie, pinball is a game in which

[03:45] we are used to modes and modes representing objectives in the game.

[03:51] And that is how pinball has been for so many years and decades.

[03:55] And so if I zoom out and I think about, we have this incredible movie in which there are

[04:01] all these iconic scenes that we remember, we remember the dialogue, we remember the

[04:06] speeches, we remember the bratty kids and all the things they said in each scene.

[04:11] We remember like what happens to them and how it progresses in each scene.

[04:16] And then you think about pinball, how can you not say, well, wait a minute, this would

[04:21] make the most amazing pinball game because you could have each of those iconic scenes transferred

[04:29] over into the pinball game.

[04:31] Okay.

[04:32] Now we're going to talk about that on episode 353 of Canadian pinball podcasts is Willy

[04:39] Wanka, the iconic movie, being transferred over into the pinball game in the way it should

[04:45] be.

[04:46] Let's hit the theme music right now.

[04:48] All right.

[04:55] So welcome back to the show.

[04:56] So here's what happened to me last night that is the reason why I'm doing this show.

[05:02] There was a new stream of Willy Wanka pinball and it was being streamed by, is it IE pinball

[05:09] or flipper bat pinball, I think it's IE pinball and like on tilt pinball.com, they were streaming

[05:16] Willy Wanka on Twitch last night and I heard that there was some new code updates.

[05:21] So I went in and I watched the game, right?

[05:23] They were streaming it, Jersey Jack gave them a game, they're streaming the machine, even

[05:28] though I have told Jack time and time again, stop streaming the games until the games are

[05:34] done so that you're not getting people fatigued by looking at it time and time again.

[05:39] But here we go, old habits die hard, another stream of Willy Wanka.

[05:44] Okay.

[05:45] Now look, at what point do I have permission to sort of ask questions about this game, right?

[05:51] They've asked me for a deposit down on a $12,500 game.

[05:56] So I'm in the stream.

[05:57] I'm watching the stream and I'm not seeing a tremendous amount of new stuff.

[06:02] There's some new call outs.

[06:03] I think there's like an oompa lumpa sound effects that happen when you hit the pop bumpers.

[06:08] I heard there was like a jack pot call out that comes from the movie, but I'm looking

[06:12] at the screen.

[06:13] I keep staring at the screen and I'm not seeing the one thing that I expected to see

[06:19] more of or some of because I haven't seen hardly any of it.

[06:23] If any, I don't see any of the movie clips from the iconic scenes from the movie with voice

[06:31] actors talking.

[06:33] You sometimes you see it in the background, but there's no dialogue and I'm still not

[06:38] seeing any of that.

[06:40] And so what I started to do was I started to ask questions in the chat saying, hmm, I'm

[06:46] getting a little worried.

[06:47] I don't see any of the scenes from the movie with call outs.

[06:51] And is that going to happen or is it just going to be like this where the goals of the

[06:54] game are to collect wonka bars and then do this and do that, but it doesn't seem like

[06:59] the goals of the game are going to be completing modes that are inspired by the iconic scenes

[07:06] in the movie.

[07:08] Now I always say this on this podcast.

[07:10] I always say that marketing is really important.

[07:14] I always say that marketing isn't just about how you sell a game.

[07:20] Marketing is how you're going to make the game, right?

[07:22] All that's a marketing decision.

[07:24] So when they sat in a room at JJP and they said, we're going to make Willy Wonka pinball.

[07:30] All right.

[07:32] Did they not just come to the simple conclusion that this movie is perfect for pinball and

[07:38] here's how it should be.

[07:39] We should have modes that are based on every single iconic scene in the game.

[07:43] And I'm going to get back to that later, something that came from the code or himself, but

[07:48] here's a crazy part.

[07:50] Here's what everybody wants.

[07:52] Here's what all of you out there want from a Willy Wonka pinball machine.

[07:56] You want to have a mode in which the goal of that mode is to collect the five golden

[08:02] tickets for each kid.

[08:04] Now each of you select which kid you're going to miss.

[08:07] So imagine that.

[08:08] Imagine the mode starts and it's like which one of the five kids tickets do you want to

[08:12] go after now?

[08:13] And what you want is you want to be able to select like Varukas Salt.

[08:18] And when Varukas Salt's golden ticket mode starts, you want to hear these clips, you want

[08:24] to see this video and you want to hear the callouts from the film that you just remember

[08:30] and love so much.

[08:31] So imagine a scene like this, a mode in the game like this where you are collecting her

[08:36] golden ticket and you know the shots each time the shots are hit properly in the right

[08:42] order, it progresses to another callout from her.

[08:46] Okay, so if you remember the scene, you're in her daddy's factory and he's got all the

[08:50] line workers opening up tons of Wonka bar boxes and she's complaining to her dad how she

[08:56] wants the first ticket.

[08:57] All right, I'm going to play the clip now and I want you just to close your eyes, listen

[09:01] to this, imagine playing a pinball game in which this is the mode and again, it's like

[09:08] you're trying to hit like eight shots in a row and that each shot will trigger a new call

[09:13] out from her and her father ending up with the final shot in which the woman on the line

[09:19] finds the golden ticket.

[09:21] How amazing would that be?

[09:22] Listen to this right now.

[09:23] I want you to be the first to find a golden ticket daddy.

[09:26] I know Angel, we're doing the best we can.

[09:30] I've got every girl on the bleeding staff on him for you.

[09:33] All right, where is it?

[09:34] Why haven't they found it?

[09:35] Farouka, sweetheart, I'm not a magician.

[09:39] Give me time.

[09:40] I want it now.

[09:41] What's the matter with those twats down there?

[09:43] For five days now the entire flipping factory's been on the job.

[09:47] They haven't shelled a peanut in there since Monday.

[09:50] They've been shelling flaming chocolate bars from Don'ta Dusk.

[09:54] Make them want knights.

[09:55] They're not even trying.

[09:57] They don't want to find it.

[09:59] They're jealous of me.

[10:00] Sweetheart, I can't push them no harder.

[10:02] 19,000 bars an hour they're shelling.

[10:05] 760,000 have done so far.

[10:07] You promised daddy.

[10:09] You promised I'd have it the very first day.

[10:11] I won't talk to you ever again.

[10:13] You're a rotten mean family.

[10:14] You never give me anything I want.

[10:17] I won't go to school till I have it.

[10:18] Farouka, sweetheart, Angel.

[10:21] Now, the only 40 gets left in the whole world and the whole Roddy world.

[10:26] I'm counting for them.

[10:27] What can I do?

[10:28] I'm counting.

[10:29] I thought it was all here, dear.

[10:31] I'm counting for you.

[10:32] I won't see.

[10:33] I mean, how easy would it have been to take that scene and slice it up into eight different

[10:44] parts of all those iconic call outs and make a mode about finding Farouka's ticket.

[10:51] Right?

[10:52] Are we going to see that?

[10:53] I mean, that's my question.

[10:54] It's my very basic question.

[10:56] Are we not going to see that in the game or are we going to see it in the game?

[10:59] That's all I want.

[11:00] I just want an answer on whether or not that is how this game is going to be.

[11:05] You can't tell me we're not going to have a scene in which Mike TV, right?

[11:08] You got the Wankovision in the game.

[11:11] There's not going to be a mode that's all about sending Mike TV through the Wankovision

[11:18] and appearing small on that Wankovision TV.

[11:22] Remember that scene?

[11:23] How easy would it be to take this scene and dice it up a few times into a bunch of shots

[11:28] to the point where like you start out by sending the Wankovision bar across the Wankovision

[11:32] and then he jumps in and you get these amazing call outs.

[11:36] And here's the thing too.

[11:37] It's all about the call outs and the connection between the characters, Willy Wonka, the parents

[11:42] and the scene.

[11:44] That is what people love so much about this movie.

[11:47] You can't extract those elements and how those elements combined in the film in the

[11:54] Pimbal experience and expect people to fall in love with it.

[11:57] You can't do it.

[11:58] It has to be connected the way we remember.

[12:02] That's the key of nostalgia.

[12:04] When you start dicing it up differently, it ruins our memories of what we love.

[12:10] Remember that scene?

[12:11] Let me play it for you right now.

[12:12] Look at me.

[12:13] I'm going to be the first person in the world to be sent by television.

[12:15] Stop!

[12:16] Don't come back.

[12:17] Let's get out of here.

[12:18] Mike!

[12:19] Where are you?

[12:20] He's up there.

[12:21] The remaining pieces.

[12:22] Mike!

[12:23] What's that again?

[12:24] Wash the screen.

[12:25] Mike!

[12:26] Why is he taking so long?

[12:27] No, he and pieces take a long time to put together.

[12:31] Where are they?

[12:32] There's definitely something coming through.

[12:35] Mike?

[12:36] It's hard to tell, but I...

[12:37] A little girl was getting smaller by the pilot.

[12:44] Look at me, everybody.

[12:45] On the first person in the world to be sent by television.

[12:47] I mean, you see what I'm talking about.

[12:49] The mother calling out in English.

[12:51] Willy's always got this sort of like, well, I told him not to do a kind of attitude.

[12:57] Stop!

[12:58] Don't!

[12:59] I love it.

[13:00] And then you've got like the other kids just be wilder by what you're doing.

[13:04] And then you've got like the other kids just be wilder by what's going on.

[13:07] And you've got the magic of the actual thing occurring.

[13:10] But we remember it in those order, you know, in that order.

[13:15] And you can't...

[13:16] Yeah, I'm just...

[13:17] That's my question is like, I don't know if we're going to get that.

[13:21] And, you know, are we not going to get violent eating the gum and her describing the flavors of the gum to the point?

[13:30] Imagine this as a mode.

[13:32] You know, you have to progress violet through her gum chewing experience.

[13:37] And you've got the clips from that scene.

[13:39] And she starts off and Willy's telling her not to eat the gum.

[13:42] And he hasn't perfected it yet.

[13:44] And then she describes the different courses.

[13:46] Let me play it for you right now.

[13:47] How good of a mode would this be?

[13:49] This little piece of gum is a three-course dinner.

[13:52] Bull! No roast beef. But I haven't got a quite right yet.

[13:55] I don't care.

[13:56] I wouldn't do that.

[13:57] I really wouldn't.

[13:58] So why is this gum that that's for me?

[14:00] Right?

[14:01] I don't do anything stupid.

[14:02] What's it taste like?

[14:03] It's tomato soup.

[14:04] It's hot and creamy.

[14:05] I can actually feel it running down my throat.

[14:07] Stop, don't.

[14:08] Hey, the second course is coming up.

[14:10] Roast beef in a big potato.

[14:13] Mmm.

[14:14] With sour cream.

[14:15] What's for dessert, baby?

[14:17] Deserve?

[14:18] Here it comes.

[14:19] Louberry pie in cream.

[14:20] It's the most marvelous, blueberry pie in every case.

[14:23] Holy, toly, toly, to what's happening to your face?

[14:26] Cool it down.

[14:27] Let me finish.

[14:28] Yeah, but your face is turning blue.

[14:30] Violet, you're turning violet, violet.

[14:32] What are you talking about?

[14:33] Violet, what are you doing now?

[14:35] You're blowing up.

[14:36] I feel funny.

[14:37] Not surprised.

[14:38] What's happening?

[14:39] You're blowing up like a balloon.

[14:40] Like a blueberry.

[14:41] Somebody do something.

[14:42] Call a doctor.

[14:43] Sticker with a pin.

[14:44] Show pop.

[14:45] It happens every time they all become blueberries.

[14:47] You really done it this time, heavens, you're wonka.

[14:49] I'll break you for this.

[14:51] Oh, well, I'll get it right in here.

[14:53] Help!

[14:54] Help!

[14:55] We got to let the air out of her quick.

[14:58] There's no air in there.

[14:59] That's juice.

[15:00] Juice?

[15:01] Would you roll the young lady down to the juicing room at once, please?

[15:04] What for?

[15:05] We're squeezing.

[15:06] She has to be squeezed immediately before she explodes.

[15:09] Explodes!

[15:10] It's a fairly simple operation.

[15:12] So if they're wise, they will listen to Canada.

[15:32] This game, I hope, finds a way to code those kinds of iconic scenes into it the way we

[15:41] remember.

[15:42] I've said it before.

[15:43] I love this game.

[15:44] I think the layout is great.

[15:46] I think the shots are great.

[15:47] I think everything about it really blew me away.

[15:51] But the one part that wasn't quite finished was very early on was the code.

[15:55] I keep hearing people say, well, don't worry.

[15:58] Don't worry that you're not seeing the movie scenes come through because it's early.

[16:02] It's J.J.P.

[16:03] And of course, they'll put everything that you want into the game.

[16:07] And I hear that broad sort of...

[16:13] What's the best way to say it?

[16:14] It's a broad, calming, don't worry.

[16:19] They're definitely going to figure it out.

[16:22] Kind of sentiment.

[16:24] But I don't know.

[16:25] Look at the issues they had with Pirates of the Caribbean when it came to assets.

[16:29] So I'm not quite sure where these assets are going to fall.

[16:33] But here's the one thing.

[16:35] I just want to read you again.

[16:37] And I already read this on air.

[16:39] But after seeing more and more of the game, I keep being reminded by one thing that Joe Katz said in his email back to me and Jack shared it with me.

[16:50] And I want you to just draw the conclusion on whether or not you think this statement means that we're not going to see kinds of things like I just described on this podcast in this game.

[17:03] And then you're going to have to make up a decision on whether or not you think it's the right way to approach Willy Wonka.

[17:10] The other question I have is, man, I'm like, if you think about Jersey Jax history, they often show this stuff before it's on the line.

[17:19] And what that does is it gives us a chance to critique it and ask for things to be changed.

[17:26] I mean, look at the Hobbit. They changed the entire art package. It took a year before the game came out.

[17:32] Look at Pirates of the Caribbean. They took out some of the mechanisms.

[17:35] So, so Willy Wonka, you know, the game in which I I praised it to high heaven.

[17:41] And I always say this on my show, are they going to find one thing that's always going to be the Achilles heel of the game?

[17:47] And then it's just going to make it hard for people to get over it.

[17:50] I still think this game is going to sell a ton of them.

[17:53] But that's not what you guys want. What you want is a game that brings to life the theme that you absolutely love.

[18:02] And of course, we always say we want Jersey Jack to make our dream themes. But here is the thing.

[18:08] When it comes to movie clips, and I don't just see this as movie clips.

[18:12] I see it as like iconic scenes from the film.

[18:16] Jocats said, and I'm reading this word for word.

[18:21] I wanted to make a game that felt different than just here is a mode and here is a scene that goes with it.

[18:31] Okay? He says that has been done a lot in recent history.

[18:36] So this game is not going to have a slew of movie clips associated with specific modes.

[18:45] Rinse repeat style. Okay. I mean, I think we have our answer right there.

[18:52] Now, my issue with that statement is quite frankly this.

[18:56] There's a reason Joe why this is done a lot in Pimball.

[19:01] There's a reason why this is done in Pimball machines that are based upon themes that we love.

[19:06] Because the Pimball designers and coders, their job is not to take an iconic movie or theme.

[19:14] Movie or theme that we love and just do whatever they want and take a completely different approach with that theme than we remember.

[19:23] Their job, and I believe this, their job is to pay homage to the theme that we love.

[19:30] Their job is a coder like Lyman Sheets coding Batman 66.

[19:34] His job is to make a game that taps into the elements and the things that I love about Batman 66.

[19:43] And to bring that show to life through the Pimball machine.

[19:48] And if you play that game, it's all mode based.

[19:52] It's all mode based based upon the seasons of Batman 66.

[19:56] And it brings those characters and those villains to life and those episodes to life in a way that makes everybody happy.

[20:04] Okay. He didn't say like, well, I'm just going to like throw that out because it's Rinse repeat.

[20:09] Same thing with the game, another game that I love.

[20:12] Another game that I think is the best possible way to bring an iconic story to life.

[20:17] And that game is Lord of the Rings.

[20:19] Imagine Lord of the Rings without the modes that represent the iconic scenes in the film.

[20:26] How do you, how do you even do that?

[20:29] You know, and so will he want to me if I look at it as a narrative?

[20:34] It's the easiest sort of narrative to bring to life in a Pimball machine.

[20:39] You've only got five kids, a chocolate factory, five iconic moments in which they find their tickets, five iconic different rooms, maybe six in the chocolate factory in which each kid interacts with the Willy Wonka magical world.

[20:58] And then you have the hero character Charlie who's being pulled through this journey.

[21:04] And who does everybody relate to in this movie?

[21:07] Well, maybe we all have different personalities at each kid's sort of embodies.

[21:12] But it's such an iconic story, the journey of Charlie, the poor boy, who then inherits the chocolate factory.

[21:20] How do you take that story?

[21:22] That time has told us is iconic.

[21:25] And how do you not just put that into the game?

[21:29] The exact way we got it from Warner Brothers, the exact way we got it from Gene Wilder, from the author.

[21:37] You know, it's not about just randomly collecting Wonka bars to get to multi balls.

[21:42] Like that, I just, I'm worried.

[21:45] And I know it's really early to be worried.

[21:49] But I want to share with you where I'm at right now.

[21:52] This is what this podcast does.

[21:54] It's like, oh, wait, Chris, wait, wait six months. Don't say anything.

[21:57] Just wait. See, but that's not about what this shows about.

[22:01] I'm not here just waiting to, to I get my game.

[22:06] My show is always existed to call it like I see it.

[22:11] And I think some of you thought like I went to Jersey Jack.

[22:13] And now I'm just going to be like a Jersey Jack chill.

[22:15] And I'm not going to say how I feel about all these games.

[22:19] This podcast will always do this.

[22:21] I'm looking at all these games constructively.

[22:24] I still think this game is incredible.

[22:27] But again, I just am getting a little worried that the Achilles heel of Willy Wonka

[22:33] is what I've described on this podcast.

[22:36] And every stream I watch, every time I see the game now, I'm just looking for one thing.

[22:43] I'm just looking for the iconic moments in that film that I remember as a kid coming through.

[22:50] And here's the other part.

[22:52] If for some reason they just, that's not what they have or they have like,

[22:56] there's a licensing issue.

[22:57] That's fine. Here's the thing.

[22:59] Just tell us that.

[23:00] You know, let's say other part like do you have just 10 minutes of footage or 20 minutes

[23:04] or you couldn't get the licensing deal with the actors and the voices.

[23:07] Whatever it is, just tell us the truth.

[23:10] We're all grown adults.

[23:12] Like the truth is the truth on pirates.

[23:14] Like we all know the realities of the licensing agreement on pirates.

[23:17] And so, you know, what happened?

[23:19] They sold 1,000 of them.

[23:21] People are now like hunting down alleys and cees to get one.

[23:25] Pires turned out to be a pinball experience in which a lot of people loved.

[23:29] It's almost like the pinball experience overcame the assets, you know,

[23:34] the link when assets that they had.

[23:36] And so that's what pirates will always be.

[23:40] So I'm just not sure quite what Willy Wonka is.

[23:43] Because I see more of the scenes in Wizard of Oz.

[23:46] I see way more of the integration of the movie in the Hobbit.

[23:50] And so I'm just not quite clear if this was an asset reality.

[23:57] If this was the deal they signed or if Joe Katz designed it to be this way,

[24:02] even though they did have access to everything, I'm not sure.

[24:05] I'm not sure if they're comfortable telling us.

[24:08] But this is just where I'm at.

[24:11] Now, that means the following.

[24:13] I'm still in on the game.

[24:15] I still want my collector's edition of Willy Wonka.

[24:18] So I'm not baneling now.

[24:20] But this is the main thing I'm looking for.

[24:22] And two things.

[24:24] I either expect to see stuff like this in the game or expect them to tell us

[24:30] what the reality is of the game and not just say like see what I don't like

[24:36] is broad statements being like everything you remember from the movie and love will be in there.

[24:40] What does that mean?

[24:42] What does that mean?

[24:43] You know, it's like when I saw the way Stern diced up Star Wars.

[24:46] Terrible.

[24:47] Terrible way to take that franchise and dice it up.

[24:49] You have a respect to these themes.

[24:51] You have a respect to these properties.

[24:53] If you can't do the property justice.

[24:56] If you can't do it right.

[24:57] If you can't make the pinball game convey and transfer that iconic movie

[25:02] into the pinball experience, then don't make it.

[25:05] I just don't want a compromised version of a theme that I love.

[25:09] Because you know why?

[25:11] Because there's too many great games out there that show us the way to do it.

[25:16] And don't say that's something like a mode based upon an iconic scene from a movie.

[25:21] I didn't want to do that.

[25:23] That's Rinssen repeat.

[25:24] No, that's not Rinssen repeat.

[25:26] It's called this.

[25:27] It's what the people want.

[25:30] And you have to be very careful not to put your desire to be different in front of

[25:37] the needs of the consumer.

[25:39] That's marketing people.

[25:41] And that is why I continue to watch this hobby.

[25:44] And I continue to get excited about this hobby and intrigued and baffled and confused

[25:50] by the marketing decisions these companies make.

[25:54] I'm told that there's a billionaire backing this company.

[25:58] Get it right.

[25:59] What is it going to cost to get the clips in the game right?

[26:04] If a designer comes in or a coder and says here's what we're going to do.

[26:07] We're not going to do mode based based upon the iconic scenes from the movie.

[26:11] That's when Jack needs to walk into the room and say what are you talking about Joe?

[26:16] We're not we're not going to like break up.

[26:19] This has to be a mode based game based upon the iconic scenes from the film.

[26:24] Are those are those conversations like is that how it happens?

[26:28] I don't know.

[26:30] I don't know.

[26:32] But this has been episode 353.

[26:35] I think of Gnatus Pimball podcast.

[26:37] I want to thank you guys for listening.

[26:40] I want to thank you guys for tuning in weekly.

[26:42] Again, this wasn't an episode I planned.

[26:44] It's just an episode that happened.

[26:46] And that is why I love doing this show because you know what Pimball is interesting.

[26:49] I wake up one day and something happens that I didn't expect.

[26:53] I want to give a huge special thank you to Rodney.

[26:58] Rodney Rodney see it.

[27:00] I don't want to butcher your last name Rodney for donating to my Patreon page.

[27:04] Thank you so much Rodney.

[27:06] I really appreciate all of you 3435 people out there who contribute to Gnatus Pimball podcast on Patreon.

[27:13] It means so much to me.

[27:15] And I want to thank you to I.E. Pimball stream for banning Gnata.

[27:19] You don't ban Gnata.

[27:21] Let me just let me just end on that note.

[27:24] You don't ban me from asking questions about a game that I'm about to buy.

[27:31] You know, and I've seen this before.

[27:33] It's like, you know, I've seen other streamers be like, well, you need to be respectful.

[27:36] You can't ask tough questions in the chat.

[27:38] Yes, I can.

[27:39] Do you not know what Twitch is?

[27:42] Do you not know what the internet is?

[27:44] You want to ban conversation.

[27:47] You want to ban questions.

[27:49] You want to ban me from asking questions about Willy Wonka Pimball.

[27:55] And that's, and I'm going to say that's the reason why I'm doing this show today because I feel a little bit like

[28:01] Slated.

[28:02] You're going to ban the guy who did a podcast about how much he loved this game.

[28:07] And he's just asking questions about why aren't we seeing the movie clips the way we love the movie.

[28:12] And then you want to delete all my messages.

[28:15] So thank you, I.E. Pimball for banning Gnata.

[28:18] Let me tell you what's going to happen.

[28:20] More people, because you ban me, more people will listen to this podcast, then we'll watch your stream of Jersey Jack Pimball's Willy Wonka.

[28:32] So all you did now was more hurt than help the Willy Wonka sales experience.

[28:39] So just a lesson to all you guys out there.

[28:42] Thank you for banning Gnata because when you ban Gnata, it never ends up well for whatever you're trying to protect.

[28:47] So grow up a little bit, realize this is the modern world and you're grown men.

[28:53] And if I want to ask some tough questions about a game that I have $12,500 on the line for, you know, it's a free country, isn't it?

[29:01] Nobody likes censorship.

[29:03] Nobody likes when the moderators at Pinside like delete these kinds of questions.

[29:08] So thank you for banning me.

[29:10] That's it for today people.

[29:12] And so you know the image on this podcast, that is the screen grab I took, that when they ban me from the chat, you can see it.

[29:22] It's like all of Canadian, all of Canadian messages have been deleted.

[29:26] And then someone wants like, what happened to all of Chris's comments, right?

[29:30] So that's the other thing too, is like, people see this stuff.

[29:33] Oh no, he, he shall be stricken from this stream so that when people watch it, they will not see these questions pop up.

[29:41] Really, really lame.

[29:44] Have a great day everybody.
