[00:00] And beyond order, I talked a fair bit about Harry Potter. And a lot of the people who'd like to take

[00:04] part shots at me took part shots at that because, you know, I don't know, they think Harry Potter's

[00:08] beneath their notice or something. But, you know, I kind of noticed that JK Rowling made several

[00:12] billion dollars building the biggest entertainment enterprise of the decade. And Rose herself from,

[00:18] you know, single mother status, unemployed single mother status to richer than the queen,

[00:23] and then occupied every movie screen for like 10 years. Maybe something's going on there.

[00:30] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast. The only Pinball Podcast where node board number

[00:55] 10 is not going to burn up on you. Stern Pinball has got to fix this thing. You got a fire breathing

[01:01] dragon and the game is burning up. Distributors are being told to tell their customers,

[01:08] don't turn on your $13,000 game, but I'm not here to talk about that. I'm not here to talk about you

[01:16] X-Men owners. You're never getting a great game. It's never happening. Let it go. Sell the game.

[01:26] Stern has moved on. Jack has moved on to his next game. King Kong is where all the effort is going

[01:34] to go. I'm here to talk to you about Harry freaking Potter and why I think Harry Potter on month one

[01:43] of this game coming out is going to sink not down. It's going to soar like a quidditch match

[01:52] all the way to $20,000 easily. If you get yourself a collector's edition at $15,000,

[02:03] this game is a, going to sell out instantly. B, it's going to be impossible to get one unless

[02:09] you go over that 15K and why I think that $20,000 is going to be put on the table all day long.

[02:21] You heard it in the intro to this show. For those of you out there, here is my rationale for why.

[02:28] Potter is going to get to 20K. Look, I'm going to give you my rationale. This doesn't mean the game

[02:34] is going to be great. It doesn't mean Eric Minier is finally going to dial some soul and heart into

[02:40] a game, which I'm not sure he can do. I know he's a little bit smug. I know he's got a little bit of

[02:47] an ego, but if there's one thing Eric hasn't done is made a game that has soul and you can feel the

[02:54] passion. GNR, yeah, kind of there. It is there, but it's not really because of him. It's the music

[03:01] and the light shows in that game that give it soul. What gives GNR soul is Axel and Slash,

[03:08] not Eric Minier. So this is going to be his ultimate test. Is he going to be able to deliver?

[03:13] But that doesn't even matter when it comes to what will the second hand value of this game be.

[03:20] So look, you got Harry Potter. You've got this theme that for the longest time,

[03:26] everyone thought they would never make a Harry Potter game. JK Rowling did not want Harry Potter

[03:31] in CD bars. That was the word on the street. She has sold 600 million books. The movie franchise

[03:42] has made over, I think, $8 billion at the box office. There is an entire generation of people

[03:52] who grew up with Harry Potter as their Star Wars. I feel like anybody born in the 80s,

[04:00] Harry Potter is their Star Wars. It is a theme that crosses over. It's not just old men. It is

[04:08] much more mainstream. It's had a Broadway show that is hugely popular. It is also, when you think

[04:16] about it, it's the perfect theme for pinball. So many good pinball games. The theme about magic

[04:25] and spells and flying through the air and the use of magnets and disappearing balls and

[04:33] misdirecting shots because something magical is happening. Harry Potter as a theme opens up the

[04:41] door for so much pinball magic. So all that is working in its favor, if you will. Now, $15,000

[04:50] is a boatload of money. A lot of you are like, Canada, you're stupid. The prices are too high.

[04:55] There is no way it's going to go up from there. But here's the thing, everybody. We've all now

[05:01] become very desensitized to the high prices in pinball. It's everywhere, right? It's stupid.

[05:08] I don't agree with it. It just has become what it is. And so here's the thing is Jersey Jack

[05:15] Pinball is the highest priced pinball company in all of pinball right now. But they've made it

[05:21] where the $15,000 CE is really the only version of their game you want to get. If you look at Avatar,

[05:29] it's 15K. They've sold more Avatar CEs at $15,000. Then they've sold of Avatar

[05:36] Ellie's at $12,000. It's because if you've got 12, you've got 15, they also make the $15,000 CE

[05:46] so much nicer with an awesome topper, the armor, the shooter rod, everything about it, right? You

[05:52] don't want to spend 12 grand. Think about that. Who wants to spend 12 grand and have the bottom of

[05:58] the line version of the game? And even though Avatar, right, is a movie that is soulless,

[06:06] it's a franchise that I don't think anybody really cares about. I don't think people collect

[06:11] Avatar stuff. Nobody has Avatar tattoos or wears Avatar t-shirts. Avatar to me is a little bit

[06:18] like John Wick. Like it's done really well at the box office, but it's not something you really

[06:23] collect or something you want to own the way Harry Potter is. And even though Avatar has no toys in

[06:30] it and no real magic, they've still sold a decent amount of those collector's editions.

[06:36] But the reason why I think Harry Potter is going to take off, unlike any other pin, I think it's

[06:42] going to take off more than Metallica remastered Ellie. The reason why is this. In pinball over

[06:49] the last three to four years, we've been beaten down with mediocre themes left and right. We've

[06:56] been beaten down with high prices. If you've bought pins over the last three to four years, you've been

[07:03] absolutely destroyed on the second hand value of all of your games. The argument about is the game

[07:09] fun or not is now irrelevant. Because yeah, every pin is somewhat fun, but it's a lot more fun to

[07:16] buy the game after it's lost like the three to four to five to $6,000 that all these Ellie's and

[07:23] CEs are losing. So you've got three to four years of mediocre games, everything is losing value,

[07:30] and everyone is sort of waiting on the sidelines. Now I think there has to be a significant decrease

[07:36] in the amount of people that are running towards every new and box game. And then you come out with

[07:41] something like Harry Potter. It is the biggest theme to come out in pinball since Star Wars,

[07:48] right? And Star Wars was a crappy game. If you think about it, what was the last triple A theme

[07:57] pinball machine that was actually great? I mean, think about that for a minute. What triple A theme

[08:04] game that came out over the last like five, six, seven years was actually great. Like nothing.

[08:11] Ghostbusters is a huge theme. The game is terrible. The game shoots so bad. Like it's not a good game.

[08:18] You're holding on for dear life. It's not that much fun. Star Wars was terrible. Maybe Jurassic

[08:26] Park, you could argue, was the best major theme that's come out. But even Jurassic Park, it's got

[08:31] no freaking assets. The fact that we accept it, stern pinball, cheeping out on Jurassic Park,

[08:38] and not putting the iconic movie into the game, unacceptable. That's not what Jurassic Park fans

[08:46] want. They don't want just some generic arcade, like 16 bit looking graphics, you know, rolling

[08:53] through the park like that. I want to see the damn dinos. You don't even see the damn CGI dinos in the

[09:00] damn game. That's not what people want. So we've got Harry Potter, the biggest theme maybe ever for

[09:10] pinball. Harry Potter is also a theme where your wives and your kids are really going to want one.

[09:18] Do you think your kids and wives really want Metallica? Do they really want John Wick? Do they

[09:24] really want Venom? Do they really want Jaws? No, but they're really, really, really going to want

[09:30] Harry Potter. And when you think about that, all these pinheads, all these millionaires, all their

[09:38] $200,000 pin collections, you think they're not going to do whatever it takes to get a Harry

[09:43] Potter CE? Of course they are. Now, the other question is this, do I think it's going to be a good

[09:49] game? Do I think Eric Minier is going to deliver finally? Is it going to have muted clips? Is it

[09:56] going to be empty? Is it going to be devoid of magical mechs and toys? My big worry is that

[10:01] Jersey Jack will do what Jersey Jack does best. They always find a way to mess it up, right? They've

[10:07] never done the other thing, right? They've never done the other thing and like exceeded our expectations.

[10:12] They didn't exceed our expectations on Willy Wonka. They didn't do it on Hobbit. They didn't do it on

[10:18] Toy Story. They didn't do it on Godfather. They didn't do it on anything. There's been zero games

[10:23] where they exceeded our expectations except for maybe Guns N' Roses and Elton John. And the reason

[10:29] why Guns N' Roses exceeded our expectations is it was just awesome. It was, you got to remember,

[10:34] like G&R was the first time we'd ever seen an experiential moment like that in a pinball machine.

[10:40] All those lights, the hot rails, the way they made the game where you're playing a concert in a box,

[10:46] that had never been done before and that was a really smart decision. And then Elton John, we had no

[10:52] expectations, right? Nobody wanted Elton John. So when Elton John came out and it shot so damn

[10:58] fun and even though it didn't have many toys and it had cheap cake toppers twirling around,

[11:03] tiny dancers, it didn't matter. It just felt like a stern gameplay put into a JJP platform

[11:11] and that's why Elton John is fun. And the code is simple and you know how to play the game and

[11:16] you're not confused and you're not choosing between 35,000 different patches. You can just play the

[11:22] game and understand what does what. But it's still not a very creative game. I mean those three

[11:28] targets up the middle that don't do anything. Come on gang, it's like these are $15,000 games.

[11:35] So Jersey Jack Pinball has a golden opportunity. Eric Minier has a golden opportunity to finally

[11:42] nail it, to finally create the masterpiece. Look, Eric confirms that this is his dream theme.

[11:49] He grew up loving Harry Potter. So is he going to make it magical? My worry is this, it's going to

[11:55] have muted clips. My worry is it's not going to have nearly as many mechanical, magical mechs as it

[12:02] should have. The fact that they're sending a cease and desist to that kid that's making that homebrew

[12:08] game, to me that's everything because I think they're nervous that that kid is going to show

[12:14] everybody what's possible if you make a wide body Harry Potter game and then Jersey Jack wants to go

[12:20] and shut that kid down. That's ridiculous. That is absolutely ridiculous. It makes me feel like

[12:27] they're insecure about what they've got and they don't want people to see that game. The good news

[12:33] for that kid is keep going. Nothing you're doing is illegal. You can make a one-on-one game like

[12:40] you're doing and there's nothing the movie studio can do. There's nothing that Jersey Jack can do.

[12:47] Show the world what's possible. But even though I'm worried that Jersey Jack is going to do what

[12:53] they do best, which is find a way to mess it up, it doesn't matter. It's Harry Potter. And because

[13:00] of all the lackluster themes, the Dungeons and Dragons catching on fire, the X-Men,

[13:06] Le's losing $4,000 in value because the design has issues, the code is terrible,

[13:12] all of this is going to play to the favor of Harry Potter. And also what's going to play to the favor

[13:17] of Harry Potter is King Kong is not out yet. So they're going to have a window in which nothing

[13:25] is really going to steal away the money or the imagination or the room in your game room,

[13:31] like Harry Potter is going to steal. When Potter drops, you're going to see so many of the older

[13:39] Jersey Jack games that are sitting in people's collections. You're going to see those go up for

[13:45] sale. People are going to make room for Potter. And again, I think the CEs, they will sell a

[13:52] thousand of them at 15,000 a pop. They will sell out instantly and then instantly on the second

[14:01] hand market where the initial offerings will be, will be $19,999. People will make $5,000 profit

[14:13] if you get your hands on a Harry Potter CE. Trust me, people made $5,000 on freaking Metallica.

[14:23] This thing is going to have way more energy behind it, way more demand than Metallica, Ellie. And so

[14:29] when it happens, totally expected to go through the roof. And look, I don't even know if 20 is the

[14:36] ceiling. I do know this, a thousand is a lot though, right? This isn't like only 500 Metallica only had

[14:43] 500, but I am telling you right now, I will take a week off from podcasting. If when Harry Potter

[14:51] comes out in the first month, we don't see an instant sell out and we don't see games on the

[14:57] second hand market for $20,000 and people are going to get it. That is the thing, people. They're

[15:03] going to get it. Everybody, happy Friday. What do you think? Do you think it's going to do it? Do

[15:09] you think it's going to be a hit game? Look, I still don't think the game is going to be great. I want

[15:13] Eric to prove me wrong, but I just think Jersey Jack is going to find a way to mess this game up.

[15:19] But other than that, I don't even think it matters. I really don't think it matters. I think the

[15:25] second hand value, because it's Harry freaking Potter. The moment you've got a Hogwarts castle

[15:33] under glass, you got that logo on the cabinet and on the back box, and you've got that magic wand and

[15:40] the lightning bolt on his forehead, and you hear that Harry Potter theme song. The moment you hear

[15:47] it, and I'm about to play it right now, chitching people, if you got your hands on a CE, you just

[15:54] made $5,000. I will fight anybody verbally who disagrees. Canada out.
