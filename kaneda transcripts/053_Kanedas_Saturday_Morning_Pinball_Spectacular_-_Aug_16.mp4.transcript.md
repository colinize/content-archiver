[00:48] Ah! Good morning children!

[00:52] Hey, hey, that's what they say when we're together.

[00:58] And watch how you play.

[01:00] Don't understand and so are burning just as fast as we can.

[01:08] Holding on to one another's hand.

[01:14] Alright, welcome to Canita's Saturday morning spectacular.

[01:18] The One Pinball Show.

[01:20] That the Pinball Brothers don't want to listen to today.

[01:24] We're going to have a good time.

[01:26] How's everybody doing?

[01:28] Saturday.

[01:30] We have a big shout out to Breen, Brenda's cousin who is out in the backyard with the children so I could actually do this show this week.

[01:40] I will say this.

[01:42] I got zero sleep last night.

[01:44] So I'm a little tired.

[01:46] The kids moving around different beds, Cassian was fussy, couldn't get him down.

[01:52] And then eventually we all ended up in Killian's Paw Patrol bed with one on one side and one on the other.

[02:00] And me just like a sarcophagus just like in a...

[02:04] Like I couldn't move.

[02:06] I was in a tomb of a little child.

[02:10] You know, like two little children.

[02:14] I didn't buy a Pinball machine instead.

[02:16] I spent a week vacation.

[02:18] Charles just smart.

[02:20] I think more and more people.

[02:22] I got some people texting me today.

[02:24] They're on vacation.

[02:26] They're doing other stuff with their money.

[02:28] They're realizing, you know, maybe I'm good.

[02:32] What happens in a world where everyone just starts to feel like I'm kind of good with the games I got.

[02:38] The notion of buying all these games new in box.

[02:42] Having to spend 300 bucks on new power supplies.

[02:46] Having half these boutique companies take forever to get you product.

[02:51] You know, it's going to keep shipping away at people's enthusiasm.

[02:55] Good morning from the hospital bed.

[02:58] What?

[02:59] Ed, what are you doing in the hospital bed?

[03:01] Well, Ed, we hope you feel better.

[03:03] Hopefully it's nothing too serious.

[03:05] I'm glad we could entertain or I could entertain you this morning.

[03:09] And sad boy pops in again with the damn mula.

[03:15] Buddy, I love you.

[03:16] You've become a weekly staple here at the top of the leader board.

[03:20] Pinball brothers said they only have 150 predators left.

[03:24] They must be gaslighting us.

[03:26] No way they've sold that many.

[03:28] Well, sad boy.

[03:30] That's not a proper use of the word gas lighting.

[03:37] They are simply deceiving us.

[03:39] Gaslighting is when you slowly.

[03:43] To give you the origin.

[03:44] It's when husbands used to slowly lower the gas light in their homes.

[03:50] And then all of a sudden the wife wakes up one day and it's completely dark.

[03:55] And she thinks it's always been that dark.

[03:58] It's the slowly manipulating of of of something to make people believe it's always been that way.

[04:05] So what's happening here?

[04:09] Damn man.

[04:10] Ed, we hope you feel better.

[04:11] What's happening here is they're just flat out.

[04:14] Like they're not like lying.

[04:18] They're not telling the full story though.

[04:20] So again, I think it's calculated deception.

[04:23] They did not sell 650.

[04:26] What I heard is they sold around 100.

[04:29] Maybe 150.

[04:30] I heard they're only going to make 300.

[04:33] Look, if they if they want to come out and say we've sold 650.

[04:37] Okay, cool.

[04:39] Say it.

[04:40] They're not going to say it.

[04:42] Did they come out and say, hey, we were not allowed to release that that video of Arnold.

[04:48] Nope, they didn't say that right away.

[04:50] I think in the end.

[04:52] Hardly anybody ordered predator.

[04:55] I don't even think they got 200 games sold at the prices.

[04:58] And now they're screwing over their US dealers and distros.

[05:02] And even with the reduced price, it's now $12,000.

[05:06] Like, nobody's buying it.

[05:08] Gang, you're not buying it.

[05:09] Who's buying an Arnold list predator?

[05:12] It's not happening.

[05:15] And I think they're just trying to break even on the game now.

[05:19] And what they're trying to do is they need to sell the 300 games that they ordered.

[05:24] 300 parts for make no mistake gang.

[05:28] If they don't, this could be the end of the pinball brothers.

[05:33] And they, you know, like when you read what they said, we're renegotiating the license.

[05:40] What does that mean?

[05:42] You thought you were going to sell 800.

[05:44] And you couldn't even sell 300.

[05:47] It was a terrible decision made by a group of people that didn't do any market resources.

[05:53] And the market bit them in the butt.

[05:56] Now the tariffs didn't help out, but it wasn't about the tariffs.

[06:00] Gang, think about it.

[06:02] If a Dutch pinball revealed back to the future today with the tariffs and a $15,000 price tag.

[06:11] And it was loaded.

[06:13] They'd sell out everyone.

[06:15] It was just not the game people will buy without the assets.

[06:20] This offer expires end of this commercial vibe.

[06:25] Yeah, it's just so stupid.

[06:27] The fake phone, what doesn't work doesn't work.

[06:30] I've been pronouncing it wrong.

[06:32] It's not it's Dubois Dubois Pennsylvania is now the new headquarters for a for pinball brothers in the United States.

[06:42] Yesterday's show.

[06:44] I hope you guys had a great time watching it.

[06:46] I hope you had a good time watching.

[06:48] Canada do a show for roughly 30 minutes with no editing.

[06:54] I didn't edit that show.

[06:55] I put it right up.

[06:57] And it was a lot of fun to do it that way when I can see myself and I'm just going.

[07:02] I just go.

[07:03] No notes.

[07:04] No, no, no anything else to talk about.

[07:08] Jason Nat rumoring.

[07:11] I'm not going to go to the next game.

[07:14] I'm going to go to the next game.

[07:16] JJ P's next game is Sonic the Hedgehog.

[07:19] We shall see if he's right in a year.

[07:21] You know, Brian with a dollar.

[07:23] Thank you, buddy.

[07:24] But Steve Rich's game is is a long way out.

[07:28] And so it's going to be a it's going to be interesting.

[07:31] I've been waiting.

[07:33] To see what I'm curious about is.

[07:35] And we'll get back to predator in a little bit.

[07:38] Long term feelings are with the game.

[07:41] And everybody loves the way it shoots.

[07:45] The code is, you know, I haven't played the latest code update.

[07:50] But it's a it's a success for for Jersey Jack.

[07:53] I think it's going to be around the same volume of units as guns and roses.

[07:58] I don't think it's going to outsell guns and roses.

[08:01] And.

[08:02] I think what's going to be interesting is I'm you know the CE price.

[08:06] Because I I you know I don't know guns are always a CE price didn't even hold.

[08:11] And there's only 500.

[08:13] I think guns are roses years from now is going to be fine.

[08:17] I think the L. E's will be worth 4,500 bucks.

[08:19] I mean this.

[08:20] I think years from now, G and R L. E's 4,500.

[08:24] And G and R C. E's will end up around.

[08:28] 9,500 10 K.

[08:30] I think that's where it's going to be.

[08:32] Elton John Elton John is.

[08:34] Yeah, you know like here's the thing about Elton John Charles.

[08:39] It's going to hold until Richie's next game comes out because right now there's only one Steve Richie Jersey Jack game you can play.

[08:45] And it's Elton John Elton John is holding the C E's holding around 12.

[08:50] I mean it's lost $3,000 in value.

[08:54] Patrick says I was very interested in predator favorite theme for me but without Arnold.

[08:59] Yeah, it's just there's no way you're selling it without Arnold.

[09:04] Good morning, Louis.

[09:07] Oh man, we've only been her diamonds.

[09:09] Yeah, I'm in the garage.

[09:11] It is a little human out not going to lie.

[09:14] I am hot.

[09:17] And I'm exhausted and I say that because I have the two kids for an entire week.

[09:23] This is going to be the roughest 48 hours, which is the weekend in which right now Brenda's cousin is helping out for a little bit so I could do the show.

[09:35] And then I have them from like 11 to 8 at night and then you know I can't go out.

[09:42] I don't have a babysitter.

[09:45] And then I have them all day tomorrow.

[09:48] All day Monday.

[09:49] All day Tuesday, all day Wednesday.

[09:52] And I've been doing it since Wednesday.

[09:55] So I'm I'm Mr. Mom right now.

[10:00] Will automated get a predator.

[10:02] I don't know.

[10:03] I think they ordered a few maybe two or something.

[10:07] I root for all games be great but predator is a giant nothing burger zero hype from the community.

[10:12] Well, you know, like.

[10:14] This is.

[10:16] The thing is with predator.

[10:18] You know, they they use gen giz to launch it, which you know, I don't have a problem with that.

[10:24] It's just the way they slowly they they should have let people know right away.

[10:29] There's no Arnold in it.

[10:30] They should have just done market research and asked people if they would buy a game without Arnold in it.

[10:35] And I think everything I said in my last show is accurate.

[10:37] I think they thought everybody was going to welcome it like alien.

[10:41] I think they were going to try to get away with that.

[10:43] The problem is this is alien without so go any weaver.

[10:47] Remember how much it was a little little little.

[10:50] A little trivia because again, all these new B content creators don't know any of this history.

[10:55] They just don't know why we why we react the way we react.

[11:01] Remember how much it was no it was less than that.

[11:05] I ordered an alien Ellie right at the beginning.

[11:08] I know exactly how much it was.

[11:13] And he guesses.

[11:16] And it was and it was refundable deposit, which actually is what bankrupted Andrew highway.

[11:26] You guys are like no, Wayne, it wasn't a K Wayne.

[11:31] The initial asking price for highway pinball is alien was $6,500.

[11:36] It was $6,500.

[11:39] Yeah, Dave Sanders knows because he worked on it.

[11:41] I'm going to say $6,500.

[11:44] I have the receipt.

[11:47] So you're telling me that you're going to try to sell a predator for $15,500.

[11:56] 12,000 if they eat the tariffs, which is not happening.

[12:01] It's not happening.

[12:04] My prediction is this game will be maybe the last game we see from pinball brothers.

[12:10] I don't want any pinball company to go under, but I just think they made it.

[12:13] They took a huge gamble and it didn't pay off.

[12:15] It's not personal.

[12:17] They took a huge gamble and it didn't pay off.

[12:22] You know, the game is the game feels pretty middle of the road.

[12:27] And there's just no room for middle of the road when for less money,

[12:31] I can go get a evil debt.

[12:35] I remember you being on board, but I said it.

[12:38] Oh, with Alien, yeah, I was on board at the beginning.

[12:43] It's just, you know, and I think to like this concept of, well,

[12:49] if they only make 300, then the prices of predator are going to go up.

[12:52] It's not going to be the case.

[12:54] Those days are over.

[12:56] Those days are over.

[13:00] Let's talk Star Wars.

[13:02] Let's talk Star.

[13:03] So do you, I keep feeling.

[13:06] I think two things are going to happen.

[13:09] I think the new Star Wars game is going to have more mechanical wow

[13:13] than the Steve Richie game.

[13:16] I think the Steve Richie game is going to shoot better.

[13:20] But I think the new game is going to have better code,

[13:24] and better artwork.

[13:26] I worry that John Borg is going to make a mistake.

[13:30] I worry that he's going to make like a homage

[13:35] to his dad at East Star Wars and make like, you know,

[13:39] like the next chapter in the same game.

[13:42] You know, an evolution of what was out before.

[13:45] And I worry about that.

[13:47] I worry about it being more of a fan layout, more of like, you know,

[13:50] Mechs are in the same place as the old game.

[13:53] I worry about that.

[13:56] And look, Kelly, when you say Star Wars gets played a ton,

[14:02] why do you think that is because of the theme, Kelly?

[14:07] Again, and it shoots fast.

[14:09] It's like, it's, to me, Star Wars is like,

[14:13] it's like, it's like John Wick with a better theme.

[14:17] That's it.

[14:18] It feels to me like John Wick with a better theme.

[14:21] You know, when I go up to John Wick,

[14:23] the reason why I walk away from John Wick after two balls,

[14:26] I just don't care.

[14:27] Like, I just don't care to do this.

[14:30] You know what I mean?

[14:31] Like, I just, it's like labyrinth.

[14:33] I feel the same way when I walk up to a labyrinth.

[14:35] I just kind of walk away right away because I'm just like,

[14:37] I just don't care to be in the labyrinth world right now.

[14:42] When I, when I can look over and see the world of

[14:45] all these other worlds, Jurassic Park.

[14:48] I'd rather be there.

[14:49] I'd rather be Batman.

[14:50] I'd rather be this.

[14:51] I'd rather be Avengers.

[14:52] I'd rather be, you know, I, jaws.

[14:53] I'd rather be playing Godzilla.

[14:55] I, you know, I don't want to be in the labyrinth world.

[14:57] Out of all the worlds I could jump into in a world

[14:59] under glass, labyrinth is not one.

[15:01] Same with John Wick.

[15:02] And that's, that's it.

[15:03] And Star Wars is always a world I want to be in.

[15:05] You know, I would have loved it if John Borg was able to release

[15:09] Indiana Jones because he was, that was the game he really wanted.

[15:13] And something happened after, after the game was developed,

[15:16] something happened with the license and they,

[15:18] they just couldn't release it.

[15:19] So, yeah.

[15:27] Got some exclusive news.

[15:29] I'm going to release on my podcast this week.

[15:32] Stuff nobody's talking about.

[15:35] Gomez said business is good.

[15:37] 500 online working.

[15:38] More pins come and do Costco.

[15:40] I heard sturns on a four day work week.

[15:43] So, I don't, how good is business if you're on a four day work week?

[15:49] How good is it?

[15:51] There's no way they're hiking produce to $8,500.

[15:57] There's, there's no way.

[16:00] That's the, that's, that's not happening.

[16:03] They're not hiking a pro by $2,000 guys.

[16:07] It's just let's.

[16:09] I mean, like, if they do game over for a stern,

[16:15] people are just done.

[16:17] I don't know about you guys.

[16:18] I just, I think people are really good at this.

[16:20] I think people are, I don't know.

[16:23] I think it's the boutique time now.

[16:26] I've been saying it for a while.

[16:27] I think it's, I think Stern had an incredible run.

[16:30] And they're always going to lead by volume.

[16:32] But the excitement, the FOMO, it's boutique.

[16:35] And Jersey Jack is boutique.

[16:38] You know what I'm saying?

[16:39] One game a year is boutique.

[16:41] So, as big as Jersey Jack, they're still boutique.

[16:44] They're still make, they're stay only when you only make one game a year.

[16:47] You are a boutique bespoke pinball manufacturer.

[16:52] If you make more than one game a year, I'll call you mass produced.

[16:59] Labyrinth turned out to be a great pin.

[17:01] Well, if you like labyrinth, I just don't care about the theme at all.

[17:04] Robert, I don't care.

[17:05] I didn't, I didn't, when I was a kid, I didn't care.

[17:07] The only reason I watched it was the C Jennifer Connolly bouncing around.

[17:10] And you know what?

[17:11] I was loving when I was a little boy.

[17:15] The DADD E-Star Wars is 1992 grade and well worth a 1992 price.

[17:21] But not today's.

[17:27] The next theme for pinball brothers is.

[17:32] Hey, question gang, is the new multi-morphic game is the new elemental?

[17:36] Is that the same elemental game that pinball adventures was making?

[17:42] Am I just making this stuff up?

[17:44] Did that game get ported over to multi-morphic?

[17:49] I'm confused by that.

[17:51] I thought elemental was like the new game from pinball adventures.

[17:58] What was up?

[17:59] Anyone know?

[18:02] Or literally this isn't the same name as like the pinball adventures game, the second game.

[18:12] Elements is the pinball.

[18:14] So there's elements and elemental.

[18:19] Okay.

[18:21] You know, it's funny when when when Jerry does marketing.

[18:25] He's like the 26th game for multi-morphic.

[18:28] You notice that he's like the 26th game for the multi-morphic platform.

[18:31] 20 there's 26 games.

[18:34] Really?

[18:36] 26.

[18:40] I mean, was it elemental a new Disney movie?

[18:43] All right, it's a different theme.

[18:46] All right.

[18:47] Yeah, did anyone get a portal yet?

[18:50] Does anyone have portal?

[18:52] Anyone?

[18:57] I feel like I haven't seen a portal unboxing.

[19:02] I'm just curious.

[19:04] Is it ever going to happen?

[19:08] Pinball brothers making him and next without him.

[19:15] Oh, man.

[19:17] You know what license people are trying to get right now is I'm not going to say it.

[19:22] It's an nostalgic theme, but I know there's a little tug of war going on for it.

[19:27] You know, in the end, gang, here's how I feel about all of it.

[19:30] I don't care anymore about rumors.

[19:33] I have to be honest.

[19:34] I don't care anymore about rumors.

[19:36] Being first with a rumor anymore.

[19:38] It doesn't mean anything anymore.

[19:39] It doesn't matter.

[19:40] You know, top guns, Sonic, Super Mario, Pokemon.

[19:44] Who cares.

[19:45] I remember when the rumor mail was exciting.

[19:48] I remember when like being right about what was next was what drove.

[19:52] I don't think it drives like what makes the content interesting anymore.

[19:55] There's just too many.

[19:56] It's all the same.

[19:58] Nobody.

[20:00] Nobody's like leaking anything real.

[20:02] A real leak was when we had the leak of the Deadpool playfield before it was out.

[20:07] Or the Ghostbusters Translate was circulating around.

[20:10] Nowadays it's like everyone's just got the same 12 themes to be rumored.

[20:17] And then it takes forever to further games to come out.

[20:21] I think there's been no surprises.

[20:25] Like what was I was thinking about this this morning. What was the last time we were surprised?

[20:29] Like I didn't see that coming. I didn't I didn't you know that whoa like wow.

[20:36] When was like think I think about like when was the last time we were truly surprised by a pinball company move.

[20:49] No, we knew about Pulp Fiction. We knew Pulp Fiction was coming.

[20:55] That was not like we were like I think we may have been surprised that it was no LCD screen.

[21:05] You like how the Dune code is progressing. Yeah, well you know keep I look forward to playing it one day when it's progressed.

[21:13] As I said, I'm not I'm not in on these long journeys to get my money's worth.

[21:21] Yeah, maybe like the Harry Potter the way they the way they announced Harry Potter was a bit of surprise.

[21:30] I just think that when you when it comes to modern pinball marketing this whole.

[21:37] Let's release a game that's basically a beta version of the game and make everybody wait.

[21:43] It is not the way to go.

[21:46] I just I just haven't seen I think maybe Alice is adventures in Wonderland coming back might have been like one of the biggest surprises.

[21:57] Roses next.

[22:01] Roses going to have more less units.

[22:05] It's been reworked the ramp is even higher easier to hit and more rewarding.

[22:10] There's also like J pop left some magnets out of Raza when he did it a deep route that are going to be put back in.

[22:21] And I'll tell you this like Roses a much further coded game than Alice.

[22:31] But they're going to be.

[22:34] I mean it's kind of crazy you're going to be able to get Raza next to.

[22:39] I've seen I've seen pictures of magic girl in the in the new cabinet.

[22:45] It just doesn't look quite right magic girl needs to be have be in that deep zidware cabinet.

[22:54] Avengers from Stern was a surprise. I think look I think one of the biggest surprises gang incorrect me from wrong. I think one of the biggest surprises was.

[23:04] Getting Roy Schneider Schneider Schneider why I haven't slept getting all the assets into jaws.

[23:14] I think I think the last big surprise that paid out in dividends was getting Roy into that game and having all of the jaws assets.

[23:24] I think everybody thought they weren't going to get him as a state was impossible. You're going to play as him all this stuff.

[23:30] So I think getting all that in was a real surprise.

[23:35] And you know we know it's Star Wars then it's walking dead. I'm you know what I'm surprised by the lack of people listing their old walking dead for sale.

[23:46] I mean what do you know what I guess what do you do right.

[23:50] Unlike Star Wars which is a whole new game if you own the richy Star Wars you don't feel as compelled to dump it but if you own an old walking dead.

[24:00] I mean and as Gomez said that game is going to have the updated cabinet lighting.

[24:09] Yeah I do think jaws is a little bit of an underwhelming shooter though. I think it gets a little bit.

[24:18] I you know I wish there was more mechanical wow and jaws a lot more.

[24:23] I think it's kind of empty and I think jaws is one of those games where the people that believe that shots are the new toys sort of defend it.

[24:35] But yeah Derek I mean jaws 50th I keep telling people I think jaws 50th is going to be in the end.

[24:43] I think they will end up making less than a thousand of them and I think jaws 50th in the long term with a nicer playfield is going to end up being the more rare version of the game to have.

[24:58] Spooky making two pins one design actually work.

[25:02] Yeah there's a lot of Star Wars 2017 for sale now because there's I think people are holding I think what people were hoping for was it would be episode 123 and I'm confirming for you.

[25:19] I literally have a text message from someone who who work work that's turned during the development of it doesn't work there anymore and he's like it's the OG trilogy.

[25:31] So that's that like that's as much confirmation as I need.

[25:36] And they said it in a way that was like you're not going to believe it like they were kind of saying it sarcastically like like Stern's cheap for going back to the same well but it is what it is.

[25:47] Who is the designer from the new Star Wars is John Borg.

[25:53] I feel like Stern is greatly lower their customer base with the constant pricing of course they have Jason.

[25:58] You you you you lower in less customers when you raise the prices and look they're about to raise the prices again I think they've been nervous about this price increase for a while.

[26:08] I think they were considering it with King Kong I think they were considering the bigger screen with King Kong.

[26:13] I think they made a smart decision to pause.

[26:17] I mean Kong's not selling as it is we would do even worse with the price increase.

[26:22] Kong is the new Avengers it is I actually think Avengers shoots more interesting than Kong.

[26:30] I think Kong is just it's just not clicking with people.

[26:34] And what I love about Kong Apologist is the people that bought it you got it's it's funny hearing them try to defend it and like so great you know you know you know we don't care.

[26:44] Hey Kong is one of those games where I'm sure it's going to be fun.

[26:50] And it's going to be a heck of a lot of fun buying an Ellie if it if it does turn out to be one of the best games Stern has made.

[26:56] It's going to be a heck of a lot of fun to own one at 8500 for an Ellie the reason why Kong will never truly excite.

[27:05] It goes beyond just the thank you for the stars Bill Brandis we're still doing this.

[27:12] Billy I appreciate it.

[27:14] Thank you.

[27:15] The reason why Kong will also never hold any value is they made every version look the same and that was like the dumbest move ever.

[27:25] And what I don't get about why they did it that way what what happened like what what were they rushing the art package I mean zombie Eddie did it like is on too much.

[27:33] Mister reason no need to defend Kong the code that just dropped as a huge indicator for well where where will it end up Mister Mister reason where will Kong end up that's going to prove all of us wrong like what we're all going to get goosebumps because we're watching some.

[27:53] CGI animated King Kong throw around the subway car I don't understand where the emotional.

[28:01] Energy is going to come from in that game.

[28:06] Thank you Kelly the last show is a lot of fun.

[28:11] Back to the future gang I mean I you're going to be weighed into the end of the year.

[28:17] You have to remember Dutch pinballs accompany that's made one game in 12 years.

[28:21] They did not develop Alice's adventures in Wonderland Melvin did that in one year.

[28:27] My worry about Barry is Barry being Barry you know I'm saying like he's slow.

[28:35] He's slow they're not quick like look how slow I mean Melvin handed him a game that was ready to be made and look how slow it's been.

[28:45] Getting the game on the line for Alice.

[28:48] The they don't have a.

[28:51] I just want to say this to they don't have this is information as.

[28:57] Recent as today they have not.

[29:00] They have not replaced the vendor.

[29:04] For the top or yet so I know Melissa said oh yeah the new game shit no no no no no no no Melissa's getting some games that have the original top or.

[29:13] But they they don't have a replacement vendor lined up.

[29:18] I think the old vendor might still be making some two he's just closing up shop.

[29:26] Jason said I need to add I don't feel like all of their price increases were material based I know Jason they none of them were material based.

[29:37] I think they they adjusted their prices because they saw the second hand market that was happening during covid.

[29:44] This is not like this turned it not like juice its bomb up 40% while at the same time raising the price by 40%.

[29:52] Please do get to the chopper alright alright.

[29:55] I don't know if they're going to go out fighting.

[30:15] They're going to go out paying for tariffs to save the crew.

[30:19] But they're not I don't think they survived this.

[30:22] I don't hope they go out of business.

[30:25] But I don't think they survived this I think they took I think they took a huge gamble and it didn't pay off.

[30:30] I don't think it works.

[30:33] You know I would love to get his point of view on this you know maybe he pops in here today.

[30:38] Retro Ralph ain't going to pop in here.

[30:41] I think my my indictment of the arcade one of content creators might have stung too deep.

[30:48] I was pretty mean I would be honest I was mean I think anyone who started in arcade channel because they wanted to review arcade one ups think about that.

[30:59] You know like you know like talk about an item that like like fizzled out real quick.

[31:11] I mean those guys like they like you know they thought they were like in the cool kid club for a while because yeah I mean everyone just started and then and then when people have massed these collections.

[31:25] They looked at their game room and realized they made a terrible mistake.

[31:30] They made a terrible mistake because collecting arcade one ups is the equivalent of collecting fake Rolexes.

[31:40] These are fake versions of something everybody knows and loves fake it's fake it's garbage.

[31:48] You can play Street Fighter on arcade one up and then and then the saddest part is when these dudes were adding those like bases to them you know to like make them higher so they could play as an adult I get that if you want if your kid wants to play the games you grew up with cool but don't start up don't don't start a whole community around it as a grown adult like no like if kids were the ones driving the arcade one up content I'd be like that makes sense.

[32:14] But for these grown men to be like that's what they were all about like and you gotta remember gang like stern pinball when and got these guys to then go make pinball content like they weren't gonna do it unless stern recognize what we've got these guys with tens of thousands of followers you know and they're not covering pinball but they're gamers because if you gotta think about it like this.

[32:43] Who's the most susceptible.

[32:48] Who's the most vulnerable right to bending their mind to becoming a sales shale for you if you're a stern like you know I'm saying like what what what community of grown men could we could we like take over and get them to create advertisements for us.

[33:11] You know what I'm saying like I think arcade one up guys are where we should go because these dudes think everything is awesome if they're shilling that you know and like I would never.

[33:26] What's up kill.

[33:28] Oh kills in here hold on.

[33:31] Kill come on go go back in with three.

[33:34] Kill kill.

[33:38] I'm pretending to drive.

[33:41] Pretending that drives.

[33:44] But look it's it's funny to because it's not just that they entered into the pinball space.

[33:51] It's not that they entered into the pinball space is that they they they tried to sell us on a narrative that they've always been in the pinball.

[34:00] So what happened you just decided now is the time because you got invites to the manufacturers.

[34:12] You know your and your first invite was all expense paid trip and then they hooked you so much that now you're paying for your own travel to go to these companies to make sales content for them.

[34:23] Can you don't do that.

[34:25] Can you to got flown out to see Avatar and I said I wouldn't buy it.

[34:29] Guess what still friends with all the people at JJP.

[34:40] Kill come on go breeze going to be a little nervous where you are.

[34:46] I was watching him.

[34:49] Yeah one did get out bill absolutely.

[34:53] And that's it you know one of collectors.

[34:58] The thing about pinball.

[35:00] You know they always wished.

[35:03] That you know I think sometimes people question me as a gamer now you can absolutely question my pinball skills.

[35:09] I'm like an average pinball player.

[35:12] I'm like I'm average like I my weakness in pinball is is that I don't like to nudge or like throw a machine around it's just something about it makes me feel.

[35:24] But it's like it's important you know and I know like the you know hitting the lockdown bar nudging that way is important and I sometimes just tend to watch a ball go into the out lane without much movement of the machine.

[35:37] I think the best games are the ones that like don't have cheap drains you know some games just really cheap drains and you're always nudging like I think you are is a lot of cheap drains I think the games of drain monster.

[35:50] But I will say this if you are real gamer and I mean this who grew up in the 80s and 90s you're good at street fighter.

[36:00] And you probably chose street fighter or mortal combat so you know I would love to play all all those guys in street fighter to champion addition or turbo and we should play for like whoever wins the other person asked to like shut their showdown for a month because I'll clean the floor with all of them in street fighter.

[36:19] I will I will use guy and they won't even I will never jump with him they will never get they will never get around off of me right you know and that's that's how I grew up right and that's what arcade culture was Daytona USA same thing I know how to drive that game like like no tomorrow now look.

[36:40] But look at all on kill you come on kill me I got a show you're not supposed to be in there come on where's the.

[36:50] Here come on we're gonna get lunch later on you fuck with yourself in okay one.

[36:58] Say hi real quick say hi hi hi baby say.

[37:03] Oh yeah.

[37:05] Oh yeah.

[37:08] Oh yeah.

[37:10] Let's do that.

[37:14] Yeah I'm going to show.

[37:17] All right.

[37:18] That's all right.

[37:24] You don't have to teach again.

[37:27] You know Brenda's away so like my goal was I don't know if you've seen the Seth Rogen show the studio it's absolutely amazing so I'm just I want to just teach him to say oh yeah like the cool aid man so that when Brenda comes back like I trained him to always make his affirmative response to be oh yeah.

[37:49] Oh yeah.

[37:52] I want to run it for you but go watch the studio I think it's one of the best comedies I've seen in many many years it is so funny and the cast is amazing the writing is amazing it is some of the best comedy on TV.

[38:09] Oh yeah it's not much of an oh yeah though it's cool they got.

[38:16] Now I Honda can't go near guy in turbo e Honda only.

[38:26] I Honda maybe in the one where you could torpedo through the sonic boom but you know see real street fighter guys know this and kill will know this.

[38:37] That in street fighter to before champion additions remember what the game was like you could only select you could not select the same character as your opponent.

[38:47] And so street fighter to like changed everything right but if someone picked guy you couldn't pick guy and that's what made champion additions so epic was you could go player versus player for the first time now what everybody knows about the original street fighter to is this.

[39:04] In the end the only two characters that really could survive a good competition was guy versus dalsim.

[39:14] Guy versus dalsim was always the match up those two guys could easily beat rai you can like you just couldn't you couldn't get past like dalsim long kicks because remember in the original street fighter to.

[39:30] You couldn't block when you jumped in the air okay and that was a huge issue for characters that had projectiles and long legs because what would always happen is only when you jumped into guy you could charge that sonic boom you know that sonic kick the flash kick and you would just get you.

[39:50] So it was always like a stalemate between dalsim and guy and it and it memory serves me correct it would usually end up in a in a time out and that's why champion addition like solve that problem.

[40:06] Oh man long okay has everybody doing remember how the original street fighter had giant oh yeah the big buttons like this one and that's when you had like.

[40:16] I mean the first street fighter do you guys know the story of this like the first street fighter there's a really interesting history about cap con versus snk and how.

[40:29] You know I believe the guy that was involved in street fighter one went over to snk to like kickstart their fighting genre and the whole thing was like what was revolutionary about street fighter is it gave a backstory and storylines to these characters.

[40:51] And so that was like never heard of before and so snk then came out with I want to say fatal fury that was like the first snk neo geo fighting game that went all in on like the storyline but then when street fighter two came out it was just capcom just had the better.

[41:13] The better controls the better gameplay if you will much like pinball the better gameplay the more you're going to win more fun.

[41:22] I was never a mortal combat guy because I just couldn't get into using the block button as a.

[41:29] As something the game I was great at the fighting games I mastered was X-Men when the X-Men game first came out.

[41:40] And and Cyclock I Cyclock I she just I could kill anybody with her and that's the one where like a kuma was hidden inside the game and then killer instinct I was amazing with orchid like I knew all of orchids moves all the crazy killer combos everything I don't remember them now but it was it was so when killer instinct came out that was like badass anyway now tech in not so much like virtual fighter not so much.

[42:09] I mean I love that the guy's name was a cure.

[42:12] Kill what's up kill let me ask you a question kill how have your how have your conversations to create a detente between canators pinball podcast and retro rob how they gone because I know you're in communication with Ralph and you know we're checking in weekly.

[42:28] We care about him we want to make sure he comes back to the to the NWO and is having fun with us at expo so how have how have your conversations gone kill have you been successful.

[42:38] And breaking through the the heart exterior of this grown man who's into gaming just like the rest of us as is he still is he still like did you see Colin now is saying like for peace of mind he call and saying he put the story about me behind the paywall because he wanted to make sure only people with intent ready because he didn't want to get into the same.

[43:01] Stress levels of route like what he saw what canator did to Ralph and he wanted to avoid that so he put his story behind a paywall does that make any sense.

[43:11] Who needs a paywall I'm a jackass I take the piss out of things I'm sarcastic I'm so silly and I'll make fun of you make fun of me you know like it doesn't have to be so serious you know if I if I say I'm going to out you for getting paid in a pimo machine so what let me out you.

[43:30] Let me out you.

[43:33] Who cares you deserve and I keep saying you deserve to make money deserve to get paid for making content I never said it was a bad thing.

[43:41] It's just funny to me it's like they're still holding on holding on holding on you know when Kellen I roll through expo we're going to be like hauling Nash baby it's going to be like the NWO the bad boys of pinball we're rolling through there Rachel can be like Miss Elizabeth we've got Melvin Williams from deep.

[43:59] We're all going to be wearing like feda boas you know I got my house to Gucci code on I'm going to be looking at bill brand is being like this dude makes more and one day than I make all month I'm dressed like I got more money than bill but I don't I'm just pretending you know how it is I'm pretending.

[44:19] It's fun I know exactly what I'm worth I know exactly what I make I know exactly how much money I have now I can afford all these clothes is isn't like I'm I have no debt other than like a little more good you know but I have more money and assets than my debts and I also don't carry credit card debt.

[44:37] So I pay my credit card off right away I don't like float it over I don't pay interest on stuff I'm not I'm not like that I just want the points because I want to go to Japan.

[44:47] I will not be wearing socks to expel you I never wear socks guys like I don't even own socks like I don't even know what that means I whenever I wear a tuxedo I never wear socks.

[44:56] You don't wear socks with velvet slippers that say screw you on them from stubs in whatever.

[45:04] Oh God reminds me when don't dress up no no no no no no well you know like look I wouldn't dress up like wonka I don't understand that like I don't it's weird to like turn your thing over into a into like a salesy like like to help like selling these companies products like you guys.

[45:33] There's got to be a little bit of having some like pride in your own content that you're not going to turn your channel over.

[45:43] I imagine saw like Ralph is like he's like promoting Harry Potter donuts it's like we've come it's come to this.

[45:52] It's come to this like so every time there's a Harry Potter anything or anything or you go enjoy your pimp on with your Harry Potter.

[45:59] I don't know like maybe sure why I don't I wouldn't do it no I don't wear socks to the gym I don't wear socks with sneakers I don't wear socks.

[46:11] That's the Italian way Italians don't wear socks guys when you when you when you wear I get you can wear like those low cut socks you don't see I don't wear them.

[46:26] I don't know my feet don't really stink.

[46:30] Who knows who knew that right.

[46:33] Oh man alright so like let's see let's go back to some of these pinball topics for those of you who joined late.

[46:39] We already debunked it there's no way that pinball brothers sold 650 predators we all know that they probably sold 100 to 150 that's why there's 150 left because they're only going to make 300.

[46:55] And yeah I wear socks in my underwear.

[46:59] Yeah I hope so taking parents to Tokyo next spring and jumping a boat to the sea the rest of.

[47:06] Yeah so I've been the bill we should maybe coordinate because I'm going next year to for my my my 50th birthday so maybe we can we could sync up.

[47:16] No no better trip than that I always tell people like instead of buying a 15,000 on a pinball machine if you've never been the Tokyo.

[47:24] Go go in your young.

[47:28] My parents won't even go to Mohican sons which is like an hour from them they they're they're not going to Tokyo my dad said he will never get on a plane for the rest of his life.

[47:36] He got on a plane his whole life traveling he's like I'm never doing it again.

[47:41] He he won't do it my mom won't even like I literally I think they're going to Mohican sons next week and it was like pulling teeth to get them there.

[47:52] They they like being.

[47:55] Sort of in their town they're very stationary and you know I'm not going to force them they're never going to go to Japan never my dad my dad used to go for work.

[48:05] How's everybody doing but go.

[48:09] I think I think it'd be wise if everybody took money you're going to spend on a pinball machine and did an adventure that got you out of your comfort zone because if you think about all of us.

[48:20] You know you could take the money and go buy another thing of something you've already got too many of to begin with or you could actually take the money and go have a life altering experience.

[48:30] You know when we're dead we're dead forever.

[48:33] You guys know this concept right when we're dead we're dead forever nobody on your deathbed.

[48:39] Even as you get older and you can't travel as much nobody's going to be like I wish I bought more pinball when I was in my 40s and 50s.

[48:45] I wish I really you know I'm glad I used all those hours to uncover the new D&D code instead of like hanging out with friends and family and making new connections you're not going to.

[48:57] I actually I'm going to say this is a little bit controversial.

[49:01] I think spending too many hours playing pinball is kind of not a great use of time.

[49:06] I just don't.

[49:08] I don't think pinball was ever designed to be something that should be 30 minute games 40 minute games I don't think pinball was designed to be something that takes like a year to beat I don't think that's what it's about I don't.

[49:20] I think modern pinball is turned into that and I think for some people like you kind of need that sort of.

[49:26] Like like length to games to justify the extreme cost of the machines but I don't know I think I think it's become a little bit more like a role playing game and less like a pinball machine.

[49:40] The pinball treadmill my brother in law in hospital 62 years old terminal for yeah see Wayne I mean.

[49:50] Yeah I mean of course though I don't think your parents are not flying first class go air Japan though if you're going to go to Japan.

[49:56] The first class in air Japan is just is insane.

[50:02] Um.

[50:04] Some way.

[50:06] Anyway what do you guys want to talk about was like we have 799 stars sad boys been the only one hitting up I don't know where Pete rose in that I'm a little tired as you guys can tell I've been.

[50:17] I think any sleep last night is the two boys.

[50:21] I you know burto I love that sell to pins restore an old 5 oh Mustang with your boys that's that's that's that's living man.

[50:32] You know working on this new campaign for Corona and it's all about like what what is living is living really.

[50:40] You know staying up late at night having 15 pinball machines and staring down staring down at a box of lights that you already have like eight other games nine other games.

[50:55] I believe in balance and I think I think most of you understand that you know I'm not here to you you know this like you know you don't need another game you know.

[51:05] On a beautiful sunny day like the last thing you should be doing is inside like exploring that new dnd code and the new trinkets that give you a little bit more money to buy who cares about any of this right it's just.

[51:18] It's funny to me it's funny to me I think pinball.

[51:22] I think I think we're at a pinball crossroads I do I think certain.

[51:25] Certain games are going to really connect with us and click emotionally and I think the rest of them are going to be discarded.

[51:32] I think I still think we're going to see some of the best pinball we've ever seen in the next three years and I also think we're going to see more pinball companies close in the next three years and we've seen the last 10 years.

[51:43] And it's pretty clear who's who's moving in the right direction and who's not.

[51:48] What older pin under 5k would you recommend it's a good question under 5k.

[51:58] You know it's hard now because like I feel like everybody.

[52:04] There's two things what what you define my older and it's like nobody wants to list anything for below 5k now.

[52:13] I think there's lots of Stern pros that are 5k or less that I would really consider they're not older though.

[52:21] If you want to go Valley Williams you know people are saying t2 get away to.

[52:30] Yeah you know I the problem is with some of those older games.

[52:36] I wouldn't want to own them and I don't think you'd want to own them.

[52:41] I do think the sweet spot would be.

[52:45] You know something like a.

[52:48] Like a star Trek pro you know the Steve Richie game or like an AC DC pro.

[52:54] I think that would be like a good game to have.

[52:59] happened to have crit ignore and word truck making this.

[53:09] What do you think I mean I do you look at more than what you do in any game because if I don't really like it it slides down and clicks it says intimidating slits,

[53:16] 權 from the market particularly a product process.

[53:24] And I exactly I think that living in a stream of企hey There's a lot reogumار Web好好 very much.

[55:26] a week away from two weeks away from star wars i don't think we're going to see

[55:29] it next week

[55:31] i think sirin's gonna hold it to early september i think just

[55:35] august with everybody traveling and vacations

[55:38] it's not the smartest time to release star wars but there's you know how i

[55:42] feel there's never a bad time to release a great game

[55:46] and there's never a good time to release a bad game

[55:50] anywhere than what's in the so i heard the new star wars is

[55:53] sort of uh... designed as a follow-up to the data east game it's it's sort of

[55:59] like

[56:00] attribute to that game and where the big r2d2 is

[56:03] is going to be a big

[56:05] adat walker

[56:07] so that's what i heard is in this game

[56:09] so you know you're gonna look down and see star wars

[56:14] so

[56:15] i don't know i think board might have just taken his old design and just

[56:19] modernized it

[56:21] he could have completely changed again i haven't seen it so like everything i'm

[56:24] saying is just kind of what i'm hearing through the rumor mill

[56:27] but i do

[56:28] i am hearing that where where r2 was is a big adat walker

[56:34] yet gain the spooky game is sold out i got my order in

[56:38] i got a star what i got i got an order in for star wars heli

[56:44] what was the haggis rumor you posted that key though when was going to haggis

[56:47] so the real i was making fun of the rumor that key though and

[56:50] is going to jersey jack

[56:53] uh...

[56:54] here

[56:55] i'm going to speak

[56:58] broadly and lightly about this but i heard the rumor

[57:02] is that working at stern has become a bit of a grind and

[57:07] it's become a little bit of a toxic work environment

[57:11] and so

[57:13] who knows where key fell and might go if he's tired of it if key fell and went

[57:17] to jersey jack

[57:20] uh... that would absolutely

[57:23] be devastating to stern i think stern knows that i think they would

[57:29] throw

[57:31] anything they could add him the problem is

[57:35] they could never throw as much as

[57:37] Leonard could

[57:40] i mean Leonard could buy stern tomorrow and he wouldn't really feel it

[57:43] i know how much stern was um...

[57:45] was asking for sale i know what the number was

[57:49] it's not as much as you think considering

[57:53] you know what are the annual revenue on stern this is not profit but just

[57:57] revenue somewhere in the you i mean in the height i think it was in the

[58:00] vicinity of like fifty to sixty million a year

[58:03] was revenue that's not operating costs that's not profit that's like what

[58:06] they were generating

[58:09] and i think jersey jack

[58:14] is not you know i don't think the abba's family's interested in buying

[58:16] stern i think they're interested in this you know beating stern

[58:22] and i think that's the way it's going to go

[58:26] well you know tom caper going over there was big

[58:30] i do get a sense that the jersey jack culture is not nearly as stressful

[58:35] did you talk about the new p3 elemental

[58:39] uh... chat i i did not because if i start talking about p3 games i fear my

[58:44] audience would exit immediately

[58:50] um

[58:51] was that this again

[58:53] what's going on elemental

[58:55] o8

[58:56] you ralf and i don't know what this guy's talking about

[59:01] uh... like i think that um

[59:05] i think jack danger needed a break

[59:08] i don't know the details um... i i just imagine

[59:12] that working at stern is very stressful

[59:15] i imagine that

[59:19] you get too close to the sun and it does doesn't become

[59:23] nearly as much fun as you think

[59:25] and it does become a job

[59:28] and you are

[59:29] like destroying your your family life to get a game to market on time

[59:34] or ahead of time like jack had to

[59:37] and it's not worth it like you love your wife you love your kids you're not

[59:41] making millions like

[59:43] and these men who are

[59:44] pushing you to

[59:46] to hit these deadlines

[59:48] probably in a lot of a lot of times are like

[59:51] unfair deadlines

[59:53] you know

[59:55] like

[59:56] they've they've already made their money they they it's it's probably pretty

[01:00:00] tough

[01:00:03] i can't imagine they've sold a hundred portals

[01:00:07] they're they're very expensive there's not i don't know how many i think

[01:00:10] jerry was telling people there's like seven hundred and fifty

[01:00:13] multi morphings out there in the world i i don't i don't know i i i just

[01:00:17] i don't believe that

[01:00:19] but i also can

[01:00:21] like contested i don't know i it doesn't feel like eight hundred people

[01:00:25] every time there's a new

[01:00:27] uh... multi morphing game are unboxing the games just doesn't feel like that

[01:00:35] unless they've got some like

[01:00:37] hidden

[01:00:38] scientology bought like seven hundred of them like i don't know like you know

[01:00:43] who's who's like where were all these owners are

[01:00:47] i i i also just like it's it's hard for me you know that i always feel

[01:00:50] like jerry could have just had like one of the best people companies in the

[01:00:53] world by now

[01:00:55] and he created a solution in search of a problem

[01:00:59] and everybody knows that

[01:01:01] he's a nice guy he's got good tech he's smart he just needed a creative director

[01:01:05] that had more common sense

[01:01:07] and that's that

[01:01:08] it's again it's it was his decision he's comfortable with it he sleeps at night

[01:01:12] he wanted his company to be that it's not how i would have done a pinball

[01:01:15] company

[01:01:17] uh... and you know in the end of the day spooky is going to make millions more

[01:01:21] and jerry's never gonna

[01:01:22] he's never gonna get to that tipping point where

[01:01:25] he's got the only way jerry's model works is if the platform itself is a

[01:01:30] lost leader

[01:01:32] so he needs to sell the platform for three thousand dollars and then charge you

[01:01:34] three thousand per game

[01:01:36] but you can't sell the platform for twelve the fifteen thousand dollars that

[01:01:39] that doesn't work

[01:01:43] uh... are people really not sure that it's be the use of me we've been saying

[01:01:46] be told you's now every day for like a year and a half

[01:01:50] it's either be told you

[01:01:52] or grandma's

[01:01:53] orgunes

[01:01:55] or motorhead now it's it's be told you

[01:02:02] big trouble little china is currently on you to premium

[01:02:08] what the hell

[01:02:11] anyway carry what's up buddy

[01:02:13] carry it

[01:02:15] you know carry

[01:02:16] carry and i are probably feel in the same thing a little bit

[01:02:19] the uh... the news is lacking

[01:02:22] are subscribers have gone down a little bit

[01:02:25] uh... you know this over saturation is not enough to talk about and like

[01:02:30] i i just feel like the rumor businesses now like it's it's not even where it's

[01:02:33] at it's about

[01:02:34] how well can you entertain

[01:02:36] how well can you talk in real time about

[01:02:39] what's going on in the community and that's why like

[01:02:42] can you just been about podcast is always been i i i love doing the show every

[01:02:45] week because

[01:02:46] it is because imagine if all you want to talk about is gameplay or like

[01:02:49] torn them in sort of like it's boring like

[01:02:53] what i want to talk about is like what's happening in the community like this

[01:02:56] week in the community was

[01:02:58] the pimp up brothers trying to create foamo around predator right that that

[01:03:02] like that was a really interesting marketing move

[01:03:04] we saw right through it

[01:03:06] led to one of my most entertaining shows ever yesterday if you haven't heard

[01:03:09] it's free you can watch it on Facebook live or you could

[01:03:13] listen to it on patreon you don't even need a login you don't need an account

[01:03:22] uh... Albert man i just

[01:03:25] Albert at the end of it all

[01:03:27] uh...

[01:03:29] no regrets like not

[01:03:32] asking for a book here there

[01:03:36] i mean i don't

[01:03:40] it's uh... it's i don't make a lot of money

[01:03:42] but you know time value money so what's more something better than nothing

[01:03:52] i think we've kind of like i don't think a lot more people are going to be

[01:03:55] coming into pimp although

[01:03:57] and you know like like let me explain like i don't think like harry potters

[01:04:01] gonna bring in a thousand more potential pimp up iris and i don't

[01:04:05] i don't think pokemon's gonna do it

[01:04:08] i i don't i i think

[01:04:10] we're very lucky that we're in this like little bubble of like the economy

[01:04:14] still

[01:04:15] doing pretty well right s and p high says ever been

[01:04:19] like none of that recession hit like none of the

[01:04:21] but if it does get bad

[01:04:23] economically

[01:04:26] that's what will create

[01:04:28] a uh... a really rough go and and oh i love it

[01:04:32] look five hundred and you can put stuff on my face i actually would

[01:04:36] i would walk around like this all day long

[01:04:37] i'd be like i'm not buying predator

[01:04:40] as a

[01:04:41] pink

[01:04:41] dog

[01:04:44] a frenchy
