[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:17] It's one o'clock in the morning here so I'm going to have to be a little bit quiet as everybody

[00:21] sleeps in the Casa de Canada.

[00:24] So Godzilla 70th anniversary, Stern did exactly what I think they were going to do.

[00:32] They released a game and I know there's been a lot of debate, I know there's been a lot

[00:35] of back and forth and it is very subjective but I'm going to give you my opinion on this

[00:41] game.

[00:42] I'm looking at it right now, I'm looking at it next to the full color version that Zambietti

[00:47] put out there.

[00:48] I mean this is Zambietti too, it's just in black and white and I'm looking at the Godzilla

[00:53] name in red, Japanese lettering, a throwback if you will to the old Godzilla movie posters

[01:01] that had his name in red and I must say, you know, it's just so different that I freaking

[01:08] love it.

[01:09] I absolutely love this version of Godzilla and you could tell like when George Gomez

[01:15] is doing this Stern video, it's so obvious that when the inception of this game happened

[01:22] over at Stern Pinball, they wanted to make this a 500 version limited edition of the

[01:30] game.

[01:31] They so did, I mean they gave it the foil decals, they went the extra mile by making all the

[01:38] mechs and everything in the game, the Godzilla figure, everything in the game is black and

[01:44] white except for the name Godzilla, like it's really freaking cool.

[01:49] I love it, I love like every angle I see this game and it's interesting when I'm looking

[01:54] at the feedback because it's very polarizing, I mean some people love it, some people hate

[02:00] it, some people think this is indicative of Stern being in trouble and yes, John Wick

[02:05] sales are abysmal, we're now starting to see John Wick Ellie's sell for like $10,500 but

[02:13] here's the thing when I look at this Godzilla black and white edition for $9,600.

[02:19] Remember that everybody that bought a Godzilla Ellie, they bought that game for $10,500, like

[02:26] it was the last well priced Stern Ellie ever and so the game has been out for three years

[02:34] now and it is arguably maybe Stern's best pinball machine of all time.

[02:40] It is ranked number one on the pinside top 100 and they've sold thousands of Godzilla

[02:48] machines and the reason why I think there's a lot of hate and I mean this, there's a lot

[02:54] of hate towards this version of Godzilla is that if you have one, you're never going to

[03:01] admit that this is nicer than the game you have and I think so many people are reluctant

[03:07] to do that because it's just a little bit upsetting because you know you have your game,

[03:13] you love your game, you've probably enjoyed it for three years and I think for a lot of

[03:17] people Godzilla is a keeper because it's so damn good and now they've made this version

[03:25] which I think again this is just me and it is subjective, I think this is the nicest

[03:30] version of the game and did you hear what George Gomez said?

[03:34] You're going to make accessories that go specifically for this black and white version

[03:40] of the game so a black and white topper, black and white inner art blades and I wish they

[03:45] would just install these inner art blades at the factory because it's 10,000 times easier

[03:52] if they do it when they make the game versus asking us to do it after the game has been

[03:57] sent to us but if they make all of these accessory lines for this game I think it's going to

[04:03] look even better and I mean this I haven't felt this way about a stern machine in a while

[04:09] but seeing this game today really made me want one and it's interesting right when George

[04:15] Gomez was doing the video he must have said the word premium like 18 times and reminded

[04:22] everybody that we're going to make this game as long as there's demand and that's another

[04:29] really interesting thing about today because this is really new territory for stern.

[04:35] Normally they would release a game like this and it would be in LE like Jurassic Park LE

[04:42] version number two when they made the 30th anniversary of Jurassic Park and those were

[04:47] like 500 units at $13,000 and that is what they wanted to do with this and I bet you

[04:56] in the boardroom at Stern knowing how popular Godzilla is that they probably wanted to for

[05:04] the 70th anniversary of Godzilla make 700 black and white additions to commemorate this property,

[05:14] this game and this iconic franchise celebrating 70 years and now they can't because they

[05:21] pissed off everybody with the way they did Jurassic Park with what they did with Elvira

[05:27] and all those variations and so here we are now this new territory for stern making these

[05:34] nice new unique versions of games as premiums. Now I think the closest to this might be something

[05:42] like the Star Wars comic book edition remember that because that was not limited but it was

[05:47] a nicer version of Star Wars that came later on in the run and even that game is hard to get

[05:54] because again a lot of people bought the regular version and you know you've got over three years

[06:00] of people buying all these Godzilla's and not just that because Godzilla is such a popular game

[06:07] so many people out there invested in a lot of mods and made their games uniquely amazing to the way

[06:16] they wanted them and now you've got this new version and so what's amazing for the Godzilla

[06:23] mod makers and you know who they are they're looking at this thing like awesome I'm gonna make

[06:29] black and white versions of all the mods I've made for Godzilla and I think when you see this

[06:36] black and white version with all the mods that are out there with the topper on it with the shooter

[06:42] rod with the armor with everything that makes Godzilla amazing and when you see it in black and

[06:48] white and you put it next to the super colorful original version that Yeti did I think this is

[06:55] gonna be the one that pops the most and the reason why it's gonna stand out the most is like you

[07:01] know it's nothing against Yeti but all of those games and all the colorful stern games in your

[07:06] lineup they all sort of blend together and so when you put something so unique like this it

[07:13] really stands out and it totally makes sense for the theme there's not many stern games out there

[07:19] where it would make sense for them to do a black and white version I also heard that they're gonna

[07:25] have it so all the code in the clips will be in black and white or you could change them to color

[07:30] like that's super cool they also announced that they're gonna have like the king of the monsters

[07:35] mode but that also came out when they released the Godzilla top or nothing new really there but I am

[07:41] curious now like what the response to this game will be I mean I have not seen a lot of older

[07:49] Godzilla's go up for sale and I think that's just indicative of people pushing against this move

[07:56] from stern like I'm not gonna sell my old machine and lose a few thousand dollars to get this new

[08:02] one and that makes sense you know because if you love Godzilla and you have Godzilla and you're

[08:07] enjoying Godzilla are you really gonna try to sell your game do you really want to start over on

[08:14] the Godzilla journey three years after having the game and I think for most people the answers

[08:20] easily know this game is meant to attract new people to the Godzilla game it's a great game to

[08:26] attract new people if you're a newbie in pinball and you walked into pinball today the fact that you

[08:31] can get this Godzilla for 9600 is pretty awesome because remember during COVID people were spending

[08:39] like 18 thousand dollars on Godzilla at least even the premiums were going for well over like

[08:46] 12 thousand dollars I mean those days are long gone so it's nice that you're gonna have something

[08:52] different and the price is not terrible and the other reason I like this sort of like 9600

[08:58] Godzilla black and white edition yeah the reason I like it too is there's only one version of it

[09:05] like there's just a premium like there's nothing else that's gonna come out that's gonna like be

[09:11] too similar to this that's gonna make this thing feel obsolete so great 70th anniversary of Godzilla

[09:19] but here's the other thing I was thinking about this has to make people somewhat nervous that

[09:26] they're gonna make a 50th anniversary premium of Jaws you know they might be making a 40th anniversary

[09:34] of Ghostbusters a 40th anniversary of Metallica see I don't think Stern's strategy of oversaturating

[09:44] the market with their iconic titles is gonna change they're just not gonna be able to release these

[09:50] things as le's and it's gonna be very interesting I'm not sure what's gonna happen I don't know if

[09:58] games like this Godzilla black and white are gonna be met with open arms I don't know you know as

[10:05] someone who only owns one pin right now I kind of find this stuff somewhat exciting because nothing

[10:11] they do right now is gonna upset me you know I'm kind of glad I got rid of my Batman SLE because

[10:17] I'm also worried that they're probably gonna make a 60th anniversary of that game and then what

[10:24] happens right if they put the topper back on it and they do something new with the artwork you

[10:29] know it's just all these variations are coming and I think now we know that you sort of should just

[10:36] buy a stern machine because you love it there's always gonna be a chance down the road they're

[10:41] gonna make another version now in a premium format there is always a good chance that they're gonna

[10:47] make a nicer version of the game that might be nicer than your le and they might just call it a

[10:55] premium I think Seth Davis has destroyed the collectability of stern and it's like no longer

[11:03] about collecting because they really have turned their back on the collectors on what made collecting

[11:10] a stern so much fun and that was the other thing about today that was weird all throughout the 10

[11:16] years I've been covering this industry a game that was launched like this if they launched it the way

[11:23] they wanted to this is the kind of game that would have sold out in one day but now because it's

[11:30] unlimited and George is emphasizing we're gonna make these as long as there's demand it gets really

[11:39] interesting because I also think stern is gonna start to do some sleazy things I think they're

[11:44] gonna start to say like well this is the final run of this make of Godzilla black and white I think

[11:51] they're gonna start to create like FOMO about getting in on this run of the game now here's the

[11:58] problem I think they're gonna do stuff like that to sell X amount of games right now and then when

[12:03] they sell all those games they're gonna be like congratulations due to strong demand we're doing

[12:08] another run another run I mean ostensibly now they could make this Godzilla black and white

[12:14] for the next 10 years there is no FOMO like there's no reason why you would need to go get it now

[12:21] and that's unique right it really is unique we're not used to stern doing this I think

[12:27] Seth Davis and George have really underestimated and should have been more protective and careful

[12:35] with how their company appeals to the collector audience and now I think they've sort of painted

[12:41] themselves into a weird corner they had all this great ability to make collectible versions of the

[12:47] games but they didn't really think it through and now they overdid it and now they can't go back

[12:54] and that's really not where you want to be and it's not where they want it to be but the distributors

[13:00] spoke to them and forced them into this predicament because the distributors were listening to the

[13:05] customers and you had all of these customers that were just angry you pissed off the Jurassic Park

[13:11] people you pissed off the Elvira people and you were gonna do it to your Godzilla LE owners so they

[13:17] found this weird middle ground and we'll see the way the market responds to it but you know

[13:22] canada is a huge fan of this version of the game I think it looks phenomenal I think it looks great

[13:27] I think there's a lot of people that just want to say it doesn't look great because they don't want

[13:31] to trade up for it but if this thing were available on day one remember all the criticisms on day one

[13:37] of it being too colorful this and that I think this erases a lot of that and makes this look more like

[13:43] the original Godzilla and the original Godzilla movies that everybody loves but look stern does it

[13:50] again right they just keep making stuff nobody else is doing stuff stern just keeps doing things I

[13:56] mean they've got John Wick failing dead on arrival and now they need to keep the line going okay we'll

[14:01] make more of Godzilla's we need to keep the line going okay we'll make more Metallica's there's no

[14:06] other company that can do this there's no other company that has the ability to pivot and put

[14:11] something else on the line so quickly and I think when we start to see unboxings of this new black

[14:16] and white Godzilla they're gonna get more orders and it's not the kind of game you're gonna have to

[14:21] wait years on you're not gonna have to wait that long to get it it's gonna be available here and now

[14:27] and that's why stern keeps winning and no one else can do it like this absolutely nobody else can do

[14:33] it like this so I look forward to seeing the way people respond to this everyone's opening up their

[14:38] mouth and giving their opinion about this game will people open up their wallets and buy this game

[14:44] you know in the context of how expensive everything is you know it's crazy right I'd rather have a

[14:51] ninety six hundred dollar black and white Godzilla than a fifteen thousand dollar Elton John

[14:59] collector's edition it's almost six thousand dollars more for that Elton John and not for nothing

[15:05] people this Godzilla black and white will pop in a collection just as much as that Elton John you

[15:12] know so we'll see you know I think we're all waiting for other things to happen in the pinball

[15:16] space I think we knew this was gonna happen this was a long-running rumor in the pinball world

[15:22] and now it's like where's that Metallica like I thought Metallica would come now and I thought that

[15:28] Godzilla would come later in the year I think what they might do is go Godzilla 70th Metallica 40th

[15:36] and then Jack Danger's X-man and I think that might be what we see and I think we might see it in

[15:42] that order but what do you think about this Godzilla black and white are you gonna order one do you

[15:47] think it's a good value do you think it's a sign that Stern is in trouble let me know at canada

[15:52] pinball at gmail.com I'm curious to see what you guys are thinking I'm reading the patreon chat

[15:58] and it's very divided camp it's a very divided camp but I think it looks good I think it looks

[16:03] really good and if I wanted a Godzilla right now knowing what's out there man this is really

[16:09] appealing to me I would absolutely pull the trigger on one everybody get some sleep I need to sleep

[16:15] I'm flying to North Carolina tomorrow I got a new business pitch on Thursday I'm back at work

[16:21] I miss being on paternity leave I have to be honest I mean it is heaven to just wake up as a grown

[16:28] adult for like eight weeks straight and not have to worry about work I felt like I won the lottery

[16:34] everybody have a great night we'll talk to you soon
