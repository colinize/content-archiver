[03:57] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

[04:07] Come gather round people wherever you're on

[04:27] And admit that the waters around you have grown

[04:32] And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone

[04:38] If your time to you is worth saving

[04:43] Then you better start swimming all your sink like a stone

[04:47] For the times of the heart are changing

[04:59] Some writers and critics who'll privatize with your pen

[05:04] And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again

[05:08] And don't speak too soon for the wheels still in spin

[05:13] And there's no telling who that it's naming

[05:17] For the loser now will be later to win

[05:22] For the times they are changing

[05:29] Some senators, congressmen please heed the call

[05:42] Don't stand in the doorway, don't lock up the hall

[05:47] Or he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled

[05:51] They battle outside region

[05:56] Well sing, shake your windows and rattle your walls

[06:00] For the times they are changing

[06:11] Some mothers and fathers throughout the land

[06:16] And don't criticize what you can't understand

[06:20] Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command

[06:25] Your old road is rapidly aging

[06:29] Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand

[06:33] For the times they are changing

[06:55] The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast

[07:00] The slow one now will later be fast

[07:04] As the present now will later be past

[07:09] The order is rapidly fading

[07:13] And the first one now will later be last

[07:18] For the times they are changing

[07:26] I'm most heaven, West Virginia

[07:32] Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River

[07:39] Life is old there, older than the trees

[07:45] Younger than the mountains

[07:48] Growing like a breeze, country roads

[07:53] Take me home to the place

[07:59] I belong West Virginia

[08:05] Mountain Mama, take me home, country roads

[08:15] All my memories gather round her

[08:21] Mothers, ladies, stranger to blue water

[08:28] Dark industry painted on the sky

[08:33] Misty taste of moonshine

[08:36] Teardrop in my eye, country roads

[08:41] Take me home to the place

[08:47] I belong West Virginia

[08:53] Mountain Mama, take me home, country roads

[09:02] I hear her voice in the morning hour

[09:07] She calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away

[09:14] Driving down the road, I get a feeling

[09:18] That I should have been home yesterday

[09:22] Yesterday, country roads

[09:28] Take me home to the place

[09:34] I belong West Virginia

[09:40] Mountain Mama, take me home, country roads

[09:48] Country roads, take me home to the place

[09:57] I belong West Virginia

[10:03] Mountain Mama, take me home, country roads

[10:12] Take me home, country roads

[10:18] Take me home, country roads

[10:25] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[10:35] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[10:42] I had to put her, six feet under

[10:50] And I can still hear her complain

[10:57] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[11:04] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[11:11] I knew I'd miss her, so I had to keep her

[11:18] She's buried right in my back home

[11:31] Mountain Mama, take me home

[11:48] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[12:00] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[12:07] She bit so much, she dropped me nuts

[12:15] And now we're happier this way

[12:24] Oh, oh yeah, thank you for what it is

[12:44] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[12:57] I used to love her, but I had to kill her

[13:04] I had to put her, six feet under

[13:12] And I can still hear her complain

[13:31] I was born in a small town, and I lived in a small town

[13:39] I've been dying in a small town, of small communities

[13:47] All my friends in a small town, my parents live in the same small town

[13:54] My child is a small town, but that's my love, I do the things

[14:09] Educated in a small town, talked to fear of Jesus in a small town

[14:17] Used to dig dreams in that small town, another foreign romantic that's me

[14:25] But I've seen it all in a small town, had myself a brawl in a small town

[14:33] Made an L.A. down and brought it to this small town, that small town, just like me

[14:42] No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from

[14:46] I cannot forget the people who love me, yeah, I can be myself here in this small town

[14:54] And people that love me, just what I want to be

[14:58] Ooh, my, my, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

[15:28] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[15:48] Got nothing against the big town, still hate to see it enough to say it was in the big town

[15:55] But my fate is in a small town, oh, and that's good enough for me

[16:03] I was born in a small town, and I can breathe in a small town

[16:11] Gonna get out of here in a small town, oh, and that's probably worth a bear in me

[16:25] Ooh, my, my, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[16:37] I'm not gonna move Got some words on cardboard

[17:01] Got your picture in my head And saying

[17:04] If you see this girl Can you tell her where I am

[17:08] Some try to hand me money But they don't understand

[17:13] I'm not broke I'm just a broken-hearted man

[17:17] I know it makes no sense But what else can I do

[17:22] And how can I move on When I'm still in love with you

[17:27] Cause if one day you wake up And find that you're missing me

[17:32] And your heart starts to wonder Where on the earth I could be

[17:36] Thinking maybe you'll come back here To the place that beat me

[17:41] And you'll see me waiting for you On the corner of the street

[17:46] I'm not moving I'm not moving

[18:06] Policeness is on you Can't stay here like this

[18:11] Somewhat I'm waiting for A fit to date, a month a year

[18:15] Gotta stand my ground Even if it rains or snows

[18:20] She changes her mind This is the first place she will go

[18:24] Cause if one day you wake up And find that you're missing me

[18:29] And your heart starts to wonder Where on the earth I could be

[18:34] Thinking maybe you'll come back here To the place that beat me

[18:39] And you'll see me waiting for you On the corner of the street

[18:44] I'm not moving I'm not moving

[19:04] People talking about the guy Who's waiting on a girl

[19:10] There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world

[19:22] Maybe I can't face As the man who can't be moved

[19:27] And maybe you won't mean to But you'll see me on the nose

[19:32] And you'll run into the corner Cause you know it's just one

[19:38] And the man who can't be moved And the man who can't be moved

[19:46] Cause if one day you wake up And find that you're missing me

[19:51] And your heart starts to wonder Where on the earth I could be

[19:56] Thinking maybe you'll come back here To the place that beat me

[20:01] And you'll see me waiting for you On the corner of the street

[20:05] I'm not moving I'm not moving

[20:11] And your heart starts to wonder Where on the earth I could be

[20:15] Thinking maybe you'll come back here To the place that beat me

[20:20] And you'll see me waiting for you On the corner of the street

[20:25] Going back to the corner Where I first saw you

[20:30] Gonna camp in my sleeping bag And I'm not gonna move

[20:37] We touch, I feel a rush We clutch, it isn't much

[20:41] It's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us

[20:43] It's lust, it's torturous You must be a sorceress

[20:46] Cause you just did the impossible Gain my trust

[20:49] Don't play games, it'll be dangerous If you fuck me over

[20:52] Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt

[20:55] Cause I've been treated like dirt Before ya and love is evil

[20:58] Spell it backwards, I'll show ya Nobody knows me, I'm cold

[21:02] Walk down this road all alone It's no one's fault but my own

[21:05] It's the path I've chosen to go Frozen to snow, I saw no emotion

[21:09] What so ever so Don't ask me why I have no love

[21:13] For these motherfucking hoes Bloodsucking sarcophagus

[21:16] What the fuck is off with this I've tried in this department

[21:19] But I ain't had no luck with this, it sucks

[21:21] But it's exactly what I thought it would be Like trying to start over

[21:24] I got a hole in my heart But some kind of emotion

[21:27] Or all the cost is something I won't go on

[21:29] So you toy with my emotions, oh it's over It's like an explosion

[21:32] Every time I hold ya I wasn't joking when I told ya

[21:34] You take my breath away You're a supernova and I'm a

[21:38] Spacebar rocket ship and now our hearts are moving

[21:43] And I may be right at you, right at you

[21:51] Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a king I need you

[21:56] And I may be right at you, right at you

[22:04] Right at you

[22:11] I'll do whatever it takes When I'm with you I get the shakes

[22:15] My body aches when I ain't With you I have zero strength

[22:18] There's no limit on how far I would go No boundaries, no lengths

[22:22] Why do we say that until we get that person that we think

[22:25] Gonna be that one and then once we get him it's never the same

[22:28] You want him when they don't want you Soon as they do feelings change

[22:32] It's not a contest of nine I know conquests from your mate

[22:35] I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you Must've been faithful so much

[22:39] To the sake of the folk, does it take Let's cut to the chase

[22:42] But a door shuts in your face Promise me if I cave in and break

[22:45] And leave myself open that I won't be making a mistake

[22:49] I'm a Spacebar rocket ship and your hearts are moving

[22:54] And I may be right at you, right at you

[23:02] Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a king I need you

[23:07] And I may be right at you, right at you

[23:15] Right at you

[23:22] So after a year and six months No longer me that you want

[23:26] But I love you so much it hurts Never mistreated you once

[23:29] I pour my heart onto you Let down my guard sweater guard

[23:33] I blow my brains in your lap Lay here and tie in your arms

[23:36] Drop to my knees and I'm bleeding I'm trying to stop you from leaving

[23:39] You won't even listen so fuck it I'm trying to stop you from breathing

[23:43] I put both hands on your throat I sit on top of you squeezing

[23:46] So I snap your neck like a popsicle Stick in your possible reason

[23:49] I could think up to let you walk about this house

[23:52] And let you live, tears stream down both of my cheeks

[23:55] Now let you go and just cave before I put that gun to my temple

[23:58] I told you this, and I wouldn't do anything for you

[24:04] To show you how much I told you

[24:07] But it's over now, it's too late to save our love

[24:12] Just promise me you're thinking me Every time you look up in the sky

[24:16] And see as strong as I'm lost

[24:18] I praise my runny-chip and all my arms are blue

[24:22] And I'm aiming right at you

[24:26] Right at you

[24:30] I get up around seven, get out of bed around nine

[24:35] And I don't worry about nothing though Because one's a waste of my time

[24:47] So we're losing these dogs around seven

[24:50] We go on stage around nine

[24:53] Get on the bus around eleven

[27:57] Saw him the other night at this roadside bar, I was walking in, he was walking out

[28:04] We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks

[28:19] And the work of the young girls, I glory days, glory days

[28:30] Well, there's a girl that lives up the block

[28:33] Back in school, she could turn all her boys' heads

[28:37] Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by, I have a few drinks

[28:42] After she put her kids to bed, her and her husband Bobby

[28:48] Well, they split up, I guess it's two years gone by now

[28:54] We just sit around, talking about the old times

[29:02] Glory days, yeah, passing by, glory days

[29:08] And the work of the young girls, I glory days, glory days

[29:28] I think I'm going down to the well tonight

[29:39] But I probably will, yeah, just sitting back

[29:45] Trying to recapture a little of the glory, yeah

[29:50] Well, the time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister

[30:29] I don't know what it is

[30:31] Something's wrong with our eyes

[30:37] There's new things in a different way

[30:40] God knows it ain't his

[30:43] It sure ain't no surprise

[31:05] We're living on the edge

[31:12] There's something wrong with the world today

[31:14] The light bulb's getting dim

[31:17] It's melt down in the sky

[31:23] But we can judge a wise man by the cover of his skin

[31:29] And mister, you're a better man than I

[31:34] We're living on the edge

[31:36] You can't help yourself from falling

[33:22] I bet you would not swim

[33:25] Again and again and again and again

[33:31] There's something right in the world today

[33:34] And everybody knows it's wrong

[33:36] But we could tell them no

[33:38] Or we could let it go

[33:39] But I would rather be a-hanging on paper

[37:47] Take me down to the paradise, sit in the grass, it's green and the girls are pretty

[37:52] Oh won't you please take me home

[38:01] Oh, one man come in the name of love, one man come and go, one man come here to justify, one man to overflow

[38:23] In the name of love, one man in the name of love, in the name of love, one man come on a mobbed wife and one man he resists

[38:51] One man washed on an empty beach, one man returned with a kiss

[39:00] In the name of love, one man in the name of love, in the name of love, one man in the name of love

[39:21] One man washed on an empty beach, one man came and went to the paradise, one man came and went to the paradise

[39:37] Oh

[40:04] Early morning, April 4th, shut rings out in the milky sky

[40:13] Free of lies, they have told you life, they could not take your pride

[40:22] In the name of love, one man in the name of love, in the name of love, one man in the name of love, in the name of love, one man in the name of love

[40:49] In my respects to grace and virtue, send my condolences to good

[40:59] In my regards to soul and romance, they always did the best they could

[41:06] In so long to devotion, you taught me everything I know, wave goodbye, wish me well

[41:17] You've gotta let me go, are we human? Or are we dancers? My sign is vital, my hands are cold

[41:35] And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

[41:41] Are we human? Or are we dancers?

[41:49] Will your system be alright when you dream upon tonight?

[41:56] There is no message we're receiving, let me know is your heart still beating?

[42:04] Are we human? Or are we dancers? My sign is vital, my hands are cold

[42:17] And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

[42:30] You've gotta let me know, are we human? Or are we dancers? My sign is vital, my hands are cold

[42:46] And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

[42:52] Are we human? Or are we dancers?

[43:16] Are we human? Or are we dancers?

[43:26] Are we human? Or are we dancers?

[43:32] Please, baby

[43:33] So easy, nothing seems to please me

[43:40] It all fits alright when I play into the night

[43:47] See me, it's you, you fall down

[43:53] This place misunderstood, missed, no it's all good, it didn't slow me down

[44:03] Mistaken, always second guessing, underestimated, look I'm still around

[44:14] Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever ever feel like you're less than fucking perfect

[44:24] Pretty, pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect to me

[44:36] You're so mean when you talk about yourself

[44:45] You were wrong, change the voices in your head, make them like you instead

[44:58] So complicated, look how we are making, feel with so much hatred, such a tired game

[45:08] It's enough, I don't know, I can think of, chase down all my demons, I see you do the same

[45:19] Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever ever feel like you're less than fucking perfect

[45:30] Pretty, pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect to me

[45:41] The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear, the only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer

[45:46] So cool in line, and we try, try, try, but we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time

[45:51] Done looking for the critics, cause they're everywhere, they don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair

[45:56] graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph graph

[46:26] Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again

[46:30] Do you ever feel, there's so paper thin

[46:34] Like a house apart, one blow from caving in

[46:38] Do you ever feel, already buried deep

[46:42] Six feet under screens and no one seems to hear a thing

[46:46] Do you know that there's still a chance for you

[46:50] Cause there's a spark in you, you just gotta ignite

[46:54] The light, and let it shine

[47:00] Just on the night, like the fourth of July

[47:08] Cause baby you're a firework

[47:12] Come on show em what you're worth

[47:16] Make em go uh uh uh

[47:31] Make em go uh uh uh

[47:34] You're gonna leave em all in there

[47:40] You don't have to feel like a wasted space

[47:44] You're original, cannot be replaced

[47:48] If you only knew what the future holds

[47:52] After a hurricane, comes a rainbow

[47:56] Maybe your reason why, all the doors are closed

[48:00] So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road

[48:04] Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow

[48:08] And when it's time you know, you just gotta ignite

[48:13] The light, and let it shine

[48:18] Just on the night, like the fourth of July

[48:25] Cause baby you're a firework

[48:29] Come on show em what you're worth

[48:33] Make em go uh uh uh

[53:10] When all is said and done

[53:13] We're not the only ones

[53:16] Who look at life this way

[53:19] That's what the old folks say

[53:21] But every time I'd see them

[53:23] Makes me wish I had a gun

[53:26] If I thought that I was crazy

[53:29] Well, I guess I'd have more fun

[53:32] Guess I'd have more fun

[53:45] The catcher in the ride again

[53:50] Won't let you get away from him

[53:54] Another day like today

[54:03] You decide

[54:05] Cause I don't have to

[54:08] And then they'll find

[54:11] Cause I won't ask you at any time

[54:17] Or longer after if the cold outside

[54:22] Is I imagine

[54:30] It to be

[54:47] It to be

[54:52] It to be

[55:00] It to be

[55:11] It to be

[55:17] It to be

[55:22] It to be

[55:27] It to be

[55:32] It to be

[55:37] It to be

[55:46] The catcher in the ride again

[55:51] Won't let you get away from him

[55:55] Another day like today

[55:59] When all is said and done

[56:02] We're not the only ones

[56:05] Who look at life this way

[56:08] That's what the old folks say

[56:11] As if they'd ever change

[56:14] As that would mind to say

[56:16] But every time I'd see them

[56:18] Makes me wish I had a gun

[56:21] If I thought that I was crazy

[56:24] Well, I guess I'd have more fun

[56:27] Cause what used to be

[56:29] Is not there for me

[56:31] I was one that belonged

[56:35] Insane like I do

[57:01] Not in an ordinary day

[57:03] Not in an ordinary way

[57:06] All at once the song I heard

[57:09] No longer would it play

[57:11] For anybody

[57:14] For anyone

[57:17] That needed comfort from somebody

[57:20] Needed comfort from someone

[57:23] Who cares

[57:26] To be

[57:28] Not like you

[57:30] I'd like me

[57:32] And then more just ran away

[57:36] From me

[57:39] So now you shed the wheels in ocean

[57:43] Cause I never knew

[57:45] You would be in command

[57:48] You were the one

[57:51] How about it?

[57:52] Took about it

[57:54] Gave that boy a gun

[57:56] To my innocent

[57:59] Be a lostess

[58:01] Sometimes the only thing

[58:04] Was got it all alone

[58:06] And it was there

[58:08] I

[58:10] I

[58:12] Be a human

[58:14] Be a human

[58:16] Be a human

[58:18] Be a human

[58:20] Be a human

[58:22] Be a human

[58:24] Be a human

[58:26] Be a human

[58:29] Be a human

[58:32] Back against the wall and us

[58:36] With the strength of a mill and a car

[58:39] So your suits are cold outstanding

[58:43] Your emotions become flex

[58:47] Against the grain of dystopic claims

[58:52] So the thoughts, your actions and the times

[58:56] And you

[58:58] Have proved

[59:00] To me

[59:03] A real human being

[59:07] And a real hero

[59:11] Real human being

[59:16] And a real hero

[59:20] Real human being

[59:24] And a real hero

[59:28] Real human being

[59:32] And a real hero

[59:37] Real human being

[59:50] Real human being

[59:54] Real human being

[59:57] A pilot on a cocoa moon

[01:00:01] 155 people on board

[01:00:05] All safe and all rescued

[01:00:09] From a slowly sinking ship

[01:00:13] More or more than a set so cool

[01:00:18] That I finally what to do

[01:00:22] And you

[01:00:24] Have proved

[01:00:26] To me

[01:00:28] A real human being

[01:00:33] And a real hero

[01:00:37] Real human being

[01:00:41] And a real hero

[01:00:46] Real human being

[01:00:50] And a real hero

[01:00:54] Real human being

[01:01:05] It's more than a feeling

[01:01:09] That I'm telling you

[01:01:12] It's more than a feeling

[01:01:14] That I'm making you dream

[01:01:16] More than a feeling

[01:01:18] That I'm making you dream

[01:01:20] More than a feeling

[01:01:22] That I want to do

[01:01:24] I said that I'm married

[01:01:26] And I want you to wear

[01:01:40] So many people

[01:01:42] Have come and gone

[01:01:44] The faces fade as the years go down

[01:01:49] Yet I still recall

[01:01:51] As I wander around

[01:01:53] As clear as the sun

[01:01:56] In the middle of the sky

[01:02:13] It's more than a feeling

[01:02:16] That I'm making you dream

[01:02:18] More than a feeling

[01:02:20] That I'm making you dream

[01:02:22] More than a feeling

[01:02:24] That I want to do

[01:02:26] I said that I'm married

[01:02:28] And I want you to wear

[01:02:31] I said that I'm married

[01:02:34] And I'm walking away

[01:02:42] I said that I'm married

[01:02:44] And I want you to wear

[01:02:47] I said that I'm married

[01:02:49] And I want you to wear

[01:02:52] I said that I'm married

[01:02:55] And I want you to wear

[01:02:58] I said that I'm married

[01:03:00] And I want you to wear

[01:03:02] I said that I'm married

[01:03:04] And I want you to wear

[01:03:06] I said that I'm married

[01:03:08] And I want you to wear

[01:03:10] I said that I'm married

[01:03:13] And I want you to wear

[01:03:15] I said that I'm married

[01:03:17] And I want you to wear

[01:03:19] I said that I'm married

[01:03:22] And I want you to wear

[01:03:24] I said that I'm married

[01:03:26] And I want you to wear

[01:03:28] I said that I'm married

[01:03:30] And I want you to wear

[01:03:32] I said that I'm married

[01:03:34] And I want you to wear

[01:03:36] I said that I'm married

[01:04:08] I'm the entry that I want to be

[01:04:19] I'm the entry that I want to be

[01:04:23] I'm the entry that I want to be

[01:04:28] JSC is a friend

[01:04:32] Yeah, I know it's been a good friend of mine

[01:04:36] But lately something's changed, it ain't hard to define

[01:04:40] JSC's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine

[01:04:44] And she's watching me with those eyes

[01:04:47] And she's loving with that body I just don't

[01:04:51] And he's holding her in his arms, late, late at night

[01:04:55] You know I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:04:59] I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:05:04] Where can I find a woman like that?

[01:05:08] I'll play along with the charade

[01:05:11] That doesn't seem to be a reason to change

[01:05:15] You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute

[01:05:19] I want to tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot

[01:05:23] Cause she's watching me with those eyes

[01:05:26] And she's loving with that body I just don't

[01:05:30] And he's holding her in his arms, late, late at night

[01:05:35] You know I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:05:39] I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:05:44] Where can I find a woman like that?

[01:05:47] I'd like to see JSC's girl

[01:05:50] I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:05:55] Where can I find a woman?

[01:05:59] Where can I find a woman like that?

[01:06:10] And I'm living in the mirror all the time

[01:06:14] Wondering what she don't see in me

[01:06:17] I've been funny, I'm cool with the lines

[01:06:21] Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

[01:06:28] Where can I find a woman like that?

[01:06:38] Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?

[01:06:42] Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?

[01:06:57] You know I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:07:01] I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:07:05] I want JSC's girl

[01:07:09] Where can I find a woman like that?

[01:07:12] I'd like to see JSC's girl

[01:07:15] I wish that I had JSC's girl

[01:07:19] I want JSC's girl

[01:07:29] I never seen you look so good

[01:07:32] You're never out the way you should

[01:07:36] But I like it

[01:07:39] And I know you like it too

[01:07:44] The way that I want you

[01:07:48] I gotta have you

[01:07:50] Oh yes I do

[01:07:52] I never, I never else stay out late

[01:07:56] You know that I can hardly wait

[01:08:00] Just to see you

[01:08:03] And I know you cannot wait

[01:08:08] I wait to see me too

[01:08:12] I gotta touch you

[01:08:14] Cause baby will be

[01:08:17] At the drive-in

[01:08:20] In the old man's board

[01:08:34] And baby

[01:08:36] Talk to me

[01:08:40] You know I call you

[01:08:42] I call you on the telephone

[01:08:45] I'm only hoping that you're home

[01:08:49] So I can't hear you

[01:08:52] When you say those words to me

[01:08:57] And whisper so softly

[01:09:01] I gotta hear you

[01:09:03] Cause baby will be

[01:09:06] At the drive-in

[01:09:09] In the old man's board

[01:09:12] Behind the bullshit

[01:13:19] It's the way I'm feeling

[01:13:21] I just can't deny

[01:13:26] But I've got to let it go

[01:13:30] Without love in a hopeless place

[01:14:57] We found love in a hopeless place

[01:15:09] Yellow diamonds in the light

[01:15:13] I was standing side by side

[01:15:17] As the shadow crossed its mind

[01:15:23] We found love in a hopeless place

[01:15:27] We found love in a hopeless place

[01:16:34] The hardest part, this troubled heart

[01:16:36] Has never yet been through now

[01:16:38] With the heat of the scars

[01:16:40] That got us dark inside someone like you now

[01:16:44] And I know I've been shown back

[01:16:46] When I only take me

[01:16:48] To break the chains that brought me on

[01:16:51] And all the one who raised me

[01:16:53] I never wanted that I'd come

[01:16:56] No matter what you've paid me

[01:16:58] Replay the part you stole my heart

[01:17:01] I sit there knowing you're crazy

[01:17:03] With all I know and I'm there with you

[01:17:06] I once wanted to save me

[01:17:08] It'd be enough but just my love

[01:17:11] I feel it all the way beyond that

[01:17:14] I wanted one

[01:17:17] Now I know you better

[01:17:20] You know I know better

[01:17:22] Now I know you better

[01:17:30] So been a sweetest tragedy

[01:17:32] Won't ask for an absolution

[01:17:34] This melody inside of me

[01:17:37] Still such a sports solution

[01:17:39] I twisted fate

[01:17:41] The sting of my heart gives my defanatuation

[01:17:45] A broken heart

[01:17:46] Defines the spot for my determination

[01:17:49] No one ever told me when I was alone

[01:17:53] They just thought I'd know better

[01:17:56] Better than through

[01:17:59] No one ever told me when I was alone

[01:18:03] They just thought I'd know better

[01:18:06] Better than through

[01:18:09] All that I wanted was

[01:18:14] Now I know you better

[01:18:16] You know I know better

[01:18:19] Now I know you better

[01:18:39] I never wanted you to be so far from me

[01:18:54] I never wanted you to be somebody else

[01:19:00] I never wanted you to be somebody else

[01:19:04] I never wanted you to be someone afraid

[01:19:08] All the shells I only wanted

[01:19:11] You to see things for yourself

[01:19:28] All that I wanted was

[01:19:33] Now I know you better

[01:19:36] Now I know better

[01:19:38] All that I wanted was

[01:20:06] Now I know better

[01:20:22] If I were you I'd manage to

[01:20:25] Abhor the ablation

[01:20:27] I promise life I can't give up

[01:20:30] With your operation

[01:20:32] Just use your head and your feet

[01:20:34] And at the end you'll find your inspiration

[01:20:37] To tell us it's bad and you won't regret this kind of inspiration

[01:20:42] You know the bed feels warmer

[01:20:45] Sleeping here alone

[01:20:50] You know I dream in color

[01:20:54] And do the things I want

[01:20:58] You think you got the best of me

[01:21:00] You think you've had the last life

[01:21:02] Bet you think that everything good is gone

[01:21:06] Think you left me broken down

[01:21:08] Think that I'll come on and back

[01:21:54] With someone new

[01:21:58] They told you I was moving on

[01:22:02] Over you

[01:22:06] And think that I'd come back

[01:22:09] I'd come back swinging

[01:22:11] You tried to break me but you see

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] 

[01:31:21] I realize that you're my major secret

[01:31:25] I need you

[01:31:27] If you ever love somebody put your hands up

[01:31:29] If you ever love somebody put your hands up

[01:31:32] And let it burn if you wish you could give them everything

[01:31:37] So if you ever love somebody put your hands up

[01:31:40] If you ever love somebody put your hands up

[01:31:43] Let it burn if you wish you could give them everything

[01:31:46] By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up

[01:31:49] I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up

[01:31:52] If I was you I would duck or get struck like lightning fighters

[01:31:54] Keep fighting put your lighters up point them skyward

[01:31:57] Had a dream I was king I woke up steel king

[01:31:59] His rap came, his nivolous mind for the milking

[01:32:02] Tell nobody else even fucking fills me

[01:32:04] Till it kills me I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music

[01:32:07] There is or there ever will be

[01:32:09] Disagree, feel free but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up

[01:32:12] Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses

[01:32:15] Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

[01:32:18] And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick

[01:32:20] But you cocks a slick poppin shit on how you flipped your life around

[01:32:27] Cause cock back with the steel cocky pricks

[01:32:29] I love it when I tell him shove it cause it wasn't that long ago

[01:32:32] And Marshall said plus it lacked plus the cuss he couldn't cut

[01:32:35] Mustard muster up nothing brain fuzzy cause he's buzzing

[01:32:37] Woke up from that puzzle now you wonder why he does it

[01:32:40] How he does it wasn't cuss he had

[01:32:42] Cuss it circled around his head waiting for him to drop dead

[01:32:47] Cuss this fuck I guess it doesn't matter now

[01:32:49] Does it what difference it make what's it take

[01:32:51] To get it through your dick skulls at this age

[01:32:53] Some bullshit people don't usually come back this way

[01:32:55] From a place it was dark as I was in just to get to this place

[01:32:58] Not let these words be like a switchblade to a haters rib cage

[01:33:01] And let it be known if from this day forward I wanna just say thanks

[01:33:04] Cause your haters would gave me the strength to let them be praised

[01:33:07] Cause I came at 5'9 but I feel like I'm sick sick

[01:33:09] This one's for you and me

[01:33:12] Living out our dreams

[01:33:15] Where are we?

[01:33:17] Where we should be?

[01:33:20] If my arms are wide

[01:33:23] I open my eyes

[01:33:26] And now all I wanna see

[01:33:31] Is a sky full of lighters

[01:33:36] A sky full of lighters

[01:33:43] By the time you hear this I probably already be outie

[01:33:46] I advance like going from Toten, I ain't it going

[01:33:48] Then buying four or five with the homies to Iron Man

[01:33:51] Outie, my daddy told me slow down boy you're going to blow it

[01:33:54] And I ain't gotta stop to be the minute to tell Shady

[01:33:57] I love him the same way that he did

[01:33:59] Dr. Dre on the chronic can tell him how real he is

[01:34:01] Or how high I am or how I would kill for him

[01:34:04] For him to know it I cry 20 tears

[01:34:06] My daddy got a bad back so it's only right that I write

[01:34:09] Till he can march right into that post office

[01:34:11] And tell him to hang it up

[01:34:13] Now his career is Lebron's Jersey in 20 years

[01:34:15] I stopped when I met the very top

[01:34:17] You shitted on me on your way up

[01:34:19] It's about to be a scary drop

[01:34:21] Cause what goes up must come down

[01:34:23] You going down I'm something you don't wanna see

[01:34:25] Like a hairy box

[01:34:26] Every hour happy hour now

[01:34:28] Life is wacky now

[01:34:29] Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy

[01:34:31] Now I'm just a cash me out

[01:34:33] Placic cow always down for the catchweight

[01:34:35] Like a packy owl, y'all a doom

[01:34:37] I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me

[01:34:39] My car starts itself, parks itself from all the tunes

[01:34:42] Cause now I'm in the Aston

[01:34:43] I went from having my city locked up

[01:34:45] To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

[01:34:47] And now I'm fantastic compared to a weed hop

[01:34:50] And y'all niggas disgustin' like bitches

[01:34:52] On the radio and TV, see me, we fly

[01:34:55] Y'all bugging out like Wendy Williams

[01:34:57] Staring at a beehive and how real is that

[01:34:59] I remember signing my first deal

[01:35:01] Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that

[01:35:03] Now Bruno can show his ass

[01:35:05] Without the MTV Awards Gap

[01:35:35] So I set the world on fire

[01:35:39] We can burn brighter than the sun

[01:35:47] Now I know that I'm not all that you got

[01:35:53] I guess that I just thought

[01:35:55] Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart

[01:35:58] But our friends are back

[01:36:01] So let's raise a toast

[01:36:03] Cause I found the one that carried me

[01:36:06] Oh, tonight

[01:36:11] We are young

[01:36:16] So let's set the world on fire

[01:36:20] We can burn brighter than the sun

[01:36:28] Tonight

[01:36:32] We are young

[01:36:36] So let's set the world on fire

[01:36:41] We can burn brighter than the sun

[01:36:49] Counting how to turn around

[01:36:54] Counting how to turn around

[01:37:01] Counting how to turn around

[01:37:05] Counting how to turn around

[01:37:11] The world is on its side

[01:37:14] I have no reason for wrong

[01:37:16] So someone come and carry me

[01:37:19] Oh, tonight

[01:37:22] The end is never right

[01:37:24] But I can hear your cry

[01:37:28] You are the best

[01:37:30] Well they didn't fuckin' make it

[01:37:33] So here's what you get

[01:37:35] From Hollywood

[01:37:37] Goose and

[01:37:39] Rosa

[01:37:52] No one is like a freight train

[01:38:03] Flying like a new plane

[01:38:06] Feeling like a sports train

[01:38:08] One more time tonight

[01:38:11] Look out, but I'm a West Coast brat

[01:38:14] One bad mother got a lot of snakes and gates

[01:38:17] Under my arms

[01:38:19] Said I'm a mean machine

[01:38:21] But they can gas me

[01:38:23] And you can make my motor home

[01:38:25] Well I got one chance left

[01:38:27] In a nine-night cat

[01:38:29] I got a dog and dogs I smile

[01:38:32] I got a ball top

[01:38:33] Got to wear the match to throw my small miles

[01:38:36] So that we start

[01:38:38] Rock and tell you, honey

[01:38:40] You made my mother's night

[01:38:45] Wake up rain

[01:38:46] Honey, put on your clothes

[01:38:48] And take your credit card to a liquor store

[01:38:51] One for you

[01:38:53] Two for me and back tonight

[01:38:57] I've been loaded like a freight train

[01:39:00] Flying like a narrow plane

[01:39:04] Feeling like a space train

[01:39:06] One more time tonight

[01:39:10] I'm on the night train

[01:39:12] Spotted on the floor

[01:39:13] I'm on the night train

[01:39:15] To my stuff, my mother's night train

[01:39:18] Running and crashing man

[01:39:20] I never lie

[01:39:22] I'm on the night train

[01:39:24] I'm at stuff, my mother's night train

[01:39:27] I'm on the night train

[01:39:29] My mother's night train

[01:39:31] Never to return

[01:39:35] No

[01:39:45] No

[01:39:47] No

[01:39:49] No

[01:39:51] No

[01:40:30] Feeling like a space train

[01:40:32] One more time tonight

[01:40:35] I'm on the night train

[01:40:39] I'm on the night train

[01:40:42] Running and crashing man

[01:40:48] Night train

[01:40:51] Running and night train

[01:40:54] I'm on the night train

[01:40:57] Never to return

[01:41:01] Night train

[01:41:04] You need some time

[01:41:07] On your own

[01:41:11] You need some time

[01:41:14] All alone

[01:41:17] Everybody needs some time

[01:41:20] On their own

[01:41:23] But you know you need some time

[01:41:27] All alone

[01:41:32] I know it's hard to keep an open mind

[01:41:38] Even for empty mouths on you

[01:41:44] But if you could heal a broken heart

[01:41:51] Wouldn't I have to charm you?

[01:42:07] I know it's hard to keep an open mind

[01:42:11] Even for empty mouths on you

[01:42:15] But if you could heal a broken heart

[01:42:19] Wouldn't I have to charm you?

[01:42:23] Wouldn't I have to charm you?

[01:42:27] Wouldn't I have to charm you?

[01:42:31] Wouldn't I have to charm you?

[01:42:35] Wouldn't I have to charm you?

[01:42:40] Wouldn't I have to charm you?

[01:42:46] You need some time

[01:42:48] You need some time

[01:42:50] On your own

[01:42:53] Sometimes I need some time

[01:42:56] All alone

[01:42:59] Everybody needs some time

[01:43:02] On their own

[01:43:05] You need some time

[01:43:08] All alone

[01:43:32] When your fears and desire and shadows still remain

[01:43:53] I know that you can't love me

[01:43:56] When there's no one left to play

[01:44:02] So never mind the darkness

[01:44:08] We still can find a way

[01:44:17] Nothing lasts forever

[01:44:20] Even though no one ever ran

[01:44:32] No one ever ran

[01:44:34] No one ever ran

[01:44:37] No one ever ran

[01:44:40] No one ever ran

[01:44:43] No one ever ran

[01:44:46] No one ever ran

[01:44:48] No one ever ran

[01:44:51] No one ever ran

[01:44:53] No one ever ran

[01:44:56] No one ever ran

[01:44:59] No one ever ran

[01:45:02] No one ever ran

[01:45:05] No one ever ran

[01:45:08] No one ever ran

[01:45:11] No one ever ran

[01:45:14] No one ever ran

[01:45:17] No one ever ran

[01:45:20] No one ever ran

[01:45:23] No one ever ran

[01:45:26] No one ever ran

[01:45:29] No one ever ran

[01:45:32] No one ever ran

[01:45:35] No one ever ran

[01:45:38] No one ever ran

[01:45:40] Lady Lady Lady

[01:45:42] Lady Lady Lady

[01:45:44] Lady Lady Lady

[01:45:46] Lady Lady Lady

[01:45:48] Lady Lady Lady

[01:45:50] Lady Lady Lady

[01:45:52] Lady Lady Lady

[01:45:55] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:45:58] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:01] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:03] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:06] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:09] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:11] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:14] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:16] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:19] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:22] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:24] I'm not the only one who needs someone

[01:46:44] Joking, murder, vacation, fire, wind

[01:46:48] Cover and I'm talking over

[01:46:51] So many things that I wanna say

[01:46:55] You know I like my girls a little bit older

[01:46:58] I just wanna use your love tonight

[01:47:06] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:47:13] I ain't got many friends that I talk to

[01:47:17] No way to ruin them in trouble

[01:47:21] You know I'm the way I'm to thank for you

[01:47:25] Stay and never keep it under cover

[01:47:28] I just wanna use your love tonight

[01:47:36] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:47:51] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:47:58] Try to start my hands when she can

[01:48:01] Something in my mind's not making sense

[01:48:05] Still I'm so sweet at all alone

[01:48:09] Looking out the way I'm feeling

[01:48:12] As you leave a place once you close the door

[01:48:16] And don't forget what I told you

[01:48:20] Just come to London, don't need a room

[01:48:24] Another shoulder to drive upon

[01:48:27] I just wanna use your love tonight

[01:48:35] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:48:42] I just wanna use your love tonight

[01:48:50] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:49:20] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:49:25] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:49:30] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:49:35] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:49:40] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:49:45] I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[01:50:02] She's got a smile that it seems to me

[01:50:05] Reminds me of childhood memories

[01:50:09] Where everything was precious in bright blue sky

[01:50:14] Now and then when I see her face

[01:50:20] It takes me away to that special place

[01:50:24] And if I stay too long

[01:50:26] I'll probably break down and cry

[01:50:32] Oh, sweet child of mine

[01:50:37] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine

[01:50:44] ine

[01:51:03] She's got eyes of the blue and sky

[01:51:06] That give faith from the rain

[01:51:10] I hate to look into those eyes and see a gowns to pray

[01:51:17] Her hair reminds me of a once-day place where as a child I'd hide

[01:51:25] And pray for the thunder and the rain to quieten the past in my eyes

[01:51:33] Oh, I was being just fine

[01:51:40] Oh, I was being loved by a hand

[01:52:03] Oh, I was being just fine

[01:52:18] Oh, I was being just fine

[01:52:23] Oh, I was being loved by a hand

[01:52:33] Oh, I was being just fine

[01:52:39] Oh, I was being loved by a hand

[01:53:03] Oh, I was being loved by a hand

[01:53:26] What's it got to do with me so long?

[01:53:34] Tell me you took on the dark

[01:53:37] Union's been on strike, it's down on his luck, it's tough

[01:53:45] So tough

[01:53:49] She the one for time and all day

[01:53:53] Working for a man, she brings home her pet for love

[01:54:04] She says we gotta hold on to what we've got

[01:54:09] It doesn't make a difference if we make it all night

[01:54:13] We got each other and that's a lot for love

[01:54:19] We'll give it a shot

[01:54:21] Oh, a headway there

[01:54:25] Oh, give me all my prayers

[01:54:29] Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear

[01:54:33] Oh, give me all my prayers

[01:54:40] Tell me it's got his six drinking hot

[01:54:44] Now he's holding in, what he used to make it tough

[01:54:48] So tough

[01:54:51] It's tough

[01:54:56] She the dreamer running away

[01:54:59] She cries in the night time to whisper

[01:55:03] Baby, it's okay

[01:55:07] So deep

[01:55:11] We gotta hold on to what we've got

[01:55:15] It doesn't make a difference if we make it all night

[01:55:19] We got each other and that's a lot for love

[01:55:25] We'll give it a shot

[01:55:27] Oh, a headway there

[01:55:31] Oh, give me all my prayers

[01:55:35] Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear

[01:55:39] Oh, give me all my prayers

[01:55:43] Take my hand, we'll make it

[01:56:02] Oh, we gotta hold on

[01:56:06] Ready or not, you live for the fight

[01:56:09] When I'm gonna try

[01:56:28] I come home in the morning like my mother says

[01:56:32] When you're gonna live your life right

[01:56:35] Oh, mom and dad win at the fortune it won

[01:56:39] And girls, they wanna have fun

[01:56:42] Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[01:56:53] It's all rings in the middle of the night

[01:56:56] My body yells, what you gonna do with your life

[01:57:01] Oh, daddy, do you know you're still number one

[01:57:05] But girls, they wanna have fun

[01:57:08] Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[01:57:12] That's all they really want

[01:57:16] The fun

[01:57:19] But in the work and day it's done

[01:57:22] Oh, girls, they wanna have fun

[01:57:26] Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[01:57:32] Wanna have fun, girl

[01:57:36] Wanna have fun

[01:57:38] Some boys take a beautiful girl and hide her away from the rest of the world

[01:58:01] I wanna be the one to walk in the sun

[01:58:05] Oh, girls, they wanna have fun

[01:58:08] Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[01:58:11] That's all they really want

[01:58:15] The fun

[01:58:19] But in the work and day it's done

[01:58:22] Oh, girls, they wanna have fun

[01:58:26] Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[01:58:32] Wanna have fun, girl

[01:58:36] Wanna have fun

[01:58:38] They're just wanna, they're just wanna fun

[01:58:41] They're just wanna, they're just wanna fun

[01:58:47] Girl, girls just wanna have fun

[01:58:52] They're just a wail, they're just a wail

[01:58:57] They're just a wail, they're just a wail

[01:59:03] This bed is so vile, with patch of blood

[01:59:07] The neighbors complain, the fathom noises above

[01:59:11] But she only comes when she's on top

[01:59:16] My therapist said, I can see you no more

[01:59:23] She said you're like a disease, without any cure

[01:59:27] She said I'm so obsessed, that I'm becoming a bore

[01:59:32] Oh no, I think you're so pretty

[01:59:46] Oh no, I think you're so pretty

[01:59:54] Caught your hand beside the till, slammed your fingers in the door

[01:59:58] Bought your kitchen knives and skewers

[02:00:02] Dressed me up in women's clothes, messed around with gender roles

[02:00:06] Now my eyes are calling me pretty

[02:00:10] Woo, woo, woo

[02:00:25] Put out of the house, saw you move next door

[02:00:29] I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall

[02:00:33] I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone

[02:00:37] You driving me crazy when you're coming home

[02:01:07] Woo, woo, woo

[02:01:14] Woo, woo, woo

[02:01:21] Woo, woo, woo

[02:01:28] Woo, woo, woo

[02:01:51] Woo, woo, woo

[02:01:58] Woo, woo, woo

[02:02:03] It don't really matter, gonna find out for yourself

[02:02:09] No, it don't really matter, gonna leave this thing to somebody else

[02:02:17] If they were missionaries, real-time visionaries

[02:02:24] Sitting in a Chinese stew to view my dear's infatuation

[02:02:31] I know that I'm a classic case, watch my disjointed face

[02:02:38] Blaming on the fallen god, they see the end and it can't hold on now

[02:02:45] Cause it would take a lot more hate than you to end the fascination

[02:02:52] Even with an iron fist, more than you got to rule the nation

[02:02:59] When all I've got is resistance

[02:03:03] It don't really matter, yes I keep it to myself

[02:03:10] Said it don't really matter, it's time I look around for somebody else

[02:03:18] Cause it would take a lot more time than you have got for masturbation

[02:03:25] Even with an iron fist, more than you got to rule the nation

[02:03:31] When all we've got is resistance

[02:03:35] More than you got to rule the nation

[02:03:39] When all I've got is resistance

[02:04:05] No, it don't really matter, I guess you'll find out for yourself

[02:04:18] No, it don't really matter, so you can't hear it now from somebody else

[02:04:26] You think you got it all out of the inside

[02:04:30] And it can't handle another thing

[02:04:34] It's like you're walking upon from the cell

[02:04:38] And I am keeping your own kind in hell

[02:04:41] When you're great, we'll all rock like yourself

[02:04:45] Like in your ass with your head you can tell

[02:04:49] And you're out of time

[02:04:52] Hold on little girl, show me where he's standing

[02:04:57] Stand up little girl, a broken heart can't be that bad

[02:05:03] When it's through, it's through, fate would twist the both of you

[02:05:09] So come on baby, come on over, let me be the one to show you

[02:05:15] I'm the one who wants to be with you

[02:05:20] Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too

[02:05:26] Wait it on a line of deeps and blues

[02:05:32] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:05:38] Build up your confidence so you can be on top for once

[02:05:43] Wake up who cares about little boy that talk too much

[02:05:49] I'll send it all, go down, the game of love was all ran down

[02:05:55] So come on baby, come on over, let me be the one to hold

[02:06:01] I'm the one who wants to be with you

[02:06:06] Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too

[02:06:12] Wait it on a line of deeps and blues

[02:06:18] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:06:24] Why be alone when we can be together baby

[02:06:29] You can make my life worthwhile, I can make you start to smile

[02:06:54] When it's through, it's through, fate would twist the both of you

[02:07:04] So come on baby, come on over, let me be the one to show you

[02:07:11] I'm the one who wants to be with you

[02:07:16] Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too

[02:07:23] Wait it on a line of deeps and blues

[02:07:28] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:07:34] I'm the one who wants to be with you

[02:07:40] Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too

[02:07:46] Wait it on a line of deeps and blues

[02:07:51] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:07:57] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:08:02] Our cracklin' loose at gate on board

[02:08:07] We gonna ride till there ain't no more to go

[02:08:12] Taking it slow

[02:08:15] And love don't you know

[02:08:18] I'll have me a time where the poor man's leechin' on a twilight train

[02:08:26] Ain't nothing here that I care to take along

[02:08:31] Maybe a song to sing when I want

[02:08:37] Don't need to stay pleased to know man for a happy tune

[02:08:45] Oh I love my rosy child

[02:08:49] You got the way to make me happy

[02:08:53] You and me we're going to start

[02:08:56] Cracklin' rose you're a store-bought woman

[02:09:00] But you make me sing like a guitar humming

[02:09:04] So hang on to me girl, a song keeps running out

[02:09:11] Play it now, play it now, play it now

[02:09:15] My big cracklin' rose and make me a smile

[02:09:20] And girl if it lasts for an hour

[02:09:23] Then it's alright as we got all night

[02:09:28] We set the world right

[02:09:31] Find us a dream that don't ask no question, yeah

[02:09:39] Oh I love my rosy child

[02:09:42] You got the way to make me happy

[02:09:46] You and me we're going to start

[02:09:50] Cracklin' rose you're a store-bought woman

[02:09:53] But you make me sing like a guitar humming

[02:09:57] So hang on to me girl, a song keeps running out

[02:10:05] Play it now, play it now, play it now

[02:10:09] My big cracklin' rose and make me a smile

[02:10:14] And girl if it lasts for an hour

[02:10:17] Then it's alright as we got all night

[02:10:21] We've both like signed a steel in the dead of the night

[02:10:27] Although we've both like close together

[02:10:30] We feel miles apart inside

[02:10:34] Was it something I said or something I did?

[02:10:37] Did my words not come out right?

[02:10:40] Though I tried not to hurt you

[02:10:44] Though I tried but I guess that's why they say

[02:10:48] Every rose has its thong

[02:10:54] Just like every night has its dawn

[02:11:01] Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

[02:11:08] Every rose has its thong

[02:11:14] And it does

[02:11:16] I listen to a favorite song playing on the radio

[02:11:35] Where the DJ said it was a game of easy coming

[02:11:40] But I wonder, does he know?

[02:11:45] Has it ever been like this?

[02:11:48] And I know that you'd be here right now

[02:11:52] If I could at least know somehow

[02:11:56] I guess every rose has its thong

[02:12:01] Just like every night has its dawn

[02:12:09] Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

[02:12:17] Every rose has its thong

[02:12:24] Though it's been a while now

[02:12:27] I could still feel so much pain

[02:12:31] If the night that cuts you to woody news

[02:12:35] The sky that's covering me

[02:13:05] I know I could've said hello

[02:13:21] But not about knowing what to say

[02:13:25] Instead of making love

[02:13:28] We both made a stirrer wish

[02:13:32] And now I've found somebody new

[02:13:36] And that I never meant that much to you

[02:13:39] To hear that tip of inside and to see you cut smear

[02:13:45] Like a knife I guess every rose has its thong

[02:13:52] Just like every night has its dawn

[02:13:59] Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

[02:14:07] Every rose has its thong

[02:14:12] See the tip, cause I'm missing you

[02:14:15] I'm still alright to smile

[02:14:19] Girl, I think about you every day now

[02:14:27] Was a time when I wasn't sure

[02:14:30] But you set my mind at ease

[02:14:35] There is no doubt you're in my heart now

[02:14:43] Said, woman, take it slow

[02:14:46] And work yourself out fine

[02:14:51] All we need is just a little patience

[02:14:59] Said, sugar, make it slow

[02:15:02] And we'll come together fine

[02:15:07] All we need is just a little patience

[02:15:21] Ooh, yeah

[02:15:28] I sit here on the stairs

[02:15:31] Cause I'd rather be alone

[02:15:35] If I can't have you right now

[02:15:39] I wait here

[02:15:43] Sometimes I get so tense

[02:15:47] But I can't speed up the time

[02:15:50] But you know love, there's one more thing to consider

[02:15:58] Said, woman, take it slow

[02:16:02] Things will be just fine

[02:16:06] You and I'll just use a little patience

[02:16:15] Said, sugar, take the time

[02:16:18] Cause the lights are shining bright

[02:16:23] You and I've got what it takes to make it

[02:16:30] We won't fake it

[02:16:33] I'll never break it

[02:16:37] Cause I can't take it

[02:16:45] I'll never break it

[02:16:49] I'll never break it

[02:16:53] I'll never break it

[02:16:57] I'll never break it

[02:17:01] I'll never break it

[02:17:06] I'll never break it

[02:17:11] I'll never break it

[02:17:15] I'll never break it

[02:17:19] I'll never break it

[02:17:23] I'll never break it

[02:17:27] I'll never break it

[02:17:30] I'll never break it

[02:17:34] I'll never break it

[02:17:38] I'll never break it

[02:17:41] I'll never break it

[02:17:47] I'll never break it

[02:17:50] I'll never break it

[02:17:53] I'll never break it

[02:17:56] I'll never break it

[02:17:59] I'll never break it

[02:18:04] I'll never break it

[02:18:07] Just a little patience, yeah

[02:18:15] Some all patience

[02:18:17] I've been walking these streets tonight

[02:18:21] Just trying to get it right

[02:18:25] Caught to see it with so many around

[02:18:29] No, I don't like being stuck in the crowd

[02:18:32] And the streets don't change but maybe later

[02:18:37] I ain't got time for the game cause I need you

[02:18:42] Yeah, yeah, but I need you

[02:18:46] Oh, I need you

[02:18:50] Oh, I need you

[02:18:54] Cause I want to die

[02:19:02] I let you settle down

[02:19:10] That you found a girl and you're married now

[02:19:18] That's your dreams came true

[02:19:24] Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

[02:19:31] Oh, friend, why are you so shy?

[02:19:38] Ain't like you to hold back

[02:19:42] Oh, hide from the light

[02:19:46] I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited

[02:19:50] But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

[02:19:54] I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded that for me

[02:19:58] It isn't over

[02:20:02] Never mind, I'll find someone like you

[02:20:09] I wish nothing but the best for you too

[02:20:16] Don't forget me, I think I'll remember you say

[02:20:23] Sometimes it lasts and lasts, but sometimes it hurts instead

[02:20:30] Sometimes it lasts and lasts, but sometimes it hurts instead

[02:20:40] You know how the time flies only

[02:20:47] Yesterday was the time of our lives

[02:20:53] We were born and raised in a summer haze

[02:21:00] Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[02:21:08] I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited

[02:21:11] But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

[02:21:15] I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded that for me

[02:21:20] It isn't over

[02:21:26] Never mind, I'll find someone like you

[02:21:32] I wish nothing but the best for you too

[02:21:39] Don't forget me, I think I'll remember you say

[02:21:46] Sometimes it lasts and lasts, but sometimes it hurts instead

[02:21:54] Nothing compares, no worries or cares

[02:21:58] Regrets and mistakes, their memories are made

[02:22:01] Who would have known how bitter and sweet this would taste

[02:22:13] Never mind, I'll find someone like you

[02:22:19] I wish nothing but the best for you

[02:22:26] Don't forget me, I think I'll remember you say

[02:22:33] Sometimes it lasts and lasts, but sometimes it hurts instead

[02:22:41] Never mind, I'll find someone like you

[02:22:47] I wish nothing but the best for you too

[02:22:54] Don't forget me, I think I'll remember you say

[02:23:08] Sometimes it lasts and lasts, but sometimes it hurts instead

[02:23:24] Never mind, I'll find someone like you

[02:23:31] I wish nothing but the best for you too

[02:23:37] Don't forget me, I think I'll remember you say

[02:23:44] Now I get high, I get high on speed

[02:23:51] Time feels funny cause I'm totally in my heart

[02:23:55] My heart can't start my heart

[02:23:59] I've got the cards coming after three

[02:24:02] Come and build back to one, oh three, my heart

[02:25:00] See, I've got trouble controlling my eyes

[02:25:03] I do look for another good time, my heart

[02:26:03] Rock the cradle of love, yes the cradle of love

[02:26:09] Well, rock the cradle of love

[02:26:17] You run the realm to a little child by a duty check

[02:26:23] So go easy, yeah

[02:26:27] Cause love comes from a little ways

[02:26:31] Shakes the devil when he misbehaves

[02:26:34] I ain't nobody's fool, come on, shake it up

[02:26:39] Ever a new round

[02:26:41] Rock the cradle of love, rock the cradle of love

[02:26:47] It's the cradle of love, don't run, easy little shoe

[02:26:53] And I won't set forever no more

[02:26:56] I tried to run, but you are the cradle of love

[02:27:00] It's the cradle of love, don't run, easy little shoe

[02:27:06] Yeah, I won't flesh for your own thing

[02:27:10] Oh, I ain't with you, I ain't your love

[02:27:14] You see there, no house, please be here

[02:27:20] Ow, cause love stunts my road and train

[02:27:24] You can't stop, it ain't in vain

[02:27:27] I ain't nobody's fool, come on, shake it up

[02:27:32] Ever a new round

[02:27:35] Rock the cradle of love, rock the cradle of love

[02:28:26] Hey, you ready?

[02:28:34] It ain't burned like a ball on fire

[02:28:38] When the rebel took a little child right to tease

[02:28:42] Yeah, no house, please be here

[02:28:47] Ow, cause my house stunts the road and train

[02:28:51] You can't stop, it ain't in vain

[02:28:54] I ain't nobody's fool, come on, shake it up

[02:28:59] Ever a new round

[02:29:02] Rock the cradle of love, rock the cradle of love

[02:29:04] I got my first real sick string

[02:29:06] Boiled it out the fire and done

[02:29:09] Played it till my fingers bled

[02:29:13] Was the summer of 69

[02:29:16] Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard

[02:29:23] Jimmy Quinn, Jody got married

[02:29:26] Should've known we never get far

[02:29:30] Oh, and I look back now

[02:29:33] The summer seemed to last forever

[02:29:37] And if I had the choice

[02:29:40] Yeah, I always wanna be there

[02:29:44] Those were the best days of my life

[02:29:55] Ain't no use in complaining

[02:29:58] When you got a job to do

[02:30:01] Spend my minutes down at the job in

[02:30:05] And that's when I met you, yeah

[02:30:08] Standing on your mama's porch

[02:30:11] You told me that you'd wait forever

[02:30:15] Oh, I'm laying on my hand

[02:30:18] I knew that it was now or never

[02:30:22] Those were the best days of my life

[02:30:27] Oh, yeah

[02:30:30] Back in the summer of 69

[02:30:39] Maybe we'll kill it in time

[02:30:42] We'll lay on your ass once

[02:30:44] We'll need it to unwind

[02:30:47] I guess nothing can last forever

[02:30:50] Forever, no

[02:30:56] Yeah

[02:31:07] And now the times are changing

[02:31:10] Look at everything that's coming down

[02:31:14] Sometimes when I play that old six-string

[02:31:17] I think about you and I wonder what went wrong

[02:31:21] Standing on your mama's porch

[02:31:24] You told me that you'd last forever

[02:31:28] Oh, yeah

[02:31:30] I knew that it was now or never

[02:31:35] Those were the best days of my life

[02:31:41] I feel a hunger, it's a hunger

[02:31:44] Trying to keep a man awake at night

[02:31:48] Are you the answer?

[02:31:50] I should wonder

[02:31:52] Well, I feel with my appetite

[02:31:55] With all the power you're releasing

[02:31:59] It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone

[02:32:03] Anticipations run through me

[02:32:06] Let's find the key and turn this engine on

[02:32:10] I can feel you breathe

[02:32:13] I can feel your heartbeat faster

[02:32:20] Take me home tonight

[02:32:23] I don't wanna let you go to your single life

[02:32:27] Take me home tonight

[02:32:30] Listen honey, just like what I said

[02:32:33] Be my little baby

[02:32:42] I care to find the times

[02:32:44] You know storms

[02:32:46] I care the numbers, I hate to sleep alone

[02:32:50] I need some company, a good angel

[02:32:53] To keep the world with a cold wind blow

[02:32:57] I can feel you breathe

[02:33:00] I can feel your heartbeat faster

[02:33:07] Take me home tonight

[02:33:10] I don't wanna let you go to your single life

[02:33:15] Take me home tonight

[02:34:01] Take me home tonight

[02:34:04] Listen honey, just like what I said

[02:34:07] Be my little baby

[02:34:09] Take me home tonight

[02:34:11] I don't wanna let you go to your single life

[02:34:15] Any way you want it

[02:34:17] That's the way you need it

[02:34:19] Any way you want it

[02:34:24] She loves to laugh

[02:34:26] She loves to sing

[02:34:28] She does everything

[02:34:31] She loves to move

[02:34:33] She loves to groove

[02:34:35] She loves to love the things

[02:34:38] All night

[02:34:40] All night

[02:34:42] Every night

[02:34:45] So hold tight

[02:34:47] Hold tight

[02:34:49] Oh baby, hold tight

[02:34:51] She said

[02:34:52] Any way you want it

[02:34:54] That's the way you need it

[02:34:56] Any way you want it

[02:34:58] She said

[02:34:59] Any way you want it

[02:35:01] That's the way you need it

[02:35:03] Any way you want it

[02:35:06] I was alone

[02:35:08] I never knew

[02:35:10] What good love could do

[03:21:29] I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

[03:21:33] In the midnight hour, I can feel your power

[03:21:37] Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

[03:21:42] I hear your voice, it's like an angel's sign

[03:21:50] I have no choice, I hear your voice

[03:21:56] Feels like flying, I close my eyes

[03:22:03] Oh God, I think I'm falling out of the sky

[03:23:39] You know I'll take you there

[03:23:43] Life is a mystery, everyone must stand on

[03:23:59] I hear you call my name

[03:24:04] And it feels like home, just like a prayer

[03:24:09] Your voice can take me there, just like a mystery

[03:24:14] You are a mystery, just like a dream

[03:24:18] You are not what you seem, just like a prayer

[03:24:22] No choice, your voice can take me there

[03:24:25] I'm never gonna say I'm sorry, I'm a plumb for everyone

[03:24:29] I'm never gonna let you down, I'm always there like a sun

[03:32:36] Ay ay ay ay ay ay

[03:32:40] I'm a live again, more alive than I have been

[03:32:50] In my whole entire life I can see these people's ears perk up

[03:32:54] As I begin to spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most

[03:32:58] Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff

[03:33:01] But I get a hard dick from this shit now, stick it in

[03:33:03] I ain't never giving in, I'll get it, cost into the win

[03:33:05] Complete freedom, look at these rappers, how I treat them

[03:33:08] So what the fuck, when I join them, would I beat them?

[03:33:10] They call me a freak, cause I like to spit on these pussies for eat em

[03:33:14] Man, get these black cock suckers off stage, what a fuck is Kanye when you need em?

[03:33:17] Snap some mic for one bitch, I'm a let-to finish in a minute, yet a raffle's tight

[03:33:21] But I'm fucked with the greatest verse of all time

[03:33:23] So you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and I'm

[03:33:25] Slippin' off them rhymes, you were gonna spit and start over

[03:33:28] Who's scratching right new ones, but I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference

[03:33:30] When I rip the stage and tear it in half tonight

[03:33:32] It's in the trill and rush, you feel the bass done from the place all the way to the parking lot

[03:33:36] Set fire to the mic, ignite the crowd

[03:33:38] You can see the sparks from hot metal

[03:33:40] Cone-hearted from the day I put guard of the game

[03:33:42] I soul-starred a rock-fellow, but I'm not even in my harshest

[03:33:45] You can still get roasted, cause it's not mellow

[03:33:47] So I'm toppling from the top, I'm not gonna stop

[03:33:49] I'm standing on my monopoly board

[03:33:51] That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop till my hip don't hop anymore

[03:33:55] When you're so good that you can't sing, cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore

[03:33:58] People just get sick, cause you spit these fools can't rule the dribble and drop anymore

[03:34:02] And you can never break my stride, you'll never slow the momentum in any moment

[03:34:05] You'll never take my pride, I'm counting the flow slow, venom in the opponent is getting old

[03:34:10] Mercy mark my words, they letting up relentless, I smell blood

[03:34:12] I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell

[03:34:14] When was you when I found this needed help, you get no love

[03:34:17] It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

[03:34:20] You kicked me when I was down, but what you say just don't hurt

[03:34:24] That's right, it's your love

[03:34:26] I don't need to know

[03:34:28] Yesterday, it was a joke but I think I was never too old

[03:34:35] Now that I'm stuck in the line, I feel I'm going to be the pride

[03:34:40] Yesterday, ain't got none of them people proud, because that's how I'm raising

[03:34:45] Time just spends the pages in my book of memories

[03:34:51] Proud in my pocket and no hand in destiny

[03:34:57] I keep on moving along with no time to plant my feet

[03:35:02] Yesterday ain't got none of them people proud, because that's how I'm raising

[03:35:07] Some things could be better, if we don't just let them be

[03:35:12] Oh, yesterday, it's got none of them for me

[03:35:20] But yesterday, oh wow

[03:35:28] It's got none of them for me

[03:35:34] It's got none of them for me

[03:35:40] But today

[03:36:20] Oh, yes, yes, you got nothing for me

[03:36:26] I get up in the evening and I ain't got nothing to say

[03:36:32] I come home in the morning, I go to bed feeling the same way

[03:36:39] I ain't nothing but tired, man I'm just tired and bored with myself

[03:36:46] Hey there, lady, I can use just a little help

[03:36:52] You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark

[03:36:58] This gun's for hire, even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:37:05] Messages keep getting clearer, radio's on and I'm moving round my place

[03:37:17] I check my look in the mirror, wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

[03:37:24] And I get nowhere, I'm just living in a dump like this

[03:37:30] There's something happening somewhere, baby I just know it is

[03:37:37] You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark

[03:37:43] This gun's for hire, even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:38:00] You're sitting around getting older, there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me

[03:38:09] I shake this world off my shoulders, come on baby, the last on me

[03:38:15] Stay on the streets of this town and they'll be carving you up alright

[03:38:22] You say you gotta stay hungry, hey baby, I'm just a fire star in the night

[03:38:29] I'm dying for some action, I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book

[03:38:35] I need a little reaction, come on baby, give me just one look

[03:38:42] You can't start a fire, sitting round, trying to get rid of the broken heart

[03:38:49] This gun's for hire, even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:38:54] It's been a long year since you've been gone

[03:39:01] I've been alone here, I've grown old

[03:39:08] I've fallen pieces, I've fallen

[03:39:15] I've fell to pieces and I'm still falling

[03:39:23] Every time I'm falling down, all alone I've grown to pieces

[03:39:40] I keep the journals with memories

[03:39:59] I feel lonely, I can't breathe

[03:40:06] I've fallen pieces, I've fallen

[03:40:13] I've fell to pieces and I'm still falling

[03:40:21] Every time I'm falling down, all alone I've fallen to pieces

[03:40:50] Every time I'm falling down, all alone I've grown to pieces

[03:41:05] All the years I've tried, we're more to go

[03:41:11] But with the memories gone, I'm waiting

[03:41:19] And will I find you? And can I find you?

[03:41:25] Waiting for falling down, I'm falling down

[03:41:39] I created a monster, there's nobody wants to see more

[03:41:42] So no more, they want shady, I'm chocolate-bun

[03:41:44] Well if you want shady, this is what I'll give you

[03:41:46] A little bit of weed makes us some heartlake

[03:41:48] I got some bark, I thought I'd jump-start my heart

[03:41:50] Quicker than a shock when I get dropped at the hospital

[03:41:52] While the doctor, when I'm not cooperating

[03:41:54] When I'm rocking the table while he's operating

[03:41:56] You waited as long as I stopped debating

[03:41:58] Cause I'm mad, come on, the brag is nobulating

[03:42:01] I know that you got a job, Miss Chaney

[03:42:03] But your husband's heart problems complicating

[03:42:05] So the FCC won't let me be, or let me be

[03:42:08] So let me see, they try to shut me down on MTV

[03:42:11] But it feels so empty without me

[03:42:13] So come on and get, bump on your lips

[03:42:15] Buck that, come on your lips, and some on your tips

[03:42:17] And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy

[03:42:19] I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, damn it

[03:42:22] Now this looks like a job for me

[03:42:24] So everybody, just follow me

[03:42:26] Cause we need a little controversy

[03:42:28] Cause it feels so empty without me

[03:42:30] I said this looks like a job for me

[03:42:32] So everybody, just follow me

[03:42:34] Cause we need a little controversy

[03:42:36] Cause it feels so empty without me

[03:42:39] Little Hellions, kids feeling rebellious

[03:42:41] And embarrassed, the parents still listening to Elvis

[03:42:43] They start feeling like prisoners helpless

[03:42:45] The summer comes along on a mission in Yelp

[03:42:47] A visionary, vision is scary

[03:42:49] Constraught a revolution, ballooning the airwaves of Rebels

[03:42:52] So just let me revel in the ass, and the fact that I got everyone

[03:42:55] Kissing my ass, and it's a disaster

[03:42:57] Such a catastrophe, but you can see so damn much of my ass

[03:43:00] You ask for me, while I'm back, nanananananananananana

[03:43:03] Fiction been a-tunin' and then I'm in a-tunin'

[03:43:05] And I'm running up on to your skin like a splitter

[03:43:07] The center of attention, that glitter with it, I'm in arresting

[03:43:10] The best things, and wrestling, and testing

[03:43:12] When your kid's ears are nesting, testing

[03:43:14] Attention, please

[03:43:15] Feel the tension, some of someone mentions me

[03:43:17] Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free

[03:43:19] And no sense, who's saying you say it's for me?

[03:43:22] Now this looks like a job for me

[03:43:24] So everybody, just follow me

[03:43:26] Cause we need a little controversy

[03:43:28] Cause it feels so empty without me

[03:43:30] I said this looks like a job for me

[03:43:32] So everybody, just follow me

[03:43:34] Cause we need a little controversy

[03:43:36] Cause it feels so empty without me

[03:43:54] Cause it feels so empty without me

[03:43:56] Without me

[03:44:12] Without you, without you

[03:44:20] I can't live, we're going to let you

[03:44:50] I just get a task in, I vote it for Tatway

[03:44:58] Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit, this Kirk Patrick

[03:45:01] You can get to ask it, worse than a little biscuit master

[03:45:04] So Moby, you can get stoned by OV

[03:45:06] 36 year old boy, in fact, no, you don't know

[03:45:10] Too old, let it go, it's over

[03:45:11] Nobody listen to techno, now let's go

[03:45:14] Just give me the signal, I'll be there when I'm homeless

[03:45:16] Falling in with salt top endo

[03:45:18] Suspense for what it takes, so never since Prince

[03:45:20] Turn himself into a symbol

[03:45:22] But sometimes this shit just seems

[03:45:24] Everybody only wants to disgust me

[03:45:26] So this must mean I'm disgusting

[03:45:28] But it's just me, I'm just a thief

[03:45:30] You know I'm not the first king, I'm not the first C

[03:45:32] I'm the worst thing, I'm not the first lead

[03:45:34] Black music, so there's a fist in

[03:45:36] And who's it to get myself worthy?

[03:45:38] Hey, that's the concept that works

[03:45:40] 20 million other white rappers emerge

[03:45:42] From the now, when you fish in the sea

[03:45:44] You're something without me

[03:45:46] Without me, yeah
