[00:00] It was only in my dreams, as real as it may seem, it was only in my dreams.

[00:30] Oh my gosh, this is not a walk in the park on this episode, let's talk about who we think

[00:36] is gonna strike first in the pinball world.

[00:39] Who's gonna create the next chapter of excitement in pinball?

[00:43] It is March 5th.

[00:45] Now you know, I've been saying this for a while now, I don't think TPF is gonna be the place.

[00:51] We're gonna see like the big new games.

[00:54] We've got Dungeons and Dragons already out from Stern.

[00:57] We've got Evil Dead from Spooky Pinball already out in the world.

[01:01] We've got Alice's Adventures in Wonderland still delayed going out one day soon from

[01:06] Dutch Pinball.

[01:08] What else?

[01:09] We've got Jersey Jack Pinball, we're waiting on Harry Potter, we're gonna talk about that.

[01:12] We've got Stern Pinball, we know King Kong is around the corner, it's crazy right, but

[01:16] it's not coming just yet.

[01:18] We're gonna have to wait until like early summer, I think for the big gorilla.

[01:22] So that leaves Texas Pinball Festival as an opportunity for someone to really steal the

[01:29] story to control the narrative of like early spring, this is gonna be the game everybody

[01:36] talks about.

[01:37] And we've been talking about what's most likely gonna be the game that strikes first is gonna

[01:41] be the barrels of fun game, but is anyone else gonna have a surprise?

[01:46] We know P3 Multimorphic is not just making new glass.

[01:50] Did you see that story?

[01:51] We're gonna make some non-reflective glass.

[01:53] I don't care like everybody, heck everybody's gonna have non-reflective glass offerings.

[01:59] Stern has non-reflective glass, JJP, I've got PDI glass on my machine, and now we're gonna

[02:05] have another option, it's good.

[02:07] I hope all the different non-reflective glass will just drive the price down of non-reflective

[02:13] glass.

[02:14] And by the way, the thing is I never envy you guys who have like 50 pinball machines with

[02:19] normal glass because the moment you put non-reflective on one of your machines, trust me, you're

[02:26] gonna want them on all of your machines.

[02:29] It's just such a nicer way to play pinball.

[02:31] So P3 Multimorphic, the rumor is that Jerry has a new title he's going to launch at Texas

[02:38] Pinball Festival, which by the way is the show that's in his backyard.

[02:43] The close companies to this show are barrels of fun, you got Multimorphic, and you've got

[02:48] Chris Turner with Turner Pinball.

[02:50] So the rumor is that he's got Portal Pinball, Portal based on the old video game where you

[02:56] go in one portal and you come out another one.

[03:00] And if you think about the P3 platform and those sort of like targets that disappear

[03:04] and the ball comes out of another one, it really is a platform that might make Portal

[03:10] a really interesting offering.

[03:12] The problem with all of Multimorphic, and that's just the fact that you wait a long time, I

[03:17] mean, he announced the Princess Bride a year ago and they still haven't sent out those

[03:22] expensive collector's edition versions of the game.

[03:26] I think what's gone out so far after a year are all the pre-orders, but I believe it's

[03:32] the pre-orders of the modules that go into existing P3 Multimorphic customer cabinets.

[03:39] I have still not heard from Jerry or anyone associated with this company.

[03:46] All I want to know is how many P3 Multimorphics this company has sold to date.

[03:56] Does nobody have that answer?

[03:59] The reason why I want to know that, I just want to know when they make just the modules

[04:05] how many of them they need to make to satiate most of the owners that are out there.

[04:10] If I had to guess, I would say this company has not sold 500 or more of cabinets of Multimorphic

[04:19] over like 12 years of the game being available.

[04:22] Maybe it's less than that, maybe it's been available commercially for about 8 years,

[04:26] but you know, Portal maybe, maybe the thing about the platform that will never change,

[04:32] whether it's WeirdOwl, whether it's Portal, whether it's Final Resistance, it doesn't matter.

[04:38] The thing is, you need to want to own not just the game that's out that gets you excited,

[04:44] you also need to be excited about the other games on the platform.

[04:49] And the one downside of the people who have committed to this platform is the moment you

[04:54] might want to get out of the platform, you might be like $20,000 or more invested into

[05:01] all of these games and you're never going to get anywhere near that back because who

[05:06] wants to absorb like 4 to 5 different modular kits for Multimorphic and the cabinet and everything

[05:13] that goes with it and now that they're starting to make unique cabinets for games like The

[05:18] Princess Bride, I just don't think it makes much sense.

[05:21] I really wish Jerry would just take a risk and make a normal pinball machine in the

[05:29] traditional way and have a theme people wanted.

[05:32] If he made The Princess Bride in a normal cabinet with someone like Francheon artwork,

[05:38] he would have sold way more than putting it on a platform like this.

[05:43] I mean that and you could still do everything that gets people excited about the game on

[05:48] a normal pinball platform.

[05:50] It's never going to happen, only in my dreams does Jerry Stelenberg just do what people

[05:55] want and be 10 times more successful.

[05:58] I mean that.

[05:59] I absolutely mean that.

[06:01] You know what?

[06:02] The world's more fun when you have dreamers like Jerry that just want to do things completely

[06:05] different.

[06:06] Remember when you were a kid and everyone had like different video game consoles and then

[06:10] one of your friends had like a 3DO.

[06:13] You're like what?

[06:14] Yeah, someone had a 3DO.

[06:15] Canada was a spoiled brat.

[06:17] I had a Neo Geo when I was a kid back in the day when Neo Geo games were 200 bucks and to

[06:22] stop me and my twin brother from going to the arcade, we came home one day and my mom put

[06:26] a Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition in the house.

[06:29] I just believe we're the most popular kids on the block with an arcade in the house and

[06:34] best believe we bought all of those friendships.

[06:37] All right, so it's not going to be portal.

[06:39] What else might happen at Texas Pinball Festival?

[06:42] Are we going to get maybe the next game from Padready Gaming?

[06:46] We don't talk about this very much, but this company is about to remake Tales of the Arabian

[06:52] Knights and even on Pinside.

[06:55] I've been telling people this.

[06:56] It's the next game from them.

[06:58] There's not a lot of interest.

[07:00] There's not a lot of conversation, but go on the Pinside Marketplace and try to find

[07:05] a Tales of the Arabian Knights game in mint condition for anywhere south of $12,000 and

[07:13] you won't find one.

[07:14] It's like these games are bolted to the floor for most collectors and I had one.

[07:19] It's a beautiful game.

[07:21] That game has more toys in it than the last four offerings from Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[07:25] No problem with the Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[07:27] Everybody knows it's very shallow.

[07:29] You can see the end of the game easily, easily within a weekend if you're a decent player

[07:35] and then it's just the same thing over and over again and then you get used to all the

[07:39] mechs and the toys and you get bored of it.

[07:41] But man, what a stunning game.

[07:43] So is that going to come out at Texas Pinball Festival?

[07:46] That game is most likely going to have the updated code.

[07:49] I don't know, right?

[07:50] The build quality of a Padrety Gaming, Bali Williams remake isn't as good as the CGC

[07:57] remakes and we know that CGC also has Twilight Zone.

[08:01] So we don't talk about this.

[08:03] This company is pretty much done with the Pulp Fiction LE production and after that, there's

[08:09] no more Pulp Fiction SEs to be made.

[08:12] Those SEs are sitting at dealers and distros as inventory inboxes.

[08:17] You could go get one today if you wanted one.

[08:19] So I think this company might surprise us and reveal the Twilight Zone.

[08:24] I mean, think about this, the Twilight Zone from Chicago Gaming Company, one of the most

[08:30] loaded games of all time.

[08:31] Pat Lawler said, this is what happens when they give you a blank check.

[08:35] You put everything and the kitchen sink into a game.

[08:39] Now that gets really interesting, right?

[08:41] A remake of Twilight Zone with all of those toys and mechs on a mech level embarrass everything

[08:47] else that's in the pinball world.

[08:49] Isn't it crazy?

[08:50] Like 30 years later, we're spending so much more money on every single game and all the

[08:55] games have a third in it as the games used to have in the mid 90s.

[09:00] Now what would be fun with this Twilight Zone remake?

[09:03] I would love it.

[09:04] I would love it if there ever was a game.

[09:06] If you could do it at the factory level, have you seen that great American pinball black

[09:10] and white edition of Twilight Zone?

[09:13] Makes total sense.

[09:15] This show was in black and white and if they made a black and white like SLE or Ellie edition

[09:21] of this game, I think that would be awesome.

[09:24] It would be a nice way to sort of create a new modern version of a classic and then you

[09:29] have the classic version of the game.

[09:30] I would give people the ability to order a black and white version.

[09:34] It's extra work for sure.

[09:36] You got to do all the scopes, all the molds, everything in black and white.

[09:39] But when you see a truly black and white game, not what Stern does where there's always like

[09:44] color added to it.

[09:46] If every single thing is black and white, it is awesome how disruptive it is when you

[09:53] put that in a modern lineup and it's like color, color, color, black and white.

[09:57] It almost looks like someone turned the world off or took us back like 80 years.

[10:02] It's absolutely so cool.

[10:04] So will it be CGC's the Twilight Zone?

[10:07] Now the thing about CGC is if they reveal Twilight Zone, are you really going to put

[10:12] a deposit down when do you actually think you're going to get your game like the day

[10:16] after you die?

[10:18] So that's CGC, Twilight Zone, maybe Padready.

[10:21] The other thing that I know they have the license, the Pimball Brothers, we never talk

[10:28] about them.

[10:29] We never talk about Queen.

[10:31] We never talk about the Ripley edition of Alien anymore.

[10:35] This company has the license to make Predator.

[10:39] The big question mark is what version of Predator?

[10:44] I highly doubt they have the Arnold and Carl Weathers classic because that's what everybody

[10:49] wants.

[10:50] That's the iconic Predator.

[10:52] There's been lots of Predator movies.

[10:54] There's been Alien vs. Predator.

[10:56] The new Predator movie Prey is absolutely amazing but that's not what you want.

[11:01] You don't want to spend eight to $10,000 on one of the later installments of Predator.

[11:07] You don't want an original Predator machine.

[11:11] You need those classic lines, Ghost Ness Mo-Fo.

[11:15] I ain't got time to bleed.

[11:17] Get to the chopper.

[11:18] I mean this is where get to the chopper comes from, right?

[11:21] I think so.

[11:22] It might come from Commandos.

[11:23] I feel like we've all been saying that line for like 40 years.

[11:27] But Predator Man, the original one, it is just iconic, everything about it.

[11:32] Obviously, there was the skit B version of the game that was an utter disaster.

[11:36] I miss those days when half a pin side said that Kevin Kulick had the license and Canada's

[11:42] Pinball podcast was telling everybody he didn't and the company was going to go under and

[11:47] there was no way this guy was going to make in his mom's basement an Arnold Schwarzenegger

[11:51] pinball machine and people said I was an idiot and to stop supporting Canada.

[11:56] I was right.

[11:57] I was right about Andrew Highway.

[11:58] I was right about Damien at Haggis Pinball.

[12:01] How many times do I say a pinball company is actually going to fail and go out of business?

[12:05] I think when I actually say that, it's come true.

[12:08] I think every time I've called it, you know, you don't hear me saying JJP is going to go

[12:12] out of business or Stern.

[12:13] It's not going to happen.

[12:14] It's not going to happen.

[12:15] All right.

[12:16] So maybe the pinball brothers is going to surprise us with Predator.

[12:21] That's pretty cool.

[12:22] They made Alien and Predator.

[12:24] I don't know.

[12:25] You don't hear anything about these guys.

[12:26] Now I will say this.

[12:28] If they don't have a banger coming, I think these guys might be done with it.

[12:34] I mean it.

[12:35] This might be done with it.

[12:36] I don't think Abba was a big seller and I don't mean like they're going to go out of

[12:39] business.

[12:40] I just mean the pinball brothers themselves who by the way are not brothers.

[12:45] I just think they're going to fall out of love with the amount of heavy lifting required

[12:51] to bring a commercial pinball machine to market, to make it safe to put in people's

[12:56] homes.

[12:57] It's so much work.

[12:58] The juice just isn't worth the squeeze anymore.

[13:01] Remember a lot of these guys got into pinball 10 years ago.

[13:05] They had stars in their eyes.

[13:07] Games were like $5,500 and the world is so different now.

[13:11] I think Alien when it first came out was $6,500 for a wide body alien machine.

[13:18] We'll see if it's the pinball brothers.

[13:20] It's not going to be anything from Stern.

[13:22] Stern's going to be D&D all in at TPF.

[13:25] Jersey Jack is not going to have Harry Potter ready.

[13:28] I want to talk about Potter for a minute because I'm really wondering when Harry Potter is

[13:34] going to be revealed.

[13:35] I heard that they are working on the reveal video for Harry Potter right now.

[13:41] Who knows how long it takes for JJP to make these $100,000 videos.

[13:46] So does that mean the game is done?

[13:49] Does it mean they have all the parts in-house?

[13:52] Is this game going to go quickly on the line?

[13:55] It's March 5th.

[13:57] If you were to ask me when do I think we will see Harry Potter revealed to the world, I

[14:05] don't think we're going to see it until the end of April at the earliest.

[14:11] So that's not that far away, but it's a two month window.

[14:16] And I know Jersey Jack wants to get that game out in front of King Kong, but trust me when

[14:22] I say this everybody.

[14:24] Jersey Jack is not worried about selling Harry Potter pinball machines.

[14:28] Stern Pinball is not worried about selling a Keith L. Wynn King Kong machine.

[14:34] Those two companies know they have ginormous hits waiting to drop.

[14:40] They could drop those games on the same day and still get enormous sales.

[14:46] Really.

[14:47] Most of you would just order both and just tell the wife the summer vacation is cancelled.

[14:52] The real company that has to be worried right now, I mean is they have to be worried about

[14:57] getting the timing right is Barrels of Fun.

[15:00] We know Barrels of Fun wants to march into TPF with a game.

[15:04] We know Barrels of Fun needs to get their game revealed and get pre-order money locked

[15:10] into that bank account that's non-refundable.

[15:12] They need to do that before Harry Potter.

[15:17] Now Potter's the big thing they need to worry about.

[15:19] Now they also don't want to have Twilight Zone revealed or Predator or anything else

[15:25] because I think after witnessing what happened with Labyrinth and we're going to make 1100

[15:31] games, they made it to 1007 I think they're going to make, but we witnessed the birth of

[15:38] a new pinball company and we witnessed the market reaction to their game.

[15:44] We witnessed the reaction to their quality, which is good.

[15:46] I don't hear a lot of quality issues with Labyrinth.

[15:49] They did the right thing.

[15:51] They established themselves as a legitimate pinball company.

[15:55] They have some great innovations in their product and they got everybody a game or will

[16:00] get everybody a game very soon.

[16:03] They are like the new spooky pinball.

[16:05] And remember for a company like this, they didn't gradually get to 1000 games in a year.

[16:11] They started there.

[16:13] The pinball went to 50, 350, 500, 750 and then 1000.

[16:19] So for barrels of fun in their first inaugural game to make 1000 machines built together

[16:25] and not burning down anyone's houses, you have to give this company credit.

[16:30] But now on your second game, the follow up game, right?

[16:34] I would say that they didn't have a hit first game.

[16:37] Would anyone argue with that?

[16:39] That barrels of funds Labyrinth isn't really like a hit.

[16:43] It's a good game for people who love the theme.

[16:46] It didn't come out and like really, really land culturally in the pinball community

[16:51] as like one of the coolest games you got to jump on.

[16:54] It just didn't.

[16:55] But now we know they can make it and manufacturing is the hard part.

[17:00] I think all eyes are on them.

[17:03] Are they going to release a second game that's going to get us more excited, get our blood

[17:08] going and look, this is going to happen.

[17:11] This is going to be the one that is going to happen, I think in the next four weeks

[17:16] because they need to get out before April.

[17:19] They have no idea when Jersey Jack's going to hit with Potter.

[17:23] The whole thing is funny to me because JJP is a little bit nervous probably about going

[17:28] up against Keith Elwyn.

[17:29] So they want to get out in front of Elwyn, but they don't know when Elwyn's going to

[17:33] drop.

[17:34] It's easy to kind of guess when Elwyn's going to drop because it's usually four months

[17:37] after D&D drops.

[17:39] Stern does three cornerstones a year and they're four months apart.

[17:43] So if D&D came out in January, February, March, April, then you're looking at May for King

[17:49] Kong, which gives you all of now until May to get Harry Potter out.

[17:55] So they know that.

[17:56] So all we got to do is get our thing out before then.

[17:59] I also know that Jersey Jack must want to have some Harry Potter's on the line, not

[18:05] make people wait a few months.

[18:07] If this company makes collector's edition, people wait six months after reveal to get

[18:13] the game.

[18:14] What are we doing JJP?

[18:16] Just get the CEs on the line right away.

[18:20] Get them to customers.

[18:21] And you know, we're so used to being guinea pigs.

[18:24] We don't even care anymore.

[18:26] We don't even care anymore.

[18:27] Like we know there's going to be issues.

[18:29] Just let us have the product and we know that Harry Potter.

[18:32] The good thing about Potter is this.

[18:34] Jersey Jack pinball ships their games.

[18:37] They don't reveal a game until the code is pretty much complete.

[18:42] And then they make you wait six years for the final wizard mode that you're not good

[18:45] enough to ever see.

[18:47] But that's always been their MO, right?

[18:49] 99% done on day one and still 99% done on day like 900.

[18:55] I don't know why they do it that way.

[18:57] I don't know why Keith just can't finish the last question on the test, but that's how

[19:02] they do it.

[19:03] What's interesting is like everyone knows Kong's sort of tentative date.

[19:07] Then we don't know Harry Potter.

[19:09] And then you've got barrels of fun trying to sort of guess when Potter's going to drop

[19:15] and give themselves enough of a window to have a little bit of a moment on the stage

[19:19] before all the attention goes to Harry Potter.

[19:22] Now David Van Es is a smart guy and he's like, Chris, I don't want to reveal this game or

[19:27] release it until we're ready.

[19:30] Well, they might have to wake up to a little bit of market reality.

[19:34] You might have to reveal this game before it is on the line and you might even need

[19:39] a couple months to get it ready.

[19:41] But what you just need, David, is a theme people want and you need a good showing.

[19:47] Nobody is worried about whether or not barrels of fun can make a game.

[19:52] We know you can.

[19:54] Anything you show us in the video, we will have 100% confidence that that will work.

[20:00] And be in the game.

[20:02] The one thing you might not be able to do is show us code.

[20:05] Code might be early on, but David and team over there where you've been, has that ever

[20:10] stopped anybody from ordering a pinball machine?

[20:13] This community would buy a game that hasn't even been put in a damn cabinet yet.

[20:17] So I think this company is going to reveal their game, not a TPF.

[20:22] I don't think they're going to make it.

[20:24] I think they're going to be early April at MGC.

[20:27] And I think that's something like April 5th or something.

[20:30] And I think that's when we're going to see the new game from Barrels of Fun game.

[20:34] That's only 30 days from now.

[20:36] That means between now and then you get to enjoy somewhere in the vicinity of 15 more,

[20:44] maybe 10 more episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast, and then we will have the new game

[20:49] from Barrels of Fun.

[20:51] So I look forward to keeping you entertained and making it easier to be patient as you

[20:56] enjoy.

[20:57] Barrels only Pinball Podcaster doing Pinball Podcast as he recovers from hernia surgery.

[21:04] Let's go put an ice pack between my legs and cry myself to sleep.

[21:08] Everybody have a great night.

[21:09] We'll talk to you soon.

[21:10] No, no, no, no, only in my dreams.

[21:11] As real as it may seem, it was only in my dreams.

[21:12] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[21:13] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[21:14] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
