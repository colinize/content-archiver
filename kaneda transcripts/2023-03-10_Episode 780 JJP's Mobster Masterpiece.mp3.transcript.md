[00:00] I'm gonna tell everybody, I know, that I'm moving to Nashville,

[00:08] I get all my goodbyes, well, outta the way,

[00:13] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA

[00:17] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] I'm your host, Kaneda, and I want to talk about The Godfather.

[00:25] And I want to talk about my feelings on this game after seeing Carl over at IE Pinball

[00:30] stream this game for, I think, multiple hours.

[00:33] I saw one hour of the game.

[00:35] I saw the stream.

[00:36] I saw more than enough to give you my first impressions on this game, but I also want

[00:41] to tell you what I've done.

[00:42] I've sort of zoomed out a little bit, and I want to approach what I'm about to do on

[00:46] this podcast in a much more sort of balanced and intellectual way.

[00:51] Because I do firmly believe that you can hold two opposing beliefs in your head at the same

[00:56] time and still function and still move forward.

[00:59] And I have a lot of opposing feelings about this game.

[01:03] And it doesn't mean I don't think the game is fun.

[01:06] It doesn't mean I don't think you'll enjoy the game.

[01:09] It doesn't mean Jersey Jack delivered a total masterpiece or a total turd.

[01:14] But I want to give you the way I've been approaching this game, the way I've been feeling about

[01:19] this game, and also what I've gathered from many of my trusted friends in the pinball

[01:24] community.

[01:25] Because nobody can watch a pinball machine being streamed without a lot of different

[01:30] bias and opinions coming at them, right?

[01:33] So look, for example, I have people who have already ordered this game without even seeing

[01:37] anything on it.

[01:39] I have people who have told me they will never buy this game.

[01:42] I have really good friends who've sent deposits and now they're seeing the game and they're

[01:46] not sure if they want it.

[01:48] I have people who sent deposits and they're over the moon and they're arguing with everyone

[01:52] else who doesn't love the game how great the game is.

[01:55] And meanwhile, only a handful of people have played the game.

[01:59] I love Christopher Franci's artwork.

[02:01] I only own two pinball machines on planet Earth.

[02:03] I own an Eric Minier game and I own a Batman 66 SLE again in which I have one more payment

[02:10] or two more payments and the game is mine.

[02:12] But I think Christopher Franci is one of the most talented artists in pinball.

[02:16] And so as I approach this game, knowing that I have a designer who I appreciate making this

[02:21] game, an artist who I really appreciate who's done the artwork on the game, and many friends

[02:27] of mine who are invested in this game or this game triggers anger from them, I've been

[02:32] absorbing all of it.

[02:34] And I want to give you my feelings after watching the game being streamed because two days ago,

[02:39] we got a 90 second video where it looked like it was Willy Wonka noise and it was lit up

[02:44] like a rainbow and everybody was reacting to that.

[02:47] Now obviously Carl gave us a much deeper dive into the game and he showed us what the modes

[02:53] are like.

[02:54] He showed us how often there are multi balls.

[02:56] He showed us the shots, the diverters, everything that's in this game.

[03:00] And here's what I'm going to do right now.

[03:01] I am looking at this game right now as Canada, a man who has been part of this hobby for

[03:07] almost a decade.

[03:08] I've seen a lot of pinball games come out.

[03:10] I've seen a lot of reactions to pinball machines.

[03:13] I've seen more than enough discussion about pinball to last a thousand lifetimes.

[03:18] And here are my feelings on the game and I'm going to explain how I have opposing forces

[03:23] in my head as I think about Jersey Jack pinball number eight being the Godfather pinball.

[03:30] I'm going to start right away by saying this.

[03:32] I think Jersey Jack pinball made one heck of a mobster themed pinball machine.

[03:37] This game looks like a really fun mobster pinball machine.

[03:41] It just does.

[03:42] It's got the Tommy guns.

[03:43] It's got all the different call outs from mob bosses.

[03:46] It's talking to you as if you're building your gang family and you're going around this

[03:50] city, right?

[03:51] And you want to take over all the power and the boroughs and become the ultimate dawn

[03:56] in this city of New York.

[03:57] And on that level, I'm like, yeah, like it works.

[04:00] Like this is totally feeling like a modern day kingpin, a modern day mobster pinball

[04:07] machine.

[04:08] And on that level, this game is absolutely hitting it out of the park.

[04:13] And I felt that way.

[04:14] I'm like, what an amazing mobster pinball machine.

[04:17] All right.

[04:18] Now I want to play a little bit of what the opposing forces inside my head around this

[04:22] game as a Godfather pinball machine, right?

[04:25] A pinball machine that is paying homage to one of the most iconic movies of all time

[04:31] is paying homage to the 50th anniversary of the Godfather movie.

[04:36] On that level, I think this is one of the worst theme-integrated pinball machines I've

[04:41] ever encountered.

[04:42] And I'll explain why.

[04:44] Nothing about what I love in that movie or what makes that movie iconic is coming through

[04:49] on any level in this game.

[04:52] That movie is all about iconic scenes.

[04:55] And you never get any of that in this pinball machine.

[04:59] They don't give you anything more than just a few seconds at a time.

[05:02] It's more filling the gaps between the kingpin code than it is actually letting you experience

[05:08] the iconic scenes from the movie.

[05:11] And I was watching for an entire hour and I was like, oh my gosh, like there really

[05:16] is like hardly any the Godfather the movie in this game.

[05:21] And this code is pretty much done.

[05:23] It is not going to change.

[05:24] I feel like there's less about this movie in this game than there is even of Pirates

[05:29] of the Caribbean in Pirates of the Caribbean because at least with Pirates of the Caribbean,

[05:34] you got the actor from the movie doing all of the call-outs.

[05:37] And I mean it when I say it, like if I love the Godfather and I saw a pinball machine

[05:42] called the Godfather and I walked up to it and it said the Godfather and I plunged this

[05:47] machine, I would be really confused what is going on in the machine itself.

[05:53] And I've played so many pinball machines based on movies.

[05:56] I've played so many pinball machines based on TV shows and different things and properties.

[06:01] And look, and I heard Eric Minier during his interview say like all of the iconic scenes

[06:06] from the movie synced up with the video clips are going to be in this game.

[06:11] And I think that was one of the most misleading statements I've heard anyone say about what's

[06:15] going to be in the game.

[06:17] Look, the iconic scenes are not in this game.

[06:21] You don't play any of those iconic scenes.

[06:24] They just randomly happen in the game as you're going through this completely different mobster

[06:30] storyline.

[06:31] And it's just so weird to me.

[06:33] It's like the main entree in this game isn't even the Godfather.

[06:37] I'm going to talk about that a little bit more.

[06:39] And I said it last night on my Facebook Live, if they had called this pinball machine Dick

[06:44] Tracy and they got the Dick Tracy license and made Dick Tracy pinball.

[06:48] This would have been one of the coolest games ever.

[06:50] It would have been one of the coolest theme integrated pins ever.

[06:52] And I just want to say this to everyone out there who's listening to this right now.

[06:56] And I was in the chat and I was listening to people and I am so shocked by people in

[07:01] this community all of a sudden acting like it doesn't matter how well the theme is integrated

[07:07] into the pinball machine.

[07:08] I'm shocked by the amount of apologists who are saying, yeah, they did a great job integrating

[07:13] the Godfather.

[07:14] No, they did not.

[07:16] No, they did not.

[07:17] They did not do a good job.

[07:18] I've heard people bring up Jurassic Park being like, this is like Jurassic Park and what

[07:22] Stern did with Jurassic Park.

[07:24] No, it's not.

[07:26] Stern did a completely separate Jurassic Park adventure.

[07:29] And I guess maybe this game is trying to be a completely different like Godfather adventure.

[07:34] Okay, but think about Jurassic Park for a minute.

[07:37] Stern did not put in movie clips from the Jurassic Park movie all throughout the game,

[07:41] but just used them in a weird way that's not the modes of the game.

[07:46] And I keep thinking about the Godfather movie.

[07:48] Let me give you an example of Godfather, the movie that I just don't understand why they

[07:51] didn't even attempt to make a game where you play through the iconic modes of Godfather.

[07:57] You remember the scene with the horse head?

[07:59] Remember when Robert Duvall goes there and he's representing the Don?

[08:03] Remember when he's talking to the movie producer about getting Johnny Fontaine the part in

[08:07] the movie and they're sitting down at the dinner table and the movie producer is screaming

[08:11] at him how he's never going to let this happen.

[08:14] He's using all sorts of expletives.

[08:16] Why couldn't that have been a mode in this game where you are playing and you're hitting

[08:20] the shots and you're getting through that scene?

[08:22] You can still have energetic shots.

[08:25] You could still have some vibrancy in the gameplay, but at least you'll be playing through

[08:29] that iconic scene in the movie to get to the part where when you complete that mode, the

[08:34] guy wakes up with the horse head in his bed and then you have the iconic Godfather movie

[08:40] coming through in pinball format and none of that is there.

[08:45] Alright, let me go on to what I like and don't like about the game again.

[08:49] I really like the layout.

[08:50] I think this is one of Jersey Jack's best shooting games to date.

[08:55] The layout is absolutely incredible.

[08:57] The shots look totally fun.

[08:59] They look fast.

[09:00] There's a lot of flow in this game.

[09:02] If there's been one knock on Jersey Jack pinball, it's that their games don't flow very well.

[09:07] There's a lot of stop and go.

[09:08] And Eric Minier heard that feedback and he made what I think is one of the fastest shooting

[09:13] Jersey Jack pinball machines to date.

[09:15] And it was really fun watching Carl shoot this machine.

[09:19] But then what I don't like about the game is I look down at the game and I'm like,

[09:23] where are the toys?

[09:24] Where is the innovation?

[09:25] And see, this is the big debate now.

[09:27] We use the word mechanisms.

[09:29] Where's the mech in the game?

[09:30] But I think I want to use the word where are the toys in the game?

[09:34] Where's the Godzilla building?

[09:36] Where's the Godzilla bridge?

[09:37] Where's mech a Godzilla with the magnet?

[09:39] Where's the Godzilla magnet that throws the ball into the upper flipper?

[09:43] So when you look at this game and you play this game and I say to you, where are the

[09:48] toys in Godfather Pinball?

[09:51] You will probably only have one toy in the game, which is the guy with the Tommy gun

[09:57] and the spinning disc underneath him.

[09:59] There are no more toys in this game.

[10:02] And if we start considering diverters to be toys in pinball, we're in big trouble, ladies

[10:09] and gentlemen.

[10:10] So as I look down at this game, and I know there's a lot of little things in it that

[10:14] change the pathway of the ball, but that's it.

[10:17] A $15,000 pinball machine, a $12,000 pinball machine has absolutely hardly any innovation

[10:25] in it.

[10:26] Hardly any toys in the game itself.

[10:29] There's more going on in the Pirates of the Caribbean upper playfield from a toy standpoint

[10:35] than is going on in all of Godfather from a toy standpoint.

[10:40] You're not going to get this satisfying thing seeing a diverter happen that you're not even

[10:46] seeing.

[10:47] You're shooting the ball into different places and then it's diverting the ball in a way

[10:50] you don't even see.

[10:51] That's not that enjoyable.

[10:53] And so knowing Eric Minier has the ability to load up a game and use his engineering

[10:58] skillset to make real toys in pinball, I'm highly disappointed by the lack of toys in

[11:04] the game.

[11:05] And when I look down at this game, it still feels like one of Jersey Jack pinball's most

[11:11] barren machines.

[11:12] And that is why I am also utterly disappointed when I read the comments from people who keep

[11:18] saying stuff like, this game is packed.

[11:21] How is this game packed?

[11:23] If this game is packed, then what is theater of magic?

[11:26] What is freaking like medieval madness?

[11:29] What is freaking twilight zone?

[11:31] What is Godzilla if this game is packed?

[11:34] The truth is it's not packed.

[11:37] It's got great flow, a lot of ball paths, a lot of interesting diverters going on, but

[11:43] it is not a packed pinball machine.

[11:45] And then I feel like if Jersey Jack is going to sell me a game that doesn't really integrate

[11:51] the theme that well and then also doesn't have much in it mechanically, that is that

[11:56] interesting or innovative or a real toy, then how can we be dropping 12 to $15,000 on these

[12:03] machines?

[12:04] You see, I'm torn, right?

[12:05] The game has great flow.

[12:07] It's going to be Jersey Jack pinball's best shooting game ever.

[12:10] So yeah, and then what's going to happen is this, ladies and gentlemen, this is pinball

[12:13] in the modern day.

[12:14] People are going to say it shoots great.

[12:16] The flow is great.

[12:17] It's a lot of fun to shoot.

[12:19] And because it's a lot of fun to shoot, I will absolutely give this game immunity from

[12:25] having toys.

[12:27] I will give it immunity for having good theme integration just because it shoots well.

[12:33] And this is what these companies want.

[12:35] This is what these distributors want who make videos selling you these games.

[12:39] They want you to think flow equals fun equals buy the game now because then these games

[12:46] can hide their lack of mechanical engineering with artwork.

[12:51] And what is Jersey Jack doing now, right?

[12:53] To hide the lack of toys in a game.

[12:56] They're hiding that with light shows that are over the top.

[12:59] They're hiding it with beautiful artwork.

[13:02] But that doesn't make up what should be in a modern pinball machine that is now 12 to

[13:08] $15,000.

[13:10] And look, this is also the first Jersey Jack pinball machine that doesn't even have an

[13:15] LCD screen underneath the glass.

[13:18] Now look, I don't like the way they used it in Toy Story, but they've been very creative

[13:23] with how they've used LCDs under the glass in other games, but we don't get any of that

[13:28] in Godfather.

[13:29] So they've yanked that out.

[13:31] They have only one real toy in the game.

[13:33] And people are saying this game is packed.

[13:35] It's the best Dick Tracy pinball machine Jersey Jack pinball ever could have made.

[13:40] It's not the best Godfather pinball machine by any means.

[13:43] All right, so then I look at the artwork and I'm watching the stream last night and everyone

[13:47] saying, Franchi, you killed it on the artwork.

[13:50] Franchi, you crushed it on the play field.

[13:52] This is Christopher Franchi's greatest play field of all time.

[13:55] And there's only one problem with that.

[13:58] Christopher Franchi didn't do the play field of the game.

[14:01] The game's play field was done by Jean-Paul DeWynne and what's his name?

[14:06] Jesper, whatever that guy's name is.

[14:08] I think maybe Franchi did some of the characters that they dropped onto the play field, but

[14:11] he did not do the play field.

[14:14] Okay, so that's another thing.

[14:15] I'm like, wow.

[14:16] Okay.

[14:17] So that's the end of this game.

[14:18] All right, so but the cabinet looks beautiful.

[14:20] The play field is nice.

[14:21] It's not as nice as the Munsters though.

[14:23] And people are like, this is your greatest game ever, Mr. Franchi.

[14:26] And again, it's subjective, but I don't think it is.

[14:28] I don't think this looks better than the Munsters.

[14:30] And then as I was watching the stream, right, then we get to the call outs of the game.

[14:35] And I'm just reading people in the chat as Carl is playing.

[14:38] And I was so surprised to see the following comments.

[14:42] Somebody said, these are the greatest call outs in pinball ever.

[14:45] And then another person says, these call outs are horrible.

[14:47] And you see how polarizing this game is.

[14:50] Like some people love it.

[14:51] Some people hate it.

[14:52] And look, my opinion about the call outs again, the call outs are great if you're just making

[14:57] a generic mobster game.

[14:59] If you're making the Godfather pinball, I think the call outs are pretty damn bad.

[15:04] Then again, it's like how you approach this game is how you will feel about it.

[15:10] And I've been taking so many punches from friends of mine who have ordered this game.

[15:14] There's another thing in pinball people.

[15:16] Whenever somebody orders something, they've made up their mind.

[15:20] They're committed to buying it.

[15:22] They will defend it at any cost.

[15:25] And the same is true for people who know they don't want it.

[15:28] Like they might slam it over and over and over again.

[15:31] My good friend, Derek, is like, you're really hard on the Godfather.

[15:34] You're too hard on the Godfather.

[15:36] And this is the other thing I want to say.

[15:38] All of a sudden, this theme that nobody wanted, right, nobody wanted the Godfather.

[15:43] All of a sudden now everybody is treating it like some fragile, precious thing that

[15:48] we're not allowed to say we're not happy with the way Jersey Jack made the Godfather.

[15:53] And the reason why we're not happy with the Godfather for those of us who are not happy

[15:57] is Godfather was a bad theme to begin with.

[16:01] Because how many people go see the Godfather and walk out of that movie and say, hey, that

[16:06] was a fun movie.

[16:07] Nobody.

[16:08] It's not meant to be a fun movie.

[16:10] And so then if you're trying to make a pinball machine based on it and your creative direction,

[16:15] which we heard from Eric Minier and we heard from Keith Johnson, if your creative direction

[16:20] was to make a fun, bright pinball machine based on the Godfather, because that's the

[16:25] only way you could turn the Godfather into a pinball machine, I'm here to tell you right

[16:30] now, if they pitched that to me, I would have said, no, we are not doing that.

[16:34] At least try to make it work.

[16:37] Go watch that movie.

[16:38] Watch it 10 times each.

[16:40] And you're telling me with all the different movie pinball machines that have come out

[16:44] in the world, and you're telling me, look at what Lyman did with the Batman clips.

[16:49] You're telling me, you can't take this movie, find all the iconic scenes in this movie,

[16:55] and you can't create modes around this movie and then add some pinball energy to it, and

[17:00] you can't make that work.

[17:02] Did they even try it?

[17:04] It really feels like they almost have absolutely no assets to this game.

[17:09] You're not seeing all the iconic actors in the clips.

[17:12] And the other part is this.

[17:13] Do you know when you license something, you can also license it in which you only get

[17:18] a certain amount of footage.

[17:21] And I mean like time duration of footage.

[17:24] And when I look at this game, it feels like that.

[17:27] It feels like Jersey Jack licensed like 10 minutes of the Godfather movie.

[17:32] I feel like it.

[17:33] I feel like they only license a certain amount.

[17:35] And it's just so weird to me.

[17:37] Every time I watch the stream, I just don't feel that movie coming at me.

[17:42] Alright, now let's talk about the code and the multi-ball.

[17:44] I mean, this is another thing.

[17:46] It's like once again, Eric has made a very multi-ball heavy game.

[17:51] And when I talk to my friend Derek, he's like, that's Eric's signature.

[17:55] Like he makes multi-ball games that you stack the multi-balls on top of each other.

[17:59] And when you know the rules, Derek tells me it's very rewarding.

[18:03] And he gets very mad at me.

[18:04] He's like, Chris, you never want to take the time to learn the rules.

[18:08] And when I was watching Carl play and looking at the LCD screen, I could see like everything

[18:12] they're going for, the stained glass window, four separate windows to the side.

[18:18] Then there was like all these bars on the stained glass window that were filling up.

[18:22] It's just a lot to get your head around.

[18:26] And this game is perfect for people who like those kinds of rule sets.

[18:32] Jersey Jack Pinball makes rule sets like this.

[18:35] They are very polarizing.

[18:37] You either like it or you probably don't.

[18:40] It is radically different than how Stern Pinball codes a game.

[18:44] It is radically different than how Lyman sheets codes a game.

[18:48] And look, personally, I don't like the way Jersey Jack overbakes the code.

[18:54] I don't want there to be 22 patches in Guns N' Roses.

[18:58] I don't want to have to select 22 characters in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[19:05] And I think because they've got this big screen, it's like they're always trying to figure

[19:10] out how much they can layer into the code and put up on that screen.

[19:14] And I get it, Derek, I understand you're probably turning off the show now.

[19:19] And I get it.

[19:20] If you study the code and you know what's up there, but man, most people that play Pinball,

[19:25] they don't want it to be that complex.

[19:28] It's like Jersey Jack Pinball is turning itself into a company that is really only

[19:33] making games for a subculture within the Pinball culture.

[19:37] And when I look at a game like Foo Fighters and I look at what they did with the code

[19:41] and what they did with the animations, it's a million times easier to understand how to

[19:48] play the Foo Fighters, how to look at the Foo Fighters screen and enjoy what they put

[19:53] up on the screen.

[19:55] And I know it.

[19:56] D-Jack makes everything beautiful.

[19:59] Everything they do is so beautiful.

[20:00] The LCD is beautiful.

[20:02] The play field is beautiful.

[20:03] The gold armor, the gold sparkle, everything is beautiful.

[20:07] But to me, it's like the equivalent of wearing all of your beautiful clothes at the same

[20:13] time.

[20:14] It doesn't make it better.

[20:17] It doesn't make you more fashionable.

[20:19] It doesn't make you look good.

[20:21] And the same is true with the light shows.

[20:23] Once again, this like rainbow daisy chain of lights in which, and I will say it wasn't

[20:29] nearly as bad as it was in the first stream, but there are still screen grabs going around

[20:36] of this just rainbow bright world that's going nuts.

[20:41] And usually that happens during Eric's multi-balls and once again we have a game that is clearly

[20:47] multi-ball heavy.

[20:48] Now look, the multi-balls in this game don't seem as annoying as in Guns N' Roses because

[20:54] a lot of the shots in this game are further up the play field.

[20:57] So I think it's a lot more enjoyable to play this game when multi-ball gets turned on.

[21:03] And that's probably why people are going to have a better time shooting this game than

[21:06] Guns N' Roses.

[21:08] But that being said, at some point Jersey Jack pinball needs to start listening to the

[21:13] feedback about the multi-balls, about the rainbow-colored lights, about how they integrate

[21:19] a theme into pinball.

[21:21] You know Jack got up there at Texas like two years ago and said nobody theme integrates

[21:26] better than us and I think that's absolutely not the case.

[21:30] Alright so look, so look it's the best Dick Tracy pinball machine ever made that sits inside

[21:36] a godfather cabinet.

[21:38] Now you might hate me right now if you ordered the game.

[21:41] Please don't hate me.

[21:42] I'm happy if you like this game.

[21:44] I'm happy if you've ordered this game.

[21:47] I have Guns N' Roses in a box.

[21:49] I love Guns N' Roses.

[21:50] I will never sell Guns N' Roses regardless of how good or bad it shoots because it's

[21:55] my favorite band of all time.

[21:58] And that's my thing about Godfathers.

[22:00] You might hang on to it because it shoots well, but I think anyone that really loves

[22:04] the Godfather movie is going to be sorely disappointed in how that movie comes through

[22:09] in the pinball game.

[22:11] Let's just zoom out again a little bit.

[22:13] There's like six or seven games coming out in one month.

[22:17] There are more than enough games for everybody and we shouldn't kill each other.

[22:22] If Canadian doesn't like one game, that's okay.

[22:25] I don't have a personal vendetta against Jersey Jack pinball.

[22:29] This just isn't the game for me.

[22:31] It doesn't speak to me.

[22:33] I think there's a lot of valuable feedback Jersey Jack needs to hear and not just listen

[22:38] to the fanboys because again, they need to sell this game for six to eight months before

[22:44] Steve Richie's Elton John comes out and looking at this Godfather.

[22:48] I'm just going to make a prediction.

[22:49] I think people are going to get this into their homes.

[22:52] I think they're going to enjoy it.

[22:53] I think the callouts are going to start to get annoying.

[22:56] And I think because of the lack of theme integration of Godfather, I think you're going to see

[23:01] this game leave people's collections sooner than later.

[23:05] And once again, Jersey Jack pinball doesn't have the collector's editions on the line.

[23:11] And that's my other big fear for this launch.

[23:13] This happens almost with every Jersey Jack game now.

[23:15] The LEDs are out for maybe two months before the CEs start getting made.

[23:20] Hopefully, they make the CEs sooner.

[23:22] They really need to get the CEs to buyers.

[23:25] Will they sell all thousand CEs?

[23:27] I'm going to be honest.

[23:28] I don't care.

[23:29] I'm not an investor in Jersey Jack pinball and neither are you.

[23:33] I don't wake up and just want to make my distributor friends money.

[23:37] All right.

[23:38] I mean, it's so weird this hobby now.

[23:39] Like every time a new game comes out, we are endlessly spammed by every single distributor

[23:44] on social media.

[23:46] You know when Chevy releases a new car?

[23:48] Imagine if every single Chevy dealership was spamming Facebook trying to get you to buy

[23:53] their Corvette, not the other dealership's Corvette, my Corvette.

[23:57] I think the whole pinball industry is oversaturated.

[24:00] I think the whole model of distributors is getting a little bit outdated.

[24:04] There's too many of them.

[24:06] They're all fighting over each other for sales.

[24:08] I think the first introduction to a game being a distributor's content is something

[24:13] I would just take with a grain of salt.

[24:15] They're trying to sell you the game.

[24:17] I mean, I just find it funny.

[24:18] I watched Greg and Zach's first impressions of the game and I'm just thinking to myself,

[24:22] it's nothing against them.

[24:24] But what do you think they're going to tell you?

[24:26] What do you think their first impression is going to be of a game in which they are best

[24:31] friends with the company that made the game?

[24:34] You just got to remember that.

[24:36] Nobody's friends with Canada, right?

[24:38] Nobody!

[24:39] And I gave glowing feedback to Foo Fighters because that one I had no expectations on

[24:43] and it blew me away.

[24:45] Godfather, I didn't have expectations either, but it's not blowing me away.

[24:49] It's really strange the way they executed it.

[24:52] Look, and that's why you're here because I will call it both ways and I am going to

[24:57] have a hard time walking around TPF because people are going to want to kill me this year.

[25:02] But everybody, look, it's just pinball.

[25:05] If you knew what I just went through in my personal life, you would realize how inane

[25:09] and trivial all of this is.

[25:11] And I will talk to you guys in Texas and I'll share some of that with you.

[25:15] But just remember, we are here to have fun.

[25:18] We are here to analyze these games.

[25:20] At these prices, I mean it, at these prices, nothing should be a compromise in pinball.

[25:27] Every theme should be integrated amazingly well.

[25:31] Every game should have a few amazing toys in it.

[25:33] Every game should have amazing artwork.

[25:35] Every game should come with a freaking topper, ladies and gentlemen.

[25:39] We'll talk to you soon.

[25:40] Enjoy your weekends and make sure you join the Saturday morning spectacular tomorrow because

[25:45] we're going to pick which cargo shorts or Brazilian shorts Canada wears to this year's

[25:50] Twippies later.

[25:51] I hate it out this way.

[26:21] I hate it out this way.
