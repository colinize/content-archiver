[00:00] Hi, welcome to Highway Pimble. I'm Andrew Highway CEO for Highway Pimble

[00:04] and I'm just going to give you a show around and give you a few updates from the factory here.

[00:08] So here I've got two items here. I have a hex post here and I have a bumper post here.

[00:12] Everyone did how these are made? Well take a look behind me. This machine has just been purchased

[00:18] and within the next week we'll be making a lot of our metal parts, such as our hex post and our bumper posts.

[00:30] Show of hands out there. How many of you care about how a hex post and a bumper post is made?

[00:36] I don't think there'd be too many hands going up but on this little Saturday morning edition of

[00:42] Canadian Pimble podcast I want to continue our conversation on Highway Pimble because there was

[00:47] a news update. There was a video that went up late Friday that showed a little bit of a production

[00:53] tour of the factory. Want to talk about that? Want to talk about Batman 66? Want to talk a little

[00:59] bit about M&R and what's going on with that game and then maybe we'll talk about some other stuff

[01:04] that's popping in the Pimble world. But let's start with this production video. Now I have to say this.

[01:11] What we said on our last podcast was that there's just been a lot of communication by Highway Pimble

[01:18] and they frequently failed to deliver what they said they were going to deliver on certain dates

[01:25] and also deliver people's refunds and all different types of things that lead me to believe that

[01:32] people should be asking tough questions on Pinside and to Andrew Highway and Highway Pimble about

[01:39] what's the state of the game. I think everyone can agree that we are at a point where people should

[01:47] be looking at this thing with a little caution. Not like not tons and tons of caution the way people

[01:56] were looking at predator but I think people have the right to be asking questions. And I've also

[02:02] said this in the past that I think we're at a point where when Highway says they're going to do

[02:06] something by a certain date they have to hit that milestone. And so the advice has been to just

[02:13] don't give dates and don't say you're going to do things unless you do them. I mean it's just

[02:18] that simple. I think when you're two years delayed you have to deliver what you say you're going

[02:24] to deliver now. So last week we were told that by this week we would get a video of gameplay like a

[02:33] new video that shows how the game the game is the game in action right we'd see more of modes

[02:39] and see how the game is all integrated. So Friday comes. Oh and besides that we also told games

[02:45] we're going to go out this week don't don't let's not forget what we've been told. So the week goes

[02:50] by it's Friday and people are like waiting for the gameplay video it's in the thread you can read

[02:54] where is the gameplay video where is the gameplay video. Nothing comes out nothing comes out nothing

[03:00] comes out and then eventually we get a video of Andrew taking us on a tour of the factory at

[03:09] end of day Friday right. So this video goes up on end of day Friday and remember Andrew's in the

[03:15] UK so he's what like five six hours ahead of us. So these videos are going up late late at night

[03:24] early in the morning UK time. So let's just right there we you didn't get what he said you were

[03:32] going to get right. He didn't get your your gameplay video at all. You got a production tour video.

[03:37] So he puts that up it gets all up votes everyone is saying great game looks amazing game looks

[03:44] incredible all this stuff and I think that I look at this stuff a little bit differently right because

[03:51] I think most people on the thread are in on it and they're seeing what they want to see and they're

[03:57] believing what they want to believe now I want to play a little bit of devil's advocate on this video.

[04:02] I just want to just do it for conversation sake right I'm not going to be mean I'm not going

[04:07] to be nasty. I'm just going to ask some tough questions about the production video that nobody else

[04:14] asked on the thread and it also makes me scratch my head that why after watching that video

[04:21] everyone comes away with nothing but optimism because I think you could also look at this video

[04:27] look at it a little bit more closely and ask yourself some serious questions about when you think

[04:34] this game is going to be ready to go out right okay so let's start with the the way the video very

[04:40] like begins with this ginormous machine they've just just purchased to make hex post and bumper post

[04:50] okay so when was this machine purchased are are these part like why like when you when he holds up

[04:56] those two parts and he's like here the two parts that this machine can make the first thought on

[05:01] my head is why would you buy an expensive machine to make those parts like why wouldn't you just

[05:09] get a vendor who makes metal parts like that and order them right why would you have to make your

[05:15] own in house that's not the kind of part that you need to manufacture in house because it's like

[05:22] highly specialized or whatnot so the devil's advocate in me when maybe jump to a conclusion that

[05:31] they got to do everything internally because maybe there's not tons of money to go out to vendors

[05:37] to order these things why buy an expensive piece of machinery like that it just seems like a

[05:43] superfluous thing to do I just I don't know I don't know that machine to make those parts

[05:51] and and and he says to me I'm making these parts in like in the coming weeks weeks whenever you

[05:56] hear that word weeks it just equals delays okay so that big machine is there not really sure so I

[06:03] think the part that gets people the most excited is they see games on the line so he does a little

[06:09] walk around the factory and there's a bunch of full throttles on this assembly line and then

[06:14] there's a bunch of aliens right there's probably about maybe five full throttles and then two rows

[06:21] of aliens maybe five or ten in each row and the first thing that strikes me when I see this factory

[06:27] torn and and and even after he chose us that big piece of machinery the first thing that pops into

[06:33] my head in Andrew pinballs showing us inside the factory at highway pinball is that there's nobody

[06:41] working on anything right if you're going to show me a walkthrough of your factory where where

[06:48] pinball production has begun and people are working hard on getting pinballs out the door there's

[06:53] not one single individual working on a game and I get that they're not working on alien right now

[07:02] but nobody's even touching full throttle in fact I think those full throttles are just stage there

[07:09] to make it look like production is happening on full throttles that more full throttle orders are

[07:15] going out because he's heard the criticism where people want to know like how many full throttles

[07:20] did you sell and he still hasn't given us even remotely like a ballpark number and look if this

[07:27] job of this video is to show us that all is good in highway pinball land why wouldn't you have

[07:34] some workers working on the full throttles let's let's look at if you go on YouTube and look at

[07:41] stern videos and spooky pinball videos whenever they introduce you into their factory and show you a

[07:47] behind the curtain look at what's going on what is going on right in both of those companies there's

[07:53] always people on the line working on the games even at jersey jack when hobbit was delayed there was

[08:01] still always people working on the was machines in the background so I'm just it's just it really

[08:09] looked to me like a dead factory just like nobody there working on anything now you could say look

[08:16] canada you're being unfair he probably took this video at night when everyone went home

[08:22] and and that's why I like there's not many people there and no one's touching anything and so I

[08:28] would just counter that and say look this video is a piece of marketing for Andrew highway he's

[08:33] trying to help you guys see what his company's doing and get a behind the scenes look if that's the

[08:39] case and he shot it when it's empty I don't think so and I know it's not empty because if you look

[08:46] look very closely at the very end of the video when he says come back next week for more videos you

[08:52] can see in the reflection of the alien LCD three guys standing there filming Andrew highway do this

[09:01] do this tour so that's the you know when I saw that I couldn't help but laugh I'm like oh my god

[09:06] we have more empty cabinets and an empty box and an assembly line with just games on it but there's

[09:12] nobody building anything right so I just I just saw that as kind of like not the best way to

[09:20] present your company that supposedly right on the cusp of shipping all these aliens and there's

[09:27] not one person putting anything together so and then he goes and he goes to the factory and he

[09:33] starts you know going through all the boxes and saying here's this here's that here's the lighted

[09:39] blade stuff here's the PCBs and and and this is not a knock I whenever I see all the parts that go

[09:48] into making a pinball machine I just always say my god who would ever try to start a pinball company

[09:55] right it looks like a nightmare getting all those parts all those pieces in boxes onto games one at

[10:03] a time in a way that makes you know make sure the game plays right in a in a way where there's no

[10:10] issues to ensure quality right because we all know that when you have thousands of parts and all

[10:16] them have to work harmoniously together or else you're going to get destroyed if your early games

[10:22] go out and those quality issues it just seems like a herculean task and and on that level I'm like

[10:28] look I can I congratulate them on starting a pinball company and trying to bring new pinball to

[10:34] market this isn't this isn't easy it is hard it seems almost impossible and it also would seem

[10:41] impossible to do with highway pinballs trying to do unless you had a team of people that really

[10:47] knew what they were doing I mean Stern has decades of experience doing this spooky started really

[10:53] small and learned as they went with very very small promises in terms of volumes of games

[11:00] but also you know they have some really good people on team that know exactly what they're doing here

[11:06] so I you know look I saw the video and then he goes down the row of the looks like there was like

[11:11] four alien machines or five and then there was one at the end that was that he turns on and he starts

[11:16] to move the ball and we and I know there's been some criticism of like this anymore of head wasn't

[11:22] working during the the European coin op show and so he throws the ball at the xenomorph head and

[11:29] what do we see we see the the tongue come down which looks more like a black pencil and it grabs

[11:36] the ball so slowly and retracts the ball super slowly but watch that watch that mech watch it watch

[11:45] when that ball gets retracted how clunky and how much it's hitting the targets below the head right

[11:53] just watch it again and you'll see what I mean and and in the thread I know people were saying hey

[11:58] like I wish this would speed up and of course Andrew trimes in right away and says this is just

[12:04] on slow mode we're testing it it's going to be much faster in the production game I don't know

[12:11] we're looking at that video with how clunky it is it definitely needs adjustments because the balls

[12:16] hitting the targets if you go any faster that ball is probably going to pop off that mechanism and

[12:21] look that mech I give them credit again that's not an easy thing to do to have a something fire out

[12:27] that magnetizes the grab of the ball and pulls it back with the ball staying on you probably

[12:35] have to do it kind of slowly to ensure the balls stay on that that tongue right but look I just

[12:44] I think we're at the level now and Andrew's like I'm going to give updates every week I think it's

[12:49] come to the point now where I just want to see games being made I think we're all in the same

[12:57] boat now these factory tours are not going to do anything I think to change people's minds that

[13:05] things aren't going so well that the delays that are happening on alien could go on for months

[13:14] months look what's happening over at Dutch we've waited months because of board issues and until I see

[13:22] people on the line at highway actually putting playfields into those rotisseries and wiring them up

[13:30] and putting games into machines and testing those machines I won't believe that they're close to

[13:36] getting games out and I think a lot of people will share that opinion the other side of the coin too

[13:44] that I just can't understand for the life of me is why haven't we seen the Ellie art package yet

[13:52] that part to me continues to be the biggest red flag it's like you won't show your limited edition

[13:59] customers what they're getting you won't show these people what a limited edition alien highway

[14:06] pinball machine looks like yet I don't understand why not if you look at what everyone else does when

[14:14] you're spending the most money on that model you get to see what it looks like before and we know

[14:23] that we keep hearing from oric and that it was it's not hard to do the alien Ellie artwork and that

[14:29] I think it's done right but he even oric won't directly answer questions when people say when

[14:36] are we going to see the alien Ellie artwork why can't we see it these are the people who went

[14:41] in early I want to see what it looks like I think all of you out there all of you that are on

[14:47] pinside that are allowed to post all of you that have friends that are in on alien I think you

[14:52] should keep beating that drum show us what the alien Ellie looks like what is the artwork look like

[15:01] what does the trim look like on the machine what is the final package with the beacons on the machine

[15:08] look like the fact that he won't show you that how is that not a huge red flag I don't understand I

[15:17] would say this to any other company out there that wants to sell you a product but not show you it

[15:24] I also think it's ridiculous that Jack never showed anyone with the collector's edition look like

[15:30] but yet had a deadline by which people could order it and Stern was was doing that funny stuff too

[15:36] with Batman and the SLE right let me take your money and not show you what you're going to get

[15:41] but this is much different Andrews already expressed what's going to be on the Ellie right he's

[15:47] got the light at ramps he's got that Eli wire on the ramps it's got the beacons on the top

[15:53] so just put one together that looks like the Ellie and show people again every time these things don't

[16:00] happen I believe they are stalling for a reason because as a professional marketer this makes no sense

[16:09] it makes no sense to keep the people that are carrying your torch that are waving your flag the

[16:16] highest to keep them in the dark about the product they're about to buy and every week that goes

[16:24] by now that these people haven't seen the Ellie package that games aren't going out they're going

[16:31] to get more and more anxious and so this is where we're at this was February right I did not expect

[16:40] that we'd be into February and still scratching our heads about when the first alien machine is

[16:46] going to go out so let's see what happens this is going to be a tough month for these guys every

[16:50] week that goes by the microscope is going to zoom in more and more and more and more people are

[16:56] going to ask like what is going on just be honest and I think if Andrew said the following look

[17:03] it's really hard we've got some delays I'm going to need like everyone on the Ellie to pay

[17:09] up and fall and we'll get your games out like I promise like if that if if money is tight and he

[17:14] needs to say that fine say it there's no problem no one ever has a problem with companies speaking

[17:20] the truth what they have a problem with is what's going on over a Dutch pinball where no one says

[17:27] anything right you just get these periods of like darkness and everyone's still waiting for their

[17:32] big Lebowski and and the fact that Dutch is like taking people's money and and and significant

[17:39] amounts of money right these games were 10 grand and people are getting nothing from them

[17:43] the long term effects that will have on Dutch pinball are going to be significant nobody wants

[17:50] a company that's going to duck and hide from answering their basic questions especially when

[17:55] they paid money so I think it's wrong over a Dutch I think it's wrong that Andrew highway took

[18:00] people's money like if I get if I paid and fall on an Ellie and it's February of 2017 and I can't

[18:07] see what I'm going to get that that's wrong that's wrong all right so let's change gears now and

[18:14] look if for before I do though if you guys have any feelings about this like let me know do you think

[18:19] I'm out of my mind with the way I'm looking at this project am I wrong in raising these red flags

[18:24] in February of 2017 am I looking at this video like incorrectly it explained to me come on the show

[18:32] I invite all of you with alien machines on order to come on the show and defend your order I'm

[18:38] talking to you ice man I know you got one why don't you come on and tell me what you see that I

[18:43] don't I'm calling you out and all of you other people out there who have an alien get grow some

[18:49] xenomorph balls and come on canators pinball podcasts and tell me tell me why I'm wrong I've invited

[18:57] Andrew on he won't respond he won't come on to talk about it I've invited the other people on

[19:00] they won't come on just come on tell me all right this it's open to our policy here we I don't

[19:05] bite I don't bite all right so speaking of biting let's talk about medieval madness remake which a

[19:11] game that hasn't really been in the news recently but apparently there's a problem with the trim

[19:18] on the machine in which the trim is slicing people up it's cutting it'll cut you to the point

[19:26] where people are bleeding at times because the trim edges are so sharp and and and some people

[19:33] are like that's bullshit and other people are like no like it's confirmed and and and Rick instead

[19:38] of sending people new trim sends people something to file down the edges so they're not so sharp

[19:45] on the trim and this this is sort of like oh oh my god now pinball machines are not are not just

[19:52] like giving us headaches they're also giving us injuries like people are getting cut up and people

[19:57] are saying scenarios where kids could could fall and cut their heads open on the trim of medieval

[20:02] madness remake so watch out guys medieval madness is they're dangerous machines you gotta be careful

[20:08] when you play them I I think that people are making a lot out of a little here I think it does show

[20:15] one thing that people are probably accurately upset about and that's that there's like these little

[20:20] final quality issues that this company hasn't taken into effect and if those edges are really sharp

[20:27] and again I haven't experienced it first hand that's something that should be done at the factory

[20:32] right so customers shouldn't be getting medieval manises with razor sharp edges and then being

[20:38] required to sand them down themselves that is something that should happen in the factory and look

[20:44] any bad news for mmr is is not good right now considering we're going into an attack from Mars

[20:52] remake announcement or sort of confirmation and reveal at Texas pinball festival I think that

[20:59] attack from Mars remake is going to really struggle to sell simply because of all the mmr

[21:05] issues people have had and if it's eight gram forget it it's just going to be this like yeah if

[21:10] you really love afm and you want one that's beautiful and new and and you know a virgin example

[21:18] those people will buy one in eight thousand but if it's at eight thousand I don't think you're

[21:23] going to get a ton of people going in on them and maybe that's fine you know maybe they can do

[21:28] these runs smaller now without without without saying they're going to make in a limited amount

[21:34] so I think if they would have just done like a thousand mmr remakes and that's it it probably

[21:38] would have been better would maintain the value a little bit more but to say we're going to keep

[21:42] making them forever as long as we get orders I think was a huge marketing mistake and I think maybe

[21:46] they switched that with attack from Mars remake all right what else is going on in pinball people

[21:52] what are you guys talking about what are you guys bitching about what have I been noticing so Batman

[21:57] 66 have you noticed there's sort of like not a lot of conversation going on around Batman 66 there's

[22:06] obviously the same old stern quality control issues and yes we know that stern didn't take extra

[22:15] time and extra care when they made Batman 66 so look it's a stern when I look at people complaining

[22:22] about certain things here and there I'm just like you bought a stern you bought a stern it's like you

[22:26] bought a you bought a Honda or you bought a Kia or you bought a Hyundai you didn't buy a Rolls Royce

[22:33] like people who thought that because this was the 66 Batman anniversary edition and stern's 30th

[22:40] birthday present to themselves that they were going to take extra care and time with this machine

[22:46] no like you got a stern and you got a stern and so it's it's it's going to have like the typical

[22:52] stern issues that people see all the time and we're seeing that now but what I think is really the

[22:57] point I want to make about Batman on this episode is this I think it's really a shame that we're

[23:03] never really going to have the hype with Batman sync up with a great game right there's always

[23:11] going to be now this huge amount of time between hype which is launch and when the game is great

[23:18] and I really think out of all the titles this one is shipped with probably the most

[23:23] spartan code of any recent stern and I think it's really a shame and I'll explain why I think you

[23:32] get one chance to make a really great first impression with a pinball machine and to do that right

[23:38] you need to not only have a great game that's got great toys and mechs and artwork and music and

[23:45] all that stuff but you need to have the code far enough along that on day one people's excitement

[23:52] for what they're looking at is as exciting as what it's like to play the game itself and if we

[23:58] look at Ghostbusters I think that's why Ghostbusters was so successful and so talked about at launch

[24:04] before all the quality issues was that the code was far along and people didn't feel like so much of

[24:11] the game wasn't finished and so much of like the potential wasn't there they got it on day one

[24:18] and stern really put a lot of effort into making the Ghostbusters code pretty far along on day one

[24:24] now Batman comes out and it's like the complete opposite like there's just so much missing from

[24:30] the game that it almost feels like by the time this game is done and I know Lyman is the best but by

[24:36] the time he's done a year could go by before the game gets what it deserves in terms of gameplay

[24:44] and code and by that time again I just think it's kind of sucks that these things come out and when

[24:51] we're most excited you can't jump on one and get truly excited by the experience the metaphor I'll

[24:59] use it's like releasing a movie without the special effects put in yet it is to me that is the

[25:06] greatest example of what it's like shipping a pinball machine with hardly any code you're basically

[25:12] letting people see it have it experience it but not in the way that it's supposed to not in the way

[25:20] that's going to wow you remember when like Wolverine like when I think it was the first Wolverine movie

[25:25] came out and like it leaked online and none of the special effects were dropped in it was how it was

[25:31] actually it was better because of how hilarious it was but that's what it feels like when you play

[25:36] these stern pinball machines and the code's not there yet so I think it's a shame I think Erasmith

[25:42] when it comes out is going to be much further along but I really really really hope that when stern

[25:48] launches Star Wars it's done like just say this game is done there's going to be little polishes

[25:54] here and there but for the most part the game is done and I think that goes true for all manufacturers

[25:59] out there I'm so tired of the code delays like when Hobbit was delayed for two years and we got

[26:08] the game and the code still wasn't finished are you kidding me what did you do for two years

[26:14] and that you couldn't finish the code and the same thing with Lebowski it's like two year delay

[26:19] and the code wasn't done I think everyone I look it's not I can't change it you can't change it

[26:26] people bitch about code all the time but at the end of the day it really does hurt these companies

[26:32] because the games come out and they're not great they're good but the fact that there's potential

[26:37] still left back at the factory and with the coder is a mistake so every game moving forward that

[26:45] has delays or is a marquee title should launch with finished code and that's just the way it should

[26:51] be moving forward so I saw that Charlie chimed in on Jetson's pinball any I emailed Charlie and

[26:58] right after I saw the launch and basically said that the the ladder paste structure with the pinball

[27:04] company is idiotic so I was happy to see Charlie tell us that he was going to ex-NAY that which is

[27:11] good because you don't that just seemed pretty like a desperate attempt to sell the first 100 units

[27:18] and Charlie said look we're gonna we're gonna add some more to the game we're gonna add some more

[27:21] to Jetsons and we heard people and we also feel like we could go further with it and the pinball

[27:28] company agreed and the game's gonna remain the same price now I'll say this though I'll say this

[27:34] and this is again this is a little bit of like a devil's advocate show by Canada's pinball podcast

[27:39] the devil's advocate in me says well wait a minute like you listen to pinside people

[27:45] complaining who are never gonna buy this pin you went in and now you increased the bomb right the

[27:52] build of materials the bomb of the game is now gonna go up but the price is gonna stay the same

[28:00] so you're gonna lose some money now in each game sold and you never even really test it to see

[28:07] if the marketplace would go in on it at the price you set so I don't know I'm on the fence

[28:16] about this one I still think the Jetsons at $6,000 I don't know I mean I don't I just don't see it

[28:26] the value there but I still think they'll sell because I do think the marketplace is so much

[28:32] bigger than pinside and the people out there that want to buy a game for their kids and it's Jetsons

[28:37] and it's got that music and it's it's a fun simple game I think for that alone for that reason

[28:43] alone I think you'll find buyers I really do I don't think the pinside's like pinside's like taking

[28:51] connect for to a to a hardcore like first person shooter for them right you guys are like hardcore

[28:59] pinball enthusiasts who want like deep code who want the most mechanisms on the play field who love

[29:04] all that stuff you want wizard mode you actually know how to update a pinball machines code most

[29:11] people out there who play casual pinball and want to get their kid like a simple machine they don't

[29:17] they don't even know what the fuck you guys are talking about so I'm not surprised that the

[29:21] pinside people were so up up in arms against what they were getting for 6 grand but again I think

[29:27] it's a totally different market and I'm not necessarily sure I would listen to feedback from from

[29:33] pinside on what to do with the game because I just think it's apples to oranges when it comes to

[29:39] who's going to buy it and who's giving you feedback so but excited to see a new pinball machine come

[29:44] out and glad that spooky and company have business going and I bet if we looked at their factory

[29:50] today there'd be a lot of movement going on inside it so we're always happy to see Charlie and

[29:54] company succeed you know and just guys to read you a comment that just shows this has been sort of

[29:59] like the devil's advocate podcast by Canadian pinball a few minutes ago someone wrote in the alien

[30:07] thread I want to this is a rocky top he wrote the factory tour was impressive that gives a glimpse

[30:14] of the investment involved and to me provides a lot of confidence in the operation as a whole

[30:21] so you know look I see it one way some people see it the other way if you want them people to be

[30:27] confident about the fact that they're about to get their alien pinball machines I think you need to

[30:32] show a working assembly line and and things actually being built what I saw was a humongous factory

[30:39] with nobody in it tons of parts which equals tons of money has gone out the door and it's February

[30:46] of 2017 and not one game is shipped and until I see actual workers building games I wouldn't feel

[30:53] confident and until I see the LE package I wouldn't feel confident that I know what I'm getting

[31:00] am I crazy or these guys like seeing what they want to see it's probably somewhere in the middle

[31:05] I'm probably looking at this a little bit too cynically and they're probably looking at it too

[31:10] optimistically so that's it for this little canators pinball podcast Saturday morning edition

[31:17] enjoy your pinball machines enjoy your loved ones have a good weekend and enjoy the super ball

[31:23] I really my money is on tom Brady just annihilating the falcons I should bet I should bet like the

[31:31] price of a of a jettison's pinball machine on Brady minus three points tomorrow and see see if

[31:37] we cover that I'm not going to do it but it would be interesting to see I read everyone have a great

[31:42] weekend
