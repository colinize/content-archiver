[00:00] Two worlds collide, rival nations, It's a primitive past, bidding is a frustration,

[00:09] Bravely we hope against all hope, There is so much at stake, seems our freedom's up against the rules.

[00:20] Two pinball worlds collide this week, is it going to be the week of Stern Pinball dropping X-Men,

[00:32] the uncanny X-Men, the second game from Jack Danger, versus the inaugural game from Mark

[00:40] Seidon in Jersey Jack Pinball's Avatar. Now look, we're seeing a lot of information trickling out,

[00:48] we know the release date of X-Men, we do not know the reveal date of Avatar first, I want to give a

[00:56] very special welcome to Mr. Derek Musket who has joined Canada's Pinball Podcast, Derek is the guy

[01:04] that moved my guns and roses, if you need any pinball moving on the east coast, Fast Eddie is

[01:11] retired, Derek Musket is your guy, the only thing is this, he's a one pin at a time guy, he gets it

[01:18] into a tiny Honda Fit, I don't know how he does it but he does it and not a scratch on my GNR,

[01:25] and I told him Derek on just my tip alone, that's two years of Canada's Pinball Podcast, I want to

[01:31] thank each and every one of you because the month ended, this was one of the only months ever where

[01:37] we didn't lose any subscribers, we are at 712 and I just want to tell each and every one of you,

[01:43] I am going to figure out how to do my Saturday morning spectacular right here on Patreon,

[01:51] no more Facebook, we're gonna do it here and it's gonna be awesome, so look out for that,

[01:57] and for those of you who say that not being on Facebook is hurting the Canada brand,

[02:02] it's the complete opposite, I mean we're still moving and grooving, you know what everybody

[02:06] else is doing is their own prerogative but this is still the most fun place to hear about pinball

[02:11] and the Patreon chat that we have going on is absolutely incredible even if Bond has lost his

[02:18] mind saying that Jaws LEs are still available new in box, no they're not, you can't find them anywhere,

[02:25] alright so this is gonna be a crazy week in pinball, now I want to talk about who I think is gonna win

[02:32] this week and why I think they're gonna win this week because I think we're gonna see a move

[02:38] by Stern Pinball that we've never seen before and they've listened, George Gomez told me, he's

[02:44] like Chris we listened to you, that's why they're making less than a thousand LEs, it's a move in

[02:50] the right direction, so here's the thing people, now that Jersey Jack has revealed the theme,

[02:56] they're trickling out like teaser images of Avatar, we just saw Jason Knapp yesterday shared an

[03:02] image of the physical ball lock underneath the play field which looks really cool, the artwork

[03:09] looks awesome, I'm excited that we're gonna get fresh new artwork from a new artist on a pinball

[03:15] machine, right? Zombietti's X-Men is gonna look awesome but man there's been like six or seven

[03:21] or maybe more zombie-eddy Stern machines already out in the world and so here's the thing, here's

[03:28] the thing, who's gonna win this week? Now look it is an uphill battle for both of these companies

[03:34] because they both know one simple thing, the entire new and box pinball community now realizes that

[03:42] there's almost no FOMO associated with the limited edition games and the collector's edition games

[03:49] and so how do you combat that? Well real simple and this is the major move Stern is gonna make this

[03:56] week and this is why I think Stern is just gonna dominate and they're gonna do something they haven't

[04:01] done before, I heard they are building all 811 uncanny X-Men LE games and they're gonna be finished

[04:10] with each and every one of them by the time this game is revealed this week, this is gonna be the

[04:16] first time ever, Stern makes the LE games first and they're gonna be available on day one, now

[04:24] think about that for a minute, if Stern does that and the order banks open and those games are going

[04:31] right out the door to customers which means you're gonna be playing the game in just a few days,

[04:36] that is gonna be so successful for them because there is that little window right of like FOMO

[04:42] that happens every time a new game comes out and if you can scratch the itch of that FOMO instantly

[04:49] with product you're gonna win, you're absolutely gonna win because we know when Jersey Jack reveals

[04:56] Avatar, I don't know if it's gonna be on the line and if it is on the line there's no way Jersey

[05:01] Jack is gonna be able to build a thousand Avatar CEs and we all know that Jersey Jack

[05:08] moronically never builds the CEs first, in fact they always make the CE owners wait months before

[05:16] those games go on the line, sometimes they make them wait so long that by the time the CE even hits

[05:23] the line the interest in the game is even gone and so if Stern does the opposite and I've always said

[05:29] this, the LE buyers, the CE buyers, those are your first class business class tickets, you get on the

[05:37] plane first and so if we see Stern do this I think they're absolutely going to dominate this week,

[05:45] it's gonna be about the here and the now versus well we're gonna make games the next month or two

[05:51] because I think that's what's gonna happen, remember Elton John when it was revealed it was not on the

[05:57] line and so we haven't seen Jersey Jack with like a hundred games ready to go in a box on reveal day

[06:05] really since Guns N' Roses over three years ago, I think Jersey Jack's gotta figure it out, I also

[06:12] think knowing that Stern is reducing the number of LEs from a thousand to eight eleven and if

[06:19] you're Jersey Jack you know there's absolutely more demand for Jack Danger's uncanny X-Men than a

[06:27] Mark's side in Avatar, there's no way you can make a thousand Avatar CEs and I think they're going to

[06:34] do an Audible, I think they should only make 500 Avatar CEs again, I think they need to dance with

[06:43] Stern and Stern is making moves that are right and if you're Jersey Jack and you're coming in at

[06:49] 15 grand a pop there's no way you should be making a thousand CEs for a game that doesn't have the

[06:57] demand that's there like this is not Harry Potter, it's not Back to the Future, it's not The Matrix,

[07:03] it's Avatar and I think they need to read the room a little bit, all right we also got this really

[07:09] weird fake letter from Jersey Jack pinball sort of hyping the game, it said like all the bioluminescent

[07:17] lighting that's gonna be in the game and the banshees that are gonna fly around the game and then

[07:22] it had a reveal date of tomorrow and it turns out that entire letter was fake so I heard from people

[07:30] at Jersey Jack it is not real, it just goes to show you how easy it is to create fake news in

[07:37] pinball and everyone just like bites at it right, I got hit up instantly by Ken Cromwell who said

[07:44] look that's not real, it's creating an issue for us and I have to imagine the issue it's creating

[07:50] is the release date of the game and so that is the big question, if you're Jersey Jack are you going

[07:59] to let Stern pinball have this week to themselves, reveal X-Men, take orders on X-Men and ship X-Men

[08:08] game, are you going to allow Stern pinball to get thousands of orders for a game when you know

[08:16] you want that money to go to you, I think Jersey Jack should reveal the game today, I think they

[08:23] should get out with that video in front of X-Men, I think if they have something truly special

[08:31] and truly cool and truly unique put it out there, let it be in everybody's heads because then when

[08:39] they see X-Men they're gonna compare it to what they've seen from Jersey Jack and we know there's

[08:45] no way in a million years that a Stern machine will outshine a Jersey Jack machine and so I think

[08:54] that's what they should do, they should get out in front of it, we know what it is, we know it's

[09:00] coming, now's the time to strike, I don't think I've seen these two companies battle it out like this

[09:06] before and I'm excited about it because as we watch Jersey Jack and Stern battle it out, it is

[09:14] really eye-opening how everybody else seems to be like a distant third in terms of our enthusiasm

[09:22] and our excitement, like spooky pinball should be hitting right now with Beetlejuice, when you see

[09:28] everything happening in the world around Beetlejuice and they're not going to deliver Beetlejuice now,

[09:33] what I think they're going to do is I think they might be releasing Gremlins in the winter time

[09:41] during Christmas because Gremlins is a Christmas themed movie, now Gremlins came out in 1984 so

[09:49] it is the 40th anniversary for some weird reason it came out in June, so maybe we're gonna get Gremlins

[09:56] if they make Motorhead to compete with these themes, I think Motorhead will be dead on arrival,

[10:03] sorry for you Motorhead fans but it's just not enough of a theme to get sales in this modern

[10:08] pinball world and so spooky is nowhere to be found right now, now look we know that Greg Bone and

[10:14] Zach Many were over at spooky pinball and that seems to telegraph to me that they're gonna film

[10:23] one of their spectacular 20 minute videos where they do a deep dive into a game, they did it with

[10:31] Pulp Fiction and it was amazing, now look two years have gone by and I just want to say right now

[10:38] I think Pulp Fiction LE is gonna be like dead on arrival when it comes to enthusiasm and excitement

[10:46] I'm already starting to see regular Pulp Fiction games sell for a lot less money, I don't think

[10:52] anybody cares anymore and it just goes to show you like there's a window of excitement, it's like the

[10:58] Pulp Fiction movie now has been in the theaters for two years and I'm just saying that metaphorically

[11:03] talking about the pinball machine but who's gonna care now when the LE comes out, I absolutely could

[11:09] care less, they're not gonna go up in value and I don't think anyone really cares anymore and look

[11:15] they did it to themselves, what a stupid thing, I mean just think about it for a minute, why would

[11:20] you ever reveal a game when you know you can't get the nicest version of the game to customers in two

[11:29] freaking years, Stern Pinball is about to reveal a game and get the nicest version to customers

[11:36] in like two days, all right, what an embarrassment it is being CGC, in fact I think everybody at

[11:43] this point right now is just over CGC in general, their strategy is pathetic, I just want to use

[11:51] that word, it's a pathetic strategy to reveal a product and why would it take you two years

[11:58] to order plastic toppers, I mean you could send that topper to China and get back a thousand of

[12:04] them in a weekend, there's absolutely no excuse for this and I'm over it and I wanted to say right

[12:09] now if you're in on a Pulp Fiction LE, I'm happy for you but I think there's no demand for this game

[12:15] and I'm already starting to see people trying to sell their Pulp Fiction LE spots for like a

[12:19] thousand over, trust me, don't pay a penny over for Pulp Fiction LE because with all these new

[12:25] games coming out and these distros are going to be sitting on these Pulp Fiction LEs as people

[12:30] move their money to something else, all right so I'm excited, so Jersey Jack you gotta hit

[12:35] early, you gotta get out there early, Spooky Pinball we're not going to get something until

[12:40] December and then the company that we will not mention anymore who's waiting right for all these

[12:47] games to come out, I don't know, you know I'll just say it like this, there's no bad time to release

[12:54] a great theme, back to the future could be released at any time, Pokemon anytime, Harry Potter anytime,

[13:03] there's no good time to release a bad theme, so if you have a bad themed game that nobody really

[13:11] wants, it doesn't matter if you wait for the dust to settle, if that company that I won't mention

[13:17] anymore had back to the future, they absolutely would be dropping it this week alongside Avatar

[13:24] and X-Men, now here is the thing with X-Men, we know it's going to be beautiful, we know there's

[13:29] going to be mechs in the game, I'm hearing that there are more mechs that they are very proud of,

[13:35] I'm also hearing that this game is going to do some stuff that no Stern machine has done before,

[13:41] interesting timing because I also know that they are going to have Metallica remastered at Pimball

[13:50] so that means that it makes sense now, Stern is going to want to get as many of these X-Men's built

[13:56] and on their way to customers before we get to like mid-October, the ability for Stern Pimball to

[14:04] manufacture and to ship games to people is so impressive, what's not impressive is when they

[14:11] send a customer a Godzilla, have you seen this guy's Godzilla play field, it is like ribbed beyond

[14:17] belief, I mean you look at it from an angle and it's like as wavy as an ocean and then you got

[14:23] people like crazy levy trying to defend that being like it's just that's normal just enjoy it, no

[14:29] game come on, if you get sent something like that it should have been caught by their quality control

[14:35] people and the guy should just get a new game, I don't think most play fields go out like that but

[14:41] some of them do and if you get one I would not accept it and Stern should make that customer

[14:47] whole and the distributor should not stop until that game is replaced and I know if you make enough

[14:55] noise Stern Pimball will do the right thing and replace that customer's game, remember gang,

[15:01] remember the bomb on their games is like four grand, three thousand, four thousand dollars,

[15:07] they can easily afford to absorb and replace a customer game, so this is going to be the week

[15:14] where two worlds collide, we're going to have Stern versus Jersey Jack, I think Stern's going to win

[15:20] because of manufacturing ability, I also think the theme is something that more people are excited

[15:26] about, I also wouldn't sleep on Avatar, I do see the potential in Avatar, I do see how it could work,

[15:34] I really do, I'm not angry about any of these things because again we're now customers and we

[15:42] now have all of the power, it is a buyer's market, it is not a seller's market, you don't have to call

[15:50] around anymore and beg a distributor to get on their list for an LE or a CE, so the good news is this,

[15:59] when both of these games come out you're going to be able to see them, you're going to be able to

[16:04] see gameplay of them, you're going to probably be able to jump on them before you even have to pull

[16:10] the trigger on one, now if Stern does make 811 X-Men's in a box, LE's ready to ship day one,

[16:20] I do think even at 13,000 I do think they're going to sell out of those games, I do because again

[16:28] I just think there's so much more going for this game than working against it and I also think

[16:34] this game is going to have mechanical magic, I don't think there was any mechanical magic in

[16:41] Jaws, I don't care what anybody says, when I look at the Mechs in Jaws, it's a total joke, I mean

[16:47] think about the shark fin in that game, it is so embarrassing that that's what they engineered as the

[16:53] shark fin for Jaws and don't even get me started, they couldn't get a shark to eat the ball and make

[16:59] it fun but the damn Sentinel does and I don't even think that's going to be the major Mech in X-Men

[17:06] and think about it, Foo Fighters didn't really have any mechanisms in it either so I think this

[17:12] is going to be a loaded game and it needs to be, right, the old Stern X-Men game had a lot of Mechs

[17:18] in it so this game cannot be devoid of magical mechanisms, you pair that with Jack Danger who

[17:25] knows how to make a game play extraordinarily well and then you add zombie-eddy artwork who's

[17:31] perfect for this theme and you know they're going to get a great coding team on the game, I absolutely

[17:38] think there's going to be almost nothing not to like about this game other than the price and I've

[17:44] been saying it, they know they need to make magic to justify the price and the same exact thing is

[17:50] true about Avatar, if Avatar is just lights and ramps and artwork and not enough mechanical magic

[17:59] people are not going to go in on it, they're just not and I think the big problem with JJP now with

[18:06] their two tiers of games, the big problem with them is this now, the entry level game is $12,000

[18:16] like their entry level is double the price of Stern's entry level for X-Men, that's crazy

[18:25] and then the problem is this, if you have $12,000 to burn on a pinball machine you have $15,000

[18:34] and it's like who wants to own an Elton John Platinum for $12,000 you might as well just get the CE

[18:41] and I think what Jersey Jack needs to do now is they really need to rethink the strategy and you

[18:47] know my advice to them is this, stop trying to win on volume, your games are just unique, I do

[18:53] think they're special, I would make only 500 CE's and I would make 1500 LE Platinum's and that's it,

[19:02] $2,000 of each game and then we're on to the next and we do one to two games a year, that's it, it's

[19:08] not like they need the money, it's not like the Abbas family needs the money, just make your company

[19:14] the bespoke high-end pinball company, it should be and then everybody's happy, right, you can cycle

[19:20] through more games, designers can get their games to market faster, you don't have to keep making

[19:27] games and create demand for the games because there will always be demand, if you only make

[19:32] 2,000 of each you will sell out of every single game you make and I know it's hard when you have

[19:37] Harry Potter, let's make 10,000 of them but hey just keep it at that and everyone will be happy.

[19:43] Alright, what else is going on in pinball? I'm hearing that the Back to the Future game which

[19:47] is coming out like next year around this time, I'm hearing that the cabinet artwork, I've spoken

[19:53] to someone who saw it, they told me it is just the real big logo of Back to the Future and I'm like,

[20:00] well that kind of makes sense, that's how the big Lebowski is, it's just the logo, now should they

[20:06] have done more, should there have been more artistic creativity with it, we shall see, it's a year away,

[20:13] there's going to be so much that happens in pinball between now and then and speaking of like what's

[20:18] going to happen between now and then, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I put out a little teaser

[20:25] animation of the game itself, look I've been telling Melvin, you got to get more out, like a 5

[20:32] second clip is not enough to get people super excited especially with what Stern just showed,

[20:39] especially with what we're seeing from Avatar, you need to show more, like you need to show more

[20:45] and you need to get people more excited because there's no way around it, all these games are

[20:50] competing with each other, they're all around the same price, remember like basically like Alice is

[20:55] going to be around $12,000, that's the entry level to Avatar, that's basically an LE for Stern,

[21:02] all the same price, when Spooky comes out with its game with Butter Cabinet, it's like $12,000,

[21:09] all the same price, so it doesn't matter anymore, right, all these games are going to cost you around

[21:14] the same amount of money and we know that all these companies are not equal, they don't have equal

[21:20] talent, equal resources, equal abilities and it's like okay if everything's around the same price,

[21:26] you're going to end up buying just whatever's best, whatever's most fun, whatever puts the magic

[21:32] under the glass, what a great time to be alive in Pimbal, I can't wait to cover all of this,

[21:38] everybody happy Labor Day weekend, obviously I'm working for each and every one of you,

[21:43] I'm very happy about all of your supports, I haven't seen many people raise the roof,

[21:48] I went to Dunkin Donuts yesterday, two large coffees, $8.90, now look I said I'm never going to raise

[21:57] Canada's entry level from 5 to 10, but you know some of you out there, I know you're doing pretty

[22:04] well, living high on the hog, you know you want to raise the roof, for the amount of content I'm

[22:09] giving you guys every single week, everybody have a great day off with your families, we'll talk to

[22:14] you soon and get ready for the madness that's about to ensue this week, take it away Rocky 4

[22:20] soundtrack, speaking of how do we not have a Rocky 4 game, I mean it is the 40th anniversary of Rocky

[22:26] 4 next year, somebody make this game, peace out.
