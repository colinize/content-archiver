[00:00] I'm not gonna buy TNA too, no, I'm not gonna spend 50% more than this game cost originally.

[00:30] No, I don't see $3,000 in value in what they're adding to this game.

[00:36] No, I'm not going to fall victim to the FOMO anymore, the manufactured scarcity anymore,

[00:43] the giving people only a couple of days to make up their mind.

[00:47] No, I'm not going to give spooky a non-refundable deposit anymore.

[00:53] No, I'm not going to just go in without thinking about this anymore.

[00:58] At what point, as a pinball community, do we see through all of the spin, but there's

[01:04] one real reason why I would not go in on this game.

[01:08] And there's one real reason why I think us as a community should look at this move and

[01:14] realize like what they're doing.

[01:16] No, I will not support a company that screws over its dealers and distributors who help

[01:23] them get to this point.

[01:26] No, I will not support a company that screws over its distributors who are left holding

[01:32] the bag on games like Halloween and Ultraman.

[01:36] No, I won't do it.

[01:38] I'm not going to be fooled again.

[01:40] And maybe this company is ironically titled Spooky, but it's getting pretty scary in the

[01:46] state of pinball.

[01:47] And no, I'm not going to be cajoled by Spooky Luke, who's in the thread jumping around

[01:52] from comment to comment, trying to just convince us all that just because you have transparency,

[01:59] this is a move that we should embrace, that this is a move we should feel lucky about,

[02:04] that we should feel honored in 2022 to pay the scalper or flipper price of a game.

[02:11] Let me break it down real simple because I don't think people quite get this.

[02:15] There's a reason why TNA, which was $6,000, is now selling for $8,000 or $9,000 in 2022.

[02:24] It's because A, we went through COVID and prices got really silly and stupid because the supply

[02:29] chain issues, but it's also because Spooky barely made maybe 500 of these games, and that

[02:35] was it, so there weren't many out there.

[02:38] Now you're going to add 50% more of these games into the marketplace.

[02:43] You're going to charge 50% more for them.

[02:46] And this is the new trend in pinball in 2022.

[02:50] If you go in on this game at $9,000, I'll tell you what, the price can only go in one direction,

[02:57] and that's down, and you're going to lose money.

[02:59] But by the time you can actually see where the market is on this game, and I don't care

[03:03] if you like this game or not, I don't care if you love this game, but the bottom line

[03:07] is this people.

[03:08] These pinball companies now, they want to lock you in before you have any chance whatsoever

[03:16] to know if it's a good buy or not.

[03:19] That's why they're only giving you like two days to make up your mind.

[03:22] They're not giving you any time to see the game in person.

[03:24] See here's the problem with TNA being a $9,000 game.

[03:27] First and foremost, it's not a $9,000 game, everybody.

[03:30] Like wake up, like open up your eyes and look at what's in this game.

[03:34] It's a very simple game.

[03:35] It was always a very simple game.

[03:37] I get there's a lot of lights in it.

[03:39] I get the head to take Scott Denise's homebrew game and turn it into a production machine.

[03:44] They did that, and they were successful in that, and this is one of the most successful

[03:48] spooky games.

[03:49] I would argue the only successful game to come out of spooky pinball has been games that

[03:54] Scott Denise has made.

[03:56] This is not a very complex game.

[03:58] It's not.

[03:59] Don't believe that.

[04:00] If it's expensive to buy lights, I get it.

[04:03] Maybe the margins weren't the best on TNA1.

[04:06] Now they're doing this, but look at this game, everybody.

[04:10] If this is now a $9,000 game in pinball, doesn't pinball all of a sudden not become that

[04:17] much fun.

[04:18] Like we're not supporting the small little company anymore.

[04:20] We're not rooting for the guy who built this game in his basement that George Gomez wanted

[04:24] to buy from him.

[04:25] This is no longer that.

[04:27] This is in one day, spooky pinball will guarantee in sales over $2.25 million.

[04:33] Okay, this is not the small little garage operation anymore.

[04:37] These aren't the little guys anymore.

[04:39] This company is making a lot of money.

[04:41] A lot of money making these games.

[04:43] And I get it.

[04:44] I'm not rooting for spooky to fail, but this is no longer the tiny little mom and pop shop

[04:48] anymore.

[04:49] There's millions and millions of dollars that are coming through the doors of these companies,

[04:53] and it's not just spooky.

[04:54] There's a lot of money to be made in pinball.

[04:56] I mean, Jack Winari just went on and said that we made $30 million in one day selling a

[05:01] game that is losing everybody thousands of dollars.

[05:04] Does this make any sense?

[05:06] You know, when a new pinball machine gets offered for sale or a rerun gets offered for

[05:10] sale like this, it is like the IPO on that game.

[05:14] Like you can get in first.

[05:15] Like you could buy it because you're a spooky fan club member.

[05:18] And only fan club members can buy this game.

[05:21] Everybody rush through the door this Thursday morning and you get a chance to give us $2,000.

[05:26] You get a chance to buy a rerun of a game in which we've already spent all of the R&D

[05:31] cost on how to make it.

[05:32] See, this is the part I don't get.

[05:34] If TNA was originally $6,000, that means spooky spent all of the R&D required on how to

[05:41] turn Scott's game into a production game.

[05:44] That cost has already been done.

[05:47] So shouldn't it be a little bit cheaper to make it this time around?

[05:51] Now I get that they're adding stuff to the game, but they're not adding $3,000 in value

[05:57] to the game.

[05:58] They are adding is a much greater margin and profit to their bottom line.

[06:02] And the ultimate margin they're adding and the way they're adding this margin is they

[06:06] are screwing over every single dealer and distributor who helps spooky pinball get to this

[06:13] point.

[06:14] And you know who they are and you know their names.

[06:17] And a move like this and I want to really stay on this topic because I think this shows

[06:22] a little bit what's really in the hearts of them right now.

[06:26] Here is the truth.

[06:27] They did not give their dealers and distributors a heads up that they were doing this.

[06:34] They have not allocated games to their dealers and distributors.

[06:38] This is a direct sale for everybody who's a spooky fan club member.

[06:43] There is just a huge issue with that.

[06:45] And here's why I think it's such a scary move that they're doing this with their distributors.

[06:50] Because a, their distributors were just left holding the bag on Halloween and Ultraman.

[06:55] I have distributors out there who have people who are walking away from their Halloween

[06:59] and their Ultraman.

[07:00] And yes, I get you could say look, it was all of those customers faults for going in on

[07:04] those games without knowing they really, really wanted it.

[07:07] But we also got burned a little bit by spooky.

[07:09] They made a game that wasn't really complete.

[07:11] They made a game that really wasn't worth the money and the market showed that right.

[07:15] The marketplace basically showed that it wasn't a customer's fault on why the games tanked

[07:20] in value.

[07:21] They still spookies fault because they made a game that wasn't worth 9000 or 8000 or 10000

[07:26] with a butter cabinet.

[07:27] And so people walked away.

[07:29] And you know what's been happening?

[07:31] Dealers and distributors have been sending money from customers on their customers behalf

[07:37] to spooky pinball.

[07:38] And spooky pinball is caching tens of thousands of dollars on games.

[07:44] They don't even have to make.

[07:47] They are making money for nothing.

[07:49] So people who are walking away from their Halloween and Ultramans, that money is still

[07:53] in spooky's bank account.

[07:55] And then spooky is selling that game again to a new buyer and they're not discounting

[08:00] it.

[08:01] So they are basically making money for nothing.

[08:03] Off of the FOMO they created.

[08:06] Off of the FOMO we all fall victim to.

[08:08] And look, it's smart.

[08:10] It's a smart business practice what they're doing.

[08:12] Look, they know what they're doing.

[08:14] Like it's absolutely smart to lock in people's money before they know what the market

[08:19] value is on the game.

[08:21] The other smart thing they're doing is this, look at the timing of this email.

[08:25] It went out last night at 5.55 or something PM on a Monday night.

[08:31] They put this email out.

[08:33] They did not let any of their dealers or distros know they were doing this.

[08:37] I would argue that's a pretty sleazy move.

[08:40] Not to even let your biggest distros know.

[08:43] And the sales people out there who have helped build your company, you didn't even give

[08:47] them a heads up.

[08:49] Think about that for a minute people.

[08:50] What kind of move that is?

[08:51] Okay, so you put it out on a Monday night.

[08:54] And let's look at the announcement that they put out last night from spooky pinball.

[08:58] Spooky pinball LLC at 5.45.

[09:01] Greetings fan club members.

[09:03] The weight is finally over.

[09:05] Spooky pinball is very proud to announce that TNA 2.0 is here.

[09:10] Why is it here?

[09:11] Because our amazing customers you asked for it.

[09:15] Ask and you shall receive.

[09:17] Okay.

[09:18] So people thought if you were going to rerun TNA, if you were going to charge more money,

[09:27] you might actually put it in a newer cabinet or you might actually change the artwork or

[09:32] you might actually do something really, really unique.

[09:34] You know what they're going to do?

[09:35] You know what they're going to do?

[09:36] And this is like the cheapest thing to do.

[09:37] Is they are going to have Scott do it like another mode or two in the game.

[09:41] And that's what they're going to say justify the cost.

[09:43] You know, this is pinball 2022 people.

[09:45] Like nothing really physically expensive gets put into games.

[09:49] They're just going to rely on the software to charge you all the money.

[09:52] So sales open.

[09:53] Get ready for it.

[09:54] Here's the FOMO at September 1st, this Thursday at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time.

[09:59] That is when if you are a fan club member, you can pay for the privilege to buy this game

[10:04] and get through the door first.

[10:06] Then they tell you how to order it through the fan club account.

[10:08] Here's what the kit includes.

[10:09] This is sound like $3,000 to you a nuclear green plastic protectors.

[10:15] Nocker, shaker, custom laser cut side rails, custom metallic powder coat, interior graphics,

[10:22] speaker kit and grills and light it, drop targets.

[10:26] Does that sound like $3,000?

[10:29] And just putting the word custom like all of this stuff has already been R indeed.

[10:34] All of this stuff has already been made for this game.

[10:37] Alright, how many will they make?

[10:38] Here's the favorite part about this whole thing.

[10:40] This is the one section of this sale that would make me pause.

[10:44] It should make you pause because this is the problem people.

[10:47] This is the thing.

[10:48] If you're going to charge $9,000 and you're going to charge me 50% more than this game was

[10:53] originally, then at least make it limited.

[10:56] At least let me know.

[10:57] This is the final run and that's the reason why I would buy this game.

[11:02] And they said how many are going to be made and they wrote, we only have time to do a

[11:07] small run of 250.

[11:09] But there is always the possibility of making more.

[11:13] Okay, right there.

[11:15] Do you need to have it this year?

[11:17] Do you need to have it Thursday?

[11:19] Do you need to have one right away?

[11:21] Why would you run in on a game in which they are telling us right here they're going to

[11:26] make more?

[11:28] This is going to be Spooky's line filler game forever because Spooky a namely made the

[11:34] decision.

[11:35] It wasn't Cartoon Network.

[11:37] It was Spooky Pimball and namely made the decision to say they were only making 750 Rick

[11:45] and Morty's ever.

[11:47] That was the silliest decision Spooky Pimball ever made.

[11:50] I know from people who know them, they are still kicking themselves that they made that

[11:55] decision.

[11:56] The Rick and Morty folks did not make them limited to 750.

[12:00] We know it made them limited to 750 their own insecurity and their desire to create

[12:06] FOMO.

[12:07] It worked, but you don't think Spooky Pimball right now would rather put Rick and Morty

[12:11] on the line again because they know that the Rick and Morty game at least justifies this

[12:17] kind of cost.

[12:19] Remember people, this TNA with tax and with shipping is now a $10,000 machine.

[12:28] If you add a Butter Cabinet which I'm not even sure is available, this is an $11,000

[12:33] machine if you add Butter.

[12:35] So a game that was once $6,000 can now skyrocket with all costs included all the way to $11,000.

[12:44] That's almost twice the cost of the machine in just a few years.

[12:48] Now people wouldn't mind paying it as much for Rick and Morty, you know why?

[12:51] Because it's Rick and Morty.

[12:53] It's one of the most popular properties out there and I saw Spooky in the thread saying

[12:57] this, well we licensed the game from Scott Denise.

[13:01] I mean have you ever heard any more spin in your life?

[13:03] We licensed the game from Scott Denise.

[13:07] You bought the game from Scott Denise.

[13:09] Why are you licensing it from him?

[13:11] This isn't some big property out in the world that you need to license and there's some

[13:15] IP and hey guys how many lawyers were involved when you licensed the game from Scott Denise?

[13:20] Did Scott bring his lawyers in?

[13:21] No, you simply are paying Scott a certain amount every game sold.

[13:25] You know that's what they're doing.

[13:26] Scott Denise is making some good coin with this company because he's getting paid for

[13:29] every game sold as he should.

[13:31] He made the game.

[13:32] He made the two spooky games that people like the most.

[13:35] Just think about that.

[13:36] Scott Denise he's actually got more talent than the crew over at Spooky Pimball.

[13:41] He's their Keith Owen.

[13:42] Now is he as good as Keith Owen?

[13:44] Absolutely not.

[13:45] Does he design games that are worth $9,000 to $10,000?

[13:47] I don't think so.

[13:48] You might think so but I just don't see the value there.

[13:51] And again I can't help but look at this game at 9 grand and look at what's in this game

[13:56] and compare what's in this game to a Godzilla premium.

[14:01] Compare what's in this game to a cactus canyon.

[14:04] Compare what's in it.

[14:05] Just look at down people.

[14:07] I don't need to know how much lights cost.

[14:10] I don't need to know anything about wood making or wire cutting or manufacturing or soldering.

[14:15] My eyes work.

[14:17] I can see what's in this game.

[14:21] When you put it next to everything else that's in Pimball right now and you say all these

[14:25] games are now worth $9,000, it's so easy for me to come to the conclusion that this

[14:31] thing's not even worth close to that.

[14:33] The only thing driving these prices right now with all of these companies it's greed.

[14:39] It's consumer delusion that this market is just going to keep getting hotter and hotter

[14:44] and hotter.

[14:45] But the sad part is is that this niche little hobby that we all love supporting.

[14:51] This niche little hobby in which we love seeing companies like Spooky, you know, try to

[14:55] make it.

[14:56] I was there when Spooky was trying to sell America's most honest and now it's at the point now.

[15:01] Every time a Pimball company wants to sell you something they're selling it to you at the

[15:06] flipper price, at the inflated price, at a price in which the only direction that pin

[15:13] can go is down.

[15:15] Every single consumer is losing value now.

[15:19] You're not getting value.

[15:21] You're not getting value on the day you buy the machine and you're going to see that

[15:25] the day you go to sell the machine.

[15:28] So then we are now in a new Pimball world.

[15:31] Everything you buy better be something you want to bolt to the floor in your room because

[15:35] otherwise you're going to lose a few thousand dollars on it.

[15:37] You know, and also just think about the marketplace for TNA now.

[15:41] So imagine you have an original TNA.

[15:43] You're not going to trade up.

[15:45] You're not going to spend 50% more on the game.

[15:48] And even if you love this game and you want it to get the latest version of it and it's

[15:52] going to be nicer.

[15:53] See, don't get me wrong.

[15:54] I've spoken to people who have played the new one and they said this is much nicer.

[15:58] This is a really nice game.

[16:00] It is nicer than the original.

[16:02] So now you create a little bit of a dilemma.

[16:05] Now there's a little bit of a quagmire for people who are fans of this game.

[16:08] And let me just go on the record and say this because I've played TNA a bunch.

[16:12] I understand why people like it.

[16:15] It's just never been a game for me.

[16:16] It's super fast.

[16:17] It's super brutal.

[16:18] I understand the why people like it.

[16:20] I like the light show.

[16:21] I love the music.

[16:22] I love the fact that it's a super fast game.

[16:25] It's also a really fun game for four players who are good at Pimbal.

[16:29] That is the appeal of TNA.

[16:31] It's also a game that's really easy to understand.

[16:34] Like you step up to it and you can explain to somebody how to play this game.

[16:39] If you went from a TNA to like a Jersey Jack game in which there's so much going on,

[16:44] you would absolutely have no clue how to play a Jersey Jack game after playing TNA.

[16:49] And I think that's the appeal of this game.

[16:52] But the real appeal of this game was that it was cheap.

[16:55] It was a single level game built by one of us in the community and you could have it.

[17:01] And we were just happy to see it go into production.

[17:03] If you're going to charge me the same price as Godzilla Premium, I'm good.

[17:07] Goodbye.

[17:08] Thank you.

[17:09] No, this conversation's over.

[17:10] You just can't charge me that much for this game.

[17:12] I'm done.

[17:13] I cannot be charging what they're charging.

[17:14] I'm just done.

[17:15] I'm walking away.

[17:16] I'm not doing it.

[17:17] I will never live in a world in which I will pay $9,000 for a TNA.

[17:20] I just don't see the value, especially when they say they're going to make more.

[17:23] That conversation is not happening.

[17:25] Spooky Pimbal to me is not a company that can consistently charge us $8000 to $10,000 for

[17:30] machines.

[17:31] I just don't see it.

[17:32] They can charge us.

[17:33] They can ask you for the money.

[17:35] They can lock in your non-refundable deposit.

[17:37] But it's just not going to be coming from Canada anytime soon.

[17:40] But again, back to the fact.

[17:41] If you have one, you can't afford to trade up because it's not worth it.

[17:44] And people are thinking, oh, now this is going to cause the value of the old ones to go

[17:48] up.

[17:49] No, it's not.

[17:50] And here's why it's not.

[17:51] No one's going to want the old ones.

[17:52] No one is going to want the old ones.

[17:53] This is the new one.

[17:54] They have basically made the new LE of TNA.

[17:57] This is the one you're going to want.

[17:58] If you're going to want to buy a TNA or you want to buy an old one that's been beat

[18:01] on for a few years, no, you're going to want the new one with all the new bells and

[18:04] whistles that somehow justified being a $9,000 machine.

[18:08] Now you've got 750 TNAs in the world in which they already said they will make more.

[18:14] So the market on it is going to go below $9,000, not above $9,000.

[18:19] Now look, come Thursday.

[18:21] This is the moment, people.

[18:23] Come Thursday morning.

[18:24] The decision is everybody's.

[18:25] It's all of yours.

[18:26] It's not just mine.

[18:27] It's your decision.

[18:28] Come Thursday.

[18:30] We will know if spooky pinball basically has the entire community by the you know what.

[18:36] If this game sells out right away or on day one and all 250 are spoken for at 9 grand,

[18:43] then you know what direction this community is going in.

[18:46] You know what direction this market is going in.

[18:49] You know what direction pinball is going in.

[18:52] And this is an opportunity for everybody to show spooky.

[18:55] We're not doing it.

[18:56] I'm not doing it.

[18:57] Can it is not doing it?

[18:58] I think there's going to come a point in which we need to tell these companies, no.

[19:02] Like this isn't how it's supposed to work.

[19:05] No, you're not supposed to screw over your distributors when you release a game like

[19:10] this.

[19:11] Yes, I'm supposed to support my distributors who are my friends who have been helping

[19:15] me all these years.

[19:16] It's also their livelihood spooky.

[19:19] This is why I'm coming back to the fact that they're screwing the distros on this.

[19:22] It's their livelihood.

[19:24] And I have some very good friends who are distributors and dealers and pinball.

[19:28] And when I talk to them about this, they're absolutely gutted.

[19:32] They're absolutely deflated.

[19:34] And they just think it's unfair.

[19:36] It's unfair, spooky, that we've spent so many years helping you pad your wallets, helping

[19:43] you put more Corvets in the driveway.

[19:45] We were on that journey with you.

[19:48] We were the ones who found you buyers when nobody wanted your games.

[19:53] And now that you have a hot game people want, you're going to cut us out of the loop.

[19:58] It's time spooky pinball woke up.

[20:00] If they want to be a big company, if they want to play with the big boys like Stern,

[20:04] did Stern cut out its distributors when they sold El Vira?

[20:08] Did they cut out its distributors when they sold Godzilla Ellie?

[20:12] Do they cut out their distributors when they do a vault edition of a game?

[20:16] No, they know that their distributors are everything to them.

[20:20] And again, I just think spooky needs to like reevaluate what they're doing.

[20:25] Why we love them?

[20:26] Why we love you, spooky.

[20:28] You need to reevaluate why this community fell in love with you.

[20:32] You need to understand that every movie you make now, we are watching closely because

[20:37] we are spending so much of our hard earned money on what you do.

[20:41] And this isn't how you do it.

[20:43] And you need to approach some of this a little bit differently moving forward.

[20:47] And I mean it when I say this to them, I know they're good people and I know they're

[20:51] making smart moves.

[20:52] I mean, how smart was it to announce this before Stern reveals its next game?

[20:58] And they slid right in.

[21:00] The week or two before Stern's game comes out and now they're going to lock in 2.25 million

[21:05] in sales.

[21:06] You know why we all wait for Stern's next game.

[21:09] And that was a really smart move.

[21:10] Like it was really smart timing.

[21:12] It's like spooky pinball out of all the boutiques out there.

[21:15] They've really geniusly opened up their order books always in that period when there's like

[21:21] a gap, right?

[21:22] Whenever there's like not a new Stern or there's nothing happening from C.G.C. or J.J.P.

[21:27] They always slide in and open up their order banks and it's smart and they've made a lot

[21:32] of money doing it that way and it's worked out for them.

[21:36] But a lot of people got burned on the last 2 games.

[21:39] For me, I don't really care about TNA coming back.

[21:41] I want to see what this company can do next.

[21:44] I want to see what their design team is capable of because we didn't see amazing things

[21:48] on these last 2 games.

[21:50] And this is basically a game to fill the line until they get to that game.

[21:53] Whether it's Scooby-Doo or something else, I think it's Scooby-Doo.

[21:56] I don't know, like I want to see Spooky be successful.

[21:59] It is the American dream to see a small company go from begging you to buy America's most

[22:03] honoured to doing millions of dollars in sales in 2022.

[22:08] But Spooky, there's a middle ground and I think you're jumping past that middle ground.

[22:12] And I think you're forgetting a little bit what got you there, who got you there, and

[22:17] how it got you there.

[22:19] And now it's all about the money.

[22:21] It really is.

[22:22] It's all about the money.

[22:24] And when you cut out your distributors, there's no greater sign that it's all about the

[22:29] money.

[22:30] And here's what I'm asking Spooky-Doo.

[22:32] I'm asking that Spooky-Pimball actually thinks about this over the next 24 hours and lets

[22:38] their distributors in on the sale of this game.

[22:40] I think it's the right thing to do.

[22:42] They've still got time to do it.

[22:44] The reason why you have to let your distributors in on the good games that have demand is they're

[22:49] with you on the bad games that are stinker, Spooky.

[22:52] And don't forget that.

[22:53] And no company, I'm just going to say, you got to look in the mirror, you've put out some

[22:57] games that have been some stinkers.

[23:00] And those distributors were with you during those bad times.

[23:03] So don't cut them out during the good times.

[23:06] There might be some of you out there that say, Canada, you're a hypocrite, you're doing

[23:09] a podcast behind a paywall.

[23:12] Now let me tell you right now, I did five years of free Pimball podcast.

[23:16] I made no money on it.

[23:17] Five years.

[23:18] I did about 500 plus episodes for free.

[23:20] I've spent countless hours of my life.

[23:22] I've spent more hours doing this podcast than it took Scott and easy to design any of

[23:27] these games.

[23:28] I've spent more hours doing this podcast than almost any Pimball company has ever spent

[23:32] on a single game.

[23:33] And I've made nothing for five years.

[23:35] I'm here right now.

[23:37] It is 4.35 in the morning.

[23:39] I woke up because I couldn't sleep and I just wanted to record this show.

[23:43] I think this show is one of the rare shows that everybody should hear.

[23:47] I think everybody should hear what I say on this show.

[23:50] I'm not going to open up my podcast after this.

[23:53] I'm not going to let everybody in on my first impressions of Stern's next game.

[23:57] I'm not going to let everybody hear me rant and rave about Toy Story 4 and how I think

[24:01] it's the biggest cash grab ever.

[24:02] I'm not.

[24:03] If you want to listen to Canada, yes, I've made it super easy to listen to me.

[24:07] And if you want to listen to Canada, this is what the show is like.

[24:10] This is what my club members get every single week.

[24:12] But I think this show is too important to keep it behind the paywall.

[24:16] And I'm going to ask my club members right now, are you okay with me releasing episode

[24:20] 713 to the mass public so everybody can hear.

[24:25] And so I want everybody to hear this show.

[24:27] And if you don't listen to Canada's Pinball podcast anymore, I want you to reconsider that.

[24:31] I really do.

[24:32] And again, just like spooky pinball, all deposits to Canada's pinball podcasts are non-refundable.

[24:38] In closing, spooky, remember what got you to where you are.

[24:44] Don't burn the people that support it you all these years.

[24:48] Your customers and your distributors, you need to think about it.

[24:52] I get it.

[24:53] The money's nice.

[24:54] You're seeing those big figures stack up.

[24:56] But I'm here to tell you, Canada's not doing this anymore.

[24:59] I'm not doing non-refundable deposits.

[25:02] I'm not spending 50% more than a game used to cost.

[25:06] If Stern said we're remaking Ghostbusters Pro and it's now $9,000, I would be just

[25:12] as upset as I am seeing TNA now being 50% more money.

[25:17] It's just not there.

[25:18] I don't see it.

[25:19] I'm not locking money in.

[25:21] The hobby needs to check itself.

[25:23] Because all of a sudden, here's what's happening.

[25:25] It's scary.

[25:26] Is Stern Pinball looks like the greatest bargain in all of pinball?

[25:31] Is this crazy?

[25:32] All this is doing is helping Stern Pinball convince all of us that a premium is worth $9,000.

[25:39] It's not.

[25:40] None of this.

[25:41] This is all crazy.

[25:42] Remember when it used to be fun to say 10k by Christmas?

[25:46] Now that's the reality for a single level game from spooky.

[25:51] Everybody, Canada Pinball out.

[25:53] I love you.

[25:54] Thank you for the support.

[25:56] We'll be back.

[25:57] Hopefully with Stern's reveal.

[25:58] That's the other part.

[25:59] Why would you buy a game on a Thursday of this week when Stern's about to drop something

[26:05] major in a week or two?

[26:07] Just wait.

[26:09] Trust me.

[26:10] Even if these TNAs sell out on day one, you're still going to be able to get one for either

[26:16] $9,000 or less.

[26:19] Nobody's going to pay over nine for a TNA now that they've flooded the market with 50%

[26:24] more games.

[26:25] Trust me on this.

[26:27] Canada's looking out for you.

[26:29] It's also why nobody will come on my show anymore because I have to say this stuff.

[26:33] But I don't care because this is what I love doing.

[26:35] Everybody have a good day.
