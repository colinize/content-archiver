[04:20] Canada, the world's biggest spooky chill is in the house.

[04:25] What's everybody up to this Saturday morning? Christopher,

[04:28] Franchi is here. Welcome to the party, Franchi. It's gonna, look, it's gonna be,

[04:36] it's gonna be an interesting week. So let's do this. Let's go around the horn.

[04:41] Let's talk about all these companies, what they have going on.

[04:45] Let's talk about stuff in order or somewhat of priority, if you will. I think there's a lot of

[04:52] a lot moving, a lot grooving, a lot of people sort of adopting, I think, a new behavior.

[05:00] And I want to introduce a new concept to everybody.

[05:04] You know, for the longest time, it was Wade and C. And it's still always gonna be Wade and C.

[05:07] But I want to change it up a little bit to W, P, D. All right. So I want everybody to think about

[05:20] those three letters. W, P, D should be everybody's new approach to pinball moving forward.

[05:29] I think it's a very positive approach. And I think it's something that will be beneficial

[05:34] to everybody. And what W, P, D stands for is Wade. Wait, you know, don't pull the trigger right away.

[05:43] Don't worry. Don't worry. No one's gonna take your bottle of milk from your babies. Like, nobody's

[05:48] gonna scoop up all these games. They're not gonna be hard to get. There's not a single game

[05:54] that has been hard to get. Like, think about it. So wait, then P stands for play. Play the damn

[06:02] game first. Play it in every trim. Make sure you, you want it. Make sure it clicks with you. And

[06:11] when I say play it, play it more than just once. Sleep on it. Go back and play it again a little bit.

[06:23] You know, I want to see these people that's stern and invited. They play the game for just like

[06:27] a few plays. And they're all making content. How amazing it is. It's that ramps. So play.

[06:37] And then the last letter D, then decide. Decide if you need to own it. Decide if you're gonna wait

[06:50] for the code to mature. Decide if this is a company you want to support. Decide if you see the value

[06:59] in this pin. And then decide if buying right now is even a smart decision. Wait, play, decide.

[07:16] And I think that is the healthiest thing to do. And I think that is the reality of all modern

[07:24] pinball launches now because there's no FOMO really. There's only gonna be FOMO if there's 500

[07:34] LEs. Buy it because you want it. You have a pause of steel, man. You got to admit, man, like this hobby

[07:43] ran for years on people buying stuff before they even played it. Before they even knew what was in

[07:50] the game. Times of change, gang. I mean, it's different, man. You could run out of everything.

[07:57] You could run out everything. And you'd be fine. Now you run out everything. You got to annihilate it.

[08:05] There's a weird static noise. Are you guys hearing a weird static noise? Here's it just keep.

[08:13] We went cold on three machines. Sound is popping a bit. Your mic, okay, hold on a second.

[08:23] How about now? Let me go into my system settings. And let me do my input.

[08:30] It's probably my output volume is popping a little bit. How's that?

[08:33] Oh, wait, hold on. Well, that's why. How's that? The input was the, the input was the MacBook.

[08:50] Is that better? Still there?

[08:55] I'm going to read joy. I think my mic was messed up when I joined. So everybody just come back here.

[09:12] Check the connections. I don't think I had the connections, right? Sounds like the gain is high.

[09:20] All right, hold on. Come right back here. I'm going to end the stream and redo it.
