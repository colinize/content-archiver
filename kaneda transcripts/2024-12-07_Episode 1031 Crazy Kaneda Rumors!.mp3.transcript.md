[00:00] You don't have to answer, leave a hanging on the left eye, falling for you.

[00:12] Gloria.

[00:12] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:16] Oh, my apology, everybody, for the delay getting this show up on a Friday.

[00:23] Gotta be honest, massively hungover.

[00:26] Massively, I feel like I woke up and I still was buzzed, then I felt terrible, then I recovered,

[00:32] had a little Gatorade, some electrolytes, but I'm gonna make this show worth your weight.

[00:37] Thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[00:40] We've lost a few members.

[00:42] I'm not gonna lie, we lost a few members.

[00:43] We're down to like 724, and now that the Twippies are back, the Twippies are back, and

[00:50] Best Podcast is a category, Best Content Creator, Best Streamer.

[00:56] So get ready to vote people.

[00:57] The voting opens up January, I think, 3rd, and goes through like the 20th, and it's gonna

[01:04] be this year, not at Texas Pinball Festival.

[01:07] It is going to be at Wormhole Pinball with a maximum attendance of 40 people.

[01:14] Now the thing I don't know what they're gonna do is, are they gonna invite people who are

[01:18] up for an award, because that would make it a lot of fun, because what I do think makes

[01:23] the Twippies really special.

[01:25] I mean, it was nice being at TPF and having like over 300 people in a room celebrating

[01:32] pinball.

[01:33] It was also nice seeing people get up there and give speeches, so I'm not sure how they're

[01:37] gonna do it, if they're gonna ask people maybe for award videos to play, if they're gonna

[01:43] do it that way.

[01:44] But I do appreciate the fact that the show is back, and we will recognize the best in

[01:49] pinball, and hey, maybe Canada might even win the Best Pinball Community Member.

[01:55] That would be one that I think we should all vote for Canada on as well.

[01:58] So here's what I wanna do on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:01] I've been getting some really good, juicy rumors from one of my best sources in all

[02:08] of pinball.

[02:10] This is the individual that told me really long time ago it was gonna be Evil Dead.

[02:16] This individual has claimed to have seen stuff with his own eyes, and he's given me some

[02:22] information that I'm gonna give to you.

[02:25] And what's interesting about this is I think it's gonna cause a lot of fun speculation.

[02:31] I think it's also gonna make people realize why waiting and seeing is still always the

[02:37] way to go.

[02:39] This seems like over the last three to four years.

[02:42] Ever since Godzilla, there really hasn't been a game that's just been amazing.

[02:48] Think about it, Godzilla really was the last wow-wow game that we got.

[02:53] I think we've been waiting long enough to get something that's gonna blow us away,

[02:58] and I know that there's a lot of awesome themes in the pipeline with these companies, just

[03:04] none of them are out yet.

[03:06] None of these great themes are out yet.

[03:08] I wouldn't say Evil Dead is a great theme.

[03:11] Avatar is not a great theme.

[03:13] X-Men were tired of all the Marvel stuff.

[03:16] It just hasn't been like back to the future Karate Kid, Die Hard, Total Recall.

[03:21] Like I wish I was ringing off a lot better themes in pinball, Conan, Rambo.

[03:27] You know you could just keep going on stuff I'd rather have.

[03:30] Yeah I was looking at the 40th anniversary of stuff that came out in 1985.

[03:35] If pinball companies just went down the list of the movies that came out in 1985, this

[03:42] hobby would be amazing.

[03:43] It would be 10 times better because one of the games that year is Back to the Future.

[03:48] One of them would be Rocky Four.

[03:50] One of them would also be the Goonies.

[03:53] One of them would be Breakfast Club.

[03:55] One of them would be Rambo Part 2.

[03:57] So a lot of awesome stuff would be out in the pinball world.

[04:00] I think Commando by Schwarzenegger.

[04:02] So we're going to talk about what this person has told me and I'm going to let you guys

[04:07] know on this show exclusively.

[04:10] What we're also going to get exclusively real soon in the world of pinball is some clarity

[04:16] around why Mr. Christopher Franci does not work at Stern Pinball anymore.

[04:21] There's been a lot of rumors, a lot of people are saying it's me.

[04:24] Some people say it's my fault, some people say it's because he was selling Beatles artwork.

[04:28] And so who better to go to than Mr. George Gomez is going to sit down with Mr. Franci

[04:33] and they're going to clarify the entire thing.

[04:36] Interesting.

[04:37] I mean, I don't think I've ever seen anybody ever do this, really ever.

[04:40] I don't even mean just in the pinball world interviewing the company you're no longer

[04:44] with about why you're no longer with said company.

[04:48] And I'm just happy we're going to get clarity on all of it.

[04:51] Hopefully it's not my fault.

[04:52] So we shall see soon.

[04:54] And Chris and I are back on speaking terms, which is good.

[04:57] If I could give Christopher Franci any advice right now, I think you're in a good place.

[05:02] I think you're going to crush it over at Spooky Pinball.

[05:04] And I think sometimes you just got to let the past be the past as well.

[05:08] I mean it.

[05:09] I mean it.

[05:10] But I also appreciate his passion and his, his inability sometimes to let stuff go.

[05:15] I know he cares a lot.

[05:17] And I would much rather have people who care and are willing to engage and also willing

[05:23] to fight back and they get tired of people saying stupid stuff that's not correct.

[05:28] And that's why he's doing it.

[05:30] I wish I was surrounded by people at work that have that level of like urgency to set

[05:36] the record straight and also to deliver great work time and time again, which is what he

[05:40] does.

[05:41] All right.

[05:42] So that's going on in pinball.

[05:43] Okay.

[05:44] So before we get to the rumor, it's going to be a little bit of a shorter show.

[05:46] I just want to get right to it.

[05:48] I also want to talk about this photo from Chicago Gaming Company.

[05:53] I don't think there's been a moment this year that has made me go, huh, what the heck are

[05:58] they even thinking?

[06:00] Did they not even look at their own image of what they're sharing with the pinball community?

[06:06] It is a photo of them shipping some pulp fiction games, maybe they're Ellie's going overseas

[06:14] and on the box of each game, it says, do not stack and this side up, right?

[06:21] They're supposed to have the bottom on the bottom and don't stack a game on top of a

[06:25] game.

[06:26] And in the photo, they've stacked games on top of each other and they also have games

[06:31] sideways.

[06:32] So the top is not the top.

[06:34] And I saw that and then inside the copy of the post, they also said that they are now

[06:40] experiencing some delays and nobody's going to get their pulp fiction Ellie domestically

[06:46] anytime in December.

[06:48] Really?

[06:49] You think you're experiencing delays now?

[06:51] Has it been two years this spring or three?

[06:53] I've lost track of how long.

[06:55] I know it's been at least two years.

[06:57] I am so happy that I sold my spot for a thousand dollar profit and I am never looking back.

[07:06] I don't like this company.

[07:08] I don't like how they operate.

[07:10] The fact that nobody even looked at that photo and said, what are we doing?

[07:15] We can't put this photo out there.

[07:17] This makes us look like we're incompetent and yet they did.

[07:22] And so shame on you, Chicago gaming company.

[07:26] Shame on you for revealing a game so many years ago.

[07:30] There was absolutely no reason why you should have revealed pulp fiction when you did.

[07:35] You clearly don't need to make pinball machines to make money.

[07:38] Seriously, think about it.

[07:39] They reveal a game and they have nothing on the line for two years.

[07:44] That doesn't make any sense.

[07:46] But you're not a pinball company.

[07:47] You're a wood making cabinet company, whatever Churchill cabinets are, and you do pinball

[07:53] on the side.

[07:54] I'm tired of pinball companies on the side.

[07:56] I want my pinball company to just make pinball machines.

[08:00] I don't want them to have ancillary revenue streams.

[08:03] And when we look at the pinball companies that are successful, it's always the pinball

[08:07] companies where they need to make pinball to be successful.

[08:11] It's really that simple.

[08:13] Modern pinball, spooky pinball, barrels of fun.

[08:16] They don't have any extra annuity coming in from anywhere else.

[08:19] I'll throw Dutch pinball in there.

[08:21] I'll throw multi-morphic in there.

[08:22] I mean, I think Jerry makes money off of licensing P-Rock, but still, he needs to make money off

[08:27] of his pinball stuff.

[08:29] When we look at the companies that have been flopping and failing for the last few years,

[08:33] Jersey Jack doesn't need the pinball sales to survive.

[08:36] Neither did American Pinball, but I think Mukesh is tired of giving them money because

[08:40] Amtron has all the money.

[08:42] Money's not coming from the pinball sales.

[08:44] When I think about companies like Pinball Brothers and Padready and all that stuff,

[08:48] I don't know.

[08:49] Right?

[08:50] I don't know.

[08:51] They can't be making much money off of the pinball sales.

[08:52] So right now in the entire pinball world, the three companies executing the best right

[08:57] now, barrels of fun, spooky pinball, and stern pinball.

[09:00] A real knucklehead move to put that photo out on the internet.

[09:04] All right.

[09:05] So here's what I'm hearing people.

[09:06] I'm hearing, yes, Dungeons & Dragons and King Kong are the next two games from Stern Pinball.

[09:12] We recently flipped the order of those games.

[09:15] It was supposed to be D&D and then King Kong.

[09:19] I'm now hearing it is going to be King Kong and then Dungeons & Dragons, but that's not

[09:24] the juicy rumor.

[09:25] I think both of those games are right around the corner.

[09:28] I think they're both ready to go.

[09:30] And we know Stern will release games now that are not nearly finished.

[09:34] We're back to those old bad habits where the code's not complete and you're going to buy

[09:39] a game and you're going to lose 30 to 40% of its value by the time the code is complete.

[09:45] And anyone who unboxes a modern Stern LE that's not made by Keith Elwin is going to lose $3,000

[09:53] or more.

[09:54] It's just that simple.

[09:55] Every single one.

[09:57] You can't name me one $13,000 Stern LE that is not a Keith Elwin game that has not lost

[10:06] $3,000 to $4,000 in just a year.

[10:09] That is a very sobering thing to think about.

[10:12] If I'm Seth and I'm George, you got to be staring down that bullet.

[10:16] You got to make it 500 LEs.

[10:19] It's so stupid they went to a thousand on every LE.

[10:23] The only time you should make it 1,000 LEs is if it's Keith Elwin.

[10:27] All right.

[10:28] So here's what I'm hearing now.

[10:29] I am also hearing that the Goonies, this is what my source has told me, that there is

[10:35] a Goonies pinball machine that is coming out.

[10:41] And the Goonies pinball machine that this person has seen is coming out from spooky pinball.

[10:47] Again, this is my rumor source guy that's always been right.

[10:52] He said the game is huge.

[10:55] He said it is a wide body and he says it has a humongous pirate ship on it where the cannons

[11:04] fire pinballs.

[11:05] He said it is absolutely amazing looking and it is one of the coolest world underglasses

[11:12] he's ever seen.

[11:14] So one eyed Willy's pirate ship humongously tucked under the glass.

[11:20] The Goonies from spooky pinball.

[11:23] Now here's what gets interesting.

[11:25] I thought that the Goonies was being made by barrels of fun and I thought spooky had gremlins.

[11:32] Maybe it's reverse.

[11:34] I also was asking around and I found out something very interesting that Warner Brothers does

[11:41] not allow you to have an exclusive deal on a license.

[11:47] So ostensibly two pinball companies could actually apply to make the Goonies.

[11:55] So this is crazy.

[11:56] I don't know if this is happening but imagine a world in which barrels of fun is also making

[12:04] the Goonies and two Goonies machines get developed.

[12:09] Now spooky pinball is making the Goonies and so is barrels of fun.

[12:14] I'm not saying that's going to happen but it is possible.

[12:17] Then barrels of fun would actually beat spooky to market with their Goonies machine because

[12:24] their next machine is coming out this spring and spooky pinball is not going to unveil

[12:29] its next game then.

[12:30] They've got to make all these evil deads over the next year or so.

[12:35] So that is very interesting.

[12:37] I'm almost ready to say I'm here to confirm spooky pinball the Goonies huge pirate ship

[12:44] Hey you guys that's why you should wait and see.

[12:47] The reason why nobody wants you to know this stuff is because I know most of you would

[12:53] rather have the Goonies over evil dead.

[12:56] It doesn't take anything away from evil dead.

[12:59] It's a really cool game.

[13:00] I think they did it a lot of justice.

[13:02] I think it's a great theme integration.

[13:04] It's just not nearly as popular as the Goonies.

[13:08] So we shall see.

[13:09] Now Canadian is not done.

[13:11] He just hung over.

[13:12] He's got another bit of information for you.

[13:14] So the second thing or second game that my source says he has seen is going to make things

[13:20] very interesting.

[13:21] It's not a theme we haven't heard about.

[13:23] He says he has seen with his own eyes the matrix from Jersey Jack pinball.

[13:31] He also has told me that the game will be Jersey Jack's return to wide body machines.

[13:38] Now what was interesting when I asked him about this I said wait a minute is it Eric.

[13:43] Is Eric making the matrix.

[13:45] I thought Eric was making Harry Potter.

[13:48] Now I still think Eric is making Harry Potter.

[13:51] He then went on to describe for me something he saw on the matrix.

[13:56] You're hearing it here first.

[13:58] When you watch the Matrix movies the third movie when the Sentinels are attacking Zion

[14:04] and one of the characters right is in that like exoskeleton suit and he's firing the

[14:10] machine guns with each hand.

[14:12] The big exoskeleton guns attached to his hands.

[14:14] It's kind of like the suit in Avatar.

[14:17] He's firing those guns.

[14:19] What I'm hearing is that those guns are featured on the slingshots really big on the slingshots

[14:29] of this wide body game in exactly the same location where there's the proton beam cannon

[14:37] shots in Star Trek the next generation pinball machine.

[14:41] Go look at a Star Trek next generation it's got those two guns by the slingshots.

[14:47] Guess who made Star Trek the next generation.

[14:50] Guess who made that wide body game.

[14:52] A guy who's now over at Jersey Jack pinball by the name of Steve Ritchie.

[14:57] So all of a sudden I don't think that's just coincidence.

[15:00] I think Steve Ritchie is making the Matrix.

[15:03] We know Steve Ritchie loves to recycle his old ideas.

[15:07] I mean Elton John is a full recycling of old ideas.

[15:10] Heck I feel like Matrix might be very derivative of Star Trek the next generation but here's

[15:16] the good news is it's starting to feel like Jersey Jack's going to go back to loading

[15:20] up their games and they know they need to.

[15:24] Nobody's going to buy these empty games.

[15:26] Avatar is empty people.

[15:27] It's empty.

[15:28] It's absolutely empty.

[15:29] There's no toys.

[15:30] Nothing really interacts with the ball that's very creative and it's 12 to $15,000 and it

[15:35] doesn't seem like the game justifies that price.

[15:38] So I think we're going to see Harry Potter and I think we're going to see the Matrix

[15:43] and I think we're going to see both of those games next year.

[15:47] I think we're going to see Potter in February March and then I think we're going to see

[15:51] Matrix by the end of the year.

[15:53] I think that's going to be how Jersey Jack does it.

[15:56] Now look if they nail Harry Potter and the Matrix, I mean this, if they nail both games

[16:02] and do them justice, they'll sell those games for the next few years just like they sold

[16:09] guns and roses for three years.

[16:11] Jersey Jack when they only make one game at a time, right?

[16:14] They really only make one game at a time and they put everything into it.

[16:19] They need it to be a banger and now the problem is who's going to buy Avatar now?

[16:24] Who's going to go buy an Avatar now?

[16:26] Who's going to put $15,000 on an Avatar CE when you've got Harry Potter from Eric

[16:32] Minier and Steve Richie's The Matrix coming?

[16:36] I wouldn't.

[16:37] I know you probably want to get your money back.

[16:39] I mean it's why they never should have made Avatar.

[16:41] They just never should have made it.

[16:43] It just didn't make any sense.

[16:44] It's like you're making it, they've done two movies, there's three more movies coming

[16:47] out even just common sense timing wise.

[16:50] It doesn't make any sense.

[16:52] The Avatar story is not even close to being done and also the second movie just didn't

[16:56] hit.

[16:57] Everybody remember I'm going to automate it tomorrow morning.

[17:01] I will be there at automated.

[17:02] I'm happy to say that Todd Tucky is going to be there.

[17:06] His wife wanted them to just keep doing the activities they love and it does help to be

[17:11] around people.

[17:12] Todd I look forward to seeing you tomorrow and we're going to have a good time.

[17:15] We're going to have a good time.

[17:16] We're going to tell stories, we're going to laugh.

[17:18] It's always a good time at automated.

[17:20] Thank you so much for being a member of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[17:24] Get your Twippy votes ready.

[17:25] Get ready to see the Goonies, maybe two Goonies machines.

[17:30] Get ready for Steve Richie's The Matrix.

[17:32] Get ready for Eric Minier's Harry Potter.

[17:35] Stuff's coming people.

[17:36] Stuff needs to come.

[17:37] We need these great games.

[17:39] We need these great themes.

[17:40] King Kong, Keith Elwin, great game.

[17:42] The mediocre stuff's not going to cut it no more.

[17:44] Just ain't going to cut it at these prices.

[17:47] Great theme, great integration.

[17:49] Everything has to be magical to take up room in your game room.

[17:53] You're out of space and you don't want to spend this much money.

[17:56] Something has to emotionally make you free up that capital and free up that room.

[18:01] And I hope it does it.

[18:02] I can't wait to see what we get this year in Pinball.

[18:05] I love covering this hobby and I love that each and every one of you tune in every week
