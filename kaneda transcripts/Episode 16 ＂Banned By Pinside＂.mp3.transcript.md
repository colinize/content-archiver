[00:00] You're all a bunch of fucking asshole.

[00:05] You know why?

[00:07] You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.

[00:13] You need people like me.

[00:16] You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers

[00:22] and say, that's the bad guy.

[00:25] So say good night to the bad guy.

[00:28] Come on.

[00:31] Last time you're gonna see a bad guy like this again.

[00:35] Let's go.

[00:43] Ladies and gentlemen, strap in because episode 16 of Canadian's pinball podcast begins now.

[00:51] I think in reggae Glacier said it best when he said,

[00:56] do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?

[01:03] Oh, in reggae I know, I know.

[01:14] This is gonna be a special edition of Canadian's pinball podcast coming at you live from New York City.

[01:21] I've been getting a bunch of inquiries throughout the day.

[01:24] People have been asking me, are you still gonna do the podcast after what's happened?

[01:28] And I want to just start out by saying yes,

[01:31] Canadian's pinball podcast is not going anywhere.

[01:34] We are still gonna come at you every few days with some great pinball commentary.

[01:39] We are still gonna line up great guests for you guys who will talk pinball

[01:43] and all the exciting stuff going on in the hobby.

[01:46] What has happened over the last 24 hours really is not gonna change anything.

[01:50] In fact, it's actually gonna make what we do on this podcast even more exciting

[01:54] because we don't have to worry anymore about upsetting certain individuals.

[01:59] So to give you guys the background of what happened in the last 24 hours,

[02:05] I was permanently banned from pinside this morning.

[02:09] And it stemmed from an incident that happened yesterday, a threat I posted.

[02:14] But before I get into that, I'm sort of gonna tie two things together.

[02:18] I made a promise to an individual that I would clarify something

[02:22] and I'm gonna do that first.

[02:24] And I think this also will connect nicely to what happened on pinside

[02:29] over the last 24 to 48 hours.

[02:32] And we're gonna get into all of that tonight.

[02:35] First, if you heard my last podcast, I talked about people deactivating their accounts

[02:42] and people who are very hyperactive on the forum, sort of walking away

[02:49] and saying enough is enough.

[02:51] And we've seen a bunch of people deactivate their accounts on pinside recently.

[02:54] We saw Rare Hero.

[02:56] We've seen almost every member from JJP deactivate.

[02:59] We've seen Rick from PPS deactivate.

[03:02] And so in that podcast, I made some comments about how I thought it was lame

[03:06] that Rare Hero deactivated.

[03:08] Especially since he has been so strident and vocal on the forum.

[03:14] And he reached out to me.

[03:17] And it wasn't Rare Hero reaching out to me.

[03:20] It was Greg.

[03:21] And Greg is the man behind Rare Hero.

[03:25] I am not a candidate, people.

[03:28] I'm Chris.

[03:29] And he sent an email to Chris.

[03:31] And he asked me if I would do something.

[03:33] And he asked me if I would clarify why he deactivated his account.

[03:39] And I don't want to share all the details around why he deactivated.

[03:43] There was a lot of personal stuff in there.

[03:46] Greg is going through a bit of a family crisis.

[03:51] Actually a really serious family crisis.

[03:54] And I wish him the best.

[03:55] And we actually conversed about having gone through similar things.

[04:00] And it hit me.

[04:01] And it really stuck with me that what happens on the forum

[04:06] and the way we talk to each other is very much in act.

[04:12] In act by all of us.

[04:14] We all have our avatars.

[04:15] And those avatars behave in a certain way that is not always indicative of who we are as people.

[04:21] And oftentimes that avatar and that sort of chasm between the real person

[04:29] and the online persona can get very, very, very far apart.

[04:35] And I want to say on this podcast that I'm sorry that I said the things I did about Greg

[04:42] because when Greg told me the reasons why he deactivated,

[04:46] of course I felt bad about saying the things I said.

[04:51] Because I didn't know.

[04:54] And that's the whole thing about online personas is you don't know what someone is going through.

[05:03] We like to make a lot of assumptions about people.

[05:06] And we like to judge a book by its cover by what people post on a forum every day.

[05:11] But Greg is, it seems he's going to come back.

[05:16] He's taking a break.

[05:17] And he's going to be back when he gets his next machines.

[05:22] It looks like he's in on a ghost bus or something else.

[05:25] But he's got to deal with some family stuff.

[05:27] And we all, we all should put the most important stuff in front of Pimball.

[05:33] And he's doing that.

[05:34] And I just wanted to start tonight's episode by saying Greg, I know you're out there.

[05:38] I said I would make these remarks and I do stand behind them.

[05:42] And I am sorry for saying that stuff.

[05:44] And this is not a podcast where we're just going to arbitrarily slam people.

[05:50] But there are going to be times when we're going to make corrections.

[05:55] And we're going to change our minds on things.

[05:57] And that's part of being a human beingly, is gentleman.

[06:02] So Greg is going to be back.

[06:04] Rare hero is going to be back on Pinside.

[06:07] Now someone who's not going to be back on Pinside is me.

[06:11] And that wasn't my choice.

[06:16] It wasn't really my decision.

[06:21] But let's talk about that.

[06:23] And when I got notice of the permanent ban, I was really, you know, it's not like I'm mad at myself.

[06:30] I'm not even mad at Robin.

[06:32] I'm not mad at the moderators.

[06:34] I'm not mad at all the different people on there that just trolled every single one of my threads.

[06:42] I was mad at one person and one person only.

[06:45] And that is frank.

[06:47] Now, for those of you who don't know when Robin reinstated Mayor unfroze me about,

[06:56] I want to say three weeks a month ago, much to all of your chagrinns.

[07:01] I said to myself, Kaneda, this is your last chance.

[07:08] These guys have given you so much leeway and bent the rules because of all of your dangerous malicious duplicate account posting.

[07:19] I'm kidding, by the way, people that dupe account was the most innocuous thing I've ever seen.

[07:25] Kaneda, you should really get some help on how to communicate and articulate yourself properly so you can stay a benevolent member of the Pinside community.

[07:37] So what I did was I went out there and I hired someone, his name is Frank, and he became Kaneda's, let's say, communications director, press secretary.

[07:49] Now Frank's job was simple.

[07:51] Frank's job was to help me from me.

[07:54] Frank's job was to stop me before I emotionally responded and typed up something that I would later regret.

[08:04] And he would vet everything. So before I would post something, I would run it by Frank.

[08:08] And I had Frank on speed dial. I was able to text him immediately every time I was going to write something.

[08:16] And he was going to filter it and make sure before I put something up, it would be okay.

[08:22] So after being banned, I was mad at Frank because last night he said he couldn't do it.

[08:31] He couldn't help me out. So it was just me posting raw.

[08:34] And so I called him up and I left him a message and here's what I said to him.

[08:40] What happened, Frank?

[08:47] You get cold feet? You decide you're better off here, after all?

[08:52] You figure it's more companies here, you know, old hopeless, and in this after all.

[09:01] Yeah, thanks Frank for nothing.

[09:04] Let's talk about Canada's being banned from Pinside.

[09:09] And I think everyone should go on and read the thread that was the final thread of mine.

[09:16] And I want to talk about yesterday and a day that I spent playing Pimball, enjoying Pimball, sharing a Pimball experience with the forum,

[09:27] and how personally hypocritical I think the decision was and I happily accept anyone to come on and disagree with my statements.

[09:38] Here's the day. I went to, when I spent the day driving around the Hellcat first, it was so nice out on my way back to Park the Hellcat.

[09:46] I said, you know, let me stop at Jack Park because I know they have the Hobbit and let me place some of the Hobbit.

[09:52] And as most of you know, I've been really down on the Hobbit. I played it at the 5th of State Bar in Brooklyn when it first came to New York and I felt it played slow.

[10:02] I felt that it played floaty and I didn't think the gameplay was going to win people over.

[10:11] And I admitted that I couldn't really hear the machine well, I couldn't hear the callouts.

[10:16] And so I was underwhelmed. I was underwhelmed and I feel that people who have pre-ordered the Hobbit without playing it might be in for disappointment.

[10:28] And I don't think that's a crazy conclusion to come to. I think any time you play a Pimball machine before playing it, it's a silly thing.

[10:39] But yet we see it over and over and over again.

[10:42] So I was down and out on it. And then when I went to New Orleans and I played Game of Thrones Ellie, I thought it was a far superior pin, far superior.

[10:49] And I put up a pretty controversial and polarizing podcast about how I thought Game of Thrones Ellie just blew the Hobbit away. And it did for me. And I admitted I would only played both machines a few times.

[11:01] But in those first few instances, I thought Game of Thrones Ellie was the far superior pin.

[11:07] But I heard from a lot of people. I heard from a lot of people. It is way too early to be making up your mind. And they're right. And I agree.

[11:14] So I went to Jack Bar to play the Hobbit. And when I got there, there was someone on it. It was on 500,000.

[11:25] If you got 500,000, you got a free game. And this guy was pretty good. And he just kept getting free games. And so I played a few games of Waws that was next to it.

[11:34] Which had broken upper flippers on both upper flipper playfield. So hopefully they addressed that because you can't play that game without that working.

[11:42] I played a couple games of Game of Thrones premium, which was really fun. And really didn't shoot as smooth as the machine that Tiger Law had in New Orleans. But it was still a fun machine.

[11:54] But I wasn't there for Game of Thrones. I was there to play the Hobbit. So I finally was able to jump on and I played the Hobbit a lot.

[12:01] I had a few friends that were there from the Pimball League that I'm a part of. And we just kept pumping money in the Hobbit.

[12:10] And when I first got there, one of the kids mentioned that if you look at the left lamp, the ramp, it was loose.

[12:20] And you could see it had broken apart where the welding was. It didn't affect the gameplay. We were playing.

[12:26] I must have played for about a good 45 minutes on that machine. Probably seven or eight games. And I have to say my mind was changed on the Hobbit.

[12:40] Not I didn't do a 180. I'm still not head over heels and love with the machine. But I definitely definitely had a much more positive experience with it because of one reason the game played faster.

[12:54] And the flippers were stronger. And I enjoyed that. The ball was getting up the ramp much easier and it was much easier to control the ball with more power.

[13:05] I started to get a sense of the modes a little bit. I still don't I don't really know how to select which mode you're going to start.

[13:17] So a cool mode that I experienced was it was called interrogation. And that's where legalus is interrogating an orc and he's like holding a knife to his throat and you see it on the screen and you have to keep bashing that same orc.

[13:31] And when you bash it, I think three times the legalus cuts his head off really, really cool. So I'm starting to warm up to it.

[13:38] The one thing I still can't get over and I don't think there is a solve for this is the upper right flipper.

[13:49] It has no purpose. People it has no shot. And so that's another thing I wanted to see on my second time with the game if there was like any reason for that thing being there.

[14:00] In fact, I think that upper right flipper is the reason why the ramp broke. And I'm going to explain why.

[14:09] When one of the shots you can hit with the upper right flipper barely hit with the perfect full power shot is it can sometimes hit the left ramp and go up and actually make it's way up the ramp.

[14:24] But it's definitely not there for that shot. It's definitely not designed to consistently hit that shot.

[14:30] And so that was my main takeaway.

[14:35] Oh, and the far left ball rail that goes down and is supposed to drop the ball and hold it in the out lanes. You can then fire it by hitting the button on the apron.

[14:50] That rail oftentimes the ball just kicked out. So that was my experience. And I get home. And my friend sends me a picture of the ramp broken. And he's like, we the game busted.

[15:04] We just a normal shot and the full ramp came off. So I thought, hey, wouldn't this be useful information to share with people who are waiting for the hobbit?

[15:19] And I put up a post. And in my post, I wasn't negative. I wasn't accusing Jersey Jack of anything with quality or anything. I simply shared an image of the broken ramp.

[15:36] Some other issues I had with the game. And my opinion about the game, which was positive that the hobbit was really starting to grow on me.

[15:47] And immediately after posting that immediately, the very first post, this guy, why snow, who's Hilton is his name, who I swear, just sits in a cave somewhere and hits refresh on Pinside and waits for every new post.

[16:02] And it responds in a matter of seconds. Like it's kind of scary. I think some of some of us on there who are hyperactive posters need to get out a little bit. Like literally I put the post up and he responded right away. But what did he respond with?

[16:15] He was accusing me of putting up a negative post saying, I shouldn't have done it. I should have before posting that, I should have called the operator and let them know about the issue.

[16:30] And I was just like, wait, wait a minute. It's a Sunday night. And we're playing the hobbit and it breaks. And now of a sudden, now of a sudden there are rules to being able to share that experience on Pinside.

[16:45] There are, I didn't realize there are steps you're supposed to take before sharing a highly anticipated machine breaking down in the wild and you can't post that immediately.

[16:57] Really, really was that something so horrible to do? And instead, instead of people actually discussing what this man and would they, you know, would they have time to fix this if this is going to be a problem on a lot of the machines.

[17:14] And a lot of the machines are on the line. All that it turned into the whole thing became blaming me for posting it, attacking me for sharing that information.

[17:28] And I get it. It's all that Pinside has become for me lately is I start a thread and I want to talk about something and what happens?

[17:41] People come into the thread and they attack me. They personally insult me over and over and over again. And what happens? Does the moderation team do they warn or reject the people that are trolling my, my thread?

[17:57] No, they allow it to take place. They completely, it's almost like when a, when a cricket cop just like turns his back and allows his partner to beat the crap out of like a witness.

[18:13] It's just the level of personal attacks that I get all the time. It's fine too, guys, because you have to admit I have the thickest skin. I don't retaliate.

[18:22] I don't snap back and start personally insulting people. I did snap back a little bit on why snow because I just think like he's absolutely ridiculous, ridiculous, health and you know, do us all favor buddy and stop living on Pinside every single day 24-7. Go buy a smartphone and enter the 21st century, my man.

[18:43] The guy doesn't have a smartphone. I mean, it's 2016. And you know, he, how dare he accuse me of not having, of not having the right to post something like that.

[18:58] So, and then the irony is, so through all this, I get banned by the moderation staff and the reason they give me for the ban is that I wasn't being nice. Rule number one, be nice.

[19:12] So I, I do challenge you guys. Go back, read that thread. Look who is being nice and who is being naughty. Look who was personally attacking people and look who is just putting something up there for people to, to see.

[19:26] And, and it's, you know, it's quite clear. It's quite clear the incredible bias that has existed on there since I've been back. You know, since I was back, there was a target on me mainly because there was a group of people that weren't happy with my account being unfrozen.

[19:46] And, and that's fine. Every time I would write something, they would all run to the moderators and complain. And they would complain during every one of my posts.

[19:57] So, it makes total sense why Robin and the moderators would just say, hey, like, let's just get rid of him because we have to work so hard to address all of the mobs complaining. It's just much easier to get rid of him.

[20:18] So, that was it really. And I don't really think Robin's going to let me back on because of the voice message I left him after I learned that I was permanently banned. I'll just play that for you guys now.

[20:31] You know, fuck, you got nothing. Not a lot of talking to me. You're here because you got nothing. You got nothing in court. You don't got the bookkeeper. You got nothing. Nothing. And if you were a man, you would have done it now. You don't got a thing. You're punk.

[20:44] Where do we go? Where do we go? Where do we go now?

[20:52] We're not going anywhere. And I'm excited because this is going to be a new period where I can speak much more freely about the topics we've been discussing on this podcast without fear of repercussion from the, from the, from the pin-side moderation team.

[21:08] And it's not going to feel that much radically different than what I've been saying before, but you have to admit, is anyone else out there talking about the subjects and the issues that people love to talk about on a daily basis and capturing the back and forth nature of it like I am?

[21:25] If anyone else is, please point that podcast out and I will happily give them a shout out. And let's, let's talk about the topic I posted yesterday because I can't talk about it in the thread.

[21:36] The hobbits are on the line, people. They're making the pinball machine. How is it not concerning to people who are about to get it that there may be a design failure in the ramp?

[21:52] How is that not something that people should be really making sure they get right? And I love the cavalier nature of a lot of the people who are again slamming me in that thread saying it's a test game guys. It's meant to break.

[22:07] Okay, this game has been testing itself for two years now. I don't expect the games that are out there right now in the wild to have significant parts like a rampie breaking. Do you?

[22:24] And if you look at the ramp guys look at it not only is it just welded at these tiny points that's going to break that's going to fail proven just happened yesterday but look at the ramps themselves guys.

[22:38] There's no there's no post in front of those ramps they're going to get destroyed over time. So what is what does that mean? It means there is work to be done on the hobbit.

[22:51] But the hobbits about the ship the hobbit has to ship has to be on the line if they're going to hit that mid-march deadline. And I've said this and I've said it before for those people who think that this machine has been tweaked and improved upon it over the last couple years.

[23:09] I don't think so. I think they've been bringing the same game around at different shows and they haven't really had many out there and they haven't had many in the wild and they hasn't been tested properly yet to be on the line.

[23:22] And the first owners the first owners of this machine are going to be just like the first owners on was and you guys are going to be the guinea pigs and you waited the longest and I hope stuff doesn't break.

[23:34] I hope it doesn't but I'm saying I would be real concerned to see a major piece in the game break like that and I think it needs to be redesigned and if you disagree fine that's cool but I think it's a conversation worth having.

[23:48] Instead of grabbing your pitchforks and blaming me should be thankful that I brought that to your attention I bet you JJP is looking at that today being like what happened here what do we need to do. So that one was on the house.

[24:02] I'll say that I'll get some more of them.

[24:06] A very nice.

[24:09] And now that I can say kind of whatever I want it's going to get kind of crazy on Canada's pinball podcast. I'm going to say something else that might upset some people right now.

[24:19] I asked for refund on my alien Ellie pre-order today I had put down 1500 US dollars on an alien Ellie I was number 95 and I asked for a refund.

[24:33] There is just no way with all that's coming out that I'm going to spend the money on alien.

[24:39] If you're in on alien and you love the theme and you're excited for this pinball machine then I hope you enjoy it. I really do.

[24:48] I think this machine has become for me the hardest machine to judge and critique on pinside because of people's inability to separate what's in front of them from their enthusiasm for oric and his contributions to the community.

[25:08] But what I'm going to say here and it's not even me saying this I think people are starting to catch on and I think people are starting to catch on real quick that what has occurred here and what the final product is is far short of what people expected considering how vocal and outspoken oric spin about play field art.

[25:34] I mean the guy literally said that ACDC look like shit because it was just clip art dropped on the play field.

[25:44] What are we getting with alien people it is the exact same thing there's just a bunch of little clip art drop everything is clip art there's nothing drawn on on all of alien.

[25:56] And I just love all the people hiding behind the excuses after excuses after excuses there's one simple fact and this is nothing personal but I don't understand why he took the job to design the play field or is a creative director and I've said this in in threads I haven't said on the podcast.

[26:23] He's not an artist in the sense of the word where he puts pen to paper and can draw a play field he's not the two translates that he's sold that people love the shadow the ACDC these weren't hand drawn works of art by oric he takes clip art he takes art that he finds and he arranges it in a way that looks really nice.

[26:52] That's worked for him so far so far but now that he has to do the whole play field it's not working it it's it's so incredible how much of a pass this game has gotten and and the excuse after excuse people keep making I just can't wait I can't wait until ghost busters is revealed and I think it's going to be any day now and the reason I can't wait is we've all done it.

[27:21] I can't wait is we've all seen probably that little leaked image of the play field there's more drawing and there's more detail in that little piece of the play field then there is in all of the alien art package all of it combined there's no drawing on the alien back glass is no drawing on the cabinet art there's there's no real drawing on the play field except for little flames around clip art and inserts and and that's being prayed.

[27:51] He's pleased come on guys if any other company revealed that as the alien play field you guys would lose your shit but again it's because of who it's coming from and he's getting a pass but he's not going to get a pass on can it is pinball podcast I think that my overall opinion is that that theme is incredible I think Andrew didn't really know like what he was doing when he hired or as an artist I I think I'm not sure if I can do it.

[28:21] I think that he saw probably that or got a lot of positivity around his translates and his you know plastics that he was making and whatnot but the man was taking art and dropping it and making it look better but when you have to start from scratch and you can and the world's your oyster you can design an alien play field to be what you want I just don't buy it that that is all fox would have approved.

[28:51] Look at all the other alien merchandise that's out there all the other stuff that fox has approved all the awesome comics all the awesome alien art on deviant art some of that's fan made but even the stuff that fox is officially put out are you telling me they wouldn't have approved if someone really went like with a Geiger style and I don't know but I'm just going to say now that I can that my money will be back in my pocket.

[29:21] And it's either going to go towards ghost busters or I'm going to wait I really there's nothing else really coming out other than ghost buses that I feel I might just pull the trigger on because it could just be incredible other than that I'm going to wait and see what the future holds but that's going to be it for episode 16 of can is pinball podcast it's it's been an interesting 48 hours.

[29:51] I have recorded the interview with Ted that I'm going to air in the next couple days so look out for that one now that the best way to reach me is going to be through the gmail I want to give that to you guys again it's canada pinball K and EDA pinball gmail dot com and it's been real nice knowing you and inside people will see what happens there.

[30:17] Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back expect me.
