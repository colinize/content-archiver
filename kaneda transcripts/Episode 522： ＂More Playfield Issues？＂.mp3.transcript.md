[00:00] Welcome to episode 522 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts, here's what we're going to talk about.

[00:23] Are there new play field issues on Jersey Jack Pinball's guns and effing roses?

[00:28] Oh my god, I can't believe I'm looking at a picture where there's pooling under the post.

[00:33] Is Gary Stern lying about Stern Pinball having 5,000 games back ordered with Stern Pinball?

[00:42] Do they have Harry Potter as a license for Stern Pinball?

[00:46] And there's a gun and roses collector's edition that an owner is selling for a good cause.

[00:52] We're going to talk about all that and nothing more on Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[00:58] So here's the thing, I did a show about a half hour ago in which I basically went off on this

[01:05] image of guns and roses Ellie and I think the game is coming from Jack Bar in New York City.

[01:11] There's a picture of pooling under the post and the picture doesn't lie, the picture has not

[01:18] been manipulated and you can clearly see that there's pooling happening underneath the post.

[01:23] The reason why I took this show down and I just didn't want to air it the way it was originally

[01:29] recorded is I want to find out some more information around this. I need to see more proof

[01:34] that this is affecting more than just one game. I need more data before we put the nail in the

[01:40] coffin that this is once again going to play a Jersey Jack release because I really hope

[01:45] I hope that this is not a widespread problem. I hope they don't have to hit pause on the assembly

[01:50] line like they did with Willy Wonka because nobody who's in on a collector's edition or an

[01:55] L.A.R. Any machine wants there to be pooling and chipping underneath the post. Now here's the

[02:00] thing too. We just saw at the virtual pinball expo Mirko, he did a little bit of a demo of his new

[02:08] play field quality after he's holding up a baby. I mean that's a great political move by Mirko to

[02:15] hold up his little baby and then talk about his play fields as if they'll never be mad at me again

[02:22] because I'm a father. No, but what he did do is he overtorked a post up to the point where the

[02:28] post itself actually shattered and the play field seemed like it was completely fine. But here we see

[02:34] on Guns and Roses pooling and rippling underneath the post. So which one is it? Which one is it? Is

[02:40] this going to be a problem that plagues Guns and Roses machines or has Mirko fix the problem?

[02:46] It doesn't look great right now because I'm looking at a picture in which there obviously is an

[02:50] issue still. But then the question is was this play field made before before Mirko's sort of new

[02:57] process was put in place? We're going to find out real soon because here's what needs to happen

[03:01] right now and I mean this. All of you out there who have played Guns and Roses L.E.'s if you own one

[03:08] please please I implore you share images of your play field quality. Let us see what's happening

[03:15] with more than just one game. Let us know if we should truly be concerned if we should start

[03:20] sounding the alarm on this because you know if there is any pinball podcast out there that will

[03:25] sound the alarm on play field qualities. It's Canadian pinball podcast and we won't stand for this.

[03:30] We will not stand for this. There is no way that they can suffer this again. This has been too long

[03:38] and Jersey Jack pinball knows how painful it is to have play field quality issues and nobody will

[03:44] live with this stuff. People will not live with pooling. All right. Okay so we'll see what happens.

[03:49] There's more to come on this. This is a developing story that we are not going to let go and they

[03:53] know that it's the reason why Jack called me a horrible human being is when I would not let this go

[03:58] with a Willy Wonka pooling issues. But we're going to stay on this. No matter how much I love this game

[04:03] and I love guns and roses. I think it's amazing. I want my game to have good quality because this

[04:09] I hope this is not the Achilles heel. We always say this. Jersey Jack always finds in Achilles heel

[04:15] issue with every launch and if play field issues are still prevalent this could be what brings down

[04:23] this mighty game for people right now. All right so what else is going on in pinball? Do you believe

[04:27] that Gary Stern is boasting that Stern pinball has a back order of 5,000 games?

[04:34] Ironic he said 5,000 that's the exact number of guns and roses at least that are available for

[04:40] sale. So do you think Gary Stern is sort of making fun of Jersey Jack pinball and boasting that he

[04:46] has so many games on back order and that's cute that they have 5,000 guns and roses machines for sale.

[04:52] I'm here to tell you right now that none of us know the answer none of us know the true number

[04:57] but I think Gary Stern is lying about 5,000 games they need to make that they have orders on. That's

[05:04] total BS. 5,000 of them are back ordered. Okay Gary sure sure come on man like you guys are number one

[05:12] but we all know that you don't have 5,000 games on back order and if you did have 5,000 games on

[05:18] back order there would be no way we would see a new Stern pinball machine anytime soon and I think

[05:24] we are going to see a new Stern pinball machine in the near future and definitely by December so

[05:30] I think Gary is probably seeing all of the hype surrounding guns and roses and he's doing what

[05:36] Gary does he's the proverbial salesman he's always got to spin it and make it sound like you know

[05:41] it's better than it is and look Stern pinball doesn't have to make this stuff up they are a company

[05:46] that is by far in the dominant leader position in the pinball hobby I bet they have like 90% of the

[05:52] market so they don't need to say stuff like this and again because none of us ever know numbers

[05:58] all of the speculation around the numbers of games made and sales numbers it's all just speculation

[06:04] nobody knows you know I always hear all I heard like Metallica sold 8,000 units and 5,000 units who

[06:10] knows there's no nobody knows but the investors nobody knows but the investors and that is not

[06:15] you and that is not me but I think Gary is full of SHIT when he says he has 5,000 games to make

[06:22] that are back ordered no way no way so speaking of games in Stern pinball Joe Kamikaw loves to put

[06:29] these rumors out that big things are in the works over at Stern pinball and I know that the two titles

[06:35] that I keep hearing over and over again that could be the Kamikaw titles you've got I got three of

[06:41] them I heard Kamikaw might have the Harry Potter license he might have the Queen license and he

[06:46] might have back to the future and all three of those are juggernaut themes for pinball Harry Potter

[06:52] back to the future and Queen so do we think that Stern pinball has one of those or two of those or

[06:59] all of those are none of those right but here's the thing if I were to tell you would you be excited

[07:05] that Stern pinball is making Harry Potter I don't think most of you out there want Stern pinball

[07:11] to make Harry Potter we all would like Jersey Jack pinball to make a game like Harry Potter I mean

[07:17] it's just we know it's just that we know that it's Stern makes a game like Harry Potter what's

[07:23] gonna go into it it's and it's not gonna be that wizard world under glass that all of us would want

[07:28] we know that we know that and so it's just this weird phenomenon if you give if you ask anyone

[07:35] who do you want to make your dream theme if you could pick your company who would make it I think

[07:40] almost 90% of people would say Jersey Jack pinball just because you know that they would put more

[07:46] in the game and I think the only people that would say Stern are employees of Stern pinball and

[07:52] friends of Stern pinball employees I really mean that that if if I were gonna pick any company

[07:57] out there right now the two companies I would pick to make my dream theme are Jersey Jack pinball

[08:02] and Dutch pinball I think those two companies would really bring the theme to life in the best

[08:07] possible way okay and I mean that those two guys and I really hope Barry gets to make another

[08:13] game one day because I do think that Barry and the way Dutch pinball made big Lebowski I would love

[08:18] to see what their sophomore effort is you hear that poor man's sophomore effort all right guys I

[08:27] saw what you said there come on we're all just freaking having fun here making pinball podcast all

[08:32] right so what else is going on in pinball so so if you missed out on getting a gun in roses collector's

[08:39] edition I just saw one go up for sale last night and it's being listed so here's the thing this

[08:44] guy is going to sell this game and here's the situation he says lots of drama with the CE editions

[08:50] of guns and roses pinside is on fire about people not getting them so he is going to sell his game

[08:58] to the highest bidder and the person who wins it the money that goes over the 12.5 this gentleman is

[09:06] going to donate to a Cambodian orphanage and so your money will go to that orphanage so man I

[09:15] it's amazing you know I did the same thing with big Lebowski when I flipped it I didn't take any of

[09:20] the profit I donated the profit to project pinball and so here we have once again a sought after

[09:27] pinball machine is being auctioned off if you will to the highest bidder and the profit will not go

[09:34] to a flipper the profit will go to a good cause so here's your chance to get one I mean I have

[09:39] nothing negative to say about this I mean I think it's great that this gentleman is donating the

[09:44] money to a good cause like an orphanage because he's doing it this way too I doubt that Jersey Jack

[09:50] would yank the game from him for transferring the sale to somebody else you know right they're

[09:54] not going to come out and be like oh man we're going to stop you from donating to an orphanage now

[10:00] what the thing is the thing that I don't agree with is this guy is like you know here's your chance

[10:05] as a fan of this game to get it it's not going to go to a fan of a game it's it's going to go to

[10:10] the guy with the most money like this is not going to end up in a home of where belongs because

[10:16] ultimately a fan of Guns and Rose is a fan of pinball should you know wants the game at 12.5 I

[10:22] mean this is going to sell for a lot more than 12.5 so the question then becomes how much money do

[10:28] we think this is going to go for now what's exciting is this this is going to be the first legitimate

[10:34] secondhand sale of the of a Guns and Rose is collective's addition in which we will finally

[10:39] know for sure what the true market value of the game is right now and we know that right now the

[10:45] market value of the game will probably be maybe the highest it's ever been so we will see how much

[10:51] over 12.5 someone is willing to pay to get a Guns and Rose is now the final price is probably not

[10:58] the normal way it will sell simply because this is also going to an orphanage so people might

[11:05] go higher knowing that it's for a good cause so we'll see what happens here all right all right I

[11:10] also got hit up I got hit up by weighing down in Australia you know I'm not I tell it I'm not

[11:15] going to get involved in this Australian drama anymore I'm not going to do it you guys can

[11:18] police your own community and can a to definitely got taken for a ride with that bad information

[11:24] and I'm here to tell you once again Paul at pinball sales is a honorable gentleman and it was my

[11:30] mistake to report on that so quickly but I'm not going to get involved in outing out all these

[11:35] people they know who it is they know who it is down there they know who it is the people that I've

[11:40] been talking to know who it is so they can out this guy and do it with do what they want with him

[11:45] but I'm here to tell you once again if you buy from pinball sales you're not going to have an

[11:49] issue but I did get hit up by Wayne and Wayne is like you should have got your facts straight and

[11:54] you don't Wayne told me that that game he listed for sale for 39,000 Australian dollars or 27,000

[12:00] US dollars he's like that wasn't my game that was a customer's game who wanted me to sell it for him

[12:06] okay whatever you say Wayne I mean you're still listing a game for sale that is a flip of a game

[12:12] for a crazy amount of money on your site so I'm sorry but like if you have a website and you put

[12:18] something up for sale and I report that you're selling this game through your company why do I have

[12:24] to go dig and do all this information you put it up on your site all right and your customer who's

[12:29] trying to flip it for a profit yet everyone thinks that guy is a jerk for doing it right now

[12:35] and that's a crazy amount of money but also you know he's an opportunistic jerk because he's trying

[12:41] to cash out when the game is in super high demand so we'll see where all these guns and roses

[12:46] collectors editions net out I'm not sure I hopefully there's not play field issues because if there

[12:52] are play field issues that is going to do to the guns and roses collectors editions what it did

[12:57] to the Willy Wonka collectors editions it really will it's going to create a ridiculous delay to get

[13:03] to them and will people want to wait four five six months I got a text message last night that was

[13:08] like people no one's going to see a C.E. until March until March no there's no way they're going to

[13:14] make people wait until March to get the collectors editions now what I would like to know is this I do

[13:19] think Jersey Jack Pimball needs to do a better job communicating the when like when are people going

[13:24] to get any of these games that they ordered and when are CE buyers going to start to see C.E. games

[13:29] I think the mistake they might make and I'm not sure yet but how does Stern run their alleys right

[13:35] Stern shows us how it's done right Stern runs all their alleys at once so all five hundred

[13:41] Avengers get made at one time I'm a little worried Jersey Jack's going to start going back and forth

[13:47] like make 100 C.E.s then go to 100 alleys 100 S.E.s and they're going to go back and forth on it

[13:53] I think it wouldn't be smarter to make them all at once but again I don't know how they're going

[13:59] to do it I don't know how they're going to do it they they don't have the ability to make the

[14:03] games as fast as Stern they don't have as many people there they don't have as many lines

[14:08] so maybe they have to do it this way I'm sure they've been thinking this through a lot but we do

[14:13] know that when you pay the most amount of money as I always say you should get on the plane first

[14:19] and I think CE buyers are starting to start to feel what what wonka buyers did why am I spending so

[14:26] much more money and people who aren't spending as much are getting the experience well before me

[14:33] at a certain point you get tired of seeing people who paid less than you have all the fun I mean

[14:38] that's really what it comes down to why are these people who paid less than me having all this fun

[14:43] for months and I'm still waiting now I know you're going to say like well wait until the quality is

[14:49] there and you're going to get the best built machine and that's fine and I don't think people would

[14:53] mind that but then it better be true you can't wait for months and you get a CE and there's like

[14:59] play field issues so this thing better work out I really hope it does because I want this game

[15:04] to not have a JJP Achilles heel I want them to get it all right okay all right anything else going

[15:10] on the pinball world that we should be aware of let's see I got a couple new patreon donators I

[15:15] need to thank so thank you so much let's see we got Kevin McKenney Kevin thank you for donating

[15:21] to canators pinball podcast and Joshua Matson I think I said that right I'm Joshua thank you so

[15:27] much for donating to canators pinball podcasts for those of you out there listening can

[15:31] a to pinball podcasts go to patreon we would accept anything bubble would be so happy for any

[15:36] donations to the show and that's where we're at right now I mean there's not a ton of news going

[15:40] on the pinball world Avengers games are going out left and right I think nobody cares about Ninja

[15:46] Turtles anymore I think that game sort of slid into a little bit of obsolescence really quickly

[15:51] will stern have a new machine to compete with guns and roses of rumors arts led Zeppelin who knows

[15:59] camo cow is working on something big with stern pinball is it going to be Harry Potter is it going

[16:03] to be back to the future who knows who knows I just know that whenever people talk about those

[16:08] juggernaut themes they would rather have Jersey Jack make the game especially after seeing

[16:14] everything that Jersey Jack is put into guns and roses right that's like the new expectation

[16:19] and I do think we're all about to be very disappointed because I don't think we're going to see

[16:24] that level of theme integration in most pinball machines moving forward I think that's just going

[16:28] to be the case Gary Stern is completely making up they have 5,000 orders to fill if he wants to

[16:34] share that we will happily look at the order form if he has 5,000 backlogged what's the truth

[16:39] around these miracle playfields are is the problem solved or is is there still and what's the truth

[16:45] around miracle playfields is the problem solves I'll say this right now nobody cares that you're

[16:49] holding up a baby they want to make sure that the baby we pay for which is our pinball machines

[16:54] they want to make sure that baby is of the best quality and now is going to be an interesting few

[17:00] weeks in which people share what is going on with these guns and roses machines because pictures

[17:05] don't lie pictures don't lie nobody cares what you say you did we want to see the games themselves

[17:11] hold up over time okay so this has been episode 500 and 22 of canada's pinball podcasts it wasn't

[17:18] a long one there's not a lot going on I'm trying to get more interviews on the show but my computer

[17:23] broke my other computer with all of my Skype software and recording software it needs to be sent

[17:29] out to apple for repair oh so it's just going to be me for a while before I can get that fix everyone

[17:34] we'll talk to you soon have a good day
