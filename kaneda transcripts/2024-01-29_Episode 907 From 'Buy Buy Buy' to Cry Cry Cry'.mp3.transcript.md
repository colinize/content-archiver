[00:00] What can I say, except you're welcome, for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:07] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome, I'm just an ordinary daily guy.

[00:13] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:18] Alright everybody, welcome back, welcome back to Chris and Ice, Bad Boys of Pinball Show.

[00:24] Chris has invited me to do another show, so Chris, what's this one about, what's this one about?

[00:31] Alright, so the title of this show is from Bye Bye Bye to Cry, Cry, Cry.

[00:37] And what I mean by that, it's a little hyperbolic, but what we mean by it is this,

[00:41] the phrase Bye Bye Bye, right, has worked really well in Pinball for many, many years.

[00:46] If you went in on a game early, especially the limited edition games, like that's where the FOMO lies.

[00:52] For so many years, I've been covering this hobby, Genghis, for 10 years.

[00:56] If you went in on mostly every single LE, you made money or you didn't lose any money.

[01:03] And chances are you made a lot of money, so it was a really solid advice for many, many years.

[01:09] And now the market has shifted, and so what I wanted to do was a show in which we looked at

[01:15] games over the last like year and a half, as these manufacturers have increased their volume,

[01:21] they've increased the price. What would happen to consumers, right, if they bought each of these

[01:28] limited edition and collector's edition versions of the game? Did you break even?

[01:34] Did you lose money? Did you make money? And we're going to total up. What would have happened if

[01:40] someone bought every single one of those limited edition games? And I think it's going to be eye

[01:46] opening. I think it's going to be somewhat shocking. And look, if you love the theme and you're never

[01:51] selling a game, it doesn't matter. So you could turn off this episode right now. But I think we're

[01:56] all feeling it, Genghis, right? Everyone's feeling the pressure right now. Prices are high. Are the

[02:02] themes the problem? Are the prices the problem? Are there too many LEs? We're going to go into it,

[02:07] but we're just going to imagine what the journey's been like for consumers.

[02:12] Chris, is this Wait and See video? Because I don't think I can make a video like that,

[02:19] my friend, because you know, I sell games. Yeah. Bye bye bye is awesome for me. I've recently

[02:28] joined your podcast and you have a huge following in there. People love you. Congratulations with

[02:34] that. I've been there for a week now, I think. And when you say wait, when you say wait three months

[02:40] and you will still have three, four thousand in your pocket, when you talk like that, when you say

[02:46] buy on the secondary market, then we don't sell games. Well, here's what I think is going to happen,

[02:51] Genghis. I think then. Yes. And manufacturers, I mean. Right. But what's going to happen now is this,

[02:58] the next big shift, SHIFT, that's going to happen in Pimball, is these manufacturers have

[03:06] prevented distributors like yourselves and like everybody out there, CoinTaker. We all know the

[03:11] distributors, you know, Pimball Star, Flippin' Out, whoever you are. For the longest time,

[03:16] they prohibited you from selling a game below map pricing. But what did we see Stern do this year?

[03:22] For the first time ever, they said, hey, you can sell the inventory you have currently

[03:27] for lower than map pricing. And what we're going to see, I think now that everybody's realizing,

[03:34] if I buy Elton John at $12,000, do I wait? And I bet you they're going to allow you to sell you

[03:41] an Elton John Platinum for maybe 11, for maybe 10, 5, right? A distro can legally, right? They're

[03:49] not going to be confined to this map pricing. And it's going to be like buying a car, Genghis.

[03:54] Last year's models, new inbox, you're going to have to get a discount or nobody's buying that game,

[04:01] because the second hand market is going to set the value for the game moving forward. Look,

[04:07] distros need to get together and actually tell these manufacturers, hey, we might be too high

[04:14] with the MSRP, right, of these LEDs and CEs. And hey, you might be making too many of them.

[04:20] Now, we're going to talk about JAWS on this episode, because I think that's a little bit of an

[04:23] anomaly. Can I say just one thing? I don't know if you know this, but

[04:28] what did Godzilla cost? Was it $10,500? Yeah. So that's 2,500 more than Godzilla, right? If

[04:39] you buy the JAWS. Yes, the new ones. Distros can't be all that angry on Stern, because it's not,

[04:46] Stern is not getting the whole deal of the cake. Stern is giving a bit of the cake to us distros also.

[04:54] So how much do you make on an LE? Why is that a mystery to everybody? Why is consumers? Do we

[04:59] not get to know what your cost is? Cenkis, would you tell us what you pay for an LE? No, you won't.

[05:05] Exactly. But we all know. Manufacturers are sweet, they're so kind to us distros, so they let us in

[05:11] on this. I think when you bought your Godzilla for 10,5,000, and you didn't open it up, you just sold

[05:20] it to, how much? I think 15, I got for it at the height of COVID. Yeah, absolutely. It was crazy.

[05:28] Yeah, you did nothing and you got 15,000. How does that make Stern feel? They shouldn't feel bad at all.

[05:36] They made a great game and there was more demand than supply. But you know what? For every Godzilla,

[05:41] there might be a Venom. There might be a James Bond. And look, I am not going to say that I think

[05:49] anyone should be spending 50% over to get a Godzilla LE. I wouldn't, I wouldn't if that game was 10,5.

[05:56] But you got to remember when Godzilla came out, that's right when COVID happened and the frenzy

[06:02] happened. So for the longest time in Pimbalgengis, there used to be a period where games like Batman

[06:08] and Ghostbusters and all the Stern LEs, they made 500 usually of most LEs and they were around like

[06:14] 8,000, 8,500, 7,500. And if you scalp those games when the demand was high, Iron Maiden was like this.

[06:22] You paid probably 1,500, 2,000 over for a scalp price. And I guess these companies saw

[06:29] this super inflated prices people were getting during COVID. Remember, I remember when Stranger

[06:35] Things LE sat in a box for a year and it was $9,000 at the height of COVID pricing.

[06:43] Right? At the height. A new in box Stranger Things LE would have fetched you $19,000.

[06:50] And that is why Bye Bye Bye for so many years was actually really smart because if you were on a

[06:56] distro list to get an LE, you were actually being given free money. Your game was going to be worth

[07:02] more money than you bought it for because more people wanted it. And let me use another.

[07:06] If you were lucky, if you were lucky to get an LE.

[07:09] But even it's interesting, COVID even bumped up games that didn't really go up in value for a

[07:15] long time. Games like, let me use an example, games like Guardians of the Galaxy LE. Remember

[07:20] when that game came out? Yeah. Uberla, Buble-B, whatever, you know, there was that code issue.

[07:25] Yeah, people weren't fighting over each other to get an LE. That LE sat at like 8,500 or 9,000

[07:32] for like two years, you could easily get one. Nowadays, Jeng is you can't even find a single

[07:38] Guardians LE for sale. If you do find one, you're looking at like maybe 15,000, 16,000. And look,

[07:47] now that stern has said, we're never going to make a game. That's an anniversary edition. We're not

[07:53] going to make one nicer than an LE. I think all of those old LE's are going to hold value. They're

[08:00] going to go up in value because they're never going to make more. You don't know that. They said

[08:05] they're not going to do that. Yeah, you don't know that. Okay. So, but what I wanted to look at though

[08:11] is post COVID, right? Where we are today, if we were to look at the games over the last

[08:15] thing is I want to say something about that. Chris, let's talk about Iron Maiden. How many

[08:21] did they make? Cheers, buddy. 500. Okay. Iron Maiden LE was like $15,000 game and it came out back in

[08:29] was in 2018 or something, whatever. Yeah. So, you can buy Iron Maiden LE from 2018 has got like

[08:37] 500 games. It's worn out or you can buy a brand new built premium with brand new artwork. Yeah.

[08:46] I mean, the playfield is the same, right? The game is the same. It has got great artwork.

[08:51] And did they say it should cut 13 or should it cost 10,000 as a premium cost? What was it like

[08:57] premium price? The new ones? Yeah, the premium, every premium is the same price right now. So,

[09:02] no one's spending more money on a premium. Yeah. So, this year if there will come another Iron Maiden

[09:09] with new artwork, premium for 10. Will you buy that brand new, updated all the MacMacks,

[09:16] everything is updated and perfect, no errors or nothing. Or will you buy a, you know,

[09:21] five year old used one for 15. So, it does destroy the old. But here's the thing, the

[09:27] LE is always going to be the only one worth collecting because the premiums are unlimited.

[09:32] And whenever you have an unlimited amount of a game, it's never going to be worth more than the

[09:36] limited. So, an Iron Maiden LE, what would you buy? I would always buy the, I would buy the,

[09:42] I would still buy the LE of Iron Maiden for 15 because here's why, here's why. I would buy a

[09:48] brand new build with new artwork, everything new. Look, no matter what you do,

[09:54] nobody, no matter what you do to a premium, you'll never be able to turn it into an LE.

[10:00] And Iron Maiden, again, because those games from that period, remember, now that every single new

[10:06] LE is 13,000 and there's a thousand of them, right? And we don't know if these games are amazing or

[10:13] going to be classics. Like Iron Maiden is considered one of the best games ever made,

[10:19] right? And it's a Keith Owen masterpiece on a lot of levels. I think Iron Maiden is probably going

[10:25] to slide down around the 13,000 dollar period. The games are coming down. That's the good news,

[10:30] is everything's coming back down to earth, right? Whether you were a $15,000 Iron Maiden or you were

[10:36] an $18,000 Stranger Things LE, now that's turns making more premiums of Stranger Things, right?

[10:43] We're seeing the LE prices come back down to earth a little bit. I just saw the other day,

[10:48] someone wanted to get a Batman premium and distros are like, well, that's a $13,000 game is what a

[10:54] distro is selling it for. And the guy was trying to trade in his Star Wars premium, and he got offered

[11:00] $6,000 for the premium of Star Wars to buy a $7,000 difference. It is getting bonkers. And I think

[11:09] the greatest distros needs to make money. Okay, but that's a lot of money that they're under. They're

[11:16] really a lot of money. They're really undervaluing the guys Star Wars and they're really overvaluing.

[11:22] And how does when you sell your old car and you get a new car, you won't get the street price of

[11:27] your course not of course that look that's yes, you're going to get the worst price imaginable

[11:32] from a trade in with a distro. Everybody knows that like you're going to get more money selling

[11:35] it privately. But here's the thing, but you don't have the hassle. When you when you sell the

[11:40] privately you have some has a with this totally totally. Alright, so let's say let's say you caught

[11:44] the pinball bug over the last two years and you hear about bye bye bye and if I buy the le's and

[11:51] the CES, that's the best game to buy. And what we're going to do right now, Jeng is we're going to

[11:56] look at the data and the numbers we're going to see are what was the MSRP of that game new in box.

[12:02] And if you waited and you didn't buy that game when it got revealed right the FOMO window if you

[12:09] avoided that FOMO window and you went to buy the game today on the second hand market, we're going

[12:14] to look at what the cheapest you could get the game for. And this is going to be really interesting

[12:20] then we're going to tally up if you bought each of these games, how much money would you have lost

[12:26] I'm just spoiler alert, you're going to lose money, how much money you would have lost if you

[12:31] went in on all these games. If you just wait it, do you have the numbers? Do you have the numbers?

[12:36] I have the numbers. I did this. I did some homework. What the game sold for? Yes, yes, these are so

[12:41] here's the thing and we were talking about this earlier. What I have is all the games that sold

[12:48] on pin side. Now look, whatever the list price was, the game either sold for that price or most

[12:55] likely less money right no one's going to offer you more than your list price. So oftentimes we

[13:00] will see like $9,000 or best offer, which means that person is obviously willing to take a little

[13:07] bit less than 9k. So yes, we are going to use those numbers. And again, I know this is not like

[13:12] an exact science where there's there's a lot of delusional people, jeng is who have games listed

[13:18] for sale that are and they're never going to get that much money. For example, there's a lot of

[13:23] Foo Fighter LE guys that think they're getting 11, 5 or 12 for their used out. They're not getting

[13:28] in it. They're not getting anywhere near that they can list it for that much money. But if they

[13:32] want to really sell their game, they're going to have to you know, move the price down. So should

[13:37] we do this? I did some for for sale 9,000 with 17 games. Yeah, I don't get it. I don't get it.

[13:45] I don't get it. It's like the guys that still have Elvira 40th new in box like those guys

[13:50] waited way too long and missed the market on that game. We're going to talk about that game too at

[13:56] the end. There's it's a notable loss. I think that game is a very delicate. Why? Why? Because I have a

[14:04] lot of distro friends. Yeah. And I don't want to mess with people's income because I like buy buy buy.

[14:12] You know, right? Of course you do. Yeah, I like buying too. I just don't I just don't want to

[14:18] ignore the fact that's on the wall right now, which is if you allow FOMO to make you buy these

[14:24] games on day one, there's a good chance now it's not going to work out. And here's the other part,

[14:30] Jengez is, you know, and again, the data shows this, it's just not hard anymore to find any game

[14:36] anymore because they make so many of these CEs and Elvys that at any given time, there's like 15 or

[14:42] 20 for sale. And we're going to talk about, you know, after we go through the last year and a half

[14:47] of games, let's talk a little bit about JAWS and what we're seeing with JAWS right now. And I think

[14:52] the reason we're seeing some JAWS spots open up is like we're not seeing people flip that game for

[14:57] 14, 5 or 15. You know, I think people are getting nervous that maybe we've reached the point.

[15:02] And I believe this firmly, Jengez, that $10,000 to me is a little bit of a price ceiling is nobody

[15:09] really wants to consistently spend more than $10,000 on a pinball machine, regardless of the

[15:16] trim. And I think now that it's also expensive, that's why we're seeing the prices come back down.

[15:21] But let's start our journey. Are you ready? Okay, so let's do this video for the consumer,

[15:26] for the collector. Yeah, why would I? Who else would we make videos for? You make,

[15:30] well, we're going to make videos for manufacturers and for distributors.

[15:34] I have friends everywhere, you know, I don't know, I don't know, I see the other angle also.

[15:41] Yeah, but here's the thing, Jengez, and I firmly believe this, no distributor wants their customers

[15:46] to be losing this much money either. I know all the distributors are talking about,

[15:52] they don't want to like, hey, I got you one. And then like a few months later, they're like,

[15:57] shoot, like if I had just waited, like, I'm seeing the secondhand sale of like,

[16:02] a game like Godfather and like, no one wants, no one wants to pass on such an extreme loss to

[16:07] their customers. And that's why I think, you know, these, these manufacturers need to listen to the

[16:13] distributors, they need to listen to the themes customers want, they need to listen to how people

[16:18] are responding to the prices of these games. And I'll tell you this right now, the reason Stern

[16:23] Pinball changed its policy on the anniversary edition of games, because you know, and I know,

[16:30] they were getting ready to drop an anniversary of Godzilla that was going to make the Ellie's

[16:34] worthless, they were going to drop an anniversary of Batman, an anniversary of Jaws, and they heard

[16:40] from the distros, if you do this, you will burn everybody who's been collecting your Ellie machines

[16:48] and they've changed you. It wasn't just me. No, I talk from your following for all your followers.

[16:56] But it's not just me, I heard from like Melissa, coin taker, they have been,

[17:00] they've been telling George Gomez and he listened to them. Now, whether or not they stay the course,

[17:05] we've seen Stern lie to us in the past. Remember when they're like, we're not making any premiums

[17:10] of walking dead. Remember that? All right, so let's let's jump into it. Let's this is going to be a

[17:16] really fun episode. So we're going to start on the first collector's edition. We're going to start

[17:22] with this Scooby Doo. Now Scooby Doo December 2022. Now Scooby's a little unique because they

[17:29] didn't say we're only making this many collectors editions. They made 1969 Scooby Doo's in total,

[17:35] and they would make as many CEs as people ordered. Now, Jeng is with a butter cabinet.

[17:40] How much do you remember how much Scooby Doo cost? If you ordered it, fully load it with

[17:45] butter cabinet, how much do you think that game was in total? With butter, I want to say 10,

[17:52] five or 10, 800 or something. The game itself was more like, I think it was like 9,900 and

[18:00] something plus the 1400 for the butter, they increased the price of the butter cabinet on Scooby.

[18:05] The total price of the game new in box with butter was 11,169 dollars.

[18:11] Okay. Right? We don't know how many CEs there are out there. No, we don't. We don't know the

[18:16] exact number. But okay, but if you bought that with butter, you love Scooby Doo. Okay, but here's

[18:20] where it gets interesting. If you wanted to get the same exact game, right? And one just sold for

[18:27] on December 10th of 2023. So just like a little over a month ago, that game with 47 plays

[18:34] with with butter cabinet, right? Just sold for 7,750 dollars, 7,750 dollars, which is a loss of

[18:46] $3,419 in literally just one year. Is that on pins? Yes, it's on pinside. All this is verifiable

[18:57] on pinside. And look, we all know this, Jengus. The game damaged. The game's not damaged. Most

[19:03] people who collect pinball, we know this, they don't play their games. It is like they are like

[19:09] movie posters that they just like watching them light up when they go into their game room.

[19:14] And these things are mint. Like, and I would also argue that some of these collectors take better

[19:19] care of their games. And they fix some of the issues. So when you buy a used one, you're actually

[19:23] getting it in better working order. All right. So that's games for 7,000. Okay. Ready for the next

[19:29] one? And that's a popular game. It's a well-liked game. Yeah, it's a but the thing is this, there's

[19:35] a lot of them. And it's a long wait to get it. And now it's like people have moved on the Looney

[19:41] Toons and Texas Chainsaw, where Scooby Doo feels like, you know, yesterday's news. Toy Story 4,

[19:47] this was the big one, right? This was the one where Jersey Jack had the Toy Story license.

[19:52] You know, everybody loved Toy Story. We couldn't wait to buy this game. I got burned on this game.

[19:57] I lost my deposit on this game. Nobody, nobody thought that they would only make Toy Story 4,

[20:03] right? One of the weirdest marketing decisions ever. And this is also when Jersey Jack raised

[20:08] their prices post guns and roses. Jeng is dreamer. How much they asked for a collector's edition of

[20:13] Toy Story 4? 15, $15,000, right? New inbox. All right. And look, all of us would have bought it

[20:20] at 15 and held on to it. If the game was Toy Story 1 in Andy's room with actual toys in the game.

[20:28] Okay. So as of recently, ones, they've been selling. Are you ready for it? How much you think

[20:34] they're going for right now? I don't want to play this game. Chris, you tricked me into this.

[20:41] CE, I want to say, I want to say 11, 5.

[20:48] No, there is a, you can get a CE now for $9,900, which is a loss. Are you ready for it? A $5,100

[21:02] loss on one single game, a $5,000 loss. And look, it's easy to get. Maybe it has played a lot of games.

[21:12] No, I'm telling you, like, this is what the market is on this game. You are not seeing them go for

[21:18] like 11 or 12, like you want to, you can get one for right around $10,000. And you're talking about

[21:24] CE, right? Not LE. These are collective editions. I don't consider Jersey Jack LEs to be LEs. They

[21:30] make too many of them. All right. So look, you might be thinking like this is just Jack Guinari

[21:34] getting greedy, right? This is them being delusional after Guns N' Roses. But this isn't a Jersey Jack

[21:39] issue. It's an industry wide issue because the next game on our list, the George Gomez James Bond

[21:47] Limited Edition. Neil McCrae bought 999 of these things to corner the market. Every James Bond

[21:54] fan was like, this game is amazing. The code's incredible. How much was that game brand new,

[21:59] Jeng, is the LE? The LE made the jump to 13,000. 13,000. Yup. And it was it was announced in September

[22:08] of 2022. Right. That's when it came out. It came out in 23, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're waiting

[22:14] on the final code update. Okay. Nowadays. Okay. So about a year's gone by. How much can you go get a

[22:21] James Bond LE that was originally 13,000. What do you think?

[22:29] The game is popular today. So I don't think it's got down that much. I mean, people love James Bond,

[22:35] man. I love it. Yeah, I want to say about 10 511. Okay, 10 511. Right now. And it's not sold right

[22:44] now. There is a mint condition one for sale $9,500 or best offer or best offer 95 or best offer,

[22:54] which means he'll take lower than that. And the game hasn't sold. So it's and it's a game in mint

[23:01] condition, which is a loss of $3,500. All right, here's where it gets interesting. Now, what did

[23:08] they do after that James Bond? Remember, I told everybody Keith Elwin's going to have a fourth

[23:13] version of James Bond single level game 60th anniversary spectacular. And remember what Stern

[23:19] charged for that game. If you bought this game that James Bond 60th on Stern's website on day one,

[23:26] Geng is how much did they asked for that game? You said it was priced right. You said it was

[23:32] no, I did not. I did not. Was it you? It wasn't me. It was our friend. It was our friend at,

[23:38] you know, it was Zach said that he said he thought it was priced right.

[23:43] It's fine. You know, look, nobody knew this was going to happen. So but what was the price?

[23:47] Because remember that Stern $20,000 $19,999 and remember what Stern did after they sold them?

[23:57] They removed the price from the website. And then they tried to do the call for price shenanigans

[24:03] because literally what was happening was this is that distros got the game for 15.

[24:08] Stern thought they could sell them off for 20. And it was a nice $5,000 payday right for every

[24:13] single one they would sell. And there was going to be 500 of them. Now look, they sell out they

[24:18] don't remove the prices always. Yeah, but like really, really weird, right? Because remember

[24:24] with all the distros, nobody had like an advertised price. Everyone said call for price. And that was

[24:30] really weird because when Stern sold Elvira 40th, they didn't even sell it directly. The only game

[24:38] where they sold it directly at like a premium game was Batman SLE. Remember Stern sold everyone

[24:44] direct for 15k. All right, so James Bond 60th. Obviously, nobody's really buying this game for

[24:51] for anywhere near 20. What do you think you can go get one for today? Or what do you think the lowest

[24:56] price is that one sold for recently?

[25:01] 15,000 5000 loss. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so this is crazy, right?

[25:07] If it's 15,000, the lowest the lowest sale recorded was a $12,000 one. Okay, there is a

[25:15] new in box one listed right now for $14,000 for new in box. Yeah. And so I would say that like

[25:24] around 13,000 is the average of what this game is trading for. And that's a loss.

[25:31] It doesn't have to 5000 games play. Right. So Jengas, here's what's crazy. That is a loss. If you

[25:37] bought it on day one, and I didn't even factor in if you had to pay tax on Stern's website,

[25:43] you're about $22,000 in on this game. We're going to just say you bought it for 20. And you lost

[25:49] $7,000 on this super limited rare Keith Elwin machine. And I'm just saying that's crazy. That's

[25:56] like losing an entire pinball machine in value in just less than a year. And look,

[26:03] Godzilla Pro, do you know that? What's up? That's a Godzilla Pro. That's a Pro. That's a

[26:09] window. That's that's what I spent on my Lord of the Rings, Ellie, when I got into pinball 10 years

[26:14] ago, I bought an Ellie Lord of the Rings for $7,000. It is bonkers. And also look, this was a

[26:21] learning lesson for Stern. And I'm happy that the community pushed back against this game.

[26:25] It didn't work out, right? It had on paper, this must have seemed like a great idea, right? Keith Elwin,

[26:31] 500 James Bond, all the characters, and it didn't work. And now the game is just, you know, I don't

[26:37] even think it's settled at 12, like we're going to see where it goes. So okay, so after that,

[26:43] we got Jack Danger's inaugural title, which is going to win game of the year. We got Foo Fighters,

[26:48] Ellie, right? In February of 2023. Another game, Genghis, that was 13,000 new in box.

[26:54] People love this game, right? I mean, they love it. I mean, there's, there's only,

[26:58] you only hear great stuff about the gameplay, about the artwork. You could argue that Foo

[27:02] Fighters is a little bit of a polarizing theme. You know, is this something that is going to be

[27:07] bolted to the floor? What do you think Foo Fighters is going for right now? Foo Fighters is one of

[27:13] my favorite games. It's such a great game. I love the layout. And because of that game, I actually

[27:19] like the music. This is not going to be a guessing thing because I made a Foo Fighters video for a

[27:24] short time ago and I saw them with my own eyes for sale, 9,000. 9,000, right? You hit it. You hit it

[27:32] right on the nail. 9,000. That's a $4,000 hit in less than a year. New in box, Ellie, for 9,500.

[27:42] Right? Isn't it crazy too? And this guy was selling it at like 92 and then he had to go down

[27:48] to 9. It was like 24 hours special. And that's a huge hit, right? I mean, and again, the part that

[27:54] people need to just always remind themselves of, if you bought any stern throughout history, you

[28:00] never lost $4,000 on any stern ever, whether it was WrestleMania, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Aerosmith,

[28:08] you never lost this much money on a stern machine in the history of pinball. And here's the crazy

[28:12] part. $15,000 in a flash. In a flash, in a year. And Jengez, here's what the crazy part is, right?

[28:18] Is that you're not losing hardly any money on a pro. And now the stern pro is like the smartest

[28:26] financial buy. And this is insane. Like the least. I'll explain that for so long. All right, so then,

[28:34] okay, now are you ready for the next one? Godfather Collective's Edition. Jersey Jack making

[28:39] games for Jersey Jack Guinari came out in March of 2023, right? $15,000. Eric Minier's follow up to

[28:48] Guns N' Roses. What do you think? How much do you think that game has lost in value?

[28:56] I love that game. Yeah. Christopher Crunchy artwork. Yeah, for us Collective's Edition.

[29:03] And I don't even think they made all thousand. Let's be honest here. Jersey Jack did not make

[29:09] a thousand. I don't know. 11, 5, 12, maybe? 12, okay. Right now, as of January 11, there is one

[29:18] for sale in mint condition for $10,500. So hold a little bit stronger than Toy Story 4. You're at

[29:26] just a $4,500 loss on that game. Is it sold or listed? It's not sold. It's just listed for sale.

[29:34] And what's interesting, and this is why. Okay, let's just use this as an example.

[29:39] So let's say you're flipping out or Pinball Star or CoinTaker, Mad Pinball. Let's just name

[29:44] as many districts. Okay, how many of them right now have a new inbox Toy Story, sorry,

[29:51] Godfather Collective's Edition, right? And you see the listings that they have on Pinside,

[29:55] and it's like $15,000 firm, right? You can mess with MSRP with Jersey Jack.

[30:04] So like if you're a distro, all you can list this game for a new inbox firm is $15,000. Who's

[30:10] gonna buy it? It's $4,500 more money for the cardboard box. Who's buying that game? Nobody.

[30:18] Nobody. So you know what's gonna have to happen next is, and we know what happens,

[30:23] Jenga is, the backdoor deals. The backdoor deals. If I show up to Pinball Star with $11,000 in cash,

[30:30] you know what's gonna happen? You know, they're taking that cash. I don't know. I don't know if

[30:35] Joe's gonna take the cash, but someone would take the cash, and at least they made something on it.

[30:40] Like you know what I'm saying? Like something is better than nothing, because they need that

[30:44] money to buy the next game that's gonna hopefully be hotter than Godfather. All right, so that's a

[30:48] huge loss. All right, next on our list is everyone's favorite game. This one's crazy because it actually

[30:54] held more value because not many were bought. Galactic Tank Force, American Pinballs, Dark Horse

[31:01] game that's gonna bankrupt the company. You remember what the Elise sold for, Jenga's?

[31:07] 11? Yeah, you're right. Spot on. And you remember what the signature edition sold for?

[31:13] 17, I want to say. 17.5.

[31:17] I mean, is that the thermos thing? Yeah, the thermos in the lunchbox was $6,500 more. All right,

[31:22] so as of today, the lowest you can get in LE4, it's not that bad. It's $9,000. So that's just a-

[31:30] They're like 40 of them out there. There's none of them, right? There's none of them, but they're not

[31:35] taking as much because the MSRP didn't start as much. Now, you can get a signature edition

[31:41] new in box right now for 14. So that's a $3,500 loss if you bought it for 17.5.

[31:48] You know, what's interesting about Tank Force, to your point, right? They didn't make many. So

[31:52] there's not a lot of sample size here to know what the real market value is. We can tell by

[31:57] the lack of initial purchase that people don't really want the game, right? So then it's like,

[32:02] I don't know, right? It's like, would you even want to spend $9,000 on one? I wouldn't.

[32:08] I mean, we ordered it day one and we got a confirmation. Yeah, you ordered the

[32:14] collective Tank Force and since then, we got nothing. No mail, nothing. Send us rest of the

[32:21] money, nothing. So we're just waiting here in Europe. All right. And the final one, right, is VenomLE,

[32:28] right? This game came out and this has always been the pressure test is like at these prices,

[32:32] can Stern keep these prices as high because when you have a theme like Venom, how are you going to

[32:37] command $13,000 and make a thousand of them? So how much do you think you can get a Venom for today?

[32:44] Which is pretty much a brand new game. It's a brand new game, but it's not a popular game yet.

[32:54] I want to say, full fighters for nine, then Venom must be seven. Well, Venom's newer. So Venom's held

[33:04] a little bit stronger than it is. I know. Well, the thing about Venom, I'm not even sure all thousand

[33:11] LEs are out there. I think they probably have all been made by now. The lowest I saw on pin side was

[33:16] 9,500. So that is a, it's still a big loss, right? That's a $3,500 loss. Now, let me give you some

[33:23] shocking numbers, Jengas. If you were to buy all of those games we just mentioned without

[33:31] Galactic Tank Force, let's just say you went in on all these games. I know what you're up to.

[33:36] You bought, bought, bought. If you just waited, you could march into the pinball marketplace

[33:42] today and acquire all of those games and save yourself $31,019. You would save on the same

[33:55] period of one and a half, one and a half year, one and a half at most $31,000. That's $62,000.

[34:04] You need to make before taxes, but that is the biggest financial loss that you would have taken

[34:10] on pinball in the history of pinball. Here's a scary part. If you're just a Jersey Jack

[34:14] fanboy, right? And we know who those guys are, right? The Jersey Jack Apologist. If you just,

[34:21] bought their last two CEs, you lost in total in just one year, $9,600 in just one year of value

[34:30] on their two collector's editions. And look, Elton John, is it going up in value? Is it going down?

[34:37] I mean, when you go into the owner's club, there's only like two pages. There's only two pages on

[34:41] pin side of the Elton John owner's club. Nobody owns it. People lost Elton John. Okay. And if you

[34:47] bought every Stern LE, this is also right. This is like a thing. If you bought every single Stern

[34:53] LE over the last year and a half, there's just three games, just three games, you lost $11,000

[34:59] on three Stern LEs. Now these numbers are shocking, right? They're jarring. They're like,

[35:04] they make you feel some agita and some anxiety in which we never used to feel this. People

[35:10] made money on Led Zeppelin. They're telling something I have been thinking about. So they're

[35:15] hating me like this. I'm like, well, when you hit these numbers, it's like, right, it feels very

[35:21] unrealistic to me. It's not. And the numbers aren't lying. I think what this is indicating,

[35:26] and here's the thing. As you look at this data, the variables at play, I think, I also would argue

[35:33] that the themes haven't been great, right? If Jersey Jack made back to the future or Matrix,

[35:40] that game's not going down from 15. It's going up, right? And I think we had a year and a half of

[35:45] mediocre themes for the most part. I think they overmade every single limited version of the game,

[35:52] right? Thousands too many when you want to charge 13 or 15K. So I think there was just like an

[35:58] increase in price, an increase in volume. COVID is over. Yeah, and mediocre themes. And so then

[36:04] you get to this point. Now, here's the problem. There's a lot of machines and a lot of money

[36:09] evaporating from the pinball community. And people need to move their old games out to get

[36:15] the new games in. And now we're going to start to see a little bit of a stalling of the pinball

[36:20] market. And now that people are going to hear this show, you think they're going to run and go by the

[36:26] next LE. Now let's talk about Jaws, though, right? Jaws LE is going to sell out, right? There's no

[36:31] there's no if and or buts about it. But will the game go up in value? Will it hold value for very

[36:39] long? Or if a game as popular as Jaws sinks to like 10, 5 and 6 months, I don't know how long

[36:47] the community can absorb these losses, Jeng is before people are just going to say, well, well,

[36:53] I'm just going to wait. If you look at those numbers, I don't think any key field when games

[37:00] has lost that much. No, nothing has lost anything. The only the only I don't think a Keith Elwin

[37:07] game has ever lost money. I would say Avengers LE has held its value. It's it's Europe. Avengers

[37:13] LE is almost unseleval. Right. Nobody wants it. Right. Well, you know, for the most part, though,

[37:21] every other Elwin game, you know, Godzilla's held really nicely a great return for its buyers. And

[37:27] again, that's my point of this show. And I wanted to, you know, always add this caveat as we have

[37:32] this conversation is that by by by worked out really well for everybody for many, many years.

[37:38] We all made a lot of money. Right. We all made a lot of money. Like, if you bought those LEs,

[37:44] you were sitting on a gravy train and COVID made everything go crazy. But then we started to see,

[37:51] you know, just like that ceiling just kept creeping up. Like, am I really going to drop 10

[37:56] grand on every premium and 13 for a stern le without a topper in which if you add a topper to

[38:03] a stern machine, you're at 14 or $15,000 for a stern for and we know we know, right, Jegas,

[38:12] you've put you've put a stern next to a Jersey Jack. Like, we know which one should be worth

[38:18] 30% more, which one should charge more money. Like, we know, like, we're not our eyes still work,

[38:25] our hands still feel radcals. Like, we know who's putting in more effort. I mean, yeah,

[38:32] but you still if everybody waits and buy, no one will buy new and box games. No, no, the prices

[38:39] will just have to come down. And look, Ford Motor Company just lowered their prices. Tesla

[38:44] lowered their prices. Yeah, if everyone waits, it's they're not going to stop making machines,

[38:49] distributors are not going to evaporate, you know, overnight, it's just going to force somebody

[38:54] to lower the prices. You can't charge 13 for every what if the next L.E. is Dungeons and Dragons,

[39:01] Jengas, who's buying that? I mean, it's not Keith Elwin. And it's not a popular thing.

[39:09] You just can't ask, like, it just went too high too fast to it was gradual for a while. The

[39:16] silliest move was Jersey Jack, like they literally like overnight, just priced themselves out of the

[39:21] market completely. Absolutely completely. And they saw what was happening with the Guns and

[39:27] Roses demand, right? It was because of guns and roses. Okay, let's look at that game, right?

[39:31] 12, 5 brand new. Guess what you can get one for right now? 12, 5. It's absolutely all the

[39:38] the C. I don't know what the L.E.s are selling for 6000, bro. 6000. Seriously? Like, and now that

[39:47] you can get an L.E. of G&R for six grand and you change out that I.O. board for 400 bucks and it

[39:52] makes the game feel great and precision flippers. Yeah, it looks like okay. Okay. So you literally

[39:59] would you rather lose 5000? Yeah, are you going to lose $5000 on a Toy Story CE or just go get a

[40:07] G&R L.E. for six grand, throw in a little board and some flip and you got that game still awesome.

[40:15] It's awesome. People don't get it. Well, you know, flippers is an awesome game. It's a party, man.

[40:21] Jersey Jack has it. It's weird to me too about JJP right now is why aren't they celebrating this

[40:26] I.O. board fix more like everyone who's using it is saying the games now feel so much better.

[40:34] You'd think they'd be screaming about this upgrade from the rooftops that you can now make your game

[40:40] much more enjoyable. I'm not familiar with it. But what does the I.O. board that

[40:45] you did? But what does it do? It's got larger capacitors, which actually makes it so the flippers

[40:51] are stronger. They're not losing power. They're snappier. The reaction time, everything about

[40:56] it's better. Like this is like how much does it cost $400? Is it in their new games? It's in

[41:03] it's it's basically going to simulate what you know, the board is in Elton John. And people

[41:09] have been putting them in older JJP games to great success. And it's on pinball life and it's

[41:15] 400 bucks a pop. I get that's a lot of money. It's not a board from JJP. You buy it from other

[41:21] well, pinball life is selling it. But I'm assuming JJP like, you know, commission the production of

[41:28] them. I get why they don't want to celebrate it because, you know, it's like, Oh, you bought

[41:33] a game for this much money. Now you have to spend another $400 to make it feel right when you flip.

[41:39] But whatever, you know, I'm going to put one in. I think people have been having great success

[41:43] with it. So this is where I'm at, right? It's like, if you bought all these games, and you lost all

[41:48] this money, you're pretty much crying, not celebrating how much you bought. And look,

[41:54] Jeng is at the end of the day, I think prices need to come down. The market will do what the

[41:58] market does. I also think that we all could benefit from a little bit more patience. And I think

[42:05] patience, not just in pinball in life, will help us make better decisions. And yes, I get it.

[42:11] Distros don't want you to be patient, right? They want you to like, Oh, the game is really

[42:14] chill. The FOMO. Yeah, well, FOMO, the, see, I, I firmly believe that Jersey,

[42:21] Jack and Stern collectively have killed their own golden goose. And everyone's feeling that. And,

[42:29] you know, Jaws is not going to, again, I don't think it's going to be this game that like,

[42:33] it's a little bit of an anomaly because it's Elwyn. It's not Jaws. It's the game after Jaws

[42:39] that Stern needs to sell. And imagine if you're a distro, Jeng is right, you got to buy

[42:45] every single bulk order to keep your allotment from Stern, right? We all know the dirty little

[42:50] secret they pull. They're like the mafia. If you want your 10LEs, you got to agree to buy this

[42:56] many premiums and this many pros of that theme. We all know that's how they do it. And so that's

[43:02] why all those guys that are sitting on Venom, premiums and pros, unsold, even at least unsold,

[43:08] every game unsold is eating away your Jaws profits. It's how's it working out for you? It's not,

[43:13] it's not really how you want to be doing business. And this is Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[43:17] would have been number seven for seven, baby, ain't no Twippies now. But this is how we think about

[43:23] pinball. And it, look, look, I'm all for, I'm all for manufacturers and distributors and content

[43:28] creators. But like we need to look at the numbers here and people are getting, they're getting

[43:32] hosed at these high prices. Everyone's losing out where it used to be like, you know, the slow to

[43:40] the party people used to lose because, you know, they had to buy a scalped machine, right? They had

[43:44] to pay extra. Now, everyone's paying the scalper prices, even if the game's not worth scalper

[43:51] prices. So the moral on this video is pros are not for hoes. Pros are for smart people. Because

[43:59] one thing Stern won't do is jack off those prices. They take them up with a hundred bucks each time

[44:07] or something like that. And they're sort of smart keeping those pro prices down. And Ellie, Ellie

[44:14] now stands for the loser edition, because you're losing the most money out of everybody. And that's

[44:20] just right now. It's not the old Ellie's. It's the current $13,000 $15,000 Jersey Jack. If you buy

[44:28] in at those prices. And here's the thing, if you love the theme, Jeng is, and you never want to sell

[44:34] the game, then you don't care about any of this. All this is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if you

[44:39] love Elton John, by the way, on that, you still, you still know this one has this value. I know,

[44:47] it's painful. It's still painful. Because you because even if you loved it, you would have

[44:51] loved to have got it for more for less money. Of course, it's about the value people are saying,

[44:56] I'm never going to sell. I don't care. It's still about the value. So it is a very thin line. And

[45:04] I don't know if I should upload this video, Chris, this video is crazy. No, you're uploading this

[45:09] video. This is this is my podcast today. You're uploading it. And the other two other honorable

[45:14] mentions for you, Ultraman Collector's Edition. That game was $9,000. You got a host on that.

[45:23] Yes. Yeah, I lost. You can get it now for 4,400 bucks. At the worst ever, though, if you bought

[45:30] Elvira 40th, remember when people bought 25,000 was the that's what people were paying at the peak.

[45:38] Right. The people from day 25, there were some people that bought them for 25. Yes,

[45:43] I have documented examples of it. Okay. So now you can go get one for 13, two. There's one for

[45:51] sale for 13, two perfect condition. That's a loss of 11,750 dollars. And I would still go ahead and

[45:58] get like this. Yeah. Yeah. Brand new zero plays. I mean, darn it. But Chris, this is not pinball

[46:06] only look at the house prices it dropped. I just watched the news in China, the biggest house building

[46:14] thing is going down and the world economy is going down. You're right. I mean, this is

[46:21] something happened during COVID that made everybody act stupid and companies got stupid with their

[46:28] pricing. We didn't really see a recession. So people were just at home and they were bored,

[46:33] right? And we saw especially in our hobby, people started to be like, I'm not going to be going out

[46:38] as much. There's a pandemic, you know, we're going to turn my basement into an arcade and we're going

[46:42] to invest in these things. And now what's happening, right? I just went to Disney, man. One thing

[46:48] you're missing at the COVID times. The issue was also people called us, I want this game, okay,

[46:54] contacted the manufacturers, we can't produce them, we have nothing to produce with. So we did

[47:00] didn't have the part so we couldn't get the games. Yeah, yeah, there was no, yeah, there was no

[47:04] inventory. There was nothing being made. Same thing with the housing market, no new houses were

[47:09] being built. The material costs were through the roof. And we just thought like the supply would

[47:14] never turn on again. And that's what's happened though, is the supply is caught up to the demand

[47:20] and then some and in a world in which that happens in which now everyone realizes you never really

[47:25] needed 1000 Foo Fighter LEs or Venom LEs. They just made that many because yeah, you could have

[47:33] sold 1000 when the COVID demand was there, but it's gone. But they made those games, designed those

[47:40] games, thought about those games during COVID times. But the pricing, but the pricing and the volume,

[47:47] and this is why marketing is so important, like marketing needs to be able to adjust to the market

[47:53] realities. And I think the pinball companies are stubbornly unwilling, if you will, to ever lower

[48:01] prices. Wait, wait, 30 minutes from me is Sweden. And we have manufacturers here in Sweden called

[48:10] my boys pinball brothers. They took prices down on the yeah, I don't know how they did that.

[48:17] Well, I don't they they're alien is like $7,800 or something crazy, right? And then it's more money

[48:24] in euros. It's like 9000 euros. How is it more money to buy a European game from a European

[48:30] company than it is to buy it in the United States where it has to be shipped over here?

[48:38] They like just to put a pin on this, this we all know deep down, Jeng is deep down,

[48:43] Stern's bill of materials has not really increased much. All they've done is jack the price up.

[48:50] If you pop the hood on any of their new machines, like it's just it's like crazy. Because think

[48:56] about like this, if they're making a good cut on the pro, you know, and the pro is what?

[49:03] $6,500. And Ellie is twice the price of a pro twice. How is that even like when when those older

[49:12] Ellie's I was mentioning, remember when the pro used to be like 5000 and the Ellie was 7500, like

[49:18] it was 20, it was $2,500 more, not $6,500 more. And they're not putting like $4,000 more into the

[49:27] Ellie. So I think I think that's where there's a lot of strain to now. It's like when I played

[49:32] Jaws and I enjoyed it, but I just cannot get over the fact that the Ellie is twice as much money

[49:38] as the pro. Same software, same, you know, same coding, same lights, same basic play field. I mean,

[49:47] so would you have for the same money, Jaws Ellie or Jaws pro and Godzilla pro?

[49:55] But with the two, I mean, I think the person who's got those two pros is having more fun.

[50:00] Oh, yeah. I believe that I, I wouldn't want any of those I would want to get a Jaws Ellie

[50:08] when it sinks down to 9500 because it's gonna, it's gonna like, and that's my whole

[50:15] It's fine. But you know what the problem is is like, there's just too many games in the marketplace

[50:20] now though. And like everything is so oversaturated. And like having played Jaws, it's not as good as

[50:25] Godzilla, you know, and Godzilla's have held value nicely. I don't know. I don't know. We're

[50:31] going to see what happens. The market will do what the market does. But I have you have you

[50:36] take the price of four, five, six years old games. They are there for sale everywhere.

[50:43] Everywhere. And the prices are like, and that's the challenge in pinball, unlike, unlike, unlike

[50:50] other industries, right? Like televisions where there's actual innovation that makes the newer

[50:55] TVs better. I would argue that pinball doesn't really have much innovation. You know, a game from

[51:01] five years ago is going to kind of play exactly the same as a game today, right? Especially a

[51:08] stern. Iron Maiden comparing to stern. Stern doesn't innovate anything. Like they don't really

[51:14] innovate their games, their light shows are they're so archaic. You know, the, the, what was that

[51:19] lighting thing they put into some of their games? Like that's that system sucks next to like what

[51:23] Jersey Jack's lighting looks like. The side on the cabinet. Yeah, like this guard looks like

[51:28] Skittles. Like it's not, it's they don't really, I mean, the most innovation stern's done and it's

[51:32] worked well for them is inside or connected. And that has been their major contribution

[51:37] technologically to the industry. The last like five years, you know, whether or not they're

[51:42] going to start using that to get downloadable content dollars from everybody. I think that's

[51:46] the next move. But again, why not? There's, but there's, but, but I just think there's only so

[51:51] much people are willing to invest in a single pinball experience before people say no more.

[51:58] How about more room? You're talking about the television. When your TV is two, three years old,

[52:03] you just throw it out. Yeah. But you don't do that with the people machine. You want to

[52:07] spend it. I can get a great, great, great, great, great brand new TV for 1500 bucks. That's the

[52:13] problem here is when, when you're losing, let me just pull up a number here on Toy Story alone,

[52:19] $5,100. I mean, that's a, that's a trip to Disney world for a family. You know, it's no longer

[52:26] 500 bucks or a grand. It's, it's a significant amount of money that you could have saved.

[52:32] And I think Chris, yeah.

[52:36] This is about an hour long. So I want to say thank you for hitting me up. Thank you for doing this.

[52:43] I'm a bit concerned about uploading this, but I'm going to do it. I promise you to do it. Thank

[52:48] you. Give me the audio on your picture. Yeah. Give me the, give me the audio because this is

[52:53] going to be my podcast today. Okay. Okay. All right, buddy. Thank you for everything. And I'll

[52:59] see you on the next video. Okay. All right. Thanks, Janice. Bye. Bye.
