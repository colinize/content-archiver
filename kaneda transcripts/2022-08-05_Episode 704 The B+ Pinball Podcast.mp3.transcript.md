[00:00] I saw my reach down to NaxxGar, got the right body and the right mind,

[00:04] Rollin' up the party got the right vibes, we like, hate it.

[00:08] Fresh boy, pull up and we lay low, all the plans dead, movin' with the base low,

[00:12] Got the army right behind us when we say show.

[00:14] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:18] Aw, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada, the only Gucci wearing

[00:24] pinball podcaster that if he gave his own show a review, he would give his show a B-plus

[00:30] every single time.

[00:31] We're gonna talk about the pinball reviews that are going around around Toy Story and

[00:36] it's funny, it's funny watching these dealers and these distributors who know they're gonna

[00:40] be left holding the bag if the demand for this game starts to fall off really quickly

[00:45] and it is falling off really quickly, we're gonna talk about that, we're gonna talk about

[00:50] everyone's response to Billy Joel.

[00:52] I thought people would be more excited that Steve Richie's rumored game is going to be

[00:57] Billy Joel Pinball, but it was brutal.

[01:00] I think if Jersey Jack is reading that thread, they are realizing that maybe we made a mistake.

[01:05] Now no one knows for sure if it's Billy Joel, but the rumors over at Jersey Jack, we're

[01:09] gonna talk about those, we're gonna talk about Stern and their insider connected, we're

[01:14] gonna talk about Jack Guinari, did an interview, I wanna talk about something he said on that

[01:19] interview and overall, it's August.

[01:22] And I think everyone out there feels the same thing that I'm feeling right now.

[01:26] You're a little fatigued, you're a little burnt out, you probably need a vacation.

[01:31] If there's one thing I have not had in a very long time, it is a vacation.

[01:37] It's really hard when you have a new son to travel, to turn everything off because there

[01:42] is no vacation away from the work of being a parent.

[01:45] So that is why if you have seen on my Facebook page over the last week, I turned it off yesterday.

[01:51] I just didn't wanna keep doing Facebook and the show.

[01:55] It was just such a time crunch and I just wanna relax a little bit.

[01:59] I almost, I'm gonna be completely honest with everybody here.

[02:02] I almost don't wanna think about pinball as much as I normally think about pinball.

[02:07] Now, am I turning off my Facebook live forever?

[02:10] No.

[02:11] Am I stopping my Saturday morning spectaculars forever?

[02:14] No.

[02:15] I am turning it off.

[02:16] I'm gonna start with a 30 day break.

[02:18] I just want 30 days, no Facebook, no messages, no people complaining about this and what

[02:24] I said over here.

[02:26] It's almost like you reach a point at times where you're just so tired of all the noise

[02:30] and maybe I just wanna simplify it a little bit.

[02:32] And I know that I'm creating more noise for you right now, but I know you appreciate this

[02:36] noise.

[02:37] That's why you pay a little bit of money every month for it, but this show is gonna keep

[02:40] going on.

[02:41] All right, so where do I wanna start on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast?

[02:45] Let's talk about Billy Joel.

[02:46] I think Billy Joel is probably a very good chance.

[02:49] It's a real rumor.

[02:50] I do.

[02:51] I think Jack Winari is a guy from New Jersey who grew up loving Billy Joel.

[02:56] He clearly grew up loving, you know, Godfather.

[03:00] He's an Italian.

[03:01] Jack Winari, you know, he's in the Northeast.

[03:03] You know, I'm Sicilian.

[03:04] I'm Greek.

[03:05] I understand like a lot of people really, really love Billy Joel in this part of the

[03:10] country.

[03:11] A guy has like a residency at Madison Square Garden and he sold 150 million albums.

[03:17] And it's funny to me that people say, well, that's a stupid theme for pinball.

[03:21] A guy that has sold 150 million albums, if all he has to do is sell like 3,000 pinball

[03:28] machines, it will be a commercial success, especially at these prices.

[03:33] And everyone is like, no, enough of this.

[03:36] And I have to say, I agree with you.

[03:38] I don't think we need a Billy Joel pinball machine.

[03:40] I don't think Billy Joel has the library that would make for a great pinball machine.

[03:45] I could pick five better artists right now that I think we would rather have than Billy

[03:52] Joel.

[03:53] Can I start right now?

[03:54] All right, let's start with the Beastie Boys.

[03:56] Let's start with the red hot chili peppers.

[04:00] Let's go to Nirvana.

[04:02] How about some Green Day?

[04:04] How about some Tupac, some Eminem, some Biggie Smalls, some Puff Daddy?

[04:09] How about any great hip hop artist in pinball form?

[04:13] Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, right?

[04:15] Are we going to leave out that there are musical genres that are not just Dad Rock?

[04:20] How about Madonna?

[04:21] I know that Jack posed against the Jersey Jack logo outside of the factory wearing a white

[04:27] glove.

[04:28] And people were saying, is that him teasing Michael Jackson?

[04:31] Now this is a true story.

[04:32] I said it on my Facebook.

[04:34] This is a true story that Jack Winari was very close to inking a deal for Michael Jackson

[04:39] Pinball.

[04:40] And then the Michael Jackson documentary came out on HBO and it spooked him.

[04:45] And I actually think it was a good idea probably not to announce a Michael Jackson pinball machine

[04:50] during the period of time in which that documentary launched.

[04:54] Now that Michael Jackson is long gone, I still think his music is part of culture.

[04:59] I still think he is the number one pop artist of all time.

[05:02] And absolutely Michael Jackson's music would sell so well in a pinball machine.

[05:08] And I think a lot of people would buy it.

[05:10] I really do.

[05:11] I don't think you'd have a problem selling a Michael Jackson pinball machine.

[05:13] But here's the bigger issue.

[05:15] And I see this with Stern and I see it with Jersey Jack Pinball is that the decision makers

[05:19] when it comes to licensing and the decision makers when it comes to music especially,

[05:25] this is a very narrow lane that this industry has gone down.

[05:30] It has mostly been music that is all rock and roll.

[05:35] Pinball does a very bad job at representing the variety of music out in the world that

[05:41] people love.

[05:42] The pinball demographic, I get it.

[05:44] This is where you kind of have to be a little bit careful on how you speak.

[05:48] This demographic on the surface isn't that diverse.

[05:53] But I want to argue against that.

[05:55] Even though on the surface, pinball is primarily men, it's primarily Caucasian.

[06:02] But when it comes to our musical tastes, we are way more diverse than what we look like

[06:07] on the surface.

[06:09] And look what happened with Rush.

[06:11] Some people like Rush, some people don't.

[06:13] Some people like Guns N' Roses, some people don't.

[06:15] But I would argue that pinball's problem with music, it's a very myopic approach.

[06:21] It's always just these rock bands from the 70s and 80s.

[06:25] We haven't really gotten anything from the 90s.

[06:28] Everything we get in pinball is really artists that go 60s, 70s and 80s.

[06:34] But when are we going to see more representation from the pop industry?

[06:38] When are we going to see pop music?

[06:40] When are we going to see hip hop music?

[06:42] How many of you out there don't like pop music or don't like rap music?

[06:46] I bet you do.

[06:48] And I would love to have like a Lincoln Park pinball machine.

[06:51] Look, I'm just going to say it.

[06:53] I would love it if every once in a while we would bring out an artist like Madonna or

[06:57] Justin Bieber or Taylor Swift.

[07:00] If you think Taylor Swift pinball would not sell, you're crazy people.

[07:05] You are absolutely crazy.

[07:07] But you're never going to know unless you do it.

[07:09] And that's the thing is like the people that are controlling these decisions, I do think

[07:13] they're older men and they're simply making games for themselves.

[07:18] We even heard from the new president of Stern Pinball, Seth Davis, that that company wants

[07:22] to start exploring more music from the 90s.

[07:25] And it's like Wake Up Stern.

[07:26] It's 2022.

[07:28] The 90s were 20 years ago.

[07:31] And it's just sort of comical to me that these pinball companies, you know, they need to sort

[07:36] of give us more and more that's recent and more that's relevant.

[07:40] You know, and I think that's why there's so much anger against Billy Joel.

[07:43] It's like we've got enough, right?

[07:45] I think that's the overwhelming feeling.

[07:47] We've got enough music from these decades.

[07:51] Give us something else.

[07:54] And I will say too, when I was playing the Billy Joel song, I had a bunch of people respond

[07:58] and are like, who is that?

[08:00] And yeah, there are people out there in their like 30s who don't even know any of these

[08:06] Billy Joel songs.

[08:08] And so I think it would behoove all of these companies to go into some other genres of music.

[08:13] I mean, I'm just going to say it like a Kanye West pinball machine would be awesome.

[08:18] All right.

[08:19] So that's it.

[08:19] Like Billy Joel looks like a stinker.

[08:21] Now the question becomes is this, is Jersey Jack pinball going to be in trouble?

[08:26] If they go from Toy Story 4, which the demand is already dissipated, are they going to go

[08:31] from that to Godfather, which basically hardly anybody wants?

[08:36] How are you going to turn this slow movie drama into a pinball machine?

[08:41] So if they go from Toy Story, which is a whiff to Godfather, which could be a whiff to Billy

[08:47] Joel.

[08:48] Like this could be like three strikes in a row.

[08:51] And for a company like JJP, that's a boutique.

[08:54] I don't think they can have two misses in a row.

[08:56] But man, I don't know, man, I'm getting worried.

[08:59] Like Jersey Jack used to be like the chosen one, right?

[09:01] I felt like Obi-Wan.

[09:03] Like you were the chosen one Jersey Jack pinball.

[09:05] You were supposed to bring balance to the pinball world.

[09:08] You were supposed to load the games with all the toys.

[09:11] You were the company that was supposed to put the magic back into pinball.

[09:15] And now it's starting to feel like that's gone.

[09:17] I feel like nobody now is going to anticipate the next JJP launch the same way we did when

[09:23] we saw Guns N' Roses.

[09:24] They're going to have to earn our excitement back.

[09:27] And I really hope they're getting in a room together and figuring out how do they do that?

[09:32] Now, look, Jack Winari went on an interview with the pinball news show and it was like,

[09:36] I don't know, and those shows like two hours long, but I want to just highlight

[09:39] something he said.

[09:40] Jack said they could have made more collectors editions of Toy Story 4.

[09:44] He said people are calling them up trying to get one and they're already sold out.

[09:49] So let me ask Jack Winari a question.

[09:51] Let me ask all the other pinball content creators out there a question who are

[09:55] saying this game is worth the money.

[09:57] Let me ask all of you one thing.

[09:59] If this game is worth the money, if this game has the value there, if this game is

[10:06] worth $15,000, then why do I not have a single offer to buy mine for 14

[10:14] thousand dollars?

[10:16] Why is that if it's such an in-demand product?

[10:19] The truth is the demand is gone and they all know it.

[10:23] And we're reaching a point right now where it's getting kind of scary because

[10:27] distributors and dealers have never been left holding the bag too badly on a Jersey

[10:32] Jack product.

[10:33] But this is going to be the game where they are left holding the bag on it.

[10:38] And look, the market is showing us that the demand is gone.

[10:42] Like, have you ever seen a Stern LE with a thousand dollars off sticker not sell

[10:48] right away?

[10:49] Name me one game where one thousand off the price and still no offers.

[10:54] So who's lying to us then?

[10:56] Who's misleading us?

[10:58] Who's shilling right now?

[10:59] Is it Canada?

[11:00] Am I shilling like the animosity about this game?

[11:03] Or are these dealers and distributors who are sitting on inventory who are telling

[11:08] us that they wish they could get more CEs because they have buyers?

[11:12] Someone's not being honest.

[11:14] Now, because my game is sat now for two weeks at 14 K without a single offer,

[11:20] I am here to tell you, I think the market on the collector's edition is completely

[11:24] dried up already.

[11:25] I think the demand for the collector's editions is gone already.

[11:28] And I can't imagine they're going to make one thousand of them.

[11:32] If they make one thousand of these games at 15 K a pop, they're going to sit at

[11:37] distributors forever.

[11:39] Everybody knows this.

[11:40] Like Willy Wonka's sat for a year at 12 five and they only made five hundred of

[11:46] them. And Willy Wonka is arguably a better game.

[11:50] It's got more in it.

[11:52] It's more challenging for most of you.

[11:53] You're not going to see the end of the game in like a month.

[11:56] I just don't know what to say.

[11:58] Like, you know, and this is part of the thing that's been burning me out is this

[12:01] whole Toy Story 4 game.

[12:02] It's just completely burnt me out.

[12:05] It's completely burnt me out.

[12:06] You know, I try to step away from it, but every day I have conversations with

[12:10] friends who are in on this game and can't get their money back.

[12:14] And it's really deflating when you think about that.

[12:17] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[12:18] I think for the first time ever, we're going to have to see dealers and

[12:22] distributors offer a discount on these games because the moment these used

[12:27] at least start selling for like ten thousand dollars and it's going to happen.

[12:31] The moment they start selling used at least for ten thousand dollars, there's

[12:35] no way people are going to open up their wallet and spend fifteen thousand dollars.

[12:39] Now, Jersey Jack Pinball must be in a rush to get the CEs on the line.

[12:43] Now, I heard they're making the CEs the end of this month and that's a good thing.

[12:47] They need to get these CEs out.

[12:49] They need to get people opening the boxes and just getting all googly eyed

[12:53] because of the shiny armor and the topper.

[12:55] But that's it.

[12:55] That's all you're getting.

[12:56] You're not getting a different game.

[12:58] You might be getting a couple more call outs, but you're getting the same exact

[13:01] game as everyone who's going to be buying an Ellie for thousands off sticker.

[13:06] I'm just saying it like I just don't think anyone out there, unless you're

[13:08] like the biggest toy story for fanatic.

[13:11] Why do you want to own a collector's edition of something which is not going

[13:15] to be collectible?

[13:16] It's not going to be sought after and you know it's not the movie you want.

[13:19] And this is the narrative I keep saying because I love toy story.

[13:22] I love toy story so much and it still upsets me.

[13:25] OK, moving on.

[13:26] So here's the silver lining in all of this.

[13:28] Now the door is wide open for someone to come out with the game this fall winter

[13:36] to really win best game of the year.

[13:38] I was thinking about it.

[13:39] Like who wins the Twippy for best game of the year?

[13:41] Like it's not going to be toy story.

[13:43] It's going to be wide open.

[13:45] I don't think it's going to be rush.

[13:46] So here's what it's going to come down to.

[13:49] I think it's going to come down to the game of the year.

[13:51] We'll come down to Venom, possibly James Bond, if it comes out in time.

[13:56] And then American Pinball is going to have a golden opportunity to launch their

[14:01] game with a more receptive audience because I think again, I think a lot of the

[14:06] JJP fans are feeling underwhelmed.

[14:09] Venom is going to be the big one, people.

[14:11] I'm really excited to see what Venom turns out to be because we know that this

[14:17] game is going to be the best looking game.

[14:19] Like it's already going to win best art package of 2022.

[14:23] It is like Zombie Eddie.

[14:24] Look at his work on Deadpool.

[14:26] Venom is going to look absolutely amazing.

[14:29] The big question mark with Venom is this.

[14:31] Ken Bryant, Eddie put some mechanical, magical, cool stuff into this game because

[14:36] he didn't do it with Mandalorian.

[14:39] He kind of did it with Stranger Things, but I think the extra time he's had to

[14:43] make Venom has given all of Stern extra time to make the games even more special.

[14:49] So I do think Venom is going to be a game where if it does have a killer mech,

[14:54] like this is the thing.

[14:55] If Venom has a killer mech and is super fun and it shoots great and it looks sexy

[15:00] and it's much, much cheaper than Toy Story, it's going to be a big, big problem.

[15:06] This could be the game that just absolutely destroys the demand for Toy Story.

[15:10] Now, what do we think about American Pinball?

[15:12] Does American Pinball have a chance, right?

[15:15] Now, I think American Pinball and David Fix, it's like this would have been a

[15:19] golden opportunity to get this game out now.

[15:23] It's like, I think American Pinball is going to wait until after Venom is revealed

[15:29] or they're going to reveal their game right at the exact time Venom comes out.

[15:33] Here's where the fun battleground is going to be.

[15:36] We are going to have a zombie, yeti Venom versus a Christopher

[15:41] Franci original IP game by Dennis Nordman.

[15:45] I mean, think about that to me.

[15:47] That's the great battle we're going to see in the pinball fall of 2022.

[15:52] Yeti versus Franci, two new games coming out at exactly the same time.

[15:57] Will David Fix finally be able to cash the checks his mouth has been writing?

[16:02] I don't know.

[16:03] Will it be Galactic Tank Force or Space Force versus Venom?

[16:08] Now, I will say this, knowing that Stern's got the licensed IP, knowing that

[16:13] they've got Venom gives them a huge up in terms of where the excitement

[16:18] and fan base will be.

[16:19] But I think we're going to see this battle happen between September and November.

[16:25] So this two month window, those are going to be the two games everybody is talking about.

[16:29] The game everyone's not going to be talking about is Cactus Canyon LE.

[16:34] Where the hell are these games?

[16:36] It's about to get really embarrassing.

[16:38] It's about to be one year since they unveiled this game at Pinball Expo

[16:44] and people still do not have their games.

[16:47] I heard now they might be shipping the games without the toppers.

[16:51] Oh, that's a great marketing move.

[16:52] Let's make you wait a year and then send you the game incomplete.

[16:56] What is going on?

[16:58] Why did they even reveal this game?

[17:00] I think Chicago Gaming Company, to me, out of all the companies out there,

[17:03] has really been the most frustrating because they take forever to remake something.

[17:09] Think about that.

[17:10] Their entire company is just remaking something that was already made.

[17:13] Like nobody had to design the layout.

[17:15] Nobody had to design the toys.

[17:17] Like everything was already done years ago and it takes them forever to remake something.

[17:23] And I get there's some reverse engineering that goes into it all.

[17:26] But man, get it done before you announce it.

[17:28] Get it done before you reveal it.

[17:30] Get it done before you take people's money.

[17:33] Another sad example of taking people's money and then not having the game ready for a year.

[17:38] And that's been the story with like Haggis and P3 Multimorphic.

[17:41] It's like everyone's still waiting.

[17:43] Everyone is still waiting.

[17:44] I saw that Damien is now offering people fluorescent plastic protectors on their games

[17:50] with a note saying thank you for being patient.

[17:52] Okay, so your money gets locked up.

[17:54] They blow by the release date for a year and you get some free plastic protectors.

[17:59] You can tell why Canada gets burnt out, right?

[18:02] It is deflating trying to cover this hobby right now

[18:06] when we don't have a new game that people are excited about.

[18:09] I was just blown away because we normally are excited by New Jersey Jack games.

[18:14] That didn't happen.

[18:15] Stern Pinball is taking forever.

[18:17] Like we've been waiting since Rush, right?

[18:19] Doesn't Rush feel like five years ago it came out?

[18:22] Rush Pinball and then nothing for six months.

[18:25] This hobby, if it wasn't for Stern, I mean, it would get real boring real fast.

[18:30] Okay, let's talk about Stern Insider Connected.

[18:32] Stern added a home addition to their Insider Connected.

[18:35] So if you have Insider Connected, you can update it and it's a smart update.

[18:39] It knows that that's your machine in your home.

[18:42] So you don't have to scan yourself into your own machine.

[18:46] What a genius thing.

[18:48] I can't believe it wasn't always that way.

[18:50] Think about that.

[18:51] Well, now this machine knows it's in your home.

[18:53] But it's been here for a year.

[18:55] Yeah, but now we know.

[18:56] But I haven't had a ton of time on Insider Connected.

[18:59] It seems like a great idea.

[19:01] They're also working on an app which I think is smart

[19:04] because it's still kind of archaic that you're scanning QR codes

[19:07] and then logging into a website.

[19:09] Stern should make it an app and make it much more user friendly that way.

[19:13] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[19:15] If you haven't seen, I uploaded the nonrefundable merchandise

[19:19] to Canadian Pinball Podcast merchandise site.

[19:21] If you haven't been there, check it out, canadepinballmerch.com.

[19:25] Everybody, have a great Friday.

[19:28] I'm going to do my best to unwind.

[19:30] I know for some of you out there, you're looking out for me.

[19:33] I want to say thank you for the people who have reached out and said,

[19:35] hey, take care of your family.

[19:37] We get it.

[19:38] We really enjoy the show.

[19:39] I'm still going to do this show every week for you guys.

[19:42] I'm going to bring the energy.

[19:44] It has been a little bit deflating this summer in the world of pinball.

[19:47] The most fun I've had is just going to Jack Bar

[19:50] and enjoying pinball and drinking frozen margaritas.

[19:54] Like that has been the best pinball moment of my summer.

[19:59] I want to thank you guys for all of your support each month.

[20:01] It means a lot to me.

[20:03] I love doing this show for you every single week.

[20:05] We will be back with more episodes of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[20:08] I'm trying to get Todd Tucky on the show

[20:10] because I want him to talk to us candidly.

[20:13] I know Todd will about the reality of Toy Story sales

[20:17] because it's really hard to get distributors to be completely honest

[20:20] about what's going on with this game.

[20:21] One last final news item.

[20:23] Queen Pinball will be at the CoinTaker tailgating party

[20:27] with Super Awesome Pinball Show

[20:29] or the Super Awesome Pinball Show tailgating party, I should say.

[20:32] September 24th.

[20:33] The game will be there and it will be playable.

[20:36] I'm trying to see if my schedule will let me go there.

[20:39] My birthday is the day after.

[20:41] My birthday is September 25th.

[20:43] I need to see if Brenda has something nice planned for me

[20:46] because it's hard to go to the wife and say,

[20:48] hey, all those things you're doing for my birthday,

[20:51] I'd rather go sit in a parking lot and play pinball.

[20:53] I love the tailgating party.

[20:55] It was sad that they postponed it,

[20:56] but hopefully we can all get together this year

[20:58] because that's when pinball is the most fun.

[21:00] We're just together drinking beers, playing pinball

[21:03] and not spending $15,000 on collector's editions.

[21:07] Later, everybody.
