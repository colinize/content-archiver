[00:00] What can I say except you're welcome for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:07] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome.

[00:11] I'm just an ordinary, dimmy guy.

[00:13] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:18] All right, everybody.

[00:18] Welcome to the Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:21] I think it's May 25th.

[00:22] For those of you on Patreon, you're going to hear this show in the best audio possible.

[00:27] It's been a crazy week in pinball.

[00:30] Welcome, everybody, to this Saturday morning get together.

[00:33] Thank you so much for the support.

[00:34] A lot's happened this week, right?

[00:36] We got that stern media tour.

[00:38] We're going to talk about that.

[00:40] We've got possibly another Godzilla coming back.

[00:44] What is that going to do to the entire pinball collector space?

[00:48] It's getting nuts.

[00:50] It's getting nuts.

[00:51] There's so much happening.

[00:53] What do we got going on?

[00:54] We got Jersey Jack, Elton Johns are still being made.

[00:57] We've got people waiting on Pulp Fiction.

[00:59] We've got Looney Tunes.

[01:00] You can't sell.

[01:03] You can't say, I think I killed a rabbit, right?

[01:06] Apparently, like, is it Warner Brothers?

[01:08] It has, like, removed Elmer Fudd, like, shooting Bugs Bunny, and removed the iconic phrase,

[01:15] I think I killed, like, is it what?

[01:18] I think I killed a rabbit.

[01:19] Is that it?

[01:20] I forget what the iconic phrase is.

[01:22] But, you know, this is a crazy time in pinball.

[01:26] And I think as I look at everything happening in pinball right now, and as we talk about it

[01:31] on this Saturday morning's spectacular, it's just such a beautiful period.

[01:36] And I mean this when I say it, to just be patient and see where the dust settles.

[01:42] You know, let's start with John Wick.

[01:43] Let's just get right to it.

[01:45] So this game is, like, you know, damage control 101 is happening over at Stern.

[01:53] And they're doing everything in their power to try to drum up excitement for John Wick.

[01:59] And there was a moment when I saw these photos of all of these John Wick LEDs on the line.

[02:06] And it was, like, a beautiful sight, right?

[02:09] The volume, like, an ocean of playfields and cabinets and all these 500 people

[02:15] with livelihoods and families to feed, spending all of their energy and passion

[02:22] making a game where there are not 500 people who want it.

[02:26] And when I saw that, right, it's like Stern's going to manufacture 1000 of these

[02:31] whether or not there is demand or not.

[02:34] And I think everyone is witnessing something we've never witnessed before.

[02:38] Remember, we've never had a Stern game on week one.

[02:42] Since they've made this many LEDs, since the price has been this high,

[02:48] we've never had a launch really this bad.

[02:52] Like, Venom was better than this.

[02:54] Like, this was bad.

[02:57] And, you know, watching Stern try to figure out how to just, like, course correct this whole thing

[03:05] is weird, right?

[03:06] It's really weird.

[03:08] And so everybody welcome.

[03:09] I mean, I'm looking at Cliff.

[03:10] This is just an episode.

[03:12] Ha, ha.

[03:12] All right.

[03:12] So, like, watching everybody do this and watching Stern, like, invite these people in,

[03:18] and watching them try to figure out a way to get people excited about this game,

[03:22] I don't think it's really going to work.

[03:24] I don't think it's really going to work.

[03:26] And the reason why is simply this.

[03:28] It's like, there's only so many times that people are going to absorb, you know,

[03:35] the astronomical losses.

[03:36] Financially, we'll talk about that.

[03:38] But I just don't think there's a lot of demand for John Wick.

[03:41] And it's not about Gungate.

[03:44] It's more about the game itself.

[03:46] And I think that's what's missing from a lot of the distractions, if you will,

[03:51] is the game itself is pretty brutal.

[03:54] It's pretty hard.

[03:56] It's like Ninja Turtles all over again.

[04:00] And the early reports from people who have been playing this game,

[04:03] they're not walking away in love with the game.

[04:07] And then you add to the brutal gameplay, which will never change.

[04:11] Remember this.

[04:12] This will never change.

[04:14] If gameplay is brutal and it's not fun to shoot,

[04:17] or it's fun to shoot, but it's brutal,

[04:20] like a game can be fun to shoot and brutal, a game like Rick and Morty.

[04:25] Now look for a lot of people out there that can often turn into more of a frustrating game

[04:31] versus a game you want to own.

[04:32] And I think that's where it's at.

[04:34] A really fast game that is difficult,

[04:38] where you're not going to have any time to look up at the screen.

[04:42] It just feels like they got it all wrong.

[04:45] Right?

[04:45] Like the formula is wrong.

[04:46] Like if you're going to have 45 minutes of 4k video footage,

[04:52] then you're going to want to create a game that has a little bit more stop and go action.

[04:57] So you can appreciate everything Stern is putting onto that LCD screen,

[05:02] but they didn't do that.

[05:03] They made a game in which you barely have any time to look up.

[05:07] And because you barely have any time to look up at the screen,

[05:11] what's the point of filling that LCD with so much content?

[05:16] It's just not cohesive and it's just not going to work.

[05:20] And I think that's another reason why John Wick isn't really catching on with people.

[05:26] You just need to nudge it a lot, says Michael Jones.

[05:29] I don't know.

[05:30] I don't know.

[05:31] And Michael just said he never got to look up.

[05:34] And I think that's an interesting thing people are experiencing with a lot of these modern games.

[05:40] You know, the moment we have an LCD screen,

[05:42] you have the ability to put a lot on that screen.

[05:45] Jersey Jack, remember old school Jersey Jack,

[05:48] how they put way too much information on the screen.

[05:50] You'd walk up to a Hobbit and you don't even know what to look at.

[05:54] Like stuff's happening everywhere,

[05:55] pyrids of the Caribbean, stuff's happening everywhere,

[05:58] Wizard of Oz, there's like four different screens, right?

[06:00] Stuff happening everywhere.

[06:02] So I think we want to get back.

[06:04] And I think everyone feels this way.

[06:06] There is a desire to get back to a little bit more simplicity of what's on the screen

[06:15] and more complexity in what's underneath the glass.

[06:20] And by complexity under the glass, it's two things, right?

[06:24] It's more ball paths and more toys and more unique layouts.

[06:29] Like you can have a, like you look at a Godzilla or an Avengers

[06:33] and you look at all the different ways you can play that game.

[06:36] All the different gameplay elements.

[06:38] And you know, when you look at a game like Godzilla,

[06:41] I think the reason why Godzilla is number one is still that it is a sort of symphony

[06:48] of everything we want in a game, right?

[06:50] Great layout, great toys, great theme integration, great call outs, great clips,

[06:58] great assets, great music, great modes, great moments, like great everything.

[07:05] Like you add it all up and Godzilla is a game that checks so many boxes.

[07:12] And Godzilla LE was $10,500.

[07:17] So as long as Godzilla is $10,500, it's just not going to work

[07:24] that you try to sell a John Wick for $13,000.

[07:28] And now that Godzilla is coming back, let's talk a little bit about that in a minute.

[07:33] But I want to go back to this media tour that Stern did because I think there's been a lot of

[07:39] back and forth, a lot of nastiness.

[07:43] And I think people need to all chill out.

[07:47] I think there is a lot of finger pointing and name calling and a lot of nastiness around something that

[07:59] it was innocuous.

[08:00] Like it was totally innocuous that Stern Pinball was going to invite people to their facility

[08:07] to see behind the curtain, none of which felt radically new.

[08:11] I mean, you know, as much as like some stuff was being billed as like never before seen,

[08:16] and some of it you might not have seen before, but nothing radically new,

[08:21] just other than the scale, was just mind boggling to a lot of people who visited Stern,

[08:26] how big they now are.

[08:28] And it is a Titanic boat going down the river or the ocean.

[08:33] It is no longer a nimble operation.

[08:36] It never was, but now can they grow into this new facility?

[08:41] And so inviting those people over there, so what?

[08:43] Right?

[08:44] I don't care.

[08:44] Like I know Albert went on a rant and Jason wanted to be there and other people wanted to be there.

[08:50] But as far as I'm concerned, like I read Jason Napp's story.

[08:54] Looked like everybody had a good time.

[08:56] I saw them all huddle into a prom bus and go have some drinks and beers and food and play some

[09:03] pinball and arcade machines.

[09:05] That looked like a good time.

[09:07] As far as I'm concerned, I don't know what the big uproar is really about.

[09:11] I do know that the only reason they most likely did this was because John Wick sales are abysmal.

[09:19] And the reason why I say that is you just got to ask yourself why now?

[09:23] And I think why is the most important question to ask right now about what's happening in all the

[09:28] pinball?

[09:29] Why did Stern pinball right now invite these individuals into Stern pinball?

[09:34] If John Wick was a sellout and John Wick was doing tremendously well financially,

[09:40] Stern pinball would not have done this.

[09:43] They didn't do this with jaws.

[09:45] They didn't do this even with venom.

[09:47] They didn't do this with food fighters.

[09:49] They've never done this before.

[09:51] So I think they reached a period where they realized, oh my gosh, like we really can't act like the

[09:59] almighty anymore.

[10:00] We can't be so arrogant that we're not going to bring in the very people that talk about us,

[10:07] that love us, that keep the conversation going on a weekly basis.

[10:12] And so I think this move was very strategic.

[10:16] I also think it's not going to do anything.

[10:19] Like it's not going to do anything for John Wick sales.

[10:23] It's not going to do anything for Stern because I think you and I, and I mean this when I say this,

[10:29] actions speak louder than words.

[10:32] And I don't care to go over to Stern pinball and hear George Gomez's words or Davis's words or hear Gary Stern's words.

[10:42] What I think everybody wants to see from Stern pinball are actions.

[10:46] And I think the actions everybody wants to see from Stern pinball is either in action to lower the pricing

[10:55] because COVID pricing is over.

[10:58] And I want to talk about their inability to lower the pricing and the stubbornness to think that people were going to throw $13,000 and $10,000 at John Wick's.

[11:08] I want to see them lower the prices.

[11:11] If you're not going to lower the prices, then the next action I want to see you take

[11:15] is to actually lower the number of L.E.s on certain titles because you know

[11:22] the demand is not there for that specific title. They've never done that. Right? Same number. There's more L.E.s of Venom than Star Wars.

[11:31] There's more L.E.s of John Wick than Ghostbusters.

[11:35] There's more L.E.s of John Wick than Go Down a List and Tron, then Batman, then properties with way more enthusiasm.

[11:43] And yet they haven't done that. They really think, Stern really thinks

[11:47] it's baked a process and a meal that it can serve to us every four months without making any adjustments to it.

[11:58] And the adjustments they are making, it's not happening below the glass. And this is the real issue, everybody.

[12:04] The adjustments and the innovation and the technology and the engineering is all happening

[12:12] digitally. They are really investing and doubling down on internet connectivity.

[12:18] And they want it all to be on the screen and on the internet. And downloadable content is coming

[12:25] and paying for certain perks is coming. And all of that is coming.

[12:31] And so when you look at John Wick, and I mean this when I say this, when I look down at John Wick

[12:37] and I look at what's in the game, right? Let's just forget about the artwork.

[12:42] Forget about Kari Hardy waving guns. Forget about Hitler quotes. Forget about like all the back and forth. Forget about it all.

[12:50] All that doesn't mean anything. The only thing that I'm looking at is what they engineered in this game.

[12:58] And it's 2024. This is like 50 years. What is Stern now? Like 40 years

[13:05] of their experience making pinball machines. And does this look like the culmination

[13:12] of what they know how to put into a pinball machine

[13:16] after 40 years? And I know that like Elliott is not 40 years old, but Gomez has been in this industry for a long time.

[13:23] So has Gary. You know, and like it's just not adding up. Like there's not enough in the game.

[13:30] And not only that, there's just like lazy things. Like they didn't even make different playfields for the pro.

[13:37] Do you know that? Like look at the pro machine where the drop target goes in the pro.

[13:42] They didn't even make a different playfield than the premium, right? They just put a freaking piece of plastic that covers up

[13:50] where the drop target is in the pro.

[13:54] So Stern, you know, I know you want to make efficiencies. I know you need to keep that big factory going.

[14:01] But ultimately all of your efforts are going to be summarized by how good the product is.

[14:10] And if the product isn't good or the product isn't worth the money, then none of the media tours are going to matter.

[14:17] And no one's going to be guilted into buying these machines because there's men and women who work at the company that

[14:23] have families. You know, I saw that a little bit. You know, there's a little bit.

[14:27] There's a little bit of a desire to sort of make people feel

[14:31] somewhat empathetic to a company that employs 500 people that is connected to thousands of other vendors.

[14:41] And I remember hearing speak like that when the government had a bailout general motors, right?

[14:48] It's like we had a feel for all the people there that had been making a product that just didn't have the demand anymore.

[14:55] And they got bailed out. And I just want to say this. I don't think those comparisons are equal,

[15:01] but I also don't feel any guilt or empathy or need to bail out anyone who works at Stern.

[15:08] They're all, no one's forcing them to be there. And I bet they enjoyed working at Stern a lot more

[15:16] when there was excitement for games like Ghostbusters LE and Godzilla LE and excitement for games. You know, there wasn't this

[15:25] moaning and groaning like there is now.

[15:27] Right. There just wasn't. I mean, I've been covering this hobby for 10 years.

[15:33] And I don't really enjoy the last three years as much as I did before. I'll tell you why.

[15:41] Because the emphasis is no longer on the games

[15:45] because the games don't add up to the prices.

[15:49] And they want to try as hard as they can.

[15:52] They want to try with every iota of marketing skill they have. They want to try with every relationship they've fostered.

[16:02] They want to try as hard as they can to avoid you from thinking about this hobby through that lens.

[16:10] And I think it's a decade in the making arrogance that as long as it's fun,

[16:18] we can charge whatever we want.

[16:21] And I think that only works

[16:24] is if the fun is through the roof and the product itself is as good or better than games you have already

[16:32] in your collections.

[16:34] And so let's talk about what Stern's next move is going to be. And it's going to be dicey because

[16:41] if they make Godzilla

[16:44] premium anniversary edition. So if they remake Godzilla and ladies and gentlemen, let's just clarify

[16:53] once and for all, George Gomez said exactly how this is going to be.

[16:58] All right, this is how it's going to be.

[17:01] They're going to make an anniversary edition,

[17:05] 70th anniversary of Godzilla

[17:09] with black and white artwork.

[17:11] Something will be in color. Maybe it's the blue beam of Godzilla. Most likely it's going to be Godzilla himself, right?

[17:19] And maybe some of the blue from his, I don't know what you call it, is atomic breath or whatever his ray beam is, right?

[17:26] Okay, so

[17:29] that sounds awesome. I mean just on a pure do you want a Godzilla black and white, which is way more

[17:37] appropriate for the Toho Godzilla for the throwback of the show itself. And just more classic feeling.

[17:44] And dare I say

[17:46] that the weakest link, I think I've heard people talk about when they talk about Godzilla, is the overly colorful

[17:54] zombie-eddy art style in the game. That it's just too colorful. Like Godzilla should have been a little bit more mooted,

[18:03] mooted, muted, muted, muted. I think it's muted.

[18:06] Godzilla should have been a little bit more muted. It should have had a little bit more of an old school Godzilla feel to it,

[18:12] like the old Godzilla posters. And it just feels more colorful

[18:17] like Ninja Turtles, right? It feels very much along those lines. And I think

[18:22] taking zombie-eddy's artwork and putting it in black and white is going to get really interesting because there's going to be a lot of

[18:30] interesting contrast now with the game.

[18:33] Yes, Godzilla's skin looked like a little bit like a watermelon. I've heard all the jokes.

[18:38] It's still the number one game in the world.

[18:40] The number one game in the world, maybe the best game Stern has ever made.

[18:43] So say what you will about Godzilla. There's really not a lot of weak links.

[18:48] You know, even nitpicking zombie-eddy artwork is kind of stupid because the game does look great. I will say this though.

[18:54] I've always said this though. I think the Ellie of Godzilla is boring.

[18:58] I've always felt the Ellie of Godzilla is super boring.

[19:02] I've never felt the desire to have a Godzilla Ellie.

[19:06] That that armor sucks. It's so boring that

[19:10] Mecha Godzilla armor is terrible. The gray, it's so boring.

[19:14] A Godzilla Ellie does not pop in a lineup. It just doesn't. Like there are so many other games

[19:22] that pop in a lineup more than Godzilla Ellie.

[19:25] And so here's what I think is going to happen because you know, they wanted to make this

[19:31] a limited edition, a la Elvira blood kiss edition. You know, they wanted to so badly to make

[19:38] Godzilla Ellie

[19:40] 70th anniversary. I bet what they were going to do

[19:44] was make 700 of them and make it and they would have sold everyone

[19:50] and every single

[19:52] Ellie owner would have been burned and you know, that was the original plan.

[19:56] But distributors and us, what did we do? We became toxic Avengers.

[20:03] We spoke our minds Stern. You can't keep doing this and George Gomez had to go and course correct. Again,

[20:10] their original strategy

[20:12] was to do what they did with Elvira. See, this is the part George Gomez doesn't get.

[20:18] He doesn't, he doesn't get it. Like I get, I respect you, George, but the part you're missing George

[20:22] is you don't get it. You don't get because I've heard George's interviews and he doesn't get it yet.

[20:27] He's like, I don't understand why someone who has an Elvira where there's only

[20:33] 199 of them, right? The signature edition games. I don't understand why those people are mad.

[20:39] When we made the 40th anniversary of Elvira, like why are they mad?

[20:45] They still have an Ellie with less numbers attached to it. I'll tell you why George, why they're mad.

[20:51] It's not just about there being 199

[20:55] is that you then went and made another version of the game, the 40th

[20:59] and you made it nicer than the 199. So you burn those original people because they just want the nicest version of the game, George.

[21:08] This is the part you don't get. Okay, then what did you do, George? You guys,

[21:12] you then went and made a blood kiss edition, which is even nicer than the 40th anniversary edition.

[21:20] And now you don't understand why those people who bought the 40th are all pissed off because you made an even nicer version.

[21:29] So George, here's what's going to happen now.

[21:32] You're going to make a Godzilla premium because you can't go back and make more Ellie's because you promised that.

[21:38] Now you're going to go make a nicer version

[21:41] of Godzilla and bill it as a premium.

[21:46] And you haven't broken your word, but now you've made, if someone loves Godzilla,

[21:51] the Ellie owner should always have the nicest version of the game ever. They should have the most unique, the most special,

[21:59] the most like appealing to look at. Everything should be the best, right? And it's like,

[22:05] you're not going to do that because you're going to make a version now.

[22:08] That is going to be the nicest version to have because you're going to make it better.

[22:13] And then you're going to piss off, even if it's not limited, you're going to now create.

[22:17] Watch what happens to Godzilla Ellie's when this new version comes out.

[22:23] Watch what happens. They're going to go down in value.

[22:26] And then all of a sudden you've pumped more games out into the world.

[22:31] And again, it's like, if Stern continues to do this

[22:36] and make anniversary editions to make a Batman 70th anniversary edition, if they continue to do this, and by the way,

[22:44] it would be Batman 60th, not 70th, Batman 60th anniversary because the last one was in 2016,

[22:53] and that was the 50th anniversary of Batman. So this is what's going to happen.

[22:59] And you could keep doing this. You could keep doing these moves and make a Star Wars

[23:06] Boba Fett edition. You could make an Ecto Ghostbusters Ectomobile edition that comes with the topper.

[23:18] You could go make, let's just throw out like Tron, Ellie's all over again. One light cycles blue,

[23:26] one is the orange. You could do that. You could do make a Batman anniversary edition where 400

[23:34] Batman editions and 400 Robin editions. You could keep doing this because the only thing they're doing

[23:42] is they're changing either the color palette or the armor and, but Stern, what you don't get is this.

[23:51] What you don't get is this. What's kept your company and kept people buying your new in box

[23:58] all these years is just this feeling that if I get one of the best, that it's not going to get

[24:06] replaced by something better. And you can't fall back on just the numbers are the only thing that

[24:14] make it more special because Stern wake up call. And this is a wake up call to George Gomez and

[24:20] Seth Davis. Explain to me this, George and Gary, Zach and Seth and all of you guys. Explain to me

[24:28] why your L. E.s are the versions of your games that are losing the most amount of money.

[24:38] A stern L. E. financially loses within the first six months way more money than a premium,

[24:45] which is unlimited way more money than a pro. Explain to me why you think you're onto something

[24:54] with your current strategy. And so how many times do you think you're going to be able to unload

[25:01] these L. E.s onto buyers and watch them lose their shirt on everyone while their friends who bought

[25:09] the premiums are in much better shape and heck their friends who bought the pros are in the best

[25:15] shape. So the cheapest Stern is the best buy that is upside down marketing. That is upside down

[25:26] business strategy. And that makes no sense because what you're saying Stern is the people you care

[25:33] the least about holding value and giving them value are the people that are spending the most money.

[25:40] It's like buying a first class ticket and you get the peanuts and the dudes back in coach

[25:46] are eating the filet mignon and I don't need an all expense paid trip to go see you guys.

[25:55] I can just observe your actions and what everybody wants in pinball now Stern is for you guys to

[26:02] stop talking and start making moves that actually repair the damage that you've made with your own

[26:11] customer base. And it's not going to happen by flying 10 media outlets. I mean other than Jason

[26:19] Knapp you invited the poodles in you didn't invite the Rottweilers you invited the poodles.

[26:25] You didn't want the dogs with any bark. And the only one of that whole group like Jason Knapp I

[26:30] respect the heck out of him. And he's the only one who covered it too. It's like when you see that

[26:36] little clown Colin running around you see what Colin did and Pinside. He wrote this post being

[26:41] like because people were sticking up for Jason Knapp and Collins like yep it's hard being us.

[26:46] And everyone's like what do you mean us. Like you're not part of anything Colin you're not in the same

[26:53] conversation as Jason Knapp. There's no us. There's no solidarity. And he's like yeah we're all buddies

[27:00] no Colin no no you don't get to just walk in to someone else's praise and say hey yep that's

[27:08] what it's like being us Colin and Jason Knapp. Nope nope and maybe you should remove Jason Knapp

[27:15] as a contributor to your Kinetis's site because he's not. He doesn't contribute to your site nor

[27:22] does he want to. And you don't get to like list people as contributors when they're not. You need

[27:27] to not think that we forgot this stuff buddy. All right. Okay us hard being us hard being us.

[27:35] It's like it'd be like it'd be like if someone was coming in to like if Zach Sharp made a marketing

[27:40] move and people didn't like it and I chime in I'm like yep it's hard being Zach and Chris you know

[27:46] it's hard being us marketers like you know you know Zach and I like we get it we get what we get

[27:50] why you feel this way you know you don't get to put yourself into that association okay.

[27:55] Stick to your last brother stick to your last. All right so look none of it's going to work.

[28:00] We are in a really brave new world of pinball. The market is so oversaturated. There are 14

[28:07] companies trying to make games. If you have patience you will win. If you are patient you will come

[28:14] out on top. The patient man and I'm not asking you to be patient for very long but the patient man

[28:22] will walk in and pay a great price for a game. Did you just see a dealer now is selling a godfather

[28:29] LE new inbox for $9,000. That's $3,500 cheaper than no $3,000 cheaper. I thought it was $12,000.

[28:39] That's $3,000 cheaper than that game cost new inbox a little over a year ago. Okay and that's new.

[28:49] Imagine now what a used godfather LE costs. If a new inbox one is nine your year old game is around

[28:57] eight to seventy five hundred and so now you've lost forty five hundred dollars. How fun is that?

[29:03] You having fun? And the reason why I say be patient and the patient man waits is this. Well here's

[29:11] the thing Emily and then I'll go back to what I was saying. Colin basically absorbed all of the

[29:18] subscribers to this weekend pinball. Okay imagine this Emily. Imagine doing this. It's disingenuous.

[29:25] It's not authentic. He bought this weekend pinball apparently for five bucks or whatever it's sold

[29:30] for and now he's saying that he has those subscribers. Okay but you bought it. You didn't earn those

[29:37] subscribers. Let's not forget that Will is the one. You know Will and Jeff, right? Jeff Patterson.

[29:47] Patterson, right? Will and Jeff created this weekend pinball. See people forget this. They created

[29:53] this weekend pinball and did all of the hard work that made people subscribe not Colin and they were

[30:01] they got pushed out of the hobby. Like they want nothing to do with this hobby anymore. They did so

[30:07] much hard work. It was thankless work and Colin saw an opportunity to acquire a fan base that he

[30:16] did not earn or create. Okay okay it's just that simple and now he's boasting about it and when he

[30:24] moved over the trip audience to his Kinetis' Facebook page he's now promoting it as like look

[30:31] at them numbers. Look at them numbers. That'd be like inheriting money and being like look at

[30:37] much money I got. Yeah but you didn't work for any of it. You didn't work for any of it. No John,

[30:43] he's not living rent-free in my head John. I want to talk about some of this stuff because I think

[30:47] it's important because I think people don't understand history and how things went down and I

[30:53] think people should be giving credit to the people who made this weekend pinball. Okay so when I'm

[30:58] out of pinball podcasting and Saturday mornings and Facebook one day I hope someone stands up

[31:04] and tells the truth of what happened historically and it's not about living. Believe me believe me.

[31:10] The guy does not live rent-free in my head. I don't even think about that guy and you know he only

[31:14] pops up every once in a while and it's like whack-a-mole. He's back down again. You never

[31:17] hear from him. He can't do this. He can't do a Facebook live. He can't do anything. All right so

[31:24] we're at a point now where the patient man, the patient man is going to get whatever he wants,

[31:32] whatever she wants. If you're patient, you know when I saw Stern making all those John Wick

[31:39] LEDs I'm like this is good. This is good because those games now have to go somewhere and you

[31:45] know where they're not going to go into most people's homes and when that happens they're

[31:50] going to be on sale and if you want a John Wick and you want an LE and you pay 13 already you just

[31:58] lost three to four thousand dollars. All right so look I think Stern Pinball needs to hear from the

[32:04] people they don't want to hear from and I know I've covered off mostly on Stern on this episode

[32:10] because they're the number one pinball company. It's by far. Like they're so by far in front

[32:16] it's not even funny. I mean look at them they're stumbling right now. Stern Pinball is stumbling

[32:22] and nobody else can take advantage of it. Nobody. There is nobody taking advantage of Stern Pinball

[32:30] stumbling right now. Right they're stumbling like yeah Funhouse, Remake, that's not going to take

[32:36] advantage of it and by the way Padready they still have not uploaded any gameplay footage of their

[32:42] product and so why did you reveal Funhouse and they did it strategically. They saw Stern Pinball

[32:49] stumbling with John Wick. They reveal Funhouse and then what nothing nothing where's the official

[32:55] stream like where's the gameplay where's you know it's like they're just trying to sell you on the

[32:59] artwork and I'm sorry gang but like that's not enough anymore. You can't bring back a 35 year

[33:05] game with a new art package and a 2.0 kit that people don't love and then not stand behind it

[33:12] and follow up with more content and your order banks are open. This is the part that annoys me

[33:19] is like all of this it's so thinly veiled like if you want to take people's money give them as much

[33:24] as they need before they have to pull the trigger but nobody's taking advantage of this right now.

[33:30] Jersey Jack is not. I mean Elton John is a slow burn. It's not selling like terribly but it's not

[33:37] selling like crazy. American Pinball taking $500 off its pins is they could take $5,000 off their

[33:46] pins nobody's buying them. I mean I mean that when I say it American Pinball could take $5,000 off of

[33:53] their pins and nobody's buying these things. It's just there's too much. There's too much out there.

[34:01] It would be nice to finally get these Pulp Fiction LEs. I think back to the future is the thing that's

[34:06] got me the most excited. The company that should be taking a little bit of a John Wick advantage

[34:13] is Dutch Pinball X. Like where's Alice in Wonderland? Like where's the teasers? Like where is just

[34:21] announcing the title? It is an unlicensed IP. Do you know what that means? It's not unlicensed. It's

[34:27] a license that has an open IP which means there is no license holder which means Dutch Pinball

[34:36] does not need to get approval to start sharing or talking about Alice in Wonderland. There's

[34:43] absolutely nothing keeping them from building a little bit of a groundswell around this game.

[34:52] And I've been trying to tell Barry and he's trying to tell Melvin but Melvin's not listening to me

[34:58] because it's another one of these like stubborn marketing moves where you're just going to pull

[35:04] the curtain off it and think you're going to sell $514,000. Chris you said you wanted companies to

[35:12] lower prices and AP and all I'm saying bro don't make me rant again. Albert first of all

[35:19] it's nice having you here. I know you got upset but don't worry not being invited to the stern

[35:27] media day is a little bit of a compliment. It means you're doing something right. They didn't want

[35:36] people who wouldn't toe the line there and the feedback stern needs to hear.

[35:43] They need to hear feedback from people that are upset. They need to hear feedback from people

[35:49] that need to tell them what they need to hear not what they want to hear and they're not getting it.

[35:56] They're not getting it or maybe they secretly joined Canadian Spinball podcast and maybe they hang

[36:01] out here but Michael Grant and George and Jody and Zach and like I get it guys. I get it. You guys

[36:11] are very successful. You've done a lot very well but you also have done a lot really bad over the

[36:17] last three years and you're not reading the vibe and vibe is everything. You know it's like a company

[36:24] when the culture shifts in the wrong direction and it gets negative and it gets toxic and people

[36:32] start to like second guess why do I work here? Do I do I respect the leadership decisions?

[36:40] Do I feel good associating myself with a company that does this? This is where stern doesn't get it.

[36:48] They just think that everything gets multiplied by fun that they can do whatever move they make

[36:55] and it's just we're all going to keep lining up to buy because pinball is fun and we're not going

[37:00] to think a little bit deeper about the moves they're making what it says about how they feel about us

[37:07] and what investing a lot of our money in their product in the long term what that might mean

[37:15] to us like there might be some implications if you spend a hundred thousand dollars on stern

[37:22] LEs and your collection is worth 60 grand in five years what are you gonna how are you gonna feel

[37:30] right how are you gonna feel because that was never the case you know it was an interesting week

[37:35] it was an interesting week did anything else happen in the pinball world that I should be aware of

[37:40] the story has been on stern mainly I think jersey jack is getting ready for its next game

[37:47] over the next like probably six months I'm excited to see what other people do because

[37:52] pinball now is home runner big miss like you hear nobody talking about ABBA nobody talking about

[38:00] funhouse remake the john wick owner's club is four pages long people there's if you put up a thread

[38:06] today how do you feel about canada I'm serious if you put up a thread on pin side today someone do

[38:13] this how do you feel about canada I would have four pages by noon by noon today there will be four

[38:20] pages of people articulating what a narcissistic sociopathic nightmare of a toxic pinball personality

[38:29] I am that's cool that's cool if you want to see what live and rent free is go do that thread and see

[38:35] how many people have strong opinions four pages on a brand new stern game that's been out for three

[38:42] weeks now and they can't even get past four pages in an owner's club that's pathetic this is the worst

[38:51] launch they've had since wwe all right but they can't afford launches like this something went wrong

[39:00] something went horribly wrong and I don't know if they have a way out of it I think they do have a

[39:06] way out of it it's called godzilla anniversary edition and then it's called pokemon and then it's

[39:12] called masters of the universe maybe dungeons and dragons they've got stuff coming this isn't the end

[39:20] this is a blip this is a you know this is this is a flop I mean stern every once in a while

[39:27] stern is going to have a flop and when they have a flop they go back to the well they're smart right

[39:33] it's smart to go back to the well if you flop on john wick you make up the millions with another run

[39:39] of godzilla zero r&d zero development costs you've already spent all the development costs you can

[39:46] go make millions for doing nothing more than an art package when jersey jack has a flop what do they do

[39:53] they release another flop they don't go back to the well and re-release again people want

[39:59] people want pirates of the caribbean all right so you come out with toy story four

[40:04] and it's a flop what do you do do you make another pirates to fill the gap nope you make another flop

[40:11] in the godfather and godfather flopped so what did they do did they go back to the well and make

[40:18] more wizard of os games or more pirates or more of something people want it nope they made another

[40:25] flop elton john it's not a sales phenomenon now look elton john is a great game and as much as

[40:32] you know i made fun of it at the beginning elton john is the game of the year there's no

[40:39] there's no other game that has made a mark after playing it better than elton john let me let me

[40:48] spend a few minutes let me end this i can only do an hour show today because i got to go get a haircut

[40:52] we're doing a a pro photographer is coming in here to take pictures of of the boys and me and brenda

[40:59] and i told brenda i need to get a haircut cassian is sleeping next door let me end this show with

[41:05] some positivity because i i want to i want you guys to understand that i that i love this hobby

[41:10] more than people realize and that is why seeing bonehead it moves and stern being greedy really

[41:18] upsets me because they don't need to right they're they're very successful company they don't need to

[41:23] be greedy jersey jack pinball is elton john is a is a magical game and the reason why it's a magical

[41:32] game and i like and i know i've got some canada fans that that don't like it that think it's cheap

[41:37] that think it's no no no no and i've played pinball for like you know like noticing what's

[41:43] actually happening in a game now for a little over 12 years and i want to tell you right now

[41:48] elton john is one of the best shooting pinball machines of all time elton john is easily i think

[41:57] the most impressive modern pinball experience you can have it's only second in presentation

[42:07] impressiveness to guns and roses guns and roses still to me and i'm not just saying this because

[42:14] i have a guns and roses what gnr does with the lights synced up with the song elton doesn't

[42:19] have that as much like elton has some moments but gnr as a pure visual wow like when you watch somebody

[42:27] play guns and roses there is no other modern pinball machine that creates a visual wow like guns and

[42:35] roses doesn't shoot nearly as well right it doesn't it doesn't even come close so elton john

[42:42] is the most impressive modern pinball experience ever i would say it is the nicest modern pinball

[42:52] machine that checks almost every single box you'd want to have an incredible pinball experience

[43:00] the artwork is phenomenal like it looks stunning the music and the sound are incredible like it

[43:08] sounds better than any modern pinball machine you could add some pinwoofers to it sure it doesn't

[43:14] need it it really doesn't need it yeah you're getting better but it's great it's got i think some of

[43:21] the best flow in any game ever the game just is fast but it's not brutal you know take take some

[43:29] notes john wick what i love about elton john is the gameplay is super fast but it's not brutal you

[43:37] are going to drain you're not going to play for 45 minutes and you are loving the speed but you

[43:43] can't take your eyes off the play field it doesn't bombard you with multi balls it doesn't like you

[43:51] know how to start them you're not just hitting random switches and you're in multi ball all day

[43:55] long like gnr you know maybe some of them get repetitive like crocodile rock but my gosh there

[44:01] is maybe no more fun multi ball beginning than rocket man multi ball and i think everyone needs to

[44:08] just realize this when a multi ball begins in pinball it should be a moment you never get tired of

[44:18] it should be a moment you want to get back to time and time again it shouldn't be something that's

[44:23] just repeatedly handed to you in a very sterile and boring way like some jersey jack games and some

[44:31] stern games no when you get to multi ball it should be like adam's family like lord of the rings to

[44:38] war like it should make you feel like there's there's like sweat building up in your hands and you

[44:44] can't wait to tackle what's about to happen and that's why when you get to rocket man multi ball

[44:51] in elton john it is epic it is wow it never gets old and i'm telling you right now if all things

[45:01] were considered right now and collin didn't destroy the stupid twippies with his his his his silly

[45:09] tirade against people being recognized if the twippies were happening this year this would be

[45:17] and should be the game of the year it is that good it is that good now the only thing not working

[45:28] in elton john is the price is the price and i've said this before and i'll say it again i'm not so

[45:37] sure elton john pricing will ever go down that much and nor should it nor should it because the game

[45:47] is that good it just is and when you own it trust me when you own it you're not going to want to

[45:55] get rid of it because next to jaws even though jaws is jaws right a theme you might would rather have

[46:05] even though jaws has like you know stern's approach to coding even though jaws has probably more

[46:11] objectives you'll spend your whole life and never battle jaws i mean that's jaws you need a whole

[46:16] reason why they're doing this right you don't see anybody killing jaws in jaws right how many months

[46:22] has jaws been out has anyone battled jaws is it even in the game and when it is in the game you're

[46:28] never going to get to jaws but you know why you're going to get to jaws because stern's going to make

[46:33] a two thousand dollar topper and if you buy the two thousand dollar topper that'll give you a shortcut

[46:39] to play jaws right away all part of their strategy all part of the plan let's make these guys

[46:47] let's give them the mike tyson cheat code for two thousand dollars that's all it is people

[46:54] the toppers are mike tyson cheat codes for two thousand dollars okay but man i want an elton john

[47:01] man i do i you know like i'm financially right now i just i sold my batman s le

[47:06] i sold it yesterday sold it twenty eight thousand dollars i'm happy with who bought it

[47:13] you're gonna see it you're gonna see where it lands could i have got a little bit more money yes i

[47:19] think thirty is where the last one sold the reason why i took twenty eight local sale no shipping no

[47:27] headaches and i know it's going to a guy that's not gonna like ocd the damn thing he's actually

[47:33] gonna put it out for people to play so i'm and you know where that money's going twenty eight

[47:40] thousand dollars of batman pinball money is going to thirty eight thousand dollars in furniture

[47:48] that i bought for the family as i said to brenda i'm one million percent happy about that move

[47:57] when you walk into our home i don't just want like any table i know the kids are going to be

[48:02] doing crazy stuff but i want people to walk into our home and and that stuff matters more to me

[48:07] right it matters more to me you're going to see like a beautiful kitchen table you're going to see

[48:11] a couch that can withstand the children you're going to see the new like picture frame tv you're

[48:16] everything i want my wife to walk into the house and we feel good about it jonathan addler stuff

[48:22] you know five grand here five grand there seven grand like i just yeah let's get it and when i

[48:26] was furniture shopping it was crazy because like wait that couch is only two thousand dollars how can

[48:31] this couch be two thousand dollars how can it couch be two thousand dollars when a stern topper is

[48:36] two thousand dollars so i was really happy to do that i also instead of buying another pinball machine

[48:43] i bought myself a little toy now my toy has four wheels and because i need another car

[48:51] the demon is fully paid for felt good final demon payment got the title coming so now the cost of

[48:59] owning the demon is only two hundred and something bucks a month when i move over to connecticut

[49:03] insurance um brenda and i are going to get her a family mobile in connecticut in the next couple

[49:09] weeks and then i needed something though i need something just around town i needed something

[49:15] around town i needed something just to go to the gym in you know pick up some something from the

[49:20] grocery store go visit my brother go visit my parents i'm not going to be taking the demon as my daily

[49:25] when brenda needs the car for the kids so i got myself a little something fun i will share the

[49:32] photos of it when i'm done it's very canada it's very neo tokyo it's very me and it's not expensive

[49:38] now's the other thing is like it's the price of two jersey jacks ce's and like a stern premium

[49:48] i mean that's what the price of this car is and you know i would much rather have this and i think

[49:53] everyone's in the same boat there we're spending way too much money great games are out there

[49:58] but you know we all know they're not worth this much money and i'm in a point in my life where

[50:05] i'm still going to have my guns and roses ce i'm going to still do my show i have room for two

[50:13] pinball machines what takes that second spot next to gnr is going to be a battle amongst these

[50:20] manufacturers to see who who amongst them can can take over the real estate in canada's cozy

[50:28] house i mean that's that's where it's at i i spent over sticker on this house

[50:34] in 20 minutes after seeing it more money over the listing price then almost probably all of

[50:40] your pinball collections are worth so just know that that you know that this is not a sign of

[50:46] i've hit rough financial times it's just the re i everything's still great it's just man homes are

[50:52] expensive in commuting towns to new york city because i'm still coming into work two to three

[50:57] days a week a one hour train ride into new york city i'm super happy that my house is a four

[51:04] minute walk to the train station and when i'm on the train you best believe i'll be able to read up

[51:10] on pin side and what's happening on naps arcade put up my facebook memes and then by the time
