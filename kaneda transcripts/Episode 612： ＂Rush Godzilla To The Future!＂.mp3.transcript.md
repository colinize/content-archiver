[00:00] Why you tell me backstab me bring the fake?

[00:03] Wobble breeze tell me lies, time flies, go jah, go with me.

[00:09] Come with me.

[00:14] Come with me.

[00:18] I know everybody is waiting for Godzilla Pimbal on September 8th.

[00:24] Stern Pimbal has said that is the date in which they will release their next title.

[00:30] We know it's Keith Ellwyn, we know it's Godzilla, we know it is Zombie Yeti, and this game

[00:36] is going to be either a humongous success for Stern Pimbal or maybe a huge disappointment

[00:44] if it does not live up to the expectations of the Pimbal world which one will it be.

[00:50] That's not what I want to talk about on this episode because we're going to talk a lot

[00:54] about Godzilla this week when we see it, we will deconstruct it, we know nobody at Stern

[00:59] will join Pimbal podcast to talk about it so you'll be inundated on every other single

[01:06] Pimbal podcast in which everyone interviews Zombie Yeti and Keith Ellwyn and the rule

[01:10] people of the game.

[01:11] But here's what I want to talk about.

[01:12] I want to talk about themes and as I'm reading Pinside it's very interesting on the

[01:17] eve of Godzilla.

[01:18] There are people legitimately arguing about whether or not Godzilla is a better theme

[01:25] than back to the future.

[01:26] There are people arguing about whether or not Rush Pimbal will sell.

[01:32] Now I want to look at these three themes in a vacuum.

[01:35] Rush Pimbal back to the future and Godzilla.

[01:39] What if I told you that each of these and I mean this, each of these is actually going

[01:44] to do very, very good in the Pimbal marketplace.

[01:48] That each of these franchises, if you think about it, what do you need to be successful when

[01:53] you come up with a Pimbal theme?

[01:55] You need there to be overlap between people who like Pimbal and people who like this theme

[02:01] and you need to sell at least I would say to be successful.

[02:05] You need to get at least 2000 orders if you're a company like Stern of these games.

[02:10] Now Stern's aiming probably closer to 5000 units of every major cornerstone game they

[02:16] make.

[02:17] What if I told you that Godzilla, a franchise that is almost 70 years old and has grossed

[02:25] over 1.6 billion dollars at the box office?

[02:29] What if I told you Godzilla will easily sell thousands of games for Stern Pimbal?

[02:35] There are enough Godzilla fans out there who also like Pimbal so it's going to do really

[02:42] well.

[02:43] Now, add Keith L. Wynn and Zambieti into that mix and it's going to be a juggernaut hit

[02:49] for Stern Pimbal.

[02:50] Let's talk about back to the future.

[02:52] Back to the future better than Godzilla.

[02:54] It's a stupid argument.

[02:56] It's a stupid argument to have.

[02:58] They're both great themes for Pimbal.

[03:01] To argue about whether or not one is better than the other, I think it's pretty stupid because

[03:05] they're both huge.

[03:07] They both have millions of fans around the world and if you launch either one, it's going

[03:12] to do very well for Stern Pimbal.

[03:14] And I don't even know if back to the future is a Stern game.

[03:18] It's not confirmed.

[03:19] I wouldn't be surprised if quite possibly this ends up being a game with CGC.

[03:25] I wouldn't be surprised if back to the future is actually a Kappaou game that follows

[03:32] Cactus Canyon Remake.

[03:33] So even as I said, it's probably not going to be a Kappaou with CGC, but I think back

[03:39] to the future Pimbal is coming, but as a theme itself.

[03:42] To have an argument over these two themes is absolutely a name.

[03:47] And I see people doing it and I don't know why.

[03:50] Why can't we, as Pimbal fans, just accept the fact that there are millions of Godzilla

[03:55] fans and millions of back to the future fans?

[03:58] And there is a lot of overlap there.

[04:01] And if you only have to sell 3 to 5,000 games to a fan base that is in the millions and

[04:09] has fans that span decades of time, then these are both amazing themes.

[04:16] The more interesting one is Rush.

[04:19] And Rush is coming out by Stern Pimbal.

[04:21] And I think it's safe to say now.

[04:23] I know I thought it was a boutique game, but it sounds like this is going to be John

[04:27] Borg's game.

[04:29] He said his next game is going to be out by the end of the year.

[04:33] And so if you were to put the pieces together, I think you're going to probably see John

[04:39] Borg's Rush sometime in December.

[04:42] Now I have said that I'm not a fan of Rush.

[04:45] And I will not be buying a Rush Pimbal.

[04:47] There is nothing that would make me buy a Rush Pimbal.

[04:51] Even if Keith Ellin designed it, even if it was the best shooting game in the world, even

[04:56] if it had the greatest world under glass, I don't even know how you make a world under

[05:00] glass for a band like Rush.

[05:01] The reason why Rush was so popular with a lot of people and is more of a cultist band,

[05:07] is they're not marketing sellouts.

[05:09] Like they're the complete opposite of a band like Kiss.

[05:12] That's all about the flash, all about the marketing, all about the costumes.

[05:17] Kiss is the kind of band that when they play each city every night, they say you're the

[05:21] best city to rock and roll in.

[05:23] And Rush is the complete opposite of that.

[05:25] They're just genuine humble people.

[05:28] They're great musicians and they've sold 25 million albums.

[05:33] Now I'm not going to get on this mic and say a band that sold 25 million albums in this

[05:38] sort of progressive rock genre, which has a lot of crossover with Pimbal buyers.

[05:44] It would be stupid for me to say that Rush won't sell to Pimbal people.

[05:48] And I saw someone put out a poll that said Rush or Motley Crew.

[05:51] And yes, personally, I think Motley Crew is way better for Pimbal.

[05:55] I would much rather have a Motley Crew Pimbal machine because I grew up loving Motley Crew.

[06:01] I love that music that high energy 80s hair metal rock was more my thing.

[06:06] I was not into Rush, but that doesn't discount.

[06:10] Like Motley Crew being great or GNR being great doesn't discount the fact that there are

[06:16] millions of people that think Rush is great.

[06:18] In these subjective arguments, they happen all the time on Pinside and it's so silly

[06:23] to me.

[06:24] I think it's safe to say that after Black Knight and I mean this, after Black Knight, Stern

[06:29] Pimbal will most likely never have a bad theme again.

[06:35] And here's the thing that makes no sense to me.

[06:37] You don't want to be in love with every single theme Stern Pimbal makes.

[06:42] That wouldn't be healthy.

[06:43] You wouldn't even financially want that to happen.

[06:46] Can you imagine a world if Stern Pimbal only made the themes that were your dream themes

[06:52] one after another after another, you would go broke.

[06:57] You would want to buy every single le every single year.

[07:01] And now if you were to buy four Stern le's in a single year, it's going to cost you 45,000

[07:08] dollars.

[07:09] So if they did it for two years in a row, you're 90 grand in on your eight Stern machines.

[07:14] It's starting to get crazy.

[07:16] So I actually think it's a blessing in disguise when a theme comes out that's an easy pass

[07:21] for you.

[07:22] Like Rush is so easy pass for me, it's going to save my money.

[07:25] I don't have to worry about that.

[07:27] But if they show Godzilla and I really want it awesome, but you know, it wouldn't be awesome.

[07:32] Three months later, they want my money for back to the future.

[07:35] And then three months after that big trouble in little China.

[07:38] And then three months after that, it's fifth element.

[07:40] And then three months after that, it's toy story.

[07:43] You see what I mean?

[07:44] It never stopped if there were no pauses in the release schedule that made you hesitant

[07:49] to buy.

[07:50] I think you would be like, I need a break.

[07:52] I need a break, Stern.

[07:53] Come on, throw a monster's in every once in a while.

[07:55] Throw a black knight back.

[07:56] Let's make high speed three.

[07:57] Let's do something different.

[07:59] I can't take you bombarding me with themes I have to own.

[08:04] I have to have.

[08:05] But it's never going to come to that, right?

[08:06] It's never going to come to the point where every single Stern machine is a theme you

[08:10] want.

[08:11] The part with Stern Pimball that's super exciting is they're going to give you variety.

[08:16] And they're going to make those games at the same time.

[08:19] Stern Pimball is not going to go all in on Godzilla for two years.

[08:23] The way Jersey Jack Pimball will only make guns and roses for two years.

[08:27] They're going to make Godzilla's.

[08:29] They're going to make Jurassic Parks.

[08:31] They're going to make Batman's and Elvira's and Led Zeppelin.

[08:35] A little bit of a side track right here.

[08:36] Did you see Slash was playing Pimball over Labor Day weekend?

[08:40] He posted a picture of him playing Pimball.

[08:43] The only problem was, and this was a little bit embarrassing for J.J.P.

[08:46] He was playing Led Zeppelin Pimball.

[08:49] Oh my God.

[08:51] Slash is playing Led Zeppelin Pimball instead of his own machine.

[08:55] And he posted it on social media.

[08:57] It's not a big deal.

[08:58] We know Slash loves Pimball.

[08:59] Of course, he's going to play other games.

[09:01] And of course, Slash is a Led Zeppelin fan.

[09:03] But I just thought that was funny.

[09:05] That Slash is promoting the music pin by Stern that nobody really loves.

[09:09] Anyway, the Pimball community always acts very strange on the eve of every new Stern launch.

[09:15] You've got different buckets of people start to form.

[09:18] You've got the people that buy every single new Stern Ely before they even see it.

[09:23] Like there is a good portion of people that just want to have it.

[09:26] And they're going to get the machine even before they see it.

[09:29] They don't care what the theme is.

[09:30] I would say about like 15% of Stern Ely buyers probably buy every single Stern Ely.

[09:37] I don't know if that number is accurate.

[09:38] We'll never be able to fact check that.

[09:40] Then you've got the people that just like fall into the hype.

[09:43] And that's the biggest bucket, right?

[09:45] This FOMO.

[09:46] Am I going to be able to get one?

[09:48] Do I have enough clout with my distributor?

[09:50] Am I on the list?

[09:51] Are they going to make enough of them?

[09:53] I don't want to miss out on day one.

[09:55] And the problem is now almost everybody.

[09:57] Almost everybody would be silly to not want to get an Ely machine

[10:02] seeing how much money these games are going for in the second hand market.

[10:07] Now there are going to be a thousand Godzilla Elys.

[10:10] And they are going to be over $10,000.

[10:13] I think these games are going to be like $10,700 for each one.

[10:19] But that's not going to do anything to slow down the FOMO and the purchasing hype

[10:24] that surrounds this game come Wednesday.

[10:26] People are still going to fight to get one.

[10:29] The game is going to sell out right away.

[10:31] It's already sold out.

[10:33] There are already more than 1,000 people on distributor lists who want this game.

[10:40] And that is incredible.

[10:42] And I think Stern is going to adjust these Ely numbers.

[10:44] They're not going to do a thousand rush Elys.

[10:47] There's no way they will do that.

[10:49] They understand basic marketing and they understand a few things.

[10:53] This is Godzilla.

[10:55] It's Keith L.W.N.

[10:57] And they know that Keith L.W.N. has the biggest following in Pimball right now.

[11:03] Within the Pimball community he is the new king of the kingdom.

[11:06] And so that is why they're upping the number.

[11:09] They would be silly not to because they are going to sell everyone and they're going

[11:12] to make so much more money.

[11:15] They are going to put another million dollars in the bank by doing absolutely nothing

[11:20] than making more.

[11:21] $1,000 more than the last Ely and $1,000 Elys.

[11:26] Isn't that a million bucks?

[11:28] And it's going to be great.

[11:28] I mean, it's going to be a great day.

[11:31] I think this machine is going to deliver.

[11:33] I think this machine is going to be a wow.

[11:35] I think this machine is going to have a lot of what we've been wanting for.

[11:39] When I hear the description that this is Ghostbusters meets Avengers.

[11:43] Now most people are not the biggest Avengers fans, but we all just want.

[11:47] We all want that world under glass like Ghostbusters, but we want it to shoot well.

[11:51] And I think this pin is going to be that.

[11:53] To me, the real interesting thing in Pimbal right now is not Godzilla and whether or

[11:57] not it sells.

[11:58] It's what are these other companies going to do as Stern continues to do what they're

[12:03] doing, right?

[12:04] Major theme.

[12:05] They're going to make 400 a week.

[12:07] How is American Pimbal going to launch Legends of Vahala after Godzilla?

[12:12] Is cactus Canyon remaking to be that interesting after we see Godzilla?

[12:17] We've heard more about Home Pins spinal tap and the more I hear about it, it's still

[12:21] going to have a basic orange DMD.

[12:24] And the code he said is going to be as basic as Thunderbirds code.

[12:28] And so when I hear that, I'm like, man, I don't think Mike's learned what people really

[12:33] want.

[12:34] I don't think you're going to see real integration with the screen.

[12:36] I don't think you're going to see a game that looks as good as these modern machines.

[12:41] And it's Home Pim people.

[12:42] These are the people that made Thunderbirds as much as I want to give these guys the benefit

[12:47] of the doubt.

[12:48] I think all of us know that when we see spinal tap in just a few weeks, it's going to be

[12:54] the ultimate shoulder shrug moment.

[12:57] What are you doing over there in Taiwan, Mike?

[13:00] Why are you bothering?

[13:02] Godzilla is about to stomp on this Taiwan-Nese Pimbal project when Stern reveals their

[13:08] game.

[13:09] Spooky was the one company that got it right.

[13:11] If they had weighed it too long to launch Halloween and Ultraman, I definitely think they

[13:17] wouldn't have sold as many as they did, especially Ultraman.

[13:21] I mean, 1700 and 50 games is still a decent amount of games for a company like Spooky because

[13:27] people know they're going to have to wait a long time.

[13:30] The Pimbal landscape is not going to go back to what it used to be.

[13:34] There is no room for original IP games anymore.

[13:38] And I really do mean that.

[13:39] I get that Scott Denise sold TNA, but if Scott Denise came out with TNA two day in this

[13:46] climate, it doesn't do that well.

[13:48] It probably wouldn't have sold very well.

[13:50] He had the advantage of taking that game around to shows, people got to play it without

[13:55] shows, without there being all these expos and without there being like a shortage of

[14:00] boutique games.

[14:01] I think Scott Denise's TNA would struggle significantly to sell in the modern marketplace.

[14:07] I don't even think it makes sense for Spooky to remake TNA.

[14:10] I really don't.

[14:11] I think if you want one, you can probably find one.

[14:14] Let's talk about Haggis Pimbal, all the people who preordered Fathom.

[14:18] Where's the game?

[14:19] Where's manufacturing?

[14:20] We're at the middle of September and all of those people locked in their money.

[14:25] Now don't forget, when people locked in their money on Fathom, they were told games were

[14:30] going to ship in July.

[14:32] I get there's COVID, I get there's delays, but I'm saying this is why Stern continues to

[14:38] win.

[14:39] They don't mess with people.

[14:41] They say, here's a game, if you want it, you can have it.

[14:45] I know they're backlogged, but whenever the new games come out, you best believe that

[14:49] every single Godzilla Ellie will be inside everyone's home, probably by Thanksgiving.

[14:57] And that's incredible.

[14:59] I mean, so look at this.

[15:00] This fall is going to be crazy, right?

[15:02] You got Haggis.

[15:03] You got American Pimbal.

[15:04] You got Spooky Pimbal.

[15:06] You got Stern Pimbal.

[15:07] You got Chicago Gaming Company.

[15:09] You got a new P3 multi-morphic game coming out.

[15:12] There are so many games coming out all on top of each other.

[15:16] But Stern's going to win.

[15:17] Stern always wins.

[15:18] And the reason they win is because they can manufacture.

[15:21] There is nobody out there in the Pimbal world that doesn't want to see Jersey Jack Pimbal

[15:26] release two games a year.

[15:28] We all want to see that.

[15:29] Everybody wants to see Jersey Jack Pimbal be able to launch multiple titles a year and

[15:35] make games.

[15:37] Which seems like we're never going to get that.

[15:39] Why is it taking so long to get these lines up and running over at JjP?

[15:44] Why is it taking so long for Haggis Pimbal?

[15:46] Why is it taking so long for CGC?

[15:49] All of these delays, all of these delays.

[15:52] But guess what?

[15:53] You know who's not the late?

[15:54] Spooky Pimbal.

[15:55] They're getting games out the door.

[15:57] How is this tiny little company in Benton, Wisconsin able to turn on a manufacturing line

[16:03] of 1700 and 50 games and everyone else is frozen but spooky, Stern and JjP?

[16:10] I mean Guns and Roses machines are still going out.

[16:13] Where are these games, gentlemen?

[16:15] Alright, so it's going to be a crazy Godzilla week.

[16:18] Now the other part that just doesn't stop in this Pimbal community is Pinflation.

[16:23] And Pinflation is real.

[16:25] And I saw this post by this guy that said, Stern's price increases are going to push me out

[16:30] of the hobby.

[16:31] And the person who wrote this has 30 pinball machines in his collection.

[16:36] So if you have 30 of something, if you have 30 Rolexes or 30 cars or 30 rare bottles

[16:44] of cognac, do you need 31 or 32?

[16:49] Talk about being a 1% tile problem.

[16:52] If you can afford 30 pinball machines, you can afford Stern pinball's $1,000 price increase.

[16:59] It's absolutely ridiculous.

[17:01] I go the other direction.

[17:02] My direction is this, Stern's price increases are going to keep me in pinball.

[17:07] It's going to make me more excited to follow pinball because it's so much fun doing a pinball

[17:12] podcast and looking at this marketplace and wondering where the ceiling is.

[17:17] I don't even think Stern's anywhere near the ceiling.

[17:20] And you have to look no further than pinside to realize that they have so much more room

[17:25] to go because they finally realize the category they're in.

[17:30] Unnecessary toy for rich men who have money to burn.

[17:34] I mean, that legitimately is the new inbox pinball market.

[17:39] The pros are for operators, but for everything else, these $8,500 to $13,000 games, these are

[17:47] unnecessary toys going to wealthy men who have money to burn.

[17:52] If you're not that, then I really think you should be investing your money in other

[17:56] areas, then pinball machines, go find a friend who has some games and play them and put

[18:01] your money in the stock market.

[18:02] Okay, so just for fun, just to show you how crazy the prices are.

[18:06] And it's stupid now.

[18:07] Like the pinball hobby five years ago, you used to be able to get a game on the second-hand

[18:11] market close to what it sold for new.

[18:14] And usually, almost every single game, there were just a few games that went up in price,

[18:19] but for the most part, almost every single game would lose about $500 to $1,000.

[18:27] And even games like Ghostbusters, Ellie, they would sell for less than they were new,

[18:32] because that's just the way it went.

[18:34] Used to buy an Ellie for like $8,000 and sell it for like $7,200 or $7,500.

[18:40] Now, I went on the pinside marketplace and I typed in because I just wanted to show

[18:44] you that pinflation is here and I would avoid it at all costs.

[18:50] It is more fun to watch these dumb deals go down than to partake in them.

[18:55] Now for some of you sellers out there, what a golden time it is to sell some of these

[19:00] machines for way more than you know they're worth.

[19:03] Then we know they're going to be worth in a few years.

[19:05] It's not going to last.

[19:06] We know that.

[19:07] These inflated prices will not last.

[19:09] So let's go down a list.

[19:10] Here's the crazy part.

[19:11] When I put in classified ads that were over $10,000, I had to up it because there were

[19:17] too many.

[19:18] There were like so many games for sale over $10,000.

[19:23] And I mean it's just a few years ago.

[19:25] There would only have been a handful of machines that you would find on the marketplace for over

[19:30] 10 grand.

[19:31] Let's go down a list of some of these right now.

[19:32] All right, are you ready for this?

[19:34] So Pired to the Caribbean, Collector's Edition, sale pending at $34,000.

[19:41] Willy Wonka Collector's Edition, $15,000.

[19:45] Another CE Willy Wonka, $14,000.

[19:48] A Guns and Roses CE, $17,000 or best offer.

[19:52] GNR CE's are tanking.

[19:55] They are tanking right now.

[19:56] And the reason why it's the play fields.

[19:58] A medieval man is elite.

[20:00] This is not even a royal edition.

[20:02] It has the royal upgrade, which is not that expensive.

[20:06] $13,500.

[20:07] Pired to the Caribbean, Ellie, $18,000.

[20:12] Another Pired to the other, $22,000.

[20:15] Ghostbusters, Ellie, sale pending, $15,000.

[20:19] A Guns and Roses CE, new in box, $25,000.

[20:24] That's a crack pipe price.

[20:25] Twilight Zone, restored, $13,888.

[20:30] Pired to the Caribbean, Ellie, $21,000.

[20:34] Indiana Jones, $16,000.

[20:38] Wizard of Oz Emerald City, $13,999.

[22:01] Good time to be in this hobby, right?

[22:03] Good time to be selling a Pimball Machine people want.

[22:06] These prices, most of them, are about 50 to 60% more

[22:11] than these games cost new.

[22:12] Some of them are three times what these games cost new.

[22:15] And the thing I don't understand about this inflation,

[22:19] and the way people have this emotional attachment

[22:21] to these games, I get if you go after something

[22:24] that you grew up with.

[22:26] I have an emotional appeal to things like 80s

[22:28] and 90s arcade games, because they remind me

[22:31] of my childhood.

[22:33] So when I see a fully restored Neo Geo

[22:36] or a Street Fighter II big blue,

[22:38] I really wanna have that because it reminds me

[22:40] of such an epic time in my life.

[22:42] What is a pirate to the Caribbean Collector's Edition

[22:45] do for anybody right now?

[22:47] Is it worth $38,000?

[22:50] You have to have it.

[22:51] When this game came out, barely anybody wanted it.

[22:55] We all got to play it.

[22:56] People jumped on this machine left and right.

[22:58] The only reason it's selling at these prices

[23:01] is because they're not making anymore.

[23:03] To me, I'm not even mad about the pirates.

[23:05] I get it. There's only 200 CE's.

[23:07] There's a thousand and that's it of this game.

[23:10] It's the Willy Wonka's that are almost more annoying.

[23:12] These games sat forever, forever.

[23:16] It's a musical.

[23:17] There's no musical in the game.

[23:20] And now all of a sudden, remember when there's a run

[23:23] on the one distributor who had like 35 in box?

[23:26] The moment people felt like they weren't gonna make anymore,

[23:29] that's it. Everybody ran to it.

[23:31] And it's fine.

[23:32] If you go in at these prices and you buy these games now

[23:35] and you pay this inflation price,

[23:37] I think you're gonna be left holding the bag

[23:39] because these prices are not gonna keep going up and up

[23:41] and up. They're not.

[23:42] And the reason why they're not and the good news is

[23:45] is because of games like Godzilla.

[23:47] Back to the future.

[23:48] Games like James Bond.

[23:50] Games like The Matrix.

[23:51] Games like Pulp Fiction.

[23:52] They're coming.

[23:54] So many good new games are going to come out

[23:56] and you're gonna have to sell games to get the new ones.

[24:00] You're gonna have to sell games to get Toy Story.

[24:02] It's not gonna go on forever like this.

[24:05] The reason why these games are selling so inflated

[24:08] is there is a shortage of new inbox games.

[24:12] There is a shortage of manufacturing happening.

[24:15] But once manufacturing turns back on

[24:18] and once all the assembly lines are going

[24:21] and we're getting like eight, nine, 10 new games a year

[24:24] which is going to happen,

[24:26] then who the hell is gonna look back and say,

[24:29] I want a wizard of Oz for $14,000?

[24:33] You could get a waz for $6,000 all day long.

[24:37] Now you want $14,000 for it

[24:39] because you put a like board in it.

[24:41] I don't think so.

[24:42] And the great news for all of you listening right now

[24:45] is you don't have to buy any of this stuff.

[24:46] I would wait for the new games.

[24:48] A lot of exciting games are coming

[24:50] and buying these secondhand games like this,

[24:52] it doesn't help anybody out.

[24:54] It doesn't help out the manufacturers.

[24:56] It doesn't help out the distributors.

[24:58] It doesn't do anything.

[25:00] The only thing this does, it empowers more and more people

[25:04] to be scalpers in this industry.

[25:06] It does.

[25:07] It empowers more and more people

[25:08] to gobble up every single new inbox game

[25:11] just to flip it right away like this.

[25:13] And that's what it empowers

[25:14] because they're like, wow,

[25:16] I'm not gonna sell this thing for 10 grand

[25:17] when people over here are getting 14 and 15

[25:20] and $38,000 for games.

[25:22] And the other problem now is like,

[25:24] Stern's seeing all this.

[25:25] So they make only 88 back to the future SLEs.

[25:29] They should charge 40 grand for them

[25:31] and they'd sell them.

[25:32] That's the scary part.

[25:34] If they only made 88 back to the future SLEs,

[25:37] they could charge $38,000.

[25:39] People want that game more than Pirates of the Caribbean.

[25:42] It's gonna get nuts.

[25:43] I'm not partaking in any of it.

[25:45] I'm buying Kylian a bunch of crypto.

[25:47] You hear him crying?

[25:48] I wanna call him crypto kill.

[25:49] He sees these prices.

[25:51] But I want him like 18 years from now,

[25:53] not to be like, hey, son, sorry.

[25:55] I didn't put money in anything good

[25:58] other than pinball machines for you.

[26:00] No, I wanted him to be like, my daddy bought Cardano

[26:03] when it was a buck instead of buying an $18,000

[26:08] prior to the Caribbean LE.

[26:10] And so of course he's gonna work

[26:12] and I'm gonna teach him to like make his own money.

[26:14] I just think it's getting to the point now

[26:16] where at these prices you have to look at these things

[26:18] like their investments and not just like pinball machines

[26:21] to enjoy.

[26:22] Everybody, this has been episode 612.

[26:25] Lots of conversation happening this week around Godzilla.

[26:28] I'll be back on the airwaves.

[26:29] I'm excited.

[26:30] I can't wait to see this game.

[26:31] I hope it lives up to the expectations.

[26:34] I hope Stern pinball makes a statement with this game.

[26:37] We shall see more to come.

[26:39] Have a great night later.

[26:41] Ah.

[26:42] He is.

[26:43] Ah.

[26:44] He is.

[26:45] He is.

[26:46] He is.

[26:47] Come with me.

[26:48] He is.

[26:49] He is.

[26:50] He is.

[26:51] He is.

[26:52] He is.

[26:53] Come with me.

[26:54] He is.

[26:55] He is.

[26:56] He is.

[26:57] He is.

[26:58] He is.

[26:59] He is.

[27:00] He is.
