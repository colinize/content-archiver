[00:00] He said the sun's gonna rise tomorrow, somewhere on the east side of sorrow.

[00:07] You better pack your bags, where stick out your chest and then hit the road.

[00:12] SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA

[00:16] Uh, welcome everybody to Canade, it's Bimbal Podcast, the only Bimbal Podcast that will not accept returns.

[00:23] After four years, eight months, have you seen what might be the most entertaining pin side thread of all time?

[00:32] And I've been on there for about 12 to 13 years, which is not a rich use of time.

[00:37] But there is a thread that you have to go check out about a pin side user named PinPilot,

[00:44] who tried to throw CPR playfields under the bus.

[00:48] We're gonna talk about it on this episode. We're gonna talk about Predator Pinball.

[00:52] There's now a shift date for this game, if you ordered it.

[00:56] We now know what the tariffs are coming from Netherlands, if you want your Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[01:03] We also heard from Chris Turner, who's come out of hiding to let people know when they can expect

[01:08] Merlin's arcade to start shipping to people.

[01:12] There's a debate about Jaws 50th, and might there be an accessory that will be unique to that game?

[01:20] There's some discussion around Harry Potter and JJP as there always is.

[01:26] And there is a spooky pinball, evil dead with Butter Cabinet, with a dust cover

[01:33] for the low price of $16,500.

[01:41] Are you all tired of it? Are you all fatigued by now of almost every single game that's good?

[01:50] Is now gonna cost us over $10,000? Games that aren't even yet good, like Predator,

[02:00] $15,000 to your door? Games like Merlin's arcade, close to $10,000 if you get everything included?

[02:12] What happened to pinball? You know, someone sent me a photo of that stern pinball,

[02:17] Casco edition of Star Wars. Have you seen it? Just looking down at it. If I was just a Casco

[02:25] shopper, I'm looking over there at iPhones and 77 inch TVs for like $1,500. Honey, look at that,

[02:34] a pinball machine. Oh yeah, look, it's next to arcade one ups. Oh yeah, let me see how much that

[02:40] thing is. It looks like it's about $1,500 to $2,000. Oh, it's $5,000. Does it look like a $5,000 item?

[02:49] And this is where we're at. I think everyone's just so damn price fatigued. It's the summertime.

[02:57] You're spending money on other things. You're looking down at that Ellie and you're saying,

[03:01] man, that could have been another vacation with the kids contemporary hotel a week in Disney.

[03:10] A week we will remember for the rest of our lives or another Ellie machine. I barely play

[03:17] because it's got a dust cover on it. You know, I'm going to sell a machine with a dust cover glued

[03:23] to the glass. I don't ever want you to play the game. Be a true collector. Let's seal that whole

[03:28] damn thing up so no dust can get into it. All right. So four years, eight months ago,

[03:36] Pin Pilot bought a playfield from CPR in Adams family playfield. And he was going to put it in

[03:46] a new project of his and he unboxed it and he saw down by the bottom of the artwork, the paint was

[03:54] all pulled up and it drove him crazy. And so crazy he had to go on pin side, which is always

[04:00] where you go, right? When you do when you want to deal with human beings and grown adults,

[04:04] you don't just go right to CPR. You got to start a public thread bashing a company

[04:12] with your side of the story only. That is how grown adults in the internet era do it.

[04:21] We start a public thread because we want to get a public mob going and we want to be angry

[04:29] and we want you to be angry with us and we think our collective anger will lead to a resolution.

[04:36] We don't handle it in private. We don't call up the company and we don't tell the full story.

[04:42] Now I'm happy for threads like this because threads like this, I think remind everybody

[04:48] that canade is not that bad. That sure I've made some mistakes. Sure I threw a drink once. Sure I've

[04:57] rambled and ranted after losing a meaningless award and I've always always returned with an apology

[05:06] or some sort of my behavior was inappropriate because every one of us is a little bit of a

[05:14] man-child at times. We all are at different times. Now some of us are worse than others.

[05:19] Some of us act more spoiled and entitled than others but when you get caught making a mistake

[05:24] and you get caught in a flat-out lie or you miss held information that was vital to the story

[05:33] and you get caught and no one's going to catch you better sometimes in a pin-side

[05:37] sleuths because you got to understand when you start a thread like this who you're dealing with

[05:44] these are grown men that wear cargo shorts many of which have over 10,000 posts on a pinball website.

[05:53] These are men who stare at the computer screen all day long. They have nothing better to do

[06:02] than be on pin-side every single day. So if you come into their house and make a claim about one

[06:10] of their companies or one of their products you better be damn sure that you have all of the

[06:17] evidence and all of the facts lined up because that cargo short out of shape wearing mob will

[06:24] come after you immediately. They will find every single meme and gift that's been shared on the

[06:31] internet over the last 25 years and they will use it to make you feel ashamed of your candy butt for

[06:40] coming in there and trying to flame a company without all the facts. So here's the story.

[06:45] This guy buys his playfield four years eight months ago opens it up it has issues. He says

[06:52] that CPR is terrible they're not honoring their products and he wants his money back

[06:58] and he did not inspect the product four years eight months ago when he bought it. So that was the

[07:04] first sort of debate should you open up a product and look at it within the return window the answer

[07:13] is yes but when that's all we knew about the story a lot of us had some empathy because who amongst

[07:20] us doesn't have a pinball part a pinball playfield maybe in a box that you've never opened up.

[07:27] I've got my replacement guns and roses gold playfield for the CE I've got it in a box since I

[07:34] bought it from JJP I did not open it I did not inspect it so I paid 500 bucks for it and let's

[07:42] say three to four years from now I go to replace my playfield with the new one and I open it up

[07:49] and there is a really bad paint mistake what would you do if you were in my shoes right I would be

[07:55] a little bit pissed off I'd be a little bit bummed out but I bet if I went to JJP in an adult way

[08:02] they would make it right they would do something I wouldn't go right to pin side to flame them okay

[08:09] so then this guy is like you know he's taking some arrows people are debating whether or not he

[08:15] should have opened it up but then everybody's waiting for the other side of the story what does

[08:22] CPR have to say about it because it really was a very bad painting mistake it should have been

[08:29] caught especially by CPR whose reputation is all about quality playfields the gold the silver

[08:36] you know they sell all sorts of playfields and so CPR finally chimes in with one of the biggest

[08:43] missing pieces of the story that this gentleman bought this playfield knowing two things knowing

[08:52] that it was a second hand playfield that it wasn't brand new put together by CPR and knowing

[08:59] that there was a defect on the playfield he knew this when he bought it and yet he left this

[09:07] information out and it's such an entertaining 14 pages of this back and forth you have to go

[09:18] check it out it's just fun sometimes to see the cargo short wearing mob like get their way and

[09:25] take somebody down and this pin pilot guy though he's still logging on I love that about pin side

[09:32] you can see the last time someone logged on and he's refusing to apologize for his mistake now

[09:42] in the grand scheme of things where someone just walked into a building yesterday this is where

[09:47] my dad worked for 38 years 345 park avenue my dad worked there I used to visit him in that building

[09:58] all the time he was on the 45th floor to see this guy walk into a building and just shoot people

[10:06] in midtown Manhattan my office is two blocks from there absolute insanity I don't know what this

[10:13] world is becoming but I'm very happy I'm out of the city talk about not a good day for the return

[10:20] to work thing that everyone's trying to get everybody to go back in go back in and watch these

[10:26] lunatics now look it can happen anywhere but I just want to say in the grand scheme of things

[10:30] happening in the world a defective pinball playfield feels like the dumbest thing to even talk about

[10:37] but shame on you pin pilot you gotta go back into that thread and just let everybody know you're

[10:44] sorry you're gonna take your pinball and you're gonna go home I don't think he'll ever recover

[10:51] you know only canada has nine lives they've come at me they've come at me pinball manufacturers

[10:56] trying to get me fired people got me kicked off of pin side people went after my merchandise and

[11:02] got that shut down I've got like maybe a couple lives left I don't know look in life if you make a

[11:08] mistake and you get caught just fess up move on and ask for forgiveness and in today's world I'll

[11:15] tell you this 95 percent of people will not forgive you and those 95 percent of people are probably

[11:25] religious and that's the irony in all of what happens in the modern world all right everybody

[11:31] what else is going on in pinball so I'm seeing that the jaws 50th owners are starting to speculate

[11:39] that they think there might be a special edition exclusive jaws 50th topper that's gonna somehow

[11:49] relate to the game they own will it celebrate the red white and blue more what will be on it will

[11:56] it have some sparkle I mean all they really got to do is have jaws 50th anniversary up there somewhere

[12:03] it's not going to stop anybody else from buying it who has another edition of jaws because every

[12:08] jaws is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year but we've never seen stern do this it would be

[12:15] unprecedented we got to stop this rumor there's some dude in pin side who keeps trying to say that

[12:22] they're only making 300 jaws 50th anniversary games just stop stop trying to feel like you've got the

[12:29] most exclusive elwin of all time because if they only made 300 jaws 50th that would be the most

[12:36] exclusive elwin ever one of the most exclusive ellies ever I think it would be the third most

[12:41] exclusive stern of all time because what it was at batman sle had 80 l virus sig had 199 and then

[12:50] this come on man they made 300 jaws is by Wednesday Wednesday when they started making this game

[12:58] there's no way they're only making 300 now they're also going to make them to the end of the year

[13:03] so Gomez said that so maybe the first batch was 300 they're going to see how they're going to sell

[13:09] but it's not limited to just that and do you really think that stern's not going to run another

[13:15] like couple hundred and just keep them in storage and then a few years from now you can just keep

[13:19] selling them because you made them in the year that you said you were going to make them now

[13:24] I don't think stern's going to make an exclusive topper here I just think this is not a good move

[13:29] I think they need to sort of stop trying to burn the le owners I feel like they've done a better job

[13:37] at that they've never re-released an le again or made a new le again since they said they would not

[13:43] they've made these anniversary editions they're not as nice as the le's but they're doing certain

[13:48] things now look the devil's advocate in me is like canada what are you talking about they just

[13:53] made an exclusive play field for the 50th anniversary game that's nicer than the play field in the le

[14:01] so what would stop them from making an exclusive topper we shall see I do know this the more I see

[14:09] of jaws 50th the more I like it I it's just wearing me down it's just got that red white and blue I

[14:15] don't know maybe it's everything with hulkamania going through my blood maybe it's the fact that

[14:20] it's summertime maybe I'm always seeing people have those popsicles with the red white and blue

[14:24] it kind of goes together I need to see one in person but if I were getting a jaws right now

[14:30] 100% I'm getting a jaws 50th and I'm keeping the armor red and I think it actually will look really

[14:38] good I should have a jaws I just spoke to a guy he has a really beautiful house in westport

[14:42] Connecticut and he's got a jaws premium and he's like look we live in a town where it's jaws

[14:48] appropriate and he's right we're on the water and shouldn't I have a jaws pinball machine

[14:54] shouldn't I get one if I make a video first or not I'm just joking I'm just joking I actually

[14:59] I actually think jaws is going to go down as one of the best turns of all time I've just

[15:03] look I've covered this hobby long enough to tell when a game has like long-term love and jaws has

[15:10] a lot of long-term love and it's simply because they did the assets right and that's my big worry

[15:16] about harry potter because harry potter to me is the opposite now look it's apples to oranges jaws

[15:22] was like one movie one iconic movie with some elements from the other movies peppered in

[15:29] harry potter like eight movies they had to work with eight how do you properly serve up eight films

[15:38] versus one it's almost impossible that's why people are like well they have to stack everything

[15:44] they have to do it that way because there'd be no way to serve up the movies if you played through

[15:50] it more linear and had more moments of pause with each movie now look I disagree what I think

[15:56] JJP should have done is kind of like what spooky did can you imagine this like harry potter has

[16:04] like eight different machines in one and I don't mean the shots are different but when you start a

[16:09] game you just pick which movie you want to play through and then you can have like a half hour

[16:17] game in that movie I know that's a lot more work a lot more coding but you know this is a once in a

[16:26] lifetime game a once in a lifetime opportunity to get this many assets from these many iconic films

[16:34] the other thing I think they possibly could have considered was why not make three pinball

[16:40] machines make the first three movies the second three movies and the final two over the next like

[16:46] three to four years I think people would have bought them I don't know like no one's ever taken that

[16:52] risk you take these iconic movies and you split them up star wars right we've been talking about

[17:00] that like wouldn't star wars be amazing if there was a dedicated pin for a new hope a dedicated pin

[17:08] for empire strikes back and a dedicated return of the jedi think about it the movies came out

[17:15] years apart we would accept the games coming out years apart but no one's done it it might be a

[17:23] licensor thing they might not want to do it that way so I don't know all the details but I do know

[17:30] cramming eight movies into Potter really difficult will harry potter have the long lasting appeal

[17:39] of games like jaws of games like godzilla and in this hobby you know us people long lasting

[17:47] appeal starts about a year after the game came out because if you're still enjoying it after a year

[17:54] you've gone past the honeymoon period and I think you're in that period where it's starting to feel

[17:59] like a keeper and I think that's what I love about pinball is you know we all get into the honeymoon

[18:04] phase and it's like in that six months right after you've logged about 800 games after you've seen

[18:11] maybe everything the game has to offer then's the moment that is the moment right it's like your

[18:16] wife it's like I feel like I've seen everything Brenda has to offer everything I know how she cooks

[18:22] I know how she sings I know how she works I know how she mothers I know how she drives I know how

[18:30] she dresses I know how she does something else that's inappropriate to tell all of you I know

[18:35] everything there is to know about Brenda right now and I'm so happy to report to each and every one

[18:41] of you she's a keeper she's not bolted to the floor because that sounds inhumane but you know what I

[18:47] mean that's like a pinball machine we all go through that period go to a show it's like having a few

[18:52] dates with the game I always love it when people play a game once and then run to pin side and say

[18:59] it's the best game ever like what are you talking about I mean that's just kind of like looking at

[19:03] a beautiful woman from across the street and saying you could spend the rest of your life with her

[19:08] now again speaking from experience I know what it's like to fall quickly and then realize oh

[19:14] none of our values line up nothing what I'm really looking for is there it's all surface level and a

[19:20] lot of pinball is that it can be very surface level this hobby realized many years ago if you just

[19:27] make a game beautiful you're gonna get some sales so speaking about game shipping we've got Alice's

[19:34] Adventures in Wonderland beautiful game we now know the tariffs are gonna be 15% not as bad as

[19:42] people thought still it's a 5% increase over what it usually was now who's gonna eat that cost it's

[19:51] gonna have to be you the buyer it's just the way the world is the distro is not gonna eat that cost

[19:57] Dutch pinball should not eat that cost this is it you want to buy a product from overseas now this

[20:04] is what it costs now it opens up an interesting debate because of that and that was not the price

[20:11] that you agreed to when you gave your deposit should you be allowed to get a refund now before

[20:19] the end of the year if you don't want to spend that much I think the answer is yes because here's

[20:26] what I think will happen there's not many of these games being made I think everybody who bought one

[20:32] has another 500 bucks I know it's not great but it's not that much it's not that bad I also think

[20:40] the early reviews on this game I'm just going off of what people are saying people I'm not

[20:44] chilling it people are loving it it's different it's beautiful it's different you know how I feel

[20:50] it's not a deep game it's a simple game but it's a stunning game and so that's why people bought it

[20:56] right nobody bought this game thinking it was going to be like super deep and was going to have

[21:01] like all this complexities and everybody saw it everybody got to see this game when they ordered

[21:06] it okay so I just think you're gonna have to pay a little bit more and also it's still going to take

[21:12] a while the way Trump is going with these tariffs every other week they change so who knows by the

[21:18] time your game is ready I think you're probably crossing your fingers it's just going to be 15

[21:25] we heard from pinball brothers they are now invoicing people for predator which means that the

[21:32] timeline is that predator is going to be on the line mid-august all right everyone's got to get

[21:38] out before star wars we also heard from chris turner merlin's arcade on the line end of august

[21:45] now these are two companies that go at different paces I am curious how many merlin's arcades sold

[21:52] I don't think many predators sold I think everyone's in a real wait and see period you're

[21:58] gonna want to wait to see star wars you're gonna want to wait to see what the price increases

[22:04] lots of speculation about what Steve richie's next game is gang it's so far away it's not even

[22:09] worth it all right a lot's gonna happen over the next six weeks let's stay in the here in the now

[22:14] for a little bit I know what it is I can't tell you people are like I'm a patreon subscriber

[22:19] and he's telling me what it not is well the reason I can't tell you is I gave my word to the people

[22:25] that told me and that's how I roll so I'm not gonna break my trust for five bucks I'm not gonna

[22:33] break my trust for a hundred dollars it's not worth it to me because like I said I like going to

[22:38] bed at night with peace of mind and I don't wake up in a good mood if I burn someone and I lied

[22:44] to somebody about my word all right just trust me you're gonna want it and get excited and it's

[22:51] not gonna be eight movies you're gonna have some speed baby and no it's not Ozzy Osbourne canada out

[23:15] me

[23:17] then let it go
