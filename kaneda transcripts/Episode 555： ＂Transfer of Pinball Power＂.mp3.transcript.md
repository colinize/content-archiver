[00:00] What doesn't kill you makes your soul a fandom in color

[00:04] Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[00:11] All right, let's do a little pinball podcast today

[00:15] It's episode 555 of Canada's pinball podcast. I'm your host, Canada

[00:20] A quick COVID update. I'm doing better. I got back my sense of taste and smell

[00:26] Which was a glorious moment when you lose something like taste and smell and you get it back

[00:32] You drink beer you eat barbecue and you have amazing meals lined up

[00:36] Which I've been doing all week now. I feel like I gained all the weight back immediately

[00:40] Okay, so what's been going on in the pinball world? Well not a ton of stuff

[00:45] We saw a stream last night. I want to talk about the agony and the ecstasy of opening up a guns and roses

[00:53] Collector's edition only to find out that it had been dropped during transit and the cabinet was cracked

[01:01] If you haven't seen this video

[01:03] It is the most painfully beautiful disasterously elegant video I've ever seen of an unboxing of a pinball machine

[01:12] And they even gave me a shout out we'll talk about that

[01:14] And then we're gonna talk about the pinball hall of fame and how it needs to raise money to open up over there in Las Vegas

[01:21] Before I do that I want to ask all of you out there because I'm going to do a separate podcast about your favorite themes that you would love to see turned into pinball machines

[01:31] I think a lot of people enjoyed the last episode of canators pinball podcasts when I shared with you

[01:37] 10 themes that I think would be amazing pinballed experiences and I told you why I thought each one would be great

[01:43] So I want to hear from you on what your favorite themes are and I will include Harry Potter

[01:49] So you don't have to waste a selection on that franchise. Okay. All right, so let's talk about where we are right now on a

[01:58] inauguration day in the pinball world as the world is focused on very important things and transitions of power

[02:04] What is happening in the pinball world? Are there any transitions of power going on some question?

[02:10] I've been thinking about was this do we feel that Jersey Jack pinball has really dented stern with guns and roses has stern

[02:18] felt that at all the success of guns and roses has it sort of given Jersey Jack more of the pinball market share

[02:27] They definitely got a ton of orders for gnr

[02:30] But their inability to make that game fast enough. I think won't make stern feel it very much

[02:37] Because stern will win with volume and efficiencies and I really wish Jersey Jack could get more games out the door

[02:46] Because I really want to get to the next game and so do you I know gnr was just revealed in October

[02:52] But I would love it if Jersey Jack could somehow find a way to at least release one game a year now

[03:00] If we think about it like that because Jersey Jack has never done one game a year

[03:04] And I mean one game revealed and shipped each year if we think about it like that

[03:09] Then we really shouldn't see toy story until sometime in the fall

[03:13] But for some reason I think most of us have started to expect new pinball is much more frequently

[03:20] Because stern pinball gives us a new machine every three to four months

[03:26] So we start to get antsy after like two months of a game reveal and we start to look around the corner and say what's next

[03:34] Does it not already feel like everyone is already looking past lead zeppelin?

[03:39] I don't think I've seen a stern launch in recent memory in which people have moved past it so quickly

[03:45] And I know a lot of you haven't played it

[03:47] I know that juries still out on whether or not it's a great machine or not

[03:51] I haven't played it yet

[03:52] So I'm not going to give you my assessment of like the game itself

[03:55] But just from how the community is responding to lead zeppelin

[03:59] It does feel like a game that is going to be quickly forgotten

[04:04] Because I almost think like it's already kind of forgotten by the community

[04:08] And there's nothing people are seeing in it that is really blowing people away

[04:12] Now I'm getting early reviews on the pro and here is what I'm hearing about lead zeppelin pro

[04:17] That that third flipper is pointless and it kind of breaks up the game in a bad way

[04:23] Now the third flipper has a purpose on the premium and the le

[04:27] Because it goes up that ramp and loops around

[04:29] It's got like a shot or two dedicated to that flipper

[04:33] But for some reason stern remove that from the pro

[04:36] And so you basically just have like a dead shot if you will

[04:39] And I think that's really starting to have a negative impact on people's gameplay of the pro

[04:44] Now I wouldn't even go near a lead zeppelin pro if you paid me simply because I do look at that game

[04:51] And it is the most hideous looking pinball package I've ever seen

[04:55] I understand that it's lead zeppelin's own artwork

[04:58] It looks like a loaf of wonder bread. I can't get over that

[05:03] I can't get over how hideous it is but did you see this this week stern is now offering the lighting option that is in the premium and the le

[05:12] You can add it to your pro for the bargain price of

[05:16] $450 for a strip of LEDs and some inner art decals

[05:23] $450

[05:26] Stern is learning very quickly that you can charge a lot for accessories

[05:32] I think the lead zeppelin topper is another

[05:35] $890 or $850 for that topper now look at that topper

[05:40] I don't even think it's interactive. I don't think it even does much other than light up for some reason in the pinball world

[05:47] People don't understand how cheap LED lights are they are probably some of the cheapest things you can put in a pinball machine

[05:55] We all got used to spending 200 plus bucks on pin stadium

[05:58] But you know how much a strip of LED lights costs

[06:02] 5 to 10 bucks

[06:04] I get you have to create an app and you have to make them programmable

[06:07] But man that is where the biggest profit margin lies now

[06:11] Would I get a stern lead zeppelin pro and add the light package to it?

[06:17] I don't think I would I think when you start to add up these accessories

[06:22] It makes more sense to just find a premium of the game because the premium to me is the way to go on lead zeppelin

[06:29] You get all the features you get the light show you get all the shots you're gonna want in the game

[06:34] And then you have a game that is not breaking the bank

[06:37] I do predict that lead zeppelin LEDs are not gonna go down as highly coveted machines

[06:44] We're starting to see people try to sell them for over 90 200

[06:48] There's a few on eBay for like 13 14,000

[06:51] I think you got to be bonkers to spend 5,000 over on this game right away

[06:55] I do think any year

[06:57] We are gonna see lead zeppelin LEDs trading hands for less than $9200

[07:03] But if you're a lead zeppelin fan and you have to have it

[07:06] I think that's really the only reason you would go in on a lead zeppelin

[07:10] Ellie, but again, I think we're looking past this game already

[07:14] So do you think lead zeppelin will have more momentum once more people jump on it or will this be another stern game

[07:21] That quickly gets forgotten like the monsters time will tell it's too early to tell yet

[07:28] But I do think stern releasing this rock and roll pinball machine right after guns and roses was the worst possible time to get people excited

[07:37] About a lead zeppelin pinball machine

[07:39] So I've got a few Jersey Jack pinball rumors and you have to take these with a grain of salt

[07:45] Then this is just stuff. I'm hearing through the grapevine and so canada is telling you

[07:50] It's a rumor so when you want to go on your shows now and complain that he's delivering a false narrative

[07:58] The definition of a rumor is that I don't know if this is true or not

[08:02] But I'm just hearing it through the grapevine and look it's more fun to talk about rumors and things were hearing in the grapevine right or wrong

[08:11] It's more fun to speculate on this stuff than it is to just let's just make sure we only cover stuff that is factually correct

[08:18] Because we all know that a pinball company will never factually guarantee anything that is of this nature

[08:26] Okay, so here's what I'm hearing over at Jersey Jack pinball

[08:29] So I was talking to someone who went over to Jersey Jack pinball and I heard a few things one thing

[08:36] I heard was that when they were talking about the next title the feeling over at Jersey Jack pinball is it is

[08:44] Incredible it is phenomenal wait until you see the next game now

[08:49] What do we expect them to say about their own products right? They're not gonna be like oh man like pat law

[08:54] They're really mailed it in on toy story

[08:56] So toy story is the next game and toy stories been worked on for years like people have forgotten this game was supposed to come out

[09:05] When the last toy story movie came out and they were still working on it

[09:10] And they had to put Wanka in front of it because Disney was not happy that the game was not ready

[09:16] So this game is another game in which Pat Lawler has had so much time to finesse this game and make this game magical

[09:24] Now I hope he learned a few things from Willy Wonka. I hope they don't butchered the assets in toy story

[09:32] I also hope they don't make this game too difficult to get into it and get deep into the game

[09:38] Those are the two things that really crush Willy Wonka for me is that the assets are put in a blender

[09:44] You know I've done enough shows about that, but also the game is just too hard

[09:48] You really can't get to most of the fun stuff that's in the game

[09:52] And I hope that they make toy story more approachable and give people more of what's to enjoy

[09:58] Earlier on in the gameplay experience you can't bury it all too deep and they've had no greater focus group

[10:05] Then looking at the response to guns and roses a game that immediately gives people satisfaction a game that has so many things to enjoy

[10:13] Again that has 21 songs they give you 21 different moments of pinball magic

[10:18] And so Lawler has seen the success of G&R and will guns and roses is success will that impact anything Pat Lawler does

[10:28] With his toy story game. I'm also curious. I really am. I'm curious if Pat Lawler is happy for the success of Eric Minier

[10:36] Or if he's a little bit jealous if he's jealous that this young gun

[10:40] Having just released only two titles in the world has two games that are so highly celebrated and highly coveted

[10:48] By the pinball world. I mean think about it Erick's games sold so quickly and they would have sold so many more pirates

[10:55] If they had continued to make it but dialed in barely sold at any rate

[11:01] It took dialed in almost two years to sell out of only like I think maybe 2000 made

[11:08] So Pat Lawler's comeback to pinball was a total flop on a lot of levels like it just the sales were not there

[11:16] But now he's got a licensed theme that people want will toy story knock it out of the park

[11:21] But when will we see toy story right if this is such a great game

[11:25] I don't think we're gonna see toy story like anytime soon because at the rate they're making games

[11:30] It makes no sense to reveal another game

[11:33] They've got at least 18 months to make guns and roses orders

[11:38] Jersey Jack pinball either needs to hire more people or they can't reveal toy story

[11:43] It's just gonna be a a bottle neck of getting games out the door

[11:48] Okay, what else am I hearing over at Jersey Jack pinball?

[11:51] So I'm also hearing this the person I spoke to is walking around jjp and what did they see?

[11:57] They saw a lot of parts for pirates of the Caribbean which led them to conclude

[12:02] I don't know if it's accurate or not that pirate to the Caribbean is possibly up for a rerun

[12:09] Now I would take this rumor with a grain of salt because I don't think seeing parts over at Jersey Jack pinball

[12:17] Is an indicator that they are gonna rerun this game anytime soon

[12:21] In fact, those are probably just parts that are there as spare parts for the games that are out in the world

[12:29] There are 1,000 pirates of the Caribbean out in the world

[12:33] I would assume that Jersey Jack pinball has spare parts

[12:37] For at least 50 to 100 of those games just backups of things

[12:42] But here's what I don't get is why won't Jersey Jack pinball make backup playfields for people to buy today

[12:50] If you go on eBay today, this is ridiculous

[12:52] There is a pirates of the Caribbean

[12:55] Collector's Edition playfield which you can't get anymore

[12:59] You can't go to Jersey Jack pinball in order one

[13:02] If you go to Mirko, Mirko sends you back to Jersey Jack pinball

[13:06] So guess how much somebody wants for a $1,000 playfield of pirate CE

[13:13] On eBay, it's being listed for like $5,000

[13:19] $5,000

[13:21] So someone out there wants to make five times what they paid

[13:25] Simply because Jersey Jack won't make anymore

[13:28] The same is true with all these toppers over at Stern

[13:30] Why don't they just make more Ghostbusters toppers

[13:33] Why can't they just make more KISS toppers

[13:36] Why are they making their own fans who bought into these games

[13:40] Pay five times over the price of stuff when they can simply rerun it

[13:45] At least manufacture another couple hundred Stern and give people a chance to get it at sticker

[13:49] And take away the scalper's ability to fleece your community

[13:53] But they're not doing it, they're not doing it

[13:56] So I don't think Pirates is coming back

[13:59] I don't think it's coming back anytime soon

[14:01] I think it would make sense down the road

[14:04] To rerun pirates as a vault edition like game

[14:08] I think if you made 500 pirates you could charge 15k per pirate

[14:14] And they would sell

[14:15] But the problem is with Jersey Jack is there's just no room in the lineup to put pirates back on the line

[14:21] You've got Toy Story next

[14:23] You've got all these guns and roses machines to make

[14:26] Where's the line that's going to build the pirates

[14:28] And also this company has fully shifted over to standard body games

[14:35] We are never going to see another wide body from Jersey Jack Pimble

[14:39] I think it is highly unlikely you ever see another wide body

[14:44] So I have a hard time believing that they're going to go back

[14:48] To the most complicated, most headache-inducing wide body game they've ever made

[14:52] Which is pirates, I have a hard time believing they want to go back to that nightmare

[14:57] It was a manufacturing nightmare for them

[15:00] And that's why they quickly moved on from it and said we're done

[15:04] And so I think the future of Jersey Jack Pimble is in front of them

[15:08] I don't think they're going to look to make revenue from yesterday's games

[15:12] I don't, I think pirates is done

[15:15] I think games are going to continue to sort in value

[15:18] I think if you really want one you're going to have to pay a lot for it

[15:21] But it's still the same pirates, if you didn't like it or you don't like the theme integration

[15:26] Or you don't like 22 characters and it's too deep and there's too many multi balls

[15:30] It's not going to be the game for everybody

[15:33] It's definitely not the greatest game of all time

[15:36] I've played pirates a bunch

[15:38] And something about it just doesn't click with me

[15:40] But that doesn't mean that some of you don't absolutely love it and swear by it

[15:45] And I'm happy that you enjoy it

[15:47] But I look for greater theme integration in my Pimble machines

[15:50] And I find so little theme integration in that game

[15:54] I do

[15:54] I think it's one of the strangest pens to me

[15:56] It's like so awesome on a pirate level

[16:00] But so poorly integrated as a pirate to the care being level

[16:03] So here's the other interesting rumor

[16:06] I'm hearing over at Jersey Jack Pimble

[16:08] So we know that Toy Story is next

[16:11] Then the big question is what is Eric Minier's next game

[16:16] Now the rumor I was hearing months ago was that he'd be working on Avatar

[16:20] The new movies coming out from Disney

[16:22] The next Avatar films from James Cameron

[16:24] And I don't know how I feel about that right

[16:27] Because A, we don't know if those movies are going to be any good

[16:30] They don't have any nostalgia to them

[16:32] Because they're going to be brand new

[16:33] And it's just not something that

[16:35] I don't know

[16:36] There's just something about Avatar that

[16:38] We already had an Avatar Pimble machine

[16:40] You could argue that we already had a Guns and Roses

[16:43] It reminds me of them going in on Hobbit so big

[16:45] Like what could go wrong with Peter Jackson making the Hobbit movies

[16:49] And then we all saw how horribly wrong those movies went

[16:53] And then that carried over into people's enthusiasm for the machines

[16:57] I also think it could be really difficult for them to get all the assets

[17:00] For the new Avatar movies

[17:02] Because there's like three more movies coming

[17:04] And there's no way this will incorporate all of those movies

[17:08] So I think Avatar would actually be a really bad franchise

[17:12] To hit at this point

[17:13] So here's what I'm hearing the rumors

[17:16] And this rumor at first might upset some of you

[17:19] But it starts to make total sense when you look at the sales success

[17:23] That they're just achieving now with guns and F and Roses

[17:26] I'm hearing that Eric Minier's next game might be

[17:29] Might be another music pin

[17:32] Now if you think about that

[17:34] Slash has said in interviews that he wants to do more Pimble

[17:38] Slash and Eric are talking all the time

[17:41] Slash can go get you almost anything you want

[17:44] Like he is the greatest connector between a Pimble company

[17:48] And famous people whether they're musicians or movie directors or actors

[17:53] You're telling me if you're a famous musician

[17:55] A director or a movie studio

[17:57] And your phone column is lit up

[18:00] And it's like online one we've got a Jody Dankberg from Stern Pimble

[18:04] Online two we've got David Thicks from American Pimble

[18:08] Online three we've got Roger Sharp

[18:11] And online four we've got Slash from guns and Roses would like to talk to you

[18:16] Which line are you picking up first

[18:18] And we saw what Slash can do with getting live and let die into the game for free

[18:23] For free

[18:25] Imagine if Slash called up Tim Burton if he's friends with Tim Burton

[18:28] Imagine if Slash called up the Red Hot Chili Peppers or the Beastie Boys

[18:32] Or Motley Crew

[18:33] And so it starts to make some sense this rumor that why wouldn't they

[18:38] If they've had such success with a music pin

[18:41] Why wouldn't they go back to that well and do this kind of treatment

[18:45] With another major act

[18:47] Now playing devil Zadvik kid my only concern is

[18:50] How would you bring another band to life as good as you brought guns and roses to life

[18:56] Like you couldn't just do another concert going experience right

[18:59] It would just feel very repetitive

[19:01] So what would you do how would you be able to approach another music pin

[19:06] And keep it fresh and keep it interesting

[19:08] And if I were Eric I wouldn't want to do another music pin right away

[19:12] I had just done one I would have spent two years doing something musically oriented

[19:17] I might want to dive into something more sci-fi

[19:20] You know I've done a pirate game

[19:22] I've done a rock and roll game

[19:24] How about we do something science fiction

[19:26] Or how about we do an action movie

[19:28] Right how about we do the Matrix with Eric Minier

[19:31] So if I were him creatively

[19:34] I would want to scratch a different kind of itch

[19:37] If I was trying to bring a world to life under glass

[19:40] So I hope it's not a music pin

[19:42] But that is one of the rumors I'm hearing that Eric's next game might be a music pin

[19:48] Now I do think Slash's presence at Jersey Jack Pimball

[19:51] Could open the door for some of the most incredible Pimball licenses and themes

[19:56] Because we know that Slash has more clout than Jersey Jack himself

[20:01] Remember it was Jack who's been going out and trying to get these licenses

[20:06] Slash will have a much easier time convincing people to do it

[20:11] And I think Slash wants to be a part of those projects

[20:14] That's the other exciting part

[20:16] It's not just like Slash is your like networker

[20:19] He's also emotionally invested in Pimball

[20:22] I can't underscore the importance of Jersey Jack having Slash in their corner

[20:28] What a strategic advantage they have versus the competition right now

[20:33] Alright let's talk about this Guns n' Roses unboxing that went live yesterday

[20:38] This was the most painful Pimball video I've ever seen

[20:41] Because it started out with such ecstasy

[20:45] And these gentlemen Joe is the owner

[20:47] They're unboxing this game

[20:49] Everything looks perfect for like 25 minutes or a half hour

[20:53] They're taking out the cardboard, they're putting the legs on

[20:56] They're showing us the rad cows

[20:58] They get the game into the game room

[21:00] And then they go to lift the play field

[21:03] And they're just mesmerized by the gold sparkle

[21:06] And then all of a sudden they're like what's this

[21:10] And they see the cabinet by the apron is cracked

[21:14] And the metal by the apron is bent

[21:16] And they realize that the game has been damaged

[21:19] And what a deflating moment that is

[21:23] You get your $12,500 collector's edition

[21:27] There's only 500 ever going to be made

[21:30] You're about to set it up and stream it for the world

[21:33] And you don't even want to turn it on

[21:35] You can't even turn it on

[21:37] Because now you have to report back to JjP

[21:40] And the shipping company that this thing was damaged

[21:43] And then they went and they explored the rest of the game

[21:46] And you could see it where the hinges are on the back box

[21:49] The wood was basically cracked

[21:50] You could see the wood was splintering

[21:52] And the black was exposing the white underneath it

[21:55] And it was not a pretty sight

[21:57] And so clearly this game was tipped over and fell hard

[22:02] Jjö was saying on the video

[22:04] When he looked at the box and it has the tip indicator

[22:07] If you have ever seen a Jersey Jack Pym on machine

[22:09] There's a tip indicator

[22:10] That if it fills up

[22:12] It means that this game was tipped over

[22:14] And he said that that indicator was telling him

[22:16] That the game had been flipped

[22:18] But he saw absolutely no damage to the box

[22:23] So how then was this game so damaged

[22:26] If the box was intact

[22:27] Well clearly it must have fallen hard

[22:30] On the pallet underneath the cardboard box

[22:33] And that force traveled through the game itself

[22:37] And caused it to break

[22:39] But it's crazy the way it's cracked in the front

[22:41] And the back

[22:43] So it almost feels like it was maybe jammed in

[22:46] And maybe twisted

[22:48] And there was just pressure on it

[22:49] As the truck was moving

[22:51] The way it's broken in so many areas

[22:54] So what happens next

[22:56] We will find out

[22:57] I am not sure I am assuming they are reaching out to Jjp

[23:01] There's really no solution here

[23:02] Other than the game goes back to Jersey Jack Pym ball

[23:05] And they've completely put a new cabinet

[23:07] And back box in the machine

[23:09] And then send the game back to him

[23:10] I think this is going to have to have a complete overhaul

[23:14] You would not want to like swap out the cabinet

[23:17] And the back box at home

[23:18] I think there's just too much work to be done here

[23:21] It's such a precious machine

[23:23] For me if I were Joe and that were my machine

[23:25] I would just I would have to send it back

[23:27] I wouldn't want to see it again

[23:29] Until it was brand new again

[23:31] And I think Jersey Jack will do the right thing

[23:33] I think the shipping company will take responsibility

[23:36] So no one's to blame here other than the shipping company

[23:38] Clearly dropped it

[23:39] I mean something happened

[23:40] It did not leave Jersey Jack like that

[23:42] So I hope Joe and his friends over there

[23:45] Get this thing settled

[23:46] It's painful to watch it again

[23:47] Because I watched it again

[23:48] Knowing the outcome

[23:50] And when you watch it

[23:50] Knowing what they're going to discover

[23:52] You're like man

[23:53] It's amazing how they miss it

[23:54] Like you can see it

[23:55] You can see the back box

[23:57] Splintering of the wood from the very beginning

[23:59] But man it's so painful knowing that

[24:01] They're about to see something

[24:02] You never want to see when you unbox a new unbox

[24:05] Now they did say in the video

[24:06] I give them credit

[24:07] They said hey nobody tell canada about this

[24:10] So it's nice to know we've made it into the pinball culture

[24:13] That when people have their most painful pinball moments

[24:16] I'm the first person that comes to mind

[24:18] So I want to thank you guys out there

[24:20] For thinking about me

[24:22] During your extreme moment of agony

[24:24] It's nice to know that I'm the first name that pops into their head

[24:27] Alright so speaking of agony

[24:29] Let's close this show with the pinball hall of fame

[24:32] Tim Arnold needs to raise some money

[24:35] To get the pinball hall of fame

[24:37] Off the ground he has to pay the contractors

[24:40] The remaining $200,000

[24:44] Or they might be in jeopardy of never opening up

[24:47] So first and foremost

[24:48] I know there's a lot of discussion around this

[24:50] I have never been to the pinball hall of fame

[24:53] And I'll explain why

[24:54] When I go to Vegas

[24:56] I go to Vegas the party

[24:57] I go to drink

[24:58] I go to have amazing food

[25:00] I go to see shows

[25:01] The last thing I want to spend my time doing

[25:03] When I'm in Las Vegas

[25:05] Is playing pinball

[25:06] I can play pinball so many other places

[25:09] Why would I pull away from a Vegas experience

[25:13] To go play pinball machines

[25:14] So there's that

[25:15] There's also no drinking in the pinball hall of fame

[25:18] So people out there that have suggested

[25:20] That Tim serve booze

[25:22] Get this

[25:23] People who are suggesting that it would be smarter for them to serve alcohol

[25:27] Are getting downvoted

[25:29] Downvoted

[25:30] I don't care if you want to downvote those people

[25:33] They're right

[25:34] Pinball without booze is no fun

[25:37] The reason why modern pinball in New York City

[25:40] Was such a sad place to go into

[25:42] Because they didn't serve any booze

[25:44] You literally walked in there

[25:46] And there was like no socialization

[25:48] There was no music

[25:49] There was no drinks

[25:50] There was nothing festive

[25:51] Like you didn't want to stay

[25:52] So I can't imagine being in Vegas

[25:55] With your friends

[25:56] Trying to party

[25:57] Guys let's go

[25:59] Let's pop by the pinball hall of fame first

[26:01] Before our big night out

[26:03] You can't order a drink

[26:05] What is that a crazy suggestion

[26:06] Especially when you're now on the vagus strip

[26:09] You're gonna have a pinball experience with no drinks

[26:12] So Tim has started a $200,000 go fund me

[26:17] That I think is around like

[26:18] They've got like $56,000 raised to this point

[26:22] So they've got some ways to go

[26:24] The other part that was kind of shocking to me was

[26:26] This thing is a $10 million building

[26:30] $10 million

[26:33] Why would you spend $10 million on a non-for-profit pinball museum

[26:39] I don't get how you do the math

[26:41] Where you're gonna make that money back

[26:43] He said since COVID hit that they've lost $500,000 on the old place in terms of revenue

[26:51] And so that's been about 10 months

[26:53] So I don't know maybe he's able to make close to like half a million or a million a year

[26:58] With the pinball museum

[26:59] And so this is a long term venture for them

[27:02] So I'm not gonna come on here and say that I know how to run an arcade business

[27:06] I know how to make it profitable

[27:07] If you want to donate to the pinball hall of fame that go fund me is up there

[27:11] I'll do my job to create awareness for it

[27:14] I do think $10 million on a pinball building is kind of crazy

[27:18] Maybe that's why there's also arcade games in there

[27:21] If it was like a museum of arcade machines

[27:24] You would get more traffic

[27:26] You would get more traffic

[27:27] I know you pinball people out there don't understand this

[27:29] But arcades are way more popular than pinball

[27:33] Now why not just have both?

[27:35] Why not make this amazing arcade?

[27:37] I mean even if you put in like Japanese candycabs

[27:40] And you had just like this humongous building

[27:43] That celebrated the finest in gaming history

[27:47] A museum of gaming would even be more of a smart thing to do

[27:51] But you know what again, I'm not gonna change his business model

[27:54] It is what it is

[27:56] And we'll see if he reaches the goal

[27:58] He they seem to be pretty damn short

[28:00] The other part is during COVID a lot of locations are suffering

[28:04] I saw Jack Barr had another fundraiser go up

[28:07] Or the go fund me again

[28:08] A lot of other places need money

[28:10] Need help to survive

[28:11] It's been a terrible terrible year

[28:13] I'm also going to interview an operator

[28:16] Who has some strong thoughts on all of this

[28:19] Because that's the other part that you gotta look at some of this stuff

[28:23] Like once you start a go fund me

[28:25] And you're asking for money

[28:27] Have you exhausted all areas of fundraising potential?

[28:32] There are people out there that are sitting on a lot of money in games

[28:36] And then they want you to sort of donate money

[28:39] Well maybe they should sell some of their inventory to raise the money

[28:42] If you need 50 grand and you've got games in storage

[28:47] I don't know, you know

[28:48] It starts to open up the debate

[28:50] Is like you shouldn't really donate

[28:53] Unless you've exhausted all fundraising areas

[28:57] And look but nobody makes anybody donate too

[29:00] I never get upset by someone asking for money

[29:03] Because if John a Jack Barr wants to do a fundraiser

[29:07] Or the Pimball Museum in Las Vegas wants to do a fundraiser

[29:10] Did I call it the Hall of Fame or the Museum?

[29:12] What did I call it the wrong thing?

[29:13] I'm sorry if I did

[29:14] But if anyone wants to start a fundraiser

[29:16] That's their prerogative

[29:18] You can decide whether or not you want to donate

[29:21] What I don't get is being angry at people trying to raise money

[29:26] Who cares? Just let them do their thing

[29:29] All you have to do is not donate if you don't believe in the cause

[29:33] And then you're done with your frustrations and your headaches

[29:35] Okay, I don't think people do it to personally upset other people

[29:39] They're just trying to stay in business

[29:41] Now it's going to be a rough year for Pimball operators

[29:44] It's going to be a rough year for Pimball shows

[29:47] I think 2021 is going to be a lot like 2020

[29:51] People are slowly getting the vaccine

[29:53] But it's not happening that fast

[29:55] I think people are really waiting for the Johnson and Johnson one

[29:58] That's only one shot

[29:59] So we're going to have to just mentally prepare for another year of this

[30:03] Another year of not seeing most of our Pimball friends

[30:06] Another year of not playing these new games on location

[30:09] As easily as we did before

[30:12] And it's a little bit of a bummer

[30:13] It is, it's a bummer of a year

[30:15] And I think it's going to be a little bit of a bummer of a next year

[30:18] I'm really looking forward to my new baby

[30:20] I'm looking forward to a new chapter in my life

[30:22] I'm looking forward to a lot of new things in my world

[30:25] And I will be totally transparent with all of you

[30:28] That Pimball to me is starting to take less and less of a priority

[30:33] Mainly because the prices are so stupidly high

[30:35] But primarily I just don't see much Pimball magic in these expensive games

[30:40] I don't, I see some games that blow me away like GNR

[30:43] But I just am tired of waiting for Chicago gaming company to come out with stuff

[30:49] I'm tired of all the excuses

[30:50] The Rick and Morty flippers are the reason why the game is not shooting great

[30:54] If you just adjust the flippers

[30:56] No, come on people

[30:57] There's a reason why companies have months and months and months of white wood testing

[31:02] I shouldn't have to open up a Rick and Morty

[31:04] And take out a ruler and a leveler

[31:06] And all these different gadgets

[31:08] And try to sort of manipulate the flipper angle

[31:11] And shave down the coil bushings until the game plays right

[31:14] I don't want to do that

[31:16] Okay, can't you just make a game that plays right out of the box

[31:20] I'm even seeing people with the Jersey Jack guns and roses thread

[31:24] The flippers are not aligned properly from the factory

[31:28] Why not?

[31:29] Why do I have to adjust the flipper angle out of the box

[31:33] Can't they just do that at the factory?

[31:36] I know, I know

[31:37] Canada doesn't want to lift the play field

[31:39] I don't, I want to spend 12-5 open it up and it just damn works

[31:43] Call me crazy people

[31:45] I don't like to bring out the soldering iron on week and one to my pinball machine

[31:50] And yes, I do know that you don't need a soldering iron to change the flippers

[31:54] So before you start that thread on pinside

[31:57] I'm just making an analogy

[32:00] Okay, everybody

[32:01] Anyway, everybody have a great week

[32:03] We'll be back with more shows

[32:06] It's middle of January

[32:07] It's a inauguration day

[32:09] There's a change of power in the world

[32:11] But there's not a change of power in the pinball world

[32:14] Stern pinball still dominates this thing by far

[32:17] If Jersey Jack can get their efficiency up

[32:20] If they can make more games a week

[32:22] I think JJP will dent Stern's market share

[32:25] But until then

[32:27] Until then Stern is just going to keep clobbering everybody

[32:30] With their overpriced accessories

[32:32] Have a great day everybody

[32:34] Doesn't give directions to others

[32:36] Stand and live apart

[32:38] Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[32:43] But now I'm alone
