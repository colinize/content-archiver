[00:00] What do you mean in the town there?

[00:02] How are you been everywhere?

[00:05] How are you been?

[00:06] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

[00:10] Alright, that was a little bit of guns and roses.

[00:13] The song was called State of Grace.

[00:15] I have no idea what Axel's talking about.

[00:18] But what I do know a thing or two about is that 450 people have locked themselves in and

[00:26] commit it to buying El Vira.

[00:29] one of the most expensive Pimbal machines that has ever been sold commercially and nobody.

[00:35] Nobody has even played the game or seen it played and yet everyone is committed to buying

[00:41] it.

[00:42] You know, sometimes I think the more we learn in this hobby, the more we forget.

[00:47] And nobody, nobody really cares once you give a theme they like and you limit the number

[00:52] of them how fast people jump into the water.

[00:56] And people jumped into the water this time without even fully knowing if the clear code

[01:01] issues, which are still being reported widespread throughout many different unboxings without

[01:07] knowing the solution is going to be in place.

[01:10] People have fully committed to Elvira.

[01:13] Now, here's a thing I hope for all of you out there who spent this much coin on the

[01:18] game that there are no issues.

[01:20] I of course hope that I hope we can put the clear code issue behind us.

[01:25] But yet to this day, we still have not heard official confirmation and we may never

[01:30] hear if there's, if there ever was a problem and we may never know what the solution is

[01:36] on this.

[01:37] But let's just hope and pray.

[01:39] I think it's more praying than hoping that when people open up a $15,000 stern machine

[01:46] that they don't see any pooling or any clear code issues because God help, God help us

[01:53] if people spend that much money and the games have issues.

[01:55] But I hope you guys really do see on Wednesday night a spectacular pinball experience.

[02:01] I really do.

[02:02] I'm looking forward to that stream by Jack Danger.

[02:04] He is going to flip Elvira for the first time on my birthday of no other days, September

[02:11] 25th.

[02:12] So Wednesday night, keep a lookout for that streaming video of Elvira.

[02:17] It's always awesome to see a game being flipped for the first time.

[02:20] I think some of the questions all of you have are going to be how far along is the code

[02:25] on the game.

[02:26] And we know this is a Lyman Sheets game.

[02:28] So we know it's funny with Lyman.

[02:31] We know the way it's going to end.

[02:32] It's going to end with an amazing pinball game.

[02:35] He is the greatest coder in the history of pinball without a doubt.

[02:40] So we know this game is going to be phenomenal in the end.

[02:44] Now the question is when will the end arrive?

[02:48] Because it's kind of crazy when you think about the fact that Batman 66 is still not finished.

[02:56] He's still working on that and he's starting this game.

[02:59] So I would say if we were sort of looking at how long it normally takes Lyman to finish

[03:05] this game, I wouldn't expect Elvira to be complete until at least a year from now,

[03:12] possibly two years from now.

[03:14] But I also know this in Lyman We Trust.

[03:18] For you gentlemen out there who are buying this game, I know that you probably have no

[03:22] problem waiting for Lyman to finish the game.

[03:26] And you also know what you're getting yourselves into when you buy this game when it's first

[03:31] released.

[03:32] Okay.

[03:33] I'm curious to see if anyone tries to flip a signature edition of this game.

[03:38] It's hard to flip a game that was $15,000 immediately.

[03:42] But I am hearing that when they sold out, distributors were being offered $17,000 for

[03:50] the games.

[03:51] Some distributors sold them for over $15,000.

[03:55] We are living in an insane upside down world right now in the pinball hobby and you don't

[04:01] even have to give much more to get more money out of these games.

[04:07] And you know, you heard on the last show, we broke it down.

[04:10] I think Stern's strategy is genius.

[04:13] If you're Stern, I do think the buyers are somewhat, if not, totally getting ripped off.

[04:20] But as I've said before, they will be happy because they can say they have one of only

[04:26] 50.

[04:27] That's all that it requires.

[04:29] One of only 50 games to sparkle.

[04:31] So let's see what happens Wednesday.

[04:33] Part of me is like laughing a little bit.

[04:35] If people see the game on Wednesday and it's a dud and it's not that great and these people

[04:39] have committed to so much money, we do know, we do know for a fact that Dennis Norman has

[04:44] chimed in and said that those are not the ramps that he put into the game.

[04:50] And Dennis is usually very creative with his ramp design.

[04:53] So Stern definitely cheapened out on the ramps of the game.

[04:57] And I know Dennis also said that the crypt area, they changed that as well to be I guess

[05:03] more reliable.

[05:05] Other than that, I think he also might have had drop targets in the game that got removed

[05:09] for stationary targets.

[05:12] And this is waged to debate on what's more fun, drop targets or regular targets.

[05:17] And some people are like, it's just really fun to see the target, get hit and fall down.

[05:21] I actually prefer drop targets for sure.

[05:24] I just think there's something satisfying about seeing that target hit and seeing the exact

[05:29] target you hit disappear.

[05:31] How is that not more fun and more magical than just having a row of targets that gets hit?

[05:38] And so look, we know why this stuff gets yanked out.

[05:41] It's for a few reasons, it's for cost and it's for reliability.

[05:45] I mean, nothing is cheaper than to put a big bank, one big target like in the monsters

[05:51] on each side of the game.

[05:53] How cheap is that compared to actually hitting drop targets?

[05:57] So, you know, look, we're going to see a lot on Wednesday and we will have more discussion

[06:01] about that on Wednesday.

[06:02] So let's start another rumor.

[06:05] And this is something I'm hearing and we've talked about this rumor before, but I wanted

[06:11] to just mention it on the show so that you guys out there can have it on your radar and

[06:17] say you might have heard it first at Canadian's pinball podcast.

[06:21] Now, it's great about spreading rumors like this is if I'm right, I'm the greatest,

[06:26] most informative pinball podcast on the planet.

[06:30] And if I'm wrong, it just reaffirms for people out there who think I spit nothing but

[06:35] lies and junk out into the pinball world, but you still listen anyway.

[06:39] Okay.

[06:40] So here's what I'm hearing and I'm hearing this from multiple sources and I don't have

[06:44] any confirmation that this is happening.

[06:46] I've talked to distributors who deal with this company as well have no confirmation.

[06:51] So I want you out there to take this news with a grain of salt with an iceberg size grain

[06:59] of salt.

[07:00] And here is the rumor I am hearing.

[07:03] I am hearing that a game is coming to expo that you're familiar with and that game is

[07:11] alien.

[07:12] I that is what I'm hearing that alien will be at expo and that it will be in a new cabinet

[07:18] and what we've been speculating for a while now might actually be shown at expo.

[07:25] Now look, you know me, we've been talking about how I said the big Lebowski would return

[07:31] it has.

[07:32] I've also been told that this game is coming back as well.

[07:36] The pinball brothers are still around, but from there the information gets very dicey

[07:41] and spotty and confirmation is really hard to come by.

[07:45] I don't have anyone who will confirm this.

[07:48] I just hear this in the rumor mill and people are telling me it's coming.

[07:52] There's no other signs to point to the validation of this rumor.

[07:57] So all we can do is wait and see if expo is when the pinball brothers return to the pinball

[08:05] landscape.

[08:06] But what I do know is they have not gone away and they are still working on pinball-related

[08:11] projects.

[08:12] They do also have the queen license as well.

[08:16] And I don't know what else they've been working on.

[08:19] But what do I think if alien pinball comes back in a new cabinet?

[08:23] Do I think it will sell?

[08:25] And the answer is yes, I do think it will sell.

[08:27] I think people who have played that game when it's working have really enjoyed it.

[08:33] I do think the highway pinball cabinet is hideous and I've never liked it.

[08:37] I think the music and the ambiance and the coding of the game and the way that game puts

[08:43] you into the alien world.

[08:46] People love.

[08:47] But it's one of those games that I think the majority of people who have played it have

[08:51] never really experienced it properly.

[08:54] It's always been broken at shows I've been to.

[08:58] And I don't think you can play alien in this really bright, loud, obnoxiously annoying

[09:04] pinball show.

[09:05] I think you have to play it in a home-use only environment to really get the effects of

[09:11] the light show and the creepy alien music.

[09:15] David, who did the music for this game, it's incredible.

[09:18] Theal, right?

[09:19] Is it teal or theal?

[09:20] I always get it wrong.

[09:22] I always have rear hero whispering in my ear how to pronounce it right.

[09:27] So do I think it'll sell well?

[09:28] Yeah, but here's the other thing that's just we can't avoid this.

[09:32] There's so many games coming out and if you throw this into the mix, how much are they

[09:37] going to charge?

[09:38] Are they looking at what big Lebowski's are going for and saying, hey, why don't we just

[09:42] make 500 aliens at 12, 5 and call it a day?

[09:46] The other thing I'm hearing is that because it's a new company, they are not going to make

[09:53] a hole, the people who lost money with highway pinball.

[09:57] Remember, they bankrupted highway pinball and they became a new entity.

[10:01] So they don't have any obligation to fulfill the people who got burned by highway.

[10:08] But we know how the story goes.

[10:10] If you don't fulfill those people who got burned, you will most likely create nothing

[10:16] but ill will towards your new venture and why start a new venture like that.

[10:21] All right?

[10:22] Okay.

[10:23] So speaking of bankrupt, though, have you heard that Sunco's pinball has declared bankruptcy,

[10:29] a move that nobody cares about in the pinball world?

[10:33] I mean, Sunco's pinball to me.

[10:35] It's sort of like, I don't even know the right metaphor.

[10:38] It's just a tree falling in the forest, right?

[10:41] Nobody has cared or followed or really been excited about anything that they've seen

[10:48] from Sunco's pinball.

[10:50] And it's not to knock them.

[10:52] But I think for you out there who loves pinball and wants to see exciting, magical, amazing

[10:59] new pinball machines brought into the world, there's nothing exciting, magical or very

[11:05] different about this game at all.

[11:08] It's too simple.

[11:09] It's too pedestrian.

[11:11] And at the price point, why would you buy this when you can buy a Stern Pro that is so

[11:17] much better?

[11:19] And I think being different just for difference's sake no longer has a place in pinball anymore.

[11:24] And I think they might have heard some of my shows from maybe like two years ago when

[11:28] I said all you have to do is look good and be limited.

[11:32] But we know that's not the case, right?

[11:35] Nobody wakes up and says I really want a pinball game that has to do with a carnival in outer

[11:40] space.

[11:41] I don't even know where they got this theme from.

[11:45] But there's never been any real appeal to the game itself.

[11:50] And so now the rumors that they were laying people off and they had some financial hard

[11:54] times are obviously true.

[11:57] But again, it's just like it's just a thing I don't think anybody really cares about.

[12:01] It's so much exciting stuff happening at Jersey Jack and Stern pinball and Chicago gaming

[12:07] and spooky pinball.

[12:10] Why would you care?

[12:12] Why would you care to see where this company ends up?

[12:15] And I do find it funny that they're declaring bankruptcy to financially get themselves in

[12:22] a position where they can make more games.

[12:24] And I don't know.

[12:26] If you want to lose money in this world, the fastest way to lose money in this world is

[12:29] to start a pinball company without a plan.

[12:33] And why would they even bother going down this road and investing all this time, money,

[12:38] and energy if their first game was going to be a flop?

[12:42] You can't do it, right?

[12:44] You can't break into a category with a failure and expect to keep going unless you have

[12:51] a lot of investor capital.

[12:54] But if you look at their first offering, who's going to like look at this and say, we

[12:57] need to keep these guys going?

[12:59] Right, it'd be different if it was Dutch pinball because I'd be blown away by the game and

[13:04] said, hey, like, let's get this game out because imagine what game two could be from Dutch

[13:09] pinball.

[13:10] This is what game one is, but no, no such case with suncoast pinball.

[13:14] So I think we wish them well as they sort of ride off into the sunset of bankruptcy and

[13:19] try to financially get themselves on solid ground again.

[13:23] But I don't think anyone's holding their breath to see what game number two and three is

[13:27] from suncoast pinball.

[13:28] All right.

[13:30] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[13:32] So deep root has spoken and deep root has made an official announcement about what we can

[13:38] expect from them at Houston's like arcade expo in November.

[13:43] Now look, we've sort of danced around deep root.

[13:46] We talk about them every once in a blue moon because they're not very active.

[13:51] They don't talk a lot.

[13:53] They don't say anything anymore, but they've said enough, right?

[13:57] They've said a lot about what they were going to do in the pinball world in 2019 and none

[14:02] of it, none of it has happened.

[14:05] And yet nobody really can be that upset with them because they didn't take anybody's

[14:10] money.

[14:11] So they do get a little bit of immunity from the pinball community, right?

[14:15] But they're also, I don't, I understand that part of it, but I also think on some level,

[14:21] we do need to hold them a little bit accountable for what they said they were going to do.

[14:27] From just a pure confidence level in the company.

[14:31] And because none of it has happened, not one game let alone more games, not one sort of

[14:36] mechanism that's blown us away, not one sort of anything other than an animated video

[14:42] of Raza have we seen.

[14:44] I don't think anyone anymore is like that is extremely interested anymore.

[14:51] And I'll tell you why I think this is the way.

[14:53] I think a lot of people were waiting.

[14:55] And we're hoping that this company would deliver something and give them an option in 2019.

[15:03] And now that none of that's happened, I think people are just like it's, it's just like

[15:08] they're disappointed that that these guys came out and made so many big statements and

[15:13] then nothing materialized.

[15:15] But here's what they said, as of like a day or two ago, they said in response to inquiries,

[15:21] we would like to expound upon our prior statement.

[15:26] At a minimum, several Raza prototypes will be available to play at the Houston Arcade Expo.

[15:33] Two early prototypes of retroatomic zombie adventure land will be at the Houston Arcade

[15:39] Expo on November 15th through the 16th.

[15:43] Okay, so that's good news.

[15:44] You get to see something.

[15:45] Let's say these prototypes will not have final art, design or code.

[15:52] Our primary goal is to collect real world data.

[15:57] Let's see, there will be a minimal, deep root staff presence only to monitor data and

[16:03] performance of the machine components.

[16:06] We expect to complete engineering and launch early next year.

[16:10] A press release and media qualification form will be forthcoming.

[16:16] We also plan to release a teaser for our second title prior to the Houston Arcade Expo

[16:24] show.

[16:25] This teaser will showcase a level of cinematic animation never before seen with Pimbal

[16:32] courtesy of deep root studios.

[16:35] Other Pimbal manufacturers interested in licensing the deep root package of innovations or

[16:42] intending on attending the launch should email us for more information.

[16:49] And then there's some note here about like becoming a distributor as well.

[16:53] Here, I don't get that line.

[16:56] Other Pimbal manufacturers interested in licensing the deep root package of innovations.

[17:03] So what does that mean?

[17:04] They're making mechanisms that they will license to other companies.

[17:09] I don't understand.

[17:11] That was never the point of this company was it to license out their innovations or their

[17:17] IP.

[17:19] Maybe we're going to see the way they implement the screen in the game.

[17:22] And maybe we're going to see the way they implement different magnets and mechanisms.

[17:27] And I don't know, maybe different kind of play field technology.

[17:30] Wouldn't that be something that they could license out?

[17:33] But why would they?

[17:35] Wasn't the whole purpose of this company to compete and to raise the bar in Pimbal.

[17:42] And right now it's sounding like they're trying to do way too much.

[17:47] And nobody really plays Pimbal to see never before seen animations.

[17:54] And this whole notion of what's on the screen matters I think is ridiculous.

[18:00] Pimbal is physical.

[18:01] It's below the glass.

[18:03] If you want to start bragging though about animations in a Pimbal machine, great.

[18:08] I can go look at the animations and graphics on modern video games, which will blow away

[18:15] anything that deep root makes.

[18:18] And the bar for animations in Pimbal is so damn low right now.

[18:23] But why are we talking about this stuff?

[18:27] Where are the games?

[18:29] Like where are the games?

[18:31] And so I did ask Robert about Magic Girl and Magic Girl is, he said it might be 2021.

[18:37] That's what he said to me that they're going to be arranging, you know, developing the

[18:41] game throughout next year.

[18:43] And it's around 2021 is when we might see Magic Girl.

[18:47] And so how many years is that right?

[18:49] Haven't they been working on Magic Girl for over a year, maybe longer?

[18:53] So three years to fix John Papaduke's seven, eight year in the making Opus game.

[18:58] I heard with Magic Girl that something like 80% of the layout is the same, but only 25%

[19:06] of the characters and the code will be the same.

[19:08] I think Bren is telling me it's dinner time.

[19:10] So we're going to wrap this show up in a little bit.

[19:13] All right.

[19:14] So here's the thing.

[19:15] I think that means Magic Girl will not have the zombie Yeti art package.

[19:19] And I think it's going to go down a completely different road.

[19:22] But does that sound crazy to you that no Magic Girl until 2021?

[19:28] Like where's the pinball market going to be in 2021?

[19:31] My fear is if recession hits and there's so many games out and people are going to

[19:39] hit pause on buying pinball machines that Robert might have just missed the best timing

[19:46] to bring these games to market.

[19:48] But the real question I have and I guess time will just tell is what happened?

[19:54] What happened a year ago at Expo when they were so boldly confident about what they were

[20:00] going to do to the pinball world?

[20:02] It's almost a year later.

[20:04] What has happened that has made it so hard for them to put a machine in a box?

[20:10] What has happened that's made it so hard for them just to finish John Papaduke's game

[20:14] which John had been working on for years?

[20:17] So what where's all the money going?

[20:20] Where's all the tinkering going?

[20:22] Why are we being told that pinball companies can license this technology?

[20:27] I don't understand.

[20:28] It's sounding more and more a lot like P3 multi-morphics approach to a new pinball platform.

[20:36] And I don't that's never proven to be successful because Stern doesn't want anything from anyone

[20:41] else.

[20:42] Jersey Jack doesn't want anything from anyone else.

[20:45] These companies are just making games and they're making games to the best of their ability.

[20:50] And last time I checked they're putting games in boxes and people are buying them and

[20:56] that's what pinball should be.

[20:58] Not these promises that never come to fruition.

[21:03] So look and I think every month they wait and every six months or a year later the pressure

[21:09] mounts on them to have something that is going to be worth it.

[21:14] If you tell someone like we're going to revolutionize pinball and do yada yada yada, the pressure

[21:21] increases and the hype rarely do the actual products deliver on the hype.

[21:28] Starting to feel a little bit like this is the Chinese democracy of the pinball world

[21:32] where every year it's like we're close but we're not right there yet.

[21:36] So we'll see.

[21:37] I just want to see something from Deeproot.

[21:39] I mean I know Robert listens to the show.

[21:41] I know he has a very talented team over there.

[21:43] I just want to see something.

[21:45] I want to see something.

[21:46] I don't want to see white woods.

[21:48] I don't want to see bits and pieces that they're collecting data on.

[21:50] I'm really curious to see what they actually wheel out that they're collecting data on.

[21:55] But anyway, it is what it is.

[21:58] All right.

[21:59] Brennan made a nice prototype.

[22:00] I know for you listener of the show, I know you don't want to have it cut short but I'm

[22:03] going to give you just a few more minutes than I got to go eat dinner with my beautiful

[22:05] wife.

[22:06] So what else is going on in the pinball world?

[22:09] Okay.

[22:10] Let's see.

[22:11] The monsters.

[22:12] The monsters, toppers don't seem to be working very well.

[22:16] So if you have a monster and you ordered a topper, you might have issues with it.

[22:20] I was in the monsters thread and people are like, well, you know, this game's great.

[22:24] Why aren't people loving it?

[22:26] And I do think that the monster is unfortunately is going to always be compared to Batman 66.

[22:34] And unless you get more of the show into the game, I do think people are going to write

[22:40] off the monsters as a little bit of a miss, a game in which the fun elements of the show

[22:46] aren't coming through enough in the coding of the game.

[22:50] All right.

[22:51] Something I haven't talked about and this is something that I think is just interesting

[22:54] is that Jersey Jack pinball, he is making more Ruby red edition Wizard of Oz games.

[23:01] I, why?

[23:02] Right?

[23:03] I was just trying to understand why.

[23:05] And I think if you were to ask me, I think the reason Jack is running more Ruby red edition

[23:10] Wizard of Oz games, I think it's to probably pay for all of the free play fields he's had

[23:16] to give out.

[23:18] And so let's rerun more wazas.

[23:20] Now the question I don't understand is why do we need more Ruby red edition Wizard of

[23:25] Oz games when you can go find those games now in mint condition, home use only, readily

[23:32] available for sale.

[23:33] I see Wizard of Oz games all the time available for $7,500 and they were originally $9,000.

[23:41] So is there really a market demand for more Ruby red games?

[23:46] It is also funny that Jack did sell us all on the yellow brick road edition and how they

[23:53] remove the monkey mech and how that's, it's the better version of the game.

[23:58] And now he's going back to making more Ruby red editions with the monkey mech in it.

[24:04] The little bit of like, well, which one is it?

[24:07] And you know, Jersey Jack, to me, they need to get to a point where they just can't always

[24:12] fall back on Wizard of Oz.

[24:14] It's like the one game whenever they need to raise capital, it's just like, well, just

[24:19] make more wazas.

[24:21] And that's, it's great, but it's also bad if you own a Wizard of Oz for resale value

[24:25] because there are so many of these things out in the marketplace.

[24:29] None of them feel limited.

[24:31] None of them feel special.

[24:33] I mean, they got close to it.

[24:35] The yellow brick road edition, if it had all the working mechs in it, I think that would

[24:39] have been, you know, the one that ultimately people collect it.

[24:43] But again, there's just everywhere I look, there's Wizard of Oz is out there all over

[24:47] eBay on sale.

[24:48] This and that.

[24:49] There's so many I get lost and confused on like, which one is the one that's actually

[24:54] the one to get?

[24:56] Okay.

[24:57] So, you know, speaking of Jersey Jack, when are we going to see the collector's edition?

[25:00] I think Jack is, he might be running out of time.

[25:03] It's crazy to me that Ruby Red editions are on the line, but the collector's editions

[25:08] are not.

[25:09] Now, some people are speculating that he wants to run Wizard of Oz to prove that they

[25:14] can, you know, they can have no play field issues.

[25:18] And they'll be bulletproof.

[25:20] But I would argue that I think those play fields for those Ruby Red edition that he's

[25:25] running now have been in the factory for a really long time.

[25:30] So I don't know.

[25:31] I don't know.

[25:32] We have to, we have to wait and see.

[25:34] See, I'm going to close on this note.

[25:37] I do think it's kind of crazy that until we all waited to see if these problems would

[25:43] be solved, I mean, I'm still seeing Jurassic Park's chip at a box and it's in the threads.

[25:49] Until we see that this problem has been solved, people are still buying.

[25:53] People are still making games.

[25:55] People are still committing to paying extreme prices for toys that might be defective.

[26:02] And I don't know why there's so much impatience in this hobby.

[26:07] Everything comes up for sale.

[26:09] Everything you can get if you just wait.

[26:11] I don't understand when everyone has to run to it immediately and gobble them all up

[26:16] before they know the product is going to be quality.

[26:20] Before they even know what the game is and he good, before they've even seen the game

[26:23] played, Elvira sells out like that.

[26:26] We've seen it before.

[26:28] We'll see it again.

[26:29] Nothing will change.

[26:30] There's no way to change the way people in this hobby are.

[26:34] The sad thing is because of that behavior, companies will make lazy decisions.

[26:41] Companies will make cheap decisions.

[26:43] I'm coming right now.

[26:44] She's at the door.

[26:45] Companies will make cheap decisions.

[26:46] Ultimately, if you want to see the games get better, you should demand more for the money.

[26:53] And I'm sorry, but Elvira's signature edition is just case in point of why would Stern

[27:00] ever give more now after they saw what you did with that game.

[27:06] You basically spent $5,000 more for nothing.

[27:10] For absolutely nothing.

[27:11] It's unbelievable.

[27:12] Why should they try harder?

[27:14] I almost feel bad for Jack because he's trying so damn hard.

[27:18] They are trying to put so much more into these games.

[27:22] And yet he's going to struggle to sell the collector's editions of Willy Wonka, which

[27:26] will have much more effort into it than signature edition Elvira.

[27:31] And I don't know.

[27:32] It's just sad.

[27:33] It just does go to show how you have to make the right marketing move at the right time.

[27:40] It doesn't matter if your product is better because you might have just missed the

[27:45] window of opportunity.

[27:47] I'll close this podcast by saying, I am no longer getting the pie to the Caribbean

[27:52] collectors edition to kind of a funny story.

[27:54] I won't even go into it.

[27:56] But I had the deposit in.

[27:58] The game found another owner.

[28:00] I got my deposit back.

[28:02] I also, for those of you who saw me put up my big Lebowski on eBay, I'm still not flipping

[28:08] it for a profit.

[28:09] I just wanted to see what offers people were giving on the game as little market research

[28:14] to see what the current market value is.

[28:16] And I'm going to say this.

[28:18] The market is softened because of Barry's promise to build more, not shocked by that.

[28:23] I also will believe it when I see it, that Barry can actually make more of these games.

[28:29] But until then, I still think the best big Lebowski to have is one in a box in America that

[28:35] you could go get tomorrow.

[28:37] And I think there's going to be more value in a game like that than the promise of him

[28:42] being able to get production going again.

[28:45] All right.
