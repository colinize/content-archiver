[00:00] You hear me now? Good.

[00:04] That's the worst of times.

[00:08] It's the gift and the curse.

[00:10] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canadian. Spooky Pinball is evil dead.

[00:29] You are probably watching the trailer right now. I watched it last night. I've been absorbing it.

[00:35] I've been thinking about this game and I want to give you my first impressions of Spooky Pinballs.

[00:41] If Carrie Hardy is right, it is their Godzilla. Do I think this game is as good as Godzilla?

[00:46] No, I never would have said that. But here's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about what I like about this game.

[00:52] I want to talk about some things I might have done a little bit different.

[00:56] And I also just want to zoom out a little bit. I want to talk about how I feel this game is going to do in the current

[01:03] Pinball landscape. I mean, nothing is cheap.

[01:07] But this game is less than $10,000 by like five bucks. There's only going to be one version of the game, a collector's edition.

[01:17] And there's also going to be this crazy cool topper. Maybe one of the coolest toppers ever for 1300 bucks.

[01:25] But here's my overall take looking at this game. First and foremost, Christopher Franchi just crushed it.

[01:31] Like he is the greatest acquisition that I've seen in the last few years. The fact that he's going to make all these spooky games

[01:38] look this good. I mean it when I say it. He's been in pinball now

[01:43] long enough to know how to make these games look so damn good. But man, these games are so damn expensive. So, you know, is it enough?

[01:52] And here's my overall take on this game. First and foremost, yes, there's a lot of stuff in this game. I'm so happy to see toys.

[02:00] I'm so happy to see drop targets. I'm happy to see things you actually bash with the ball.

[02:06] I'm happy to see magnets, lower playfields. We're seeing like unique never been done before stuff.

[02:13] Let's go over some of the stuff I really like. Okay, so I really, really like the art package. I love the topper.

[02:20] I love the fact that they got super creative. I love that double barrel shotgun shooter lane.

[02:26] I love the level of creativity that led to that. Like what a really smart and clever thing to do.

[02:35] I've never seen a pinball machine do anything like that before.

[02:39] I love the fact that there are guns in this game. If you're a John Wick owner,

[02:44] you're seeing more guns being loaded in Evil Dead than you will ever see in John Wick.

[02:51] I love the fact that this game has stuff that is more than meets the eye.

[02:55] And what I mean by that is that there's hidden surprises in this game.

[03:00] That there are things that pop up from underneath the playfield. You got two heads that pop up.

[03:05] Allah, medieval madness. You've also got the floor that opens up. It looks like straight up the middle.

[03:10] You've also got that right ramp. It looks like that also opens up that lets the ball either pass through or go up the ramp.

[03:17] So there's a lot of dynamic physical motion happening in this game. There's a lot of physical things

[03:24] that the ball is interacting with that looks like a lot of fun. And that's what pinballs should be.

[03:31] I love the hand on the left side of the game that moves back and forth and you have to hit it.

[03:36] It looks like you shoot it with the shotgun. I really like that.

[03:40] I love the attention to detail on all the artwork by Christopher Franchi.

[03:45] But I also love the attention to detail on stuff like the shotgun cartridges.

[03:51] If you look at the back of them, it says spooky pinball on them. I love stuff like that.

[03:57] A lot of really fun creativity went into this game and you can see it when you look at the game.

[04:04] I also just love the colors. There's something about the colors that Franchi used on this game.

[04:09] It's got that aqua mixed in with some purples and blues. It's just very colorful.

[04:15] It's very inviting. When you look at the full cabinet with the artwork and the topper,

[04:20] it looks just so damn cool. It looks like a really cool pinball machine. It almost looks like timeless.

[04:27] Like this thing just feels like something you would see at a drive-in movie theater

[04:32] where zombies are about to take over the planet and the lights are flickering and you look over

[04:37] to the arcade section of the movie theater and there's this evil dead game coming to life.

[04:42] You've got the topper going up and down. By the way, that $1,300 topper.

[04:47] The best thing to happen for spooky pinball was stern to release a $1,000 metallica topper

[04:54] that looks like mailed in crap. For just $300 more, you're going to get one of the coolest

[05:00] toppers ever where it actually looks like the character is coming out from the back box

[05:05] and coming towards you. What an awesome idea. It looks absolutely incredible.

[05:11] I love the fact that there's even like a lower play field in this game.

[05:14] It looks like a lot more fun than the lower play fields in Avatar.

[05:18] One of my favorite things in this game is the tape recorder on the apron.

[05:22] It's a physical tape recorder that spins that syncs up with the movie.

[05:28] And we know that this game is going to have an overload of evil dead clips and scenes.

[05:33] And they're going to have Bruce Campbell do the call outs.

[05:36] Now, I know he does the call outs in the movie in a very monochromatic way.

[05:41] I hope that's exciting because when I was listening to the trailer,

[05:44] I did feel like, oh man, like that doesn't really get you going.

[05:49] And maybe you have to direct actors to be a little bit more animated or a lot more animated

[05:55] when they're making a pinball machine. The same thing happened with Alice Cooper's

[05:58] Nightmare Castle. When Alice Cooper did the call outs, they were boring.

[06:03] So I'm a little bit worried that these Bruce Campbell call outs

[06:06] are really monochromatic and very boring. And he's delivering some funny lines,

[06:12] but he's not delivering them with any real energy or any real sarcasm.

[06:18] And again, I think that's where you need to direct him to be different than he was in the film.

[06:24] I get that he might have acted that way in the film, but he's now not making a film.

[06:30] He's now making a pinball experience. So you've got to make it more funny,

[06:35] more sarcastic and more campy. I'm a little bit surprised that there's no book of the dead

[06:40] in this game though. I was looking at all the mechs. I'm like, where's the book of the dead?

[06:43] You know, with the eye that opens up, I don't see that anywhere here.

[06:47] But look, this game is loaded. Like this game is loaded. There's way more in this game than is in

[06:53] Avatar. I think a lot of people are going to make those comparisons that, you know,

[06:58] why doesn't Jersey Jack have any toys anymore or any mechanisms anymore?

[07:02] If spooky pinball can do this, why would anyone spend 12 to $15,000 on an avatar?

[07:09] Okay, so that's a lot of what I like about the Evil Dead game. I think it's a very,

[07:13] very great offering from spooky. And you can tell by the layout, it's going to be a very friendly

[07:18] game to shoot. It's very much like an open fan layout game. And I think for most people,

[07:24] that's what they want. They want to jump on a game. It's a lot more inviting to play. And you're

[07:29] not going to have a lot of brick shots and you're not going to have a lot of frustrating gameplay.

[07:33] You're going to have a much more open feel and a much more satisfying experience with the game.

[07:39] And I think with spooky, you know, they're making games for more home collectors than they are for

[07:44] tournament players. And so I think people who are like, Oh, it's going to be too easy. The ball

[07:48] times are going to be too long. I'm just going to tell you this right now, as someone who just had

[07:52] a lower the post on guns and roses, because I just got so tired of playing the same game all the time,

[07:58] because the slingshots were just throwing the balls into the outlines every single time.

[08:03] I was just tired of like nudging all day long. And with the depth of the code in G and R,

[08:08] it just wasn't fun always having the same like five to eight minute game every single time and

[08:15] not seeing most of the game. I want to see more game when I play a deep coded game like G and R.

[08:21] You know, and I also love the fact in this game that you choose which movie you want to play.

[08:25] I like that. Like they're not going to mash it all up. Do you want to play the first movie?

[08:29] Or do you want to play the second movie? All right. So that's what I really like about this

[08:34] Evil Dead game. Now, are there some things I don't like? Yes, there are some things that I would have

[08:39] done differently. There's a lot of flat plastic in this game. There's not a lot of sculpts.

[08:45] There's some sculpts and the sculpts that are there, you know, I don't know about that head on

[08:49] the right side looks pretty cheap. But what I don't like is the cabin. You got this cabin right in

[08:55] the woods and I was right that there is a cabin in the game. It just doesn't spin. But it's very

[09:00] much flat plastic looking. And for $10,000, I wish they would have made a much nicer sculpt of

[09:09] a cabin because when you rely on flat plastics to create the environment and the buildings,

[09:15] it just looks cheap. And so I think these pinball companies are now kind of going into these games

[09:22] knowing that there is a robust mod community that's going to take it from here and make

[09:28] a modded version of that cabin that is sculpted. But again, for $10,000, I don't want to have to go

[09:36] pay some dude $350 or $400 for a new cabin. I feel like we should be getting better sculpts

[09:43] in these games for this much money. You know, you got a game like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

[09:48] for $12,000, it's got all the sculpts you want. It just doesn't have any of the toys in the mix

[09:54] that you want. I think that's like it's an interesting comparison where like Alice doesn't

[09:59] require any mods after the fact, but it doesn't have nearly as much toys and interactive things

[10:06] as Evil Dead. Okay, so what else about this game? Well, let me just say this. I think the thing I

[10:12] don't like the most about this game is that it's Evil Dead. And I look at all this effort and I

[10:20] love it. I mean, I love what I'm seeing here, but I wish this much effort went into big trouble in

[10:25] Little China. I wish this much effort went into gremlins or goonies. I wish this much effort went

[10:33] into Christmas vacation, right? I wish this much effort went into a theme that had just more universal

[10:41] appeal. Now I know they're only making $888. Now, is it in only or is that enough? Right? Are they

[10:49] going to sell all $888 today? I know OrderBanks are opening today. It's just a theme that I think

[10:57] if most of you are honest with yourselves, you have to be into really like these cult classic horror

[11:04] movies. And I think the majority of you are not. When I look at a theme like this, it's like I've

[11:10] gone to all the chiller theaters. I know these people are out there. Are they out there in enough

[11:16] numbers in the pinball buying demographic to justify spooky pinball after all of these years?

[11:23] It's like these to me are still the games that they're making for themselves. Like this is not the

[11:29] theme you make when you want to make a commercially super successful pinball machine. This is where

[11:35] you land when you want to make something that you want to make. And we've seen spooky go back and

[11:41] forth. Right? Rick and Morty, something that a lot more people can get into. Scooby-Doo, Looney

[11:47] Toons, those things are much more universally appealing. And so as I look at this game, I feel

[11:54] like where we're at right now in pinball, I would have liked to have seen spooky give us a more

[12:01] mainstream game, something like Beetlejuice, something like Gremlins. I'm just not sure

[12:08] that there's going to be 888 people today are going to order this game because again, I just

[12:15] don't think it has that mainstream appeal. The other thing is this, as I look at the pinball

[12:21] market and I say to myself, all right, is there a need to order this game today? Do you need to buy

[12:27] this game for $10,000 new inbox? You add butter cabinet. It's like another like $1,500. The toppers

[12:34] another $1,300. So you're pretty much at like $12,500 or more with all the bells and whistles.

[12:42] If you order the game today with all the accessories, do you need to order it today? They're going to be

[12:48] making this game for like another year basically. And if we've seen anything in the pinball marketplace,

[12:54] people who order on day one sometimes have to wait longer to get a game than people who just

[13:00] wait and see. And then you might be able to pick up the game at a show because distros will bring

[13:06] it to a show. And the other thing that's going to happen is this people. And you know this is the

[13:10] problem with all modern pinball at these prices, that this game is not going to go up in value.

[13:18] And if you buy it week one at 10, you know you're going to see these games for sale like on the used

[13:25] market in a few months for like 8,500. And the reason why that's going to happen is because

[13:33] Evil Dead, let's be honest here, is not a bolt to your floor theme that you're not going to want to

[13:40] let go. I think this is the kind of theme for the pinball buying demographic where the curious

[13:46] people will buy it, you'll play it, you'll enjoy it, it'll be fun, but you're not emotionally connected

[13:52] to Evil Dead in any way, shape or form. I'm just guessing out here, but I would say like there's

[13:59] probably and I mean this in the pinball buying demographic, the amount of people that are die

[14:03] hard Evil Dead fans and also like Evil Dead fans that just want Evil Dead one and two, I think

[14:09] Army of Darkness is more of the one that like everybody loves. It is what it is. I just don't

[14:14] see this as having that bolt to the floor universal appeal. And so I still would recommend the

[14:22] Wise Man would probably wait it out, just wait to see how the market goes on this game. Look,

[14:29] again, I don't think it's going to sell out instantly because of the theme. I don't think

[14:33] it's going to be hard to get one in a few months when they're actually being made. I doubt the

[14:38] code is complete and by the time it's complete, you'll be able to get one for much less money.

[14:43] This is the problem with all modern pinball. It really is the problem with all modern pinball

[14:48] is everything is kind of overpriced. We all know it. Everything loses value. So you really have to

[14:54] ask yourself, why do I need to own a new and box game right now? And I would say this, the only

[14:59] reason to own a new and box game is if it's a game you don't want to resell. If it's a theme you love

[15:05] so much, you're not going to want to pass it on. That's the only reason now to go in on any of these

[15:11] games. If you go in for any other reason than that, you're going to kick yourself because you're going

[15:16] to see the ability to get the same game exactly how you wanted it with probably no plays for a

[15:23] lot less money. So that's my overall take on this game. It's a beautiful game. It probably is Spooky's

[15:29] best game to date, but my overall feeling is was the juice worth the squeeze. If you applied all

[15:36] of this magic to evil freaking dead. And I think if this was anything else that had more mainstream

[15:44] love, yeah, instant sell out. Yeah, would be really hard to get one. Yeah, people would be paying

[15:50] over sticker to get it if it was Beetlejuice. They'd be paying over to get it if it was Gremlins,

[15:55] if it was Goonies, but not evil dead. And that's my overall marketing advice to Spooky. I think

[16:02] you've made enough games for you guys. And guys, if you want to make like horror movie stuff fine,

[16:07] but Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th both have a lot more mainstream appeal

[16:14] than evil dead. So that's my overall take. I hope that's a fair take on this game. I'm still waiting

[16:19] for Spooky to put it all together. More mainstream theme, great artwork they've got. They've got like

[16:26] all the great artwork. They've had a few mainstream themes, but nothing really mainstream that was

[16:32] adult other than Rick and Morty. They've gotten better with the toys with the mechs with the

[16:38] layouts with the software. So they're just there in my honest opinion. They're right on the precipice

[16:45] of being there. But who knows, you know, the pinball market is a strange place. I think a lot of

[16:50] people are severely disappointed in Avatar and Jersey Jack. Like I'm looking at Jersey Jack,

[16:56] they're at IAPA and they're like pushing this redemption stuff. And they're also selling their

[17:02] games at a discount. How does that make you feel? You can go to IAPA and buy an avatar for $11,000.

[17:09] So they're already slashing prices on their existing games. And to me, that is the ultimate

[17:15] marketing fail of Jersey Jack pinball. They should not be discounting their games right away.

[17:20] They know they have to because they've made every boneheaded marketing mistake you could

[17:25] possibly make starting with themes that people don't really want. And I have to be honest,

[17:30] Evil Dead is also a theme that most people don't really want. But the good news for Spooky is this,

[17:36] they don't need to make a game that most people want. They only have to make 888 of these games.

[17:44] And will they get 888 orders over a year? I would say yes. Are they going to get that right now?

[17:52] Probably not. Again, because history has shown us if you wait, I think you're still going to be able

[17:57] to get this game for like a couple grand off in six months because in six months, you're going to

[18:02] see Harry Potter, you're going to see Keith Elwin's King Kong, you're going to see Dungeons and Dragons.

[18:08] And I don't know about you gang, but FOMO is kind of dead. It really is. And when I see stuff now

[18:14] at these prices, I just don't feel compelled at all to get in on one because everything loses money.

[18:21] Like everything loses money. So the smart guy is just waiting it out. And I almost feel bad for

[18:26] these manufacturers, but they all did it to themselves. They all have done it. Is Spooky Pimbal

[18:31] competitively priced at $10,000? I would argue not really. Like not really because remember,

[18:38] the Evil Dead license is not expensive. And so is there more in this game than X-Men Premium?

[18:44] X-Men's a much more expensive license. Mechanically, there's a lot in X-Men just like there is in this

[18:51] game. And from a shot layout and a creative design standpoint, I would still say X-Men is far superior

[18:57] than what you're seeing in Evil Dead. So it's like, I don't know. It's like, if you've got $10,000

[19:03] burning a hole in your pocket, there's a lot of great games you can get. You can go get a James

[19:08] Bond LE, which has amazing code, a much more expensive and mainstream IP than Evil Dead. You

[19:14] can go get a James Bond LE for $8,800 now. And that's the thing about all Pimbal launches.

[19:21] These companies need to keep you in a bubble. They want to get you like in a tunnel where all

[19:27] you're looking at is this game. They don't want you to step back a little bit and say, hey, wait

[19:32] a minute, I can actually go get a Guns N' Roses LE Neuin box for $6,500. $6,500. If you fully option

[19:42] out Evil Dead, you're over $12,000. This is what's wrong with Pimbal. And I'm really worried about

[19:48] Neuin box because I think every new Pimbal launch now, we're going to be looking at it like this.

[19:54] Like is the juice worth the squeeze? Do I need to own it right now? And it sucks because for all

[20:00] these companies, we just don't feel the same giddiness we used to when a spooky game was like

[20:07] $7,000 when a sternally was $8,500, when there was only $500 LEs and only $200 CEs for Jersey Jack.

[20:15] It's a whole new world right now. So yes, I do applaud them on the effort. The market will do

[20:20] what the market does. But again, my recommendation to everybody is I would wait, I would play the game,

[20:27] I would make sure Evil Dead is something you really want. I wouldn't be blinded by beautiful artwork

[20:32] and toys. I think you're going to have to know this is going to be a game that you really want.

[20:36] And gameplay is important. Gameplay is important. Even though this has a lot of toys and it's loaded,

[20:42] will that equal a really fun experience? And for a lot of you, you've already got enough great games.

[20:49] I mean, I'm watching people this week unbox their Metallica LEs and I'm like, it just never stops.

[20:54] Like it just never stops. These games just keep on coming out and they're all really expensive.

[21:00] And let me just say this, it's really hard for any game now to really wow us, like really,

[21:06] really wow us, like blow us away. It's just really hard because at these prices, I don't even feel

[21:12] like we're close to seeing what we should be getting. When you look at like the magic of

[21:17] Balli Williams games and all the crazy mechs and how well executed everything was. And now these

[21:24] games are all like $12,000, $13,000 for every single game, regardless of the IP, regardless of

[21:31] what's in it. I don't know. It's kind of made my giddiness for new and box pinball to be so short

[21:37] live. Like I get excited for like a few hours and then I'm like, I'm good. I'm good. Like why would I

[21:41] buy it now? Why would I buy it now? Give me one good reason why I should buy it now. You know,

[21:46] people are like, oh, you got to support the companies. Look, Spooky Pinball is basically

[21:50] going to make $8,880,000 if they sell every single one of these games. So it's like, you know, people

[21:58] are not struggling. And I think there needs to be more accountability for the themes these companies

[22:05] are selecting. I mean that I wouldn't have landed on Evil Dead. I just wouldn't have again for like

[22:11] almost $9 million at stake. That's the theme we're going to make. I just think there's got to be money

[22:17] to get better IPs if there's $9 million at stake. Everybody love you guys. Thanks for the support.

[22:25] Go check out this game. I think the feedback is going to be very positive. I think it's going to be

[22:29] Spooky's best game to date. But I think the market is in a very precarious situation right now. And

[22:35] we'll see the market will do what the market does. Everybody have a great day. Canada out.

[22:47] Oh

[23:18] Oh

[23:27] 

[23:31]
