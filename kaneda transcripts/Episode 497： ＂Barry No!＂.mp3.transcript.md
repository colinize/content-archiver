[00:00] Put the blame on me boy.

[00:03] Put the blame on me.

[00:06] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:10] Welcome to the Midweek edition of Canatus Pimball Podcasts with Canada, and Craig Bobby is

[00:16] going to be joining us today.

[00:17] No, wait, wait, Craig's nowhere to be found.

[00:19] Okay, might be no midweek show this week from Craig Bobby.

[00:22] Uh-oh, what is he going to talk about?

[00:24] Well, he's probably going to listen to this show and then get content for his show.

[00:28] So here's what we're going to do on Canatus Pimball Podcasts.

[00:31] We're going to give you what's going on in the Pimball world.

[00:33] We're going to do it in a snackable, digestible way.

[00:36] Have you seen like the shows lately are getting so long again.

[00:40] I mean, I want to listen to Christopher Fransche interview Zombie Yeti to an a half hours

[00:46] long, two and a half hours long.

[00:49] Now you should never have to decide between whether or not you're going to watch a movie

[00:54] or listen to a Pimball podcast.

[00:56] And here's the crazy part.

[00:57] It's two and a half hours long, and it's only part one of his interview with Zombie Yeti.

[01:04] Well, seriously, how can you make a Pimball Podcast where it is longer than the Ten Commandments

[01:11] movie?

[01:12] I mean, seriously, what's going on?

[01:14] Everyone needs to stop, stop saying so much, and just get to the point like we're going

[01:18] to do right now.

[01:19] So let's start off with something that's starting to make the rounds in the dark alleys

[01:25] of the Pimball gossip mill.

[01:27] And that is that there is an image of Barrio designer, Pimball designer, extraordinary

[01:33] Barrio.

[01:35] There is a picture floating around of Barry from a Halloween party from 2014 in which Barry

[01:42] is in blackface.

[01:44] And if you talk about a bad time to have a photo like this surfacing out in the world,

[01:52] and I think they just need to get ahead of it.

[01:53] And I think Barry needs to apologize and do the due diligence and get in front of this

[01:58] thing because it will become a PR nightmare for deep root Pimball if they don't get in

[02:04] front of this thing.

[02:05] And so I look for Barry to make some sort of response.

[02:08] I don't think this photo has been circulated really.

[02:10] I don't think a lot of people have seen it.

[02:12] I've seen it.

[02:13] He's dressed like a pimp.

[02:14] He's wearing like a gold chain with a dollar bill symbol.

[02:18] He's fanning out money.

[02:19] He's in this like bright purple sequence Halloween costume.

[02:23] And it was six years ago.

[02:24] So unfortunately, unfortunately in today's cancel culture, and I'm not making excuses for

[02:30] this.

[02:31] Like I don't think it's ever appropriate for anyone to ever go blackface ever.

[02:35] I don't care what outfit idea you think you're going to do in if you're going to go

[02:38] as the black panther for Halloween and your white don't paint your face black.

[02:42] Okay, just don't do it.

[02:44] You don't see African American people painting their faces white when they go as Superman

[02:49] for Halloween.

[02:50] Okay, it's just a stupid decision.

[02:52] And I think it goes to show it's like people make moves like this when they don't have

[02:57] diverse friends when they don't have diverse people at a party like that.

[03:03] And there's just never an apology for it.

[03:05] So I don't even want to hear the people say like, well, you know, don't be so sensitive.

[03:09] Just laugh it off.

[03:10] No, that's not how it's supposed to work.

[03:12] You're just not supposed to do the stupid thing.

[03:15] So I think they should get in front of this.

[03:17] I think Barry should make a statement.

[03:19] And I think they should put it behind them.

[03:21] It's six years ago.

[03:23] But it's going to resurface.

[03:24] I mean, we're seeing it now in today's cancel culture.

[03:27] Now I am not one of these people who doesn't allow people to apologize and say, I'm sorry

[03:32] for doing this.

[03:33] It was a stupid thing.

[03:34] I shouldn't have done it.

[03:35] And it won't ever happen again.

[03:37] I mean, you have to kind of do that.

[03:39] You just can't ignore it.

[03:41] You also have to forgive people if they apologize for stupid stuff, too.

[03:45] And I think that's the real issue right now is that people are going, are going to be

[03:50] very reluctant to do that.

[03:52] So I implore you if he does the right thing and they say the right thing that you also

[03:57] have it in you to forgive this obvious lapse of judgment on Barry O's part, okay?

[04:03] Because we're in this hobby not to, not to talk about this stuff.

[04:08] We don't want this to be part of the hobby.

[04:10] I don't want Jon Trudeau to be a pedophile, weirdo creep.

[04:14] If you've seen that mugshot of him smiling, it's disgusting.

[04:17] I put it on my Facebook page.

[04:19] I don't want any of that.

[04:21] We come to this hobby to have pinball fun.

[04:24] We come to this hobby to have these guys design games that we enjoy.

[04:28] We don't want to.

[04:29] We don't want to.

[04:30] When we go to buy a pinball machine, have to really juggle who the person is versus what

[04:36] they create in pinball.

[04:37] But unfortunately, that's been the case since I've been following this hobby.

[04:41] I mean, a lot of these designers have a lot of baggage associated with them.

[04:45] They have a lot of things that are happening in their personal lives that would definitely

[04:50] impact, definitely impact people's desire to own something they create.

[04:55] And I don't know what it is about the pinball world, but it definitely seems to attract

[05:00] people that have a lot of skeletons in their closet, got a lot of issues that they need

[05:05] to figure out in their personal lives.

[05:07] And it always comes up.

[05:09] It always comes up to bite these people in the pinball hobby.

[05:12] And so for a lot of you out there, you don't really get exposed to it.

[05:16] You just want to play the games.

[05:17] But I have to say, I would have a hard time owning a game by a guy that has been convicted

[05:24] of having child pornography.

[05:26] And I get what people say.

[05:27] Like, well, a lot of people worked on the Ghostbusters game.

[05:29] So, so what?

[05:32] So what?

[05:33] So what?

[05:34] It's unfortunate, but it just so happens that the guy that was leading this game is that

[05:39] guy.

[05:40] So look, for me, I wouldn't own it.

[05:41] For some of you out there, it's not so much of a problem, or it is a problem, but you

[05:45] really don't care.

[05:46] And you want to show your support to the other people who worked on the game.

[05:48] And I understand that as well.

[05:50] I understand that as well.

[05:51] So we'll see what happens with this story.

[05:53] I fully expect this photo will end up on pinside, and then that's going to blow up.

[05:58] It's going to happen.

[06:00] There is no way you can keep stuff on the internet from not spreading, from not being

[06:05] shared.

[06:06] There's just nothing you can do.

[06:08] And if you have stuff that you don't want out there, good luck.

[06:12] If it gets screen grabbed and shared, there's nothing you can do.

[06:15] There's nothing you can do, but get in front of it.

[06:17] All right.

[06:18] So what else is going on on pinball this week?

[06:20] On the midweek show, not featuring Craig Bobby.

[06:22] Okay.

[06:23] So the next thing is heavy metal.

[06:24] This game got revealed by Stern Pinball this week.

[06:27] And I don't think in all of my years covering pinball that a game release has made me feel

[06:32] so numb as heavy metal.

[06:34] I just feel nothing.

[06:35] I feel absolutely nothing.

[06:37] I feel like this game is the easiest game for me to make up my mind not to buy it.

[06:42] This game will keep my money in my wallet greater than any other game ever released.

[06:48] It is absolutely insane that this game is $8,300 bucks.

[06:53] I'm not even making this up $8,300 for this game that's a cheap game to begin with.

[07:00] It's Stern's basic Star Wars home pin.

[07:03] And then it's like an art package that doesn't even look good.

[07:07] It's got nothing in it.

[07:08] It's got DMDs.

[07:09] This game looks like it's worth $5,000 at most.

[07:13] At most.

[07:14] I mean, think about it.

[07:15] Stern Pro has way more in it than this does.

[07:17] And this is $8,300 bucks.

[07:19] And I'm so tired of people saying like, well, this is a contract game.

[07:23] This isn't Stern putting that price on it.

[07:25] It's the license holder that put $8,300 onto the price tag.

[07:30] You've got to be kidding me.

[07:31] That Stern is not consulting with them and giving them advice on where to price the game.

[07:36] The problem is that $8,300 bucks they're not going to sell any of these.

[07:39] I'd be surprised if they sell 50 of these things.

[07:42] They suck.

[07:43] And if you're a fan of heavy metal, there's nothing here for you to like.

[07:47] It doesn't even use the art style that you remember that you loved in the comics.

[07:52] And then it doesn't have any of the iconic songs from the movie.

[07:55] Like it almost succeeds in appealing to none of the two fan bases of heavy metal.

[08:01] This game is going to be a colossal failure.

[08:04] A colossal failure.

[08:05] And what benefit is it to Stern to go with these license holders and make these products

[08:11] that are going to be laughed at?

[08:13] Absolutely laughed at.

[08:14] I mean, this thing is a joke.

[08:16] And I know all of you feel that way.

[08:17] It's not even worth any more of our air time.

[08:19] Here's what we're not going to see.

[08:20] We're not going to see people talking about this game.

[08:23] We're not going to see people unboxing this game.

[08:25] It is just going to be a forgotten game.

[08:27] Oh yeah, remember like five years from now.

[08:29] Remember like, oh yeah, like heavy metal.

[08:31] Oh yeah, I forgot about it.

[08:32] Yep, absolutely.

[08:34] Chuck this up there with primus.

[08:36] Chuck this up there with the Paps Blue Ribbon game.

[08:38] This is just another one of these like stupid games that are not needed and nobody wants

[08:43] it.

[08:44] It's so boring, so boring.

[08:46] All right, Ninja Turtle Pros are on the line.

[08:49] There was a great photo that Jared shared on Facebook of all the manufacturing going

[08:54] on around Ninja Turtles.

[08:55] Now, if you're in on a Ninja Turtle Pro, you can expect to get your game any day now.

[09:00] I think the pros are shipping this week.

[09:02] It always is a great site.

[09:04] It always is a great site to see when Stern turns on their manufacturing.

[09:09] What a colossal juggernaut they are.

[09:11] I mean, there's just rows and rows in games.

[09:14] There's cabinets stacked on top of cabinets.

[09:16] They don't just make one game or 10 games or 50, they just make hundreds of games a week.

[09:21] And it really is a site to behold whenever Stern turns it on.

[09:25] Now, I know everyone is thinking the same thing I'm thinking.

[09:28] We're just thinking one thing.

[09:30] What's the quality of these games?

[09:32] The first people that unbox these games, people are going to go over those play fields with

[09:38] a microscope.

[09:39] And if we see any pooling, if we see any ribbing, and if we see terrible cratering on these

[09:46] pros, that's going to spell a lot of problems for people who are in on Ellie's and premiums

[09:52] of Ninja Turtles because that's the final thing.

[09:55] That's the final thing is people just want to make sure the quality is there.

[09:58] But otherwise, otherwise, the zombie Eddie art package is incredible.

[10:04] There's a lot in this game.

[10:05] This game is super fun.

[10:06] I still think if you ask me, it should have had the 80s cartoon in it.

[10:11] I think this is Stern's new approach to go cheap on everything you like.

[10:15] Think about it like this.

[10:16] If Stern made a modern version of He-Man or Transformers or GI Joe, right?

[10:22] If they based a modern game on the cartoon show, you loved from the 80s.

[10:28] Imagine getting a Transformers 80s version, Pimball Machine, two day from Stern.

[10:33] And they didn't use clips from the TV show back in the day.

[10:36] They animated it like they did with Ninja Turtles.

[10:39] You can't tell me that more people wouldn't be outraged that they replaced the iconic

[10:45] cartoon we loved with this new animated style.

[10:49] I think Ninja Turtles gets a little bit of a pass because people just don't remember

[10:53] the show as much as maybe Transformers or GI Joe or He-Man.

[10:58] But it shouldn't because if you're a diehard Ninja Turtle fan, don't you want the show

[11:02] that you grew up loving and watching and don't you want the voices from those shows

[11:07] in these clips?

[11:08] And you can't tell me Stern couldn't afford to go get those voices and those clips.

[11:12] And so, look, it is what it is.

[11:13] They did it that way.

[11:15] And you people have spoken.

[11:16] I think you're really interested in it.

[11:18] And I think this game's going to sell a lot for Stern Pimball.

[11:21] So I will chalk this up as a successful game for Stern Pimball.

[11:25] Now speaking of successful games, American Pimball and Hot Wheels.

[11:29] The stream went on this weekend with Jack Danger.

[11:32] There were two good videos that Zach and Greg Bone put up for straight down the middle.

[11:36] Those three things worked together to introduce this game to people for the first time.

[11:40] And I must say, I was talking to a couple distributors and they said, Hot Wheels sales

[11:44] are really good.

[11:46] And so that's a good sign.

[11:48] It's a good sign.

[11:49] Now a lot of you out there are saying, I need to play the game.

[11:51] I want to see if it's fun.

[11:53] And you're going to make up your mind then.

[11:55] Problem with that, there isn't a lot of Hot Wheels on location and there won't be.

[11:59] Now here's the question I have because if you've looked at American Pimball, the struggle

[12:03] they've always had between revealing a game is fulfilling orders and how soon can they

[12:09] get games out once the games are supposedly for sale.

[12:13] Like we're in the middle of June right now.

[12:15] And if you ordered a Hot Wheels today, this is the big question.

[12:18] If you order it today, when are you going to get your game?

[12:21] Are you going to get it in July?

[12:23] Are you going to get it in August?

[12:24] Are you going to get it in September?

[12:26] Now I heard through the grapevine.

[12:28] This is what I heard.

[12:29] I heard that American Pimball only had 25 play fields and like eight sets of ramps ready

[12:36] to go for this game.

[12:37] And so I'm not sure if they have enough parts to make a lot of Hot Wheels games right

[12:43] now.

[12:44] Now the problem is in this industry, the hype window to sell the majority of your games

[12:49] is 90 days.

[12:50] So here's my concern for American Pimball.

[12:53] It's not that they don't have a game that people want to order.

[12:55] I think if they make people wait too long to get their Hot Wheels game, the people are

[13:00] going to drop out of waiting for it.

[13:03] And so they have a window now in which they really need to, you know, fire on all cylinders

[13:09] and get as many of these games out there as they possibly can.

[13:13] So we don't know how this story ends yet.

[13:16] But we are going to track to see how many unboxings we see and how many people that ordered

[13:22] this game last weekend.

[13:24] And this week, how long it's going to take for them to get their games.

[13:28] Now history is shown as that AP takes a while to fulfill orders.

[13:32] So we're going to see if they break that trend here.

[13:35] Remember, October Fest was almost like they showed it.

[13:37] They had a bunch of games and then it took like four or five months for people to get their

[13:41] games.

[13:42] So are we going to see that not be the case with Hot Wheels?

[13:45] Now again, I keep hearing that Dovel and the people over there, they're pretty cheap.

[13:51] They don't want to pay for stuff up front.

[13:53] They're on a very like, you know, cash basis with their vendors.

[13:56] I don't know what the story is.

[13:58] I hope we see that not be the case.

[14:00] I hope we see a lot of people get these games.

[14:03] And then the ultimate question is how many Hot Wheels do you think they're going to sell?

[14:06] Are they going to sell over 500?

[14:08] 500 I heard is the break even point for American Pimball.

[14:12] They have to sell at least 500 before they start making money.

[14:17] Hence the free shaker motor for the first 500 sold.

[14:20] I don't know.

[14:21] Do you see them selling 1,000 of these?

[14:24] I just don't.

[14:25] I just I don't know.

[14:27] I don't know if that's going to be the case.

[14:30] And we'll see.

[14:31] We'll see the way it goes.

[14:32] Now, speaking of when is a game going to ship?

[14:34] The next game that everyone really wants information on is Guns and Roses and Jersey

[14:38] Jack Pimball and Jersey Jack Pimball continues to give us absolutely no confirmation it's

[14:43] Guns and Roses and no details.

[14:45] And they never followed up on that innovation teaser that they put out.

[14:49] I think right now I think we can call that a mistake on the day that Ninja Turtles comes

[14:54] out.

[14:55] You put out a teaser saying Jersey Jack Pimball has got the innovation that you've been

[14:59] asking for and then you never follow up on it.

[15:02] So what was the point of any of that?

[15:03] I just think that's like it's it's it's kind of lame to do it that way.

[15:08] There was no point.

[15:09] There was absolutely no point.

[15:11] You did not give people enough information to not buy Ninja Turtles to not buy Hot Wheels

[15:16] to not seek out a Rick and Morty.

[15:18] So what did you accomplish in doing?

[15:21] Absolutely nothing.

[15:22] But here's what we're going to do on Canadian Spinball Podcasts is I am going to give you

[15:26] on a weekly basis maybe more than once a week.

[15:29] I am going to give you details on Guns and Roses and I'm going to share it on my Facebook

[15:33] page and also talk about it on the show.

[15:36] The first thing that I revealed on my Facebook page is that Guns and Roses is hand drawn artwork.

[15:42] It is illustrated drawn artwork on the game.

[15:46] It's not like photo realistic artwork kind of like a Chris Franchi.

[15:50] It's more like a zombie Eddie style.

[15:53] So that is the first GNR T's I'm going to give you.

[15:56] It is a beautiful art package and you're going to be very, very happy with Guns and Roses

[16:00] artwork.

[16:01] I will do more of these sort of simple GNR T's is moving on.

[16:05] If you were to ask me when is Guns and Roses going to ship?

[16:08] Well the reality is this.

[16:10] We share the photos of the JJP factory and the first thing they're going to do is make

[16:14] more Willy Wonka's.

[16:16] And that makes total sense.

[16:17] Let's train our new workforce to make Willy Wonka's and I think that makes sense for a few

[16:22] reasons.

[16:23] You're training people on a game that isn't really flying off the shelves right now.

[16:28] So they're going to learn how to put these games together but these games are not going

[16:32] to be looked at under a microscope like GNR would.

[16:35] The last thing you want to do is make Guns and Roses machines.

[16:39] This highly sought after new game.

[16:41] The last thing you'd want to do is make those games with a new crew who doesn't have

[16:45] experience working together because if they make mistakes that could totally screw up

[16:51] all of the enthusiasm and momentum for Guns and Roses.

[16:54] So might as well make some wonkas because we all know that wonkas sales are pretty much

[16:58] dried up.

[16:59] But might as well train them to make a couple hundred wonkas, keep them in boxes in the

[17:03] factory and get them started on wonka.

[17:06] So I think that's a smart move.

[17:08] But it also means that Guns and Roses like the parts and everything and the assembly line.

[17:13] I know it doesn't take that long to set up everything but it does take six to eight

[17:18] weeks to order parts.

[17:19] So are all the GNR parts ordered or are they not?

[17:23] Now I've been hearing that they've still been going over Guns and Roses at the beginning

[17:28] of the year.

[17:29] So I don't know.

[17:31] I don't know if Pat Lawler and Eric and Brett and Leonard have said, hey, Pencils down,

[17:36] this is the game.

[17:38] These are the parts put the order in.

[17:40] Has that happened yet?

[17:41] Does the Chicago factory have all of the parts they need to put Guns and Roses on the

[17:46] line?

[17:47] Now Jersey Jacket easily tell us that.

[17:49] We have all the parts in house for our next game and we expect it to go on the line in

[17:55] whatever.

[17:56] Why can't they even just tell us that?

[17:57] You know, it's so weird and you're not going to be surprised.

[18:00] It's Guns and Roses and then it's Toy Story.

[18:03] They don't have a surprise title for you for the next two years.

[18:07] So I think this wall of silence over what's the next title?

[18:11] It doesn't make any sense.

[18:12] GNR is going to blow people away for a lot of reasons, but I think the reason that I'm

[18:16] so excited about this theme and the theme integration is it's going to be one of the

[18:19] greatest theme in a great at pens of all time and it's so easy to understand why.

[18:23] They didn't license Guns and Roses.

[18:25] They didn't license the band and the songs and the imagery.

[18:29] Guns and Roses is making this game with Eric.

[18:31] It is slash and Eric designing this game.

[18:33] For that reason alone, you're going to see everything.

[18:36] You're going to see everything you want in this game.

[18:39] The only thing you might not get are the music videos because they might not own the

[18:43] rights to all those music videos.

[18:45] The record label might, but everything else.

[18:47] Let me tell you who owns the concert footage.

[18:49] The live concert footage of Guns and Roses is owned by the band.

[18:53] That's not owned by anybody else.

[18:55] So I fully expect to see that in there, even just that alone.

[18:59] Name me another music pin.

[19:01] Any music pin in the history of music pens that has ever shown you footage live.

[19:06] Of the band.

[19:07] Footage of the band through the years.

[19:09] I mean, think about how awesome that would be if they had footage of Guns and Roses from

[19:13] the 80s, from the 90s, from the 2000s to this to that.

[19:18] I mean, I would love it.

[19:20] I would love it if there was a moment in which you could be GNR from the VMAs in 2002 and

[19:25] then all the way to Chinese democracy back into the not in this lifetime tour.

[19:30] It would be awesome.

[19:32] You can't tell me one of the goals in this game.

[19:34] It's not to reunite axle with slash.

[19:37] I mean, that seems to make sense.

[19:39] It's actually the real story of Guns and Roses.

[19:42] So if you were to ask me if I was betting when will we see Guns and Roses, I think you're

[19:46] going to see it revealed in August, September for a September October release.

[19:53] So I don't think we're going to see it anytime sooner.

[19:55] I hope we see it sooner, but I don't expect to.

[19:58] All right, finally guys, because we're coming up on two and a half hours right now.

[20:01] No, it's only been like less than 20 minutes.

[20:04] I'm finally rick and Morty.

[20:05] So a few things on Rick and Morty.

[20:07] So here's the thing that I really, I really don't understand.

[20:10] There is one person on Pinside that always says, don't listen to Canada.

[20:14] Canadian is an idiot.

[20:15] Canadian is an A-hole.

[20:16] Can we just like cancel this guy from the entire community and you know him as Hilton and

[20:21] why snow?

[20:22] Now Hilton's been telling me to shut up and go away and nobody listened to me.

[20:26] Now what have I done for you with Rick and Morty?

[20:28] Was I not the one who talked about the upper orbit shot and really worked with Scott

[20:33] when I interviewed him and talked to him on getting those screws removed to make that shot easier?

[20:39] Canada and Scott and now what's happening?

[20:41] Everyone's getting that fix in the game.

[20:43] You know who didn't give you that fix was Hilton.

[20:46] He did nothing for that fix.

[20:47] Okay, so there's that.

[20:49] Then the scoop, the scoop project.

[20:51] Okay, I've helped people figure out how to make their scoop work better.

[20:54] Maybe you need to add a washer.

[20:56] Maybe you need to bend the hood down a little bit with your thumb.

[20:58] But I've been highlighting things that you can do to make your game play better.

[21:04] But why should you listen to Canada?

[21:05] Because he's just a troll that nobody should listen to.

[21:07] And then the final thing that I saw is just ridiculous is this.

[21:10] So the other two things that I brought up were the posts were wearing so quickly on the

[21:15] game and that the target decals that you spent money on were just evaporating after

[21:20] like 50 to 100 plays because they're just stickers.

[21:23] They're not covered with any mylar.

[21:25] Okay, so what has happened since then?

[21:27] And I'm reading this on Pinsike as people have been asking like I'm spending all this

[21:30] money on the game and what's the update?

[21:33] I'm here to tell you that once again, an issue that Canadian's pinball podcast has brought

[21:37] up in the pinball world and brought to people's attention because two to three thousand people

[21:42] listen to every episode in issue that we raised on this show will now have a solution.

[21:48] So Hilton instead of me going away, maybe you should listen to the things we're talking

[21:53] about on this show because we're actually making positive change happen in pinball.

[21:59] So I'm happy to report that spooky pinball is going to change the target decals on their

[22:04] games moving forward for Rick and Morty.

[22:07] So do not cancel your target decal order.

[22:10] You are going to have better mylar protected thicker decals that they're going to put on

[22:16] the games.

[22:17] If you've already received your Rick and Morty game, just email Morgan at spooky pinball

[22:23] and she will send you out the new target decals when they're available free of charge.

[22:30] Thank you, canada.

[22:31] The guy that sucks that nobody should listen to that nobody should take seriously.

[22:36] Thank you.

[22:37] Hilton you're welcome.

[22:38] You're welcome.

[22:39] We're actually doing more good for this hobby and for this community than you are because

[22:45] you always do the same thing and say, hey, this game's perfect.

[22:48] It just needs a few tweaks and then you you rattle off a laundry list of things that

[22:53] are wrong with the game and then it's all about making your game work for you.

[22:57] See what this podcast does is I want to make sure that everybody gets their game working

[23:02] the way it should.

[23:04] Not about your little tweaks just for you and your little Madison, Wisconsin crew, but

[23:08] everyone gets from the manufacturer what they pay for.

[23:12] And speaking of that, the other issue are the posts.

[23:15] These pinball life posts that are just deteriorating right away again and these things are crap.

[23:19] They are total crap.

[23:21] And I saw that Hilton said, well, if you have issues with them, hit this is what he said.

[23:25] He said, you should take up those issues with pinball life because they make the post.

[23:30] No.

[23:31] Hilton, if I buy a game from spooky pinball and something in it is defective and wearing

[23:37] way too soon, my issue is with spooky.

[23:41] They source the parts from pinball life.

[23:43] I have a warranty with spooky pinball.

[23:46] Spooky pinball took my money.

[23:47] If I have issues with target decals, am I going to go find the company that made the stickers?

[23:53] If I buy a car and let's say my exhaust is not working right, do I go find the vendor

[23:58] that supplied the exhaust to Dodge or do I go to Dodge?

[24:02] See, this is what I don't understand his logic.

[24:06] The way his brain works makes no sense.

[24:09] It's why if he had a pinball podcast, it would be at the bottom, the bottom of the list

[24:14] every year when people voted on the best pinball podcast.

[24:16] No, the issue is with spooky pinball and they also should change these posts and they

[24:21] should find new posts and just mail them out to people.

[24:25] See, it's cheaper to get these little details right at the beginning.

[24:29] It's got to be a headache for chucking company to have to mail people these things because

[24:33] these products are cheap as f.

[24:35] For them, it's like 10 cents a post.

[24:37] Now they got to spend a few bucks to send people something that they could have just put

[24:42] better ones in.

[24:43] That's why there should be better quality control testing at all of these manufacturers.

[24:48] If stern pinball gave you target decals like these, you guys would roast them.

[24:53] If stern pinball gave you posts that fell apart this quickly, you guys would destroy them.

[24:57] And yes, spooky pinball does get a pass because they're a smaller company.

[25:01] But no more.

[25:02] The pass ends when you start selling people games that cost $8,500 bucks, $9,500, heck throwing

[25:08] a cruiseman playfield and a spooky pinball machine is over $10,000.

[25:13] So for $8,500 bucks, you're no longer selling a homebrew company machine at $5,000, $6,000.

[25:21] And you've got to get the details right.

[25:23] But I'll say this, chuck and Morgan and company, they're immediately on it.

[25:28] They're immediately going to fix those issues and they're going to help people get what

[25:32] they need to make the games work right.

[25:34] And so the last thing, I think the only thing now, the only thing is to see what they

[25:38] do with these posts.

[25:39] I mean, look, I bought new posts.

[25:40] I bought a bunch of backup posts.

[25:42] They're so cheap.

[25:42] They don't care about that.

[25:43] I really don't care.

[25:45] And the last thing I'm looking at my machine right now, and it's in pieces a little bit

[25:49] and you're like, oh, Chris, what did you do?

[25:50] I know.

[25:51] Canada can't really do tech very well on pinball, but I'm swapping out the monitor on my Rick

[25:55] and Morty game because I just didn't like the washed out look of the stock monitor.

[26:00] And there's an LCD screen that actually creates much better contrast.

[26:04] It's only $60.

[26:05] So here's what I found out today because you have to order the monitor or the LCD and the

[26:10] new driver board for it.

[26:12] Now the driver board looks exactly the same as the one I ordered.

[26:16] My LCD screen came in today, the new one, but my new driver didn't come in.

[26:20] And I was like, oh, it looks like it should just, it should work.

[26:22] So I took out the old LCD.

[26:25] I put in the new one.

[26:26] I plugged it in and it doesn't work with this driver.

[26:29] So now I've got a machine that's going to be in pieces for a few days.

[26:33] And for those of you thinking about doing this upgrade, I'm sure it avoids the spooky

[26:36] warranty.

[26:37] The other thing is this.

[26:38] It's not the easiest thing to do because the covering that covers the LCD, the metal piece,

[26:44] it actually sits underneath the speaker panel and the speaker grill.

[26:49] So you have to sort of take off all your speakers.

[26:52] You have to shimmy that plastic out of the way.

[26:55] You then get access to it.

[26:56] You have to take off the lock that locks the back box covering.

[27:00] So there's work to be done.

[27:02] It's not just a few screws in your in and out.

[27:05] Now there's a lot more work than that.

[27:07] So for those of you who are squeamish about taking your games apart and having wires and

[27:13] screws and lug nuts everywhere, this is not the modification for you.

[27:18] You don't need it.

[27:19] The game still is, it's not going to make the game more fun.

[27:22] It's just going to make the images on the screen look a little better.

[27:25] Do I wish spooky pinball use these better monitors from the factory that had a better field

[27:30] of view?

[27:31] Absolutely.

[27:32] Because it's only 60 bucks.

[27:34] Now maybe they can't source 750 of them and that might be why.

[27:38] So I'm going to do this mod.

[27:40] I'm going to see how it works.

[27:41] People who did it on TNA swear by it.

[27:44] But again, proceed with caution because it's not for everybody to do this.

[27:49] Well that's it for the midweek edition of Canadian pinball podcast.

[27:52] So you can give people a lot of pinball information in just a little bit of time.

[27:56] And we can do it without any drama.

[27:58] We can do it without any fighting.

[28:00] Look and I love all the other pinball podcasts that are out there.

[28:03] I really do.

[28:04] I really do.

[28:05] There's not too much to talk about.

[28:07] We're all stuck at home.

[28:09] Everybody be safe.

[28:10] Don't be stupid.

[28:11] This thing has not gone away.

[28:13] COVID is still a real thing.

[28:14] I've known people who have passed away by it.

[28:17] I don't really talk about it.

[28:18] But if you think going out to our Cades and playing pinball on location is the smart thing

[28:22] to do.

[28:23] I think you're wrong.

[28:24] I don't think it's safe.

[28:25] I don't think you should do it.

[28:27] And I'm not saying that to discourage my friends who have location play.

[28:32] It's just we're just not there yet.

[28:33] We're just not there yet.

[28:35] And we're starting to see its spike in states that opened up early.

[28:38] What did people think was going to happen?

[28:40] What did you think was going to happen when everyone just ran right back to the kinds

[28:44] of things that spread a virus and touching a pinball machine and being in bars and being

[28:50] in our Cades is not a safe place.

[28:52] It's just to me it's not worth it.

[28:54] It's just not worth it.

[28:55] All right, everyone.

[28:56] This was the midweek edition of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[28:58] I hope you guys have a great week.

[29:00] We'll be back with some more news.

[29:02] And we're just here to prove to you that you can do a midweek show in the middle of the

[29:06] week.

[29:07] It can be done.

[29:08] I love you Craig Bobby.

[29:09] Don't take it personally.

[29:10] You just don't have it in you to be mean about Canada saying that people who bought the

[29:14] Jurassic Park Toppers are more on.

[29:15] I mean, you just can't do it.

[29:16] I heard you for five minutes try to like try to articulate how disappointed you were and

[29:21] everyone should just hold hands and have fun in pinball.

[29:24] You got to stick to your last man because now you're in with the big boys.

[29:27] Back put you on the big stage and this is what it's like when you want to say stuff

[29:30] about Canada.

[29:31] We going toe to toe now midweek.

[29:33] I'm in the midweek.

[29:34] You're still trying to get some notes based on my show later.

[29:46] Bravo.

[29:47] Bravo.
