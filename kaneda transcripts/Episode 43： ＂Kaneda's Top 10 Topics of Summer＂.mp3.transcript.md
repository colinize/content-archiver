[00:00] People keep asking if I'm back and I haven't really had an answer.

[00:12] But now yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.

[00:24] Are you ready for part two of Canadian pinball podcast return?

[00:28] This is going to be an awesome episode because what we're going to do in this episode, we're

[00:33] going to go down a list of all the things that have been on my mind when it comes to pinball

[00:39] and pinball collecting that has taken place over the last two months.

[00:43] I'm going to call this Canadian top 10 things that happened over the last two months.

[00:48] We're just going to go down the list and I'm just going to give you my opinions and my

[00:52] observations about these things and we're going to tackle it and it's going to be awesome.

[00:57] But before we go down that list of Canadians top 10 things in two months, I want to just

[01:03] quickly recap what we talked about in the last episode.

[01:06] We went over the stern ghosted insert issue.

[01:10] I got a lot of emails from people back from after that podcast went up and a lot of people

[01:15] were just expressing their concerns.

[01:17] They don't think stern is going to do the right thing here.

[01:19] I've had people talk about how they've had issues with stern when it comes to decals

[01:24] and other issues.

[01:25] Some people stern has helped out.

[01:27] Other people it seems like stern has just left to dry.

[01:30] So look, I love stern and I think stern pinball is an amazing company and I just really want

[01:37] to see them do the right thing here.

[01:39] And we're going to leave it at that.

[01:40] I think the balls in their court and we have to give them some time to do the right thing.

[01:45] I really hope they don't just remain silent and handle this on a one by one basis because

[01:51] I think that's going to be a mistake and I think that's going to bite them.

[01:54] We just have to just sit tight and see what they do.

[01:59] Look at Hilton sold his America's most haunted.

[02:02] It seems like Hilton sold it for around $8,000.

[02:05] So that is a glorious moment.

[02:08] Here's the thing about Hilton and why snow.

[02:10] I don't have a problem with this guy listing his pinball machines for sale.

[02:15] What makes him an ass clown and he continues to do it in every four sale thread is he thinks

[02:21] that he needs to explain why he's selling it in a way that has him doing it for the love

[02:28] of pinball or for some other thing he needs to get.

[02:32] There's always some mission whether it's a piece of real estate or a car.

[02:35] Dude, you're making a $2,000 profit on an America's most haunted.

[02:41] Oh, good for you.

[02:42] Just say that.

[02:43] You always have to cook up another story.

[02:45] And the reason that I always say this and the reason why he annoys me to know end, he always

[02:50] says this when he's selling something.

[02:52] I need to sell a pin to get money to buy X, Y and Z.

[02:56] And then when people offer him trades, he considers the trades.

[03:01] If someone trades you another pinball machine for your America's most haunted, that doesn't

[03:06] give you cash to go get the thing that you said you need to sell this for.

[03:10] So just stop it, dude.

[03:11] Just be like, look, I'm here to sell it and I'm going to make profit.

[03:14] And you know what?

[03:15] Not a bad guy if you make a profit selling a pinball machine.

[03:18] You're actually much smarter than all the dipshits who don't make a profit and be like,

[03:24] for the level of pinball I gave up my Rob Zombie Ellie for the same price I paid for.

[03:29] Because I don't think it's right to make money on it.

[03:31] Those people, those are the stupid people.

[03:33] Okay, so let's dive right into Canada's top 10 things that I've observed over the last

[03:40] two months.

[03:41] Number 10.

[03:45] The color dots from medieval madness remake are finally out.

[03:53] And here's my opinion about these dots.

[03:57] I think they're really cool.

[03:58] I saw that when they showed the demo of what they were going to look like, they definitely

[04:01] looked much better than what even color DMD was providing for people.

[04:09] But the issue of like paying extra to get them.

[04:12] What are my thoughts on that?

[04:13] So it's hard because I don't think you have a choice.

[04:17] I really don't think you have a choice.

[04:18] I think these guys knew that anyone who has medieval madness remake is going to go in on

[04:24] this.

[04:25] I mean, how can you not?

[04:27] That being said, is it worth 200 bucks for the Ellie owners and $400 for the non-L.A.

[04:33] owners?

[04:34] I think these guys are just looking at the market and being like, well, look at all these

[04:37] people paying 400 bucks for color DMDs.

[04:41] We had to do additional work and additional programming to make this, right?

[04:46] This wasn't part of their initial programming of the game and who's going to pick up that

[04:53] cost.

[04:54] Now, I think here's my thing.

[04:56] They promise these color dots as part of the price of the machine.

[05:01] And I think that's the issue I have with Rick and Company.

[05:03] And I think these guys have probably had one of the worst launches of a company.

[05:10] I think people's experiences with them have been really shaky from it.

[05:15] And from an outsider looking in, I get some of you guys have the machine and you love

[05:18] it and you have the color dots and you like them.

[05:22] From an outsider looking in, I just wouldn't go buy another game from these guys.

[05:26] I don't care.

[05:27] I wouldn't buy a remake from them.

[05:28] After everything you guys have been through, I don't think they're winning over new customers,

[05:32] asking people to pay extra for the color dots.

[05:34] I don't think they're winning over new customers.

[05:36] And here's the other thing.

[05:38] And I saw this because people were uploading videos.

[05:41] What they sent people has issues.

[05:45] There's a lot of like tearing in the graphics and there's like parts of the colorization

[05:51] that don't go to color.

[05:53] There's parts where it looks like there's like overlap of image and score.

[05:57] So it's not even done perfect.

[06:00] And that's a joke.

[06:04] It really is.

[06:05] If you think Rick and company are going to go make that right now, I have to give them

[06:10] your money.

[06:11] I don't know.

[06:12] I mean, I hope they are going to make it right.

[06:14] So actually, I called a brick.

[06:15] I'm like Rick, after people have waited like all this time, all the patients they've had,

[06:21] are you going to go back and are you going to fix the issues with the colorization?

[06:28] And here's what his response was.

[06:30] Hey, hey, hey, you're a cantaloupe.

[06:39] Yes, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that fix to come.

[06:41] Okay, so number nine on Canadian's top 10 things is all of it was bullshit, predator and

[06:52] J-pop.

[06:53] These two threads, when I saw them popping back up and all the discussion going on, it just

[06:59] makes you want to pull your hair out.

[07:02] Why can't people just accept the fact at this point, your money is gone.

[07:08] It's gone.

[07:10] It's beyond gone.

[07:12] It's less than zero that these guys have.

[07:16] It is mind-boggling that people continue to sort of try and get some justice served here

[07:23] because it's over.

[07:26] It's over.

[07:27] There aren't people on message boards still debating on how we go after N-Rong to get

[07:31] our money back.

[07:33] Okay, so for those of you who invest in J-pop and Kevin, I feel bad for you.

[07:38] I really do.

[07:40] You guys were sold to bagelize by two individuals who came at it from different angles, but both

[07:48] had no fucking right to take people's money because they didn't have machines that were

[07:56] ever going to make it.

[07:58] Kevin is probably the harder one to detect the bullshit because he had the physical machine

[08:03] and he brought it around the shows.

[08:06] But the conversation around this, I get it, but what's left to do?

[08:12] And people who got burned, it's almost like they need to start some convulsions period

[08:19] and just letting it go and moving on with their lives because it's not going to happen,

[08:23] guys.

[08:24] You're not going to go to court.

[08:25] You're not going to get money back.

[08:27] There's nothing.

[08:28] Kevin is dead, flat broke and so is J-pop.

[08:31] These guys have nothing.

[08:33] You're not going to get anything.

[08:35] In the predator thread, the interesting thing was people are speculating that there might

[08:40] be a couple more pins that are being built.

[08:43] Clay Harrel supposedly has parts that when he's talking, he keeps saying stuff like,

[08:50] there's only two Kevin built predator games and he always uses that phrasing Kevin

[08:55] built predator games as a way to sort of, I don't know, it just sounds like really shady

[09:00] is, does he have a couple of games that he's built and then you have all those people that

[09:04] got burned or like how dare you like make a machine and it's not fair if you have one

[09:10] and I didn't get one.

[09:11] I get that.

[09:13] But let me tell you something, once and for all about predator and I know some people

[09:16] got burned.

[09:17] The game was a piece of shit.

[09:19] It always was a piece of shit.

[09:21] Every time that shows when you saw it, the game was less than homebrew crap.

[09:26] How many times did that Dingo Berry try and show off like the UV lighting on it?

[09:31] It never worked.

[09:32] He even had a big like a huge UV ceiling light and wave it across the play field to try

[09:37] and show you the green blood from the predator.

[09:40] The game was shit.

[09:41] Kevin is a piece of shit.

[09:42] He still goes around to shows and he's auctioning, he's buying games at auction.

[09:47] J-pop, I don't feel J-pop as evil as Kevin.

[09:52] I don't.

[09:53] I always have a little bit of empathy for J-pop because I still think he's a pinball genius

[09:57] that needs a company around him and he really didn't understand what he was getting himself

[10:02] into until it was too late, until it was way too late.

[10:06] But both of these machines are done.

[10:09] You're never going to see a dime back and you can keep on trying to get justice served

[10:14] but it's just not going to happen.

[10:16] It's just not going to happen.

[10:17] I've lost money in the stock market.

[10:19] I'm not going after those companies that made me lose my investment.

[10:23] It was a speculative play on everyone's part and it's just time to let it go.

[10:27] Alright, let's move on to number 8.

[10:36] Stern's next pinball machine might be Slayer.

[10:41] Really?

[10:42] So this thing, it's interesting when I saw this.

[10:47] All the speculation was around Aerosmith, maybe Motley Crew, maybe Jimmy Hendrix.

[10:53] Nobody was saying Slayer and then all of a sudden Stern goes to a Slayer concert.

[10:58] Gary Stern is seen with the founder of Slayer at Comic Con to introduce the Paps Blue Ribbon

[11:03] Machine.

[11:05] So what are my thoughts on Slayer being the possible next Stern musical pin?

[11:10] I'm not a Slayer fan at all.

[11:15] But I'm not saying that I don't think they're good.

[11:18] I think a lot of people go on there and be like, fuck Slayer, Slayer stocks.

[11:22] Look, this band sold millions of albums.

[11:23] It has tons of fans and there are Slayer fans.

[11:27] I get annoyed when people say they don't like guns and roses and I get an argument and

[11:30] arguing about musical bands and their merits.

[11:34] I think sometimes it can be a bunch of bullshit.

[11:36] And at the end of the day, if you've sold millions of albums and have millions of fans, then

[11:39] yeah, there is a fan base.

[11:40] And do I think that Slayer's fan base and pinball's fan base overlap?

[11:45] I think it does.

[11:48] But I don't have any interest in this pin.

[11:50] I don't have any interest at all.

[11:52] I actually don't really have much interest in music pins in general.

[11:54] I think I've said this before, but I just don't really like musical pins.

[11:59] I like playing pinball machines where there's more of a narrative.

[12:03] And if it's a pop culture thing like a movie or a TV show, you're playing through the narrative

[12:07] that you're familiar with.

[12:08] I just don't think musical bands have that kind of narrative that makes pinball machine

[12:14] modes that interesting.

[12:16] But that's just me.

[12:17] That's just me.

[12:18] And the other thing that's thrown and showed was Pat's Blue Ribbon.

[12:21] What are my thoughts on this one?

[12:23] So Pat's Blue Ribbon is what, $6400 bucks.

[12:26] It's a re-skin of Wo Nelly.

[12:28] Again, just really, just a lot of crickets and apathy on my part when I saw these things

[12:33] introduce.

[12:34] I just don't think that it's that exciting to me.

[12:39] But again, this is a marketing tool for Pat's Blue Ribbon.

[12:42] I don't think Stern's name is on the machine itself.

[12:45] And if you want to buy it, you buy it from Pat's.

[12:47] It's cool.

[12:48] I think it's cool that brands are using pinball machines as marketing tools and getting

[12:52] more pinball out there.

[12:53] So if you know I heard the rumors, Pat's is going to put this in some of its best customer

[12:57] bars and around the country.

[12:59] And that's a good thing.

[13:00] It's spreading pinball.

[13:01] I don't think people should look at the price and start moaning and groaning.

[13:04] This was not made for home collectors.

[13:06] This was made for Pat's Blue Ribbon to put it out into bars and to get people excited

[13:13] about their product and to have some fun by playing pinball.

[13:16] That's it.

[13:17] You can't look at this through like a lens of like, another rip off from Stern and whatnot.

[13:19] Nope.

[13:20] That's not why this pin exists.

[13:21] So I always applaud more pinball, that's going out into the world.

[13:25] Okay.

[13:26] Let's go to number seven.

[13:28] Look at this shift comes.

[13:30] It's made of iron.

[13:31] I assure you she can.

[13:33] I loved all the different images people were uploading of the Big Lebowski shift.

[13:39] That is on its way to Canada and then America.

[13:44] I believe it's carrying 20 examples of the Big Lebowski.

[13:49] So it's, wow, it seems like the Big Lebowski was revealed 10 years ago.

[13:55] And I'm happy that Dutch is finally shipping machines.

[13:59] I think it's a great thing.

[14:01] I've seen the Lebowski a few times.

[14:04] I've played it a bunch of times it shows.

[14:07] And it is the most expensive pinball machine ever sold at MSRP if I'm correct.

[14:15] Right?

[14:16] And they're charging $10,000 for this machine.

[14:17] So what are my thoughts on the Big Lebowski shipping?

[14:21] It's, I have some mixed opinions about this machine and Dutch in general.

[14:26] I just want to share them quickly.

[14:28] I'm just happy it's shipping.

[14:29] I can't wait to see people's reviews of the pin.

[14:32] That being said, people have had this pin for a while, a while in Europe.

[14:39] And from what the initial reviews were, the code was really very early on.

[14:46] And I just never really have seen any videos or hear people talk about playing the pinball

[14:52] machine and getting a lot of fun out of playing it.

[14:56] And I think it speaks to my own experiences with this pinball machine.

[15:02] It's gorgeous to look at.

[15:04] It's a very interesting theme, Lebowski.

[15:06] I mean, it's a very cult classic movie.

[15:08] It's very niche.

[15:09] It's got that sort of like dry witty sense of humor to it.

[15:13] I'm still not sure it translates as a great pinball theme.

[15:18] Where Ghostbusters is a movie with the music and the call-outs and the integration of that

[15:23] film into pinball, it's perfect.

[15:25] And within a few minutes, it's not even a few seconds once you go into Ghostbusters.

[15:32] Your blood is going, your adrenaline's rushing, and you're having fun immediately.

[15:38] When I play Lebowski, it just feels like this slow motion sort of like dude.

[15:44] And I've said this before, it's like that stone or chill kind of, I don't know, it doesn't

[15:50] get my energy going.

[15:52] And I think the whole pin just sort of, to me, just doesn't excite me yet.

[15:58] And I'm always waiting for it to just excite me.

[16:01] And that, it may be just an issue with like the theme and the call-outs and the way the

[16:07] pinball machine comes at you as an entertainment entity doesn't, I don't know, it doesn't really

[16:14] give me a rush.

[16:15] And I think pinball, because of the way the game is, needs to have a little bit more of

[16:20] that rush and urgency to like the music, to the call-outs, to like the modes.

[16:27] So I'm interested to see if they can make the modes and the code, you know, excite as

[16:34] much as the physical and visual appearance of the game.

[16:40] And I haven't seen that yet.

[16:41] The other thing is just how long it's taken Dutch to get these things out.

[16:45] And I mean, how are these guys going to stay in business when they can only trickle out

[16:51] machines at this pace?

[16:53] I just, I don't understand.

[16:54] I see these like, every time they show pictures of the factory, there was never like anyone

[16:59] working.

[17:00] There was like one guy in a laptop and then like 20 cabinets just sitting there with the

[17:04] play fields up.

[17:06] Every time I see Stern's factory, it's bustling with employees and energy and work going

[17:12] on.

[17:13] So, you know, I don't know.

[17:15] I mean, I don't know.

[17:16] I thought by now we would have seen Dutch pinball machine number two being revealed.

[17:22] And there's no, there's, look, there's no denying the quality and the craftsmanship that

[17:26] these guys are putting into it.

[17:28] But I just got to scratch my head and wonder like, can these guys last?

[17:33] Can they last?

[17:35] Shipping out pins so slowly?

[17:38] And can they last with the factory just sort of sitting idle for all those years before

[17:43] they shipped out one pin?

[17:44] I don't know how you make up that money.

[17:47] So I don't think buying a pinball machine from Europe is also something that is an easy

[17:53] process for people.

[17:54] I think, these companies in Europe, whether it's highway, whether it's Dutch, they need

[17:59] to strike really good deals with distributors and make it easier for people.

[18:04] And I think there's a golden opportunity with the Ghostbusters Ghosted Insert issue for

[18:10] all those owners who are frustrated to go give Dutch their money.

[18:15] But look, a Dutch doesn't have any product that people can go buy.

[18:19] I guarantee you, and the same thing is true with Alien, when people are fed up with

[18:24] Stern's quality and you're asking $8,000 for a Stern and you're not happy, that money

[18:28] would shift right to Dutch immediately.

[18:30] But that's just nothing to go.

[18:31] And I think that is a huge miss for this new company.

[18:35] It's August of 2016.

[18:37] They showed this game two and a half years ago.

[18:39] The fact that they can't take your money and get you a pinball machine within a week

[18:44] or two, I think is a huge miss.

[18:47] And I think is going to hurt the company.

[18:50] I really do.

[18:51] So that's what I want to say about Dutch.

[18:53] I look forward to seeing what people's reviews are, the pin ones they get it.

[18:56] But I still have yet to be excited by that pin.

[18:58] And I still think Dutch as a company is missing a huge opportunity to financially take all

[19:05] of the money from disgruntled Stern buyers.

[19:08] All right, let's go to number six.

[19:10] Do you ever ship out with Ask Before?

[19:12] I went on five times with another science officer.

[19:15] They replaced him two days before we left Thedas with Ash.

[19:18] I don't trust him.

[19:20] I don't trust anybody.

[19:22] Do you trust Andrew Highway's latest time frame for Alien?

[19:29] Let's talk about that.

[19:30] So Alien, it's been a pinball machine that we have discussed at length on this podcast.

[19:38] We've had our personal disputes with Mr. Orrick Lawson that we've sort of buried the hatchet

[19:43] on that.

[19:44] I'll say this.

[19:46] And this is something that is just part of human nature.

[19:49] I am not incapable of changing my minds on things.

[19:55] Okay.

[19:56] I might be down on the Alien Playfield artwork.

[19:59] But we were told, let's wait until it's all populated and make a decision.

[20:04] So we've seen some news about Alien sort of percolate over the summer.

[20:12] And there's been a few images from some highway pinball videos that have sort of shown some

[20:19] of the playfield or the populated machine.

[20:23] Here's what I want to say about Alien.

[20:26] First thing is I do applaud that Andrew Highway does actually talk to the community.

[20:31] I like that he comes out and he says what's going on at times.

[20:36] And I like that he doesn't say stuff when there's nothing to say.

[20:39] I like that.

[20:40] He's not just talking for the sake of talking.

[20:44] So I, Andrew, as a communicator in my professional career, I applaud you communicating what's going

[20:51] on with your company.

[20:52] I think Alien Pinball is coming out at a really interesting time if we believe the date.

[20:59] So that's the other thing I want to talk about.

[21:00] Andrew's last correspondence he indicated that the pinball machine is going to be revealed

[21:09] in September.

[21:12] He's hoping to have it shipped to customers end of October.

[21:16] And it said that they really want to make sure people are playing this by Christmas.

[21:20] So that goes, that's a little bit more of a shift.

[21:23] If you remember, Canadian pinball podcasts from a few months ago when Alien said that they

[21:28] were looking to have games revealed in August and then shipping by September.

[21:33] And I said if Alien Pinball shipped any time in September, I would not do a podcast during

[21:38] that entire month.

[21:40] So based on Andrew's recent comments, I'm safe.

[21:44] I'm good because it sounds like end of October.

[21:46] Now look, I am not rooting for this game not to ship.

[21:49] I'm not rooting for this game to be delayed at all.

[21:51] I just have never seen a new pinball company put out a date of when their pin is going to

[21:57] ship and I've never seen them hit that date, which leads me to this point.

[22:01] Andrew, why?

[22:03] Why did you even give these dates?

[22:05] I think that all pinball companies need to stop putting dates in people's heads of when

[22:12] they can expect the pin to ship.

[22:15] Because if history has taught us anything, anything delays will happen and delays will normally

[22:22] cause you to push back those dates sometimes by months, sometimes by years.

[22:30] Let me repeat that by years when delays happen.

[22:33] So I just, and I know it must be exciting and highway.

[22:37] It looks like they're getting towards some sort of finish line with the machine, but something

[22:41] could go wrong.

[22:42] I just don't even want people to think like, oh, I'm going to start having alien, it's

[22:46] going to be a green Christmas.

[22:47] I'm going to have alien by Christmas and there's going to be parties because as much as you're

[22:52] putting it out there as like a tentative timeline, I guarantee you all the fanboys in the alien

[22:58] thread are now thinking October, October, October, October, definitely by November, definitely

[23:03] by November, definitely by Thanksgiving, definitely by, and if you miss any of those dates, these

[23:08] guys are going to be cranky, they're going to bitch and they're going to mow.

[23:12] So my thing is this, if you're a new pinball manufacturer, don't say a date.

[23:17] The only date you should say is it's just have it go out.

[23:21] Just have it go out.

[23:22] People have already pre-ordered it.

[23:23] There'll be nothing better than all the alien fanboys that just get an email and be like,

[23:28] your game is ready to ship.

[23:29] You always the remainder boom.

[23:30] They would go, they would go batch it crazy.

[23:33] And it's almost better just to hold them in suspended belief about when the machine's

[23:37] going to ship.

[23:38] Just don't put the dates out there.

[23:39] I think it's the biggest mistake ever.

[23:41] Okay, the other point I want to make about alien is I think the pins looking good.

[23:44] I do.

[23:45] I think alien has an opportunity here to really, to make it den, to make it den.

[23:53] There's a lot of unhappy people in the Stern world.

[23:56] And if alien can get out and ship and ship and volume and ship quickly, I think they

[24:01] have a real opportunity here to take a lot of money and to become a legitimate player.

[24:07] But this all is on highway.

[24:09] These guys got to get games out quickly.

[24:11] They've got to show they can do that.

[24:13] They've got to get games to the US without issue.

[24:16] And they've got to make the product available.

[24:21] I mean, that's like the main thing.

[24:23] It doesn't matter if Stern could just keep making, you know, could have issues left and

[24:27] right, but you still can't go buy a new inbox pinball machine from anyone else.

[24:32] I also think that alien needs to get out before Stern shows Star Wars.

[24:37] And this is all speculation, right?

[24:38] We don't even know if Star Wars is a real thing.

[24:40] But I think alien, you know, can be the sci-fi leader and dominate and get a lot of people

[24:47] to give them their money.

[24:49] But I, my hunch was always they were going to wait too long and Stern was going to reveal

[24:53] Star Wars and that would really hurt them.

[24:56] I also thought that Ghostbusters would really crush highways orders because I thought Ghostbusters

[25:01] would just crush it.

[25:02] But I think Ghostbusters is weak right now.

[25:05] And I think people are anxious about it and uncertain about it in terms of the quality.

[25:10] And from what we've heard, full throttle quality seems to be really top notch and the customer

[25:15] service by highway is really top notch.

[25:18] So those things are going to start to, you know, inch this company closer towards people's

[25:24] dollars for sure.

[25:26] And alien is a thing that we know people will just be like, take my money if what they show

[25:29] is really awesome.

[25:30] So let's lot of excitement coming in the alien camp come September when this pinball

[25:36] machine is revealed.

[25:37] So we look forward to seeing what they show.

[25:40] And if it's a knockout and if it's exciting, you know, I think they're going to start to

[25:46] become a real legitimate number two player if they can ship this pinball machine in volume.

[25:50] All right.

[25:51] Let's go to number five.

[25:53] Five, four, three, two, one.

[26:03] Undavers are going.

[26:08] Actually, they're not going anywhere yet.

[26:12] And so number five I want to talk about just those pinball machines are just missing

[26:17] in action still.

[26:18] These are the machines that we've just heard so much about over the last couple of years.

[26:22] And they just never have materialized.

[26:24] And I'm just, you know, the threads pop up every now and then and it's just always there.

[26:30] This lingering question mark about a few pins and those pins are definitely home pins

[26:35] thunderbirds out of Australia made in China.

[26:41] Where's multi-morphic in P3?

[26:44] Jerry great guy.

[26:47] Curious as to why those things are not shipping it.

[26:50] Pinball circus.

[26:51] Where is the Python Angelo game that is being made and there's what they make in like 16

[26:57] examples of it.

[26:58] Haven't seen anything on that.

[27:02] So what are my thoughts on these machines that just continue to be enigma's right?

[27:07] They continue to be these sort of secret projects that just never can fully materialize.

[27:14] Well P3 is the only one that has been out and about.

[27:17] People have played it a lot and it just seems like there are always like 90% there.

[27:23] So I'm interested to see let's start with P3.

[27:24] So I'm interested to see, you know, where Jerry goes with it in the next like six months.

[27:31] It's getting to the point where I don't think he should go to any more shows.

[27:35] I think this whole thing has become a tour of the technology.

[27:40] But now it's time to get it out.

[27:41] And I think he knows.

[27:42] There's like nobody knows more than him.

[27:43] Nobody wants to pin out more than he does.

[27:46] But I'm just curious to see if this pin can ship.

[27:50] And I'm even more curious to see what the orders are on it because the preorder list is

[27:57] just like an email newsletter list.

[27:59] So I think he's going to have a hard time gauging how many actual buyers there are.

[28:03] I also think the longer he waits, all right, the longer he waits to get this out with

[28:10] the title theme being Lexi light speed.

[28:13] The harder and harder and harder it's going to be for him to break through.

[28:20] And I've said this before, the theme is not going to help.

[28:24] Lexi light speed is not going to help him win a war against alien, against ghost busters,

[28:31] against big Lebowski, against Hobbit, against Pat Lawler's machine.

[28:36] All these machines that are coming, it's really going to be hard to break through with

[28:41] an original IP that doesn't come from one of the most famous designers of all time.

[28:46] And I think that if I were Jerry, and all the money going to show is all the money going

[28:52] I would take that money and go get a great A license and surprise people and be like,

[28:58] actually here's this game that we did that's a theme that people have always wanted and

[29:05] here you go.

[29:06] Here's Matrix.

[29:07] I don't know.

[29:08] I just see all this money going out.

[29:09] I'm like, that money should go into theme more than anything.

[29:13] So we'll see what happens with P3.

[29:15] I hope it ships.

[29:16] Again, I want to see this in home environments.

[29:19] I don't want to see it at shows anymore.

[29:22] Because they need to get it to the finish line.

[29:25] And it needs to happen soon.

[29:26] Because I think you can't show something for three years, four years.

[29:32] Because that starts to make people feel like it feels old already.

[29:35] Or you mean coming?

[29:36] Like the Acura NSX.

[29:37] We've seen it for like eight years.

[29:38] But the time it ships, it's like, yeah, that doesn't even feel like new technology anymore.

[29:43] All right.

[29:44] So Thunderbirds, this pin, I don't know.

[29:47] I really don't, first of all, I have to say, I don't even know what the hell Thunderbirds

[29:51] was.

[29:52] Like I haven't seen the show.

[29:54] I'm not a fan of the theme.

[29:57] It seems, I don't know, it seems like I've watched some of the YouTube clips.

[30:00] It seems a little bit interesting.

[30:01] It seems like a quirky theme that could work for pinball.

[30:04] But the whole thing with Thunderbirds, it just seems like this whole thing has been a disaster

[30:09] when it comes to getting the manufacturing going.

[30:11] I mean, there's been so many setbacks and a lot of personal setbacks that I feel bad about

[30:17] with Mike and his personal life.

[30:20] And then we just heard like the programmer died.

[30:23] There's issues with like the Chinese factory, factory worker dies and then all of a sudden

[30:28] like the factory work in the family of that guy is like showing up with pitchforks.

[30:33] The whole thing just sounds like a nightmare and it just goes to show like when you're trying

[30:38] to make a pinball machine, they're not just trying to make one pinball machine like a boutique

[30:42] and sell it.

[30:43] They're trying to build a pinball factory.

[30:45] And the whole thing is just a big question mark.

[30:48] And so we just saw recently the side art of Thunderbirds and also the really cool sort of

[30:56] lighted decal effect that's on the back box side art.

[31:01] And I don't know.

[31:03] I mean, the side art looked really, really, I just want to say not up to par with what

[31:12] we're getting now from the likes of like Zombie Yeti or the side art that's available on

[31:16] the Hobbit or art is really taking a big step forward with what we're getting in the

[31:23] new machines.

[31:24] And it just looked a little childish and sort of, I don't know.

[31:27] I don't know if that's what's going to come out after all this time.

[31:32] I think Thunderbirds could have some issues.

[31:34] And I've read Mike.

[31:36] Mike was just posted a thread last night on a comment last night on Pinside, calling

[31:44] the detractors of the pinball machine like scum and stuff like, you need to hurry out

[31:47] to spoken guy.

[31:48] He doesn't really give a shit.

[31:49] And I applaud that.

[31:51] But again, if you're going to be that way, you really got to deliver.

[31:55] And so here's my concern.

[31:58] And if you read what they're going to do, they're going to reveal this pinball machine

[32:01] before it's done.

[32:02] And I think that's the biggest mistake ever.

[32:05] Mike, if you're listening to this podcast, if someone who knows you was listening to this

[32:08] podcast, don't do that.

[32:10] I work in marketing.

[32:12] This is my career.

[32:13] I'm going to give you 15 years of Canada's marketing expertise.

[32:18] And I charge a lot an hour for this to clients.

[32:23] I can never reveal something until it's fully done.

[32:26] We saw what happened with Alien.

[32:27] We do partial reveals.

[32:29] We saw what happened with Ghostbusters with Leaks.

[32:31] It does nothing for you.

[32:34] You're not going to, if you want to get orders by just having a bunch of mechanisms on

[32:38] a table and artwork that's not finally approved, what's that going to do for you?

[32:43] Look at just the history of people who have done this.

[32:45] The history of people who have revealed early before things were, you know, final.

[32:50] It's always worked against them.

[32:53] The only company that I will say like when they revealed it brought excitement was Dutch,

[32:59] but they revealed like what looked like the final pin, right?

[33:03] And who knew then that they were two years away from production, but I would not do what

[33:07] you're about to do.

[33:09] I just wouldn't.

[33:10] If you want to show one mechanism fine, if you want to show like a piece of artwork fine,

[33:14] show one thing to get people excited.

[33:16] You do not show like an empty like a cabinet that doesn't have art on it or like half a

[33:22] play field.

[33:23] I just wouldn't do it.

[33:24] I just wouldn't do it.

[33:25] I don't think I think you need to just focus on getting the thing final and then pull

[33:29] the curtain off it when it's all done.

[33:32] And that is my advice for all pinball manufacturers.

[33:35] And I applaud Andrew at highway for taking that step back and waiting.

[33:39] Just wait.

[33:40] I want to see Alien when it's done.

[33:41] I want the people want that curtain pulled off reveal moment where everything that they

[33:45] can buy is there.

[33:47] I don't want to see stuff, you know, the sausage being made as or quit say I don't want to see

[33:51] that shit because it doesn't do anything.

[33:54] It doesn't do anything.

[33:55] All right.

[33:56] So the last one is pinball circus.

[33:58] I could care less.

[34:01] My thoughts in this game are like this is like Python, angelos like crazy like wacky like

[34:06] LCD trip dream kind of machine.

[34:08] I've played it a bunch of times.

[34:10] I don't understand the machine at all.

[34:11] It drains down the middle.

[34:13] Talk about it's like the Trudeau gap on crack.

[34:17] You know this machine if you remember played it the gap between flippers is like is like

[34:20] six inches with the freaking snake in the middle.

[34:23] It doesn't shoot.

[34:25] It's a gimmick.

[34:27] It's something that if you put on location would definitely make money.

[34:29] It's sort of like hercules.

[34:30] It's a gimmick.

[34:32] It's not meant to play well.

[34:34] It's just meant to like be visually like what the fuck is that?

[34:37] Let me put a dollar in and see what happens.

[34:39] That's what that machine is.

[34:41] Alright, so let's go on to number four.

[34:44] Where did you go to if I may ask?

[34:46] Look ahead.

[34:47] I brought you back looking behind.

[34:51] I thought this is like the perfect quote to capture what I think has been going on with

[34:57] the Hobbit and Jersey Jack pinball as a company.

[35:01] And I've been very skeptical of the Hobbit and Jersey Jack's approach over the years.

[35:08] And I bet he also wishes he could have done things differently and I think he's learned

[35:13] a lot through this whole endeavor.

[35:18] And it has been an unexpected journey probably for his life and for the people around in

[35:23] his family and friends and for the workers at JJP.

[35:26] I will say this though.

[35:29] There's a few ways to skin the JJP cat.

[35:34] Right now, if I look at this company in August of 2016, I have to say that I have changed

[35:41] my opinion of Jersey Jack pinball.

[35:45] I haven't grown in love with the Hobbit per se.

[35:50] I still like machines that have a little bit more to shoot at.

[35:55] But from what I'm hearing about the Hobbit code updates from those who own it, it sounds

[36:01] like things are moving in a really, really good direction.

[36:04] And I don't think there was any doubt that Keith would be able to make a machine really

[36:09] fun and to code it in an amazing way.

[36:12] And you got Keith, you got Lyme, and you got a few guys who really know how to make pinball

[36:18] machines sing with code.

[36:21] And so it's coming along.

[36:22] And that's great.

[36:23] And I'm happy that owners are getting machines and owners are receiving pinball machines that

[36:29] I believe are worth the money.

[36:33] And if you put the Hobbit next to Ghostbusters in terms of pricing, you still see the quality

[36:42] in JJP.

[36:43] It is of a higher level of materials.

[36:48] You don't have to go any further than just the decals on a JJP machine versus the decals

[36:53] on a stern machine.

[36:55] But again, the pricing is different on these two companies.

[37:01] So when stern sells you a game of a pro at what, like, it's around the $5,000 price range,

[37:08] yeah, that's fine.

[37:10] Jack can give you higher grade materials if you're charging $3,000 more.

[37:15] But the where stern alleys are now compared to $8,000 and JJP is right around there.

[37:22] I think JJP quality is the best in the business right now.

[37:28] And what I like about Jack too is that he gives you options.

[37:31] And as a pinball buyer, I like that.

[37:34] If I'm going to spend a lot of money, I want to option it out the way I want it.

[37:39] And that is something that happens in any aspect of our lives when we buy things that are

[37:44] premium, whether it's a home, whether it's a car, you know, whether, I don't know what

[37:50] I also want to say, but those are two good examples, right?

[37:52] When you, the whole thing with like, if you go buy a Porsche or Ferrari, go look at all

[37:57] the options you can do to make the car the way you want it.

[38:01] When it comes to stern, really like what options do you have when I buy an $8,000 Ghostbusters

[38:06] alleys?

[38:07] There's only like one thing I can get and that's an additional $500, or a topper that's

[38:12] not even, you know, it doesn't make, that's available to any Ghostbusters.

[38:17] I love that Jack offers the rad cows.

[38:19] I love that he offers like the Playfield protector.

[38:22] I love that he offers you the ability to do things that make the machine look even nicer.

[38:28] I think in the future, if I were to give Jack some advice, the next step too is, you know,

[38:34] really offer the ability to customize armor, customize railing material like I still think

[38:40] the hobby would look amazing if it was fully braced.

[38:43] And I'm waiting for the day where these companies really do offer like full brass treatment

[38:48] for an additional $1,500, because I think people would do it.

[38:53] But imagine how amazing Ghostbusters side art would look on the alleys if it had rad

[38:58] cows.

[38:59] And if Gary offered people the chance to get rad cows slimer artwork just on the alleys,

[39:06] everybody would buy it.

[39:08] Everybody.

[39:09] They would hand over their money.

[39:10] So I applaud JJP for giving people those options.

[39:15] The code is coming along great.

[39:16] I've yet to play one.

[39:18] I hope to play one soon.

[39:19] I need to play one in a home environment.

[39:21] So that's Canada coming from New York City.

[39:23] If you have a Hobbit and you're new Jersey, you're new York, you're close enough for

[39:28] me to take the Hellcat too within an hour or two.

[39:31] I happily drive and play one in someone's home environment.

[39:34] So hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com and let me come play it.

[39:39] I don't want to start giving comments on the code if I can't play it.

[39:42] But I hear nothing but good things.

[39:44] The other thing that has made me turn the corner on jack has been his customer service.

[39:49] And again, I have to applaud him for doing things right.

[39:53] He made a video that basically said, look, there are issues with the Hobbit.

[39:57] And here is what they are and we're working to fix it.

[40:01] And that level of transparency and that level of customer service is much needed in the pinball

[40:08] world.

[40:09] And maybe it's a response to all the issues going on with Dern and me, but that's fine.

[40:13] That's I'm okay with that.

[40:14] I think Jack is doing the right thing.

[40:17] And I really am looking forward now to Pat Lawler's pin.

[40:22] I'm going to in a separate podcast.

[40:24] I'll share my thoughts on all the Lawler speculation and I know that could have been one

[40:30] of the numbers here on my top 10.

[40:32] But I want to save that for another time.

[40:37] But I just want to say kudos to Jack and team and kudos to Jersey Jack pinball as a

[40:43] company for getting Hobbits out there for addressing customer service issues that popped

[40:48] up.

[40:50] And for giving people, I believe they're money's worth in terms of the quality of these

[40:56] machines.

[40:57] Okay.

[40:58] There's just nothing like it that is out there and available right now.

[41:02] Okay.

[41:03] So let's go to number three because I got to get to work.

[41:04] So I want to get through these pretty quickly.

[41:06] All right.

[41:07] So number three is actually I'm going to do a little quick phone interview.

[41:10] I'm going to call Rare Hero up and I'm going to ask him what his thoughts are on the

[41:18] Ghostbusters code and how it works with the ladder system.

[41:22] So hold on.

[41:23] I'm just going to patch him in real quick.

[41:25] Hold on.

[41:26] Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome to Canada's pinball podcast Rare Hero, also known

[41:32] as Greg.

[41:33] Works on the family guy show, prolific pinball collector, outspoken community member.

[41:40] Greg, welcome to the show.

[41:41] I want to just ask you first, what are your thoughts on Ghostbusters code and the way

[41:47] it's a ladder system and you can't select the modes when you play that machine.

[41:52] Right.

[41:53] No, I know Greg that.

[41:59] That's a really good point.

[42:00] Well, do you think that John Trudeau is listening, you think Dwight is listening who actually

[42:06] coded the game and that they're going to make the change that you want to see in the

[42:09] game?

[42:11] Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know it worked well in Lord the Rings like you were just saying

[42:24] there, but it seems like the way they have the scoring going, it's really hard to do

[42:29] it because if you randomize it, the points wouldn't really work out well.

[42:33] Well, let me just say this Greg, so all this being said, if they don't do it, if they

[42:39] don't fix it and make it selectable modes, are you still going to buy a Ghostbusters and

[42:44] are you going to still keep responding eight times a day to every thread about it?

[42:50] So that's what everyone wants to know.

[42:51] Are you going to still buy one?

[42:58] Totally fair points Greg.

[42:59] Well Greg, I want to thank you for coming on the show and we look forward to see if there

[43:04] is going to be a Ghostbusters in your game room one day.

[43:06] All right, let's move on to number two right now.

[43:11] Number two is just going to be the price bubble and all the four sale threads I've been seeing.

[43:17] I love it whenever someone tries to sell something and everyone chimes in with something like

[43:20] this.

[43:21] I like to bite your nibbles off.

[43:24] You know, it's hard to look at the pinball hobby now and not just zoom out and say to

[43:31] ourselves, what the fuck are we doing guys?

[43:35] What the fuck?

[43:36] What?

[43:37] Everything now is so expensive and can this hobby sustain itself?

[43:44] And I know this is a question and you know, you got guys like the black night who have been

[43:48] around the block and seen the bubble burst, but it's getting to the point now or I think

[43:53] it's really hard to justify what these machines are costing and I just don't think that any

[43:59] machine is going to be able to bring the level of enjoyment that these prices are demanding

[44:08] and it's just getting out of hand.

[44:11] And when I took two months off and I was just thinking to myself, like, all right, I'm

[44:16] looking at my checking account, I'm looking at my savings account, I'm looking at what

[44:20] I have in my life and I'm looking at the joy things bring for how much they cost.

[44:24] I just always have a hard time justifying that these new machines are like $8,9, $10,000.

[44:33] I really do.

[44:34] As much as like, I think, yeah, like I love Jersey Jack quality, I love the Dutch quality.

[44:38] It's one game.

[44:40] It's one game.

[44:42] All right.

[44:43] I am going to be honest and say I get as much if not more pleasure from playing one Xbox

[44:50] game or one PlayStation 4 game for 50 bucks.

[44:54] I mean, for $8,000, you could buy a Neo Geo and almost an entire library of its games

[45:03] that would also be holding value.

[45:07] But I just think it's kind of silly how much we spend on one pinball machine, one.

[45:14] And for those of us who live within close proximity to games on location, which is popping

[45:19] up more and more, I think it's even harder to justify what these machines are costing.

[45:24] And the price bubble is going to happen.

[45:26] There is no doubt about it.

[45:29] There is just no way that we're going to see people buying pinball machines for $67,8,000,

[45:35] $9,000, playing them for a year and then selling them and expecting to get what they pay

[45:39] for them back.

[45:40] There's just no way that's going to happen because there's so many new pins coming out.

[45:45] This isn't like the arcade world where an environmental disc of tron is just always

[45:50] going to hold its value because there are no new arcade games coming out that are home

[45:55] collected.

[45:57] So it's a dead industry right now for the home collector.

[46:02] But pinball, to me, what excites me the most about pinball is the future.

[46:06] So I also think it's stupid to stockpile like every new and box game that comes out knowing

[46:14] that there's so much more to get excited about and wait for if it was cheaper to do it.

[46:20] If it was like a, if you could lease a new pinball machine, imagine if you could rent every

[46:25] new and box pinball machine for a year for like $1,000 or $2,000, would you do it?

[46:30] I don't know.

[46:32] It might be an interesting thing to look at.

[46:34] I mean, people lease cars that they don't want to keep forever.

[46:36] So it's just sort of getting to the point now where three pinball machines can cost you

[46:42] almost $30,000.

[46:45] And you look at machines like, you know, a medieval man is Adam's family, you know, all the

[46:50] old classics tells the Caribbean Knights, you know, these machines when they were new,

[46:53] like 20 years ago were like $2,000, $3,000.

[46:56] You could have so many pins.

[47:00] Inflation doesn't even come close to matching up where these pins are right now.

[47:05] So I just think that the prices are getting out of hand.

[47:07] I think the bubble is going to burst.

[47:08] I don't know when though.

[47:10] I mean, if someone has the money to spend $8,000 on an America's most honoured, open

[47:15] that box up and lose $2,000 in a second, then maybe we still got some ways to go.

[47:21] But that's my thing is, I just think all of this stuff is overpriced.

[47:25] I think it's stupid.

[47:27] For $8,000, you can go on a vacation that'll change your life.

[47:30] You can do so many things with that money.

[47:33] And I think that pinball machines, when I still look at them now, I still think that the

[47:37] premium machine should be between $5,000 and $6,000 and the pro machine should be between

[47:42] $3,000 and $4,000.

[47:43] I really do.

[47:44] I really do.

[47:45] The assembly lines, the efficiency is in making these things.

[47:49] Should not be driving the price up.

[47:51] And when it comes to stern, you can't drive the price up and the quality down.

[47:55] I mean, that's just like, nothing's going to make the bubble burst faster than that.

[47:59] So our last topic, number one, and I'm going to keep this one under an hour, which I'm

[48:04] happy about, is this.

[48:21] This thread about helping Steve, what is pinside in Balboa rules or something, get his grail,

[48:31] Rocky Balboa pinned back.

[48:34] I think encapsulates everything that I think is so fucked up about this hobby and the collecting

[48:40] community.

[48:41] And I want to talk about this because it's just, it just boils my blood to see this

[48:50] kind of stuff happen.

[48:53] So for you guys who didn't see this thread and don't really follow pinside, Steve, he has

[49:00] this dream pen, this is Rocky Balboa pen, it's like beautifully restored pinball machine.

[49:04] And he had to sell it to a friend to pay some bills.

[49:08] And so he's been without it for a while.

[49:11] And he's been going through a lot of medical issues, which man, like I feel sorry about, he's

[49:16] telling his story and all he wants to get back in the world is this pinball machine that

[49:23] he loves.

[49:24] And there's a beautiful story.

[49:25] It about his father and their relationship to the Rocky movies and how this pinball machine

[49:31] and that theme makes him really happen.

[49:32] And look, I get all that.

[49:34] And I think that's a wonderful thing.

[49:36] We all should have things that we bond with our loved ones over.

[49:40] And look, material items can mean a lot.

[49:45] And I say this, as I'm going through something in my personal life, my uncle actually passed

[49:50] away. And my mom is going through all the remaining things of my aunt and uncle and watching

[49:56] her respond to things that bring back memories of her sister and her father and the attachment

[50:01] she has to it.

[50:02] So I totally get that.

[50:03] I'm not one of those people that's like, you should have placed an emphasis on material

[50:06] things.

[50:07] That's bullshit.

[50:08] Things remind us of people and the power and the bond of those things is really important.

[50:13] And so to get his pin back though, Steve created a GoFundMe page asking people to help him

[50:21] to help raise money for him to get his grail pinball machine back.

[50:25] Yes, I have an issue with that.

[50:28] I don't think anyone in the pinball community should be spending their money to help someone

[50:35] get a pinball machine back.

[50:37] And I say this because it's just not what people should be using their money for.

[50:43] And look, I get it.

[50:44] It's your money.

[50:45] You can give it to what you want.

[50:46] But I just think asking people for their money to help you get a pinball machine back

[50:51] when you're suffering from medical issues and you've got bills that are far more important.

[50:56] I just don't ever want to see anyone ever get to that point in their life.

[51:01] And so that's one of the things about this hobby that I noticed from this thread is,

[51:05] I really think people need to take better care of themselves.

[51:10] And I'm going to use this thread as an example of it.

[51:13] But I mean, I've gone to expose, I've gone to shows.

[51:16] I see the hobby and we see it all the time.

[51:21] People in this hobby at a young age, a lot of them have like,

[51:26] there's people that have medical issues that are developing much earlier than they should.

[51:30] And look, this isn't stuff like, you know, stuff like cancer,

[51:35] which I've had friends who've gotten cancers at young ages.

[51:37] And this is stuff that like, people can prevent, take good care of yourselves people.

[51:43] You don't want to get to the point where you have like medical bills

[51:46] and you're developing medical issues like in your mid-40s

[51:50] because you're not taking care of yourself.

[51:53] And I believe that people who spend more time playing pinball than exercising

[52:00] who are spending more time playing pinball than eating healthy.

[52:04] I believe your lives are going to be broken

[52:06] and you're not going to have the years and the time to enjoy the things you do

[52:10] and enjoy your loved ones and your family members if you don't take care of yourself.

[52:15] And you have to put health and you have to put that way above pinball.

[52:20] And that's another thing that upset me about these threads is like,

[52:23] for some people in this world, I think they put pinball ahead of way too many things.

[52:28] So I don't think we should help them get back a pinball machine.

[52:31] If it was like, I need money to pay my medical bills or go through an operation,

[52:36] I could see people helping chip in for stuff like that.

[52:39] But to get back a pinball machine just doesn't seem like how we should be encouraging it.

[52:44] And I'm looking at guys like Beasel Boobe, you know, this guy, I can't,

[52:48] I don't even go off on this guy, like forget this guy.

[52:50] But he's like encouraging it.

[52:51] Like, yeah, good for you, man.

[52:53] Good for you, setting up this GoFundMe page.

[52:56] No, I don't think we should be celebrating it.

[52:59] I think that it's also sad that we got memory.

[53:02] He has to like sell a baseball card collection to raise money.

[53:07] If you, and I'm going to say this, and again, this is just my thoughts, my opinions.

[53:12] You can disagree with it and that's fine.

[53:14] You can think I'm an idiot and that's fine.

[53:16] I just don't think that your main equity in life,

[53:22] all the money you have should be tied up in a pinball machine.

[53:26] So when I see this story and he needs just $4,000 to buy back Rocky Balboa pinball,

[53:35] to me that says that he doesn't have any money for the other things in his life that are

[53:40] really important, but he's going to sink it all into a pinball machine.

[53:45] That to me is just crazy.

[53:48] And we shouldn't be applauding that or trying to help him get there.

[53:54] All right?

[53:55] Now, if this friend of his who's such a good friend knows his situation, knows that all he

[54:02] wants is to wake up and see this machine in his home, why doesn't his good friend just

[54:06] give him back the fucking machine and be like, you can pay me back over time.

[54:09] And don't give him this whole like, oh, I don't want to pay it back over time.

[54:11] I want to know that I own it all.

[54:14] Just get over that pride issue, man.

[54:16] Just be a good friend and give him the machine back and do it in installments.

[54:21] Because right now it sounds like all the money this guy has in the world is going to go

[54:25] into a pinball machine when it sounds like he needs money for other things that are much

[54:28] more important that are probably much more pressing to his family.

[54:32] And I think this just speaks to the complete dichotomy of this whole hobby.

[54:36] And we see it every day.

[54:37] I've never been in a hobby that had a mixture of millionaires and people who have to sell

[54:43] baseball cards just to survive.

[54:45] You don't get that on the Hellcat form.

[54:49] You don't get that in the car collecting forms.

[54:52] Pinball is like this weird, weird hobby because you can buy a pinball machine for $200

[54:56] and you can buy a pinball machine for $50,000.

[54:59] So everyone, I love the fact that it's all inclusive.

[55:02] I love that there's people from all walks of life.

[55:04] But if there's something that I've seen be more the stereotype of the pinball collector,

[55:11] it's that people don't take care of themselves.

[55:13] And yes, this is Canada's standing on a little bit of a pedestal right now, just encouraging

[55:17] everyone and asking everybody to just take care of your health first.

[55:22] You have to put that ahead of it.

[55:23] And when I go to shows and I see guys who are like 45 years old with like walking sticks,

[55:29] walking sticks, like shoving beer and pizza into their faces all day long, are you kidding

[55:33] me?

[55:34] And then guys bring in like chairs.

[55:35] I saw a guy bring a chair to sit down in because he couldn't like physically stand

[55:41] up and wait to play a machine at an expo.

[55:44] Guys, time out, time out.

[55:49] Everyone should put their health ahead of pinball.

[55:52] And that's the last point I'm going to make about the observation I've made is when I see

[55:56] this stuff pop up and I see people's health declining.

[56:00] But when I see people putting pinball ahead of their health, it irks me to know in because

[56:06] life is short.

[56:07] Every day above ground as Pippo says is a blessing and you really should put your health ahead

[56:14] of all of this stuff.

[56:16] All this stuff means nothing if you're not going to be around to enjoy it.

[56:20] So that's Canada just asking everyone to take care of themselves and don't ever put

[56:24] yourself in a position where you have to ask strangers to financially help you out.

[56:30] That's not where we want to end up in the world and it's not where pinball should lead

[56:35] us.

[56:36] Okay?

[56:37] So that's part two of Canada's return.

[56:40] I hope to get some interviews up for you guys soon.

[56:43] I've had a lot of members ask to come on the show and we're going to get all of you on.

[56:48] I want to say that I miss one member or one listener, Max.

[56:54] Max sent me an email and he said, I'm never listening to another Canada's pinball podcast

[56:58] after what you did on pinside.

[57:01] Max is referring to it when I'm on pinside a couple days ago and put up a funny picture

[57:05] making fun of Hilton.

[57:06] Look, if you're disgusted by my going on pinside with a duplicate account and having some fun,

[57:13] then yeah, this isn't the right podcast for you.

[57:16] There's plenty of other podcasts that you can listen to.

[57:19] Sorry, Max, that we got too sarcastic for your taste.

[57:22] I also want to say thanks to Pete.

[57:24] Pete is a pinside.

[57:26] Member Pete is a Canadian pinball podcast listener.

[57:29] Pete lives locally.

[57:30] He came over yesterday to hang out and plays some of the tales of the Arabian Knights.

[57:34] We had an awesome time.

[57:36] Anyone who's local wants to come by or is traveling through New York City, happy to give you

[57:40] a beer and some pinball for free and just talk about the hobbies.

[57:44] It's really awesome just meeting people in person because I say this.

[57:47] Out of all my friends, I don't have really any that I can talk to pinball about in New York

[57:50] City.

[57:52] Interviews will go up.

[57:54] The only issue that's holding me up there is the computer that I use for interviews is

[57:58] Brenda's computer and Brenda is trapped in Ireland.

[58:01] She went there for a few weeks and she can't get back in because of her visa and she's

[58:07] waiting for approval.

[58:08] I heard today that knock on wood that it was approved.

[58:11] Hopefully she's back by the weekend.

[58:16] Thank you, everybody.

[58:17] Everybody who listens to this podcast and enjoys it.

[58:21] This is part two of Canada's return and we will be back real soon with some more provocative

[58:27] pinball commentary.

[58:28] Have a good day.

[58:30] Furthermore, you can all go fuck yourselves.
