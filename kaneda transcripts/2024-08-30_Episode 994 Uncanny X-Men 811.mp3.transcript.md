[00:00] O.M.G. Stern Pimbald just said, Hold my beer Jersey Jack, if you're just gonna show flippers

[00:28] and UV light and armor, we're gonna show off a mechanism.

[00:34] A sentinel coming up from underneath the playfield, where clearly the mouth of the sentinel is

[00:42] going to open up and you're gonna be able to shoot the Pimbald into its mouth.

[00:47] They couldn't get the shark to eat the damn ball, but the sentinel will, but O.M.G. people.

[00:54] What a great teaser trailer from Stern.

[00:58] And clearly, Cactus Pimbald podcast has had an impact on the Pimbald world.

[01:03] Now we're getting earlier images of games.

[01:07] They're starting to realize we've got to get people excited more than just the theme.

[01:14] Let's show them some of the magic.

[01:17] Let's let everybody dream about this game.

[01:19] And I was just talking to George Gomez and he said to me, and I mean this, he said, Chris,

[01:25] we heard you.

[01:26] We heard you on a thousand L.E.s.

[01:30] And now Stern Pimbald is going to make 811 uncanny X-Men L.E.s.

[01:39] And the 811 signifies from the comic book, Earth 811.

[01:45] It's like a different moment in the multiverse in which the sentinels take over Earth.

[01:51] And the X-Men have to work extra hard to defeat the evil presence of the sentinels.

[01:57] And I'm just going to say this, everybody, we moaning, groan, we complain a lot.

[02:03] We want magic in these games.

[02:06] We want physical mechanisms that interact with the ball.

[02:10] We don't want a thousand L.E.s. of every single game.

[02:15] Stern Pimbald has listened.

[02:18] This game is not going to be empty.

[02:21] It's not going to be without mechanisms.

[02:24] And I'm just super excited right now because we're going to get next week Jersey Jack versus

[02:30] Stern.

[02:32] Who's going to show the game that really wows people.

[02:35] And it's going to be competitive, right?

[02:37] Because we know that Jersey Jack has absolutely the nicer platform and it has the ability

[02:43] to make a game that's just going to be gorgeous.

[02:46] But Stern Pimbald's got Jack Danger.

[02:49] And his designs in just one game have really excited people.

[02:54] Stern's got a really great coding department.

[02:58] Now albeit they're going to make you pay probably a thousand or $2,000 for a topper to unlock

[03:04] another mode in the game.

[03:06] But just looking at this uncanny X-Men, yes, it's not X-Men 97.

[03:11] And you heard it here first.

[03:12] I love that people just do not want to give credit to Canatus Pimbald podcast.

[03:18] Did you see the petty move by Don's Pimbald podcast?

[03:22] Someone sent this to me.

[03:23] So he uploaded on Facebook the exclusive image that I had of Jersey Jack's Avatar game.

[03:31] And he removed the Canatus Pimbald podcast logo from the image.

[03:37] I don't understand why I'm still living rent free in this guy's head.

[03:41] But when you make a petty move like that, you look like a real big baby.

[03:46] Don, you just got to get over it.

[03:47] I don't know who touched Don and Jengiz in a really weird spot.

[03:51] But these guys are still babies and can't get over the fact that this is the world's

[03:56] number one Pimbald podcast because we gave you that information, right?

[04:00] He didn't have it.

[04:01] And look, if Don's Pimbald podcast broke an image and had an exclusive thing, I would

[04:07] absolutely give him credit.

[04:09] It just goes to show you what babies and what petty men they are over there.

[04:15] Don and Jengiz.

[04:16] Anyway, let's get back to this.

[04:17] So Stern Pimbald has got a teaser out today and look, they never did this before.

[04:23] When Stern used to tease games, they would just unveil the title, but they went a step

[04:28] further and they said, hold my beer Jersey Jack.

[04:32] And they now revealed an element of the game that is getting everybody excited.

[04:37] And again, just want to remind everybody, this is great.

[04:40] This is what we want.

[04:42] We want to have more to chew on.

[04:44] You can't just give us nothing and expect people to hand over money and just expect

[04:50] people to get excited.

[04:51] And if you can hear the excitement in my voice, it's because the Pimbald world is changing.

[04:57] These companies are realizing that we don't want to spend this much money and not get

[05:03] anything.

[05:04] And you got to put mechanical magic into the games.

[05:06] You got to have great themes.

[05:08] You got to go the extra mile if you really want to succeed now.

[05:12] And look, all that news about Costco and the news about other things, it's not the real

[05:17] news.

[05:18] The real news is this.

[05:20] Jack Danger's second game, Uncanny X-Men, major mechanism in the game.

[05:26] George Gomez is saying, wait until you see the entire thing.

[05:29] Now, look, George Gomez always tells me, wait until you see the entire thing.

[05:33] He of course loves every single game they make, but I really do see the effort.

[05:39] I see Circus Voltaire ringmaster vibes when I'm looking at this Sentinel.

[05:44] I see that mouth.

[05:46] It looks like it's going to open up.

[05:48] It looks like you're going to lock balls inside it.

[05:50] That feels like it's going to be a fun, great Pimbald moment.

[05:53] Part of me was like, well, what happens when you shoot in and it's not open?

[05:56] Is it going to like scratch and dent up that Sentinel?

[06:00] I don't know.

[06:01] But right now, the Sentinel, the shading on it is awesome.

[06:05] It looks like a comic book character.

[06:07] They did a really good job.

[06:09] Knowing that Zambietti is doing the art package on this game, we can see some of his artistic

[06:14] expertise taking place on those X-Men characters.

[06:18] It looks really good.

[06:19] Obviously, his art style is perfect for the Uncanny X-Men.

[06:23] Here we are.

[06:24] Are you ready?

[06:25] 9, 4, 24.

[06:27] Next, what?

[06:28] Tuesday, we are going to see this game.

[06:30] Now, the question becomes is this?

[06:32] Are we going to see the full reveal of Avatar?

[06:34] If you're Jersey Jack, you got to just reveal it now.

[06:37] You can't wait.

[06:39] You really need to reveal it now.

[06:41] If I was Jersey Jack, I would reveal Avatar tomorrow.

[06:44] I would just get it out in front of this or reveal it Monday, but I wouldn't wait.

[06:49] But I wouldn't wait until after X-Men.

[06:52] And it's great because here's the thing.

[06:53] The battleground is going to be interesting because if you think about it, what's the

[06:57] better theme?

[06:59] Uncanny X-Men or Avatar?

[07:01] I would absolutely say Uncanny X-Men is the better theme for most people because it's

[07:07] just iconic and it's been around for a really long time.

[07:11] And people have an emotional connection to these X-Men characters.

[07:14] Okay, so that means when it comes to theme, Stern has the advantage.

[07:19] When it comes to designers, Jack Danger versus Mark Seiden, right now we don't know what

[07:25] Mark is capable of.

[07:27] We know what Jack is capable of and it's really amazing.

[07:30] So I would have to say that from a designer standpoint, Stern Pinball once again looks

[07:36] like they're going to win in that category.

[07:38] Now look, we obviously don't know.

[07:39] We will know when we see Mark Seiden's game.

[07:42] So that's looking good for Stern Pinball.

[07:44] When it comes to the artistic category, we know Zambietti is amazing.

[07:48] He's been on a lot of Stern machines and there is Zambietti fatigue happening in the Pinball

[07:54] world, but it's X-Men and it's perfect for him.

[07:58] And it's going to be a game that complements all of his comic book games like Venom and

[08:03] Avengers and Deadpool.

[08:04] I don't really love the Avengers artwork.

[08:06] I got to be honest, I think it's one of Zambietti's worst art packages.

[08:10] Don't kill me, Jeremy.

[08:11] You know, I think they're beautiful games, especially Deadpool and this feels like it's

[08:16] going to be Deadpool on crack.

[08:18] So we've got that.

[08:19] We know the artist for Avatar is also really, really good.

[08:23] Like they share the link.

[08:24] I think his name is Leaf and his artwork is phenomenal.

[08:28] I think Avatar is going to look beautiful.

[08:30] You might be a little bit monochromatic in that it's going to be mostly blue and there's

[08:35] no way Avatar with the characters in it.

[08:38] Like I said, you can't name four Avatar characters.

[08:41] I think you're going to get a lot more excited when you see the X-Men characters all over

[08:46] the Stern machine.

[08:48] So we've got that, you know, the music, you know, it's going to be really, really awesome

[08:54] next week for us as consumers to watch these two companies battle it out.

[08:59] And now we know there's only going to be 811.

[09:02] It's funny saying only 811.

[09:05] That's 11 more than they made of Star Wars.

[09:08] But it is this and I mean this and I mean this sincerely and I know some of my pinball

[09:13] podcast followers are very skeptical people, very cynical.

[09:18] I'm looking at you, Bond.

[09:19] I'm looking at you, Jaeger Meister.

[09:21] The thing is this, Stern is making a move in the right direction.

[09:27] And when someone makes a move in the right direction, we need to give them credit.

[09:32] I think it is awesome that Stern is making 811 and not 1000.

[09:38] Just doing that alone makes the Ellie feel special.

[09:42] And following this up with 1000 Avatar CEs instantly makes that Avatar not feel as special,

[09:53] as rare, as exclusive.

[09:55] So a really good move by Stern Pinball.

[09:58] Now look, Jersey Jack has not released Avatar yet.

[10:04] If I were them and I saw this move, I would cut back the number of Avatar CEs.

[10:12] I know it's beautiful.

[10:14] I know you want to put it in as many places as possible, but I would cut it back and I

[10:20] would make it 500.

[10:22] I think there should only be 500 CEs of any Jersey Jack game moving forward, especially

[10:28] at $15,000 a pop.

[10:31] Because all of a sudden now, right, it's weird how it works.

[10:34] It's weird how marketing works.

[10:36] It's all optics.

[10:38] It's all perception.

[10:39] All of a sudden, 811 uncanny X-Men Lees feels a lot harder to get your hands on than 1000

[10:50] John Wick Lees, 1000 James Bond, 1000 Foo Fighters, 1000 Venoms.

[10:57] So it's a good move by Stern.

[10:59] So they've got that in their favor.

[11:01] And we're going to get this game next Tuesday.

[11:04] So this is awesome.

[11:05] This is a good time to be alive in Pinball.

[11:08] The prices are stupid.

[11:09] I'm not going to stop making fun of the prices, but man, oh man, oh man, we've got a new Stern

[11:14] machine and a new Jersey Jack machine both coming out and being revealed to us in September.

[11:21] And most likely early September, we're going to see both titles.

[11:25] Everybody else.

[11:26] I mean, is everybody else that's waiting to drop?

[11:28] How many of you again want to pay for your Pulp Fiction Lees?

[11:31] I really, I really feel like Pulp Fiction Lees is the biggest, weirdest thing to pay

[11:37] for right now because it has no, it has no mojo.

[11:41] Like it just doesn't feel cool anymore to unbox a Pulp Fiction because it's been out

[11:48] for two years.

[11:49] And look, everyone can agree with this.

[11:51] Like there's a shelf life for enthusiasm around a pinball machine.

[11:55] So I'm super excited to see what happens next week.

[11:58] I think we have to look at this Stern machine and instantly say, hey, they put an awesome

[12:03] mech in it.

[12:04] That mech looks cooler than the building in Godzilla.

[12:08] It's going to have awesome artwork.

[12:10] We know the coding is going to be great.

[12:12] And I don't know, man, I'm just excited.

[12:13] I don't know.

[12:14] I don't want to be upset about pinball.

[12:16] I think for this much money, games need to come out that excite us.

[12:20] And I think it's going to be awesome watching Avatar Battle X-Men for the money of the pinball

[12:26] buying demographic.

[12:28] In the end, in the end, what is good is I think all these companies are starting to listen

[12:34] and they're all going to have to adjust their ways.

[12:37] If they want to keep each and every one of us even remotely interested in buying new

[12:43] and box games every single year.

[12:46] And that's it.

[12:47] That's when it comes down to you.

[12:48] Stern had it so good.

[12:50] I think they pushed too far.

[12:52] Same with Jersey Jack.

[12:53] They all went too expensive, too many games, too much supply.

[12:57] And then you look down at the games and there's like no mechanisms in them.

[13:00] They're pretty much empty, right?

[13:02] Everything's on the screen.

[13:04] Everything's artwork.

[13:05] Everything's this.

[13:06] Now we have what looks like to be one of the coolest mechanisms Stern has ever made.

[13:11] That's a good thing.

[13:12] And now, now the ball is in JJP's court.

[13:16] Is there going to be an OMG mechanism in Avatar, right?

[13:20] It can't just be UV lighting and ramps.

[13:23] Like that's not going to cut it.

[13:25] It really isn't.

[13:26] And Jersey Jack, remember the starting point to get into a Jersey Jack game is like $12,000.

[13:35] That's twice as much money as a Stern Pro.

[13:38] So you would expect there to be almost twice as much in that Jersey Jack game mechanically.

[13:45] So it's going to be a great week, everybody.

[13:48] What a great way to go into Labor Day weekend.

[13:52] Let's all enjoy the beautiful weather.

[13:54] Let's enjoy our families, have some beer, have some wine, have some barbecue, have some

[13:59] fun.

[14:00] And then next week, we're going to get these games.

[14:03] It's going to be great.

[14:04] I can't wait to cover it.

[14:06] Everybody enjoy your Labor Day weekend.

[14:09] Canada will be back next week with some more shows covering these two games.

[14:15] And to the boutique company, we will not mention who didn't want to launch their game in all

[14:21] of this frenzy.

[14:23] Good luck.

[14:24] Nobody's going to buy that video game theme that nobody wants when you finally do release

[14:29] it.

[14:30] It's over.
