[00:00] All right, so this is gonna be episode 521 take two of Canadian Spinball podcasts.

[00:29] Now the reason why we're doing this part again the whole show is not gonna be different, but I do have to clarify

[00:36] Some stuff that's really important to clarify because on this episode I titled it the drama down under now

[00:43] I have to say that title is appropriate because there is some damn pinball drama going on

[00:49] Down there in Australia and you know my Australian brothers and sisters down there

[00:53] You know I love you I wake up

[00:55] I love the fact that these guys are up when I'm up at like four in the morning

[00:59] They're the only people in the pinball world I can talk to you

[01:02] But here's what happened to me yesterday someone shared some text messages that were insinuating that pinball sales Australia

[01:10] Sold people multiple guns and roses machines and and they took $500 to cut the line to get those multiple machines now

[01:18] Since seeing those text message chains

[01:20] I have learned that that is all BS lies that that stuff was almost I think it was completely

[01:27] Fabricated and it just it really annoys me that I did on this because I should have smelled this crap from a mile away

[01:33] And the part that annoys me the most is that someone went through all the trouble to create that entire thing

[01:40] Send it to me and and and confirm it as being accurate and this and that and I'm just here to tell you right now that I've

[01:47] Followed up with Paul I followed up with some of his customers and Paul did not sell anybody

[01:53] Games that they weren't supposed to get he didn't let anyone get multiple games

[01:58] He didn't let anyone cut the line in fact what I did here is Paul's had a list of people who wanted guns and roses

[02:05] Collectors edition and he went down his list in the order in which he received

[02:10] Inquiries about the game and that's how he did it and I don't think there's any other fairway to do it than that

[02:15] And so as far as I'm concerned all that other stuff that I got is total BS and

[02:21] Part of me just wants to out the person who sent me this stuff because I'm so annoyed that they did it

[02:26] But then I did a little bit more digging around this individual and it turns out that he's like some crazy dude in the

[02:33] Australia and seeing that everyone knows is it is kind of crazy and I'm like, you know what?

[02:37] I don't want another crazy pinhead

[02:40] Comment after me now because I the whole thing the whole thing is so stupid so you can be rest assured that nothing shady went on down with

[02:48] Pinball sales Australia so for those of you on Aussie arcade forums

[02:52] There's nothing really to see here. It's average go about your life as usual down there in Australia

[02:57] But the other crazy thing that I saw too and this this one's even weirder to me because

[03:02] Wayne at Mr. Pinball listed a guns and roses collectors edition for sale on his site now

[03:09] I heard that it's subsequently been taken down, but that was up there like he listed it for sale for

[03:15] 39,000 Australian dollars, which is like

[03:18] 27,000 dollars US now all of a sudden that listing has been taken down and I never said that he got his game from Paul

[03:26] So I'd never said that but it's just weird to me like is Wayne just messing with people by doing that and he probably is

[03:35] And once again, I took the bait and I bit and I talked about that

[03:40] But who knows if that's happening or not? I mean, but Wayne used to be a JJP distributor years ago

[03:46] This is the hottest game right now in the world and does he have one and is he gonna sell one now?

[03:51] What this did do was open up the debate about what will a guns and roses collectors edition be worth on the second hand market

[03:59] And I'm gonna air the rest of the podcast as I did it

[04:02] But I just wanted to clarify those two things and I'm also gonna save for the record

[04:06] I'm just going on the record right now. I am no longer gonna cover any drama of what's happening in the Australian

[04:14] Pinball scene because what he did this weekend and it showed me that it doesn't matter where you are in the world

[04:19] Whether it's Australia the United States the UK

[04:23] Wherever there's pinball machines and wherever there's pinball collectors and wherever there's people that feel they got burned

[04:30] Or they missed out on something there's so much drama and animosity that follows this damn toy around and it's just like

[04:38] I don't want any part of it and I should have known better. Why did I jump into this damn storyline?

[04:45] Absolutely a name of me to do that. It brings no joy to the damn hobby and it's just oh

[04:51] It's so crazy. I mean I was hearing stories as I was trying to get more information around this tale

[04:56] How like in Australia if you get a machine and you got a machine and someone else didn't people will stop talking to you

[05:02] Like literally people will stop talking to you because you secured an

[05:06] Ellie Stern and they didn't and they'll stop talking to you

[05:10] I mean we're grown men. We're men

[05:13] We are man children who are buying these toys and there is just no way that these damn pinball machines should lead to stuff like

[05:21] That there's no way people should be fabricating conversations and sending them to me and and confirming them as being accurate when they're 100% lies

[05:30] What what is wrong with people?

[05:31] I really lose faith in humanity and I got to stop taking people at their face value of what they say around this stuff because

[05:38] You know what it's just it's just crazy to me that someone would do that and try to like throw a company under the bus

[05:45] And then use me to do it like come on and I'm mad at myself more than anybody

[05:49] I'm so mad at myself so I apologize to Paul and so you can go about your day and we can talk about the real stuff in pinball

[05:56] Which is what the rest of this podcast was about so you're not really missing much just a little Australian drama that is not even real

[06:03] But I wonder if Wayne does have that game. That's the one part I wonder because he does have a magic girl for sale

[06:09] If you want magic girl

[06:10] He's got one for like over twenty thousand dollars

[06:13] So you can go buy that rare machine from Wayne anyway guys

[06:16] Here's the rest of the podcast you didn't miss much. We'll be back with normal

[06:20] Conversation will stop talking about the drama later. All right

[06:25] So here's another thing I want to talk about on this episode of can you just pinball podcast?

[06:29] I want to talk about play field quality because I've seen this post still pop up this thread still pop up on

[06:36] Jersey Jack and Stern's play field quality and I want to let all of you know that this is a topic that we should never let go

[06:43] That every new game that comes out as a community

[06:47] We should do our due diligence and share with the community the quality of our play fields and I keep seeing this because this thread's been around for a year

[06:57] So if you open up a new inbox game and you have play field issues

[07:01] You really have nobody to blame but yourself because we as a community and a lot of this started on canators pinball podcast

[07:08] We as a community should share we should over share and

[07:12] Overcommunicate what the condition of each game is that leaves the factory because it shouldn't be a guessing game and right now

[07:20] There are two new games out in the wild. There's Avengers and guns and roses and I'm here to tell you right now

[07:26] I have not seen many photos shared of either in terms of their play field quality

[07:32] So what I'm calling for people to do is share their photos of their games

[07:36] And if you don't have an issue, please share that

[07:39] I mean, it's just as important for people to share their great play fields as it is their bad ones

[07:44] Sometimes it seems like only the bad quality games get all the attention and then you know

[07:49] We keep sharing the one image the one image of the Avengers with the guide

[07:54] Scraping the clear coat off or the one image of a guns and roses with a little bit of like a bubble by the post

[08:00] But unless we see more imagery we can't tell whether or not the problems are being fixed at the manufacturing level

[08:07] So I implore all of you who have a guns and roses please share photos of your sling post and show us the quality

[08:14] You know, I will say this I reached out to someone who had a game on location and I asked them to share their guns and roses post

[08:19] And you know what the response was I don't want to get involved with that like what is that mean?

[08:25] You don't want to get involved with that like you have the game share it and so that leads me to believe that maybe there is an issue with the game

[08:32] But even so like if you're afraid to show that your game has a quality control issue because you don't want to

[08:40] Obset the manufacturer or the distributor who gave you the game. Are you kidding me?

[08:45] Share it with us the only way we're gonna make sure these companies improve their quality

[08:51] Is if we all collectively share what we've been given and also we hold them accountable when things are not right

[08:59] To bury it under the carpet and not share this stuff. I think is wrong

[09:04] So that's what I'm asking everybody to do and look on Stern's front

[09:08] They make so many games and I think they have three different vendors for playfields

[09:12] So it's gonna be a little bit of a crap shoot. You're not gonna know, you know who made which play field where it came from and

[09:18] So we'll see what happens there. I mean, I saw a guy had a shooter lane on his Avengers

[09:23] Did you see this his shooter lane had like a black

[09:26] Box in the middle of the shooter lane where they pressed the wood together and it was like clearly like it looked like maybe

[09:32] There was a burn mark there or they dropped something there and they repaired it there

[09:35] It's still smooth

[09:37] But it just looks a little off and there was a raging debate on whether or not that ever should have left the factory whether or not

[09:44] That should go into an Ellie game. Would you want a game that has wood that looks so off compared to everyone else's

[09:52] You probably would not should that have gone into an Ellie probably not should Stern have sent that one back

[09:59] Probably they should have okay, but this debate will continue to rage on but I do just ask all of you out there

[10:05] Let's not let this debate fall off and let's over share images of your games because that's the only way

[10:12] We can hold these companies accountable, okay?

[10:15] And the last thing I would hate to see is that guns and roses is having any play field issues now

[10:19] I will say this I just saw people share images of Willy Wonka's that were built in August of 2020

[10:27] Willy Wonka August 2020 build and there's a lot of pooling under the post now

[10:33] Is that a new play field or is that leftover stock that might have been an old Wonka play field that was made when they were having the pooling issues

[10:40] See I don't know I don't know what the build date is on the play field itself

[10:45] But I do know this if we're seeing that on an August 2020 build of Wonka

[10:51] That has to make you somewhat nervous that your G&R might have some issues and the best way to clear our minds

[10:58] Will be to see the games that are out there in the wild and there are a ton of them out in the wild right now

[11:03] So let's take a look and see how the quality is now the other thing I want to say and the reason why I took like a week off is

[11:10] Is just like lately my my god you guys are in these threads

[11:14] Looking like a bunch of babies of late and it takes everything in me not to do a pin-side babies episode again because I saw someone complaining

[11:21] I mean this on pin-side they were complaining that there were not enough songs in guns and roses not enough songs in guns and roses

[11:29] 21 songs full length songs and this guy's complaining there's not enough

[11:34] There's been so much bickering inside these threads and I just want to say this for the record what if

[11:41] What if Jersey Jack Pimball

[11:43] Stern Pimball and spooky Pimball what if those three companies all of a sudden are making one of their best games ever and I

[11:52] Think that's where we're at right now. This is the best spooky game. We've ever had in Rick and Morty

[11:57] This is the best Jersey Jack game we've ever had in guns and roses

[12:01] This is one of the best Stern games ever in Avengers

[12:04] I mean if you guys voted iron maiden the number one Stern game of all time

[12:08] This game blows iron made in a way all right, it does and so what if instead of complaining about each and what if instead of liking one

[12:17] Makes you have to throw mud at the other games

[12:19] What if all of you just stop being losers and running into the other companies threads to throw mud at the games that are great

[12:28] All three of these games are great and all three of them are great at different things

[12:33] They are like Rick and Morty is one of the greatest theme integrations of all time

[12:37] It's one of the greatest callouts in Pimball history. Okay. Is it the best Pimball ever?

[12:42] Absolutely not I still think it doesn't shoot that great

[12:45] I still think the geometry on it is really lackluster and I think the lack of toys in the game is

[12:51] Problematic and here's the thing here's the problem with like where we're at with Pinside is like it's all or nothing

[12:56] Like people either say it's the greatest game ever or they slam it

[12:59] But the problem is in some of this there's a middle ground in which I think people have a hard time

[13:06] Giving constructive criticism of games that can help these companies because you know right now

[13:11] It's like I would love to say here's some things I think they should work on for their next game because I think Scott and E.C

[13:16] Definitely has some feedback that is important for him to grow as a designer

[13:20] But he's probably not gonna get that because he's either gonna hear he he made a perfect game

[13:24] Or he's gonna hear the game is horrible and neither of those is true

[13:28] It's somewhere in the middle, okay?

[13:30] But if I were spooky I would look for a way to like not always have the shots so tight

[13:35] I would look for a way to make the geometry smoother and I would look for a way to instead of having post

[13:40] Like all these breaking off of posts

[13:42] I would put targets or think about a different way because I just think their games

[13:46] They do brick too much for me and I do think this game would have been better if the shots were opened up a little bit

[13:53] And that's just my feedback on the game everything else about the game

[13:56] It's gorgeous. It's colorful the callouts the music so much of it is done so well

[14:02] But that's the feedback I have and also the code

[14:04] I think the code could be a little bit deeper

[14:06] I think you kind of run out of stuff to do pretty quickly in the game

[14:09] But you know if you love Rick and Morty you're gonna love this game and you know same thing with Jersey Jack's Guns and Roses

[14:15] If you love G&R and Pimball this game is gonna blow you away if you don't love G&R this game's still gonna blow you away

[14:21] It's just that kind of Pimball experience and there's so many people out there arguing for or against this game that have not played it

[14:29] This is how dumb Pinside is these days

[14:32] Imagine arguing what's gonna be the best movie of the year and you have two movies that are like the top dogs and

[14:38] Nobody's seen either one and everyone's in the forum arguing about what's gonna win best picture this year

[14:44] That's what it's like arguing which is gonna win best Pimball machine this year

[14:48] Most of you haven't played either one so why are you in there arguing for or against either one of these games?

[14:56] What if I told you they're both great games?

[14:58] What if I told you I think G&R will take it because it does more new it does more stuff that has never been done before in Pimball

[15:05] And that's why I think G&R is easily gonna win game of the year

[15:09] But that doesn't mean that Avengers isn't a great Pimball machine, okay?

[15:13] Now personally, I can't wait to shoot in Avengers

[15:15] I can't wait to jump on it and until I do you are not gonna hear me like say like negative stuff the only thing I can critique is

[15:23] Maybe the artwork or maybe the code the stuff that I've seen but even the reason why I don't even want to do that is because you can't

[15:30] Critique a machine watching a stream of it. I'm sorry. You can't I see people trying to critique G&R because of streams and

[15:37] Avengers because of streams streams do not give you

[15:40] 10% of the experience of playing these games and so now we have an entire forum full of people that haven't played this stuff

[15:48] That have so much opinion about it and it's exhausting

[15:51] It really is exhausting and I spent the entire week just reading Pinside and being like this site is a pathway to

[15:59] Depression it's a pathway to depression

[16:02] This will make you down and out on Pimball

[16:04] We should all be really excited about the caliber of games coming from these manufacturers

[16:09] And then you go read the site that's supposed to be the people who are excited the most and they will get you the least excited about this thing

[16:15] It's time we turn Pinside off more and more just read this week in Pimball

[16:20] Just listen to the great Pimball podcasts that are out there

[16:23] We're the ones that are excited about Pimball. We're the ones pushing Pimball to get better to

[16:29] Capture our excitement around these games. It's you know that site. I don't I don't understand it

[16:33] I don't get it. I don't get it why people wake up and they they just have to complain about everything

[16:37] You go into a guns and roses thread and it spirals into like a Keith Lwynn thread

[16:42] Like what how are we talking about Keith Lwynn's merits in a guns and roses thread?

[16:47] When did the moderators decide to just take off all time and not even moderate any of those threads?

[16:52] Nothing's moderated. Nothing is on track. Nothing is focused. All right. Let's talk about some some positive stuff

[16:59] So if you own a monster bash or an attack from Mars or a medieval madness

[17:03] You need to check out Brian Allen's new inner art blades for those games

[17:07] I mean I just saw his inner art blades for those games and they are

[17:12] Phenomenal and Brian Allen does incredible work

[17:14] I mean I'm still waiting for the day that Brian Allen gets to do a machine from top to bottom

[17:19] Just you know the whole thing he just gets to do the art package and we've seen bits and pieces

[17:24] He's done trans lights before he's done inner art blades

[17:27] But definitely check out his inner art blade work

[17:31] If you have a Chicago gaming company game

[17:33] I think you're gonna want to throw those things into your game and they look stellar

[17:36] They look stellar well speaking of expensive price flips on pinball

[17:41] This is amazing. So if you go on eBay right now

[17:43] If you go on eBay right now and type in pinball and search by highest price to lowest

[17:49] Some collector out there someone who has bought almost every single new in box turn machine over the last few years

[17:57] Is now trying to cash out on some of the most popular titles and the prices are insane

[18:04] I'm looking at a ghost busters Ellie for $35,000 in a virus signature for

[18:11] 35,000 a diamond Beatles for

[18:14] $31,000 a Batman super Ellie for

[18:18] $29,000 there's all these Beatles diamond's editions being offered another one for

[18:23] $30,000 this is a joke a deadpool a deadpool

[18:27] Ellie for $25,000 who is this guy? Let's let's click on it hold on a second. Let's click on this

[18:33] Let's let's out this this crazy seller. So this guy is in Carl's tat Carl's tat new jersey

[18:41] So who is in Carl's tat new jersey that has all of these games that they are trying to sell and their eBay name

[18:48] Let's find their eBay name is bet's one enterprise

[18:52] That's one enterprise this guy has

[18:55] Ridiculous prices on all these games and I don't know, you know

[18:58] This is crazy to me who bought all these games and is trying now to flip them for two to three times the price

[19:04] I mean ultimately he's doing this just to get the attention and will probably just accept the best offer off of eBay

[19:10] But at 35,000 dollar ghost busters Ellie

[19:13] So the other thing that I think has been permeating the entire hobby because of COVID is that prices are going up

[19:20] And this is something that people I always hear them say prices are going up. It's getting crazy

[19:24] It's an impossible time to sell machines and then I see Greg bone selling a beautiful

[19:30] Judge dread for like $3,300 and it's gorgeous and look at the toys in that game

[19:35] And if I look at Judge Dread and it's $3,300 and this game if you look at a Judge Dread right now

[19:41] And I get the code is shallow if you look at a game like that right now

[19:45] And you look at everything that's in it and all the physical stuff in that game that game looks like it would be a

[19:52] $15,000 game if Stern made it today or Jersey Jack made it today and you can go get that game for

[19:58] $3,300 and it just reminds all of us that if you stop with the new inbox hype train

[20:04] There's still a ton of amazing pinball out there without breaking the bank

[20:09] I mean think about it for a minute you can go get all of these old classic games that people still enjoy and love

[20:15] If you were to take like 12-5

[20:17] Yeah, you could get one guns and roses collectors edition or you could go get three or four great games that people really love and

[20:24] Not have to worry about all the hassle and trying to keep it perfect and this and that you just enjoy pinball and

[20:30] Sure, there's a lot more games for sale right now. It's a seller's market. It is not a buyer's market

[20:34] It's a seller's market, but I don't know if there's more games now for sale than there usually is

[20:40] I mean, there's no way to really measure any of this right

[20:43] There's no like auto trader for pinball sales where you can actually measure and look at the data of how many of each title is up for sale at

[20:51] Any one moment in time. It's all over the place. What I do know is this pinball is growing

[20:57] People are getting into this hobby more and more the COVID is definitely made more people think about their home game rooms

[21:03] It's a really good time to be in this hobby

[21:05] We have three of the best games from three of the top manufacturers out and available right now

[21:10] That's a great thing. So it's a good time to be in pinball the other thing is this is the last thing I want to say because I'm just looking down a little bit

[21:16] I had I had a few mental notes the last thing I want to say is this if you order to guns and roses

[21:22] You're gonna have to wait. I really think people who ordered this game thought they were gonna get it on a stern

[21:29] Time frame you are not getting your guns and roses as quickly as you would if you ordered a stern machine

[21:34] I mean the fact of the matter is this it's still a small company

[21:38] There is no way they can make like 250 games a week. That's what stern makes a week

[21:42] There's just no way they can do it. You know, I'm watching all these people unbox their Avengers

[21:47] Elise and it's amazing how quickly they are arriving in people's homes

[21:51] You're not gonna see that with guns and roses collective edition. They're not all gonna make it out in two weeks

[21:56] I would I would say you're not gonna see all the CES unbox until like first quarter end of first quarter

[22:03] 2021 and Elise as well like you're just not gonna see that many

[22:07] Go out each week. It's a small company now. There is one issue right?

[22:11] It's like now they're taking non-refundable deposits on these games and you don't get a time frame of

[22:18] When you're gonna get your game. So this is also gonna be something that's gonna be interesting to follow is does that make sense

[22:26] Art why would you lock in a non-refundable deposit on a GNR le which they're making

[22:31] 5,000 of them they're never gonna be hard to get they're never gonna be hard to get why would you lock in your money now

[22:39] When you could just wait until it's either available or wait to see if you might want something else in the meantime because if you put in an order

[22:46] Right now and the rumor is they they sold over

[22:49] 2000 Elise so if you start to do the math on how long it would take them to make those

[22:55] 2000 Elise let me pull up my calculator right now and do this math

[22:58] So let's say Jersey Jack. Let's just say they make 20 games a day

[23:02] So let's just say that's a hundred games a week so if they sold 2000

[23:08] divided by a hundred games a week which is like a hundred games a lot for them

[23:12] I don't know if they're even at that number 2000 divided by a hundred do I need a calculator for this that would be

[23:17] 20 weeks that would be 20 weeks just to make all of those games

[23:21] So that's five months just to make the Elise that's not any standards and that's not any

[23:27] Collectors editions now. I'm also hearing that they might only be at 60 games a week

[23:32] So let's do 2000 divided by 60. I do need a calculator for this. That's 33 weeks

[23:39] That's 33 weeks. So that's a long time away

[23:43] So look I just think you're gonna need a little patience the game is worth it

[23:47] But I think everyone needs to realize that you're not gonna get your game that quickly

[23:51] I keep hearing all these CEO owners like when am I getting my game should I get in L.H.

[23:55] Look this is part of Jersey Jack's thing. It's it's a longer way

[23:59] They've never had this issue

[24:01] They've never had this many people clamoring for one of their games right away ever before

[24:06] So I think you know if I were them you're gonna need to hire more people you're gonna need to staff up

[24:11] You're probably gonna want to do two shifts of making these games like a day shift and a night shift and just keep making them

[24:18] Now the challenge there is you got to keep the quality up at the same time

[24:21] You know you don't want the games at the night shift to be of lesser quality than the day shift

[24:25] But I will say this guns and roses looks like the easiest game to build for them ever if you lift the playfield on it

[24:32] It's definitely definitely much more efficient to build this game than any of their previous game

[24:38] I think screwing this thing together is just a lot easier for the people on the line

[24:41] And that's a good thing because again the experience of it is so wow

[24:46] That I don't care what's under the playfield. It is really what's on top of the playfield and the moment you're in front of that machine

[24:52] Is magical and I can't wait for you guys to get it, but you're gonna need patience all right
