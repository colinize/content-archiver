[00:00] Show me the money! Show me the money! Show me the money!

[00:07] Show me the money!

[00:16] If you're listening to this right now, you're in a good position because you're going

[00:20] to get exclusive Canadian pinball podcasts content, I'm calling this the Canadian pinball

[00:25] podcast Pay for Play Club. All of you out there who are listening to this right now,

[00:30] and it's not a lot of people. You have contributed and donated to Canadian pinball podcasts, so

[00:37] for you and you alone, you are going to get access to these shows. These are going to

[00:42] be a SoundCloud link that only people who have this link can listen to these podcasts.

[00:49] So I hope you keep it to yourself and I hope you enjoy it because I'm going to give

[00:54] you shows that are going to be a little bit more raw. I'm going to be a little bit more

[00:58] strident. I will do my best to tell you news and rumors on this Pay for Play channel before

[01:04] it hits the major show I do because I think you deserve it. And you've given to me some

[01:10] of your hard earned money when you didn't have to. And you've shown your support for Canadian

[01:14] pinball podcasts when you didn't have to. And when I started doing this podcast so many

[01:19] years ago, I didn't do it for the money. I didn't do it for the fame or the twippies

[01:23] or anything. I simply started my show because I was banned by the number one form about

[01:30] pinball. I was banned for speaking my mind. And I mean this when I say it, if you go back

[01:35] to pinside and you try to find the reason I was banned, you will never find a reason

[01:41] that is good enough to warrant me being banned from that site. Now I don't want to go back

[01:45] there. I don't care about going back there. But what happened in that moment when they

[01:50] decided that Canadian's voice isn't a voice we want in this hobby and look what's happened

[01:56] since the number one show four years in a row. And it's going to be five years and it's

[02:01] going to be six years. And it's because of people like you. It's because of people like

[02:05] you who tune in every week and support this show and support me because I mean it when

[02:10] I say it, I do need support because when you take the position I take and you go after

[02:16] these companies and you relentlessly go after these companies when they're not staying

[02:20] true to their word. When you go after these designers when they get lazy and don't put

[02:25] creative stuff into their games, when you go after these pinball personalities out there

[02:29] that just endlessly cheerly this industry, right? The agendas that they have is so disgusting

[02:35] to me. The slanted agendas of so many of the people out there that are supposedly looking

[02:41] out for you, the pinball customer. But the truth is they're just looking out for the

[02:45] companies and they're looking out for their friends in the industry. You're the last person

[02:50] they care about, but they mislead you and they they pretend like, oh yeah, we're all

[02:55] about pinball and expanding pinball. No, they're about expanding their pockets, selling

[03:00] you stuff, making sure the companies are selling more games, that's not what we need more

[03:06] of. What we need more of is people keeping these companies honest, is people basically saying

[03:13] we're not going to spend this much money unless we get a quality product that these companies

[03:18] will stand behind. And I also believe and I firmly believe this and I'm going to be more

[03:23] strident on these sort of, you know, behind the paywall shows. I think there is such a

[03:28] lack of creativity in pinball. It's absolutely pathetic. When you think about the amazing

[03:34] worlds in their glass that could be created and then you look at games like Mandalorian,

[03:39] it's freaking pathetic. They can do so much better and you know it like deep down in your

[03:44] gut, deep down in your heart, you know that these games are simply built to a cost. They're

[03:51] not building a dream. They're not building what they're imagining. They're building to

[03:56] a cost and we're going to talk about that on this episode. But we're also going to give

[03:59] you news, rumors and speculations, hopefully before it hits my main show. Let's start out

[04:04] with one right now. So here's something no one's heard yet that you're going to get first.

[04:09] Spooky pinball has two games fully designed ready to go. Let me repeat that. There are two

[04:15] spooky titles fully designed ready to go. And the second one is not TNA 2.0. That is also

[04:22] ready to go. TNA 2.0 will simply be TNA inside the Rick and Morty cabinet. But Charlie

[04:29] has two new titles. Now I've been saying that it's Halloween or Nightmare in Elm Street

[04:34] and I have really good sources on both. So perhaps it is actually both of them that it's

[04:41] not one or the other. So we will see what will happen. The other thing that's happening

[04:45] over at Spooky right now is they are expanding their operation. And the other thing I'm hearing

[04:50] is that that new building that is adjacent or right next to the current building that

[04:55] will be for line number two. So spooky pinball will be a company now that will actually

[05:02] manufacture two games at one time. They are not going to use line one in line two for

[05:08] one title. So this gets really interesting that spooky pinball could possibly could possibly

[05:15] make two games in 2021 or reveal two games and get them out to us. I think it's going

[05:22] to be Nightmare in Elm Street and the second title I'm hearing is a more family friendly

[05:27] theme along the lines of like a family guy kind of theme. So I'm not sure what that theme

[05:33] is. I don't think it's Scooby Doo but you are going to see spooky pinball give us a horror

[05:39] movie game and a more family friendly campy game as well. So they've clearly learned

[05:45] that the Rick and Morty sort of audience that works. And when you go to a broader fan

[05:50] base that works. Spooky pinball cannot only be spooky theme titles. Now for me the main

[05:57] thing with spooky pinball is making a game that actually shoots well because as much

[06:00] as Rick and Morty sold out in four hours as cool as that theme is as neat as the call

[06:06] that it's our and Rick and Morty the game shoots atrociously and I don't mean to be

[06:11] rude but I'm going to be rude a little bit. I don't know how they ended up after that

[06:16] white wood making a game that shoots that way. And I owned it and I played it for a really

[06:21] long time and as much as I love what Scott has brought to pinball design and geometry are

[06:27] not his strong suits. And this game there's something about it and something happened with

[06:32] the way they made this game where they moved stuff around on the left side of the playfield

[06:37] and then they didn't move the upper right flipper. And it's just not satisfying. I'm sorry

[06:41] but a pinball machine should be satisfying to shoot. I'd rather have the difficulty

[06:47] come from needing to hit multiple shots in a row right. Make the game hard via the code.

[06:53] Don't make the game hard because the shot geometry is crap. Don't make it a clunk fest.

[06:59] And that is what Rick and Morty is to me. It's just this really bad shooting game. And

[07:04] I also think Rick and Morty is a game that just doesn't have many toys in it. When you

[07:07] own it you'll see this. There really is nothing happening that's truly magical and wonderful

[07:14] underneath the glass. And that is what I want from pinball. And you know me I don't stop

[07:19] beating this drum. This is a theme where you're going through a portal and you could come

[07:24] out in multiple areas of the universe. That's what Rick and Morty is all about right.

[07:29] And yet when you play the game you go into the same spot. It comes out the same spot.

[07:33] There's nothing magical about the ball going into the upper left garage and it just shoots

[07:37] out the same subway every single time. Really couldn't have a more unique subway system.

[07:44] You couldn't have the ball slowly go into the portal. All out of the Lord the Ring ring.

[07:48] No, no, there's just nothing in this game. It really is like TNA with ramps. It really is.

[07:54] And so I hope that spooky's next title just puts way more fun into it. I hope it puts more fun

[08:01] in a physical level into the game. And I'm going to talk about this a little bit on this

[08:05] podcast because I do think that physical fun and physical things that interact with the ball.

[08:10] It's the last thing these companies want you to demand nowadays. They want to put all the

[08:14] effort into static things that don't break static things like code like once you design the code

[08:20] it's done. It's not going to break once you design the artwork. It's done. It's not going to

[08:25] break. That is where Stern puts so much of their effort. Name me a Stern mechanism. That's made

[08:30] you say wow. And I asked that question T Rex. The only thing people bring up is the damn T Rex.

[08:36] Okay, you look at the man the Lauren and you tell me Brian Eddie the man who made the medieval

[08:40] madness castle made this game. He's not as great as people think he is Brian Eddie and all

[08:46] these designers from the Valley Williams days. They all suffer from the same thing. They need it

[08:52] a team of engineers to make them look great. The real heroes in Pimbal the real people that made

[08:59] those Valley Williams games so damn amazing from a mechanical standpoint. Their names are not

[09:05] John Papaduke. Their names are not Brian Eddie. Is Brian Eddie even a mechanical engineer? I mean

[09:10] when I look at George Gomez's sketches I think Gomez is the kind of guy that could actually create

[09:17] and imagine amazing things in Pimbal machines. But the problem is now but Gomez is not putting

[09:23] everything into games anymore either. Everything at Stern is designed to a cost, designed to a bomb.

[09:29] I really hope that this new spooky game has a lot of fun stuff in it and here's the other thing

[09:34] I'm hearing is that the art package on it though. I'm hearing this will be some of the nicest

[09:38] art package on any game ever. So when you see this new spooky game prepared to be blown away from

[09:44] an artistic standpoint alone. I heard by someone who saw the new game they said Chris this game's

[09:49] going to sell on art alone and that's great and all that's great and all but I don't want games

[09:55] to sell on art alone. I want there to be more under the glass that is amazing and magical and

[10:00] makes you say wow I wonder what that does. Shouldn't that be the brief? Shouldn't that be the

[10:06] end desire of looking down at a Pimbal machine and say I wonder what that does or I wonder where

[10:13] you know I wonder what happens when the ball rolls over that section or I wonder like what happens

[10:18] when I shoot over there. I wish more games made you think that way. Made you feel that way.

[10:24] To me that's where the secret lies right in a way of Pimbal machine is like a ride a Disney World

[10:30] and you want to be in this sort of state of suspended disbelief as you watch the ball rolling around

[10:36] that little world under glass and I just don't feel that way with so many of these modern games.

[10:41] Let's talk about what's after Godzilla right now okay and again I'm just doing this here first.

[10:46] So I know that it's a music pin. I know that it is a music pin after Godzilla being designed by John

[10:53] Borg and I think Lyman Sheets is on the code. Now what is the music pin that we think is next? A lot of

[11:00] people are saying rush because Borg and Lyman are big rush fans. I don't think it's rush. I don't

[11:05] think there's demand for rush. I don't think rush is up there or nearly the caliber of music that

[11:11] people really want in Pimbal form. It's just not and if you're a rush fan that's great I'm not

[11:15] here to poo poo on rush. I don't think rush has the high energy sort of music that is perfect for

[11:21] Pimbal. Here is what I think it's going to be and this makes perfect sense and this is the greatest

[11:26] counter punch to guns and roses. Not just because this music is just as high energy as G&R but because

[11:33] this music is perfect for Pimbal's demographic it's the kind of person you buy's Pimbal machines.

[11:39] It's the kind of band that belongs in a man cave. It's the kind of band that you want to drink a

[11:43] bunch of whiskeys too and just rock out and have fun and it's also the band that hates guns and

[11:49] roses more than anybody and back in the day these two frontmen absolutely hated each other.

[11:55] Now ironically guns and roses actually started out opening for this band because this band was

[12:00] bigger right before G&R hit and that band is Motley Crew and I know for a fact that the Motley

[12:07] Crew license is obtained by a Pimbal company and who do you think has it? It's no way it's Jersey

[12:13] Jack Pimbal because Motley Crew there's no way it's Jersey Jack Pimbal because slash and Motley

[12:18] Crew they're not friends these bands don't like each other. There is no way that Vince Nio would

[12:24] follow in the footsteps of Axe Rose. Now Vince Nio looks horrible now so if they do this

[12:29] pin it has to be old school Motley Crew I mean Vince Nio looks like a buttered up turkey that they

[12:33] roll out on to stage he can't even hit any of the notes anymore you know even though Axel doesn't

[12:38] look as great as he used to he can still perform at a decent enough level you know to appease the

[12:43] fans but Motley Crew's music like kickstart my heart home sweet home smoking in the boys room

[12:49] SOS same old situation you know I would play it right now but you know what I'm talking about

[12:55] that is the kind of high energy music that would be perfect for Pimbal so I expect this to be

[13:00] Motley Crew after Godzilla I think it makes total sense I hope it is that now what's gonna be

[13:07] interesting with a music pin moving forward it doctor feel good what's gonna be really

[13:12] interesting about a music pin moving forward is that Guns and Roses has raised the bar so high

[13:18] in terms of how to make an awesome music pin and I think Stern needs to figure out what they're

[13:23] doing because Led Zeppelin was trash we all know it was trash we all know it was boring we all

[13:28] know that they tried to use like the positioning of G and R's like going to a Led Zeppelin concert

[13:33] no it's not there's no way you can follow up G and R with Led Zeppelin and then try to spin it

[13:39] as if it's the same kind of experience now Led Zeppelin sales or whatever you can find Ellie's

[13:45] all over the place and the game has no magic in it and I'm so happy that the response to Led Zeppelin

[13:51] was so lukewarm because it's gotta be an eye opening moment for people like Steve Richie and

[13:56] George Gomez that when you do this and you put nothing interesting in these games people will

[14:03] speak with their wallets it's the reason why Beatles didn't sell well I mean the damn Beatles

[14:09] are the biggest music act in history and look how bad the pin sold because the pin was lazy it was

[14:16] boring it's fun to play but I mean in a modern time it's not enough I don't mean it's like

[14:22] boring to play you know because all pinball is fun where I'm just gonna say that all pinball is fun

[14:26] but when you look at the Beatles and you look at how much money they charged for it nobody thought that

[14:32] this much money equaled this kind of gameplay the Beatles should have been four to six thousand

[14:37] dollar pin six thousand dollars at most eight thousand dollars for the diamond edition and they

[14:42] should have called it a day they were charging twenty five thousand dollars for the diamond edition

[14:48] that's ludicrous that's ludicrous and and some people bought it there are people out there that

[14:53] spent twenty five thousand for the diamond edition and now look at those people they're idiots you

[14:59] can get a diamond now in box for like twelve to fifteen if you wanted it and I wouldn't even want

[15:04] it because it doesn't even look much better than the platinum and doesn't even look much better

[15:08] than the gold I mean franchi did a great job on all three art packages you don't get any extra

[15:13] songs if you spend more money and that doesn't work anymore and leds up one's the same thing it's

[15:18] like it's just not good enough it's just not good enough and after guns and roses it looks like

[15:22] a pathetic effort now let me talk about Jersey Jack and guns and roses real quick because this sucks

[15:30] guns and roses went from being the bell of the ball to now the damn like janitor everyone is

[15:36] so annoyed now with the play field issues and the the amount of blowback they are getting around

[15:42] this topic I think is deserved and I'm sorry I don't think it's a fifty fifty split between

[15:49] Mirko and J.J.P Jersey Jack pinball has known about this now for three games four games in a row

[15:55] they have nobody to blame but themselves all of Eric's hard work all of the hard work was slash

[16:01] and Keith Johnson to make this magical pin because it is a magical pin it all goes out the window

[16:07] if the quality is shit and the quality is shit when you look at some of these play fields there's no

[16:13] excuse for this and so now what do you do now what do you do if you're them they're making everybody

[16:18] punch sand they change their warranty which basically says there is no warranty and it's all

[16:23] pathetic and I'm embarrassed for them and it's no fun talking about the game now it's no fun to

[16:29] think about buying one because they haven't hit Halt on the production line I mean think about

[16:33] that for a minute they know they have a problem and they haven't stopped production what does that

[16:38] say about the company what does that say about the people who are running Jersey Jack pinball right

[16:44] now you know they have people in positions of marketing and communications we know who they are

[16:50] Ken Cromwell we know who they are and now they refuse to talk to us now they refuse to say anything

[16:57] to us you know because the knife cuts both ways you can't only talk when times are good you gotta

[17:03] also communicate when times are bad I mean that's like in any relationship in life not just with

[17:08] your pinball company with your wife with your kids if you stop communicating when times are tough

[17:16] if you try to hide when times are bad and you bottle it up and you hide and you think it's going

[17:21] to get better with time it's not it gets worse now where does Jersey Jack go from here I don't

[17:28] really know I'll tell you this my enthusiasm for the company continues to decline every single day

[17:33] they say nothing my enthusiasm for the company continues to decline every time I see new photos

[17:39] of people's games with issues my enthusiasm continues to decline every single time I see them

[17:45] post all this jovial stuff on Facebook and then every single comment is like but what about the

[17:50] playfields and they refuse to comment you know it's like they're doing jumping jacks down the block

[17:54] while the house is on fire and we're not gonna fall for it and no one's stupid enough to fall for it

[17:59] and you know what really makes me annoyed and and I mean it when I say this the lack of coverage that

[18:04] this is received from the other pinball media out there is exactly why canators pinball podcasts will

[18:11] always win the trippy it's exactly why we will always have the largest audience look at everyone

[18:16] else who has a pinball podcast out there where's the coverage of this look at this week in pinball

[18:22] where's the coverage of this this is why this hobby also makes me disgusted when something goes wrong

[18:29] that we need to talk about and discuss look at how few people actually want to stand up for consumer

[18:36] rights because they don't really care to them all that matters is getting new pinball the more

[18:42] people that talk about it the faster will get a resolution now people are mad these are jersey jacks

[18:49] best customers to that are also being impacted these collectors edition buyers they thought they

[18:54] were gonna be fine they thought they were in the clear because can cramwell told us were good to go

[19:00] on the collectors editions and now they're looking down at their masterpiece and they're seeing

[19:05] issues and they have absolutely no support there's absolutely no support and as a collectors edition

[19:11] owner myself with a game sitting in box I have number 500 of guns and roses I have the last guns

[19:18] and roses machine now it wasn't the last one off the line because you know they build them in

[19:22] different orders and they stick plaques on them but I have plaque number 500 and I'm terrified to

[19:27] take it out of the box and my enthusiasm to open it up and play it has diminished so much so to the

[19:34] point where part of me never even wants to open up the damn CE I kind of just want to keep it in box

[19:41] and just beat on an le because I don't want to see this thing that I was going to preserve and I

[19:46] was going to cherish I was going to play it I shouldn't have to worry about the playfield falling

[19:50] apart like this so now I don't want to take it out of a box I almost might just when I get a house

[19:55] eventually set it up and not even play it just put it on jukebox mode and and and gawk at it

[20:01] but then just beat on an le next to it because I don't want to see it fall apart and I don't know

[20:06] what the solution is right now until there is a solution and I mean this until there is a solution

[20:12] until we know how to solve this problem I am not unboxing that game and if there is no solution

[20:19] then I may never unbox it because I'm just tired of this and ultimately I think what's going to

[20:25] happen is this one day someone is going to say hey look we need to redo the playfields we need to

[20:30] get rid of Mirko and we need to redo the playfields we need to remove the artwork from around the

[20:35] post and we need to sell guns and roses owners playfields that have been fixed that day will

[20:41] eventually have to come there is no avoiding it Jersey Jack Pimball they know this they're going

[20:46] to have to solve the playfield and give these owners the opportunity to buy a replacement playfield

[20:52] that will not disintegrate they can't just let these machines stay broken forever because these

[20:58] owners will not accept it there will be a class action lawsuit if they try to tell these owners

[21:03] the punch sand and I know that the ab is family doesn't want this this isn't why they got into

[21:08] Pimball now they've got all these angry people banging on their door this is why billionaires

[21:14] don't go into Pimball they open up wineries and they open up like airplane companies and helicopter

[21:21] companies and yachting companies and they make all these other things that don't create this level

[21:26] of consumer dissatisfaction like you are never going to get people pissed off if you make wine

[21:32] or you make bourbon but they're making Pimball and now they have no solution for people I think it's

[21:38] pathetic I think it's annoying now they don't even talk to me right I made so many people fall in

[21:44] love with guns and roses and now Eric Minier doesn't get back to me can Cromwell doesn't get

[21:49] back to me you know I'm their friend when I'm saying how much I love this game and then when I'm

[21:54] simply covering the topic of hand which is the playfield qualities they want nothing to do with

[22:00] me and this is why canada will always be the servant of the people and the community because I don't

[22:05] care if Eric Minier doesn't want to talk to me anymore I wish he would I don't care if Ken Cromwell

[22:12] doesn't want to talk to me anymore it doesn't matter because at the end of the day I'm going to be

[22:16] able to tell everybody and all my listeners and you include it I'm going to be able to like hold

[22:21] them accountable and there's nothing they can do and it's hard to go against me because I'm saying

[22:26] that all we want from you guys is a quality product and we want you to stand behind the product

[22:32] that we spend a lot of money on and in the future this should not happen and this has happened three

[22:37] times in a row and your entire company should be staring in the mirror and being embarrassed that

[22:42] you've let it happen once again how many times are you going to shoot yourself in the foot and after

[22:47] three times in a row it's at the point now where you either need to fire Mirko or you need to figure

[22:52] out an entirely new system because this is not working and you had eight months this is the part

[22:57] that sucks they had eight months to figure this out when they moved from New Jersey to Chicago I will

[23:02] for those of you on this canada behind the paywall I will start to share with you some of the elements

[23:07] of episode number 500 that I never aired I never aired it it was all about Jersey Jack Pimball

[23:13] and it was all about the transition from New Jersey to Chicago and all the different personnel

[23:18] moves that happened when that shift happened and I mean it when I say it what we're seeing now the

[23:25] issues we are seeing now with Jersey Jack Pimball when you listen to episode 500 it all starts to make

[23:32] sense all that this makes sense the karma the decision making that went on the people they put in

[23:38] power the people they kick to the curb this is all karma on some level this is what happens when

[23:45] you step on the soul of an organization and you put in business people that don't necessarily know

[23:50] what they're doing and you hand the reins to someone who's not exactly the guy that cares to

[23:55] collaborate and fix problems you get here and this is where we're at and they don't want you to hear

[24:01] and they don't want you to know it but there's a lot of truth that happened behind the scenes there's

[24:05] a lot of stuff that Eric knows there's a lot of dynamics that went on and there's a lot of people

[24:10] that know the truth that want to speak out but they don't want to get sued by a billionaire so

[24:14] that's why you don't know those stories I'll let you in on some of those stories behind this paywall

[24:20] because I really want to thank you guys for joining canada's pinball podcast and donating to the show

[24:25] you're gonna get a different side of me anyway everyone have a great day and tell your friends look

[24:29] and if you want to get your friends in on these kind of things ask them to contribute don't just
