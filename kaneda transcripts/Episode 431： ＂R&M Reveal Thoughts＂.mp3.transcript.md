[00:00] I had a dream last night that I actually overslept and woke up after 10 a.m. Eastern Standard

[00:19] time and I miss my window by which to order Rick and Morty Pimball.

[00:25] So let's talk about our first impressions of the Sunday Night reveal.

[00:29] A Rick and Morty Pimball by Spooky Pimball LLC.

[00:34] So I don't think people really expected it to drop on a Sunday night.

[00:38] I don't think I've seen anyone else ever reveal a game on a Sunday evening.

[00:43] And I have no problem with it.

[00:45] You know, some people are talking to me like, well, why are they doing it then?

[00:49] It's such a stupid time to release.

[00:50] And I was like, what are you talking about?

[00:52] Like the show airs on Sunday nights.

[00:54] And the fan base of Rick and Morty is up on a Sunday night.

[00:58] And I just saw the video that they released has something like 12,000 views, which isn't

[01:03] a lot, but it is a lot when you think there's only 750 games that are going to be available

[01:09] ever on this title.

[01:12] When every new Pimball machine comes into the world, it is like the birth.

[01:16] Pimball God.

[01:17] The goddess of Pimball has birthed us a new baby in which we are immediately having a

[01:24] reaction to, right?

[01:25] And I know it's always hard when all you get is a video like this and photographs to

[01:31] know deep down inside.

[01:34] Who here knows if they really are going to enjoy flipping this machine, right?

[01:40] If you're a Rick and Morty fan, I think you're just excited that Rick and Morty Pimball

[01:44] exist.

[01:45] If you're a Pimball person that wants a game with deep rule sets, you don't know yet

[01:50] if there's enough there.

[01:51] If you're a Pimball person who loves artwork and making a visual statement with your Pimball

[01:57] machines, we're going to talk about that, what we think about the way the game looks.

[02:02] But I think it's never been done like this before and I wanted to sleep on it.

[02:07] I didn't want to put up a show last night because I wanted to think about how this whole

[02:13] thing rolled out.

[02:14] We definitely can all agree that this was one of the best launches of a Pimball machine

[02:20] ever in terms of getting people excited in terms of the manufacturer being present, you

[02:28] know, at the moment in which stuff is going up online.

[02:30] I mean, Chuck was inside the threads talking to fans.

[02:34] He was answering every question he could.

[02:36] They've done as good of a job as any manufacturer I've ever seen, just getting people excited

[02:42] for the game.

[02:44] So the hype was through the roof.

[02:46] The fear of missing out on getting this game is still currently in existence and through

[02:52] the roof.

[02:53] I want to talk about that too because I don't think people are thinking this through

[02:58] fully right now and I want to explain what I mean by that in a little bit.

[03:01] But you might as well just order it as my kind of opinion or it.

[03:04] Anyway, so let's talk about it.

[03:06] Let's talk about the game itself.

[03:08] Let me give you my opinions about this launch and the game and what I'm seeing as I look

[03:14] at the game right now.

[03:15] This is all just within 24 hours of absorbing this game.

[03:19] I think first and foremost, the overwhelming thing I'm feeling right now is a level of anxiety

[03:27] and excitement connected to each other.

[03:30] Like I'm both excited and I'm anxious at the same time.

[03:34] I'm excited that there's a Rick and Morty pinball machine that there's a new pinball machine

[03:38] just out there in the world available for us.

[03:41] I'm really excited that the show's creator is working on this game.

[03:45] Like when I see the video and I hear the callouts and I hear Chuck tell us that there's

[03:50] all this hilarity and we haven't even heard any of the R-rated more explicit sort of voice

[03:58] overwork from the creator of the show.

[04:02] You know, that's going to be amazing.

[04:03] I don't think we've ever seen ever in the history of pinball a game made that's going

[04:09] to have this level of theme integration when it comes to the callouts from the characters

[04:18] in the theme.

[04:19] Okay, so I think it's going to be absolutely incredible.

[04:21] Now, the question does remain.

[04:23] Are we only going to get voice work from Rick and Morty?

[04:26] Will there also be the family members from the show?

[04:30] Will they also have callouts?

[04:32] Are we going to hear from them at least on the clips from the show?

[04:35] I think we will.

[04:36] I mean, this is the show's creator.

[04:38] It's the show's creator.

[04:39] I am sure that everyone who has anything to do with Rick and Morty will follow his

[04:45] lead and do what he wants to do.

[04:48] And if he wants to make the best pinball Rick and Morty game, I think he's going to have

[04:51] to have sounds from the other characters in the show.

[04:54] All right.

[04:55] That's what I'm really excited about.

[04:56] And I'll talk more about the layout and the artwork.

[04:59] I'm excited about it, but I'm also anxious that I have to make up my mind less than 24

[05:05] hours after seeing just a video that doesn't really have much gameplay, that doesn't really

[05:11] have any of what the coding is, doesn't really show us anything on the screen, doesn't have

[05:17] any of the real like pinball stuff you want to see, right?

[05:21] It's just, it's sort of just like a video, it's movement over a game.

[05:27] It's almost like video, taking video of photography, of the still images and just moving around

[05:33] with some music and some call outs from, there's no real like pinball meat on the bone

[05:39] right now.

[05:40] And we have to make up our mind.

[05:42] And here's what I thought about as I woke up this morning.

[05:44] I said like, you know, normally when spooky pinball launches a new game and almost every

[05:49] pinball manufacturer launches a new game, normally before you have to like pay and spend your

[05:55] money and run to the door with your wallet out, normally spooky would always bring these

[06:01] shows to a game, sorry, these shows to a game, the game to a show and people would have

[06:07] a chance to play the game at the show.

[06:10] Like I remember Alice Cooper was I think released at Texas pinball festival.

[06:14] Rob Zombie was revealed at a show and they would show the game and then people could jump

[06:20] on the game and play it immediately.

[06:23] And even though the games weren't finished code wise, we at least, we at least had like

[06:28] a good two to three days of people's first impressions of flipping the game before people

[06:34] had to order the game.

[06:36] And we know that those titles did not have the hype.

[06:38] There was not the fan base that were just ready to gobble it up.

[06:42] So that's where the anxiety lies right now for me.

[06:45] And probably for most people out there is you have to make up your mind maybe today before

[06:51] you get locked out and you don't know enough.

[06:54] And that's just pinball though, right?

[06:56] I mean, who else out there?

[06:59] This is what Stern does every single time.

[07:01] I think spooky pinball is feeling what Stern feels consistently over the years, which is

[07:09] when you have a big theme that people want, you really can make people do stuff that they

[07:14] wouldn't normally do in other areas of life.

[07:19] You really can get people to spend thousands of dollars before they've even played the

[07:24] game.

[07:25] And Stern does that time and time again.

[07:28] I mean, people bought $15,000 Elvira games without flipping it once.

[07:35] So when I look at this game and it's around like $7,000 plus the Blood Sucker Edition,

[07:41] which is $7,500.

[07:43] And then if you want the Butter cabinet, it's $8,500.

[07:46] Let's talk about price, then we'll get into the game itself.

[07:50] So I see people saying like, you know, is this game worth it?

[07:54] And I think all of us collectively don't know yet.

[07:58] I mean, how can I sit here on this microphone and tell you it's definitely worth it.

[08:03] Go get it.

[08:04] We just haven't seen enough.

[08:06] Now if I were to add up the elements of this game, it's a Scott Dinesy game with Bowen

[08:12] Caron's on the rule set and knowing that the show's founder is working on this game with

[08:18] them, I do think the value is going to be there.

[08:22] Okay.

[08:23] And come on.

[08:25] I mean, spooky pinball at $7,500.

[08:28] I don't think that's a bad buy at all.

[08:30] I mean, especially for me, I've been buying all these games lately that are selling for

[08:35] like $15,000, $12,000.

[08:37] And it just, to me, like $7,500 starts to feel like a bargain.

[08:41] I mean, there's only going to be $750.

[08:44] I know when I say only, it still sounds like a lot, even as I say it.

[08:48] It sounds like a lot.

[08:49] I do think people are not going to get locked out of buying this game.

[08:52] I don't think it's going to sell out in one hour.

[08:56] I don't.

[08:57] I don't.

[08:58] I'll explain why in a little bit.

[08:59] All right.

[09:00] So in terms of value, I think the, you know, I think the blood sucker addition with the

[09:04] purple armor looks phenomenal.

[09:06] I think it looks great.

[09:07] I mean, I saw some people complaining about the purple armor.

[09:10] I think it looks fantastic.

[09:11] I just, I don't understand why you would not upgrade to the blood sucker addition.

[09:16] For the extra $500, I think you get way more in that upgrade than you normally do.

[09:22] With stern pinball machines, I just think it looks better.

[09:25] I, why not?

[09:27] Why not just get the one that looks better?

[09:29] All right.

[09:30] Now, I personally, personally, if you, if I were, if I were you and you were me personally,

[09:36] I would go in with everything.

[09:39] If you've seen the butter cabinets in person, unless your games are in between games and

[09:43] you're never going to see the artwork, I think this colorful cartoony artwork of Rick

[09:49] and Morty in butter cabinet format is going to look so freaking good.

[09:55] So I actually would definitely increase the price and add the butter cabinet into the

[10:00] game, you know, coming in around like 8500 plus shipping.

[10:04] All right.

[10:05] That's what I would just go all in.

[10:07] I would want them to put everything that they could into the game.

[10:11] And I know, I know once you're getting around 8500, you know, $9,000, maybe with taxes

[10:17] for people, all of a sudden, what just happened, right?

[10:21] Spooky pinball is at the price of a stern limited edition game.

[10:27] Holy crap, right?

[10:28] This little boutique company from Benton, Wisconsin that used to sell $6,000 games and would humbly,

[10:35] humbly, you know, say that a game was $6,000.

[10:40] Remember, they were like nervous.

[10:41] They never wanted to price people out of the pinball fun and for the best of pinball and

[10:45] to expand pinball.

[10:47] But I'm happy to see Spooky and company getting what they deserve because they have the hot

[10:52] theme with the hot designer, with the great coder, with great theme integration.

[10:57] They have this game has so much more in it than a lot of recent stern machines in terms

[11:04] of, you know, the total package.

[11:06] So I'm happy.

[11:07] I'm happy that they can charge this and look, here's the thing.

[11:10] The market will determine whether or not Spooky is charging too much for this game.

[11:15] Okay, the market will, we'll say what it can bear in the pinball world.

[11:20] But knowing what sells in pinball and knowing what this game has on the table, I don't think

[11:25] people are going to bark because of the price.

[11:27] I don't.

[11:28] I really don't.

[11:29] All right.

[11:30] Let's talk about the game.

[11:32] Let's talk about the game.

[11:33] So I'm opening up Spooky Pinball's Facebook page and what's really exciting and this must

[11:37] be a great day for them over there is, is they've, they've changed all the artwork on

[11:42] Spooky Pinball LLC and it's all Rick and Morty.

[11:46] Now let me tell you something.

[11:47] When it comes to marketing, when you can borrow equity that millions of people love and

[11:53] all of a sudden Spooky Pinball and Rick and Morty will forever be merged together because

[12:00] of this partnership and it must make them feel so special at a small little company,

[12:05] a tiny little company from Benton, Wisconsin, who came out of the gates with America's

[12:11] most on it, arguably one of the ugliest games of all time.

[12:15] This meager little company that started slowly, that just slowly grew from, you know, making

[12:21] a dominoes game and a Jetsons game and a Rob Zombie game and an Alice Cooper game, they

[12:27] kept getting better and better and better and now they've got a pretty big leagues license

[12:32] and now they've entered into, you know, a fandom that's beyond probably what their wildest

[12:38] dreams were when they started this little company.

[12:41] So it's really cool to see them associated with such a hot property like Rick and Morty.

[12:45] So I'm looking over the game and the first thing I thought to myself was like, wow, it looks

[12:49] like, it almost looks a little like TNA 2.0, doesn't it?

[12:53] I mean, I, I, I don't know who did the artwork on the game but I'm assuming it was Matt

[12:58] Andrews because it has a very TNA like layout with the numbers and the color, gradiation

[13:05] and just when, I don't know, just the first glance at it, I'm like, oh, okay, here we go,

[13:09] you know, and there's just like, it just has that sort of TNA feel to it.

[13:15] Now in terms of the, the artwork, you know, I'll say this like for a Rick and Morty theme,

[13:22] I need to stand over it.

[13:23] I don't know, I'm looking at this as like the best shot right now.

[13:26] It's like sort of like a three quarter angle shot.

[13:28] You've got like the monster with like the six eyes with the wings in the middle.

[13:34] You know, look, I heard someone say this and it's an interesting point.

[13:38] You know, Rick and Morty aren't even on the play field art.

[13:42] They're on a plastic to the left.

[13:46] And if this, to me, this game, it works for me.

[13:51] It's, you know, we're so used to seeing so much more detail on it on a play field.

[13:57] But with this game, it's much more simpler the approach.

[14:00] Now, I do think it works.

[14:02] I do think it works.

[14:03] I think the light show that's going to be on this game is going to be phenomenal.

[14:08] Would I have liked to see a little bit more detail on the play field artwork?

[14:12] The answer is yes.

[14:13] It does look to me a little flat, but the Rick and Morty artwork from the show is pretty

[14:19] flat.

[14:20] So they didn't, they didn't sort of go off and make the artwork more stylized than the

[14:25] show itself.

[14:26] Here's what I think when I saw this too.

[14:28] I just said that this game is just screaming for the mod community to come in and add

[14:34] scopes of the characters to the game.

[14:36] And that's the other thing I said is like, wow, there's like, there's really no three-dimensional

[14:41] characters on the play field.

[14:44] Like 3D Rick, 3D Morty, you know, Mr. Miseek's, like you can, it's like this flat world

[14:52] is just screaming to pop up and be more three-dimensional on the play field itself.

[14:58] Now, I know that the mod community is going to have a field day with this game.

[15:04] I mean, this game just screams, if I was like the mod couple or anyone making mods, Mise

[15:09] and mods, this game is like going to be your bread and butter.

[15:13] I mean, every one who owns a Rick and Morty game is going to add scopes into this game.

[15:19] Okay, so I think that's something that we're going to see come down the road.

[15:23] Obviously, the big design change that we haven't seen before in a pinball machine recently

[15:28] has been done before, but nothing modern is the pop bumper as the left slingshot.

[15:34] How does that play, right?

[15:36] I've heard from Scott that he loves it.

[15:37] He loved it so much he wanted to make both of them pop bumpers.

[15:42] I like that this is different.

[15:44] I do.

[15:45] I think that so much pinball is cookie cutter and I love seeing something different like

[15:49] that in the game.

[15:51] There's a magnet, you know, I love my magnets.

[15:53] There's a magnet on the right side for outlaying drains.

[15:57] We've seen that before we saw it in black night.

[15:59] There's two buttons on the right side of the game.

[16:02] The button is right next to the flipper button.

[16:05] It's not below it like where they normally put the magnet button.

[16:08] It's right next to it.

[16:09] So that's cool because I think you can just hit both.

[16:11] It might be easier to do it that way.

[16:13] Let's see what else.

[16:14] I mean, look, you know me, I don't like to go around a play field that you can just look

[16:17] at and go over everything.

[16:18] I'll say the things that stand out to me, this, I mean, you look, you can't be Canadian's

[16:23] pinball podcast and not comment about there being a spaceship on a spring.

[16:27] I mean, we ragged on, we ragged on the tie fighter on a spring forever when Star Wars was

[16:34] revealed.

[16:35] But I will say this at least this spaceship on a spring that the headlights work, which

[16:42] is really cool.

[16:43] And the LEDs or RGBs inside the spaceship work.

[16:47] And if you look at the spaceship, it's cool.

[16:49] There's like the silhouette of Rick and Morty inside that spaceship.

[16:53] But again, I think that's another item in which the mod community is going to go crazy

[16:58] and maybe make a more elaborately sculpted spaceship.

[17:02] That's cool.

[17:03] The house looks really cool.

[17:04] I love the fact that you can get into the garage.

[17:06] Yes, you can get into the garage.

[17:08] People are wondering if you can or cannot.

[17:10] The garage looks like the area where the, you know, when we saw the upside down on the

[17:13] play field, that's where the, there's like a subway that leads from underneath it.

[17:18] So I think that's going to be definitely a cool shot in the game.

[17:21] And look, the house, I just, you know, what's hard with all these photos is I don't get

[17:25] a sense of what it all feels like to stand over the game.

[17:28] Like how much of that world under glass is going to come to life?

[17:32] You know, people keep talking about a couple things.

[17:35] On the right ramp, there is a metal post just to the left of the ramp.

[17:40] And is that the final design?

[17:42] Like is the ball just going to whack at that thing?

[17:45] I don't know.

[17:46] A ball hitting metal.

[17:47] Is that, I don't know, that's really going to be what's there finally.

[17:51] Also you'll see the artwork for the me seeks, um, megacids.

[17:55] It's covered a little bit by the metal flap there by the ramp.

[17:59] This is a prototype game and that will be corrected for final production.

[18:04] All right.

[18:05] Now the right ramp that just sort of goes up and comes around back to the flipper.

[18:08] Uh, you know, I think we've seen straight ramps.

[18:11] They don't really do that much for me.

[18:13] But otherwise the game looks fun to shoot.

[18:15] I think the horseshoe up the middle is going to be fun.

[18:17] Uh, the scoop in the middle, I'm not so sure about, you know, the ball just goes in there

[18:21] and then comes right out.

[18:23] Um, and I also think they're going to want to put a, a, a cliffy there wherever there's

[18:28] a scoop.

[18:29] I don't understand why these games don't come with cliffies installed, but it is what it

[18:32] is.

[18:33] Okay.

[18:34] You know, look, I think the game looks good.

[18:36] I do.

[18:37] I think the game looks good.

[18:38] I can't tell if there's, it looks like there is, uh, there's side blade artwork.

[18:41] It looks like outer space artwork.

[18:43] It's hard to see the, the, I might want to redo those side blades because they're dark.

[18:47] They're like black.

[18:49] So I'm not sure if they light up like the galaxy, but right now there is side blade artwork

[18:54] in the game as well in the inner cabinet.

[18:56] All right.

[18:57] But again, like my thoughts, you, you get them.

[19:00] I think this game looks fun.

[19:02] We don't know much though.

[19:04] And you have to order today.

[19:05] And that's the big question on everyone's mind.

[19:07] You don't know, you don't know what the game is.

[19:09] You don't know what the game is.

[19:10] But here is the other part that I want to talk about.

[19:12] To me, this is probably the most important thing when you make up your mind today.

[19:17] And if you listen to Charlie talk about the game, he says when people ask about the coding in the game,

[19:23] that there is a lot more to add to this game and that they're going to be working on the coding for this game

[19:30] for the next 18 months people.

[19:33] So think about that for a minute.

[19:35] This game is pretty early on code wise.

[19:40] And they're going to be working on adding stuff for the next year and a half.

[19:44] Okay.

[19:44] Now we are back in stern territory now.

[19:48] And this was, I think Chuck did this too with Alice Cooper where you know, the game can be see,

[19:54] I don't know what level the game is at.

[19:58] And is this going to be a Batman 66 scenario where the game is pretty spartan when you get it?

[20:04] And the first people who get the game are just going to have a game that's pretty incomplete.

[20:08] It kind of sounds like that.

[20:10] And I'm a little worried that we don't know.

[20:14] We don't have a standard by which we know how far a game is along.

[20:18] We sometimes think 1.0 code is like when a game is finished.

[20:22] So what is this game at?

[20:24] Is it 0.46?

[20:26] Is it 0.8?

[20:28] I don't say porn.

[20:29] Is it porn 8.7?

[20:30] You know what I'm saying?

[20:31] We just don't know.

[20:33] And so without knowing that, are the early buyers going to get a game that's going to just sit and wait

[20:42] and have to wait months for more code to be available?

[20:45] And does it become more advantageous to just wait and get the game when the code is further along?

[20:53] I mean, it sounds like this game might not be done for 18 months.

[20:57] So then, you know, 18 months from now, think about 18 months

[21:01] when it comes to pinball game releases.

[21:03] Like, that's an eternity from now.

[21:06] We're going to see like 10 more stern games by then.

[21:09] We'll see two more Jersey Jack games by then.

[21:13] We'll see even deeproot games by then.

[21:15] You know, so then when 18 months from now, when that happens, you could pretty much get a

[21:21] new inbox, Rick and Morty game 18 months from now, when the code is done, and they'll have

[21:26] worked out all the kinks in the game.

[21:29] It all of a sudden starts to make you wonder, like, what should I do?

[21:34] Like, do I need it now?

[21:36] Or should I wait?

[21:37] I don't know.

[21:38] I really don't know.

[21:39] And we just don't have that much information.

[21:41] And I hope that's a fair take on this.

[21:43] And it's not a knock on the game because I think the game looks like a ton of fun.

[21:47] I still think they're going to sell every one, but it just makes me feel like everyone rushing

[21:54] through the door today is sort of playing with half a deck.

[21:59] And I hope that people get what they expect, especially the early adopters.

[22:06] Now they might not care.

[22:07] They have the game and they'll be happy with that.

[22:10] Now, what am I doing?

[22:11] What am I doing?

[22:12] I want one of these things.

[22:13] I do.

[22:14] But we're all the same, right?

[22:16] I feel like all of us wake up when we love pinball.

[22:19] We want every new pinball machine for a period of time.

[22:23] But I'll say this.

[22:24] Only on episode or sorry season two of the show, I'm loving it.

[22:29] And I think part of me just wants to support spooky pinball.

[22:33] And I think it would be great to have a spooky pinball game in here and enjoy it for a while.

[22:38] And maybe keep it if I really fall in love with it.

[22:41] And I don't see the harm in getting one early on.

[22:44] Other than the fact that I might get a game that's not that complete and I might be unsatisfied,

[22:49] especially me because it's like, this is going to be the one game that goes into my bedroom

[22:53] for a while.

[22:54] And if it's, if I have to wait for code for like a over a year, am I going to kick myself,

[23:00] right?

[23:01] Six months from now when maybe stranger things or toy store, your guns and roses, I don't

[23:05] know.

[23:06] I really don't know.

[23:07] But then I'm like, oh crap, I don't want to like miss out.

[23:10] I'm buying it.

[23:11] And then I have to wait a year to get one because they're all spoken for or they're just,

[23:14] that's how the build orders are going to be.

[23:16] Here's the reality though.

[23:17] We all know this.

[23:18] We all know this.

[23:19] One thing, one thing and one thing only, if you really want it and you want it now and

[23:26] you didn't get a spot, it's so easy to get one.

[23:29] It just requires one thing and that's money.

[23:32] You dangle a little bit more than someone paid for their spot and immediately they will

[23:37] give it up.

[23:38] It's, you know, I was telling my friend Derek, I was like, Derek, I could get a pie out

[23:42] to the Caribbean collector's edition tomorrow.

[23:44] He's like, no, they're none available.

[23:45] I'm like, well, you know, he didn't actually say that.

[23:48] That's my new thing.

[23:49] I'm going to start, I'm going to start attributing things he doesn't say.

[23:54] But all you got to do is this.

[23:55] I want to buy a pie out to the Caribbean collector's edition and I'm offering $17,000, right?

[24:01] And then I'll have one.

[24:02] I'll have like a few of them offered for sale immediately.

[24:05] You know, what's too grand when you're willing to spend 15 grand?

[24:08] That's the crazy way this hobby works, okay?

[24:10] Today is the day and once it opens up and do we think it's going to sell out?

[24:15] I mean, we're talking 9 a.m. at 9 a.m. Benton, Wisconsin time, which is 9 a.m. Central

[24:23] time, which is only an hour and 15 minutes from now.

[24:28] So by the time this show is up, we are going to only have a little bit over an hour before

[24:34] the insanity starts.

[24:36] Now distributors are still your best bet.

[24:39] I think you need to get in on a distributor list.

[24:42] Now I talked to a big distributor last night.

[24:44] I'm not going to say who.

[24:45] And I said, how many do you have?

[24:47] And he said, I get a hundred of them.

[24:49] I said, awesome.

[24:51] How long is your list for Rick and Morty over 100, Chris?

[24:56] Okay.

[24:57] So that means someone's going to miss out and have to find another distributor.

[25:00] So the demand is there.

[25:03] The demand is there.

[25:04] Now you know how it is in this hobby.

[25:06] Will the demand be there in 24 hours?

[25:09] Will the demand be there in 48 hours?

[25:11] Let me think, it was somewhat smart not to show too much of the game because this is,

[25:16] Spooky's learning a valuable lesson in marketing.

[25:20] The more you show of something, the more you show, the more you might show stuff that people

[25:27] don't like.

[25:29] And the less you show, the easier it is to keep more of what the game has in it inside

[25:37] people's imaginations.

[25:38] You see what I'm saying there?

[25:40] The more this game continues to have curiosity and we're dreaming about what the game is

[25:46] like, that's actually a more valuable emotion to play off of with people when you want them

[25:53] to buy it.

[25:55] So less is actually more when it comes to it.

[25:58] You know when people say like, I want to see Jack James or stream it for four hours before

[26:02] I make up my mind.

[26:03] You know, the marketer in me is like, no, that's the last thing I would do.

[26:07] That's the last thing I would do.

[26:09] I want to sell you my game.

[26:12] I want to give you just enough to satiate your appetite for it.

[26:16] And I think they gave us enough to make up our mind on the game.

[26:19] I do.

[26:20] I look at this pinball guy.

[26:21] There's a steel ball bouncing around doing loops, doing orbits, going into garages on

[26:26] it.

[26:27] Look, you do guys know pinball well enough by now that you can actually imagine what the

[26:31] ball is going to be like flying around that game.

[26:33] You know Scott Denise.

[26:34] He makes fun games.

[26:35] Why would he stop here?

[26:37] He made a fun.

[26:38] He made one of the most fun pinball games with less than most than most stern games.

[26:44] And it's just more fun and more engaging.

[26:46] He's been working on this for two years.

[26:48] Do you think Scott Denise, after two years of working on this game, is going to put a

[26:52] game out there that's not fun when Chuck is telling us way to hear these call outs.

[26:56] I mean, they have me laughing for hours.

[26:58] Do you think he's going to say like, oh, yeah, you're going to turn this game on and it's

[27:01] not fun?

[27:02] Because here's what I think.

[27:04] Rick and Morty is going to just be like a different kind of pinball experience.

[27:08] The humor in this show, it's going to be so irreverent and over the top.

[27:13] I think it's going to make so many stern games when it comes to humor feel like like like

[27:20] G rated movies for kiddies.

[27:22] Like how pathetic is it?

[27:24] How pathetic is it?

[27:25] Think about like this.

[27:26] How pathetic is it that Rick and Morty is going to give you that adult humor you want?

[27:30] And stern release Deadpool, who is the Marvel universe's irreverent like adult theme character.

[27:37] And they don't even have any curse words in Deadpool, right?

[27:40] Deadpool's for kiddies.

[27:41] It's for your little kiddies.

[27:43] Deadpool comes to us already in parent mode.

[27:45] But this game's going to come to us.

[27:48] I can't wait.

[27:49] Like this game's going to call us all sorts of names.

[27:51] It's going to like insult us as the player.

[27:54] It's going to be the kind of game when people come over your game room and they hear it.

[27:58] I think it's just going to have what I think is one of the most important elements of any

[28:03] pinball game.

[28:04] And it's what most Valley Williams games had.

[28:07] This is the most important element in pinball.

[28:09] It's personality.

[28:11] This game is just going to ooze personality.

[28:14] And it's going to be fun to turn it on and flip it every time.

[28:17] I just I know it.

[28:18] I know it.

[28:19] I'm willing to bet my my podcast on that that this game's going to be fun.

[28:24] It's going to have a ton of personality in it.

[28:27] And it's going to be unlike any pinball machine you currently own.

[28:30] How's that?

[28:31] Now here's the other part though.

[28:33] I just want to say this because this is the other thing that just that just that just

[28:36] stuck out when I was like thinking about it.

[28:39] It's still a spooky game.

[28:41] And now that we're at this price point, I do think you know some people were waiting to

[28:46] see something that was going to be at the same level of a sternalee the same level as

[28:51] a Jersey Jack pinball machine.

[28:54] The same level as a Chicago gaming company game because now the prices are written.

[28:58] Spooky's right in there with the prices.

[29:01] And spooky has come a long way.

[29:03] But you know, I do look at this game and I do say to myself it's they're not at that level

[29:07] yet.

[29:08] They're just not.

[29:09] It's just not there.

[29:12] But what they're giving us is is the best version of a spooky game to date with the

[29:17] theme that's big.

[29:19] And that's just a decision we all have to make.

[29:22] It is now at the point where you know these games are costing a lot of money.

[29:29] There's no way around it.

[29:30] Like this is not a stern.

[29:31] There's no pro version of Rick and Morty.

[29:33] Okay.

[29:35] This game is $7,000 right?

[29:37] So you know, and then you add on stuff that you're going to want and you get stuff there

[29:41] pretty quickly.

[29:42] So that just is something that everyone out there has to decide.

[29:46] Like is it worth it?

[29:48] Personally, I like that we have this boutique company that's actually delivering games.

[29:54] There are some pros and cons to buying a game from spooky pinball.

[29:58] You have to wait a long time.

[30:00] The code's not done.

[30:03] And the wait's the big issue.

[30:04] If there was no wait, if spooky could get 750 people, there are games in two months, they

[30:10] would sell every one.

[30:11] They would sell every one.

[30:12] And I still think they're going to sell every one.

[30:15] But the wait will be painful.

[30:16] There is no way around it.

[30:18] You are going to have a painfully long wait if you have a high number.

[30:22] But for a lot of people out there, they're okay with it, you know, because here's the

[30:26] thing.

[30:27] All you're doing is locking in that $1,000 or $1,500 bucks.

[30:31] They're not going to come knocking for more money until your game is ready.

[30:35] So it's not like you have to spend all of that money.

[30:39] It's not like you're locking up that much capital.

[30:41] You still can spend money on other games over the years and buy and sell games and flip

[30:47] games and do whatever you want in Pimball for 18 months.

[30:50] And only when your game is about to go on the line, are they going to ask for that additional

[30:55] income from you?

[30:56] So just remember that too.

[30:57] It's not like you're out everything for that long of time.

[31:00] Okay.

[31:01] All right.

[31:02] So here's the deal.

[31:03] I'm going to wrap up this episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[31:05] You know, I think it's an exciting day.

[31:07] I think it's an anxious day for people.

[31:10] I think whenever a new Pimball machine enters the world, we have butterflies and we have

[31:16] head scratching going on.

[31:18] And I guess the final question, and then I'll let you go.

[31:21] Sorry, I always ramble.

[31:23] Was this game living up to the hype?

[31:25] And I think the answer today, Monday, was it December 16th, is we don't know yet?

[31:32] We just don't know yet if this game lives up to the hype.

[31:36] And I think that's a fair assessment at this point.

[31:38] I think people have to roll the dice a little bit, right?

[31:41] Now, before I let you go, one final thing.

[31:45] The other thing we've been talking about is Stern Pimball's next game.

[31:49] And when will we see it and will it rain on this parade?

[31:52] Are they going to drop something this week?

[31:54] Now, I want to tell you something I heard from a little birdie who's played Stern's

[31:58] next game, who's seen Stern's next game.

[32:02] And this is an interesting thing.

[32:05] And you take away what you will with this comment.

[32:09] But I heard that Stern's next game is a bit of a head scratcher.

[32:14] I heard that Canada's pinball podcast and this person knows me, knows my personality.

[32:20] He said, Chris, you are going to have a field day with Stern's next game, both good and

[32:28] bad.

[32:29] And I can't wait to see it because I think it's just going to open up a ton of content

[32:34] for you to talk about.

[32:35] So what does that mean?

[32:36] Right?

[32:37] What does that mean?

[32:38] That there's going to be something good in this game?

[32:40] Maybe the good is the theme, stranger things.

[32:42] And maybe bad is just the way they executed it.

[32:45] But I'm here to tell you that I think Stern's next game isn't going to be this holy cow

[32:51] like universal home run game.

[32:53] I can't wait.

[32:54] I'm excited because you know what?

[32:55] I feel like they're stalling right now.

[32:57] Come on, Stern, nobody cares about all of Ira no more.

[33:00] Get the next game out.

[33:02] Come on.

[33:03] If you're going to have games on location next week, you have to reveal it this week.

[33:07] What a great time.

[33:08] What a great time to be alive in the pinball world with all this stuff coming out, competing

[33:12] for our dollars.

[33:13] All right, everybody.

[33:14] Email me.

[33:15] I would love to hear what your opinions are about spooky pinballs game.

[33:19] Canada pinball at gmail.com.

[33:22] And look, you've got a little in an hour from now, you've got to order this game if you're

[33:26] going to order it.

[33:27] So get going.

[33:28] By the time this podcast, if you listen to the end of it, you're already too late.

[33:31] It might have sold out.

[33:32] Have a great day, everybody.

[33:33] We'll talk to you soon.
