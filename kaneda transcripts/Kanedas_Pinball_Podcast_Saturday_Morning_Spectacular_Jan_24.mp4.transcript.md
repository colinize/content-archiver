[02:05] We're talking pinball, baby.

[02:08] We're talking pinball in the house.

[02:10] We got my coffee.

[02:12] We're ready to rock.

[02:13] We're ready to roll.

[02:15] I need a better setup, but like until then, until all are one, here we go.

[02:21] I don't know why I'm so far.

[02:25] Does that sound good?

[02:29] All right.

[02:31] How are we off?

[02:32] Sounded great.

[02:33] Looking great.

[02:34] Feeling great.

[02:35] Life is great.

[02:37] Life is short.

[02:57] We're going to get the snowfall.

[02:59] But no Pokemon.

[03:01] We continue to wait for Pokemon.

[03:03] Everybody's waiting for Pokemon.

[03:05] Stern just can't get Pokemon out.

[03:08] What's going on with the Pokemon?

[03:10] Wait, give me something.

[03:13] Give me something.

[03:15] I mean, just clean this.

[03:16] Hold on.

[03:19] There we go.

[03:21] There we go.

[04:29] can't turn this damn camera around Facebook still does not allow you to mirror the image it's so

[04:34] annoying I don't know why like what what's the point why did they decide to do that it absolutely

[04:41] makes no sense I never should have upgraded anyone else just not excited for whatever comes out of

[04:46] Stern anymore the honeymoon period is over um here's the thing I will never count Stern out

[04:55] I keep hearing Transformers is the game I keep hearing Pokemon is going to be mediocre so I'm

[05:01] not expecting a banger in Pokemon I'm expecting Transformers to have a lot more in it this is

[05:08] coming from people that have seen both games do I think it will make it to pinball at the beach

[05:18] um no no I think Beetlejuice is gonna own that show

[05:26] I uh man I wish I could go I really do I just I can't make it this year I just can't

[05:33] Brenda is I could try to get a babysitter I just can't make it

[05:38] I can't make it it's also Super Bowl weekend oh I just I just can't make it I wish it was any other

[05:48] weekend other than Super Bowl weekend I also you guys know this I've been talking about this

[05:53] recently uh

[05:55] uh you know since our company got acquired they significantly reduced the amount of

[06:00] vacation days people can take luckily I'm on the better side of that curve but I mean it went from

[06:06] unlimited to very limited so there is a lot of unhappy people in the organization I look at it

[06:15] all now my kind of attitude on life as I approach 50 years of age is que sera sera I just don't know

[06:22] I don't know what benefit there is to complain about things that you can't change.

[06:26] And I don't think there's any benefit to complaining to people in the company online.

[06:32] Like people go on the company chat and complain about the company.

[06:36] And I'm like, why would you do this?

[06:37] They just bought us.

[06:38] Like, you don't know who knows who.

[06:40] I learned this lesson long ago.

[06:42] Anybody can screen grab anything.

[06:45] And Ryan McQuaid knows this, right?

[06:47] Anyone can screen grab anything and send it up the ladder to the new holding company.

[06:54] And do you want your name on something that is disparaging them?

[06:58] They just bought us.

[07:00] So I go into the whole thing with an open mind.

[07:04] Yeah, the benefits aren't as good, but I still have a job.

[07:07] So I'm happy to still have a job.

[07:09] The day will come when I don't have a job anymore in this industry.

[07:14] Nobody retires in my industry.

[07:16] They say.

[07:17] Send you out to pasture way before you want to be out to pasture.

[07:21] The problem I see in all the marketing is that like companies forget that there are

[07:26] people 40 to 60 years old that have most of the money in the world.

[07:30] And so you would think as I get to 40 to 60, that I would be the most in demand in the

[07:37] marketing world because those people have the most money, have the most purchasing power

[07:42] with a brand.

[07:44] Problem is these companies all think to future proof.

[07:46] They're business.

[07:47] They need to target like Gen Z.

[07:49] Then it'll be Gen Alpha.

[07:50] And like, just because I don't know what six, seven means you're no longer valuable, but it's silly because I can connect to the largest buying demographic they have.

[08:03] And yet, for some reason, when you get 40 to 60 in my industry, you're started to be looked at as old and out of touch.

[08:11] It's weird.

[08:12] It's weird.

[08:13] I don't feel that way.

[08:14] I.

[08:15] Maybe.

[08:16] Maybe.

[08:16] Maybe because just in my head, I don't really feel like I've matured past the age of like 20.

[08:25] Her weight in chamber of commerce.

[08:26] That's funny.

[08:28] So there's going to be 10 show games of Beetlejuice at pinball at the beach.

[08:32] Super excited to see that game make its way out there.

[08:35] They just did another video of like a row of them.

[08:37] Where's the row of Winchester's?

[08:40] There's a row of them.

[08:42] And they look amazing.

[08:44] I think it's one of the most stunning pinball machines.

[08:46] Of all time.

[08:47] And I'm so happy that this game is going to start making its way out there.

[08:51] For those of you who have one coming, it's a very special game.

[08:54] It looks like a very special game.

[08:56] Um, I did get a cryptic email.

[09:00] I got a very cryptic email that there is a major mechanical design flaw in Beetlejuice from, uh, an email that won't reveal themselves to me.

[09:14] But I was like, ah, I was like, I don't know.

[09:15] I don't know, man.

[09:17] This is the same.

[09:18] Uh, yeah, it was the same, uh, same guy that sent me the Ryan McQuaid chat.

[09:24] So I'm like, well, right.

[09:25] Well, I, I, I'm happy to report anything.

[09:29] Someone just sent me to some, uh, I don't know.

[09:32] There's there's there's stuff.

[09:33] I get sent stuff all the time gang.

[09:35] And I, I just like, if you want to tell me and prove something to me, I'll, you know, me, I'll discuss anything on my show.

[09:41] I don't, I don't think anything is out of bounds.

[09:43] Yeah.

[09:44] Yeah.

[09:44] Yeah.

[09:44] Yeah.

[09:44] Yeah.

[09:44] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] 

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:46] Yeah.

[09:46] Yeah.

[09:46] Yeah.

[09:46] Yeah.

[09:46] 

[09:46] 

[09:46] Yeah.

[09:47] 

[09:47] Yeah.

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] 

[10:15] of how to get people's attention and how to create excitement and hype around a brand and how to make

[10:21] a brand contagious and how to make products uh fly off the shelves like the formulas to do that

[10:26] have never changed and so it's funny to me that we we try to put people in boxes and then you know

[10:33] then marketing is always like we gotta break the mold we gotta break the box we gotta swim against

[10:38] the current and we gotta you know and that's the funny thing about everything in life right now

[10:42] is the is like all the analytics all the ai all the formulas will never get you in a million years

[10:52] to dilly dilly and i say this to this day that was probably the greatest bud light campaign of

[11:00] all time what in a million years would ever lead you to dilly dilly and yet it was amazing

[11:10] and when they let go of dilly dilly

[11:12] and then they tried to be all things to all people and this is my client it's my brand you

[11:15] know look what happened and now they're going back to more of like what they are about which

[11:21] is easy to drink beer for dudes that love beer that want to sit down and watch football or ufc

[11:29] at a barbecue or and and just drink bud lights all day long because it's enjoyable 100 it is

[11:38] you know and again i'm disclosing that i work for bud light but when i go to

[11:42] the bar now and you know look you could have for me i could have two kinds of nights like i could

[11:47] do my vodka soda on the rocks with a splat a vodka on the rocks tito's on the rocks splashes soda and

[11:53] lime i could have that kind of night that's usually like when i'm like oh man i don't want

[11:59] to be hung over i don't want to like you know i don't want a belly i could have that kind of night

[12:06] well michael job ulcers my client too i love ultra i love all i love all the abm bed products i love

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:02] 

[12:12] beer you know I love beer I could have that kind of night I could have my

[12:18] old-fashioned Manhattan kind of night I could have a beard beer night now for me

[12:26] beer is usually like my day drink of choice because if I start drinking

[12:30] Tito's and old-fashioned at lunch like I'm on the bed I'm on the bed by like

[12:37] three o'clock useless all day what's up 83 guys how you guys doing sad boy what's

[12:49] up baby how much money can we raise on this show how about this how about this

[12:54] how about this if we raise now I can't do it want to tell you a little

[13:05] something about Sonic mmm

[13:07] you

[13:07] can't do it want to tell you a little something about Sonic

[13:08] every penny we raise will go to Brenda I will hand it to her and say thank you my

[13:13] community loves you more Evil Dead being sold Kelly Daniels says man um I want to

[13:23] start what we'll talk about Stern Pokemon like I you know I put up the

[13:27] Walking Dead no one bought the game the Walking Dead remastered is probably got

[13:33] Seth fuming over there the fact that Stern got that

[13:37] so wrong is really indicative in my honest opinion of a company that's missing the mark big time.

[13:49] There is no way Stern Pinball with all of their knowledge of this community should ever

[13:55] create such a failure of a remastered. If you can't pick the right game to remaster,

[14:00] you are so out of touch with the pinball community. And I think you can't bury this

[14:08] reality around this game. This is Stern Pinball's marketing at its worst. They don't talk to the

[14:16] community. They easily could have done a poll. What would be the secret? We know they're doing

[14:23] remasters. Think about how stupid they've become by insulating themselves in such an arrogant way

[14:30] that they know what we want more than we know what we want. And I say this and I mean this

[14:37] because I love George and I love the company. I do. I'm saying this candidly because if I was

[14:44] just talking to them like as bros in a room, Seth, Gary, George, George, Seth, Gary, what are you

[14:49] doing? Everybody knows we're doing remasters. So why is it a secret? Which is the next one?

[14:56] Who cares? Like whoever, whatever we remaster,

[15:00] it's not a secret. It's not a secret. It's not a secret. It's not a secret. It's not a secret.

[15:00] It's not going to make anyone who owns the game currently happy. So forget about that. Just the

[15:06] whole essence of remastering, you're always going to piss those people off. Okay, we can't win there.

[15:11] But what we can't do is spend a year remastering a game and then it fails. The only reason we

[15:20] should ever remake a game is we know that that's going to put this many units back into the world

[15:25] and this many millions of dollars in our pockets. And if we're not even going to ask the community,

[15:30] out of our portfolio of games, which ones would you like to return for one final run?

[15:41] Have you noticed too, that they don't even talk in those kinds of finalities. They don't even tell

[15:49] you this is it. Like it should be, this should be like when we remaster a game, we do one run of it

[15:54] and whatever orders we get, they're not going to do that. Okay. So they keep it open. Fine.

[15:59] But why didn't they?

[16:00] At least survey the community. Would you like to see kiss ACDC? Would you like to see Tron?

[16:06] And look, just put the stuff that's doable. They're never remastering Lord of the Rings.

[16:12] And I wish George would just say so. Like this company is so cheap. They wouldn't even license

[16:18] a Jeep to put in Jurassic park. They wouldn't even license the empire state building to go

[16:24] into King Kong. They're not going to go renegotiate a contract with all the,

[16:30] all of those celebrities for that trilogy. Never again. Will we get like the game, the code as it is,

[16:37] is kind of perfect. It doesn't really need clips to be honest. Like I would just reanimate the Lord

[16:42] of the Rings clips and put it on. I don't even think they can do that. I don't think they can

[16:46] get the license again, but here's the thing. They didn't do this. They didn't survey anybody.

[16:54] They went down a road and it is a colossal failure.

[16:58] There's only five.

[16:59] There's only five.

[17:00] 

[17:00] 

[17:00] 

[17:00] There's only five.

[17:00] 

[17:00] There's only five.

[17:00] There's only five total pin side pages right now.

[17:06] If can someone start a pin side thread right now? And I guarantee you by this time next week,

[17:11] it'll have way more than five pages. The thing is they'll shut it down. We'll probably get more,

[17:16] more than five pages before it's even shut down. If you just put up a thread that said,

[17:21] what do you think of Canada? Right? Someone do that right now. Just put it up. Let's see if

[17:26] it gets locked. Even by the time that shows over who has the goals and say, Hey,

[17:30] Canada just wants to test to see, you know, how he, Canada just wants to do a survey of like what

[17:35] people think about him. Cause he wants to know where to improve, uh, with the pinball community

[17:40] to make content that makes everybody, you know, happy. Okay. Uh, a survey about me. What do you

[17:47] think about Canada? Love them, hate them, enjoy them entertained by him. I don't care. I could

[17:51] take any of the feedback that would have more than five pages within a day. It would, you know,

[17:58] it would, we I'd, I'd get the obligatory.

[18:00] insults from Iceman saying what a terrible person I am. Neil McRae would call me a clown.

[18:07] Um, I, you know, my, my, my, uh, fans would, would, would tiptoe in, but probably not say anything.

[18:12] You know how it is. It's it's it's you can't publicly say you listen to Canada. I'm like

[18:16] McDonald's nobody eats there. Yep. The numbers are amazing, right? That this is Canada's pinball

[18:22] podcast. So they didn't ask anybody. And then this game comes out and it's a flop and it's been,

[18:29] you know,

[18:30] King Kong was a flop. You know what? I have a friend of a friend who's trying to sell a King

[18:35] Kong Ellie for 9,800. Not, he said, I didn't get a single offer, not a single offer.

[18:43] You know, I was thinking about zombie Yeti the other day. I got an idea for Mr. Jeremy Packer,

[18:48] who I do love Jeremy. I don't know why he, uh, he got mad at me. I don't know why he accused me of

[18:52] ruining his life, his family. I have an idea, Jeremy, here's an idea for you because Jeremy,

[18:57] you are talented, but you, you, you oversaturated yourself.

[19:00] You've been on too much and you've been giving your talents too frequently. And that's why as

[19:05] an artist, it's just becomes oversaturation. It's just, and then, you know, not to mention

[19:09] the colors have been a little oversaturated as well, but here's, here's my suggestion, Jeremy.

[19:15] I think you should be looking at you're the art director at Stern pinball right now, Jeremy,

[19:20] here's a, here's an idea. Why is Harry Potter doing so well? Why is the CE outselling the $10,000.

[19:29] Speaker 1

[19:29] it's 50% more money and it's outselling it like almost 10 to one, the arcade edition. Why is that

[19:37] Jeremy? Because there's a unique art package on the CE, right? And it comes with the topper,

[19:44] which is ugly. It's this it's more about the art package, right?

[19:47] I think that what Jeremy should suggest is that his art only goes on the Ellie version of the game.

[19:59] Speaker 1

[20:00] Okay. That seems smart. There should be a drastic difference between the $13,000 Ellie and the 10,

[20:12] $9,500 premium drastic difference. And there should be a colossal difference between a $6,500

[20:21] pro and a $13,000 Ellie. So Jeremy Packer,

[20:54] edition of the game's art a pro edition should have like just the logo on it it should be as

[21:00] it should have nowhere near like anything closely as nice as the le art then you should do something

[21:07] different with the premium maybe get a different artist do something right commission it out

[21:14] and then you take the le only this way you only have to do one

[21:18] it seems like a good idea doesn't it sounds like an idea from a guy that works at a marketing

[21:26] company that bills out at a ridiculous amount every hour how dare you canada how dare you give

[21:34] me a good idea that would free up my time that would add value to the le which we desperately

[21:40] need how dare you give us free ideas when we sent you walking and hired a cmo that hasn't had a

[21:47] single good idea

[21:48] yet. How dare you? How dare you make such sense of it all? How dare you know this hobby so damn

[21:57] well because you've been studying it intimately for 13 years, not just the hobby, the people.

[22:04] How dare you bring your public relations skills and ideas to our company as we flounder making

[22:12] the same stupid mistakes time and time again? How dare you, Kaneda? You are a toxic member of

[22:19] the community with all of this bright thinking. How dare you bring your boarding school education

[22:24] to this niche little hobby of ours? They're not going to make the premium less desirable.

[22:34] Yeah, they should. It doesn't have to be ugly, man, but yeah. That's like saying,

[22:41] Porsche only sells this.

[22:42] They don't have too many Turbo S's, so they're not going to make it like the 911. Yeah. The more

[22:48] expensive version of something should be more desirable. The middle of the road version should

[22:54] be less desirable. Did I do a drunken F Stern rant because they snubbed you? No, I didn't do

[23:09] any drunken rants. I don't. Stern did not.

[23:12] First of all, let me just be clear. If Stern offered me the job as the CMO of Stern,

[23:18] I guarantee you it pays less money than I make. I could almost guarantee that.

[23:24] Okay. Maybe, look, also like, to be honest, seeing what Stern had in the mix,

[23:34] it's a terrible job to have right now. I wouldn't want to be the CMO

[23:38] whose job is to sell that Star Wars.

[23:42] Or that King Kong. I wouldn't. Now, look, I do think this new year with the titles coming out,

[23:49] I think this CMO needs to, you know, I think we need to see some real, real ideas come to fruition.

[23:56] I do. I just, you know, because I have no interest anymore in the George Gomez sort of,

[24:03] what do we always call them? The damage control tour he goes on every time there's a new game out,

[24:08] right? It's always the same thing. Like, oh, we couldn't do this. We couldn't do this.

[24:11] You hear spooky pinball.

[24:12] We couldn't, we couldn't, we couldn't. No, it's like, we did, we did, we did, we did. We innovated,

[24:15] we innovated. We put this, we did this. Where do you see Sonic the Hedgehog? What we did,

[24:19] what we got. You know, when I talked to Brett Abbas, he's like, Chris, let me tell you,

[24:23] like, I needed this in the game. Like, I'm not stopping till we get it. I'm like, bro,

[24:29] if only you were a billionaire and you, you know what I'm saying? Like, I love when I hear Brett

[24:34] talk because he's like, bro, like, if we're going to do it, we're going to do it right. And I'm not

[24:38] going to stop until, like, I need this thing in Sonic the Hedgehog. He's like, I'm going to get it.

[24:43] It's amazing. You don't hear Stern talk like that.

[24:47] Brett could buy Stern pinball tomorrow and he would be like, he wouldn't even like feel it,

[24:51] like in his account. He'd be like, did we, what happened here? Did we go out to dinner last night

[24:55] or did we buy Stern? You know what I'm saying? That's why I love Brett. I love hanging with

[24:59] the dude. It's just so fun. Like his dad's amazing. Like it's good. They're good people.

[25:03] They're good people. You look, George is great people too. They really like, I, you know, look,

[25:09] I, none of the people I bring up, I bring up, I bring up, I bring up, I bring up, I bring up,

[25:12] I bring up here are bad people. Like, you know what I'm saying? The bad people have all failed.

[25:17] Okay. And you know who they are. I won't name his name. American pinball,

[25:21] Damien, I'll name Marty, um, J-pop, right. Robert Mueller. Like these are the real bad people.

[25:31] Like the people that knowingly Kevin Kulik, like all the bad people have failed.

[25:37] And it's, it's like, it's weird how life works out like that. Like karma just has a,

[25:42] way about it. Right. The good people, the good people with the good hearts and the good

[25:46] intentions, you know, they're still around. They're still around. Like Jerry Stellenberg

[25:51] is a good guy. He's still around. Chris Turner is a great guy. He's still around.

[25:56] You know, it's a good people last.

[26:01] Canada threads have taken over pin side. Is that, is it true? Hold on. Let me see.

[26:07] It's amazing. I love that. We've just like thread bombed pin side.

[26:12] Oh my God. Let me see.

[26:17] Can hate it. What do you think about getting it? It's amazing.

[26:22] We got two threads up. Yeah. They won't last.

[26:28] Yeah. Thank you guys for putting them up. We'll see how long they last.

[26:32] I love, you know, you know what I love the most is like the hate. I love when I love how much,

[26:37] how much some people hate me. It's, it's mind boggling.

[26:42] I think we have the most entertaining conversation about pinball on a weekly basis.

[26:47] I do. And you know, you know, like, like Ralph, Don, Kale, Jamie, like we're all chilling. Like

[26:55] we're all having Jenga's. We're all just chilling, like having fun, like chatting behind the scenes,

[27:00] Carrie Hardy, you know, like everyone's gets along. There's, there's nobody,

[27:06] there's nobody that does this like weekly that, that like hates Canada.

[27:12] Because we all have a mutual respect for each other. We literally make this niche hobby that

[27:17] never has news exciting on a weekly basis for so many people. The fact that I give it away for $5

[27:23] a month, like $5 a month to get the amount of content you get, the amount of time it takes.

[27:28] And this is why like, I couldn't do a show yesterday because I just so busy at work

[27:32] to get in the gym and a podcast and the kids to, to daycare and do all my work and get some sleep

[27:40] and keep Brenda happy.

[27:42] And then put food on the table for $5 a month. It's crazy. Right. And I don't, and I said,

[27:47] I'm never raising that amount. Like I should, there are people out there. Hector, my good friend,

[27:52] Hector is like, dude, just raise it to 10. Even if you lose like 200 people, like, you know,

[27:58] you'll make more money. I know, I know, but it's the principle. It's the principle. So I think each

[28:05] and every one of you who is a subscriber, um, it's, it's, it's been great doing it. I still love the

[28:11] fact.

[28:12] That when the show went behind the paywall, everybody who made content insulted that move.

[28:17] Now everybody does it. It's like, wait, why? You know what? Cause what ha what started happening

[28:26] was these guys, like it didn't even take like, like calculus to figure out like, wait a minute.

[28:32] Wait a minute. We're telling everybody we do this because we love it. We don't do it for the money.

[28:37] Yeah. But he's looking like he's having a good time, bro. And he's making enough to buy a couple

[28:41] of pinballs.

[28:42] Yeah.

[28:41] Yeah.

[28:42] Yeah.

[28:42] Yeah.

[28:42] Yeah.

[28:42] machines a year like maybe we should think about this yeah well canada that boring school bastard

[28:49] how dare his parents ship him away to school for the finest education money could buy and how dare

[28:55] he drop out of eco 101 at lehigh university and study communications because it was all chicks in

[29:01] the classes and it was easier and he underachieved and then he started working in pr and he should

[29:06] have stayed in finance we wouldn't be having this conversation right now he'd be like a business

[29:11] owner and not a worker be how dare he self-deprecate himself like this because i'm supposed

[29:17] to hate him he sounds like he hates himself at times he sounds like he's so honestly brutal about

[29:25] his own upbringing what is wrong with this guy what's he gonna say next does he even play pinball

[29:34] that's my favorite uh cliff albert friend of the show hit me up he's like dude man he's like

[29:39] i just play now i don't even

[29:41] care about collecting it's so much more fun everyone who plays pinball is having a good

[29:44] time everyone who's collecting is always complaining every day so i'm like all right well

[29:48] you know it's i don't know i think it's the i i feel like i'm in the middle the best of both

[29:53] worlds i i love talking to the collectors and i love hearing from people that play on on location

[29:58] and waste their life away to win 40 bucks in a trans light you know what i'm saying it's like

[30:02] i get it i get it you're bored so you want to take four hours out of your evening and go win

[33:25] no forgiveness from neil what do you mean

[33:29] neil you know what i always get along great at the shows all right let's talk about american pinball

[33:35] um here's the thing i am i i reached out to ronald to do an interview i see he's been doing

[33:43] interviews which which i'm happy to see i can check out his interviews he's been talking to people

[33:48] but i'm almost on the fence now whether or not i even want to interview american pinball right now

[33:53] and let me give you my rationale because i was thinking about it over the week and i'm like you

[33:57] know what like because you know as i started to learn more about what they're doing right now like

[34:02] they're making legends of valhalla again i'm kind of like what more more more of all the games nobody

[34:10] wants and so here's here's my feeling kelly daniel thank you for the 20 bucks kelly i really

[34:20] appreciate it let's make a goal i think we can get to 200 on this one can we do that gang

[34:34] oh no um

[34:40] i'm my mom had um surgery yesterday just uh on her heart a little stint put in

[34:47] uh they said there's an issue like just a little text popped up

[34:54] tried to go down today my dad was like she's resting she's you know they're like a half

[34:57] hour away let me tell you something everybody like you know we all know life is short and

[35:03] you know i i'm very happy and very blessed to still have both of my parents here i love them

[35:09] so much and i

[35:10] just yeah it's just hard seeing your parents get older it's really hard and they slow down and they

[35:19] you know my what what's what i love about my parents like even though like their bodies are

[35:23] physically slowing down and obviously they're aged they're they've aged their minds are still

[35:28] so sharp though my mom is still working she's still working at 83 or 84. she still works

[35:35] she has an art gallery she's still framing every day like five days a week

[35:41] and she's like very much like me she has nobody helping her

[35:46] because she is a creative that doesn't want to hear anybody's opinion about what to do i'm so

[35:52] my mother's son it's scary and um yeah so if you wonder where i got it from it's not my dad my dad

[36:00] is much more like even keel much more like my dad is not loud he's not he's not ostentatious he's not

[36:11] flashy he's you you my dad would walk down the street and you wouldn't think anything

[36:15] like there goes like someone who has anything more than just like you know an average lifestyle

[36:23] i mean he kind of does have an average life i mean

[36:26] does drive a porsche but but you know that you would never get any any like arrogance from him

[36:32] or like ego or anything but the stories he could tell are insane anyway this is kind of i after

[36:40] this i just want to check in with her but everybody say um say a good prayer for my mama

[36:45] i think she's fine i think you know it's just there's usually post post you know there's always

[36:50] a few issues that pop up you know post a procedure like this you know i will say in in the years i've

[36:56] been doing this podcast i've had a lot of you talk about more of your personal things happening and

[37:05] and and i always appreciate that connection because i think sometimes in this hobby we can we can get to

[37:10] to the surface level of only talking about pinball but i think what what always makes this

[37:14] community and especially my community is is people are deeper connected than just the pinball the

[37:20] pinball is just like i always say this it's just like your hand stamped you can now get back into

[37:24] the club and and you can now talk with people that are like-minded like you that are into the same

[37:30] thing as you are but from there that's not where the really interesting and the indelible uh bonds

[37:37] are formed between people it's not just like a one-on-one conversation between people it's not just

[37:40] like a one-on-one conversation between people it's not just like a one-on-one conversation between

[37:40] because the games are not nearly as exciting enough to create that it's the people

[37:44] it's the people because we a lot of us grew up during the same period i think we all have a

[37:48] longing to reconnect to the 80s and 90s a lot of us some of you maybe it's the 70s some of you

[37:55] might be the 60s and 70s but i think everybody in in our circles has a longing to just stay

[38:03] connected with people that knew the world when it was much better and and i think you know where

[38:10] were generations that would oh those kids but it's true you know it's not even subjective anymore

[38:18] you look at young young kids now they are longing to have analog good times they are longing

[38:25] the thought of like going into like a record store for a few hours and just flipping through records

[38:31] remember going into like tower records and they had the listening rooms remember that those days

[38:37] like a new album came out and you could go into those booths and press the button and hear

[38:41] hear it like one track two track and then you bought the cd

[38:47] physically had the the media you know what i'm saying you physically had the content you had

[38:52] the dvd you had the cd you remember the case logic books we had in our cars the fact that

[38:58] we're all here and didn't crash our cars flipping through case logics trying to find the next cd

[39:07] put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape

[39:13] put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape

[39:16] put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape

[39:20] put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape

[39:26] put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape

[39:30] put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape put down on tape

[39:33] Oh, man.

[39:36] I stay far away from that drama I don't really like.

[39:42] But this is the world, though.

[39:45] I mean, look, everyone has the freedom to make whatever they want to make.

[39:52] Oh, man.

[39:53] Jay Cummings with the 50 bucks.

[39:55] Have a drink on me.

[39:56] Thank you, brother.

[39:57] See, we're going to get the 200.

[39:58] You guys are awesome.

[39:59] We got Kelly.

[40:03] Thank you, guys.

[40:09] Yeah, the case logics, bro.

[40:11] I mean, I just remember, like, use your illusion one.

[40:13] Like, if you wanted to go from Civil War to November and you had to switch CDs.

[40:20] You're literally becoming a distributor.

[40:22] Literally.

[40:24] Now, man, I might deal on some pins, but I'll never be a distributor.

[40:27] And there's a big difference between.

[40:31] There's a big difference between.

[40:33] Being a distro and a dealer, too.

[40:40] I saw there was like a new Stern dealer.

[40:42] It's like a nice looking family guy.

[40:43] I think he's down in North Carolina.

[40:45] I saw it on Pinball Enthusiast.

[40:47] He put up a picture of his fam.

[40:50] And he's like, we're now a Stern dealer.

[40:52] I'm like, oh, is that how does that work?

[40:54] Like, you know, like, do you even need to have.

[40:59] Like a showroom.

[41:00] I don't even think so.

[41:02] Look at you guys with that.

[41:03] The drinks.

[41:04] You're going to get me drunk.

[41:04] See, the last time we did this was the night of the Machine Gun Kelly concert.

[41:07] And then Brenda got too drunk and we missed the concert.

[41:10] We went to it.

[41:11] I had to leave after two songs.

[41:15] You guys are the best man.

[41:16] See, I like, see, it feels good to give, right?

[41:19] It feels good to give the Canada, especially when you know where the money's going.

[41:26] You said you didn't want that drama, but you're going to get it if you're going to sell games.

[41:30] I don't know, man.

[41:30] I think I could sell you guys some games and not have.

[41:33] I have drama.

[41:34] Why would there be drama?

[41:37] I'm never going to be a show, man.

[41:38] You'll see the way it is.

[41:39] It's just going to be like, look, if you want it, I'll get it for you.

[41:41] But it doesn't mean I like the game.

[41:43] You know what I'm saying?

[41:45] Okay.

[41:45] Can you get a radical or party zone pin to sell me?

[41:51] I can look into it.

[41:55] So look, let's go back to American pinball.

[41:58] I.

[42:00] Here's my thing.

[42:01] I don't.

[42:03] And tell me.

[42:04] And I want to be very like, I want to be very, I want to be careful how I say this, because I'm absolutely happy.

[43:45] not gonna be it's not gonna be yeah gary vaynerchuk is the wine guy um wine library

[43:51] was what he started with i'm not going to um miss the old american pinball leadership team

[43:59] i'm not going to miss them one bit and i i hold no prior grudges like i don't think ronald and team

[44:06] need to call me up and apologize that their old regime tried to get me fired right i don't need

[44:12] you know i'm saying like that was a very personal thing that happened between somebody you know and

[44:16] me and i've forgiven him for that cost me a lot of money to settle that whole thing okay

[44:29] i won't even tell you how much money it cost me okay and it it it really rocked my family hard and

[44:36] and i i've never had anybody actually try to hurt my life the way he did and yeah really weird to do

[44:44] it too right but again like these are wounded tigers that came at me because they had products

[44:48] nobody wanted and they were afraid that i could i could destroy their company's sales if i was

[44:54] honest about their products and they're right but i'm allowed to give a negative review about a

[44:59] product um there were lawyers involved yes okay because there were threats being made to me

[45:13] the unfortunate thing is it's like it's hard for it's hard for like organizations

[45:19] they don't want to get in it they don't want to get in it and i get it i don't want to get

[45:22] them in it like i you know i made look the one mistake i made and and this is

[45:29] this

[45:29] is why i'll never do it do it again i will never make content

[45:35] from my company using company equipment or at the company because once you do that they can

[45:45] they can pull they can pull the company in and saying like oh he's making disparaging remarks

[46:13] guys are the best. I love this. Right now, they're like, oh, the haters. Damn it. Damn it. He's

[46:18] making money. And he lives in Roe, Aiden. It's not cheap. Drives a Dodge Demon and they're putting

[46:24] gas in the tank. They're putting sake inside Brenda's beautiful body. I'm happy they've taken

[46:30] over. Okay. I look forward to what they have coming out. But here's my thing. Oh, man. Brenda,

[46:36] we're getting all this money. I feel like we get to a thousand. Brenda should just come in here

[46:41] with something sexy. I'm not going to OnlyFans my wife to you guys, but maybe I should.

[46:46] Yeah. I will say, we jokingly in this household, there are times when money's stressful at times

[46:51] and we're worried about jobs at times. And I was like, when you're looking at a really attractive

[46:58] woman and she's like, I don't know how to make more money. You're like, I know something that's

[47:05] out there. I would never let my wife go on OnlyFans. But that being said,

[47:11] I actually tell Brenda, I think you can make money on OnlyFans without even taking any clothes off.

[47:16] I think you could just seductively sing happy birthday and with your Irish accent and make

[47:21] money. I think people would pay you to hear that. Saw a demon get smoked by a Tesla. Yeah,

[47:29] of course a demon will get smoked by a Tesla. The demon will not hook up on the street. A Tesla is

[47:35] all wheel drive, but I'll tell you who's having more fun. The guy in the demon getting destroyed

[47:39] by the Tesla. I'll tell you what's not fun. I'll tell you who's having more fun. I'll tell you who's

[47:41] having more fun. A Tesla. You shouldn't have settled. Let your company fire you doing the

[47:52] legal stuff. No. Okay. So here's the deal. Anthony, when you have a mortgage payment and $6,000

[48:02] daycare payment and two little kids that you want to put money away for their future and a lifestyle

[48:11] that isn't cheap, you don't want to be fired. Okay. It's like, it's like very simple. Um,

[48:20] the demon is not a manual transmission. They don't make the demon in a manual transmission.

[48:26] They make, they make the hell cat in a manual train. The demon only came in auto.

[48:31] Okay. So here's my thing. We're getting back to American pinball cause we're getting like

[48:34] sidetracked a lot, but that's because you guys are giving all this money and I love it.

[48:38] Uh, here's the thing.

[48:41] I have a new mindset where I would not have done what AP is doing. Here's what I mean by that. I

[48:49] just wouldn't have, I wouldn't be doing interviews right now. I wouldn't be talking about the old

[48:53] products. I wouldn't be doing any of that. Here's what I would have done if I were them

[48:56] and Ronald and everybody again, guys, I'm just giving you this advice because I really am

[49:01] rooting for you guys to hit it out of the park. I would have built the game first. I would have

[49:09] built whatever their new game is.

[49:11] Whatever the IP is. I would not have, I would have kept everything mysterious until I was ready

[49:19] to reveal the game. I would have done what Ford did. They built the new Ford GT in the basement

[49:26] of the Ford motor company. No one knew what was happening in the room. They were in,

[49:31] there was only like eight or 12 engineers built the entire car in secrecy.

[49:37] We know that it is easy to develop a game in secrecy. Look at Winchester,

[49:41] if I was American pinball, I never would have done what they're doing right now. I never would be

[49:47] out there talking. I wouldn't be talking about the old product. Like you're getting interviewed

[49:52] already and you haven't done anything yet. All you did was write checks so far. So if I'm them,

[50:00] stop talking, let the game do the talking because all this talking means nothing unless they execute

[50:06] at a level that's good. And this is the thing.

[50:11] I wouldn't be able to hire anyone with your note. What are you talking about? JC?

[50:17] They wouldn't be able to hire anybody. What are you talking about?

[50:21] JC a hundred percent wrong. What do you mean they can't hire you? You're telling me if Ronald and

[50:25] his multimillion dollar investor, right? Sat down with Jack danger and said, what are they paying

[50:31] you at Stern? We're going to double it. You're on your head designer. It's, but we're building

[50:39] something in secret and we need you to resign in two weeks.

[50:41] And that's it. And Jack danger goes dark. They couldn't do that.

[50:50] You don't think Jack danger would take double the pay

[50:53] because he's probably not making what he deserves and go over there.

[51:03] They need low level employees. Yeah, but you can hire people.

[51:09] You can do it.

[51:11] I think they, I think now, you know, I don't know. Like, so that like, it's nothing wrong.

[51:22] Like, I don't know what their new game is. Stern employees have a non-compete clause.

[51:26] How long does it last carry? Do we know how long the non-compete is?

[51:39] No, King. I don't like,

[51:41] they can't do that. They can't do that. They can't do that. They can't do that.

[51:41] Yeah.

[51:41] I mean, we can absolutely have the job listings public, but like, but you know what I'm saying?

[51:47] You can look, there's still mystery there. American pit models back. They're hiring people,

[51:52] but don't say anything. Don't say anything until the game is ready.

[51:58] 

[52:05] I can tell you right now with 1000% certainty that

[52:11] Yeah.

[52:11] Working at Stern is nobody's dream job.

[52:13] Killian, you want to say hi?

[52:15] Yeah?

[52:17] Can you help me find the other animals?

[52:19] Come here.

[52:21] Say hi.

[52:23] Say hi.

[52:25] Looking for the other ones of these ones?

[52:27] Ask them for help.

[52:29] Can you help me

[52:31] find the other ones of these?

[52:33] Of these? Is it downstairs?

[52:35] No. Where are they?

[52:37] They're missing.

[52:39] Can you tell everybody to give Daddy 50 bucks?

[52:41] I'll give you 50 bucks.

[52:43] Here you go.

[52:45] Okay, thank you.

[52:47] Can you help me find them?

[52:49] After my show, I'll help you look.

[52:51] But they're in my bedroom.

[52:53] They're in your bedroom? Yeah.

[52:55] They might be up on the shelf.

[52:57] Can you close the door, buddy?

[52:59] No.

[53:05] Yeah, it's almost impossible

[53:07] to enforce any non-competes.

[53:09] They're just not enforceable.

[53:11] No judge is going to be like,

[53:13] eh.

[53:17] So that was my only thing.

[53:19] My suggestion was I think AP should

[53:21] let the new game do the talking.

[53:25] The Pinside posts are still up?

[53:27] Wow. Robin's like,

[53:29] what's the tide like?

[53:31] Here, let's go read them.

[53:33] Let's do this.

[53:35] This will be fun.

[53:37] Let's share screen.

[53:39] Are they still up?

[53:41] I think they're...

[53:43] Oh, there's the Kaneda one.

[53:47] What do you think about Kaneda?

[53:49] Let's read people's responses about me.

[53:51] You guys are funny.

[53:53] It's like all you guys posting.

[53:55] I love it.

[53:57] You guys are the best.

[53:59] This is funny.

[54:01] Hold on.

[54:03] What is this?

[54:05] Okay.

[54:07] I don't know why.

[54:09] I always ask for that.

[54:11] Okay.

[54:13] All right.

[54:15] On Facebook,

[54:17] we're reading the thread.

[54:19] Pinball.

[54:21] Do you listen to the Pinball podcast?

[54:23] Are there any suggestions you have for him

[54:25] to improve his product?

[54:27] Do you generally agree or disagree?

[54:29] Should Pinside allow him back?

[54:31] What remake do you want them to do?

[54:33] None is also an answer.

[54:35] Kaz writes,

[54:37] Wow, Colin, man.

[54:39] If Colin has only succeeded

[54:41] at one thing in his pinball tenure

[54:43] and it's destroying the Twippies,

[54:45] congratulations, Colin.

[54:47] He deserves a Twippie

[54:49] for favorite clown

[54:51] to destroy his very own award show.

[54:53] Colin, great job, buddy.

[54:55] Gee,

[54:57] should Pinside allow him back?

[54:59] I think so.

[55:01] You know, I don't really care about getting back on Pinside.

[55:03] Here's some.

[55:05] He hates pins in front of windows

[55:07] why was he banned? You know, it's an interesting question. No one will ever really be honest about

[55:13] why I was banned from Pinside because the truth is I didn't do anything really wrong. I was just

[55:20] hyperactive on there. And they banned me when I showed the broken ramp on The Hobbit.

[55:27] And that's what got me banned because Robin would rather silence the truth when I exposed a design

[55:34] fault of the game, which they subsequently went and fixed and re welded that part after I showed

[55:41] the world it was breaking. But he kicked me off the site. Now, look, the reason I'm not back on

[55:48] there is I did tell Robin back in my younger drunken days to F off. And I did send the guy

[55:54] some really nasty like drunken rants, right? Because I actually think it's deplorable that

[56:00] he banned me for life from a pinball website, right?

[56:04] And still to this day, it is. But again, it's his site. It's the same thing when I block people

[56:09] like I've got certain people blocked for a long time because it's my house. It's Robin's house.

[56:15] And I respect his rules. And it is what it is. My life has not been worse because I've been off

[56:20] inside. I can still read it. Yeah, not after he threatened people on the staff. Oh, man,

[56:27] Canada is going to get there. Isn't Robin like all the way over in Europe?

[56:31] I'm going to kick your ass from Connecticut, baby.

[56:34] Now, all he does is dream about this place. Dude is jealous. Brenda, I'm jealous of Pinside.

[56:43] Not like, you know what? I'm leaving you not for another woman, Brenda. I'm leaving you for Pinside.

[56:50] I heard he threw a drink and and someone's face on someone's face. Yeah, I threw a drink at Tim

[56:55] Sexton. I mean, Timmy, Timmy knows he was a little out of hand. And so was I. It was two wrongs in

[57:02] that situation. He was not in the right.

[57:04] And I was not. I did not do the right thing.

[57:08] I love the Canada sucks. Stickers are amazing.

[57:12] Canada.

[57:16] Bring him back. He's entertaining, if nothing else. I think he's being.

[57:20] Oh, let's see. Oh, I think is being banned from. Yeah. Well, look, me being banned has actually.

[57:30] Has actually helped.

[57:34] Is there a Canadian sucks T-shirts? Let's see.

[57:39] Yeah, there's stickers.

[57:46] OK, we're back.

[57:51] Well, the banning of Canada on Pinside is what led to the podcast.

[57:58] So.

[58:00] That absolutely.

[58:02] I turned lemon.

[58:04] I'm going to put the pins in the lemonade with that whole thing.

[58:07] So, Robin, you did do me a favor.

[58:09] So thank you.

[58:10] Also, like, you know, not for nothing.

[58:13] If it wasn't for that, I mean, I don't know.

[58:15] We wouldn't have won all those twippies.

[58:18] Isn't it sad what the Twippies have become?

[58:20] Really is.

[58:22] It's like so sad because like I also think TPF has become like I just I.

[58:29] Having the Twippies at TPF was always like the Saturday night thing.

[58:33] It was so much fun.

[58:34] Like the line was around the line to get into the Twippies was the longest line at all of TPF.

[58:41] What does that tell you?

[58:42] Yeah.

[58:43] Franchi.

[58:44] No, we were just talking about how you can't wait to drop 50 bucks here.

[58:53] I think Franchi gave like $200 when we were going to the Machine Gun Kelly concert.

[58:58] And because of that, Franchi got Brenda drunk and we missed the whole show.

[59:02] Yeah.

[59:03] Now we were just talking about Franchi.

[59:06] I'm curious what your thoughts are.

[59:07] I had an idea for Jeremy Packer because I want to win him back.

[59:10] I don't want him to be mad at me.

[59:12] I don't want him to tell me I ruined his life and I'm ruining his family.

[59:15] I think he should be only on the Ellie art package of a game.

[59:20] If we look at what's happening with Harry Potter, right?

[59:23] Different art package only on the CE.

[59:25] I think that's what Jeremy should do.

[59:27] His stuff should be special and elevated as the Ellie version of the game.

[59:31] You know, you're in a bad situation.

[59:32] You know, you're in a better spot because every Beetlejuice is an Ellie.

[59:38] John, you were there, baby.

[59:40] John was at the John at Jack Bart.

[59:45] How you doing, brother?

[59:46] John, how are the little ones?

[59:50] I miss you, man.

[59:51] I need to come over there when the weather is not minus 12 degrees or whatever it is right now.

[59:55] 12 degrees.

[59:57] John.

[59:59] John is a.

[01:00:01] John is there the night the drink was thrown.

[01:00:04] The pinball drink.

[01:00:07] The pinball drink thrown around the world moment.

[01:00:12] Man, it's like John.

[01:00:14] How many years ago is that?

[01:00:17] Oh, man.

[01:00:18] Someone just said that zombie Eddie should only be on the pro.

[01:00:21] Damn.

[01:00:24] Oh, I don't think I've seen a bigger day.

[01:00:28] Damn.

[01:00:29] Oh, you're going to take that, Jeremy?

[01:00:31] Because he's going to be like it's your fan.

[01:00:33] He hates.

[01:00:35] He hates my trolls like Joe.

[01:00:37] Damn zombie Eddie only on the pro you're going to take that, Jeremy.

[01:00:44] You're going to take that from from my most er drip you're going to take that from most er drip on the Internet.

[01:00:50] All right, French.

[01:00:51] He says, first off, the recent packages he's done were going when he was given the art director role.

[01:00:56] So he is doing it.

[01:00:57] in the art director roles so he so they had to be finished i don't think you'll see much of his work

[01:01:02] going forward okay yeah i mean as art director right i mean his job now is to like pick the

[01:01:07] certain artist so i know like hasbro is gonna give transformer artists star wars gives their people

[01:01:14] um concerts are so much better when you're not wasted it's weird you actually remember yeah no

[01:01:18] so concerts are better when you just have a little bit of a buzz a little bit it's like the smart

[01:01:24] thing to drink before concerts maybe a few beers and then just go enjoy it and like maybe hold you

[01:01:29] know have a few beers there but no getting wasted before a show yes i agree is the dumbest thing

[01:01:34] ever as far as winning him back forget it he holds grudges and you will never get him back oh geez

[01:01:41] never say never what do you guys think you think jeremy packer and kaneda can't

[01:01:47] can't like can't bury the the hatchet i mean we did franchi but i if i'm reading you correctly

[01:01:55] is he holding a grudge with you too have we we he's too nice of a guy to hold grudges that's

[01:02:01] my thing too is like nice people that hold grudges all they do is they create self-inflicted wounds

[01:02:10] because it's you know what i'm saying it's like not making them any happier

[01:02:14] and they would just be happier if they would just do the nice thing which is forgive

[01:02:23] the kids are good john the

[01:02:24] kids are good we have to get them all together and together we can create a the future pinball

[01:06:10] It's like, it's the pinball content space has never been more united than it is now.

[01:06:17] Nobody's throwing shade.

[01:06:18] You see, like, how lame it gets when everyone, like, you know, I think the last time someone

[01:06:22] tried to throw some shade at Kaneda, they had to put it behind a paywall.

[01:06:26] Oh, no, man.

[01:06:27] Orbiter Albert.

[01:06:28] What happened, bro?

[01:06:30] This is going to trigger him again.

[01:06:31] If you want to, if you want to insult me, just do it.

[01:06:36] Do it where everyone can see.

[01:06:38] But like, you know what?

[01:06:39] The hate you give lives inside forever, man.

[01:06:42] I took, I doubled his subscribers.

[01:06:45] He went from like seven to 14.

[01:06:48] He's making like $37 a month now, thanks to me.

[01:06:51] And we just raised like $200 here.

[01:06:54] We raised more than he makes all year on one live.

[01:06:59] He's like, oh, he's talking.

[01:07:00] And then he's going to, you know, he's going to say,

[01:07:01] he's talking about me for two hours on his show.

[01:07:04] Dude can't do math.

[01:07:05] Like, dude, three minutes.

[01:07:06] We're done with you.

[01:07:07] Bye.

[01:07:08] New topic.

[01:07:09] All they can do is talk about me.

[01:07:11] I'll show the whole show.

[01:07:12] He talked about me.

[01:07:13] That's always what I do.

[01:07:14] Nope.

[01:07:14] Nope.

[01:07:14] Didn't listen.

[01:07:15] Didn't even listen to the takedown show.

[01:07:17] I don't care.

[01:07:20] 22 subs.

[01:07:24] I have seen some of Sonic, but not, not anything on the play field.

[01:07:31] That's all I'll say.

[01:07:33] And what I have seen is effing amazing.

[01:07:37] I'm getting one.

[01:07:41] I'm getting one.

[01:07:42] Sonic's going to make Pokemon look like a $10 game.

[01:07:48] Some people say I am arrogant.

[01:07:52] You guys are not arrogant.

[01:07:55] I'm arrogant.

[01:07:56] I'm an arrogant a hole at times.

[01:07:58] See, I know I'm not arrogant.

[01:08:00] Like, if you hang with me, I'm not an arrogant.

[01:08:01] I'm not an arrogant.

[01:08:01] I'm not an arrogant.

[01:08:01] I'm not an arrogant.

[01:08:01] I'm not an arrogant.

[01:08:01] I'm not an arrogant.

[01:08:01] I'm not an arrogant.

[01:08:02] Like, like I live in a town with some arrogant people.

[01:08:05] I mean, like really arrogant.

[01:08:07] Like the first thing they want to know, right.

[01:08:09] Okay.

[01:08:09] N in these finance towns, like new Canaan, west westport row, way 10.

[01:08:14] The first thing they ask you is what street do you live on?

[01:08:17] The only reason they're asking that is they want to know if they're talking to

[01:08:20] someone with a million and a half dollar house, a $3 million house, a $5 million

[01:08:26] house, or an $8 million house.

[01:08:28] That is the only reason they ask that.

[01:08:31] That is the only reason they ask that question.

[01:08:33] Okay.

[01:08:34] It's a, to me, it's like a, like, what, like what I've never heard people so obsessed with

[01:08:40] addresses until I moved here.

[01:08:44] Then they want to know what you do for a living, which I don't really answer.

[01:08:48] Cause it's like, it's weird.

[01:08:49] It's like, they just, they, they're so like rich people are so insecure.

[01:08:56] They're so insecure.

[01:08:58] And I'm like, I live in a, I'm like, I just live in a little three bedroom.

[01:09:01] Like it's meager.

[01:09:01] Like, I don't, you know, I don't really care.

[01:09:03] Like, what do you guys do?

[01:09:03] We guys doing the night?

[01:09:04] Like, what are you up to?

[01:09:05] Like, what do you, you know, I don't, I don't want to talk to you about, first of

[01:09:08] all, this is the reason why finance people are insecure.

[01:09:10] They, they know that nobody wants to talk to them about finance.

[01:09:14] So then the only thing, the only next thing they can talk to you about is what

[01:09:18] their money buys them trips items.

[01:09:21] Okay.

[01:09:21] And then that's not even interesting because they're not really into that stuff.

[01:09:24] They just are running away from themselves.

[01:09:28] That's that is like.

[01:09:31] My, my, my, it's a broad generalization of like the finance world, but I feel, and I

[01:09:37] also do have a little bit of like annoyance, like that you can make so much money, not

[01:09:42] really creating anything that puts value into the world.

[01:09:47] You're just making money off of other people's ideas and, and look, yeah, I'm a

[01:09:52] little jelly.

[01:09:53] Of course, I would love to get seven figure bonuses every year and fly business class

[01:09:59] around the world.

[01:10:00] Oh,

[01:10:00] it would love

[01:10:01] 

[01:10:01] I'm just not in that industry, but I will say this when you meet strangers, my dad always

[01:10:08] said this to me.

[01:10:08] When you meet strangers, never talk about money, never talk about politics.

[01:10:14] These are, you just don't talk about these things.

[01:10:18] And I, I, and, and what I've noticed with rich people is that's exactly what they start

[01:10:23] talking about.

[01:10:24] And the thing that I never understand, this is, this is like a rich person thing.

[01:10:28] They talk about personal family issues, right?

[01:10:31] Like if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're

[01:10:34] divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if

[01:10:38] you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced,

[01:10:40] if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're

[01:10:41] divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if

[01:10:44] you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced,

[01:10:48] if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're

[01:10:51] divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're divorced, if you're

[01:10:53] this. It's like, they're worried that you're eventually going to find out and indict them

[01:11:00] for the choices they made in life. And that's, what's funny to me about rich people, because like,

[01:11:05] just be cool. Just be cool. Like, I don't know why you need to tell me all this personal

[01:11:11] information. I didn't ask. I'm not your therapist. I'm just at this bar trying to get a drink and a

[01:11:16] lobster roll and maybe talk about last night's football match. And if we want to talk about

[01:11:21] something, yeah, we can pick up something happening in the world. But, you know, and then

[01:11:24] I love all these people like Trump at the bar, like, dude, you live, you made all your money,

[01:11:29] probably in finance. Like, where'd you make, tell me where a liberal made their money. And I will,

[01:11:33] I will point you to a conservative organization. You know what I'm saying? It's like these people

[01:11:40] that don't get it. Like anyone who made a lot of money in America has some conservative ties to

[01:11:45] some fiscal things happening in the world. It's just all the hypocrisy.

[01:11:51] Hypocrisy is what kills me. Yeah, no, I mean, I don't really care. All the money will never buy

[01:12:06] you another hour. You know, 10 years from now, I mean, that's when I say this 10 years from now,

[01:12:12] all of us would give up everything we have to be back here again, to get time back, to be

[01:12:21] younger, to be youthful, to have energy. It's beautiful. Yeah, I'll be like 60 in 10 years.

[01:12:29] Still, will I still be doing this? I think so. I don't know. I'm kind of aging. All right.

[01:12:34] When people meet me, they think I'm 10 years younger. And I tell them killing. I tell you,

[01:12:38] I tell them because I don't let women stress me out. It is the truth. Stress is what puts

[01:12:45] the wrinkles. Hey, buddy, you find your toys? Why are you hiding? Are you hiding from mommy?

[01:12:51] Wanna put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on put on

[01:13:21] got here. Go Rams. I'll be dead in 10 years. Seattle will destroy LA. Yeah. Seattle's going

[01:13:28] to crush them. Yeah. You know, you know, Hans, I, I, work has been really stressful. Um,

[01:13:38] and I try my best. What, what I don't like about work is the, is the billing of eight hours a day.

[01:13:47] It's, and I've been, it's been my career for 25 years. It feels like you're clocking into

[01:13:55] like prison every day. And if you don't put in eight hours, like right now I have to go put in

[01:14:01] time. Cause they, they turn off your email. They, they, they basically, they lock you out of being

[01:14:06] able to do work. Um, I didn't bet on the Indiana game. I would, I, cause I, I didn't like the

[01:14:13] spread. I would have taken the good bet in that game is when Indiana was up 10, nothing.

[01:14:17] I would have taken, um, Miami plus, like, it would have been like Miami plus like

[01:14:26] 14 and a half. That, that was the smart bet. Retro Jen go, the man loves predator,

[01:14:36] get to the chopper. So apparently retro Ralph is loving predator. Like I, um, I really, uh,

[01:14:44] you know, I, I know I've been like, so,

[01:14:47] I'm not negative on that game. It's just cause without Arnold, I just, I just don't even

[01:14:53] consider it to be predator. Like, but look, if you guys are having fun, cool. I just look at it like

[01:15:00] man, Killian, I would, I would just not want to lose all the money. You're going to come here.

[01:15:08] Come on, come on, come on. Say hi. Say hi. Okay. I'll do, I'll end the show in five minutes.

[01:15:13] Say hi to everybody. Yeah. Come here. Say hi to everybody. Hey, hey.

[01:15:17] How many, give me how many minutes. Okay. No, no. You can, you can decide four or five minutes.

[01:15:25] Get in frame, get in frame. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't turn off the,

[01:15:30] when don't touch the keyboard. No, no, no, no, no, no. Killian, Killian, stop, stop.

[01:15:37] I'll be there. Okay. Give me one minute. I'll, I'll, Oh,

[01:15:47] I'll be there. Okay. I want to get tickled.

[01:15:50] I don't want. Okay. Come here. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come here. Help me find it.

[01:16:01] Say hi, Bill Brandes. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, Bill Brandes. Yeah. Tell, okay. One thing you say,

[01:16:08] Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, come on. Come on now. All right. All right guys, I'm going to go help

[01:16:12] him find his toy. Um, this was a really fun show.

[01:16:17] Thank you so much for hanging out every Saturday. Life is really short. Um, say,

[01:16:23] say a prayer for my mama. She's doing, she's doing, I hope, I think she's doing really fine

[01:16:27] after her procedure, but I don't know. I got to go check that out. Um, life is really short and,

[01:16:33] you know, we should, we should be kind to each other. And I mean that, and these companies

[01:16:36] need to make good products. That's it. That's all it comes down to, man. Like these games are like

[01:16:41] so overpriced. We all know it. We all know it. And every once in a while, one of them is worth it.

[01:16:46] Right. Because it makes you happy.

[01:16:47] And it's so much fun. That's what, you know, Harry Potter is one of those games. Beetlejuice

[01:16:52] is going to be one of those games. Evil dead. Oh my God. Look at this little, this is my little,

[01:16:56] this is my financial advisor. Just came in.

[01:17:01] This basically looks like a mini Bill Brandis. This is like what Bill wears when he's like

[01:17:07] in Paris. Yeah. I have the photo. He's like in this very robe. He's in Paris. I people tower,

[01:17:17] like,

[01:17:17] in the background and Bill's got the robe on the cappuccino.

[01:17:25] Look at this guy, Billy. This is mini Billy B. Cassian. Cassian Brandis has a, has a ring to it.
