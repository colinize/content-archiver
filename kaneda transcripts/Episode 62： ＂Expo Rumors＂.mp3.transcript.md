[00:00] I want to know you I'm a straight fighter

[00:02] You don't wanna fuck me

[00:04] Got the bullies back in there

[00:07] But they can't do that to us

[00:10] Like they're waiting out to run ball

[00:14] And they're gonna run ball

[00:17] And they're gonna run ball

[00:20] Just two days to go before we finally get

[00:25] Pinball Expo 2016

[00:28] I'm super excited this is Canada

[00:30] It is Tuesday morning

[00:32] We are coming at you from New York City

[00:34] And you know I wasn't planning on doing some additional podcast

[00:38] After my pinball expo prediction podcast

[00:42] But there's just a few things I want to talk about some things that are developing

[00:46] But first, you know what are the reasons I'm doing this?

[00:48] Because I had a laugh because I saw there's a pin-side thread that sort of aggregates

[00:53] All of the pinball podcasts that are out there

[00:57] And there's one podcast missing

[00:59] And that is Canadian pinball podcast

[01:01] Is not allowed by the pin-side moderation team to be listed

[01:05] Like I can't even be mentioned

[01:07] But I want to give a huge huge huge shout out to two people

[01:11] First is Solar Value

[01:13] Who actually started the thread

[01:15] And he wrote this amazing thing

[01:17] He's like look

[01:19] I know he's not very popular

[01:21] But I want to give Canadian credit for a really good episode

[01:23] 61 where he gives a preview of expo

[01:25] And he said look, you know there's not a lot of people doing daily podcasts anymore

[01:29] And if you want your sort of weekly podcast fix

[01:33] There's really not many other places to go

[01:37] In fact, you know I want to just sort of

[01:39] Let's look at the last time our friends have podcast

[01:43] The last Nate podcast for coast to coast

[01:45] With September 19th

[01:47] And I'm going to say

[01:49] Nate podcast for coast to coast

[01:51] With September 19th

[01:53] And we know Nate's traveling

[01:55] I love Nate, I love his show

[01:57] But a month in between podcasts

[01:59] Is really really really really

[02:01] Fush shredding for people who love that show

[02:03] Let's see the pinball podcast

[02:07] The last one they did was

[02:09] Monday, yes finally a new one

[02:11] It was yesterday

[02:13] Episode 91, the one before that was September 26th

[02:15] So these guys do want about every two to three weeks

[02:17] So I can't wait to check that out

[02:19] I just saw it today

[02:21] It wasn't up there last night when I looked

[02:23] Spooky's pinball podcast

[02:25] The last one they did was September 27th

[02:27] The pinhead's podcast with the Z

[02:29] I love these guys

[02:31] But man, the last one they did was August 5th

[02:35] By the time they cover stuff

[02:37] It's been covered a million times

[02:39] Brody even talked pinball

[02:41] They have a new one up also Monday

[02:43] Wow, I'm really picky like the worst day to do

[02:45] I'm gonna show you how long it takes

[02:47] But I love these guys, the Slamtill podcast

[02:49] They had one up last Thursday

[02:51] And they do about one or two weeks

[02:53] So I just want to say look

[02:55] If you want pinball podcasts news

[02:57] And you want to hear people talk about

[02:59] Pinball and discuss it

[03:01] I think you'll enjoy the show

[03:03] And I think we do something

[03:05] And we do it a lot and we do it frequently

[03:07] And it takes a lot of my time

[03:09] But I think it's just kind of funny that I'm censored and still

[03:11] Cannot be discussed on pinside

[03:13] Alright, which leads me to my second point about pinball podcast

[03:15] And then I'm gonna go more into some of recent

[03:17] Expo stuff that I want to talk about

[03:19] There's a new pinball podcast out there

[03:21] The Cornball Pincast

[03:23] And this is Cornelius's podcast

[03:25] And I listen to his first three episodes

[03:29] And in his first episode

[03:31] He calls me all sorts of names

[03:33] And makes fun of me

[03:35] And calls me a wanko

[03:37] And I just love it

[03:39] Because when I listen to his podcast

[03:41] It's so funny how much of an influence

[03:45] Canadian pinball podcast has had on him

[03:49] And I think the genre that we created on this podcast

[03:53] Is very simple. It was a very bold and

[03:57] Candid and truthful and honest assessment of the pinball hobby

[04:01] We used pinside as a source for most of our material on this podcast

[04:05] Which is what we do

[04:07] And sometimes we take it too far

[04:11] Sometimes we provide incredible value on this podcast

[04:15] So I just have some advice for Cornelius

[04:17] Because I was listening to his first three episodes

[04:19] And first thing is before you call me out

[04:21] And call me all sorts of names

[04:23] Check your listening, your listener bassman

[04:27] You went from 347 listens

[04:29] Then your next one got 89 listens

[04:33] And your current one has 32

[04:35] So you're headed south

[04:37] And I'm going to give you some advice on how to create a pinball podcast

[04:41] That has a decent consistent following

[04:43] And on this podcast we get anywhere between

[04:45] 400 to 800 listens per episode

[04:49] But again you have to look at the amount of episodes

[04:51] So I have a decent amount of consistent listeners

[04:55] And that's fine with me

[04:57] I never expected this to grow into the thousands

[04:59] Because there just aren't thousands of people out there

[05:03] That want to listen and talk about pinball on a weekly basis

[05:07] But my advice to Cornelius is simple

[05:09] And it's to be a little bit more positive

[05:13] You can't come out and just position yourself as

[05:17] I'm going to be negative, I'm going to be the guy who curses

[05:19] I'm going to be the guy who tells everyone to fuck off

[05:21] I'm going to call people out by name and tell them to fuck off on every podcast

[05:25] We tried that at times on this podcast

[05:27] And I was almost laughing because I saw him going after

[05:31] Ork a bunch of times

[05:33] And I mean man we've crossed that bridge a million times on this podcast

[05:35] And him and I sort of squashed the beef

[05:39] But it's just no one wants to listen to a podcast

[05:41] Where you just start calling out people arbitrarily

[05:43] And telling them to go fuck off

[05:45] And calling them all sorts of names

[05:47] It's really not the way to do it

[05:49] There are going to be times when people deserve to be called out

[05:51] And there's going to be times when we do a

[05:53] Pinside babies episode where we really dive deep into

[05:57] Maybe a user or two and how ridiculous they're acting

[05:59] But then we move on and we're not going to make this like

[06:01] Oh this is the R-rated podcast

[06:03] Where we're just going to be negative all the time

[06:05] And so like I appreciate every new podcast that comes out

[06:09] That talks about pinball in a more candid way

[06:13] But I also think that we've got Canadian pinball podcasts

[06:17] And if you want to call me out and you want to make fun of me

[06:19] Like you've done all the time on the forums and on Pinside

[06:21] Then make a better product

[06:23] Or if you want your product and your podcast

[06:25] It's better than Canada's

[06:27] It takes more than just a few sound clips here and there

[06:29] It takes more than just being a half hour long

[06:31] It takes more than all that

[06:33] I'll tell you it takes one thing to be as good as

[06:35] Canada's pinball podcast

[06:37] And that's Canada

[06:39] And you sir are not Canadian yet

[06:41] But I encourage you

[06:43] Because I want to give the cornball pin cast a listen

[06:45] Give it a listen

[06:47] Also learn how to use soundclad

[06:49] Make your podcast downloadable

[06:51] They're not right now

[06:53] And also makes more sense to put the word pinball in there

[06:55] And also set it up with an RSS feed so that you get onto iTunes

[06:59] Because that's where people look for a lot of episodes

[07:01] Alright, so let's talk quickly about some recent developments around Expo

[07:05] And what I'm hearing

[07:07] And I'm going to start

[07:09] This is no in particular order

[07:11] We talk last time about Batman's Super Ellie

[07:13] There's still a lot of debate around that

[07:15] I have to say right now

[07:17] I'm currently I forgot to get my refund

[07:19] I don't even know if it's still refundable

[07:21] I had a couple deposits down for Batman Ellie

[07:25] If the rumors are true now that the Super Ellie is going to be at 80

[07:29] But the price is going to be cheaper

[07:31] It's going to be somewhere around $12,900

[07:35] They load it by 2 grand

[07:37] Look the closer the Super Ellie price gets to the Ellie

[07:41] The less and less people are going to want the Ellie's

[07:43] And if you're going to spend 10 grand you can spend 12 grand

[07:45] Alright, let's just can we agree on that

[07:47] If you're going to spend $10,000 on a pinball machine

[07:51] You can spend 12 or 13

[07:53] It's in the same level of ridiculousness

[07:55] Right?

[07:57] I don't know, I just feel I still feel bummed out about the whole thing

[08:01] I don't think Stern really understands what they're doing here

[08:03] They're constantly adjusting this in real time

[08:05] They never should have announced anything until they had their plans solidified

[08:09] And the more I think about the more I don't give a shit

[08:13] I really don't, I don't really care

[08:15] If there's 80 people out there that want to spend $15,000 on a Batman Super Ellie

[08:19] So be it

[08:21] If there's 240 people out there that are on the Ellie list that are now feeling bad

[08:25] And slight it, get over it, get over it

[08:27] If the game is great, if the game is fun

[08:29] I think this whole move, this new pricing structure by Stern

[08:33] The whole thing was designed to eliminate flipping

[08:35] And when you eliminate flipping you eliminate all those people that just want to buy new unbox

[08:41] And feel like their game is going to go up and value immediately and sell it

[08:43] Like I sold my Ghostbusters Ellie for $1500 more than I bought it for without even having it delivered to me

[08:49] It went right to the new buyer

[08:51] That error is over

[08:53] If Ghostbusters Ellie was 10 grand, there's no money for me to flip it no matter how great the pin is no matter how awesome it is

[08:59] So that being said, we all knew this going into Batman Ellie

[09:03] Or we know it now, right?

[09:05] We know by the time the deposits were refundable

[09:09] We all knew the game

[09:11] We know the game were in now

[09:13] So I think there just comes a point where all of us are grown adults

[09:17] And if we're entered into this agreement with Stern, we need to just stop bitching about it

[09:21] And for all those on the outside looking in, they're not going to stop bitching

[09:25] This is the type of stuff that draws people absolutely bonkers

[09:27] So we'll see what Stern says is the ultimate number of them and the ultimate price in a few days at Friday night at their big party

[09:35] But the drinks still better be free

[09:37] I'm not giving up on that if they charge me drinks at this freaking birthday bash I swear to God

[09:41] I swear to God

[09:43] You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make a promise

[09:45] If they charge for drinks, I'm going to start a canada tab

[09:49] And I'm going to let some of you guys throw your shit down on my tab

[09:51] No, you guys are going to go at the bar now

[09:53] Just say it's under canada fuck I shouldn't have said that

[09:55] Alright, so what else am I hearing rumor-wise?

[09:59] I'm hearing that Jersey Jack

[10:01] Well by the way, happy birthday Jack

[10:03] It was your birthday yesterday, I want to say happy belated

[10:05] I'm hearing a rumor that Jersey Jack is going to have another version of the habit that he is going to show alongside Pat Lawler's game

[10:15] I hear the habit selling pretty well

[10:17] I heard when I say pretty well, I heard that he sold out of the Smalg editions and the Ellie editions

[10:23] But that's what I'm hearing

[10:25] You know, I don't- again, we never get numbers in this industry, I'm not going to say, well that's a fact

[10:29] Because it makes more sense for Jack if Smalg sales or limited edition sales are slowing down significantly

[10:37] I wouldn't put it past Jack, the proverbial salesman, to say they sold out

[10:41] So now we need a new version

[10:43] No one really knows, right?

[10:45] No one has 1500 attracting on 1500 machines and where they all are

[10:51] So I heard he's coming out with a new edition that is just going to be a new trim

[10:55] It's going to be a new trim and it's going to be called something little special

[10:59] I said to the person who told me I wouldn't reveal all the details of it and I'm not

[11:03] But let's look to see if Hobbit has a new trim available at Expo

[11:07] Alright, what else am I hearing that's recent?

[11:11] So American Pimbaugh, American Pimbaugh had a little chat with them over there

[11:15] And I don't want to reveal everything we talked about

[11:19] I do want to say this

[11:21] I want to manage expectations a little bit going into Expo, I think it's something they should be doing

[11:26] Because things have been put out there and what has been put out there

[11:29] We heard that they were bringing Chris from Coin Takeer's Magic Girl to the show for him to bring home

[11:33] That was a post that they had put on Facebook

[11:37] Now as we all know, a lot of times people's words get way ahead of their actions in this hobby

[11:42] And if you say something, people expect you to deliver on what you say

[11:46] And as we also know, the last 5 to 10% of the Pimbaugh machines manufacturing is often 90% of the work

[11:55] So it appears that these guys are doing this smart thing now and not making these bold promises still

[12:03] And they're sort of stepping back and using Expo as a chance to meet with people and talk with people and discuss what their plans are

[12:10] I would not expect to see flipping Pimbaugh machines from American Pimbaugh

[12:14] So I want to set those expectations that if they don't bring stuff

[12:18] And I was very critical of that this company

[12:20] If you don't show up with things, your actions need to speak louder than your words

[12:24] There's no point in hearing more words

[12:26] I was very critical of no machines showed up

[12:28] And it seems like no machines that are playable will be showing up at Expo

[12:34] Now I think I am willing to give these guys a pass and hear what they say

[12:39] And they know where they're at

[12:41] I think we've discussed American Pimbaugh 10 different ways

[12:44] I think the thread has gone off in 10 different directions

[12:47] Everyone feels the same way about this

[12:49] They want to see these guys do the right thing of the magic girl buyers

[12:52] They're interested to see where things go with Houdini

[12:55] But they really, really, really want to see this company correct the wrongs who's it where

[13:00] And look, if they don't do what they're doing, there is no hope for anyone who's it where

[13:06] I think the attitude towards American Pimbaugh has subsided a little bit because this is the best chance you got

[13:11] For those people who were going in and attacking this company and say they shouldn't even be allowed to exist

[13:17] That it's a disgrace

[13:19] That's not really a great approach to have

[13:21] Because then you're just removing any hope that the people have of getting their magic girls

[13:25] So I think Expo is going to be more of a time to hear from these guys

[13:28] I want to set those expectations

[13:30] Meet with them, ask your questions, ask your tough questions

[13:33] But you're not going to see the flipping machines

[13:36] And I don't really think people are going to care too much

[13:38] I got to be honest, there's so much exciting stuff happening

[13:41] There's so many new machines people are going to be able to play

[13:43] That by the time these guys talk Friday morning

[13:46] I think the excitement around Lawler's machine and having seen Alien

[13:51] And knowing that Batman's coming that night

[13:54] I don't think people are going to really be that upset

[13:57] Again, because no one really has money in on any of the new stuff

[14:01] And the people who are burned on the old stuff

[14:03] Those wounds have been around for so many years

[14:05] That if you can wait years and thought there was no hope

[14:09] Then you'll wait a few more months to see if they actually get those magic girls out to people before the year is over

[14:14] And that is on them

[14:16] And I hope they do it

[14:17] And Scott and team, you guys have our support here

[14:19] I mean, we're not going to throw stones until the year is up

[14:22] And we're giving you guys a chance to get those magic girls out the door

[14:25] And that was what you promised

[14:27] Okay, so what else is going on?

[14:29] Alien reveal party at Twin Peaks is officially booked

[14:34] There is no more room if you pre-order the game

[14:36] It does not mean you get into the party

[14:39] I saw someone suggested that anyone who pre-order the game should be allowed to see the game first

[14:44] And early and before the mob comes in

[14:46] I agree with that, I think it's a good suggestion

[14:48] I think it's something they could easily do and they probably will do

[14:51] That being said, if you didn't get an RSUP to the party

[14:55] They just show up at Twin Peaks

[14:57] I don't know if you guys were there last year

[14:59] It's a shit show

[15:00] There's people everywhere

[15:01] There's no real checkiness if you can get in or not

[15:04] It's connected to the restaurant

[15:06] You can just say you're going in the barn and hook a left and be into the alien reveal party

[15:10] For those who were there last year, it is super fucking crowded

[15:14] Do not expect to have an intimate immersive experience with the game

[15:18] It is more about seeing people drinking beers and having the game there in the background

[15:21] The line to play the full throttles was always really long

[15:24] You're not going to get a lot of intimate ball time

[15:27] If you go to it, just managing those expectations

[15:30] Alien, what do I think after having a few more days to think about it?

[15:34] My opinions haven't changed too much

[15:37] I want to flip it, I want to flip it

[15:39] I think that it's going to come down

[15:42] I think that the game to me is not the most beautiful, I've said it

[15:47] I think it looks like this

[15:50] I look at Alien as a theme and I say

[15:53] Looking at pinball machines like Ghostbusters

[15:55] I'm looking at my tails of the Arabian Knights

[15:57] I'm looking at machines where the theme has completely covered and blanket it

[16:02] The pinball cabinet with the artwork with the play field with the toys with the mechs

[16:07] I think this game looks halfway there and I have to say

[16:10] It would have looked so much better with hand drawn cabinet art from the Alien Universe

[16:15] Like Geiger style art

[16:19] Instead of having the play field look a lot more generic Alien clip art

[16:24] I don't know who to believe

[16:28] Orc says they wouldn't let him draw it

[16:30] I heard from Zambi Yeti that every studio has that policy

[16:34] But if you bring them hand drawn artwork

[16:36] They'll work with you on it

[16:38] And that's what happened with Ghostbusters

[16:40] They wanted Stern to use clip art and they showed them what was possible

[16:45] So I don't really believe when Orc says that wasn't a possibility

[16:50] Because here's the thing

[16:51] If they would have allowed hand drawn artwork to happen on Alien

[16:54] The question I always have is

[16:56] Who would have drawn it?

[16:57] Because Orc is not really like a...

[17:00] He's not an artist where Zambi Yeti is where he's a draw

[17:03] Or he's more of a creative director

[17:05] So fine, this is what it is

[17:07] I think this game as a lot of people are saying

[17:10] It's all going to come down to how well does it make you feel

[17:14] And I think the comparison that is really accurate is Tron

[17:17] When Tron first came out it looked like a bit of a dog

[17:20] It had shitty kind of art

[17:22] People didn't really love it

[17:24] It wasn't that popular

[17:26] But then once people heard the music they got into the gameplay

[17:29] And it really put them into that Tron world with the Daff Punk music

[17:33] And all the cool lighting effects

[17:35] Tron became a hit

[17:37] So I think that's the same path that Alien is hoping to take

[17:41] That visually it's not going to blow your socks off

[17:44] But once you get into it you're going to really understand what they were going for

[17:47] And that's all I'll say

[17:49] The other thing that's just interesting that I want to just discuss

[17:52] And we haven't discussed it before

[17:53] But the real question I have is

[17:55] Is when is this game going to ship

[17:57] And no one's really asking

[17:58] It's amazing to me how when you show a flyer

[18:01] Just a flyer and a single prototype of a pinball machine

[18:05] People are like take my money, take my money, take my money

[18:08] I don't think there is anything to indicate that this game is near production

[18:13] In the sense of like mass production

[18:15] Right?

[18:16] The prototype isn't even finished

[18:18] So every time I hear Orrick say or Andrew say

[18:21] Oh we're not sure about the final trim

[18:23] Alright, that's going to equal delay

[18:25] We're not sure about all the final plastics and the final LED artwork

[18:29] Okay, that's going to equal another delay

[18:32] Everything that they're not sure about, everything they're adjusting equals delay

[18:37] And I keep trying to remember when Jack was delayed on Hobbit

[18:43] And had some money issues and was trying to figure out how to get everything into production

[18:48] Remember Jack, you're stockpiling parts for weeks and months before you can get the machine on the production line

[18:55] Do we feel like Alien and Highway has been stockpiling parts to get this game ready

[19:01] To get on the line and get the consumers by November?

[19:04] No, they haven't even finished the final prototype

[19:07] So I really hope that Andrew and Orrick and Highway and team come clean

[19:12] And put a realistic date in people's head about when they can expect it

[19:18] I said before, I think they said November October

[19:22] Because they want people to give their money and hey, because they sent around an email saying

[19:26] Hey, we're ready for production in two to three weeks

[19:29] Andrew sent that email about a month ago

[19:31] We're ready for production in two to three weeks

[19:33] And I now need 50% more of the payment for your game

[19:38] And I'm sorry but like what happens if he misses that date and people paid money?

[19:43] See now you've locked your money into Highway

[19:46] And you're not going to get a refund because you've passed that refundable period

[19:50] But he's missed his date on when he can produce it

[19:54] And I think everybody, if you love Alien, if you hate Alien, if you're on the fence around Alien

[19:59] Just wait to send your money in until production actually starts

[20:04] Because as he says in the email, he needs more money for production

[20:08] Right on the eve of production

[20:11] But I don't think we're on the eve of production just based upon what we're hearing

[20:14] And I think it's a question people should ask

[20:16] And getting to a prototype means nothing, that's the other thing

[20:19] It's amazing how forgettable we all are

[20:22] We all argue about the artwork and the toys of Alien

[20:25] But are we forgetting that just making a single prototype and a flyer

[20:30] Does not mean anything in terms of when you're going to get your pinball machine

[20:35] We saw Kevin roll around with a prototype of Predator forever

[20:39] We saw the magic girl prototype

[20:42] We saw the big Lebowski prototype and Games did in ship for two years later

[20:46] We saw Hobbit prototype and Games did in ship two years later

[20:50] It wasn't even really a Hobbit prototype

[20:52] People forget when Jack showed that first Hobbit

[20:54] That was like this is the game it's ready to go

[20:56] And everyone had an uproar about the artwork

[20:59] So I just think people need to manage their expectations

[21:03] And that is a reveal does not equal like a release

[21:07] And those two words mean significantly different things

[21:12] So I do want you guys who are in an Alien

[21:15] I want you to also think consciously about your money

[21:18] And be protective over your money

[21:20] The last thing I want to see is people lock their money into Alien

[21:24] And then be frustrated for six months

[21:26] I don't think you should do it

[21:28] I think you should wait until production is really beginning

[21:31] Alright what else am I hearing is a rumor

[21:34] So I am hearing that Ghostbusters fans out there

[21:38] Are going to get some good news about some of the changes to the game

[21:43] That are happening

[21:44] There's rumors that the proton beans are becoming a reality

[21:48] Which if I'm stern

[21:50] They're going to charge like a thousand dollars for each beam

[21:53] And you guys will probably have to buy it

[21:55] Also hearing that there's going to be some code update

[22:00] That is going to be exciting

[22:02] Let's just say I don't want to go into details because I gave my word

[22:05] But let's just say it's going to make a game that's really brutal

[22:08] It's going to allow you guys to see much more of the game

[22:11] And that's just I think we all felt that that was a long time coming

[22:15] I got to give props to Rare Hero for never stopping the fight to get that a reality

[22:21] So that's going to be exciting

[22:23] I think that's going to make Ghostbusters even more appealing

[22:25] Does it make me wish I kept mine?

[22:27] I got to say a little bit

[22:30] But I still think the game's way too brutal

[22:32] The flipper gap and the outline jump in

[22:36] And just the extreme difficulty of the game

[22:39] It doesn't matter if I could pick the modes or not

[22:41] The balls always going down the middle

[22:43] What else am I hearing about expo and expo rumours?

[22:48] Spooky

[22:49] So you know, I have to say

[22:52] I haven't really kept you guys

[22:53] I don't even know if I've made this public

[22:54] So I had a pre-order down on a Rob Zombie spooky machine

[22:58] And I recently got out

[23:01] And they're really good and they're getting a check back

[23:04] And I have to say

[23:07] I think this show is going to be really, really interesting for spooky

[23:10] Because you know, I think they're going to kind of be in a place

[23:15] Where they're going to see what everyone else is offering

[23:17] And they're going to have to up the game

[23:19] And we've said this before

[23:20] But I think the spooky is going to lose a little bit of its lust

[23:24] Or if it doesn't up its game

[23:25] Because you know, here's the thing about spooky

[23:27] And I'm going to say this

[23:28] And I think that they know this

[23:30] But they make a very basic and simple machine

[23:33] And a lot of people applaud them

[23:35] Because look, they got people machines

[23:37] They were the only one shipping people machines

[23:39] When other companies were taking people's money

[23:41] And making them wait ears

[23:43] Or worse, not even delivering on their games

[23:45] Right? So spooky came out

[23:46] And they put a machine in box and they got it to people

[23:49] And just because of that

[23:50] They were heralded as being

[23:53] You know, good guys

[23:54] And they deserved that

[23:55] And they got a lot of good will with the community

[23:57] But now it's at the point where

[23:59] Okay, okay, we get it

[24:02] But people are starting to really look at the merits of the games

[24:05] And the games have to be really good

[24:06] I'm sorry, but there's no room for simplicity

[24:10] And boutique

[24:12] If the games aren't as enjoyable and as fun as what is out there

[24:15] And the bar just keeps getting raised and raised and raised

[24:18] So, look, I think spooky is at a crossroad

[24:21] I said this

[24:22] There's a new machine that's going to have 500 units

[24:24] And not be limited edition

[24:26] It has to be a killer theme but it also had to take up

[24:29] They have to take their games up a notch

[24:30] Spooky games have to equal at least a Stern Pro

[24:33] In terms of quality, in terms of mechanisms

[24:36] In terms of gameplay

[24:38] And if they can get there

[24:39] I think they'll be in a good place at the price point they're at

[24:41] But until that happens

[24:43] You know, I think when we're looking at Rob Zombies

[24:45] I think people are seeing these games are not really going that much

[24:48] Up in value

[24:49] And even though there's only 300 of them

[24:51] The Rob Zombie machines are sort of sticking around that $7000 price range

[24:56] Which is, you know, a little bit more than people paid

[24:58] But not a lot

[25:00] And not a lot, especially if you're paying for shipping and stuff

[25:02] You're not really getting a bargain here

[25:05] So, I haven't got my pin-side badge head

[25:09] I haven't got confirmation that they're going to make me one

[25:11] And I'm getting kind of nervous

[25:12] Guys, don't you want Canada at the pinball meeting greeted Expo?

[25:15] What is?

[25:17] No, I actually know

[25:18] Last point I want to say, and again, we're two days away

[25:21] And I really look forward to being at the show

[25:23] Again, I fly in Friday morning

[25:25] Brennan myself are going to be there Friday, all day Friday, all day Saturday

[25:29] And I really just look forward to hanging out with everybody

[25:31] And I have to say this

[25:33] And it goes without saying that

[25:35] The shows are awesome because of the people

[25:37] The meeting greets, the beers

[25:40] I mean, we're talking about pinball

[25:42] And I know for all you guys out there

[25:43] 99% of our friends, family, and loved ones don't give a shit

[25:47] And won't let us talk about pinball

[25:49] In fact, Brenda Olyse looks at me and is like, stop talking about pinball

[25:52] Stop discussing it

[25:54] I don't want to talk about it

[25:55] And I talk about it, I heard so much

[25:57] And it's so weird to be in a place with hundreds of other people

[26:02] That you can geek out with about the stuff that we really are passionate about

[26:06] And I look forward to it

[26:08] And I've had some emails from some of you guys that you're going to be at the show

[26:11] And again, if you want to hang out with me

[26:14] I wasn't going to do this because I hate self-promoting

[26:18] Not really, but I'll just say I do

[26:20] I got a couple of two shirts made up that are going to say

[26:23] Canada on it or have Canada's face

[26:25] And just to make it easier for you guys who don't know what I look like

[26:28] And if you see me out of the show

[26:29] You'll look just look for the one woman at X-Bow

[26:32] And that'll be Brenda

[26:33] And I'll be the guy next to her

[26:35] But I'd love for you to say hi to you guys

[26:37] I'd love to have a beer with you guys

[26:38] I'd love to chat and hang out

[26:40] I'm going to be at the Stern party Friday night

[26:43] I'm going to be there all day Saturday

[26:45] And just hang around the show

[26:47] I'm sure I'll run into all you guys

[26:49] But send me an email again at canadapimbal

[26:54] at gmail.com if you're going to be at the show and you want to hang

[26:57] And it's going to be a great time

[26:59] And I think this is such an exciting time

[27:02] Because in a few days

[27:03] We're going to have so much more exciting stuff to discuss

[27:06] And whenever there's news, it does one thing

[27:08] It really does get people off of like

[27:11] Just being ultra negative and ultra speculative

[27:14] And we start to be able to discuss what's real

[27:17] But I implore everybody that as you see news stuff

[27:20] And we're in this new error

[27:22] Don't just throw your money at anything

[27:24] Wait until games are on the production line

[27:27] Wait until people play them

[27:29] And wait until you know it's a real thing

[27:32] Before you just throw money at people

[27:34] I just really don't want to see people in 2016 into 2017

[27:38] Getting burned again by anyone

[27:41] I don't want to see any long waits

[27:43] So this is a little impromptu episode

[27:46] No other real rumors other than someone

[27:49] People are finally getting their captain Nemo's after four years

[27:52] I don't even think the game is real

[27:55] I love what I went into the thread because you see

[27:57] The thread is so old that there's actually posts from canada

[28:00] That are one of the last few posts that were made

[28:04] And I used to just ask like any updates

[28:06] And there never were any

[28:08] So Captain Nemo, all three guys in the world who have one

[28:11] Enjoy it

[28:13] Happy, happy, happy week guys

[28:16] And safe travels to expel

[28:18] Let's make sure everyone gets there safely

[28:20] And we will see everyone shortly this week

[28:23] Have a great day
