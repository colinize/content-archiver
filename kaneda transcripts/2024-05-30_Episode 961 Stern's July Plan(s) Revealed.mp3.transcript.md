[00:00] Ah, the plot is thickening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, week three

[00:25] of me sleeping on a pullout couch and I've got some breaking news for you. And here's

[00:31] what's weird about this news. We kind of heard this news and then we got new news in which

[00:36] we thought was going to happen and that was Godzilla 70th anniversary which is in 2024.

[00:41] But I'm also here to tell you right now, I am hearing as of today from somebody who knows

[00:47] exactly what's going to happen at Stern Pinball, I'm hearing that in July, Stern Pinball is

[00:54] going to release a special 40th anniversary edition of a band that is celebrating the 40th

[01:03] anniversary of an album called Ride the Lightning that came out July 27th in 1984. This is 100%

[01:16] what I'm hearing is coming out in July. Now wait a minute, what about Godzilla 2024 is

[01:24] also the 70th anniversary of Godzilla. Here's what's crazy to me is I didn't hear from my

[01:31] source that Godzilla is not coming out as well sometime this year. Now wait a minute,

[01:37] what if Stern Pinball does something nuts? What if they release two anniversary edition

[01:44] games at the same time? I'm not saying it's going to happen but what would prevent them from releasing

[01:51] in July, Metallica 40th of Ride the Lightning and Godzilla 70th, two of their greatest games of

[02:00] all time. These two games will always have a ton of demand because of how great they are. And

[02:05] remember too, these are not LEs, so these are premiums. So why not just throw them both out

[02:12] into the world and just let people order them whenever they want. And I think Stern is going to

[02:18] charge $13,000 for these games. It's really interesting and what I think they're going to do now

[02:24] if they make a rerun or anniversary edition of a game and don't limit it, they can very simply

[02:32] just make it very sought after if they just charge us $13,000 for one. Because the other way to make

[02:39] something limited is to just raise the price. I mean think about it, they could say, hey look,

[02:43] we're not going to number these but each one of these is $20,000. Well that's a surefire way to

[02:50] make sure you're not going to be selling more than a thousand of them and it would become the

[02:54] new special version of the game. So now we have it people. In July there's going to be a Metallica

[03:03] Ride the Lightning version of the game. Now something that most of you don't know is this.

[03:08] Dirty Donnie back in the day when he did the art packages for these games back in the day,

[03:14] he also did an art package celebrating Ride the Lightning and Stern Pimbal never used it. So maybe

[03:23] just maybe as they go back to the vault, they're also going to go back to the vault of the art

[03:29] packages Dirty Donnie worked on and I can't tell if like Dirty Donnie and Metallica had a falling

[03:35] out or Dirty Donnie and Stern had a falling out and if Zombie Eddie does this art package,

[03:41] I think people would love it. Also you know a band like Metallica works with a lot of very

[03:46] talented artists out there. So if they want to make this a whole new looking game but with the

[03:51] same design layout of John Borg's like classic hit, it's still going to work. I don't think it's

[03:57] going to be an all new game. It is definitely going to be based on the original game everybody

[04:02] loves. They're going to put it on the LCD screen. It's the first time we're ever going to see Stern

[04:07] do this, right? Go back to a DMD error game and make it new again on the LCD platform now. Does

[04:15] that mean Spike 3 is coming out in July? Because that was the other rumor that this would be the

[04:20] beginning of Spike 3. So many rumors and so many of them coming from Canada. Now I think we're going

[04:26] to get both. Now if you look at Godzilla, the actual date in which Godzilla the first movie came

[04:33] out was in October. I believe it was 1954. Maybe Stern is going to organize it like that. So in July,

[04:42] which is when Metallica's Ride the Lightning album is celebrating its anniversary. That's when

[04:48] Metallica drops and maybe they moved Godzilla to October starting to make a little bit of sense

[04:55] here because think about it. John Wick is an abysmal failure for Stern. The sales are terrible.

[05:00] Nothing is going to turn it around and they got to keep that line going. So you hit with the Metallica

[05:06] sometime in July. That's not a cornerstone game. That's a premium anniversary edition and then

[05:13] maybe they hit with a new cornerstone game sometime in September and then they do the Vault of

[05:18] Godzilla in October and then maybe another cornerstone game by the end of the year. I don't

[05:25] know. It's starting to get crazy when you think about how big Stern's facility is and how they need

[05:31] to keep their production going. But I think we're going to see both a Godzilla black and white this

[05:36] year and I think we're going to definitely see this Metallica now. So for you Metallica fans out

[05:41] there and there's many of you and I know some of you have been asking me should I sell my old

[05:45] Ellie. Here's what I would do. I mean obviously wait and see because nothing. This is the great

[05:51] part about Stern pinball being forced to make these anniversary editions as premiums. You know

[05:57] what that means. It means you don't have to buy it right away. It means there's never going to be

[06:03] FOMO because they're never going to limit them. If it's a premium and a true premium they will

[06:09] make these for a very long time and that's what Stern doesn't realize. They really really messed

[06:15] up. They really messed up. They really should have got their strategy right when they started making

[06:20] all these special editions of Elvira and Jurassic Park. They should have figured out a way to make

[06:26] anniversary editions work alongside the other limited edition versions of the game and they

[06:32] didn't do it right. And so now they've got to do this weird thing. So I think all eyes are going

[06:37] to be on this game. How much it cost. How much effort did Stern put into the code now that it's

[06:43] on an LCD screen. Are we going to get new animations. What's the sound system going to be like if

[06:49] it's spike three. What are the new innovations in this game. And it's not just like Internet

[06:54] connectivity. Stern pinball really needs to make these machines look better. There's no way around

[06:59] it. Put an Elton John next to any Stern machine. If they're going to go down this route and they're

[07:05] going to want to charge us this much money for these pinball machines they need to start making

[07:10] their machines look like they come from the last five to 10 years and they don't and they need to

[07:16] step into the 21st century of pinball and Jersey Jack pinball has raised the bar on how nice a

[07:23] pinball platform can look and Stern pinball machines look so dated next to them. And that's the final

[07:29] frontier for Stern pinball. It's funny right. It's always like if we could just combine these two

[07:34] companies if we could get a machine that shot as good as a Stern pinball machine but looked as good

[07:40] as a Jersey Jack machine we could maybe start to justify the prices. Oh wait a minute. That game

[07:46] just came out and it's called Elton John. And even as great as Elton John is though it is still

[07:52] overpriced. I'm starting to see all these dealers now are having Elton John collectors editions

[07:58] new inbox ready to be picked up. So for all those owners out there that have been saying you better

[08:04] get one now because they're going to sell out. They're never going to sell out of 1000 Elton John

[08:11] CEs at $15,000 a pop. Do you think Stern's really going to make 1000 John Wick L.E.s. like who's buying

[08:21] all these things. And now I hear that because there's a parts delay they're not going to have all

[08:26] the L.E.s built at once. Sure. You know if the parts delay is called the part that's delayed is

[08:33] called demand. And the other part that's delayed are consumers because there are not enough consumers

[08:39] with enough demand to justify Stern pinball making 1000 John Wick L.E.s at $13,000 a pop. It's just

[08:48] never going to materialize. I've also have confirmation that the Goonies is coming out. Well

[08:54] we got Goonies coming out. We've got back to the future coming out. We've got Beetlejuice coming.

[08:59] We've got a lot coming X-Men 97 is a rumor. Pokemon Harry Potter. It feels like right now. I don't

[09:07] know how you feel right now. But maybe this is just me after three weeks on a pullout couch. Maybe

[09:12] it's just me. It just feels like we're in this weird place right now. We're going to get past it.

[09:18] But right now think about it right now. We've got John Wick overpriced a colossal failure. We've got

[09:24] Funhouse remake. These are the new and box games. We've got Abba and we've got Elton John and we've

[09:31] got Looney Tunes, Labyrinth, Texas Jainsaw Massacre. Pulp Fiction is like the outlier. When you

[09:39] think about where we are in pinball at the most expensive period this hobby's ever been. And those

[09:45] are the themes. Princess Bride. It's like, oh man, it's like, I don't know man. These are not the

[09:50] themes that we really would lay down this much money for. But a lot is coming. Harry Potter,

[09:57] Matrix, Back to the Future, Beetlejuice. You know, if this hobby can just hold on a little bit,

[10:04] right? Hold on for dear life. We can just get to the end of this year. I think we're going to start

[10:09] to see themes that somewhat justify the high prices in pinball. But it's not right now. And all

[10:16] these companies raise their prices so prematurely. Like none of these companies, when you think about

[10:20] it, none of these companies raise their prices when they knew they had a juggernaut hit. Think about

[10:27] it. What was the last juggernaut hit for stern pinball? It was Godzilla. And that was 10,500

[10:34] for an LE. What was the last juggernaut hit for Jersey Jack? It was Guns N' Roses. And CEs were

[10:41] 12, 5. What was the last juggernaut hit for spooky pinball? I would argue it's Rick and Morty,

[10:48] right? And Rick and Morty was like 6,800 bucks. You see where I'm going with all this? All these

[10:53] companies have like significantly raised their prices and they don't have those games that are

[10:58] significantly worth it. And we've all been living through it. And I heard another thing. I heard

[11:03] the manufacturers are really mad at Canada. And the reason they're mad at me is that I continue to go

[11:10] on the airwaves and tell everybody that these games are overpriced, that you should all wait and

[11:15] see. And if you don't rush and buy new in box pinball, you're going to get a better deal. And I

[11:21] love that it's upsetting them. I love it. They can invite all the media people they want to see

[11:27] behind the scenes. It doesn't matter, everybody. I love watching when I go on pinside and a new

[11:33] game comes out and the owner's thread is empty, right? And all these dealers and distros are

[11:39] struggling to move their inventory. That's a good thing because when they struggle to move their

[11:44] inventory, guess what's going to happen? They're going to have to put that inventory on sale. And

[11:51] then you and I can buy it for a better price. Why would any of us root for these companies to make

[11:57] the most amount of money they can on a new in box deal? When your friend goes to buy a car, are

[12:03] you like, Johnny, don't do it, man. Don't get the best deal possible. You should really just pay MSRP

[12:10] because we want to see these auto companies survive. And we want to see them make as much money as

[12:15] possible. So why is it when your friend goes to buy a pinball machine, would you ever support them

[12:21] spending this much money? MSRP when the MSRP is a fool's number. And if you just look at the data,

[12:27] every single game, if you bought it MSRP, you've lost like $3,000 to $4,000 over the last three years.

[12:34] So we're doing something right. But finally, I mean it, we're going to get around this curve.

[12:39] And we're going to get the themes that justify some of these higher prices, whether or not they're

[12:45] going to hit it. Bullseye is up to these themes. But when you start to think about stuff like Harry

[12:49] Potter, and you start to think about stuff like Back to the Future, stuff like Beetlejuice, stuff

[12:56] like Pokemon, stuff like Goonies, I think we're going to start to see games again sell out in one

[13:03] day when it comes to the limited version of the game. We haven't seen it in a really long time.

[13:07] And it's because they haven't put anything in front of us that made us want it that bad. Like,

[13:12] how many of you grown adults are like, oh man, I can't wait to wake up today and buy a Looney Tunes

[13:18] or a Texas Chainsaw Massacre? No, there's not even 888 people around the pinball world

[13:25] that needed those games on day one. When they made 750 Rick and Mortys, it sold out in one day.

[13:33] Okay, partially because the price was much better. So I'm really excited to see what happens in July.

[13:40] John Wick is so boring to me right now. Between John Wick, Abba, and freaking Funhouse Remake,

[13:47] like add those three pins together and I would just fall asleep thinking about them.

[13:52] Now there is a wild card that's going to come out the same time as this Metallica.

[13:57] And that wild card in July is supposedly Dutch Pinball X's Alice in Wonderland,

[14:05] a game that we know is coming. We've seen the underside of it and I don't know what they're

[14:10] waiting for, but eventually they're going to have to show us this game. But look, I'm more excited

[14:15] for Alice in Wonderland than Abba or Funhouse Remake or John Wick. It's going to have to be

[14:22] spectacular to be $14,000 because again, I think the days are over of just like a beautiful looking

[14:29] game without much in it and questionable demand. Are people going to throw $14,000? Man, you guys

[14:37] all must be millionaires. If you can just keep buying every single game, 13 here, 13 here,

[14:43] 14 here, it's a lot of cheddar people. The world is getting really expensive and for all of these

[14:48] pins to get our money, it's going to have to be spectacular. So you heard it here now. I'm here

[14:54] to confirm for you that it is going to be Metallica, Ride the Lightning, 40th anniversary. It is happening

[15:00] in July from Stern Pinball. Will they also maybe release Godzilla then or will Godzilla 70th coincide

[15:09] with the date that movie came out in 1954? Maybe it's going to be that. Maybe it's going to be a

[15:13] Metallica, a Cornerstone and then Godzilla. Maybe that's how they end the year. And then we get at

[15:19] the beginning of next year, we get a Pokemon or whatever Rodeo is, you know, the nickname as Jason

[15:25] Knapp was reporting. The nickname for Jack Danger's next game is Rodeo. I don't know. You're never

[15:30] going to guess it. That doesn't really say much because the nickname for John Wick was Waffles.

[15:35] What they should have nicknamed John Wick was Failure. Alright everybody, later.
