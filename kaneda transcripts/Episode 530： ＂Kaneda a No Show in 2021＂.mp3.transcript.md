[00:00] Well, it seems everyone's dreams of the Led Zeppelin pinball in 2020 might be going over

[00:19] like a Led Zeppelin so there is obviously a lot more news now about what Stern's next

[00:24] title is and it is another version of the pin series of games which is the home use only

[00:31] cheaper games. There's a Star Wars game that's already available. I think there's a Spider-Man

[00:35] pin version and so Handlecker Schlemmer in their catalog put out that Stern Pinball is going to be

[00:41] selling a Star Wars comic book art pin edition. Stern is going to have a distributor call with people

[00:49] next Tuesday this upcoming Tuesday in which they're going to reveal the next exciting pin in the

[00:55] lineup of Stern Pinball which is a pin series game and so look this is probably going to be it.

[01:00] I mean maybe this is a red herring and maybe it's not a pin version of Star Wars comic book art

[01:06] but that is confirmed. I mean it's in the catalog for Handlecker Schlemmer so it's coming out.

[01:10] That's really a weird word to say Handlecker Schlemmer. Say that ten times when you're drinking.

[01:16] So but here's the thing maybe maybe just maybe there's an ounce of hope that this is not the

[01:23] reveal that will happen on Tuesday. Maybe it's going to be something else because some distributor

[01:28] out there is telling people that there's an all new Stern game being revealed Tuesday and when

[01:34] people showed him that it was Star Wars comic book art he said it's an all new pin. Now look I know

[01:40] this is an all new available game but if it's comic book art on a Star Wars pin series game

[01:47] that's not brand new because we've already had the Star Wars version of the pin series of pinball.

[01:52] I hate the name of this damn thing. Why is it called pin? Like it's so annoying just to try to explain

[02:00] what you're talking about when they called a damn pinball machine pin. Like uh that is horrible

[02:07] marketing horrible marketing Stern pinball. I can't believe I'm not even going to talk about it anymore

[02:12] but here's the thing nobody wants this no enthusiasm is looking forward to this cheap version

[02:17] stripped down version of the game. All right. Okay so we'll see if Led Zeppelin makes it out this

[02:21] year. I don't think so I've been talking to more people and the reality is Stern does have so many

[02:27] games that they have to make the backlog over at Stern pinball is in the thousands of games. You

[02:33] know all those Ninja Turtles all those Jurassic Parks all those Avengers all those Batman's all

[02:39] these games. I mean the problem with Stern isn't a problem for anyone other than those waiting for

[02:45] games because they make so many titles at once and when you offer eight titles at once people are

[02:51] going to order games left and right and there's so many popular themes that Stern offers that now

[02:57] you have to wait. I mean the new reality in all of pinball and I think everyone starting to wake up

[03:01] to this fact you are no longer going to get your machines right away unless unless it's a Stern

[03:07] cornerstone title and you get one of the early pros or alleys of the game which is how it should

[03:13] be like they should get the games out to operators first even though there's no one playing on

[03:18] location and then you should get the people who spend the most amount of money their alleys.

[03:23] But a new game now a cornerstone game in 2020 have they done all three cornerstone games

[03:29] apparently stranger things which came out in December of 2019 is the first cornerstone game for

[03:36] Stern pinball in 2020. So I think we've seen all three cornerstone games then I think we've seen

[03:41] stranger things we've seen Avengers and what which one am I missing and Ninja Turtles yeah so

[03:47] Ninja Turtles stranger things and Avengers are the three cornerstone machines for Stern pinball

[03:52] in 2020. Now look they may shock us they may surprise us but I don't think we're going to see

[03:58] another cornerstone or Led Zeppelin anytime in 2020 and I know I said it was on the line already

[04:04] and again it just goes to show the horrible horrible information I sometimes get given to me

[04:10] on this show I mean why would someone hit me up and say hey I heard that it's on the line it

[04:15] clearly was either heavy metal or was the Star Wars pin that was on the line so I just got

[04:21] to start using my eyes more not my ears like people tell me with my ears what I want to hear but

[04:27] unless I see this stuff I'm always going to report this stuff as rumors and speculation because

[04:32] unless I see it I don't believe it's true in pinball okay now something that nobody wanted to hear

[04:37] or see was that there is a new tax on pinball that is going to significantly affect the pinball

[04:44] manufacturers the distributors and the customers of pinball and especially all of those people who

[04:51] in the European Union I want to read an email I got from someone who is over in the UK because I

[04:59] think this does a great job of explaining and articulating the situation so let me read this the

[05:05] subject is EU pinball tax greetings from the UK sir over the last few weeks I have been setting up

[05:12] a new pinball supply business for the UK the pinball bizarre like you pinball is a passion project

[05:19] for me and this business is really because importing to the UK has always been really difficult

[05:25] with customs and high shipping charges no one stocked comment ball bearing pin stadium etc so that's

[05:31] the products we are stocking here in the UK amongst others as we move forward I have to say this EU

[05:37] pinball tax is madness utter madness whilst the UK will cease to have to pay this due to us moving

[05:44] to UK global terror where it will move us back to 0% for such things our friends in the EU will

[05:50] be forced to have to bear such costs this isn't great for a hobby which at times can be so expensive

[05:56] it isn't great for suppliers it isn't great for our community who as you know no matter the

[06:02] distance country or culture are able to share enjoy and communicate this passion even in such times

[06:08] as we live in today keep up the great work and stay safe James the pinball bizarre so James thank

[06:13] you for writing in I mean this tax sucks there's no way around it so people started doing the numbers

[06:18] on if you have to pay 25% over the cost of the game with customs you're looking at a stern pro is

[06:26] between 10 and 11 thousand dollars and you're looking at your guns and roses collectors edition

[06:31] that you just dropped 12 5 on is now getting closer to 18 thousand dollars right now obviously the

[06:38] hardest hit on all of this besides the customers is going to be stern pinball because they ship

[06:44] the most amount of games overseas now I feel really bad for the people who just ordered the most

[06:49] recent titles and they haven't shipped yet it's not just stern I mean imagine if you just bought

[06:54] a Rick and Morty you just bought a Rick and Morty it's about to ship and it hasn't arrived yet

[06:59] now your game is going to be 25% more than a guy who got his Rick and Morty delivered maybe a

[07:05] few months ago and that's just painful because you're never going to get that money back and it's

[07:10] money for nothing it really is money for nothing but stern is going to get hit the hardest by all of

[07:16] this then Jersey Jack pinball and if you follow the chain of who's impacted then the distributors I

[07:21] mean all these poor distributors in Europe all of a sudden now how are they going to survive if

[07:27] everyone just starts canceling their orders and waits until this tax is lifted like they can't go

[07:33] months and months and months without any orders and and it's got to be really hard on them and then

[07:38] obviously the end user the consumer you I don't know how you wake up one day no one feels good

[07:44] about this and so I think a lot of them are going to cancel orders and so this might actually free

[07:50] up some difficult to find titles for some of you people do you think people are going to cancel

[07:56] this is an interesting question do you think people are going to cancel their guns and roses

[08:01] collectors edition now that this tax is out there in the world I would argue that this game has

[08:06] appreciated by 25% because of the extreme demand for the game so I would still take this game so

[08:12] let's just close the loop on this that this sucks I never want to see these dumb taxes put in place

[08:18] I hate taxation like this and these damn politicians it's such an annoying thing that they do this

[08:24] stuff it hurts everybody nobody wins in these situations and I hope this does not hurt the

[08:28] companies and the consumers and the distributors that really really suffer if this thing stays in

[08:34] place for a long period of time right now speaking of stuff that's been in place for a long period

[08:39] of time and where we go into the future I want to talk about pinball shows and the likelihood

[08:45] that these pinball shows are going to take place in 2021 because this is just something that I know

[08:52] there's a divided camp on this and I still to this day and really confused as to why there is a

[09:00] divided camp around this pandemic and its impact on pinball and shows and traveling to shows and

[09:09] playing pinball machines because playing pinball with a crowded room of people who have traveled

[09:15] from all over the country and possibly all over the world that is a super spreader event and if you

[09:22] don't think this thing is real and you think it's a hoax and it's media manufactured I don't know

[09:27] what to tell you it's real and the last week in America we have seen the spike of this virus come

[09:34] back like they said it would the scientists have been right all along okay we're now seeing

[09:41] daily cases in America of a hundred thousand plus okay a hundred thousand people and I know that

[09:48] the death rate is not super high but it doesn't matter for a lot of us out there we know somebody

[09:55] who is a high risk candidate for dying if they catch this thing my parents are I'm going to be

[10:02] fully transparent here if my parents caught this they would not survive it my dad has lung problems

[10:10] and my mom is underlying health conditions so you think that I'm going to get on a plane and go to

[10:16] Texas in March to play pinball or maybe accept some plastic trophy which we know we're going to win

[10:22] the fourth twippy you think I'm going to get on a plane and put my parents at risk just for that

[10:28] and even if I'm not in a situation where I'm scared that it's going to kill me if I get it it's

[10:34] for the other people it's the people I love so I want to talk about the pinball shows but here's

[10:39] I want to think about this and I've been saying this on my Facebook page and I think that all

[10:44] these manufacturers must be looking at two things right now they must be looking at the reality

[10:50] of what's happened to their business in 2020 and the reality is this during a COVID pandemic pinball

[10:58] sales have skyrocketed pinball machines have flown off the shelves with absolutely zero shows that

[11:07] these companies went to let's look at the amount of sales and let's talk real quickly about the

[11:12] titles that have had huge sales successes so let's go to Rick and Morty they sold 750 games in

[11:21] four hours without attending a single show that means spooky pinball can pocket all of that money

[11:29] all of the time they lost making games all of the lost labor all of the cost for plane tickets

[11:35] taxis meals whatever all of that money is helping spooky increase their revenue by not having

[11:42] to go to shows then we go to Ninja Turtles right Ninja Turtles without a show sold out of all

[11:50] of their LEDs and sold very well in premium form and pro form it I heard it was a very good

[11:56] selling game for Stern Avengers Ellie sold out the most expensive pinball machine you can buy

[12:02] right now guns and roses collectors edition sold out in one hour right 500 GNR CE's at 12

[12:11] five sold out in one hour and Ellie's are flying off the shelves Stern pinball has back orders

[12:18] that are somewhere around 5,000 units without going to a single show so then the question has to be

[12:26] raised why would these companies in a global pandemic world why would they travel the shows in 2021

[12:34] in which we all know even if there's a vaccine it's not going to be administered to people like you

[12:40] and me first we're definitely not going to have immunization by March when tpf is taking place

[12:47] why would anyone go if you're a manufacturer why would anyone of you travel there knowing the

[12:54] inherent risks associated with it and you best believe nobody globally globally is going to get

[13:01] on a plane and make their way to Texas come March why would people do this and let me state right

[13:08] now I love tpf I can't wait to we all can meet again I love pinball shows for me pinball shows

[13:14] was never about sales it was about meeting up with people it was about purse it was about face-to-face

[13:20] interaction with all of you guys and that's why shows are so special I mean pinball shows are so

[13:25] special because of the social aspect of it and yes you know distributor sell games yes vendors go

[13:31] there and vendors love the shows to get their products out into the community but I'm just here

[13:37] to tell you right now if you look at the actual marketplace of what happens at a pinball show

[13:42] the numbers seem to indicate that you don't need to go to a show to sell your products you just

[13:48] don't we have the internet I mean for most of these vendors too who sell these items like let's take

[13:52] pin stadium for example who's buying pin stadium lights let's face it it's not the casual pinball

[13:58] buyer it's the enthusiasts who's buying pin stadium lights and let me tell you pin stadium is all

[14:04] over Facebook they're all over pinside they have no they have no problem reaching people and

[14:09] showing people what their product is you know the internet is there and they've got the tools to

[14:14] reach their customers and you don't have to jump on a machine I mean also the incredible sales

[14:19] of 2020 is funny to me because what hasn't happened right the majority of these games have sold

[14:25] in which none of us were even able to play these games before we bought them and so if you're a

[14:30] pinball company you're thinking to yourself wait a minute I don't even need to have people play

[14:35] my product to sell the product this is great news we can save so much money think about all the money

[14:42] Dutch pinball spent flying around the world renting out pen houses acting like rock stars it's a lot

[14:49] of money to ship pinball machines from the Netherlands all the way to Texas all the way to Chicago all

[14:55] that money and I'm telling you all this traveling and all this partying all that money is what

[15:02] crippled a lot of these startup pinball companies because they just couldn't afford the cost associated

[15:08] with all of that and manufacture the games and order all the parts you know Andrew highway never

[15:14] had to go around the world with alien alien already went around the world with the movie people love

[15:20] these themes all you gotta do is make a theme people love show them that you can make it and people

[15:26] will buy it there is absolutely no need to be at these shows to sell these games and I would argue

[15:31] with anyone who says otherwise now I do want the shows to come back but I'm just here to tell you

[15:37] right now I think shows in 2021 are still a pipe dream and I don't think they're going to happen

[15:43] but here's what's probably going to happen I still think they're gonna do shows because

[15:48] what happened is a lot of people didn't get refunded for their tickets in 2020 they got their tickets

[15:55] rolled over into 2021 and so I don't know if shows can financially survive two years in a row if they

[16:02] have to refund everybody's money and so I think tpf might still happen but it's going to be a very

[16:08] very small show because a lot of people are not going to go there a lot of people in Texas won't

[16:12] even go there I'm not going to go there and it's why I think some of these shows that are coming

[16:18] up quickly like it's going to come up much sooner than you realize I think they need to start

[16:22] thinking about canceling these shows I mean they've already canceled same Patrick's day parades

[16:28] in certain cities and I think the same things gonna happen with these super spreader events and

[16:33] pinball is not a safe activity to do with a bunch of strangers traveling from all over and first

[16:38] and foremost the thing that matters the most to me is your health and safety that matters more to me

[16:45] than going to shows and having drinks and steaks with you guys it just does and I don't think it's

[16:51] safe for anyone to go to these shows and I know that's not going to be music to the ears of people

[16:55] who do these shows and they're going to be upset but it's it's just the facts it's the facts of

[17:00] of science and and what this thing can do and all you need is a few people at that show who have it

[17:06] or asymptomatic and that's it that's it go study on how this thing spreads okay now look I know

[17:12] I there's some people out there that are punching they're punching their speaker or their

[17:16] headsets right now being like canada like you're such a New York City like bleeding heart no

[17:22] I'm not I'm just someone who actually likes to look at the facts of things and draw a logical

[17:28] conclusion to what should be done all right so speaking of facts and logical conclusions it is a

[17:34] fact that pinball toppers are overpriced and it is a fact that so many of the recent pinball toppers

[17:42] that stern pinball has released have not really given you your money's worth thousand dollar

[17:47] toppers right Ninja Turtles Elvira 700 dollars for the Star Wars topper that looks so cheap so

[17:54] there is a new pinball topper company in town and first and foremost I just want to say this is

[17:59] a really smart business model to go into pinball accessories are where the money is now there's

[18:07] a huge challenge to pinball accessories and we're going to talk about what that is but these guys

[18:12] are called elite pinball toppers now the reason why I'm going to give my pros and cons to this

[18:18] business model the pro is this there have been so many cheap toppers over the years and people love

[18:24] pinball toppers and they they describe their inspiration I want to read it right now they said

[18:28] elite pinball toppers was tired of seeing flat plastic two-dimensional toppers with lights and

[18:35] stickers fetching six hundred dollars we want it more for the pinball community we desired 3D

[18:42] molds motorized features LCD screens and more with no solution available elite pinball toppers was

[18:49] created to bring exactly that to the pinball community all right well look I'm all on board for

[18:55] this so the first step in all market research do you have a problem that you want to solve with

[19:02] your product right what's the tension that we're going to lean into and that will ultimately lead

[19:09] you down a road in which hopefully you build a product that is solving a problem and I agree with

[19:14] all of this the these cheap toppers that cost earn like 50 bucks to make and they charge hundred

[19:20] to dollars for absolutely bogus okay then they tell us their background elite pinball toppers

[19:26] provides players and owners in immersive experience that is unmatched in the industry our company has a

[19:32] deep history of specialized skill sets within the fabrication engineering and automotive industry

[19:40] the implementation of these skill sets into our pinball toppers is what sets us apart from the

[19:46] competition so the thing about this is I'm always a little bit like when you're fresh out of the

[19:52] gate when you're fresh out of the gate you got to be a little bit careful how much you boast about

[19:58] how you're so much better because of this this and this but I will say this they've released their

[20:02] first product and their product does look really awesome we're going to talk about that but that is

[20:08] their background so obviously these are some engineers and some people who understand how to do

[20:13] woodwork metal work and engineering and work with technologies like LCD screens right then they go

[20:19] to innovation innovation is a hot topic in the pinball community we are hard at work designing

[20:24] incredibly detailed 3d molds incorporating mechanical properties and integrating light shows

[20:29] into our toppers we pride ourselves in pushing the topper industry to new levels of creativity

[20:35] okay so here's my thing and they just released the hobbit topper if you go to straight down the

[20:40] middle Zach does a great video unboxing it and showing you what the topper is I want to give you

[20:45] a couple thoughts on this company and the topper right now so first and foremost I think that this

[20:52] is a great business model I think if they can make high quality toppers they are going to have an

[20:57] audience for what they create now the next thing I'll say is this I would not have limited my company

[21:04] to just toppers if you have these men who are very skilled and can create amazing things to make

[21:11] pinball experiences better why limit yourself to just the topper so I would do more what Leo

[21:18] is doing the art of pinball in which he makes amazing toppers but he also makes other things

[21:23] because again there's just money you're going to leave on the table if you can make sculpts why not

[21:28] just keep the door open for other aspects of pinball so elite pinball toppers might not have been

[21:34] the company I named it maybe it is elite pinball modifications right or elite pinball mods something

[21:42] that opens the door and they could easily do that that's just the first thing out of the gate it

[21:45] always reminds me of Burlington coat factory they called it Burlington coat factory and then they

[21:50] had to spend all of their marketing effort to tell people they had more than just coats right we

[21:55] have more than just toppers so they also started a pinside thread in which they announced their

[22:00] company and how it's going to work and again they're doing a smart thing in which they're making a

[22:05] limited edition number of these habit toppers they're making 50 of them and they said they can make

[22:11] 4 to 8 units per week and they want to have all 50 orders fulfilled and delivered before January 31st

[22:18] the cost of their habit topper is $750 and it comes in a nice wooden box when they ship it which

[22:26] is great it's $50 for shipping so I want to applaud these gentlemen on being completely transparent

[22:33] completely open about how they're going to do everything I actually reached out to them to get

[22:37] them on the show to talk about this because I am I am curious about the sustainability of a

[22:43] topper business company and I'll explain why in a minute so let's talk about their habit topper

[22:48] first it is the open book it is the the there and back again novel that Bilbo Baggins is working in

[22:56] and it is basically a bigger version of the book that's on the game itself so if you look at the

[23:02] habit in the upper right corner there's the book that has the LCD screen they are basically making a

[23:07] bigger version of that that's nicely sculpted in wood it looks beautiful and it sits on top of

[23:13] your machine and it displays what's on that little screen up on the big screen on top of the game

[23:20] what do I think of this topper I do think it's crafted beautifully and I also think it's the

[23:25] silliest thing I've ever seen you're putting a screen on top of a screen that's on top of a

[23:31] screen I mean think about it you've got the screen on the play field then you go up and you've

[23:35] got that huge screen which is the game screen and then you go up again you've got another screen

[23:40] and I'm sorry but pinball needs less screens not more when I saw this and I saw Zach put it on

[23:47] top of the machine and I saw him turn it on I think there's a reason why he wasn't like playing

[23:53] the game for very long like he didn't want to really show us the way the topper worked in gameplay

[23:59] because if you did see the way this topper works it's so silly like you can't look up there

[24:05] there's absolutely no point in making a topper that's got like movie clips going like think it

[24:12] just think about a pinball machine for a moment if you're gonna play movie clips where's the last

[24:17] place you'd want to put those movie clips I'd rather see them on an LCD that's on the play field

[24:22] I'd rather see them even on the apron bar I'd maybe see them on you know obviously on the main LCD

[24:29] or display of the game itself but to put them all the way on the top of the game itself it absolutely

[24:36] makes no sense and I think it's silly and again that is gonna be the challenge because when you

[24:41] think about making toppers it's not just about putting a beautiful sculpt up there if you want to

[24:46] make it interactive with the game I think you need to like really make it interactive with the

[24:51] game and make it make sense right Leore made a topper for the hopper that's got smoug it's got the

[24:56] dragon I think it even breathes like smoke and fire and it's coming between the buildings and

[25:02] obviously his toppers much more expensive than the 750 buck one but on some level I think you

[25:07] need to come up with concepts and ideas that make sense and I just don't think this one makes sense

[25:13] the other thing I don't get is this why are they starting with the hobbit the hobbit is a game

[25:18] and this is just marketing strategy the hobbit is a game that is so irrelevant now like nobody and

[25:24] I mean nobody thinks the hobbit is a game that is hard to get no one's clamoring for a hobbit the

[25:30] hobbit's coming gone and if you're gonna launch a pinball mod company why would you start with the

[25:36] game that has a very I mean a very small group of people that want to upgrade it they really it's

[25:42] just not that kind of game you know the hobbit just doesn't strike me as a game that's like a keeper

[25:48] it's not a game that people are gonna pump tons of money in and and never let it go and I if I were

[25:53] them I would have made a topper for a game that is a larger audience and then again this is just

[25:57] out of the gate these guys are gonna still make more toppers but I'm just saying it's always a

[26:02] weird place to start with the hobbit now here's why I think people do start with the hobbit and this

[26:06] is the main thing that's going to impact this company's ability to get you guys toppers frequently

[26:12] real simple the one thing they don't have is they don't have IP rights to make toppers that in

[26:19] fringe on the IP of the license so they couldn't make a topper for vendors that showed any of the

[26:26] Avengers up there they couldn't use Thanos's glove so they're gonna run into an issue with

[26:32] license games real quickly because it's really difficult to create toppers and then leave out any

[26:39] of the elements of the IP that we love so let's take guns and roses for example right now because

[26:44] I know Lee Or is working on a guns and roses topper now if you look at the Jersey Jack topper

[26:48] Jersey Jack has the guns and roses bullet logo they can say guns and roses they can put band

[26:54] members up there they can use any G&R asset they want to sit on top of the machine now if you

[27:00] made a guns and roses topper without any of the band members yeah you can use stuff like generic

[27:05] skulls and guns and generic roses but you can't use anything from the band itself did you see that

[27:11] topper the guy released with the lights right with the guns and roses logos all over you can't

[27:16] do that that's illegal that guy's gonna get shut down immediately and we used to be able to do

[27:21] this without permission right I used to have a Lord the Rings topper I think was like Matt McKay or

[27:25] Matt McKee it was like this amazing metal topper and it said Lord the Rings and it had the fellowship

[27:31] walking and had red lights and it was made out of metal it was awesome you can't do that now legally

[27:37] like if they release those toppers now sternwood send you a cease and to cease so fast and that's why

[27:42] they pay so much money for these licenses so they have permission to make the money on those mods

[27:47] so this is going to be the biggest challenge for this company is figuring out how to make toppers

[27:53] that don't in fringe on the IP that still feel like special and something you do want to put on top

[27:59] of the game right so what what topper could they make for Avengers let's look at the hot

[28:04] properties right now what topper could you make for the Avengers that people would want what topper

[28:08] could you make for Ninja Turtles that people would want that doesn't have anything to do with the IP

[28:12] so you could go to stuff like Big Lebowski with like the bowling and the marijuana and all that

[28:17] stuff that might be the next stop I would look at the original games that are out there right

[28:22] all these remakes by Chicago gaming company but the problem there is Chicago gaming companies toppers

[28:26] are the best in the business they are 3D sculpted and I don't think anyone who buys a CGC game who gets

[28:32] that beautiful topper is looking to replace it so it's going to be interesting to see where these

[28:36] guys go next now I think they will probably expand beyond just toppers because there's way more

[28:42] money to be made on mods on the playfield than there is just on top of the game I'm glad they're

[28:49] around I look forward to seeing what they do but I just don't think putting a TV on top of the TV

[28:55] on top of the TV is is really the way to go out of the gate alright alright what else is going on

[29:00] and pinball did you see that great American pinball they were at the jersey jack factory and they

[29:05] took and shared pictures of guns and roses collectors edition number one now I just want to say this

[29:13] this is the sexiest machine I've seen in a really long time it's gorgeous this machine is gorgeous

[29:19] it looks beautiful I know all you Ellie owners out there need to convince yourselves that the

[29:24] Ellie is better than the CE it's subjective it's artwork I think they're both incredibly gorgeous

[29:31] machines I really do I love a lot of stuff about both of them but those rad cows and here's the

[29:37] part that's going to be the sickest thing with the CE is the the glitter when that glitter is

[29:42] on that playfield and the light show is going it is going to add an extra effect and sparkle

[29:48] to the concert going experience that is G and R it's going to be incredible and then of course

[29:53] the one thing that all the CE owners are just going to wave in the faces of every single Ellie owner

[30:00] is that coma ball lock in the apron it's like the one thing that no modder is going to be able to do

[30:06] maybe they can like maybe someone's going to sell an entirely new apron with that mech in it with

[30:12] everything done you would but but here's the thing the code for that won't be in the Ellie code or

[30:16] maybe it is who knows who knows if they can do it but anyway you're not going to see your

[30:21] collectives additions this year though people like I'm just telling you right now if you are

[30:24] in on a CE you are not going to get your game this year so you're going to need a little patience

[30:30] going into 2021 now when will they hit the line I still don't know yet all eyes as I said on the

[30:36] last show are going to be on the new LEDs that ship and if the play field issues are better because

[30:43] don't forget about this see how easy it is to forget about all these play field issues like a

[30:48] week or two goes by and if can it is not ranting about it you're really not going to hear it on

[30:53] the other shows like you're just going to hear people talk about this stupid stirring coffee table

[30:57] book that costs $8,000 to ship I mean why don't why don't people just go pick up the book why

[31:03] doesn't one person this is what I don't get if this company's not a fraud this paper flock company

[31:09] why doesn't one person just go pick up all the books get a truck load up the books and then why

[31:15] doesn't that person just ship it to everyone at a normal cost see this company they need that

[31:21] shipping money it's crazy right they need that shipping money to probably make the damn books

[31:25] I don't understand that it's a stupid book it's just a book doesn't cost anything to mail books

[31:31] all right Brenda's like what are you talking about a book the more I thank people for donating to

[31:37] the show the more people donate which is great and for those of you out there we've done 530 episodes

[31:48] older episodes so some of you new listeners can listen to them I'm probably going to do it like
