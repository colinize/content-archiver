[00:00] Well I beat the drum and hold the phone The sun came out today

[00:07] We're born again, there's new graphs on the deals

[00:18] Welcome to episode 419 of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:22] The only Pimball Podcast with exclusive world gameplay footage

[00:27] of retro atomic zombie adventure land

[00:30] On this episode we are going to talk to Derek

[00:34] Derek is down in Houston has been at the show has played this game many many times

[00:41] So what I wanted to do was just ask him what it was like playing retro atomic zombie adventure land

[00:47] Now we know if you read Pinsley that Derek is a fan of the game and he likes the game

[00:51] But I wanted him to articulate for us all of his feelings about the game because often times too on Pinsley

[00:58] You're not really having a debate or a dialogue with people

[01:01] And that thread has just become another one of Pinsley's perfect toxic dumpster fire threads

[01:09] In which so many people who have never played the game who have never stood in front of the game

[01:14] Who have never done anything other than log on to the internet to complain about something new Pimball related

[01:20] Are jumping in there and giving their two cents but I've heard from many people who have played the game

[01:26] And the overall consensus is that the game is really fun to shoot there's a lot in it

[01:31] And you'll hear when I talk to Derek you know I ask him

[01:34] You know does the game have that magic that J-pop magic does it deliver on all of the hyperbole that Deeproot has been promising us now

[01:42] I think it's important that for all of us just to remember that this is just a prototype

[01:46] This is not the deeproot package

[01:48] We've never seen anyone ever do this before we haven't and this is why I think it's hard for people to know how they should respond to this prototype

[01:56] We've never seen a company put a game out for people to play it a show with the caveat that all of this can change

[02:04] That this is not the cabinet this is not the artwork

[02:07] This is not the play field we're going to use that there there may be things mechanically that we had just before we launched this game

[02:13] This isn't the final well this isn't the final code we've seen that before but you know what I'm saying it's hard for us to stand over this game

[02:19] And fully understand what their intentions are because I think all of it all of it when we see the final deeproot package needs to

[02:29] Needs to feel special and I do think it needs to feel more special than what we've seen so far

[02:35] Now again that's not to say I don't like what I see I do I do like what I see and I do love J-pop games

[02:41] And I think it is probably a lot of fun to shoot but that's not what the promise was in terms of what we would get from deeproot

[02:48] Pimball it wasn't just to make another you know good Pimball machine

[02:52] It was actually to push Pimball forward in a lot of different ways and I think if we look at the game so far

[02:58] I'm not saying like a mech that pushes anything radically forward the display is cool

[03:03] But we've seen a lot of great displays from companies like Jersey Jack Pimball and Stern Pimball

[03:08] You know the sound's not blowing me away the lighting system in the game is not unique at all but again I think that's to come

[03:15] And I say that's a darek I think like the deeproot cabinet will have different lighting features that we're not seeing in the standard cabinet

[03:22] Alright so him and I have a great discussion about this game

[03:25] But after this point I don't think we're gonna see much and I wouldn't show much more if I was Robert and deeproot

[03:31] I would let people you know once again sort of let it go and see what they come back with with the final product

[03:39] But I don't I don't think it's a smart move to show games really early and make consumers part of the development process of the game

[03:48] It doesn't work it doesn't work anymore with marketing it just you have to drop it on people in the most spectacular way possible

[03:56] And then open up the order books that day and then ship people those games in a few weeks like that is the only way to be commercially successful in Pimball

[04:06] And so the real question people should be asking is basically can they get manufacturing ready to hit the deadlines now we know they have to hit

[04:16] Right June 30th is the end of it but they you know I think they're gonna want to have games available to buy around TpF and March April this year

[04:23] So we'll see we'll see okay everybody Derek talking about Raza he played the game I didn't maybe take what he says a little bit more than what I say

[04:33] Have a great day everyone thank you for listening to canators pinball podcasts episode 419

[04:39] Okay amongst all of the pin side debate and drama about Raza

[04:46] We have someone who actually played the game at Houston multiple times Derek welcome back to canators pinball podcast

[04:55] Thanks for having me you know and Derek I'm super excited because this game is almost like seven years in the making and finally it's out there for people to flip

[05:05] So what I want to do on this episode is just get your impressions of what it was like to play this game we'll talk a little bit about the features

[05:13] How does that sound sure sounds great alright so what was it like walking up to this game for the first time I mean you've got a

[05:21] Pirates the Caribbean you've got a Star Wars you've got this talk to me about your first impressions walking up to the game

[05:28] Well we arrived at the show Thursday night while everyone was still setting up and we went to go walk around and see what was going on

[05:36] And we saw the deeper folks setting up and doing some test plays and so obviously we were excited to see the game

[05:43] And you know we kind of hung around and start taking pictures and taking video of them playing and they were super nice and super gracious

[05:50] And I asked if we could play it and they kind of you know got there okay and said yeah sure so we got to do like two or three games that first night

[05:57] Not a lot that first night but you know we got to get to be the first ones to jump on it which was pretty cool

[06:03] First impression was I was probably drawn to that Corsk her ramp first and so one of my first games I nailed that ramp right off the bat

[06:14] And the deep root folks are like wow that's that's great you know you hit it really hard and so I was kind of encouraged by that

[06:20] Another thing that hit me right off the bat was there's this little wiggle track on the left of the screen or left of the play field rather

[06:27] And when you have a kick back it shoots up in that and it looks optically like it's a straight lane but the ball zigzags on top of it

[06:34] And it's a very neat optical illusion it's got a little clear plastic track that causes the ball to wiggle but the first time you see it it's like wow

[06:41] Because it looks like the ball is doing something impossible right that was pretty fun

[06:45] So that's on the left out lane yes I can see that yeah it's really hard I guess that's the other thing too

[06:52] When you look at a picture of a J-pop game statically it's really hard to understand what's going to happen with the ball

[07:02] Where things are supposed to go and I think that's probably making it difficult for people who are just looking at images right to understand

[07:11] Some of the whimsical magic or different stuff the ball is going to do right I mean you can't get it from a photo

[07:18] Yeah, I mean I would call those moments of delight you know nailing the ramp and the wiggle track those were the initial moments of delight right off the bat

[07:25] Like before I'd even gotten a read on the rules or what to do or anything

[07:28] So this big ramp is been a topic of discussion I'm looking at it right now and so basically Derek if you hit it strong enough it loops around and goes all the way to the top

[07:39] And then drops into the sort of the right plastic ramp that returns it to the right flippers that what happens when it gets to the top of that quirk screw

[07:48] We actually found that it can return to either one of those return ramps

[07:52] Oh so can is there a diverter up there?

[07:55] I'm not sure if there's a diverter or if it's just kind of a physics thing where it just depends on where it falls

[08:00] But yeah it goes either way

[08:02] So is that the only way to get the ball to the left plastic ramp that returns to the left slingshot it looks like is it through the quirk screw

[08:11] You may be right yeah I'm looking at the play field right now I'm trying to look at like that's always the thing with J-pop games like how does a ball get from A to B

[08:20] And so I'm looking at the left ramp and I'm wondering how you access that it looks like it's all connected somewhere in the back there

[08:30] Yeah yeah underneath where the top of the hill is for the ramp

[08:37] Now how hard was it to get up the top of that ramp because I keep hearing we've heard from some people on Pinside it was really difficult that maybe you know some guy said he hit it like one out of 20 attempts

[08:47] Do you think the flipper power was the issue or you just have to nail it?

[08:51] I think that people on Pinside are looking at six minutes of video footage and making an assessment that's incorrect

[08:58] We watched lots of people play it we played it ourselves and you don't make it every time but you make it at least you know every time you play the game

[09:06] I'd say it's about 40 to 50%

[09:09] The engineers there said they actually put a lot of effort into tweaking that to get the field just right and to me it felt that way

[09:16] I don't think it's not one of those things that's frustrating either so it's like if you don't make it you're not screwed

[09:22] It rolls back down and there's a hole in the bottom of the ramp and it drops it in that center area kind of to the right of the atomic shop

[09:29] Okay

[09:30] Alright so the ramps are a will continue to be a big topic of discussion and was it just in terms of nail and it though you kept saying like it's very satisfying shot to hit

[09:41] For sure

[09:43] Yeah absolutely it is

[09:44] Now this game looks packed with stuff Derek so as you were playing it what kinds of toys and things you were interacting with

[09:51] What what what stuff really gave you those I think you used to great was moments of the light what what was what were the most delightful things to shoot at in this game

[10:00] So there are a couple of things

[10:03] You know when you start with a new pinball machine and you don't know the rules you kind of revert to what's flashing and shoot the thing that's flashing

[10:10] And they made that really easy there's a big flashing hot dog insert near the back this is shoot Ned or target Ned or something like that

[10:17] And there's a moving target back there that goes back and forth and so you start hitting that and that lights the zombie letters on the play field and if you get zombie fully lit you get a multi ball

[10:26] So that's kind of like the first thing that I was shooting for and trying for and that was fun to do

[10:31] It's a it's an interesting shot because I mean it's a moving target you can have to nail it not just where you want it but also time it so that it will hit

[10:39] The target right and you know that's that's something unique for me anyway in pinball right it just have you played I said this looks like the goalie in world championship

[10:49] Sockered have you played that game is it's sort of like a similar mechanism there just the back I can't say I've played that one but it wouldn't surprise me if they

[10:57] Barred from things that have worked on previous games right. Okay, so that light zombie what what else walk us around some of these things I'm seeing an atomic

[11:06] Shop I'm seeing a zombie spinner head sure so the atomic shop is there's a stand up target in front of it and when you hit it it drops open to let you shoot the atomic shop

[11:18] But it only stays open for about five seconds so you have to very quickly get it in that shop if you do that's a mode start

[11:24] And the mode that I saw most commonly when we started that was called Hall of mirrors and this is kind of like if you remember those like

[11:33] Slide puzzles where there's a you know heads on the top and bodies on the bottom and you have to slide them together. Yeah, the screen displays those and you have to get

[11:43] Ned who's your adversary displayed on the screen and shooting the left orbit moves the top and shooting the right orbit moves the bottom and so you're aiming for the orbits to get these things

[11:52] Disliding place to make Ned appear. Talk to me about the orbit shots are they easy to nail. They are moderate I would say the nice thing about the orbits is they return to the flippers so it's not like a case where you have to worry about it coming out of the orbit and manage it to keep it from draining. Gotcha. Okay, and when you talk about the code that's the other thing you know there's just a there's a bunch of crappy cell phone video of this game.

[12:20] Being played and did the best I could man. Yeah, no, it's okay. It's just between the lighting and over the shoulder like nobody had here's what I'm shocked about. Here's what I'm shocked about in a world in which we have all these

[12:35] pinball streamers right so many of which went to expo with their gear and yada yada nobody showed up at the show with a good with good gear to get a good stream going of the game. I'm shocked. I blame myself. It was I should have brought my stuff. You should have done it. You would have been I love it. Some other

[12:54] pie is some other pockets were like this is the world exclusive gameplay and it was just like over the shoulder crap. There's no there was no exclusively setup great gameplay walk through the game. And I think because of that people were saying that there was no code in the game. Now talk to me about the code and and how how it sounded like what was what was going on with that screen and with the audio.

[13:15] So the first video that I posted on YouTube on my YouTube channel you can hear the audio because this was before the show got busy and where and I had to volume turned up pretty well so you're able to hear some of the sounds. It's got some nice carnival themed music like you would expect.

[13:31] Really nice sound effects some good spinner sound effects. There's a rotating duck target on the left and when you hit that it kind of makes this evil echoey zombie duck quack sound that's kind of amusing.

[13:43] How does it sound there do a Jersey Jack machine or start I would say it's definitely on paris is David teal. I mean what else would you expect and the quality of the audio is on on par as well. I believe so yeah I thought it sounded great.

[13:57] Okay and then let's talk about the screen so what was the display like how do you like that stretch screen.

[14:03] I thought the display looked great the animations are very smooth and they transition in and out of interstitials and back to the score display very elegantly.

[14:12] I really feel like this was top notch animation work.

[14:16] Okay and where there are a lot of call outs I think when I was watching streams just trying to get it was hard to get a sense of like the narrative right because when we saw the deep route intro video to rise at the

[14:26] whole there's all this narrative and the story about what you're about to go into this you know adventure land with that that as zombies and Ned.

[14:36] Was there was there like a lot of call outs and was there some sort of narrator walking you through what you're doing in this game at this point.

[14:45] You know I'm not sure if I remember call outs specifically there wasn't any kind of an intro or a story that I could see but I wouldn't really expect that at this stage I mean it is important to point out that this was a prototype game.

[14:59] So that they could get code debugues you know get bugs found in the code and also get feedback from players on what they like and what they don't.

[15:06] Right so I don't expect this to be the whole inch a lot at this point well and I'm sure that a lot of what they were just trying to do is see how this stuff holds.

[15:14] Under you know 48 hours of constant play at a show which is it which is their pressure testing these mechanisms.

[15:22] Alright so there's a Ferris wheel as well in this game right how do you how do you activate that thing.

[15:29] So if you nail the orbit the left orbit it falls back down into the Ferris wheel and then gets returned to you.

[15:37] So it gets the Ferris wheel is fed from the back okay and it rolls the ball forward and then comes back out through that orbit that says atomic and what's this what's this shot on the left side that has like a ramp or jump ramp into a target.

[15:51] What what's that I think that's pretty cool that's the daredevil ramp and so the way that works you have to nail the shot with enough velocity to make the leap and hit the target and then it falls back down and kind of opens back up to let the ball return to you.

[16:05] I think that's an unique meck when you do that there's like a daredevil motorcycle jumping cars and stuff on the screen it's kind of cool.

[16:14] Interesting you know such a J pop game I mean it's hard there's like there's like rabbits lightning bolts vampires Ferris wheel it's like there's so many strange elements happening at once.

[16:26] That's why I'm really curious to see how the storyline kind of you know connects them on weaves them together on the right side.

[16:33] This is something that I saw on Magic Girl there's that black disc that spins was that that activate how how did that thing get implemented into gameplay.

[16:44] It got activated I can't say I had enough play to know what it's about what starts it and or anything like that I did see it move though.

[16:52] Okay and then on the right out lane there is a Magnus save with it with there's two buttons on the right side of the cabinet correct.

[16:59] Yes. Okay and the lower one does the magnet where you able or did you see anyone ever successfully activate that.

[17:06] Yeah I did.

[17:08] And it works as you would expect.

[17:11] Okay it just holds the ball.

[17:12] All right release it when you want.

[17:14] Okay now it's interesting some of this stuff definitely was on the Magic Girl that I had.

[17:19] If you were to say you know looking over this game are there any other elements that were missing in terms of toys and features that you want to talk about.

[17:29] Well there's a couple of things there is what did they call it a tube.

[17:34] There's a ball lock to the right of the attack Ned target and I forget what they call that.

[17:41] Yeah there's like a vertical hot dog not named a hot dog just like an oval shaped insert above the letter Z.

[17:49] And that points to a ball lock.

[17:51] And so you can lock ball.

[17:53] Sinon shot it looks.

[17:54] Sinon scene on to that's what it is yes.

[17:57] And the balls get locked underneath it looks like can you see them underneath the plate is that is that is that where they lock or is it.

[18:04] I think that's just a lit insert I'm not really sure though.

[18:07] I think you're right I think you're right.

[18:10] Now let me let's zoom out a little bit because you are right this is a prototype and I asked I asked Robert at deep route is everything we're going to see mechanically in the game in the game.

[18:20] So I think this is the game I when people say there's more to come what what is going to come is the final deep route package of this game which it seems like the cabinet will be different.

[18:34] The play field material right Robert said you could take a sledgehammer to a deep route game right ain't ain't nobody taking a sledgehammer to a Mirko play field wood in game right so it's interesting to see what comes next how do the artwork look because it looks very green and purple and did it look better in person than some of the photos were seeing.

[18:57] It did to me I'm actually really disappointed with the way the photos came out there were two machines and one was very dark and the GI on the game was very dark and I gave them that feedback that it was really you know a little too dark the other machine was directly under an overhead light and so much easier to see and that's the one that I played most and that's the one that I shot video of most.

[19:19] But the downside there is it gave everything this weird greenish tent for whatever reason you know what I have to meet go ahead you know go ahead.

[19:27] The art to me looked really good in person it's a combination it is like an electric green you know it's like a fluorescent green I almost wonder if it is fluorescent like if you could have maybe some black lights to really accentuated on the final machine I don't know.

[19:40] Who's the artist did they did you ask did they do they tell us.

[19:44] I didn't ask I should have.

[19:47] So much for being the Canadian correspondent that's going to get you guys all the answers you want know it looks a little bit I lose in this job.

[19:53] Zombie Yeti did the first raza art package on the play field I don't think this looks like zombie Yeti but I will get clarification on that.

[20:02] So here's what this is going to happen to because this game does look very dark and my magic girl was like really dark when the lights went out but I fully expect the deep root final package.

[20:14] Derek to have a built in sort of pin stadium like lighting system in it there is no way.

[20:21] And this is why I think a lot of the innovation and what Roberts bringing to pinball it's still a question mark because this isn't it like this is not the deep root package this is just John's game thrown into a standard cabinet to get testing on the play field mix.

[20:38] So it's hard for us right to sort of fully understand the the full experience this game is is supposed to fulfill for us.

[20:48] Yeah I agree what I saw was really exciting to me you know I I would buy one of these now if they had them for sale because we really had fun playing it.

[20:58] And if there's more to come in terms of innovation around the cabinet and everything that's just icing on the cake right now in terms of value perception as someone who you have a you have a stern star was pro you we know you love Jersey Jack games.

[21:12] Where do you where does this fall at and I know it's a prototype but where would you put this is feel like it has the premiumness of a Jersey Jack where they could charge.

[21:21] 75 to 9 does it feel more like a stern premium like what what what was your perception of where this game might fall in the marketplace.

[21:31] You know we had a pretty lengthy discussion about that me and my buddies and it I'm not really sure it's kind of like if they sell this at a stern pro price it's an insta buy like it's absolutely no question I would buy it at that price.

[21:45] If it was a stern premium price Jersey Jack entry level price still probably there it's got a lot of stuff in it for the game for the price and I think it's still probably there.

[21:56] Okay I don't know if there's going to be different trim levels you know like like the other manufacturers do or not.

[22:03] Right yeah no when you look at a J pop game it it's it's always like it's always hard to to imagine them taking stuff out because this stuff is so like zany wacky and weird but it all kind of needs to go together to make the game work the way he envisions it so I don't think you're going to see like a pro version of a J pop game.

[22:25] But so do you so there's a there's a long road to go from this game to production and mass production of these games do you think Derek they're going to be able to hit their deadlines of April March at the earliest with June 30th at the latest they said to get these games out the door.

[22:43] Well the feeling I had was that this was really far along and you know doing this kind of public test debug cycle is part of the process on getting the thing done.

[22:55] I really I have no way to assess whether they'll hit the target or not but you know I think I've got a good shot because they were really far along.

[23:03] Yeah it's going to be interesting to see if they can get the hype back though right because this is now we know the game.

[23:09] You know so then I've been saying like the full deep route package doesn't have enough of a of a wow factor that they have yet to show us right and that's going to be something I'm curious about the other thing to do because this game has been in development for almost seven years right can you imagine they're giving Eric over at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[23:31] Seven years to develop a game.

[23:36] Well you know is the seven years really fair because there were some different companies involved and some restarts involved.

[23:42] Let's cut it in half. Imagine giving Eric three and a half years to tinker.

[23:48] That's a game I'd buy.

[23:49] Well I guess I guess my thing is and I know you love the game I guess I would I'm zooming out and I'm just asking one question though after all these years after all this development after all this time.

[24:00] You know John had to like work on the game and I just want to voice what I'm hearing from some other people as well.

[24:06] Is there one mechanism in this game that just feels like it has the wow factor.

[24:14] Well you know as I said my favorite meck was the ramp with the hill that you climb.

[24:21] I understand a lot of these I remember I'm kind of new to pinball to I mean I got into this in 2017 and I don't really have a lot of interest in the older titles and so some of these things have been done before and I didn't know it like for example the fairs wheel I'm like man that's really cool and then you know my buddy walked me over to a hurricane and showed me that it has two fairs wheels just like it.

[24:40] Oh okay well they're using a proven meck that they know works right.

[24:46] You know the dizzy doozy the little spinner that's like the totain lamp that's kind of fun to hit.

[24:51] You know I can't really give you an assessment that there's anything that's you know ground breaking just because my perspective on the hobby is different well you know I think when we when we've heard a lot of the talk of like wait you see the innovation wait you see what we push forward.

[25:11] Yeah I think it's as I look at it I'm like well I don't really see it in terms of like a mechanical standpoint right now so I'm wondering where that big innovation is going to lie within the company.

[25:22] It does look like a J-pop game it looks like they fixed a lot of the problems with Raza and you know I'm curious to see how they approach Magic Girl moving forward as well and also right there's a lot of other designers that are making games for deep roots so this is just like a John game.

[25:39] You know what is what is a Dennis Norman deep root game going to be your Barrio or a you know John Norris so they've got other people designing games as well so curious to see how they how they share their portfolio with us moving forward so Derek alright so on a scale of one to ten how excited are you for Raza after playing it.

[26:04] I'd say eight or nine you know this is the game that I spent most of my time on at the show it's a game that I would buy if I could buy it today and every time I finished a game I wanted to play another one it has that you know one more time then going for it which is what I look for in pins right.

[26:22] Any Willie walk is at the show.

[26:25] No there weren't any there.

[26:27] Okay so I know and you're waiting for your collector's edition now walk me through when you're getting it.

[26:33] I believe sometime around the twenty fifth is what my distributor said most recently so my true thanksgiving I hope so my SC just went out the door about thirty minutes ago and so we have wonka depression in the house right now and you said you almost killed yourself.

[26:54] Yeah it was kind of funny the escalera is not to be trifled with it's a great tool but you have to be careful and you have to maintain the balance point and I carried a Jurassic Park up the stairs with it by myself and had no issue and I kind of I was overconfident maybe.

[27:12] So the buyer went out to take the legs out to his car and I started going down the stairs and while Jersey Jack games are heavy as hell they're much heavier than Sterns and the balance point caught me off guard and it started tipping forward and it was kind of funny I was literally screaming help call on the guys name leaning back with all of my might trying to keep the thing from going down the stairs.

[27:32] Fortunately came back and bailed me out and it went out the door fine so be careful with the escalera folks it's an awesome tool but don't do it by yourself make sure you got somebody around.

[27:44] Right what was the Houston show like was it you've been to some other shows correct it was it big was it small was it like it just I was at a grand old time what it was it was on the smaller side the other paintball shows I've been to I've been to California extreme and I've been to T. P. F.

[28:00] And both of those were bigger shows than this so this was a smaller show right probably evenly split between pins and vids I would say.

[28:10] It's most of the games I think are supplied by people attending the show Marco had a booth of course and they had a bunch of Jurassic parks and a bunch of velvars.

[28:20] Why do you you know just going back quickly to the conversation around raza or the weekend.

[28:25] Why do you think there's so much cynicism on pinside before anyone's played this game do you think it's just some carryover from people's feelings on J pop or what were your thoughts because I'm reading this and I see you jumping in there deck I know you're very active on pinside and you sort of you always come to the defense of the game so what's happening.

[28:47] So okay I'll speak to that separately but what me coming to the defensive games but I think that I don't know okay mate some of it might be people that are burned and have residual J pop feelings that certainly a possibility I think there's just an overwhelming need for people to find something negative with games it's almost like people want to talk themselves out of needing it so they don't have to buy it and it's not just this game it's every new game they'll find something that they they nitpick on and say okay well it's terrible so like a bunch of people were like oh the ramps on make it.

[29:16] This game's terrible and so I had to close down ramp gate by showing some double flip or actually make the ramp.

[29:22] So I don't know I just it's disappointing to me because the reason I come to the defense of these things is that I mean it is a very difficult thing being a maker getting a thing from an idea to an actual physical thing that someone can buy.

[29:38] There's a million steps in between there and the million things that go wrong there's successes and there's heart breaks and there's frustrations and there's wins and it's a you know I always have respect for the folks who do that and get something out the other side even if it's not exactly what you wanted even if it doesn't if it's not what you envision I still find that there's things that can be appreciated about it and you know if it's not your thing that's cool but I don't feel the need to kind of crap on it.

[30:07] Right. You know I was what I was reading the comments and it does seem like if someone says you know I'm a great pinball player and I played it and I didn't like it which is just one opinion you know it gets like 40 up votes like people are really excited that someone didn't enjoy the game.

[30:23] And if you come on there and say hey I played it I really enjoyed it you'll get like maybe eight up votes so there's definitely a mob that does like to gravitate much more towards a negative assessment of someone who played the game versus a positive one.

[30:39] Fortunately I give no shit about a votes on Pinside. Right. Now what about so I'm just reading some of the feedback and people are saying like the animations weren't that great.

[30:50] Were there any animations or people just didn't see them like. No there were animations I'll go through some more of my video because I took a lot of videos I just haven't vetted them all and you know sometimes I want to make sure I'm not like capturing a private conversation or something that doesn't need to be broadcast.

[31:06] So I got to go through and I just cheated in my wife and now I can't wait to go on rise.

[31:10] Yeah I mean yeah you know I want to vet those things but anyway yes I thought the animations were good when you make the hill there's an animation for that and when you don't make the hill there's like a fail animation where the the cars going up the roller coaster and up getting lifted off by UFO.

[31:30] They were smooth too that was the thing it wasn't janky where it looked like it was flash animation like you know we've seen in some other games it was like it was smooth it was like.

[31:40] JP to win quality to me right.

[31:44] You know what it was I think what would adversely affect it people's response to some of these videos was someone put up a video to show that the ramp could be made.

[31:55] And the video had some dude hitting both flipers at the save time which is clearly the how you don't play pinball and so I think people responded to that being like can we get a video of some new nose what they're doing and and because of that everyone just sort of dismissed that video that the ramp could be hit because of you know clearly it was some new beat who jumped on the machine because you know how it is I'm pin side right there no one who's new is allowed to give any opinion everything has to come from the extra.

[32:24] Tornament players or else we throw it out.

[32:27] Well I had some really good games when I was playing it and threw up some decent scores but I can't video and play at the same time.

[32:35] And so when I grabbed I'm the one to grab the video of the double flip guy and I grabbed that because he and his friend that we're playing made the ramp a couple of times I'm like okay I'm just going to capture this so that I can show people that the ramp is not as bad as they're making it out to be I mean it's kind of amazing to me that off one two minute video people

[32:52] like that didn't have someone clearing the ramp they were all you know ramp gate in full effect right what we didn't talk about the way the game plunges.

[33:04] Right comes just like kick right out to the left.

[33:11] Yeah I'm looking at the pictures I as I recall it does not go through the orbit it just kind of comes out over on the right side of the play field if I remember correctly.

[33:19] I have to go back to the footage I thought it shoots I thought it shoots the ball left like it flies right to like a target to the left or.

[33:28] I'm looking now at the original artwork of zombie adventure land with the big Godzilla and the attack from Mars looking guy pretty cool pretty cool some obviously they had to remove some stuff because of IP infringement.

[33:42] I got a lot of being one of them.

[33:47] And one interesting thing about the shooter lane it's got a spring for the left edge of the shooter lane yeah what was that is it caused that to do anything that was my question I'm like is this just for fun like yeah it's just for fun.

[33:59] So it's it gets twang sometimes kind of vibrates in an interesting way because it's not a straight spring it's kind of it's got you know wide and narrow parts so it has kind of a shape to it.

[34:10] And when it vibrates it looks neat so I guess that's all it's about right.

[34:15] There's a lot going on in this game as the more I look at these photos it's it's so much more difficult when you look at a J pop game to understand.

[34:26] The madness that he throws on into these games but it's also why people do like the J pop games.

[34:32] But there could be played his older ones like theater of magic and tells the Caribbean nights and sure.

[34:39] And so in comparison to those because I want to give you my opinion that I want to hear what you think playing raza.

[34:45] I don't know if like this game like has the same level of cohesiveness in terms of like putting magical toys down within the theme that he's trying to convey in a way that like you understand like if I walk up to two tails of the Caribbean night I see the big genie I see the big lamp I see.

[35:04] You know there's that awesome disappearing mag then in front of the genie if you bash the genie it activates the genie multi ball.

[35:12] What what about this game does it does it have that sort of cohesiveness or does it I don't know does it feel a little random and sporadic when you're on it or in front of it.

[35:23] Well you're not wrong that there's a ton of stuff all over the play field and there's a lot of stuff to do that I haven't even like fully absorbed yet I mean for example the right orbit has some kind of bowling component to it where you can get strikes and I heard it you calling out strike spare things like that.

[35:38] So I don't even know what's going on with that whole aspect of the game yet.

[35:42] Right but the thing the main thing that pulls you in I know you're always looking for like what's a way to get started in the game I want to know what to do when I walk up on it and not be overwhelmed and I would say that they did nail that because the net target in the back is lit and flashing and it's like this is the guy you're trying to hit hit this guy.

[36:00] And so if you don't know anything about else about the game and I didn't when I rolled up on it that's the thing that draws you in and that starts you know progress right.

[36:09] I think the thing that's missing for me and I'll I'll just be blunt with this.

[36:14] The the trunk in theater of magic the disappearing magnet in front of the genie and the shooting star ball saves on tails of the Arabian nights the ring master in circus full tear right who pops up with the ball magnetized to his head.

[36:32] And I just don't see a meck that feels anywhere near as like wow as those things and it's all coming from the same designer so I'm just in my head I'm just wondering.

[36:47] I'm standing in front of amazing engineers at Valley Williams and just pull stuff off the shelf or they were able to figure out how to make his stuff really become impressive mechanisms I'm just not seeing that same level of wow in any of the stuff I'm not saying the game doesn't have a ton of cool toys because it seems like it does but you know I'm saying directly there's just not that thing right now that I see well sure you just named some of the greatest toys in pinball history absolutely period.

[37:17] But but isn't that but this is my whole point right if you're going to innovate and you're going to push pinball forward and you're going to come out and say like wait you see what deep room can do like wait you see like how we bring the imagination of John pop it to life i'm kind of like where is it.

[37:36] Well you know and where is the thing where is the you know what I'm saying where is the where is the ball where you know even like who Dean he has the ball shoots three feet into the back of the cat like where's the thing that just makes you go I guess that's my point right oh my god did you see what the ball just did that's always been my thing man now there might be right the ramp might do that but it can't be a ramp can't be the only thing.

[38:03] Yeah fair enough i mean you know i'm interested to see what they do next.

[38:09] And how this game turns out when it's finished i will say this my friend i am always i'm always i not always i just appreciate your positive optimistic feedback in the hobby because i think you balance out a lot of the negativity and even reading this thread i'm like watching you take a million arrows as you just try to be like hey i like pinball like.

[38:28] At all these pinball people are just trying to like crucify anyone who's having any enjoyment in the hobby.

[38:35] It's it's sad to me you know this this whole thing is supposed to be about having fun and you know if it's not fun go do something else there's plenty of other hobbies.

[38:46] Have you seen the guys at the shows come on.

[38:50] I could kid.

[38:51] Hey man you know it's the internet it really is the internet it is a dumpster fire cesspool of negativity and you just have to roll with it but Derek i want to thank you for taking your time to give us your feedback on retro atomic zombie adventure land.

[39:10] I don't think anyone else knows when we'll be able to hop on it next here's my here's my guess we're not going to see we should not see this game.

[39:17] And this is my advice for deeper we shouldn't see this game again until it's in the final deep route package right i don't think they're going to.

[39:26] To this thing around the country as it is what do you think.

[39:31] Yeah i think that this was done for a very specific purpose to you know gather data and i think they've done that and i you know i think you're right i would also keep it close to the vest until you're ready to do it.

[39:42] Proper reveal with the final package i think the data acquisition was a little bit spin you know what my guess is i think robber just needed to get his team to finish something like a hard ass deadline.

[39:55] To get that team to put to go pencils down.

[39:59] We need something playable done and ready to go out there for people to you know hop on and and they achieved it so whatever the reason was we might not know.

[40:09] The ultimate reason they got the game to the show and it didn't seem like it broke down a lot was it was it working the most of the time you were there.

[40:18] It was there were some glitches now and then which is to be expected at this stage the engineers were basically watching people play and if something went wrong they addressed it right away got you.

[40:29] It was the glass in it non reflective glass or was it just a standard glass i think it was extremely reflective glass i think i would call it vis a glass.

[40:39] God come on i need to i need to i don't know i don't know why companies like show stuff without the best possible glass available anyway well they didn't know the lighting situation they were going to be in at the show i'm sure either so.

[40:55] Yeah well here's my thing too is nobody said that deeper to show it on the floor like in that scenario like i'm always like look if you can launch your company and you can launch your game anyway you want right so imagine the show is that is there.

[41:09] Is it part of was the part of a hotel or was a convention center like where was it at is a convention center attached to a hotel okay well deep read easily could have had a hotel suite all a Dutch pinball and had people up in a room and had a little bit more of an intimate better lighting better i you know i would add mystique and curiosity and.

[41:28] One person comes into a dark room at a time that's all black lit and there's your zombie retro atomic like you know prototype testing experience because ultimately i do think it's only die hard pinball fanatics that are aware of deep route and are considering these john pop it you titles because outside of that audience nobody cares about j pop or.

[41:51] Another game or you know or zidware games coming to fruition there's no there's no demand for that in the real world.

[41:58] Yeah i mean that's fair okay right normal stone don't you pinball the same way we do like will you want comes with millions of fans right star wars millions of fans Jurassic Park millions of fans retro atomic zombie adventure land maybe a few hundred fans you know and i mean that like a few hundred.

[42:19] Those other i'd piece have millions of people that are that could be potential buyers right so so you're right and you talk a lot about how theme is critical and you know there's definitely a component of that theme helps some machines no question.

[42:36] But if you look some of the greatest games in pinball history were not themed games did or magic wasn't themed tails the Ravens nights wasn't themed yeah but there's a big difference there's the big difference this is like this and you're right.

[42:48] But go back and look at the total volume of sales for those games and they were crappy compared to themed pinball machines items family sold twenty thousand twenty thousand i think circus Voltaire sold like twelve hundred.

[43:09] And they couldn't even give them away this is the best part if you really made there was a point in this hobby where there was just like circus Voltaire's in boxes that nobody wanted that were the people were just like buying them for like fifteen hundred bucks off of like distributors back in the day they couldn't even unload them now.

[43:25] You know it's weird is Jay pops game games took on more prominence after after they were commercial failures back in the arcade day they were not that popular back then.

[43:37] So you know that's interesting because you know in the arcade hobby the same thing holds true some of the games that are most sought after by collectors now were complete does during the what they want them for example.

[43:49] Yeah major have it right major have it arcade game sells for like eight ten thousand here's a thing it's only valuable because it's rare major have it as a game socks compared to Donkey Kong miss Pac-Man terrible.

[44:01] And I think quantum does to mean people who love it will disagree with me but you know they they stunk for a reason yeah but I think but just but you are right though like medieval madness attack from ours and theater of magic and tells the Ruby and nights like these games get ranked in the top twenty pinball machines of all time because they also are stellar games.

[44:20] That are incredible to flip and are amazing worlds under glass so I do agree with you all I'm saying is it's twenty nineteen.

[44:28] And if you have a new game coming out and we already can buy all of those old games right and there's all these new companies pushing pinball forward I think it's an incredible time to be a buyer because our expectations are so high right now that if you don't bring out something that just blows people away I think almost everything that's just mediocre will be met with sort of just like shoulder shrugging underwhelming responses from the community.

[44:57] Which is great because it means that developers and manufacturers have to do more to get our money and our attention what do you think.

[45:04] I think you're right um you know what the games being in homes now people are looking for more I think you've got a good point yeah because you want to own it for a really long time it's different when I'm just taking twenty bucks to go pop into a barcade and then you know just if I just want to have a little bit of fun that's cool if I want to own it for like seven and nine to fifteen thousand dollars.

[45:26] It better like wow me I think we I think you're going to grease with that I think so I agree and yeah go I like the games that have the deeper rule sets that give you things to work for over time and so that you don't kind of have a shallow experience yes you can't own a game with a shallow rule set you can you you just can't well you can for a small period of time well only if you have a big collection that also has deep rule set games you need to have the balance.

[45:52] Yeah yeah well dark thank you for taking the time thank you for being on the ground correspondent at Houston I appreciate it always always a pleasure to have you on I hope you get your willy wonka CE in a couple weeks and we will have you back on to talk about what your CE experiences when you get it has that sound.

[46:10] That sounds great look forward to it awesome brother have a good day you too.

[46:21] Not me.
