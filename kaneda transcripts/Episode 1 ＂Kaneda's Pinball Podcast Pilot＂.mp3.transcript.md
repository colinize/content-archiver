[00:00] Kanita, you've always been a pain in the ass, you know.

[00:05] You've been telling me what to do since we were kids.

[00:07] You always treat me like a kid.

[00:10] You always show up and start bossing me around.

[00:13] And don't you deny it!

[00:15] Because you know what the fuck you are!

[00:31] Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words.

[00:37] With great power, comes great responsibility.

[00:41] This is my gift, my curse.

[00:46] Who am I?

[00:48] I'm Spider-Man.

[00:52] Welcome to episode one of Kanita's Pinball Podcast, coming to you from New York City.

[00:57] This is it, the moment that nobody has waited for.

[01:01] If I have to use a pinball now, this is kind of like having a fourth flipper on the habit.

[01:07] There's no need for it, right?

[01:09] But let's just do it anyway.

[01:13] So I want to talk about real quickly why this podcast exists.

[01:21] And you know, it really is because there is a community out there that is filled with the most passionate people I've ever seen in any community.

[01:32] And I've been a member of a variety of communities online.

[01:37] And you know, everything from cars to music to video games to arcade games.

[01:43] And easily, easily without a doubt.

[01:47] The kind of conversation and kind of passion that takes place on pinside is unparalleled.

[01:55] It is incredible the amount of volume and the amount of emotion and the amount of thoughtfulness that goes into the conversation there.

[02:06] And it's over pinball, which is incredible as well.

[02:11] And the point of this podcast is to extend the conversation that is taking place there.

[02:19] And I really hope to make this podcast something that becomes a continued dialogue.

[02:25] And I don't want it to just be me rambling with my opinions about things, which you will get a fair share of.

[02:31] But I hope to give an opinion and a point of view that is a little bit different than what I noticed in some of the other pinball.

[02:40] And I think that is a little bit more of a podcast that are out there.

[02:45] Some of you might think that it's completely uninformed and it's just supposition and it's just me ranting.

[02:54] But I don't think it will be.

[02:57] And I think the online persona that is out there is, you know, is a little over dramatic.

[03:06] And I hope that the media is in the emotion and the immediacy of which we respond on the inside.

[03:13] And so I hope this conversation and I hope what we talk about on this podcast is presented in a little bit of a different manner.

[03:21] But we're not going to hold punches either.

[03:24] You know, we're not sponsored by anyone.

[03:27] We probably never will be.

[03:29] And that's fine.

[03:31] The thing I want to do is sort of take the hot topics that are going on in Pinside and just discuss them.

[03:40] And I really want some of the users and, you know, all of the users actually who participate on Pinside to feel that they can have a dialogue on this podcast.

[03:51] And I hope to have people come on to the show and talk about the same things that we talk about on Pinside and share their opinions and their points of view.

[04:01] Because that will make this much more interesting and I want to get people formed to do that.

[04:06] You know, I really, when I listen to a lot of podcasts out there, I mean, I love Coast to Coast.

[04:12] I love the Pinball podcast, Coinbox podcast.

[04:17] And you know, there's a few others I listen to, Spooky's podcast.

[04:21] And they're all great and they're all very informative.

[04:25] They don't talk very much about the way the conversations take place on Pinside.

[04:32] And I think there are probably reasons for that because the conversations do get very heated, very dramatic.

[04:39] Not all them, right? Not all them.

[04:41] But let's be honest, the ones that are on fire usually have some sort of tension that is keeping people active in those threads.

[04:50] So I want to discuss those threads and discuss, you know, what's going on in them and the different points of view that are taking place.

[04:56] But I really want you guys out there and you women out there who want to share your opinion about it to join the conversation.

[05:03] And that's it. That's it.

[05:05] So without further ado, let's jump into the first topic that has been really getting a lot of people riled up.

[05:17] And that is Spider-Man Vault Edition.

[05:23] So Stern showcases at CES the new Spider-Man.

[05:29] And I think, look, everyone agrees it looks great.

[05:33] It really, it looks amazing.

[05:35] I mean, if you have an older Spider-Man, you can't deny that this is the one you'd want to look at.

[05:43] And this is the one you'd want to own.

[05:45] And this is the one you'd ultimately want to have in your collection.

[05:49] I mean, it looks phenomenal.

[05:51] And there's really not a lot of people disagreeing on that.

[05:55] I know there's been a lot of people sharing other Spider-Man comic book art that they would have preferred.

[06:03] And I need to just say, guys, just realize the realities of licensing that when you want to go to Marvel and you want to use Spider-Man comic book art,

[06:15] they're not going to want to go back to art that's decades old.

[06:19] I don't even understand why people do that.

[06:23] And some of the stuff, look, there have been versions of Spider-Man artwork that have been really nice.

[06:29] But some of the old stuff people are putting up as being like, oh, this would look great.

[06:33] I mean, and some of the original Spider-Man art would look freaking terrible.

[06:37] Like, it would look so terrible.

[06:39] Try to cover a pen in really, really old comic book art style.

[06:44] And tell me that would look good on a modern Stern or a Stern-like Spider-Man.

[06:50] I just don't think it would look great.

[06:53] So we have to accept the fact that we're going to get whatever the new sort of Marvel look for Spider-Man is.

[07:01] And that's what the ultimate Spider-Man, this sort of teenage, lanky-looking Spider-Man, you know, whatever it is what it is.

[07:12] It still looks great.

[07:14] You can't deny that it looks much, much better.

[07:18] And the new toys, the new sculpts of the toys look incredible as well.

[07:23] So they did a great job.

[07:25] And like, no one doesn't want to accept this pen as being, you know, the Spider-Man to have.

[07:32] But then there's the elephant in the room is the price.

[07:35] And I mean, I just, I don't know what people thought this game was going to cost.

[07:41] Right? The people who say this should cost as much as Iron Man VE.

[07:47] It's like, just stop.

[07:50] I mean, Iron Man VE was a photocopy of Iron Man basically.

[07:55] Sure, they updated a few things on it.

[07:58] Well, I think they made the art better.

[08:00] But they didn't do much, guys.

[08:03] And when you look at what went into Spider-Man, Vault Edition,

[08:10] you know, it definitely should be more than Iron Man.

[08:14] But should it cost what they're charging?

[08:18] What around $7,500 people are saying they can get it probably from a distributor around $6,600.

[08:26] Okay. So the cost of a premium.

[08:31] I don't know what to think of that price.

[08:38] I really don't.

[08:41] On one level, I think it's too much.

[08:44] Right? We look at it and we're just annoyed that price is keeping creeping up.

[08:49] And look, we're going to talk a lot about price and value.

[08:53] And, you know, where is it all going?

[08:57] But the reality is, it's so hard to look at this thing objectively

[09:05] because there's so many other pins coming out.

[09:09] There's even the used version or home use only version of the old Spider-Man game

[09:13] that may have been used to set the price for this one.

[09:17] So you want a new and box Spider-Man and, you know, around $6,600, is going to get you one.

[09:23] And it's a great game and the code is pretty much finished, which, you know, is finished.

[09:28] Is that a ripoff?

[09:31] And so on this show, what I want to do is I want to compare like where dollars can go a little bit.

[09:36] And I think we do that a lot on the threads.

[09:38] And when I look at Spider-Man, VE and I see $6,600 bucks versus a spooky rob zombie for $6,000, right?

[09:55] I don't know, you know, given all of the exclusivity issues with rob zombie, the uniqueness of the theme, it's brand new, it's not a rehash.

[10:08] You know, I don't, I don't, you know, $6,600 for what Stern put into it doesn't seem so bad to me.

[10:18] But, you know, people freaked out.

[10:21] And I think people's freakouts though really, really started to just become ridiculous.

[10:26] I think someone put up a poll that asked if the price kept you away from it.

[10:33] And I think at the bottom of that poll was something along the lines of like 33% of people were like, no, I'm not even in on it.

[10:39] I just wanted to bitch about the price.

[10:43] And I really think that the majority of people who are just losing their shit over it were never even in on it.

[10:54] And so here's the good news.

[11:00] If you want to tell Stern that you think Spider-Man Vault Edition is too much money, just don't buy it.

[11:07] You know, I saw some group form that was trying to create like a group, a group purchase of it to lower the price to which I started a thread that wanted to start a group to actually pay more than MSRP to stick it to Stern and how dare they tell us how much money we can spend will tell them that thread was closed down.

[11:32] But look, I think the new reality is that $6,000, $7,000 is almost what we're going to be paying now for anything coming out of Stern.

[11:47] That's new. That has great features.

[11:51] And there's nothing else we can do about it other than not buy it.

[11:55] And speak with your wallets. Don't get it if you don't want to.

[12:00] Now, look, there's really nothing that all the back and forth about price will do other than get people riled up.

[12:20] You know, people are saying stuff too that's like, at six I'm in and it's $650 I'm out.

[12:27] And you know, I, you know, oric oric loss and he's doing the art for alien who people think that, you know, I'm always picking a fight with or kissing up to.

[12:40] Not true.

[12:42] I do find it funny that he's ignoring me, but we'll talk about that at another time.

[12:47] But look, these lines people are drawing in the sand, these, these lines of all, I'll pay this, but I won't pay this.

[12:56] That is also kind of getting like ridiculous. I mean, look, does everyone have their price?

[13:03] Oric said his is $6,000 on it.

[13:08] Okay. So if you can get one for $6500, you're not going to get one if you really want it.

[13:13] I think a lot of us, and if we're honest, we do set a price or we like to use price as an excuse to get out of something.

[13:23] I think most people want to feel or want to believe that every new pin that comes out is a pin that they're considering purchasing.

[13:35] Right. Unless the theme is so like out there that you just can't stand it, we're all somewhat in on a new pin.

[13:45] And we want to be considering it.

[13:48] And then the reality hits is that these are really, really expensive toys.

[13:54] And you just can't, you know, on a whim go buy one unless you really are in love with it.

[14:02] And that is why Spider-Man brings out so much passion and emotion and drama.

[14:09] That is why Game of Thrones did the same thing when the art got revealed.

[14:13] We really want, I think we're always searching and we're always hoping that each pin is going to check every box.

[14:24] And make us feel overly compelled to either get it or just really want it or want it down the road based upon what we're seeing.

[14:36] And I think what's been frustrating for people recently is that things have been halfway there on the new releases.

[14:47] Let's talk about that for a second because I don't think I saw a pin that had more anticipation than Game of Thrones.

[14:56] And segwaying into Game of Thrones right now.

[15:01] Let's talk about that for a minute.

[15:04] Game of Thrones we all heard was being worked on for two years.

[15:08] We were going to develop this pin for two years and there was so much anticipation of it and excitement for it because Stern knew.

[15:18] Stern knew that the Hobbit was coming out.

[15:23] They saw all the feedback Jack was getting on Hobbit and how disappointed people were and the dragon and its functionality and its lack of interaction with the ball.

[15:35] They saw the feedback to the art, to the shots, everything.

[15:40] Different themes but within the same realm of categorical realm of fantasy.

[15:49] And so Stern had two years to make it and when the game was finally released what happened right?

[15:57] I mean look they were renders we all flipped out the art was like what is this like what is this and look we were right like people were right.

[16:07] It didn't move us it didn't it didn't didn't feel like a great integration of the theme now like I'm not going to beat that dead horse anymore than it has been beat in already.

[16:17] Game of Thrones comes out it ships and people love it.

[16:21] I mean it's it's a great game like it has great flow it has great code you know the code is really far along I'll still say this.

[16:33] I want someone to prove me wrong and I want to play it more but I went to modern pinball and I played game of thrones pro for an hour straight.

[16:44] And I think the game flows brilliantly I love the feeling of the shots going around that pen and it has great flow.

[16:57] But I can't get into the integration of the theme in the pen I just don't feel like I'm in the game of thrones world at all at all.

[17:08] And as you progress within the game the light shows while spectacular and they're great like there's lights going everywhere and it's bright and it's it's really.

[17:23] You know exciting to see it I just don't feel like I'm part of game of thrones universe when I play that.

[17:32] And I want to feel more like I'm stepping into the world that is in the show and that's in our imaginations and I just don't.

[17:44] And that's not to say that pins not fun and above all right pinball needs to be fun needs to have us wanting to come back and play more so.

[17:55] You know it's been a little bit of a you know sort of like a disappointing year in 2015 for I mean besides all the other obvious reasons I think the new pins have all.

[18:12] Excited us to a certain point and there's always that one thing that one flaw that keeps us scratching our heads a little bit about whether or not like it's a classic or whether or not it's worth getting or whether or not it's worth owning.

[18:30] And you know there's just been all those little things it's like you know when you you know when you've like dated like really awesome people and every future person you date you you you you find the flaws so much faster like you can you just get right to it and you either like live with it or you see if there's a way to like fix it.

[18:59] You know and we all have flaws and and what not but you know what I'm saying like and that's what it's been like and you know whether it's the ball draining out of the walking dead from the bumpers like I you know I played that game too at modern and the ball still just goes right down the middle and and and someone on pins I was like well you feel like I'm a nudge it I don't want to spend thousands of dollars and have to like nudge something to fix a design flaw.

[19:28] If that's the case so you know we're all searching for the pin that is just got everything right and look I think for the money we're spending we all should have that expectation like if you want to charge us

[19:44] to charge us stern if you want to charge us $4,000 I think people can overlook a lot and I think they would I think if spider-man vault edition is $4,000 $5,000 nobody complains about the style of comic book art nobody complains about anything really I think you have nothing but orders rolling in but once you start charging where games are going now we have to look at them differently

[20:13] and we expect at this price range games to be well well thought out I don't want to have to spend additional money to make it good

[20:28] and that's the new reality so let's talk about another pin that is coming out it's all over the place and it is and in listener like I'm just going through like the broad strokes of this stuff we're talking about

[20:50] but there's another pin that's coming out and there's been a lot of discussion about it and you know I think this company out of all the companies deserves the respect they get they get looked at differently and they get judged differently

[21:12] but they're still selling an expensive toy that we're buying and that is spooky pinball and it is really amazing what Charlie and Ben and company have done not just from being the only boutique to have really done it and shipped games to people which is incredible

[21:36] and they will forever be held in high esteem for doing that especially in a year where a lot of people lost their hard earned money on some scams and we'll talk more about those at another date but you know spooky pinball did it and America's most honoured shipped and you know 150 will be in homes or out for people to play

[22:05] and you know so it's great and it's great that there is an alternative and rob zombie is revealed and you know the the pin has a real unique approach and it's it's definitely going to be a pin that's not like anything coming from stern which is a good thing

[22:28] it's I love the fact that it's going to you know be mature and have in a very R rated theme and and really stand out like you're going to you're going to play rob zombie and you're not going to find another pin in people's row that plays like it that sounds like it that you know probably provides the you know it's like going into in an R rated movie that's a lot of fun

[22:57] when everything else is PG for the most part so I think it's going to be really cool I look and look it doesn't matter anything I say up to this point is is here say is is moot is pointless because they've sold everyone right and I've heard that argument before like because they've sold everyone we can't like talk about it

[23:14] but I'll say this shortly and we'll go into to this pen you know as as more is revealed and as stuff happens with it but you know spooky gets the pass they get a pass and they get looked at much differently than everybody else

[23:28] I'm going to say everybody else you know talking probably JJP and and stern simply because we were we admire what Charlie's done so he reveals rob zombie and you know the it's interesting when you see that threat if you just read it from beginning to end it really captures

[23:50] this is the most pin inside in general but it's flipped between spooky and stern they they they both reveal and get totally different responses the typical response for stern is bitch bitch bitch bitch

[24:06] moan moan moan moan moan oh my god this is a greatest game ever oh my god I can't wait to buy it oh my god I got one you know it that's like what happens now stern it's like we're we're so upset by everything for the most part when they reveal something how dare they how dare they do this how dare they do that in three months that pin is in people's homes and they're loving it and then everyone is on board

[24:30] spooky with rob zombie they had a little bit of a different right a different thing happened I think the initial response was super positive across the board super positive and like a day later you know people started to like notice things and talk about them a little bit more objective way

[24:54] I think the main issue was probably the play field art and again I'm not going to rehash all of it it was different and looked more barren than people are used to in play field art the inserts I didn't look like they were integrated into the art I know they're still working on it and I've been critical of it I do think that you know when you look at the art on it it shows me one thing it shows me one thing it's not going to be a real game

[25:23] it shows me one thing it and this has been said but these guys are engineers they know it build Pimmel machines I don't think there's like a creative director that is working on this stuff that can direct the artist to do what needs to be done to populate a play field in the best possible way

[25:47] and that's one of the mistakes that I think spooky is continuing to make and look I love spooky but again on this podcast I'm going to say things that I don't think you're going to hear another podcast and I think there's these are things that are probably on a lot of our minds but they just should be said I think Charlie wants to make the pin that he wants to make and that's great

[26:15] but I think there are times where he doesn't understand his limitations in a certain aspect of the game itself and I think play field design is one of them and I think art is just one of them I don't think him or Ben are artists and I think it shows and I think that they'd be better off admitting that and bringing on a creative director or an artist to help with the process

[26:44] now I look I think what they did with with Rob Zombie was I think they threw a decent amount of money to a great artist to design a beautiful cabinet art and you know the game looks great but the art doesn't sync up and that's a problem that you know again we just have to accept it it's going to be the way it's going to be

[27:10] but man I don't think I've seen artwork that had the potential to be great all over the game you know not just the cabinet not just the translate the plastics the play field the upper play field it just it doesn't sync up but again

[27:31] can you shut up like you're beating a dead horse every game sold they can do whatever they want they're going to make the game they want to make who are you to say this yeah you like totally fair but again I think we all want a game once we're spending $6,000 plus

[27:52] to have everything done as good as possible right and I've said this before in the thread Charlie got a lot of really good feedback from the community after the reveal

[28:08] wouldn't people rather wait let's say wait three months for production the start to fix some of the things that could be fixed

[28:24] that's all and I think you know for a company that listens so much to the people and takes their feedback why not do that why not take the time to get it right I saw someone posted a picture

[28:39] where they took the Ellie back glass art and put it on the play field and it looked phenomenal and they put the art over the plastics and it looked great

[28:50] all those assets are there and that's the thing that kills me with with this whole thing of just like whatever we're not going to do it

[28:57] Charlie has the assets he now just needs someone like an oric or creative designer to come in and lay it out in a way that could be different

[29:06] without maybe having to move any insert or change any of like the white wood the art could be improved

[29:14] but I look I don't think they're going to do it I think that it's a it's a slippery slope

[29:22] revealing something to the community and then allowing them to make the changes right I just I see both sides of the argument

[29:32] everyone's taking credit for making the hobbit better but like crap here we are 2016 hobbits still not out I mean great

[29:41] we we we improved a game and deleted and definitely it seems but now I mean not indefinitely but you know like jacks issues with the hobbit shipping I don't even want to talk about that on this episode but the you know the reality is we want our games to be as good as possible

[30:02] and I don't think that's asking too much I you know I think that the days of getting fleeced and and and and paying and then having to spend a lot of money upgrading pens is kind of getting ridiculous I think that

[30:23] pens need to start coming from the factory at this price with stuff installed that wants the price so let me you know let me say that if you're charging premium prices and you know I want to be

[30:42] you'll see where the money's going but look we all we all see what's happening and it's not good it's not good that in Ellie can come out and be like $1,500 more than the premium with marginal differences

[31:02] and price is something I said we'll talk a lot about it because it's it's really you know the obstacle between a pen and a collector is how much is it

[31:20] that some guys like you know we'll talk about this another episode and and sorry guys I'll have more like an agenda in the episode I know this one might seem like I'm just sort of

[31:33] rambling a little bit but this is just number one I'm sort of testing it and out but I you know just want to try and see how we do this even just how the equipment works this episode so you know this the whole thing with price and

[31:50] and I don't know if we're going to see it get better before it gets it gets worse and I see prices going up and up and up and up and look I'm fine with a variety of pricing just give us the value in it to something different

[32:06] and you know Rob Zombie being limited and being a different pen and being unique theme $6,000 no wonder it sold out as fast as it did no wonder I don't know how fast spider man V will sell I don't know if

[32:26] you'll ever learn how many they sell but it's going to be interesting it's going to be interesting you know I don't think anyone who owns a spider man currently is going to really trade up and and pay that extra amount but again I don't think the game was was meant for them.

[32:45] So here we are it's January 2016 and you know it's going to be one hell of a year and I want it I want to end this episode I'm going to keep it short I don't want to make you guys so upset and go on and on and on and I want to again this is just meant this sort of like episode you know it's like a beta episode I'm just really figuring out my way here.

[33:15] So I want to say this and I started a threat about this and I think we all should be super excited about 2016 and I'll tell you why because I think we are going to see more new inbox pens ship in this year than we have in the last 20 years.

[33:35] I'm like in my head counting back 20 years ago was what 1996 well maybe not 20 years maybe 15 years okay.

[33:43] When Stern was you know shipping stuff in the early 2000s how many were they coming out with a year right who else was shipping then not much right.

[33:58] In the first six months I put up a thread that there could be eight pins that start shipping and let's let's let me let me try and count them again I don't have notes is going to be the sloppiest podcast I do.

[34:17] But we have the big Lebowski if you think that will ship I think if they don't ship in the first six months of 2016 I mean I think they're in trouble I think people are going to just be fed up I think they already are but I think it will I think there's been progress there and I think they know they need to get stuff out.

[34:44] The Hobbit you know it's like it's just funny saying these titles as they all should have been in people's living rooms and basements and in game rooms by now but the hobbits on the line would ever line that is you know is it a smoking mirrors line by Jack to get people to shut up and wait a little bit longer who knows they're making what six

[35:12] hobbits right now to be tested out but I mean I see parts apparently piling up I don't know I think it's got a ship in the first six months of the year you know Jack goes longer than that God forbid we even get towards near expo date without hobbit out I think he'll be kidnapped at the show.

[35:37] I'm I said to we have you know game of thorns premium I know it's not new pin but it is a newer version of the franchise and look it's for sale it these are like I have money I want to buy new box pin what's new so we've that we have spider man VE right that's for.

[35:58] We have.

[36:00] Alien which again.

[36:03] I you know I hope this ships.

[36:08] In the first six months of 2016 I'm not.

[36:12] That confident and will when I read the thread and we'll talk more about this pin.

[36:19] Coming up because it's going to be the hoppin this week as the reveal happens I you know.

[36:25] It sounds like whitewood is done and sounds like the play field arts been approved but it still seems like there's work to be done.

[36:33] And they want to get it right so I don't know we all know that.

[36:39] It takes a lot of work to do the last like 20% of making a game the last 20% could be like.

[36:48] Six months to a year to get it right I'm so there's alien.

[36:52] You know what am I missing here.

[36:57] Oh I'm not even like.

[37:01] Well I'll just say it but Ghostbusters right.

[37:07] Is that the next one from Stern that's going to finally get the LCD screen in that we're hearing.

[37:14] So you got Ghostbusters.

[37:15] You know then we have P3 is that going to happen.

[37:23] They say they're closing in on the finish line.

[37:28] So I don't know if that's six seven I don't think that was eight.

[37:33] But there's just a lot shipping.

[37:39] And oh Rob Zombie right.

[37:42] So it's it's it's going to be a credit marketplace.

[37:50] And I love it because this competition is going to it's going to force people to give you more.

[37:59] I mean let's face it if it wasn't for competitors like Stern would just be sticking with red dots for now until the end of time.

[38:08] You have no other option.

[38:11] Right so that being said I think this year is going to be a year where we finally put behind us a lot of the pain of 2015.

[38:21] And we move on from some of the charlatans that that rob people and you look those people are still going to be fighting to get something back.

[38:32] But I think we're going to start to see a lot more new inbox pins shipping.

[38:37] I think we're going to continue to have the price discussion.

[38:43] And I think you know there's room for all these new pins.

[38:50] And it just makes 2016 out to be one of the greatest in the world.

[39:02] So let's see what happens.

[39:06] I thank you for listening.

[39:09] I'm going to set up a Gmail for feedback.

[39:14] In fact I'll just tell you what it is because I doubt anybody has it.

[39:18] I probably should have done it first.

[39:20] But it's going to be canada pinball at gmail.com.

[39:26] So hit me up.

[39:27] I'd love to get you guys on this and talk with you guys and record it and have the conversation back and forth.

[39:38] Be what this podcast becomes.

[39:42] And other than that I look forward to the next episode.

[39:46] And the goal here is to have these episodes come up pretty frequently as conversations develop.

[39:52] And we'll be more focused in the future.

[39:56] There'll be more agenda.
