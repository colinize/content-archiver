[16:07] And I can breathe in a small town

[16:11] Gonna get out of here in a small town

[17:02] Picture in my head and say

[17:04] If you see this girl can you tell I where I am

[17:08] Some try to hand me money but they don't understand

[17:13] I'm not broke I'm just a broken-hearted man

[17:18] I know it makes no sense

[17:20] What else can I do?

[17:23] And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

[17:27] Cause if one day you wake up and run and you're missing me

[17:32] And your heart's faster and wonder where I'm stuck I can be

[17:37] Think and maybe you'll come back here doing a place that could be me

[17:42] And you'll see me waiting for you

[17:44] On the corner of the street

[17:46] So I'm not in the fair

[17:50] I'm not moving

[17:56] At least message on you

[18:09] Yes they hear it like I said

[18:12] So what I waiting for is a day and money

[18:16] Got to stand my ground even if the rain's all snow

[18:21] She changes her mind

[18:23] This is the first place she will go

[18:25] Cause if one day you wake up and run and you're missing me

[18:30] And your heart's faster and wonder where I'm stuck I can be

[18:35] Think and maybe you'll come back here doing a place that could be me

[18:40] And you'll see me waiting for you

[18:42] On the corner of the street

[18:44] So I'm not in the fair

[18:48] I'm not moving

[18:53] I'm not moving

[18:57] I'm not moving

[19:03] People talk about the guy

[19:07] He's waiting on the car

[19:11] Oh, there are no holes in his shoes

[19:17] But a big hole in his blood

[19:20] Maybe I can't face

[19:25] Cause the man who can't be moved

[19:28] And maybe you won't need to

[19:30] But you'll see me on the nose

[19:32] And you'll run into the corner

[19:36] Cause you'll know it's your story

[19:40] And the man who can't be moved

[19:44] And the man who can't be moved

[19:47] Cause if one day you wake up and run and you're missing me

[20:17] I'm not moving

[20:21] I'm not moving

[20:25] I'm not moving

[20:29] I'm not moving

[20:33] I'm not moving

[20:37] We touch, I feel a rush

[20:40] We clutch, it isn't much

[20:42] But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us

[20:44] It's lust, it's torturous, you must be insorcerous

[20:47] Cause you just did the impossible

[20:49] Game I trust, don't play games, it'll be dangerous

[20:52] If you fuck me over

[20:53] Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt

[20:56] Cause I've been treated like dirt

[20:58] Before your in love is evil, spell it back what I'll show you

[21:01] Nobody knows me I'm cold

[21:03] Walk down this road all along

[21:05] It's no one's fault for my own

[21:07] It's the path I'm chosen to go

[21:08] It froze in this snow

[21:09] I saw no emotion, but so ever so

[21:11] Don't ask me why I have no love

[21:13] 20s love fucking hoes

[21:15] Bloodsuck in soft gibices

[21:16] What the fuck is soft?

[21:17] But this I've tried in this department

[21:19] But I ain't had no love

[21:21] With this it sucks

[21:22] But it's exactly what I thought it would be like

[21:24] Try to start over

[21:25] I got a hole in my heart

[21:26] What some kind of emotion or rollercoaster

[21:28] Something I won't go on to

[21:29] You toy with my emotion

[21:31] Toes over, it's like an explosion

[21:33] Every time I hold it, I wasn't joking

[21:34] When I told you, you take my breath away

[21:36] You're a supernova

[21:38] I was faced by a rocket ship and now I'm still blue

[21:43] Can I maybe let it hurt you?

[21:47] Let it hurt you

[21:51] Two hundred thousand miles I'm a kid I need to do

[21:56] Can I maybe let it hurt you?

[22:01] Let it hurt you?

[22:05] Let it hurt you

[22:12] I do whatever it takes

[22:14] Well I'm with you I get the shakes

[22:16] My body aches when I eat

[22:17] With you I have zero strength

[22:19] There's no limit on how far I would go

[22:21] No pounds, there's no legs

[22:22] Why do we say that until we get that person that we think?

[22:26] Gonna be that one and then once we get them

[22:28] It's never the same

[22:29] You wanna win they don't want you soon

[22:31] And stay do feelings changed

[22:32] It's not a contestant I ain't got no conquest but no mate

[22:36] I wasn't looking when I stole a launching

[22:38] You must have been fake but so much is the state

[22:40] What the fuck does it take?

[22:41] Let's cut to the chase for the door shots and your face

[22:44] Promise me if I cave in and break your name

[22:46] I stop open that I won't be making a mistake

[22:49] It's almost face by a rocket ship and now I'm still blue

[22:54] Can I maybe let it hurt you?

[22:59] I'll let you

[23:02] 200,000,000 pounds on a clear diet in June

[23:08] And I'll maybe let it hurt you

[23:12] I'll let you

[23:16] I'll let you

[23:23] So after a year and six months

[23:25] No longer me that you want

[23:27] I love you so much it hurts

[23:29] Never mistreated you once

[23:30] I pour my whole life to you

[23:32] Let down my cards with a guard

[23:34] I blow my brains in your lap

[23:36] Lay here and tie in your arms

[23:37] Rocks in my knees and I'm bleeding

[23:39] I'm trying to stop you from leaving

[23:41] You won't even listen so fucking

[23:42] I'm trying to stop you from breathing

[23:44] I put both hands on your throat

[23:46] I sit on top of you squeezing

[23:47] So I snap your neck like a popsicle

[23:49] Sticking a possible reason

[23:51] I can take up to let you walk up up this house

[23:53] And let you live

[23:54] Just drink down both of my cheeks

[23:56] Now let you go and just give it

[23:58] Before I put that gun to my temple I told you this

[24:00] And I will do anything for you

[24:04] To show you how much I told you

[24:07] But over now it's too late to say

[24:11] Oh, love, just promise me you'll think of me

[24:15] Every time you look up in the sky

[24:17] And see you start as I'm lost

[24:19] And when the shipping line's turned blue

[24:22] Then I'll be the right to you

[24:27] Right to you

[24:30] I get up around seven

[24:33] Get out of bed around nine

[24:35] And I don't worry about nothing though

[24:37] Because one's a waste of time

[24:49] The oldest one starts around seven

[24:51] We go out day to round nine

[24:53] Get on the bus about eleven

[24:55] Sip in a drain and feel it by

[24:57] We've been dancing with Mr. Brown's song

[25:03] He's been longing

[25:05] He won't leave me alone

[25:09] Now, now, now, now, now

[25:29] I just keep trying to get a little better

[25:31] Said a little better than before

[25:33] We've been dancing with Mr. Brown's song

[25:39] He's been longing

[25:41] He won't leave me alone

[25:47] Now, now, now, now

[25:49] Give up and give me a love

[26:17] Give up and give me a love

[26:31] Now, I did up for eleven ever

[26:35] But that old man, he's a real mother

[26:37] But I'm gonna take him all down the line

[26:40] I used to do a little bit over a little bit

[26:41] And it was sort of a little guy, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma

[26:44] I just keep trying to get a little better

[26:46] Said a little better than before

[26:57] We've been dancing with Mr. Brown's song

[27:02] He's been longing

[27:05] He won't leave me alone

[27:09] I'll leave it alone, oh, no, no, no, no.

[27:12] Oh, it won't give me a load.

[27:14] I'll leave it alone, oh, wait.

[27:22] It's stuck in in the middle, and I shot it in the middle.

[27:28] It drove me out of my mind.

[27:29] I'll shoot the noise, and I'll shoot the noise, and I'll shoot the noise, and I'll shoot the noise, and I'll leave it alone.

[27:34] I need...

[27:37] I had a heart and I was a fake face far where, back in high school

[27:48] He could feel that street ball flying, make you look like a fool boy

[27:57] Saw me the other night at this roadside bar, I was walking in, he was walking out

[28:05] We went back inside sat down at a few drinks but all we kept talking about is for a day

[28:15] We went past you by glory days and the work of the young girls by glory days for a day

[28:27] But there's a girl that lives up the block, back in school she could turn on her boys heads

[28:37] Sometimes on a Friday I stopped by and had a few drinks, after she put her kiss to bed

[28:46] Her nurse took Bobby, well they split up, I guess it's two years gone by now

[28:54] We just sit around talking about the old times, she says when she feels like crying she starts laughing

[29:01] Find your mouth, hurry days, yeah they'll pass you by glory days and the one who really am goes by glory days for a day

[29:17] Oh, you walk the world, you walk the world, you walk the world

[29:27] Woo!

[29:28] Thank them going down to the world tonight and I'm going to drink till I get my bill

[29:35] And I hope when I get old I'm sitting around thinking about it

[29:40] But I probably will, yeah just sitting back, trying to recapture a little of the glory of the times slips away

[29:53] Leaves you with an offer of mystery, boring stories of glory days, yeah they'll pass you by glory days

[30:05] And the one who really am goes by glory days for a day

[30:12] They'll pass you by glory days and the one who really am goes by glory days for a day

[30:26] There's something wrong with the world today, I don't know what it is

[41:29] My side is vital

[41:33] My hands are cold

[41:35] And I'm all on my knees

[41:38] Looking for the answer

[41:42] Are we human?

[41:45] Are we dancing?

[41:49] Will your sister be alright?

[41:53] When you dream of home tonight

[43:34] So we say

[43:38] Nothing seems to please say

[43:41] It all fits alright

[43:44] When I play into the night

[43:48] See me at you

[43:51] You fall down

[43:54] This place is understood, this no is so good, it didn't slow me down

[44:03] This taking, always acting guessing, underestimating, look up still around

[44:14] Pretty, pretty please don't you ever feel like you're lastin'

[44:22] Fucking perfect, pretty, pretty please

[44:27] If you'll ever ever feel like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect

[44:35] To me, you're so mean to me when you talk

[44:42] About yourself, you were wrong, chose the voices

[44:50] In your head, in your head, make them like you instead

[44:58] So complicated, look how we are makin' feelin' so much hatred, such a tired game

[45:09] It's enough, I don't know how I can think, oh, she's down on my demons

[45:16] I see you do the same, oh, oh, oh

[45:20] Pretty, pretty please don't you ever ever feel like you're lastin'

[45:43] The only thing I should be drinkin' is an ice cold beer, so cool in line

[45:47] And we try, try, try. But we try to harness, always some I'm time done

[45:51] Looking for the critics, cause they everywhere, they don't like my jeans

[45:55] They don't get my hair, exchange ourselves, and we do it all the time

[45:59] Why do we do that? Why do I do that?

[46:02] Why do I do that?

[46:03] Yeah!

[46:09] Oh!

[46:11] I'm breathing, breathing, breathing

[46:14] Breathe, breathe, breathe

[46:17] Don't you ever feel

[46:19] Like you're last there

[46:22] Fucking part of me

[46:24] You ever feel

[46:25] Like the past the day

[46:27] Drifting through the wind

[46:29] Warning is got again

[46:31] Do you ever feel

[46:33] Disappoint the thin

[46:35] Like a house of cards

[46:37] One loaf of cake and then

[46:39] Do you ever feel

[46:41] Already very deep

[46:43] Six feet on the screen

[46:44] But no one seems to hear a thing

[46:46] Do you know that there's

[46:48] Still a chance for you

[46:50] Because there's a spark in you

[46:52] You just gotta ignite

[46:55] And let it shine

[46:59] Just on the night

[47:03] Like the fire they've been alive

[47:07] Because maybe you're a fire

[47:10] Come on to the world

[47:14] Make them go

[47:16] As you shine across the sky

[47:21] Baby, you're a fire

[47:31] Make them go

[47:42] Like the waste that's face

[47:44] You're original

[47:46] Can I be replaced

[47:48] If you only knew

[47:50] What the future holds

[47:52] After a hurricane

[47:54] Comes a rainbow

[47:56] Maybe a reason why

[47:58] All the doors are closed

[48:00] So you could open one the leads

[48:02] It to the perfect road

[48:04] Like a lightning bolt

[48:06] Your heart will blow

[48:08] And when it's time you know

[48:10] You just gotta ignite

[48:12] And let it shine

[48:18] Just on the night

[48:22] Like the fire they've been alive

[48:26] Because maybe you're a fire

[48:28] Your work

[48:30] Come on to the world

[48:32] Make them go

[48:35] As you shine across the sky

[48:39] Baby, you're a fire

[48:44] Come on, let your colors

[48:47] burst

[48:49] Make them go

[01:59:08] The name is complained about the noises above

[01:59:12] But she only comes when she's on top

[01:59:20] My therapist said, not to steal no more

[01:59:24] She said, you're like a disease

[02:02:50] To end a fascination

[02:02:53] Even with an ironed beard

[02:02:56] Or then you got to rule a nation

[02:03:00] When all I got is resisted

[02:03:04] If don't really matter

[02:03:08] As I keep it to myself

[02:03:11] Said if don't really matter

[02:03:15] Is time out the ground for somebody else

[02:03:36] Or then you got to rule a nation

[02:03:40] When all I got is resisted

[02:03:53] Or then you got to rule a nation

[02:03:56] When all I got is resisted

[02:04:13] Don't really matter

[02:04:16] I guess you'll find out for yourself

[02:04:20] Don't really matter

[02:04:23] So you can't hear it now from somebody else

[02:04:27] You think you got it all right, nothing's right

[02:04:31] And turn it into a man of an ourselves right

[02:04:34] And turn it into a woman of a bond of ourselves

[02:04:38] And turn it out, you're keeping your own kind of hell

[02:04:41] And turn it into a woman of a self

[02:04:45] And turn it into a man of your head

[02:04:47] And turn it into a man of your own kind

[02:05:21] Deep inside our hope

[02:05:27] Waited on a line of waiting on the lines

[02:05:32] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:05:38] Build out your confidence

[02:05:41] So you can be on time for once

[02:05:44] Wake up, who cares about

[02:05:47] Little bug that talked too much

[02:05:50] I've seen it all, go down

[02:05:59] Let me be the one to her

[02:06:02] The one who wants to be with you

[02:06:06] Deep inside our hope

[02:06:13] Waited on a line of waiting on the lines

[02:06:18] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:06:27] But we can be together, baby

[02:06:30] You can make my life worthwhile

[02:06:33] I can make you start to smile

[02:06:43] When it's through, it's through

[02:07:02] I fade with twist of both of you

[02:07:05] So come on, baby, come on over

[02:07:08] Let me be the one to show you

[02:07:12] The one who wants to be with you

[02:07:17] Deep inside our hope

[02:07:20] You're feeling too ill and too

[02:07:23] Waited on a line of waiting on the lines

[02:07:28] Just to be the next to be with you

[02:07:34] The one who wants to be with you

[02:07:40] Deep inside our hope

[02:08:11] A goal taking it slow

[02:08:16] And love don't you know

[02:08:19] I'll have my time with a full man's lady

[02:08:23] You're chained on a twilight train

[02:08:26] Ain't nothing here that I care

[02:08:29] I'll take all the long and maybe a song

[02:08:35] To sing when I want

[02:08:38] You don't need to stay pleased to know man for a happy end too

[02:08:45] Oh, a love of my rosy child

[02:08:49] You got the way to make me happy

[02:08:53] You and me we're going to start

[02:08:57] Crackle and roll your store for one

[02:09:00] But you make me sing like a guitar homin'

[02:09:04] So hang on to me girls, oh keep running

[02:09:11] Play it now, play it now

[02:09:14] Play it now, my baby

[02:09:17] Crackle and roll the make me smile

[02:09:20] Girl, if it's last for an hour

[02:09:23] Hold on, it's all right

[02:09:25] Cause we got all night

[02:09:29] We set the world right

[02:09:32] Find us a train that don't ask no questions

[02:09:36] Yeah

[02:09:39] Oh, a love of my rosy child

[02:09:43] You got the way to make me happy

[02:09:47] You and me we're going to start

[02:09:51] Crackle and roll your store for one

[02:09:54] But you make me sing like a guitar homin'

[02:09:58] So hang on to me girls, oh keep running

[02:10:05] Play it now, play it now

[02:10:08] Play it now, my baby

[02:10:11] Crackle and roll the make me smile

[02:10:14] Girl, if it's last for an hour

[02:10:17] Hold on, it's all right

[02:10:19] Cause we got all night

[02:10:22] We both lie silently stealing the dead of the night

[02:10:27] Although we both lie close together

[02:10:31] With few miles upon a time

[02:10:34] Was it something I said or something I did

[02:10:38] Did my words not come out right

[02:10:41] Though I tried not to hurt you

[02:10:45] Though I tried but I guess that's why they say

[02:10:49] Every rose has its thorn

[02:10:54] Just like every night has its dawn

[02:11:01] Just like every cowboy

[02:11:05] Sings a sad, sad song

[02:11:09] Every rose has its thorn

[02:11:14] Just like every night has its thorn

[02:11:29] I'm gonna see you do a baby song

[02:11:33] Then on the radio

[02:11:36] Where the DJ said it loves a game of ease

[02:11:39] A cold and an easy go

[02:11:43] But I wonder if it does he know

[02:11:46] As I ever been like this

[02:11:49] And I know that you can be here right now by

[02:11:54] To the leaves of no storm

[02:11:56] I can see every rose has its thorn

[02:12:03] Just like every night has its dawn

[02:12:09] Just like every cowboy

[02:12:13] Sings a sad, sad song

[02:12:17] Every rose has its thorn

[02:12:23] Though it's been a while now

[02:12:27] I can still feel so much pain

[02:12:31] And the night on the radio

[02:12:34] But the sky, the sky, the rain

[02:12:38] All in the heat

[02:13:08] I know I couldn't see the love that not about

[02:13:20] I know what the same

[02:13:23] Instead of making love

[02:13:28] We both made a several ways

[02:13:32] And now I hate about somebody new

[02:13:36] And better never miss that much to you

[02:13:40] To give that tear open inside of the sea

[02:13:44] Because man, like I'm not by your side

[02:13:48] Every rose has its thorn

[02:13:52] Just like every night has its dawn

[02:13:58] Just like every cowboy

[02:14:04] Sings a sad, sad song

[02:14:08] Every rose has its thorn

[02:14:12] Just like every night has its thorn

[02:14:16] I can still feel so much pain

[02:14:20] And the night on the radio

[02:14:24] But the sky, the rain

[02:14:28] All in the heat

[02:14:32] I set my mind at ease

[02:14:36] There is no doubt you're in my heart now

[02:14:44] Said woman take its long

[02:14:48] And work is help of mine

[02:14:52] All we need is just a little patient

[02:15:00] Said you got to make it slow

[02:15:04] And we come together by

[02:15:08] All we need is just a little patient

[02:15:14] Oh yeah

[02:15:26] Said here on the stairs

[02:15:32] Because I'd rather be alone

[02:15:36] And I can't have you right now

[02:15:40] And I can't get up

[02:15:44] Sometimes I keep so tense

[02:15:48] But I can't speed up the time

[02:15:52] You know love there's one more thing to consider

[02:15:58] Said woman take its long

[02:16:04] Things we could just buy

[02:16:08] And when I'll just use it, old patience

[02:16:16] Since you got to take the time

[02:16:19] Because the lights are shining bright

[02:16:24] You and I got what it takes to make it

[02:16:30] We won't make it

[02:16:34] I'll never break it

[02:16:38] Because I can't take it

[02:17:08] I'll never break it

[02:17:38] Y all is

[02:17:53] Hello bija

[02:17:58] You know who I am

[02:18:03] I'm a hero

[02:18:05] Just a little patience, yeah

[02:18:15] So I'm on the pace, I've been walking this way

[02:18:19] And tonight I'm just trying to get it right

[02:18:25] I start to see it when so many around

[02:18:29] No, I don't like being stuck in the ground

[02:18:32] And the leaves don't change but maybe the later

[02:18:37] I ain't got time for the game, because I need you

[02:18:42] Yeah, but I need you

[02:18:46] I need you

[02:18:50] I need you

[02:18:54] I need you

[02:19:02] I let you settle down that you found a girl

[02:19:13] And you're married now

[02:19:19] That your old dreams came true

[02:19:24] Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

[02:19:32] Old friend, why are you so shy

[02:19:38] And like you, the whole back

[02:19:42] All right, from the light

[02:19:46] I hate to turn up out of the blue one

[02:19:49] Invited but I couldn't stay away

[02:19:52] I couldn't fight it, I had hoped you'd see my face

[02:19:55] And that you'd be reminded that for me

[02:19:58] It isn't no word

[02:20:02] Never mind, I'll find someone like you

[02:20:09] I wish nothing but the best

[02:20:12] Are you too?

[02:20:16] Don't forget me, I beg

[02:20:19] I'll remember you say

[02:20:23] Sometimes it lasts and lasts but sometimes it hurts instead

[02:20:30] Sometimes it lasts and lasts but sometimes it hurts and stay

[02:20:39] You know how the time flies only

[02:20:47] Yesterday was the time of our lives

[02:20:53] And we were born and raised in a summer

[02:20:59] Hays bound by the surprise of our glory days

[02:21:08] I hate to turn up out of the blue one

[02:29:17] The years and guys from school

[02:29:20] Had a bad every time in your heart

[02:29:23] To be quick, Jody got married

[02:29:27] You know we never get far

[02:29:31] No matter what back now

[02:29:34] The time will seem the last forever

[02:29:37] And if I had the choice

[02:29:40] Yeah, I was more than I'd be there

[02:29:44] Those were the best days of my life

[02:29:55] Ain't no use saying we're complaining

[02:29:58] When you got a job to do

[02:30:01] Just get my name in and sound after job

[02:30:04] In and that's what I meant to get

[02:30:08] Staying in it on your mama's porch

[02:30:11] You told me that you wait forever

[02:30:15] Oh, man, yeah, my name

[02:30:18] I knew that it was not one ever

[02:30:22] Those were the best days of my life

[02:30:28] Oh, yeah

[02:31:05] Look at everything that's coming down

[02:31:08] Times that I play that old six-treme

[02:31:12] Take a picture of the world when we're all

[03:34:35] Now that I'm stuck in the line, I'm in a wrong order, but it's missing

[03:34:41] I'm not gonna be the power, it's a bad order, I'm lazy

[03:34:45] Time does bend the wages, and my book won't number it

[03:34:51] Proud in my pocket, we know it ain't been destiny

[03:34:57] We're out to be popular, no time to plan my feet

[03:35:02] Because today, I'm not gonna be the power, it's a bad order, I'm lazy

[03:35:08] So things look better, if we don't just let them be

[03:35:15] We're yesterday, it's got nothing for me

[03:35:23] We're yesterday, we're gonna know who's me

[03:35:33] That was not nothing for me

[03:35:39] We're not gonna be true

[03:35:43] We're not gonna be true

[03:35:59] Yeah, today, we were talking about that, that was never true

[03:36:04] Now that I'm stuck in the line, I'm in a wrong order

[03:36:21] We're not gonna be the power, it's a bad order, I ain't gonna be the power

[03:36:27] We're yesterday, we're gonna know who's me

[03:36:36] I go to bed, feeling the same way, I ain't nothing but tired

[03:36:43] And I'm just tired and bored with myself

[03:36:49] I could use just a little hope, we can't start a fire

[03:36:55] We can't start a fire without a spark, this one's a high

[03:37:01] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:37:11] Messages keep getting clearer, videos on when I'm moving around my place

[03:37:18] I check my luck in the mirror, wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

[03:37:25] And I get to know who I am

[03:37:28] I'm just living in a dark darkness, there's something happening somewhere

[03:54:20] So I started come away

[03:54:27] She knows it's too late as she's walking on fire

[03:54:34] And so I'd slide away

[03:54:40] But don't look back and I know I heard you say

[03:54:49] Take me to the place where you go

[03:55:20] So I'd slide away

[03:55:26] And she knows it's too late as we're walking on fire

[03:55:33] And so I'd slide away

[03:55:39] But don't look back and I know I heard you say

[03:55:46] Take that look from up your face

[03:55:51] Because you said the brains I had went to my head

[03:55:56] And so I'd slide away

[03:56:00] And so I'd slide away

[03:56:04] And so I'd slide away

[03:56:08] And so I'd slide away

[03:56:12] And so I'd slide away

[03:56:19] And so I'd slide away
