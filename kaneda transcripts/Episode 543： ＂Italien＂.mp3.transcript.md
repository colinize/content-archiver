[00:00] And when she wakes and makes up her mind.

[00:07] Well, if you were hoping for a miracle announcement that Chicago gaming company or American

[00:14] pinball was going to remake Alien and they were going to get it on the line soon and

[00:19] you were going to get your game any week now, your dreams have been somewhat crushed by

[00:24] the news today of Alien Pinball coming back and it's being manufactured in Italy, in Northern

[00:30] Italy, the hotbed of pinball manufacturing.

[00:34] Let's talk about the Alien reveal on episode 543 of Canadian Pinball Podcasts.

[00:40] So first thing I want to talk about is how they revealed this to the world and it was

[00:44] a little awkward, right?

[00:45] They've been teasing this thing for weeks.

[00:47] The pinball brothers started with some obscure teaser campaign on Facebook.

[00:52] Then they started to share actual images of the new game coming back which was fine.

[00:56] I mean, it was one of the worst kept secrets in pinball.

[00:59] It's been a very long time since we said that Alien was coming back.

[01:02] I think you heard it on Canadian pinball podcast first.

[01:05] Of course we were way off on the timing of this machine coming back.

[01:09] So they started this Facebook teaser campaign and then they were like, we're going to

[01:13] reveal Alien Pinball, the comeback of Alien Pinball, the non-highway pinball version of

[01:19] the game made by pinball brothers.

[01:22] We're going to reveal it to the world on a podcast which is somewhat strange when you

[01:28] think about it because the last place you can see a game, the last place you can stream

[01:33] a game and the last place you can visually get wowed by a visual toy like a pinball machine

[01:40] is a podcast.

[01:41] So it was kind of strange to me that they went all in on revealing all the details around

[01:46] Alien Pinball on a recorded podcast on the super awesome pinball show.

[01:51] Now that being said, that was the only option all of us had to hear what the pinball brothers

[01:56] were going to say about Alien Pinball.

[01:58] So I do recommend you check out the super awesome pinball shows reveal of Alien.

[02:03] It went up today at noon.

[02:05] Now I will say this, I will say this, they don't start the Alien interview until an hour

[02:10] and 20 minutes into the podcast.

[02:13] So if you want to get right to the Alien news, you have to skip to an hour and 20 minutes

[02:18] in because it's a two hour and 40 minute show.

[02:20] Okay.

[02:21] Now what did we learn about Alien?

[02:22] So we learned that the pinball brothers are going to bring this game back.

[02:26] We learned that they're going to make it in northern Italy.

[02:28] So we'll talk a little bit about that.

[02:30] We learned what the price was going to be on the standard version of the game.

[02:34] We learned how to order the game.

[02:37] And then we learned a few more details about what their journey was going from highway

[02:41] pinball to this point with Alien pinball.

[02:44] So I just want to give my thoughts on this whole thing.

[02:46] So first and foremost, after thinking about it for a couple hours, I do think this reveal

[02:50] was sort of half baked.

[02:52] And I want to explain why because here's the thing.

[02:54] If you're going to come back and announce that you're making a game that many people paid

[02:59] for and never got their machine, if you're going to say to the world, hey, we're back,

[03:04] we have Alien and it's for real this time.

[03:06] And you're going to get your game and anyone who gives us money or anyone who orders this

[03:11] game, I don't want you guys to have any doubt in your minds that you're going to get

[03:15] the product, right?

[03:16] Because that's how this story ended last time.

[03:19] People paid for this game and they never got the games they paid for.

[03:22] So what is the one thing you would do on day one of your reveal when you want to convince

[03:27] people that they should be confident that you're going to deliver?

[03:31] It's simple.

[03:32] You have games in boxes already made.

[03:35] Why would you reveal to the world your plans on December 18th if you don't have any games

[03:39] made yet?

[03:40] Isn't it premature to do it today, to do it right now, a week before Christmas, really

[03:46] now we need to know that you're bringing Alien back?

[03:49] So if you're not taking pre-order dollars like they said, why would they need to reveal

[03:54] the game to the world on this date?

[03:56] That was the part that when I walked away from it all and I said to myself, well, they

[03:59] haven't really shown us anything.

[04:01] They haven't shown a game on the line.

[04:03] They haven't really shown us a game in a box and why are they going live right now?

[04:07] Hasn't anyone learned a lesson?

[04:09] The best way to launch your pinball machine, especially when you have a theme like alien,

[04:14] you know people are going to buy it, show them you can make it.

[04:17] This is two for two now.

[04:19] We have deep root and we have alien pinball, both games, both games, revealing themselves

[04:24] to the world and they haven't shown us anything when it comes to manufacturing of these

[04:29] games.

[04:30] And I don't have to remind anybody out there in this hobby, the most important thing,

[04:35] the most important thing in pinball is manufacturing.

[04:38] It is the first thing you should show people, not the last thing.

[04:41] And if you look at the pattern lately, the pattern lately is the companies that are winning,

[04:46] the companies that are making the best games, the companies that are delivering on their

[04:51] promises, they will show you manufacturing day one.

[04:55] They will show you how they do this.

[04:57] You know what I heard deep roots say that manufacturing was a trade secret they weren't

[05:01] going to share with people.

[05:02] Let me tell everybody this, there's no trade secret to how you build a pinball machine.

[05:07] There's not.

[05:08] You're screwing stuff into wood.

[05:10] I don't care what you got in each room of your building.

[05:13] Ultimately, it has to go on a line in front of a human being who is screwing stuff into

[05:19] wood.

[05:20] That's all it is.

[05:21] And that's what people want to see, that you have all the parts in the boxes, that you

[05:25] have people who you hired to stand in front of that wood play field and screw stuff into

[05:31] it.

[05:32] It's not a trade secret.

[05:33] It's why if you open the door to stern pinball.

[05:36] If you open the door to spooky pinball, if you open the door to Jersey Jack pinball, what's

[05:41] the first thing you see when you open the door to those companies?

[05:44] Do you see showrooms?

[05:45] Do you see this?

[05:46] No, you see a manufacturing facility.

[05:49] You see hardworking people screwing stuff into wood.

[05:54] So if I wore the pinball brothers and I was anybody out there who wants to get consumer

[05:59] confidence on your project, the first thing I want to show them is people screwing

[06:05] stuff into wood.

[06:06] I mean, even Andrew Highway was smart enough to make those fake videos of production in

[06:11] which people were wearing winter caps with long screw drivers and screwing posts into

[06:16] the wood itself.

[06:17] Okay.

[06:18] So I think this game was released prematurely.

[06:20] I do.

[06:21] I'm really happy it's back.

[06:22] I think they're making a smart decision by re-engineering all of the electronical issues

[06:27] that Andrew Highway put into the game.

[06:29] I think it's smart to switch out the cabinet.

[06:31] I do.

[06:32] I like the way it looks with the cabinet.

[06:34] While I don't miss the screen on the play field, I think removing the big 27 inch LCD from

[06:39] the back box of the game is a mistake.

[06:42] I do.

[06:43] And I think they should put that back into the game when they reveal the details of the

[06:47] limited edition version of the game because we don't know what is in the limited edition

[06:52] version of the game.

[06:53] And we're going to talk about that.

[06:54] Well, let's just get right to the chase right now.

[06:55] Let's just cut right to the chase.

[06:57] So they announced today that they're making a standard version of the game for $7,777.

[07:02] I'm not sure why it's that price.

[07:05] Is that something to do with Alien?

[07:07] I don't think so.

[07:08] So that is a little bit more than Andrew Highway's price of $6,500.

[07:13] Okay.

[07:14] Now, with everything that's in this wide-body game, that's actually a very competitive price.

[07:18] And I think they'll sell a lot of these machines at that price.

[07:22] Now the question I had after they talked about working with this Northern Italian manufacturer

[07:27] is this do they know what the bomb is on the game?

[07:32] Do they know what it's going to cost them to make each of these machines?

[07:35] And I got a little worried.

[07:36] I got a little worried because when you heard the way they talked about manufacturing, they

[07:41] said, we are starting to order the parts.

[07:44] We're going to ramp up slowly.

[07:46] We're going to start slowly and hopefully build up over a period of months until we can

[07:51] get up to 100 games a month.

[07:54] So that has me believing they don't know exactly how much it is to make each game.

[07:59] And haven't we seen Dutch Pimbal go down this road before where you get a contract manufacturer?

[08:05] You tell people what the price of the game is well before you know for sure how much it's

[08:12] going to cost.

[08:13] And I'm going to say this, the total price it's going to cost is usually going to be more

[08:18] than you anticipated.

[08:20] They talked a lot about bumps in the road.

[08:23] So do you think there's not going to be bumps in the road for a brand new manufacturer of

[08:28] Pimbal machines in Northern Italy?

[08:30] I get this company has made other stuff, but they've never made a modern Pimbal machine.

[08:36] And so they are going to experience bumps in the road ordering parts, vendors, manufacturing,

[08:42] training the people who put these games together.

[08:45] What happens when you encounter those bumps in the road and it costs more than you thought

[08:50] to make each alien?

[08:52] Why would you set the price for the game until you know the totality of what some of those

[08:57] additional costs might be?

[08:59] This is what sank Dutch Pimbal people.

[09:01] We can't forget this.

[09:02] And I'm just a little nervous that they came out and they set a price that's competitive,

[09:08] but it might not be high enough to take into account all of the issues they're going to

[09:12] face as they get to full scale production.

[09:15] And even when I saw the price $7,777, I'm like you have alien Pimbal.

[09:20] It is definitely worth more than that in a box.

[09:24] And I think they should have priced it higher and I think people would have been fine

[09:27] with that, but it is what it is.

[09:29] I get it.

[09:30] It's weird, right?

[09:31] Canada rooting for higher prices, but you know what I mean?

[09:32] I just don't want them to under price this thing, run into financial like hardships,

[09:38] and then the whole thing becomes a sinking ship again, just like at Andrew Highway's facility,

[09:43] just like a Dutch Pimbal.

[09:44] I just think they should have put in more of a buffer room to make sure they don't reach

[09:48] that point where they have to go back and ask consumers for more money or they have to

[09:52] like delay paying their contract manufacturer because they underpriced the game.

[09:56] That's what I mean by that.

[09:58] To me, the biggest mistake of this launch was the lack of details around the limited edition

[10:03] version of this game.

[10:04] You launch with your most expensive title on day one.

[10:08] You collect the money from the people who are willing to invest the most in your company

[10:13] on day one.

[10:14] The fact that there was nothing about the Ellie figured out at all, nothing.

[10:19] I went in on a game right away with Melissa, other people went in on a game right away with

[10:23] Coin Takeer, and we just thought we were buying the Ellie version of Alien, and then immediately

[10:28] it became apparent.

[10:29] Wait, we're buying the standard version of the game, and everyone's like, I don't want

[10:32] the standard version.

[10:33] I want the Ellie version of Alien because it's that kind of theme where you're going to

[10:38] want the Ellie version of the game and the nicest looking version of the game.

[10:42] And guess what details we got on the Ellie?

[10:44] We got nothing.

[10:46] We don't know what the price is.

[10:47] We don't know what the differences are.

[10:49] We don't know what kind of trim it's going to have.

[10:51] We don't know what any of the changes are going to be, and we don't know when it's going

[10:54] to ship.

[10:55] The only thing we do know, they told us the Ellie would not be available for at least six

[11:00] months.

[11:01] So are you kidding me?

[11:02] Like six to eight months from now, we have the way to get the Ellie version of your game.

[11:07] Now let me ask you a question in the pinball world.

[11:09] Tell me another pinball company that has launched a game in which they didn't even show you

[11:15] the Ellie version of the game for six months.

[11:19] Give me one launch example where that has been the case.

[11:22] If they really wanted to do the best reveal possible, they should have shown the top of

[11:27] the line version of the game.

[11:29] They should have said we're going to make 500 of the Ellie's first and then we're going

[11:33] to open up some standards.

[11:35] And I don't buy the argument that they should make the base level first to figure out any

[11:40] of the issues with manufacturing.

[11:42] Fine, they make 25 pro editions of Alien, but then have the Ellie ready to go.

[11:48] I don't want to spend the most amount of money on an Alien, on a Guns and Roses collector's

[11:53] edition.

[11:54] I don't, I don't want to spend the most and watch everybody else enjoy the same game

[11:58] for months.

[11:59] Why I wait and you see it in the Guns and Roses camp right now.

[12:03] CE owners are pissed off and they've only had to wait two months, two and a half months.

[12:08] Even waiting six to eight months, watching everyone else enjoy their Alien standard and

[12:14] then they're going to hit you up for payment.

[12:16] I just don't think that's ever going to work.

[12:18] I think it's sloppy marketing and I think it's something they should have figured out

[12:21] well before they did this.

[12:23] Why wouldn't they have the Ellie ready?

[12:26] Because think about it like this people.

[12:27] You get one moment to launch any product.

[12:30] You get one moment to make a first impression with your company and wouldn't you want the

[12:35] first moment to say the pinball brothers are real.

[12:38] We're doing this and we've brought back Alien.

[12:41] Wouldn't you want to wheel out the nicest version of the game?

[12:45] Why wouldn't you do that?

[12:47] It looks good but I don't love the silver armor.

[12:49] I think there's more they could have done on the cabinet artwork I gotta be honest.

[12:52] It's not blowing me away.

[12:54] I mean think about how awesome you could illustrate the Alien world on a cabinet.

[12:58] I think the legs need to be black or something that's more guy girl looking.

[13:02] There's just a lot they could do with it and there's a lot they might do with it.

[13:06] They were talking about how the blue version is the nicest one that highway released and

[13:10] yet here we are.

[13:11] You're back and you're showing us the basic version of your game.

[13:14] I think that's a huge mistake.

[13:16] I'm just going to say it too.

[13:17] I would have revisited the Playfield artwork.

[13:20] It was never popular.

[13:22] People never liked it and now we get it again.

[13:24] If you're going to renew the license and you're going to work with Fox and you have two

[13:28] years to redo this game.

[13:31] It's really perplexing to me that they didn't listen to consumer feedback on that art package

[13:36] of the Playfield.

[13:37] People were not a fan of it.

[13:38] You have to accept it now.

[13:40] It's okay.

[13:41] It is okay.

[13:42] But just think about it like this everybody.

[13:44] This game was shown to the world or showed his art package in 2015.

[13:49] I believe 2015.

[13:51] Look how far we've come with artwork in Pimball since 2015.

[13:55] If you want to come back out and you want to make a huge splash and you want to blow people

[14:00] away, why wouldn't you revisit one of the weakest things that Andrew had in his version

[14:06] of the game which was the Playfield artwork.

[14:08] But it is what it is.

[14:09] I will say this.

[14:10] The game looks okay.

[14:11] It looks okay.

[14:12] It doesn't blow me away based on this theme and what you could do with Alien.

[14:16] I'm not seeing anything in this version of the game that wows me anymore than what the

[14:22] Andrew Highway version of the game did.

[14:24] One of the really interesting parts of the interview with the Pimball Brothers was how

[14:28] candid they were.

[14:29] And they were very transparent and it was really interesting to hear this for the first

[14:33] time.

[14:34] They said to everybody in the world, we lost over a million dollars with Andrew Highway.

[14:40] We invested over a million dollars and we never got anything out of that investment.

[14:46] That money is gone.

[14:48] And that number is significant because when you think about some other Pimball companies

[14:52] out there who have spent many many years developing games and not shipping games, it does beg

[14:58] the question, how many millions of dollars are some of these companies in the red and must

[15:04] need to recoup a lot of that money to create a successful Pimball company?

[15:09] They have to.

[15:10] There's no way around it.

[15:11] You can't make a Pimball company with six figures.

[15:14] It's a seven figure operation.

[15:16] Well, at least not at the scale that these companies are at, right?

[15:19] Spooky didn't start with seven figures and I don't think P3 multi-morphic did either.

[15:24] And if you want to sell hundreds of games, you're talking millions of dollars has to be

[15:28] invested in the organization.

[15:30] One part in the interview that I still think is a little revisionist history is the way

[15:34] they talk about their relationship with highway Pimball.

[15:37] These gentlemen were heavily invested in highway Pimball earlier on than I think the interview

[15:43] conveys.

[15:44] They didn't just come on the last year of Andrew Highway's run to get alien out.

[15:49] These gentlemen were on board for much longer than that.

[15:52] And the story is kind of a sad one.

[15:54] I mean, Andrew Highway duped them.

[15:56] He convinced them that alien was further along than it was.

[16:00] He convinced them the quality was better than it was.

[16:03] And ultimately, after they burned through so much money, they realized that they were holding

[16:08] on to a bag of crap.

[16:10] And the only thing they could do was force the company into bankruptcy because what happened

[16:13] and they talk about this is that they underestimated the number of people that would want a refund

[16:20] when they came on board.

[16:21] So they thought that people would be loyal to alien Pimball when Pimball brothers took

[16:26] over.

[16:27] And I can't imagine why they thought that.

[16:29] People had been burned by Andrew for years.

[16:31] He had been lying to people about manufacturing and timeframes and saying two weeks and two

[16:36] weeks and two weeks.

[16:38] Remember how many times he would promise people two weeks?

[16:40] So when the Pimball brothers took over the reins at highway Pimball, it's crazy to me that

[16:45] when they were doing their analysis of how it would work that they underestimated how

[16:51] disloyal people would be to the operation.

[16:54] Of course, people wanted their money.

[16:55] Of course, people wanted to jump ship.

[16:57] By the time that Pimball brothers took over highway Pimball, it was the Titanic.

[17:02] It had already struck the iceberg.

[17:04] It already had five compartments filled with water.

[17:07] There was nothing they could have done to prevent that ship from sinking.

[17:11] And so for people who had pre-order money in, they knew the ship was sinking.

[17:15] They knew it was going down too.

[17:17] And that's why they ran for those lifeboats and they wanted off of that ship immediately.

[17:21] So I can't imagine why they thought people would stay in with that venture.

[17:25] So here we are today.

[17:26] It's a new day.

[17:28] It's a new alien.

[17:29] It's a new approach.

[17:30] Do we think they will be successful?

[17:32] So I don't know yet.

[17:34] Nobody knows yet.

[17:35] I feel better about this than I did when Andrew Highway was behind this project.

[17:39] But there's still a lot of uncertainty.

[17:42] How will they ship games from Northern Italy?

[17:44] How will that work?

[17:45] I know if you order through coin taker, you put a thousand dollars down and it's about

[17:50] like 450 bucks for shipping.

[17:52] Now they said there were no pre-orders.

[17:55] What is that?

[17:56] Is that a pre-order or not?

[17:57] Like it's a deposit, but it's not a pre-order.

[18:00] Now, I want to say, Chris and Melissa are amazing people.

[18:04] It is not a pre-order.

[18:05] It is a deposit for a game.

[18:07] They are not going to send that money to Pimball Brothers.

[18:11] You have to go back and remember the only people who lost money on the Andrew Highway

[18:16] deal were the people that paid highway Pimball directly.

[18:21] Remember, Andrew took money directly or you could have ordered your game through coin

[18:25] taker.

[18:26] People who ordered through coin taker did not lose their money.

[18:29] So this is the right way to do it.

[18:31] You give Melissa money, she holds on to the money.

[18:34] That is a deposit for your spot.

[18:37] She is not sending that money to Pimball Brothers until your game is ready.

[18:41] Your game is in a box and your game is on its way to America.

[18:45] So you can feel confident putting your money down with Melissa.

[18:48] And here's the thing, if this venture goes belly up and the Pimball Brothers don't figure

[18:53] it out, your money will go back to you.

[18:55] So if you want an alien standard, go in and go get one right now and you are on the

[19:01] line to get one.

[19:02] That is what you are giving a deposit for.

[19:04] It is super disappointing that there is no LE.

[19:07] That there is no information.

[19:08] A lot of people thought they were ordering an LE today and Melissa will move your money

[19:12] over to an LE deposit but you are looking at a 6 to 8 month weight.

[19:17] Do you really want to have your money tied up for 8 months?

[19:21] I mean 8 months from now we are going to have toy story.

[19:23] 8 months from now we are probably going to have back to the future.

[19:26] I think about how many Stern games we are going to have 2 to 3 more Stern games.

[19:30] We are going to have the next game from Chicago Gaming Company.

[19:32] So there is going to be so many titles available in 8 months.

[19:36] That feels like an eternity to have your money locked up on a game.

[19:41] Now again they should have sold the LEs first.

[19:44] So my overall take on today is simply this.

[19:47] This is now the second Pimball Company in the month of December that is opened up orders

[19:52] for games that are not yet on the line.

[19:55] If they were on the line they should show it.

[19:58] There is no greater thing to show a Pimball buyer than the Pimball machine you want them

[20:02] to buy being manufactured.

[20:04] That is the most important thing.

[20:06] If your game is not on the line, if your game is not being manufactured then you should

[20:11] not be revealing your game.

[20:13] You should not be doing podcasts, you should not be taking victory laps, you should not

[20:18] be opening up your order banks, you should not be doing interviews and talking about everything

[20:23] that is in this game that is not yet being made yet.

[20:26] A game being made is the most important thing.

[20:28] Without that nothing else matters.

[20:31] The other part about the interview with these gentlemen that just stood out to me was there

[20:35] was a lot of laughter and I don't think this is funny to everybody because you have to

[20:39] remember there are people out there that never got their game from Andrew Highway.

[20:43] They don't find it funny, it hasn't been a laughing matter for them.

[20:47] They've spent years stressed out about this.

[20:50] What they want to know is that the Pimball brothers are going to get it done.

[20:53] What they should have heard today on Reveal Day was that your games have been made.

[20:59] Everyone who's got a voucher claim with Andrew Highway for the Pimball Brothers version

[21:04] of Alien.

[21:05] Those people should have been told on Reveal Day.

[21:08] We are a new company.

[21:09] We have made every single highway Pimball voucher game real today.

[21:15] They are in a box.

[21:16] You can redeem your voucher today and your game will be shipping to you in the next few

[21:20] weeks.

[21:21] Right now this is still just their intention to do all of this.

[21:25] I think they should have waited till they were a little bit further ahead.

[21:28] I have the same advice for Deeproot.

[21:30] You got to show your game.

[21:31] You got to show your game being made.

[21:33] You got to show production.

[21:34] You can't just tell us what your plans are and then ask us for money.

[21:38] You got to show people that you have the ability to make these games.

[21:42] Do any of you know what the Northern Italian manufacturing facility looks like?

[21:46] Have you seen it?

[21:47] Have you seen any proof it's real?

[21:49] It's easy to show pictures of parts.

[21:52] It's easy to show that.

[21:53] And that is good visuals.

[21:55] At least we're seeing that.

[21:57] That's more than we've seen from some other companies.

[21:59] At least we're seeing Playfield stacked up.

[22:01] At least we're seeing face huggers lined up.

[22:03] So stuff is happening over there.

[22:05] But my main takeaway is why?

[22:07] Why would you reveal it the same week as Led Zeppelin?

[22:11] Why would you reveal it like a week before Christmas when GNR Ellie's are flying out

[22:15] the door at Jersey Jack?

[22:16] Why would you do it now?

[22:18] What was it about December 18th that said,

[22:22] this is the day we're going to reveal Alien to the world.

[22:26] I don't understand that part of it.

[22:29] Why wouldn't they just have waited to the first X amount of games were off the line

[22:34] and real and in a box?

[22:36] That is the part I just don't get.

[22:39] Because you're not getting pre-order money.

[22:40] It's not like if you need it money, you would have asked for it.

[22:43] But they didn't, which is good.

[22:45] But then why?

[22:46] And if I could give the Pimbal brothers any advice, it would be to learn something.

[22:50] I know this is crazy to say this, but they should learn something from Dutch Pimbal.

[22:53] Dutch Pimbal is another company where people gave money and didn't get what they paid for.

[22:58] What did Dutch do?

[23:00] Barry turned his new line on and his Barry doing podcasts,

[23:04] is Barry doing victory laps, is Barry doing reveals like this?

[23:08] No, what they're doing is, is they're putting their heads down and making the game.

[23:12] They are getting their hands dirty and they're figuring it out and they're making the game

[23:17] and they're shipping big Lebowski's to people.

[23:19] And he's not taking a victory lap because Barry knows his job is not done

[23:24] until every EA gets their big Lebowski.

[23:27] And the same is true for the Pimbal brothers.

[23:29] They should learn something from Barry.

[23:31] Don't do reveals.

[23:33] Don't do interviews.

[23:34] Don't pat yourself on the back.

[23:36] Go make these games.

[23:37] People will buy alien the same way people buy big Lebowski.

[23:41] But you have an obligation.

[23:43] I know they keep saying they're a new company.

[23:45] They're not highway Pimbal.

[23:46] No, that's not true.

[23:47] They have an obligation to make these games for those men and women who bought it from Andrew Highway.

[23:54] They do have that obligation and I get that they lost millions.

[23:57] But if you're going to remake Andrew Highway's game, exactly the same way he made it for the most part.

[24:03] I mean, it looks like the exact same game.

[24:05] This is highway Pimbal's alien 2.0.

[24:08] You're making his product.

[24:10] Okay, there's no way around that.

[24:12] And it's cool.

[24:12] Like the world will accept it.

[24:14] But now you need to just do the hard work.

[24:16] And this is my advice for every single Pimbal company out there.

[24:20] Highway Pimbal, Dutch Pimbal, CGC.

[24:23] You got to do the hard work.

[24:24] You got to prove that you can do the hard work before you reveal your game to the world.

[24:29] And all too often, we've seen the other thing occur.

[24:33] Where everyone wants to reveal the fun stuff.

[24:35] But nobody wants to get to the hard stuff.

[24:38] So I hope they get the hard stuff right.

[24:40] I hope they figured out what these games are actually going to cost before they priced it.

[24:44] And I hope we don't run into another situation in which a contract manufacturer

[24:50] and a Pimbal company don't see eye to eye on how much it actually cost to make a Pimbal machine

[24:56] in the modern world.

[24:58] So I wish them the best of luck.

[24:59] Now they have to do the hard part.

[25:01] And they've started to say we're going to see something in January.

[25:04] So if we see Alien Pimbal unboxed in January or arriving at CoinTaker,

[25:10] that will be a very good sign.

[25:12] Man, it's turning out to be a very crowded January February.

[25:16] You know, Robert also promised Raza some time in February.

[25:19] So will we see Alien or will we see Raza first?

[25:23] And will anybody get their Guns and Roses Collector's Edition

[25:27] before either one of these games come out?

[25:29] It's a crazy time.

[25:31] I'm going to watch Led Zeppelin Stream tonight.

[25:33] I'm still underwhelmed by that reveal.

[25:35] We'll see if the gameplay turns that game around.

[25:38] But for a lot of people out there, man, Led Zeppelin, Steve Richie, it feels very cookie cutter,

[25:43] feels very uninspired.

[25:45] Let's hope.

[25:46] Let's hope the stream can save it.

[25:48] Everybody, we'll be back with Led Zeppelin Stream on the next episode of

[25:52] Canade's Spinball Podcast.

[25:53] Have a good day.
