[00:00] Music

[00:11] Alright, we got Mr. Scott Denisi coming on Canadian's pinball podcast today and we talk

[00:16] all about the Rick and Morty stream that you saw over the weekend lots of good information

[00:21] from Scott.

[00:23] But before I air that interview, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you that I'm

[00:27] so thankful.

[00:28] I'm so thankful that pinball, I don't know if you know this, but pinball now has a fact

[00:34] checker in this hobby and it's no other than Mr. Me Seaks many.

[00:39] Mr. Zach Me Seaks many is now fact checking Canadian's pinball podcast and he's going to

[00:45] let you know what we say is correct and what is wrong.

[00:50] So apparently we got this huge thing wrong that medieval managed royal editions aren't

[00:55] shipping yet.

[00:56] Uh oh, only the standard editions are shipping.

[00:59] Cancel the show guys.

[01:00] You can't listen to this anymore.

[01:01] I'm not doing my journalistic integrity.

[01:05] What else did we get wrong?

[01:06] Well we said rumors, right?

[01:08] And when you say a rumor, there's a rumor out there in the pinball world that you heard.

[01:13] Let me tell you what you can't do.

[01:15] You can't fact check rumors.

[01:18] So the whole notion of fact checking rumors is a name.

[01:22] Here's why because no manufacturer out there will confirm for you if your rumor is correct

[01:29] or not.

[01:30] Like if I reached out to American pinball and said is hot wheels your next title, what are

[01:34] they going to tell me?

[01:35] They're not.

[01:36] Jersey Jack won't even confirm for people.

[01:39] If guns and roses is the next game from Eric, even though we all know it is.

[01:43] Okay.

[01:44] But Mr. Me Seaks many, here's what he fact checked also.

[01:47] I said there was a rumor that American pinball might bring two games to T.P.F.

[01:51] And he's on the network to tell you that that rumor is false.

[01:55] Yeah.

[01:56] So it's just going to be hot wheels.

[01:57] And guess who told the world that it was hot wheels and guess who was right?

[02:02] Canada's pinball podcast.

[02:03] Okay.

[02:04] The other rumor, and again, I said this was a rumor that Mark Richie was working possibly

[02:10] on another alien game with Chicago gaming company.

[02:14] Okay.

[02:15] Now since I reported that rumor, I've since learned new information.

[02:19] Should I share it with you?

[02:20] Or maybe I should call Mr. Me Seaks many.

[02:23] And maybe I should get permission from the network to talk to you guys.

[02:26] You know what rumors they didn't talk about?

[02:29] The Stern rumors, which I know are pretty much 100% going to happen, which is the rerun

[02:33] of Metallica, the Transformers with the comic book art, and Steve Richie making a Led

[02:38] Zeppelin cornerstone game.

[02:40] Uh oh.

[02:41] Can't talk about those rumors because I distribute those games and I would get in trouble

[02:45] with Uncle Gary.

[02:46] All right.

[02:47] So here's what I'm hearing.

[02:48] Richie is in fact making two games.

[02:52] He's designed two games.

[02:54] And Chicago gaming company is most likely who is going to manufacture those games.

[02:59] Now, I'm here to tell you that I was told that alien is not the game.

[03:04] Now the person will not tell me what it is other than this.

[03:08] That Mark Richie is working on a license theme sci-fi title.

[03:15] So it's sci-fi related game that he will be making with Chicago gaming company.

[03:20] Now what could it be?

[03:21] What could it be?

[03:22] I don't even, how do you even begin speculating?

[03:24] I mean, titles like Back to the Future are considered sci-fi.

[03:28] Rick and Morty is sci-fi.

[03:29] Total recall fifth element.

[03:32] I mean, Star Wars is considered sci-fi.

[03:34] So there's almost too many.

[03:36] The expanse, right?

[03:38] You could create a laundry list.

[03:40] Now if I were to guess what sci-fi movie I think it might be that has a big pinball audience

[03:47] and this is just a guess.

[03:48] So you can't fact check rumor this wrong, Mr. Me Seeks many.

[03:52] I would say maybe Blade Runner would be a good one.

[03:54] We've talked a lot about that and people have been excited for Blade Runner pin.

[03:59] So the other game that I'm hearing Mark Richie has.

[04:02] And again, rumor, but feel free to fact check me.

[04:05] The rumor is this.

[04:06] I'm hearing that he has Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.

[04:12] And we know that Pulp Fiction is a game that someone secured the license to.

[04:17] And I think a lot of people were speculating it would be a stern game.

[04:20] And maybe I don't even know.

[04:22] I just know Mark Richie could possibly be making Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.

[04:29] Okay?

[04:30] Now look, be a big boy when you want to fact check Kanye just pinball podcast.

[04:34] All right?

[04:35] Buddy, enjoy this interview with Scott Dinesi.

[04:38] I think you're going to love it.

[04:40] And we'll be back to see if Mark Richie is making a sci-fi game and a Quentin Tarantino

[04:45] game.

[04:46] You heard it here.

[04:47] Oh my God, the royal dishes aren't going out for another three weeks.

[04:50] How can we let Kanye to stay on the airwaves?

[04:53] Come on.

[04:54] You know why I would number one.

[04:57] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

[05:07] A man who's having quite the last few months, Mr. Scott Dinesi.

[05:12] Scott, welcome.

[05:13] Hi, hi everybody.

[05:14] All right.

[05:15] So I'm excited because as of yesterday, sort of we've seen the most streaming footage

[05:21] of Rick and Morty.

[05:22] And I know you've done the podcast circuit.

[05:26] So when we do my best to talk about some different angles with this game, how's that sound?

[05:30] Absolutely, man.

[05:31] Yeah, that sounds great.

[05:32] Yeah, we had the sort of that stream yesterday.

[05:37] I wish I could play Pimball better after watching that again.

[05:40] I was like, oh God, I'm embarrassed.

[05:42] Right.

[05:43] Yeah, it's okay.

[05:44] Let's talk about that.

[05:45] So designing a game when you self-admitedly are like, I'm not that great at Pimball.

[05:51] Does that, how do you know when you're designing that you're nailing the design?

[05:58] Do you have other people jump on in the whitewood stage?

[06:01] I absolutely do, but I'll tell you what, you don't actually have to be good at Pimball

[06:05] to know kind of what really makes a Pimball good because in my turn, in my eyes, I have

[06:12] this vision of what I think makes Pimball fun.

[06:16] And I go with that route, even though I'm not good at playing it like a tournament player

[06:22] would.

[06:24] I try to make Pimball fun in ways that I personally think it's fun.

[06:29] So really, I don't have to be that great at Pimball.

[06:32] I still have fun playing Rick Kimority, even though I wasn't playing well yesterday.

[06:38] It was still fun because sometimes you get those games, you just blow it up, you know,

[06:40] and it's just, it's really fun.

[06:41] So, well, let me ask you a question.

[06:43] So in terms of fun, what are the key elements that you think make Pimball fun?

[06:49] So for me, it's layouts like weird layouts.

[06:52] So I'm a big fan of, you know, this is not like, you know, I've said this probably a bunch

[06:58] of times, but I'm a big fan of like super weird games.

[07:02] Like for instance, you know, like games like, I don't know if you're played Dragon Fist

[07:05] by Stern.

[07:06] Like games from the 80s.

[07:07] Yeah, I actually played it for the first time at the Tribeca Law, Mr. Adam Schwartz.

[07:12] It's super fun and the sound in it.

[07:14] It is fun.

[07:15] It's just fun.

[07:16] It's weird.

[07:17] The shots are weird.

[07:18] Like it makes you do weird stuff.

[07:20] Like so, you know, I was trying to, I tried to like capture some of that weirdness in

[07:26] what I'm working on.

[07:27] I'm trying to do things.

[07:29] You know, it's a very tough question that you asked me there.

[07:32] Actually, what does make it fun?

[07:36] For me, like a lot of the fun stuff is taking what I'm actually engineering a Pimball

[07:41] Machine.

[07:42] I'll take parts that are standard parts off the shelf and try to use them in weird ways

[07:49] in actually fun ways that, you know, either, you know, have been done in the past or,

[07:55] you know, maybe have been sort of not done in the past, but like tweak it a little bit,

[07:59] you know, but really nothing I've done has not been done in the past, you know.

[08:06] Right.

[08:07] That makes sense.

[08:08] So it's just kind of all put together a different way.

[08:10] Right.

[08:11] Because you're a big fan of sort of reimagining parts that you can grab off the shelf and

[08:17] putting it in a game in a unique way, the Denise lock.

[08:21] We now have 2.0 of the Denise lock.

[08:24] For your third game, is there any interest in designing a mech from the ground up that

[08:30] hasn't been done before?

[08:32] Well, third game, I haven't even thought about anything yet.

[08:35] I need it, honestly, I need a vacation.

[08:37] Right.

[08:38] Planning mechs is pretty fun.

[08:41] I dabbled in it a little bit on Rick and Morty when I was making pieces that did not

[08:46] exist before.

[08:48] The trough on the left side of the game, the secondary trough that stages a ball and it

[08:54] actually has multiple switch positions in it.

[08:56] It's basically a trough that loads from the bottom of the play field instead of the top.

[09:00] So it is a piece that is fully custom and made from, it's a one of a kind piece.

[09:07] Same thing with that captive ball as well, that wire form with the threaded pieces on

[09:12] it.

[09:13] It's actually threaded through the play field and squeezes the play field.

[09:17] That didn't exist anywhere either.

[09:21] And you hit that and it charges your magnetic save on the right, correct?

[09:26] Yeah, and it also qualifies locks.

[09:27] So it's super important.

[09:28] Also, it does an add-a-ball in multi-ball, which is cool.

[09:32] So in the stream yesterday, I was watching it, that magnetic ball save seemed to work really

[09:36] well.

[09:38] If you had a lot of feedback on the features of the game and how the shots are, what would

[09:44] have you received so far from people?

[09:46] So yeah, let's talk about the magnetic save actually because it's a really good point.

[09:51] I did have a few people that played the game and are like, hey, the ball was screaming

[09:56] toward the out lane and I hit the magnetic save and it didn't do anything.

[10:00] And I'm like, yeah, exactly.

[10:01] I'm like, this magnetic save is a bit different than, it's not a save in my ball.

[10:06] It's actually a finesse thing.

[10:08] So like when you have the ball screaming to an out lane, you're done.

[10:11] Don't even bother trying to hit the magnetic save.

[10:13] Like, it's not going to grab it.

[10:15] But there is a level that you can, when it's in the in-lane out lane area or going that

[10:23] direction and not screaming for the out lane, you can actually hit that magnetic save, grab

[10:28] the ball or flick it back into play.

[10:31] I noticed that.

[10:32] Just like it back towards the right flipper would actually hop over the lane.

[10:36] Yeah, really cool.

[10:37] It does.

[10:38] That's mostly what happens.

[10:40] Dropping it down the in-lane is actually the scariest way to do it because if it's going

[10:44] slow enough and you're able to kind of pull it away from the out lane and just kind of

[10:47] hold it and you have enough charge built up to actually grab the ball and hold it, it's

[10:52] really nerve-wracking to like no when to drop it so it falls in the in-lane.

[10:57] Right.

[10:58] So it's like, it's so scary.

[11:00] But it's fun and that's to me, like that is the style of magnetic save from games like

[11:07] like Jungle Lord, Black Knight, the original Black Knight was like that.

[11:13] That just gives you a little bit more skill into a magnetic save to kind of play with it

[11:18] a little bit, you know.

[11:19] Yeah, very cool.

[11:20] Like, you see someone do something cool with the magnetic save.

[11:22] It wasn't because the computer did it.

[11:24] It was because the person like finessed the button correctly, you know what I mean?

[11:27] Right.

[11:28] So right now, after the stream, I know there's a lot of conversation about the difficulty

[11:34] of the game and there's some shots that are harder to hit than others.

[11:37] But I think Hilton did a good job in debunking the left ramp being a lot harder than the

[11:42] right ramp.

[11:43] Did you see he put up the amount of times each ramp was hit during the stream yesterday

[11:47] and it was pretty 50.

[11:48] Oh yeah.

[11:49] Yeah, it's pretty close.

[11:51] The left ramp is supposed to look harder than it is.

[11:54] It's wide open geometrically, but there are targets kind of leading up to it that make

[12:01] it look like it's totally obstructed.

[12:04] Like if you got down, like if you could take the apron off, get down and look at like

[12:09] just over the top of the right flipper into that ramp, it's freaking wide open, man.

[12:15] So all you really need to do is you just need to make sure that you've got, you know,

[12:19] you're lined up because it is steep and you can, you know, you could actually kind of like

[12:23] if you biff it off the side of the ramp a little bit, it could reddle a little bit and

[12:27] you won't be able to get all the way up.

[12:28] And then the loop from the upper right flipper, how's there's been a lot of talk about

[12:34] that shot.

[12:35] What's funny, Scott, is most people have not played the game.

[12:38] So they're going off of streams.

[12:40] Is that is that shot difficult?

[12:43] Is it meant to be difficult?

[12:45] That is the fucking hardest shot in the game and it's designed that way.

[12:51] It is so, it is a very difficult shot in my opinion because I'm not an amazing player,

[12:56] but like Bowen's like, oh, it's no big deal.

[12:58] He's like, here, look, I'm like, well, whatever dude.

[13:00] Right.

[13:01] And that shot, what is that shot lead to?

[13:04] The shot.

[13:05] Okay, so this is cool.

[13:06] So since that shot is so difficult and I purposely made it that way and a lot of people

[13:11] keep telling me it's not that bad.

[13:15] So that shot leads directly around the front of the left ramp and then it kind of goes

[13:20] behind it and goes right into the garage portal.

[13:24] So that shot is actually 100% hitable from the right orbit because the right orbit in

[13:32] this game when the diverter is just relaxed, it will go all the way up around and loop.

[13:38] So it goes to the right, you hit the right orbit, it loops around the back of the game

[13:41] through the underside of the house and into the garage portal.

[13:45] So there are two inserts that show portal ready.

[13:49] If you look back at that stream, one of the portal ready inserts is going through the

[13:52] garage, the front of the garage through that upper flipper.

[13:56] And then the other one is going through the right orbit.

[13:58] The right orbit is actually a nice easy shot to go through dimensions.

[14:03] So you're not going to get stuck with one shot.

[14:07] There's two ways to get it to that garage.

[14:09] Yeah, there's two ways to go.

[14:10] And that was done purposely so that that shot can be used for more important things like

[14:15] the Super Jackpot.

[14:16] Right.

[14:17] The Super Jackpot, when you're in multi-ball, that is the only way to get the Super Jackpot.

[14:23] And it lights with your first jackpot that you get, which is basically everything lit

[14:28] at the beginning.

[14:29] Hit one of those shots and then you can go for your Super Jackpot.

[14:34] So it's meant to be more, so it's meant to be very hard but very rewarding when you get

[14:41] it.

[14:42] Something very, you don't need to get a Super Jackpot to keep progressing through the

[14:45] game and you don't need a Super Jackpot to beat the next guy.

[14:48] Right now, as the game currently stands, how many modes or adventures are programmed

[14:56] into the game for people getting the game this week?

[14:59] I think like seven, I think.

[15:01] But there's a lot more in the pipeline.

[15:04] Yeah, I think it's seven if I'm not mistaken.

[15:07] But there's like, there's something like 15 or 17 dimensions put in already.

[15:12] They're in there right now.

[15:13] Yeah, in there right now.

[15:14] What's your favorite dimension that messes with the game right now?

[15:19] Oh, that messes with the game or my favorite dimension?

[15:22] Oh, okay.

[15:23] Those are two different things.

[15:24] What's your favorite?

[15:25] Okay, well, let's see.

[15:26] How about what's my favorite overall?

[15:27] Okay.

[15:28] And then what's, and then we'll do what's my favorite that actually messes with the game?

[15:32] Perfect.

[15:33] All right.

[15:34] So my favorite overall is because it's funny is there's a TNA dimension in the game.

[15:41] Where it actually you go into the, you go into that dimension and then all the lights

[15:49] through the reactor started light show from TNA.

[15:52] Wow.

[15:53] Which is the white and red.

[15:54] The ramps not count.

[15:55] The ramps absolutely do not count.

[15:57] They're shut off.

[15:59] Like you hit the ramp.

[16:00] It does nothing.

[16:01] That's amazing.

[16:02] Yeah.

[16:03] And then it plays the TNA music as well, which is pretty hilarious.

[16:08] So that one's funny because that one's just, that one's my favorite because it's funny.

[16:11] I think people laugh when they see it.

[16:14] But my favorite that actually messes with the game, it's the flippers get messed up on

[16:24] some of the dimensions, which is fun.

[16:26] But there are dimensions that shut things off in the play field.

[16:32] So there is the, like, I'll shut off the pop bumper, for instance, which is, and it'll

[16:37] play like this noise when you hit the pop bumper and it doesn't fire.

[16:41] The same with like the sling or something else, you know, there was one I saw yesterday

[16:45] that I thought was hilarious and it was just, it was a, it would, every time you hit a

[16:49] switch, it would, it would scream at, yes, that willum scream.

[16:53] Yeah.

[16:54] I love that.

[16:55] That was pretty great too.

[16:56] It's just meant to be annoying.

[16:57] So you're like, I got to get out of this dimension.

[16:59] You know, so you want to charge your portal gum back up and get the hell out of there.

[17:02] Well, and I'm glad you said that Scott, because on the chat, someone was like, I hope

[17:07] they code in different screams so it doesn't become annoying, but it's meant to be annoying.

[17:13] It's meant to be annoying.

[17:14] Yeah, absolutely.

[17:15] I love it.

[17:16] I love it.

[17:17] Yeah.

[17:18] So one question I saw too, I want to just get some of the, you know, this is like the,

[17:21] the new stuff since you've, you've done the rounds is the evil Morty song, the damage

[17:27] code.

[17:28] Is that going to be in the game or is that out of the game right now?

[17:32] Right now it's pulled out of the game because I don't, we don't have the rights to it yet

[17:35] and we're looking into seeing if we can get it and how much it would cost and doing

[17:39] that.

[17:40] I thought we would probably have that right off the bat.

[17:44] Well, we put it in the software because it was a pretty high, it was pretty, I think

[17:49] we were going to get it, but I'm not sure exactly what's going on with that, but it was

[17:52] pulled for now.

[17:53] Okay.

[17:54] But I don't know.

[17:55] You know what?

[17:56] I, what's really cool is Charlie and team have been shielding me from so much of like

[18:01] the crazy license stuff that I cannot think them enough because that is stressed that I

[18:07] really don't need.

[18:08] Right.

[18:09] And I, I talked to Charlie about it because right now all the characters that Justin does

[18:15] in the show are in the game, but the other characters right now are currently not in it,

[18:20] correct?

[18:21] Yeah.

[18:22] That is correct.

[18:23] Okay.

[18:24] And he said he's working on stuff.

[18:25] He said there's trying to get as much as they can.

[18:26] You know, I'm always surprised that a guy like Justin, these, they have to be buddies.

[18:30] Like I'm surprised he didn't just call up these people and be like, you know, do a little,

[18:34] can we do a little solid for a tiny pinball company in Benton, Wisconsin and wave some

[18:38] of these fees?

[18:39] But I guess it's just the realities of sag actors and working with that and it, and, well,

[18:45] it's not, I mean, I don't, it's not the actors, which is the weird part.

[18:48] It's their agents.

[18:50] So it's like, you know, I, I don't really know too much about it, but like you can't just,

[18:54] I mean, like if you and I were buddies in the, in the acting world, I couldn't just go

[18:58] to you and be like, hey, Chris, can you do me like do this, like do this one voice for

[19:01] me?

[19:02] You're like, well, I can't do that voice because I really don't own that voice.

[19:04] You know, it's not me.

[19:05] It's, you know, I mean, it's not.

[19:06] Yeah, these agents are probably legally tied to getting a financial cut on every usage of

[19:13] their clientele, which is interesting.

[19:15] Yeah, correct.

[19:16] Okay.

[19:17] And yeah, and it's not the person.

[19:18] It's the voice, you know, interesting.

[19:21] It's crazy.

[19:22] Yeah.

[19:23] And I wish I understood more about that stuff, but holy crap, it's complicated.

[19:27] Yeah, I was talking to, because he works on family guys, talking to rare hero about, and

[19:31] he said like Seth McFarlane just didn't really care and like waved all the normal fees as

[19:35] long as he got two pinball machines.

[19:36] And that's why family guy has, has a bunch in there.

[19:39] That's awesome.

[19:40] Yeah.

[19:41] So Scott, is it just like, are you relieved?

[19:43] I know you said you need a vacation.

[19:45] What, how do you feel that it's finally out there in the wild?

[19:50] I am actually feeling really good about it because I worried a lot about the geometry, just

[19:56] because I, you know, you get nervous about it.

[19:58] It's your baby.

[19:59] I've been working on it for two years now, doing whitewood iterations, making sure shots

[20:03] are working properly, that kind of stuff.

[20:06] But I've pushed the, I pushed a layout to the extreme, pretty hard.

[20:10] It may not look like it, but I'm using on that upper flipper, those, those two shots,

[20:16] like so the inner loop is off the top of the upper flipper and that, that outer loop

[20:20] that goes to the garage, that hard shot is off like the tip of the upper flipper, right?

[20:26] And upper flipper shots don't usually have shots that are that far spread apart.

[20:31] So they're usually like right in the sweet spot where that new, new target is.

[20:36] So I was really pushing that geometry to the limit.

[20:38] So it took me a while to kind of get that to, to feel right into work.

[20:43] But that, once I got it down, I'm like, this is, this is awesome, you know, but I'm still

[20:48] a little worried about it because it is out of the comfort zone of normal people, like

[20:52] when they play with games with upper flippers, right?

[20:54] Right.

[20:56] That really isn't normally where you go with those shots.

[20:59] And I can't wait till, till more people get to play it and they can, you know, they

[21:03] can relate to like what I'm actually talking about right now because it does feel like

[21:08] you have to train yourself and make an actual decision if to, when you're, that ball is

[21:12] going to that upper flipper because if you don't make a decision and you just flail at

[21:15] it, it's going to go right and hit that new, new target and that's probably not going

[21:19] to be worth what you're looking for.

[21:21] You know, Scott, I think you bring up a really good point because what you've done with

[21:26] this design is force the player to learn to play differently with your design, which

[21:32] is something I think is part of your approach, right?

[21:35] So when you watch people walk up to it for the first time, they sort of have their ingrained

[21:42] skill set and, you know, they're used to fan layouts all the time.

[21:45] They're used to the ball going here from this flipper to that ramp.

[21:49] And you're sort of messing with that a little bit.

[21:51] Do you ever get nervous that the initial streams are going to show people failing a little

[21:56] bit more than succeeding because you've purposely designed it that way?

[22:00] Yeah, absolutely.

[22:01] I am nervous about that, but at the same time, I'm kind of expecting it.

[22:05] So it's not that big a deal.

[22:09] When people start playing it, it only takes like one or two games to like go, oh, okay,

[22:13] you know, there's the shot, you know.

[22:15] Right.

[22:16] So how nervous can you be?

[22:19] They sold out in four hours.

[22:21] So it's, well, it's sold out because of the license, man.

[22:26] I know.

[22:27] Well, it's like the license is crazy.

[22:32] So that's no big deal.

[22:33] Now I just want to, I mean, it's, I guess it's maybe like a reputation thing.

[22:39] Like I want to make sure that people are happy with what design I threw down on the table.

[22:44] You know, it's a, I don't want people to be unhappy.

[22:47] Right.

[22:48] You know, that I'm trying to, I tried to make a game with this that was just outside of

[22:54] the box enough, but not too far outside of the box where it makes people like just like

[22:59] totally turned off by it.

[23:00] Now, Hilton's game was game number two.

[23:03] It's out there on location.

[23:04] Charlie's building around 10 a week.

[23:07] Is there, is there feedback that might come from these initial games that might change

[23:12] anything?

[23:13] Because I already saw that Hilton was like playing around with his flipper and he made

[23:18] it in a just me on that game specifically that that was number two, right?

[23:22] The, the right flipper was, was, was adjusted.

[23:26] It was squeezing the bushing too hard.

[23:28] Okay.

[23:29] We had to turn the power up like because we didn't want to take the game apart once we

[23:32] realized what was going on.

[23:34] So we, we just turned the flipper power up to, so the shot seemed normal.

[23:37] Okay.

[23:38] Hilton had to take that back apart.

[23:40] So he, he'll put some, he'll put another gap in it or whatever he's doing.

[23:44] There was other things too.

[23:45] There was the, the inner, the inner loop, which is the upper shot off the upper flipper,

[23:50] the one that loops around with the spinner.

[23:51] That one, one of the ball guides on the inside was pushed a little bit too far.

[23:56] So it was like making it kind of squeeze the ball and rattle a little bit.

[23:59] So just like that kind of little things like he just, so he just bent that one back.

[24:03] He also bent one of the rails in the back and just adjusted it slightly.

[24:07] So it would be a nice smooth feed to the upper flipper and stuff like that.

[24:10] But nothing, nothing crazy though.

[24:12] Right.

[24:13] And all this feedback is going back to spooky pretty much in real time, which, which is great.

[24:18] And so it, I'm game number 50.

[24:21] So I think my game might be built.

[24:24] So I'm excited.

[24:25] I don't know.

[24:26] I have no idea how many they got there.

[24:27] I know that they were, they had like, they were like putting them in the, in the way of

[24:32] the loading dock.

[24:33] So they might have a bunch of them there built, but I'm not exactly sure.

[24:37] I haven't been up there in a while.

[24:38] I should probably do that.

[24:39] Yeah.

[24:40] Charlie said that games were shipping as early as last Tuesday.

[24:44] So they're in root to people number 26 is going to Jack bar in New York City.

[24:50] So I'm hoping to hop on that.

[24:53] You know, it was hard for me, Scott.

[24:54] And I said, I wasn't going to watch a stream because I didn't want to spoil the sense

[24:58] of humor and the jokes.

[25:01] There's a lot more coming though, right?

[25:03] In terms of, yeah, like not even half of the custom callouts are in the game yet.

[25:07] So we're, I know coding numbers are the silliest things ever, right?

[25:12] They, they mean absolutely nothing.

[25:14] But where, where would you say your imaginary number is right now in terms of the code completion?

[25:21] Code completion?

[25:22] Oh, yeah, I don't even know.

[25:23] Yeah, we're not doing code numbers for this game.

[25:25] You notice that?

[25:26] I noticed that.

[25:27] Yeah, Eric's just like, you know what?

[25:29] It's confusing.

[25:30] People think like if you write a 1.0 on it or if you write a 0.5, they think that means

[25:35] 50% done.

[25:36] And that's not what that means at all.

[25:39] He's like, we're just putting dates on it.

[25:42] As of right now, like the game is, the game's pretty complete.

[25:45] I mean, like there's, you play adventures and you go through dimensions and you have

[25:50] multi-ball and you have like a bunch of other stuff.

[25:52] But there's still like a, there's a mesix, mania multi-ball coming.

[25:57] There is way more callouts coming.

[25:59] I have more music that I need to put in it.

[26:01] There's a lot of adjustments to sound effects and stuff that I need to work on.

[26:06] You know, obviously the light shows, there's a couple light shows that weren't kind of flowing

[26:09] together as nicely as I liked.

[26:12] So you know, little stuff like that.

[26:15] You're known for your light shows and that amazing spotlight effect when you get that multi-ball

[26:21] going, how do you conceptualize lighting a game?

[26:26] Well, it's, what I do is I look at this.

[26:28] So that one was actually one of the easiest ones.

[26:32] When I look, when I do a light show, right, there's a video that goes along with it on

[26:36] the LCD.

[26:37] So that video existed first and I saw the red beacons on that video and it's like, well,

[26:43] red beacons just, you know, scan around like a, you know, it's like a spotlight thing

[26:46] and they're looking for the guy, right, just do a spotlight, you know, it's a, it's actually

[26:50] a very easy animation and I did, I don't know if anyone noticed or not.

[26:54] I was, I was trying to skim through pinside, but I did change that animation from the last

[27:00] time that they saw it from that last stream.

[27:03] I added another spotlight in there so there are two spotlights going.

[27:06] Very.

[27:07] So I'm just kind of playing around to see if that looked better or worse or whatever.

[27:11] Right.

[27:12] Because it's, it's not, it's not too difficult to just swap things out, you know?

[27:15] Now, who was the gentleman off camera that was giving us the rule set and all the stuff

[27:22] in the game?

[27:23] Is it Eric?

[27:24] Am I making that up or is it?

[27:25] It is Eric.

[27:26] That was Eric the whole time and he is, he is the programmer.

[27:28] So he knows, uh, knows exactly what's going on.

[27:32] He knows way more than I do about it.

[27:33] Yeah.

[27:34] How do you guys work together moving forward now?

[27:36] Is it all in his hands?

[27:37] Are you, what, what's it like?

[27:39] Oh, we all talk together.

[27:41] We have, uh, we, we have like a, you know, a company slack thing that we go back and

[27:46] forth with.

[27:47] So, uh, but when I'll come up with concepts, Eric will figure out how to make them work.

[27:51] Eric also comes up with concepts, throws them by Boeing.

[27:54] I pretty much just read over everything and throw in, you know, stupid stuff when I can.

[27:59] Um, but luckily, like, I'm, I'm like, not a main core person in the development of

[28:05] what's happening with the actual software and the rules, which is nice.

[28:09] Your game came out and there, there's, it's sort of been a little bit of a title fight

[28:14] between strange or things and Rick and Morty.

[28:17] Have you noticed the, that, that both these games sort of got announced and revealed to

[28:22] the world at the same time?

[28:24] And the vibes have been different.

[28:26] And I guess a question I want to ask.

[28:28] Do you think people are softer on spooky than they are on stern?

[28:33] Uh, yeah, I do think I did.

[28:37] So I looked around a bunch and I do think there's, um, there are people on both sides just

[28:41] kind of like having fun poking at people.

[28:44] I do think it seems like people don't give stern, um, as much slack as something like

[28:51] spooky because I don't know.

[28:53] I, there's, it's really interesting because it wouldn't happen like this with TNA as well.

[28:59] I noticed there's a lot of people that are like, Hey, you know, let's, like, when I put

[29:02] the software out the first time, it was really, it really wasn't that fully fleshed out.

[29:08] And people weren't, instead of attacking me, people were kind of helping me work through

[29:12] and say, Hey, maybe we could do this or maybe this could be added to the service menu

[29:16] instead of like attacking, you know, right.

[29:18] And I think that's just, you get a smaller company.

[29:21] There's a face that like, like I'm an actual like, I'm a one person thing doing this TNA

[29:26] thing and people know that it's, you know, it's me.

[29:29] They've met me at a show or something like that.

[29:31] You know what I mean?

[29:32] Well, and you guys are part of the community.

[29:33] I mean, you're in the threads.

[29:34] You're talking to people.

[29:36] And I've always said, yeah, if stern, you know, is stern, stern is not in the threads.

[29:41] And I think that does create a little bit of a distance between them and their buyer

[29:47] base.

[29:48] And I think it actually invites more vitriol because you're not slamming Brian Eddie to

[29:53] Brian Eddie.

[29:54] You're just keyboard, commando, complaining about something.

[29:59] And he's not there.

[30:00] And it's always harder to talk negatively in the presence of the people who are actually

[30:06] behind these games because they, because everyone is passionate about what they're creating.

[30:10] I don't think I'm going to have absolutely there.

[30:13] 7, 750.

[30:14] So you are now have sold over 1200 games for spooky pinball, right?

[30:20] Yeah, that's, wait, that's crazy.

[30:22] I never even thought about that.

[30:24] Hold on.

[30:25] There were like 550 TNAs, right?

[30:27] Yeah, it's 550 TNAs, yes.

[30:30] And then plus the 750 Rick and Morty's.

[30:33] We're looking at 1300 games.

[30:34] So have you asked Chuck for a raise yet or what's up?

[30:39] I should ask him for a raise.

[30:40] That's a really good idea.

[30:41] Hey, Charlie, if you're listening, I know you're listening to this in the shop right now,

[30:44] probably with all the people.

[30:46] Make sure to give me a raise next time.

[30:48] Yeah, that would be, it would be awesome.

[30:50] Now you said earlier Scott that Rick and Morty, I think it was Rick and Morty.

[30:56] It was also, I think you have a lot of fans as well.

[31:00] I think people love seeing you get a theme like Rick and Morty.

[31:05] Moving forward, do you think this is an eye opening moment?

[31:09] For you, for Chuck, that we got to keep hitting the kinds of themes that just would translate

[31:17] perfectly to pinball?

[31:19] Yeah, so the thing though about Rick and Morty is I think it worked really well for

[31:23] spooky just because it is kind of a niche show.

[31:28] You know, like, there's a lot of people in the mainstream that, you know, they, I don't

[31:33] know if they would buy a pinball machine with Rick and Morty on it.

[31:36] You know what I mean?

[31:37] Like other Rick and Morty fans outside of pinball, but the crossover, I think the 750

[31:44] limit on the game is probably just under what would have actually sold if it was just

[31:49] wide open, you know.

[31:50] Yeah, it's hard to tell, right?

[31:53] Yeah, but I get this feeling though, like if we were to, like if it was like an unlimited

[31:57] run, I bet it would probably sell like 850, right?

[32:01] Wow.

[32:02] It's like, I don't know.

[32:04] I don't know if there's more or if there's 100 people on the wait list after seeing it,

[32:08] but you're right because it's just like pliers to the Caribbean because they only made a

[32:13] thousand.

[32:15] Everyone wants one now.

[32:16] Yeah, absolutely.

[32:17] If Jackson I'm making another thousand, you know, how many more will they really sell?

[32:24] Mm-hmm.

[32:25] Yeah, absolutely.

[32:26] And like what T and A, it's so it was wide open and I think T and A got like toward the,

[32:31] like middle to end of that run.

[32:33] People were really starting to like, it was really starting to pick up like people were

[32:36] like, oh, yeah, this game, it's like, it's really fun, you know, it's got crazy lights

[32:40] and crazy music.

[32:42] But that, you know, it started dying down at about 550 and he kept it right there and

[32:45] stopped it.

[32:46] Right.

[32:47] Do you want to see more T and A's ever made or are you good?

[32:51] I would love to see more T and A's made.

[32:52] That would be really cool because that also, it's I'm still working on the software on

[32:57] that game, believe it or not.

[32:59] I'm just, I took a little break from it just for a few months while I was really heads

[33:03] down with Rick and Morty.

[33:05] But I'm going to get back into that, do some more software, cool stuff there.

[33:08] I've learned a lot and refined my, my light show stuff with Rick and Morty.

[33:14] I actually think the light shows are way better in Rick and Morty than they are in T and

[33:16] A.

[33:17] And I want to take what I've learned from that and come back and redo a few of them.

[33:23] Is there working with spooky?

[33:25] Because they are limited by how many games they can make, you now know that they are going

[33:31] to make this game for around 18 months.

[33:35] Then Chuck is on to his next game.

[33:37] Do you ever wish they could maybe speed up and get a little, grow a little bit so you

[33:42] can get back on the court with the new game or are you okay waiting that long?

[33:47] Because it is a long wait.

[33:49] It's, I'm not waiting like there is no way actually.

[33:52] It takes a long time to develop a game.

[33:54] How long can I take?

[33:55] And honestly, it took, it took me about two years to develop Rick and Morty.

[33:59] Okay.

[34:00] So and remember I'm doing this part time as well.

[34:03] This is not my full time job.

[34:05] So it's, it's something that takes me a long time.

[34:08] I would, for me selfishly, I would want them to slow down.

[34:13] You know, I, I don't need, like it's, it's a lot of stress like working, like you know,

[34:20] work your day job right and then you start, you come home every single day and you're hammering

[34:24] away at all this other stuff and it's just, it eats it, yeah, I need a, need a little

[34:28] vacation from it, you know.

[34:30] Right.

[34:31] Well, I mean, when you see the amount of revenue this game is making, this could become

[34:38] your day job maybe one day.

[34:40] Would you like it to be?

[34:41] I don't think I would want to do it as a day job, unfortunately.

[34:45] Okay.

[34:46] Why is that?

[34:47] Yeah.

[34:48] Just, first of all, I really, really like what I do at Pimball Life and what's really

[34:53] interesting to me and I've, I just came to this realization maybe about a year ago is

[34:59] that what we're doing at Pimball Life when we re-engineer parts that don't exist anymore

[35:05] and we source different parts for people from all over the place and make it nice and

[35:11] easy for people to get these, these things to fix their machines up.

[35:13] I'm actually making more of an impact on the Pimball community doing my day job than

[35:19] I am creating a new Pimball machine.

[35:22] As weird as it sounds.

[35:23] I'm not really an ego-driven person at all.

[35:27] Trust me, I like a pad on the back if I did something good, but I really don't need it.

[35:32] But we're working behind the scenes as the engineer over at Pimball Life and making

[35:37] these really cool parts and getting these parts that have not existed in 30 years out

[35:42] to people so that they can bring back to life these games.

[35:45] To me, that's really rewarding.

[35:47] Right.

[35:48] No, that's great.

[35:49] I mean, I'm not an ego-driven person either.

[35:51] I'd never get it.

[35:52] No, as I seek my third twippy of...

[35:55] Yeah, you're like, oh, jeez.

[35:57] No, I think that's great.

[35:59] It sounds like you've got a great balance going.

[36:02] It's amazing to me that you're able to do both of these things and the success of this

[36:08] game in four hours.

[36:10] Did you guys think it would sell out back quickly though?

[36:15] That was astonishing.

[36:16] No, I was actually being...

[36:19] They were taking votes on how fast it would sell out because people were like, you know,

[36:24] how many...

[36:25] Well, they were saying how many would sell in the first 24 hours and they were taking

[36:28] kind of bets on there.

[36:29] And I was just like being an asshole and I'm like, oh, it's going to sell all 750, then

[36:34] 24 hours and then I got everyone's kind of laughing at me.

[36:37] I'm not really a cocky person, but when I do it as a joke, it's pretty funny.

[36:45] So yeah, I said 750 and they wrote that down for me and it ended up selling out in four

[36:49] hours everyone's like, oh my god.

[36:51] Yeah.

[36:52] It was a whirlwind day.

[36:54] It was incredible to watch, pin-side and the community sort of all try to come through

[37:00] the door immediately at...

[37:03] I think it was 9am.

[37:04] Yeah, it was a real time.

[37:07] So was there anything you had to leave out of this game that you could talk about or

[37:12] is that a scene?

[37:13] No, actually.

[37:14] And it's...

[37:15] Yeah, it wouldn't be a secret either.

[37:18] Every single thing that I did in the game, they left in there for me, which is pretty

[37:24] ridiculous.

[37:25] But the Magna-Save was actually the thing that I put in there as a thing to take out.

[37:32] So I dumped the Magna-Save in there like last minute, just saying, okay, we'll put a

[37:37] Magna-Save in it.

[37:38] And then when Charlie yells at me about the BOM, I'll be like, okay, fine, fine.

[37:43] I'll throw like a fake fit for a second and I'll just pull the Magna-Save out.

[37:49] But when I built the Whitewood and put the Magna-Save in it and did all this other stuff and

[37:54] Charlie played it, he's like, oh, we can't take that out.

[37:57] That's way too fun.

[37:58] I'm like, crap.

[37:59] I'm like, so what's he gonna do?

[38:02] Take out lighting.

[38:03] I'm like, no way.

[38:04] I will cry.

[38:05] And they ended up not taking out anything.

[38:07] So, well, and they just make fun of me.

[38:11] They just yell at me and get mad at me but don't actually take anything out.

[38:14] Right.

[38:15] Well, I read in an interview with you once where you were talking about getting younger

[38:21] people into Pimball.

[38:23] Now, this is a contemporary theme.

[38:25] Do you want to see more Pimball themes sort of go after more contemporary niche sort of

[38:30] geeky themes and sort of let some of the TV shows from the 60s?

[38:36] Who's that appealing to nowadays?

[38:38] Monsters versus Rick and Morty.

[38:40] What are your thoughts on that?

[38:41] I'm not sure exactly, but I do think that we do need a balance anyway.

[38:48] There are absolutely times and places for things like, like, like, rock bands from the 70s

[38:57] and 80s, right?

[38:58] There are absolutely places for things like Rick and Morty.

[39:03] I'm surprised no one's, you know, I think my South Park is kind of dying now, but it

[39:08] was really, really hot for a long time.

[39:11] And it got really, really popular way after that Pimball machine was made.

[39:15] I was surprised that no one else picked that up and made a second version, you know what

[39:19] I mean?

[39:20] And gave it a redemption.

[39:21] Right.

[39:22] You bring up a good point because you think once a game is made, it can't be made again

[39:29] or reimagined.

[39:30] Oh, it totally can't be.

[39:32] No, that's a piece of history, man.

[39:34] That South Park game is like, that's a piece of history, man.

[39:39] Like I played the crap out of that in college.

[39:42] Like that game was awesome.

[39:45] And it has its place.

[39:46] But I mean, another take on South Park again with today's technology would be really

[39:51] cool to me.

[39:52] So I heard a rumor that Adam's family was being considered to be redone.

[39:59] Do you think that would work?

[40:02] I think, well, actually, I think it would because you want to know why?

[40:06] Because Monster Bash did well.

[40:08] Minimal madness did well as a remake.

[40:10] Adam's family is rated like one of the best layouts around.

[40:15] So absolutely.

[40:16] And it's fun.

[40:17] In all new Adam's family game.

[40:19] Yeah.

[40:20] You mean like, oh, you mean like all new?

[40:21] Oh, no, I don't know if that would work.

[40:23] Like, it's not relevant.

[40:25] It's not relevant anymore.

[40:26] That's the whole thing with that South Park.

[40:28] That's the whole thing with the South Park thing I was saying is because South Park to

[40:31] me is sort of it's sort of like peaked already.

[40:34] Now it's kind of falling down a little bit.

[40:37] Right.

[40:38] Well, because when I just, when I saw like Lord the Rings, I love that game from Stern.

[40:43] And then if I'm Jersey Jack, it's like, why not just make Lord of the Rings over again,

[40:49] but even better versus Hobbit?

[40:51] Which is because Lord the Rings, the original trilogy is the timeless classic.

[40:56] The Hobbit's not going to go down nearly.

[40:58] There's got to be reasons, Chris, that you and I probably don't understand.

[41:02] No, probably like licensing exclusives that they probably just keep renewing every year.

[41:06] Even if they don't.

[41:07] It could be.

[41:08] It could be.

[41:09] Yeah.

[41:10] I'm not sure.

[41:11] I wish I had a good answer for that.

[41:12] No, but I'm like Adam's family though.

[41:13] I don't think I don't think Adam's family, the theme is relevant today.

[41:18] But I mean, they were to make that game over again as it was that could probably work.

[41:23] What do you think of Stranger Things?

[41:26] I have not played it yet as embarrassing as that is.

[41:30] I have not played it.

[41:31] Okay.

[41:32] I mean, what are your observations?

[41:35] Looking at it.

[41:36] Yeah.

[41:37] So at first I'm like the projector, I was a little bit skeptical on that that thing was

[41:43] I was like, oh, you know, the way because I have a lot of friends that do a lot of events

[41:50] where they do like live projection and stuff and lasers and stuff like that.

[41:54] The thing that you have to think about when you're doing when you're setting up things

[41:58] like that is you need to control your environment lighting and for in order for those to work

[42:04] and make an impact.

[42:05] And I was like in a PIMO machine, you really don't have environmental control over lighting

[42:09] because the whole ceiling of that PIMO machine is glass.

[42:14] So like if it's sunny, like the projector might not show as well.

[42:18] But I'll tell you what people were saying.

[42:19] The people who have actually played that, which I have I've not even seen that in real

[42:23] life yet, I really wish I would have, but they're saying it.

[42:27] That's actually looks alright.

[42:28] I hear also positive things about it.

[42:32] I did go off on their UV kit extension that you have to pay another 280 bucks to unlock

[42:38] the UV ink.

[42:41] But that's, you know, in terms of where we are with PIMBAL, do you hope that PIMBAL doesn't

[42:46] go the way of video games and downloadable content?

[42:50] We hear a lot about that on PIMSIDE.

[42:52] I really hope it doesn't go DLC.

[42:54] I really, really hope it doesn't happen.

[42:57] I think that I think that all this online stuff that the companies are working on now that

[43:03] they keep talking about like Jersey Jack did an online updating thing.

[43:08] I think they are going to, I hope, I really hope.

[43:11] And I do think they are just going to use it for just future updates for things.

[43:16] I really hope they're not going to charge people for like added added other things.

[43:21] That makes updating the games easier.

[43:23] You can have leaderboards in which you can connect.

[43:26] And they did it with Brighta Pimba 2.0.

[43:28] Do you remember that?

[43:29] You ever seen that leaderboard?

[43:30] Is that the Dutch Pimba extension?

[43:33] Yeah, the Dutch Pimba Brighta Pimba 2.0.

[43:35] I think I can dig up that link really quick actually.

[43:39] It's pretty interesting.

[43:40] You can see if anyone's playing their game right now, which is pretty interesting.

[43:45] They should have a counter and how many people didn't get their big Lebowski's and have

[43:48] that that leaderboard as well.

[43:50] They're shipping games though.

[43:51] They're actually getting new games assembled.

[43:55] And that's good news because when people get burned, the money evaporates within the hobby.

[44:02] And I think people lose interest in the hobby if they lose money on these ventures.

[44:06] So yeah, absolutely.

[44:08] Okay, so hey, I found that link.

[44:11] You want me to like shout it out because it's quite interesting what you can see from

[44:16] people who cheat.

[44:17] Yeah.

[44:18] It's the Dutch Pimba.com slash BOP2 slash live.

[44:23] Okay.

[44:24] Is that anyone playing around?

[44:25] Yeah, I mean, I just pulled it up on my screen right here as we're talking.

[44:29] And you can see everybody's games.

[44:31] You can see when they last played them.

[44:34] And then you can click into their games and see who they're, you see their like grand

[44:38] champions.

[44:39] You can see what version of the software they're running on.

[44:41] You can see the settings.

[44:42] They've got like three ball plus one extra ball settings.

[44:46] So that it's all fair.

[44:47] I can't wait to, we're all connected.

[44:51] Canada takes the glass off his machine and just becomes the greatest.

[44:55] Yeah, but I mean, it's like, it's like an honor system.

[44:59] So I mean, you wouldn't run like so, so check this out.

[45:01] Like I've got a golden T home edition machine at my house that actually runs on the internet.

[45:06] So it syncs up with my golden T live account, right?

[45:09] Yep.

[45:10] And they have tournaments that they do a golden T live, but the home edition games are

[45:17] completely excluded from those tournaments because they have no control over what people

[45:22] are doing with these games, right?

[45:24] Like I could hook a, you know, I could just like hook a micro controller up to that track

[45:28] ball thing and then fire the ball exactly where I want it every time, you know?

[45:32] Yeah, I mean, in the world of video games, people, if they can cheat, it's like when

[45:36] remember when people used to get joysticks that had turbo features and you're, you're

[45:40] there trying to tap away and it's just an unfair advantage.

[45:44] It is, yeah.

[45:45] So Pimbal, we talk a lot about, on my show about, will internet impact Pimbal and does

[45:53] connectivity, isn't needed other than what we just talked about.

[45:58] Can you sync up games?

[45:59] Like so, for example, Ninja Turtles is coming out and there's a rumor that it might have

[46:03] the ability to sync up four games together and maybe play as each turtle.

[46:09] I don't know if that even, oh, I heard that.

[46:11] I heard a rumor that the game might have something like co-out mode in it.

[46:15] Yeah, I think it's co-out mode.

[46:16] Yeah, I think that's actually more relevant or better because you don't have to have

[46:20] four machines, you know?

[46:21] Yeah, I think I just botched that.

[46:23] I think it is to co-op mode.

[46:24] Is it a co-op?

[46:25] Yeah, so that doesn't really require any at all.

[46:28] It's just a cool thing.

[46:30] Right.

[46:31] What's going to be cool?

[46:32] I think, look, Pimbal creativity, Scott, so I always harp about being creative and

[46:41] thinking outside the box and I look at a game like TNA without a lot going on mechanically.

[46:47] You were able to create an atmosphere and an immersion into a Pimbal experience that

[46:54] I think was refreshing and unique for people.

[46:57] Would you agree?

[46:58] Absolutely.

[46:59] Yeah, I agree.

[47:00] That was kind of what I was going forward with that game.

[47:02] As you look at the industry, do you think there's a lot of cookie cutterness or would

[47:09] you like to see people push the creative envelope more, especially companies that have a lot

[47:14] more resources, a lot more people, engineers and hundreds of hundreds of people?

[47:19] Do you think it's being pushed as far as it can be pushed or do you think?

[47:23] Well, they're pushing as hard as they can.

[47:25] I mean, look at Keith Owens games.

[47:26] He's really, really pushing Stern to do stuff that's outside of the box and that's awesome.

[47:31] Yeah, right.

[47:32] And it's a good example.

[47:34] Do you think he gets more money on his bomb or he's just more creative?

[47:39] No, he's doing different stuff.

[47:41] There's no way that they're giving him more money.

[47:44] It's like, I don't know how it works over Stern, but I'm assuming that they say, okay,

[47:51] build the machine, but then now make it fit within this bomb.

[47:55] So it's like, I don't know.

[47:57] I don't know.

[47:58] Maybe.

[47:59] I'm not exactly sure, but I'll tell you what, if you look at Iron Maiden,

[48:04] and you pop the thing open, there's not crazy stuff going on, really.

[48:09] I mean, there's not a crap ton of coils everywhere, but Keith used what he had in that game so well

[48:17] that it just, it seems like there's so much more going on than they're physically

[48:22] are like, you know, mechanisms doing stuff.

[48:25] Like, it's great.

[48:27] But yeah, I think Stern is pushing the limit now.

[48:29] I mean, I really do.

[48:31] And I think I can't wait to see what Eric actually comes out with at JJP.

[48:36] I'm good buddies with him, but we don't ever talk about what we're working on.

[48:39] Have you seen guns and roses?

[48:41] I have not seen anything of what he's talking or what he made.

[48:44] And I have no idea what the theme is besides what people are telling me.

[48:48] It's guns and roses.

[48:49] Come on, we all know that.

[48:51] Yeah, but I mean, I don't have no proof.

[48:52] I'm just hearing that from like third party people.

[48:55] So that's interesting.

[48:56] So you guys are buddies and you keep your projects completely secret, completely secret.

[49:01] Yeah, but it's so exciting though because I'm such a fan of like what he's doing.

[49:06] So like I get to be excited just like the pinball community gets to be excited when they

[49:09] see it.

[49:10] No, and they've done a good job.

[49:12] There's been no leaks.

[49:13] How did you guys keep Rick and Morty leak free?

[49:15] Because nobody knew other than I think people saw that there was a licensing agreement

[49:21] to make a pinball machine, but nobody knew it was spooky.

[49:23] Nobody knew it was your next game.

[49:25] Well, I'll tell you what, it's because of it.

[49:29] Probably it's because of that haunted house party joke.

[49:33] We really like we still to this day call it haunted house party and like the code has

[49:39] haunted house party stuff written in it.

[49:41] Like all sorts of stuff is it's just crazy.

[49:44] But I just started making that joke of haunted house party and people were just like,

[49:49] people just didn't care, I guess, to try and figure out what the heck was going on for

[49:53] real, you know.

[49:54] There's somewhere in the world there's a guy who loves haunted house parties.

[49:57] He was like really disappointed right now.

[49:59] Yeah, there were some disappointed people actually.

[50:03] Rick and Morty is divisive because there are people out there who I've never seen a

[50:10] Rick and Morty episode Scott until I heard about the game.

[50:13] And I knew what it was.

[50:15] Yeah, but see, that's the whole thing.

[50:16] Like that's why I don't think it would have sold more than like 850 games.

[50:20] You know, it's like, you know, people like know what it is or you know, like, yeah, whatever

[50:24] it's, you know, it's one of those like South Park shows, you know, yep.

[50:28] Well, and I think you probably got, I would say almost more than half the people who are

[50:34] buying this game.

[50:35] I would say like 75% probably started watching Rick and Morty for the first time because

[50:41] of the game.

[50:42] Man, I really hope that I hope it's not 75% I hope more people are watching it before,

[50:49] you know, because it does have die hard fans.

[50:52] Scott, it's got a really solid base of die hard fans.

[50:54] Well, and it's a good point.

[50:56] You bring up so do you think I'm always curious about the crossover number of, you know,

[51:02] Rick and Morty has 20 million people I think are watch the show.

[51:06] And then how many of those people are pinball buyers?

[51:09] It's like hot wheels.

[51:10] I when I talk about that theme billions of dollars and hot wheels are sold every year.

[51:15] But how many of the hot wheel buyer base or the people who still collect them as adults

[51:21] will buy a pinball machine.

[51:23] That's based on it.

[51:24] I'm not sure.

[51:25] I really would love to see that.

[51:27] I just don't know if there's a way to get those statistics reliably Ninja Turtles, another

[51:31] one, right?

[51:32] Do you think grown men?

[51:33] I know we all grew up with it.

[51:35] Do you think it's a good theme for pinball?

[51:38] I think so too.

[51:39] I do think so.

[51:40] And I think if they can make the co-op mode thing work right and do some cool like collaborative

[51:46] stuff with it, just like the four player Ninja Turtles, like that thing is just super

[51:49] iconic as an arcade game.

[51:51] And to this day, it's still fun.

[51:52] People still play that.

[51:53] It's just like that Simpsons arcade game too.

[51:55] You know, it's like you can have all four people playing at the same time.

[51:58] Well, and you know what helps Rick and Morty out is it has a TV show, right?

[52:02] That has incredible scenes that you can pull from.

[52:04] Same with Ninja Turtles.

[52:05] It's got the iconic theme song.

[52:07] It's got the cartoon you can pull from.

[52:10] It's got source material.

[52:11] And I think what's hard with like hot wheels, there's no show.

[52:16] There's no, there's nothing.

[52:19] There's no iconic theme song.

[52:21] It gets more difficult to pull people in.

[52:24] And yeah, I could see that for sure.

[52:26] And I can see the development process being a little more difficult without stuff, right?

[52:29] So like for TNA, we had to make up everything on the LCD because obviously total nuclear

[52:34] annihilation is not a thing.

[52:36] Right.

[52:37] Right.

[52:38] So what's next for you?

[52:39] Something in my head.

[52:40] Scott, what's next for you?

[52:41] Vacation.

[52:42] Seriously.

[52:43] Where you go?

[52:44] I need to take a break.

[52:45] I have probably my basement and sleeping.

[52:50] Are you going to be able knowing that the game's out there, you're going to be able to just

[52:54] turn it off for a few weeks or no?

[52:57] You're...

[52:58] Oh, yeah, I can turn it off.

[52:59] Yeah, it's not a big deal.

[53:00] I mean, I do want to go back to just coming home from work and doing like a little bit

[53:06] of stuff here and there and then kind of relaxing and enjoying Pimball again.

[53:11] Like I really haven't played much of my Pimball machines, which is why my skills are deteriorating.

[53:16] Right.

[53:17] But, you know, I want to go to show, is hang out with people.

[53:20] What's the next show you're going to be at?

[53:22] That will be TPS.

[53:23] Okay.

[53:24] We'll be the next one.

[53:26] All right.

[53:27] Well, Scott, that one?

[53:28] Yeah, no, I'm going to Ireland for about a week, right before TPS and then there's

[53:37] the deep route reveal.

[53:40] Oh, yeah, deep route's doing a thing at TPS, aren't they?

[53:43] Well, they're doing the reveal at deep route on the Wednesday and then there's also a VIP

[53:50] room at TPS.

[53:52] It's going to...

[53:53] This is going to be, I think, one of the best TPS to go to because I just...

[53:58] But I don't know if Eric's going to bring his new game, but that's coming.

[54:01] It has to be between then and MGC.

[54:05] So this spring is going to be an amazing time to see what's coming in the pipeline for

[54:09] all these companies.

[54:11] Absolutely.

[54:12] You guys are like...

[54:13] See, we're love about...

[54:14] You guys are like...

[54:15] It's like smooth sailing now.

[54:16] It's like, you just get to make a game now for 18 months and put your feet up and...

[54:21] But I think for you, Scott, it sounds like you really want this game to go down as a

[54:26] favorite for people.

[54:28] And you want to make something that is more than just a sell out, but an incredible experience

[54:34] that people won't forget.

[54:36] Yeah, exactly.

[54:37] And the same with TNA too.

[54:38] I'm just trying to make sure that the people...

[54:41] Because people...

[54:42] So look at it this way, right?

[54:43] So people put a lot of trust in myself and spooky buying these games, right?

[54:50] Because spooky is a boutique company.

[54:52] They don't make very many games like Matt likes Stern does.

[54:56] I had never designed a pinball machine from scratch before, before TNA, right?

[55:01] So when people bought TNA, they put a ton of trust in it that I would deliver something

[55:07] fun for them.

[55:08] Right.

[55:09] And that the game would be fun.

[55:10] And for me, I want to keep making sure people are happy.

[55:13] So there's things on TNA I still need to fix and little things I wanted to add that I

[55:17] just hadn't had time yet.

[55:19] But that whole mentality is still carrying over to Rick and Morty.

[55:24] This team is super passionate about making a game that they want people to be extremely

[55:29] happy with because of the trust that was put in when they purchased it.

[55:33] And I think that helps in the future, like if we say, you know, here's spooky's next game,

[55:39] if the people...

[55:40] Like, you know, if we show that, you know, we can actually follow through with stuff and

[55:45] make sure people are happy and that kind of junk.

[55:47] I think that goes a long way for a small company, you know?

[55:50] Absolutely, absolutely.

[55:51] Final, final thought.

[55:53] Is there a dream theme or is it...

[55:55] Is that you just get that question all the time?

[55:57] Is there something that you would love to make that if money were no object, you would

[56:04] make that theme?

[56:07] I would love to see back to the future.

[56:09] Yeah, what's up with it?

[56:11] Is it Spielberg or what makes it up with that?

[56:13] Exactly, what is up with that?

[56:15] I have no idea.

[56:17] I have no idea why someone didn't grab that.

[56:19] Yeah.

[56:20] Stern needs to grab that or something.

[56:21] Who made the original back to the future?

[56:23] It was Data East.

[56:25] Okay, which is Stern?

[56:27] Yeah.

[56:28] So Stern should grab it and do a reboot.

[56:30] Yeah.

[56:31] If anyone can get it, it's Joe Kamikaw, because I feel like he knows everyone.

[56:38] Joe knows everybody.

[56:40] Joe can totally get that.

[56:41] He got the Beatles, man.

[56:42] Yeah, they're not...

[56:43] I heard there's still like 800 Beatles games that haven't been made yet.

[56:47] They've only made half of them.

[56:48] No, I don't even know.

[56:49] They overpriced it.

[56:50] I could imagine that that was a very hard license to get.

[56:56] Or at least expensive or something.

[56:57] I don't know.

[56:58] Yeah, no, it wasn't cheap, but I think they priced it a little too high.

[57:03] But we'll see.

[57:05] Well, Scott, thank you so much for coming on.

[57:07] I'm excited to get your game.

[57:10] As you know, it will be the only game inside Canada's bedroom arcade.

[57:14] It will be my only Pimball machine.

[57:16] I'm waiting for it.

[57:18] That's crazy.

[57:19] Yeah, I look forward to playing it.

[57:21] I hope hopefully we'll have it in a couple of weeks.

[57:24] But again, I want to say congratulations.

[57:26] It was amazing to see your game sell out in record time.

[57:31] And I think this game is going to be a lot of fun for a lot of people.

[57:35] So congratulations.

[57:36] I think it's a victory lap time for you.

[57:38] Yeah, thank you so much, man.

[57:40] I really appreciate that.

[57:41] Awesome.
