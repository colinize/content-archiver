[00:00] The other thing about Pimball years ago, if you bought a game and it was great,

[00:04] and let's say you had a Lord of the Rings, Ellie, like arguably a great game,

[00:08] and you bought it for like 5,500 bucks, when you went to go sell it, you listed it for 7,500.

[00:16] Like you were happy buying a game, enjoying a game, and making a couple thousand dollars on it.

[00:22] The problem today, if Lord of the Rings came out, and it was like 6,500, and you bought it,

[00:28] you would then go list it for sale for like 15,000 or 13,500.

[00:33] That's the problem with Pimball today, is people are doubling the price they paid for the machine.

[00:39] If you have a stranger things, Ellie, and you got it for 9, you're now listing it for 18.

[00:45] Everyone's got in greedy.

[00:47] The consumers have become really greedy.

[00:50] The companies have become so greedy.

[00:53] There's no greater example of Pimball greed than seeing how little is in Toy Story 4,

[01:00] and how much money they want for it.
