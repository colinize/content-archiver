[00:00] I'd be the last to say don't follow your heart, but there's more to what it takes to be a man, than what you've known, what you've shown, than that we know you understand.

[00:30] I'm a distributor and I'm here and they're coming out in two weeks.

[00:52] Now look we've been saying that Predator Day is June 12th and that is in two weeks.

[00:58] I hate those words, two weeks.

[01:00] Every time we think something is two weeks away, it's more like two months away, but we

[01:05] know that Predator is right around the corner.

[01:10] There is another teaser from the pinball brothers.

[01:13] They put up the red polo shirt that Dutch wears in the movie during the handshake scene.

[01:21] We also know that Harry Potter, here's the latest I'm hearing, the artwork changes they

[01:27] wanted to the game were on the Ellie and the Wizard edition of the game, so the collector's

[01:34] editions can be made.

[01:36] I don't know, do you believe that?

[01:38] I just think they want to sell as many collector's editions as they possibly can.

[01:44] Maybe that's going to be the story.

[01:46] We can't make the other ones until we get approval, so we're going to take as many orders

[01:51] as possible on the collector's edition of the game.

[01:55] There's a rumor now that it's going to be limited to 1000 units.

[01:59] I don't know.

[02:01] What I know is this, every single person who loves pinball, who's excited to see these

[02:08] two games is tired of the wait because we've known about these games now for months, many

[02:16] months.

[02:17] Remember, it was back in March that Jack said, everybody hold on to your money, Harry Potter's

[02:23] coming.

[02:24] Then they had a teaser image and we thought the game was going to drop right on top of

[02:29] maybe King Kong and they did nothing.

[02:32] And there's been nothing since then.

[02:36] And so pinball brothers also seemingly is on track to release the game when they wanted

[02:43] to release it.

[02:44] So I'm just assuming it's the day Predator Movie came out in 1987 on June 12th.

[02:51] Nobody cares about that date though.

[02:53] This is the crazy part.

[02:55] So if what I'm hearing is true, then these two games are going to come out at exactly

[03:01] the same time.

[03:03] And I just want to say this, if you're a boutique, if you're pinball brothers, don't release

[03:09] your game.

[03:10] When there's 52 weeks in the year, why would you release your game right on top of Jersey

[03:18] Jack's biggest release ever?

[03:20] Why would you do that?

[03:22] Just from a pure marketing standpoint, they should have released Predator two weeks ago.

[03:28] They should be collecting nonrefundable deposits on the game because here's why.

[03:33] Nothing's changed about the game.

[03:36] Every game they had two weeks ago is the same exact game they're going to show you

[03:42] in two weeks.

[03:44] But the difference a month will make on how many orders they're going to get is going

[03:49] to be predicated on the Harry Potter launch.

[03:53] And people don't have this much disposable income.

[03:57] I don't care what anybody says.

[03:58] You're not ordering two games at the same time.

[04:02] You don't have room for two new games.

[04:04] You don't want to spend 20 something thousand, $30,000 on two new games.

[04:10] You just don't want to.

[04:11] And also, I think when people get a new pinball machine, we don't talk about this that much,

[04:16] but you really just want to enjoy that machine for a while, explore the game, have it be

[04:24] the new thing in your game room.

[04:27] Why would you need two, three, four new games in your game room until you fully explored

[04:33] one game?

[04:35] And so I think people who buy Predator or Dune or King Kong, they want to have that

[04:41] honeymoon period with the game.

[04:43] They want to enjoy it and they want to keep playing it, right?

[04:47] Almost every single new game.

[04:48] I hope every new game that comes into your game room makes you want to play it 2,000

[04:55] times at least.

[04:56] You know, when people see these games up for sale, I've had this game for four years and

[05:00] it's got 120 plays.

[05:04] Those people, their lives are broken.

[05:09] There was no need to get it.

[05:11] If you're not going to play your games, why get them?

[05:15] Now people say, hey, Canada, you kept your guns and roses in a box here because I didn't

[05:19] have room for it.

[05:20] But since it's been here, I've played this game a lot.

[05:23] I got to do an audit how many times I've played it, but if I had to guess, I've easily played

[05:28] guns and roses, I don't know, six, 700 times.

[05:31] When I start playing and I get a session going, at least 20 games in a row, at least.

[05:38] That's the thing too about all these new games this year is you've got people who just bought

[05:43] Evil Dead.

[05:45] They're enjoying Evil Dead.

[05:47] You got people who just bought Dune.

[05:49] You got people who just bought King Kong.

[05:51] You got some people that bought Portal.

[05:54] Now you need some people to buy Predator.

[05:56] You're going to get a lot of people to buy Harry Potter.

[05:59] So launching these games on top of each other, big mistake, big mistake by Pinball Brothers

[06:05] to launch on top of Harry Potter.

[06:08] Also a seemingly big mistake for Barrels to launch on top of a Keith Elwyn game.

[06:14] Those two games came out Dune and Kong the same exact week.

[06:20] It was like both games on that Tuesday were trying to get our attention.

[06:26] Now if what I'm hearing is accurate, we might see Harry Potter and Predator release at the

[06:33] same exact time.

[06:35] Now here's my thing.

[06:37] Every day I'm waking up now and I feel like, and maybe you feel this way too, I care less

[06:42] every single day.

[06:43] I mean this.

[06:44] There's only so much excitement and only so much energy you can apply to this stuff before

[06:53] it starts to feel a little fatiguing because it gets fatiguing hearing everybody wait and

[07:00] speculate and hear the rumors I'm hearing and then none of the rumors come true.

[07:06] Nobody's seemingly seen the game and you just want to see it.

[07:10] I do think the window, and I mean this, the window between the moment you announce the

[07:16] title and the moment you reveal the game should be no longer than four weeks.

[07:23] And the problem with all the pinball is nobody does the marketing correctly and I mean that.

[07:29] And here's what all of these companies need to wake up.

[07:33] I want to know a month out what is the day the game will be revealed.

[07:40] If you just do that then you can have a fun four week lead up to the reveal of the game.

[07:49] But nobody does that.

[07:51] They do this annoying thing where you don't know the release date, you don't know what

[07:58] time of day it's going to happen, you don't know anything until just two days or a day

[08:04] before they just pull the curtain off the game.

[08:07] And that's a big mistake.

[08:09] So let's say for example that Predator Pinball is going to be revealed to the world on Predator

[08:14] Day June 12th.

[08:16] Well why aren't you saying that?

[08:18] You give people an opportunity to get together more.

[08:22] People will have a lot more fun with your teasers if they know it's going to culminate in that

[08:28] June 12th date.

[08:30] I know when major movies come out.

[08:32] I know when major video games come out.

[08:35] I know when albums drop.

[08:37] But in the world of pinball we've got to keep everything a guarded secret just up until

[08:44] a day before it happens.

[08:46] And I think it's annoying because the problem is we already know the themes.

[08:51] We know what it's going to be and if you're going to do a teaser campaign at least make

[08:56] it something that's somewhat interesting.

[08:59] Not a picture of a polo shirt.

[09:02] Not a letter in a sealed envelope saying hey more is about to come.

[09:06] I mean that Jersey Jack letter about this is the culmination of all of our dreams and

[09:12] all of our hopes and all of our wishes.

[09:14] Come on.

[09:15] Where's the game.

[09:16] And the other thing that happens is this.

[09:19] The more you draw it out the more people's expectations start to go in a lot of different

[09:26] places.

[09:27] And this is how I feel.

[09:28] I feel like both of these games are going to underwhelm us.

[09:33] I mean that.

[09:34] I feel like both of them are going to underwhelm us.

[09:39] I feel like there's a reason both of these games are somewhat stalling.

[09:43] I don't buy it that it's just license or approval.

[09:47] I don't buy it.

[09:48] I think when both of these games get shown to the world I think the number one thing

[09:53] everyone's going to pick up on is I think both games mechanically are going to be emptier

[10:01] than you want them to be.

[10:03] I think both of them.

[10:04] I think pinball brothers don't even have the engineering ability to make stuff that's

[10:09] really really incredible.

[10:12] And I think Jersey Jack looking at their last four games they want to make games that are

[10:19] easier to manufacture.

[10:22] I don't think you're going to see all of these crazy toys in mechs.

[10:27] Where has that been over the last like eight years of this company.

[10:32] And so why now do we all of a sudden think that they're going to throw everything into

[10:39] this game when the license itself was so expensive.

[10:43] No no no I do think we're going to see upper play field.

[10:47] I do think we're probably going to see a lower play field.

[10:51] I think they're going to use layers and I think they're going to use artwork to disguise

[10:57] what is not really in the game physically.

[11:01] And this company over the last four games has replaced toys with diverters with Vox

[11:10] with other things.

[11:11] But the toys themselves the magical mechs the wow moments really they're not there.

[11:19] They're really not there in the games.

[11:23] So look I hope Harry Potter makes us all a believer.

[11:27] I hope it blows us away.

[11:29] I'm rooting for that.

[11:30] But my if I were to put my money on it my guess is that Harry Potter is going to be a lot

[11:37] more barren than people want it to be.

[11:41] I think Predator is going to be the same thing for pop bumpers really you know which real

[11:47] estate that's going to take up.

[11:49] So on top of those four pop bumpers and it's a wide body game.

[11:55] What else do you think is going to be in the game.

[11:59] Even wasn't a loaded game.

[12:01] Aliens one of these games where it didn't need to be a wide body when you actually look

[12:06] at an alien machine you're like why is this game so wide and there's so much open space

[12:13] on the game that entire play field is wide open on alien.

[12:19] Everything's happening in the back of the game.

[12:22] What I really hope for both of these games and my wish for both Potter and Predator because

[12:28] there is the greatest opportunity to create a world under glass for each of these both

[12:35] of these movies and this is why they are both really good franchises for pinball because

[12:41] they both have a very distinctive universe and world that you can put under glass.

[12:48] Harry Potter Hogwarts it's got to all be about the school.

[12:52] It's all about wizarding world.

[12:54] I mean they have a whole damn universe named after it.

[12:57] So the wizarding world needs to be under glass.

[13:01] The one thing I don't want to see in Harry Potter rainbow puke lighting all day long.

[13:07] No they need to make it feel like it's from that period.

[13:13] Candle lit lighting.

[13:14] It should not be rainbow puke.

[13:17] I'm a little worried.

[13:18] I want to see like in the windows of Hogwarts Castle.

[13:22] I want to see the flame of a candle.

[13:24] I don't want it to look like I'm walking into a casino in Las Vegas the way Godfather does

[13:31] the way all the recent games have looked it worked on Elton John because Elton John is

[13:36] a freaking 1970s psychedelic journey but on Avatar you know it's just like everything's

[13:43] just lighting up all the time on these modern games.

[13:47] I think the theme needs to dictate the lighting more.

[13:50] Predator it's a jungle.

[13:53] It should look like a jungle.

[13:55] I'm curious to see how they do that because you know what you don't find in the jungle

[13:59] ladies and gentlemen plastic.

[14:02] It's like the one thing that's the opposite of an organic world.

[14:07] And so if we look down at this predator game and it's all like flat plastics with illustrations

[14:14] of the jungle you failed.

[14:16] I'm sorry people for this much money.

[14:20] I can go on to like train forums where people build train sets and find realistic sculpts

[14:27] that look like a jungle and you're going to spend ten thousand dollars and I hope we don't

[14:32] get a flat plastic jungle.

[14:35] So if there ever was a game that just needed some sculpts and needed to feel like you're

[14:41] in this organic jungle it's predator and if there ever was a game that needed a helicopter

[14:48] a waterfall.

[14:50] It's this game.

[14:51] You need the trees.

[14:52] You need it all in there.

[14:54] You need machine gun action.

[14:55] So we will see what happens because after this right after these two games is there anything

[15:02] else we think we're going to get before we get to Stern's next game.

[15:07] The other game I'm hearing is right around the corner is another remake of Tales of the

[15:12] Arabian Knights and that is going to be from Padredy Gaming with Brian Allen on artwork.

[15:19] Now Toten is a very popular game amongst collectors and if a brand new one comes out is it going

[15:26] to do well.

[15:28] Their Funhouse remake did not do well at all.

[15:31] I'm a little worried.

[15:32] I think the reputation of quality is not there for Padredy Gaming and this is another one

[15:40] where it's like what are you waiting for.

[15:43] What are you really waiting for.

[15:44] Are you waiting for all of this money to be gobbled up by everybody else.

[15:50] And look if you have a remake of Toten just announce it just absolutely announce it and

[15:55] show it and lock in deposits because that's the thing now is these companies are all launching

[16:02] on top of each other and you either have to come out first and lock in the deposits or

[16:07] be last.

[16:08] But there's going to come a point where like everybody's just good and it's the summertime

[16:13] people.

[16:14] A lot of people now are going to start spending their disposable income on outdoor activities

[16:21] on vacations on other things.

[16:24] And I think a lot of people it's not just like they can't afford it.

[16:27] But again pinball is a winter sport.

[16:30] Do I want to be inside during the most beautiful months of this year when I could be having

[16:37] experiences that are enriching my life.

[16:41] Do I really want to buy a machine now that I know is going to lose a lot of money.

[16:48] Stick it in my game room lose two to three thousand dollars when I could have just waited

[16:54] listen to Canada buy it in the fall by then the game will be three thousand dollars cheaper.

[17:01] The code will be further along and then I'm ready to play pinball because I'm heading

[17:05] into the winter months much smarter approach.

[17:09] And that's me saying I don't think the summertime is a great time at all to launch your pinball

[17:15] machines now Stern has to launch a new game every four months.

[17:19] I get it for them.

[17:20] But isn't it crazy that all the other boutique companies in pinball think about what they're

[17:25] all doing.

[17:27] They're all launching on top of each other and only one company has carved out I think

[17:34] the best time a year to launch a pinball machine and that's December and that's what

[17:39] spooky pinball does.

[17:41] They own the month of December as the time in which they show their new game.

[17:48] No boutique companies launch on top of them and they have this amazing window to get all

[17:53] the attention all the orders without having to compete with anything else because remember

[17:59] Stern doesn't even launch then Stern's usually sometime around October and then sometime in

[18:05] February March.

[18:07] So they've carved out this nice month of December and it's winter.

[18:12] You're home for the holidays.

[18:15] You're drinking a bunch of booze and you're more likely to make an impulse decision like

[18:20] buy a pinball machine.

[18:21] That's the other thing too is like time it if I were like a marketer and I was trying

[18:25] to get pinball sales I want to release my game on a day in which I know these wealthy

[18:32] buyers are drinking alcohol.

[18:35] Give me that day and that is the best day of the year to launch your pinball machine.

[18:40] So tales of the Arabian nights do we actually think we're going to get Cuphead anytime.

[18:46] I don't even know who wants that game.

[18:49] That game is dead on arrival after that.

[18:52] Is there anything right.

[18:54] Are there any surprises coming from anywhere else.

[18:57] Supposedly this summer people are going to get their C.G.C.

[19:00] editions of the Merlin's edition of medieval madness.

[19:04] I'll believe it when I see it how many times as C.G.C. said hey we're going to ship in

[19:08] just a couple months and then it's two years later.

[19:11] So I'll believe it when I see that.

[19:13] But then what's next from C.G.C. right.

[19:15] They released Pulp Fiction over two years ago.

[19:18] Where is the next Mark Richie pin.

[19:20] Where's Halo.

[19:21] Is that going to come out.

[19:23] You know I was talking to Jason Knapp yesterday about all these rumors and it's interesting

[19:26] right because we all joke about it.

[19:28] We all kind of know the same rumors.

[19:31] Gremlins goonies back to the future.

[19:36] Star Wars Pokemon.

[19:38] I mean at this point nobody even listens anymore for rumors because we just know all this stuff.

[19:44] What we also know is that very little really has come out that we truly really want.

[19:52] That's where I think most people are at.

[19:54] I think the reason why FOMO is dead is simply the titles aren't things you truly really want.

[20:00] FOMO is going to come back when those titles hit.

[20:02] When back to the future comes out it's going to be day one sell out.

[20:06] When Beetlejuice comes out same thing FOMO day one sell out.

[20:10] If it's Gremlins or Goonies day one sell out.

[20:13] For everything else it's just going to be a really slow burn.

[20:16] It's going to be a really slow burn.

[20:18] For those of you who bought King Kong LE you know you just lost $3000.

[20:23] They're sitting.

[20:24] You can't move those games.

[20:25] There are probably at least a couple hundred King Kong LE's unsold.

[20:31] Unsold.

[20:32] It doesn't matter how much time goes by.

[20:34] I saw Retro Ralph.

[20:35] Our friend Retro Ralph is now saying that Avatar is underrated.

[20:40] What does that mean?

[20:41] It's not underrated.

[20:43] It's an underwhelming game.

[20:45] The only reason you'd walk up to it while he has one so he owns one.

[20:49] The only reason you're likely to have more fun with it is your expectations are so low.

[20:56] But it's not an underrated game.

[20:58] You know what I'm saying?

[20:59] It's not just Canada saying the game is underwhelming.

[21:02] So many people don't want that game.

[21:05] And it's not because it's better than we think it is.

[21:07] No.

[21:08] It's still an empty game.

[21:10] It's still a theme with muted clips.

[21:13] It's still a theme based on a movie that you haven't thought about since you saw it.

[21:19] It's a different world.

[21:21] Some of these newer big properties you don't really think about them that much.

[21:25] Dune is the same problem.

[21:27] We all probably went and saw the Dune movies.

[21:30] But after watching them once, you never want to go see them again.

[21:36] You don't remember the moments like you did when you saw Luke Skywalker blow up the Death

[21:42] Star or Jack Burton get on the Pork Chop Express and beat Lopan or saw the Karate Kid crane

[21:49] kick his way to the All-Valley Championship or see Marty get in the DeLorean and go 88

[21:55] miles an hour.

[21:57] These new movies just don't have it.

[21:59] I remember Predator and seeing that movie way more than I'd ever see the new Dune.

[22:05] And that's why nostalgia matters so much.

[22:09] So we shall see people.

[22:11] Will it be two weeks?

[22:13] Are we going to get two games that exceed our expectations?

[22:17] Or are they going to be what Canada thinks?

[22:20] Are they going to be two games that underwhelm us and are a little a day late and a dollar

[22:25] short on getting the frenzy going?

[22:28] We shall see.

[22:29] I hope they prove me wrong.

[22:31] Balls in their court.

[22:33] But they've been making us wait too long to see these games.

[22:37] And I think it's going to impact people's reaction to both games.

[22:41] Canada out.
