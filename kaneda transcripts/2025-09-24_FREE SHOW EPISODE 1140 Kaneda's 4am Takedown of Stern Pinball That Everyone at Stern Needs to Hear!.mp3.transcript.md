[00:00] Hey, there, Pinball fans, Jack Diger, here,

[00:01] from stirringpinball, we are at the Rocky Mountain Pinball Showdown

[00:04] for the global release of Star Wars, follow the empire,

[00:08] let's go check this game out,

[00:09] are there any standouts on this game

[00:10] that you think are doing it for you?

[00:12] I kind of like the Death Star, shoot, it's tight,

[00:15] it's kind of hard to hit, I kind of like the Death Star,

[00:17] shoot, it's tight, it's kind of hard to hit,

[00:20] I kind of like the Death Star, shoot,

[00:21] it's tight, it's kind of hard to hit,

[00:24] I kind of like the Death Star, shoot, it's tight,

[00:27] it's kind of hard to hit,

[00:29] Oh, welcome to canade is pinball podcast the only pinball podcast or whose heart is bigger

[00:49] than a wide body it is 440 in the morning and you know how canada does it when i don't

[00:54] sleep i wake up with clarity i wake up and i see this pinball world exactly the way it

[01:00] is and i wake up i go on facebook and i see this piece of content by stern pinball trying

[01:06] to sell me on the new star wars game and i decide to watch it and there you have it people

[01:12] you've got jack danger in a sling walking up to a guy to give the first ever testimonial

[01:19] of the first ever gameplay at the first ever reveal of the global biggest ip in the history of

[01:25] stern pinball and the guy can only utter i kind of like the death star shot it's tight it's kind

[01:32] of hard to hit how is that how is that the first stern pinball marketing material hitting us in

[01:41] the world to help sell this game and i know it's just a little sound bite but it's more than that

[01:49] it's so much more than that there is a bigger context happening here and for me i take some of

[01:55] this a little bit personally first and foremost pinball is probably the most famous sport in the

[02:01] entire world well i don't know about that but it's one of the most famous games in which

[02:06] everybody understands how to play it you need both hands on the flipper buttons to keep the ball alive

[02:13] and you're going to send our friend jack danger with one arm in a sling who can't play to be the

[02:20] sort of ambassador to sell this game i'm sorry i'm sorry john borg you made this game jack danger

[02:27] didn't make this game john borg you made this game this game is not great jack danger could make a

[02:34] much better game than this and jack danger should be with his other arm that is working he should be

[02:41] hitting send on his resume going over to jersey jack pinball i'm gonna say this right now and this is

[02:49] like i'm this is coming from the heart and this is just a truth bomb there is going to be a small

[02:54] window by which some of these people over at stern pinball should be looking for their next gig and

[03:02] i don't mean because they're gonna get fired i don't mean because stern is gonna end anytime soon i

[03:06] don't mean it i just mean that some of these talented people their talents might be best utilized

[03:14] somewhere else but i think what's gonna happen is this i think a lot of them and i mean this jack

[03:19] danger keith elwin will always have a home it's like wherever keith wants to go he could lamp but i

[03:24] just you know i just feel like these guys you know they love pinball so much and they got absorbed

[03:30] by the biggest pinball company in the world that for the longest time was making the best pinball

[03:37] in the world and they were and nobody would deny that i've been covering this hobby for 12 years

[03:43] when i got into this hobby the games before my sort of like introduction to pinball were like the

[03:50] best games were stern pinball games my first game was a lord of the rings designed by george gomez

[03:58] that is still one of the greatest theme integrated pins of all time it's still one of the greatest

[04:03] stern pinball machines of all time the game came out i want to say in 2004 that was 21 years ago

[04:14] this company was capable of making lord of the rings and this is the thing everybody 21 years

[04:21] later 21 years later all of their knowledge everything they have all the resources all the

[04:28] money all the facilities all the talent 21 years later they make this crappy star wars

[04:39] does portia put out a car 21 years later that is slower that doesn't lap nirboring faster that

[04:48] doesn't have enhancements this is the problem this is the problem when you talk about fall of the

[04:55] empire and you talk about a company that's lost its way this is how it ends up it's like they just

[05:03] can't even hide it anymore they can't even hide it anymore and it really pains me because you know

[05:10] this company when i went over there a year ago and i met with seth and i met with george and i

[05:15] met with gary and my speech to them was very from the heart it was very passionate and i treated them

[05:22] as if i would treat any of my clients that run billion dollar businesses and i said to them

[05:28] job number one of your company job number one is to win back the people you are losing to win back

[05:36] the core pinball buyer not the tournament player not the league night player that your marketing

[05:43] guy zack sharp is focused on because that's who he cares about no your job is to win back the people

[05:49] that have kept this company afloat for the last like 15 years and it's the collector it's the

[05:56] dude that wants to put the pinball machine in his home and you've made moves recently that have shown

[06:02] those people you don't care you've done a lot of silly bonehead it moves and so now starting today

[06:09] let's win those people back and let's make that the number one strategy of this company

[06:15] how do we do that both with the games we make but more so with the moves we make as a brand

[06:23] that was a year ago a year ago in march they hired a new cmo has he even said hi to you just think

[06:32] about that has he even said hi i'm new here i'm the chief marketing officer at stern you don't get

[06:41] the hide this is too small of a hobby and it's not hard to reach the people more people know who

[06:50] neil mcray is than the new stern cmo that's a problem by the way where is neil he's missing in

[06:59] after he was shilling star wars now he's nowhere to be found he's crawled back into his multimillion

[07:05] dollar like little game room and he doesn't have anything to say about this game that's got a kind

[07:12] of hard to hit kind of tight death star shot that's how we're gonna sell this game i feel like ruby rod

[07:20] like can you give me a little bit more excitement corbin like what is this you have like a two word

[07:24] vocabulary so stern pinball a year ago that was my message to them and if we've looked at this

[07:32] company over the last year have they done anything anything have they made a single move that was

[07:39] targeted and i don't just mean about the games but as a company a single move that showed they wanted

[07:47] to win back the pinball buying community the new inbox collector not a single move when i walked

[07:55] into that conference room i had one question for george for gary for set have you ever done

[08:02] anything special for somebody that has bought a quarter million dollars of your product just think

[08:10] about that for someone who has bought a quarter million dollars of your product have you ever done

[08:16] anything special and there was silence they looked at me and they knew the answer was no

[08:23] and you know why they've never done anything for people like bill brandis even people like neil

[08:29] mcray they've never done anything special out of the ordinary for any of these individuals you know

[08:36] why kim mitchell maybe only ed robertson has gotten something special when they gave him a supreme

[08:43] machine i don't think he was online like the rest of us but the reason why is simply this

[08:50] they don't look at any of us like the customer to them the person who spent a quarter million

[08:57] dollars or more are the distributors so yeah they've done something what they thought was special for

[09:04] those customers the distributors they handed them another elvira le they re ran Jurassic park le

[09:13] they made more james bond toppers they priced james bond 60th at 20k all of those moves think about

[09:21] that all of the moves they've ever done have been to say thank you to the distros at the cost of the

[09:29] consumer and i'm just here to tell you right now at 449 in the morning this is why stern pinball

[09:36] is headed off the cliff and yes they are not too big to fail if you think this is a humongous company

[09:44] you are not right i mean they might be a hundred million dollar a year company maybe a little bit

[09:50] more but that's not that big go look at some real publicly traded companies and it makes me sad it

[09:57] makes me sad because i don't know why stern pinball not even about the games people not even about the

[10:04] mediocrity of star wars it's not even about that it's about as a company and as a brand they cannot

[10:12] make that shift over to seeing the buyer not being the dealer in the distro they are still stuck

[10:20] in a 30 or 40 year old model and as long as they're stuck there and as long as they have an inability

[10:27] to connect with the community and the home buyer they are going to continue to falter and they are

[10:33] faltering what was the last big stern hit what was the last stern le that got you excited what was

[10:40] the last time unboxing a stern made anybody feel any sense of envy or fomo and you think about it i

[10:47] mean i was thinking about this the other day the last stern le that was really a wow was ghostbusters

[10:52] i mean it was freaking ghostbusters godzilla le wasn't a wow james bond wasn't a wow venom wasn't a

[10:58] wow dnd wasn't a wow kinkong wasn't a wow uh you know star wars is not a wow john wick was not a

[11:05] wow i mean you can keep naming game after game that's not a wow and yet those are all 13 000

[11:12] dollar games and we all know the the harsh reality almost all of those lees are going to be worth

[11:19] eight thousand dollars in just a short amount of time five thousand dollar losses per game

[11:27] and we're not supposed to talk like this and if we talk like this you know i have people on my

[11:31] facebook being like what's wrong with you canada don't you like fun what's fun about losing five

[11:36] thousand dollars what's fun about having a pinball company out of touch with its own customer base

[11:42] why doesn't anybody else talk about this you know i don't understand it it's like there's a reason why

[11:48] we have such a compelling audience on canada's pinball podcast and you look the only way stern

[11:53] is gonna get better is if we talk like this like hey stern is it mark the new cmo mark wake up say hi

[12:00] to the community you don't get to hide you look like a really attractive guy you're much taller

[12:05] and handsomer than canada say something make a video make a live hey i'm happy to be the new chief

[12:11] marketing officer at stern i would love to hear from each and every one of you know you know what

[12:15] he's probably trying to do how do we grow pinball in china how do we grow pinball here how do we grow

[12:21] pinball with gen z how do we do this all behind the scenes all behind the scenes and what this company

[12:26] continues to fail and i said it to george i'll say it to gary i'll say it to everybody the only way

[12:33] you're ever gonna grow pinball is you're going to treat the people that actually care better and

[12:40] you're gonna have them invite just one of their friends if each one of us that loves pinball so

[12:46] much just invited one new friend into the hobby you would double the size of the hobby i'm into

[12:53] pinball i've got all these millionaire friends in connecticut most of them don't buy pinball so you

[12:59] should be incentivizing me i'm gonna reach those people more than crappy facebook ads from dealers

[13:06] and distros spamming people that need to be introduced in a different way the greatest content

[13:13] you can ever show someone new to get them to buy a pinball machine isn't crappy facebook ads it is

[13:21] showing what it looks like in a home it is articulating to people that this is the most amazing

[13:27] piece of furniture you could ever put in your home because of the hours of fun it will give you

[13:34] your family your kids i mean when you think about it i hear so many stories about people that say i

[13:40] inherited a pinball machine from my grandfather like let's keep that legacy alive you don't see

[13:46] any of that it's just jack danger walking up in a sling getting a guy that kind of likes a shot

[13:52] that's kind of tight that's kind of hard to hit and your marketing department is doing the same

[13:56] old thing every single day and you're expecting different results this company needs a hard reset

[14:02] i shouldn't have to tell them this at five in the morning i'm about to go to the gym you guys

[14:06] need a hard reset you need a hard reset you've got great people you're gonna lose your talent

[14:11] you're gonna lose jack danger and when you lose keith elwin it's over like i mean this if keith elwin

[14:17] walked at a stern tomorrow it would literally be over think about it would you would you stay

[14:25] supporting a brand if they lost the most valuable thing happening in the company right now which is

[14:31] really it's not one dude and the reason why keith doesn't walk is truly this he knows it's not just

[14:38] him but he's the face of it all like he leads a big team that he would probably say are way more

[14:44] talented than him making his ideas come to fruition but it's more about what the symbol is of keith elwin

[14:53] leaving if jack danger left think about what that would do jack has been the face of pinball for so

[15:00] long we love jack no one ever has a bad thing to say about jack and he goes over to stern and it

[15:06] literally and emotionally you can tell it broke the man the damn job broke the man when i walked

[15:12] through there a year ago an x-man was just out and he was taking a beating they forced it out early

[15:18] they gave him the worst coder at stern and it just like beat him down i mean he physically looked

[15:25] like a couple years have been taken off his life and i love jack and i didn't want to see him like

[15:31] that nobody wants to see him like that again all of this i think all of this can be fixed if stern

[15:38] pinball stops and calls a time out and resets things a little bit not even a lot just a little bit

[15:47] they need to reset what the company strategy is they need to get back to what made them so

[15:56] beloved by everybody and look we always had complaints here and there they weren't always

[16:01] universally beloved but they were so far ahead of everybody else and it doesn't feel that way anymore

[16:09] and now the competition is so far ahead of stern in the emotional places in the transparency

[16:18] in the feel good nature of the brand and i think stern pinball the problem now is

[16:24] because the games have been mediocre and everything else has been like not great it really is a

[16:31] double whammy you know you know what i'm saying it's like you got a new star wars game out in the

[16:36] world and the designers not even out there selling it you've got a company with an entire

[16:41] marketing department i mean i heard something like stern has 90 employees 90 employees that are not on

[16:48] the line like these are people just in offices in cubicles 90 people spooky pinball doesn't have that

[16:55] many people and look what they're cranking out and when you get so big and then you have so many

[17:00] committees of people making decisions i'll tell you what that does to the people with the good ideas

[17:07] i'll tell you what that does to the creativity you know i spoke to zombie eddie recently i can

[17:12] tell it's not the same zombie eddie you know he's stressed out he's trying to change things he's

[17:16] trying to move this big ship and of course he's frustrated with canada because i'm frustrated

[17:21] with the products they're putting out and i'm frustrated with how the art direction is going

[17:26] and now he's part of the big system he's not free he doesn't have the same vibes when i speak to

[17:32] christopher franci it's the complete opposite he's loving life he loves where he's at he can't wait

[17:38] for us to see his next game i don't hear anybody from stern saying that because the truth is they

[17:44] know what the walking dead remastered looks like they know it's not going to be worth twice the

[17:50] amount of money that the original walking dead was and they know that spike three when they turn

[17:56] it all on is going to come with a price increase i mean how are you going to increase the price of

[18:02] your product in a time when demand might be the lowest it's been in about five years and this

[18:08] is the problem and they put themselves in this box they all did and i think they need a hard reset

[18:16] gary seth george this is your moment to reset things to open up a little bit more it's not

[18:24] going to work you're not going to design your way out of this you actually need a new strategy

[18:31] and your strategy is not working and i love you guys and i think you guys can do it but man this

[18:39] game is ironically titled it feels like a metaphor for what all of you are going through over there

[18:46] i know people that work at stern listen to this show and i know it's probably hard because nobody's

[18:52] speaking on your behalf if you're working over at stern and you want to see these things happen

[18:57] it doesn't help that canada shows behind a paywall more people should hear this so i'm going to make

[19:03] this show free so you can pass this around and say hey look look at what canada's saying about our

[19:08] company maybe he's right maybe we need to get back to what made us great giving people the best

[19:14] value in pinball maybe that stopped when we started charging two thousand dollars for toppers

[19:20] maybe we became jerks when we started rerunning le's maybe we should listen to people why can't we

[19:25] just make more ghostbusters toppers why are we doing this to our customers like this topper only

[19:31] cost a few hundred bucks to make why are we seeing people trade them for three thousand dollars that's

[19:36] not good we don't want people to see a cheap plastic ghostbusters topper be selling for three

[19:43] thousand dollars i don't want to see this kiss topper let's make more of these we're never going to

[19:48] make more a lees but we never said the topper was exclusive so why are we doing this to our own

[19:54] customers why are we making our distros high on the hog while our customers are losing their shirts

[20:01] if we keep going this way everyone's gonna lose in the end because we're gonna run out of customers

[20:07] and then distros are gonna have nobody to sell our games to and star wars the biggest ip should

[20:14] have been a game where we brought all of our talent in on the game how are we gonna give

[20:18] keith elwin the greatest pinball designer in the world maybe in the history of pinball how are we

[20:25] gonna give keith elwin king kong and not star wars what are we doing if we're gonna make petty

[20:32] internal political decisions that don't have the best interest of the customer in mind we will fail

[20:39] as a company and stern pinball seemingly is making moves like that siloed moves jack danger when he

[20:46] came out of the gate his game was beloved everybody loves jack how are we gonna stick a coder and a

[20:53] code team on his game that nobody is in demand for how are we gonna do this to jack is that how

[21:00] we're gonna pay him back he has done one of the most creative layouts ever for us it's incredible

[21:06] and the code and the software needs to be equally as ambitious and incredible these are the kinds of

[21:13] things we need to do and the only way you're gonna do that stern is if you slow down it's like your

[21:19] whole company i mean yeah you're living what gary always says it's like you're a manufacturing company

[21:24] that doesn't care you just need things on the line every single day and that may be true but the best

[21:32] way to have your line always going is if you green light back to the future and say no to venom

[21:40] the best way you're gonna keep that line going every single day and everyone's having a good time

[21:46] is if you make beetle juice and don't make john wick and the best way you're gonna bulletproof the

[21:52] future of stern pinball is if you listen to each and every one of us and you haven't listened very

[21:57] much and you need to get on it all right i'm gonna end this show real quick addressing this big bang

[22:03] bar like oh canada's sharing fake photos so i'll give you the truth this game is one of the prototypes

[22:10] that was made and handed off to paredrety gaming in their efforts to remake big bang bar so it's not

[22:16] fake like none of my photos are fake this game was being remade changes were made to the game

[22:23] it was handed to paredrety gaming who are now remaking the game and they were given a prototype

[22:28] of what their version of big bang bar could be the photos are not fake i have video of the game

[22:35] itself i've seen changes made to the game and by the way there have been some positive changes to

[22:41] the game that were super cool that paredrety gaming doesn't want to implement and so yeah

[22:48] i think the reason they're mad is that nobody is like yeah man i hope paredrety gaming makes big

[22:55] bang bar you would much rather have dutch pinball do the remake of big bang bar and screw that game

[23:02] together so yeah the photos are real but they're real photos of a prototype of a game that's being

[23:08] now made 100 by paredrety gaming so yes melvin williams is not involved in the remake with

[23:15] paredrety gaming that's a bad thing that's not a good thing trust me they should have listened

[23:22] to my boy all right everybody so that's how it's going and they're just mad because canada's spoiled

[23:27] the reveal five o'clock in the morning i'm gonna hit the gym then i'm gonna come home i'm gonna edit

[23:32] this show let me edit this show right now and then go to the gym because the kids don't get up for an

[23:37] hour and a half canada out with another early morning take down it's a take down i'm gonna take

[23:42] you out you break down like white is a take down i'm gonna take you out and an eight-seventh

[23:47] is that i'm gonna cut you open lose control and bring out your heart you'll be begging and crying

[23:52] i'm gonna take you down

[24:08] take it down
