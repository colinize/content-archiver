[00:00] Well, thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little bit different than you and I have fear.

[00:03] Yeah, I know. There are a lot worse.

[00:05] I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here.

[00:09] It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

[00:13] You know, you read what others had done and you took the next step.

[00:17] You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it.

[00:22] You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could,

[00:27] and before you even knew it had, you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox,

[00:33] and now you're selling it. You're selling it.

[00:35] Well, yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could,

[00:39] they didn't stop to think of the issue.

[00:44] I think that I've been overwhelmed in being delayed by the time we launch in March of next year, about a year.

[00:52] You know, sometimes I struggle to find that passion still for pinball.

[00:56] No, when I left Penside in July, it was probably the greatest thing that I've ever done in pinball this far.

[01:04] It's an absolute sewer. I want nothing to do with it, so any report I get from Penside a immediately disregard.

[01:11] All of our games, and today, you know, we went over the first 21 games that we have planned over the next few years.

[01:17] We haven't sat around on our hands the last few years and just done Raza.

[01:22] We've been very busy. I think that it's going to help make each of these titles that come out the best that they are for what they're meant to be.

[01:30] And we understand that's not going to come out just yet until launch.

[01:34] And, you know, everyone can see why we're doing what we're doing.

[01:37] I promised a lot, and I think over time a lot will be delivered.

[01:42] I don't think that we're going to launch Raza and sell, you know, thousands of Raza's, you know, that's just not going to happen.

[01:49] It is a more niche game.

[01:51] It's not lost on us that Raza is a very unique start, and it's not meant to launch, you know, different suddenly make us, you know, profitable and pay back all the years of our D.

[02:03] It's not what it's meant to do.

[02:05] And Jeremy is a great 2D artist with strong lines and stuff like that.

[02:10] And so what we tried to do, tried to pay homage to what he started, but changed the world and the narrative as we needed to do to,

[02:17] as we continued to develop the Raza world.

[02:20] Before we were going to go with Mirko, I'll just be honest with you, but after the latest Viasco, I just can't trust.

[02:27] It's not just Mirko, right? I know he's trying, and he's got a really nice process set up.

[02:33] It's a whole recipe of issues, but we can't let that happen with Deeper.

[02:39] It's got to be brought in house. It's got to be done right.

[02:42] In fact, when we got the Mirko boards, and one of them was at Houston, they pulled them out, and you could still smell the clear, and I said,

[02:48] give me a hammer. And I took a hammer to it, and oh my goodness, it was the crater. It was just a crater.

[02:54] I mean, there was no missing it. I then took out one of Sean's test playfields and slammed it with a hammer and not a dip.

[03:03] You couldn't even see that I hit it.

[03:06] And I can tell you from the first time we plunged a ball on the Mirko boards, or you plunge it on a spooky game, a stirring game, an AP game, or anything, you're going to get instant dimples.

[03:16] With our playfields, we basically with hammer don't even get a dimple. We don't get a scratch, we don't get a scuff, we don't get anything.

[03:24] That's the type of deeper quality that we want to provide.

[03:28] I guarantee you pull any manufacturer right now, whether they're doing it in house or not, and you drop a ball from three inches, which is probably less than what the strongest strike could be.

[03:40] Every one of them will dimple. And I'm sorry, that's an engineering defect, and Deepridge is not going to put up with that, and we're just going to be different.

[03:47] And we'll let them continue to turn those playfields out, whether they do them in house, or whether they try to engineer better, and we hope they do.

[03:55] Deepridge will be different, and I'm baking my company on those types of values and quality propositions for consumers.

[04:04] There are no investors in pinball. It's company money, it's my money, and I find that even when people say, well, oh my gosh, they're blowing all this a month, and they're never going to be able to make a packet.

[04:17] I just laugh because it's obvious that the more they try to convince themselves and others about all of this, the less they are in reality.

[04:26] There's some other universe, and you know, at the end of the day, it's not their money.

[04:31] Dinosaur and Ben has some great designs coming. I know he really wants them to see the light of day, and they will very shortly.

[04:37] And, you know, Asselaer's just a machine. I mean, if he, if I let him loose, he could create a pinball machine design every month.

[04:46] It's not like we're just, you know, spouting off and taking cheap shots. We're going to walk the walk, and I think that most of what we're going to show on our launch day is going to be point after point after point after point where we saw a weakness or something that the competition refused to fix or do, and we're doing it.

[05:06] At the end of the day, I take some shots at him, and I think some of them they write out deserve.

[05:13] I really haven't bought a lot of Starns. I really haven't been really motivated by a lot of what they've done and impressed by a lot of what they've done to really go out and buy it.

[05:24] I mean, some of their artworks are nice, but I'm not going to buy a pinball machine for artwork.

[05:28] Starn is completely weak. Their model is very precarious, and I know that they'll completely laugh, but when you build up a structure like that, you get weaker and weaker when that structure can't continue to be fed in the same way that you've planned.

[05:46] The bigger you get, the easier it is to fall. It's like building house of cards with an unsteady foundation, right? Labor costs, fixed costs, park costs.

[05:57] Those are very, very painful when you have a throttling and a variability of sales.

[06:04] You see that with a lot of not only there, but with JGP as well, and why they suddenly brought out these new titles or rehashed old titles and brought them out new and why they suddenly brought something out early and stuff.

[06:16] You just see that in their actions, right?

[06:19] And so what we want to do is we don't even want to worry about that because we're focused on a very different value proposition.

[06:25] I'm not going to take credit for much in deep root because I have an amazing staff, people in Texas, and in Utah, and contractors across the country that do an amazing job.

[06:36] But at the end of the day, there has to be the captain. There has to be the someone that understands the buck stops here that is willing to say no, and is willing to say yes.

[06:47] And is basically there to motivate people and to threaten people, right? To challenge people and to reward people.

[06:55] And that at this point has landed on my desk. And sometimes it's very difficult and sometimes it's very easy.

[07:03] But it doesn't take away from the very talented people in every aspect of a deeper tech and deeper pinball and deeper studios that are pounding out amazing things on a daily basis and that have passion.

[07:15] Nobody understands how we work and the more they try to act like they're the experts on everything, the more I laugh because the more wrong and ass and nine they sound.

[07:26] So look, I have a lot of criticisms of our competition, but I know how hard pinball can be behind the scenes. And I respect them and all the artists and the designers and the people who put so much work in effort.

[07:42] And so what we want to do is we want to be profitable on every title. You know, I'm not really worried. I hope Stern continues to pound it and continues to sell the best they can and JTP and spooky.

[07:52] I don't see any benefits anybody for those companies going out of business or for a deeper to come in and crush them.

[08:00] I think that there's still plenty of a market and an opportunity for each of these companies to make the best star in argument they can to consumers and continue to innovate and to pound it.

[08:09] And I hope they, when they see what we have, I hope that they go, wow, we need to catch up.

[08:30] You
