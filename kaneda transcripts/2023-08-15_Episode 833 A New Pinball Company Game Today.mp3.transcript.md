[00:00] A new pinball company is gonna release a new game today on Brenda's birthday.

[00:09] I don't believe it.

[00:10] Hit the drums.

[00:11] Oh, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:28] Here we are, Tuesday, August 15th, and I'm hearing that today a new pinball company is

[00:33] gonna throw their hat into the ring with a new game.

[00:36] I'm also hearing this game is gonna blow us away.

[00:38] Oh yeah, we haven't heard that before.

[00:40] Now look, this raises so many freaking questions.

[00:43] I don't even know where to begin.

[00:45] I mean, question number one, who's gonna make this game?

[00:49] Every time we see a new pinball company throw their hat into the ring, it's the manufacturing

[00:54] where they stumble.

[00:56] So who's gonna make this game?

[00:57] Is it gonna be Prodretti Gaming over in Europe?

[00:59] Is it gonna be someone in the United States?

[01:02] Now the only way I could see this even working, like in any possibility, is if they're gonna

[01:06] do a really low number of games, a la like Dutch Pinball, like maybe 50 games a freaking

[01:12] month, but we know large scale manufacturing is impossible in pinball, and if I'm hearing

[01:19] this is gonna be a take my money now kind of game, well what happens if they get a few

[01:24] hundred orders?

[01:25] What happens if they get a few thousand orders?

[01:28] How are they gonna make these freaking things?

[01:31] And so look, do we think this is gonna happen?

[01:33] And I'm getting this from one of my most reliable sources that today is the day.

[01:38] Who's it gonna be?

[01:39] Is this gonna be that mystery game?

[01:41] You know that company that's been leaving all those weird cryptic clues around all the

[01:45] pinball shows with like a flipper and lightning bolts coming from it and something amazing

[01:50] is coming soon in the world of pinball?

[01:52] August 15th is a perfect time to release a game.

[01:55] Let's talk about that for a minute.

[01:56] Is now even a good time to come out with a new pinball company and a new pinball game?

[02:02] Oh, if you kinda look at the market, it's not really that bad of a time.

[02:07] None of the pulp fictions are being made.

[02:09] Venom is like a sales dud right now.

[02:11] Godfather and Galactic Tank Force are on like life support.

[02:15] I mean it doesn't matter if like the American pinball crew wants to now go on podcasts

[02:20] after people haven't been buying this game for three months, they're not gonna change

[02:24] people's minds.

[02:25] It's not gonna work.

[02:26] We've played the game, we've seen the airballs, we know the game is about ice cream and tanks

[02:32] and whatnot and cheap 3D printed parts.

[02:34] They're not gonna win people over with that sales pitch.

[02:37] It's too late.

[02:38] They had three years to get the game right.

[02:39] But you're not here to hear me rag on Galactic Tank Force again.

[02:43] So look, that game has been a failure.

[02:45] Godfather's been a failure.

[02:47] Venom is not lighting the sales charts on fire.

[02:49] So it's not really a bad time to show what you got.

[02:53] Because if you wait too long and you get into that window of Keith Elwin's next game, because

[02:58] right now we all know what's gonna happen.

[03:00] When we get into like fall of 2023, everything's gonna slide into that black hole vortex as

[03:06] we wait for Keith Elwin's jaws and everyone's gonna hold their money in their wallets until

[03:12] they see that game.

[03:13] So who is making this game?

[03:15] I mean the amount of questions goes so far beyond just who's manufacturing it.

[03:20] What is the theme?

[03:21] Do they have money to get a real licensed contemporary theme people want?

[03:26] Is it gonna be a remake of something that came out a while ago?

[03:30] Is this possibly gonna be when we hear that Twilight Zone is coming back or Big Bang Bar?

[03:36] I'll say it right now.

[03:37] If it's one of those two games, I get they will sell a handful of them, maybe a couple

[03:41] hundred, but I won't be excited because we've seen those games.

[03:45] Those games have been out for like 20 plus years, 25, 30 years.

[03:49] So I think everybody here, what we really want, let's be honest everybody, stare in

[03:52] the mirror, be like, Canada, you're the best 60 bucks a year I can spend on this show.

[03:57] You know freaking Neil McCray, friend of the show.

[03:59] He's on my Facebook page every day.

[04:01] The man bought three James Bond 60th editions, three of them.

[04:06] The man has like items from outer space that cost tens of thousands of dollars.

[04:11] I think hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe even a million dollars and he won't

[04:14] subscribe to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[04:17] Neil, I love you.

[04:18] People are gonna say I talked about you and I did.

[04:20] 60 bucks a year, man.

[04:22] That's like just a couple gallons of gas and the cars you're pushing my friend.

[04:25] All right, but let's get back to that staring in the mirror.

[04:27] So if you stare in the mirror and you say to yourself, what do we really want in the

[04:30] world of pinball?

[04:31] Who, if anyone's gonna start a pinball company today, who do we want them to mirror?

[04:36] But mirror in a way that does it right.

[04:38] Do you want another spooky pinball?

[04:40] No you don't.

[04:41] Do you want another home pin?

[04:43] No you don't.

[04:44] Do you want another Jersey Jack pinball?

[04:45] No you don't.

[04:46] The one company that you really want another of is Dutch Pinball, but if they do it right.

[04:51] That is in my mind, the only company that's been a boutique company that really elevated

[04:57] and made a game that can hold its own against what the other companies with the huge resources

[05:02] are putting into the pinball landscape.

[05:04] But look, Big Lebowski came out a decade ago and look, I'm excited for Barry's next

[05:09] game, but if we're gonna see a new pinball company, I don't want to see them remake old

[05:14] games.

[05:15] I want them to come out with something new, something magical, something that's gonna

[05:18] wow us, but then the questions just keep flooding back.

[05:22] Like who's gonna code this game and make it great?

[05:25] It's not easy to code your first game and make it a magical pinball software experience.

[05:30] Who's gonna design the game?

[05:32] Like which designers are available to make a new game for a new company?

[05:36] Is it gonna be a brand new designer?

[05:39] Is it gonna be someone we haven't heard of before?

[05:41] Now who's gonna do the artwork in this game?

[05:44] Is it gonna be a new artist?

[05:45] You know there's a lot of artists out there in the world.

[05:48] It's not like we can only get stuff from Yeti and Franchi.

[05:50] There are many people out there with the skill, with the pen.

[05:54] And so look who's gonna do it and then who's gonna manufacture these games?

[05:58] Do they have a line up and running?

[06:01] If they reveal a game today and they don't have like games on the line or games in boxes,

[06:07] people are gonna laugh at them.

[06:09] So look if there is gonna be a reveal today, I really hope for the sake of this company

[06:13] so we don't laugh them out of the room, they already have games made because there is no

[06:18] point anymore in 2023 of revealing your intentions to make a pinball machine.

[06:25] We have seen this rodeo so many times.

[06:27] Oh yeah, we're gonna do this.

[06:29] We're gonna remake Kingpin.

[06:31] We're gonna do Predator.

[06:32] We're gonna do this.

[06:33] And we're gonna turn all of you into investors and kick starters, not into buyers of a product.

[06:40] The only way this will work is if this company can take your money and send you a game right

[06:45] now.

[06:46] And then you're gonna have another haggis situation where you say, hey, we're gonna

[06:48] do this.

[06:49] We're gonna ship games in just two months and we're gonna be done by the end of the

[06:52] year.

[06:53] And that was two years ago.

[06:55] And now they're telling people the containers fall.

[06:57] Oh, come on.

[06:58] Are you serious?

[06:59] We have a company that could not fill a container for freaking two years.

[07:03] Now Damien is telling people the container is full.

[07:06] So let me ask him a question then.

[07:08] So if the containers fall and the container can hold 40 or 50 machines, Damien, how about

[07:14] this?

[07:15] Take a picture of 40 FAB the machines in boxes in your warehouse.

[07:19] I challenge you to do that.

[07:20] He's not gonna do it.

[07:21] He doesn't have a container full.

[07:22] He's just telling people that, oh, you can't get on this container because it's full.

[07:26] Now you gotta pay the $1,800 to ship the game to you.

[07:30] This is the one place where we're not gonna fall for it.

[07:32] We're not gonna fall for it, people.

[07:33] I love this hobby because every time someone tries to do something new, Canada is your watchdog.

[07:39] He's your consumer advocate.

[07:41] I am on your side.

[07:42] Look, I want more magical pinball.

[07:44] Out there.

[07:45] I do.

[07:46] I want more worlds under glass.

[07:47] I do.

[07:48] I don't want RPG games like Venom.

[07:49] I know Venom is fun to shoot, but it's not worth the money.

[07:51] Everybody knows that.

[07:52] You know that.

[07:53] Look at what's happening with James Bond 60th.

[07:55] Let's talk about this for a minute.

[07:56] When that game came out, other content creators were saying Stern priced it right at $19,000.

[08:01] $19,000.

[08:02] $20,000.

[08:03] You know why they said that?

[08:05] Because distributors were buying that game from Stern for $15,000.

[08:09] So all of those distros who were shilling that game, they thought they were gonna make

[08:13] $5,000 profit on every single one they sold.

[08:17] What has happened now?

[08:18] We just saw someone list it for sale for $12,999.

[08:22] So $13,000.

[08:24] So if you bought it on day one from Stern, are you sitting down?

[08:28] Stern with tax was $22,000.

[08:32] So you just lost $9,000 on a game in less than a year.

[08:38] This is the biggest lead balloon release in the history of pinball.

[08:42] And I'm so tired of all the Stern fanboys who are super rich, who are justifying the

[08:47] gameplay, equaling the cost of this game.

[08:50] At what point does the data speak volumes?

[08:53] And now you know what their new thing is after they're seeing this game plummet like a lead

[08:57] balloon.

[08:58] Now they're all saying, well, you know, it's just right now.

[09:01] Like way too more people play it.

[09:02] This is gonna be the most sought after game ever.

[09:05] And then in the same sentence, they're like, I love this game so much, but I'm willing

[09:09] to sell it to you for a tremendous loss.

[09:11] Oh yeah, sure, sure you do.

[09:13] Look, I get the game shoots well.

[09:14] There's no screen.

[09:16] There's nothing iconic happening in that game.

[09:18] You're telling me you want to rip spinners for $20,000 because all of our eyes work.

[09:24] Like we've all woken up in 2023.

[09:26] Anyone can look down at that James Bond 60th and you know exactly what's going on with

[09:31] that game.

[09:32] The Sterns bill of materials is probably less than $5,000 on that machine.

[09:36] I guarantee you it is less than $5,000 on that machine.

[09:40] And now all of a sudden they want to charge you $20,000 and then they want to hide from

[09:44] that cost and we're on to them.

[09:46] We're all on to them.

[09:47] So many more people are waiting and seeing you're waiting this stuff out.

[09:51] I mean, look what's happening with these Godfather at least.

[09:53] It's like these people are delusional.

[09:55] Now you have people who opened up the game.

[09:58] They bought it before playing it and now they're trying to sell in open deli for like 11, 5,

[10:04] 11, 5.

[10:05] When brand new the game is 12, but here's the problem.

[10:09] You can march into a dealer today and offer them 10, 5 on the table and they will take

[10:15] it because they will take whatever they can get just to move that game on.

[10:20] So the climate is there for a new game and a new pinball company to do something that's

[10:24] going to wow us.

[10:26] The problem is this 90% of the time what has happened?

[10:30] Have we been wowed?

[10:32] Have we been impressed?

[10:33] Have those companies delivered the goods?

[10:36] No, 9 out of 10 times.

[10:38] It's a failure.

[10:39] It's a boondoggle.

[10:40] It's all this like bait and switch marketing and then nothing comes to fruition.

[10:45] And then you spend years waiting for the game you paid for years go by.

[10:49] The communication from the company is so jovial when they launch.

[10:53] And then when you want to know where your product is, it's radio silent.

[10:57] I mean we've all seen this movie so many times.

[11:00] There are about 15 companies right now that are legitimately calling themselves pinball

[11:06] companies 15.

[11:08] How many of them on an annual basis actually execute?

[11:12] Like four of them.

[11:13] And what is going to happen is going to happen brutally fast as we go into 2024.

[11:18] As the prices of everything go up, as more and more of us are being much more cautious

[11:23] with how we spend our money.

[11:24] It doesn't matter how much money you have.

[11:25] What is going to happen and it's going to happen brutally fast.

[11:29] We are no longer going to be buying two to three games a year.

[11:32] You are going to be selective.

[11:33] You are going to buy a game only if you really want it.

[11:36] That means an entire year might go by and you might not buy anything new in box.

[11:41] And that's freaking okay.

[11:42] You know why it's okay?

[11:43] Because you got a ton of pinball machines you're staring at right now that you haven't

[11:47] even seen the end of.

[11:48] So maybe jump on them and wait for something you really want.

[11:52] We're going to see people do that more and more.

[11:54] Because if you go to sell your used game and you try to get close to what you have into

[11:58] it, you're not going to get anywhere near that and it's going to sit.

[12:02] And you're not going to enjoy that and you're going to be pissed off and you might as well

[12:05] just stay happy and keep the game in your home and enjoy it.

[12:09] There was a reason why you bought every game in your collection in the first place.

[12:14] Do me a favor people.

[12:16] Just think about that for a minute.

[12:18] Every single game that you have in your current collection, it is there for a reason.

[12:24] You had maybe some FOMO when you got it.

[12:27] You had excitement when you unboxed it.

[12:29] But pinball every game is random.

[12:32] No pinball machine really gets old.

[12:34] It really doesn't.

[12:36] Because every game is different.

[12:37] The ball will go in different directions every single time.

[12:41] That is why it is kind of strange to me.

[12:44] With a product as random as pinball.

[12:46] And every game is different.

[12:48] And you can approach each game with these modern codes in so many different ways.

[12:52] It is so strange to me that people who are sitting on like 5, 10, 15, 20 games, they

[12:59] feel the urge to get another.

[13:01] Like it's weird to me.

[13:02] I don't know.

[13:03] Is it just that you need to fill the space in your homes?

[13:06] And please, if you fill the space in your homes, don't ever put pinball machines in front

[13:12] of windows.

[13:13] I was just looking at French's Batman game room.

[13:15] I love it.

[13:16] It hit me when I was like 16.

[13:18] I had all these transformer toys in my bedroom.

[13:20] But don't put a shelf filled with toys in front of a window.

[13:25] I don't care if it's a pinball machine or toys filled with Batman or a baby grand piano.

[13:32] You do not put an article of furniture in front of a window if that article of furniture

[13:39] goes above the bottom of the window pane.

[13:43] Okay?

[13:44] It is that simple.

[13:45] Can we please have some class in this hobby?

[13:48] All right.

[13:49] Wow.

[13:50] We've got Godfather sitting.

[13:51] Now the C's are getting unboxed.

[13:53] We're going to see more and more of those being unboxed over the next couple of months.

[13:57] Then we're going to get to Elton John.

[13:59] Then we're going to get maybe a stern vault.

[14:02] Then we're going to get more stern toppers that people have been waiting for.

[14:06] Then we're going to get Keith Elwin's Jaws.

[14:08] It's a world-win head into 2024.

[14:11] I'm so excited.

[14:12] I really am so excited because so much, it just feels like this damn is about to burst.

[14:18] It's either going to burst and wash us away in a good way or it's going to wash us away

[14:22] in a bad way.

[14:23] At these prices, we're all in the same boat.

[14:26] These companies need to deliver.

[14:28] We really are expecting great stuff.

[14:30] It can't just be in the form of software.

[14:33] It can't just be another fan layout.

[14:36] It can't be mechanisms like Venom has that just look lazy like when Doppelganger pops

[14:41] out.

[14:42] Those three targets are swinging off of Spider-Man's butt or Doppelganger's butt.

[14:47] You're telling me that that is a great design.

[14:50] I mean, seriously, what has happened?

[14:54] You've got to get more creative.

[14:56] It can be done.

[14:58] You can have finesse.

[14:59] You can pay attention to details.

[15:01] You can actually put scopes in a game so stuff looks more sculpted and three-dimensional

[15:06] and doesn't look like flat plastics for freaking $13,000, everybody.

[15:12] I'm really hot-wired today.

[15:14] It's Brenda's birthday.

[15:15] I've planned a lot that she does not know about.

[15:17] I love surprising my wife.

[15:19] The ultimate surprise I could do for Brenda on her birthday would be to buy her a pinball

[15:23] machine, but it wouldn't be a good surprise.

[15:25] I'm super excited.

[15:27] I'm really curious what's going to happen today, if anything at all.

[15:30] I'm just going to cut this show a little bit short because I'm planning to do another

[15:35] show today based upon the rumor I have coming true.

[15:39] If you're listening to this right now, let's cross our fingers and hope we have a new pinball

[15:43] company throwing a new game into the ring.

[15:46] It's going to be something fun, unexpected for us to talk about.

[15:49] I hope it's not a remake.

[15:50] I hope it's something original.

[15:52] We don't need more old stuff.

[15:54] We need new stuff that brings new designers and new coders and new artists into pinball.

[15:59] The future of pinball is forward.

[16:02] It is not looking back.

[16:03] Everybody, thank you for your support.

[16:05] We'll be back soon.

[16:06] Get out.
