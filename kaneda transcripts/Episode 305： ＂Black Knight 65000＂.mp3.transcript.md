[00:00] We're gonna take a look at the crazy,

[00:02] she's boys and good days,

[00:03] see and people say,

[00:05] you run along,

[00:06] walk away,

[00:07] and she's sweepers,

[00:08] I recall,

[00:09] little girls,

[00:10] I recall,

[00:11] and nights she's screaming,

[00:12] bum bum bum bum bum.

[00:14] Buh-buh.

[00:14] Buh-buh.

[00:15] Buh-buh.

[00:16] Buh-buh.

[00:17] Buh-buh.

[00:18] Buh-buh.

[00:19] Buh-buh.

[00:20] Welcome to episode 305 of

[00:23] Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:25] I'm your host,

[00:25] Canadian.

[00:26] A happy Monday morning, everyone.

[00:28] Before we kick off this show,

[00:30] we have to say a very,

[00:32] very happy, happy birthday

[00:34] to Chris Marquette at CoinTaker,

[00:37] amazing guy,

[00:38] amazing company,

[00:39] huge, huge member of the pinball community,

[00:42] and Chris,

[00:43] hope you have a great, great birthday.

[00:45] I sent you over in an October fest,

[00:47] so it should get there any minute now, right?

[00:49] I hope you enjoy it.

[00:50] All right,

[00:51] what else is going on in pinball?

[00:52] A Danny Peck,

[00:53] we wanna congratulate her on winning

[00:55] the New Zealand pinball championship,

[00:58] I mean, this is amazing.

[00:59] Danny,

[01:00] I don't know how old Danny is now, 15, 16.

[01:04] Daughter of Rotodeyev,

[01:05] but Danny, congratulations.

[01:06] I saw that on Facebook,

[01:07] and I thought that was super cool

[01:08] that you are the New Zealand pinball champion,

[01:11] so congrats again.

[01:13] One more thing I wanna mention,

[01:14] and before I get to this episode

[01:16] where a very special guest is returning,

[01:18] and you know him as the black knight Christopher Thompson,

[01:23] we've been trying to get him back on the show

[01:25] for a really long time.

[01:27] So a couple of things I wanna mention

[01:28] before we air that interview,

[01:29] number one,

[01:31] I wanted to say something about a little bit of pinball drama

[01:34] that I promised a friend of mine, Christopher Francia,

[01:36] I would mention because he keeps asking me,

[01:39] he's like,

[01:40] Canada, I can't believe you've avoided

[01:41] talking about the drama that happened with me.

[01:44] I'm not gonna go into the weeds of it all,

[01:47] but long story short,

[01:48] another pinball podcast,

[01:50] this flippin' podcast,

[01:52] tale over there,

[01:53] just had a little bit of commentary

[01:55] on Christopher Francia's work.

[01:57] He basically was saying that Chris is his drawings

[02:00] and his paintings come from other source materials,

[02:03] and he was debating whether or not that was weird or not.

[02:07] Chris Francia sort of told him where to stick it,

[02:11] and here's my take on the whole thing.

[02:14] I think there's a lot of pinball to gripe about.

[02:17] I think there's a lot to be happy about.

[02:20] Christopher Francia's art is incredible.

[02:23] I've never seen Christopher Francia make a game

[02:26] where I'm like, yeah, no, that doesn't look very good.

[02:29] So I don't think we need to manufacture drama.

[02:32] I think Christopher Francia's art style is pretty established.

[02:35] I think people know that a lot of his paintings

[02:37] come from other source materials,

[02:39] but he's a very, very talented artist.

[02:42] Could you look at any of that source material

[02:44] and create the kind of art he does?

[02:46] I couldn't, I don't think Taylor could,

[02:48] I don't think anyone who does a pinball podcast

[02:50] has that kind of artistic ability.

[02:52] And dare we send another artist frustrated and packing.

[02:57] So we have to go back to the days of Tron artwork

[03:01] and Lord of the Rings artwork and ACDC artwork.

[03:05] Do you remember how crappy pinball art is?

[03:07] Let's not attack the artist and pinball these days, all right?

[03:12] But the devil's avid kidney is,

[03:15] we also shouldn't shut down people's ability

[03:17] to have a conversation and talk about

[03:20] some of these observations that they're seeing.

[03:22] I do felt like Taylor did get a little bit wrongfully,

[03:26] like stridently convicted of just simply

[03:30] having a conversation about it.

[03:32] But look, it's such a silly topic.

[03:34] I think everyone would agree that Francia's art is incredible.

[03:37] He knows it, we know it, we'll see what happens.

[03:41] It's kind of a shame that Monsters can't be voted on

[03:43] for this year's Twippy's because it came out

[03:46] just like a few weeks after the fact,

[03:48] because I think it would have taken the Twippy this year.

[03:50] Now he's got a way to hold another year to be eligible

[03:54] because I think it's gonna be hard for him

[03:55] to dethrone Yeti with Deadpool and Iron Maiden.

[03:59] And I think that's unfair.

[04:00] I think he should have had Monsters put in there.

[04:02] Anyway, what else do I want to talk about?

[04:05] The final thing I want to talk about,

[04:06] and we'll get into everything on this episode.

[04:08] We'll get into the $65,000 Twilight Zone

[04:11] and we'll get into Deep Root

[04:12] and we'll talk about the entire hobby.

[04:15] It's been a long time since the Black Knight joined the show.

[04:18] The final thing I want to say is,

[04:19] I want to say a very, very special thank you

[04:21] to everybody out there.

[04:23] And you know who you are, who has voted

[04:26] for Canatus Pimbal podcast in this year's Twippy Awards.

[04:30] And you know I've been sharing some photos of me and Bubba

[04:34] and how Bubba would love another Twippy.

[04:36] And I've been reaching out to some of you

[04:38] just saying, hey, if you really can take the time,

[04:41] I would really appreciate it.

[04:43] Here we are, 305 episodes.

[04:46] The amount of hours I pump into this show

[04:49] and all I'm asking for all of you who listen,

[04:52] it just takes about two to three minutes

[04:54] to go to thisweekinpimbal.com

[04:58] and vote for your favorite games

[05:01] and hopefully write in your favorite Pimbal podcast

[05:04] as being Canatus Pimbal podcast.

[05:06] And I'm not gonna do what other podcasts do

[05:08] and say the Twippy's don't mean shit.

[05:09] And I'm honestly saying that it does mean a lot to me

[05:12] and the recognition does mean a lot.

[05:13] And I'll leave it at that.

[05:15] And I hope we've given you some incredible episodes

[05:17] as we lead up to the final days in which you can vote.

[05:20] And that's the other thing.

[05:22] I implore you when you look at the date,

[05:26] the Twippy voting ends this Thursday.

[05:30] I think it's this Thursday.

[05:31] It's January 31st is when all the voting closes.

[05:35] So that's it.

[05:36] I know there's like a huge pause between the end of voting

[05:40] and Texas Pimbal Festival,

[05:42] but don't think you have that long

[05:44] because you only have a few more days.

[05:46] So please, please, please, get your votes in

[05:48] and we look forward to seeing what the results are.

[05:51] I think I promised on an earlier episode

[05:53] that I would buy an October Fest if I won the Twippy

[05:56] or I would buy Hilton a new car.

[05:58] Well, I didn't say new car.

[06:00] I say A car.

[06:01] I've also got some really, really fun stuff planned

[06:04] if we win some an amazing image

[06:07] that I can't wait to show you guys.

[06:09] I asked Jeff and Zach if I won,

[06:14] if I could put this image on the big screen behind me

[06:17] when I go up and hopefully give my acceptance speech

[06:21] and they said, absolutely not.

[06:23] You cannot show that image,

[06:24] but I will share that image with you

[06:26] if I win the Twippy.

[06:28] You'll just have to wait and see everyone.

[06:29] All right, let me air this interview.

[06:32] This guy, I think he's won the smartest guys in the hobby.

[06:35] He's been around a long time

[06:36] and it's great to have his voice back

[06:37] on Canadian Pimbal podcast

[06:39] without further ado, the Black Knight.

[06:42] I know you want the best guest ever

[06:45] and that's why I have begged this guy

[06:47] to come back on for months

[06:49] and he's back the Black Knight.

[06:51] Chris, welcome back to the show.

[06:54] Yeah, thanks.

[06:55] Just keep it a low profile of these days, I guess.

[06:58] I know where you've been.

[06:59] What were you been up to in the Pimbal world?

[07:01] Well, not in the Pimbal world.

[07:02] I did last few months.

[07:04] I was doing traveling in Central America

[07:07] and other places around the world.

[07:08] So I kind of took a little break from Pimbal.

[07:11] I think everybody should, if they get kind of burned out.

[07:14] Right, did you get burned out?

[07:15] It's a few games.

[07:16] Yeah, I did.

[07:17] I decided I was doing some restoration of a few games

[07:21] and then I just said, I had to check out.

[07:23] I just, I got too much of it.

[07:25] Everybody gets too much of it at certain points.

[07:27] Wasn't a lot going on either.

[07:30] Well, there's been some news, right?

[07:31] And 2019 is upon us in the Pimbal world.

[07:34] So we're going to talk about what you think

[07:37] is going to happen next year.

[07:38] But I just want to get a sense of, it's been a while.

[07:42] It's been a while.

[07:43] And since we've talked, we've seen the monsters,

[07:46] we've seen October Fest, we've seen Pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:51] What do you think's happened?

[07:52] What's your take on the Pimbal world?

[07:53] Just then passed like few months.

[07:55] What's your take?

[07:56] Well, as we move into 2019, we're still

[08:00] what I considered to be overwhelmed

[08:02] with the number of manufacturers

[08:04] that are going to survive in the long term.

[08:07] There's just too many continued options for games,

[08:10] both new and used in the market.

[08:13] And it's inevitably time for an additional

[08:16] one or two pinball companies to fail.

[08:19] It's just, it's going to happen.

[08:21] Some will stay afloat, but for how long I cannot gather,

[08:24] maybe a couple of years, maybe less.

[08:27] And that's kind of the sad part, but that's just the way it works.

[08:31] Is it sad or is it just,

[08:33] why do we need so many companies?

[08:36] You don't, in my opinion.

[08:37] I think we have a wonderful selection of games across the port.

[08:42] As far as the things like the remake era, CGC,

[08:45] has come a long way.

[08:47] They've, in terms of my initial opinions

[08:49] of what they made with the medieval madness game.

[08:52] And then now their latest availability and release

[08:55] with Alonster Bash, it's like Night and Day.

[08:59] It's not just quality control.

[09:00] I mean, they've made great strides in development.

[09:04] And I have a lot better faith than I did initially

[09:08] in terms of them providing long-term support for their products.

[09:11] That's just one example.

[09:12] Well, let's, let's talk about that.

[09:14] So what do you mean by that?

[09:16] Like what, what have you seen differently

[09:18] from medieval madness to Montserbaugh's remake?

[09:21] Well, when I, as I was working as a technician,

[09:25] one of the things I found is that they were,

[09:27] they had an increasing amount of quality customer service

[09:32] similar to what Stern has provided.

[09:35] And especially in identifying problems

[09:38] and documentation of technical issues of their games.

[09:42] And as a result, at least from the standpoint of operators,

[09:47] they've had a lot better success in keeping those games running

[09:51] and identifying faults that would be quickly

[09:54] resolved from the company itself.

[09:57] And that's a huge bonus in comparison

[10:01] to some other problems which I don't particularly

[10:04] care for with some of the newer Stern spike games.

[10:07] But that's a separate issue.

[10:09] OK.

[10:10] OK, so you've turned a page on CGC.

[10:13] Yeah, I have.

[10:14] I think they've come a long way.

[10:15] And I think they have a lot of promise in the future

[10:18] to provide games that people wanted to play from the past

[10:21] to new generations.

[10:22] Because a lot of people weren't exposed to games

[10:26] even like Monarch Monster Bash.

[10:28] It was hard to find one that worked properly.

[10:31] And now you have the availability that you don't have to pay

[10:35] nine or $10,000 for fully restored Monster Bash

[10:39] and it can go into your house.

[10:41] Same things, what happened with the tech from ours.

[10:43] Right.

[10:44] And do you consider CGC to now be one of the top two or three

[10:49] contenders?

[10:51] Yes.

[10:51] I mean, one, two, three is Stern, Jersey Jack Pinball, probably

[10:57] three in number two, I believe is CGC.

[11:00] Right.

[11:01] OK.

[11:01] In terms of quality, overall quality, performance

[11:04] and customer service, those are the top three right off the top.

[11:08] I mean, just off the head in my head.

[11:10] Does mean any of the other companies are necessarily bad,

[11:14] but they're not as well developed.

[11:15] Right.

[11:16] What are your thoughts on spike system?

[11:19] Well, the biggest problem, and I got involved.

[11:22] It was the other thing I got involved with a post in recently.

[11:25] And I have done so since 2013 is that people

[11:31] were complaining a lot about the fact that we're

[11:34] sitting six years after this system has been developed.

[11:37] I mean, originally, it was developed as a part of a replacement

[11:41] potential technology in terms of their development,

[11:46] their home pins, the transformers and such

[11:49] matter back in 2010, as when actually started to be developed.

[11:53] But starting from 2013 and moving forward,

[11:57] particularly as you got to the first spike one games that

[12:00] worked into the commercial line, which, of course,

[12:04] was the wrestling WWE game, is that there

[12:07] haven't been a lot of well-documented

[12:12] understandings of how the node boards work, the corrections

[12:16] that could be made.

[12:17] And from an operator standpoint, not just a home user,

[12:21] it still remains a mystery even to this day.

[12:24] And it's not just because this is a surface-mounted technology

[12:29] with multi-layered boards and lack of schematics.

[12:33] I mean, these boards, in some cases, are so dense, Chris,

[12:37] that you cannot repair them at all.

[12:40] Right.

[12:40] Absolutely disposable technology.

[12:43] And if you look a little bit further in the past,

[12:47] when it comes to pinball technology,

[12:48] there's what I call the concepts of reliability, serviceability,

[12:54] and durability of pinball.

[12:56] And when you don't have that capability

[12:58] to be able to properly repair boards,

[13:01] then you're looking at a 250-pound paperweight.

[13:05] Very quickly, if you've experienced it yourself,

[13:09] but one of the biggest problems that we see in the short term

[13:13] is that unlike games of the past for technology,

[13:16] of course, moved on in advancements

[13:18] were made by Balli and Williams and Gottlieb

[13:20] and the rest of the companies, is that most of these

[13:25] were still supported 10 years or more after the games

[13:29] had been introduced to be supported.

[13:33] And that's not the case with a lot of the games.

[13:36] And I'm going to straight up tell you,

[13:39] I mean, there are boards that are unavailable starting

[13:43] from our NLA that are starting from any game

[13:47] before Ghostbusters that are simply no longer manufactured.

[13:51] And they are not available from distributors.

[13:54] And so that means if you're going to get one of those.

[13:58] What you're saying is if you have a spike board

[14:02] before Ghostbusters and it's broken, you're shat-a-luck.

[14:07] And unless it's backwards compatible with either a game

[14:12] that's forward or backwards, which there is some cases

[14:15] where that applies.

[14:17] But you have to know the boards very specifically.

[14:21] And in some cases, the boards are repairable.

[14:24] I'm not stating that all these boards are unrepairable.

[14:27] But when you've got boards that the cost of replacements

[14:31] vary between $150,000 and $1,000 each,

[14:36] that's a lot of money for a game.

[14:38] Is there really a board that costs $1,000?

[14:41] Yeah, the CPU boards.

[14:43] And that's in the back box.

[14:45] Correct, that's not the node boards.

[14:47] That's the main CPU.

[14:48] OK.

[14:49] And there's only limited numbers of CPU ones that are from the spike

[14:53] ones that are already available.

[14:54] They're becoming scarce.

[14:56] So do you recommend for someone who has a game

[15:00] that they want to keep forever?

[15:02] If you have a game that is like, this game's bolted to my floor.

[15:07] And it's a stern game.

[15:08] And it's running on a spike system that

[15:12] owners buy as many node boards.

[15:16] And should they have backups just in case?

[15:20] Well, I mean, everybody would love to have backups.

[15:22] But that's a hard pill to swallow.

[15:25] I mean, not for a short period.

[15:26] But is it peace of mind, though, right?

[15:27] Because to your point, what matters more?

[15:31] The difference between the games that Stern's making today

[15:34] and the games that Stern made 10 or 15 years ago

[15:37] is a lot of these spike games are planned off-salescence.

[15:41] Stern doesn't want to be competing against their own games

[15:46] with what happened during the white star and the Sam

[15:49] period.

[15:50] Because that means they don't sell as many new games.

[15:54] So are you saying that they really want these games to one

[15:58] day self-destruct?

[16:00] Not necessarily self-destruct, but become early off-salescence.

[16:05] What does that mean?

[16:06] What does that mean, though?

[16:08] Is this like a cell phone when you can't take the battery out?

[16:11] That means not easily repaired.

[16:13] OK.

[16:14] And so either you have to have, and this

[16:17] is one of the things that really irks my chain or pulls my chain,

[16:22] is that unlike Valley and Williams,

[16:24] when they introduced a new operating system or board set,

[16:29] they provided technical training classes to operators

[16:35] and education as far as to be able to repair and understand

[16:40] the systems, not just the repair, but also the diagnostics.

[16:44] This has not been done with the spike system,

[16:48] and we're sitting at six years later

[16:51] since it was been formally introduced.

[16:53] And that's never happened in the pinball industry of the past.

[16:58] Now, people will try to compare this to a throwaway television

[17:03] set or phone or whatever.

[17:07] But if, like, for example, and I don't want to use cargaments,

[17:10] but any large expenditure cost, if you buy that item,

[17:15] to say it's unrepairable is a problem.

[17:20] And it needs, people need to recognize,

[17:23] and I know a lot of collectors realize it's a problem.

[17:27] But we have a lot of newer people that got into the hobby

[17:31] and aren't aware necessarily the changes of hardware.

[17:34] That's all.

[17:35] But Chris, I mean, when you say you think a lot of people are aware,

[17:39] I would say that I think most collectors are unaware

[17:43] that they might be sitting on a game that's

[17:44] unrepairable in the future.

[17:46] Well, I think they're going to figure it out pretty quick.

[17:49] Which games? Which games?

[17:50] Which games right now do you think are unrepairable?

[17:52] Well, we've got board shortages for WWE.

[17:56] Well, no, but maybe that's a blessing in disguise.

[17:59] Nobody likes that game.

[18:01] But what else?

[18:02] Kiss.

[18:03] Kiss, all right.

[18:04] Game of Thrones.

[18:06] OK.

[18:07] I would guess, although I didn't verify this,

[18:10] is Woa Nelly, because it had a low production

[18:13] value on a number.

[18:16] These all sound like games, Stern,

[18:18] might wish never existed in the first place.

[18:20] Well, I don't know.

[18:21] I can't speak for Stern.

[18:23] I mean, I don't do that.

[18:24] This could have been a strategy all along by Jody.

[18:27] Let's make a really bad game of Thrones.

[18:29] That is irreparable.

[18:31] Well, I mean, Ghostbusters sold really well.

[18:34] So there were a larger set.

[18:35] I mean, the more games that you sell, the more spare parts

[18:41] you have available.

[18:42] And there used to be an old policy from Stern in 2000s

[18:47] or so that they would keep spare parts for game

[18:49] for up to five years, or which point that they would run out

[18:53] depending on the production level.

[18:55] Balli Williams had a much longer period than Stern did.

[18:58] And it's understandable, too, from Stern's standpoint,

[19:01] because they're not producing the same volumes of games

[19:03] that Balli Williams did in the 90s.

[19:07] But anybody that believes that, and I'm not saying

[19:10] they're sitting on a ticking time bomb,

[19:12] I think that would describe the fact

[19:15] that these borders are completely unreliable, which is not true.

[19:20] But the failure rates are rising and they are there.

[19:25] If people don't want to admit it, that's fine.

[19:28] Go talk to an operator and various offers.

[19:32] A lot of them, there's a lot of reasons

[19:34] they don't want to route pinball.

[19:36] But the spike system is a problem for some operators,

[19:41] unless you have large routes, because they cannot keep them

[19:46] running if they go down.

[19:48] We're talking losses of hundreds of dollars of income

[19:51] every week if the game doesn't work.

[19:56] And that could be equal to the replacement of one board,

[20:02] which is a pretty high cost.

[20:05] OK, so people should be cautious in buying spike system.

[20:12] I think it's undercooked, personally.

[20:15] I think it's an undercooked mess that diagnostics are not

[20:19] well understood, and it is still subject

[20:22] to voltage-regulational issues and shorts.

[20:28] And I don't recommend it, but that's me.

[20:31] That's my opinion.

[20:32] I know some people may hate me for it,

[20:35] but that's my opinion.

[20:37] OK.

[20:40] With all the new games out there, which is the most bulletproof,

[20:44] which is the most serviceable in the future?

[20:47] Well, one of the advantages that I can share is when Jersey Jack

[20:51] did his boards, even though he had some terrible problems

[20:55] with his developments early on with Waz,

[20:58] is that he took a step back, and at the request of owners

[21:02] and operators, he documented the technical schematics

[21:05] and specifications for his boards.

[21:08] And partly, the technology that he was using

[21:10] made it much more repairable.

[21:13] In the American pinball for Houdini,

[21:15] they used some p-rock stuff that was pretty good.

[21:19] Spooky has some redundancy.

[21:22] Probably their stuff is most definitely repairable.

[21:27] I'm not sure I could put my finger on any particular company

[21:31] that would be better than anybody else's.

[21:33] Maybe Spooky, I guess, because of his redundancy in the systems.

[21:38] But I would literally have to do a side-by-side sit-down

[21:43] of every single type of system, because there's some of the parts

[21:49] of the electronics that are being used

[21:51] are kind of like a cornucopia, where they actually

[21:54] have taken different parts from different types of systems

[21:57] and put it together.

[21:58] And then in some cases, they've literally done things

[22:03] specialized just for their games.

[22:07] It's not taking just stuff off the shelf.

[22:09] It's what I'm trying to say.

[22:10] So not like everybody sticking a raspberry pie

[22:12] in a pinball.

[22:13] Right.

[22:14] Chris, do you think for the most part,

[22:15] the majority of people who buy these new inbox games,

[22:18] just assume they're going to last forever?

[22:21] I think some people believe that they're more resilient

[22:26] in terms of their thinking more on the standpoint of like a car

[22:34] or something that'd be much more robust and reliable

[22:38] when a reality is they're very easily susceptible to things

[22:43] like changes in voltage or vibrational problems,

[22:48] because it is a mechanical device.

[22:50] And when you put that steel ball in that game

[22:54] rolling around that wood play field

[22:56] and hitting these type of parts, things happen.

[23:00] Every time you flip that switch on that power switch,

[23:04] it might work.

[23:05] It might not work.

[23:06] And that's one of the problems that happens

[23:08] with Stern's spike games is if they've had problems just

[23:12] doing updates where node boards have been fried

[23:16] when they updated the firmware or the software.

[23:19] Literally, they fried boards.

[23:21] Why does that happen?

[23:22] I've seen that.

[23:23] I've seen people post that.

[23:25] Well, the only thing I can guess is there's

[23:27] some type of incompatibility between the software

[23:30] and the way it's being generated with the plus 48 voltage.

[23:34] But unfortunately, I don't have the schematics in front of me.

[23:38] So it's hard for me to analyze because every single game

[23:42] is unique.

[23:43] And I had that happen to me once with my Batman.

[23:45] I booted it up and it just said node board 8 failure.

[23:50] And I had no solution other than to get a new node board.

[23:56] Right.

[23:56] And that's the point is nobody ever, in your case,

[23:59] nobody ever did diagnose what the problem is.

[24:02] They just did a swap of trunks.

[24:04] Right.

[24:05] And I know Stern has sent out a node board sort of fixed kit,

[24:10] which is sort of weird because there's something about the,

[24:15] I don't even know.

[24:17] Are you talking about the one for the CPU?

[24:20] No, this is the one on the node boards.

[24:22] It's really, I got to be honest.

[24:25] This is like the most important thing with the zip tie.

[24:29] Yeah, the ghetto fix ever.

[24:31] Yeah, but that was just that was just to try to keep one transistor

[24:36] from touching a ground point, which then would cause a short.

[24:39] That's what that was.

[24:40] And it was due to part of this really due to vibration.

[24:43] If I remember correctly, it was down by the trough.

[24:45] But think about how ghetto that fix is.

[24:47] You're zip tying.

[24:49] Well, a plastic piece.

[24:51] You I mean, but it was like, I'm still that too.

[24:54] I'm going to get a perfect look.

[24:58] You could home boy fix it by Williams and by Stern.

[25:01] But I remember when I got that fix, I was like, this,

[25:04] this is really the solve.

[25:08] Well, once again, I caution people that are on the new inbox track

[25:15] or those that are buying games used for spiked to be aware

[25:22] that the older that these get, we're already in the spike too.

[25:25] The systems are changing.

[25:28] The more spike that when the I don't remember, I want to say,

[25:32] I don't want to make a mistake without looking it up.

[25:34] What the last spike one CPU work as they continued

[25:38] to make additional changes to the technology.

[25:41] But we're still now or six years later,

[25:44] we've changed the system dramatically already.

[25:47] And we still don't have schematics.

[25:50] Right.

[25:51] I mean, that is not a good old in my opinion.

[25:54] But once again, I'm expressing in the opinion.

[25:58] And it seems that I would say, Chris,

[26:01] that the majority of people who are buying all these new games,

[26:04] right, I think they're knowledge and they're

[26:07] understanding of the actual node boards and CPUs

[26:11] and future service ability is nunt, is zilch.

[26:17] Like, it doesn't matter.

[26:18] They're buying on theme, on artwork, on emotional,

[26:22] like, would you agree?

[26:24] Yeah, for the most part, because it's a generational change

[26:29] from the standpoint of who collects, why do they collect?

[26:33] But we're also not seeing anyone post,

[26:37] I bought a game from Stern, and it's forever broken.

[26:41] That's never been posted, ever.

[26:43] Well, for right now, it's not a critical issue

[26:46] if you've got a spike because we're still

[26:48] in the infancy of the system.

[26:49] We're not 10% percent.

[26:50] But if anyone survives, though, if any company

[26:53] keeps trucking in Pimbal, won't it be Stern?

[26:56] Yeah, of course it will.

[26:57] And I think that ultimately, what will happen

[26:59] is if there is an outcry because of the extreme cost

[27:03] of some of these replacement boards,

[27:05] then somebody will eventually step forward

[27:07] as a third party and make replacements.

[27:10] Do you think it'd be a third party, though?

[27:11] You think Stern would really leave?

[27:14] So what would you want?

[27:15] Past customers, you know, with a broken Stern?

[27:19] I wouldn't want you because they're making Boku bucks.

[27:22] No, but 500% markup.

[27:25] Yeah, but Chrissy, they're not making like,

[27:28] it's not like Apple where they're making phones

[27:31] that they know will one day be completely obsolete.

[27:34] Do you really think Stern is design games

[27:37] for obsolescence for future sales?

[27:39] Yep.

[27:40] Really?

[27:41] Yep, because they're methodology in regards

[27:45] to what they used to do up to 2000 changed.

[27:49] So you think that Stern is designing games

[27:53] that in the future will just be a 250 pound paper weight

[27:57] that someone's just gonna throw away

[28:00] and go get a new one?

[28:02] I don't think they're gonna care.

[28:04] I mean, with the next, I mean, I know these are

[28:08] terrible remarks because people might get a little

[28:12] apprehensive, but when the next, the climb of our economy

[28:17] of our economy comes and they have to,

[28:21] Stern has to consolidate what they decide to build.

[28:25] They aren't gonna be able to support them anyway.

[28:29] These games are gonna be forgot about.

[28:32] I mean, who goes to, I mean, I made the comment once.

[28:36] I mean, if somebody goes to Stern right now

[28:38] and says I need parts for a big, big buck punter from 2005,

[28:43] the chances are they're gonna say,

[28:45] you're a shit outta luck.

[28:47] And I realized that was, you know,

[28:50] a little longer as far as time is concerned,

[28:54] but it won't take that long for us to reach

[28:56] the first decade of spike games.

[28:58] Right.

[28:59] And then we're gonna be looking at some

[29:01] of these earliest spike games and unlike the Sam

[29:06] and the white star boards that have a lot more

[29:11] through-hole technology, these just don't.

[29:16] Okay, so in summary, Stern's new system is unproven.

[29:22] The future reliability of them is unproven.

[29:26] Correct.

[29:26] People who are buying these machines in droves

[29:30] might have a short-term elation,

[29:32] but a long-term frustration in getting them fixed.

[29:36] They might not care though,

[29:37] because a lot of people they buy him for various reasons

[29:40] that are different from the previous collectors of all.

[29:43] But what does that mean?

[29:44] That means they don't play them.

[29:46] They sit in the corner and they look at them

[29:49] and they say, ooh, I mean, that's an interesting point

[29:53] because where and tear is reduced.

[29:56] And when you reduce the where and tear on components,

[29:59] that means the longevity of a system is expanded.

[30:03] Right.

[30:05] And that's a good point,

[30:06] because do you think Stern is now designing games

[30:09] for the home collector with the anticipation

[30:12] that this game won't be played a thousand times?

[30:17] In some cases, I think they're expecting

[30:19] that the game will survive for 10 to 15 years

[30:21] and maybe even 20 is a home environment game

[30:24] and then they won't care.

[30:27] Because it's only $9,000 to a person

[30:31] that has a lot of money anyway, which isn't much.

[30:34] Right.

[30:35] I mean, let's be serious, guys.

[30:38] I mean, who buys these games?

[30:40] It's not the pinball players for the tournaments

[30:44] that are in their 20s.

[30:47] Okay, so I mean, I've got a couple of friends

[30:51] that just they buy new inbox games

[30:53] and they're still sitting in boxes in a row.

[30:55] Right, so I mean, I see a lot.

[30:57] I mean, look, we see people buying new inbox,

[31:00] we see people buying games,

[31:01] selling them with less than 100 plays.

[31:04] Right, which means they never get played.

[31:07] Right, yeah.

[31:08] I would say I would also say the majority of collectors

[31:10] don't want to lift play fields.

[31:12] They don't know how to solder.

[31:14] They're not in this hobby to fix games.

[31:17] They're in it to have fun and they have a toy.

[31:22] So let's talk about a game that is out there

[31:26] that I know you know about a $65,000 toilet.

[31:32] Oh, why?

[31:33] So Chris, like, like,

[31:38] how could a prototype of Twilight Zone,

[31:41] which I know you know a lot about,

[31:43] what are your thoughts on that?

[31:44] $65,000.

[31:47] Okay, all right, anybody, I mean, from stand,

[31:51] I mean, I obviously I posted quite a few times

[31:56] I couldn't help it because I thought that,

[31:57] I thought the thread was funny as hell.

[32:00] I mean, I knew it wasn't necessarily a joke

[32:03] because once he put up pictures

[32:06] and he was answering questions,

[32:09] but Ted Estes came on and started talking about the games.

[32:15] And I bless that he did because I'm so glad of that.

[32:18] I wish Pat would go on there too, but he probably won't.

[32:21] The biggest problem is is I know a lot

[32:24] about the understanding of the pinball market

[32:27] and the used market.

[32:29] Understanding the difference between a prototype

[32:32] of a production game

[32:34] and say a prototype of a game that wasn't built.

[32:38] Okay, and some of these games can command

[32:41] extremely high values that can't.

[32:45] There are games of the coin-operated market,

[32:48] which I'm not gonna get into here,

[32:50] that win for private sales in excess of $65,000,

[32:54] but that's also accounting for certain inflation aspects

[32:58] of the past and other special services.

[33:00] Can you name it, title?

[33:01] Just, I'm just curious, like,

[33:03] I'm not gonna go on this because it was private sales

[33:06] and it's stuff that I don't know.

[33:07] You don't have to name the people,

[33:08] but what's the game?

[33:10] I'm not gonna go on that.

[33:12] Oh my God, King Kong?

[33:13] I mean, it's Kingpin.

[33:15] I mean, it's because it might cause a whole bunch

[33:17] of flurry and people start asking all sorts of questions.

[33:20] And this is where I tried, like,

[33:22] when I was talking to about it on this thread,

[33:26] I was kinda, I'm not pointing a finger at the guy saying,

[33:30] are you freaking crazy?

[33:32] You know, like a lot of other people said,

[33:33] you know, making jokes at the $65,000 price tag.

[33:37] My point is, if anybody thinks that this game

[33:40] is worth $65,000,

[33:43] then there should be an iron clad proof

[33:47] that this game was the first Twilight Zone that was ever built.

[33:52] And I already knew without saying anything that it wasn't.

[33:56] How'd you know that?

[33:58] Because of the serial number.

[33:59] What would the first one serial number be?

[34:03] Most likely, the X9700, whatever,

[34:08] I mean, it was like, I forget what it was, it was one.

[34:11] Ted, ask these game is one prior to that one.

[34:14] Do you think that even matters?

[34:16] Does it even add value?

[34:17] I know, honestly, don't, well, see, here's the thing.

[34:20] There's prototypes and there's prototypes.

[34:22] Like, in the case of Twilight Zone, according to Ted,

[34:25] they had two prototypes that were built off the white woods,

[34:29] which then were built into another additional 12 to 15 prototypes,

[34:34] which then some of them became samples eventually.

[34:37] I mean, you have to understand the different terminology of games,

[34:43] you know, the difference between, say, for example,

[34:45] what is the difference between a prototype, a sample,

[34:50] and an early production, because they're not the same thing.

[34:54] They're not.

[34:56] Right.

[34:57] And as far as the features that are concerned with this particular game,

[35:02] it's just another early, certainly is an early prototype.

[35:08] No doubt about it.

[35:09] Right.

[35:09] It's got the two magnets in the right orbit area.

[35:12] Yeah, it seems to add up a terrible play field where I would

[35:18] as look at the photos on my, for 65 grand.

[35:23] Yeah, I want this thing.

[35:24] And that's, but that's not a, that's not really a typical of a game of that

[35:29] era because these games were sold to to Valley Williams employees after they had

[35:35] been tested or placed on test runs.

[35:38] And, and, you know, they're not going to be in perfect question because you

[35:41] said you were, you were witness to another game around this price.

[35:46] I wasn't witness to this game.

[35:47] When I said I met coin, coin operated equipment.

[35:51] OK, OK, well, it isn't a pinball machine.

[35:53] Do you think any pinball machine, do you think there's any pinball machine

[35:58] worth 65,000?

[36:00] Not a present time.

[36:02] What does that mean?

[36:04] I think we need a few more years of inflation before we get that.

[36:07] OK, because in your opinion, and you know pinball very well, what do you think

[36:11] is the most valuable pinball machine on planet Earth right now?

[36:16] Wow, that's a tough one.

[36:17] Well, come on, you know everything.

[36:19] Well, I don't know everything.

[36:20] I would say that the problem is that all the, when you have a rumor, for example,

[36:26] like with Capcom kingpin, as soon as the rumor came about or pictures came out

[36:31] that there was a potential where the remix happening.

[36:33] So do you think that knocks the kingpins from the top?

[36:35] It does, unfortunately, it just does.

[36:37] What's next?

[36:38] The King Kongs?

[36:40] King Kongs are up around, well, I mean, the problem is there's not enough pricing

[36:45] data.

[36:46] I can only estimate what I know.

[36:49] OK, I mean, things like the

[36:50] last King Kong were sold for over $30,000.

[36:54] The lockness monster from game plant went for over $30,000.

[36:59] You had Capcom kingpins that sold for close to $50,000.

[37:04] Those guys, man, those guys you bought, Kingpin for 50 grand are going to be heard in real

[37:09] bad real soon.

[37:10] I mean, you have medieval madness remate or sorry, prototypes that went for 20, 25,000,

[37:17] you know, the original Capcom Big Bang Bar prototypes that said it between $25,000 and

[37:22] $30,000.

[37:23] I mean, most of these prototype games that weren't made or sit around somewhere between

[37:33] $20,000 and $30,000.

[37:35] But as soon as you get to a game like Twilight Zone prototypes, because there are so many

[37:40] more of the game available and it's a produce game, the value is much lower.

[37:46] Absolutely, there's only, well, there's only like eight King Kong's in total existence,

[37:52] right?

[37:53] Yeah, correct.

[37:54] With Twilight Zone, if you want to get the Twilight Zone.

[37:56] And they're unique.

[37:57] And that's the thing.

[37:58] Right.

[37:59] Each one's different.

[38:00] And such said it best is that each one of those, he has, he did restorations of three of

[38:04] the eight games as he mentioned in that thread.

[38:07] Each one of those games was unique.

[38:09] Right.

[38:10] Which is the reason why people, part of the reason why they want these prototype type

[38:13] games, if they're unique.

[38:15] I would argue that, and I'm just going to say this, the prototypes of games that went

[38:21] into mass production were the final version actually improved upon the prototype in most

[38:29] cases.

[38:30] In most cases.

[38:31] But it's not always, I mean, you have examples like I provided on the thread with, you

[38:36] know, I'll give you not like Montahari because people didn't want to state and said, look,

[38:41] there's no way that a, that a prototype game can be worth four or five, four or five

[38:48] times the value of a production game.

[38:52] Right.

[38:53] And I said, okay, well, guess what?

[38:55] Here I'll get you one right off the bat.

[38:57] Montahari that had over 16,000 games made of the solid state version had 170 of the

[39:04] EM made.

[39:06] And, and the average value, going value of a Montahari solid state is around a thousand

[39:10] bucks.

[39:11] The, the average price of value of a EM Montahari is $5,000, you know, equitable condition,

[39:20] the same give or take.

[39:21] I mean, they could be last, they could be more or whatever.

[39:24] But the point I'm trying to make is people would say, well, that's a prototype and the answer

[39:28] is, well, it's, no, it's not.

[39:29] It's actually the same game, but it's just using a different operating system, IE and

[39:34] EM Electromagnetical, but it does happen and these prices just, they, they can be very

[39:39] high in terms of multiples.

[39:42] Right.

[39:43] So do you think this guy asking $65,000 is just smoking crack?

[39:46] Well, in my opinion, the absolutely right now is going to pay it.

[39:50] Nobody, I mean, Chris, let me ask you about the most recent high, high, high price tag

[39:57] games, $21,500 for the big Lebowski from Dutch.

[40:02] Would you, would you even go in on that game knowing all you know about serviceability,

[40:06] future parts, all that?

[40:08] Not presently because I like to keep my games working.

[40:12] Okay.

[40:13] So that's 21,500 people are trying to sell.

[40:15] And if I can care about money, I don't think it would make a difference to, you have to

[40:18] remember, if I was a billionaire, I wouldn't give a shit.

[40:22] If I like pinball and I was a billionaire, I'd buy that game for $21,000 in a heartbeat,

[40:27] because I wouldn't give a shit.

[40:29] Right.

[40:30] But I wouldn't give a shit.

[40:31] But like, all right, but, but under that, through that lens, then nothing really matters,

[40:35] right?

[40:36] Well, I mean, does it?

[40:37] Does it?

[40:38] There's no consequences if you've got a thousand million just to blow.

[40:42] Okay.

[40:43] So let me ask you about $25,000 for a wrath of Olympus.

[40:48] That seems a bit high too, because a bit or a lot high.

[40:52] Okay.

[40:53] We're probably looking at about 10 to $15,000 high.

[40:56] But why?

[40:57] But, yeah.

[40:58] Okay.

[40:59] But the game was $6,500 and then nobody wanted it.

[41:04] It was a different time people were people.

[41:06] It's just like, we can go all the way back like when we discussed about Big Bang Bar and

[41:10] nobody wanted to buy it.

[41:11] So it's not about that.

[41:12] Because the other game I was going to ask you is people are trying to sell their Big Bang

[41:15] bars now for like $18,000 and we know that Chicago, because they know there's a potential

[41:19] for the rematch because they're going to get fucked.

[41:22] But it's not that there's a potential Chicago gaming already officially said they're going

[41:26] to remake it.

[41:27] At some point, I don't know when it's where it is in the packing order, but I mean,

[41:32] it'd be nice.

[41:33] I might even buy one.

[41:34] I actually thought about buying one based on the conditions of doing like remakes.

[41:39] I don't hate them.

[41:40] But as someone who studies the hobby, right?

[41:45] And there's something fun when there's gray games, when there's these rare remakes have

[41:52] a place in pinball.

[41:53] If no other reason than to expose people that have not been able to play them, to play

[42:00] them on location, for example, or in their house.

[42:04] I don't have a problem with it.

[42:06] Once again, there will always be collectors that will want the original games though.

[42:11] But that's a good point because remaking Monster Bash or medieval madness is one thing,

[42:16] but remaking a highly collectible grail game like a King Kong or a King pin, it completely

[42:25] destroys the rarity.

[42:28] Of course it does.

[42:29] But I don't control that.

[42:32] I mean, but just asking you a good general question, as a fan of the hobby, do you wish that

[42:40] we could maintain some of these white, well games that are the holy grails of collectors?

[42:46] Should we just say?

[42:47] Yes, there wish there would be a bit of sanctity in regards to the hobby and sort of the cashing

[42:52] up, you know, the cash cow ship of pinball that has occurred in the last 10 to 15 years.

[43:01] I mean, I remember that, I mean, some of this has happened before.

[43:06] Last iteration occurred at the early 2000s when you had some of the cookie cutter games

[43:11] like, you know, scared stiff and fathom, but, you know, or they also just magically jumped

[43:17] in value by, you know, 400% and what they were before.

[43:22] So, you know, I don't control it.

[43:26] I only know is that, you know, I can only enjoy.

[43:29] I've been priced out of certain games, but I'm not particularly worried about like not

[43:35] being able to afford a Jersey Jack collectors edition or or stern limited edition, because

[43:41] I don't want those games anyway.

[43:43] So, something recently that we exposed in this show was the actual cost to stern to make

[43:51] a machine.

[43:52] And we got, we got this a little bit, wasn't it?

[43:55] And we got this from the parks and then all of a sudden, stern reached out to Nick and

[43:58] made me delete that tidbit, but I can't forget what I heard.

[44:02] I slapped it as pp, right?

[44:04] Because, I mean, I tried to explain that these costs to other people, they weren't like $5,000

[44:11] or some absurd amount, because otherwise they don't make any money.

[44:15] What do you think is stern, Ellie actually cost them to make?

[44:19] I think it, I mean, from looking at the bomb, and remember, this does dependant on license

[44:24] of particular titles and the amount of materials of features that are provided inside a specific

[44:31] game.

[44:32] So, it will vary a little bit, but you're looking at between $3,500 to $4,000 or less the

[44:41] pro is cheaper for each game.

[44:44] And then everything, and you know, I, the markups to the distributor, you know, $500 or so

[44:50] is $250 in some cases, and the rest is profit.

[44:55] So, stern is almost more than doubling what I call in the making, Ellie.

[45:00] Absolutely.

[45:01] No, no, okay, what do you think Jersey Jack's bomb is?

[45:04] Because when you look at pirates of the Caribbean, Ellie, Nick, and Cistern, Ellie, there's no way.

[45:09] Yeah, the bomb, the bomb, the problem with Jersey Jack is that, you know, he doesn't have

[45:17] the same robustness in terms of parts manufacturing that Stern has.

[45:22] So he's going to have that higher overhead.

[45:25] So if you've got a game, and I don't, I don't even know what the pro equivalency of his

[45:30] games are going for these case, because the prices keep jumping all over the place.

[45:35] He doesn't even, he doesn't have a pro though.

[45:37] He doesn't like strip out standard edition, whatever you want to call it.

[45:41] I, the problem is it keeps jumping around, and then of course it goes up $500 every

[45:46] fiscal year, you know, with every company, because they can, I would say somewhere closer

[45:53] to probably, you know, $4,500 to $5,000 for a fully featured game.

[46:01] Right.

[46:02] And then, you know, the markup, but you know, I, I mean, he's definitely banking for a

[46:06] collector's edition at say $12,500.

[46:09] Right.

[46:10] But how many games is he actually selling in comparison to Stern?

[46:15] And Jack's never quite figured it out.

[46:18] Like he's got his limited, he's got his collectors, he's, he's, he doesn't have a pro.

[46:24] Well, he's his own audience.

[46:25] I mean, when you confuse your own audience, when you can't figure out the difference, real

[46:28] of the reality of what you're getting for buying a certain particular title, I mean, it's

[46:34] like I said, I mentioned earlier, you wanted the no predictions, ask the prediction questions

[46:40] because I think P3 is on a fast track to help if they don't do something quick.

[46:46] I think multi-morphic, maybe the next one will go.

[46:50] That's a prediction.

[46:51] I'm not sad.

[46:52] I'll tell you the way I think.

[46:55] Yeah.

[46:56] Like so, okay.

[46:57] So P3, what, I mean, I do think they're going to be one of the, one of the casualties of

[47:02] 2019.

[47:04] Possibly.

[47:05] He's one of them.

[47:06] He doesn't have the sales numbers to support continued operations.

[47:11] But, but, but Jerry's been in it for like six, seven years.

[47:13] Like at this point, meter along, but is he really doing anything?

[47:18] I mean, is he really producing magic to, so enhance his future as a company or is he

[47:26] kind of stagnating like Dutch pinball did with their latest, you know, Pupu article of

[47:31] results of ARA and their progress in the other.

[47:35] So look, I mean, we've been honest on this show about P3 and they haven't sold even

[47:41] a hundred games in seven years.

[47:45] Which companies do you think are in hot water, Chris in 2019?

[47:52] Well, Jersey Jack pinball still is in hot water because unless his pirates of the Caribbean

[47:57] sells well and his billionaire investor doesn't get tired of him, he's still back in the

[48:02] red again.

[48:04] Okay.

[48:05] So he's a turn significant profit since any of his games ever.

[48:10] He's had the most most remarkable would be was because it was course available for the

[48:15] longest, but all his titles were not necessarily remarkable, remarkable sales achievements.

[48:23] So you know, he continues to remain in the red.

[48:26] He doesn't achieve and make a lot of profit based on his games so far.

[48:31] He's got this latest game coming out.

[48:33] The sales haven't been necessarily stellar.

[48:36] Okay.

[48:37] He doesn't have anything far enough advanced to be able to be released in terms of and be

[48:42] in production in 2019 that I've seen.

[48:46] Right.

[48:47] Okay.

[48:48] So Jersey Jack is always.

[48:49] He's lying on pirates of the Caribbean to sell well.

[48:52] They're always in jeopardy of the guy can wake up one day and say let's pull the plug.

[48:57] What about American pinball?

[48:59] American pinball.

[49:01] I think they need a different game, but that's because the whole October fest thing.

[49:05] I'm not I don't want to get on the on the canada jump wagon with the whole theme thing with

[49:10] October fest, but you know, and because I'm aware, I'm I listen, I read, I figure out

[49:16] what's going on, but I honestly think that that they're one game away from potential failure

[49:23] just because and it's it's you know, their sales for Houdini didn't go quite as well

[49:28] as they wanted them to.

[49:31] And so they have to make up for some of it in a October fest, which I don't think is

[49:35] going to be that great.

[49:37] Right.

[49:38] I think they're I think they're going to sell sub 1000, practically perhaps sub 500.

[49:44] And that's not going to bode well to maintain a company and keep it going.

[49:48] Right.

[49:49] So once again, they're they're at risk.

[49:51] You see what I was talking about when I said at the beginning, I mean, you've got these

[49:54] companies that are lingering at the precipice of a cliff.

[50:02] How long can they go on?

[50:05] But I mean, I always wonder that Chris and then I I watched these companies who seemingly

[50:12] are financed either by personal investment or by sheer pride.

[50:19] And I can't for the life of me determine how they're actually making money.

[50:24] Well, they're necessarily not, but you will already we knew how to discover that to be.

[50:28] In a lot of cases, a lot of that guys like when we talked about highway pinball, they

[50:33] had been hemorrhaging money for years.

[50:36] Right.

[50:37] So if you look at the pinball landscape, it's happening money for years too.

[50:40] If you look at the pinball landscape and this is the part that people don't want to they

[50:45] don't want to like realize this.

[50:47] Jersey Jack pinball is still probably millions of dollars in the red from when they began.

[50:53] Probably definitely is he doesn't have enough sales to back up the investments of what

[50:56] he did for his for his developments costs.

[50:59] When I went over to his factory, Jack's like, I've got millions of dollars in parts and

[51:04] I'm getting millions of dollars of assets, right.

[51:06] Hearts, but that doesn't mean he has millions of dollars of sales.

[51:10] No, no, no, that's what I was saying.

[51:11] I was like, well, I'm in his factory is like, Chris, there's four million dollars in parts.

[51:17] And I'm like, well, but why are why are there millions of dollars in parts in this factory?

[51:23] Why aren't they in games being built?

[51:25] But you know, it's like that doesn't seem smart.

[51:27] Because there's no, there's no interest in if you don't have an order for the game, you're

[51:33] not going to build it.

[51:34] I mean, of course they're going to sit there.

[51:38] I mean, that's why that's why you know, Stern does a better job at kind of moderating.

[51:46] I mean, they've they've had some bombs, but moderating what they anticipate with their fluid

[51:52] production line, you know, the on and off and how many parts they're going to keep on

[51:56] hand.

[51:57] You know, what kind of back stock are they going to have?

[52:00] I mean, you got, I'm not going to not give Stern credit from the standpoint of being market

[52:07] and industrial leaders when it comes to pinball because they have all that experience.

[52:12] Of course they do.

[52:14] Right.

[52:16] Okay, so Stern is fine.

[52:18] Jersey Jack is always one day away from collapsing because the billionaire investor decides it's

[52:24] a no go.

[52:26] You know, the American pinball seemingly is financed by dovel and normals.

[52:34] Like, I think their dad has like the company that or the chip making company.

[52:38] Like, I don't know what they're, I don't know what their deal is.

[52:42] I don't think of them as a private, the same as as Jersey Jack as a private investor,

[52:47] but it has family ties.

[52:49] That's all right.

[52:50] Right.

[52:51] And Jerry, the same thing with Jerry, his family invested in P3.

[52:54] I can't imagine what those family meals are like when they're like, where's our return

[52:59] on this watching total nuclear annihilation, cell 550 units and they haven't sold 100

[53:05] P3s yet.

[53:07] Spooky razor thin margins on that in that company.

[53:11] Definitely have been ice skating lately razor thin.

[53:17] And it's, but, but you know, he's in Benton, Wisconsin.

[53:20] He's got really cheap overhead.

[53:21] I think he's, he's like monthly rent is like a dollar, he said once.

[53:27] He's got the sort of the community coupled with everything else of the, the, the small town

[53:31] mentality and the aspects that'll keep him going for a while until, you know, the pinball,

[53:39] you know, revival, he goes bust with the next economy and things slow down.

[53:43] And then he's going to have to, he's going to have to reevaluate.

[53:47] You know, that is when you see rubber re-throw.

[53:50] And I'm not here to talk about a bubble again, because I already see that the, the, the

[53:55] signs of a continued recession and the development because, you know, this is all, you know, we're

[54:01] talking about first world problems here with pinball.

[54:04] Yeah.

[54:05] Yeah.

[54:06] Yeah, with all of things going on, you know, the 99 things going on the world out of 100,

[54:11] pinball is not one of them.

[54:13] Yeah.

[54:14] It's just amazing with all the people in the world that are having problems and we worry

[54:19] about buying new inbox games.

[54:21] It's pretty, it makes you humble, doesn't it?

[54:24] I mean, this is like 0.00001 percent of society, like understands any of this.

[54:31] Like, I go out and nobody can relate to any of this.

[54:35] I mean, as Ben Heck said, the majority of Americans can't even pay a $500.

[54:41] That is a big point.

[54:42] A death of the O.

[54:43] But that, that is a scary thing when you think that now the actual number I read was 40%

[54:48] of all Americans cannot afford an emergency debt of more than $500.

[54:55] Right.

[54:56] In a, in a single one.

[54:58] And that is really scary.

[55:00] And of course, we're not here to get political, but we all know what we're thinking about.

[55:05] Basically, what's been going on with our US government.

[55:07] Right.

[55:08] So, but that being said, okay, so like I think in overarching theme on this show, Chris,

[55:16] has been there's a lot of pinball.

[55:19] We're supposedly supposed to celebrate.

[55:21] This is the golden error, the rebirth of pinball.

[55:25] And I've sort of said over and over again, I don't think most of these games are great.

[55:29] Like, I don't like cool.

[55:30] I get it.

[55:31] There's a lot of companies.

[55:33] I don't really see a lot of magic.

[55:35] And I still feel a lot of repeating.

[55:37] I see a lot of rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

[55:41] Hey, let's make sure we get deep code to support those tournament players, rinse and repeat,

[55:46] rinse and repeat.

[55:47] I mean, there I just, I just have, and that's what has kind of disenfranchised me because

[55:52] I've got a lot of people that say, oh, but the new games are so great.

[55:55] I says, well, no, it's, you know, reminds me of this or reminds me of that or it has this

[56:00] feature.

[56:01] You know, innovation is, is hard, but it's not impossible.

[56:05] Right.

[56:06] There, there are people out there.

[56:08] I mean, the only thing I could say good for good hope that we haven't talked about is,

[56:12] what's going to happen with deep group?

[56:14] Are you going to sink if they're going to swim?

[56:15] Yeah, let's talk about it.

[56:17] All right, let's talk about it.

[56:18] It's like good mythical morning, right?

[56:20] I mean, I got, I got, I got, I got, can I, before we talk about this, can I tell you

[56:23] what I heard this week?

[56:24] Sure.

[56:25] Someone sent me a cryptic note and said, I saw magic girl.

[56:30] You're going to really want it.

[56:33] Boom.

[56:34] Okay.

[56:35] I don't know, I don't know what to do with that, but Chris, go on.

[56:37] I've heard that about a lot of stuff, but cool, cool, cool.

[56:41] The greatest pinball machine is the one you've never seen.

[56:44] No, he say so.

[56:46] I've seen a lot.

[56:47] That's how it is in this hobby, right?

[56:50] We're always like the, the, the, the thing that's around the corner is always going to

[56:54] be the one we've been waiting for.

[56:56] Yeah, once you stop buying it, hype, you're better and happier person.

[56:59] That's a, I've stopped buying into the hype.

[57:01] I'm much happier.

[57:02] I am very happy for you on that, Chris.

[57:04] Congratulations.

[57:05] Okay.

[57:06] So deep root.

[57:07] What are your thoughts?

[57:08] Well, we all know that obviously we're going to come to T.P.F. and that's unfortunate.

[57:12] I hope that they have their ducks in a row and based on what they say and they're able

[57:17] to do a least experimental prototype, you know, showing something.

[57:25] Can I explain another reason why they're not going to be there?

[57:28] Because I had like a cryptic like reason why they're not going to be there.

[57:34] Someone very high up in the organization is in love and going to wed going to wed during

[57:41] that time period.

[57:42] So that is why they will not be there.

[57:45] Okay.

[57:46] Well, I mean that's their prerogative.

[57:47] I mean, yeah.

[57:48] No, love, love super seers.

[57:49] They're retaining.

[57:50] Yeah.

[57:51] Love they receive spin ball.

[57:53] But okay.

[57:54] So what go on?

[57:55] Well, my biggest, my biggest concern is, okay, they're not going to be a T.P.F.

[57:58] No problem.

[57:59] I already said, and from my standpoint, when we talked the last time specifically about

[58:03] it was that the year of 2019 is, you know, show me, you know, it's show me what you got.

[58:11] You know, they made such bold claims early on.

[58:14] If they don't show something, at least, you know, even if it's a, you know, tantalizing

[58:21] tidbit of a game or games in their potential, you know, Stockholm inventory of the future,

[58:31] then in my opinion, they've already deflated their company somewhat because people are

[58:36] going to see up.

[58:37] It didn't come true.

[58:38] Here we go again, you know, more false promises.

[58:42] Right.

[58:43] Right.

[58:44] And they have, I mean, they've retained some great experienced people in the pinball

[58:49] electronics, audiovisual technology world.

[58:55] Period.

[58:56] So time to shut up and show me what you got.

[59:01] And if they don't want to show to T.P.F.

[59:03] And they want to wait until I don't know the old Chicago pinball expo fine.

[59:10] But if they let 2019 come and go and don't show a damn thing, they're not doing a very good

[59:16] service to themselves.

[59:18] Right.

[59:19] Right.

[59:20] They've made promises that they said they could that they that they didn't keep.

[59:25] Right.

[59:26] Well, look, they, the real date for these guys is June because June is when they are

[59:34] contractually obligated to get the Zidware customers a game.

[59:41] That is in the deal they sign with Zidware customers.

[59:43] So that is, that is really the maker break date.

[59:47] T.P.F. was was a nice to have.

[59:51] But you know, we will know by June.

[59:55] Here's, here's my take.

[59:56] I don't think they want to make a Chris.

[59:58] I think they're going to be late for jails my prediction.

[01:00:02] But, but all they have to do in June is it.

[01:00:06] Well, again, let's let's, they say they were going to ship in June or did they say they

[01:00:10] were going to reveal on June.

[01:00:12] I think they just need to show.

[01:00:16] I think they need to ship.

[01:00:17] I don't remember.

[01:00:18] They need to ship, I think.

[01:00:19] It says, I can't remember what they said in their in their in their prophecy.

[01:00:22] But I guess the other part is this there aren't that many.

[01:00:27] Zidware people who took the agreement.

[01:00:31] So we might be talking maybe 50 people probably less.

[01:00:34] I would say like 20.

[01:00:35] Yeah, there wasn't that many.

[01:00:36] I would say like 20 people actually are in on this.

[01:00:40] So the deal is that these people will be made whole by that date or there is, you know,

[01:00:48] there or deep root is in void of contract with these individuals.

[01:00:54] And but then they then you think about it like well, then what are these individuals supposed

[01:00:57] to actually do because are they supposed to sue deep root for?

[01:01:01] It's, it's, it's messy.

[01:01:03] It's, it's silly.

[01:01:04] Nothing will happen other than the fact that Zidware, you know, customers will be burned

[01:01:09] again.

[01:01:10] Yeah, more first rule problems as I call it.

[01:01:15] So here's, here's, here's what I think is going to happen.

[01:01:17] I, I don't know much.

[01:01:20] I know that deep root has a lot of people work in there.

[01:01:23] There's no money coming in.

[01:01:25] There is investor dollars paying all these people.

[01:01:28] Like I said, it's either, Chris, it's either going to be like the greatest home run or

[01:01:34] the biggest whiff in the history of hype when it comes to new pinball companies.

[01:01:40] Yeah.

[01:01:41] I don't think there's a little comment down the plate soon enough.

[01:01:44] Yeah.

[01:01:45] I mean, like all I know is this.

[01:01:47] I think Robert is well aware of all of that.

[01:01:53] And I just can't imagine this being another like highway, another Dutch pinball.

[01:01:57] I, I, because it's just, it's not, well, it's not structured the same because he didn't,

[01:02:03] I mean, he has the developmental investor dollars that back the company and he has the

[01:02:08] town involved in it.

[01:02:09] I mean, they're, they're structured as a company much more safely than Dutch pinball ever

[01:02:17] was.

[01:02:18] Touch is done.

[01:02:19] Highway is done.

[01:02:21] Deep root is they can't be done because they haven't even begun.

[01:02:27] It's going to be an interesting 2019.

[01:02:29] I, I, I mean, part of me is, here's my,

[01:02:33] if I were to be honest with you, Chris, I look at all of this hobby right now and I see

[01:02:38] these people spending $9,000 for games I've never played.

[01:02:42] And I'm almost like, if I was a pinball manufacturer, what would motivate me is more the stupidity

[01:02:50] of the buyer versus the desire to make a great game.

[01:02:53] Well, I can share one thing that you didn't have and discuss before, which I think is

[01:02:58] you think and people should think about this.

[01:03:00] There's a lot of desensitation, desensitation in regards to pricing these days.

[01:03:07] You know, we're, remember, you know, up to a few years ago, you made the joke with Ben,

[01:03:11] it's like it seems like it was a million mile, you know, million years ago that you were

[01:03:16] discussing some of it, but, you know, $9,000, five years ago would have been thought to

[01:03:22] be absurd.

[01:03:24] It is absurd.

[01:03:25] It is absurd today, but nobody thinks that.

[01:03:28] Yeah, but for people, it's much more accepted now.

[01:03:30] People are like, oh, but we're getting this LE and it's, there's a desensitation of what

[01:03:37] is acceptable.

[01:03:38] And it's like what I described before, you know, as Stern has continued to remove either

[01:03:44] features or hardware or quality control issues or, you know, it's accepted.

[01:03:52] You know, people say, well, that's just the way it is.

[01:03:54] No, it's not the way it used to be.

[01:03:57] You know what made me so sad is that the number one question people had around the monsters

[01:04:05] was whether or not Stern just put in like a $10 metal cabinet bracket in the game because

[01:04:15] they took those out.

[01:04:18] And we're at the point now we're like, everything that should have been in there is now applauded

[01:04:24] for being returned to the game.

[01:04:27] And these are cheap parts.

[01:04:28] Well, it's because people aren't aware that before that was a standard.

[01:04:32] Well, and people were, and cabinets were splitting because Stern was removing simple

[01:04:39] things that made games.

[01:04:41] Right.

[01:04:42] And now we're full circle.

[01:04:43] Now we're full circle and people are going, oh, but this is so great.

[01:04:46] What are we talking about?

[01:04:48] We've been.

[01:04:49] These are $10 parts.

[01:04:50] Well, every little part counts, unfortunately, and that's the sad part is that that, you

[01:04:56] know, if you look closely in it and it doesn't just apply to Stern, it also applies to other

[01:05:02] companies, if you look really close at some of the games, you'll see where they, oh,

[01:05:08] they took this out or they took that out or maybe they could have done that better.

[01:05:14] I'm sorry.

[01:05:15] I mean, that's why I stick with the classics.

[01:05:17] And that's another reason why I think the remakes are, you know, as good as they are on

[01:05:23] the rise because at least you know exactly what you're getting.

[01:05:27] If they tried to take out the mothership from attack for more and just have us a three

[01:05:33] stand up target and a ship that didn't move, people would call, people would call CGC out

[01:05:39] and say, you're cutting costs.

[01:05:43] Right.

[01:05:44] Because they did, played it before and they said, well, this was a really cool feature,

[01:05:48] even though it was simple as hell because it was just a solenoid that moved it.

[01:05:53] How much do you think a Stern, Elisha, cost?

[01:05:56] Well, in a perfect world, I think it would cost 6,000 if it's fully featured.

[01:06:04] And that would be on par with current.

[01:06:08] And that is where they were before Jersey Jack showed them a new high.

[01:06:15] Yeah, but they have to be fully featured, not just new slapstick graphics on the freaking

[01:06:21] cap.

[01:06:22] You know, it's crazy.

[01:06:23] You know, that's exactly what Lord, the rings, cost with all those features in it.

[01:06:30] Once again, you're talking, if you, if some people say you're comparing apples to oranges,

[01:06:36] it's not the same.

[01:06:37] You're absolutely right.

[01:06:38] It wasn't the same.

[01:06:39] It was better.

[01:06:40] Games were better.

[01:06:42] The games were better.

[01:06:43] The games had more and then the games had more.

[01:06:45] Why didn't people come to the realization now?

[01:06:47] I like 20, 30 years later.

[01:06:50] Because unfortunately, a lot of these 90s games that we treasure so much are, they are

[01:06:55] all unfortunately, they are coming to the end of their prime as well, not just from the

[01:07:00] standpoint as a sort, it's smaller from the source of being as a source of entertainment.

[01:07:07] I mean, pinball is a whole 30 years or so.

[01:07:10] Now I have to agree with you based in a way that things are going.

[01:07:15] It'll be relegated to history.

[01:07:18] Right.

[01:07:19] Right.

[01:07:20] But it's cool.

[01:07:21] When you hear Chris, I read a quote from Zach Sharp, who is the marketing director at Stern

[01:07:26] Pinball.

[01:07:27] Yep.

[01:07:29] Fun equals value.

[01:07:31] It's irrelevant whether a game costs $1,000, $10,000 or $100,000.

[01:07:37] As long as the game is fun, it doesn't matter what it costs.

[01:07:40] What do you think about that kind of sentiment coming from Stern's marketing director?

[01:07:45] I think if it's worded properly within their own game context, I guess it doesn't really

[01:07:50] hurt them.

[01:07:51] I mean, I agree with the statement because I've got games that are sub $1,000 that I think

[01:07:56] are great fun in or 50 years old.

[01:07:59] No, but what he's saying is if the game is fun, it doesn't matter if it's $100,000.

[01:08:06] Well, it's got to be in about every plane of the gold and has all sorts of weird features

[01:08:12] on it if it's going to cost that much because that's where we're at now.

[01:08:16] Is that Stern is just on this continued cycle of every single Stern L.E. is $9,000 regardless

[01:08:24] how good it is, regardless how innovative it is.

[01:08:28] It's a buttercherner.

[01:08:29] It's a buttercherner.

[01:08:30] Look, they're going to ride this.

[01:08:31] They're going to ride this wave and buttercherner like a surfer for as long as they possibly

[01:08:36] can until the economy drops.

[01:08:40] At that point, they're going to scale back to a certain, let in one, two games a year

[01:08:45] and they will survive and move on if they choose to do so based on their investor council.

[01:08:51] That's what's going to happen.

[01:08:52] And the rest of the companies are going to struggle to survive if they survive.

[01:08:56] Why do you think these other companies are, what do you think they're all making a mistake

[01:09:01] trying to compete with Stern at the same price point, the same, like what, how do you compete

[01:09:06] with no distribution model, same price point, higher overhead?

[01:09:12] They have to, I mean, obviously they have to be aware of what they call us.

[01:09:15] What is the acceptable going rate of a game today, you know, from the standpoint of

[01:09:20] Robert, which of course is Benchmark at a Stern Pro.

[01:09:26] And then it goes up from there in terms of whatever features.

[01:09:28] Boy, you asked a good, this is a good question.

[01:09:32] It's hard to answer because you're, that's a tough one only because you're talking about

[01:09:38] each company has to analyze what Stern is already doing well because they have to analyze

[01:09:45] the market constantly and finding out what the, you know, what, what, what they are setting

[01:09:51] the bar right now, what can the market bear?

[01:09:54] They watch.

[01:09:55] Do you think they do that though?

[01:09:57] How does it, but how does it come here?

[01:10:00] They can say how much can we raise prices and people will still buy the game or how much

[01:10:05] can we take out of a specific game and people won't, and people will still buy it?

[01:10:11] I mean, right.

[01:10:13] I think, I think Jersey Jack's mentality is not been stern, but he of course gets hit

[01:10:18] with the bomb and of course the additional design.

[01:10:21] I mean, I'm aware of one of three of the original prototype Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:10:28] That's what I love the question when somebody asked it in that Twilight Zone 65,000 thread

[01:10:32] of, well, if this is $65,000, what does a Pirates of the Caribbean Jersey Jack pinball game

[01:10:38] with three spinners, what would it go for?

[01:10:41] I think that's a great question.

[01:10:43] I've got one of them is here.

[01:10:46] One of them is in Washington as part of a sale.

[01:10:49] I might ask, what would you pay for it?

[01:10:50] But I bet it wasn't 65,000 bucks.

[01:10:53] Right, right, right.

[01:10:55] No, I hope not.

[01:10:58] I mean, like it's, it's interesting to me because I, I do believe that Stern has shown

[01:11:06] every company out there what you need to do to succeed, not just from like a manufacturing

[01:11:12] standpoint, but just the reality of the marketplace.

[01:11:15] But when I see games like October Fest, Chris, I just, I throw my hands in the air and I

[01:11:20] say, fuck all these other companies.

[01:11:22] They don't, they don't understand market research.

[01:11:25] They're just making a game and they, they're just making a game in a vacuum.

[01:11:29] I, once again, I will agree with you in that point that I think that October Fest was

[01:11:34] done partially in a vacuum, no matter how well it plays.

[01:11:39] Theme is very important.

[01:11:42] And I agree with Ben Hack when he interviewed with you because I did listen to his that

[01:11:48] a unthemed game versus a themed game.

[01:11:51] Today, whatever people want to say, I agree with them that theme games are king.

[01:11:56] Right.

[01:11:57] They absolutely are.

[01:11:59] It is proven.

[01:12:00] Stern knows it.

[01:12:01] They are going to lock up everything that makes sense for them to make a pinball machine

[01:12:05] and they're going to use it accordingly.

[01:12:07] And that, that could be the Achilles heel of deep root because we know that there, I

[01:12:13] think they're letting these designers make a lot of original IP.

[01:12:17] They have to be a very aggressive advertising campaign when they released or potentially

[01:12:23] are going to release the games.

[01:12:28] Sorry, you may have been in poor connection.

[01:12:31] I just saw it.

[01:12:32] No, but like pinball advertising is like nonexistent.

[01:12:35] I mean, I like what they're going to need.

[01:12:38] You know, that's what's hard, right?

[01:12:40] It's like really easy to be like, here's JAWS pinball, right?

[01:12:45] Take my money now.

[01:12:47] And then they're like, here's still got to advertise it somewhere.

[01:12:50] Here's retro atomic zombie eventralan.

[01:12:53] Like what?

[01:12:54] What?

[01:12:55] You know, like I think that you're right.

[01:12:59] I think that theme and Ben is right because Ben saw this.

[01:13:01] That is right because it's the people who are, I mean, he said it, he said it right.

[01:13:06] I'm not here to be a peacock or a parent, but he said it right.

[01:13:10] Who is buying the games?

[01:13:12] The old guys that want to reminisce of their past history for themes that they remember

[01:13:18] make sense to me.

[01:13:20] I do that with games that I buy that are old games too.

[01:13:25] Absolutely.

[01:13:26] And so that's the reason why I stick with my older games because that's what appeals to me.

[01:13:32] It's interesting because Stern seems to be looking more towards the past and the future

[01:13:37] with these new themes because everything I'm hearing lately is older stuff.

[01:13:42] It's Elvira, it's Superman, it's James Bond, it's, you know, I don't see like, have

[01:13:49] a tar too.

[01:13:50] Yeah.

[01:13:51] They'll throw in a Guardians of the Galaxy, for example, when it was hot, you know, because

[01:13:57] it was a hot license.

[01:13:59] I mean, if they could get a Harry Potter, which we know has been a struggle forever, you

[01:14:05] know, that would be a good license because it's still popular.

[01:14:08] What about him?

[01:14:10] What about him?

[01:14:11] He's five ventures, but you know, I mean, I mean, Chris, you know, and we're definitely

[01:14:17] on the hour point now.

[01:14:18] So we'll definitely get you back on soon.

[01:14:21] Could you give any advice to newer companies that are just thinking of throwing their efforts

[01:14:26] into the pinball ring?

[01:14:28] Like, is it worth it?

[01:14:29] I see like Tokyo drift.

[01:14:30] I see like this like, what's this new, like Dirty Donny went over to another pinball company

[01:14:36] and now to make that pinball carnival?

[01:14:38] Like, is time shock even happening?

[01:14:40] I know you know about that.

[01:14:41] I mean, it's been installed for about a year and a half.

[01:14:45] I heard very much more development on that.

[01:14:49] So they did, I mean, they did secure the use of the operate of the license and so on,

[01:14:55] but they just, it's a home group, more of a home group project than anything else.

[01:14:59] Right.

[01:15:00] The biggest thing that any company has to do and it would be more a keen to your area

[01:15:05] is any potential company that would want to get into the pinball market must absolutely

[01:15:12] evaluate the market based on the number of companies, the number of machines that are

[01:15:17] going in on a yearly basis, the general popularly demographics of not just who buys the game,

[01:15:26] but how many they buy along with operators.

[01:15:28] I mean, they have to do all this homework like anybody, for example, that let's say it's

[01:15:34] comparative to a guy in a American city that wants to open up a large arcade and

[01:15:40] bratural arcade.

[01:15:42] You know, it can't support what he wants to do.

[01:15:47] And to my mind right now, I think we're over-saturated.

[01:15:52] I even though the market as a whole in terms of new pinball buyers for a new inbox has grown,

[01:16:00] we're still a very small hobby, which makes it hard to swallow when you have six or eight

[01:16:06] pinball developers all trying to buy for personal dollars.

[01:16:10] So that analysis that I'm talking about, which is partly what Deeproot did in conjunction

[01:16:17] before they were when they were at the same time simultaneously searching out talent,

[01:16:23] which I applauded them to.

[01:16:25] I was surprised that they were able to get as many people as they did, but obviously

[01:16:31] the deep pockets is deep, you know, deep root.

[01:16:35] Well, we know they're paying very competitively.

[01:16:37] And the market is oversaturated.

[01:16:40] I mean, anyone who listens to this show, anyone who follows pinball, you go on and you

[01:16:45] see the plethora of games for sale with very low plays and mint condition, couple that

[01:16:51] with all the new inbox games, couple that with people running out of room in their homes,

[01:16:57] couple that with people's wives getting sick of seeing 10 pinball machines in the living

[01:17:01] room.

[01:17:02] It's going to get to the point where like, I think everyone's going to wake up and be like,

[01:17:08] I'm good.

[01:17:09] I don't need another one.

[01:17:12] I don't need to spend another 9,000 every three months.

[01:17:16] Well, it's already started that happened.

[01:17:18] Like I said, it's just, you just the growth of the number of collectors does not support

[01:17:24] the volume of games, especially since use games starting from 2,000 pounds.

[01:17:29] There's more many factors.

[01:17:31] There's more than a lot of them now, Chris, than when pinball was in its heyday.

[01:17:34] Yeah, there were.

[01:17:35] You're absolutely right in the 90s that it's pinnacle.

[01:17:38] There is more collect, there's more manufacturers today.

[01:17:41] Yeah.

[01:17:42] And you know it and no one understands marketing because the white space is targeting the millionaire

[01:17:50] and no one knows how to do it properly.

[01:17:52] Nobody.

[01:17:53] They're all just like, they're all trying to compete with Stern.

[01:17:57] Well, I think there is still some vestiges towards trying to support operators as well

[01:18:02] on a limited basis.

[01:18:04] There is.

[01:18:05] I mean, they don't want to completely give it up.

[01:18:07] But the operator is Stern Pro.

[01:18:12] Yeah, absolutely.

[01:18:13] If I'm an operator, that's what I'm buying.

[01:18:16] A $5,000 theme that everyone loves that I can make money on.

[01:18:22] When I see operators put LEDs on location, I'm like, you're stupid.

[01:18:27] It happens all the time, but I mean, I'm stupid.

[01:18:30] I'm not here to judge.

[01:18:32] I thought that was, I thought it was pretty crazy that up here in Washington, I can go play

[01:18:36] a big Lebowski on location.

[01:18:38] So I mean, when I see people do that, I thought that was awesome for a buck.

[01:18:43] I could go play it.

[01:18:44] I mean, it was pretty cool.

[01:18:46] I mean, I don't think that's the guy that was selling.

[01:18:48] That guy is two of them.

[01:18:49] He's selling the other one.

[01:18:50] But I don't, I also, I didn't follow the phrase.

[01:18:54] Well, the same thing I saw here in New York, Pent Owl, who's the big operator, he put his

[01:19:01] Batman super limited edition on location.

[01:19:07] And every time I make more money, he's not.

[01:19:10] Every time I go to the game, it's beat up, it's destroyed.

[01:19:13] Nobody cares that it's a super limited edition, which is only of appeal to collectors.

[01:19:18] It's weird.

[01:19:19] Well, there is a small falling with the, I want to see the more advanced version.

[01:19:25] There's nothing more advanced in super limited edition Batman.

[01:19:28] No, no, no, I'm not disagreeing with that point.

[01:19:31] I am saying that there is a, there is a, there is a small crowd of players that do want

[01:19:36] to see these higher end games in locations, because they, they want to be able to play

[01:19:44] him since they're part of this enthusiast, Millennial revival crowd.

[01:19:49] And I see that in front of me.

[01:19:50] That's even what Stern made the premium for, right?

[01:19:52] It's like, oh, absolutely.

[01:19:53] If they're the same, in most cases, they are to the LE.

[01:20:00] Yeah.

[01:20:01] Like, I think that if you're an operator, Stern Pro is your cash cow.

[01:20:07] I mean, it's 5,500 bucks at most and it's themes that people love.

[01:20:12] And then that's why I look at all the new manufacturers.

[01:20:16] And I'm like, you guys don't get it.

[01:20:18] Like, you're not going to be Stern on the pro front.

[01:20:20] You're not going to beat them with license.

[01:20:23] You've, then you've got to go give the collector something special.

[01:20:27] And I, you got to beat them with a punch.

[01:20:30] Yeah, is what you got to do.

[01:20:31] And it's tough.

[01:20:32] Yeah, you got to, like, you know, the guy you had it all figured out from the collector

[01:20:37] standpoint was John Papaduke.

[01:20:39] He, if Zidware succeeded, he knew what they wanted.

[01:20:43] They wanted a rare game that was, you know what rich people want?

[01:20:46] They want to feel rich.

[01:20:47] I always, it's amazing to me how like, how, how like the problem is.

[01:20:54] And Ben Heck said this.

[01:20:55] And this is why I think he was, he's so mad at Charlie.

[01:20:59] Is Charlie wouldn't like let him add price to get his license on his evil dead game.

[01:21:06] Is because Charlie still thinks he's doing this for the good of pinball.

[01:21:11] And he's not doing it for the collector.

[01:21:14] It's for, it's for expanding pinball.

[01:21:17] Give me a break.

[01:21:18] I'm not going to make him a lot of money.

[01:21:19] No, I'm making him a lot of money because, you know, at the end of the day, what it

[01:21:23] was making a thousand dollars a game and to art to your point, Stern's making three,

[01:21:27] four, five thousand dollars a game like it's art.

[01:21:31] And they, and their, and their volume is 10 times his, a hundred times his like it's,

[01:21:36] uh, well, Chris, I always appreciate you coming on.

[01:21:40] This is a pivotal week because this, this is the final week of the Twippy votes.

[01:21:46] Have you voted?

[01:21:47] This bumped the good luck.

[01:21:48] Have you voted yet?

[01:21:50] Have you voted?

[01:21:51] Of course I have.

[01:21:52] All right.

[01:21:53] Now for all of you out there, it is important to go to this weekend pinball and vote.

[01:21:57] And then not just for this pinball podcast, but I think recognition for all the hard working

[01:22:03] men and women, I think it's, I don't think there's any women associated with any devoting

[01:22:08] on, on the ballots.

[01:22:11] But it is important, I think, to recognize the best in the industry.

[01:22:14] And I think Jeff and Zach have done a great job at creating a platform in which the people

[01:22:21] who love this hobby can, can voice their accolades.

[01:22:27] So go vote is my final sign off.

[01:22:31] Chris, anything else that you want to say before we let you go?

[01:22:33] All right.

[01:22:34] Like I said, I just, I, I hope that people reminisce about Twilight Zone $65,000 that they become

[01:22:44] more inclined at, you know, it's like I said, if you're, if you're wanting to drop a

[01:22:48] lot of money into anything that's a toy of the nature, please do your homework.

[01:22:55] Okay.

[01:22:56] Know what you're buying because it will save you.

[01:22:59] Udels of heartache later.

[01:23:01] Right.

[01:23:02] It just, it will.

[01:23:04] And like I said, I've just seen too many people first time buyers, new buyers, even

[01:23:12] old buyers make that mistake.

[01:23:16] And it, and I mean, it really can turn you sour.

[01:23:19] And I don't, and it doesn't help.

[01:23:21] Chris, that game, let's be honest, that game is like,

[01:23:26] 60, it's like $50,000 over price.

[01:23:31] It's, let me think about it.

[01:23:33] Yeah, you're about right.

[01:23:34] That's insane.

[01:23:37] I have, yeah, it just, you know, I know it, any logical person that's in

[01:23:43] been in the hobby for a while recognizes it's overpriced, but it did service

[01:23:47] purpose and it got them noticed.

[01:23:50] Right.

[01:23:51] It sure did.

[01:23:51] Well, I'm going to list my Batman for sale for $800,000.

[01:23:54] So guys,

[01:23:57] bid while you still get Chris, thank you so much for all the best.

[01:24:01] Keep flipping.

[01:24:02] Yeah.

[01:24:03] Take breaks if you need it.

[01:24:04] Don't burn yourself out because that's a travesty to the hobby.

[01:24:08] Nobody should, you know, leave the hobby because they get burned out.

[01:24:11] Right.

[01:24:12] And, and, and that's a good point because I think all of us go through periods

[01:24:15] where you need to take a break.

[01:24:17] You need to just not go on a pen side for a few weeks.

[01:24:19] You need to not think about pinball and come back with a, a more sort of

[01:24:23] refreshed outlook on it all because at the end of the day,

[01:24:27] it's a nonessential toy that you never cost $65,000.

[01:24:33] Oh, the insanity.

[01:24:36] Chris, thank you so much.

[01:24:37] And we'll have you on again soon.

[01:24:39] It's been a long time, but we appreciate your return.

[01:24:42] Oh, problem.

[01:24:42] All right.

[01:24:43] Later on.

[01:24:53] I knew it could take a while.

[01:24:55] And I just screaming.

[01:24:56] But my, my, my, my mind.
