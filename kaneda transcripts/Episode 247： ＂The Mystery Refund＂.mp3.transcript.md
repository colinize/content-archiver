[00:00] I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody, no way there.

[00:07] But first I love it, I can't keep it to myself.

[00:12] Oh no.

[00:21] We're gonna start out episode 247 of Canadian Super Dupor Pimball Podcast

[00:27] by asking someone in the Pimball World a simple question.

[00:31] We're actually gonna ask Christopher Fransche how many Pimball Podcast shows he's gonna do in a single year.

[00:37] Hold on, I'm gonna get him for you right now.

[00:38] Hey Chris, how many Pimball shows can you possibly do in one year?

[00:44] Ben, what is he doing?

[00:46] Ben, you'll never get anything this way.

[00:48] 14, 15, 16, 17, I'm sorry.

[00:52] I'm sorry sir, I think.

[00:54] I think he's gonna set the record for the most Pimball Podcast interviews done in one year.

[01:06] But we'll see, he's still got about like another 10 to go.

[01:09] So, I kid, I kid.

[01:11] Anyway, so here's what we're gonna do in episode 247 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[01:15] I will read some of the emails I've received since my last podcast where we talked a little bit about a secret new game.

[01:22] I wanna talk a little bit about some stern issues that I'm seeing on the forum.

[01:27] We'll cover what's going on in some of the other manufacturer worlds.

[01:31] Not too much is going on, it's the summertime.

[01:33] I do wanna read someone's comment that I love it because I know they know I read Pinsides.

[01:38] So, when people really wanna communicate to me, they don't email me.

[01:43] They don't ever wanna come on the show.

[01:44] They have to write these long tie raids on Pinside about a certain podcaster.

[01:50] So, I wanna read about what someone wrote in the Big Lebowski thread,

[01:55] which I think is just hysterical when I read this, what this person is claiming.

[01:58] And then, and then I'm gonna let you have your evenings or your mornings or your day back.

[02:04] So, we're gonna do it like that, alright?

[02:05] So, here's what I wanna talk about first.

[02:07] So, if you go into, there's an ACDC Lucy thread on Pinside where someone is having a quality control issue.

[02:17] Okay, and I know that we sometimes can harp about Stern quality and are the games being built as well as they used to have been built.

[02:28] And Stern makes thousands of games, right?

[02:31] So, it's always really hard to tell if the quality control issues that people do talk about on Pinside are widespread,

[02:40] or it's just a few people who might have received stuff that has an issue.

[02:44] And it's impossible, because I also think the majority of people who buy Stern Pimbal machines are not on Pinside,

[02:52] they wouldn't even notice an issue if it occurred.

[02:55] And they're not gonna complain about every dimple.

[02:59] And if they're play field chipped on their Pimbal machine that's inside their game room and they're not an OCD collector fanatic,

[03:07] they'll never give a shit and they'll never report on it and we'll never hear about it.

[03:11] Or there might just be hardly any issues that hit most of the Stern machines that go out there.

[03:17] But as someone who is also having a quality control issue on a $100,000 car, the stitching on my Dodge Demon Steering Wheel is coming undone a little bit, stuff happens.

[03:30] Stuff happens. Now, when it comes to identifying a problem on Pinside, that's where it just gets interesting,

[03:37] because it's easy to highlight one person's game and then just blanket a salt or insult Stern as being a company that's just cutting corners.

[03:47] But I want to talk about the issue this person is having. So they have an ACDC Lucy that is five years old, that has about 1,063 plays on it.

[03:57] And they looked at their lower play field and on it to their Shagrin, they saw that the lower play field had a chip and looked about the size of like half of a penny.

[04:08] Some of the artwork had come off and fallen down. And so we all know what happens when your play field chips and an area starts to wear like that, it's going to continue to wear.

[04:19] Now, it's in a lower play field section of ACDC that's five years old. So we contact Stern and Stern tells them the game is past the 90 day warranty period on the title, right? It's five years old.

[04:32] And they are not going to replace the lower play field for free. So that led to some of the discussion of should a manufacturer stand behind its product beyond the warranty period.

[04:45] And I have to say no, like we come on, you can't expect companies who provide a warranty to cover an item that is five years old and is far past the warranty period of coverage.

[04:57] That's just, that's not fair. It's not fair to expect Stern to give you something for free. It's also not a huge humongous problem.

[05:07] It's probably a little bit hard to mile or that area because the lower play field, I think it's a little bit difficult. I think it just swaps out in that one.

[05:16] Now, this is why Stern and the new ACDC Lucy Vault Edition, they included the screws on the top of the play field. So I think you could clean the the plexi that was fogging up or you could get access to the lower play field easier than before.

[05:32] Okay, but back to what we're talking about. So they were in their right not to replace the part. Now, the thing is this, if this guy wants a new lower play field, he should just go buy one.

[05:44] I mean, they're available. You can go get it. It's going to cost you a few hundred bucks and if and and problem solved. But I don't think Stern should do anything for someone who has a game that old. It's just not not not fair.

[05:58] Because then everyone who's got games that are old, who has wear and tear happening, would expect to have the same type of treatment. So I think there's that. I also think 90 days for a warranty period on a pinball machine is really short.

[06:12] Like, can we talk about that 90 days? That's not a lot of time to warranty the stuff that's in a game and especially because these games now are somewhat costing the price of a cheap car.

[06:25] I would expect the manufacturers to stand behind the products longer than that. So I would I would argue that I don't think we get enough warranty in modern pinball machines.

[06:36] And I also think stuff like cabinets and we see the cabinets cracking 90 days. A pinball cabinet should never crack. I would love to see a pinball cabinet have at least like a year or two year warranty that it won't crack when you own it.

[06:53] But you know, people throw their games around and and Stern is probably looking at this thing like once we've got your money, once it's out the door, you know, we have 90 days probably to cover more of like just electronics and things that could go wrong. But then we want to be clear of any any reliability or coverage that we have to provide.

[07:13] But here's the thing where the thread got interesting. So then someone with a brand new ACDC like vault edition posted an image of their ACDC Lucy vault lower play field and they took the picture from like an angle and it is gotta be if you go look at this thread it is gotta be the worst clear coding job I've ever seen on a new inbox pinball machine.

[07:39] And there's just absolutely no excuse for that. I mean it looks like they clear code it the lower play field and then hung in on the wall and all the clear code start to slide down and bubble up almost looks like a tangerine someone said clear code job.

[07:55] And then also on the edges of the lower play field the clear code is just horrible. There's just like creases on it. And so you have to wonder what the quality control inspection is like how could that get into the game like if you even just ran your hand across that person's lower play field.

[08:14] It would be it would not feel flat it would not feel like it should go into someone's game. And you know I know it's hard like I know it's hard like because Stern doesn't do the clear coding in house right they're getting a vendor to do the work they're opening up a box imagine opening up a box.

[08:35] And there's 50 lower play field in each box and there's hundreds of lower play fields because you just sold 1000 of these things or 500 of these things or God forbid like you sell 5000 star wars every single one every single one is not going to be perfect.

[08:54] But but we pay a lot for these games we pay a lot and Stern has all of these employees and they have this huge factory and they have people that should be.

[09:06] In fact, I'm expecting these games to the point where stuff like that doesn't go into the game so the good news on that person's game is Stern took the game back and they clearly saw that that game shouldn't have gone out and they took the game back or the distributor took the game back and that's the other thing in all these threads.

[09:23] When ever something happens with the Stern game where they are liable to cover or stand behind the product within the warranty period here's what they always do they always take care of the person.

[09:36] Now I know the Ghostbusters delay on swapping out play fields was an unforeseen nightmare for them. I mean that is that had to have been the biggest cluster fuck nightmare for Stern.

[09:51] And any manufacturer that has to swap out entire populated play fields to hundreds of people or you know a couple hundred people's machines or even a hundred people think about the nightmare that that was and I don't know if people are still waiting for their Ghostbusters play fields but I think because I don't read people talk about it I think they've taken care of everybody.

[10:15] So the takeaway here is Stern quality I think it's always going to be a little bit of a question mark. I think you're always going to not know exactly what you're going to get in your game.

[10:25] Like some people's cabinets split immediately some people's don't some people have clear code issues some don't but here's the good news they'll take care of you they they just will and I have to give credit where credits do on that point.

[10:38] Would I like these games to you know come with brackets inside the cabinets well how expensive is that to do it's see that's the thing that people harp on is they can clearly see where Stern could go a little bit further in protecting these games and making them more reliable and when you don't see stuff like that like why aren't they using metal brackets within the cabinets.

[11:05] It leads people to say hey look it's all about the bottom line they're cutting corners and I just think it'd be less of a headache for Stern if they would look at stuff like that and just do it in every game like wouldn't you just rather do that than have to be servicing people's cracked cabinets that's got to be more expensive in the long run if you ask me alright what else is going on in Stern world.

[11:28] Batman 66 nothing much people are waiting for code I think people are like gone to the point now in Batman where there's nothing else to do but nitpick now with some of the stuff I saw someone they talked about how when I think it's like the image of city hall pops up on the Batman TV screen there's two black bars it's like the only visual that is in formatted properly to the TV screen so we'll see if Stern adjusts that aspect ratio but literally that's a stupid.

[11:57] And nitpick as we're getting I've never noticed that I've owned Batman now for like almost a year I've actually never noticed or been annoyed by that once what else is going on in Stern world the monsters continues to be the one that people are speculating on and getting excited about here's my thing with the monsters I'm really excited about it it's going to probably look fantastic John Borg is going around telling people that it's like one of his favorite and best design games I don't know who's coding the game we do.

[12:27] Stern has hired a lot of coders so I do expect the monsters to ship with fairly complete code I don't think we're going to get like another Batman situation going but I have not seen anything on the monsters in terms of play field or design I have no idea I have no idea what's going on on that aspect of the game I do know the game is coming out because you know it's just it's as good as confirmed in terms of what I know but as far as the game itself it's complete mister to me and that's exciting I do

[12:57] like not having images leaked early and spoiling seeing what the final product is like is like when we're going to go spusters leaked it like kind of took all the fun out of it it also made people run in order one immediately because they saw zombie yet he's incredible artwork

[13:13] all right what else is going on nothing else in Stern world other than Stern continues to sell a ton of games spooky pinball Alice Cooper game number one went out and ended you and it went to the rock and roll hall of fame

[13:25] they people are getting a little anxious and I can tell that it looks like there at least in the 400 and something sold of the game I'm not sure if they're doing sales in numerical order but I think they do so I do think we're getting close to the game being sold out or spoken for of you know 500 names being on a list 50 which are going I believe to an Alice Cooper charity that they're going to auction off which is really cool

[13:54] so 500 people and it's got to feel good for Chuck it's got to feel good you know why because Chuck is in a place now where he can really wait until they're old like really really satisfied to put that game into customer number one's hands in their home because dialed in and that dialed in sorry total nuclear annihilation is on the line and when ever you have a boutique company you just always need everyone there to be working right it's the over the

[14:24] head is what kills these companies that is why when when you know when you have like Jack is suffering on getting the new game on a line or you know like American pinball is going to go to this when they transition to game two are who

[14:37] Dini still being ordered are they still selling enough to keep all the people they're working you know what's going on right now over at Chicago gaming company are people still ordering attack from

[14:49] Mars games and medieval madness games or our distributors like stocked up enough where like new orders are not coming in right I still see these games for sale from distributors so that's the key the key to

[15:03] pinball survival is you need to have your employees working and you need to always be making games when you have a factory and so Chuck is in a great place with TNA on the line okay so what else is going on so I like that

[15:17] Charlie's just like you know what everyone like we're going to start production rock on rock on hold on Brenda a Brenda's over try baby I fed Baba he's fed got a little personal

[15:27] a little personal news here on peanut is pinball podcast he's fed he's okay we're going to finish the show we're going to go have a great dinner love you all right we just

[15:35] trying to get him to rub his belly okay so back to the show people so JJ JJ P we're still waiting for pirates of the Caribbean production to begin

[15:46] it's interesting it's not really interesting it's just the delay is what it is it is what it is I've said my piece on pirates of the Caribbean you know how I feel about the game I want to play one I I

[15:59] bet I'll enjoy it I bet I'll enjoy it it's you know it's just what's really the thing to me and I want to discuss this because I mean look we're in the summertime people there's not a lot of

[16:08] news so I'm not I said it's not so much I can dig up or manufacture to entertain you but here's what I want to talk about with JJ P today I want to talk

[16:16] about collector's edition and what really makes sense when you're asking $12,500 for a game and do you even think a collector's

[16:27] edition makes any sense for Jersey Jack pinball and why do you think it is even like an option and clearly like Jack saw

[16:35] Stern just constantly makes money on these Ellie trims on hot titles and it's like take my money now take my money now like they

[16:44] sold out of iron made in Ellie's like that like they sold out at Ghostbusters Ellie's like that they probably sold every single

[16:49] Star Wars Ellie where there's like 800 of them like that right not the case for Guardians you know not the

[16:56] case for like WWE and some other titles but you know what I'm saying and Jack probably saw the $15,000

[17:02] Batman super early and was like I can do this and so we have the collector's editions now we know for a fact I think this is fact I if I'm

[17:11] wrong someone email me at canada pinballgmail.com that the first inaugural collectors edition game which was dialed in we're

[17:20] going to make 150 collectors editions did not sell out they did not sell all 150 collectors editions and I think Jack learned a

[17:30] lesson on that one we've talked about it there was no different art there was it wasn't enough difference to justify it like a ham and cheese

[17:37] Samu and a dialed in jacket is not going to cut it at that price and it did feel like they didn't really have a strategy and then we get to

[17:45] the collector's edition of Pirate of the Caribbean and you know it has the most amazing top ever Jack should never put that

[17:52] top or on another machine if you want people to buy but that really is the only reason why the only reason why I think you would even want to go

[18:01] in on a dial sorry a pirate the Caribbean collectors edition but how do you justify that it's $3,500 more than in L.E. of Pirate of the Caribbean $3,500 and I would actually say that I don't want to look at that ugly

[18:20] squid guy's face every day I don't think I think they should have made it the black pearl I think they should have made the black pearl edition I think

[18:27] should have like you know sparkly like or high gloss black armor everywhere should have the metallic foil like rad cow like ship on the side the ship on the top

[18:38] they should have made the art more like black pearl themed I think that would have been the way to go it's not what we're going to get again it's like and when you're asking $12,500

[18:50] you think you do a little bit more like R&D and focus group testing and it's in what would people really spend this money on the thing is this too is like I understand trying to appeal to Pat Lawler fans right Pat Lawler fanatics were probably the target of Pat Lawler's

[19:08] collector's edition of dialed in you know I think you will sell collector's editions of toy story of Willie Wonka I do but really who's really a pirate to the Caribbean movie

[19:19] fanatic at this point and that's that's the other thing too is I think people go in on the stern L.E.'s when it's just their dream theme and they want to own it

[19:27] the other thing I will always argue is for $12,500 instead of everything being just cosmetic I still think Jersey Jack should put a feature or an item or different modes and code into the game that only those collectors

[19:43] edition people get I think it would be smarter to do that and you're not making that many but it's it's you know it's just is what it is I still think people don't

[19:55] understand how to launch a collectors or truly limited version of a game the game itself should also feel limited again that's just there needs to be

[20:05] features that are different there's a reason why in every other industry I follow where there's like limited versions of the thing the

[20:12] actual experience is different like in a car when they make a special variation the experience of driving that car is different than the base model and I just

[20:23] think it's silly that pinball doesn't understand that concept all right all right you guys track in episode 247 should we go back to Christopher

[20:31] Franci and ask how many times he's going to be another pinball podcast now we'll leave him alone all right what's going on oh yeah so here's what I want to talk

[20:37] about I want to talk about this post that's in the big Lebowski club thread which should just be closed because the big Lebowski club is all

[20:46] but dead the club will not grow but I want to read what this person wrote because I have some commentary on it I want to just read you his

[20:55] whole post because it's from Pinsider high death right and he writes I am no longer in early achiever and he writes in all caps like he's really proud

[21:06] and he says about eight months ago last fall I gave Dutch pinball and ultimate him here on Pinside with a deadline of January 2018 I let it ride when January came around and Dutch pinball let us to believe production was beginning with Zitek

[21:22] the announcement of the aria lawsuit in May was a last straw for me especially when I asked for a refund and I was told there was nothing I could do

[21:31] but wait even longer and hope for a good outcome a couple of days after my ultimate post last fall a certain podcaster he's referring to

[21:41] canada decided to chime in and provide his unsolicited opinions and observations on my post he stated the following on his pinball podcast and he

[21:51] list out what I said on the show I said you are not in a position to demand anything when you invest in a company their issues become your issues you invested in a startup their pitfalls became your pitfalls their headaches are your headaches their mishaps are your mishaps there is nothing you can do you can't go after coin taker all right he then goes on the same as email the irony here is that a few days later this same

[22:21] podcaster posted a now deleted rant episode where he threatened to leave the hobby and stop podcasting over similar issues and frustration he was having with his magic girl he got on his high horse and preached to me about what I could not do or demand

[22:39] yet he did the same exact thing a couple of days later of course he deleted the rant episode and apologized to coin taker in a follow up episode but not once did he ever acknowledge his hypocrisy or follow up on the contradictory statements made an episode number 169 I'm here to say that this podcaster should steer clear from giving any one legal advice and stick to add campaigns with music artists from the eight

[23:09] days I do want to address some of his comments all right I don't know if I should stop there now let's read the whole thing all right he then writes number one I never

[23:20] invested in a startup I invested in a product I coincidentally perceived another separate refund today from a crowd

[23:29] funny company in that instance I paid $300 at plus $20 shipping for a product that I never received the company left

[23:36] $10,000 people out to dry all right no matter if it's $1 or $10,000 a company's pitfalls issues or headaches are not the customer's problem all right let me let me do each of these one by one let me let me let me deconstruct high

[23:52] deaf here because he has a long tire and I want to first of all I want to say something if you're really comparing what I went through with coin taker to what you went

[24:04] through with Dutch pinball I think you've got a few screws loose so you're basically saying that when I gave Chris money for the magic

[24:14] girl prototype and then I changed my mind and wanted my money back he still had the item all right it wasn't like a non

[24:24] refundable deal right all right and also the reality of like by then I think everyone came to the realization that

[24:33] magic girl would never work and magic girl was going to be broken forever I was not going to lose $10,000 on get an

[24:42] absolutely get nothing right for it now should I have gone on the air and did what I did no I should have called

[24:50] Melissa and I did and we worked things out and we're still friends today and we we came up with a solution right he got

[24:55] some I got some you know I lost some he lost this you know potential sale but we moved on you you you

[25:04] saying that you're refund with Dutch pinball is the same exact thing that you know you you are in no

[25:12] position to demand anything back from you look here's a difference you are in a position to demand your

[25:18] refund from Dutch pinball right because you didn't get your product okay okay the difference is this the

[25:23] difference is this you there's nothing you could do about it there's nothing you can do about it you

[25:29] know Dutch barriany are not people that seemed to me like they actually care and want to work stuff out

[25:37] they they don't Chris and Melissa you know and me we work stuff out because we wanted to come up with a

[25:44] win win and but at first it wasn't that way you know and look you can do what you want to do to try and

[25:50] get your money back from any organization that took your money and then didn't give you something but I

[25:54] think me putting a deposit down on an already built broken magic girl prototype is much different than

[26:01] you paying for a big Lebowski machine that you didn't get yet all right okay now look when you invest in

[26:10] a company that's brand new like highway pinball like Dutch pinball like any pinball company you are

[26:17] investing in the company here's why because unless the product is real and in box and on a shelf or

[26:26] at a distributor's warehouse you didn't buy shit you handed barriany op money right when I bought

[26:35] magic girl from Chris from coin taker it was in a box it was in his warehouse I was buying a product

[26:40] I didn't want the product he still has the product he can go sell the product when you gave barriany

[26:46] op $8500 what do you think your money went right there wasn't a game on a shelf that was like this is

[26:51] high depths game all right well now we can sell the game to someone else if he doesn't want it so here's

[26:55] your money back because I already got more people that want it you invested in them your money went to

[27:01] to to to to to ramping up their manufacturing your money went to their airplane tickets back and

[27:08] for up to the state your money went to probably everything but but your game and that's why Dutch pinball

[27:15] has collapsed because people's money was an investment in the company it didn't go to a product it

[27:23] was supposed to don't get me wrong like you're not wrong like you thought you were buying a product but

[27:28] in actuality you were investing in the company's ability to make the product which is different right he

[27:33] then goes on to say number two I was in the position to demand a refund and there was something I could

[27:40] do about it which I successfully did now I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about that point a little bit later on

[27:45] number three he says I could make several other counterpoints but it's pointless after all this is the

[27:52] same guy who got kicked out of a pinball tournament that's like getting expelled from romper room or

[27:58] victed from Sesame Street he never retracted the statements he made in that episode which is why I am

[28:05] finally addressing it here the tantrum he threw a few days later for the exact same thing was hypocritical and

[28:11] I wish he would acknowledge it well I have acknowledged it high def I'm reading your your email here let me ask you

[28:17] something let me ask you something we both had money on the line for a game we both were upset for a game right but

[28:26] I want to read the the remainder of your email because I think deep down inside what you're trying to do here just

[28:32] you know character assassinate me that's fine but you then are doing something in your own email that

[28:39] really does paint you as a selfish person and I'm gonna read the rest of your email and then I'm

[28:45] gonna point out why so he then writes I won't go into details on how I got a refund it wasn't voluntary but

[28:55] I accomplished it without directly contacting universal Dutch pinball could have saved money had they just

[29:02] refunded my money when I initially asked for it but they gave me no other option other than to trust

[29:07] them there's definitely a reason why that engineering sample was auctioned off a few weeks ago all right I

[29:13] want to stop right there this is my main point you came into the Dutch pinball club and you basically are

[29:21] boasting beating your chest I am no longer an early achiever I got my refund from Dutch pinball and then

[29:28] you don't tell people how you won't reveal the details on how you got your refund do you not see

[29:36] high death how that is like a jerk move like why are you doing that like why are you starting this

[29:44] thread just basically calling me a hypocrite and then acting like you're some good guy within the

[29:50] community and then you refuse to give people the one bit of information that could help every single

[29:56] early achiever who right now is getting screwed over by burying the op and you claim to know how to get

[30:02] money back from them and then you're not telling anybody that what just can we can we have a Christopher

[30:09] fransche moment of silence for that kind of selfish behavior all right we're back and that's that's my

[30:18] point it's like these people are unbelievable you you know if I knew how to get you your money back

[30:27] if Chris me canada if I knew information that could help you out don't I would tell you immediately I

[30:35] do nothing but try to help people on this show get their money back or keep their money from going

[30:43] into bad pinball ventures this show is built around that approach and I don't think anyone out there

[30:50] can say that I'm not trying to look out for people and their money but I also do understand the

[30:55] pain and the agony and the levels at which we'll go to get our money back when we feel like we're

[31:01] either going to get robbed or not going to get what we think we're paying for all right all right he

[31:07] then goes on to say he's crushed about the game I love that he signs off his email best of luck to

[32:51] Collins said welcome back hey Chris so glad you are back to the podcast it was painful listening

[32:58] to some of the podcast out there in your absence but glad you got a break and are back reinvigorated

[33:06] you've picked my interests with the last 10 minutes of the most recent podcast if you can share

[33:12] any other details with me please do on a side note you should go out and play a hobbit with the

[33:19] new code I picked up a hobbit about six months ago and I've really enjoyed it the new code just

[33:24] adds a whole new level of polish I didn't even know it needed it is very much worth a second look

[33:31] you hit the nail on the head at this moment for the price there really isn't a better bang for

[33:36] the buck on the market the immersion build quality overall package commitment to customer service is

[33:41] off the charts I'll be listening keep up the good work take care Jim Collins Jim thank you I'm

[33:46] glad to be back it is because of listeners like you that I am back I am feeling reinvigorated I

[33:52] wish there was more news to talk about though I am I am saying man there is not a lot going on in

[33:57] the summer of pinball 2018 I am not sharing any more details on the mystery game I will if you're

[34:05] interested in it I you know I'll keep an email list of people who are interested and when

[34:11] when the creator is ready to share more of his creation I will let him know who's interested like I

[34:17] think if the reason why is this is it's it's I don't know when it's going to happen you know and I

[34:25] have to be honest like in the pinball world stuff could never happen but I know stuff is happening

[34:32] um and I know it's really exciting to me and I know you'll be really excited when you see stuff

[34:38] and I've seen some stuff I just can't share stuff and and that's just the way it is so I

[34:44] I I I will happily connect people to more of this thing when we're ready to talk about it but it's

[34:50] it might be a little you know a few months all right I got an email from Leo Nard Tim sorry his

[34:58] name is backwards Tim Leonard he says hi Chris um welcome back just finished listening to your

[35:04] latest podcast I'm interested in more info on the mystery game and being included on your

[35:09] list of potential buyers also FYI I was the guy tuna delight that posted canate is back on

[35:15] pinside and my post was quickly deleted by a mod I also received a seven day threat eject

[35:22] imagine that this guy post Tim posted that I am just back canate is back in the definitive

[35:29] pinball podcast threat and get to seven day threat eject I started a moderator thread and let them

[35:34] know that I think their policy is ridiculous um regarding you it's silly but no response from

[35:41] pinside oh well I am enjoying your podcast as always thanks Tim Leonard Tim thank you so much

[35:47] the pincast moderators are the silliest group of people on planet earth they really are they

[35:51] can't get their shit together they should just let tiger law be the only moderator he's like the

[35:56] only one you know who the real issues like force flow and that blonde tail whatever they

[36:00] they ruin the entire site for me when it comes to moderation Dave standards wrote um mystery pinball

[36:06] machine well this has got me curious the mystery pinball person would it be Dave Eisner would it

[36:12] wouldn't he said wouldn't it be Dave Eisner would it um it is not David Eisner Dave but thank you for

[36:18] writing in it's always good to hear from you um is the new machine lost in space I got an email from

[36:23] he's uh from he writes could I have possibly already played it I give the following reasons I was

[36:29] pretty impressed with the finish that I saw on the home brew machine at fantastic um he mentioned he

[36:36] owns a Batman 66 um which probably means he knows of you he might not be because he was already

[36:43] at a show um it did have a hell of a cool topper it is not lost in space I will confirm that for you

[36:51] guys uh mystery pinball machine I got an email from bill sorrow um bill says hi Chris just listen to

[36:57] the latest podcast welcome back big fan of the podcast I'm not sure if the mystery pinball machine is

[37:02] real or an experiment to see how many high-end collectors would truly be in on something truly

[37:07] limited anyways I'd definitely be interested in a true LA pinball machine with unique artwork and

[37:12] mech so here's the thing though it is real like I'm not doing market research I know people will

[37:18] buy an inexpensive high-end limited run game I already know that Stern knows that Jersey Jack knows

[37:23] that everybody knows that um it's real also because I know it's been it's been in the works for

[37:29] a couple of years I think guys doing the hard work it this isn't like uh you know this isn't like

[37:34] day one like John Papadoug like hey it's gonna be called magic girl hey here's like zombie eddies

[37:38] talent I haven't done any of the hard work to make sure the game works and give me all your money

[37:42] now it's not gonna be like that um Joe from pinball star Joe new hard Joe thank you for writing

[37:48] it and he said hey brother keep keep me on your interest list for this new game you told me about

[37:53] during our recording of the podcast and are not talking about on the podcast I want in I see what

[37:59] you did there Joe and you are always in my friend on on these things I got an email from Edward

[38:05] Heron Edward said canada I just listened to your latest episode and we'd love to get more info on

[38:09] the collector mystery pin I would love to get an interest on the interest at list at possible

[38:14] all right so we're seeing a common thread here and the common thread is this I think the

[38:19] collector's out there and there are hundreds of them I think you guys are gonna want something

[38:24] that is just not what everyone else has and I think that the pinball collector market does not

[38:30] do that right now I don't think anything that comes out from Stern or Jersey Jack or anyone else

[38:35] truly truly gives the high end pinball collector what he wants and what by high end pinball collector

[38:41] I don't even mean like you have to spend like 20 30 thousand dollars on a big look no no what people

[38:46] really want is this they want a limited game that is an experience that only they're having that

[38:51] doesn't have a negative story attached to it that the company who's making it like and the person

[38:56] who's making it like supports them and has their back and they and they and that's it that has a good

[39:00] story behind it and it's gorgeous and it's a work of artwork and when you you walk past it it makes

[39:05] you smile that's what they want that's what they want that's what collectors really really want

[39:11] right yeah like a dream theme that you buy that like like thousands of other people have the same

[39:17] exact game is that really what a collector wants I don't think so I think it's someone who wants

[39:23] to play a machine for like a year and then get rid of it that's not a collection you know you want

[39:28] to grail that like it's not gonna leave and I think no one is satiating and scratching that

[39:32] itch and pinball right now all right I'm gonna go eat dinner I'm gonna go have a nice time with

[39:37] Brenda she was kind enough to let me do this podcast again so I have to be kind enough and take

[39:42] her out to eat something fancy or at least tasty all right everyone have a great week we'll be back

[39:49] next week we're gonna be interviewing Christopher francey no I'm just kidding have a great to

[39:52] everybody

[40:05] you
