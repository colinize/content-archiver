[00:00] Ah, Happy May 4th everybody, it's Star Wars Day and I don't know about you but every time

[00:27] I hear the theme song to Star Wars I die a little bit inside that Stern Bimball messed

[00:34] up the greatest movie franchise of all time.

[00:39] Steve Richie's Star Wars game to this day is such an abomination considering the source

[00:46] material of Star Wars and there's no looking back but here's the thing, we don't look back

[00:51] on Canada Spinball Podcast because we're at 494 club members, we need 6 more people

[00:59] to hit 500 and look, I'm just going to say it, Damian beat me to the punch, he got Fathom

[01:06] number 1 out the door, Mermaid Edition number 30 which is actually number 1, got picked

[01:12] up, we're going to talk about that, we're going to talk about our new club members real

[01:16] quick, we're going to talk about the fact that I think AP does not have the license

[01:21] to Sonic Spinball and what does that mean for American Pinball, we're going to talk

[01:25] about everything else going on in the pinball world and we're going to talk about the major

[01:29] moment that's going to happen in just a couple weeks, Toy Story and I want to talk about

[01:35] how some of you out there just don't get it, you don't understand why Toy Story is going

[01:42] to sell faster than a Canada Pinball Podcast jockstrap, ok people, let's get right to it.

[01:49] First I want to thank our new club members, welcome to the Canada Club, Mr. Jeffrey, Mr.

[01:55] Andrew, Mr. Seigour and I also want to give a shout out to club member number 400, Mr.

[02:02] Hans Milberger, Hans thank you so much for being number 400 and also a shout out to Sean

[02:09] McDermott who keeps bugging me about giving him a shout out, ok so let's do this, this

[02:14] is episode I don't know, 674 of Canada Spinball Podcast, it's the cheapest thing Ed Robertson

[02:20] pays for every month, let's talk about Sonic Spinball for a minute because this is really

[02:25] the funniest thing, so let's start out this show with talking about IP and how important

[02:31] it is for a pinball company to secure a good license and to secure their IP because that's

[02:37] the most important part, you don't want to tell the world what you're working on until

[02:43] or unless it's a done deal because what we're seeing right now is this and this is the brutal

[02:48] honesty of the pinball world and every boutique company out there needs to realize this, Stern

[02:54] Pinball doesn't want to help you, Stern Pinball doesn't want to support your efforts, Stern

[03:01] Pinball does not want to have competition, Stern Pinball wants to bury the competition,

[03:08] you think Gary Stern, if he hears that someone out there really loves the Sonic license and

[03:15] really wants to make their dream theme and they're going to go over to American Pinball,

[03:20] you think Gary Stern isn't on the phone right away to Mr. Jody Dankberg and is like go get

[03:28] that, look at what happened with Godzilla, you had Spooky Pinball go on all their podcasts

[03:33] and say how it was a dream theme and how they were pursuing the license, they basically

[03:37] let Stern know their dream theme they wanted to make and Stern Pinball was not pursuing

[03:44] the Godzilla title until Spooky Pinball was and the truth of the story is Chuck and Company

[03:50] met with the people at Toho and then Jody Dankberg went in after them and stole it

[03:55] from them, I mean he didn't steal it from them, he just took it from them because nobody has a

[04:01] more convincing sales pitch than Stern Pinball, Stern Pinball they're the professionals, they're

[04:08] the ones with the relationships, they're the ones with the money, if you're a license holder

[04:14] and Stern Pinball walks in how easy is it for them to say hey look we want to make your theme

[04:19] into a pinball machine, we have 50 years experience doing it, look at all the games we've made,

[04:25] look at all of the themes we've brought to life, we have the most talented people and we're gonna

[04:30] get your game out in a timely manner, it's also so easy for them to say look if you go with somebody

[04:36] else here's what's gonna happen, your game's gonna take forever to come out, it's not gonna be made

[04:41] as well, you're not gonna have designers on staff that can make it as good as we can and they can

[04:46] point to stuff like Big Lebowski and Alien and other examples where pretty decent themes went

[04:52] into the hands of the boutique world and they were fumbled, right so Stern Pinball nobody could be

[04:58] more convincing than Stern Pinball in a pitch to a license holder, you know Jersey Jack Pinball is

[05:03] the only other one that could really walk in there with some bravado, right because they could say

[05:09] look yes you could go with Stern which is more of the commoditized version of Pinball, you could go

[05:14] with them and make a cheaper version of Pinball or you could go with us and they could show them

[05:19] Wizard of Oz, they could show them all the games they've made, they can show them how they take a

[05:23] theme and they bring it to life in a much better way and then you've got Leonard who's a billionaire

[05:29] who knows everybody who's having dinner with Obama, the guy can get a meeting with anybody,

[05:33] that's what happens when you become a billionaire, now Gary Stern is probably worse somewhere between

[05:38] 50 and 100 million dollars, he probably is but Leonard Abbess he's got a few thousand million

[05:44] dollars and that gets you more meetings than not, okay but now let's ask the question why would

[05:50] American Pinball not secure the license to Sonic Spinball before hiring Ryan McQuade and does hiring

[05:59] Ryan McQuade without that license, how does that make any sense whatsoever and I want to talk about

[06:05] this because I know Ryan and he's a nice guy and I could hear the devil's advocates already saying

[06:11] well Chris, Keith Elwin's dream theme might have been Archer, they reskinned it into Iron Maiden

[06:17] and it became Game of the Year right, all of that stuff is true but, but are we saying that Ryan

[06:23] McQuade's design and his ability to understand Pinball is as good as Keith Elwin's, no, you know

[06:29] Keith Elwin is one of the greatest Pinball players of all time, Ryan is not, Ryan simply loves Pinball

[06:36] and he loves Sonic the Hedgehog and he put the two together and that's why Sonic Spinball has been

[06:43] such a fun project to witness for all of us right, it's really fun to get a glimpse into someone's

[06:49] dreams right, into their passions, into things that they live, eat and sleep for right and so that

[06:55] is what Sonic Spinball has been for many of us, it's been a fan homebrew project and it's been

[07:00] super fun to see what he's been creating but now if he is hired by American Pinball and he is not

[07:07] making Sonic Spinball, how does that make any sense and how did this happen right, see this is a

[07:14] mistake right, I'm just gonna say it, this is a mistake and American Pinball if they knew they

[07:20] wanted to pursue this game, the first thing they should have done is gone to Sega and make sure they

[07:27] secured the license before they hired Ryan, now the rumor I'm hearing is this, I'm hearing that

[07:32] Stern Pinball has the Sonic license and Mr. Sharp over at Stern Pinball is the one who secured the

[07:40] license, now you might be asking is this another Godzilla play where they just want to get it now

[07:46] and they can make the game down the road and the answer is yes, you gotta remember Stern secured

[07:52] the Godzilla license years before they made the game, years, it was like three or four years maybe

[07:58] more before the game even came out so now that they've secured the Sonic license that means that

[08:04] AP cannot make Sonic Spinball and so then the question is this, why then did you bring on Ryan

[08:11] McQuade, is it for his design skills, do we know he can make a game other than Sonic Spinball,

[08:17] we don't and so it's just another funny thing because here's the thing about all these pinball

[08:21] boutiques, I think they are for the most part amateur hour, I don't think they know what they're

[08:26] doing, I don't think they have a plan, I don't think they have a schedule, I don't think they have a

[08:31] vision and I've always said this, the most important thing for a pinball company to have is vision

[08:37] and the ability to execute and if there's one thing that plagues all of these boutique companies

[08:43] it's that they lack vision, they lack the ability to execute, they don't know what they're doing,

[08:49] how is it a visionary journey if you go from Hot Wheels to Legends of Vahala, what vision is that,

[08:56] there is no vision there and then you look at the back boxes on American Pinball Games and you look

[09:01] at how all of their games just don't look right, right, not just the art packages, not just the

[09:06] back box, everything about them, it's just there's no vision, there's no cohesive plan for this company

[09:12] and it looks that way, when you look at Stern Pinball the greatest thing Stern does is they

[09:17] have a vision and they have a visionary person driving the company and his name is George Gomez,

[09:23] I've always said on this show, if you don't have your George Gomez you don't have a successful

[09:28] pinball company and I mean that, you need your George Gomez and we're going to ask the question,

[09:32] who's the George Gomez over at Jersey Jack Pinball, now the truth there is their George Gomez is Pat

[09:38] Lawler and you could argue that Pat Lawler's vision for what JJP needs to do to be successful is a

[09:44] flawed vision, remember people, it's because of Pat Lawler you got stuff like Standard Edition of

[09:50] Willy Wonka, Standard Edition, it's because of Pat Lawler they're not making wide bodies anymore,

[09:56] it's because of Pat Lawler and his desire to see more JJP games out on location that more stuff

[10:02] got yanked out of the games and I would argue this, that Pat Lawler's vision for JJP was all wrong,

[10:09] the vision for JJP and their pathway to success is not being pinball machines for location,

[10:16] they need to make the greatest high-end pinball machines for collectors, that should be what drives

[10:22] Jersey Jack Pinball, the price should reflect it, the toy should reflect it, the materials you

[10:28] should reflect it, the toppers should reflect it, the code should reflect it, everything about JJP

[10:34] should be like stern on crack and that is what people are paying for and that should be the vision,

[10:40] see Pat Lawler wants to go back to the bin 90s, he wants to have his next Adams family, he wants to

[10:46] go out in the world and see his game everywhere and that's not what JJP's vision should be,

[10:53] it should be about every single collector should be buying our games and we should make a limited

[11:00] number of games and charge a lot for them, hello they should be more like Rolex and less like Timex.

[11:08] Okay so what's the vision then for American Pinball, you bring on Ryan McQuade, you've said

[11:13] you're going to make Barry O's game, you got to make a Dennis Norman game or two, you're making

[11:18] Riot Pinball's next game, it just doesn't make any sense and here's the other part about these

[11:23] boutique companies, anybody can hire a designer and do these victory laps, we've hired another

[11:29] designer right, it feels like record labels when they sign a bunch of artists but none of that

[11:34] matters, there is no victory lap there, you haven't accomplished anything until you've put out an album

[11:42] that goes platinum right and that's the thing about pinball is we celebrate moments like hey

[11:48] we signed up somebody, nobody cares, it doesn't matter if you have 18 designers on your roster,

[11:55] can any of them make a hit game, can any of them make a game that's going to sell thousands of

[12:00] units and so that's the question for American Pinball is what will we see from Dennis Nordman,

[12:05] now we know this, we got some news, Dennis Nordman's game is not going to be Sherlock Holmes,

[12:12] I heard it directly from someone working on the game, it is going to be something else, now what

[12:17] is it going to be, it's also not going to be Yukon Yeti, so his game is going to be made with

[12:23] Christopher Franci on artwork, I heard it looks spectacular and it's coming out this fall, so

[12:30] I think this game is everything for AP and I've been saying it for a while because remember

[12:35] this Dennis Nordman game with Christopher Franci on artwork, this is going to establish the vision

[12:42] and the direction of American Pinball and I'm here to tell you right now that they have an uphill

[12:47] battle to fight and the reason they have an uphill battle to fight is David Fix's vision is to come

[12:53] out with more original titles than licensed games and I'm sorry but that is really hard to do because

[13:01] when this game comes out it's going to be going out against Toy Story, it's going to go out against

[13:06] James Bond, against Venom, we know back to the future is coming, we know that the Matrix is coming,

[13:13] do you hear Zach Manny on his show talk about how this big 90s property everybody loves is coming,

[13:19] I bet it's the Matrix, it's coming, all these things will be coming and so if you put all these

[13:24] licensed themes together and then you're like you know what, what about Legends of Ahala, what about

[13:29] like Yukon Yeti, what, no, no, one good licensed theme is better than five original IP games,

[13:37] everybody knows that, Stern knows it, it's so crazy to me that Stern Pinball shows everybody

[13:43] how to do it and then they try to do it differently and I'm here to tell you the reason why because

[13:49] some of these gentlemen, they are stuck in the 1990s, the only reason people bought those original

[13:57] IP games like Roadshow and Theater of Magic, the only reason operators bought those original IP

[14:05] games from back in the 90s because they were just buying everything Balli Williams put out,

[14:10] that's why, they would buy 22,000 Adams family and then it's like I'll take what's next, I'll

[14:16] take what's next, I'll take what's next, but I just don't think a vision of original IPs is going

[14:22] to be very successful, all right, so speaking of, on May 4th, Star Wars Day, we have to announce

[14:28] that Damien over at Haggis Pinball, game number one, the first Fathom Mermaid Revisited Edition

[14:36] has left Haggis Pinball, it was picked up yesterday, it is going to somebody, I think his name is

[14:42] Andrew, it is going to someone in Australia, it is game number one, I know it says game number 30

[14:50] but that's because owners could pick their numbers, so what does this mean for Haggis Pinball,

[14:55] does this mean that production is going, does this mean we are going to see games every week go out

[15:00] the door, I don't think so and here's why, and first I just want to say this and Zach Mani,

[15:05] I know you're listening, I know you listen to the show, I think you listen to it illegally Zach,

[15:11] because I'm just going to say this, Zach, you're not a club member officially and I know you listen

[15:17] and I'm just here to tell you in front of 494 club members, why aren't you a club member,

[15:23] I know you love Canadian Pinball Podcast but I got to call Zach out here, if you listen to the

[15:27] last pinball show and it was a good show, Zach talks about the video that Haggis put out and he

[15:34] goes so soft on them, he doesn't even mention what a staged joke that video was, he doesn't even talk

[15:42] about how nothing in that video shows that this company has production ready, even Kerry Hardy

[15:49] was like struggling to just call it like he knew he was seeing it and I'm just here to tell you

[15:53] right now, production over there is like kind of comical, if your manufacturing has begun and you've

[16:01] spent a few weeks ramping up manufacturing there has to come a point right, where you are making

[16:07] more than one game at a time right, because then that's not a production line, then you are simply

[16:13] just still garage building these games, you might have five people on staff and if you are only putting

[16:19] one game in a box to go out on one day, it is then going to take you 365 days to make 365 games

[16:30] right, I can do the math, if only one game goes out a day that's how long it would take, but here's

[16:35] the scary part, only one game went out, one, so they're not even building one game a day, okay, so

[16:43] then if you look at it, so that's not even five games a week, so if you start to do the math on

[16:48] this and Damien says all of these games are going to be built by December, there's no way he's going

[16:53] to hit that goal, two things are going to happen here, can it is either going to be right or he's

[16:58] going to be wrong, the other things are going to happen here is this, Damien's either going to like

[17:02] make money or he's not, right, there's no in between when you have a company like this and the way

[17:07] I'm looking at this company right now and I know I'm being really bearish on this company, but I've

[17:12] just seen this before, I don't think these guys have manufacturing turned on like in the right way

[17:19] and I know they're hand building each one and the quality is there and everyone's blinded by the

[17:24] quality, but it is easy to make something of high quality and still go out of business because it's

[17:29] not about quality that keeps you in business, it isn't, you've got to get x amount of games out of

[17:35] week to pay your monthly bills, now look I don't know what their overhead is, I don't know what it

[17:39] costs to keep Haggis afloat every month, but I do know a year's gone by and only one game has gone

[17:46] out since they announced this game a year ago, April 23rd, okay, now speaking of going out,

[17:52] there's a lot more pinball brothers games going out the door these days, if you've been following

[17:57] the pinball brothers, there are something like 40 alien LV editions ready to go to America waiting

[18:06] to be picked up, pinball brothers is something I don't really talk about, for me it's just two things,

[18:11] it's the fact that we've seen alien pinball now for like seven years, so there's that, I'm just bored

[18:16] of it, it's seven years old, it's starting to look seven years old and the other part is this,

[18:21] there are still people out there who paid in full for their game who never got one and those people

[18:26] now can like, I don't know, they get like a 50% discount on a pinball brothers version and also

[18:31] like manufacturing for pinball brothers, it's really slow, all right what else is going on in

[18:35] the pinball world people, can you feel it, we are just two and a half weeks away I think from Toy Story,

[18:41] I think we're gonna see the Toy Story reveal May 23rd and that means come May 23rd,

[18:48] Kaneda's either gonna be doing backflips or jumping out the window, for me this title is gonna go one

[18:54] way or the other, it's either gonna live up to all of our expectations or I think it's gonna be a

[19:00] colossal disappointment, I just don't think there's a middle ground, the thing is this, we know and

[19:05] they know that Jersey Jack Pinball has been working on this game forever, right this is like five,

[19:13] six years Pat Lawler has been working on Toy Story, we all know that like some of what was gonna be

[19:18] in Toy Story became Willy Wonka, if you don't know that go listen to some of my older shows,

[19:23] they quickly had a reskin Toy Story into Wonka, but here's the part that I think is ludicrous,

[19:29] I wanna read something from one of my listeners, his name is Bond and he's very outspoken on the

[19:34] Patreon page and he writes the following, Chris, more delusional slurping of JJP, G&R and Toy Story

[19:41] are not big licenses in terms of pinball, let's stop right there, he thinks that Toy Story and

[19:48] Guns N' Roses are not big licenses in pinball, okay well Bond, Guns N' Roses sold 5000 games in

[19:56] one year and I'm just gonna say it, for people who think Toy Story is for kids and no one's gonna

[20:01] buy it, people they sold 6000 Wizard of Oz machines, name me a grown man on planet earth and I mean this,

[20:10] name me a grown man on planet earth that wakes up and has a social conversation with other grown men

[20:17] about the movie Wizard of Oz, Wizard of Oz would arguably on paper be one of the worst

[20:24] themes ever you could select for pinball and Jersey Jack came out with the machine, it was an

[20:29] amazing world under glass, it was a magical light show in a box and they sold thousands of them and

[20:37] Toy Story is a better theme for the pinball demographic because if you think about the pinball

[20:42] demographic, men 40 to 60, Toy Story came out in 1995, that's way better than Wizard of Oz, they

[20:49] came out what like in the 30s or 40s, this thing is going to sell so well, you are going to see

[20:57] Toy Story Collectors Editions sold out before the day is over, they are going to sell everyone,

[21:04] they can't as Todd Tucky said, they can't offer up enough Collectors Editions of Toy Story, I think

[21:11] they are going to offer a thousand, I think there is going to be a Buzz and Woody edition, I think

[21:15] they are going to be $16,000 each and they are going to be sold out and people are going to be

[21:20] spending $22,000 to get them a day later and that is what is going to happen and I get that you are

[21:26] going to have to wait to get your Collectors Edition, I get that Miracle Playfields are going to be in

[21:31] this game which is highly worrisome but it doesn't matter, it's Toy Story, it's Buzz Lightyear,

[21:37] it's Woody, it's the aliens in the claw machine, it's Pizza Planet, it's Two Infinity and beyond,

[21:44] Toy Story is a franchise and a movie with iconic characters, with fun personality,

[21:51] with jokes, with one liners you remember, everything about Toy Story is perfect for Pimball,

[21:58] Pimball is about having fun right, so as a human being on planet earth, how could you possibly

[22:04] watch a Toy Story movie and not enjoy it? How could you watch those characters and not have fun?

[22:10] If you are someone who doesn't enjoy those movies, I really do believe you are somewhat dead inside

[22:15] and Pimball is a toy and it's called Toy Story and I don't know what other way to convince you how

[22:21] well this thing is going to sell because you are just going to see Canada sitting back with my feet

[22:25] up smoking a cigar as I get my Collectors Edition, as my friends get their Collectors Edition and

[22:31] then you are going to be like I should listen to Canada, how many of you listened to Canada on

[22:35] GNRCE and got one and every single person that listened to me and grabbed one right away, what

[22:42] did I do for you? I gave you overnight and I mean this overnight I handed you $8,000 because

[22:49] overnight your $12,500 guns and roses became worth 20 grand overnight, just like that. Now the same

[22:54] thing is going to happen here, it doesn't matter what the price is, it doesn't matter, these rich

[22:58] guys in a global economy are not going to care, they are going to want one and there are so many

[23:03] people in Australia and Europe and all over the world that love Toy Story even if you don't love

[23:09] it from your momma's basement while you are on pin side being angry every night. I know who you are,

[23:14] I know who you are anti Toy Story person, you are in your momma's basement, you are on pin side

[23:19] and everything offends you and you get thumbs down all week long and I am just telling you there is

[23:23] a better life, just sign off of pin side, go watch Toy Story 1 through 4 and have a good time.

[23:31] Everybody just to put a bow on this episode, Stern Pimbalt wants to clobber the competition,

[23:36] if you have a Pimbalt Boutique company you need to secure good licenses if you want to sell more

[23:42] than like a few hundred games, you just do. And Stern will never make the mistake of Rick and

[23:47] Morty again, they made that mistake, do you think Stern doesn't realize what a mistake they made with

[23:52] Rick and Morty, that they let Rick and Morty be made by Spooky Pimbal and they slept on that and

[23:58] they are never going to sleep on it again and I think Stern Pimbal is going to come out with some

[24:03] incredible themes, I think Jersey Jack Pimbal is going to take the left over themes, it's true,

[24:08] like the only thing you can make is stuff Stern doesn't want and that's the brutal reality of

[24:13] this whole industry, if you want to make something you are only going to be able to make something

[24:18] Stern doesn't want to make and it's simply because those are licenses that are either impossible to

[24:24] get or Stern doesn't think they're big enough, they don't want to make Halloween or Ultraman,

[24:29] that's not what they're interested in. I saw someone say that like Spooky's had better themes than

[24:34] JJP, no they haven't, no they haven't, Spooky has not had better themes than Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[24:41] Jersey Jack's problem, we're going to see Godfather, here's Jack's problem when we talk about vision,

[24:47] I think Jack's problem is he's stuck in the mindset of when he was a salesperson at Stern,

[24:53] right? He keeps trying to bring out games that sold well at Stern, he sold pirates for Stern,

[24:59] so he made pirates, he saw how well Guns N' Roses sold, so he brought that out to success,

[25:04] I think the Sopranos sold really well for Stern too and that's why we're going to get Godfather,

[25:10] so we shall see what happens, it's a fun time to be in Pimbal everybody, I thank each and every

[25:15] one of you for being a member of the Canada Club, but we just need six more, I mean it,

[25:19] when we get to 500, I'm going to start to sort of trickle out the infamous or the famous or the

[25:26] sought after unicorn of Pimbal podcasting number 500, right? Episode 500 in which I interviewed
