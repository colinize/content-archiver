[00:00] The games look beautiful. Beast Edition and Oblivion, but Oblivion obviously takes it to the next level of just, oh, you make it so difficult to turn down.

[00:14] I'm hoping that you're gonna regret only doing 250 of the Beast and only 50 of the Oblivion.

[00:25] Only?

[00:27] How many fathoms have they made?

[00:34] Come on. Are we gonna just have revisionist history? Make it hard!

[00:43] How's 17,000 for a single-level game that sells for 7,000?

[00:52] Alright, you ready?

[00:56] Canade is not holding back. Here we go.

[01:00] Yeah, I'm not wearing a Haggis hat. I'm not saying it's a must-buy. Let's go.

[01:07] Oh, you know, let's just stop all the shenanigans. Let's stop the charades. Everybody hears the deal. I'm just gonna give it to you raw and uncut on this episode of Canade is Pinball Podcast.

[01:24] It's the 4th of July. It's the evening of our country's independence. It's a holiday evening and it's like 10 o'clock at night and Haggis Pinball drops.

[01:33] It's game number 3 information centaur onto the world.

[01:38] And what happens? We've got distributors saying it's a must-buy. We'll take your pre-orders tomorrow, even though the game doesn't even go up for sale until July 12th.

[01:47] And then we've got other content creators wearing Haggis hats saying it's really hard to figure out how to not buy this game.

[01:53] And then you go on the pinside marketplace. What do you see? You see centaurs trading hands for around $6,000 to $8,000.

[02:02] Now look, I get it. The game is beautiful. Haggis Pinball makes a stunning product. Fathom Revisited was stunning.

[02:09] It was a beautiful game and people wanted it and people pre-ordered it and people waited and waited and waited and they still have not made half of the fathoms.

[02:19] And this podcast is going to be about what I believe is this pinball industry's inability to actually see the force for the trees.

[02:29] Distributors who should be looking out for customers are taking orders on this game saying it's a must-have game when those very distributors haven't even fulfilled all of their fathom orders.

[02:42] So who's actually looking out for the pinball buying community? Is it your distributor friend?

[02:48] Do they have information that Haggis Pinball has ramped up their production abilities? Have we seen any indication that they've got more people building these games?

[02:57] No, they want to take a $2,000 or $3,000 non-refundable deposit on July 12th.

[03:05] Why July 12th? Why are you even revealing this game if you haven't even built half of the fathom orders after almost two years of having fathom orders with customers?

[03:20] Why is nobody seemingly even interested in asking any of these questions?

[03:27] And this is the part that's absolutely so comical to me. Have we not seen this charade before? Have we not seen this movie before?

[03:38] Am I the only one who is a lunatic in New York City who has seen this happen time and time again?

[03:46] Look, the game is beautiful. The game is gorgeous, right? I'm not going to argue on the aesthetics of this machine because fathom was beautiful.

[03:54] What I would love for us to ask is simply this. Why was the game revealed to us on the 4th of July of 2023 when nobody knows how many fathoms have you made to date?

[04:09] How many games are you making a week? When will I get my Centaur Beast Edition or Oblivion Edition if I order this game on July 12th?

[04:19] And when you give your money on July 12th, guess what people? It's non-refundable. So you don't care? You're just going to wait forever? You're going to wait for years?

[04:30] And this is my point is the fact that we've got distributors who are saying, order it now. I'll lock in your non-refundable deposit for you. Why would you even bother?

[04:40] So let's just look at the reality here. I harp on one thing all the time. Market research, market research, market research.

[04:47] Now look, if you're going to do a remake of a game, isn't the whole point of remaking a classic game is to bring it back and make it affordable to own a brand new version of the game?

[04:59] Let's just start there. So remember when Chicago Gaming Company remade games like Monster Bash and Medieval Madness and Attack from Mars?

[05:07] Remember that? Remember those good old days? So before they did that, before they brought brand new sexier versions of those classic games back into the world,

[05:16] those games, if you were to find one like professionally restored, they were going for like $12,000 and Chicago Gaming Company brought back those games for cheaper than what a high end restoration of that game would cost you.

[05:33] Okay, now times have changed, right? And I get it. The whole pinball marketplace has exploded. But if you look at the marketplace for Centaur,

[05:42] which is a game that there's a decent amount of them in the world, I think there's like 3800 were made. So they are out there. And look, I know, I know, right?

[05:51] Haggis is not even making like a tenth of how many Centaurs are out there in the world. And they are arguably making like a modern nicer version.

[06:00] So if you're a Centaur fan and you really want this game, like this is good news for you. Like you're going to get this brand new spanking and innovative new version of Centaur.

[06:10] Right. So like, good, knock yourself out. Okay, but here's the thing. They're only going to make two versions, the beast version and the Orblivian version. The beast version in US dollars is $10,000.

[06:22] They're going to make 250 of those. Okay, so that's kind of like Fathom mermaid edition, right? 250 at $10,000. That's right where Fathom was.

[06:30] Now we've got this Orblivian edition. It's got all this other stuff, color, play field, different topper. It comes with custom call outs for each buyer, right?

[06:41] They're doing a Batman super le move here where they are going to customize the game for you. They're also going to give you a motorcycle jacket and I think a helmet.

[06:51] So you can be the ultimate badass human being playing the game, but it's $17,000. It's $7,000 more than the freaking beast edition of the game.

[07:04] What is going on in pinball people? There is something rotten in the state of Denmark, as Shakespeare would say. What is happening to this hobby?

[07:14] Like how is that a $7,000 more thing to put into a game? It's the same way with Galactic Tank Force. It was like $6,500 more to get a lunchbox and a thermos and a cheap 3D translate.

[07:29] Alright, what is happening here? Have we all lost our minds? But it's clear what's happening. These companies are trying to milk the collector.

[07:38] They're trying to do what Stern does, but they're not doing it right because they don't have the ability to make the games.

[07:46] And when did we stop asking these questions? When did we give up needing to know how safe our money was if we gave them to these companies and had absolutely no idea when they're going to make the game?

[07:59] Here's the deal. I would buy a game from Haggis if the game was in a box. Why is it so hard for them to put a game in a box and then sell it to you? Why are they doing this?

[08:09] Think about it right now. There are half of the fathom buyers out there that don't have their game. What do you think they're feeling right now?

[08:17] You know, I don't even have my game yet and you've now announced the next game.

[08:22] So we've seen this happen before and I'm not even allowed to mention when it's happening because then people are like, you can't draw parallels to this company, to that company.

[08:30] Why not? They're doing the exact same thing before they finish the build on game number two. They are going to take money nonrefundable on game number three.

[08:41] So it begs the question, why do they need the money for game number three if they haven't even finished building game number two and it's going to take them at least six months or more?

[08:51] To finish building game number two. Why? Why are you going to go in on one? And look, based on the reaction from people, I think it's a divided camp.

[09:01] The majority of people are looking at this the same way I am. Like Centaur isn't really a game where a lot of people have been clamoring for it.

[09:09] Now you're charging more money than it's ever cost to get one. I get it. All they need are 50 die hard Centaur fans and they will sell those oblivion additions.

[09:19] And that's fine. I don't really care if they want to do this, but the question still remains. Imagine if you ordered one. When are you getting it? When are you getting it?

[09:30] Why is this stuff clouded in mystery? And why are distributors taking money on these games before the games are even open for sale?

[09:38] So don't forget something people. If you want to get your game, they're never going to fill a container.

[09:42] There hasn't been one single container that came over from Australia that gave people free shipping on the game. It's really easy to say stuff like this.

[09:52] And I'm so shocked with all these smart educated people in pinball that nobody calls out this BS. Like it's like I could say to you free shipping, but only if I sell an aircraft carrier full of games.

[10:04] Like it's free if that happens. Like these conditions are so manufactured. And look, you know me. I'm not a fan of this company. I'm not a fan of how they've been doing business.

[10:16] I'm not a fan of how they've been communicating with people. I don't care that they're making a sexy remake of a 1981 game.

[10:24] What I care about is this company showing us where they currently are in its manufacturing of these games. And look, I get it.

[10:33] People think I'm annoying. They think I'm just rooting against these companies. And look, nobody else. Nobody else is asking these questions.

[10:40] Instead, Kerry Hardy is putting on a haggis hat saying you're making it hard not to buy this game.

[10:46] Kerry, really? At $17,000, they made it real easy not to buy the game, bro. Did everyone make millions on Dogecoin?

[10:55] Like what has happened to the common sense in the pinball hobby? And I don't see anybody and I mean this anybody in the pinball content world looking out for the customers asking these questions.

[11:08] They simply are shilling and cheerleading for all these companies, no matter what they do. No matter what they do.

[11:14] Like nobody's asking how, where are you with Fathom? Where are you with Fathom? Maybe before I take orders on this game, I'm going to ensure I know where my Fathom customers stand.

[11:24] Nope. It's a must have game. Brilliant. Amazing. Let me use all the hyperbolic statements I can make so I can get more orders in.

[11:32] Let's just pile up the orders and then maybe our robbing Peter to pay Paul business strategy will work out.

[11:39] This is right after I did a show that says, hey, maybe you should be careful. My whole thing is this, people.

[11:44] If you want this game, buy this game after it's made. How about that? How about we start teaching these pinball companies a lesson?

[11:50] I'm not going to be your investor. I will be your customer. If haggis pinball needs cash today, go to a bank and get a loan.

[12:00] Go find investors in pinball. We've seen it happen before. Jersey Jack pinball went and found an investor.

[12:07] We know that Ametron is funding American pinball, but if you want to self-finance this, see, it's not Damien self-financing this company.

[12:15] It's all of you if you order the game now. And that's the way it works. If you give nonrefundable pre-order money to these companies, you are now an investor in haggis pinball.

[12:25] You didn't buy a game. The game's not even made. You don't even know when the game's going to be made.

[12:30] I mean, it's absolutely a name that everybody has a short memory when it comes to this kind of business practice.

[12:37] And I don't care if this upsets you. I don't care. I will always be on this side of the fence when it comes to the charade that I see from some of these pinball companies,

[12:46] the charade from what I see from some of these pinball content creators that just chill and cheerlead and applaud this stuff.

[12:54] Because trust me, ladies and gentlemen, they're not looking out for your best interests. They're all putting money in their pockets.

[13:01] And I'm going to tell you right now, the only money I get in my pocket comes from this podcast. And this is my pinball livelihood.

[13:07] So cool. I'm not making anyone join this show. I'm not forcing you to listen to Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[13:12] but I'm going to tell you right now, you're not going to hear this from anybody else. You're going to hear bye, bye, bye.

[13:18] And that's it. And I think this pinball world needs to wake up. I think people need common sense.

[13:22] And look, I get it. It's haggis. Most of you are not going to buy this game because when this game goes up for sale on July 12, guess what?

[13:29] In eight days, you're going to see the next game from Stern Pinball. Right? That's why they're doing it right now.

[13:35] That's why they're doing it right now. They need to capture money right now because if they wait, all the money is going to go to the one company

[13:41] that actually builds games. It's so funny to me. It's 2023. These days of being personal investors in these companies with these nonrefundable deposits,

[13:53] it's total BS. Why is the deposit nonrefundable? Why? If you're not going to build this game for a freaking year, then don't ask for money until the game is on the freaking line.

[14:05] And that's it, people. Happy July 5th.

[14:08] Canadian Spinball Podcast. Don't buy, buy, buy. Use some common sense. Wake up.

[14:14] I know that 99% of you are not going to move on these things. It's crazy to me how everyone is just blinded by aesthetics and nobody wants to ask any of these tough questions.

[14:24] Everybody, it's your money. Be smart. Be careful. If you want this game, I would email them and say, hey, I'll happily buy it when you build it.

[14:32] I'm not going to give you money and wait a year because if Fathom has shown us anything, if you wait, you'll be able to get one, take no risk,

[14:40] and have the game in your house before everyone else who orders the game with a pre-order. That's what happens.

[14:46] We see it every time. We're seeing it with Scooby-Doo people. It's not just Haggis people. You could cut the line with Spooky and get a Scooby-Doo for $2,000 less.

[14:54] If you want a Godfather, you could go get it for $2,000 less.

[14:59] And these, again, these things are being sold to you by people that are like, buy, buy, buy. It's $12,000.

[15:06] And then the same people are selling you the exact same machine like a couple weeks later for $1,500 or $2,000 less.

[15:15] And all of a sudden, it's no longer the greatest game. All of a sudden, they're no longer hyping it. All of a sudden, what?

[15:21] Look out for yourselves. Stop believing the hype. Stop running towards the FOMO.

[15:27] If you just wait and see, you will have way more options and save way more money.

[15:34] And that is my only message now for the rest of my pinball tenure. There's nothing else I can tell you.

[15:39] I've been in it for a decade, and this is what I've learned. If you wait and you see how it all plays out, you will be at an advantageous position.

[15:49] If you listen to the FOMO and the hype and the people that just want to put money in their pockets, you might put your money at risk.

[15:56] You might wait way longer than you want to, and then a new game might come out that you want more, and then there's nothing you can do.

[16:03] Just go take a look at the guy on pinside selling his godfather's CE. His name is Knucklehead. That's his name.

[16:11] And now he wants something else, but he committed to buying a game he's never played before.

[16:16] Wake up people. Would you buy a car you didn't test drive? This isn't like an Xbox. Games aren't 50 bucks. This is $15,000.

[16:25] Would you buy a watch that you don't put on your wrist? People, wake up. Canada out. Happy July 5th.
