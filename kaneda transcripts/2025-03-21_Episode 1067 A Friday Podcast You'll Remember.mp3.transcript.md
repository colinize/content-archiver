[00:00] I'm going back someday, come watch me through Blue Bull.

[00:07] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:12] Aw, welcome everybody, happy Friday.

[00:15] It is Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:17] The only pinball podcaster probably not at Texas Pinball Festival right now.

[00:23] The show begins today.

[00:25] And I'm curious about two things at this show.

[00:29] The two things I want to see the most from people.

[00:33] I want to get pinhead reviews of Portal and Merlin's Arcade.

[00:39] There's really nothing else at the show that's totally intriguing me.

[00:45] We know about D&D.

[00:47] We can look at the medieval madness armor.

[00:50] We're going to talk about the Blue Merlin Edition, but honestly, the two major things

[00:56] are going to be Portal and Merlin's Arcade, right?

[00:59] The biggest show.

[01:01] This used to be the biggest show and nothing else is really dropping there.

[01:06] So what will those two games play like?

[01:08] What else is happening in the pinball world?

[01:11] Well, where should we start?

[01:12] Let's talk about this Merlin Edition of CGC's medieval madness, a game that they

[01:18] could ostensibly run for an unlimited amount of years.

[01:22] And I think the demand for this game, it's going to be interesting now that

[01:26] they're bringing back 1000 units.

[01:29] We don't know how many units are going to be Merlin Editions.

[01:34] CoinTaker has sort of like the standard edition.

[01:38] I think it's called like the Arcade or Classic Edition is up for sale on the

[01:42] CoinTaker site.

[01:43] So are they going to be half Merlins?

[01:47] Are there going to be 500?

[01:48] Are there going to be 750?

[01:49] Are they going to do a spooky?

[01:51] And as many people that order Merlins, we will make and the rest will be

[01:56] standard editions.

[01:58] I know everybody is wondering what will the price be?

[02:02] A lot has changed in the pinball world since the Royal Edition came out.

[02:07] You got to remember the Royal Edition, I want to say came out in what like 2022?

[02:12] It was right before COVID.

[02:15] It was before the spike in prices and it was $10,000.

[02:20] And I remember when the Royal hit, it wasn't impossible to get.

[02:24] I had one, right?

[02:25] I had one, I ordered one and it wasn't like I need to know right now.

[02:29] And foolishly, it was one of the games I regret not buying for $10,000 and just

[02:37] keeping it in a box because at the height of COVID, these things were going for

[02:42] 20 grand and they've been going consistently for $16,000 to $18,000

[02:48] easily over the last three years.

[02:51] And I don't know how many there are like, what is it like 200, 250 Royal

[02:55] editions and now that the game is coming back again with all the bells and whistles

[03:02] and the topper again with the big display and we've got the Merlin Edition.

[03:07] That is obviously going to chip away at the value of the Royal Edition.

[03:14] You know what?

[03:14] I don't see people being upset.

[03:16] You know what?

[03:17] I don't see an uproar around.

[03:19] They're making another limited edition of a game that already had a limited

[03:23] edition game.

[03:24] I just don't like this practice in general.

[03:28] If you bought a Royal Edition, you kind of thought you were getting the last

[03:33] Ellie of the game.

[03:35] It felt like a final sort of build of the game.

[03:39] And you know, if you bought one, you want your game to be the last

[03:44] edition, you want your game to hold its value at $16,000 to $18,000 and they

[03:50] are ostensibly and they are once again doing what is the modern trend in

[03:54] Pimbal, screw over the people that thought they were getting a limited

[04:00] limited edition version of a game.

[04:02] And I still believe this to this day.

[04:04] If you're making an Ellie or a C of a game, you should only make that run

[04:11] once.

[04:12] You should not make another Ellie or C of the game at a later date.

[04:17] You are burning your buyer base and your collector base.

[04:21] There's no if ands or buts about it.

[04:25] I don't like it, but here we are.

[04:28] If you had a Royal and you bought it to speculate on, you should have sold

[04:33] it because now I think all these games are going to go down in price.

[04:36] So what will the price of the Merlin Edition be?

[04:39] It's been a while, right?

[04:41] Games have gone through the roof.

[04:42] The cost of making games has gone up.

[04:45] This game gives you everything in a world in which $2,000 toppers have a

[04:49] lot less in them than this topper.

[04:52] What will the price be?

[04:53] I believe the price of the Royal was right at $10,000.

[04:57] I don't think this Merlin Edition, when they announced the price today,

[05:02] I don't think it's going to be that much more money than what it was years

[05:07] ago.

[05:08] I could see a little bit of a price increase.

[05:11] And if I were to guess what they're going to ask for this game, I would say

[05:16] 11,5 no more.

[05:19] I expected to come in underneath that, but I don't expect them to ask for

[05:25] anything more than 11,5 and knowing that there's a thousand of them, it is

[05:30] going to be a real test of the market.

[05:32] Will the market absorb a lot more medieval madness is on top of

[05:38] portal Merlin's arcade.

[05:40] The fact that there's two Merlin games coming out right now, my poor friend

[05:43] who's listening to this is working on his version of Merlin.

[05:46] There's going to be three Merlin games in the zeitgeist, but at least he's

[05:50] going to have a lot of time before you see his Merlin.

[05:53] If we're up to me, I would wait for the last installment of Merlin because

[05:57] I think it's going to be pretty epic.

[05:59] You know, so you got more medieval madnesses in a world of all these other

[06:03] games, Potter's about to come out, King Kong, Predator, Dune, all these titles

[06:08] about to hit, Pokemon's coming out.

[06:11] I just talked to Barry over at Dutch Pinball and yes, I can confirm for you

[06:17] they are making back to the future at Dutch Pinball.

[06:21] He is really excited about the game and he really wants to show the other

[06:27] pinball manufacturers how it's done.

[06:31] So that game is coming out at the end of the year.

[06:34] So you got to think, do I want to be locking in all this money right now or

[06:38] can I wait eight months and get Pokemon and back to the future?

[06:42] You know how we are.

[06:43] The moment this like barrage of games hits, we're not going to be satiated.

[06:49] We're going to be like, what's next?

[06:50] What's next at Stern?

[06:51] What's next at spooky?

[06:52] What's next at JJP?

[06:53] It's just the way we're wired in this industry.

[06:56] The best game is always the game that's not out yet.

[06:59] So we'll see what they priced it at.

[07:01] We're going to learn it today.

[07:02] Okay, as far as which edition I like better, I still think the Black Royal

[07:08] looks so much better than this Merlin edition and I know what's happening.

[07:12] A lot of people out there that don't want to spend the money on the Royal

[07:17] edition are trying to justify that the Merlin looks just as good.

[07:22] If not better.

[07:24] I'm here to tell you people know it doesn't.

[07:26] There's nothing sexier than glossy black on top of glossy black.

[07:33] And when you look at the medieval cabinet and you look at the artwork,

[07:37] the glossy sparkle black looks so much nicer than the blue.

[07:42] The blue interrupts.

[07:44] It interrupts the black of the art package.

[07:47] I get what they're going for, but it just doesn't work as well.

[07:52] Armor shouldn't be the focus.

[07:55] Armor should complement the art package in a more subtle way.

[07:59] And the best art packages do that.

[08:02] Now that doesn't mean your armor can't be bright and colorful,

[08:05] but the artwork around it needs to be bright and colorful for it to work.

[08:10] But overall, the sexier, more beautiful looking pins in my honest opinion,

[08:18] don't have too much of a jarring armor pop to them like Batman SLE,

[08:24] Guns N' Roses CE, Wizard of Oz with that beautiful green.

[08:28] You know, I like that way more than the Yellow Brick Road edition.

[08:32] And yes, it is subjective, but when you put a picture of black and blue versus

[08:38] black on top of sexy black, the royals look better.

[08:43] Will that make those worth more?

[08:45] I don't think so.

[08:46] It's still a great game in any of these new trims.

[08:51] They all look so much better than the original LEs that had that ugly WWE

[08:57] like mustard colored armor.

[08:58] Those were hideous.

[09:00] All right.

[09:00] So we got medieval madness, Merlin edition.

[09:03] We will see what the price is.

[09:05] We will see how the market responds to it.

[09:08] Speaking of new things to the market, have you seen this new topper for pulp

[09:14] fiction from the gang over at the electric playground?

[09:18] Now, I think the electric playground are the guys that made that big Godzilla

[09:22] topper.

[09:23] I think they made that big topper for the big Lebowski.

[09:26] And so they've got this topper.

[09:28] It's called the Double Tap Edition Pulp Fiction topper.

[09:32] And it's interesting because they launched a video of it in which you see

[09:37] the two main characters.

[09:39] You see Samuel Jackson's character and John Travolta's character and they're

[09:43] pointing their guns and the guns are really big and they're firing pinballs out

[09:50] that go across a wire form into the other guns barrel.

[09:55] It just made me wonder what's happening here.

[09:57] Why would a gun fire a bullet into another gun?

[10:02] But I guess that's the double tap action that's happening.

[10:06] There's also a speaker on the side of it that makes the sound of a gun being fired.

[10:12] And then there's all these palm trees.

[10:13] That was the first thing I thought when I saw this when I think of pulp fiction.

[10:18] The last thing I think about are palm trees and there's like one, two, three,

[10:24] four, five palm trees on this topper.

[10:28] But that's not the thing that grabbed everybody's attention.

[10:31] The thing everyone's talking about is when you look at the characters on the topper,

[10:37] their faces are blurred out.

[10:40] They're blurred out on the image.

[10:43] They're blurred out on the video.

[10:45] But are they in real life?

[10:48] Are they blurry?

[10:50] And the reason why they're blurred out is that this company, Electric Playground,

[10:55] does not have a license with the studio to show the actual likeness of Samuel L.

[11:04] Jackson and John Travolta.

[11:05] So if they release this topper with those people's faces on it,

[11:11] they are committing IP infringement.

[11:14] And there's a reason why Chicago Gaming Company and Play Mechanics spends a lot of

[11:19] money to license the theme so that they have sole exclusivity to sell the products.

[11:26] Also, the license holder doesn't want just anybody profiting off of their IP.

[11:32] And I know this is a gray area.

[11:34] I know everyone's like, you're a hypocrite.

[11:37] You use the image from Akira.

[11:40] And let me tell you right now, Katashira Otomo, who runs Akira, has gone on the record that

[11:45] he enjoys seeing people take his artistic creation and using it for stuff.

[11:52] Okay.

[11:52] So there's that.

[11:53] Also, I am not selling you anymore any of that IP for profit.

[12:00] Okay.

[12:00] I don't sell you merchandise with the Akira image on it or Canada's face on it.

[12:04] Nothing.

[12:05] And I don't use that to sell this podcast and I'm allowed to call my podcast,

[12:10] Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[12:11] It's just a Japanese name.

[12:13] All right.

[12:13] So, but these guys, they want to sell 300 of these at 1500 a pop.

[12:19] That was the other big thing.

[12:20] 1500 a pop.

[12:22] That's $450,000 in potential revenue if they sell all 300.

[12:28] But I think the overall consensus, regardless if the faces are blurry, we're going to get

[12:33] an answer on that at TPF.

[12:35] I want someone who's at TPF to take a picture of this topper and settle this debate once

[12:42] and for all because we still don't know.

[12:44] My guess is that they've manipulated the video and the image to try to skate around

[12:51] the letter of the law.

[12:53] And I think they're going to get caught and called out on it.

[12:57] But here's the real truth, regardless of whether or not they're stealing IP, doesn't

[13:01] matter.

[13:02] Why would anybody order a $1,500 topper for Pulp Fiction SE?

[13:10] Because nobody who owns an LE is ever going to buy this topper because they have already

[13:15] got an amazing topper on top of the game.

[13:18] And why would anybody spend an additional 1500?

[13:21] You would have just bought an LE.

[13:24] If you buy this and put it on top of your SE, that's the same amount of money that it

[13:29] would have cost you to just get an LE.

[13:32] And guess what?

[13:33] You can go get LEs today for sticker price.

[13:37] Like the LEs on Pulp Fiction have not gone up in price.

[13:40] In fact, they've gone down a few hundred dollars.

[13:43] So why?

[13:44] Right?

[13:45] Why?

[13:45] I mean, again, I just think we're moving past this sort of period where people are going

[13:51] to throw these super expensive toppers on top of games.

[13:54] And in the end, it doesn't matter, right?

[13:56] I really don't care if you want to go buy this, knock yourself out.

[14:00] If these guys want to commit IP infringement and make all this money stealing IP, I don't

[14:06] care.

[14:06] Go knock yourself out.

[14:08] It doesn't matter, but it's interesting to talk about.

[14:11] And it's an interesting debate on whether or not this should be a practice that we

[14:16] endorse in pinball.

[14:18] It's like the guys that are selling all of those banners illegally.

[14:21] There are people out there selling banners illegally.

[14:24] They're selling mods that have illegal IP on them.

[14:28] And George Gomez always says to me, he's like, Chris, it's just whack-a-mole.

[14:32] Like, yeah, we could try to go after all these people, but it's whack-a-mole.

[14:35] You shut one down and 10 more pop up.

[14:38] And I get it.

[14:38] I get it.

[14:39] And it's such a small hobby.

[14:41] It's like nobody's getting super wealthy on any of this stuff.

[14:44] All right.

[14:45] So we've got that.

[14:46] I'm curious to see how that sells.

[14:48] Only going to make 300.

[14:49] They're not going to sell 300 of that top, or it's just not going to happen.

[14:52] All right.

[14:52] So what else is going on in pinball?

[14:54] We finally got a teaser from barrels of fun.

[14:58] Guess who they're listening to?

[15:00] Canade is pinball podcast.

[15:01] I've been telling David Vaness, you got to get some conversation going.

[15:05] You got to let people know.

[15:07] Don't get forgotten in this sort of crowded period in the pinball marketplace.

[15:11] And so yesterday, they uploaded a photo of David and three of his barrel

[15:18] coworkers standing over a playfield that has been turned upside down.

[15:24] And when you zoom in on this playfield, it looks like a mech for a three drop

[15:29] bank target area.

[15:32] So there's that.

[15:33] There's a bunch of other coils.

[15:35] Not everything is wired yet.

[15:37] There's no subway yet.

[15:38] There's a little bit of an insert area that people think is one of the family

[15:42] crests from Dune.

[15:44] I posted that.

[15:45] Oh, yeah.

[15:46] This is confirmation that it's Dune.

[15:48] There are playfields in the background of this image.

[15:52] Those are labyrinth playfields.

[15:54] They are not the playfields for the new game.

[15:57] David has a big smile on his face.

[15:59] And look, David, I hope we're all smiling as big as you are.

[16:04] When we see your new game and hopefully it comes out sometime soon.

[16:09] And as I said, I think they're going to be last.

[16:12] I think they're going to wait for everything else to drop.

[16:14] I think a lot of us are just going to wait for everything to drop.

[16:17] Really?

[16:17] Do you really think it's going to be hard to get a King Kong le?

[16:20] I mean, I know they're going to sell quickly, but you really think like two

[16:24] months from now, a stern makes a thousand King Kong le's.

[16:28] They're going to be hard to get.

[16:29] I don't know.

[16:30] I think Harry Potter is going to be the big winner.

[16:33] Just on theme alone.

[16:34] I think that's going to be the big winner.

[16:36] Here we are.

[16:37] Tpf.

[16:37] I think we're going to get a lot of feedback on Evil Dead on games like D&D on

[16:42] games like Portal on games like Merlin's arcade.

[16:46] How will they do?

[16:48] We shall see.

[16:49] Never a dull moment in pinball.

[16:50] Everybody happy Friday morning.

[16:52] I might even do another show later today, depending if any surprises happen at

[16:56] Tpf.

[16:57] That's what I'm wondering.

[16:58] Are there going to be any surprises or used to be surprises at big shows

[17:02] like these?

[17:03] Is someone going to walk in that nobody expects and Paul the curtain off a

[17:07] game?

[17:08] Predator.

[17:09] Is it ready?

[17:10] Is someone going to release a teaser to become the talk of the show?

[17:14] Think about that for a minute.

[17:15] You don't even have to go to the show to own the conversation of the show.

[17:20] If I was someone like David Vaness, if I was someone like the pinball brothers,

[17:26] I would be doing stuff like that right now.

[17:29] If I had Predator and I knew that these games are coming out in front of

[17:34] mine and I had the most badass theme like Predator, I would be making fun of

[17:39] all these new games in a Predator speak.

[17:41] You know, why don't you buy these new releases?

[17:43] They're all coming out right now because some damn fool accused our game of

[17:47] being the best.

[17:49] Just have some swagger, have some confidence in what you're about to release

[17:54] and poke some fun at the rest of the industry.

[17:58] We're all grown men.

[17:59] I've noticed this lately.

[18:01] I get a lot of people that get upset with me lately.

[18:03] They're like, I'm not going to give you this because you're just going to make

[18:05] fun of it.

[18:07] You're just going to say something negative and gang.

[18:10] I think there's a big difference between negativity, toxicity and sarcasm and

[18:16] taking the piss out of the fact that all of us are spending this much money on

[18:21] these things.

[18:22] The rest of the world is suffering.

[18:24] The rest of the world can barely pay rent or put food on the table and we're

[18:28] not allowed to make fun of a pinball topper company that's stealing IP.

[18:33] We're not allowed to make fun of pin side users that post 40,000 times on pin

[18:38] side and they don't even show up to their own local shows.

[18:42] We're not allowed to poke fun at the biggest keyboard commandos out there.

[18:46] We're not allowed to poke fun at Canada who has a minor meltdown or a major

[18:50] meltdown because he loses a five dollar trophy.

[18:53] That means nothing.

[18:54] You guys all made fun of me.

[18:55] I didn't care.

[18:56] I thought it was funny.

[18:57] Was I bullied?

[18:58] Am I going to cry about you making fun of me?

[19:00] No.

[19:01] It's just funny to me.

[19:02] The modern world, modern world.

[19:04] There's no bro code anymore.

[19:06] Like you can't just be a bro that's just talking smack anymore.

[19:10] Like, oh, you're bullying people.

[19:12] Say nice stuff.

[19:13] When did everybody turn into thumper on this planet?

[19:16] And again, let's just have some fun.

[19:17] Who cares?

[19:18] Life is so damn short.

[19:20] You know what thing I've been thinking about lately?

[19:22] It kind of level sets all the ridiculousness of all this.

[19:25] Like, oh, yeah, the pinball market is collapsing.

[19:27] Oh, yeah, these prices.

[19:28] Nobody cares.

[19:30] Nobody cares.

[19:31] It's just small market.

[19:33] If you only have to sell a thousand of one item or a thousand of one item

[19:40] across the globe to a bunch of rich guys, and if you can't do that, then

[19:45] what you made is crap.

[19:47] Let's be honest.

[19:48] If you can't sell 1000 of a $10,000 product that appeals to 40 to 60 year

[19:55] old geek men who should have money in the world, then they do.

[19:58] If you can't sell a thousand of them, what you've made is crap.

[20:02] And I mean that.

[20:03] I mean that.

[20:04] And you can't say that.

[20:05] Oh, that's not being nice.

[20:06] You're not supposed to be like, I don't care anymore.

[20:08] Like, I don't care.

[20:09] Make something good people want.

[20:11] Right.

[20:11] Don't waste everybody's time.

[20:13] Don't waste your time.

[20:14] Don't drive your wives and your families down a damn journey so you

[20:18] can have some pinball fame and then release some crappy game.

[20:22] And if you release a crappy game, I'm allowed to call it a crappy game.

[20:26] The same way I'm allowed to call it a masterpiece because if I call

[20:30] everything that's crappy, okay, I have fun.

[20:32] You know, it was okay.

[20:33] I had fun.

[20:33] I mean, I saw people jump on road trip and come on guys.

[20:38] They're not going to sell 50 of those things, but they don't want to

[20:41] say that.

[20:42] I don't want to hurt the feelings of the man who made the game.

[20:45] Well, if you don't want me to hurt your feelings, if you're the

[20:47] man who made the game, then maybe make something that more than 50

[20:51] people in the world want.

[20:53] I made a podcast more than 50 people want it.

[20:55] This pinball podcast over 600 over 600 people, right?

[20:59] It used to be over 700 over 600 people.

[21:01] I don't know.

[21:02] I feel like it's more fun.

[21:03] We can have actually like dialogue and discourse, but you got to be nice.

[21:07] You got to be nice.

[21:08] You got to be positive.

[21:09] You got to be nice.

[21:10] Let me tell you what nice doesn't get you.

[21:12] It doesn't get you to the choppa.

[21:14] It doesn't get you to kill the predator.

[21:17] I ain't got time to bleed.

[21:18] We all need to have a little bit more thick skin.

[21:21] It's a lot of money people.

[21:23] A lot of games coming out.

[21:24] They cost a lot of money.

[21:26] A lot of you work really hard for that money.

[21:28] It's not cheap, right?

[21:29] Three pinball machines at the top trim $45,000.

[21:34] So you have to make $90,000 before taxes to buy three pinball

[21:39] machines a year at the top trim level.

[21:43] What's the average median salary in America?

[21:45] What's the average median salary in the world?

[21:48] So if you're going to go down that journey and you're going to get a

[21:52] team of people together and you're going to screw together a pinball

[21:54] machine and you need to sell a thousand of them and you need to sell a

[21:58] hundred of them or 500 of them.

[21:59] I don't care what it is.

[22:00] Make it work.

[22:01] Come with a good idea.

[22:04] A hard no is better than a soft maybe.

[22:05] There's too many pinball machines that came out in the world recently.

[22:09] You know who they are.

[22:10] Barbecue challenge.

[22:12] There's too many machines that came out galactic tank force.

[22:15] Too many machines that came out that should have been killed in the

[22:20] boardroom when the idea was to make that game.

[22:23] Toy Story 4 should have been killed.

[22:25] They should have killed the Godfather.

[22:27] These games should have been killed.

[22:28] John Wick, Venom, these games never should have been made with all things

[22:32] considered because Stern needs to sell not like a thousand.

[22:36] Stern needs to sell three to five thousand and if we need to sell five

[22:40] thousand, it's not going to be John Wick.

[22:42] It's got to be Pokemon.

[22:43] And if we make games like Star Wars and we charge this much for Star

[22:48] Wars, we can't then charge this much for Venom.

[22:51] Hello everybody.

[22:52] Stern's waking up.

[22:54] Why is the Mandalorian topper $700 more than the same exact topper

[23:01] that's on Venom?

[23:02] It's the same materials.

[23:04] It's the same layout.

[23:06] It's the same design.

[23:07] You know what I'm saying?

[23:09] Now you could say, well, it's a licensing cost.

[23:10] It doesn't matter.

[23:12] You know they would have sold that Venom topper for $2,000 if Venom was a hit.

[23:18] So yeah, I don't know, man.

[23:20] I'm kind of in this place now where I just want someone to blow me away.

[23:24] That's where I'm at.

[23:25] And none of these games that are coming out at TPF blow me away.

[23:29] It's the calm before the storm.

[23:31] I still do think all these games are the JV games.

[23:35] These are the minor league games.

[23:37] Where's the major league game that's going to make me want to buy this stuff?

[23:40] Where's a game that's going to make me not want to put $15,000 away for my

[23:45] children's investment fund?

[23:46] Where's the game that's going to be?

[23:48] You know what?

[23:49] They can work hard on their own and they can make their own money.

[23:53] I will educate them, but it's my time.

[23:56] This is my money.

[23:57] It's not my dad is my money.

[23:58] I work for this money, not Killy and not Cassie.

[24:01] I'm just joking people.

[24:03] Yesterday was a good day.

[24:04] We knocked down our mortgage by a lot of money and now we have like paid 70% of

[24:10] this house off in just nine months.

[24:13] Super excited.

[24:14] Still got my investment.

[24:15] Still got my pinball money.

[24:17] Still going to scalp Harry Potter people.

[24:19] I'm going to do it.

[24:20] I'm going to get $20,000 for Harry Potter.

[24:22] Mark my words right now.

[24:24] I guarantee you.

[24:26] Canada is going to flip a Harry Potter for $20,000 and I'm telling you this

[24:31] right now.

[24:32] So don't quit and don't cry like babies.

[24:34] It's my money.

[24:36] I'm going to get an allocation fair and square.

[24:38] I'm not going to get a deal from a distro.

[24:40] You all have an opportunity to get one at the same time as me.

[24:44] I'm not going to get special treatment.

[24:46] So when I buy my $15,000 Harry Potter, don't you come crying to me if I want to

[24:52] go sell it for freaking a $5,000 profit because damn American pinball cost me

[24:58] twice that twice that in money out of this family's pocket.

[25:03] So take that to the bank mo foes.

[25:06] Canada out.

[25:28] Yeah.
