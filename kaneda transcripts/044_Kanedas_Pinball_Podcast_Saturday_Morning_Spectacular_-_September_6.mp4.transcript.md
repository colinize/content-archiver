[00:00] All right, we live. We live. We a little bit late today.

[00:09] I don't know. I feel good.

[00:16] How do you guys feel? Feel like we're going to get star wars today?

[00:21] I don't know.

[00:23] I do not know. I don't think anybody knows.

[00:27] I don't even think Stern knew who's to be honest.

[00:30] Oh, man. Here we go.

[00:35] Hmm.

[00:38] I got the ice coffee.

[00:41] Let's let people come in the house.

[00:44] We got to pin baby Jeremy.

[00:47] Thank you for the one two three four five six twippies.

[00:52] Appreciate it.

[00:54] Happy Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:57] A little bit later today.

[00:59] Went to see my little one place soccer.

[01:02] This cast is absolute cast watching a four year old Donna soccer field.

[01:07] They literally are running around like like asteroids.

[01:12] How is the soccer match? It was good.

[01:14] Jang is.

[01:16] I'll tell you is better than Stern star.

[01:18] Oh shoot. It's too soon.

[01:20] We're going to talk about Stern star wars.

[01:22] We're hearing what the buzzer lack of buzz is on the streets.

[01:28] The kids are getting nervous, man.

[01:31] It's feeling like this launches being made up as they go.

[01:35] No NDA required to hang out with canadus pinball podcasts.

[01:40] The worlds somewhat favorite pinball podcast.

[01:45] How does everybody doing?

[01:47] Want to thank all the six hundred and sixty three.

[01:51] Four subscribers that are listening on a weekly basis to the worlds.

[01:57] Most entertaining.

[01:59] Most dynamic.

[02:01] No show notes.

[02:03] Keep.

[02:04] Keeps you informed.

[02:05] Keeps you smiling.

[02:06] Keeps you laughing.

[02:07] Like if you're not listening to canadus pinball podcasts.

[02:10] You're not getting the full picture.

[02:12] I feel bad.

[02:13] You know, for just five dollars a month.

[02:15] I'm giving you more fun than these damn machines.

[02:17] Are you guys know it?

[02:19] I should have told you that.

[02:20] You're not allowed to.

[02:21] You know, I'm just , what's happening right now?

[02:23] Is the house?

[02:25] What else is happening right now.

[02:27] You know, like, I got some inside information.

[02:29] Look, sad boy.

[02:31] Just hitting with the 50 bucks right away.

[02:33] My boy must have had a good night at the casino.

[02:36] Sad boy.

[02:37] Thank you so much.

[02:38] Let's read what you.

[02:42] Have become a staple now on this show.

[02:43] You've been kicking this show off.

[02:44] Every week.

[02:45] With your donations.

[02:46] in my honest opinion.

[02:47] What's good, brother?

[02:48] Cuphead is dead in the water from copy, written,

[02:52] mech, that will probably keep it from being released.

[02:56] Wow.

[02:57] So there's a mech in Cuphead that they can't release.

[03:02] Warm hole closes due to a divorce.

[03:06] Wow, is that true?

[03:08] And Arvid can't even save predator.

[03:11] Talk about a fun, filled week.

[03:15] Wait, so the due to owns warm hole pinball

[03:18] is getting divorced, which probably means

[03:21] the wife is taking half of all of those games.

[03:25] There's no faster way to destroy

[03:27] a wealthy man's happiness than to get a divorce.

[03:32] You know, I have no pre-none.

[03:34] None, none, none.

[03:36] This is it.

[03:37] This is it, not breaking up the family unit.

[03:40] Not gonna get divorced the moment the kids are like

[03:42] out of school, because I'm chasing tail,

[03:44] like an idiot.

[03:45] Nope.

[03:46] This is it.

[03:48] It is sad to hear that though.

[03:49] It is sad.

[03:50] Divorce sucks.

[03:51] Painful.

[03:52] It's painful.

[03:55] Yeah, it's really sad.

[03:57] Whenever divorce happens,

[03:58] it's never like the guy gets half of the woman's pinball

[04:02] machines or half of her car collection.

[04:04] You know what I'm saying?

[04:06] You know, half of the Birken bags,

[04:08] anything you're gonna get half of as a man

[04:11] you're never gonna want.

[04:13] What's the leak on Star Wars?

[04:16] Oh man.

[04:17] There's no leaks on Star Wars.

[04:20] There's no, I'll tell you right now.

[04:24] From what I've heard, like,

[04:25] Stern doesn't even have like a full artwork game

[04:29] rolling around the joint there.

[04:30] Like they're keeping it very under wraps.

[04:33] But I continue to hear more and more information

[04:36] on the game from people that have played it.

[04:43] And, you know, look,

[04:45] they're not giving me like too many specifics,

[04:48] but just feels like the same old story.

[04:51] Stuff was yanked out of the game.

[04:56] And the game is just, I'm hearing,

[04:58] it's not gonna blow us away.

[05:03] It's, I'm hearing it's better than the Steve Richie game,

[05:07] which arguably is maybe the lowest bar

[05:11] in the history of Star Wars games.

[05:13] It's better than that.

[05:14] And I think it's gonna be better than that

[05:16] because of the code, you know,

[05:18] I don't even think this game's gonna have a mech

[05:20] as like impressive as the HyperDrive.

[05:23] Most likely the ATST is the mech

[05:27] and it's gonna be much like the mech in Avatar

[05:30] that just falls us over.

[05:34] But I'm just hearing that the game is just all right.

[05:38] Like it's okay, like it's fun, it's okay.

[05:40] It's not gonna be this like take my money now,

[05:46] OMG game, I think we're gonna see a much simpler layout.

[05:50] I think we're gonna see a game meant

[05:53] for more casual pinball fun, more universally easy to play.

[05:58] And that's the vibe I'm getting.

[06:01] Well, Ellie sell out fast, says Tony.

[06:10] I don't think I, I, I, I, I, I, I, Star Wars, right?

[06:14] It's, I don't know.

[06:17] I mean, really, I think it in the end,

[06:18] it's gonna come down to how much different

[06:22] the Ellie is over the premium.

[06:23] I think if they make the premium look as good as the Ellie,

[06:28] the problem with all Ellie is now gang is like

[06:30] nobody cares anymore.

[06:32] Just nobody cares.

[06:33] They've ruined the what an Ellie means.

[06:35] And Ellie has been absolutely completely turned into

[06:41] a meaningless over price like token

[06:45] for insecure men to buy now because the problem is,

[06:49] is not only did they over make the Ellie's,

[06:50] they overcharge and then the anniversary additions

[06:53] have, you know, in more recent times been the nicer,

[06:57] even game.

[06:58] So I just think what is having an Ellie now me?

[07:01] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[07:02] We used to like, we used to be nervous

[07:05] on the eve of a new Stern launch

[07:08] that we were not on a distros Ellie list

[07:10] and we were gonna get shut out.

[07:13] And I mean it when I say there hasn't been an Ellie

[07:16] as nice as Ghostbusters since Ghostbusters.

[07:18] We are now like four years, four, five years

[07:23] in which Stern Ellie's have all been,

[07:26] I think just too close or basic to every other model

[07:32] nothing's had an exclusive anything that's been a must have.

[07:37] 770 Ellie's in the US is maybe a lot,

[07:43] Jenga's but it's Star Wars.

[07:45] So if it's like a Darth Vader themed Ellie

[07:50] and the other ones aren't cool, like yeah,

[07:53] like it'll sell out.

[07:54] Like this game needs to like look stunning.

[07:57] And I hope they nail it.

[07:59] It's not Zombie Eddie on art.

[08:01] It is a Star Wars artist.

[08:04] It is not Randy Martinez.

[08:06] It is an all new artist.

[08:09] My Harry Potter arcade plays just like the CES.

[08:12] Yeah.

[08:14] Well brought, you know, cause, you know,

[08:15] like I think you're missing a shaker motor

[08:17] and I think you're missing that's it, right?

[08:20] That you really need.

[08:21] I think everything else, you have the Hot Rails, right?

[08:24] You've got everything else.

[08:26] You know, the funny part about Potter gang and right.

[08:29] The reason why, just think about it for a minute.

[08:32] The fact that they could sell you a $10,000 Potter

[08:38] and make money on it.

[08:39] What does that tell you about what's in the $15,000 Potter?

[08:44] That's it, right?

[08:45] It's like there was nothing to take out.

[08:49] I mean, they maybe could have removed the upper play field.

[08:52] I don't know, but not really.

[08:54] You need it for the quidditch stuff.

[08:55] Like there was not a ton in Potter.

[08:58] So not a ton that take out.

[09:01] It does play great.

[09:02] There's no denying the fact that Potter does play great.

[09:13] Let's talk about this NDA now.

[09:16] So what is going on with this launch of Star Wars?

[09:19] Like what is going on?

[09:20] It's like, why did they put out the teaser?

[09:25] If they didn't have everything else approved,

[09:31] it really is looking like someone made a mistake.

[09:35] And now that they're making media sign an NDA

[09:40] because the game might not be revealed

[09:42] before they get there.

[09:43] First of all, that's how the media should see the game

[09:46] before everybody else with an NDA.

[09:49] But that wasn't Stern's plan.

[09:51] But here's what's going to happen.

[09:54] I'm going to tell you exactly how this is going to go.

[09:57] They're going to get everyone to sign NDAs.

[10:02] They're going to do a dealer call on Tuesday.

[10:06] The images are going to leak on Tuesday

[10:09] before the media day, which makes the media day pointless.

[10:13] And that's how it's all going to go down.

[10:15] So get ready.

[10:17] That's exactly how it's going to happen.

[10:21] I'm not going to Stern next week.

[10:24] Just not doing it.

[10:25] It's my mom's birthday.

[10:27] And I also just don't why would I go to Stern

[10:31] when the game's going to be at automated in a week or two.

[10:36] And I'm just not going to do it.

[10:39] And the other reason I'm not going

[10:42] is because of what I've been hearing from people

[10:44] that have played the game.

[10:47] I've been hearing from people that have played the game

[10:49] and they are not talking about it in a way

[10:53] that makes me want to spend any extra money to go see it.

[10:58] So there's that.

[11:06] The fact that Stern paid, Vic, for you guys to go see John Wick,

[11:10] they paid for your travel and your hotel.

[11:13] I mean, seriously, that's how desperate they were.

[11:17] Did they reveal the Star Wars game yet?

[11:19] I mean, Jeremy, I don't understand.

[11:21] Yeah, they did.

[11:23] We're just still speculating when it's come on, man.

[11:26] Come on.

[11:27] I love you, Jeremy, but clearly they didn't reveal the game.

[11:32] Clearly.

[11:37] Like, I just think this game is going to divide the community.

[11:46] I think what's going for it is once that

[11:48] theme song hits and once the scroll happens on the screen,

[11:57] and we see the fall of the Empire,

[11:59] and they tell the story of how they're

[12:01] going to arrange all these iconic moments, I don't care.

[12:06] I don't care.

[12:09] That's why they're going to sell 770 right away.

[12:13] It's still Star Wars.

[12:16] And the moments of the movie that we love

[12:19] are going to be served up to us in a way that's way better

[12:24] than what Dwight did with the Richie game.

[12:27] That was the worst coding decision ever

[12:32] to just stack different movie modes together

[12:36] for pinball multipliers.

[12:41] For lack of a better word, Dwight, what were you thinking?

[12:46] Christopher Franchey.

[12:47] Is there a Batman 66 in that set of pop culture vehicles?

[12:51] There is a bat mobile right here.

[12:56] Not 66, though.

[12:58] The artists who did this series didn't do Batman,

[13:00] and then I got Akira over here.

[13:04] The artist who did this didn't do Batman 66.

[13:07] He did the Michael Keaton Batman.

[13:12] I'm taking a day to how many launches do you think

[13:14] the Stern needs to do to get it right?

[13:16] Clearly, I don't know what they're doing.

[13:21] But can the pinball be any worse than your glasses?

[13:26] These glasses, baby.

[13:27] I'm looking good.

[13:28] It's a tight fit.

[13:29] It's a tight fit, if you know what that means.

[13:32] Most of you don't.

[13:33] OK.

[13:34] But I get it.

[13:35] The Sartorial Choices of Pinball Buyers

[13:39] leaves a little, maybe a lot to be desired.

[13:41] OK.

[13:42] There's not going to make me buy it.

[13:47] Better have it under the glass.

[13:48] Well, yeah.

[13:50] I mean, I agree.

[13:53] I think if this game has a really fun force use of magnets,

[13:56] because Borg likes magnets.

[13:58] And I think if this game has a couple like Wow Mix,

[14:04] and it has a lightsaber moment in battles,

[14:06] and the sound is going to be good, I think, look,

[14:11] it's still Star Wars gang.

[14:13] It's going to make you guys want to sell your D&Ds,

[14:15] and your Venoms, and your John Wicks,

[14:17] and maybe your James Bond.

[14:19] And yeah, I think people are just starving for themes like these.

[14:23] So whenever you make a Star Wars game,

[14:26] it has a fighting chance to be very successful.

[14:29] I think they're still going to sell a lot of these.

[14:32] I've been Stern won't use the magnet on this game.

[14:35] It's the most obvious method used.

[14:36] But I know Borg loves magnets.

[14:38] There's going to be magnets in this game.

[14:46] And then I hate to break everybody,

[14:47] but have 100% confirmation that Walking Dead

[14:50] is after this game.

[14:52] 100%.

[14:54] It's not Tron, it's Walking Dead.

[14:58] Rumor that they might be putting the show clips in

[15:03] still feels like culturally we've

[15:05] moved on from Walking Dead.

[15:10] What else we got here?

[15:13] So more questions and answers.

[15:18] Another weekend with nothing for us to chew on regarding Star

[15:22] Wars, they couldn't give us a little.

[15:25] They couldn't just pan across the cabinet.

[15:29] I really do think it's a shame that they have fumbled this.

[15:38] I've also heard that the new CMO, it's Stern,

[15:44] isn't really doing much, to be honest.

[15:48] And he just doesn't come from this world.

[15:53] So I think he's a little probably lost in the new category

[15:58] he's in, not surprised.

[16:01] But I also hear, and I've heard this over the years,

[16:05] that Stern just doesn't want to invest in marketing ideas

[16:10] and doesn't want to invest in creative ways

[16:13] to launch the games.

[16:15] They're very cheap.

[16:16] They still see themselves as a company whose target audience

[16:23] are the distributors, not the customers, not the collectors.

[16:27] And this has been Stern's real problem over the last five years.

[16:31] It was the main focus of my meeting with them.

[16:34] They continue to not understand who is the actual target

[16:40] for their marketing, for their themes, everything,

[16:43] the way they act.

[16:46] They really do think they can just do these distributor handshake

[16:50] deals and sell all their products.

[16:52] And all the consumers are just going to lose $3,000 on every LE.

[16:56] And then they're not, they haven't even tried other than lowering the number.

[17:02] They haven't tried to give us more LE value.

[17:06] They haven't.

[17:07] They just continue to watch LE machines tank in value.

[17:15] Well, I think more and more consumers are getting on other bandwaggings.

[17:19] I am, I'm going to talk about Dune in a second.

[17:24] You know, I was talking to David Van S.

[17:27] And I have an update.

[17:29] I have an update on what his response was to my very simple question.

[17:37] Have you sold as many Dune machines as I have of Canadian pinball podcast subscribers?

[17:49] As of today, let me check right now my actual subscriber number

[17:53] as of today is 660-something, 663.

[18:00] Okay.

[18:02] And let's see, let's see my audience.

[18:06] Let's see what we got new here.

[18:07] Hold on.

[18:09] I'm going to get a shout out to some of the newbies.

[18:11] Hold on, I need to move this.

[18:12] Can't see what I'm doing here.

[18:16] Monthly benefits.

[18:17] Oh my gosh.

[18:18] Okay.

[18:19] All right.

[18:20] I want to thank Knight Surf Ride $10 a month, baby.

[18:27] Thank you, Knight Surf Ride.

[18:30] I want to thank, let's see, our new members this month.

[18:33] We've got Andy Palmer.

[18:35] Andy, thank you so much.

[18:38] We've got Craig Young is back.

[18:40] I think Craig like joins and then like, cancels and rejoins like every month.

[18:45] Matthew, Fizzy, 501.

[18:48] Fizzy's been very active in the chat.

[18:52] I want to thank Mike and Manage Mohan.

[18:58] Okay.

[18:59] And then Brian Wilson is $10 a month.

[19:03] Let's go to the shout out to my biggest pledges.

[19:06] Let's see what we got here.

[19:11] Just right now, current.

[19:15] All right.

[19:17] Our key time has had $100 a month.

[19:19] I love this guy.

[19:22] And then we've got Dan Jansen at 50.

[19:26] Dan, thank you.

[19:28] Pete Rosen at 50.

[19:31] Lot of guys at 30.

[19:33] Jordan Melville.

[19:35] Man's worth more than anything.

[19:40] Let's see.

[19:47] Barrel of fun says you still owe them a pizza party.

[19:51] Do I?

[19:56] I'll send them pizza because they need a free lunch.

[19:59] All right.

[20:00] Here's how it went with David.

[20:03] So we're texting.

[20:05] You know, he sent me pictures of parts arriving.

[20:09] It's cool.

[20:09] Good to see.

[20:11] I asked him, how many, you know, have you sold as many doons as I have

[20:16] subscribers?

[20:18] And he's like busy day at the office.

[20:20] And you know, there's just two things happening with David.

[20:26] There's a there's I think there's three things happening with David.

[20:31] There's intentions.

[20:34] There's realities.

[20:39] And then there's delusions.

[20:43] OK.

[20:44] Intentions, realities and delusions.

[20:48] OK.

[20:49] And I'm going to explain what I mean by that.

[20:52] Because I always do love having correspondence with David.

[20:55] But like I literally work in the world of public relations.

[21:00] I work in the world of communication and spin doctrine and spin

[21:06] doctrine by that.

[21:07] I mean, when you, you know, selectively used language to try to spin

[21:13] a different narrative, even if the truth and the reality is anything but that.

[21:19] So let me paraphrase because you know, there's just a text chat.

[21:23] So I'm not going to share word for word.

[21:27] First thing is like, look, we're very happy with lab rent sales.

[21:33] You know, and he said something like we've got 81 lab rent games left to be sold.

[21:39] OK.

[21:39] So I saw that.

[21:40] I was shocked.

[21:41] I thought they were all spoken for.

[21:42] They were all like, because remember, let's go back in history.

[21:46] When lab rent came out, they announced they're making 1200 lab rent games.

[21:54] Remember, that was what happened when they announced lab rent.

[21:57] OK.

[21:58] So now they got 81 left.

[22:01] I'm and he said there's sound like one to two a week.

[22:04] I mean, it's like, that's like nothing, right?

[22:06] It's like barely is over.

[22:08] That would take over a year to get rid of those 81.

[22:12] And also, like the other problem is, I mean, I know distros that are sitting on lab

[22:17] rent games, like sitting on them new in box.

[22:19] So that means does that mean America?

[22:23] Does that mean barrels has 81 in boxes at barrels or those are at distros?

[22:31] So not sure.

[22:33] But OK.

[22:34] So that's fine.

[22:35] You know, it is what it is.

[22:36] Well, first he said, he said something first.

[22:39] He said, you know, no manufacturer discloses their sales numbers until near the end of the

[22:47] production run.

[22:49] So I'm like, all right.

[22:50] Well, yes, yes and no.

[22:52] Yes and no.

[22:53] So I think more yes, right?

[22:56] Like that's true.

[22:57] But in the end, that normally only happens when you know you're not going to reach your

[23:02] goal.

[23:04] And so then you are going to preemptively limit the number you're now going to make.

[23:10] So what happened with lab rent is, you know, they realize that they, they, OK, before I say

[23:18] this, I want to say where he said, then the next thing he says is 81 lab rents are left.

[23:25] And the game has exceeded our sales expectations.

[23:29] OK, this is where like the delusion comes in.

[23:34] You initially said you wanted to make 1200 lab rent games.

[23:40] That was your intent.

[23:42] That was your expectation.

[23:44] When you release a game and say, we're making 1200.

[23:47] When the pinball brothers say we want to make 800 predators.

[23:51] That is your expectations.

[23:54] Exceeding your expectations would be to get 800 and one orders of predator.

[24:02] Creating your expectations would be 1200 and one lab rents.

[24:08] So anything less than that cannot exceed your expectations.

[24:14] Or if the only way that could be true is if you don't even think you have anywhere, your

[24:20] expectations are to get nowhere near 1200 sold.

[24:24] But yet you announced you were going to make that many.

[24:27] Which is also delusional on some level.

[24:30] OK.

[24:31] So if you, when you said you were going to make 1200 lab rents and then you realize you

[24:37] weren't going to make it, was it 1100?

[24:40] Even if it was 1100, then they reduced it to 1000, right?

[24:45] Is that what happened?

[24:47] They said we're not going to make 1100.

[24:48] We're going to make 1000.

[24:49] OK.

[24:50] OK, so you took 100 off the total because the demand wasn't there.

[24:54] Now there's another almost 100 unsolved.

[24:57] But don't tell me it exceeded your expectations.

[25:01] Don't.

[25:02] Like this is the stuff is like I like David a lot.

[25:04] I like his passion.

[25:05] But when he says stuff like that, I just am like, what?

[25:09] What are you saying to me, man?

[25:10] He's like, when he told me once, Chris, if I had a day one sell out, I would be disappointed.

[25:17] I, he's like, I don't want that.

[25:19] Oh, sure, you don't.

[25:20] Again, like, what are we speaking here?

[25:24] OK.

[25:25] Someone asked about the doon sales.

[25:29] He basically can, you know, they have not sold 663 doons.

[25:34] I don't know the number, but they have it.

[25:36] He then went on to say that the pinball market over the last seven months has softened significantly

[25:44] from where it was.

[25:47] And I just want to say something to that.

[25:50] It's only soft.

[25:52] David, because you may do.

[25:57] I want to repeat that.

[25:59] You're only feeling soft sales on this game because it's do.

[26:06] Spooky's going to sell 900 and 99 beetle juices in one day in one hour.

[26:14] So you know what I'm saying?

[26:16] Jersey Jack has sold more $15,000 Harry Potter's in one month than all the doon sales combined.

[26:27] And that easily, like they've sold guns and roses and Harry Potter are similar.

[26:32] Like they've sold as many Harry Potter's basically as GNRs.

[26:35] Like it's a sales phenomenon for J.J.P.

[26:39] in the same market that you released do.

[26:43] So that's the delusion that my game's not selling because the market's weak.

[26:50] It's not the market that's weak.

[26:53] It's the title that's weak.

[26:56] And that's a hard sort of pill to swallow because it really must hurt.

[27:03] And look, I am looking forward to.

[27:05] I'm going to go to automate it.

[27:07] I'm going to play the new doon on the new code.

[27:10] And I keep hearing.

[27:12] The other thing he said to me is he thinks once the game goes to expo and people jump on it,

[27:16] it's going to sell out.

[27:18] That people have said it's that good.

[27:20] When you get the cinematic experience, it's going to sell out.

[27:24] And like again, I hope so.

[27:27] I hope for their sake that happens.

[27:30] Right.

[27:31] I'm not rooting against this company.

[27:33] Like I hope so.

[27:36] I hope they do.

[27:37] I hope they move units because they need to.

[27:40] Like if expo doesn't become like a watershed moment for them, I hope that's the right phrase.

[27:48] I think they're in trouble because then, you know, but the problem is, you know, now

[27:55] they're going to be up against Star Wars and the Walking Dead remastered.

[27:59] Right.

[28:00] And, you know, doon's not cheap.

[28:03] Right.

[28:04] It's not cheap.

[28:05] And I think everyone's sort of like, I think people, like, there's a big difference.

[28:10] And I think King Kong is suffering from this.

[28:13] Harry Potter is not.

[28:15] There is a big difference between, you made a really fun game that I really enjoy playing

[28:22] at a show.

[28:24] To me, that's King Kong.

[28:27] Really enjoy flipping King Kong.

[28:30] I don't ever want to own one.

[28:32] And that is the hurdle that doon has to overcome.

[28:35] And David and my friends over at barrels, trust me when I say this.

[28:42] If you want to sell doon machines at Pimball Expo and give people the cinematic experience

[28:50] to like really see how your game is like playing the movie, you cannot just have the game

[29:00] on the loud show floor and have that experience be interrupted by the noise and the distractions

[29:11] of a show.

[29:14] It's like having your movie on a screen and 25 other movies blasting at the same time.

[29:21] You need, trust me when I say this, David.

[29:25] You guys need to get a private section at Pimball Expo.

[29:31] Have a doon room.

[29:32] Great name, almighty yogurt.

[29:35] Have a doon room that is pitch black where this game can come to life.

[29:42] If you just throw it on the show floor, trust me.

[29:46] You're going to have the same lukewarm response and sales that avatar had.

[29:55] So trust me, you're going to have to, they will have a tent and headphones.

[30:01] I don't know.

[30:02] Like headphones don't do it, man.

[30:04] I'm just going to say this right now, Carrie.

[30:07] Headphones and Pimball to me are our distraction.

[30:13] I don't like wearing headphones.

[30:16] It changes everything.

[30:18] It's not, it's a weird way.

[30:21] It's like watching a movie while you wear headphones.

[30:23] There's something about the sound needs to come from the back box.

[30:29] What I don't like about headphones is you lose a lot of the natural sounds of the game.

[30:37] And it sounds more tinny and more like metallic and more like artificial.

[30:44] A Pimball machines true experience happens when there is distance between the speakers,

[30:52] your ears, your fingers, all of that.

[30:56] A headphone experience to me is not going to cut it.

[31:00] They need a separate room.

[31:04] They need to do it that way.

[31:06] Okay.

[31:07] I'm just saying that is, that is like, this, I don't want the pressure, even just the pressure

[31:15] on my ears is changing the dynamic of how you should experience a Pimball machine.

[31:22] And they're not going to sell out because it's doing.

[31:29] I mean, it's just, it's just like, it's like legitimately, there's going to be a moment.

[31:35] There's going to be a moment when spooky sells a thousand beetle juices in nine minutes.

[31:41] There's going to be a moment.

[31:42] Trust me.

[31:44] When they sell a thousand beetle juices in nine minutes, there's going to be a moment

[31:49] where David realizes we didn't get the right theme.

[31:56] And I mean, they already know that, but because, you know, because again, like in his head,

[32:02] he's like, well, it's the market that's soft.

[32:05] It's not.

[32:06] People are writing checks for fifteen thousand dollar Harry Potter's left and right.

[32:10] And you know, David, like, I just got to be candid, man, if you made anything on this

[32:15] back wall, anything, they, it all would have outsold.

[32:19] Do you know, can, should we go around the horn?

[32:23] If you made Flintstones, you outsell, doon.

[32:28] I'm serious.

[32:29] More people would have bought a modern Yabba David do Flintstone game based on the original

[32:36] cartoon, then doon.

[32:41] If you made Mario Kart, we didn't really want to start with Mario Kart, but Mario Kart

[32:47] would have outsold doon.

[32:50] The eight team, I mean this, if you made the eight team pinball, dun, dun, dun, dun,

[32:58] dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

[33:00] right?

[33:01] I can't even hum the damn doom theme song.

[33:04] Nobody can.

[33:06] Nobody remembers it.

[33:07] It hasn't left an indelible.

[33:08] I get there's like a great orchestration in the film, but like, okay, name, like,

[33:13] hum me the doom theme song, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

[33:19] dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

[33:20] right?

[33:21] Optimus Prime, G1 Transformers, what are you doing?

[33:25] Brian Savage, your partner, was in charge of the Transformers and GI Joe fan clubs for

[33:31] like 20 years, and you come out with doom with Timothy Schumacher.

[33:37] This one's just the killer, French, you get ready.

[33:40] Batman 89, Batman 89, just go get it.

[33:46] Make it again.

[33:47] Sell a thousand units in one minute.

[33:50] You know, wait till they get a load of me.

[33:53] Winged freak, terraces.

[33:55] Wait till they get a load of me.

[33:58] What is he get those toys?

[34:01] You know, Batman.

[34:03] Get the Prince album.

[34:06] And then obviously Akira, I've been saying it forever, Akira.

[34:10] Akira would sell, you have no idea the amount of Akira fans in the world.

[34:18] But what do I know?

[34:19] What do I know?

[34:22] What do I know?

[34:27] Um, and also like the other thing too, is now, is like, again, the games, the games 12,000

[34:33] and now additional accessories for the sling plastics and the shooter.

[34:38] Like, it's just, it's just, it's just, like people are not going to be dropping 13,

[34:42] $14,000 on the game.

[34:46] Sad boy, you guys are really bad, by the way.

[34:49] You're, I'm going to, I'm going to shame my 113.

[34:52] Let's, like super chats.

[34:54] Carrie, how do you get the super chats going?

[34:57] Like what am I supposed to do here?

[34:59] How about this?

[35:00] How about this?

[35:02] If you, if we reach another, I'll tell you some details about Put Ready Gaming's Big Bang

[35:10] Bar.

[35:13] Hmm?

[35:16] Nobody wants Akira nerd anime, Dave, you don't get it, Dave.

[35:20] You don't, you got to go watch Akira.

[35:22] It's, it's like the perfect theme for pinball with the music, the energy, the magnets,

[35:27] Tetsuo grabbing the ball.

[35:29] Like, Neo Tokyo on, if you put Neo Tokyo on,

[35:32] Neo under glass, Dave, sold out.

[35:35] Again, we're not talking thousands of units gang, you would sell a thousand Akira's

[35:40] if done right.

[35:43] Are you ready for the new pinball, Star Wars, Fall of the Empire?

[35:47] Uh, yeah, Junior, where you been, bro?

[35:49] Like, we've been talking about it, I heard it's mediocre, and Stern knows it, and that's

[35:53] why the marketing around it is pissboard.

[35:56] Anything new?

[35:57] Akira would sell dozens.

[36:04] Anyway, look, it's, look, I wouldn't start with Akira either gang, I would start with Transformers

[36:13] the Movie.

[36:15] I would do Transformers G1 the Movie, Unicron, the death of Optimus, Megatron, Integalvatron,

[36:24] Rotrod and the Rotemus.

[36:28] All right, I think, I think I did it.

[36:31] I think I did it.

[36:34] I think I reconnected it.

[36:35] I think, I think, uh, David Venez, David Venez pulled the plug.

[36:43] Are we back?

[36:44] We good, we good, she.

[36:47] That was weird, like, the whole thing just fucking crashed.

[36:59] Ah, looking super chat me, super chat me, come on, I'm about to see myself some money.

[37:09] Look at this.

[37:13] I'm paying myself.

[37:15] Yeah, literally, I don't know what to do.

[38:15] Sorry, guys, I'm having issues on YouTube.

[38:40] All right, can we hear me now?

[38:42] Can you hear me now?

[38:43] Are we back?

[38:44] Are we good?

[38:45] Can you hear me?

[38:46] All right.

[38:47] This is why I don't get any super chats of stars, because I like literally don't know what

[38:54] I'm doing.

[38:55] I need to do the carry multiple angles.

[38:56] Carry says it over here.

[38:57] Carry says it over here.

[38:58] Why do you think Star Wars ain't selling?

[39:00] Gonna tell you like this.

[39:01] Gonna tell you like this.

[39:02] Gonna tell you like that.

[39:04] All the different angles, all the different angles and carry space.

[39:07] Let's do it.

[39:08] Let's do it.

[39:09] Let's do it.

[39:10] Dude, you can't beg for money and not even do a basic livestream.

[39:19] I just did, baby.

[39:22] I just did.

[39:23] That's why I need more money.

[39:25] I can't afford a new cable.

[39:26] I actually ordered a new cable.

[39:27] It's this damn cable.

[39:28] It's like, it's bent and it just keeps popping out.

[39:33] All right.

[39:34] Here's the deal.

[39:35] Ready gaming is making Big Bang bar.

[39:38] What's really retro Ralph is back.

[39:42] Get out of town Ralph.

[39:45] Well, is this the real retro Ralph though?

[39:47] I hope so.

[39:48] Ralph.

[39:49] Ralph.

[39:50] Ralph.

[39:51] Ralph.

[39:52] We have an expo playing.

[39:53] Ralph.

[39:54] You're getting you're getting unblocked on all of the channels today.

[39:56] Welcome back.

[39:57] We're happy to have you.

[39:59] We are happy you're here.

[40:00] We are happier here.

[40:01] You have no idea.

[40:02] It's not Ralph.

[40:03] It's not Ralph.

[40:04] It's not Ralph.

[40:05] Oh my god.

[40:06] It's not Ralph.

[40:07] Is it retro Ralph?

[40:08] Is it?

[40:09] Oh my god.

[40:11] Ralph is spelled wrong.

[40:15] Oh my god.

[40:16] That's a good troll.

[40:18] That's a beautiful troll.

[40:20] David Van S.

[40:21] You're watching, brother.

[40:22] David, we were talking about you, bro.

[40:24] David, you should come on YouTube.

[40:26] David, join the YouTube chat.

[40:28] David, you know, David, I'm going to put you on the spot.

[40:32] I'm going to put you on the spot.

[40:34] Come on.

[40:35] There's a moment.

[40:36] A moment of transparency.

[40:37] It's almost like we're doing a live interview in front of an audience.

[40:40] How many?

[40:41] How many of you sold, David?

[40:43] We know you need to sell more.

[40:44] Come on.

[40:45] This should have been like, this shouldn't make anything anybody nervous.

[40:48] We know the game's going to go to X-ray.

[40:50] It was giving some good advice on how to show the game.

[40:53] You got to get your own room.

[40:55] Show it without headphones.

[40:56] Show it in a dark room.

[40:58] Don't pipe and drain.

[40:59] Doon, it's the doon room.

[41:01] Create the doon room.

[41:03] And give people like 20 minutes on and just rotate people through.

[41:09] You're driving.

[41:11] Well, you shouldn't be watching if you're driving drive safe.

[41:15] Fake Ralph gives me more money than real Ralph.

[41:19] I'm not going to the media day.

[41:21] Ian, Ian, why would I want to go to the media?

[41:23] I'm not going to the media day.

[41:25] Ian, Ian, Ian, why would I want to go to the media?

[41:28] I'm not going to the media day.

[41:30] Why would I take money out of my pocket?

[41:34] Ian, why would I take money out of my pocket?

[41:38] I like fake money.

[41:42] I'm so broke people.

[41:44] All I got is this is all I got in the world.

[41:47] How many nudge magazines can I buy here?

[41:50] There's a few in there.

[41:52] There's a few.

[41:53] I always like to have just 500 bucks in cash.

[41:55] I mean, if you ever mug me, you're going to get 500 bucks.

[41:57] I just always need 500 dollars in cash on me at all times.

[42:01] Why would I spend money out of my own pocket to go to Stern to see a Star Wars game

[42:06] where Stern's own employees are telling me it's mediocre?

[42:10] Ian, I'll leave it to you.

[42:12] I'll leave it to Don.

[42:13] I'll leave it.

[42:14] Ralph's not going to be there.

[42:15] Jason Napstner is not going to be there.

[42:17] It's going to be Colin.

[42:19] Now that Colin's a real journalist.

[42:21] Did you read that, by the way?

[42:23] Did you read his email?

[42:25] I guess I'm just now the guy doing the research.

[42:28] I guess I'm just now the guy who can legitimately call himself a journalist.

[42:33] I guess I'm now that pinball journal.

[42:36] This guy is talking about covering pinball.

[42:38] He's covering the guys of strip.

[42:40] What a joke.

[42:43] It's pinball Colin.

[42:45] You're not trying to really do the research to understand the historical significance of different religious sects in the Middle East

[42:53] and how it's led to thousands of years of turmoil and how the implications of getting the facts right on this story.

[42:59] You know, we'll have grave consequences for genit pinball Colin.

[43:05] If you need to take credit for like becoming someone you can write an article about Cuphead being delayed.

[43:14] You got some problems, bro.

[43:16] Yeah, got some problems.

[43:20] And then it was like, now that I'm a real journalist, can people please give me money?

[43:25] I mean, it was like, look, you know me like, I'm not like, I love the super chats.

[43:30] I love the stars on Facebook.

[43:32] People, people give me money and subscribe to the show because they see value in the content.

[43:38] And the part that Colin doesn't get still is the reason why the people aren't subscribing Colin is because they don't see the value in your life.

[43:48] How you in your content, if you make it better, not, not more journalistic, just better.

[43:57] And you'll get more support.

[44:00] Carry hardy gets support because people enjoy his content.

[44:04] Other content creators have hit a wall at a low number of subscribers and support because that's that's the that's what the value people see.

[44:15] Quit trolling Stern.

[44:22] I still can't wait to see how he tries to reboot the twippy's just to prove Canadian wrong.

[44:27] I love it. I'm going to send him on a mission to do all this hard work in the show still going to be terrible.

[44:32] It's over. The twippy's are dead. Stern on the leaves being special are dead.

[44:35] Like it's different hobby now.

[44:37] It's a different hobby now. Like nobody cares anymore.

[44:40] Like nobody cares about a lot of that stuff anymore.

[44:43] I think collecting is kind of dead like, okay, ready for a padradi gaming.

[44:47] So here's a big mistake. Padradi gaming is about to make.

[44:50] Okay. So padradi gaming is about to make the remake to Big Bang bar.

[44:55] Okay.

[44:56] And well, yeah, of course, my mic is better on YouTube.

[45:01] This is the Facebook is just the phone. This is this is my pro mic.

[45:07] Padradi gaming is about to remake Big Bang bar.

[45:11] And here's a big mistake they're about to make.

[45:14] So because they don't have the Capcom license instead of putting Capcom.

[45:22] Real big. You know how Capcom is at the let's go look at it right now.

[45:27] Let's go look at it because I can I can I can share screen.

[45:32] This is why it's fun. This is why I'm hot. This is why you're not calling.

[46:07] All right. Where's the Big Bang bar?

[46:12] I want the back box.

[46:21] Man, there's like not a lot of good photos anywhere.

[46:27] Let's see.

[46:29] Is there one of those one on eBay? What is this?

[46:34] All right. Let's see.

[46:37] Oh man. Like sorry guys. It's taken so long.

[46:39] I just don't know. Okay. Here we go. This is perfect.

[46:44] All right.

[46:47] Here we go. Share screen.

[46:52] I don't know why that even happens.

[46:56] Okay. Where is that?

[47:00] Oh my god. Here we go. All right.

[47:05] All right. So like this beautiful sexy, right?

[47:13] You are signed out. What?

[47:29] Okay. All right. Cool.

[47:31] All right. So you see this?

[47:39] I'm not a Pinterest.

[47:42] Okay. All right. So.

[47:45] All right. You see where it says Capcom real big.

[47:49] Right. You see where it says Capcom real big.

[47:53] All right. So you know, like we're used to this.

[47:56] Like Capcom's an iconic logo.

[47:59] It's beautiful.

[48:02] Now get ready.

[48:04] I'm not going to say it's a real big.

[48:11] To.

[48:16] Let's see.

[48:19] Get ready to see this.

[48:22] Oh my god.

[48:30] Okay.

[48:35] Oh, no, no, no.

[48:37] Opened up a different hold on.

[48:40] Oh man. Okay.

[48:42] Sorry. It's because I got this damn face, but thing blocking

[48:46] everything. That's why it's taking so long.

[48:48] Share screen. No.

[48:50] Share.

[48:51] All right. This is what this is what you're going to see.

[48:56] It's not the, you're not going to see the pinball.

[48:59] I don't know.

[49:02] I don't know.

[49:05] I don't know.

[49:08] I don't know.

[49:09] I don't know.

[49:10] I don't know.

[49:11] I don't know.

[49:12] I don't know.

[49:13] Maybe left it blank.

[49:14] But that's what it's going to be.

[49:17] So.

[49:18] You know, insert Rick from Planetary all mad now has.

[49:28] Canada.

[49:29] All right guys.

[49:30] Let's.

[49:32] Let's.

[49:35] Let's turn it over to you guys.

[49:37] Let's do a little Q&A whatever you I'm going to answer all your

[49:40] questions ask canada anything.

[49:42] I think Jack Danger has that ask.

[49:43] Jack Anything.

[49:44] Ask Canada anything.

[49:46] You can ask me anything personal professional pinball related.

[49:50] You can ask me anything about fashion.

[49:51] Whatever you want to ask me.

[49:54] I do have the best word.

[49:55] Come on, let's get some questions going.

[50:02] You guys are slow, you're like the pinball media.

[50:04] When I went to JJP, all those guys, man,

[50:07] they're like, any questions, nobody had a question.

[50:09] Nobody.

[50:10] They're all like, ah, you go.

[50:16] Yeah, it just makes it look inauthentic

[50:18] when you have Piedredi on it,

[50:19] because it's not how we, it's be like,

[50:21] Piedredi introduces Street Fighter II,

[50:24] and you're like, what the, how do you think Star Wars,

[50:29] Ellie will differentiate from the premium?

[50:32] Robert, I think it's gonna be a, I hope for,

[50:35] I think it's gonna be a character base.

[50:36] Like, you know the way like Slimer was ghost busters?

[50:40] I'm really hoping the Ellie is Darth Vader,

[50:44] like all over the game.

[50:46] That's what I hope it is.

[50:47] So that's my guess.

[50:48] Are you a true Dodgers fan?

[50:51] No, I'm not.

[50:52] I'm an Otani fan.

[50:54] I don't believe anymore in like rooting for specific teams.

[50:58] I'm like, I like players now.

[51:00] It's a weird thing now.

[51:01] I like Otani, and I love Japanese culture,

[51:05] and I love, you know, like,

[51:10] more emotos, rise and more emotos,

[51:13] Mickey motor, like, I love his, his make up of,

[51:18] but yeah, I love players.

[51:20] I don't really care about teams anymore.

[51:23] How do you get involved in pinball

[51:25] and do you regret it retro?

[51:27] Rather than that's funny, it's funny.

[51:31] I got is, wait, is, okay, you know how,

[51:33] you know my story, I got banned from pinside.

[51:35] I just got Lord of the Rings

[51:36] when I had my bedroom arcade and the rest is history.

[51:38] Is there a chance Steve Richie Starles will be like,

[51:42] will be like more?

[51:43] What? What's up?

[51:45] I'm in charge of you now.

[51:46] I'm in charge of you now, because mommy's going.

[51:48] Okay.

[51:49] Okay.

[51:50] What does that mean?

[51:51] I'm in charge of you now.

[51:53] Is Cass going down?

[51:59] Okay. We're getting back to these photos.

[52:02] Do you like poop?

[52:03] Okay.

[52:04] The Frenchie amazing.

[52:05] Like way to keep it, way to keep it.

[52:10] You know, I could tell Frenchie is like, wait, where's Cass?

[52:16] Where's, where's Cass?

[52:18] She's taking Cass?

[52:20] She's taking it off, because it's, it's a question.

[52:23] No, no, hold on a second.

[52:24] I'm going to set, hold your questions, stop writing

[52:26] so I can answer them.

[52:27] I'm going to go set, killing up with it.

[53:47] Hurry up, you can.

[54:18] you

[54:48] all right sorry about that delay you had to go get bobo bobo was outside all right let's

[55:11] get some questions answered here sorry gang this is why this is why I'm hot okay let's

[55:18] go back up here okay okay any new pin theme rumors no we know them all did you

[55:37] drive the demon this week I did how do you think the Star Wars Ellie will

[55:41] different you ask that would Aussie some more than Abba yeah absolutely I

[55:46] don't think it would I don't think Aussie would do tremendously great I think a lot of

[55:51] people I don't I just I don't like I think it would be like Led Zeppelin like in sales I just

[55:58] don't think I don't think I would do that great did Gomez really interview you for Stern

[56:03] CMO no I was not being interviewed for Stern CMO it's the opposite I told them their marketing

[56:10] basically needed needed to reach refocus its efforts on consumers and not

[56:17] distributors and I told them I'd be open to the only job I'd be open to would be the CMO

[56:24] CMO role and I put that thought in their head because Jody wasn't is not a CMO and and and then

[56:31] they go hire a CMO so like I don't know like they hired exactly the role I said they need it I

[56:36] just don't think they got what they needed and I don't think whoever they got really understands

[56:44] the category like I do and I think they would have been better off with me and I mean that I think

[56:49] I told this to George I have 12 years experience expertise in your hobby in your category if you go

[56:57] hire someone outside a category good luck good luck and that's what they got so good luck I don't

[57:04] think I've seen any moves he's made that have made an impact and I haven't even heard from him

[57:09] and I don't think you can be a chief marketing officer at a major pinball company and be

[57:14] you know behind the scenes I just don't but again I think it speaks a little bit to their arrogance

[57:20] that they think they can just sell without being out there and they need to be out there more but I

[57:25] also think the CMO needs to make you know some some moves and I again like I just maybe those

[57:31] are going to come we'll see but I just haven't seen any yet talk about back to the future when

[57:37] Queen actually get it and how good back to the future is going to be probably October 2026 I'm

[57:43] hearing it's packed I'm hearing if you like what you see in Lebowski you're going to see even more

[57:47] awesome stuff and the vibes I'm getting from people that have seen it are so over the moon positive

[57:55] but Raza will come out before back to the future 100% guaranteed how fun is it to hang out

[58:02] automated and when are you going next it is always fun to hang out automated Mike is amazing

[58:09] and I usually go with my boy Frank DeAngelo and I will I'm probably going to go next weekend if

[58:16] people want to go hang out play some dune and and see you know maybe Star Wars even might be there

[58:21] I don't think Star Wars is even on the line though um oh do do do do do I'm reading so you guys keep

[58:27] keep I'm gonna go I'm going in order um why do you wear sunglasses indoors okay because I'm cool

[58:35] like that uh having any more kids now do you like pinballs oh let's see in charge of me

[58:44] maybe I can all right here we go we're caught up a little bit what do you think of TNA do you

[58:51] like the machine and do you think more companies could do similar runs of original IP and if what

[58:56] um I've always thought TNA is like a cool pin at a show I think it's a little like you know

[59:05] it's really good it's I think TNA is unique I think TNA is a great $6,000 game I think TNA is a

[59:14] terrible $9,000 game I think it's I like that it's straight forward the music super cool I remember

[59:21] when scotch has had the whitewood I remember like I think TNA is really cool I I never want to

[59:29] own one personally I would get bored of that pretty quickly but um you know it it was a really

[59:36] cool game um unfortunately TNA 2 turned into Rick and Morty but I you know I just wouldn't spend

[59:43] a lot on a TNA um what's the release window for the next JJP well if I were a betting man

[59:54] I don't think we're gonna see Sonic until fall of 2026 I think this is gonna be a long time

[01:00:04] to make all these potters do you think spooky should switch to at least two games or you're

[01:00:07] absolutely not spooky shouldn't change anything and two games a year means like I think they would have

[01:00:18] to really staff up more but I also just I like the fact that all the whole company is focused on

[01:00:23] making one great game a year I think it works for them I think it works for our wallets I think it

[01:00:28] makes it makes like it makes but look I think spooky is one game a year has more people excited

[01:00:36] than Stern's three to four games a year and you know that's I would rather be working for a company

[01:00:43] that only that can all collaborate and make one great idea work at a time I think once you start

[01:00:49] dividing and and having to like divert resources all over the place it's not worth and they're not

[01:00:54] gonna make twice as much money if they do it that way because they can only produce oh so many

[01:01:00] who is doing raza raza is gonna be made by Dutch pinball x

[01:01:09] um do you think Stern will suffer the same fate as Williams and if so when uh no I don't think

[01:01:16] Stern's gonna bail out a pinball and start making slot machines I do think Stern is um is

[01:01:26] I mean like they're always for sale by the way I do think Stern's gonna have to downsize I do I

[01:01:32] just I don't know what they're gonna do I really I don't think it's gonna last like forever at this

[01:01:39] scale I don't know what the answer is though I think they they scaled real big I just can't see

[01:01:46] the world continually absorbing they mount a game Stern needs them to every year unless like

[01:01:52] the operator scene blows up even more and becomes bigger um what's the car in the top middle behind

[01:01:59] you Mario Kart um if raza is first you mean October 27 no raza is gang alis production will be over

[01:02:14] hopefully by like March okay then raza you know what I'm saying like they need to start making the

[01:02:23] next and then raza raza's numbers are gonna be much less than alis his numbers that's why raza's

[01:02:30] gonna sell out it's gonna be more expensive than Alice but it's a much more like fully flushed out

[01:02:35] game um what is Brenda's dream theme for pinball you know I Brenda would want she would want

[01:02:44] red hot chili peppers and that would be number one that's her favorite band and she would want

[01:02:53] spice girls then I think she would want something for the family like a toy story one or lion king

[01:03:05] do you think Stern might buy spooky and keep them no no no have you got in a chance to play

[01:03:13] updated doon no you think they'll you think they'll have the pinball there will be no pinball in

[01:03:21] raza i can but there will be an interesting thing happening on the apron let me just tell you that

[01:03:27] but the pinball as the pinball as it was designed no you know the the biggest challenge for raza

[01:03:36] with melvin is is trying to unravel what the heck Steve Bowden was trying to do with the code

[01:03:43] you know what i'm saying like that's been the biggest challenge of raza development is like

[01:03:48] Steve Bowden his code it is like and that's the challenge now is like i don't know you're you might

[01:03:57] be getting what he he designed and like i don't know bowden is no lineman he's no you know his

[01:04:04] rule said everything about it was just weird is what i'm hearing um barbie would be great

[01:04:14] um let's see will there be uh edison bulbs on raza topper no so i can tell you right now that

[01:04:22] the there was a an original raza topper design that deep roots you know that john made

[01:04:30] in deeproot fashion they ran out of money and they they didn't implement it but the

[01:04:34] i will tell you this i i've seen the raza topper it's pretty epic cool uh and it is

[01:04:43] not what was on the deeproot game and it's it's gonna it's gonna be neat it's gonna be neat

[01:04:54] if you were going to add a new machine to your collection tomorrow which three are you considering

[01:04:59] um i'm gonna read another question tell us the dirt on where uncanny xmen started today there's

[01:05:06] gotta be more people um all right i'll give you a little okay so first of all if i was going to

[01:05:11] add three machines to my collection today uh that are existing machines uh i would add xmen le

[01:05:22] i i love the way xmen shoots and looks and i like the new code is good i i i want to bang on that

[01:05:31] game i think i would add that um i would add a lore of the rings you see someone dude selling an

[01:05:39] le for fifteen thousand dollars missus stupid like i'm just over like i'm just over i bought my

[01:05:43] lore of the rings for seven the game was originally fifty five hundred i'm just so stupid like

[01:05:49] looking at the le the rings le and the guy doesn't have any the figurines or the mod you want

[01:05:53] anyone's fifteen thousand or fourteen something i'm just like i when i see this stuff game it's so

[01:05:58] easy to say it's so much easier now in twenty twenty five to say no to almost everything and all

[01:06:06] the prices people want for pinball eight years ago i i wanted to buy everything and i would buy

[01:06:12] everything i want it because i didn't feel bad about buying this stuff
