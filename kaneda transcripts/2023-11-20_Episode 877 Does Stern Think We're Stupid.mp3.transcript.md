[00:00] Ah, Happy Monday everybody, I've been up since 5AM, it is Thanksgiving on Thursday,

[03:53] we all got really greedy.

[03:55] But I keep thinking about this, for this hobby to really survive, it really needs to get back

[04:00] to the beautiful dance between new in-box purchases and being able to sell your used games pretty

[04:07] easily for either a little bit of a profit or a break-even point or a little bit of a loss.

[04:13] That's when Pinball was at its healthiest, nobody was doubling up on a game. Remember when Batman

[04:20] SLE came out, it was $15,000 and if you bought one and you wanted to flip it, you know what

[04:26] the flip prices were right when that game came out? Around $17,000. That's it. Nowadays,

[04:33] if they made only 80 versions of an in-demand game, that game that was $15,000 would be

[04:40] initially listed for $30,000. That's how it would be nowadays. And look, I know these manufacturers

[04:47] saw the craziness of COVID. I know we've got a plethora of content creators that are telling you

[04:53] to buy every single game. And I know you guys now know the truth, that a lot of these content creators

[04:58] are getting a discount to shield these games. They're getting kickbacks to promote these games.

[05:04] And you see through it. And that's why Canadian Spinball Podcast has more subscribers than all

[05:09] of those shills combined. And so now we're at this new period in Pinball in which the companies saw

[05:15] all of that behavior. They saw that some value was going to the customer and not to them. And so

[05:22] now we land where we land today. And I want to use this as an example of why I think Stern Pinball

[05:29] might be in big trouble. And the biggest threat to Stern Pinball is Stern Pinball itself. They brought

[05:36] in Seth Davis. And Seth Davis has been making some moves recently that have been very questionable.

[05:43] And I really want to ask a simple question. Do you really feel that Seth Davis, the CEO of

[05:49] Stern Pinball, do you think he is in business because he loves Pinball? Do you think he's at

[05:55] Stern Pinball because he loves this product and he loves this category? Or do you think he's CEO

[06:01] because he loves money? And I understand that there's a balance here. You want your CEO to make your

[06:07] company as profitable as it can be. But remember, Stern Pinball does not have public investors.

[06:12] This company is never going public. So they can try to see how much profit they can make. They can

[06:18] try to see how much they can squeeze out of this community. But the only people that's going to

[06:23] benefit are the investors at Stern Pinball and Seth Davis. And the bonuses those guys will get when

[06:30] they don't even need more money. And so now we're at the point in which Stern Pinball has to decide.

[06:36] Are they going to be all about finding the maximum amount of profit they can make? Or

[06:42] are they going to realize that if they want to keep this hobby healthy and keep it going for the

[06:47] next five to 10 years, they can't treat their customers like idiots? And I'm worried that

[06:54] they are going to make moves that absolutely treat us like we are idiots. We saw the first move.

[07:00] The first major move that we are idiots happened when they made Elvira 40th anniversary edition.

[07:07] Instead of putting a price tag on the game, they gave it to distributors and they said,

[07:12] price it yourselves. And they priced it at $25,000. So Stern Pinball, they didn't even want to stand

[07:19] behind what they thought this game was worth. And so look at what happened to everybody who bought

[07:25] that game now. Think about it. Everyone who bought that game for $20,000 or $25,000,

[07:30] Stern has now released a nicer version of the game. So they burned every single person who bought

[07:36] those 40th anniversaries of Elvira. And here's a question I have for everybody. You know, people

[07:41] always say like, well, the bomb hasn't gone up and Stern's costs have gone up significantly. Let me

[07:46] ask a simple question. How much do you think it costs Stern Pinball to make in Elvira 40th

[07:53] anniversary edition? How much do you think it costs them before they price the machine for a consumer

[08:00] to buy? Think about it like this. There is nothing that is in Elvira 40th anniversary

[08:06] edition that is more expensive or costs more money for Stern than is in the new Blood Kiss

[08:12] edition of the game. So the Blood Kiss edition of the game is $13,000. Now, I bet you the bomb on

[08:19] this game is not even close to $6,000. So think about that for a minute. They're making double the

[08:25] amount of money on this game. So this bomb was $6,000. All right. So let's say it's $6,000. Okay.

[08:32] So then you had people spending $25,000 on a 40th anniversary edition of the game. And then look

[08:40] what happened. And that same game, right? That same exact game, basically, they made it even nicer

[08:46] and they charged half as much money for it just a few years later. To me, that was the first move

[08:52] where Stern was really trying to test the waters on could they do another Batman SLE? And then think

[08:59] about it with Elvira 40th, you didn't even get a topper. You didn't get an exclusive call out from

[09:04] Elvira herself. You didn't get anything extra. You didn't get anything other than the cosmetic

[09:09] stuff they slap on the games. But Elvira 40th didn't really bite Stern because we went through the

[09:15] COVID madness. And through the COVID madness, the value of Elvira 40th, it kind of held pretty

[09:21] strong between like $18,000 and $20,000. But then Stern and pinball absolutely lands with the ultimate

[09:29] FU to the entire pinball community. And they bring out James Bond's 60th anniversary. We had all the

[09:36] shills. You know who they are. They were saying this was accurately priced. And it's Keith Elwin.

[09:41] And there's only 500 in the world. And these are going to go up in value. And Neil McCray apparently

[09:47] bought four of them and flipped them for a profit. And then what did Stern do? They sold it directly

[09:53] for $19,000. And then they like cowards, they removed the price from their website. Why do you

[10:00] think they did that? They did not even want to stand behind their own marketing decision. And

[10:06] these were moves that were made under Seth Davis's reign. And this is a 100% marketing move. And what

[10:13] a cowardly move, right? They realized their marketing decision didn't work out. And then they

[10:18] started to realize this game was tanking in value. Yes, tanking in value in just a couple months,

[10:24] this thing went from 20 grand all the way down to $15,000 new inbox if you want it one, right?

[10:31] And it wasn't working like Stern realized, oh my gosh, we can't just rely on Keith Elwin in scarcity

[10:37] to get money. Like our customers actually have some common sense, like they can actually look down

[10:43] at that game and say, hey, I don't see that much value in the machine. And then all of a sudden,

[10:48] it's not about fun factor. It's not about how popular Keith Elwin is. It's not about scarcity.

[10:54] It's not about limited edition. It's about value. And what do we get for our money? And that's where

[11:00] I think we are at. And all of a sudden now, more and more people are watching all of these games

[11:06] lose so much money instantly. And they're saying to themselves, I don't want to keep going in on

[11:12] every single new game and lose $2,000 to $3,000. If I just wait, the market will correct and bring

[11:19] these things back to the value that the people want in each game. Like we all know that Elton

[11:25] John is not valued by the market at $12,000 to $15,000. A Venom by the market is not valued at $13,000

[11:35] for NLE. And so everyone's losing money. And what happens in a world in which everybody's losing

[11:41] money? Everybody stops and pauses for a little bit. Everyone's going to start reflecting more and

[11:47] more on if this is the smart move. Does this make sense? Because think about it, people. There are

[11:52] thousands of people losing all of this money over the last two years. And those thousands of people

[11:58] that have been burned, they're going to drown out the 50 content creator shills that want you to buy

[12:05] every single new game because they're all being sponsored by distributors to get kickbacks and

[12:10] incentives. There's way more people losing money than making money on the distributor front. And

[12:16] even my distributor friends don't like these high prices. That's the irony of all of it. These distros

[12:21] don't want these prices where they're at. They can't move games in volume anymore. And they've got so

[12:26] much money in inventory that they now can't move unless they heavily discount the product. We have

[12:33] not seen this before. All right. But do you think Stern's learned a lesson? Has Stern been looking

[12:37] at the marketplace and saying, hey, these guys are not stupid. The reason why all these men have

[12:42] all this money to buy a non-essential toy is they've actually been pretty smart in their education.

[12:48] They're actually able to process the world with some common sense. We have to be careful. If we

[12:53] treat these people like morons, then they are going to stop buying from us. And they should

[12:58] really be looking in the mirror and saying, this model won't be sustainable. This won't last forever.

[13:05] We can't keep asking them to pay top dollar before a game has proven to be even good,

[13:12] to be a classic. We were paying this money for the best games in the history of Pimbal. Now we

[13:17] have to spend this money on just every single new release. It's not going to work on games like

[13:22] Venom. It's not going to work if you release Rush at these prices. It didn't even work on Foo Fighters.

[13:27] It's not going to work on Dungeons and Dragons. And heck, it's not going to work on John Wick.

[13:32] If Stern Pimbal is really looking in the mirror and they know what they have coming down the pipeline,

[13:37] they've got to be a little bit worried. You know, and I'm hearing rumblings over at Stern Pimbal that

[13:41] it's all not roses these days. You know, John Borg, I heard, designed an entire game. This is crazy.

[13:47] No one's heard this before. John Borg designed an entire game that was ready to go and then

[13:53] Stern Pimbal fumbled the license and it's never coming out. Imagine designing an entire Pimbal

[13:58] machine and then they lose the license and you can't release it. But knowing Stern, they'll

[14:03] probably just reskin it to something else. They'll just reskin it to something else like,

[14:07] voila, now it's become Dungeons and Dragons, everybody. Enjoy for $13,000. You know, we didn't

[14:13] even talk about this move when it happened. But Tom Copera, that was the head of Stern's mechanical

[14:18] engineering, Tom leaving Stern to go over to Jersey Jack Pimbal. That also is a significant

[14:25] move we haven't really talked about. So what is the climate like over at Stern Pimbal? The thing

[14:30] about a company, and I know this because I'm a creative in a company. There's a difference between

[14:34] the financial side of the house and the creative side of the house. And I think what's happening at

[14:39] Stern, I think all of the passion is on the creative side of the house. I think George Gomez has it.

[14:45] I think Jack Danger has it. I think Keith Elwin has it. I think John Borg has it. I think Brian

[14:50] Eddy has it. And I think where the creativity stops is when you go into the office of the CFO,

[14:57] the chief financial officer. And I don't think the financial guys are going to help out the creative

[15:02] guys over at Stern, especially when they do moves like they just did this week. So they are going

[15:08] to bring back the Black Knight Pimbal machine. It's kind of funny. They're bringing back a Steve

[15:14] Richie game when Steve Richie wants people to buy his new Jersey Jack game. Now look, I don't think

[15:19] there's any demand for more Black Knight machines. And then they're bringing back the Black Knight

[15:25] topper. And this is the main point I want to make. How is it that this topper four years ago was $499?

[15:35] And just four years later, the same topper made in China with the same materials and the same parts.

[15:42] Well, I'm not sure if it's made in China. I'm just guessing it's made in China. The same exact thing,

[15:47] though. How did this topper go up in price? 200% over the last four years. We're not stupid, Stern.

[15:56] You sold this for $500 and it was great value back then. Even back in the day, it wasn't impossible

[16:03] to get one because most people didn't buy Black Knight. Could Stern have charged more for this

[16:08] topper back in the day? Probably. I love the rumor that Stern sold this topper for a loss. Come on,

[16:14] this company has never, ever, ever sold us anything for a loss. It's been the complete opposite. I

[16:21] think people are delusional in this hobby about how much it costs to make a freaking topper. Everybody

[16:28] should go look at the world of like anime action sculptures and see what those things cost. When

[16:33] you look at the level of detail that goes into a pinball topper, it is just not there. Has everybody

[16:40] forgotten a PlayStation 5 is $500. This Black Knight topper is not even worth $500 if you went into a

[16:51] toy store and saw what toys cost for this much money. But we've all been brainwashed. We've been

[16:58] brainwashed by the content shields and by these companies. I mean, people were spending $3,000

[17:05] on a Black Knight topper that probably cost Stern $200 to make. Do you really think Stern was paying

[17:12] to a vendor more than $500 per pop to get these toppers? They could shut me up. I would close

[17:19] my show for a month if Stern Pinball would show us their receipts to their vendor to order this damn

[17:24] thing. So why is this thing now $1,500? Why is it a 200% increase in price? Is that math right? I

[17:31] think it is. I'm not even sure. Why is it $1,000 more right now? Well, we know why because they saw

[17:37] people selling it for $3,000 and they're like, look, we can get so much more for this. But Stern,

[17:42] I'm here to tell you right now, you're destroying the vibe between you and the community. We're not

[17:47] idiots. How many times are you going to fleece us? How many times are you going to screw us over?

[17:52] You're screwing us over with all these new LEs. You're screwing us over by charging us $1,000

[17:58] more for a topper that was $500 just a few years ago. I'm over it. I'm over it. I don't want to

[18:04] support these companies that make these moves. I'm absolutely tired of the greediness and the

[18:10] fleecing of us and the fleecing of our passion. They know we love Pinball and they know we want

[18:15] to buy it and they're treating us like they are drug dealers and they have cocaine and we are

[18:21] addicted to their product. But I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, your life will be better

[18:27] if you avoid the addiction of new in box pinball. If you avoid the addiction of spending much more

[18:32] money for a freaking topper than it was four years ago, is any of this stuff really truly

[18:37] making us happier? Do you really think Seth Davis is going to make this hobby better? Do you really

[18:42] think that's going to be the case? All this is going to do is put more millions of dollars in

[18:47] the pockets of men like him. You know, Gary's already got his tens of millions of dollars. He

[18:51] doesn't need anymore. And now it's become an exercise simply in this. They want to see how much they

[18:58] can abuse us before we say no more. That's it. That's what new in box and this new pricing scheme

[19:05] means to me. How stupid can we be? I mean, stand over Elton John, stand over the Godfather and

[19:12] stand over Toy Story four and then stand over the Wizard of Oz, which was $6,500. Okay. And you tell

[19:19] me that we're getting more for our money that more is going into these machines. And that's just

[19:24] where I'm at. Stern is at a crossroads. They're either going to show us that they care about the

[19:30] community and rethink some of this stuff, or they're going to continue to fleece us and push

[19:35] more people out. All this is going to do is push more people out of the hobby. And it's not even

[19:40] about the money. It's about the principal and the message they're sending that they don't care about

[19:47] us. They think we're so stupid that we're just going to absorb a $1,000 increase on a topper.

[19:54] We're so stupid that we're going to spend $20,000 on a single level James Bond game that basically

[20:00] has no real code in it, no LCD assets. We're going to spend $20,000 on that. We're so stupid that

[20:08] we're going to buy the limited edition of Jurassic Park and feel like we've got the last version of

[20:13] the game. And then they're just going to drop a nicer version on top of that and tank your value.

[20:18] We're so stupid that we're going to spend $25,000 on Elvira 40th only to have a nicer version come

[20:24] out for half the price just a few years later. So you can look in the mirror ladies and gentlemen,

[20:30] and you can ask yourself, am I that dummy that Stern thinks I am? Or am I much smarter than that?

[20:36] And I subscribe to Canada's Pinball podcast and I'm just going to wait this stupid stuff out.

[20:41] I'm going to start to support the boutique companies that are not fleecing us. And I'm going

[20:45] to start to rethink my entire approach to this hobby. And maybe I'm just going to wake up and be happy

[20:52] with the pinball machines I have and not spend all my hard earned money. That's just going to make

[20:57] some fat cats over at Stern Pinball wealthier. And they're not putting more into the games until

[21:02] we say enough is enough. We're not going to spend this much money until we see more innovation,

[21:07] more mechanical magic, more progress. All we're going to do is get less for our money. I'm done

[21:13] with it. I'm done with it. I'm going to go take the family to Disney World. I'm going to do other

[21:18] stuff with my money. The next pinball game I buy is going to be Pulp Fiction LE, which I still think

[21:23] was priced accordingly. And then I'm just going to wait it out. I'm going to wait. Maybe it's back

[21:27] to the future. Maybe it's fifth element. I don't care about Dungeons and Dragons. I don't want a

[21:31] John Wick pinball machine. I don't even care about Pokemon and Jaws. Yeah, it's cool. But I'm not

[21:35] going to spend this much money because we all know if you buy the LE, they're going to drop the 50th

[21:41] anniversary in like a year and then you're going to be screwed. And I'm tired of it. Stop screwing

[21:46] us over. Stern Pinball needs to show us a sign that they care. And I haven't seen it in a while.

[21:51] Everybody happy Monday. I'm riled up. Let's go do some work. Everybody. Thanks for the support.

[21:56] Canida out.
