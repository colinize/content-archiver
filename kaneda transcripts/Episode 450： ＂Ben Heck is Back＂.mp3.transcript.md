[00:00] I'm all to life and I'm a horse don't lie I'm a starting to feel your joy

[00:10] Alright ladies and gentlemen,

[00:12] Kineda's pinball podcast,

[00:14] not many people will join the show but the only man that matters will, Mr. Ben Heck,

[00:19] Ben welcome to the show.

[00:20] I'm the only man that matters.

[00:23] I mean I'm lying, half of my statements are false and that might be one of them.

[00:27] Welcome to the show.

[00:29] Yeah, it's good to be on.

[00:31] Yeah, I don't mind you.

[00:33] You're okay.

[00:34] Thank you, Ben.

[00:35] And you know, look,

[00:36] so we've talked a little bit over the last like few hours and everyone has seen you

[00:42] and your sexy face sitting at a sexy lineup of Rick and Morty machines, but I know

[00:48] and we talked to, I know that you know, Ben wants to let Charlie get this game out into

[00:53] the world is probably going to happen next week.

[00:56] So Ben, you don't want to spoil too much right of people seeing this game for the first

[01:00] time.

[01:01] Well, exactly.

[01:02] I think that should be the story that Charlie tells.

[01:04] I was just kind of, I just happened to be there, you know, so yeah, it's just walking

[01:09] down the street.

[01:10] Oh look, it's spooky pinball.

[01:11] Oh look, there's 20 Rick and Morty's all finished and ready to go.

[01:15] Exactly, exactly.

[01:16] Although seeing that photo, I do need to trim my beard.

[01:18] It's just getting a bit bushy.

[01:19] So I just want to ask you like broad questions that spoil nothing.

[01:23] Not many, but for fans of Rick and Morty, do you think they're going to be happy when

[01:29] they get this game?

[01:30] Yes, the theme integration is really good.

[01:33] And for what I could tell, there is seems to be quite a bit of custom speech, you know,

[01:38] I don't have the show memorized or anything, but it's most of the speech sounded like it

[01:43] was intended just for the game.

[01:45] Right.

[01:46] Aside from the clips from the show, like there's a lot of prompts like shoot the left ramp

[01:49] or do this Morty blah, blah, blah.

[01:51] Yeah, I think that's going to be great because you know, there's so many games where you

[01:54] either don't get custom speech or it's underwhelming.

[01:58] And yeah, this is, I think this is going to be, it's like, it's like the Spider-Man

[02:03] all over again.

[02:04] It's been a while, you know.

[02:05] Well, we haven't really had a lot of games that have had phenomenal callouts, right?

[02:10] I think people are really excited that the show creator is applying, you know, all these

[02:16] custom callouts.

[02:17] Maybe Chuck said something like maybe 100 or 200 custom callouts for the game.

[02:21] So, and you know me, Ben, I don't even want to watch a stream because I want to be surprised

[02:27] when I play the game.

[02:29] Do you ever find it like weird that people want to watch a game they bought being streamed

[02:35] for hours before they actually even play it themselves?

[02:38] Isn't that like spoiling some of the fun of the game?

[02:42] I guess, but I mean, the same thing happens with video games, you know, it's like, you

[02:46] don't watch like Mario Brothers being played before you play it.

[02:49] Oh, on YouTube, that's huge.

[02:51] Like people watching video games or...

[02:53] But before they play them.

[02:55] But I guess the difference right is that if it's an online game like a call a duty fine,

[03:01] like there's nothing to surprise you in it, but...

[03:03] Right.

[03:04] But this game's got a bunch of jokes, right?

[03:07] It's got a bunch of adventures and you...

[03:09] Yeah, I guess that's a good point.

[03:10] I see what you're saying there.

[03:13] So just aesthetically, how did the game look?

[03:15] Was it sexy?

[03:16] Was it a sexy as you?

[03:18] It's really pretty.

[03:20] There's...

[03:21] I don't think I'd seen it before.

[03:22] There's like this time crystal or death crystal or something.

[03:25] I think it's a death crystal.

[03:28] And it's like...

[03:29] I don't know if it's in the photos.

[03:30] It was so funny that she those photos and then everyone's like zooming in and analyzing them.

[03:34] I still say if JFK was shot today and if this is a prudercule was put on YouTube,

[03:40] the murder would have been solved in like three minutes.

[03:42] Right.

[03:43] Especially by the pin-side people who are used to taking grainy, low-res images of stern

[03:48] machines and try to decipher what's in the game.

[03:53] So I was filming something at my desk here earlier today and I actually had to go make

[03:59] and I was like, okay, no bills are visible, no pass codes, unposted are visible, no phone

[04:04] numbers.

[04:05] Like, oh my god, my phone number made it into an episode of the show once and I got

[04:09] so much spam text and calls and I'm not even like a hot chick.

[04:13] And I'm like, oh my god.

[04:14] Oh, yeah, sorry, I'm getting off topic.

[04:17] So talk to us about the...

[04:19] There's a really cool crystal thing.

[04:21] Like lights up.

[04:22] Oh, nice.

[04:23] Yeah, yeah, it's like cast resin so like absorbs the light really well.

[04:27] I mean, this is Scott and E.C. games, of course, the light show is awesome.

[04:30] Right.

[04:31] So the light show is awesome.

[04:32] How's the music?

[04:33] Scott is remixing the Rick and Morty theme.

[04:36] Did it sound amazing?

[04:38] Oh, it was remixed, I didn't realize that.

[04:40] It sounded like, you know, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo.

[04:45] We should just do that for like two hours and then that's the whole podcast.

[04:48] It could be your next music playlist, right?

[04:51] I think we should do it.

[04:53] Okay, sounds awesome.

[04:55] It's fun.

[04:56] We're going to see more of it this week.

[04:57] So games were when you were there, games were going where they end boxes yet because they

[05:01] were definitely packaging up games to go out.

[05:04] I didn't see them going into boxes,

[05:06] but they were definitely getting wrapped up.

[05:08] So I think they said February 1st, which is today,

[05:11] while it's a Saturday.

[05:13] Right.

[05:13] Oh, actually, I believe Spooky does,

[05:16] like they do four day work week.

[05:18] So it's like four days at 10 hours each, I think.

[05:21] So if I had to guess, probably definitely next week,

[05:25] because they were not, while when was they there?

[05:27] Thursday is when I was leaving.

[05:28] Yeah, they were definitely getting them ready to go.

[05:31] I don't think they were going into boxes,

[05:32] but they're definitely going on pallets.

[05:33] Exciting times.

[05:35] Now let me ask you a question, because, you know,

[05:37] I have number 50 coming my way.

[05:39] Okay.

[05:40] And the coin door, I switched my order from purple to black.

[05:46] Which one looks better in your opinion?

[05:48] It's just a completely aesthetic question.

[05:51] Well, the rails, the side rails are purple, right?

[05:53] Yes.

[05:54] I would say purple, then, because it matches better.

[05:57] I switched it back to black, because the artwork

[06:01] has like the spacing, and I just thought the black

[06:04] looked better.

[06:05] So you're saying I should switch back to purple?

[06:07] Well, I'm not saying you should.

[06:08] It was just my, I'm trying to picture my head.

[06:11] But I don't think, did any of them have the,

[06:13] none of them had the right, had all the legs on.

[06:16] So it's like, oh, I haven't seen a full,

[06:19] are there, are there purple legs too?

[06:20] Yes.

[06:22] But yeah, I don't think they even had one with legs on

[06:24] while I was there.

[06:26] You know, I guess I could always order

[06:28] both from Chuck.

[06:30] He'd sell me a purple coin door, right?

[06:33] Yeah, they probably, yeah, they might have one later on.

[06:35] Oh, again, so you got a black coin door, okay?

[06:37] But I could go back.

[06:38] I could switch, okay, so now,

[06:40] from perspective, purple on the front might be a little,

[06:44] it might be too, a bit too much, it might be a bit bright.

[06:47] That's my opinion, we'll see.

[06:49] They're all black.

[06:50] If it's black, it would be less obtrusive with the artwork.

[06:53] Now, the butter cabinets, this is just another

[06:55] just general question, because I ordered the butter cabinet.

[06:58] Were there any there that had butter treatment?

[07:00] How do they butter these things up?

[07:01] Is there like, does it have like a parquet stick

[07:03] that he rubs against the side of the cabinet?

[07:05] What's going on with the butter?

[07:06] Oh, I thought this was common knowledge.

[07:08] The butter cabinet is where they direct print

[07:11] the graphics onto the cabinet itself.

[07:14] The same way they make the play field, right?

[07:16] It's not a decal.

[07:17] Where then they wax the hell out of it, right?

[07:19] It's, but if they spray, they spray clear it.

[07:22] So it's basically, they make the cabinet

[07:25] the same way they make the play field

[07:27] with direct printing and spray clear.

[07:29] Like a car.

[07:30] Did you see where any of them buttered?

[07:31] Can you tell between butter and regular

[07:34] if you're standing next to two machines?

[07:36] Oh, definitely, but I don't remember if there was.

[07:39] I was helping a friend of mine

[07:43] with some other technical stuff, sir.

[07:45] So really, I didn't really look a lot

[07:46] at the games and production.

[07:47] They just had some that were ready to go out

[07:49] and they were testing and I was like,

[07:50] can I play this one?

[07:51] And they're like, yeah, go for it.

[07:52] And then of course, I was like, is that Hilton's?

[07:54] I'm going to take a picture of me.

[07:55] I feel like I'm peeing on it.

[07:56] Yeah, and I heard you got the wrong machine

[07:58] because it wasn't, he gets number two, right?

[08:00] I believe, yeah, it's like he's like,

[08:02] like their first customer or their second customer.

[08:05] So that's his thing.

[08:06] And then he was mad at me because he was like,

[08:08] Ben, you could have just thrown that

[08:10] because I have a station wagon.

[08:11] He's like, you could just throw that

[08:11] and back your car and brought,

[08:13] because Hilton just lives north of me.

[08:15] He's like, you got to brought that back to Madison.

[08:16] And I'm like, oh, yeah, I guess I could have, but,

[08:20] oh well.

[08:20] So now I'm probably back on his shit list.

[08:23] We're going to see games this week.

[08:24] We're going to see, you know, one day Hilton and I

[08:27] just need to get together and just talk about Subaru's

[08:30] for an hour.

[08:31] We'd have a good time.

[08:32] We'd have a good time.

[08:33] I have no hard feelings towards the man.

[08:33] He's a good guy and he's really into Pimball

[08:36] and he's going to get one of the first machines

[08:38] which is going to be fun to see his impressions of it.

[08:40] So I guess the other question is, Ben, for you,

[08:44] as someone who was behind spooky Pimball's first game ever

[08:48] with America's most haunted, what was it like

[08:51] seeing the excitement, the energy as a company that's

[08:56] gone from struggling to sell just a few hundred games

[08:59] to selling out 750 and four hours.

[09:03] And I'm sure the, what was it like just seeing, you know,

[09:06] how far this company's come in over the past few years?

[09:10] It's, well, I have mixed feelings on it.

[09:13] I mean, I have to be honest because, you know, I kind of

[09:15] got away from them, although I've been talking to him more

[09:18] lately.

[09:19] You know, because my game is, it still exists.

[09:22] It's just been on hold.

[09:23] So I do, I do feel a little bittersweet about that.

[09:25] Like I kind of feel like left out, you know?

[09:28] So that, that parts a bit tough for me.

[09:30] But, you know, aside from that, it is pretty remarkable.

[09:34] It's, it's definitely is like one of those like American

[09:38] success stories, you know, like the American dream

[09:41] or whatever.

[09:42] And obviously it's, maybe it's not as easy as it used to be,

[09:45] but it can still be done, but you have to work really,

[09:48] really hard.

[09:49] So yeah, over at Spooky, obviously they're really excited

[09:53] about, I mean, I was, when I saw the hype, I wasn't surprised

[09:56] at all that it sold out of one day.

[09:57] You could tell it was going to.

[09:59] Um, but you know, it's always like, you know, hopeful, hope

[10:03] for the best, expect the worst.

[10:04] And, but so yeah, everyone's really excited, but also they're

[10:08] very, very busy trying to get all the games to everyone.

[10:10] Yeah, I actually think they're going to get them out faster

[10:13] than 18 months.

[10:14] That's my guess.

[10:15] No, Ben, is there still hope for your game one day?

[10:19] Oh, yeah, yeah, it's still, it might be on a back burner,

[10:22] but I think it's still at least near the stove.

[10:25] And would you like it to be a spooky game one day?

[10:32] I think it would still be involved with spooky, yes.

[10:37] But, you know, but one of those things where I'd like,

[10:39] I'd like to see it made.

[10:41] I think it shoots really well.

[10:42] It's got some cool stuff.

[10:44] Although one or two of the things that were in it, there are

[10:48] some things I've seen in newer games, which is like, oh, yeah,

[10:51] I was thinking about doing that.

[10:52] And, you know, they just kind of get made anyway.

[10:54] You're like, oh man, like I was going to put a big plastic

[10:58] artichoke in the middle of my machine.

[11:00] And they just jaws that with jaws that don't move.

[11:05] Yeah, and they just did it with stranger things.

[11:06] Like, what am I going to do?

[11:08] Like, yeah, I know.

[11:09] I know.

[11:10] I thought I was going to be the first person to have an artichoke

[11:12] of a vagina.

[11:13] Oh man.

[11:14] A friend that looks like a vagina.

[11:16] For the kids who listen to this show, that's just a vegetable

[11:21] that you will probably consume one day.

[11:23] Anyway, so, okay, so let's talk.

[11:26] You get your babies kids right now.

[11:28] Okay, so Rick and Morty, it's going to be review,

[11:33] discuss, pull the part.

[11:35] Ben, do you think what's going to happen when people finally

[11:37] see it?

[11:38] You think there's going to be a little bit of, you know,

[11:40] the hype is so big right now, right?

[11:42] There's so much like positivity around this game.

[11:45] Once people actually see it and play it,

[11:50] do you think there's going to be a little bit of like,

[11:51] it's still a pimo machine, right?

[11:54] I think we're living in a little bit of like this

[11:56] godlike state with this game.

[11:58] We'll people.

[11:59] Yeah, there is an amazing amount of euphoria

[12:02] about this game.

[12:03] I mean, if you look at, like, if you go on the inside,

[12:05] if you look at it versus stranger things, it's,

[12:07] yeah, it's like a rock and house party versus somebody

[12:10] in their basement drinking alone.

[12:12] It's, it's, it's, it's, you know, you know,

[12:14] like you did the excitement level is just completely different.

[12:17] And I think that really worked well in spooky's favor.

[12:19] And like, I think, I don't know if Stern was trying to beat

[12:23] them out or if, I think let's spooky what is trying to like,

[12:27] you know, get before stranger things,

[12:28] but if you look at stranger things,

[12:29] it doesn't seem like people really give a shit.

[12:31] Yeah, let's talk about that because it is kind of amazing.

[12:33] It is like this David versus Goliath moment, right?

[12:38] In which this tiny company from Benton, Wisconsin, who,

[12:43] you know, Stern just doesn't even like,

[12:44] probably consider any competition comes out with a theme.

[12:49] Yeah, I think I think they do now.

[12:51] Well, but think about like, so in Stern's mind,

[12:55] we've got Brian Eddie, who's the designer of some

[12:58] of the most celebrated games ever.

[12:59] We've got one of your, yeah, we'll talk about that.

[13:02] Stranger things.

[13:04] And we're gonna like, you know, Stern try to come out

[13:06] with this like chess beating moment in which the game was

[13:10] announced revealed shipping on location and available to buy

[13:14] in one day.

[13:15] The only problem with their big reveal was that

[13:18] Canada spoiled it and launched the video two or three days

[13:21] before they were ready for it.

[13:23] But, and then everyone was just like, eh, you know,

[13:27] there just wasn't much excitement.

[13:29] And then Rick and Morty over there in, in, in spooky land,

[13:33] had everyone super excited, they launched it perfectly,

[13:38] they sold out immediately.

[13:40] What, what was it like then?

[13:41] Like when you were watching those two launches,

[13:43] like where do you think Stern dropped the ball

[13:45] with Stranger Things?

[13:46] Is it just a crappy game that everyone's trying to convince

[13:48] themselves they want to like?

[13:51] I haven't played it yet.

[13:52] I know Hilton has it downtown.

[13:54] Maybe, I don't know, maybe I could go there tonight.

[13:55] What is he thinking about?

[13:56] What does he think of it?

[13:57] Have you talked to him about it?

[13:58] Oh, I can't remember if we have talked about that.

[14:02] But the thing, I don't go slightly off topic,

[14:05] but I know when Hilton gets his Rick and Morty,

[14:06] I'm sure he'll immediately put it on location.

[14:08] Because, you know, as I said before,

[14:11] like I think it's like a slam dunk theme for millennials

[14:13] who are actually the people at bars.

[14:16] But regarding Stranger Things, it seems, well, Rick and Morty,

[14:18] it seems like they did a really good job.

[14:20] I mean, they kept it hidden for,

[14:23] they did a very good job of keeping it a secret.

[14:25] And I think, well, Charlie as mentioned,

[14:27] is like someone, someone who found like a trademark,

[14:30] you know, a registered trademark for Pimball Machine, right?

[14:33] So I think that's how it leaked.

[14:35] And nobody thought Spooky would be the company though.

[14:38] Correct, I think they thought the license was too big.

[14:42] But even then, I know Charlie was a little upset

[14:44] that that leaked, but that's not so bad

[14:45] because, you know, that's public record.

[14:47] Anyone can search that.

[14:49] It's just, do they bother, you know what I mean?

[14:51] But again, people online, they'll do anything.

[14:55] So it was like a complete surprise.

[14:57] And then people were like, oh, somebody's making this pin.

[15:00] And everyone's like, oh, well, it's probably going to be stern, right?

[15:03] Now, Grant had stern probably turned it down.

[15:06] I think I've made the analogy is, you know,

[15:10] a license is a hot chicken at a bar

[15:12] and you only take her home if Tom Brady says no, right?

[15:16] And so I'm sure now they're kicking themselves.

[15:20] But I think about it.

[15:21] It's a bunch of like 70 year old men.

[15:23] They don't care about Rick and Morty.

[15:24] Don't think about Rick and Morty.

[15:26] Or at least the people in charge of the designers.

[15:28] I'm sure all the programmers who are, you know,

[15:30] actually a Muslim are kind of young at stern.

[15:34] But they're probably not, they're probably not making the decisions.

[15:36] I think everyone's happy stern didn't make Rick and Morty.

[15:40] I think they are.

[15:41] I don't think you get the same impact

[15:45] if stern's like, we're making this game

[15:47] because let's be honest, half of this is Rick and Morty.

[15:51] Half of this is Scott Dinesy, you know?

[15:54] Pepper in some goodwill

[15:56] where people love supporting a small company like spooky.

[16:00] Yeah, definitely.

[16:02] And, you know, a lot of, I don't know how much of,

[16:06] well, that's kind of a different subject.

[16:08] I don't even know what you, I wait, wait, you just says,

[16:10] you don't even say anything.

[16:11] Like what, yeah.

[16:12] What you're gonna say.

[16:14] I'm just thinking, you know,

[16:15] and if you think about something like spooky,

[16:17] the money is reinvested in the community

[16:19] and a lot of the employees.

[16:21] And, you know, it's kind of like Amazon,

[16:23] you know how they say Amazon doesn't pay taxes

[16:25] because Amazon doesn't make any profit

[16:27] because they reinvest every dime they make.

[16:30] Right, and it's also this,

[16:31] they're using their profits to like,

[16:34] employ people in expanding money.

[16:35] I think that is the same thing with spooky,

[16:37] you know, it's a small town thing,

[16:39] but the people who benefit from it

[16:41] are all the people that are there.

[16:42] It's not like a co-op per se,

[16:44] but you know, it seems a lot more like,

[16:46] down to earth than middle class, if you know what I mean.

[16:49] I'm saying.

[16:50] And to add to that, I would say this,

[16:51] and then you know, you know, this show,

[16:53] I don't hold back.

[16:54] When you buy stirons at these inflated prices

[16:58] considering what their bomb is,

[17:00] you're making fat cat investors who nobody even knows who they are.

[17:04] Nobody knows who those guys are

[17:06] who are actually in control of Stern Pimball

[17:08] who are making the decisions to make these games cheaper

[17:11] but charge you more money.

[17:13] That's who, you're making those guys richer

[17:15] and they're multi-millionaires.

[17:17] When you...

[17:18] I'm sure those angels have made their money back

[17:19] and then some...

[17:20] And then they're...

[17:21] They're spending years.

[17:22] They're laughing all the way to the bank.

[17:25] The fact that Stern can sell machines over and over again

[17:29] for $9,000 at like a $3,000 bomb.

[17:32] It's like no matter how many times I say that,

[17:35] you still have all these sternipologists saying,

[17:37] like, well, it looks good with the power to code at armor.

[17:40] Like, there's nothing in the game anyway.

[17:43] Yeah, if you look at Star Trek LE was an awesome LE.

[17:47] Right, they tried...

[17:48] Nowadays, nowadays, you don't...

[17:50] You'll never get that.

[17:51] You don't even try.

[17:52] They don't even try.

[17:54] Why would they?

[17:55] People throw money at them no matter what.

[17:57] It's ridiculous.

[17:58] Oh, bye, bye, bye.

[17:59] Okay.

[17:59] So the same thing happened with Apple.

[18:01] I mean, it's like, let's see how much money

[18:03] we can ring from our customers.

[18:05] And Apple did actually find the ceiling

[18:07] and I think Stern will too eventually.

[18:08] But it seems like they haven't found it yet.

[18:11] Yeah, yeah.

[18:12] So, stranger things let's talk about it

[18:14] because like, Brian...

[18:15] I also played Alvira.

[18:17] Charlie has one.

[18:18] Yeah, we're gonna talk about that.

[18:20] But I wanna go...

[18:21] I would say like, Alvira's already coming.

[18:23] Gone.

[18:24] We'll talk a little bit about it later.

[18:25] But stranger things.

[18:27] Are you a fan of the show?

[18:29] Yeah, I watched the show.

[18:30] I would say...

[18:32] I think it's gone down in quality.

[18:35] Like, I did not really care for the last season that much.

[18:37] I thought it was kind of stupid.

[18:38] I love season three.

[18:40] Never ending story.

[18:41] And it's amazing.

[18:42] Come on.

[18:43] Yes.

[18:44] Come on.

[18:45] Whatever.

[18:46] I still watched it.

[18:47] I'm obviously aware of the show.

[18:49] I think it's different.

[18:51] Will you cuddle up next to a friend?

[18:55] Because I was.

[18:56] Like when Brendan was watching it.

[18:57] It's a little different.

[18:58] It's a little different.

[18:59] It's a little different what you're snuggling.

[19:02] I did like the reveal where Dustin actually did.

[19:07] Get a girlfriend at camp.

[19:09] That was a good subvert.

[19:10] It subverted your expectations.

[19:12] Right.

[19:13] So Brian Eddie, 20 years.

[19:16] 20 years.

[19:17] He's, you know, he comes back to Pimble.

[19:20] Do you consider this return worthwhile or making an impact

[19:25] after all of that time?

[19:26] And this guy did medieval madness attack from Mars.

[19:29] The shadow...

[19:32] That's...

[19:33] Stranger things.

[19:34] What do you think?

[19:38] I had an attack from Mars.

[19:40] It's probably still my favorite game.

[19:41] And I loved it.

[19:43] But...

[19:45] Yeah.

[19:47] I'll just say it.

[19:48] I mean, you have attack from Mars, right?

[19:50] Medieval madness is just attack from Mars

[19:52] with a different setting and better max.

[19:56] It lay out wise.

[19:58] It's almost the same game if you think about it.

[20:02] And then 20 years passes and then you have the Stranger things,

[20:06] which I haven't played it, but it seems like people are

[20:09] not super overwhelmed with it.

[20:13] I don't know.

[20:14] Just...

[20:15] Obviously, he's made some amazing games.

[20:18] But...

[20:19] God, I hate to...

[20:20] I mean, I don't even know Brian Eddie.

[20:22] I've never met him.

[20:23] And I don't want to get kicked in nuts if he's had a show.

[20:26] But I think a lot of what made those two games great back

[20:29] in the 90s was the writing.

[20:31] You know, they had like medieval madness

[20:32] had like second city writers working on,

[20:35] like Tina Fey as a voice.

[20:36] Obviously, it shoots great.

[20:38] It's got great max.

[20:40] But a lot of it was the other parts of the package.

[20:43] You know what I'm saying?

[20:44] The personality of the games were phenomenal.

[20:48] The humor is great.

[20:49] The voices are great.

[20:50] The mechs are...

[20:51] I mean, the castle's awesome.

[20:52] The castle's satisfying.

[20:53] And the Demogorgon that just...

[20:55] Does it even move?

[20:57] It's a terrible shot.

[20:59] No one...

[21:00] I mean, it's amazing when you put a center toy in which even the

[21:03] tournament players are like just avoided.

[21:07] It reminds me of a rigged carnival game

[21:09] where the is only like a millimeter wider than the ball.

[21:14] Right?

[21:15] So you can conceivably make it, but you probably won't.

[21:19] Right.

[21:20] And Ben, you're a guy who hacks stuff up.

[21:24] That thinks about innovative things to put into games.

[21:28] The projector has been a big topic of discussion.

[21:33] What are your thoughts on this sort of projection mapping,

[21:37] equally a better pinball experience?

[21:40] Well, I had discussed projection mapping in pinball with my friends

[21:44] like years ago.

[21:46] Because it is a really cool idea.

[21:50] And I like the idea of them like painting targets.

[21:53] So the target could say something different.

[21:56] I think that's awesome.

[21:57] I think they paint the ramp so that I don't think it shows up super great.

[22:01] But the thing is if you're a Disney world and they're like lighting up the castle

[22:06] thing, you know, first of all, they're doing it at night.

[22:10] Secondly, Disney world is completely controlled so they can make everything

[22:13] else dimmer.

[22:15] And thirdly, they're hitting that thing with enough light power to run a small city.

[22:21] And versus what I assume is probably like a LCD

[22:26] Pico projector hidden under the apron in stranger things.

[22:31] Have you seen any, have you seen the streams with the projector?

[22:35] I don't think I have.

[22:36] I've seen pictures.

[22:37] It seems like if in like, it seems like it works okay as long as it's not

[22:41] soup too bright in your room.

[22:44] Yeah, I mean, the projector works fine.

[22:47] I mean, I've seen it.

[22:49] It's, I think where the big debate lies is, is this actually adding to the

[22:55] enjoyment level and it's nothing physical, right?

[22:59] It's, it's, it's kind of strange, you know, Brian Eddie interviews will say

[23:03] that he was trying to create the atmosphere of different moments and

[23:07] stranger things using a projector.

[23:09] And I look at it like, where's the physical, where are the physical elements of

[23:15] the stranger things world in this game?

[23:17] And they're just not there.

[23:18] And then, and just to have that big plastic already choke, I'm saying that for

[23:22] the kids who are whose parents have probably already pulled them away from this

[23:25] episode, it's just not satisfying.

[23:28] I don't think there's enough creatively physically in the game.

[23:32] And I think that's why people are, are sort of like already down and out on it.

[23:36] And then, and then Ben, my favorite is this, it'll be saved by code.

[23:40] Code will save the day.

[23:42] What do you think about that?

[23:43] Is that true of every, can, can code always save the day regardless of design?

[23:48] Well, when I was at Spooky, I played like the latest code of Al Scooper,

[23:54] which I don't think has been released yet.

[23:56] And, you know, that's a game with some tight shots.

[23:58] I think, you know, obviously it's been out in the wild.

[24:00] So, you know, I definitely feel the same way about it that it's fairly tight game,

[24:05] but they've done so much and they haven't even put all the stuff in the game yet.

[24:09] There's like other aspects they haven't even included yet.

[24:11] With the audio video presentation, like since the last time I played it,

[24:14] which I think was one of Hilton's, like, I don't know, six or seven months ago,

[24:19] it was amazing.

[24:20] I'm like, oh my god, this is so immersive, right?

[24:23] So I think it can definitely, it can definitely help.

[24:26] You know, I don't know if it can, well, I'm walking dead, was like that.

[24:29] Like, nobody cared about it, but then the code became amazing.

[24:32] Same thing with Metallica.

[24:33] Everyone forgets Metallica.

[24:34] Everyone hated Metallica for the first year until the code was further along.

[24:40] Aren't those two Lyman Sheets games, right?

[24:42] I mean, they are.

[24:43] Yeah.

[24:44] And Lyman made Batman great and he will make Elvira great as well.

[24:49] I mean, no one's ever counting out a Lyman game, but for stranger things.

[24:56] If some other company really wanted to Torpedo Stern,

[24:59] they would just keep writing zeros on the end of a check,

[25:02] tell like, just pull Lyman away.

[25:05] I've never understood that.

[25:07] Like, if you're Robert Mueller or you're Jersey Jack,

[25:11] if there's one guy you're going to go get first, it's Lyman.

[25:16] Jack did try to hire him.

[25:17] Jack did try to hire him way back in the day.

[25:19] What happened?

[25:20] He didn't offer enough?

[25:22] Well, I remember I was at, I think it was, it was gaming classic 2011.

[25:26] And it was at the after party and Jack was talking and Lyman was there.

[25:31] And I want to say Lyman just splirts out.

[25:34] Sorry, I told you know, Jack in front of everybody.

[25:38] So I think, you know, if I had to guess, Lyman is probably thinking, okay,

[25:47] I know Stern is going to be around.

[25:49] Like, you know, I could go to Texas and, you know, get a lot of money,

[25:51] but what if they, what if they're no longer there in two years?

[25:54] You know, he's probably thinking about the long term.

[25:58] I don't, I don't know him.

[25:59] I'm just, I'm just assuming why would I'm sure, I'm sure Robert has, you know,

[26:04] tried to dangle a bunch of money in front of his face.

[26:07] But well, and, and for Lyman, it's like the same thing for artist.

[26:12] If you want to be constantly busy, there's only one company in town to go work for.

[26:21] Stern.

[26:22] Yep.

[26:23] You're going to see your art on more games.

[26:25] You're going to have more games to code.

[26:26] You're not going to be stuck.

[26:27] And, you know, like, let's, let's type authentically say Lyman Sheets joins Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[26:32] Say he's there with Kiefer, right?

[26:35] Okay.

[26:36] So what, what is he working on right now?

[26:38] If, you know, you'd be stuck because they don't make four to five games a year.

[26:42] They make one game every two years.

[26:46] Yeah, exactly.

[26:46] So they, maybe they wouldn't have enough to work on or they wouldn't have the output that they do before.

[26:52] So maybe Lyman's like, well, you know, if I, yeah, I can at least make one game every two years at Stern

[27:00] versus someplace elsewhere, who knows how often I'll get a game out.

[27:03] So that's definitely a part of it.

[27:05] Yeah.

[27:05] Right.

[27:06] Yeah.

[27:07] No, and it's, you know, I've always said this, you know, I said, I said it on my last episode.

[27:11] The reason why we'll never get the Holy Grail is people want Lyman Sheets to code a Jersey Jack game.

[27:20] It's like that, to me, that is like, that's the perfect machine.

[27:23] And it's just never going to happen.

[27:25] So, you know, stranger things, Ben, do you think stranger things can recapture the hot any hype?

[27:33] Can you, or do you think it's kind of like a kind of fumbled on launch?

[27:37] And now it's just always going to be relegated to being looked at as like another guardians or monsters or Erosmith,

[27:46] you know, a game that's just a B level game that we'll forget about.

[27:50] It does seem like, you know, what do they say in Lyman we trust?

[27:55] So, you know, if a Lyman game comes out, you know, it will eventually, even if it's kind of thin at first,

[28:02] it will always be made great.

[28:04] And I don't think people have the same confidence as with other games.

[28:07] And the reason they don't have confidence is because it doesn't really happen that often.

[28:10] Yeah.

[28:12] I mean, I don't know.

[28:13] I mean, stranger things is a really, obviously it's a really hot property.

[28:17] I don't know if it's necessarily the best fit for pinball.

[28:20] I think we talked about that before.

[28:21] Remember, like, you know, how string, Rick and Morty is a much better pinball theme than stranger things,

[28:27] even if stranger things is more popular.

[28:29] I don't think it's a good theme for pinball.

[28:31] And when I play the pinball machine, that's where I think they got a little stuck

[28:36] and had to tell the story and bring it to life because there's so much more to the show

[28:42] than just battling the demigorgan and it's not like a negative dark show.

[28:47] It gets darker throughout, of course, you know, but it's just three, you know,

[28:52] you're only doing two seasons of a three season show.

[28:55] There's not going to be any more put into it.

[28:57] And it's not in a weird way, the charm and the personality and the fun of the show.

[29:05] I don't find it anywhere in the pinball machine.

[29:08] And the call out they got from the actor who plays hopper

[29:11] are so bad, like some of the worst I've ever heard in pinball versus Rick and Morty.

[29:16] It's a good thing.

[29:17] Hellboy, bomb, they might not have even gotten that.

[29:23] So, Ben, are you going to T-P-F?

[29:26] I am not.

[29:27] I can't really justify it.

[29:29] But I'm going to M-G-C mid-bus gaming classic.

[29:31] Okay.

[29:33] So, are you going to T-P-F?

[29:34] So, you know, I don't know.

[29:35] Do you think I'm going to win a third Twippy?

[29:37] Should I book a plane ticket?

[29:39] Did you vote?

[29:41] I did not actually.

[29:43] Why not?

[29:48] I don't like Hillary or Trump.

[29:51] Sorry.

[29:53] You know, is it too late to vote?

[29:54] Yeah, it has to have like yesterday.

[29:57] Oh, I'm sorry.

[29:58] I haven't really busy last couple of weeks.

[30:00] I like redid my kitchen, then I, you know, went down in her ass.

[30:03] Charlie.

[30:03] Right.

[30:04] You know, let's talk deep root because they're going to show the world.

[30:10] Allegedly.

[30:11] Allegedly.

[30:12] What do you think?

[30:13] Do you think, I mean, look, we don't know much.

[30:15] We've saw the Razer prototype.

[30:16] I don't think they're going to have like five games there.

[30:19] Should they ever, you know, looking back on it now,

[30:23] why did they ever bring the Razer prototype to that show?

[30:26] Like, what good do that do?

[30:28] I mean, Houston show?

[30:29] Yeah, what good do that?

[30:31] I think about it now.

[30:32] Like, why?

[30:33] Well, they were like, they were like really late on all the promises.

[30:36] They probably had to show something.

[30:38] But why?

[30:39] Why show it not in the cabinet, not in the final package, not find like, I just

[30:46] now when they pulled the curtain off the thing,

[30:49] what's going to feel surprising?

[30:52] I don't know.

[30:53] I don't know why.

[30:54] Well, I'm sure about Houston is somewhat close for them.

[30:57] You know, actually, it's probably actually further than Dallas from San Antonio.

[31:02] I don't know.

[31:02] Maybe they thought they had to show something.

[31:03] They're.

[31:04] Maybe there's investor pressure.

[31:08] I mean, they are going, I mean, apparently they have insane burn down there.

[31:12] And what are they looking at?

[31:13] Like at least a year late from their original projection?

[31:17] I mean, that, I mean, I know they're pretty boisterous, but I would think that would make

[31:20] people nervous.

[31:21] Yeah, the only conclusion that you come do is that I think they had to do it

[31:26] to keep the internal morale going because that's probably it.

[31:33] Yeah, we got to get something where everyone's starting to lose like faith in this thing.

[31:37] So do you think they're going to do what they promised?

[31:45] What is what I'll go on in the list of things.

[31:48] Number one, will they be able to make a play field that will not crater or dimple ever?

[31:55] Not if it's made out of wood.

[31:57] Okay.

[31:58] Number two, here's the thing people don't understand.

[32:01] I want to say something first, right?

[32:03] So as I mentioned, I've been doing like Homer modeling, right?

[32:06] Yeah.

[32:07] And wood is different now, right?

[32:11] There are so many goddamn people on the earth, even compared to like 50 years ago,

[32:14] like when my house here was built.

[32:16] Like you go by a two by four and you compare it to a two by four and an old house and there's

[32:19] there's more rings in the two by four.

[32:21] Like now they grow trees as fast as possible so they can cut them down as fast as possible

[32:26] to build homes as fast as possible because there's seven billion people, right?

[32:30] So you know, when they talk about old growth wood, right?

[32:34] They that doesn't that doesn't happen anymore.

[32:37] So I know it sounds kind of crazy, but wood is kind of crappier than it used to be.

[32:42] So it's going to be a worse process and also, you know, the companies, well some companies,

[32:47] I'll let you guess which are just trying to make it as cheap as humanly possible.

[32:50] Those things like that.

[32:51] Dirt and bulk.

[32:55] So how would they make a dimple, well they're not going to make a sledgehammer?

[32:57] Yeah, no, no, no.

[32:58] I think it's going to have a, I think it's going to have a plastic overlay.

[33:03] That's reverse printing.

[33:05] Well, like, one day get scratched up.

[33:07] I mean, ramps get scratched up.

[33:08] Yeah, of course.

[33:09] I had it on my Batman, but I'll tell you this.

[33:12] Never dimples, never creators.

[33:15] Plays fast on every game.

[33:20] What was that Spanish company that made like a card game like 10 years ago?

[33:24] Do you remember that?

[33:25] What was that called?

[33:27] They made a card, a card theme to pinball machine.

[33:32] So I don't know what it was.

[33:33] I mean, I think we're like Captain Nemo.

[33:35] Is that what we thought?

[33:36] No, it's not obvious.

[33:38] People probably would know what it was.

[33:39] It was something in Europe.

[33:40] I want to say it was Spain and they made like a run of like,

[33:42] it was kind of like an EM style game.

[33:44] Anyway, that's what they did.

[33:46] They, um, I don't know if the whole play field was plastic.

[33:49] Team pinball, the mafia was reverse printed.

[33:52] They sold eight, they sold eight games.

[33:55] Eight.

[33:55] I'm just saying it has been done before.

[33:58] Right.

[33:58] The thing is a big sheet of plastic is actually

[34:01] pretty expensive.

[34:02] Plastic is not cheap.

[34:04] Right.

[34:04] No, it else is not cheap pinball machines.

[34:08] Exactly.

[34:08] So you could totally do it.

[34:10] So I'd be curious to see what they do.

[34:12] I've, what did they have a miracle play field in that

[34:15] Raza prototype?

[34:16] Yeah, the whole thing made no sense to me.

[34:19] We're going to do things differently.

[34:20] Here's the manufacturer who made the prototype.

[34:23] Who's everyone hates right now.

[34:25] Because Mirko is responsible for all the crappy play fields

[34:28] that plague Jersey Jack.

[34:30] Uh, well, you know, look, March is going to be amazing, right, Ben?

[34:33] Because we're going to see deep root what they've got.

[34:36] We're going to see teenage mute didn't ninja turtles.

[34:38] Do you think that's going to be a popular theme for this, you know,

[34:41] slightly overweight demographic?

[34:44] Well, it definitely, I think about it.

[34:46] And everyone's like, oh, well, they said the same thing about Metallica.

[34:49] Who wants a pinball machine about the band that sued Napster?

[34:53] And then they saw the artwork.

[34:55] And yeah, but it's like, it's cool for grown men.

[34:58] Is ninja turtles cool for grown men?

[35:02] No, not really, but you know, it's nostalgic.

[35:05] I mean, I thought I like, I like watched,

[35:07] well, at least the first two movies in theaters.

[35:10] They still hold up.

[35:11] Well, the first one holds up.

[35:12] But I think the thing is if Jeremy, well, I mean, when Jeremy,

[35:16] what if he does like kind of like a cool bad ass art style like they said,

[35:19] they're going to go towards the art.

[35:20] Yeah, the art's going to be insane.

[35:22] It's going to be, it's going to be his best art package.

[35:25] So I mean, I, I, I, I think I'm going to go old school because it was a black and white comic for no, no, no, no.

[35:32] What if I can't get a black and white?

[35:33] Not going to be black.

[35:35] What if they had a black and white version of it?

[35:37] Like that would be the limited edition.

[35:39] Oh, wait, no, people hated the black and white monsters, so they won't.

[35:42] No, first of all, the black and white monsters, that looked awesome.

[35:45] First of all, that look black and white monsters was originally supposed to be the Ellie.

[35:51] Stern got a little cute and decided to make it the premium.

[35:55] And then screwed over everyone who bought the Ellie, who thought they had the only colored version of the lower play field game.

[36:03] And then made a premium colored Stern really screws over people.

[36:08] They really do.

[36:09] I mean, I think, I think with the case of that, that I mean, there's a lot of people out there that will not watch black and white movies.

[36:16] They won't watch movies with subtitles.

[36:18] I know that sounds crazy, but there are, there are a lot of people who did not like the fact that was black and white.

[36:23] I thought it looks stunning, but that's why you make it the Ellie.

[36:27] Like make it special, only make 500.

[36:30] And how about the whole like, oh, we're making 500 of them.

[36:33] Oh, people are excited.

[36:34] We're making 600.

[36:36] And now, here's a sad part.

[36:39] I was reading a guy's pin side thread.

[36:41] He's selling a monster's Ellie Ben.

[36:44] He's got it listed for like 7,300.

[36:46] Nobody wants it.

[36:48] And he's like, I can't even like, I don't even know what to price this thing at.

[36:52] Because nobody wants it.

[36:54] It's much of an old man theme, right?

[36:57] I mean, I watched the reruns when I was a kid, but I don't give a flying crap about it now.

[37:01] I edited myself there for you.

[37:03] No, and the code is horrible.

[37:05] They left, they left the show out of the code.

[37:09] It's like, all the whole point of the game is for jackpots and like, like zaps.

[37:13] Like, they've only played it.

[37:15] I played the one at Sunshine a couple of times.

[37:17] I think that's the only time I've played it.

[37:19] All right, so let me, let me ask you about another theme.

[37:22] And I know this is the one you've been waiting your whole life for.

[37:24] You ready?

[37:25] What?

[37:26] Hot wheels.

[37:27] Give it to me.

[37:30] And do you think it's going to be Hot Wheels?

[37:32] Because they have not, they've not come out.

[37:34] And if it wasn't Hot Wheels,

[37:36] wouldn't they be like, what's Kineeta talking about?

[37:38] Did I spoil it for them?

[37:41] I don't know what it is, but I mean, okay,

[37:43] well, my gut reaction to Hot Wheels is Hot Wheels is what 10-year-old boys play,

[37:47] well, no more like five-year-old boys play with.

[37:50] Because they like cars, but they don't have a car.

[37:53] Your pinball demographic is you and I's age and we have cars, right?

[37:58] The wish, like you have like, what a Dodge demon is you like to know everyone?

[38:03] It's a really, you know, it's a real life car.

[38:06] It's a real life Hot Wheels.

[38:07] Like, I don't push my car around anymore.

[38:11] Right, right.

[38:11] So that wish of, oh, look, I'm doing loops with a car.

[38:17] Does that really have, does that mean anything to like middle-aged men?

[38:21] No.

[38:22] And, but if I'm like a super warrior or if I'm in a castle or, you know,

[38:28] something like that, that's still a wish.

[38:30] So do you think it's going to flop as a theme?

[38:33] I don't think it's a good theme.

[38:35] No, and I'm sure it's something like, I'm sure Mattel was like,

[38:38] oh, you know, we've sold a billion of these cheapo cars.

[38:41] And it's the same thing like, oh,

[38:43] Wheel of Fortune is the top-rated game show on television.

[38:46] It doesn't mean anything if it does not connect with the target demographic, right?

[38:50] Yeah, no, I agree.

[38:51] So what do you think?

[38:52] American Pimball?

[38:53] Why can't they just get their act together?

[38:56] Why is spooky eating their lunch right now?

[38:59] I think spooky understands theme much better than American.

[39:02] Like American, their infrastructure and their build quality,

[39:05] well, not their art, but most everything about them is really top-notch.

[39:11] Like if you look at everything that's in an October Fest for $7,000,

[39:16] that is a hell of a deal, especially compared to Stern.

[39:19] I mean, you know, for $7,000, there's a lot of game in there, right?

[39:23] Right, but how embarrassing is it, right?

[39:25] And you're right, there's a ton of game in there.

[39:27] I'm going to say this right now.

[39:29] Over like a year and a half, they've sold 300 of them in total.

[39:36] And spooky sold 750,

[39:39] rick and mortis in four hours, and people have never played it.

[39:43] As you have said many times,

[39:44] marketing is a set pattern.

[39:46] Mar theme.

[39:47] Market.

[39:48] Well, it's a marketing.

[39:50] How do you market an October Fest Pimball?

[39:53] What?

[39:53] You don't?

[39:54] No, no, no, no, no, no, every brewery if you're lucky.

[39:57] But a marketer, a marketer does something called Market Research

[40:01] and uncovers an insight that nobody wants in October Fest Pimball Machine.

[40:08] Why did Donald give Joe Balls with the green light on that game?

[40:10] It's, it's, it's, it's doubles fault.

[40:12] He let him make it.

[40:14] Again, I think the, you know, spooky might be rag tag.

[40:18] Well, not really, but, but they understand theme.

[40:22] They're like, oh, you know, this is what people want.

[40:24] You know, this is hot.

[40:25] I mean, like Rick and Morty is a very kind of blue sky Pimball to make.

[40:29] And, you know, there's only making 750,

[40:31] but the people who do put it on location, like Hilton,

[40:33] that game will slay on location.

[40:35] Like TNA.

[40:36] And I'm just going to say it.

[40:38] I think Chuck learned the ultimate.

[40:41] Ultimate learning experience with Rick and Morty,

[40:44] where Chuck and Bug and the family over there, they love, you know,

[40:49] those B level spooky films and themes.

[40:53] This is a wake up call.

[40:55] You got to find the thing that has some crossover appeal, right?

[40:59] Rob Zombie doesn't have it.

[41:01] Godzilla would have had it.

[41:03] I really, I'm going to go in a mission to get Stern Pimball to give spooky back.

[41:08] Godzilla.

[41:10] But a lot of these other games, like even Alice Cooper doesn't have it.

[41:13] Like, it's, it's, it's Rick and Morty is the perfect crossover appeal

[41:17] between nerd culture, a little bit of mainstream,

[41:22] and people love it.

[41:24] And, and I think Chuck has learned that.

[41:26] It also, it also appeals to a highly educated above average income,

[41:32] demographic as well.

[41:33] Yeah. Yeah.

[41:33] No, again, if you, if you look at statistics, it, you know, yeah.

[41:37] Yeah, no, someone said to me that I, that I'm just a jerk in New York City,

[41:40] making $100,000 a year who doesn't wear socks.

[41:43] Another podcast or said that about me.

[41:45] Now, I'll tell you, there's what, there's one thing that, out of these two variables,

[41:50] he makes $100,000 a year and he doesn't wear socks.

[41:53] Only one of the, actually make $100,000 a year.

[41:57] Let me tell you, he's a bet.

[41:57] Only one of those variables is correct.

[42:00] And it's the one that has to do with my feet, okay?

[42:03] So, right.

[42:05] So, like, yeah, no, I agree.

[42:07] I agree. Like, it's a smart show.

[42:08] It appeals to, you know, a demographic with a little bit more spending power.

[42:12] So, here's my, here's my worry about American pinball.

[42:15] Is there once again, going to come out with a theme that's dead on arrival?

[42:21] What do you think?

[42:23] I mean, it's better than Octoberfest.

[42:26] What isn't better than Octoberfest?

[42:30] It's the worst, maybe a pinball spot.

[42:33] Lasting bags.

[42:34] But like, in the last 10 years, can we just collectively,

[42:37] is an Octoberfest the worst theme in the last 10 years of pinball?

[42:40] Can you name a worse theme than Octoberfest?

[42:47] Other than America's most, other than America's most honoured.

[42:51] I'm just fucking with you.

[42:51] Oh, wow.

[42:52] Wow.

[42:52] No, I don't, you know, it's the whiskey talk.

[42:57] It's pretty dumb.

[43:00] It's, it's, it sounds like one of those things where

[43:03] you know, someone gets in the pinball and they're like,

[43:05] we should make it NFL pin.

[43:07] Yeah.

[43:07] You know, because there's all these NFL fans and there's,

[43:10] and we can put one in every bar and we can sell one to every stadium.

[43:13] You know, they always think that or we can sell like, what?

[43:17] People love ping pong.

[43:18] People love it.

[43:20] Let's see.

[43:20] Yeah, people love the other fortune.

[43:22] Yeah.

[43:22] And maybe it was like, oh, we could put, we could put an Octoberfest game in every bar.

[43:27] But the thing is, Octoberfest is about drinking, right?

[43:30] So if, again, it goes back to,

[43:34] as the middle age of age, if I want to drive a sports car, I can, right?

[43:37] If I want to drink beer, I can.

[43:39] You know, I don't need a pinball machine or a video game to feed me that fantasy, right?

[43:43] But if I want to crash the car with no repercussions,

[43:45] I have to play Grand Theft Auto, right?

[43:47] Or if I want to slay a drag and I have to play Medieval Madness.

[43:49] So the game needs to give you a wish and take you to a world you can't normally inhabit.

[43:55] And if you're just like, oh, I'm drinking beer, who cares?

[43:59] You can do that.

[44:00] Right.

[44:00] I can go to the store and do that.

[44:02] I don't, I don't need a pinball machine to fulfill that fantasy for me.

[44:05] Right.

[44:05] You know, you know what I found funny too, and to go to another American pinball title was

[44:10] when I reported that a couple shots were a little tight on Rick and Morty,

[44:15] some people were like, oh my god, not another Houdini.

[44:19] It, it'll sink this game.

[44:21] And I just want to say for the record, when people say the reason why people didn't buy

[44:26] Houdini was because of tight shots, that's just people being nice.

[44:31] There are so many other variables on why people didn't buy Houdini.

[44:36] Okay, the shots were almost unmakeable.

[44:39] The art for steampunk art was not that great.

[44:43] The animation of horrendous.

[44:44] I don't understand why people thought the artwork on that game was so great.

[44:48] It was horrendous.

[44:49] I don't like it at all.

[44:50] The rules say it was consistent.

[44:54] It was more consistent than like October Fest, but it wasn't very good.

[44:58] No, and it was worse than the John Papadu Houdini art package.

[45:01] And they should have just gone with that because they own that art package that Matt Andrews

[45:05] did that was amazing.

[45:06] Okay, so look, here's my thing with American pinball.

[45:09] This company in 2020, Ben, it's like, I just feel like they're the company that need it to be like,

[45:17] we got back to the future or we got the Matrix.

[45:20] They need something people want.

[45:22] They need her hands.

[45:23] Hot wheels.

[45:26] See, it's silence.

[45:28] You hear that silence that you and I just did, like we're just like,

[45:32] it's really simple.

[45:33] You go on Pinside, you look at one of the million threads where people talk about original themes,

[45:37] and then they immediately start talking about what license they want.

[45:39] And then you look at that license list and you buy one.

[45:41] That's what Stern does.

[45:43] I mean, who the hell would have thought, oh, let's make an Iron Maiden pinball.

[45:46] But people type that into Pinside like 10,000 times.

[45:50] I'm not kidding.

[45:51] You can search and even before it came out, people were always talking about that as a theme.

[45:55] And lo and behold, it worked great.

[45:57] So why did Stern grab the Godzilla license?

[46:00] Was it just a stick at the spooky?

[46:03] Oh, I'm sure it was.

[46:04] And do you think they're actually going to make a game?

[46:08] Probably not.

[46:10] So Charlie wouldn't agree with this, but I don't think that's the best theme for pinball.

[46:16] Right.

[46:16] I mean, it could translate well to pinball, but I'm not sure.

[46:20] You know what I mean?

[46:21] Like if you do like classic Toeho, I mean, what is the?

[46:25] I agree.

[46:25] Look, I think I think I think Rick and Morty woke Chuck up.

[46:29] And the other part that woke Chuck up is this.

[46:32] Four hours, six million dollars.

[46:36] It's not about making games that you and Bug want.

[46:39] It's about making games that will get you six million dollars in four hours.

[46:47] That's how you stay in business.

[46:50] Well, yes, what I would say, which, Charlie, is that obviously license is

[46:54] are expensive and even worse than that, you have to deal with approvals and everything has to be,

[46:59] you know, checked off and done and triplicate.

[47:02] But that's the price you pay for.

[47:06] It's success insurance.

[47:08] Well, you know, it's like they're expensive.

[47:11] I'm expensive.

[47:12] Great, but they're expensive because you pay more to make six million dollars.

[47:20] It's for hours.

[47:21] That's why you pay a little bit more.

[47:24] And look, Chuck is making on Rick and Morty $9,000 if you option it out.

[47:33] Yeah, I guess.

[47:34] Yeah, that's pretty good.

[47:35] That's pretty good.

[47:37] It's pretty amazing for a city.

[47:39] Like I said, I mean, they're all very elated over there.

[47:43] They just, you know, obviously have a lot of work to get done.

[47:46] But that's a good problem to have as they would say.

[47:49] Yeah, but I've said that to Charlie for a while.

[47:53] I'm like, you know, at some point, you need to spend the money on like a, you know,

[47:59] triple a top tier title.

[48:01] Yeah, even though it'll be painful, you'll have to do a bunch of approvals.

[48:03] Ben, I mean, it's a long shot.

[48:06] He's come a long ways.

[48:07] Like, oh, I need to call Rob Zombie personally and ask him if such and such is okay.

[48:12] It's obviously a lot harder than that now.

[48:14] Do you do you think Brendan marries me?

[48:17] Ben, if I take her to McDonald's,

[48:19] do you think she marries this guy?

[48:20] No, McDonald's.

[48:22] Come on.

[48:22] No, I mean, you're right.

[48:24] Like it's like, same thing in pinball.

[48:26] Just squeeze hard, but the juice is worth it.

[48:29] Absolutely.

[48:30] Absolutely.

[48:31] So let's talk about P3 multi-morphic.

[48:35] Is there a, what's left for for Jerry to show?

[48:39] What do you think?

[48:40] Because he's working on another game that he said is going to show us the potential

[48:44] of this platform after eight years.

[48:48] I think we've seen the potential of the platform.

[48:51] It's the same thing we just talked about.

[48:54] You know, he needs to get a loan for a hundred grand or whatever and get like

[48:58] tron or something.

[48:59] But he doesn't need the money.

[49:01] He's burned through probably ten times that over the last eight years trying to sell this game.

[49:08] Well, the thing is, if you think about him, like you've got spooky using his system,

[49:11] I think America uses it as well.

[49:14] So for the first time in a while, you actually have a decimal interproduction being done

[49:18] with the P-Rock game.

[49:19] So I would think that income would be able to help his production process for his own stuff.

[49:24] But the thing is he keeps making original themes.

[49:27] Nobody cares about original themes.

[49:29] I don't know how many times you have to say that to people.

[49:32] Cosmic, wait, are you telling me that Cosmic Cart Racing doesn't boil your blood?

[49:40] Look at, well, the thing is, look at how many like video game cart racers have come out.

[49:45] Nobody gives a shit unless it's Mario.

[49:47] Or F zero.

[49:48] Or yep.

[49:49] Yep.

[49:50] Or something Nintendo.

[49:51] But see, here's my thing.

[49:53] Why does Jerry, and I've talked to him, he's a nice guy, he's like the nicest guy in Pimble.

[49:59] He's smart as F.

[50:00] Like he's smart as F-U-C-K.

[50:03] How do they not understand the theme part of the equation?

[50:08] What's wrong with these people?

[50:11] Well, I think they're smart, maybe an engineering sense.

[50:15] But it drives you nuts because you know

[50:18] your brain thinks about it in a marketing sense.

[50:21] And I guess their brains just aren't working that way.

[50:23] But you're absolutely right.

[50:25] Well, I was just saying that too.

[50:27] If he had like, Tron 82 as a theme on P3 at $10,000 and it had amazing theme integration,

[50:36] people would be knocking down his door for it.

[50:38] Right, but he's saying this next game of ours.

[50:41] This is going to be the one you want.

[50:42] Now, if it's not based on a license property, he's dead.

[50:46] He's dead.

[50:46] I don't want to like go like bass hunting with Jerry.

[50:50] I don't want to do it.

[50:52] I mean, you look like a TNA obviously is an original theme.

[50:55] But it had something to it.

[50:57] It had a hot, what's the right word?

[51:01] You know, TNA is like the pseudo retro 80s, which is kind of a hot style right now.

[51:08] You see it all over YouTube.

[51:09] I call it cyberpunk.

[51:11] Cyberpunk is where we're at, right?

[51:13] It's the techno sort of futuristic, like nuclear power.

[51:17] Yeah, and you see and you see stranger things.

[51:21] Try to do that.

[51:23] They try to have the TNA style, but they're doing it wrong.

[51:26] It's terrible because stranger things is nostalgic about

[51:31] living in the 80s and the kind of movies you saw in the 80s,

[51:35] whereas the cyberpunk style, as you call it,

[51:38] is more like a futuristic retro version of the 80s.

[51:42] Right.

[51:42] It's a dystopian future.

[51:43] And that's absolutely.

[51:44] That's like neon based dystopian future.

[51:47] And it's like the millennials' impression of a decade that they

[51:51] didn't experience.

[51:52] Right.

[51:52] It's a completely different type of nostalgia.

[51:55] It's what's not really a nostalgia for them,

[51:57] because you have to live through something to be nostalgic for it.

[52:00] Right.

[52:00] So it's like an interpretation of the 80s.

[52:03] And but Stern doesn't understand that.

[52:05] So they just apply those retro 80s styles of stranger things,

[52:08] even though it doesn't really fit the zeitgeist of that license.

[52:13] I couldn't agree more.

[52:14] And the one thing that game is missing,

[52:17] that the show has in spades is the music from the 80s.

[52:21] Oh man.

[52:23] And Ben, how do you not have?

[52:25] Like, that show is so much about the 80s arcade scene

[52:29] and Dungeons and Dragons.

[52:31] How do you not have an actual arcade implemented into the game?

[52:38] Like a scoop in what you go into it and you're playing Pac-Man.

[52:41] What?

[52:42] You can have a video mode on that screen.

[52:44] Yeah.

[52:45] It'd be amazing.

[52:48] I hate, I don't like the game.

[52:49] I don't like the game.

[52:50] I've had a few whiskies on this call.

[52:53] And I haven't played it so I should go play.

[52:55] Yeah, it's all right.

[52:57] So Ben, here's a deal.

[52:59] This has been great.

[53:00] This has been great.

[53:01] I love having you on.

[53:02] So let's talk about that one last game I brought up.

[53:04] So you brought up a Vira.

[53:06] Let's talk about OVira.

[53:07] Yeah.

[53:07] Talk to you.

[53:08] I know.

[53:09] It has gone a bit long.

[53:09] So Charlie has one now.

[53:11] He has an Vira Ellie.

[53:13] And so I hadn't played it before.

[53:15] Like I don't know.

[53:16] I haven't been going out to bars lately.

[53:18] At least not the pinball bars.

[53:20] Anyway, so I played it and when I heard about a Vira 3,

[53:24] I'm like, oh god, this is like the ultimate old man theme.

[53:26] You know?

[53:27] Right.

[53:27] Of course, you know, a millennial would call me an old man.

[53:30] You know, because I'm a 44 year old boomer apparently.

[53:33] Because they don't teach kids in school what boomers are.

[53:36] Anyway, so when I played it,

[53:39] when I saw the stream, I'm like, oh, this is,

[53:41] this isn't even an OVira game.

[53:43] It's Mystery Science Theater, the pinball,

[53:45] with an OVira cameo, right?

[53:48] Absolutely.

[53:48] It's all about movie claims.

[53:49] It's making fun of old movies.

[53:51] Well, I think it's, I love Mystery Science Theater, right?

[53:53] So when I played it, I'm like, this is awesome.

[53:57] Like, I really liked it.

[53:58] I didn't think I would.

[53:59] Like, the sound is great.

[54:01] The code seems pretty good.

[54:02] The clips are good.

[54:03] The humor of the writing is actually pretty good for a stern game.

[54:07] I was just really surprised at how much I liked it.

[54:09] I'm like, I kind of want one of these.

[54:11] Even though I couldn't care less about OVira,

[54:14] everything else about the game is really cool.

[54:16] And she's barely in it, actually.

[54:18] She's barely in it.

[54:19] Look, OVira is a really fun game.

[54:22] It's a much better game than Stranger Things.

[54:25] It's, it's the second, it's the second, it's the second.

[54:28] It's the second.

[54:30] Yeah, it's the second best game of the year for a stern next to Jurassic Park.

[54:33] And it's Lyman, so it's going to get even better.

[54:35] And I'll just say this about,

[54:36] here's the whole thing with OVira.

[54:38] It's just like Beatles.

[54:40] Just get the basic game for eight grand

[54:43] and you're getting an amazing game.

[54:45] Once you go into like the $12,000, $15,000 for couch edition,

[54:51] it's stupid.

[54:52] It's, it's the same game.

[54:53] It's the same game.

[54:55] I got, I got such a laugh.

[54:57] All those people on the inside saying,

[54:58] OVira is not about sex.

[55:00] And then they're paying $7,000 for a piece of couch sheet laid on.

[55:03] Right. Mm-hmm.

[55:05] Yeah, mm-hmm.

[55:06] Yeah, sure it isn't.

[55:07] But here's the problem with stern, right?

[55:09] And the cadence.

[55:10] And then I'll let you go, Ben.

[55:11] It's like a game like that comes out.

[55:14] Oh, it's not done yet.

[55:15] Lyman's not complete with it.

[55:17] It's very, you know, high priced.

[55:20] Then we get Stranger Things.

[55:22] And, and people are disappointed in it.

[55:24] And now we're already on to Ninja Turtles.

[55:27] It's like a game comes out in the stern world.

[55:31] And it's so quickly forgotten where Rick and Morty

[55:35] will be the spotlight,

[55:36] where Willy Wonka will be the spotlight for Jersey Jack.

[55:39] You know what?

[55:40] Stern terms are just like transient experiences.

[55:43] It's like just having another fast food dinner.

[55:46] Yeah, that's, that's a really good point.

[55:48] But on the other hand, Stern is orders of magnitude larger of a company,

[55:52] which means they have to keep the line moving.

[55:55] If they release games as slowly as JJP or Spooky, they'd be dead.

[55:58] Right, but that's my whole point is they're making

[56:01] the McDonald's hamburgers of hamburgers.

[56:04] But yet they're charging the Michelin star price for,

[56:10] you know, a filet mignon burger with truffles.

[56:13] What restaurant wouldn't do that if they could get away with it?

[56:16] And why do people let them get away with it?

[56:18] Why do you think?

[56:22] Stern?

[56:23] Yeah, why do people spend these premium prices on Stern games

[56:28] that are clearly still only worth six to five thousand dollars at most?

[56:33] As a PC user, I would ask the same thing about Apple computers.

[56:37] Yeah, no, I know, but why do, but in Pimball,

[56:40] because nobody wants to talk about Apple computers on this podcast.

[56:44] Sorry, is it just because they're available and people are addicted to Pimball?

[56:47] Well, I mean, they definitely, you know, they get the,

[56:49] they get the themes that people want, you know,

[56:51] they get the best themes.

[56:53] And the games always come out exactly when they're scheduled to.

[56:56] There's none, you know, there's none of the delays.

[56:59] Right.

[56:59] And, you know, and you know, they will be supported.

[57:02] So if something breaks, well, aside from the,

[57:04] well, we know why they don't replace Pimball fields,

[57:06] because it's too catastrophic of a thing to replace.

[57:08] But everything else is serviced really well.

[57:11] So, you know, it's very consistent.

[57:12] You know, they have, you know, one of the,

[57:14] or the best programmer in the industry,

[57:16] and they have the best themes.

[57:18] And honestly, like, you know, they have those things,

[57:20] and they, you know, they tend to skimp on other things.

[57:23] Yeah.

[57:24] But I think it is, I agree with Charlie, like,

[57:27] I think I'm going back to the Viro thing.

[57:28] But that Viro game is so freaking weird and niche and crazy.

[57:33] It's insane that Stern made it, but I'm glad they did.

[57:37] Do you think a little bit inside Chuck is like,

[57:40] because that's a spooky theme, right?

[57:42] I mean, is he looked at doing a mystery science theater Pimball machine

[57:46] ages ago?

[57:47] What happened?

[57:47] We were like, talk.

[57:48] I think like everyone involved wanted a game as payment,

[57:54] which doesn't sound like that much now, but back then,

[57:57] it's like, oh, man, we can't afford to give away seven games.

[58:00] Again, I'm talking like that's when they started out.

[58:03] So, like, $45,000 worth of games seem like the end of the world to spooky,

[58:08] which is kind of funny to look, think about now,

[58:10] but that's the way it was.

[58:11] Right.

[58:12] But the thing is, you would have had to,

[58:14] because most of the movies in Viro are public domain movies that we're also on

[58:19] Mystery Science Theater, right?

[58:20] Right.

[58:21] So, I don't care about like some grandma with a lot of makeup on,

[58:24] but I'm like, oh, look, it's, you know,

[58:26] Manos, the hands of fate or the giant true monster or whatever.

[58:31] That's the part I like.

[58:32] So, yeah, I just thought it was really cool.

[58:36] Well, Ben, I appreciate it.

[58:38] You know, we're not even an hour, 58 minutes.

[58:41] Who's winning the Super Bowl tomorrow?

[58:42] Do you watch sports?

[58:43] Who's winning tomorrow?

[58:45] As long as the Patriots don't win, I know they're not playing,

[58:48] but they're going to take it.

[58:50] I think everyone is just glad they're not in the Super Bowl.

[58:53] So, besides the New York Times,

[58:56] Packers almost made it.

[58:59] Wasn't almost.

[58:59] Anyway, Ben, thank you for coming on.

[59:02] I always appreciate it.

[59:03] You've been a great guest of the show.

[59:05] We'll talk to you in the future.

[59:06] And we'll see when people start to get their rick and marities.

[59:09] I think it's going to be in the next week yet.

[59:11] So, yeah, we'll get you back on once we can talk more openly about it.

[59:14] Has that sound?

[59:16] Yeah, once it's on the world.

[59:17] And obviously, I have played it, but yes,

[59:19] I'm going to let spooky control that narrative.

[59:22] So, you're good man.

[59:24] You're good man.

[59:25] Unlike me who gets bastardized by the community,

[59:27] you're good man.

[59:28] I don't think everyone loves me, but yeah, that's all right.

[59:32] I always teed you up to say something nice about Canada.

[59:35] What do you think?

[59:36] Am I okay?

[59:38] Yeah, I mean,

[59:39] sometimes you are, well, everyone online, you know, they tend to, you know,

[59:44] you know, say it.

[59:45] Sometimes say it.

[59:45] Just say it.

[59:46] Make my mom a proud.

[59:48] Tistical, definitely, but I mean, I am too.

[59:51] So, you gotta have that sound.

[59:53] You gotta have an ego to survive in this world.

[59:55] I mean, what's that exactly?

[59:57] Because if you don't, then you just a, a, a dormat for people.

[01:00:01] Right.

[01:00:01] And I'm a good, I'm a good heart.

[01:00:03] We have good hearts.

[01:00:03] I can tell that you have a good heart.

[01:00:05] I can tell it.

[01:00:06] Yes, I don't deliberately try to run over squirrels and I'm driving another road.

[01:00:10] I swear of a little bit.

[01:00:11] Ah, the demon.

[01:00:12] I can go over them at 180 miles an hour.

[01:00:14] All right, Ben, have a great, great weekend.

[01:00:17] Thank you again for joining the show.

[01:00:18] I love these conversations.

[01:00:20] Just thank you again.

[01:00:21] Yeah, no problem.

[01:00:23] Yeah, check she's attention baby like this is perfection.

[01:00:29] No fight.

[01:00:30] No fight.

[01:00:32] No fight.
