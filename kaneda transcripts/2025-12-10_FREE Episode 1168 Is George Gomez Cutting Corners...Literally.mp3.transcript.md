[00:00] There's nothing I could see that would mean more to me than what you ought to mean, all my love.

[00:14] Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera.

[00:18] Ah, good morning everybody.

[00:20] It is 6 o'clock in the morning.

[00:22] The whole family is still sleeping and I just wanted to do the podcast today in response to the great two hour interview

[00:29] that Keri Hardy did with Mr. George Gomez over at Stern.

[00:34] So, you know, there's been a lot of people sharing photos of the new cabinets, how the wood is put together,

[00:41] how the corners don't look like they used to.

[00:44] Sitting through two hours of listening to everything George said about his experience making cabinets over the years,

[00:51] he's made more cabinets over the decades than he's made of pinball machines.

[00:55] He made arcade cabinets for many, many years.

[00:58] I mean, I absolutely trust the man's ability to make a cabinet.

[01:01] But after listening to two hours of George talk about a lot, and we're going to talk about it on this episode of

[01:06] Canadian Pinball Podcast, I tried to just like decompress it a little bit and figure out why I think this is happening.

[01:14] Why is a man who's in charge of the world's biggest pinball company going on to shows, having to explain himself the way he had to explain himself?

[01:24] And I think I've sort of figured something out.

[01:27] And I think it's just simply this.

[01:29] I think people are looking for a lot of reasons to justify not buying or being enthusiastic about Stern Pinball's recent offerings.

[01:41] And I mean this.

[01:42] So outside of the cabinetry and how long the code takes and the delay for toppers and flat plastics,

[01:49] the real reason why any of this is truly happening right now,

[01:53] you're really just not overly satisfied with the product.

[01:58] If the games were great, we're not having these conversations.

[02:02] If the game's a masterpiece, you're not looking down at the corner of the cabinet.

[02:06] If the game's incredible, you're okay if there's some flat plastics here and there.

[02:11] If the game is like magical and it's got so much in it that creates moments of memory for you in pinball,

[02:18] you don't really care that the code took a little while to be completed.

[02:22] The reason why so much of this is happening right now is I just think the product overall has been very underwhelming for a long time.

[02:31] And so then it's easy to deconstruct it, to look at every single decision they've made,

[02:36] and say, hey, that's the reason why I'm not buying a Stern.

[02:39] It's because the wood.

[02:40] It's not the wood that it used to be.

[02:42] That's the reason why I'm not buying a Stern.

[02:44] It's because the accessories are overpriced or don't ship with the game.

[02:48] Or that's the reason I'm not buying the game because of the flat plastics or the uninspired mechanisms, all of this stuff.

[02:55] But the truth is, maybe it's a little bit of everything,

[02:58] but after listening to George talk about all the reasons why they made the cabinet this way

[03:04] and the reasons why there's delays on toppers and flat plastics.

[03:09] The other macro thing I walked away from after listening to George,

[03:13] and I always love listening to George, I mean, you have to respect the man.

[03:16] You have to respect what Stern Pimbal does.

[03:18] It's almost a little bit of an insult to him that he has to talk about his company

[03:24] in relation to other boutique companies that are just making eight to 900 games a year or 500 games a year.

[03:33] And this dude is doing that in like one week, right?

[03:36] So you can imagine there's always a little bit of smugness under the surface.

[03:40] Like, how dare you?

[03:41] Like, if these guys had to do what I have to do, they would collapse immediately.

[03:46] If they had to create product with the margins we need to create product with,

[03:51] they would be out of business.

[03:52] And I think he's not wrong there.

[03:54] Like, there's just a lot of us sort of look at these products and we put them all in front of us,

[04:00] and we compare the products and the companies almost equally.

[04:05] Now, look, you can't blame us because the prices are pretty much equal.

[04:09] So this is the big part that I don't think George ever quite gets.

[04:13] And I want to talk about one specific answer he gave when someone asked,

[04:18] Kerry asked a question about flat plastics.

[04:20] Like, why are we seeing such flat plastic, cheap stuff in a world in which all these other

[04:27] manufacturers and boutique companies are giving us beautifully sculpted worlds under glass?

[04:32] And George starts the answer by saying, you have to remember, Kerry,

[04:37] when I came through the door here at Stern Pinball, there were only eight people maybe in design and

[04:43] 20 or 30 people manufacturing, and now we're this big.

[04:48] And, you know, to grow at the volume we've grown and to become effective and efficient

[04:55] the way we have and to be successful over the years, you have to do things that keep you in

[05:00] business.

[05:00] And I think this is the part that George still just doesn't get.

[05:03] And I don't think the leadership over there at Stern just doesn't get.

[05:08] We don't care about your growth as an organization.

[05:13] We don't.

[05:14] We're not investors in Stern Pinball.

[05:16] We are buyers of Stern Pinball products.

[05:20] And there's a big difference there.

[05:22] See, if I was an investor in Stern, then absolutely I want to see them grow.

[05:28] I want to see the volume of games increase at any cost.

[05:32] I don't care if there's magic under the glass as long as you're growing and you're making money,

[05:38] because that's making money for me.

[05:40] But as a buyer and not an investor, it's 2025.

[05:45] And so when you still put flat plastics into your games and you're charging $13,000,

[05:54] I don't care that these are the design decisions you had to make to grow and to remain profitable as

[06:01] a business.

[06:02] I don't.

[06:03] All I see is for $13,000, you're giving me this.

[06:09] Spooky's giving me this for 10.

[06:11] Dutch is giving me this for like 13.

[06:14] Barrel's of Fund is giving me this for 11.

[06:16] Six.

[06:17] CGC is giving me this for like $9,500.

[06:20] That's what I see.

[06:22] And I do think that whenever George talks about why this is this way,

[06:28] he does have a tendency to talk in a way in which we should be thinking about the decades-long

[06:34] journey of Stern to grow this big.

[06:37] And I just don't think people care.

[06:39] And I mean this when I say this, I love George, but after listening to two hours,

[06:43] it is a little bit exhausting.

[06:45] It's like, I mean, an hour of it was spent on the damn wood cabinets.

[06:48] Now let's talk about that for a minute.

[06:50] So he's saying since 2018, it's been the same sort of composition of wood that makes up the cabinets.

[06:57] These are the cabinets that have been making Godzilla's and everything afterwards.

[07:02] And so, yeah, look, do I worry about the strength of these cabinets?

[07:07] No.

[07:08] Does the corner where like just the edges meet and they're not rounded out,

[07:12] they're not glued together anymore, does that look cheap?

[07:15] Yes.

[07:16] Does making it this way make it easier for them to assemble the cabinets?

[07:21] Probably.

[07:22] Now he said a lot of the decisions were all about consistency and making sure that the

[07:28] cabinet quality and the strength is consistent because if someone's gluing cabinets together,

[07:33] he doesn't have any idea how much glue was used.

[07:36] And so you get an inconsistency of quality.

[07:39] And if you're doing it this way, and every single piece of the cabinet is made on one machine and

[07:45] doesn't travel to another machine, so the left side's made on this machine, the right side on this,

[07:50] the bottom, and then you put it all together with those brackets, should be sturdy and it should

[07:56] feel the way a stern machine feels.

[07:58] And I was glad he said that because stern machines do have a very particular feel.

[08:02] And so they wanted to make it so the weight distribution and how this game feels in your

[08:07] hands is similar to the other stern machines you love.

[08:11] Okay, so I get it all.

[08:12] I get it all.

[08:12] Like I'm not like going to argue with the man about manufacturing the wood cabinets,

[08:17] but what I will say is this though,

[08:19] there still is just this perception that stern pinball is cutting corners,

[08:26] that stern pinball has been making things cheaper, not better.

[08:31] And so this is why this cabinet I think has such a lot of conversation around it,

[08:35] because I do think the cabinet in a strange way in this hobby is a great metaphor and a great

[08:41] example of what everybody's been talking about for a few years.

[08:46] Is this an improvement or is this a cost cutting measure?

[08:51] Now, if you're George, your goal is to achieve both.

[08:56] Why can't I improve something and make it more cost effective for us?

[09:01] So maybe that is the case here.

[09:03] See, I would be really lame if I told you he's lying and these cabinets are going to absorb

[09:10] moisture and they're going to fall apart in a few years.

[09:13] I don't know that.

[09:14] I'm not a woodworking expert.

[09:16] I'm not one of these dudes that's going to look at this thing and say,

[09:19] oh, because of this, I'm not buying a stern machine.

[09:22] Like I think anyone who thinks that way is being very close minded.

[09:26] If they put back to the future in this cabinet, you're buying it.

[09:29] If they put Beetlejuice in this cabinet, you're buying it.

[09:32] If they put Akira, Big Trouble in Little China in this cabinet, I'm buying it.

[09:37] I don't really care that much, but it's not even about him needing to take an hour to explain things.

[09:44] It's more about how did it come to this?

[09:47] And I've been saying it for a while.

[09:48] The whole rollout of Spike 3 has been embarrassingly bad.

[09:52] And because they never took the time to go over Spike 3 from head to toe,

[09:58] they're now stuck doing it this way, where every little incremental change is being noticed by the

[10:04] community because that's who we are.

[10:06] This is for a lot of people.

[10:08] This is the thing you love more than anything.

[10:10] So you're going to notice when all of a sudden there's a few new random holes on the cabinet

[10:15] near the legs.

[10:16] And George can explain to you, well, that's where the bolts go to hold the cabinets together.

[10:20] Well, that's new.

[10:22] We didn't know that.

[10:23] So all of a sudden, like if you walk into your house and all of a sudden there's just

[10:26] something new inside your home, you're going to notice it right away.

[10:30] And you're going to wonder, what is it doing there?

[10:33] And I think this was a really big miss by Stern-Pinball over the last year and a half,

[10:38] that they didn't take any real time to walk the community through.

[10:42] Your buyers, these are your future buyers, George.

[10:44] They're going to notice every change.

[10:46] They might have a perception that some of these changes are for the worse,

[10:50] that they are cost-cutting measures.

[10:51] And instead of getting in front of it and controlling the narrative,

[10:55] they once again have done what they always do.

[10:58] They don't do anything.

[11:00] They lead people to speculate.

[11:02] The speculation runs wild.

[11:04] And then you're doing damage control.

[11:06] See, when I see George on the Keri Hardy show, to me, that's damage control.

[11:10] That's not the way he wants to talk to the community.

[11:14] You know, he gets up from his desk and the camera unplugs.

[11:17] It's all grainy.

[11:18] His voice quality is not great.

[11:20] You've got this professional studio in which Stern-Pinball could have had Jack Danger

[11:25] go over the new changes happening on Spike 3 from head to toe.

[11:30] See, George now said they're going to do it, but it's almost already too late.

[11:34] You know, you don't get a second chance to make a first impressions.

[11:36] I've always said this, you get one chance to make a first impression.

[11:39] And it's always been somewhat embarrassing that Stern has basically had an inability

[11:45] to communicate what Spike 3 is, why we should be excited about it,

[11:49] and what the true benefits to the player are going to be.

[11:52] They've sort of dabbled in certain things here or there.

[11:55] The screen's bigger.

[11:56] The sound is better.

[11:57] You can have more node board functionality, all that stuff.

[12:01] The lighting system.

[12:02] I don't know.

[12:03] I still, to this day, I do a pinball podcast every week.

[12:06] I know everything there is to know about all of these companies.

[12:08] And I'm still somewhat confused what all of the major changes are to Spike 3.

[12:13] When I stand over Star Wars the other day, I was looking down at the lighting system

[12:18] and it just didn't look good.

[12:19] And I'm like, well, is this it?

[12:20] Is this as good as lighting can get on the Spike 3 platform?

[12:24] And so a lot of this, a lot of the reason why he had to go on there is Stern has done a really

[12:29] bad job in utilizing Jack Danger.

[12:32] Utilizing their personalities to communicate what the changes are going to be.

[12:37] If you were to ask me, I think they got a little stuck.

[12:39] Like Spike 3 kind of slowly rolled out.

[12:42] And the big issue, again, it gets back to what I was saying at the beginning.

[12:46] The big issue is they just didn't have an amazing game that showed off the new technology.

[12:51] And it's really a shame.

[12:53] You know, when you think about a brand switching over to a new platform,

[12:56] what you really want to do is make that great first impression with a product

[13:01] that everybody's excited about.

[13:02] So for example, if Spooky Pinball has an all new display, what better game to display it on

[13:09] than Beetlejuice?

[13:10] If Beryl Zafan has some new technology happening in a game,

[13:14] what better game to display it on than Winchester?

[13:18] And I just don't think Stern's had a hot product that has excited people recently

[13:23] that showed off anything that is part of their new platform.

[13:27] And so we get this.

[13:29] Now we got a lot of other news from George Gomez.

[13:31] We got news around is one of the next two titles going to be Transformers or Pokemon.

[13:36] And he said one of them.

[13:38] So it is most likely now that I think about it going to be Pokemon.

[13:43] And it is going to be a dual design game by Mr. Jack Danger, who started it.

[13:48] And George Gomez, who's going to finish it, they are both going to sign the L.E.s of the game.

[13:54] I don't think we've seen that before.

[13:55] I've been covering Stern for a long time.

[13:57] I've never seen two designers sign a game and have designed credits.

[14:02] Now, what do we think about this?

[14:03] I don't know.

[14:04] Did feel like George took a little bit of a shot at Jack when he said a game designer

[14:09] doesn't really develop his signature if he only has done three games.

[14:14] And I'm like, huh, you know, this would make Jack Danger's third game.

[14:18] But look, I think Jack Danger from a flow and a gameplay standpoint has made games that I think

[14:26] flow better than any George Gomez games.

[14:28] What I like about George's designs is he does try to put interesting mechanisms into his games.

[14:34] And he does try to sort of make it fresh, like doesn't try to just repeat ideas.

[14:38] I think we see more repeat ideas from guys like John Borg and more original ideas from

[14:44] guys like George Gomez.

[14:45] But I just have this like feeling like this like sixth sense that George Gomez at his age,

[14:50] designing Pokemon just doesn't feel like the guy for the job.

[14:55] And I also just feel like what happened to Jack?

[14:59] You know, I still feel this way.

[15:00] What happened to Jack?

[15:01] Like, I don't get it.

[15:02] Like he's still over there.

[15:03] Like what did you do to him that made him not want to finish what could be the biggest IP

[15:09] in the history of pinball?

[15:11] I don't know.

[15:12] Now, maybe it's transformers.

[15:14] Let's just think about this for a minute because George Gomez did the other transformer game.

[15:19] And maybe these guys are not working on Pokemon because he said, is it going to be transformers

[15:24] or Pokemon next?

[15:25] He said, it's one of those.

[15:27] And so I heard transformers was first.

[15:29] Now, the rumor was Elliot Iceman's doing transformers, Keith Elwin's doing fallout.

[15:35] The whole thing gets a little weird to me.

[15:36] So I also know from Jason Knapp reporting that Keith Elwin is one of the biggest Pokemon fans.

[15:42] So if you have the biggest IP in the history of Stern, why not maybe Keith Elwin does

[15:48] Pokemon and Jack Danger and George Gomez do transformers?

[15:54] After Elliot did John Wick, do you really think they're rushing to hand him another theme?

[16:00] I don't know.

[16:01] That game was a failure.

[16:02] Like it bombed.

[16:03] And I think he stepped in to do that because other designers were like busy.

[16:08] I don't know.

[16:08] I really don't know the answer, but I know that we should see this game in less than a month.

[16:14] This is what's crazy.

[16:14] We're going to see this next game.

[16:16] I believe at CES, which is January 6th.

[16:19] So George talked about the topper delays.

[16:22] Why are there accessory delays?

[16:23] Are we going to see accessories ship with the games?

[16:27] And he talked about how it's a design choice.

[16:29] We hear this a lot over at Stern.

[16:30] It's a design choice to make a topper either more complex or more simple.

[16:36] And based upon the designer's choice, it takes longer to make this stuff.

[16:41] Now, the thing about it is this.

[16:43] I would believe George if there was just one other thing that wasn't happening everywhere else.

[16:50] Why is it that every other company can get it done, but not you?

[16:56] Jersey Jack can get it done on every single CE.

[17:00] Jersey Jack ships a topper with every game.

[17:03] Spooky pinball.

[17:04] Same thing.

[17:04] They get it done.

[17:06] Barrels of Fun has a little bit of a delay now.

[17:08] There's no topper yet for Dune.

[17:10] There's no topper yet for Winchester.

[17:13] I believe the Labyrinth topper was available day one.

[17:16] So look, I understand there's a little bit of a gap, but some of these Stern toppers,

[17:20] we're talking over a year.

[17:23] See, I don't buy that.

[17:24] I just don't buy that.

[17:26] Once your game has been designed and it's moved into manufacturing,

[17:31] why would it take you longer than even a month to just apply a little focus

[17:36] to get all the accessories done, to get the vendors lined up, and to make the product.

[17:42] A year and a half on some of these toppers, even longer on some other games.

[17:46] Like we've waited years.

[17:47] You know, some of the phrases I'm just so tired of hearing, license or approval,

[17:52] and tired of hearing, it's a design choice.

[17:55] I don't really care.

[17:56] You know, at this point, I mean this, I just don't care anymore.

[17:59] I don't care to hear how the sausage is made.

[18:03] These games are just so expensive now.

[18:06] They know what consumers want by now.

[18:09] As a consumer, you know what you want in a game by now.

[18:14] You know what your threshold is for how long you're willing to wait for a game's code to be complete.

[18:21] You know what your threshold is on, you know, how long you're willing to wait for all the accessories.

[18:27] You're also just know your threshold for how long you're willing to wait

[18:31] for a theme that really speaks to you, for a game that you really want.

[18:35] My whole thing with Stern Pinball lately is simply this.

[18:38] I just see no compelling reason.

[18:40] When you hear them talk about the delays on getting to the code,

[18:44] on all the second hand value that's lost on LEDs, let's just talk about that for a minute.

[18:49] So George does talk about the fact that he says 30% of his games go on location,

[18:55] 70% of his games go to home buyers, and only like a small, small portion of those are

[19:01] LE buyers. But he did talk about how they're working on.

[19:06] I mean, I'm just kind of tired of this excuse by now.

[19:08] Like they're working on how to give the LE buyer more.

[19:13] George, Seth, when I met with you over a year ago, I said this was the number one problem

[19:22] facing your company from a home buyer standpoint.

[19:26] If you lose the collectors, everything else is connected to the value of that halo version of

[19:32] the product, and they've still done nothing. And you know, even when he talks about how

[19:37] the expression lighting on the speakers, it's encased in something that is exclusive to the

[19:44] LEDs. George, not enough. I mean, what is this an encased lighting system?

[19:49] And by the way, it's not an LE exclusive. Anyone with a pro or premium is going to be able to

[19:55] buy that. What LE owners are looking for besides great layout and design, they want to see something

[20:02] that justifies why their game is over $3,000 more. It is $3,500 more, George. That's the thing that

[20:14] I don't think he gets. For $3,500 more, what did you give me? That is basically almost the

[20:25] bomb on an entire stern game. For $3,500 more, you didn't give me exclusive code. You didn't give me

[20:36] really a lot of these new games, even like exclusive artwork. None of the Playfield artwork is exclusive.

[20:43] You didn't give me an exclusive topper. You didn't give me an exclusive mechanism. You didn't give me

[20:49] like even armor that looks exclusive. So that's the thing, $3,500 more. And now for the past few

[20:57] years, everyone buying these games has lost so much value on the LEDs. And I'm just tired of it.

[21:03] I'm tired of them still trying to figure this out when the answer is staring them right in the face.

[21:09] He even said it like, oh, we've been thinking about maybe we give an exclusive gameplay feature.

[21:15] Yeah, duh, duh. Like, I don't understand like so, but you're not going to do it. You're not going

[21:20] to do it because it messes up everything they're aiming for, which is what's the lowest we can get

[21:26] the cost of manufacturing this product to be? What's the lowest we can get the development cost to be?

[21:33] What's the easiest we can give our assembly line to make? So then every Playfield is the same,

[21:39] regardless if it's pro premium or Ali, basically, the cabinets now, I mean, I'm just going to say

[21:45] this, like when you see the cabinets, I don't care that the wood is like sandwiched with like

[21:49] eight or nine layers and MDF, whatever the damn names are, again, I don't care. It just looks

[21:55] cheaper that those pieces of wood are held together by brackets. There's just something about that.

[22:02] It's like if Michelangelo carved the pietà out of a solid piece of marble, you walk up to and

[22:11] you're like, wow. But if he attached the different arms and legs to each other using brackets,

[22:18] connecting the marble, it looks cheap. And that's just the thing. It's just the optics of it all.

[22:24] It just doesn't look premium at all. It's got some advantages, but the optics are it might look

[22:32] a little cheaper. But as I was saying at the beginning, I think Stern's big problem

[22:36] is a few things. I think the games just haven't been that great lately. I think the remastered

[22:43] stuff just feels lazy. And you know, I get he said like, Oh, it's 70% of the original work is spent

[22:50] on the remastered. What he means is like doing a remastered is 70% of the work it takes to make a

[22:56] brand new game. Okay, I don't care. I don't care if it's 70%. 30%. I just feel like Stern is trying

[23:04] now to get credit. And look, if the credit were due, and I mean this, if the credit were due,

[23:12] and they earn the credit, and the machines were beloved, like they used to be, if they were achieving

[23:18] what they think they're achieving in their own heads, then we wouldn't be having any of these

[23:23] conversations. And the reason we're having these conversations, the reason why Kerry Hardy's chat was

[23:30] so vitriolic, the reason why people are so like angry at Stern is they have passed on to thousands

[23:38] of customers over the last four years, cost cutting measures, themes people don't really want,

[23:45] not putting all the assets into the game, putting the same artwork on a $6,000 game as a $13,000

[23:52] game. And then the competition has done really most of the improvement in pinball. If you look at

[23:56] the companies over the last four years, who's been improving what they've been making, Stern is kind

[24:02] of still running in place. Like we don't see these things as leap forwards. And again, they're so far

[24:08] above everybody else. I know it's almost like comical for me to say like they should be worried

[24:13] about anybody else and they're not. And that's the other thing I just feel that they don't care.

[24:18] They don't care. They sell so many games. They just don't care. And yeah, there's so many newbies

[24:23] who buy their products, who don't care. Like, you know, trying to tell someone who just bought a

[24:28] Star Wars, they didn't buy a great game. It's a futile effort. Those people think they just got a

[24:33] new pinball machine and they're having fun. And we were all in that boat, each and every one of us.

[24:37] There was one point in our lives where we finally put a pinball machine in our house, and we had

[24:43] so much fun. And we didn't care. And I think that's kind of where I'm at now with this hobby is I

[24:48] don't expect a lot from Stern anymore. I really don't. I don't expect to be blown away by these

[24:53] Stern games. I'm glad Stern is in business. I'm glad they're going to bring out four games a year,

[24:59] three cornerstones, another remastered. It gives us something to talk about. I think buying any of

[25:05] their products new and box is absolutely silly unless you're an operator. I think only operators

[25:11] really need to get the new games on the floor to make the money. The home buyer who buys any of

[25:16] these games right away, I think is foolish. I think if you wait, you'll get a much better price.

[25:22] You know, George acted like he didn't have any idea why there was a Black Friday sale. He had no

[25:27] clue what was going on, that you were having Amazon and other places sell games at a huge

[25:34] discount. And the distros did not know that was happening. That's a bad look. It's just a bad look.

[25:40] It's his company. It's a bad look not to know that. People asked, why are you bringing in people

[25:44] who know nothing about pinball? And he said, hey, they have to get used to our business. They have

[25:49] to learn the business. I'm okay with that. But a chief marketing officer who knows nothing about

[25:54] pinball, have you felt his impact once? He's been there almost a year. I think it'll be a year in

[25:59] like March or something like that. I don't know, George. When you see these hires and you bring

[26:06] in people from the outside, it doesn't feel like they're listening to the community and they're

[26:11] making a positive impact. So all of this in my conclusion, after listening to George for two

[26:17] hours, first and foremost, thank you, Kerry, for doing that interview. And thank you, George, for

[26:22] giving so much of your time. But I think Stern is stuck. I think they're stuck and I think they need

[26:27] a way out. And I think the only way out to justify where their prices are at, how the wood corners

[26:33] look in the cabinet, how like the lighting looks next to modern games like Jersey Jack's Harry Potter

[26:38] and Beetlejuice and Evil Dead, and the games over at Barrels, their games are looking dated,

[26:45] and they're looking expensive for what they are. And the only way out is if they really

[26:50] designed some bangers. Kerry said to him, hey, why don't you slow down and make just two games a year?

[26:56] And George said, hey, we tried that during COVID. It didn't work because there were shortages. But

[27:02] George, the COVID demand is gone. It's a new world now. And I do think they might want to explore

[27:09] being more focused as an organization on just two cornerstones a year, where they put so much more

[27:16] effort and details into each game, where each of these games does ship with code that's further

[27:23] along with all the accessories. See, if you only had to do two projects that were cornerstones one

[27:28] every six months, you could apply a lot more of the company's resources to making sure those games

[27:35] arrive in much better fashion. And I think that might be beneficial to them. Let me say something

[27:40] that's going to be absolutely crazy. Stern Pimball in 2026, they could have if they only released

[27:49] two games in one year, and they focused all their efforts, and they actually listened to the community

[27:54] and they picked themes we wanted. Imagine if 2026 was different, and they were only going to release

[28:00] two cornerstone games, one is Beetlejuice and one is Back to the Future. You could have Jack Danger

[28:07] designing Beetlejuice and Keith Elwyn doing Back to the Future. You put all of your company's resources

[28:14] against each of those games. You can't tell me that they wouldn't sell more total volume units

[28:22] if they did that. And then on top of those two cornerstones, Remaster Tron or Remaster Lord of

[28:30] the Rings, I think that would be a more successful year than what we're going to get. And I'm so

[28:36] curious to see how Pokemon does with this demographic. I'm very curious about Transformers,

[28:42] but I've sort of lost feeling like giddy about what's coming next from Stern. And I think a lot of

[28:48] us have. I'm just not giddy. I know what they're going to do almost before they do it. And they've

[28:53] had just so many games in a row where it's just not exceeding any of our expectations. And our

[28:59] expectations are not too high. And I know George would agree with this. They should be holding

[29:05] themselves to the highest standards of the industry. They are the smartest, they are the most capable,

[29:11] they have the most resources, they have the most experience, they have everything. So when I put

[29:17] Star Wars next to Harry Potter and Beetlejuice and Winchester, why is it when I look over at your

[29:24] product Stern, it looks like the cheap bargain bin thing that belongs at Costco. That's all that I

[29:32] care about. I don't care. I'm not an investor in your company. Your thing just doesn't look the part.

[29:40] It's time that they slow down and make a game that reminds us why this company is as successful as

[29:48] they are, how they got so big. You know, George, it's like the proof needs to be in the pudding

[29:54] and the pudding they've been serving lately has gone. It's been expired. It looks expired. It looks

[30:00] old. And so we need a new moment. We need a magical moment from this company. And I know that each and

[30:06] every one of us is very level headed and we want to see them achieve that. I'm not rooting against

[30:11] Stern. I don't hope these guys fail. I don't want Zambietti to be mad at me. I don't think we're being

[30:19] unfair though. I think we're looking at this company and we're seeing all these changes and they just

[30:24] still, for the size of Stern, they still are poor at communicating the changes. They're poor at

[30:32] rolling out these changes and they're poor at getting us as a community to see the value in any

[30:39] of these changes. We just don't see it. And it's not enough to have just a few multi-millionaires

[30:45] like Iceman and Neil McRae buying everything or Ralph going to bat for Stern's wood working.

[30:53] I just don't get it. Guys, you're also part of the community more than you are in employee of

[30:59] Stern. And so these guys who show for Stern, they always feel a little weird to me. It's like,

[31:04] what are you doing? You should be on the side of the customer. And that's always been my thing,

[31:10] is just be on the side of the customer. You're not an investor in Stern. But I do think some of

[31:15] these guys, they get discounts, they get games at better prices, and they're friends with the

[31:19] Stern people. I get it. You don't want to say bad stuff about your friends. But anyway, gang,

[31:24] it is now 6.30 in the morning. The little ones are about to wake up.

[31:28] Life is very short. It's very precious. I want to give a big shout out to my friend Tux Browning

[31:34] down in Texas, who's in a battle right now. And I had a great conversation with Tux. We talked all

[31:40] about how he fell in love with Guns N' Roses. It's a long story. It's a beautiful story. And he

[31:46] says how that is just one pin that's never going to leave his house. And when you hear the story

[31:51] of why he loves G&R, it's beautiful. That's why I put the new Guns N' Roses song and nothing

[31:57] on this podcast. I don't like the new G&R stuff. I feel bad for Slash. He has to

[32:02] make guitar solos over songs that were throwaway garbage that Axel was just tinkering on. And

[32:09] Axel's never gone back into the studio to make these songs great. It's so painful, the new stuff

[32:14] they're putting the Guns N' Roses name on. And that's what I hope Stern doesn't do. Don't put your

[32:19] name on stuff unless it's worthy of the legacy of your organization, Canada Out.
