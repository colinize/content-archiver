[00:00] I'll be the last to say it all, follow your heart, but follow your own day, be man.

[00:08] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:12] Alright kids, Kaneda is off to Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo, Japan for the Rugby World Cup.

[00:20] That means you will not get any new Kaneda Pinball Podcast until October 31st.

[00:26] But wait, I'm lying because you are going to get the Christopher Fransche podcast on October 22nd.

[00:34] So look out for that one. Otherwise, guys, have a great, great pinball expo.

[00:38] I'm going to do a real quick what my predictions are of pinball expo 2019.

[00:43] So here's what I think is going to happen. You are not going to see anything new from Stern pinball.

[00:48] There will be a bunch of Elvira's and Star Wars games there. They're going to sell that.

[00:53] You will not see the Star Wars top or it's never happening. They messed up R2D2.

[00:58] He looks like a freaking egg up on top of that machine. It doesn't look like R2D2.

[01:02] So Stern pinball is all going to be about selling what's available in box today.

[01:07] People are going to play Elvira and realize it's not the greatest game ever.

[01:12] That's worth $15,000. Alright, but a big showing from Stern pinball.

[01:15] You are going to see, you have to see the collector's edition of Willy Wonka pinball.

[01:22] Jack is going to get up there. He's going to say how successful the game has been.

[01:26] He's going to say they sold 2,000 already.

[01:28] I already know the talking points. He's going to say exactly that.

[01:32] Then he's going to reveal what the collector's edition is.

[01:36] You are not going to see guns and roses at all.

[01:38] There's no way. It would be so silly to release guns and roses now.

[01:41] I don't think we're going to see that game until TPS.

[01:44] Alright, spooky pinball.

[01:46] Even though Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is coming to an end, I doubt

[01:50] we are going to see Scott Denise's game revealed.

[01:53] I think they might tease it a little bit, but I doubt we're going to see anything major.

[01:57] Chicago gaming company.

[02:00] I do not think you're going to see a new new game from Chicago gaming company.

[02:03] I think you're going to see most likely the medieval madness sort of upgrade

[02:08] that they're going to probably give everyone so they can make their machines

[02:12] look just like attack from Mars and monster bash.

[02:15] So that would mean a bigger screen possibly and a topper to go with the game.

[02:20] I don't think we're going to get like another limited edition of the game.

[02:23] I don't think they're going to burn the Ellie buyers.

[02:25] I just think they're going to give everyone who has that game a chance to upgrade it

[02:30] to look like the other beautiful games in the Chicago gaming company family.

[02:35] I expect to see that.

[02:36] I don't expect any news from Dutch pinball other than the same old pinball drama surrounding them.

[02:42] The big question mark I have is will we see Ellie and pinball at Expo this year?

[02:47] So that's the big question.

[02:48] Now I do know for a fact that the pinball brothers did approach a major pinball manufacturer

[02:55] this year about making alien pinball and that request was rejected.

[03:02] But what that does show us is that there's still life in the alien pinball world and they

[03:07] are looking for a manufacturer.

[03:09] So that leads me to the next company American pinball.

[03:13] Will we see the next title from American pinball and could it possibly be, I don't think it's

[03:20] going to be, could they be making alien?

[03:22] I don't think so.

[03:23] Josh Kugler I think chimed in and said no way.

[03:26] So will we see the third game from American pinball at Expo 2019?

[03:31] It's October and October fest is the current game.

[03:35] I don't think we're going to see it because I do think American pinball has learned their

[03:39] lesson that they should not reveal a game until it's ready to ship and I can't imagine

[03:45] that game three is ready to ship.

[03:47] So I think it would be, I don't think we're going to see game number three.

[03:50] Okay.

[03:51] I'm just going to give you my predictions of what I think is going to happen, not what

[03:54] I think these people should do.

[03:55] So no new game from American pinball, no new game from Stern, no new game from Chicago

[04:01] gaming company, no new game from Jersey Jack pinball other than a trim variation of Willy

[04:05] Wonka.

[04:09] There are not going to be any major reveals at pinball Expo.

[04:13] And when you go down the list of all the seminars and the conversations, it's always the

[04:18] same cast characters like Palt Loeller talking about this, the history of pinball 35 years

[04:23] of having a pinball hall of fame.

[04:25] Blah blah blah.

[04:26] It's the same people.

[04:27] Same things.

[04:28] So I guess my takeaway is, I think it's going to be a fun show as always to hang out with

[04:33] the pinball nerds geeks and chumps that are out there.

[04:35] We're all one of them.

[04:36] I think people are going to have a good time having beers and breaking away from the family

[04:39] routine.

[04:40] But I don't think this is going to be a show in which like a major thing happens now.

[04:45] That being said, the door would be wide open if someone came in with a big surprise.

[04:49] So if that if if like pinball brothers got their act together and had a secret reveal,

[04:54] I think that would go over pretty big at pinball Expo.

[04:56] So we all were expecting to see some deep root by now, but we have to wait until November.

[05:01] Am I missing any company spooky pinball?

[05:04] We got them.

[05:05] P3 multi morphic.

[05:06] They're going to be there.

[05:07] Jerry's going to be there.

[05:09] Four to six games are going to be set up and everyone's going to play them and will

[05:13] he sell games?

[05:14] How many has he sold so far today?

[05:16] Seven years in.

[05:17] We're going to see probably a new version of cosmic cart racing that has been simplified

[05:21] to make it feel more like your cart racing.

[05:23] Right?

[05:24] I love it.

[05:25] We've got a game called cosmic cart racing.

[05:26] It doesn't feel like cart racing.

[05:27] Let's make it feel like cart racing.

[05:30] But P3, I don't know.

[05:31] At some point they just have to be like, okay, we've got to just stop going to shows and

[05:35] just let's just make a normal pinball machine and make some money.

[05:37] How's that sound?

[05:38] All right.

[05:39] What else is going on?

[05:40] But Jerry, we do love you.

[05:41] Thanks for making the P-Rock.

[05:42] Without you, there wouldn't be so many other pinball games for us to choose from.

[05:46] I'm trying to think if I'm missing anybody, I don't think we're going to say anything

[05:49] from Suncoast.

[05:50] I don't know about that as Haggit's people or puny pinball.

[05:53] All the other pinball manufacturers trying to make it.

[05:57] So I think it's going to be a pretty like, you know, not a huge juggernaut news show.

[06:02] So we shall see what happens at the show itself.

[06:04] I will obviously, every once in a while, when I'm over there, be checking pin side to see

[06:09] if anything broke and if there's any new news.

[06:12] So that's it, everybody.

[06:14] Have a great, great pinball expo.

[06:17] Have fun with your pinball buddies and friends.

[06:20] Enjoy these games.

[06:21] I enjoy reading your debates about these games.

[06:24] We will have a little bit of a Canadian pinball podcast, hiatus.

[06:28] So you will be able to listen to the other 20-something other pinball podcasts that are out there.

[06:33] They will happily accept your ears and your minds as they talk about pinball as well.

[06:39] So all of my competitors, no, my friends, you guys are all my friends, right?

[06:43] You all love canada, don't you out there.

[06:45] I'm asking my listeners to check out some of the other pinball podcasts over the next couple

[06:50] of weeks.

[06:51] So everyone, wish Ireland good luck in the rugby world cup because we're trying to go see

[06:57] them in the semi-finals, but they got to get past the all blacks of New Zealand and the

[07:01] quarter finals.

[07:02] Everyone, have a great day.

[07:04] Canada, wheels up in three hours.

[07:06] Love y'all.

[07:07] Bye.
