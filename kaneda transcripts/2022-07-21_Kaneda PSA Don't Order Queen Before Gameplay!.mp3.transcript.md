[00:00] All we need is Ray o' Naga, Ray o' Poo-Poo, Ray o' Manga, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars.

[00:11] You know, I can't believe I'm on Facebook right now and I'm being spammed.

[00:18] I mean it.

[00:19] By all of these distributors saying order now.

[00:22] Queen Pinball, order yours today.

[00:24] Right?

[00:25] Order the game.

[00:26] Do we have gameplay?

[00:28] Have we seen what this gameplay is like?

[00:29] I mean it is absolutely blowing me away.

[00:32] It's like nobody learns a damn thing.

[00:35] Order Queen Pinball.

[00:36] All right.

[00:37] Today.

[00:38] What is today's date?

[00:39] Like what is the significance of July 21st in Queen history?

[00:43] Is there any significance?

[00:44] I don't know.

[00:45] Was this when they played Wembley Stadium?

[00:46] I have no idea.

[00:47] But all of a sudden they launched like a few flyers and there's the Champions Edition of

[00:53] Queen is available in Q1 of 2023.

[00:58] So pre-order yours now with an exclamation point.

[01:02] Play the game 14 Queen Songs Live.

[01:05] And I love like the special game features.

[01:07] It has a red special upper play field with full size flipper.

[01:10] It has Wembley Stadium toy with ball catching magnet.

[01:14] One vision hand drawn art package.

[01:17] Break free kick back shoots into orbit.

[01:20] And this is where it gets really funny.

[01:21] Ramps and toys.

[01:23] A fully lit radio replica.

[01:25] Okay.

[01:26] So the special physical ball lock is a ball like a toy Wembley Stadium physical ball

[01:31] lock.

[01:32] And then it's got all these piano drop targets and stand up targets to metal ramps a jukebox

[01:37] vertical up kicker a magic saucer three gate drop targets one bicycle ride spinner for

[01:44] base stand up targets.

[01:46] Everybody a target is not a toy.

[01:50] Now look, I'm just going to say this right now.

[01:52] This game was launched by the pinball brothers today with these flyers first.

[01:57] It wasn't even launched with like HD photos of the game.

[02:00] Now they put those up later on their website.

[02:03] And so here we are.

[02:05] Here's the game.

[02:06] It's the same exact game we saw that was put into that Queen pop-up store months ago.

[02:10] And everyone's going to say the same thing.

[02:12] This is one of the greatest musical acts of all time.

[02:15] One of the greatest bands.

[02:17] These are some of the greatest songs.

[02:19] Now they're not the studio recordings of the songs.

[02:21] It's like live versions of the songs, which is not as great.

[02:25] And I think we're going to get live footage of the songs.

[02:27] I think they tried to copy guns and roses a little bit, but I think everyone is really

[02:31] happy that we are not hearing current day acts or rose sing the songs.

[02:35] We're getting the studio recordings of the song.

[02:38] Here's the part that rubs me the wrong way.

[02:41] Here's another example where they put out a game with a flyer.

[02:44] They're not showing you gameplay.

[02:45] You have no idea what the rule set is.

[02:48] You don't have enough information to buy this game.

[02:50] The information you have right now is that it's one of the worst art packages on any

[02:55] music pin ever.

[02:57] Okay, so there's that.

[02:58] We know by looking at the game, there's not much in it.

[03:01] It looks like a pretty basic layout.

[03:03] But here's the part that I'm just so tired of.

[03:06] It's this non-refundable deposits.

[03:08] So once again, we will take your money today and it says the game will be available on

[03:13] the flyer September of 2022.

[03:17] So then you go to the website, you go to order the game and guess what it says on a distributor's

[03:20] website.

[03:21] Additional note, this is a preorder.

[03:24] This is a non-refundable deposit.

[03:27] There are only estimates on when the games will be produced and timelines cannot be guaranteed.

[03:34] Okay, so let me translate that for you right now.

[03:37] You're going to give this company money in which you can never get your money back and

[03:41] when you give the money, you're being told the game's going to start rolling out in September.

[03:46] Now Pimbal Brothers is not Stern Pimbal.

[03:48] They're not Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[03:50] They don't have a track record of starting production on time.

[03:54] Have they built all of the alien orders and now we're supposed to believe they're going

[03:58] to be able to make a thousand limited editions of this like Rhapsody edition of Queen Pimbal?

[04:04] When I saw this, I was like, who's going to fall for this right now?

[04:08] Like first of all, this game is just an ugly duckling.

[04:11] It's just an ugly duckling and guess how much this game costs.

[04:14] Are you ready for it?

[04:15] This game with the thousand units of the Queen Rhapsody edition are going to sell for $10,995.

[04:24] That is $5 less than Guns N' Roses Limited Edition.

[04:28] And if you put this game next to GNR, I just don't understand how you could even come to

[04:34] a conclusion that these games are the same price.

[04:37] It's too much people.

[04:38] I'm just going to say it right now.

[04:40] This show doesn't have to be very long.

[04:41] This is it.

[04:42] Like I'm sort of done with this.

[04:44] This is like a $6,000 machine.

[04:46] $7,000 at most.

[04:49] But it looks like a $6,000 machine.

[04:52] And here we are being told that this is an $11,000 game.

[04:56] The problem with all of these companies thinking they can charge you this much money for these

[05:01] games, it's a joke.

[05:03] Nobody's buying anymore people.

[05:05] You can go on to distributor pages today and they're still sitting on their allotments

[05:09] of Toy Story CE.

[05:11] They're not sold out.

[05:12] This game's not going to sell out.

[05:14] And it's just like, it's so weird to me.

[05:16] Now I don't think this game is going to sell.

[05:18] Like I think people are smart enough.

[05:19] But I think this practice of non-refundable before you display the gameplay, I'm so tired

[05:24] of it.

[05:25] Here's who I'm talking to right now.

[05:27] All of you dealers and distributors out there, I think all of you out there need to ask these

[05:32] companies before I list your game for sale, I need gameplay video to show my customers.

[05:38] See, they don't really care because once they have your money, you can't back out.

[05:43] But why would anyone in a million years order this game before you see it being played?

[05:50] Why?

[05:51] There is no reason to order today.

[05:53] And I know that dealers are just doing their job.

[05:56] But to me, this is just another example of just everyone is out of touch.

[06:02] This isn't a $6,000 game anymore where you're willing to just support the pinball brothers.

[06:08] This is an $11,000 pin which we know they're not going to get on the line in September

[06:14] and we know there's a reason why they're not showing you gameplay.

[06:18] Because you know how easy it is to show gameplay?

[06:21] To just hook up a tripod and record someone playing the game?

[06:24] Or give the game to someone first and let them play it.

[06:27] I'm literally right now staring at an image of this game next to Guns N' Roses and it's

[06:31] just laughable.

[06:34] How much is in Guns N' Roses and then you want to charge me the same amount of money?

[06:39] And some people are saying to ship this game costs $995.

[06:43] Pinball can't be this sport anymore in which almost everything is around or above $10,000.

[06:49] If you're going to ask us for $10,000 then you better hire a good artist.

[06:54] If you're going to ask us for $10,000 you better have toys in the machine that are

[06:58] not spinners.

[07:00] And if you count spinners as toys or pop bumpers as toys people are going to say no thank you.

[07:05] And this whole thing of like it's limited, it's limited come on you're not going to sell

[07:09] a thousand of these even if it wasn't limited.

[07:12] There is no way you're finding a thousand buyers for a game at $11,000 if this is what

[07:18] the game looks like.

[07:20] Because also you're not a company that people have a lot of confidence in.

[07:25] I get that some people are unboxing their aliens and they're saying okay things are okay with

[07:29] my alien machine but nobody has confidence if they order their game today they're going

[07:34] to get their game anytime soon.

[07:36] The pinball brothers can't even make a thousand games a year.

[07:39] Like do you know how many games they make a week or a month?

[07:42] No nobody does.

[07:44] But for them to say we're going to make a thousand of these and then also make the champion

[07:48] at addition it's such wishful thinking.

[07:51] And I just urge all of you out there wake up do the smart thing do not send in a non

[07:59] refundable deposit on this game.

[08:02] Wait until production has begun it'll be easy to get one distributors will be sitting on

[08:08] it and I'm telling you right now they're not even going to make a thousand they're not.

[08:13] By the time they get to game like number 400 Steve Richie's music pin will be out.

[08:17] This is just the way it works.

[08:19] It's so easy to make a flyer.

[08:21] It's so easy to sell a game.

[08:24] It's so much harder to make it.

[08:25] I don't even know why this upsets me.

[08:27] I don't.

[08:28] Maybe it shouldn't because I know most of you don't care.

[08:30] I know that most of you are not buying a game from the pinball brothers this year.

[08:34] I know Kim Mitchell is going to text me right now and say how great is alien LV is.

[08:38] But I don't even know if he has one Kim I'm sorry how great your fathom is going to be.

[08:42] But here's the thing.

[08:43] It's just rubbing me the wrong way the way all of these people are just in it together.

[08:48] Are the dealers looking out for you when they do this.

[08:51] Are the manufacturers looking out for you when they do this.

[08:55] We as consumers need to have a very simple policy.

[09:00] If I can't play the game then a manufacturer better upload a video or have somebody play

[09:07] the game.

[09:08] So we have enough information to go on before we're asked to buy these products.

[09:14] These aren't like $50 video games people and we can see more gameplay footage of a $60

[09:21] video game than I can of a $10,000 pinball machine.

[09:25] It's absolutely ridiculous.

[09:28] Everybody thank you for tuning in to Canadians pinball podcast.

[09:31] This has just been a really short episode because I saw this and it just triggered me.

[09:36] This is inane.

[09:37] Do not pre-order this game later.
