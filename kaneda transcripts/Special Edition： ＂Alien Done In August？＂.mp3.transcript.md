[00:00] So we are still very confident, as I said, we're ready to start testing our white wood

[00:04] within the first couple of weeks of January and development is happening very quickly.

[00:15] Development is happening very quickly.

[00:19] Those are the exact words of Andrew Highway regarding alien pinball.

[00:24] And those words were said in December of 2014.

[00:28] And so here we are in 2016.

[00:31] And this machine has been something that we've talked about a lot.

[00:35] We've dissected the artwork.

[00:37] We've talked about the creative direction.

[00:38] We've talked about when are we going to see a populated play field?

[00:42] And when is it time where we can actually give an opinion about this pinball machine?

[00:47] The threat itself on Pinside has sort of fallen off.

[00:51] It's gone way off the rails.

[00:53] The last I checked, there was just photos of Tracy Lords.

[00:57] And then people sharing photos of older attractive women.

[01:01] I do love when the mods is absolutely themselves even give up on a thread like they have with the alien pinball thread.

[01:07] But there was news today.

[01:08] And that's why we're going to have this special edition of Canadian pinball podcasts

[01:12] because there was news that came from Andrew himself about alien pinball.

[01:19] And I want to talk about what he said.

[01:21] And I want to give my opinions about what I think is going to happen with this machine.

[01:25] So let's first talk about word for word, what he said.

[01:31] I've been trying to get a quote from Andrew.

[01:35] I've been trying to reach out to him.

[01:37] The best I could do is get outside of a door.

[01:40] And I heard he was talking to one of his highway employees.

[01:43] Here's what I overheard when I put my hand against the door with my ear there.

[01:48] If we tell them what we know, we take away the hope.

[01:54] And hope is very dangerous to lose.

[01:58] Well, all hope is not lost because Andrew highway himself chimed in today on Pinsland.

[02:02] And here's what he said.

[02:03] He said, hi, everyone.

[02:05] I want to give you all an update.

[02:07] The official line from Fox is that we can't publicly show videos until the game has been approved as a whole.

[02:13] I will continue to show teasers privately at shows until then.

[02:17] All right, let me first stop there.

[02:19] If Fox hasn't approved something to be shown, Andrew highway.

[02:24] You're not allowed to show that stuff to people privately at shows until then.

[02:28] And I'll explain why because they may not approve it.

[02:33] So you're showing someone something to get them excited about the game,

[02:37] to take orders on the game.

[02:39] And what you're showing them may not be approved.

[02:42] That is how IP works.

[02:44] Assets cannot be distributed to people at shows or privately or in your home,

[02:50] when you're hot tub, in your airplane, or in your car.

[02:53] It doesn't matter.

[02:54] It's not approved.

[02:56] Those assets cannot be shown to anyone outside of the organization.

[03:01] And that's the professional line here.

[03:03] So I'm surprised to see him say that.

[03:05] That it's going to be something he's going to pass along like in his good old boy sort of fashion.

[03:10] He then goes on to say, there's a chance we will be at two years,

[03:14] two US shows next month.

[03:15] So I'll let you know if that happens.

[03:18] Alien won't can't be shown until it's finished.

[03:23] So what he's saying there too is, hit me up if you're at those shows,

[03:27] and I'll give you a sneak peek.

[03:28] Look at stuff.

[03:31] Not allowed to do that, but he sounds like he's going to do that.

[03:34] He then goes on to say, at our last team meeting,

[03:37] we all agreed on a schedule that should see Alien Pinball complete by mid-August.

[03:42] Pending approval by Fox of the finished game,

[03:44] then we expect to start production in September.

[03:48] We all love what we are doing with this game,

[03:50] and it's frustrating not to be able to show you our progress.

[03:53] There's another argument that when you all see the finished promo video,

[03:57] then it will be exactly what we want to show you,

[04:01] rather than prototype videos at various stages of development.

[04:03] Okay, so he then goes on to say, we got to show you the full thing.

[04:07] And I think that's the line that they should stick with,

[04:09] not let's show you work and progress at these different shows.

[04:12] He finishes with, we apologize if this disappoints anyone,

[04:16] but we are nearly there now.

[04:18] All should become clear within a few months.

[04:21] Okay, do we believe that?

[04:24] So he says we're sort of coming up on the finish line.

[04:28] Canada wants to go on the record on Canada's Pinball podcast by saying,

[04:32] I am betting you that Alien Pinball will not ship in the month of September.

[04:40] If Alien Pinball ships in the month of September,

[04:46] I will not do a Canada's Pinball podcast that entire month.

[04:51] Okay, I will take off the month.

[04:53] I will not do a single podcast if Alien Pinball ships in September of 2016.

[04:59] I just doubt that date.

[05:02] I, and I'll tell you why, because I have not seen a company ever who's in this position,

[05:09] who throws out a date that is in the future as a date they're looking to hit,

[05:14] that has ever hit it.

[05:16] There are only two companies that have ever put out dates and hit those dates,

[05:21] Stern and Spooky, and unless a date or an expectation is set by either one of those companies,

[05:28] I just think it's a hogwash.

[05:30] I don't think he should have done it.

[05:32] I think he should have not put those dates in people's heads.

[05:36] Look, I'm not rooting, and this is the thing, I'm not rooting against them for me in that date.

[05:42] I want, you know, I'm not.

[05:44] I just don't think they're going to do it.

[05:46] If it comes out then, I'm happy.

[05:49] I'll happily take a month off from doing this podcast, but I just don't think that is ever

[05:54] going to happen.

[05:56] What was interesting is after Andrew posted, or a chimed in.

[06:05] I love it too, because these guys don't seem to be as much in Communicado anymore.

[06:10] It used to be like they were both going back and forth on communication.

[06:13] I think Andrew's taken the reins, which is the right way to do it, and is now controlling

[06:18] the communications over there.

[06:20] Org Chimes in and says, hey guys, something I heard in the Slack channel that Andrew posted

[06:25] here.

[06:26] Seriously though, I get the frustration.

[06:28] We feel it too.

[06:30] Sucks to work on these teaser videos and then not be able to even show them.

[06:34] If it were up to me, you'd see everything.

[06:37] Why the hell not?

[06:38] We've come this far ready together.

[06:41] All right, not really sure we've come together this far, but I get it.

[06:45] He wants to show us stuff.

[06:46] I understand that.

[06:48] Actually, if we're up to me, I'd be working on this in secret and no one would even know

[06:52] existed until it appeared in playable form.

[06:55] The ship has sailed though.

[06:57] How many times can Org go against the marketing strategy of Highway Pimball?

[07:02] If we're up to him, Org, you could have spoken up and said, Andrew, let's not show the

[07:06] Playfield artwork.

[07:07] Let's wait until it's fully done.

[07:10] There was absolutely no reason to show that Playfield artwork.

[07:13] It didn't win people over.

[07:15] It didn't create new orders.

[07:18] All it did was make people want to see the final game more.

[07:22] That Playfield was shown when.

[07:24] What is it, Maynow?

[07:26] When was that shown?

[07:27] April, I want to say.

[07:31] You're going to show it maybe eight months prior than you know you'll have a playable game.

[07:35] I just think the whole thing has just been such a cluster.

[07:39] They can keep saying these things, but nothing has been done right.

[07:45] Then he says, all I can say right now is that the video is real and there are people who

[07:49] saw the previous one who can vouch for it being real.

[07:52] I don't think anyone's denying that this video exists.

[07:56] It's great.

[07:57] Cool.

[07:58] You guys have a video.

[07:59] Great.

[08:00] It shows the game.

[08:01] I don't...

[08:02] Here's the thing.

[08:03] We're going to have a game in there now where no one gives a shit about your teaser videos

[08:06] or what you expect the game to be or little nuggets here and there.

[08:10] Stern is the new way to launch Pimbal.

[08:13] What I don't understand is this.

[08:14] If you're highway Pimbal and you look out there and you're really trying to be a competitor

[08:18] to Stern and you're trying to dethrone them a little bit, steal some of their sales,

[08:22] take some of their market share.

[08:24] How hard is it for you to say, well, what are they doing right?

[08:28] And how do we emulate what they do right?

[08:31] So you'd come down to short list.

[08:33] What Stern does right is they manufacture the pin and have it ready for production before

[08:37] they reveal it.

[08:39] Why wouldn't you simply emulate that behavior that Stern does?

[08:43] That is the most professional and successful way to market and reveal Pimbal machine.

[08:49] This is not like rocket science.

[08:51] This is just basic marketing 101.

[08:54] Highway has done the complete opposite.

[08:57] They announced a release date for Alien in 2014.

[09:01] They've since fumbled to have updates.

[09:03] The designer left.

[09:04] They showed the play field art.

[09:06] It was underwhelming.

[09:07] They haven't sold out of their LEDs.

[09:10] They're just sort of slowly getting to some sort of finish line on this pinball machine

[09:17] and it's just been marketed terribly.

[09:22] Let's see what else Ork had to say.

[09:25] He said, and it sounds like Andrew will continue to show it at events.

[09:29] He will make a new one by then, come to his seminars and report back.

[09:33] I was actually pretty surprised by how quiet things were after Texas pinball festival.

[09:37] But I guess the pin-side meeting greet was at the same time as the highway seminar,

[09:41] which was crap timing.

[09:43] I mean, I just love it.

[09:44] He's always like crapping on the decisions by the company.

[09:49] Yeah, you guys had your meeting, your reveal or your conversation about Alien.

[09:55] But here's the thing, Ork and Andrew.

[09:56] Here's the thing.

[09:57] If people were really, really excited to see what you had to show at Texas pinball festival,

[10:03] they would have gone.

[10:04] They had a choice.

[10:05] I mean, they're going to go to the pin-side meeting greet, which was just a bunch of people

[10:10] at a bar having beers.

[10:11] Or I'm going to go see the reveal of Alien and see the toy in the video.

[10:18] And what did people decide to do?

[10:20] They skipped it.

[10:22] Can you guys need to accept the fact that just hanging out with people having beers

[10:27] was more important than seeing your pinball machine.

[10:31] So you can't tell me if Stern was like, we're going to reveal Star Wars.

[10:35] Or we're going to show Ghostbusters for the first time that all the pin-side people would

[10:39] have got together and say, hey, let's go there instead.

[10:43] So I know it's a hard pill to swallow, but it's the truth.

[10:48] He then goes on to say, that's about all I have to say.

[10:52] But I saw some post-implifying that Fox stuff was bullshit.

[10:54] And I just want to say that the game is really being worked on by people.

[10:58] By real people who shot a real video.

[11:01] OK, we got it.

[11:02] There is a real video.

[11:03] I don't think anyone did not.

[11:05] On the other hand, I personally hate showing in progress work, never do it with my personal

[11:09] projects.

[11:10] I'm just going to keep doing my part to make the actual reveal worth the wait.

[11:15] Take it easy, everyone.

[11:16] All right, cool.

[11:18] So nothing really knew there from work.

[11:20] I mean, there's always been this sort of sense of, you know, we want to show you every

[11:24] thing completed.

[11:25] And this is, you can really break it down into very simple.

[11:30] He's always saying, this isn't how I would have done it.

[11:33] But this is how Andrew's doing it.

[11:36] And in this sense, I agree with Orrick.

[11:40] There was no point in showing any of it early.

[11:45] And it just doesn't make any sense.

[11:47] And none of the things that are being shown are going to make people run and order it.

[11:51] And I just don't get it.

[11:52] And I have to say this, the man who I think hit the nail on the head, and him and I have

[11:59] had some disagreements over the years.

[12:00] But the man who said something, I just thought was spot on, is Rare Hero.

[12:05] And Rare Hero said, he says this, a few years ago, Highway's plan was to release four

[12:11] games per year.

[12:13] Alien was supposed to ship in 2014, had the original proposed production pipeline been true.

[12:19] There should have been like 10 Highway games by now.

[12:22] See or radically, those games should have been in development.

[12:25] And with the alien delays, you would think that the schedule would have been shifted

[12:29] in other games announced and released first.

[12:32] I wonder why hasn't this happened.

[12:34] Now all we know, pinball is hard.

[12:37] Wait, sorry.

[12:38] Now we all know pinball is hard.

[12:40] And a highway releasing games at a stern pace is unlikely.

[12:43] But surely a couple games should have been in development simultaneously with alien.

[12:47] And at this point, one of them should have been completed.

[12:51] Rare Hero really struck me as a company that had it act together, called me a skeptic

[12:55] at this point.

[12:56] So, Rare Hero, I think you're right.

[12:58] And you're not just right about highway pinball.

[13:00] You're right about the reality of all these companies who have jumped into the ring and

[13:07] pretended to be pinball manufacturing companies who knew how to do it.

[13:12] I'm not saying that a company can't, with a lot of resources and a lot of wasted time

[13:16] and wasted money, eventually ship a pinball machine.

[13:20] We've seen the exact same behavior from alien, from highway, from Big Lebowski and Dutch.

[13:28] And what we've seen is simple, these companies don't really know how to manufacture a pinball

[13:34] machine.

[13:35] They're just learning how to do it.

[13:37] But on top of that, they also have no clue how to market a pinball machine.

[13:42] They have no clue how to reveal a pinball machine.

[13:46] It's all been a clusterfuck for them and they've all fumbled the ball.

[13:51] And there's no excitement anymore when you do it this way.

[13:54] Because Ghostbusters and Stern continually doing it the way they do it is just going

[14:01] to make all these guys look even laimer.

[14:04] Because here's the thing.

[14:05] There's only one company that followed Stern's approach and that was spooky.

[14:10] It's like they built a machine.

[14:12] It's fully built.

[14:13] It showed it to you, fully built and said, do you want America's most honoured?

[14:18] Here it is.

[14:19] We built the full thing.

[14:21] We know how to build it.

[14:23] If you want it, come buy it.

[14:26] But everyone else has done the complete opposite.

[14:29] They've shown this work in progress.

[14:30] They've shown things that haven't been completed.

[14:32] I mean, if anyone really pulled a fast one, people it was Dutch because Big Lebowski looked

[14:36] like it was done.

[14:37] And two years later, look at them in production now.

[14:40] What are they making?

[14:41] Like one to three machines a week, a week.

[14:45] I don't get it.

[14:47] We were shown pictures for how many weeks of like their production line, their manufacturing

[14:53] plant, their robots, all these things.

[14:56] There's no line.

[14:58] There's no line there.

[14:59] They're building like one game out of time it seems.

[15:01] It's just pathetic.

[15:04] And look, I think that alien pimple by the time it comes out is going to have

[15:10] really missed a boat.

[15:13] I think people are just going to be, I guess the benefit is with alien.

[15:17] And I'll say this.

[15:19] The one thing keeping them still afloat is that we really haven't fully seen it.

[15:24] So we're not tired of it yet.

[15:26] We're not exhausted by it.

[15:27] We haven't seen the play field for a year or two like the Hobbit.

[15:31] Look at the Hobbit.

[15:32] It ships.

[15:33] Nobody cares now.

[15:34] There's absolutely no enthusiasm about that pin.

[15:37] So highway still sort of has like that reveal moment.

[15:40] But what is now the issue with them is that expectations are going to be through the

[15:46] roof that that pin blows people away.

[15:50] It's all there, nothing.

[15:51] It has to blow people away.

[15:53] And we already know that the artwork is not going to do that.

[15:57] So now it comes down to the shots, the music, the callouts, the immersiveness of the

[16:03] pin.

[16:05] And it's going to come down to that.

[16:06] So we'll see.

[16:07] So everyone can just take off the months of May, June, July, August.

[16:14] So four months.

[16:15] So there's going to be a four month basically, hiatus as these guys finish this pin up.

[16:20] So let's see what happens in those four months.

[16:22] But you heard my bet.

[16:23] If they ship in September, I will not do a podcast in September.

[16:27] That's going to be a big one for me.

[16:28] It's going to be a big one for me.

[16:30] But now that I'm a betting man, I want to make one more bet before I end this episode

[16:34] of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[16:37] Some of you might have noticed that I removed a certain individual's podcasts from my library

[16:47] of podcasts.

[16:48] And some individual that I've named on this podcast is his special editions of Canada's

[16:54] Pinball Podcast have been taken down.

[16:57] And it was unfortunate that I had to do that.

[17:00] But I want you guys to ask him why I did that.

[17:04] He may tell you he may not.

[17:05] I will tell you at a later episode.

[17:07] I really doubt he wants you guys to hear what he did.

[17:11] Because when you do hear it, I think it will reveal his true character.

[17:15] And it was a cheap shot.

[17:16] It was a cheap shot that people on my end found really funny.

[17:20] But I want you to ask him, what did you do to Canada?

[17:23] What did you do?

[17:25] And I want you to ask yourselves if you would have done what he did because it was really,

[17:28] really uncalled for and kind of pathetic.

[17:32] But it's wood under the bridge.

[17:35] I've removed those podcasts.

[17:38] I think that having too much anger and hostility out in the world isn't a good thing.

[17:44] So I want to settle this like men.

[17:46] And I think we should settle this the way grown up men should settle a confrontation or

[17:52] dispute with a friendly challenge.

[17:56] So I want to challenge Orick Lawson to a game of Street Fighter V. I know he plays it.

[18:04] I know he's got his custom arcade stick.

[18:06] He's probably pretty good.

[18:08] He's got custom sticks and he's really into Street Fighter.

[18:11] I see him posting videos about guy-haw combos and whatnot.

[18:14] So I want to challenge Orick Lawson to a game of Street Fighter V for $200.

[18:21] Winter takes the $200.

[18:23] I will play him anytime.

[18:25] I will play him anywhere.

[18:27] I will play him on PS4 Network.

[18:29] We can play on Twitch and we can stream it so everyone on Pinside can see this.

[18:34] Or we can set up a Street Fighter V battle at any of the shows that we are at together.

[18:40] But I think we should shake hands and we should grab our arcade sticks.

[18:44] You know what I'm talking about guys, not our penises.

[18:47] And we should settle it.

[18:50] So you heard it Orick.

[18:51] Street Fighter V challenge by Canada.

[18:53] Will you accept or will you turn it down?

[18:57] We'll do a, we'll make it fair.

[18:59] We'll do it a best of, what best of five.

[19:03] So first of three victories takes the cake.

[19:06] I hope he accepts.

[19:08] That's it for this special edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[19:11] Will Alien come out in September?

[19:13] I don't think so.

[19:15] Have a good night.
