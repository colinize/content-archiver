[00:00] If I could just wait, five more minutes, and tell you how I feel.

[00:12] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:16] All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:20] We are just days away from Pokemon.

[00:24] Dealers have been contacted by Stern.

[00:27] They know the details.

[00:29] Now, if that has happened on a Tuesday, I think we're going to see the Pokemon logo

[00:37] teaser theme reveal on this Friday.

[00:41] It's either going to be this Friday or next.

[00:45] Stern's typical launches go like this.

[00:48] On a Friday, they announced the theme with some 30 to 60 second teaser video.

[00:55] Really it's like 30 seconds.

[00:57] They'll be like the Pokemon ball, and it's going to be like Gotta Catch them all Stern

[01:02] Pinball.

[01:03] And then on Tuesday, we're going to get the full game reveal.

[01:09] Little weird that they're over at CES in front of all of these people, and they're going

[01:14] to do it the week after.

[01:17] It's kind of like they can't just get their stuff together lately with all of these like

[01:23] licensor approvals.

[01:25] But here's what we know so far about Pokemon.

[01:28] The game started as a Jack Danger game.

[01:33] I heard from some people over there Jack was getting really creative with the design and

[01:38] the layout.

[01:40] You know, he likes to push the envelope.

[01:42] X-Men, Foo Fighters, two great shooting games, one of which was killed by bad code.

[01:49] X-Men, the codes getting better.

[01:52] And I heard that he sort of was sidelined by Gomez who wants to make a much more simple

[02:00] pin.

[02:01] And so now the latest rumors are that this game is going to be more of a reflection of

[02:07] a new Deadpool versus a game maybe like X-Men or Foo Fighters.

[02:14] We might get a more traditional layout, and we might get more of a basic game in terms

[02:21] of mechanisms.

[02:22] Now I hear people out there being like, well, Canada, what's the problem?

[02:25] Deadpool is a great game.

[02:27] And I would say back to all of you that Deadpool, Ellie, was how much money?

[02:34] And Deadpool, Ellie had Zambietti, maybe his second greatest art package, maybe his greatest

[02:40] art package ever on a stern machine.

[02:43] It was before the rainbow explosion, and it was perfect.

[02:48] Like Zambietti's Deadpool machine looks so good.

[02:52] And remember too, back then this is when we were sort of fresh to all the Zeddy comic book

[02:58] style artwork, and hey, he's got a comic book style approach to his art, and it's a comic

[03:04] book.

[03:05] So it works perfectly.

[03:06] Now, you know, look, if he does Pokemon, it is a comic and anime, so I think it would

[03:11] fit the theme very well.

[03:13] But here's the issue.

[03:15] It's now 2026, and Sturm Pinball, I think, needs more than just a game that checks the

[03:21] boxes.

[03:22] I think they need a game that is magical, that has like mechanical engineering.

[03:27] That's awesome.

[03:28] They need a statement game for this new Spike 3 platform.

[03:32] Everybody knows it.

[03:33] I'm in the Star Wars thread today, and it's interesting how the owners are like, I don't

[03:37] understand why this game got such blowback at launch.

[03:42] And people are like, it's Barron, and they put a picture of it next to the Data East

[03:47] Star Wars, which has nicer artwork, which has more interesting mechanisms in it.

[03:54] That's why there was blowback people.

[03:57] In 2025, this game comes out and has almost nothing in it.

[04:01] John Borg himself admits to rushing this game in eight months.

[04:06] In eight month design cycle.

[04:09] Jersey Jack Pinball has 18 months to make every single game.

[04:13] The typical Stern design cycle is at least like 14 to 16 months.

[04:20] And so why would you rush out Star Wars?

[04:22] I think the biggest thing with Pokemon is this.

[04:25] It's not really going to be a Jack Danger game at all.

[04:28] This is going to be a Gomez pin.

[04:32] And you know, 73 year old George Gomez, does he have an emotional connection to Pokemon?

[04:40] Do you think he's seen a single Pokemon episode?

[04:42] I mean, he's probably making this game, but you know what I'm saying?

[04:45] The man hasn't been dreaming about the possibilities of putting a Pokemon world under glass.

[04:53] And this is why I think, and I don't know yet, but if I were to make my guess, I think

[04:58] it's going to be underwhelming because I think George is going to be answering a homework

[05:03] assignment versus making a game that he's super passionate about.

[05:09] I think he's going to be making a game to try to get Stern out of a financial hole because

[05:14] their last few games have been really mediocre.

[05:18] And I'm hearing like Seth has been calling meetings and he's like yelling at people about

[05:22] what's going on, where the sales for the walking dead, how come this is not selling so well.

[05:27] And so it's a company that's got its back against the ropes.

[05:31] And it doesn't feel like the culture over there right now is one where everyone's going

[05:37] in and having a good time and bringing their best ideas to the table.

[05:41] And everybody's collaborating on how to make Pokemon the best pinball machine.

[05:46] But what will happen is this.

[05:48] This game will sell very well based on theme.

[05:53] And even as I say that, I almost want to play Devil's Advocate.

[05:56] I don't know man.

[05:58] I don't know if there's enough like crossover between Pokemon fans and people that will

[06:03] drop 7 to 13,000 on a pinball machine.

[06:07] And here's the thing that I think has happened is Stern's lost a lot of the base, the core

[06:12] people that are just pinheads that used to buy every new Stern.

[06:17] And a lot of those people, they're just burned.

[06:19] They're tired.

[06:20] They're burnt out of losing so much money.

[06:22] Even Star Wars right now.

[06:23] I'm looking at Star Wars.

[06:24] You can go get the LE for almost 10 grand now.

[06:26] So $3,000 off.

[06:28] People in the thread are like, well, I got a premium for the price of a pro.

[06:31] And you know, this doesn't just go away.

[06:33] These are the latest releases.

[06:35] You can almost now go get a Walking Dead remastered LE for $3,000 off.

[06:41] These games are not selling.

[06:43] And so when you lose that aura that you make something that has the value, it doesn't even

[06:49] hold the value at MSRP.

[06:51] I think a lot of pinheads are just like, look, I'm curious.

[06:54] There's not a single pinhead out there that isn't excited on a new pin day.

[07:00] There's not a single pinhead out there.

[07:02] And I mean this.

[07:03] That's not open-minded when every new pin comes out.

[07:06] There were people that rode off barrels of fun because of Labyrinth and then they bought

[07:11] a Winchester.

[07:12] There are people that might hate Stern Pinball and their recent releases and think they're

[07:17] barren and cheap.

[07:19] But if they put a great game out in the world, you're going to buy it.

[07:22] They still have the capacity to make amazing pinball machines.

[07:25] When you go on the pinside top 100, there's no denying the fact.

[07:29] Stern has made some of the best pinball machines ever.

[07:33] They're in a little bit of a quagmire.

[07:35] They're in a little bit of a weird place right now.

[07:37] I think culturally they need a change.

[07:40] And I don't know who that change agent is.

[07:43] Seth has the weight of this company on his shoulders.

[07:46] He's now the CEO.

[07:48] Gary ran this thing for many, many years.

[07:51] His father was in the industry.

[07:53] He grew up in this industry.

[07:55] George Gomez, same thing.

[07:58] He's been doing this since he was just a young lad.

[08:01] And here he is now at 73, handed the biggest IP in the world.

[08:06] And you know when he's designing this game, on one shoulder is the young George Gomez

[08:13] being like, what's the greatest creative stuff we could do?

[08:17] And on the other shoulder is the bean counter being like, well, we have to maximize profit

[08:23] and we have to give back to our private equity investors a return on their investment so

[08:28] we can't go crazy with the bomb on this game.

[08:31] Look, I hope this game blows us away.

[08:34] I hope this game exceeds our expectations.

[08:37] With every Stern launch recently, our expectations have been lowered.

[08:42] So they don't even need to come out with like the next Godzilla in my honest opinion.

[08:46] They just need to come out with a game that just looks like a ton of pinball fun.

[08:52] It just looks like a game that is unique, that doesn't feel like more of the same.

[08:57] And I think that's the other thing with Stern lately, all these remakes and remasters and

[09:01] new versions of older games, whether they're anniversary editions or not, it does feel like

[09:07] we've seen this movie before.

[09:11] We're asking us to pay more to see the same movie again and it's just not working.

[09:17] It's just not working.

[09:18] So we shall see all of our Pokemon questions will be answered.

[09:22] They will be answered within the next two weeks.

[09:26] Now speaking of two weeks, this is too funny.

[09:29] The man who made two weeks famous in the world of pinball is back at CES.

[09:36] Andrew Highway is back with his latest invention, ice explosion.

[09:43] It is a home machine to make slushies.

[09:48] I'm not even making this up.

[09:50] Now he's had this ice explosion idea for like six, seven years because I remember people

[09:56] who worked on the art for the ice explosion logo.

[10:00] But here's the funniest part.

[10:02] Here's the funniest part.

[10:03] He is clearly looking for investors.

[10:07] It's not available to buy and it's coming out sometime in 2026.

[10:15] There is just something about these serial entrepreneurs that fail every single time

[10:23] and they just keep coming.

[10:26] Now I will say this.

[10:28] Now you know what to get Canada for Christmas.

[10:31] I mean this.

[10:32] The ice explosion machine actually does make it to market by the end of this year.

[10:39] I would like one.

[10:41] I would want one of these.

[10:42] I think we should put these things on every machine as a topper after you have a good

[10:47] game.

[10:48] Just go up there and make yourself a slushie.

[10:50] And I love the fact that all of these like scam artists, you know, they always start

[10:54] with the same line.

[10:57] Andrew's got this line.

[10:58] It's like this all began with my love of slushies.

[11:03] This all began with my love of pinball.

[11:06] This all began with my love of hydrofoils.

[11:09] If you don't know the Andrew Highway story people and some of you are newbies, you have

[11:14] to remember about a decade ago when this guy was lying to the pinball community, only

[11:20] one pinball podcaster called him out.

[11:23] Only one pinball podcaster was asking the tough questions and a lot of people came at

[11:29] me.

[11:30] He threatened me.

[11:31] He was coming at me.

[11:32] And guess what?

[11:33] I was right.

[11:35] If it smells like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it is a duck.

[11:40] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[11:42] People are getting their predator machines.

[11:45] Look I'm happy if you get a predator.

[11:46] It's just not for me.

[11:47] I just cannot enjoy a predator machine without Arnold.

[11:53] It is that simple to me.

[11:54] It is Batman without Batman.

[11:57] It is Star Wars without Luke Skywalker.

[11:59] It's just not going to work for me.

[12:02] That doesn't mean you can't have fun.

[12:04] That doesn't mean you can't be in Dutch's crew.

[12:08] I see their use in AI to make all these weird Facebook posts with all the dealers and distros.

[12:13] They still have not sold 300.

[12:15] Can you think about that for a minute?

[12:18] There are about what?

[12:19] Like 8 billion people in the world.

[12:22] There are probably in excess of 20,000 pinball collectors in the world.

[12:30] And there are probably 5,000 hyper buyers of pinball.

[12:36] And there are easily well over 300 locations globally that would love to put a new pinball

[12:44] machine in their arcade or operate it because new games bring in money.

[12:50] And you can sell 300 of an iconic theme, a nostalgic theme like Predator.

[12:59] That's an issue people.

[13:00] That is a real issue.

[13:02] But look, I'm happy you're getting it.

[13:04] I think it's a game that's just going to keep losing value.

[13:07] And I don't think they're ever going to get Arnold into this game the way Alien eventually

[13:12] got Ripley into the game.

[13:15] What else is going on?

[13:16] I'm starting to see a lot of people getting nervous about back to the future.

[13:26] Old habits die hard.

[13:30] Barry is once again going a little radio silent on people that want answers to where the toppers

[13:39] are on some of these Alice games.

[13:42] The new Alice's are shipping with the toppers.

[13:45] The issue is it's a really intricate topper so you need to design a special box and you

[13:51] need to ship it in a way that's not going to break.

[13:54] It's a lot easier to ship it attached to the game.

[13:58] The thing is this.

[14:00] What Barry and everybody over there at DPX needs to know and DP, your company has a history

[14:08] of saying nothing.

[14:10] And what you need to realize is that silence is toxic.

[14:15] You made it so.

[14:18] So even if you don't have an exact timeframe of when a customer can expect their topper,

[14:26] you can't go silent.

[14:29] You can't not respond to anyone's inquiries about the status of their game.

[14:37] And so this is a thing.

[14:39] We need everybody and I mean is we need everybody over at Dutch and it's not just Barry.

[14:45] It's everybody as a company.

[14:48] That's the old Dutch.

[14:50] And I think if Dutch really wants to make it to back to the future, they need to never

[14:55] go radio silent again.

[14:58] How many total Alice's did they make?

[15:01] I don't know somewhere around like 300 maybe a little bit more.

[15:05] That's a far cry from the 500.

[15:08] And now they got to get Raza on the line.

[15:12] What's going to have to happen at Dutch pinball is the company is going to need to change.

[15:17] They're going to need to work harder and longer if they are to get to back to the future.

[15:24] And I'm a little bit nervous.

[15:26] They took off two weeks during the holidays.

[15:28] That was a pivotal moment for their company.

[15:31] You got to get as many of these Alice's in a box as you can.

[15:35] So maybe in this year, you got to work harder.

[15:39] Maybe in this year, you can't take the vacation you want to take because you got to survive.

[15:46] And I'm still getting these vibes that there's still a little cavalier about it all.

[15:52] And that Melvin has made these two games to help them survive.

[15:56] And I think they need to collectively get together and just approach this differently.

[16:02] It's all not just going to work out because you have back to the future.

[16:07] Remember when the Bosch came out, a lot of people wanted one, but their own internal

[16:13] issues are the reason why it all collapsed.

[16:16] So not for a minute do I think simply because they have back to the future that that's going

[16:22] to fix a lot of the internal issues.

[16:26] They need to work on these now.

[16:28] And getting 500 Alice's made in a single year was a great goal to achieve.

[16:35] And they came up way short.

[16:38] And that's not a good indicator.

[16:40] If you can't make 500 Alice's in a year, how are you going to handle the demand for back

[16:47] to the future, which is going to have like 10,000 orders.

[16:51] And so this is concerning.

[16:54] And I hope that this company really, really figures this out and they need to figure it

[16:59] out this year.

[17:00] This is the most important year in the history of Dutch pinball.

[17:05] And as I start to do the timeframe and the math, I do get a little bit concerned because

[17:11] if you have like 200 or so Alice's to make and you now have gone on the record to say

[17:18] you're going to make 333 Raza's, we all can say right now because it's already almost

[17:25] mid January, you're never going to get those 333 Raza's made in 2026 because Raza manufacturing

[17:33] might not even begin until like June or July.

[17:38] If we're looking at the way things are going, they still have to make all these Alice's because

[17:42] you know, they're not going to get 200 refund requests.

[17:45] And so what do you do?

[17:46] I mean, you got to hire more people.

[17:47] And if you don't hire more people, you got to work longer hours and you got to get it

[17:51] done.

[17:52] And I think this is going to be a test of Barry's work ethic of the organization's work ethic

[17:58] and they're either going to show us, they're going to step up or I think it could collapse.

[18:03] I mean that I think it could collapse because they got to get it together.

[18:08] I hope they do, man.

[18:09] You know me.

[18:10] I hope they do.

[18:11] I like these guys a lot.

[18:13] I've always said I can't wait to see what Dutch does next.

[18:15] I think unlike Stern, they're going to put a lot in the game, but they got to get the

[18:20] manufacturing together.

[18:22] They still in 12 years have only made two games.

[18:26] That's not a recipe for success.

[18:29] All right.

[18:30] What else is happening in the pinball world?

[18:32] Beetlejuice's.

[18:34] The Beetlejuice production has begun.

[18:37] Everyone has game number 745 apparently.

[18:40] What's going on with that?

[18:41] It's like weird.

[18:42] A few people have the same number.

[18:44] I can't wait for this game to get out there.

[18:46] I can't wait for this game to be in the hands of all the fans.

[18:50] There was so much hype, well deserved for this game and now I want to see what people

[18:57] feel about the game in their homes.

[19:00] I think we're going to see games going out the door by the end of this month and then

[19:03] it's just going to be the year of Beetlejuice all the way up until the end of the year when

[19:08] they announce Goonies.

[19:09] It's going to be fun.

[19:10] It's going to be great.

[19:12] I have to make a correction on this year's Canada's Kudos Awards.

[19:16] I gave Christopher Franci a kudo for Evil Dead.

[19:21] The problem is I forgot that I gave him a kudo for Evil Dead the year prior.

[19:27] So I need to change the game in which he gets the kudo for.

[19:32] It is going to be Beetlejuice.

[19:34] I was splitting hairs between the two and it's going to be Beetlejuice.

[19:37] I've had a lot of stern people.

[19:39] I've had a lot of stern fanboys come up to me and be like, I can't believe stern didn't

[19:43] win anything.

[19:45] And someone yesterday said to me, Canada, it should have won for King Kong art.

[19:49] And I'm like, are you kidding me?

[19:50] King Kong art?

[19:51] I mean, it's fine, but man, no.

[19:54] And I'm just going off of the community's feedback.

[19:57] There has not been any universal love for King Kong art.

[20:01] In fact, the vitriol, a lot of the vitriol for Kong outside of lack of assets is the

[20:08] art package and how all the art packages look the same and how that comic book stylized

[20:14] Kong is not how you relate to King Kong.

[20:18] So no way was King Kong going to win over Harry Potter or Beetlejuice or Evil Dead.

[20:24] No way.

[20:25] In fact, I would put Dune way in front of King Kong for best art package.

[20:28] I would put Winchester in front of King Kong for best art package.

[20:33] A good art package really shouldn't make people upset.

[20:37] I'm just saying that.

[20:38] All right, everybody, it's going to be a great week.

[20:40] I'm really looking forward to it.

[20:41] How do you guys feel, man?

[20:42] I feel like I'm getting the cobwebs out coming back from the break, getting back into work,

[20:48] the weekly routine, a little depressing.

[20:50] I won't lie.

[20:51] It's dark out.

[20:52] It's cloudy.

[20:53] It's like you're tired.

[20:55] You haven't seen the sun or I haven't gone on a long walk in a long time.

[21:00] And it's like, it's dark when I leave.

[21:01] It's dark when I get home.

[21:03] I go into the office.

[21:04] It's still pretty quiet.

[21:06] Everyone always needs like a Caribbean vacation after the holiday vacation.

[21:12] People have been asking me if I'm going to pinball at the beach.

[21:14] I don't know.

[21:15] My new company we've been acquired and the PTO days are a lot less.

[21:20] We used to have unlimited.

[21:22] Now I have a very limited number.

[21:25] And so getting to pinball shows for me this year is going to be a lot harder.

[21:29] I've already booked Japan and Italy.

[21:32] I just can't burn like three PTO days down in Florida seeing pinball machines.

[21:38] I would love to, but I've got to put my family first and trips with Brenda in front of pinball

[21:45] trips.

[21:46] All right, everybody.

[21:47] I think in just a few days, we're going to see Pokemon teaser.

[21:51] And I think in maybe less than a week, we're going to see the game.

[21:53] It's about to get real exciting.

[21:55] Thank you for being a member of the Canada club.

[21:57] We'll chat soon.

[21:58] See you next time.

[21:59] 

[22:28] Bye.
