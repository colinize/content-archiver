[00:30] I told everybody, for months, not for weeks, not for minutes, for snappercicings, for months,

[00:54] months, getting on a beetle juice. Make sure you get on a list for a beetle juice. I said for months to do it.

[01:06] Do you think I was joking? You think I was kidding? Months, get in on a beetle juice. Make sure you get on a list.

[01:16] Don't come crying to me. Don't come crying to Canadians. Not fair. How'd you get a game? Don't go to the pin side. Spooky should make more.

[01:28] They're not making any more, your babies. What the F were you doing for months? For months? Where are you?

[01:38] You're all of a sudden you're in the pinball now. You just want to march in on the day the game goes up for sale and you want to seat in the hottest restaurant in the pinball world in the history of pinball. I have never seen a game sell like this.

[01:54] Never. I've never seen a game. This game has sold out in nine seconds.

[01:58] And you all walked in. You walked in like a bunch of pin-side idiots. I'm going to wait to see the trailer then you're not getting shit. You're not getting shit. Enjoy the trailer. Enjoy the trailer. Enjoy the feature rep by the time you're done with the feature at all thousand games or sold baby. What do you think I was doing? What do you think I was saying this for? You think I was doing this for my health?

[02:28] You all thought I was joking. I thought you were going to go just go get one. I was going to give spooky a call. I'm going to give them a call. See this idiot. I'm just going to give them a call.

[02:39] They're thirty thousand people trying to get through on the website alone. Thirty thousand. Wake up. You pin-side babies. This is a huge movie franchise.

[02:56] That's perfect for pinball. And you thought you were just going to like mosey on in ain't nothing to see here. I'm going to get a seat at this restaurant.

[03:08] I'm going to get a seat. You got shit. I don't know. I'm excited today as you can tell. Locked out like a bunch of babies.

[03:16] Waking up to these text messages. Hey, can you do what are you doing with those five guns? I'll tell you what I'm doing those five games.

[03:23] I'm watching. I'm studying. I'm observing all of these babies. And guess what? They ain't getting one if they're not a Canadian club member. And guess what?

[03:37] You had to be a Canadian club member by yesterday. We hit seven hundred club members. I'm not doing this to try to get new subs.

[03:53] The reason why people are going to start subscribing to Canadian pinball podcasts is because now they know not only did the man have that obvious genius idea to turn the game on with Beetle.

[04:05] Yeah, where's Colin now with his story? Where's his story about how can he actually was the inspiration for that entire thing where he knows nowhere to be found. He's doing doing stories about transgender pinball controversies at tournaments. That's what he's doing stories on now.

[04:23] Transgender people getting a cost at him. I've no idea what he's talking about.

[04:27] That's what we're doing now in the week spooky comes out with Beetle juice. Yeah, good luck with that Colin. Know your audience, buddy.

[04:37] You know, I feel I feel so good about this hobby where it's going where I'm going in this hobby. The things I have in the works the things you're going to see coming up the things the games the games that are coming up.

[05:02] As I said, it's a shift. It's a shift.

[05:15] The entire pinball like the entire pinball universe just discovered a new planet called spooky yesterday and there's life on it.

[05:26] And not only that, the life is a lot more interesting than the life that's over at Stern.

[05:33] Mad pinball says got one morning of from spooky was on this ago and didn't get.

[05:42] I don't understand what you mean, mad mad arcade and Pima. What does that mean? You are on a list and you didn't get it. Then you weren't on a list.

[05:51] You should have got on more than what also like wake up guys were humans not dodo birds. Why didn't you just get on more than one list? It was free.

[06:02] Free.

[06:05] Head your bets. Are you grown men? You know, you go into a bar when you're like 20 and only talk to one chick. If you even talk to chicks, talk to a few.

[06:19] Talk to a few distors. Get on a few lists. What's wrong with you guys? Common sense. A screva laque as we say in Sicily.

[06:29] Let's hear myself. Are we doing this? We're doing this. We're doing this. How we sound it? I know I'm screaming.

[06:41] I just feel like first of all, we're obviously going to talk about what the heck went down yesterday. A complete shift in the power dynamics.

[06:50] I'm not saying spooky pimples outsell and stern, but stern man, they run scared. What happened to them yesterday? What happened to the walking dead stream? All you buy mistake you put up the X men topper? How's that happened? How's that happened?

[07:08] You know, as a beetle juice owner 99999, I just want to say I'm excited to get this game.

[07:20] I'll tell you right now, this game is selling for on the second hand market. Bill brand is just told me he turned down an offer of $18,000.

[07:28] And he said, no, 18 grand. I heard robins pulling down for sale ads on Pinside. Is that true or not? You're not allowed to sell your spot.

[07:47] Well, a socialist run in Pinside. I don't know if that's true or not. We got zombie Eddie chiming in with some salty shade on. You see that?

[07:59] Oh, we're back to saturation and colorful bit like the amount of saltiness happening over at stern yesterday. Amazing. You rock them. David versus Goliath. You hit him between the eyes yesterday spooky.

[08:16] Stern hasn't been hit like this in a long time. And the reason why is they passed on this theme. They got rid of franchi and they've been delivering just ugly stuff lately.

[08:29] And they saw a game in which 99.9% of people are like, this is one of the most beautiful Pim on machines I've ever seen. And the only people that are poo-pooing it are stern employees.

[08:45] Salty.

[08:52] Love it. You know why we all should love this? Because it's going to make Stern get better.

[09:04] You know, look, I come to you now at the turn of the tide. I come to you now a new golden era in Pimball. And it began like a year ago.

[09:18] If you can when we saw a sad boy man with a hundred dollars, look at this guy. Look at this guy. You own the show brother. You're going to give me a hundred bucks like just like that.

[09:36] I love you mother. Imagine being Stern right now. Effin laughing my ass off. They look like bozos 40 year old clown shoes.

[09:51] My money is safe from their garbage going forward. Serious congrats to the entire team over at spooky beetle juice will go down as an all timer.

[10:04] You demand franchi. That's a human being. Broke this not AI human.

[10:12] Human. Franchi is the man. Bug and Luke are the men DJ the man. Everybody over at spooky. There they got the juice now as they would say back in the in the 80 you got the juice now boys.

[10:31] You got the just it's turns going to try to sell a hundred and fifty dollar X-Men shooter now that just has a F and sticker on it. Are we done now? Are we done?

[10:42] Seth has got a walk into an office on Monday morning and have a picture of beetle juice up on the wall. Are we done? Are we done acting like fools?

[10:54] This company built this machine out of a barn in Benson. And I've got this 60,000 square foot facility and you're giving me this crap. The Star Wars crap.

[11:09] They built that game in a barn with their bare hands. What is this? What is this? We got the biggest IP in the company history. And this is what you're coming at me with John board.

[11:24] Shut up zombie. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. Sit down. Sit down.

[11:40] You know, they are better understand. You know, like something's happening here.

[11:53] Something's happening here and it's beautiful. I can go from 11 to one like this and I'm just going to tell you right now.

[12:01] I'm so proud. You know, I was talking to my dad this morning and I said dad like look at this. I said him America's most haunted.

[12:09] And I said, Dad, look at this game from 12 years ago. I was around when these guys couldn't even sell 150 pinball machines and they almost went out of business. And this is the game that they made.

[12:21] And I sent them a picture of the walking dead from 12 years ago. This is the biggest company in the world. Release this game. The same time they released America's most haunted.

[12:31] I said, Dad, look at what happened this last week. Stern released this walking dead and they released this beetle juice. That's 30% cheaper than walking dead Ellie that has this much in it that looks this good.

[12:47] Game set match American dream. American ingenuity. American innovation. This is it. You don't understand this is it.

[13:03] This is what we teach our kids to aspire to do. This is why this country is amazing. This is why competition is amazing. This is why social media is amazing. This is why our ability to rally around the company and send a message like everybody did yesterday is amazing. This is it.

[13:26] You have the biggest pinball company in the world that gets on there and says nobody in my organization wanted to make beetle juice nobody.

[13:33] So you don't want to make the game that the community wants to buy. They sold more beetle like I should like if you literally like could tally the amount of demand Stern hasn't felt this in forever.

[13:49] Game looks way better than Godzilla looks way better than John looks way better than King Kong. It's it's it's another level.

[13:58] And like literally what happened yesterday. What happened yesterday. It's just like this is it now guys like it's a whole new pinball world into beautiful pinball world to wake up into.

[14:10] We've got Manchester's you know mystery house we've got this now we've got like you know all this energy happening around the boutiques led by the biggest boutique which is Jersey Jack.

[14:22] I think Jersey Jack's going to learn from this as well I think Jersey Jack's going to learn a lot from how spooky codes it's games.

[14:29] I think if there's one Achilles heel of Harry Potter. It doesn't really make you feel like you play the movie modes as intimately as beetle juice is going to make you feel like you're intimately intimately playing the moments in the movie you love.

[14:43] I think there's a little too much going on in Potter. I think they're going to learn I think they're going to get better this is what competition does.

[14:50] And it's good. It's good. The problem over at Stern is simply like what they've been pushing in front of people like recently it just looks cheap.

[15:00] It looks crappy and it looks uninspired. And then it all looks the same.

[15:06] You know. So like it's and then also you start to add up all of these boutique companies all of these orders and then what happens ladies and gentlemen when you're just satiated.

[15:17] By supporting a boutique company or two a year makes you feel really good.

[15:22] What doesn't make you feel good is buying all these stern new inboxes and losing three to five thousand dollars on every alley and they've done nothing to course correct that.

[15:32] So you've got four years of people losing three to five thousand dollars on every alley and they've done Jack to correct that.

[15:40] And you think just going to keep selling to these people you don't understand it's the movie margin call if we do this set.

[15:47] If we charge twenty thousand dollars for James Bond sixty if we do this George if we do this Gary nobody stood up and said if we do this we will never sell to these people again.

[16:03] But this is it man.

[16:10] This is it we moved into this big factory because there were tax breaks from the you know the city and our investors wanted us to grow at this rate and we have to do this because we've got all this overhead and all these mouths to feed.

[16:26] This is not like if we charge twenty thousand for this we will never sell to these people again.

[16:33] If we charge two thousand dollars for toppers we will never sell to these people again.

[16:38] If consistently stern alley buyers are losing three to five thousand dollars a game we will never sell to these people again.

[16:49] I sold my beetled you spot for a lifetime membership.

[16:55] You know I am I mean I'm in awe of how a game that was so hyped has over delivered and I've said it and I'll say it again and I I constantly say when was the last time a stern machine exceeded your expectations.

[17:18] When was the last time a stern machine exceeded your expectations.

[17:25] When was the last time you bought a stern machine where you really felt like you got your money's worth.

[17:33] Godzilla four and a half years ago Batman Batman was um Batman was ten years ago.

[17:44] Is ten is nine years ago Batman nine years ago.

[17:51] That X-Men shooter knob is real I don't know if it's a plate might be a placeholder photo but I don't know I know the toppers real.

[18:00] 9.5 years ago Batman.

[18:07] The Sterns not done gang I mean they're they're going to have to figure stuff out now I've heard some I've heard some concerning things about the Pokemon game it is coming out it is Pokemon I heard it is more of a lunch box deal though I don't I don't know what that means if Pokemon's a lunch box deal I don't know what that means I don't know if it's like just the original Pokemon not all the new Pokemon I don't have no idea what that means if you if you sign a limited licensing agreement with Pokemon I have no idea what that means.

[18:37] Jurassic Park was the last great I know come on got Jurassic Park had no assets guys.

[18:46] You know I get that Jurassic Park is a great shooter to me Jurassic Park was when Stern started going cheap no assets from the movie how can you not get the Jurassic Park movie assets but you can get the Star Wars assets okay no assets from the movie they didn't even license the damn Jeep they couldn't even go to jeep and get the license for the Jeep that's when they started cutting corners they didn't even license

[19:06] they didn't even license the Empire State Building that they you don't license the Empire State Building in a King Kong game we're done here I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm leaving you know what's up say it's like I want a divorce and I think that's what a lot of people have said yesterday they said it with Winchester like they how many times are people going to ask Stern for a divorce and as I told George and Seth and Gary your number one priority is winning back your collector audience and they've not done it and they hired a Samo I don't think he's done anything zombie Eddie

[19:36] coming at me is not helping matters zombie Eddie chiming and yesterday doesn't help matters everybody looks on the defensive Jack Danger clearly doesn't want to really Jack Danger is not enjoying his job there you know John Borg looks like he's he made three games in a year all of which have been mediocre he's not happy

[19:55] you know Metallica wasn't mediocre I take that back Metallica was the only one that felt like they did it right everything else feels like what you know

[20:04] so I also want to say congratulations to me congratulations to canada your back at 700 subscribers we were at 650 about three months ago

[20:17] congratulations to me for being 100% spot on on telling everybody to get on a list for a beetle juice congratulations to me for warning people every single week congratulations for having the idea beetle juice beetle juice and congratulations to me

[20:36] for being absolutely wrong about star wars going up in the walking dead going up in the back I just want to say look I think every member of the canada club is feeling a little bit vindicated by all the canada haters out there that constantly try to say like only says the same thing he's so negative does this sound like a negative show

[20:54] yeah we're making fun of stern because they deserve to be made fun of and also like can we also just for a moment can we just for a moment talk about how stern did say they were going to stream the walking dead yesterday and now all of a sudden what this walking dead game how many people like if I'm going to tell you right now if you're in on a walking dead only and you're not going to like like just I would not go in on that game for 13000 you need your head examine the game is going to be 10 in like a month

[21:24] I would be staring down a star wars early instead of a beetle juice if not for canada yeah I wonder if my old buddy Derek got a beetle juice I wonder if he's on the list for one you know he doesn't talk to me anymore I see him all he's all active in pinside and I sent him a nice note saying dude all you got to do is reach out and all the hatchets are buried he still has not responded like crazy to me still hurts a little bit I got to be honest every time I read him active on pinside that he threw our friendship in the

[21:54] dumpster simply because I simply because I didn't vote for Kamala Harris sorry sorry I just want my boys doing hair at the

[22:07] hard work and money that I that I put aside for them I don't want it to go to your socialist beliefs because

[22:13] you don't have children sorry Derek you don't know what it's like to try to leave something behind

[22:17] to your children sorry it's called being selfless and look by the time my kids are Trump will be long gone it's more about the

[22:27] financials of what I believe in I'm a financial voter not a bleeding heart and you know the thing too is like what

[22:38] people don't realize is like you can like have conservative values and not really like Trump

[22:43] I like you're allowed to be that way you know I'm saying like I don't think Trump is great I think he's like I think I

[22:51] don't think it's done a good job either I mean look at it like he doesn't brought any inflation down

[22:55] everything it's like but I still just want to hold on to my money and I don't believe in any of the

[23:00] far progressive left garbage they're putting into these kids heads is anyway back to this game

[23:05] the thing is um let me ask you guys out here we got 83 42 who got a beetle juice who out here

[24:20] didn't go as man Tony for you guys that like did you guys I'm just curious did you guys hear me

[24:25] for months telling you to get on a list and you just didn't like I'm just I really am just curious

[24:30] of those who tried to like actually call in and get one did you not hear any of my shows for

[24:36] months are you that new to pinball

[24:44] see semi said I deserve the shame

[24:54] so John Gallo I see your name on here too like I guys like I was trying to like really help

[24:58] you out for months

[25:04] Winchester and Beetlejuice lucky man god on month six and Anthony did you get one when you got

[25:10] on a list six months ago John when did you ask your district to get on that list he said he got

[25:19] on the list too late I wanted to see it first but here's the thing Jay Jay you didn't even Jay

[25:33] Jay this is Jay this is the part that that's got to be killing you a little bit you you knew

[25:38] you were not going to lose money right like literally knew you did and here's the thing

[25:44] these games are now selling between five and eight thousand dollars on the second hand market no

[25:49] one's allowed to talk about that okay I want it would I want to announce something this is and I

[25:54] just want to I want to make this crystal clear caveat right now I have a friend this is not one

[26:01] this is not my game 999 this is not one of the five games spooky is giving to a

[26:06] Canadian club members I'm gonna I'm gonna reiterate this first the five games that Canadian club

[26:12] members are gonna have access to get are going for MSRP to those lucky people that get a chance to buy

[26:21] it I'm we're gonna do something fun to figure out how we allocate those five games I want them to

[26:27] go to people that never sell them and I want to make sure we find those people okay now there's that

[26:35] F spooky and this

[26:42] what do you mean show 800 games is a joke why why are you so much Stefano why you mad at spooky bro

[26:48] here's the thing I have someone who has asked me because he sees what these things are going

[27:00] for second hand market and he said canada chris I have a spot you know the game looks amazing

[27:11] like I'd be willing to accept offers if someone really wants to take my spot for me okay this isn't a

[27:18] guy that's like buying for and so I said look man like I think Pinside is taking down for sale ads

[27:27] I think we're living in a socialistic world now where people are not allowed to just I don't know

[27:31] like just see what the people might offer because he can here's this thing imagine this you have a spot

[27:36] you have one spot you paid two thousand dollars you're excited for Beetlejuice but someone puts

[27:40] $18,000 in front of you so you you're not allowed to on the spot that you have you know you didn't

[27:47] buy it to scout but the spot that you have all right man if you're willing to offer that much

[27:52] you can have my spot like I'll take it and maybe down the road I'll try to get the game again

[27:57] so like I don't understand why people are not allowed to do that so I literally like would love

[28:05] to know from people here why that's such a problem because if you just give it to the next guy

[28:10] and then what if he wants to sell it you're gonna stop you're gonna keep stopping everybody with a

[28:13] gun to their head that they're not allowed to do what they want with the thing that they bought

[28:18] they got online first they paid the deposit it's now their game once you pay deposit in my

[28:24] honest opinion it is now your game you know what I'm saying the dealer has his margin he has his

[28:30] money it's not refundable it's now your game to do what you want with if you want to like push

[28:35] it off the golden gate bridge you can't it's your game now you know if you buy it like I look at a

[28:46] new pin is like an IPO almost in a way like if you get a stock at $10 a share and all the sudden

[28:52] after the IPO it's worth like 20 and someone wasn't able to get in at 10 are you selling it to him

[28:58] for 10 or you selling it to him for 20 but juicy time here's the thing about this game I don't

[29:11] think they're gonna see this game ever this game is never gonna suffer anywhere close to 10

[29:16] it's never gonna suffer anywhere close to 10 it it is a I will tell you this I've been in this

[29:21] hobby for 12 years I've seen I've seen what this hobby does to games you gotta remember this

[29:26] never gonna be more than a thousand of these games never there's no more premiums there's no

[29:29] at least coming down the road they're never doing another rerun of this game never ever ever ever

[29:35] ever this is it you have to understand what that does to the significance of this value I mean

[29:41] there was even like a a worry for the longest time that pirates the Caribbean would be remade

[29:45] because Jersey Jack never said they would never make more spooky is on the record they will never

[29:50] make more you have to understand what that does there will never be more winch esters in the world

[29:58] okay so here's here's the thing here's the thing I have a Beatles you spot that a gentleman who has it

[30:07] would entertain offers on if you know somebody or you yourself find yourself in the

[30:15] financial situation in which you don't mind paying over for this game that is now impossible to get

[30:22] simply DM me or email me at canada pinball at gmail.com and I will

[30:34] float your offer in front of the individual see what happens and then you will have a spot and

[30:40] you will get a game it's that simple and I'm on the record you you're going through me you know

[30:45] it's 100% gonna be valid it like I'm a public figure I'm not ripping anybody off you know you don't

[30:51] have to worry like I'm as I always say this like whenever I've helped people scalp a game I've always

[30:56] said like look man like they're like how do I know it's like I'm like dude I Google me man I'm

[31:01] everywhere like I'm not some dude that's gonna rip you off who knows canada might be helping you

[31:06] get games down the road in the future are you guys have I teased this enough what I'm what I'm

[31:10] gonna be doing it's gonna be fun I can't wait I can't wait to convert a lot of you into potential

[31:15] canada customers one day it's gonna be fun we're gonna rock stuff up a little bit it's time it's

[31:20] time and I'm never stopping the podcast but I'm never becoming a show either you're gonna see everything

[31:24] that happens one life I live and it's time it's time for me to get in the game and get into the

[31:32] adult side of this hobby and to keep doing my show not be a shill but whatever if you guys

[31:38] want to get a game I'll help you get a game that's how it's gonna work and you're gonna see more

[31:42] on that in the future and I think it's gonna be fun and I think a lot of you are gonna who are

[31:46] canada club fans and members will absolutely enjoy placing in order with canada if you will

[31:52] because it's you're gonna see what you're gonna see how it's all gonna be anyway um you would say it

[31:59] to do but I'm not gonna be one of these bye bye bye that's not it's not how that's not how I'm

[32:03] gonna roll uh what did Walt do to get banned Walt did not get banned Walt's not banned Walt's not

[32:12] blocked Walt is not like Walt's not banned you know like I can we just put this whole Walt would

[32:19] thing to I have no I'll tell you what was happening I was literally out at a Japanese jazz bar I saw

[32:27] Walt joined the show then I'm home taking care of my kid he's like getting ready for like

[32:34] like you know like surgery the next day and I have no idea what happened I think he just like

[32:40] I don't know if he was like getting in a beef with people on the chat or the it auto moderate it

[32:45] time to mount all the added to is probably log out log back in and instead of doing that I don't

[32:50] know why Walt went and made a video that he was banned by canada which was not true and then he

[32:56] went and made another video after I kind of I got pissed at him for that because it's like dude

[33:00] what are you doing man like who who responds like this like I didn't block you and then he goes

[33:04] it makes a video that he's never making videos ever again so I mean talk about extreme reactions

[33:11] he's an extreme guy he makes extreme videos I love Walt's videos and I have no beef with Walt at

[33:16] whatsoever I love Walt I was so happy someone gifted him a membership to canada's pinball podcast

[33:21] and so if you know Walt or you speak to Walt Walt is not banned he's not blocked he's more

[33:27] than welcome to come back and everybody would would love to have him back in the chat and back in

[33:31] the club and that's it there's no drama like there's absolutely no drama so nothing was done

[33:35] the Walt Walt simply reacting in a way that I had no control over I can't control how someone's

[33:42] going to react to a glitch in the patreon like auto moderation bot which probably made of it might

[33:49] have just detected like too much behavior or I don't know if there was cursing going on I don't

[33:53] know I really don't know but you got to imagine like you know when you make a video without asking

[33:59] me what would happen I don't know it's hard for me to react to that in a positive way because it

[34:05] just it felt because what was weird is Walt was saying stuff like I'm not doing this for the clicks

[34:10] I'm not doing this for the views it's like you just made a you just made a video bro publicly

[34:15] facing video for the clicks and for the views without just checking with me first so that's the

[34:20] part that I'm like I just wish all content creators would realize like you do it for the views you do

[34:26] it for the clicks you do it for the attention I think there's nothing and this is not Walt this is

[34:31] just in general there's always this weird like canators a loser that just wants views and clicks I may

[34:36] content you jackass is that's what content creators are trying to get views clicks and subs and like

[34:44] the losers that always indict me for actually being successful in a nanoway in the very thing that

[34:51] this is meant for what do you think is we're here for and I always love I do it for free because I love

[34:56] the hobby that's cool one day when I'm done I'm gonna share with those guys who did it for free

[35:01] that I also love the hobby and I just I got just as much entertainment and enjoyment out of doing

[35:06] what they do I'm just making a lot more than they are because they they act like they're doing some

[35:11] you know like like they're studying cancer research like they're doing some greater good for

[35:14] society I think it's a cop out I think a lot of people are afraid to actually ask or go behind

[35:23] the paywall fully because I know it's gonna happen no one's gonna follow

[35:33] Stern is now offering hand jobs nice to see my audience as mature as ever fun clicks like

[35:39] socializing can a does it for the clicks and chicks well one chick branchy one chick

[35:47] yeah I do it for the bj's but I ain't talking about I love that like carry you know carry did turn

[35:53] it into like a crude joke but it's funny yeah I don't know like men men have humor that is a

[35:59] little inappropriate isn't that the whole point can we be inappropriate as men in the in today's day

[36:09] so if you know someone who's looking for a beetle juice let me tell you something to right now

[36:12] as someone who sold games to very wealthy collectors who are not on-pinside they usually deal with

[36:18] the distros like I know right now that like Melissa has tons of people needing a game so does Joe

[36:24] Newhart so does Zach so does everybody mad pamphlet everybody he might get automated Mike might get

[36:29] automated it's not even listing the games are for sale because he doesn't even want to deal with it

[36:33] he's getting a few but he's not listing it because he doesn't want to deal with people calling

[36:37] and they're all gone by the way so don't call them and ask for one I think it's really funny to me

[36:44] you know when you think about it like every time I've sold a game to someone let me tell you what

[36:49] they and and I mean like I I've sold games in excess of 7,000 8,000 over sticker for a game

[36:56] every time I've done it the person you bought it is just happy they're very wealthy it means

[37:04] nothing to them the same way like it also means nothing to a lot of people that lose three to

[37:08] five thousand dollars on these stern alleys they're very wealthy I mean some people have a quarter

[37:13] million dollars in a in Pimmel machines some people have half a million dollars in Pimmel machines

[37:18] it means nothing and and in the end isn't all that matters in a deal that the seller and the buyer

[37:25] are both happy he's happy he got a spot he paid over for it because he knows he missed out on

[37:32] the initial run he's paying a tax for not getting on the list early enough but he doesn't care

[37:40] but then you go on Pinside and you see these babies just these babies crying like they think

[37:46] they're entitled to that spot that they should have been given an opportunity to buy the game for

[37:52] sticker but it's just it blows my mind like the level of like manchild behavior around stuff like

[38:01] this and then you see these people exactly it's MSRP suggested retail price and then you see

[38:08] these people who are like they should make more that's the most annoying thing they should make more

[38:15] I should not have to be cranky because they can make more they don't want to make more they want

[38:20] to make the next game

[38:21] you know Dave you just said 100% people need to learn learn to lose again in life

[38:32] they need to learn that you don't always get the girl you want you can't always afford the car

[38:37] you want to have in your driveway that you're not always going to get the job you applied for

[38:41] that you're going to get rejected from the majority of colleges that when you get into that

[38:45] college you're not always going to get an age you know Harvard gave 60% of its students last year

[38:51] in a grade 10 years ago it was 20% and now that they realize that that doesn't work out with a

[38:59] normal grading scale they've announced that they're going to grade harder and now the students are

[39:05] all having meltdowns because they're not going to get an A that they'd never even deserved in the

[39:10] first place so you don't always get what you want you know and we when we when we got this house

[39:17] 48 couples were shown the house the same weekend we saw it we saw it first on a Friday 48 couples

[39:27] and we were the first appointment Friday because our realtor was also her agency was also

[39:32] sponsoring the seller which is a conflict of interest when you think about it and you know we

[39:38] saw the house and they said hey look like it's not going to go for this there's a lot of interest

[39:42] in this house we can find out a shut it down price as I find what's the shut it down price which

[39:48] means if you offer it it's yours I offered it but the seller was like all right I verbally accept

[39:54] their offer but I still will show it to 48 other couples just in case their offer falls through

[40:01] can't blame her for that in the meantime we came here we took pictures with Killian sitting at the

[40:06] barbren that was you know pregnant like we were all like hap you know just I mean I inundated

[40:13] this woman with like we are so excited to make this our family's home for the next like 30 years

[40:19] she shows it to 48 other couples she got five other offers on top of ours full cash offers

[40:27] ours had a you know a little mortgage full cash offers

[40:30] she still gave the house to us those 48 other couples they had to receive bad news they didn't get it

[40:44] you know they didn't you know sometimes it's just life's not fair the less than in this is be proactive

[40:51] do all you can but sometimes you're not always going to get what you want

[40:54] sad boy laws three thousand dollars last weekend I know what it means to listen sad boy all you

[41:01] got to do do give me the give me the three thousand dollars will play virtual poker for free

[41:08] and then I'll give you the money back no but like you know the the thing is this game is really special

[41:20] so the day oh let's talk about the game a little bit right I mean I've just been talking about everything but the game hold on I gotta get the charge or my computers about the die

[41:33] oh my sciatica you get old people

[41:37] oh I do the stretching today the way I sleeper sit on it I don't know what it is my sciatica I feel like an old man my sciatica

[41:47] my left legs sciatica right here right here just like right there right there it's just I know a stretch I

[41:57] gonna do stretches every day to open open it up but it's just kills it's only like when you kind of move in a certain way

[42:06] all right let's see you know I think when you see that day oh mode you're like wow

[42:20] and like when the worm is like getting into it to me that's it that's like the pinball moment

[42:29] that sold everybody on the game literally the pinball machine is grooving out like grooving with you

[42:36] but I it's like I don't if the game only did that that's still cooler than anything gnr does

[42:46] by the way um gnr is leaving the house and I've got a little bit of a quagmire because I did want my kids to grow up and like

[42:55] have it in their home one day I think I might you know store it somewhere with one of my

[43:03] local storage facility friends but did you have to give up your beetles you spot to your realtor

[43:16] I mean look the from everything I've heard from people that have played this game the modes are so much fun

[43:22] the game is so awesome the game shoots so well the game is just a masterpiece I tend to believe

[43:28] those I'm like yes of course little rose colored glasses but I just think this game is is

[43:33] special on a whole new level well Mike I don't want I don't want gnr up here anymore because you know

[43:39] it's gonna go next to beetle juice if I have two pins up here a little game called back to the

[43:44] future or sonic the hedgehog um they're doing back to the future slle's and um I will have a a few of

[43:55] them as well talk about if you thought that beetle juice was a was crazy to get

[44:06] back to the future and also the thing about back to the future is like

[44:12] I think it's just coin taker maybe someone else might have some some some copies I don't know

[44:19] maybe there might be any place to buy some games

[44:24] but everybody else doesn't have a Dutch I'm happy for coin taker they they stood by Dutch all

[44:28] those years they deserve to have this moment a lot of people you know did in and now want in on it

[44:39] you know we all know one you know you guys all know this right like spooky could

[44:43] assault every single one direct yesterday I mean I I'm not like I love my distro friends but

[44:50] spooky basically handed a million and a half dollars to two million dollars it need not

[44:56] used to need distros to like fine customers like they literally could assault every game direct

[45:06] how fast will back to the future be built

[45:08] not fast enough man we all know that

[45:15] you know in a weird in a weird world like I think a Dutch and spooky merger sounds like awesome

[45:24] can I can I whisper that again in a weird world I think a Dutch and spooky merger sounds pretty awesome

[45:32] I don't know something about Melvin and bug and Luke those three sound really cool together to

[45:41] my in my honest opinion I'm only selling toppers to him well back to the future I mean I know

[45:51] what the plans are I know it's in the game kind of not really and they have Michael J Fox

[45:58] france is on the artwork france you know this game isn't saying like I I continue to say

[46:07] where do they get the prince behind me I you know I need to find the artist's name I got them

[46:11] like 10 year maybe 15 years ago he did a run of these prints and I bought like so many of them

[46:19] I've got one I got a male to our friends over at a spooky

[46:23] spooky look in the house is he here where is he

[46:35] oh I love that the flippers flip to the beat of the song

[46:39] yeah

[46:47] f-boy I word is out and I am doing Dutch's next game and then wonder how being a sign deal with spooky

[46:52] yes it's true I'm doing yeah france like like I also think like joke hey you know Chris we know

[47:03] your relationship with Joe Camnicow and I think it's just it's good for pinball it's good for

[47:11] here's why it's good for pinball as we know like if france is gonna do this one game with Dutch

[47:16] sign on before the deal with spooky and we you know by dutch's track record they do one game every

[47:22] 12 years so it'll be fine you're not gonna get oversaturated with france's art elsewhere

[47:29] um I but france you get sold man I just got out of bed bug I love you brother um you missed

[47:42] a really energetic show you have to go back and watch this but um you know what happened

[47:47] yesterday is a is it is a changing of the guard it is a rude awakening because it's just like

[47:55] you know it's like I don't think there's a better analogy that then once you see the light

[48:00] and once you are given something of such tremendous value and passion it's hard to go back

[48:06] and buy the alternative that is just not as good and I think stern underestimated that I think

[48:12] they thought that they could just keep clobbering us with with like because they can manufacture

[48:17] quickly that we would just keep buying from them because we were just addicted to it like it was

[48:21] crack and you know now there's just a better drug in town than that everybody wants and it's not

[48:28] what they're serving up and the stern apologists you know like I think what stern like and I don't

[48:34] have any like I think stern made some of the greatest games in the history of him all if not the best

[48:38] games in the history of him all but it does it just is starting to feel like their time is up a

[48:45] little bit that they got so big and too many committees and and they're rushing everything and

[48:52] as an organization they don't they don't work together to make every game the best game they can

[48:58] make can you imagine if Porsche use a card analogy if Porsche as an organization like had like

[49:07] really bad 9-11s mixed in with other 9-11s no it's like they make sure that they get it right

[49:12] and I think that's what everyone's kind of tired of with stern is like not only are they getting it

[49:19] wrong they're just like they get it really wrong and then they get lazy and just do remakes and it's

[49:24] just just feeling like I don't want to be a part of this anymore yeah Carl they become complacent

[49:31] like did you hear from anyone over there yesterday you know what I would have done if I was stern

[49:35] yesterday if I was George Gomez if I was Seth Davis I would have made a statement you know yesterday

[49:40] we saw on the release of spooky pinball's beetle juice we saw the tremendous excitement and

[49:46] enthusiasm this community has for this machine I called a meeting with my leadership team yesterday

[49:53] and I made them all look at this game as as an example of what you know every game leaving our

[50:01] factory what needs to be and they would never say this you know what I'm saying because it's like

[50:06] an admission that someone made something spectacular but that's the truth and I think stern is at

[50:17] a position right now where they need a little humbleness they need a little empathy they need a

[50:23] little they need to build bridges back to people and I think they're going about at the opposite

[50:28] way I think they're still air again I've heard from what I've heard conversations that stern

[50:32] employees have had with operators in districts yesterday and it is still chock full of arrogance it is

[50:38] chock full of like screw those little guys it is chock full of like you know what like we're like we're

[50:43] like it's laughable like those numbers like what we like they don't get it they don't get it

[50:50] they're they're arrogance the blowhard nature and I think they're I think they're they're under

[50:56] tremendous pressure but they're they're pushing back with the wrong mentality

[51:13] how much commission does canada get on sales and chat I think I get most of the the money that

[51:22] puts into the super chats here so if you want to give some super chat money kelly I love it

[51:28] Mustang doesn't try to build better than Ferrari they're fine with being a Mustang

[51:35] you know carry that's actually not true man but Mustang just made a $380,000 car you know

[51:40] this so carry like if you're going to use a car you're Mustang actually just made the GTD

[51:46] they're like race car that is actually trying to take down the Porsche GT3RS so like

[51:54] but yeah when they do they you know it's sold out too

[52:02] gale's analogy let me

[52:04] uh

[52:09] what look

[52:11] gang Jamie needs me on the roundtable I'm not going to watch kale on the roundtable talk to

[52:17] Jamie and Ralph like I literally talk to kale myself but I you know I'm not going to spend an hour

[52:25] watching or 90 minutes watching three dudes talk about stuff that I'd spend most of my day talking

[52:31] about because I know what I'm saying like I know they're not coming to I'll happily join the same

[52:36] way I'll join jeng is in dawn I have side conversations all day long now with jeng is in dawn it's

[52:42] great where where everyone's getting along great um I've side conversations with Ralph's the one

[52:48] where you know I there's not proactively talking to me really like we we we bird the hatchet but

[52:53] I'll join the show but I'm not I'm not gonna yeah I'm again like I'm not gonna sit down and watch like

[52:59] everything happening it's too much too much because I'm already doing I'm like I'm in the go mode like

[53:04] I'm making you know the I'm saying the same stuff let's be honest I'm like no one's like oh man

[53:09] Beetlejuice like they really flopped it

[53:19] congrats to spooky and crew Beetlejuice would have been fun to make but I'm glad this crew made

[53:24] like damn jack danger of course jack jack isn't it crazy how like we were all happy when

[53:31] Stern got Godzilla and not spooky and now four and a half years later we're happy that spooky

[53:36] God Beetlejuice and that's stern oh man I think I think there's gonna be a shake up I think

[53:44] there's gonna be a shake up of where talent falls in pinball in 2026 I think all the talents

[53:50] gonna end up at American pinball I'm joking you know it's he-man people right they they they

[54:00] have the he-man license and it's he-man and I don't know what happened man like what Mukesh like

[54:05] went to expo and like how are they back back on um but you know it would be awesome is a jack danger

[54:13] he-man if he went over to American pinball like I think jack needs it's not he-man franchise said

[54:19] okay I trust franche because franche knows so it's not he-man okay well there you go I love

[54:27] franche here because everyone's in a while like he fact checks me I'm bringing Zidware back dude

[54:35] totally make the Zidware kiss game that is like unsuitable

[54:48] yeah it's gonna be Beetlejuice's barbecue challenge I don't know man I just think like

[54:56] Steve Bowden's rule sets are just the greatest the world's ever seen when you hear Steve

[55:00] Bowden talk about Barrio's barbecue challenge I literally fall back in my chair and play dead

[55:06] oh my second worst to that is Steve Bowden's Raza rule set which just makes you also want to fall

[55:11] back in your chair and play dead now look Raza is coming out Raza's 333 Raza will be more expensive

[55:19] than Beetlejuice and Raza's gonna sell out I mean I've seen Raza gang I just again like I think

[55:25] if Winchester sells out Raza's gonna sell out like you're you're gonna see all these games are

[55:32] just phenomenal worlds under glass hey what time is the uh am I missing like is there any footage of

[55:42] this uh Barrel's factory tour today I worked with J-pop at Zidware the same time Jeremy did I did

[55:52] animations for Magic Girl really did you really I didn't know that Jack I really did not know that

[56:00] are there any animations in Magic Girl I had the game where they all go

[56:08] does Alice really shoot like crap um no Alice doesn't shoot like crap Alice just doesn't have a lot

[56:17] to shoot at and Alice code is is is is not very thorough you know remember it's like

[56:25] Melbourne does not have a team really working on this code like other companies do

[56:32] Raza will be last ever produced J-pop game um hopefully yeah I can't believe that people aren't

[56:42] like aren't Stern super depressed yesterday I know if I would um I I

[56:48] you know Jack were you were you over at Stern yesterday what was the mood like I mean sorry we got

[56:53] we got somebody who works there here Jack what was the mood like Jack correct the pluses correct

[56:57] the correct us I can't speak today correct us if we're wrong Jack was there not a walking dead

[57:05] stream scheduled for yesterday because I could have sworn that that date was put out an

[57:12] externally communicated by Stern did that change or was that date never even said by Stern so

[57:20] I'm just I just didn't know if you know since you have more line of sight internally over there

[57:29] what I love about Jack too is Jack Jack's just like a different suburnal realm like we're glad he's

[57:34] over there he's one of us you know like no matter what happens Jack will never go now with like any

[57:41] Stern decision making he's always gonna be one of us I'm the guy that typically asked to set the

[57:48] cameras up and I wasn't aware okay I could have sworn there was like a date by Stern is anyone

[57:57] know where that came from why won't the new marketing guy get in the community like can you

[58:07] imagine if you're the new Stern CMO now like yesterday you're like today's the day I'm gonna go

[58:12] live and I'm gonna introduce the walking dead code you know today's the day I'm gonna win people

[58:16] over the problem is now with this new Stern CMO is the more time he delays the more difficult

[58:23] it's gonna be for him yeah I kind of feel like I don't know if he's waiting for like a moment to

[58:28] say was his moment right like oh yeah like I made Pokemon or I made Transformers like here's

[58:34] you know I don't know I don't know I think he's more of a CMO that's doing back channel deals with

[58:41] retailers I think his job is to expand Stern's presence in places like Walmart and Costco and Amazon

[58:49] and China and whatever their plans are I think he he is not hired to be a consumer facing

[58:57] marketing personality or entity Jesse I agree they said game play on the 14th

[59:06] make the Stern CMO played 100 tournaments all been I you like I know these guys watch all this

[59:18] stuff like I it's got it has to be annoying for them so wake up and know that canate is at it again

[59:26] and he's wearing a spooky shirt and he's got six beetle juice games and grown men are willing to

[59:34] give him bj's to get a bj like literally you guys there these guys are acting like the dude in

[59:39] that fire festival documentary trying to unlock all those bottles of water so as I said earlier

[59:47] we have 122 people here I do have a friend who's selling a spot not for MSRP he's looking for money

[59:53] over and if you want a beetle juice game and you want to go to bed tonight with a spot that you

[59:59] are guaranteed to get a game let me know it's not my game it's not one of the spooky six games I'm

[01:00:05] getting so you know don't go run into spooky saying canate is scouting one of his games I'm simply

[01:00:11] simply helping someone who does not want to face the wrath and the vitriol of the pin-side mob and

[01:00:17] he's just willing to see what people might offer for his spot he's not a scalper he's not trying to

[01:00:23] he's just saying hey if you're willing to take my spot for this much maybe it's yours that's it

[01:00:29] he's an opportunistic individual and he's a good guy and I won't ever say who he is

[01:00:37] it's the floor model let's see if anybody emailed me I'm gonna go look right now curious

[01:00:45] so gang are you allowed to post a four-sale spot on pin-side that's a beetle juice spot

[01:00:51] I wasn't sure all right I got an email already here beetle juice entry info

[01:01:01] Chris did you announce how you will be collecting interest for entertaining a chance to buy the

[01:01:08] canate of beetle juice game I will keep listening but did not hear I think I saw on one show but

[01:01:18] maybe not sure can't wait for the spectacular chat chat well chat I have not

[01:01:26] we're gonna do it differently this time it is not gonna be just names out of a hat like to me

[01:01:32] that's like boring boring it's like it doesn't that before and it's like got like a little

[01:01:38] it's just it doesn't it doesn't create good content it doesn't create a moment I want to do

[01:01:44] something much more memorable and I think I'm gonna do one at a time so we're not gonna do all

[01:01:49] five at once and I want each one to become a moment now remember we've got until January until

[01:01:54] this game goes on the line you know talking with the folks who have read spooky I think these

[01:01:59] canate of five might be one of the earlier builds you know to what happens when you know the company

[01:02:04] and you know the mayors of the of the city you you kind of get front of the line service I don't

[01:02:10] think they're gonna be it then now my 999 is gonna be the last game they ever make a beetle juice

[01:02:16] I'm gonna I demand that of them I demand it is made after the show games I demand it is it is the

[01:02:23] I want to I actually want to go to Benton Wisconsin when 999 rolls off the line I want to be

[01:02:31] there I want to hug babies kiss babies hold dogs I want I want to have a whole moment you know

[01:02:38] maybe they'll do a little something special for the final game for canada I don't know I don't

[01:02:41] know maybe they will never selling the game 999 stay in forever so whatever they do whatever we

[01:02:50] want to do gold plate the damn thing we'll see but I want to go to that I want to go to that line

[01:02:56] and I want to like shake hands with everybody I want everybody at spooky to sign under the play

[01:02:59] field or whatever they they can sign it like I just think it's a moment canate a midnight

[01:03:05] launch party oh that maybe left so much is said I should get Todd Tucky to throw the five

[01:03:14] canada editions off the roof you know it's funny gang is I bet if I had like a YouTube channel

[01:03:23] and and it was all about throwing each new stir machine off of Todd Tucky's roof I bet we could

[01:03:29] get enough people to pay to see that so not only just pay for the game but to then like each

[01:03:36] of us can make some good money for that amazing content I 100% if we're like we're gonna toss

[01:03:42] a Star Wars Ellie off the roof literally we could raise 13,000 I think I think we could easily get

[01:03:51] more than 13,000 dollars donated to see that moment

[01:03:59] hot pink armor on pito juice number 999 that's interesting I'm not sure how that would look

[01:04:08] might go might go well with the caller package

[01:04:13] okay you realize the last game will be on the line when the following game is on the line yeah

[01:04:17] I know that Eric and I will be in on the next game and hopefully get more than five next time

[01:04:23] so I'm not I'm absolutely I know that

[01:04:29] um

[01:04:33] did anyone order walking dead Ali like I publicly are you like are you

[01:04:39] nobody is nobody's listening here are you like are you okay to like admit it did anyone

[01:04:42] hear like actually order walking dead Ali other than Iceman and Neil McRae did anyone actually

[01:04:48] pop down 13,000 for that game

[01:04:54] I know Niels got one in Iceman I mean they got 498 more to sell

[01:05:00] anybody francey dead

[01:05:14] Dan Dan did you

[01:05:19] wasn't orange enough for me I mean

[01:05:24] well I'm going to talk to bug in Luke about this because they have um I think what they need to

[01:05:33] do is revisit the fan club in the right way and I think they need to create um their own

[01:05:38] internal list of of a guarantee spot for the next game I think they need to sell that

[01:05:43] I think they need to sell for a lot more than 50 bucks now we're gonna we're gonna I'm gonna talk

[01:05:47] with them Luke I'm gonna look let's talk this week I think you guys are in a very

[01:05:52] uh great position to create a real spooky loyalty club that is like a membership if you will

[01:05:58] but like real not 50 bucks bullshit bro like you come on these guys are making thousands of

[01:06:03] dollars in value like let's let's really create like a a true fan club that you know

[01:06:13] allows these rich dudes to sleep at night knowing they're gonna get a game

[01:06:17] you guys are just I over like I don't it's not overnight you know I always say this like your

[01:06:24] success hasn't been anything but overnight your success has been over a decade of hard work

[01:06:30] of listening to feedback of getting better of constantly improving constantly listening to

[01:06:35] feedback hard work blood sweat tears late nights late weekends miss vacations you know miss

[01:06:43] family obligations getting it to where it is today like not you have to think about it seems like

[01:06:49] overnight you know yeah you make 10 million dollars in sales in one day not because of something

[01:06:55] that happened overnight and so all the hard work all the like you know and hearing like bug and

[01:07:01] Luke talk in the feature at about how they just know they just know what you know how to take things

[01:07:08] further how to push things you know in a new direction how to how to not just accept for like

[01:07:14] mediocrity it's just it's everything people want here so like what I really think you know Luke you

[01:07:18] guys are now in a unique situation where you're now on a level that nobody else really is and it's

[01:07:28] beautiful it's and I always said this to Luke as like the challenge now is like don't get greedy

[01:07:34] but get like like figure out how to like now like it's now it's just about finessing and and

[01:07:43] sort of like polishing a few of the things that are what your brand is all about and figuring out a

[01:07:51] right way to do it now I would argue not much needs to change there this is not a time to change

[01:07:58] much you don't change much of the price you don't need to change much it is beautiful to witness this

[01:08:05] um you know there's always been this saying just because you could do something doesn't mean you

[01:08:09] should and I think turns the opposite I think because they could charge 20,000 for James Bond's

[01:08:14] sixth year they did because they could make more James Bond toppers when they said they would

[01:08:19] and they did because they could rerun Ellie's again even though they said they would never they did

[01:08:26] it's a company that's never going to make more beetle juice games that that is that is a beautiful

[01:08:33] that is a beautiful thing no 500 all but see the thing is franchy 500 allers to join a

[01:08:47] fan club to get a guarantee of the next game that's not greedy greedy would be $5,000

[01:08:54] which is what people are getting man I just want to say this right now I know we're not allowed

[01:08:59] to say this on the second hand market these games are now trading for five to eight thousand

[01:09:03] dollars over 10 over I mean it's also like you know day one is always like a big you know

[01:09:10] FOMO day these I've said like dude it's it's not rocket science evil debts are going for 15 16,000

[01:09:17] so Winchester's are going for 15 16,000 if evil debt goes for 15,000 dollars beetle juice is

[01:09:23] going to settle every one of them is going to settle permanently around 15 to 18,000 dollars

[01:09:42] evil debt is at 15 now

[01:09:44] I don't know elemental we're I don't know where you're looking

[01:09:58] so so I want to answer this right now Joe Joe Tech Bob said nobody would pay 500 allers

[01:10:07] unless it went towards the deposit I'm here to tell you right now Joe Bob you're 100% wrong

[01:10:14] you're 100% wrong

[01:10:18] Joe do you know how like country clubs work you you pay $20,000 a year it doesn't go towards your

[01:10:25] food doesn't go towards your golf outing doesn't go towards your tips doesn't go towards anything

[01:10:32] it just allows you to get into the club and then everything else you buy you have to pay full price

[01:10:39] if spooky were to offer I'm just gonna say is running if they were to offer

[01:10:44] 200 VIP fan club memberships of $500 a pop which guaranteed you the next game they would

[01:10:51] that those would sell out instantly gang y'all y'all will spend $500 on two rooms to go to

[01:10:59] freaking pinball expo which is boring after a couple hours

[01:11:03] you'll spend $500 for two nights stay in Schlomburg Illinois

[01:11:12] which is then gone for good after two hours at the show your board you're saying that people

[01:11:19] would not spend $500 to get their get access to the next spooky game that's going to be worth

[01:11:24] 50% more money instantly they would sell out of every spot instantly

[01:11:30] doesn't have to go to doesn't have to go towards the game you're just a member and gang

[01:11:37] literally I go out to eat I go out to eat lunch every lunch now every lunch now is $150

[01:11:51] some people sign up

[01:11:53] why would you kill the goodwill Mike why would you kill the goodwill I don't why would that kill goodwill

[01:12:08] I don't I don't understand why they would kill the goodwill they're not ripping anybody off

[01:12:15] they're just giving the people what they want

[01:12:23] yeah

[01:12:29] wow look maybe they should just make it a hundred percent fair and just sell every game direct

[01:12:34] why not just sell every game direct first come first serve wouldn't that be the most fair

[01:12:38] would that create the best goodwill sell every game direct and then you then it's then it's

[01:12:46] like first come first serve I don't know seems like it would be a nightmare but I don't know

[01:12:57] I don't know I think I don't think they're gonna do it it's fine it's fine it's you know

[01:13:04] it's not who they are I get it I get it but you know I come from a different place I come from

[01:13:09] New York City I come from a place where like you know that's chump chains to just have access to

[01:13:13] something of course the audio is better here I'm I'm talking to you through a five-hundred-dollar

[01:13:21] microphone versus a phone mic I don't know why anyone would be on Facebook and not on YouTube I

[01:13:27] I don't get it it's also the camera's not flipped on on YouTube it's so much better to watch this I

[01:13:34] would love it if everyone just watched on YouTube it makes it easier for me

[01:13:40] whatever anyone does in this or any other hobbies someone is going to piss and moan about it

[01:13:47] let's let's go to Pinside real quick I want to read some of the the babies they're so fun to

[01:13:53] read literally they're like let me smooth this over a little bit let's go yeah of course the

[01:14:00] Beatles use hype threads at the top let's see let's go latest I mean credibly

[01:14:09] disappointed to not see crazy levy in this thread explaining that if Pinsiders ran a pinball

[01:14:14] business it would fail miserably I love this it's comical to see so many people's opinion on how

[01:14:24] spooky should run their business model and sales approach for a couple of young kids who are

[01:14:29] sitting on multi-million dollar business valuation I think they're doing quite fine if anyone has

[01:14:36] a better business strategy it's a free market so set up your own pinball business from scratch

[01:14:40] and start pumping out 10,000 games a year easy enough I would think well they're not doing 10,000

[01:14:45] games a year 1000 games a year I think oh I think $10,000 games a year okay in the last loser kid

[01:14:54] podcast bug talks about creating value for the customer due to scarcity has people really been

[01:15:01] asking on spooky for years it must have watched the wrong form what is so childish this is a

[01:15:08] discussion forum if you have a company with a product 3000 people want to buy but there is only

[01:15:13] 1000 product how do you sort that how does it work with who gets a game are you moving into

[01:15:21] Porsche territory where you have to take heavy losses on five or six standard cars these people

[01:15:27] are such idiots like what were these people talking about they the thing with porches gang as you

[01:15:33] you they can go up hundreds of thousands of dollars they and your distributors can play this

[01:15:41] anyway they want but what they but why not be open about it then you will not have any potential

[01:15:48] buyers being frustrated see here's the problem with these people and this is doctor pin

[01:15:53] you're always going to disappoint some people and it's okay like this whole notion of like oh we

[01:16:02] have to make sure everybody's happy everybody has a fair shot everybody like let's just stop

[01:16:07] just not the way the world works the way the world works is this they're going to allocate games to

[01:16:13] distros those distros can sell those games to whoever they want based on relationships they have with

[01:16:21] customers that they've they've developed spook is going to sell 70 games directly everybody else

[01:16:29] it's it's it's your job to try to find a distro that has an allocation it's much like a car

[01:16:35] dealership you don't buy directly from Porsche why should they feel bad or try to make it because

[01:16:46] you're there's no way to make amends with the thousands of people that can't get one ever

[01:16:57] you didn't get your pimps this is not a cancer drug that these people need to live

[01:17:03] they're not price gouging the product i don't understand you didn't get one you didn't you didn't

[01:17:12] try hard enough

[01:17:17] what is it like having a pedophile protector as a role model for what are you talking about

[01:17:32] who's a role model for my kids is the pedophile i don't even know these people talking about these

[01:17:36] people are weird

[01:17:38] you

[01:17:44] exactly jesse you keep your ear to the ground you pay attention and you won't miss out

[01:17:53] look at this guy says maybe they can have an open subscription where the thousand most

[01:17:56] preferred customers gets the next game and if one bells there's something i'm

[01:18:00] all right all right here we go

[01:18:11] they created phomo intentionally only to have 75 available on launch they proves that maybe

[01:18:17] released no they had more than 70 they oh my god

[01:18:23] this guy's if i'm spooky i don't even go on pin side anymore like i don't even go on pin side for a month

[01:18:36] if i'm spooky i'm finishing the evil deads i'm flying to hawaii i'm taking a nice holiday and then

[01:18:46] starting production of beetle juice these losers are really just that they are grown babies

[01:18:54] they got locked out and you know what i would do you know what i would do if i missed out

[01:19:04] and it was ten thousand dollars and i really wanted it i'd offer somebody 15

[01:19:10] i wouldn't go on pin side i'm like they need to fix their business no i missed out

[01:19:15] the market value is higher i'm gonna offer it that's what that's what that's what a grown man does

[01:19:20] put on your big boy pants and if you really want the game you don't you it's now worth more than

[01:19:27] 10 it's never gonna you've missed out on the initial ip of the game price put on your big boy pants

[01:19:34] and make an offer stop winding like a baby stop telling them how to do their business stop trying

[01:19:40] to come up with socialistic ways to make it fair for everybody stop you sound stupid no one has

[01:19:47] any empathy for poor people who does anyone feel sorry for the poor guy that has to buy six

[01:19:52] porches to get access to the really rare one who gives a shit about those multi-millionaires nobody

[01:19:59] nobody

[01:20:03] like seriously nil McRage is posted on facebook that he's looking to go test a i don't know if he's

[01:20:07] joking or not a 15 million euro boat 15 million euro boat

[01:20:16] do you feel bad if nil has to pay 5,000 over for something

[01:20:22] if people wake up like why don't we're all doing but wake up open your eyes it's 2025

[01:30:17] give me a thousand bucks for my spot like so he saved the thousand dollars I lost a thousand

[01:30:25] dollars on Ultraman deposit I'm not always right I speculate but this was a no brainer gang

[01:30:34] of course I was speculating on Star Wars and walking dead I didn't think Stern would keep

[01:30:38] putting out such crap I thought they'd wake up and actually make a freaking awesome game this year

[01:30:43] they just seem incapable of that but of course I was never speculating on Beatles you said I knew

[01:30:49] this thing was crazy the same things gonna happen if they have Gremlins or Goonies or anything 80s 90s

[01:30:55] nostalgia stupid it's over like take my money now like Franchi just just tell killing and cast

[01:31:01] they're not going to college I'm spending all my money on Franchi spooky games I wish I could post

[01:31:08] a meme in here

[01:31:13] because that's what anyway gang look to the babies who waited like I think most people are not babies

[01:31:23] most people are not going on pin-side whining and crying you know like again money talks

[01:31:30] welcome to the modern world I need to buy new tires for my Dodge demon okay want to hear something

[01:31:36] I need to buy new tires for my Dodge demon there's only one set available because they don't make

[01:31:42] him anymore there's only one with the demon logo on them available for sale on pin-side sorry what I

[01:31:49] say pin-side on eBay ironically guess how much they are for four tires people that are gonna

[01:31:57] wear through and then never be good again and I don't even know if they're great now because

[01:32:01] six years old and tires do crack and not you know the life of a tire is like 10 years

[01:32:09] $5,000 the guy wants for them am I gonna cry like a baby that's not fair you bought them for like

[01:32:16] 400 bucks each you only spent like $2,000 on them why don't why you want why you know you don't

[01:32:23] deserve to have them you're not using a shut up everybody I might pay the $5,000 just to get the

[01:32:30] damn tires because I don't have any other options there's a new needle that's not the same tire it's

[01:32:34] not I don't know something about keeping the demon tire on the demon that just is appealing and

[01:32:40] like it's stupid I could buy a comparable tire for $2,000 but maybe I want to spend more and

[01:32:46] just have the damn demon logos on them so if you want to beatle juice and you're not a baby I got

[01:32:55] a guy I got a guy that is willing to entertain in offer from you now these spots are gonna go

[01:33:03] most of these games will not be scalped I don't think you're gonna see 100 beetle juices change

[01:33:08] hand or 50 I think people are gonna hold onto this game for a very long time I think this is

[01:33:13] the modern day Adams family I think this is gonna be the cornerstone and the linchpin and

[01:33:17] everybody's collection moving forward I think it raised the bar I think it's a game in which all

[01:33:22] new games will be compared to and I think everybody else is gonna just get better because this

[01:33:28] game is gonna force everybody to make better games better themes better theme integration better

[01:33:33] personality better magic better everything and damn good that that's happening this is good for

[01:33:39] everybody seems like you would buy a set of tires to dive to drive on and set of demon tires to

[01:33:46] hang on to now the problem is you don't want to just hang on I had like I had a spare set of

[01:33:52] demon tires my friend and my freaking buddy moved houses and threw him out he threw him out he didn't

[01:33:57] even call me and tell me to come get him he was like upset his dad passed away he moved houses

[01:34:02] and you know I look I get it was in a weird situation because dad dies he moves houses

[01:34:07] and I feel bad but dude just call me up I would have came and got them

[01:34:11] and it's like it put me in a really weird and then he's like dude I'll take you out the dinner

[01:34:15] like dude they're $5,000 like take me out the dinner like I don't know I just it is what it is man

[01:34:21] like life's too short like I don't know I sometimes you got to like real you got to let things go

[01:34:26] and it just is what it is I snipe the tires I don't want you can have a bed everybody like have

[01:34:35] a great great Saturday congratulations to everybody over at spooky Stern you got some work to do

[01:34:42] I know it's coming from Jersey Jack and they're gonna be just fine I know it's coming from

[01:34:47] Dutch Pimbal they're gonna be just fine I think Pimbal Brothers isn't trouble I think

[01:34:51] Padredi's in trouble I think Pimbal Adventures isn't trouble I think American Pimbal's return

[01:34:57] is not gonna be anything special I think barrels is fine I think David just needs to keep making

[01:35:04] you know around this many games I think David needs to look at themes that like like like

[01:35:09] Bloodsport like Fist of the North Star like you know Akira big trouble in China

[01:35:16] Last Starfighter Transformers GI Joe you know and he'll be fine I think you know Dune was just like

[01:35:23] Now we don't want the contemporary things we want the nostalgic things and I think David realizes that

[01:35:29] everybody be good and I will be back this week with podcasts

[01:35:38] And hey stay tuned for how I'm gonna handle those five spooky games of Beetlejuice I've not

[01:35:45] figured it out yet so don't worry you haven't missed out on any way to enter okay because I'm seeing

[01:35:50] emails and people asking me how I'm handling them so just don't worry and I and again I'm not

[01:35:54] selling these or scalping them to the highest offer I mean I could easily do that

[01:35:59] should I project Pimbal these things and get like $30,000 for each one and then you know

[01:36:03] No, not doing it later
