[00:13] CELESTIA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA

[00:17] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:20] What's happening here? I thought everybody cancelled and moved over to somewhere else.

[00:23] Uh oh, we're actually climbing in subscriptions.

[00:26] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[00:27] So here we go on this episode. I asked a very simple question.

[00:31] I asked, since Godzilla Pinball has been put out into the world,

[00:35] has there been other pinball mechanisms over the last two years

[00:40] that have delivered some pinball magic?

[00:43] Some mechanisms that really showed some real creativity?

[00:47] Some mechanisms that interact with the ball and do something you've never seen before?

[00:52] Remember everybody, over the last two years,

[00:55] pinball as a whole has been the most expensive it's ever been.

[01:00] So surely a question like this would come back with a ton

[01:06] of amazing mechanisms, amazing creativity, amazing mechanical engineering.

[01:11] We have so many pinball machines that have come out since Godzilla.

[01:15] And now that pinball is between $7,000 and $15,000,

[01:20] are we at a loss of words?

[01:22] Are there a ton of mechanisms that came out since then

[01:25] that have been wowing us?

[01:27] That have created pinball moments you can't wait to show your friends and family about?

[01:31] We're going to talk about that on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:34] I'm going to talk about some of your responses

[01:37] and then I'm going to give you my overall opinion about it all

[01:40] because this is why you come to Canadian Pinball Podcast

[01:43] because I'm not just shilling everything that goes on in pinball.

[01:46] I'm not just doing jumping jacks as this entire hobby goes through the price ceiling.

[01:51] It's like nobody really wants to stop and just analyze

[01:55] what's going on in this hobby, what's really going on in this hobby.

[01:59] And that is why you're here.

[02:00] All right, but before we get into this topic, there are a couple of news items of the day.

[02:05] There are two new pinball machines coming into the world.

[02:08] Actually, there's three of them.

[02:09] The first one is going to be a game I've been telling you about for a really long time.

[02:13] Padredy Gaming and Planetary Pinball are going to release a remake of a classic game.

[02:20] I think it's going to be Twilight Zone.

[02:22] It's either Twilight Zone, I think, or Big Bang Bar.

[02:25] But here's the weird part.

[02:26] I'm hearing that Brian Allen is doing the artwork for this remake.

[02:30] So that makes me think it's not Twilight Zone

[02:33] because they're not going to redo the artwork for Twilight Zone with Brian Allen's style artwork.

[02:38] And it also makes me believe it's never going to be Big Bang Bar

[02:41] because that art package is amazing.

[02:44] You wouldn't touch that art package with a 10-foot pole.

[02:47] So here's my guess of what I think Brian Allen

[02:51] and Padredy Gaming is going to remake.

[02:54] Now, there are two games where the art packages aren't the best.

[02:58] And I know Brian Allen's done a ton of translates for all of these Baldy Williams games.

[03:03] My two guesses are going to be a remake of Whitewater and a remake of Fishtails.

[03:10] Now, do we want more Whitewaters or Fishtails in the pinball world?

[03:14] The problem is the code on both of those games will not be appealing to modern pinball audiences.

[03:20] I feel like both of these games are really fun to play on location.

[03:23] But would you want to own one?

[03:25] Would you want to put it into your home?

[03:27] I have no idea if that's the theme, but I don't think we're going to have to wait very long.

[03:30] I think we're going to see this game unveiled at Pinball Expo in about a month.

[03:35] We also got another teaser from that mysterious pinball company

[03:39] that is making a licensed pinball machine.

[03:42] We saw an image of an LCD screen with the back box open

[03:47] and fast pinball boards being used in the game.

[03:50] We saw a blurry image in that LCD reflection of the play field.

[03:55] We saw a lot of wire forms.

[03:57] Now, I can tell you this.

[03:58] Oh, we also saw some aprons, some dark red aprons that are hanging after being painted.

[04:04] And so this game, I'm telling you right now, this game is going to be a licensed theme game.

[04:10] It is not going to be a remake.

[04:13] Now, what will it be?

[04:15] I'm just going to go out on a limb.

[04:17] I'm going to go out on a crazy limb and say that I think this game might be the Goonies.

[04:23] I know someone said they saw like a reflection of like a skull and crossbone.

[04:27] I'm not sure I saw that in the blurry image, but we know that the Goonies license is available.

[04:33] We know that Deeproot had it years ago, but it's been over two years since Deeproot collapsed.

[04:39] So maybe these gentlemen saw that that license was available and went to go make it.

[04:45] I could be completely wrong.

[04:47] This is just a guess.

[04:48] So don't go making other shows.

[04:50] How can it is always wrong?

[04:51] This is not anything I'm confirming, but this is another game where I think we're going to see it really soon.

[04:57] I'm kind of over all of these teasers.

[05:00] Like the teaser was like now that Labor Day is over, the real work begins.

[05:04] I do think it is kind of crazy that there are more pinball companies throwing their hat into the ring.

[05:11] When I go down this list of games over the last two years since Godzilla, it's going to jump out at you.

[05:17] Just how many pinball companies there are, how few games have been magical, how much effort is going into this hobby,

[05:26] and there's not that much greatness happening.

[05:30] You all know this.

[05:31] You all know this.

[05:32] Nobody really wants to say this.

[05:34] It's like there's Keith Elwin games.

[05:36] There's some very enjoyable pinball coming from Stern, but it's way overpriced.

[05:41] Same with Jersey Jack pinball.

[05:42] It's not that Godfather's not any good.

[05:44] It's just an $8,000 game that they want us to spend like $12,000 or $15,000 for.

[05:50] That ruins the equation.

[05:52] As Kaneda always says, a quarter pounder with cheese is really delicious for like $6.

[06:00] It's still really delicious, but if they ask $30 for it, you're not buying one ever.

[06:06] All right, so we got that mystery game coming as well.

[06:09] And then we saw from Tilt Bob pinball, we saw a teaser image of Road Trip Pinball,

[06:15] which looks like an art package that was designed by a third grader.

[06:20] And I'm really confused.

[06:21] Now, this was the gentleman who did elf pinball that he's been bringing around to the shows.

[06:26] He's making this game for commercial release.

[06:29] I think the plan is to make four of these for Texas Pinball Festival.

[06:33] And I'm just here to tell you right now, Tilt Bob, I don't know how many you want to make of these,

[06:38] but if you're going to make this game with that artwork and I get it,

[06:43] I get what you're going for some campy, all original thing.

[06:46] I think as long as you don't want to sell more than 25 of these, I think you're in good shape.

[06:52] But if you want to sell more than 25 of a game that looks like this in the modern pinball era,

[06:58] there's only two things that will help you out.

[07:00] If this game is $3,000 or if this game is $2,000,

[07:05] because there's just no way you're going to ask people to spend like five, six, seven thousand dollars on this kind of game.

[07:12] When there are like 12 pinball companies, most of them releasing licensed property games.

[07:18] It's a big difference from making a homebrew game based on a Christmas movie everybody loves.

[07:24] And then you go and make this.

[07:26] I get it's a passion project.

[07:27] I get it.

[07:28] But the moment you want to start asking customers for money,

[07:32] are you making something that has any market research whatsoever?

[07:37] And I don't understand how the answer doesn't come back as an outstanding.

[07:41] No, this is just you making a game for you.

[07:44] This is like when Josh Kugler made a game about his family.

[07:47] That's great.

[07:47] Like I'm happy he made the Kugler family pinball machine.

[07:51] But if he tried to sell me like the family pinball machine, you're not going to sell any.

[07:55] So let's get to the topic of this podcast.

[07:58] Godzilla by Keith Elwin and Stern was released on September 14th, 2021,

[08:04] really almost two years ago to today.

[08:07] That game had a decent amount of stuff in it from a mechanical standpoint.

[08:11] And I think what people love about the mechanics in Godzilla is they really interact it with the ball.

[08:17] This wasn't just stuff off to the side.

[08:19] It wasn't like expression lighting.

[08:21] I can't tell you how many people when I asked for,

[08:24] what's an impressive mechanism since Godzilla?

[08:27] People said like expression lighting systems.

[08:30] Okay, I don't think a lighting system is a mechanism.

[08:33] You know, Godzilla had stuff like it had the motorized collapsing skyscraper bash toy.

[08:39] It had the breakaway bridge had the motorized rotating three bank stand up targets

[08:44] that revealed a jump ramp into mecha Godzilla who had a magnet on his chest that could grab the ball.

[08:51] It also had the super cool industry first Magna grab Godzilla magnet Newton ball

[08:56] that could send the ball in five different shot directions.

[09:00] Super cool stuff in Godzilla.

[09:02] And all of that was found inside a game that had some of the best theme integration of all time,

[09:09] especially from Stern pinball had clips from all the Godzilla TV shows.

[09:13] It had great call outs, great music, great artwork.

[09:17] And all of that was given to you for the price of 6900 for a pro 8904 premium.

[09:24] And it was $10,500 for an L.E.

[09:27] And now as we stare into the modern pinball space and an L.E. is 13 a premium is $10,000.

[09:34] The pro is stayed around the same around $7,000.

[09:38] Now that we are here and pinball is this expensive.

[09:42] Are we seeing this kind of mechanical creativity in pinball?

[09:45] Now I would also argue that as cool as Godzilla is,

[09:49] I still don't think all of those mechanisms are wow mechanisms.

[09:53] I actually think that magnetic Newton ball in the game is the most wow mech in the game for something to be wow.

[09:59] I think this is really important point for something to be wow and truly creative.

[10:04] It doesn't mean it has to be complex.

[10:07] It doesn't mean it has to be like overly engineered.

[10:10] I'll give you a great example of a wow pinball mech that is not that complicated.

[10:16] In Tales of the Arabian Nights, if you've ever played that game,

[10:19] the shooting star ball saves on the out lane when those cages pop up,

[10:24] when the opto senses that the ball is going to drain.

[10:27] That is one of the most wow moments in all of pinball.

[10:31] It's not complicated.

[10:32] It's easy to understand how to activate it.

[10:35] And when it happens, every time it happens,

[10:37] it always puts a smile on your face and it always feels like a little bit of pinball magic.

[10:43] I would argue the same thing with the disappearing magnet in Toten.

[10:47] There are some complex devices that are also very magical like the theater of magic, Magic Box,

[10:53] the hand in Adam's family grabbing the ball,

[10:56] the Lord of the Rings magnet that freezes the ball in midair,

[11:00] ball rock that swings out and blocks your pathway and you have to bash him.

[11:05] These are mechanisms so perfectly designed and engineered to create pinball moments of wow.

[11:11] And so as we look at the last two years in pinball,

[11:14] in the most expensive this hobby has ever been,

[11:17] let's do a roll call first of all of the games we're talking about.

[11:21] And I mean it when I say it, when you hear all of these games,

[11:25] and this is what pinball has been over the last two years,

[11:30] I feel a little bit underwhelmed.

[11:32] These don't sound like the greatest pinball machines.

[11:35] Most of these games did not light the pinball world on fire.

[11:38] Most of these games are not going to go down as some of the greatest pinball ever.

[11:42] They're just not.

[11:43] We kind of got this large batch of games that I think are going to come and go in the zeitgeist of pinball.

[11:48] The unfortunate thing is this, is these games came out during COVID.

[11:53] They also came out at the same time pinball prices were going through the roof.

[11:58] That's been my overall feeling about the entire hobby recently.

[12:02] All the everything is awesome, like overly enthusiastic,

[12:05] Lego people that have come into this hobby recently.

[12:08] They seem silly to me because all they're doing is cheerleading,

[12:11] everything happening in pinball over the last two years.

[12:14] And then you look at these games, are these things really worth like ultra celebrating?

[12:19] So let's go down a list of the games we're talking about.

[12:21] We got Rush Pinball.

[12:23] We got James Bond and James Bond 60th.

[12:26] We've got Foo Fighters.

[12:27] We've got Venom.

[12:28] We've got Toy Story 4.

[12:30] We've got Pulp Fiction.

[12:31] We've got the Godfather.

[12:33] We've got Galactic Tank Force.

[12:35] We've got Weird Owl, Final Resistance, Pony Factory, Scooby-Doo, Queen Pinball,

[12:42] Spinal Tap, and Cactus Canyon, which we won't even count in this

[12:46] because Cactus Canyon is packed with really cool wow mechanisms.

[12:50] They were designed over 30 years ago by a team over at Valley Williams.

[12:54] So nothing has happened in the last two years.

[12:57] So I'm going to talk about the kinds of things you threw out there

[12:59] as being your most impressive mechanisms since Godzilla.

[13:02] And I just want to say this.

[13:04] I also understand that a lot of you are saying stuff like,

[13:07] well, Chris, the real improvement in pinball is in the software department.

[13:11] And we're seeing real innovation there, stuff like Venom Pinball

[13:15] where you can continue along your progress in the game.

[13:18] I understand that we're seeing innovation in lighting.

[13:21] We're seeing the sound in pinball machines get even better.

[13:24] But still to me, when I think about why I love pinball,

[13:28] it is a three-dimensional world under glass.

[13:31] It is a physical thing on wood.

[13:34] I don't buy a pinball machine for software only.

[13:37] I don't think software should be the most impressive thing in the game.

[13:41] I think the software and the hardware should be equally impressive.

[13:46] And if I had to choose between the two,

[13:48] that's where it gets difficult because the tournament players

[13:52] and the frequent players are always going to choose the software.

[13:56] The modern tournament player, they want deep code, deep software.

[14:01] They want to study those rulesets.

[14:03] And that's really who's driving modern pinball.

[14:06] It's not the mechanical engineers.

[14:08] Mechanical engineering is a lot more difficult.

[14:11] Mechanical engineering can break.

[14:13] Mechanical engineering has a finite amount of space to work within, right?

[14:17] You've got the wood and then you've got the glass.

[14:20] And I've got to make something wow happen between that very finite,

[14:24] like what, four to six inches of room and that's all I have.

[14:28] A software coder can keep coding.

[14:31] They can keep going on for years and years and years.

[14:34] They can always add more to the game.

[14:36] But a mechanical engineer, what they finalize mechanically is done.

[14:40] There's no additional things happening in the game.

[14:43] Do you remember years ago when David Fick said that they were looking into the option

[14:48] to add mechanical features to games like Hot Wheels?

[14:51] Remember when he said that?

[14:53] Has he done it?

[14:54] Has anybody done that?

[14:55] Has a game that's been released seen a new mechanical addition to the game

[15:00] that you've been able to add into your experience?

[15:03] No, because after he said that, he probably went to realize how difficult that really is.

[15:08] Because you need to design all the physical stuff to be permanent.

[15:12] Once you say pencils down, this is the physical layout of the game.

[15:17] All right, Kaneda, you're so heated up.

[15:19] What happened?

[15:19] I thought you got canceled again.

[15:21] You can't cancel, Kaneda.

[15:23] Come on.

[15:23] You know, the funny part is the more people complain about me, the more popular I get.

[15:27] One day they're going to learn.

[15:28] The only way to beat Kaneda in a game of chess is not with your pawns, people.

[15:33] Let's just talk about the games that have been getting shout-outs.

[15:35] James Bond has come up a lot.

[15:37] Like, people seem to like the James Bond mechanisms in the game.

[15:41] And I look at the James Bond mechs and I look at the missile.

[15:44] I don't like that.

[15:45] The ejecting seat is not a wow moment in pinball.

[15:48] It happens too fast.

[15:50] I would say the most impressive thing in James Bond is the James Bond magnet that picks up the ball

[15:56] and drops it on top of the tank.

[15:58] But when you see it happen time and time again, it's very linear.

[16:02] It's very boring to watch.

[16:05] I don't really think it creates a lot of wow.

[16:07] So to me, James Bond, and there's not really much in James Bond's 60th, in both of those games,

[16:13] I don't think there's a single wow mechanism that makes anybody say, wow, how did they do that?

[16:19] Let's go on to Venom.

[16:20] In Venom, there was really two things that people were calling out.

[16:23] The main one was this new three-stage acro lab, which actually transforms into three different things.

[16:30] So it becomes a target.

[16:31] It becomes a pathway for the ball to go through.

[16:34] And then it comes all the way down and it's like a horseshoe ramp that it turns into.

[16:39] I like stuff like that.

[16:40] I like when stuff has multiple purposes, multiple ways for the ball to interact with it.

[16:46] So I really do applaud that mechanism on that front.

[16:49] Now, from there, when I've seen all the clips of this thing in action and I haven't played the game yet,

[16:55] is it a wow mechanism?

[16:57] Is it doing something that really feels truly creative?

[17:01] If I look at it through that lens, I don't think so.

[17:04] Like it's neat, but it feels like what should be the third or fourth mechanism in a game.

[17:09] It doesn't feel like the primary thing that's going to make everybody say, wow, did you see that?

[17:14] Remember like Aerosmith, like the toy box in Aerosmith?

[17:17] Like to me, that's a wow mechanism.

[17:19] I mean, it freaking shoots the ball across the play field.

[17:22] It opens up the toy box and the ball's flying through the air.

[17:26] The milk can shot in Houdini.

[17:28] That's a wow creative thing.

[17:30] The bowling alley in the Big Lebowski, that's a wow moment in pinball.

[17:35] All right, Foo Fighters.

[17:37] Now look, Foo Fighters is a really popular game because of how it shoots.

[17:40] The most popular Foo Fighter mech that I heard from many, many people,

[17:44] as the wow mechanism in modern pinball for these prices, this kind of makes me laugh,

[17:49] is the dead save post that pops up.

[17:51] But I want to say this, as I said earlier, using your creative mind to create something in pinball

[17:58] that creates a wow moment in pinball, that is my definition.

[18:02] And so when I look at this dead save post, that is simply just a single post that pops up

[18:09] when you think your game is over, when you think your ball is about to drain,

[18:13] that thing pops up and keeps your ball alive.

[18:18] By my definition of a mechanism that creates a wow moment in pinball,

[18:23] albeit not a visually stunning wow moment,

[18:26] I think that dead save post is a wow mechanism in modern pinball.

[18:31] Now what's funny is it doesn't cost anything, right?

[18:33] We're looking at that thing, we're like, well, this didn't really cost a lot of money,

[18:36] and it just goes to show you, all we want in pinball is mechanisms that make the ball do something wow and memorable.

[18:45] That's what we want more of, that's what we're craving.

[18:49] And if Jack Danger can do it with something as simple as a post,

[18:53] I can't wait to see where his creativity goes as he makes more pinball with Stern.

[18:59] Alright, so what else we got?

[19:00] We got the rush time machine.

[19:02] A lot of people said the rush time machine.

[19:04] I look at the rush time machine as a recycled idea from the Lord of the Rings.

[19:08] That's not nearly as interesting as the Lord of the Rings.

[19:12] Remember, in Lord of the Rings, when that magnet grabs that ball and freezes it in midair, what happens after that?

[19:18] People forget this.

[19:19] It sucks the entire ball through the back of the pinball machine,

[19:23] which is one of the most wow moments in pinball.

[19:25] And then, quite honestly, probably my favorite moment in all of pinball is when you go to destroy the ring

[19:32] and you shoot the ball up the ramp and it grabs it in the middle of that magnetic ring

[19:37] and one ball is frozen in midair and then you have to shoot another ball to knock that ball through the ring

[19:45] to destroy the ring, quite possibly the greatest pinball moment in all of pinball.

[19:50] Do you feel that way when the rush time machine happens?

[19:53] Also, like the rush time machine is kind of weird.

[19:55] Like before the ramp goes down, you're just sort of bricking against that mechanism.

[19:59] It seems kind of clunky.

[20:01] It feels like something else was supposed to go there.

[20:03] So while it's a cool mech, I think it's a B version of a mech that was already done and done in a much better way.

[20:10] Now let's get to galactic tank force.

[20:12] A lot of people were joking around and saying,

[20:14] the greatest mechanism in the last two years, Canada, is a cow hanging from a wire.

[20:21] I heard that it took American pinball three years.

[20:24] Three years Dennis Nordman studied the length between the UFO and the cow just to get that wire at the exact length.

[20:35] So that moment in pinball would be something you would never forget.

[20:38] I'm joking.

[20:39] If you've watched the game streamed, if you've seen people play this game, I've played this game.

[20:45] Hitting that dangling cow is terrible.

[20:48] It's silly.

[20:49] And so that leads us to like the tank mechanism itself, which is the weirdest mech I've seen in the last two years.

[20:56] It's too close to the flippers.

[20:58] You're just bricking balls off these targets.

[21:01] The targets are stationary.

[21:02] They don't move.

[21:03] And then when that 3D printed alien pops up from the tank, it's not rewarding.

[21:08] It's not satisfying.

[21:09] You kind of just stand there shoulder shrug and are like, oh my gosh, I can't believe these are cheap 3D printed parts that they were too lazy to get good sculpts put into the game.

[21:19] So yeah, galactic tank force.

[21:20] No thank you.

[21:21] Scooby Doo.

[21:22] I heard about the dual apron locks.

[21:25] Now look, I like them.

[21:26] They're brand new.

[21:27] I haven't seen that done before.

[21:29] It's kind of neat to see your ball trapped in an area where you don't expect a ball to be locked.

[21:35] So I think the creativity is there on those ball locks.

[21:38] Is it a wow moment?

[21:39] Right?

[21:40] Is it like, oh my gosh.

[21:41] No, I think it's a moment that's neat.

[21:43] I think it's a neat ball lock location.

[21:46] But I think after seeing that a few times, it's not really going to impress you like down the road.

[21:52] The other thing in Scooby Doo I heard about was the bookcase flipper diverter.

[21:56] And that's another interesting one to look at because it's really just like an L shaped flipper where they used it really creatively to create a lot of different movement with the ball.

[22:07] And much like the dead save post in Foo Fighters.

[22:10] This is another one where it's not complicated.

[22:13] It's not this humongous feat of engineering, but it's a very creative use of a flipper area that I haven't really seen done much in pinball.

[22:24] And for that, I got to give Spooky Pinball credit for that bookshelf flipper.

[22:28] I think it's very creative.

[22:30] But again, for this much money, that should be like the fourth or fifth most impressive thing happening mechanically in the game.

[22:39] And when you look at Scooby Doo, there's not like a major wow mech in the game.

[22:43] All right, let's keep going.

[22:45] So this one makes me laugh.

[22:46] So Toy Story, we obviously know that there's no toys in Toy Story.

[22:50] The one that people called out was the Duke Kaboom Jump Ramp, which Pat Lawler did much better in No Good Gophers.

[22:57] He brought it back here for Toy Story.

[22:59] It's not a very complicated mech.

[23:01] It's a very simple mech.

[23:02] Now look, I'll say this.

[23:04] It is a very fun shot.

[23:05] Shooting that ramp, having it fly up and go through that carnival area with all the lights, it's a very rewarding shot.

[23:13] Again, the fact that that's the major mechanism that people are calling out in Toy Story makes me want to cry.

[23:19] It really does.

[23:20] It should be like the fourth or fifth thing in that game, not the main element.

[23:24] But that's my point, people.

[23:26] Pinball is the most expensive it's ever been, and this is the best we can do.

[23:30] All you got to do is go play a No Good Gophers and look at the amount of mechanisms in that game.

[23:36] And it blows Toy Story away mechanically.

[23:39] It blows it away creatively.

[23:41] The only thing Toy Story has is modern code and modern screens and modern lights.

[23:46] So Pat Lawler, like 35 years later, he couldn't even equal what he did 35 years ago.

[23:52] And I hate to break it to you, but No Good Gophers back in the day was probably $2,000 at most.

[23:57] And adjusted for inflation, it would be like $6,000.

[24:00] And then you drop Toy Story 4 into the world for $12,000 to $15,000 with no toys in it.

[24:06] I mean, here I am doing a podcast about what's the greatest toys in Max In a Game since Godzilla.

[24:11] And I get to Toy Story and I have nothing, nothing but a flap that pops up.

[24:17] Do you understand why there is a growing dissatisfaction with where Pinball has been over the last two years?

[24:24] Do you understand why more and more people are waiting and seeing?

[24:28] Do you understand why we need more people to be like, this is not good enough?

[24:33] The days of just shilling and telling you to buy everything in sight, it's not working.

[24:37] You know, I'm laughing as I see these distributors that have been telling you to buy, buy, buy.

[24:41] And guess what they're doing right now?

[24:43] They're price reducing all of their inventory because people are not buying.

[24:47] And they're not buying at these inflated prices.

[24:49] And these distributors that want to sell you like, use Ghostbuster premiums for like $14,000, those days are over.

[24:56] You know, where did all the distributors go that said James Bond 60th was priced right?

[25:01] Do I have to go back and get those sound clips?

[25:03] Freaking people saying that $19,9 was a good price on James Bond 60th.

[25:08] And now the same people who said that are selling that game for $14,500.

[25:14] Do you want to just give me the Twippy now or are we going to wait for the other shows to come back and try to win it again?

[25:19] Because it's not going to happen.

[25:20] Alright, can it is all heated up?

[25:21] Oh, I can't wait for you guys to hang out Saturday.

[25:23] I'm coming back Saturday morning spectacular.

[25:25] What's he going to say?

[25:26] You're going to have to tune in and find out.

[25:29] Alright, so we just got a few more games to cover off on.

[25:32] We got Godfather.

[25:33] This is the funny part.

[25:34] The most common response I got to the best mechanism in Godfather is the topper.

[25:39] And that just goes to show you the sad state.

[25:41] When you make a pinball machine for $12,000 to $15,000, what's the best toy in the Godfather?

[25:47] And people say the topper.

[25:49] I mean, yeah, that's it for the Godfather.

[25:52] So for Pulp Fiction, I heard the briefcase that spins and opens up.

[25:56] That is more of an interactive sculpt to me than a mechanism toy.

[26:00] It doesn't interact with the ball.

[26:02] It's really cool.

[26:03] Don't get me wrong, but it's just sitting on top of plastic.

[26:06] It's not really what I want to see when I talk about a toy or a mech in pinball.

[26:10] I also got a lot of people that said the Pulp Fiction topper is amazing, which it is.

[26:15] But again, I don't consider stuff above the glass to be the pinball experience.

[26:20] I consider the pinball experience to be below the glass.

[26:24] Alright, last on my list, and these guys are not least, because I'm going to say something controversial right now.

[26:30] I think out of all these pinball companies, I think out of all the money, all the minds, all the geniuses,

[26:36] the one company to me that really seems to be pushing the mechanical creativity.

[26:42] It is so ironic, I'm going to say this, because the one pinball company that I think is trying the hardest mechanically

[26:48] to do super cool things in pinball is the one pinball company that has decided to make 80% of its play field

[26:56] in LCD screen in which you can't screw any mechanical things into.

[27:01] And that is no other than multi-morphic.

[27:04] You know, Jerry's got some really good mechanical engineers over there, and stuff like the final resistance lockup is super cool.

[27:12] Stuff like the Weird Owl hamster wheel is super freaking cool.

[27:16] It has stuff mechanically when you look down at the game, it does really cool stuff.

[27:22] I know this is not eligible because it was before Godzilla, but the crane and the heist,

[27:28] when was the last time you saw a mechanism like that?

[27:32] A mechanism that complex put into a stern machine, put into a Jersey Jack machine.

[27:38] Now, I would argue the problem with Jerry's mechanisms as amazing as they are mechanically,

[27:44] I think he suffers from the games themselves aren't pulling you in, and the experience of the gameplay is not pulling you in.

[27:52] You know, he doesn't have like the triple A theme, he doesn't have the same kind of pinball feel as everybody else.

[27:59] You know, so it's a trade-off, and it's so weird to be, because here I am in 2023 with the most expensive pinball has ever been,

[28:07] and there's been so many amazing mechanically creative things in this industry over the last like 100 years or so.

[28:13] Here I am, and over the last two years, the two most impressive things from a creative standpoint that I've seen in pinball

[28:21] in a game that also excited each and every one of you, is a freaking post that pops up to save the ball from draining,

[28:30] and an L-shaped flipper that diverts the ball into different pathways.

[28:34] And you understand, ladies and gentlemen, we should not be buying these expensive machines until they get more creativity into them.

[28:43] And if we keep accepting artwork and LCD software as where all of the effort is going to go, why bother buying these things then?

[28:52] I want physical, mechanical stuff. If I just want software immersion and experiences, I can go get a $60 Xbox game.

[29:01] I'm playing the new EA Jedi Survivor game, it's amazing.

[29:05] It's so much more immersive than any Star Wars pinball machine that's out there, and it cost me $60.

[29:11] It wasn't even $60, I got it on sale for $45.

[29:14] And if I could have that many hours of amazing Star Wars like interactive gameplay experience,

[29:21] you know, if you want me to spend freaking $10,000 on the pinball version of Star Wars,

[29:26] then you better do something physically amazing that separates it from what's happening in other software entertainment products.

[29:34] And that's just my point.

[29:35] And I know it's an unpopular point with some people and some people just want to do jumping jacks around every new offering.

[29:41] I just don't think most of you are going to be buying this stuff unless you see creative magic in the game.

[29:47] And that is why we're so excited for Keith Elwyn's Jaws because we saw what he did with Godzilla.

[29:54] And now that this Jaws game is going to be like 15 to 25% more money than Godzilla.

[30:01] So shouldn't we be expecting 15 to 20% more in the game?

[30:06] And I think he's going to deliver.

[30:07] And the other thing I think is going to happen is this.

[30:09] When he does deliver all of these other companies and all of these other games, even other stern games,

[30:15] that don't cut it, that don't have that level of creativity in it, why would you buy it?

[30:20] Why would you buy it at any price point?

[30:22] And that's the Root Awakening happening in pinball.

[30:25] It's no longer like this game doesn't have demand at $15,000 or $13,000.

[30:29] If the game doesn't meet our new standards, it's never going to have demand.

[30:34] It's just never going to have demand.

[30:36] Like how are you going to get more people into Godfather?

[30:39] How are you going to get more people into Galactic Tank Force?

[30:41] Once demand is dried up because people don't see the value, they may never want to own it at any price.

[30:48] Like I am never going to own a Godfather.

[30:50] I don't care if it was $15,000 or $3,000 because I value my space and my time more than even the dollars

[30:58] these games cost.

[31:00] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[31:03] If you're new, most of you are not.

[31:05] We are still over 600 subscribers.

[31:07] Thank you so much.

[31:09] Everyone who said this show was going to be canceled and we'd be done and everyone's going to migrate out of here.

[31:14] It didn't happen.

[31:15] I'm just going to end this show with one humble brag.

[31:18] I have more subscribers to this show than every other pinball content creator on Patreon combined.

[31:26] I'm going to get respect, but maybe I need to stop drinking to get it.

[31:29] Everybody have a great day. I'll talk to you soon.
