[00:00] Ice Cream, You, Screen, We all scream for Ice Cream, Go!

[00:05] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA

[00:09] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:13] I thought I'd be looking at pulp fiction photos by now.

[00:16] Look, it is almost three o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

[00:21] We were told it was going to be revealed on Monday.

[00:24] Now look, we're looking at the cabinet.

[00:26] We're looking at like fuzzy pictures of the play field.

[00:29] It has been a weekend in which two major game launches were both spoiled by photos leaking out into the world.

[00:39] And pinball marketing, which is atrocious, continues to remain atrocious.

[00:44] I don't understand it.

[00:45] You spent years working on a game.

[00:47] You've spent so much time and energy, and you get one chance to make a first impression.

[00:53] And what do you do?

[00:54] You wait too long.

[00:56] And look, it is not impossible to keep a new game a secret.

[01:01] Nobody saw Godfather.

[01:03] Jersey Jack did a good job keeping that game under wraps.

[01:06] Nobody saw freaking Foo Fighters.

[01:09] They did a great job keeping that game under wraps.

[01:11] And it's quite clear what's happened now.

[01:14] It's like American Pinball let people inside to American Pinball to film the game.

[01:19] And now we have like what are beautiful crystal clear shots of this game.

[01:23] We're going to talk about Galactic Chang Force.

[01:26] They freaking did it.

[01:27] They turned a cabinet into a tank.

[01:30] We're going to talk about my thoughts on the zaniest pinball cabinet I've ever seen since I've been a part of this hobby.

[01:37] We're going to talk about Pulp Fiction.

[01:39] Now we know there's no display.

[01:41] Now we know it looks like a game from like the mid 80s.

[01:44] It's going to have more of this like retro solid state feel to it.

[01:48] And we also know that DeepRoot who we thought was dead is back again with Mr. Turner Lodge at Chris Turner.

[01:55] I believe his name is and he's going to resurrect something and show us something he's been working on at Texas Pinball Festival.

[02:03] And you got to have some guts ladies and gentlemen to make a video in which you're standing in front of the three Raza machines that DeepRoot Pinball was working on.

[02:12] I have no idea what's coming from Turner Pinball, but my money is it's not going to work out.

[02:17] Karma people karma is a real thing in this world.

[02:20] Alright, so first let's start with Galactic Tank Force.

[02:23] And I think this title has a lot of people curious.

[02:27] It has a lot of people excited.

[02:29] And here's my take on this whole thing.

[02:31] I just like the fact that this game is coming out.

[02:34] It's a Dennis Norderman game.

[02:35] And man, they went all in like they leaned into this 1950s like sci-fi campy like ice cream adventure with tanks in space.

[02:44] And it definitely just feels so different than everything else in the market.

[02:50] And as a marketer, you know, if you want to stand out in a crowded marketplace, this is definitely how you do it.

[02:57] And I know there's mixed reactions to American Pinball's teasers around this game.

[03:02] I want to say this right now.

[03:03] I think a lot of us need to just lighten up.

[03:06] I actually liked the teasers that they've been putting out there.

[03:09] It stays true to the campiness of the theme.

[03:12] And I just liked seeing Dennis Norderman having fun, being playful with something that is a toy.

[03:20] I think a lot of us are taking this hobby way too freaking serious lately.

[03:25] And if you can't enjoy Dennis Norderman playing around with like an ice cream cone and a child's tank

[03:31] and putting the two things together to make this crazy concoction that is Galactic Tank Force.

[03:37] The freaking head folds down and it's got the tank treads.

[03:41] It's got everything.

[03:42] And now the big question becomes is this how much will this thing cost?

[03:47] We're going to talk about that.

[03:48] And then we've seen the play field.

[03:50] And if you look at the play field right now, it is a two flipper game.

[03:54] It looks freaking colorful.

[03:56] It looks fun.

[03:57] I'm not going to go over all the shots in the game.

[03:59] It definitely doesn't look like the most unique layout, but there's definitely some very unique things going on in this game.

[04:06] If you look down by the flippers, it looks like if you hold the flippers up, the ball can go over a switch.

[04:13] I haven't seen this in any pinball machine since I've been covering pinball.

[04:17] And it says like lucky break.

[04:19] So maybe you can let the ball drain underneath each flipper and it rolls over a switch.

[04:24] And I'm not sure if there's a magnet there that's going to pull the ball back up and have some sort of cool effect.

[04:30] It says atomic shield and defense right there and shoot again.

[04:34] But what's interesting, if you look at the photo, there's a post that's right below each flipper.

[04:40] It almost looks like the center drain area is very narrow.

[04:44] Like it's going to be really hard to drain on this game.

[04:47] And I'm wondering if this game is going to be really easy or if you're supposed to somehow strategically lift those flippers more often than not and allow the ball to roll over those switches.

[04:57] But I don't even know how to really like deconstruct this game.

[05:00] It looks like there's a lot going on.

[05:03] There's like this big massive red spaceship tank looking thing all the way up the middle.

[05:08] I think it's a spaceship.

[05:09] There's like five targets in front of it.

[05:12] There's this ramp on the left side.

[05:14] It looks like there's a buck on the right side and there's a lot going on sort of behind that like red spaceship.

[05:20] To the right, it looks like there's a moving target that's going to go back and forth.

[05:24] There's a freaking cow.

[05:26] There's UFOs.

[05:27] There's astronauts.

[05:28] There's ice cream.

[05:29] There's Sundays.

[05:30] There's women yelling at each other by the slingshots.

[05:33] I mean, there's a lot going on in this game.

[05:36] And I just want to say this.

[05:37] I like what I see.

[05:39] I like this freaking tank offering and this out of all the games that have come out.

[05:44] This one has made me smile the most, you know, because I'm not disappointed that they didn't get the theme integration, right?

[05:50] Because this theme is original.

[05:52] I think people forget dialed in one game of the year in 2017.

[05:58] It also won for best theme integration.

[06:01] And so if we're looking at these games this year and we're saying, hey, how well did they integrate Galactic Tank Force into Galactic Tank Force?

[06:09] I think they knocked it out of the park.

[06:11] I don't like the way they integrated Godfather into Godfather.

[06:15] I love the way they integrated the Foo Fighters into the Foo Fighter machine.

[06:19] This thing is just over the top ridiculous.

[06:21] And so there's a lot of questions about the practicality of this one that's got all the tank trimmings going on.

[06:28] Like what happens when you fold the back box up?

[06:31] Like is this game going to be sticking out from the wall in a normal lineup of games?

[06:36] I would have to assume that American Pinball knows that this thing is going to go into a lineup of pinball machines.

[06:42] And I think they probably engineered it so it's not going to stick out awkwardly.

[06:47] But let me tell you right now, who cares?

[06:49] Sell your entire collection people.

[06:51] Get the freaking tank.

[06:53] This thing looks like nothing else out there.

[06:56] And I just felt like a little kid looking at it.

[06:58] Like I'm all in on Galactic Tank Force.

[07:00] I'm 100% in on this game.

[07:02] Now that doesn't mean I'm buying one.

[07:04] I want to wait to see a few things on this game.

[07:07] I want to wait to see how fun the game is to shoot.

[07:09] I want to wait to see like how everything comes together in this game.

[07:13] But I'm super excited for this machine.

[07:15] I'm super happy for American Pinball.

[07:17] It definitely looks like they uncuffed Mr. Dennis Nordman.

[07:21] I mean they let him do whatever he wanted in this game.

[07:24] And I'm loving it. I'm loving it.

[07:26] Now look, the major question is this.

[07:28] And this is the major question on every single pinball machine, on Pulp Fiction, on this game as well.

[07:33] How much is this game going to cost?

[07:36] There is no way to separate the price of machines now with what we're getting.

[07:40] And here's what I'm hearing.

[07:41] I'm hearing the full tank version is going to be $13,000.

[07:46] And then the game in a standard cabinet will be like $9,000.

[07:50] So look, look, I don't know how you get Galactic Tank Force.

[07:54] And don't get the full tank version.

[07:56] I also hear that American Pinball is somewhat still trying to figure out how much they're going to charge for this game.

[08:04] Because it is gimmicky.

[08:05] I mean, let's not fool ourselves people.

[08:07] It is a gimmick.

[08:08] Like, I don't know how you're going to nudge that game around with the tank treads on them.

[08:12] I mean, how practical is it going to be?

[08:14] Are you going to be lowering the back box in the game when you're not using it?

[08:17] Because it looks really interesting like that.

[08:20] It is a gimmick, right?

[08:21] And you're not going to want to spend a $4,000 premium on a gimmick that you're not going to use very often.

[08:28] And then the question becomes if they're going to charge $13,000, how many of these tank, full deluxe LE tank versions,

[08:36] does American Pinball make?

[08:39] Are they going to make $500?

[08:41] The LEs for Legends of Vahala were first $300, then they bumped it to $500 or $600.

[08:46] But obviously there's a lot more excitement and attention around this game than Legends of Vahala.

[08:53] There's like twice as much inside this game.

[08:55] And I'm 10 times more excited about this freaking tank.

[08:59] So we'll see.

[09:00] The other thing is this.

[09:01] Everything is leaked.

[09:02] We now know everything about this game other than the code, other than the animations.

[09:07] What you're going to see in this game is live action video on the screen and the sort of campy way in which these like military people are going to be telling you what to do.

[09:16] We haven't seen much of that yet, right?

[09:18] We haven't seen what's on the screen.

[09:19] We haven't seen the animations.

[09:21] But I also want to say, and maybe I'm making this up, I think David Thiel is doing the music on this game.

[09:27] And if there's one complaint everybody has about Godfather, it's like the music over at Jersey Jack Pinball has been somewhat atrocious since David Thiel went over to Deeproot.

[09:38] And if David Thiel is working on this space themed game with American Pinball and Dennis Nordman, I think the sound package could be kind of incredible.

[09:47] I might be wrong on that.

[09:48] Someone needs to fact check if David Thiel is working on Galactic Tank Force.

[09:51] But the other part is this.

[09:53] It's all spoiled now.

[09:54] And no, it was not Canada that leaked these images.

[09:57] And now that these images have leaked and we've seen the cabinet, what are you waiting for American Pinball?

[10:04] The Pinball marketing world is so weird.

[10:06] It's like they're asleep at the wheel.

[10:08] Now that everything has leaked, just drop everything you've got.

[10:12] Drop the high res imagery.

[10:14] Drop the videos you have.

[10:16] We know I think straight down the middle has been over there to film a video.

[10:19] Just get it all out now.

[10:21] Like you might as well get it all out now before more people start throwing money at other stuff like Pulp Fiction and Godfather's.

[10:29] So we'll see what they do this week.

[10:31] But as of right now at three o'clock Eastern Standard Time, American Pinball still will not fully reveal the game, even though the game has been fully revealed.

[10:41] And this is all on them.

[10:43] David Fix trusted people to come over there and people took cell phone photos and they need to get better at this.

[10:50] If you're going to have people visit American Pinball, you got to take away their cameras.

[10:56] You got to tell people, no, you can't take shots of the game.

[11:00] And these are good shots.

[11:01] Like everything's been revealed and it's like someone clearly was standing over this game and took a high res image of the game itself.

[11:09] Where were you, American Pinball staff?

[11:11] How did you let this get out?

[11:13] Very unprofessional.

[11:15] Okay, so speaking of unprofessional, same thing happened with Pulp Fiction.

[11:18] We've had this blurry image for like the entire weekend.

[11:22] We've all been staring at it.

[11:24] Everyone's been wondering if it's real or not.

[11:26] And Canada had it up on his Facebook page.

[11:28] I did not leak this.

[11:30] I saw this on Pinside.

[11:32] I knew it was real because Pinside kept forcing the photo to be taken down.

[11:36] Now, guess what photo wasn't taken down?

[11:39] Canada's Pinball podcast kept it up and now people realize it's true.

[11:43] Like there's a Royale with cheese there.

[11:45] You've got the characters from Pulp Fiction and this like cheesy 80s cartoon sort of vibe going on.

[11:50] Now we see it's a game with no display.

[11:53] It looks like a solid state back box with four players scoring.

[11:57] Was it alpha numerical scoring?

[11:59] Did I get that right?

[12:00] You know me.

[12:01] I don't know my pinball history when it comes to this old stuff.

[12:03] And so it looks like a game that came out in like the 80s.

[12:07] And now the big question is this.

[12:09] How much is this going to cost?

[12:11] Right?

[12:12] Because this feels more like a James Bond 60th kind of vibe.

[12:15] Why did they go in this direction?

[12:17] We know the story why.

[12:18] This is what Tarantino wanted.

[12:20] He wanted a throwback game and here's what's a little bit weird about it.

[12:23] Right?

[12:24] Is Pulp Fiction is a movie from 1994.

[12:26] It is set in 1994.

[12:29] And in 1994, this isn't what pinball looked like.

[12:32] We have the DMD.

[12:34] So this is a big risk to kind of remove the DMD, remove the screen.

[12:39] And we weren't looking for like movie footage,

[12:41] but you can do a lot more with the DMD than you can without a display at all.

[12:46] And so how are people going to respond to this game?

[12:49] And we were expecting to see the full reveal today.

[12:52] I just want to say this right now.

[12:53] I think if people think this game, this Raw Thrill's game that CGC is making,

[12:57] if you think this game is going to be like $6,000 to $8,000,

[13:01] I think you might be disappointed.

[13:03] I think this game is going to be closer to $10,000 or more for this machine.

[13:08] You know, we don't know how many they're going to make.

[13:11] We don't know how CGC is going to get this onto the line

[13:14] as they owe people all these cactus canyon games.

[13:17] So there's still a lot of question marks around this game,

[13:20] but I definitely think for people out there that just bought maybe a Godfather

[13:25] or bought a Foo Fighters, seeing this Pulp Fiction game go this more retro route,

[13:30] which Kaneda told you it would.

[13:32] I've been telling you it's going to be a single level retro game forever.

[13:35] And now we have it, right?

[13:37] How many times do I have to be right with my rumors and nobody ever gives me credit?

[13:41] But you heard it here first.

[13:43] I mean, nobody was saying this stuff.

[13:44] I told you Raw Thrill's single level Pulp Fiction with throwback retro design.

[13:50] And here we have it.

[13:51] I don't know how this thing is going to land in the pinball world.

[13:54] I know everybody loves the theme, but if you had your way,

[13:58] you would not have wanted the game to be delivered to us like this.

[14:02] And pinball has come a really long way that I'm not sure a throwback game like this

[14:08] is really going to work out.

[14:10] You know, we've been spoiled with such good artwork.

[14:13] And now we're going back to this kind of art style that looks kind of crappy from the 80s and 90s.

[14:18] Like we've moved pinball forward in so many ways.

[14:21] I'm not sure how the market is going to respond to this,

[14:24] but this game has one thing going in its favor.

[14:27] It actually has two things going in its favor.

[14:29] And the two things are pulp and fiction.

[14:32] I mean, my gosh, this is one of the biggest themes ever to become a pinball machine.

[14:37] It is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece.

[14:40] He worked with them on this pinball machine.

[14:42] And if this game, this is going to be the saving thing.

[14:45] If this game has the music from the movies,

[14:48] if it has like a jukebox where you can play through all the songs you love,

[14:52] I think that could save this game.

[14:54] I think people won't laugh at it if it really transports you into the vibe of pulp fiction.

[15:00] Because remember, ladies and gentlemen,

[15:03] the game of pinball is below the glass.

[15:07] And if the soundtrack is great and you feel like you're in that pulp fiction world

[15:11] and the shots are fun and rewarding,

[15:14] then it might be a lot of fun.

[15:16] It might be freaking a lot of fun.

[15:18] Like I'm hearing from people that James Bond 60th is an amazing game.

[15:22] Absolutely.

[15:23] We never thought it wouldn't be a fun game to shoot.

[15:26] It's just not worth anywhere near $20,000.

[15:30] That's it.

[15:31] I thought I would know everything by now,

[15:32] but I don't.

[15:33] There's still so much we don't know about the game.

[15:35] And unfortunately, that means that I'm going to have to do another podcast

[15:38] when they reveal all of the details of pulp fiction.

[15:42] But this game is also going to be at Texas Pinball Festival,

[15:46] alongside Galactic Tank Force, alongside Scooby-Doo,

[15:50] and Foo Fighters, and Godfather, and all these games,

[15:54] and Queen, I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

[15:57] Scott Denisi's new multi-morphic game,

[15:59] which everyone's already forgotten about.

[16:01] Final Resistance.

[16:02] Jerry, what were you thinking?

[16:04] They just dropped this game out in the middle of all of these crowded reveals,

[16:08] and all of a sudden nobody cares about Scott Denisi's new game.

[16:11] And they're going to have to do something to get people back interested in this game.

[16:15] It's $11,700.

[16:17] And I think everyone's sort of waking up from this pinball coma.

[16:21] Everything is so expensive.

[16:23] As much as I love Galactic Tank Force in tank form,

[16:27] I don't want to write a check to American Pinball with tax and shipping

[16:31] for like $14,500 for a single pinball machine.

[16:37] It's gotten crazy, everybody.

[16:39] Like, we used to be able to get these machines for like $6,000 to $7,000

[16:43] for the top of the line pinball machine,

[16:46] and now we're getting this.

[16:48] It's just making everybody a lot more hesitant to jump in and buy.

[16:52] And speaking of hesitant to jump in and buy,

[16:55] I spoke to a few distributors, and they're telling me, Chris,

[16:58] Godfather, Ellie, it's just not selling anywhere near as good

[17:03] as Guns N' Roses, Ellie.

[17:05] Now, look, Guns N' Roses, Ellie, was probably the fastest selling Jersey Jack pinball machine ever.

[17:10] It was the greatest launch ever.

[17:12] It's one of the greatest theme-integrated pinball machines ever.

[17:15] So I'm not surprised that GNR sales absolutely would kill Godfather sales,

[17:20] even if Godfather shoots better.

[17:22] I think, and this is just my supposition, people,

[17:25] I think that Godfather flame is going to go out pretty quickly.

[17:29] And the reason why I think it's going to go out quickly

[17:32] is the theme integration is just not there.

[17:35] You can't take an iconic movie and then not integrate it the right way.

[17:40] I'm sorry, I think people are going to get tired of this mobster game

[17:43] that doesn't really bring to life the movie we love.

[17:46] Alright, speaking about things we love,

[17:48] we're not going to beat up Godfather too much.

[17:50] You guys get it, pass.

[17:52] I'm going to give you a bit of exclusive news right now.

[17:55] An old game that many of you love,

[17:57] many of you might have this in your collection,

[18:00] is I'm hearing coming back,

[18:02] like a brand new version of this game will be made.

[18:05] And I'm going to start off by saying who's making it.

[18:08] Alright, so you know how there is like a pinball company out there

[18:12] that is expanding its manufacturing.

[18:14] That is PadreD gaming.

[18:16] And PadreD gaming, I believe they're in Italy.

[18:19] Now we know that pinball brothers are working with them

[18:21] and they're expanding their manufacturing capabilities.

[18:24] And now you see also that they're making like a funhouse kit.

[18:28] So clearly PadreD gaming and pinball brothers,

[18:32] it looks like might be having a partnership with Planetary Pinball.

[18:36] And I'm just going to rip the bandaid off right now.

[18:38] I am hearing that it will be PadreD gaming

[18:41] that will be doing the remake of Twilight Zone Pinball.

[18:46] Right, Twilight Zone Pinball being made by PadreD

[18:51] and now it makes sense why they're expanding their manufacturing.

[18:54] There's no way they're going to get a lot of orders for Queen Pinball.

[18:57] But I think Queen is just a stopgap game.

[19:00] I think Queen was a game that Andrew Highway was developing.

[19:03] But I think the big juggernaut that they know they have in their bag

[19:07] is Twilight Zone.

[19:09] And then it begs the crazy question.

[19:11] If you remake the Twilight Zone in this current marketplace

[19:15] in which a godfather CE is freaking $15,000,

[19:20] how much would you charge for a game like Twilight Zone

[19:24] with that much in it?

[19:26] I mean, you could probably, with a straight face,

[19:29] make a thousand of them at $20,000 a pop.

[19:34] You would actually have a good argument

[19:36] why it would need to be that much money.

[19:38] You know, it's crazy when that game first came out.

[19:41] It was like $2,500 for an operator to buy the game back in the mid-90s.

[19:45] And even if you adjust that for inflation,

[19:48] it's more like $6,000 to $7,000 today.

[19:51] Look, everyone knows we're kind of getting ripped off.

[19:53] I feel like everyone can feel it.

[19:55] If you just put your inches on and just be cautious, everybody,

[19:58] I mean it when I say it.

[20:00] I see more and more people running at stuff and the FOMO.

[20:03] If you can just get past like that 48 hours of FOMO,

[20:07] you're going to be able to get a game for a lot less money than MSRP.

[20:11] That's why people are not buying Godfather LE for $12,000

[20:15] because they know they're going to be able to get it for like 10 in just a couple months.

[20:19] We saw the same thing happen with Toy Story.

[20:22] If you're going to make $5,000 of them, there's absolutely no reason to even get one.

[20:27] They're going to be everywhere.

[20:29] Stern announced that they sold out of all of their Foo Fighter LEs.

[20:33] Congratulations to Jack Danger.

[20:35] I still think the theme integration on Foo Fighters has been the best theme integration of the year.

[20:40] The fact that they made like a Foo Fighter Saturday morning cartoon adventure was absolute genius.

[20:47] And the art package by Freakin' Zambietti is insane.

[20:51] You don't need to sit down and take notes to figure out like who did the art on the game like you do with Godfather.

[20:56] Like there's like three different artists on Godfather trying to figure out who is responsible for what.

[21:01] And now we end this podcast with the most ridiculous item of the day, Chris Turner over at Turner Pinball.

[21:08] What are you doing, buddy? What are you doing? Why did you buy the Deeproot assets?

[21:13] Now look, he said he's working on a game off-camera that he is going to bring to Texas Pinball Festival.

[21:19] He's going to have a booth there to show us what he's been working on.

[21:23] And that's Turner Pinball. This is how he's coming into the pinball world.

[21:27] I have no idea what he's working on, what his plans are, why those rosas are sitting there.

[21:33] But I'll tell you this. I will go up to him at Texas Pinball Festival and get some answers for each and every one of you.

[21:40] Everybody, if you're going to Texas Pinball Festival, please mark down this time.

[21:45] It's 2 o'clock on Friday the 24th from 2 to 4.30.

[21:49] Yours truly, Canada will be having a happy hour at Perry's Steakhouse right across the street from Texas Pinball Festival.

[21:56] I would love to hang out with you guys if you're coming. Just go to Perry's. Don't worry about RSVPing.

[22:02] It's right in the bar area. I've got a huge area reserved for Canada fans.

[22:06] We did it last time. It was a lot of fun. We're going to have a lot of fun again.

[22:10] The cargo shorts that won the cargo short vote will be the classic cargo shorts.

[22:15] I was kind of hoping the Brazilians would win it out, but it was voted by people on my Saturday morning spectacular.

[22:21] And they voted for O'Natural cargo shorts.

[22:25] And the last thing I'll say, if you ordered a Canada mug, if you ordered a Canada t-shirt or a sweatshirt, congratulations.

[22:33] You now have a rare collector item. Somebody in this community tipped off the Acura license holder,

[22:39] and they sent a notice that they were yanking everything down.

[22:43] It had all been up for sale for months and nothing was wrong with it.

[22:47] Just my Canada logo. And all of a sudden they said someone reached out and said there is IP infringement,

[22:53] which there is. There is. I'm not trying to lie here. It is. It is the Canada character from the movie poster.

[22:59] I'm sorry about that. Even though Blake altered it a little bit for my podcast,

[23:03] I can no longer sell you that original logo that everybody loves.

[23:08] And it was on the mug. It was on the t-shirts. It was on the sweatshirts.

[23:12] And look, there's no money to be made in merchandise. I really don't care anymore about the merch.

[23:17] Thank you everybody for the support. We hit a new milestone. 575 club members.

[23:23] This is the most we've ever had. I love it.

[23:26] People in this space are starting to remove how many Patreon subscribers they have because they don't have many.

[23:31] This is it. You're hanging out with the best pinball podcast on the planet.

[23:35] And it's because of you guys. And thank you so much for all the support.

[23:38] And I can't wait to hang out with a lot of you guys down in Texas.

[23:41] We're gonna have a blast. It's just in two weeks. It's coming up fast.

[23:44] Get ready. Canadian out.

[23:45] Ice cream, noose cream. We all scream for ice cream.

[23:49] Rock! Rock!
