[00:00] Today I went online, apparently a lot of people don't like me.

[00:04] There's no cell phones in rehab and that's where I'm going so come find me.

[00:09] I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit up.

[00:30] I'm going to sit up for a long time.

[00:31] The topic of this show, I'm not going to mince words anymore.

[00:36] I am going to say something on this show that is my belief, my opinion from what I've gathered

[00:43] from people I've spoken to over the last few months.

[00:49] It's also, I'm coming to this conclusion by things that have happened to me by said personnel

[00:56] over at said organization.

[00:59] I'm also gathering the reality of end of the year pinball award show and the world's

[01:08] biggest pinball company with the most people got zero awards.

[01:14] And I had someone on Facebook being like, Kaneda now hates Stern.

[01:19] And I was like, I don't hate Stern, but tell me which award you would have given to Stern.

[01:26] And there was no reply.

[01:28] And I just want to say.

[01:29] 

[01:29] This makes me sad because what is happened to Stern pinball isn't an isolated thing at

[01:38] Stern.

[01:39] It is what is happening all over the world.

[01:44] Companies are losing their identity.

[01:47] They are losing their culture and they are losing their creativity in the name of one

[01:56] thing.

[01:58] In the name of growth.

[01:59] Growth.

[01:59] Growth.

[02:00] Growth.

[02:01] Growth.

[02:02] Growth.

[02:03] Growth.

[02:04] Growth.

[02:05] Growth.

[02:06] Growth.

[02:07] Growth.

[02:08] Growth.

[02:09] Growth.

[02:10] Growth.

[02:11] Growth.

[02:12] Growth.

[02:13] Growth.

[02:14] Growth.

[02:15] Growth.

[02:16] Growth.

[02:17] Growth.

[02:18] Growth.

[02:19] Growth.

[02:20] Growth.

[02:21] Growth.

[02:22] Growth.

[02:23] Growth.

[02:24] Growth.

[02:25] Growth.

[02:26] Growth.

[02:27] Growth.

[02:28] Growth.

[02:29] is because it's from Ireland and it represents the people of the Irish Republic that people

[02:38] relate to. They export joy to the world. They export music, singing, dancing, the crack as

[02:47] they would say. Not crack like drugs, okay? It's spelled differently. And so you have this brand

[02:53] that got really big and there's a reason why because the world loved it for what it was

[02:59] and it grew organically without any sort of like ad campaign that was trying to create sizzle and

[03:07] sex. And in the end, by the time I had been done working on them, every time I would bring an idea

[03:14] that was rooted in Irish culture, they wanted nothing to do with it. They thought to grow,

[03:22] we have to make the world's number one Irish whiskey more appealing to other cultures that

[03:29] might not even like whiskey. And what that does is it destroys who you are. It destroys the very

[03:37] fiber of your culture. And I'm saying what's happened at Stern Pinball, and it's so obvious,

[03:44] they have brought in outside people. And did those outside people, did they become a member

[03:52] of the community? Did they listen and hear from us? Did they listen for the first,

[03:59] few years to operators and collectors and this? No. And now what we're seeing now in 2026

[04:08] is the impact of bringing in outside individuals who don't really know pinball.

[04:16] And they didn't have a vision for pinball when they went and got their MBAs,

[04:21] when they went and worked over here. Maybe it was Disney. Maybe it was the WWE. This is a really,

[04:28] really unique and special industry. It's a really, really unique and special product.

[04:37] And in my entire journey through pinball, I have realized watching all of these companies,

[04:43] some have succeeded, some have failed, but it all comes down to one thing. The companies with

[04:49] the greatest culture will be the companies that people are excited to wake up every day,

[04:55] go through the door, and create a world of pinball. And that's what we're seeing. And that's what we're

[04:58] seeing. And that's what we're seeing. And that's what we're seeing. And that's what we're seeing.

[04:58] If the company is obsessed with growth and finding new customers, despite their existing customers

[05:08] or making marketing moves that absolutely cannibalize their own market, not only that,

[05:16] but also crap on the very people that got your company to where it's at. You know,

[05:22] when you keep remaking things, you said you'd never remake. When you raise the prices and you

[05:27] strip out the features, you're not going to make it. You're not going to make it. You're not going to make it.

[05:28] You're not going to make it. You're not going to make it. You're not going to make it. You're not going to make it.

[05:28] When you start making your cabinets look like Ikea pieces of furniture, it gets to a point where

[05:34] there's only so many times you can tell your buyers, your significant volume of owners,

[05:43] there's only so many times they're going to forgive you. And there's only so many times

[05:47] you're going to test their patience. And so here we are, it is the beginning of a new year.

[05:53] And I look at so many of these pinball companies with optimism,

[05:57] with energy, and they have momentum. And then I'm hearing from people that I know are intimately,

[06:05] intimately connected at Stern Pinball. And it makes me sad because I've been through this in

[06:12] my own career. And I know what happens when this happens, when you get the executives

[06:18] barking at everybody, how come sales aren't where they're at? Do you think Seth and George are

[06:24] seeing eye to eye on the vision of the future? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

[06:27] know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

[06:27] 

[06:27] 

[06:27] 

[06:27] 

[06:27] of this company? Have you even seen in almost a year the chief marketing officer over at Stern?

[06:38] Have you heard from him once? To me, that says everything. The CMO should be out there.

[06:44] He should be out there, out and about. No, you haven't. What we've witnessed is people who love

[06:51] this hobby so much getting burnt out by the culture over there. You know, it's a point now,

[06:59] it's kind of like, you know, it's their house, right? They work in Chicago. They've got that

[07:03] big building. And it's like, think about your own family. Sometimes it's easy to keep the turmoil

[07:10] hidden from everybody else. Because in your family, you're not like making a product.

[07:15] But look, if your family dynamic and your family culture is negative and toxic, you know who's

[07:20] going to notice it?

[07:21] The teachers when your kids go to school or your coworkers when you go into work.

[07:27] Like we're going to notice the change in the individual. Have you seen a change in George

[07:33] Gomez doing all these damage control tours? Does he look like he's having a good time

[07:39] answering silly questions all the time because he's got to like defend the poor sales of these

[07:45] games and then hide behind licensor issues? Wow. None of those issues at JJP. None of those

[07:51] issues at JJP. None of those issues at JJP. None of those issues at JJP. None of those issues at JJP.

[07:51] None of those issues at JJP. None of those issues at JJP. None of those issues at JJP. None of those

[07:52] issues at JJP. None of those issues at JJP. None of those issues at JJP. None of those issues at

[07:52] Spooky Pinball. But all of a sudden, oh, licensor approval. Okay, sure. But where's the great game?

[07:58] Where's the magic? Where's the mechs? Where's all the stuff? Where's the stuff that's worth $13,000?

[08:04] Where's the topper? How come the topper looks like that? Nobody had any common sense. You put C3PO

[08:09] decapitated in front of who knows what is happening behind him. And you're supposed to say that you're

[08:15] creative and everyone's inspired. And that looks like an inspiring creative item.

[08:21] No, we're at this point now where we've taken people that have absolutely loved this hobby,

[08:28] like Zombie Eddie. We've taken people like Jack Danger. We've seen people leaving Stern Pinball,

[08:35] going other places, like Tom Capera goes over to JJP. These are huge losses. And these were the

[08:42] people that built Stern and made Stern great and made us love Stern Pinball. It's like,

[08:47] how many times can we now ignore the fact?

[08:51] That they're not able to keep this turmoil inside their own house. That people inside that house

[08:59] are now dying for a little help because they're not going to get it unless people know. And you

[09:05] could sense it and you could feel it. And I'm here to tell you right now that I've heard now

[09:13] from a variety of people that Pokemon Pinball will be the ultimate, and I mean this,

[09:21] the ultimate disappointment in what Stern Pinball has become. Star Wars was a humongous

[09:29] disappointment. One of the biggest, greatest IPs of all time, and they butchered it. And now what

[09:37] you're going to get in Pokemon, which is the biggest IP in the entire world by a lot. And so

[09:46] you have Stern Pinball with the biggest IP in the history of Pinball.

[09:51] And did they design this game as an organization and collaborate as an organization? You would

[09:59] think it would be all hands on deck to make this game, but no. What this company has turned into

[10:05] is the toxic culture that was Bally Williams back in the day, where teams were isolated from each

[10:13] other, where internal politics is what drove the sort of development of each title.

[10:21] Where it wasn't about as a company coming together to make the best possible game we can make.

[10:27] How do we make the best possible Pokemon game ever? Keith, Elwin, you love Pokemon,

[10:33] you're in it. Jack, you got some great ideas. Jack Danger, awesome. Let's get everybody in a room

[10:39] and make this the greatest game ever and put all of our resources into it. Nope. It's like

[10:45] your homework assignment is this Jack Danger. Your homework assignment is this Keith,

[10:51] Elwin. Your homework assignment is this John Borg. We need you to do three games in one year.

[10:56] They're all going to be half-baked and they're all going to fail. And then everyone's going to

[10:59] blame you. And this is the other part that sucks for all of these people over there that are

[11:05] creatives. Because in the end, in the end, it's like you're not blaming Seth Davis.

[11:11] You're not blaming the CMO. You're blaming John Borg. You're going to blame Jack Danger. You're

[11:16] going to blame George Gomez. You're going to blame Keith, Elwin if the games aren't where you want

[11:20] them.

[11:21] You're going to blame Zombie Yeti because it's such a very personal product. That's what's so

[11:27] unique about it, right? When you buy a car, do you know who designed the car? Do you know who

[11:32] designed the look of it? No. Do you know who designed the engine? No. Do you know who designed

[11:37] anything about it? No. All you know is I bought a Porsche. I bought a BMW, but this is very personal.

[11:44] You didn't buy Foo Fighters. You bought Jack Danger's Foo Fighters. You didn't buy Godzilla.

[11:49] You bought Keith,

[11:50] Elwin's Godzilla. They are more like movie directors than they are a whole team of people

[11:56] is known and only the brand is what you associate with the game. And because of that, because it's

[12:04] very hyper-personal, that is the problem Stern is facing today is they have lost, and I mean,

[12:11] I hear this from so many people, they have lost the personal enthusiasm to go through the door

[12:20] every day. And I'm hearing it from people that are there. No one's going to go on the record.

[12:25] Nobody, but you can witness this. I've heard it from other pinball companies in the area who tell

[12:31] me, hey, Kaneda, you know how many Stern resumes are landing on my desk right now? Oh, so they're

[12:38] making that up? No, I don't think they are. I always said Stern to me had it all. They had it

[12:46] all. It was the place to be. If you were a creative, you want to go somewhere,

[12:50] where you can execute consistently and your creation comes out every year. If you work for

[12:57] the other companies, you got to get to the end of the line after your game comes out. And it might

[13:02] be two to three years before your next game gets executed. But here's what's happening in pinball,

[13:07] that these designers and these creators and these mechanical engineers and these electrical

[13:12] engineers and these line workers, they would rather work in a culture that was slower to get

[13:19] to their items.

[13:20] That's not toxic. Then work in a toxic culture that is always rushing, that is always putting

[13:28] pressure on everybody that is trying to grow to a level that pinball will never grow to.

[13:34] And you're not going to grow it this way with subpar products. How do you release Star Wars,

[13:41] The Walking Dead and expect to grow? What was the strategy there? And you got to now

[13:47] start to point fingers and,

[13:50] make people accountable. Like Seth, you were the CEO that green lit the remastering of The Walking

[13:57] Dead. You know what that shows me? You never surveyed the community. I think you probably

[14:03] just spoke to a few of your big dealers who were like, yeah, we'll sell more. Of course,

[14:08] those dealers are going to tell you that because they don't care, bro. You're giving them a margin

[14:12] and profit. Of course, they're just going to tell you what you want to hear. Any new stern,

[14:17] they want to have it from you. But if you actually went out there,

[14:20] and looked at a few things, which you probably didn't, did you go to the Pinside Marketplace,

[14:25] Seth and new CMO, whatever his name is? Did you guys go to the Pinside Marketplace

[14:30] and look at how easy it is to get a Walking Dead? Did you look at the prices that used

[14:37] Walking Deads were selling for? And then you still marched in and said, yep, we're going to

[14:42] make a $13,000 version of this game. And it's going to do fine. No, you didn't. And now look

[14:49] where you're at.

[14:50] And I know people want to blame Kaneda. This is just simple stuff, guys. And yeah,

[14:55] I have a little bit. When I say it's personal, I have a little bit of a personal chip on my shoulder

[15:01] because I marched into that company, not as Kaneda, as Chris, a dude with 25 years of marketing

[15:07] experience. And I cared. They didn't even expect anything from me. I spent so long making an entire

[15:15] deck and an observation and an analysis of their company. They didn't even ask for it.

[15:20] I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do. And I did it because I cared.

[15:24] And I cared about their company. And I cared about their future. And I cared about

[15:27] the real issues at their door. And they ignored every single thing I said. And they just kept

[15:34] going down the same road, making boneheaded move after boneheaded move in the name of growth.

[15:40] So am I not, as a person, allowed to have a little bit of a personal annoyance with this company?

[15:49] When I talked to Buggin'

[15:50] Luke, they're always like, Chris, we want to hear your ideas. We want to hear what you have to say.

[15:54] We take everything you say into consideration. And I can see it. It's like when Buggin' Luke

[16:00] makes show games and I destroy them from a marketing standpoint from that. That's terrible.

[16:05] What's the next thing out of Luke's mouth? We're never making show games again.

[16:08] They listen. They know. And I say that not because I think Buggin' Luke are morons for

[16:14] doing show games. They just got caught up in it. And the only reason they're doing it is they wanted

[16:20] to feed the dealers in the distros who were crying to them that they wanted more games because the

[16:25] game was so hot. We all know that. And they're good people and they don't want to upset anybody.

[16:29] So they gave in, but they're not going to give in again. And that's the right move. And that's

[16:34] how you become great. You make decisions. You take some risks. Sometimes they work out. Sometimes

[16:40] they don't. And also you become great because you don't put growth and profit above everything else.

[16:48] You know, when you look at it and you just Google,

[16:50] if a company becomes too big, does it lose itself? And I know this is a little bit of an AI answer,

[16:58] but let me read this. And as I read this, tell me this does not feel like Stern Pinball right now.

[17:03] Getting too big can ruin a creative company by slowing down decision-making, diluting unique

[17:11] culture, creating bureaucracy, and losing the agility that fuels innovation, turning

[17:19] passion into success. And that's the way to do it. And that's the way to do it. And that's the way to do it.

[17:20] And that's the way to do it. And that's the way to do it. And that's the way to do it. And that's the way to do it.

[17:20] Individuals into cogs in a machine through unsustainable growth and a focus on process

[17:28] over people, though this can be mitigated by codifying expertise and maintaining core values.

[17:36] Okay. This sounds exactly what has happened over at Stern. And as I've been saying, and I said it

[17:44] to George, I said to Seth, and I'll say to each and every one of you right now, when I went into Stern,

[17:49] that was the first time I heard about Stern. And I said, well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[17:50] My main message, you have to get back to what made, what made your game so special,

[17:59] what made not just your LE so special, what made your brand so special. It's not insider connected.

[18:08] It's not stupid badges. It's not saying publicly, we only had eight months to make this game.

[18:14] It's not saying publicly, well, because of licensor issues, we couldn't put guns on John Wick.

[18:20] It's not saying publicly, we're never going to make more LEs. And then you make three,

[18:25] four different versions of Elvira. You make the Jaws premium 50th nicer than the LE. All this stuff,

[18:32] all this stuff. You think you can just keep shoveling this stuff out to the pinball buying

[18:37] community and we're just going to keep gobbling it up. And then I look at the other companies,

[18:42] man, I know exactly what's happening at every other boutique and the stuff they're coming with

[18:48] is the complete opposite.

[18:50] Look at like Barrels of Fun, for example, growth. No, David Van Ness just needs to make great games.

[18:55] And he knows, he knows like, see Dune, making Dune is like the result of picking a theme you

[19:02] think is going to be successful because of how big it is. And think about how crazy this is.

[19:08] You take a multi-billion dollar movie franchise and it can barely sell. And then you go to this

[19:16] obscure, unique, culturally interesting place.

[19:20] And you're like, oh, I'm going to go to this place called Winchester's Mystery House.

[19:22] This is the thing. The Winchester Mystery House story, the actual fact that it's out there in the

[19:28] real world and why it exists is so interesting and weird that it struck a nerve with our little

[19:36] subculture. Where Dune with Timothy Shama Lama Ding Dong dating Kylie Jenner, he's like the

[19:43] poster child for vanity and all the garbage of the world we're trying to escape. No wonder people

[19:48] don't want it.

[19:50] And that's it. That's what this hobby will always be. You find the things that make our subculture

[19:57] tick and you make a passionate interpretation of that thing and we will buy. And your growth will

[20:05] be incredible. And you won't have to bring in all these outside people that think they know better

[20:11] because they have some MBA where they studied other industries on how to grow. And then they

[20:17] come into the boardrooms and they crack the whips.

[20:20] And they're like, where are my results? Where are my sales? Oh, I'm going to bring in a new sales guy.

[20:24] I'm going to bring in a new CMO. I'm going to bring in a million and a half dollars of all new

[20:28] salaries. And that's going to make this company grow? No, no, that's never going to make it work.

[20:34] And I think when you see Pokemon, I mean this, I've heard it from many people now. When you see

[20:39] Pokemon, it is going to be the ultimate representation of a company that is fractured,

[20:44] a company that's not collaborating. It's going to be way more George Gomez than it is Jack

[20:50] Ranger. This isn't an everyone get in the room and let's make the world's biggest IP and let's

[20:55] make it magical. And let's show everybody what we're capable of as a company that works together.

[21:01] It is going to be a siloed, bureaucratic, made in a vacuum game. It's going to be soulless to

[21:08] the pinheads. It'll still sell well because of the IP. Mark my words, my belief when we see this

[21:15] game, it's going to be another pretty uninspired,

[21:19] empty, pretty barren game that they're going to blame the cost of the license as the reason why

[21:25] what's under the glass isn't nearly as special as a game like Lord of the Rings that came out

[21:31] freaking 22 years ago. And Stern Pinball, if they need to call a board meeting,

[21:38] they need to call a board meeting and reset the entire damn operation and get back to their core

[21:43] values so that people want to walk through that door and do somersaults into that,

[21:49] because it should be the greatest job on the planet. You are taking people that love pinball

[21:55] more than anything, and you've found a way to make a culture that is toxic enough where they

[22:00] don't even want to go in. They don't even want to go in. They clock in their hours and they're

[22:05] out the door. They've made it a simple transactional place to be for all of these super

[22:10] talented and super creative people. And it's not going to work out. They made their millions. They

[22:16] got so big, but they don't need to get bigger and bigger and bigger.

[22:19] Why? Why? What benefit does that have to the product? It doesn't work. Everybody, I love you.

[22:27] If there's someone who deserves more growth, it's freaking Canada's Pinball Podcast. At $5 a month,

[22:32] I'm going to put this show up for free. And I just want to say to everybody else out there,

[22:37] if more people spoke up, it would force Stern to change. Yeah, don't buy these mediocre games.

[22:44] They're going to have to make games better. Look at Beetlejuice. Look at Winchester.

[22:49] Look at Evil Dead. Look at Harry Potter, man. These games are amazing and they're just going to

[22:53] keep getting better. And then you look at Star Wars, a glowworm. You look at these new cabinets.

[23:00] You look at all the stuff they're doing. And trust me, when you see Pokemon, I'm almost like

[23:05] 95% sure those of you who love Pokemon, if I were to ask you, who would you want to make your

[23:11] dream theme now in 2026? How many of you are saying Stern number one? How many? None. None.

[23:19] And I'm telling you right now, you're going to be like, damn it, Canada was right. Then Iceman and

[23:23] Levy and Neil McRae are going to have to go on pin side. Yeah, man, I don't really like him,

[23:28] but he was kind of right about Pokemon. Kind of right about everything. Half the time, people,

[23:33] peace out.

[23:49] Yeah.
