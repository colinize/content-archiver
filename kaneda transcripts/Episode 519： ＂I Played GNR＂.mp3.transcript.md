[00:00] Okay, so I just played Guns and Roses for hours at Jack Bar.

[00:05] I mean, hours, it's eight o'clock right now, and I went down there at 3 p.m.

[00:10] So that's like four or five hours of playing Guns and Roses pinball.

[00:14] And I'm not even going to do intro music.

[00:17] I'm a little buzzed.

[00:18] I won't lie.

[00:19] I'm a little buzz.

[00:20] I was drinking, I was playing, I was having whiskey, I was having beer, and I just want

[00:25] to say this right now.

[00:28] And this is going to be like probably the most honest thing I can ever say on this pinball

[00:33] podcast.

[00:34] This game is the greatest pinball game I've ever played.

[00:38] And I mean that.

[00:40] And I've played Adam's family.

[00:42] I've played Medieval Madness.

[00:44] I've played them all, Monster Bash, Attack from Mars.

[00:49] Guns and Roses is the greatest pinball experience I've ever had.

[00:54] And maybe you might say it's because you love G&R.

[00:58] And I do love G&R.

[00:59] But it's more than that.

[01:01] It's more than that.

[01:02] It's the experience of what happens when you start a song in this game.

[01:09] And you see the lights, and you see the concert, and you see the crowd, and you see the footage

[01:15] that's on the screen and what's happening on the play field.

[01:19] This game makes every single pinball game I've ever played feel old, feel outdated, feel

[01:27] like obsolete in a way.

[01:29] It just does.

[01:30] It just does.

[01:31] I don't look, look, I just had a Rick and Morty.

[01:34] I just had a Rick and Morty in my home that I played for months.

[01:38] This game makes Rick and Morty feel so cheap and so uninspired.

[01:46] It's unbelievable.

[01:47] It is unbelievable how much better Guns and Roses is than Rick and Morty.

[01:54] And what's funny to me is this, is like this game at Jack Bar was in between Ninja Turtles

[01:59] and Hot Wheels.

[02:00] Like literally, it's like right between Ninja Turtles and Hot Wheels, and you can't even

[02:06] walk over to a Stern machine after playing Guns and Roses and take it seriously.

[02:11] I mean that.

[02:12] You cannot go over to a Stern machine after playing Guns and Roses and take it seriously

[02:21] on any level.

[02:22] It just feels like such an obsolete presentation of pinball.

[02:27] And I don't know any other way to say it.

[02:30] I mean this game is such a unique and step forward pinball experience that I just can't

[02:39] go back.

[02:40] I can't go back.

[02:41] Look, everything is not amazing in Guns and Roses.

[02:45] The one thing I didn't like about Guns and Roses, there's a few things I didn't like.

[02:49] I'll tell you two things I did not like about the game.

[02:53] First and foremost, I want to say this, it is not a multi-ball madness game.

[02:57] For those of you out there who think this game is always multi-ball, you're out of your

[03:01] minds.

[03:02] I played this game for hours.

[03:04] It wasn't like a constant multi-ball game.

[03:07] So you can rest assured that that's not going to happen.

[03:11] The thing I did not like about Guns and Roses is the plunge shot on the game.

[03:15] The plunge shot to me is the weakest part of this game.

[03:19] You've got this high energy rock and roll concert you want to jump into, right?

[03:24] And the plunge is so weak.

[03:26] It's so lame.

[03:28] It's like this limp dick experience where you just like you go up and it just slowly

[03:34] trickles down.

[03:35] I'm like, how is this the explosive way to enter a Guns and Roses show?

[03:41] Like it is the, to me, this is the biggest weak point of this game is the plunge.

[03:46] But other than that, once you're in the game, once you're in the game, the magic starts,

[03:52] okay?

[03:53] Now look, I know a lot of you out there are like, well, what about this?

[03:56] What about the upper play field?

[03:57] I'm telling you, you have to play this game.

[04:01] It is indescribable what happens in this game when you start a song and you start to

[04:09] enter the concert of G and R. It's unbelievable.

[04:13] It's unbelievable.

[04:14] I really, I can't even accurately describe it to you.

[04:18] But like we were playing Civil War and we were just like, when you start Civil War and

[04:24] at the very beginning of the song, it's like all the lighters are going.

[04:28] Like people holding up their lighters and then like, and then it just starts to bleed

[04:32] down from the top to the bottom, these red lights.

[04:36] It's so epic.

[04:38] Like so epic.

[04:39] Every song in this game has this epic presentation that just makes you want to try and get through

[04:46] the song.

[04:47] And that's why so many of you out there who are just seeing the multi balls, you don't

[04:51] get it.

[04:52] You don't get what this game is about.

[04:54] It's like trying to get through a song.

[04:57] It's amazing.

[04:58] This isn't just snippets of a song like Beatles.

[05:01] These are the full songs, right?

[05:03] Think about Beatles.

[05:05] They don't even give you like 30 seconds of a song.

[05:08] But more than anything, more than anything, like the shots are super smooth.

[05:13] There are no dimples on the play field.

[05:15] There's no dimples on the play field.

[05:17] The only dimples I saw were on the record.

[05:20] My voice is going.

[05:22] I'm just here to tell you right now, right now.

[05:25] This is the greatest pinball machine I've ever played.

[05:29] This pinball machine makes you feel something that know their machine does.

[05:34] And I get it.

[05:35] A lot of you tournament players that just want shots, you might be disappointed.

[05:40] But the fact of the matter is this, this machine creates an atmosphere that I've never

[05:47] seen before in a pinball machine.

[05:49] I've never seen it before.

[05:51] And it creates a feeling and a sensation that I've never felt before in a pinball machine.

[05:57] I'm sorry.

[05:58] And it does it over and over and over again.

[06:01] It's not just one thing.

[06:02] It's not just like when Adam's family gets to multiple.

[06:07] It's like there's 21 songs that just make you feel something so magical.

[06:14] And I hate to break it to everyone else out there.

[06:18] But you can not play guns and roses and then go back and play a stern.

[06:23] You can't.

[06:24] Once you play guns and roses, it makes every stern feel obsolete.

[06:30] I'm serious when I say that.

[06:32] This game makes every stern pinball machine just feel obsolete.

[06:38] It does.

[06:39] It does.

[06:40] There's just something about this experience.

[06:42] And you play it in a dark room with the lights going.

[06:45] You can't go back.

[06:47] You can't go play Avengers and get this.

[06:49] You can't play Ninja Turtles and get this.

[06:51] You can't play anything stern has to offer and get this experience.

[06:57] This is the greatest pinball experience I've ever had.

[07:03] And I don't care what any of you guys say.

[07:05] I don't care what any of you tournament players say.

[07:09] This is something special.

[07:11] This is something we've all been waiting for.

[07:14] And I can't wait to play it more.

[07:16] I can't wait to get deeper into this game.

[07:18] I can't wait to get my collector's edition.

[07:20] I'm not even going to edit this podcast.

[07:23] I'm a little buzz.

[07:23] I'm a little slurry.

[07:24] I'm just going to put this up there right now.

[07:27] If you're in on a guns and roses, you are going to be so satisfied with this game.

[07:33] This game is going to make you feel something.

[07:35] And you're going to see something you've never seen before in pinball.

[07:39] And it's not about some stupid mech that makes the ball do this or that.

[07:42] No, the whole game.

[07:44] The whole game just comes alive when you start a song.

[07:49] Now you need to start a song because it's once you're in the concert that this thing

[07:53] really begins.

[07:56] And I think this game embarrasses Rick and Morty.

[07:59] I think it embarrasses Ninja Turtles.

[08:01] Dude, I walked over.

[08:02] I'm being dead honest right now.

[08:05] I walked over from guns and roses.

[08:08] And I went and I played Iron Maiden a bunch of times.

[08:12] It's embarrassing.

[08:14] It's embarrassing.

[08:15] What guns and roses does to Iron Maiden.

[08:18] And you all voted Iron Maiden the best stern pinball machine of all time.

[08:24] If Iron Maiden is the best stern pinball machine of all time, y'all are in big trouble because

[08:31] this game is so much better.

[08:34] It just provides so much more enjoyment and fun than Iron Maiden.

[08:39] I'm sorry, it does.

[08:41] It does.

[08:43] And I'm not just showing this game.

[08:45] It's over.

[08:46] It's over.

[08:47] This is the new world order of pinball.

[08:52] And I can already hear Rare Hero trying to convince me that, you know, Rick and Morty, don't

[08:57] Rick and Morty has nothing compared to this.

[09:01] Rick and Morty is all clips and no shots.

[09:04] Rick and Morty light show is garbage compared to GNR.

[09:09] Iron Maiden has no feeling compared to GNR.

[09:12] No feeling, no soul.

[09:14] This game, it's like you're at a goddamn Guns and Roses concert.

[09:18] And you're gonna see it.

[09:20] And I'm gonna put this podcast up right now and I'm not apologizing.

[09:25] This game is modern pinball to the T. It is the new world order of pinball.

[09:31] And every other game is gonna be compared to this game.

[09:35] And I don't care if you think you're gonna get like Zeppelin in two weeks or another

[09:40] Stern machine, Stern pinball cannot compete with this game.

[09:45] They can't unless they up their Annie.

[09:48] Alright, I don't even care.

[09:49] I'm not even doing outro music.

[09:51] This game is gonna blow you away.

[09:54] Nobody is gonna buy Guns and Roses and not be blown away.

[09:57] Alright, I don't even care.

[09:59] I'm not even ending this show.

[10:00] It's over.

[10:01] Bye.
