[00:00] Lately I haven't been giving a damn I try to make everyone happy but I still never win

[00:04] But what's the point I'm putting a mask in being pretend when everybody they know me like they know why yeah

[00:16] I think we got a good shot of winning this week in Tim Ball's greatest pinball podcast in the world

[00:21] I mean we're pretty much a shoe in for this one aren't we guys?

[00:25] In 1200 people you guys all voted for canadus pinball podcast. Thank you so much. I appreciate it

[00:30] You know, it's funny is I bet Nate shivers wins and he does like to podcast the entire year

[00:37] We saw the pinball pinheads podcast came back the Australian blokes are back on the airwaves

[00:43] I really miss those guys. I used to love that show. I used to love the production value of it

[00:49] But what we've seen over the last like year and a half is you can't do a pinball podcast and only do it like once a month

[00:56] It doesn't work anymore unless you're like spooky and you're focused more on your company and it's more of like a show

[01:02] But if you want to cover the industry you got to hit it on a weekly basis and that's what we're gonna do on this episode

[01:08] I believe it's one

[01:10] 89 of canadus pinball podcast and the first news the first news is I have now become victim

[01:19] To stern quality and we have to start out this podcast by saying my

[01:24] $15,000 Batman super Ellie has broken

[01:29] Okay, now the word broken is dramatic it's not like there's a major major issue

[01:35] But I turned on the game a couple days ago now

[01:38] Albeit this is just only after two weeks of ownership. I turn the game on and all of a sudden as it's booting

[01:46] I see the message

[01:48] Node board eight not recognize something like that

[01:52] So it's not detecting node board number eight and we know that this is a problem that has been plaguing stern machines

[02:01] For a while now that these node boards are prone to failing and I just had one fail and so what does that mean?

[02:10] Where do you go from there?

[02:12] Well, you call up Stern and I called their number one was 888 kickers

[02:18] I got someone on the phone immediately which is actually a good sign when you have a human being on the other end of the phone

[02:25] And I explained to the situation that was a Batman super Ellie owner and I got this message and he's like, you

[02:31] Sounds like you got a node board issue. It's probably fried

[02:36] Contact your distributor. I was like, okay

[02:39] So I reached out to Christmas and they immediately got back to me and said what is the serial number on the game and

[02:45] Your address and we'll get you a new node board eight now

[02:49] I did post this on Facebook and a lot of people said well it might just be a loose connector. I

[02:55] Redid all the connections on the node board. I

[02:58] Unplugged the USB cables not USB cables. They're like they almost look like like landline cables these black things that connect the boards as well

[03:07] No dice every connector was checked every connector was put in and out

[03:12] Game is still not working and it's weird so when node board eight goes out the lights are all

[03:19] Daisy chained so what happens is when you go to start a game with node board eight

[03:23] Not recognized it's searching for pinballs. It doesn't find any even though there are pinballs in the game

[03:29] The entire only like the upper left portion of the game

[03:33] It works them in terms of the lights in terms of the mechs everything from the center

[03:39] Down the Daisy chain doesn't function or doesn't work so

[03:45] fustrating but not crippling of a of an issue

[03:50] It does suck though, right? I think a lot of people are really nervous about the long-term reliability of these node boards

[03:57] so what does this mean to in terms of should you be stockpiling

[04:03] Stern node boards what caused it to fail now?

[04:07] We know there was a service ball tin that went out that

[04:10] Explained how some of these node boards are having issues and they have a fix for them

[04:14] But here's the problem is Stern doesn't have the fix in stock so

[04:19] They know there's an engineering issue with the games. They're still shipping games with those issues

[04:25] The current fix or service bulletin announcement that went out if you're a customer

[04:30] You can't even get those parts

[04:32] So are you supposed to just keep your games turned off until you get those things or play the game at your own risk?

[04:38] I don't know and it is like a role of the dice because not everybody's having node board failures

[04:44] That also makes me very nervous that

[04:47] There isn't that consistency. Why would one board fail and not another?

[04:51] these parts are all

[04:54] Engineered the same so is every game a ticking time bomb and I think that is the very very big concern

[05:00] With modern Sterns is what will the future hold for support with these games and I'll say it

[05:07] I got it I got it I got it be brutally honest here

[05:10] You should not buy a brand new pinball machine play it in a home use only environment less than a couple hundred times

[05:19] And it breaks

[05:20] That there's just no excuse for that how did it's bad engineering of these boards and there's just no excuse and I only have one pinball machine

[05:30] So it is it is unfortunate that during the holidays my Batman is out of commission

[05:36] I wish it wasn't I have all this free time and the only thing I can't do is play pinball

[05:42] So hopefully I get a new board soon

[05:44] Hopefully Stern maybe bumps me up quickly on the on the on the list to mail out because I have a pinball podcast and now

[05:51] All of you know that

[05:53] Stern node boards are not great and I hope they make this fix happen sooner than later

[06:00] So that's all I can say on that. I'm disappointed. I really am

[06:04] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world? So there is like a scandal going on. Did you see this whole like nifty led

[06:12] Playboy

[06:14] Restoration sort of dramatic thread that blew up on pinside it became something like

[06:19] 25 pages of back and forth the community chiming in

[06:25] All I'll break down the summary of this whole thing. I don't want to like

[06:29] I don't have it open on me right now

[06:31] But a gentleman went to nifty led to get his playboy machine restored about three years ago

[06:38] They quote him a price on what that restoration would cost

[06:43] That price was roughly around

[06:46] $2,000 okay now keep in mind three years go by pretty much

[06:51] He checks in they're doing this they're doing that

[06:55] The game is finally finished after such a long wait and nifty led comes back to him and says now you always

[07:03] Kind of around I think it was like

[07:06] $800 some almost like $5,000 for the work that they had quoted him

[07:11] At around 2000 and so the the owners like what what are you talking about like this isn't the price you quoted

[07:19] And nifty responded by saying

[07:22] Well, we did all this other work. We'd chrome this we chrome that but the problem is a lot of that work was what was in the initial quote

[07:29] And there was just no way to add up the total to equal what they were saying the gentleman owed

[07:34] Okay, so that was like this guy starts a thread on pin side and says nifty led has stolen my game

[07:42] Now the reason why he said they had stolen the game is the story gets even better

[07:47] So when the gentleman refuses to pay the super inflated price that nifty led put on the machine

[07:54] nifty led then went and listed this guy's game for sale

[07:59] Uh on ebay and other sites where pinball machines are sold on facebook. I believe can you just look

[08:06] So that is incredible that they had someone's merchandise and

[08:12] Because he wouldn't pay almost double what they quoted him

[08:16] They were gonna try and sell it and they were listing it for $5,000 and so that created a shitstorm as you can imagine now

[08:25] It turns out that nifty led is obviously two people. I believe it's uh

[08:29] I think it's Daniel and Nathan. I think those are the two gentlemen who run nifty led

[08:34] Obviously when something like this happens in the community

[08:37] The community activates and everyone is on a mission to get justice and have justice served and I'll say this

[08:44] This is one of the really

[08:46] Beneficial things of a place like pin side and a pinball community that is vocal and online and here's why

[08:53] Because if you are in the pinball business and nifty led is you know

[08:58] I really know them from the pinball podcast every time they would do one their show was sponsored by nifty led's

[09:05] So if your business is pinball

[09:07] You need to be in the the uh the good graces of the pinball community and you don't want your company

[09:15] And your company's reputation to be dragged through the mud on pin side worth thousands of potential customers of yours

[09:23] Are are spending hours and hours a day on that site right the other part is you want to then

[09:30] Take your business to different shows and and different expose and you want to be a vendor that people like

[09:36] And then you need that to stay in business and so for this scandal the break

[09:41] It can run it can run a small business whose focus is within a niche hobby like pinball

[09:47] And so the community went to get justice served so

[09:51] Long story short. I was just catching up on this thread and it seems like the the title of the thread has changed now

[09:57] Does something about like ball dog playboy game? I don't even know like I could I'm not gonna read 25 pages of these guys going back and forth

[10:04] But long story short in an effort to salvage their reputation

[10:08] nifty led has given the gentleman his game back for free

[10:13] Said here we're sorry what we did was a mistake

[10:16] Here's your game

[10:18] Here's your game

[10:19] So they did the right thing and giving him his game back now people are calling on the the original poster or the owner

[10:27] To pay nifty led what the original price was and look

[10:33] What would create a win-win scenario would it be that do you think nifty led should pay for what they did in terms of

[10:42] You know listing this man's game for sale obviously that was an idiotic move

[10:47] It was one of the owners of nifty led that did that and heard the other owner was super pissed off and chewed him out

[10:53] But as people have said it had it the other guy not know he was gonna do that is that something he would just go off and do on his own

[11:00] The stories over though. It's been resolved

[11:03] But this is a good example of I think what happens a lot a lot in this hobby

[11:09] It happened to me a lot in the arcade collecting hobby

[11:13] When you pay someone to do a job

[11:16] There's certain things that I feel always get messed up

[11:20] One is the time frame by which people quote you in which the job will be done

[11:25] I want to tell you a quick little story

[11:27] I once had a guy

[11:29] Said to me. I was said I want to I want to get a big blue capcom street fighter two championed edition

[11:36] And I put it out there on the sides who could restore one for me and make it perfect

[11:41] I had a gentleman reach out to me. He was one of these like arcade

[11:45] distributors

[11:45] He said Chris I can do that

[11:47] We agreed on a price of two thousand dollars. He said he could do it within

[11:52] I think six months and the game would be done and he'd have it for me. Okay. I was all excited

[11:58] I paid him the money, but not only that I sent him a new old stock big translate of street fighter two and I also bought a

[12:06] 400

[12:07] The CPU for the game that ran I think street fighter two like turbo something right so and and those were things that I gave to him

[12:16] Additional on top of the two thousand dollars that were of value so he can make my street fighter two

[12:22] Okay, what happens?

[12:24] Six months go by he starts giving me these stories about how it's taking longer to find the artwork that he wants to make sure

[12:30] It's perfect because he knows I have such pristine games. I said okay take your time

[12:34] You know, I don't run in our in our Kate. I don't need it tomorrow

[12:37] So he goes off he does that

[12:40] About a year goes by and I get fed up and said look it's been it's been almost double what you said it would take

[12:47] And he said like I know no, I know I know it'll it'll be done soon

[12:50] So about like a few weeks later

[12:51] He then sends me photos of what he's been restoring and working on for a year of of the street fighter two

[12:59] Champion in addition that's supposed to be perfect

[13:02] It's supposed to be you know two thousand dollars is a shitload of money for a street fighter

[13:06] But I will always pay more for a great version of a game

[13:09] sends me the pictures the colors are all wrong the blue doesn't look anything like the capcom blue

[13:15] It's like a much darker blue the artwork around the bezel is terribly cut

[13:19] It's it's clearly like reproduction cheap shit. That's not anywhere near what the the original look like

[13:25] um

[13:26] So then I say forget it this doesn't even look like what I want

[13:29] If this doesn't reflect what we agreed upon

[13:33] Can you please give me my money back?

[13:35] So he gives me a refund

[13:36] But I said also can you please return my translate and my cpu he never did never heard from him again multiple messages

[13:44] Multiple phone calls he kept my stuff, okay?

[13:48] And it's stuff like that that happens all the time in this hobby

[13:51] I had another arcade dealing that went down a little similar where the time frame was just like off by a year

[13:58] To the point where the guy was awesome. He's like look

[14:00] I owed another like 1500 bucks, and he was like you know what?

[14:02] I'm just I feel bad. I'm gonna scratch that. I'm gonna send you the game

[14:06] So but this happens all the time and without forums without people to keep these companies honest

[14:14] I think this would happen a lot more you know people who

[14:18] Enter into an agreement or a contract with someone you have to hold up your end of the bargain and that end of the bargain

[14:25] Isn't just the price. It's how long you said the restore would be what you said would go into the restore all of that stuff

[14:33] All of that stuff matters because people have lives they have schedules they have they don't want to have their money tied up in something for three years

[14:42] They also want to enjoy the toy they bought and not wait forever to get it back

[14:46] So I'm happy to see this as resolved if I was this guy

[14:50] I wouldn't pay nifty led one more dime for what they did

[14:53] I think that is absolutely ridiculous and they deserve to be punished by not seeing a dime on this

[14:59] And they're lucky that their company isn't isn't gonna collapse because of such a stupid move and that's my take on it

[15:06] All right

[15:07] Let's move on to who Dini American pinball so

[15:13] We kept hearing who Dini would ship by the end of the year

[15:17] It is

[15:19] According to my calculations. I'm gonna check. I don't even it's December

[15:24] 23rd

[15:26] They don't have many more days left to get who Dini out

[15:31] Is it a big deal not really nobody's paid for one in fall. I hope not most people just have

[15:37] $250 deposits. I saw JJ at game exchange said the first five they get are gonna go out on location

[15:45] I think it's like Wyoming Seattle Colorado. There's he's got five locations none of them are New York City

[15:50] So I'm not gonna be able to get it anytime soon

[15:54] um

[15:55] But look look people are excited for this title

[15:59] I am I hope they can get it out soon. I know they want to get it right. They want to get it right

[16:04] I'll say this now is a really bad time

[16:08] To sell pinball machines

[16:11] Because it's it's like the holidays. It's weird. It's like I think you got to get games shipping

[16:17] Uh, in or or ask for people's payments because games are about to ship in in like November early December

[16:24] But I think if you get too close to Christmas January

[16:27] I think people put the brakes on it and I'll tell you why they put the brakes on because they check

[16:33] Their balances on their credit cards and they are shocked

[16:38] I just did it last night. I was like wait what oh

[16:41] Oh, you know, it's like oh, I forgot I got that I forgot I got this I forgot all these things I bought

[16:48] It's gifts this and that I got to tip the dormant in New York City buildings all these things add up

[16:53] And you're like, you know what maybe I it's not the right time to buy a pinball machine

[16:57] Speaking of not the right time to buy a pinball machine. I was sort of sad to see this post

[17:02] Uh, it was a post from waspinator

[17:05] And for those of you on pinside waspinners is guy who's like really animated he makes these great twitch videos

[17:11] Uh, he made a great sort of video of guardians of the galaxy when he when it came out

[17:16] And he was the first to sort of reveal to the world the the code

[17:20] But he does it in this really animated way

[17:22] But he also

[17:24] Is a guy that like flips machines super quickly and it's kind of unclear why he even buys them if he gets rid of them

[17:30] Like a week later like you don't go buy a new pinball machine

[17:34] And then put it up for sale a week later

[17:36] And then just lose money on it and constantly be flipping and losing because it catches up to you

[17:42] But he put up a post that basically said I'm gonna summarize

[17:45] I can't afford to buy any more new pins. I'm in debt. I owe people money

[17:49] I'm down on my luck and you know you guys can call me names if you want

[17:54] But I really uh, I want any like any advice on how you think I can still have pinball be a part of my life

[18:00] And it just goes to show that this hobby has everybody on both ends of the spectrum

[18:06] We've got multi-millionaires who have incredible collections

[18:10] Who drive for worries who drive porches who have multi-million dollar homes

[18:16] And then we have a guy on the other end who owes money can afford one machine and both of those dudes are in the same room on

[18:24] Pins side

[18:25] Now people have given this guy advice and I've said it before

[18:28] This is a rich man's hobby. It is a rich man's hobby

[18:31] There if you and by that I've always said the new inbox world is a rich man's hobby

[18:36] You can't be buying new inbox pinball machines

[18:39] You should have at least at least

[18:42] 10 times the cost of a pinball machine in your savings if you even consider

[18:48] Buying a pinball machine new inbox at least 10 times. So that means if you have a

[18:52] six thousand dollar pinball machine you want to buy you should have at least

[18:56] $60,000 in savings. Okay, you should

[18:59] I look I think that's even like I think you should have

[19:04] 100 times

[19:06] But you should at least you should have at least like 20 times in savings before you start thinking about these toys

[19:12] The reason why is the world is expensive things are expensive

[19:16] And if you have like a mortgage to pay and you have all this stuff going on you have student loans you have debts left and right

[19:23] Buying pinball machines is an idiotic place to put your money

[19:26] And I know people don't want to admit it

[19:28] But whenever you look at the market performance versus pinball performance

[19:33] It's stupid to ever even think about these things as being like a goodbye

[19:37] I mean I met with my financial advisor and I think we're like we're up 16% on everything I gave her for the year

[19:43] Which is great and now I can go buy like here's the thing

[19:46] I can go buy like all these pinball machines on the money we made

[19:50] But if I went and bought all these pinball machines and didn't invest money

[19:54] There's no money that is being earned and I know like a lot of you out there are very financials

[19:58] financially savvy have great jobs some of you may not be

[20:02] It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I treat all of you with respect

[20:06] I respect anyone who loves pinball

[20:08] The advice is always simple live within your means or even better yet my father would always say this the venerable George Peter

[20:17] Chloris love the man still a lot of great guy

[20:20] He always would say to me live below your means

[20:24] That is the key to peace of mind later in life

[20:27] And he also would say to me a couple of other things create something of value in the money will come and he would say to me

[20:33] Don't ever think tomorrow will bring what today brings in terms of your money

[20:38] And I think a lot of people live that way they they think they're always gonna have the job

[20:42] That's gonna be earning them what it is now

[20:44] They're always gonna you know, they don't have to worry about the future

[20:48] And he would also the final thing you say how much do I live for today and how much do I live for tomorrow

[20:55] If you if you sort of plan your life that way you should come out on top

[21:00] You know my aunt who passed away. I loved her to death. She lived in New York City

[21:05] She looked on the surface like a very successful wealthy woman and she was for a while. She was very successful

[21:11] But she never planned for the future and it was really sad

[21:14] It was really sad when you open up someone's apartment and there's expensive coats and bags and there's nothing in the accounts

[21:23] Right, it's because a lot of us get used to a lifestyle and I think in pinball a lot of people get used to a lifestyle

[21:31] Of constantly buying and flipping and enjoying these machines and other areas of life might hit hard and if you're not prepared for them

[21:39] You know, you're gonna get yourself in trouble

[21:42] You're gonna get yourself in trouble. So I hope everyone this holiday and into into the next year

[21:47] Really puts all this in perspective and don't do something stupid and never ever ever ever

[21:52] Make pinball the priority never. I think waspender has like another kid coming

[21:57] He's got a woman to take care of don't you shouldn't be buying a pinball machine

[22:01] You should be putting money away for your kids college

[22:05] They come on everybody wake the fuck up on some of this stuff

[22:08] I never want to see people making pinball the priority. All right

[22:13] Happy holidays, right? This is like canada on the soap box as your

[22:17] resident psychologist all right alien pinball

[22:21] Everyone's favorite thread

[22:24] It's like the thread that just keeps on giving so

[22:28] Basically the news is this

[22:31] They are finally starting to ship out Ellie machines. It sounds like I think some are gonna go out in Europe now

[22:39] They have revealed and we talked about this on the last podcast. They've revealed the armor for the game

[22:45] Which I have said I think is hideous. I think the purple and the purple the blue and the green look

[22:52] Terrible on the machine the black is gonna be the way to go

[22:56] The fact that they have not decided to only offer one Ellie trim

[23:01] I think goes the show that these gentlemen

[23:04] Just don't get it. They don't get it. You shouldn't make your Ellie

[23:10] Like sort of like this DIY

[23:12] Customize it it just makes it more of a nightmare for them with the assembly line of this game

[23:18] We saw now that you can get the full translate

[23:22] Backbox with orcs artwork on it and you and now they they've removed finally removed the 35th

[23:30] anniversary from the name of the game

[23:33] They've removed it

[23:34] So if you look at the side art it just says limited edition

[23:37] But I want to do something right now. I want to go to highway pinball.com

[23:42] Highway pinball.com

[23:44] I'm doing this live and when I want to look up

[23:47] What's on their website and see if the language still says 35th anniversary edition because I just I'd like to know if companies actually like our consistent

[23:56] All right, I'm going on their side the alien pinball promo video

[23:59] I'm just gonna go to alien pinball

[24:02] The link and what do we see where to buy where to buy where to buy alien pinball. Okay, here it is

[24:07] Um

[24:08] All right, so I actually I was on the site and it started playing the alien video which was annoying

[24:13] But I realized you can't buy directly from them anymore. You have to buy from distributor

[24:17] So it's I guess it's off the website. I don't see the 35th anniversary. So that's good

[24:21] um, here's here's what made me laugh and

[24:25] This is just like

[24:27] I know I nitpick and you wouldn't listen to this show if you didn't hear me nitpick about the silliness and the terrible marketing

[24:34] That takes place in this industry. I think pinball marketing is probably the most piss poor marketing in the world and

[24:41] So I went back and I was looking at the photos where they were showing off the armor. Okay, so you're these guys, right these

[24:47] These new investors that you're you're trying to get people excited for the alien Ellie version

[24:53] Everyone's been waiting years for this game and you're gonna take a really nice high definition photo of what the game looks like and share it to the world for the first time

[25:04] So

[25:05] Why in the world if you look at the photo of like the blue armor? Why would you

[25:10] Take the photo with the game sitting on a pinball jack with the legs actually off the ground floating in mid air

[25:20] You got that ugly thing underneath the game itself. That's the image you decide to use

[25:27] To show the car off for the first time. Hey, you think Dodge is gonna show the demon off with like the car jacked up

[25:33] And like hey like here it is like what I just it's just you know, I get it. I get it. This is like really me like

[25:40] Like like going for nothing, but at the end of the day

[25:44] It just goes to show that I don't think anyone in the pinball marketing world is even like decent like even understands

[25:53] Hey, like why don't we do this right and I'm sorry, but if it's your company and you have one chance to reveal something or share an image with the community

[26:03] Make it count make it count

[26:06] I mean remember when Andrew highway used to have is like don't you miss the Andrew highway days where he used to have the factory tours

[26:12] And there just be like nobody in there and then there'd be like maybe like one dude with a screwdriver

[26:17] And he's like here's the L.E. Here's the Brian Allen artwork all of that obviously, you know, it wasn't accurate

[26:24] And sort of miss those days. I missed those days

[26:27] Um, look

[26:28] The other part and this just continues to play and this is like weekly

[26:31] I just keep hearing more and more about certain things every time I go into the alien thread all I hear are there issues with the game

[26:39] there issues with the game and

[26:41] Because there's not that many games going out

[26:45] I mean, I think quality is a problem. We saw someone post on there

[26:50] That when they turn their alien machine on so he just gets it brand new inbox. He turns his machine on and all the sudden

[26:57] The on every screen there's like two different images on the screen the image that's supposed to be on the airlock screen

[27:05] Was also appearing on every other screen and it looked like there was like basically like an image layered on top of an image and he couldn't figure out why and

[27:15] Um, was it helmet the guy who's like helping everybody the coder?

[27:20] He basically said that well, that's probably because

[27:23] The cable that's supposed to go you know into the pc from the airlock is probably plugged into the wrong

[27:29] Input and that's what's creating that and so then

[27:33] I think Ted said it

[27:34] Well, doesn't anyone turn these games on at the factory and test them

[27:39] Before they're going out to customers and a mistake like that

[27:44] Really really goes to show that no one even turned the game on because that's something that you would know just right away that this cable is in the wrong spot

[27:50] But it just goes to show these games are gonna be rushed out

[27:55] They haven't made the changes to a lot of the engineering issues that plague Andrew highway

[28:00] I mean, I'm seeing more and more issues with Xeno mech heads with like the ball kickouts

[28:05] It's it's you know it's parts of the game are like touching the glass too close

[28:11] Which probably is what is caused a lot of those glasses to shatter when they ship the game

[28:16] so

[28:17] Look I I think the next few months

[28:21] I think these guys just need to like I've never seen a game that's had more cuddling than alien

[28:26] It's like we've heard about it now for four years

[28:29] It's unbelievable imagine if Stern took four years to just even get a certain game out

[28:36] Imagine if Jersey Jack did that and when it came out it had like all these problems and this and that

[28:42] I mean

[28:44] I guess Jack went through those those those growing pains right but these guys are still stuck in it like forever

[28:51] so

[28:52] I don't know if you're in on an alien speaking of you on an alien tomorrow though

[28:57] You don't have to wait you don't have to wait you can simply go on eBay and buy one there is an alien pinball machine for sale

[29:07] At a Chicago for the a standard edition machine which was originally $6,500

[29:14] There's one for sale for the extremely affordable price of 11,000 dollars and as the

[29:22] seller describes it

[29:23] Get this ultra rare machine in your home before Christmas. It's amazing. It's the best game ever

[29:29] You we keep hearing this like aliens the best like theme integrated pin of all time

[29:34] Can we can everyone just stop with that nonsense? It is not the best theme integrated pin of all time

[29:39] I'll tell you why because Sigourney Weaver Ripley is not in the god damn game

[29:45] How can alien pinball be one of the best theme integrations and the freaking main character from the films is not even in the machine

[29:54] If you said it has one of the best sounds and maybe light shows I'll give you that

[29:59] But theme integration stop

[30:02] There's all this the you know, I'm getting tired again of all the apologists in the thread if you read it

[30:08] It's issue after issue with the game no one has ever said I've opened up my alien

[30:14] It's been rock solid since day one nothing's gone wrong you never see that and and look and now the fans are also saying

[30:23] Why didn't highway pinball listen to all of us?

[30:26] There are so many nicer armor packages available that they could have gone with

[30:31] Instead they went with the armor that the community has vocally said we don't like

[30:37] And yet that's what they have to get and you've waited over four years for this moment

[30:43] And you're still compromising and I just think the reality is this people are not sending their money in

[30:48] Nobody's on board except for like these 20

[30:51] Apologist and shills on pinside they know it

[30:55] They've done everything I don't think they've done anything correctly after taking over the helm from Andrew

[31:00] I don't blame them. I don't think there's anything they could have done

[31:05] Other than

[31:07] Continue to try and manufacture the game that Andrew highway

[31:11] Designed and had built and so whatever issues plague that they were there were bound to be far more than they ever could have intended

[31:19] I actually feel

[31:21] Really bad for these gentlemen

[31:23] But as other people have said it you know Ryan said it over it head to head pinball

[31:28] I don't understand why there was this like need to make sure this game came out

[31:33] I just don't get why all this money and time have been been invested into a game that had many issues that

[31:41] Still to this day have not been corrected and if it wasn't named alien right if this was full throttle having these issues

[31:49] or

[31:50] Or does it animal house? What are the other games like if this was like even clean having these it would have been game over

[31:57] See you later nobody cares, but because people love this theme so much

[32:02] There's just been every dickless amount of time put into savaging what's happened with this game all right

[32:08] I'm gonna move on but you guys have spoken with your wall. It's so let me read you a speaking of highway pinball

[32:14] Who I did say would have real trouble surviving in 2018 the other company that I think is just I

[32:21] Mean how are these guys gonna survive is Dutch pinball?

[32:25] Let me read you the Dutch pinball update that went out Friday

[32:29] So

[32:30] Here is their update welcome to another update about the status of the production of the big Lebowski pinball in our last newsletter

[32:38] We informed you that we tested engineering sample number two and the Dutch pinball open or at the Dutch pinball open and that it performed very well

[32:49] We also told you that Barry was going to visit the side tech factory in China for the second time in the beginning of December

[32:59] Barry returned the 15th and spent two weeks in training

[33:05] The side tech production team on further assembly instructions and testing the final product

[33:11] God that must have been a real fun two weeks for Barry

[33:14] Can you imagine that having to fly to China in December and train a bunch of people

[33:19] Probably through like a mediator on how to build a pinball machine for the first time

[33:24] Okay, I'll keep going

[33:26] The team is learning pretty quickly and will now finish engineering samples three four and five

[33:33] Before preparing everything for production

[33:37] We will start ordering parts for the first batch of the big Lebowski's

[33:41] You know, I just want to stop like that line they use this line

[33:47] So much we're going to start ordering parts as if like

[33:51] Well, oh, well, they're ordering parts so that must mean things are going great

[33:55] That must mean I'm going to get my game that I've been waiting years for you know

[33:59] It's it's ironic that the Dutch pinball's tagline again marketing at play if you're going to say something

[34:05] And you're going to name your company something and add a tagline to your company

[34:09] You best own up to that so the Dutch pinball tagline is

[34:14] It's a whole new game exclamation point

[34:17] I find it ironic that their tagline is it's a whole new game

[34:21] When every time they surface it's the same old story with these guys

[34:27] It's always about

[34:29] Here's the production update which is usually no update at all

[34:34] Nothing is happening. They said they'd have games out by December

[34:38] Now it's like they're not even going to go into production until probably like

[34:42] Early as what February?

[34:44] I want to I want to finish this email that I'm going to just keep going on these guys so

[34:49] The team is learning quickly

[34:50] We understand that you want to know when your game will be assembled but at this stage it is impossible to predict

[34:59] Okay, let me stop there

[35:01] So you you you gave these guys money years ago

[35:05] You've been waiting forever

[35:07] They came out at

[35:10] You know the different shows expo tpf they said they had a plan to get new games built

[35:15] They were going to work with a new contract manufacturer

[35:17] They were going to build the games in China

[35:20] They I think they originally said games would come out by the end of this year. That's what they were looking for

[35:25] Okay, it's now almost January and

[35:30] All of what we know comes from them

[35:33] They're working with the manufacturing company in China

[35:37] And the new release date is

[35:40] An impossibility to predict

[35:43] impossibility

[35:45] Does that give you any confidence? Does that make you feel like

[35:50] This new plan is going to work

[35:53] Do you feel confident in training people in China who have never built a pinball machine before?

[35:58] How to do it?

[36:00] You know they were building this game initially with the contract manufacturer that was in their backyard

[36:06] But if they had an issue they could drive the car right a bike probably to go talk to

[36:11] That they could personally be on site to make sure the products leaving were we're up to spec

[36:17] You know, it now they're all the way in China. Very has to fly to China

[36:22] How much does a flight to China cost

[36:25] Is it cheap?

[36:26] How much is it going to cost to get parts sent from

[36:30] China to Netherlands to the US?

[36:33] Is that going to be easy and affordable?

[36:36] So let me finish off the email

[36:41] All right

[36:42] The Zitec team is doing well, but it will still take some time to get things started

[36:49] In our last newsletter we also mentioned that we will start promoting the big Lebowski in Europe

[36:56] For this we will be present at the eag international in London

[37:01] January 16 through the 18th

[37:04] You can visit us there and play the big Lebowski pinball

[37:08] For more information about eag please visit so what does that mean?

[37:13] We're going to be promoting it in Europe

[37:16] Okay

[37:18] It means

[37:19] They need money

[37:21] And they need money badly and they need to get this game out to shows

[37:27] So people play it and joy it and buy it and go in on it

[37:32] They need new investors

[37:34] They need those investors to be consumers

[37:37] They have failed to ever line up outside financial investment

[37:43] To get this thing corrected

[37:46] I am really just

[37:48] I don't know what had to feel good about this

[37:51] I really don't

[37:53] There's nothing you can do we've said this

[37:55] You're on this boat

[37:56] You are on this train if you gave these guys your money

[37:59] When I see lines like the Zitek team is doing well

[38:03] But it will still take some time to get things started

[38:08] How much time?

[38:10] How much more time do you need to build a game that you've already built

[38:14] To build a game that you already took money on

[38:17] To build a game

[38:19] Whose money that you already took you now lost

[38:23] And now you're going to try and like crawl out of a hole

[38:27] From China with the team that's never really assembled a pinball machine before

[38:32] And are going to deliver a quality product that's going to be worth the wait

[38:36] And the only way you can get old people their games

[38:39] The early achiever people their games

[38:41] Is if you go to Europe and get new buyers to go in

[38:46] And then what you're going to do is you're going to have to sort of take some new money

[38:52] And send new people their games before old people get their games

[38:56] But you're going to have to do a little bit of a juggling act right

[38:59] Which means if you do the math the only way

[39:04] To actually you know a piece some early achievers

[39:07] Is you're going to end up taking new order money to build an old order game whose money is now gone

[39:14] And then that new order guy the only way you're going to be able to build his game

[39:18] Is if you get new money in the door

[39:20] Now the last time I checked

[39:23] About how Ponzi business models worked

[39:26] Is that not how it works

[39:29] You see this is the problem I have

[39:31] And this is nothing personal against barrier job

[39:33] This we've seen this happen many times in pinball companies

[39:37] When there's no more money or the money that was given is gone

[39:41] You can't manufacture money out of thin air

[39:44] And I wish I had I wish we were reading better news

[39:48] I wish people were getting their pinball

[39:51] Games by now

[39:52] And I still for the life of me cannot understand

[39:55] That the agreement with a Ra was so bad

[39:59] That they couldn't have figured out of fix

[40:02] I think what they should have done and I said this from the beginning

[40:06] Is they should have said look a Ra fine like it cost you more

[40:10] I know we priced it here. What's it going to cost it like what what do you want per game

[40:16] And if they had said to everybody look the new price of the big Lebowski pinball

[40:20] Is $12,500 we are sorry, but that is the reality

[40:24] Our contract manufacturer is going to pull the plug unless we pay more per game

[40:28] We hate to do this, but we need more but you'll get your games. There's 40 built and they'll go out

[40:34] I think they would have been shipping games and pumping games out still

[40:38] Instead a year and a half later we've got no new games out

[40:43] This deal isn't going to go any smoother

[40:46] I don't think it instills any more confidence

[40:49] Whatever a Ra wanted

[40:51] Dutch should have gave them

[40:54] Is this has it gone better since they walked away

[40:58] And I can't imagine that they couldn't have come to some sort of agreement. I just can't

[41:03] How is this a better solution? You had a company that was fully told

[41:07] Making your games in your backyard

[41:09] And you decided to

[41:12] Take your consumers down the road that again all this is costing you money every time you go on a plane every time you do this every time you do that

[41:19] You're burning more of the capital

[41:22] To keep this thing alive. So

[41:25] That's it. That's where we're at with Dutch

[41:27] I feel bad for my friends who are in on it. I really do. I still think the game is phenomenal

[41:32] I wish they would have figured this out by now

[41:35] Because I still think it is one of the greatest world under glasses one of the best theme in a greater pins of all time and the berry and yop

[41:41] I just want you guys to know if you listen to this podcast

[41:44] I really think you guys were onto something very special

[41:48] And I think now is a time where you either got to like

[41:53] Give yourself a deadline. We can't just have this thing drag on for years and years and years

[41:59] And if you really need money you need to go take your product go to some investors some venture capitalist and get money

[42:06] But you can't do it this way. You just can't you got to find your angel investor the way jack found his

[42:13] That is why Jersey Jack is still in business if you think it's for any other reason

[42:17] It wasn't because of the love of pinball. It wasn't because he made amazing quality machines

[42:22] It was because he found someone who believed in him and had a lot of money go find that person

[42:28] It's not going to be the regular customer. All right

[42:32] What else what else in his edition 189 of canators pinball podcast

[42:37] Oh, let's see. I do have some show notes monster bash

[42:41] So monster bash is going to be the next title. I think monster bash is going to be

[42:46] Uh, a jug or not in sales next year and I'll explain why and we haven't talked about starting this podcast other than

[42:54] Uh, the fact that gardens the galaxy le is shipping and the armor is exactly the same as the ww le armor

[43:00] Um, if you look at next year's titles and we're going to go into it more in my year in prediction

[43:06] But stern isn't really having a title. They don't have like an a theme monster bash is one of the greatest pinball machines of all time

[43:14] It is going to be remade in the same vein as like attack from Mars remake with improved screen topper and the whole game

[43:20] Just going to be nicer

[43:21] I think it's going to be a jug or not and I've been hearing from distributors that they're already sold out of their allotments

[43:27] Now you're saying what do you mean sold out they don't even know the games announced. They don't even what I mean is

[43:31] They have a humongous list of people that have said I want to be on the list for monster bash put me on it

[43:38] and

[43:39] I think monster bash is going to actually sell better than attack from Mars remake. I think it's uh

[43:44] It's it's it's a more exciting game to look at

[43:47] It's got more going on in it and

[43:49] you know, I think monster bash is we're also selling for more money than attack from Mars

[43:54] Remakes were or sorry original attack from Mars. We're not selling for as much as monster bash is where

[44:00] Uh, and what I find funny is like a guy like hilton we're gonna mention him twice

[44:04] So hilton goes on and says like well, it's a born game. It's overrated. You beat it too quickly

[44:09] So here's the thing about monster bash and it's a lot like toad in and theater of magic and all these games where

[44:15] You know, they're there there is an ability to beat the game the game is not as super deep as some of the modern games

[44:21] And I'll say this the majority of people in this hobby the majority of people who love pinball who flip pinball

[44:28] They will never see a wizard mode

[44:30] They will never see the extreme depth of a game. They will never beat most games

[44:35] To them beating a game doesn't mean they have to get rid of it the next day

[44:39] Okay, and so for that reason

[44:41] I think the majority of people actually welcome the fact that when they play monster bash they know what they're doing

[44:49] They know what to shoot for they know how to progress through the game

[44:53] They know how to articulate and communicate that to people who come over their house and want to play a pinball machine

[45:00] Let me show you monster bash. Here's what you do try doing that with game of thrones try doing that with acdc

[45:07] Try doing that

[45:08] You know with star wars you won't be able to even explain to people the way the game is set up with the code

[45:14] So I think enough of like these like super good tournament players that always have to chime in on how they feel some of these great games

[45:24] Lack depth or I have to sell my hobbit now because doesn't have another wizard mode

[45:29] When oh my god

[45:31] You you got through all 45 of keeps modes and you just you need one more or you're gonna sell it

[45:38] It gets old fast once you beat it and come on

[45:42] Does it really?

[45:44] Does it really you beat a game you want to get rid of it? Well then you treat pinball machines like video games

[45:50] So video games cost 60 bucks

[45:52] Should hold on to something because it's a theme you love all right

[45:55] I think monster bash is gonna

[45:57] Fly out the door. I think the ellies are gonna sell out immediately a tp. Oh

[46:02] What's end this with probably the thread that just never ends and that's predator there is no news for pages people

[46:09] We're talking about soda

[46:11] To which the moderators had to go in there and

[46:14] And demand people stop talking about soda pop. Yeah, I mean like Coca Cola like that's what people are now talking about

[46:21] Clearly, this is all ended in one big nothing has happened

[46:25] Kevin's life will always be what it was which is absolutely nothing

[46:29] He will remain in the trailer park life that he always was part of

[46:34] He hoodwinked a bunch of people in the pinball hobby. He stole your money. You're never gonna get the money

[46:40] It's over

[46:42] Mr. Tim five who has a predator

[46:44] Who helped in is always on a mission to try and like ruin this guy's life mr. Tim five has

[46:50] A filed a counter suit against I believe Keith the lawyer

[46:54] For dragon him into this mess with absolutely no case for that

[46:59] So whether or not you think what Tim did was right or wrong in terms of getting a game

[47:04] Look it was out there. It was available. We all who collected this hobby

[47:10] You know will we'll we'll jump at the chance to get some rare unique machine

[47:15] Yes, like predator is a owning one you could you could argue the moral and ethical

[47:22] Stance one would have to justify owning one and I get that

[47:27] But who wouldn't want to hop on a predator who doesn't know of predator? It is part of pinball history for better or worse

[47:34] And you those machines those few prototypes will eventually end up somewhere

[47:39] So is it wrong that Tim bought it from someone and now has it knowing that other people didn't get it

[47:45] I don't really judge the guy that poorly

[47:49] He did what he wanted to do it is what it is, you know

[47:52] Everyone was an idiot everyone was an idiot forgiving Kevin coolic their money a guy building

[47:59] One of the most expensive like Arnold Schwarzenegger probably themes

[48:03] In his mom's basement and you guys all believed it just because he showed up with something

[48:08] And it like you all you all went through this learning with highway with cabin with jpop

[48:13] The stories of those that have failed far exceed those that have succeed it and

[48:19] This thread should probably at this point just be locked

[48:22] I love that Ben heck put up a picture of just a sign that said so to any and he was like moderate it because of that

[48:28] You're never gonna get anything. I've said it from the beginning and and Hilton said said something funny. He goes

[48:35] He's like Tim five

[48:37] I think he suffers from small man status or

[48:40] Complex I would love to see what he looks like in real life to see if he he he matches up against the small man complex

[48:47] I can't help but laugh because maybe hilton doesn't own a mirror or maybe hilton doesn't own a tape measure

[48:54] But he is a tiny man in his own right

[48:57] A hilton it's time to let it go

[48:59] You can win so many people to stay in on predator

[49:02] A lot of people lost their money hilton because of you

[49:06] And we'd be willing to forgive you if you would just shut up and go away about it

[49:10] But you won't you want to continue to be the the hooded crusader who's gonna get everyone their money back

[49:17] At the end of the day, what did you accomplish? No one got their money back

[49:21] Keith the lawyer is the only one that will see some money sure a whole drag Kevin and his poor family through the legal system

[49:28] Sure, their lives will be ruined, but their lives were always ruined

[49:32] These people were always super poor these people were living in homes that cost about the price of a magic girl

[49:38] You so good you got them you stuck it to them you you hurt these people you got them where it hurt you didn't

[49:44] He doesn't care any man that says he's gonna return everyone's money and then decides to keep the money

[49:50] He doesn't care. He has no guilt or remorse. He could have done the right thing

[49:54] He could have given people back you know 30 cents to the dollar and people would have been happy and at least to get something

[50:00] And and accept that his apology and he would have gone away

[50:04] But that's pinball

[50:05] All these things are part of this ridiculous hobby

[50:09] Uh, it's gonna be different in 2018. I'm telling you this

[50:12] This it's it's all gonna balance out all the the years of the boutique failures are finally coming to an end

[50:19] And it's gonna balance out all right

[50:21] Let's end this podcast by reading some of the user mail that I received which isn't much

[50:26] It isn't much you guys really you don't really want to talk to canada, but you get to hear yourself out loud like

[50:31] Like my friend Kim Mitchell send me text messages saying Chris, I love listening to your podcast

[50:36] I love when you give me a shout out. So I'll give you another shout out. Kim Mitchell. I think you're awesome

[50:41] I love your collection. I think you're one of the smartest dudes in pinball and I'm glad that

[50:44] You got out at the top of the price range on on big bang bar. I think I think that rocks

[50:49] So Kim Mitchell everyone happy holidays and he gets that because he reaches out to me

[50:53] See that's the power. He's connected. He's in the little canada inner circle

[50:58] Um, all right. Let me see. I got an email from

[51:02] John

[51:04] So John Robison said hey, I followed in your footsteps and bought

[51:10] The Batman 66 super Ellie that was on pinside on the 18th

[51:15] I really like the super Ellie art package the seller said that he had four serious inquiries

[51:22] Seems like Batman 66 Ellie super Ellie is the flavor of the month right now

[51:27] He knew of three other Batman super Ellie is that had sold within the week all around the 15,500 dollar mark

[51:34] I'm super happy with my purchase. I ended up a trade of my attack from Mars Ellie and cash for Batman

[51:42] And it was dry and it was driving distance. Okay. I hope you're enjoying Batman 2

[51:47] as always I like hearing your take on the hobby thanks for the listening entertainment just don't burn out like Nate

[51:55] Um, and he said that there's a Batman Ellie for sale for 11,500 in the San Francisco Bay area

[52:02] So John Robison thank you John for listening to the show

[52:06] Uh, I think you are going to be nothing but happy with your Batman 66 super Ellie

[52:11] I hope you have no no board issues

[52:14] Um, if I could give you some advice. I would do the following

[52:17] I would go get all of the amazing mods

[52:20] From the mod couple from mezzle mods

[52:24] And dress this game up. It really needs the atomic pile mod everything that's on that turntable

[52:29] Get everything offered by the mod couple. It's like yellow bird is his name on pinside by everything

[52:36] It makes it transforms the game

[52:39] And you have an SLE so the other things I would add to an SLE I would add the

[52:45] The the the hinges that say Batman on it with the red piping for the LEDs that looks really nice

[52:51] I would try and find the Eagle Moss helicopter to replace the crappy helicopter that stern gives you the Eagle

[52:59] Moss one is 10 times as detailed. Uh, you're gonna want to obviously get the new back cave on the on the on the

[53:06] Rotisserie mech

[53:08] From from from the mod couple you can even replace that bat mobile with a nicer one and from a different hot wheels version

[53:14] Um, what else? I mean, I mean get the play field protector

[53:19] I know like there's a lot of conversation going back and forth on play field protectors

[53:24] Put the play field protector on your machine

[53:27] You might not want to now because it sounds like yours is used and might already have some normal wear and tear

[53:32] But I just think it gives me such peace of mind that every time I play it there's never gonna be a dimple

[53:37] There's never gonna be like any chip clear coat

[53:41] I never have to worry about an insert taking an air ball

[53:43] So uh, that's my advice, but enjoy the game. It is a special game Batman 66 super early

[53:49] And it looks phenomenal. It really does. I mean, I'm looking at right now. I would play it right now if I could

[53:54] But absolutely absolutely enjoy your game John and have a great

[53:58] Happy holidays and healthy new year to you John

[54:02] Uh, I got an email from axle axle bendix

[54:06] Axel thank you. Maybe I should have read everyone's full name um

[54:09] He said hi Chris just finished listening to the head-to-head pinball podcast and wanted to drop you a line to wish you a

[54:14] Merry Christmas

[54:16] I've got back into pinball in the last year after dropping into a competition that Martin used to run in Melbourne

[54:23] Unfortunately, I've recopped the pinball bug and purchased four more machines this year

[54:29] Since I got back into pinball

[54:31] I've been listening to your podcast and enjoyed it

[54:33] I don't always agree with what you say, but I appreciate that you are saying it

[54:38] I think there are just too many shanky manufacturers who think it's okay to treat their customers and potential customers with such contempt

[54:47] I'm really glad you are over the whole magic girl saga and now have a pin that you are enjoying playing

[54:53] Minus the node board um, let's be honest having fun is the only reason for being in this hobby

[54:58] Anyways, just wanted to drop you a line of support and wish you and your fiance a merry Christmas

[55:05] Or as you say in the US happy holidays all the best axle axle. Thank you so much

[55:10] You know how they say it in Ireland. It's the weirdest thing. They say happy Christmas

[55:15] You're ever if you're ever at a table with a bunch of Irish people like I was yesterday

[55:18] Like happy Christmas. Oh now it is so it will be so where they're there we are happy Christmas

[55:24] I'm like, well, what do you say for happy new years like happy new years? What do you say for birthday happy birthday?

[55:28] So it's just happy everything pretty much pretty much happy Christmas

[55:32] But axle. Thank you. I appreciate it. I don't want people to always agree with me. I don't think people should I think people

[55:39] Listen to this show

[55:40] Because I say things that at least have a well thought out point of view on the topic

[55:45] And I do think at the end of the day. I'm looking out for all of you

[55:49] I am I'm not here to

[55:51] To show for any manufacturer as much as I'll gloat about how much I love Batman

[55:55] I'm gonna go on the next episode and say a node board failing after two weeks is a freaking joke and stern should be ashamed of themselves

[56:03] And I think I keep it honest and fair and balanced on this show and yes, there are times when I

[56:09] Will be more

[56:11] angry or single out or pick on companies like highway and Dutch and this but do those companies not deserve to be

[56:19] To be held to the fire at this point

[56:22] people it's about to be

[56:25] 2018 and those machines haven't shipped to people who paid in full. I will not give these companies a break

[56:33] I they do not deserve it. They do not deserve it. All right. Well, Axel Merry Christmas to you and your family

[56:38] I'm glad you're back in the game

[56:40] You Australians are a crazy bunch you really are you have you have to spend so much money on games and I don't know

[56:46] I feel like you guys all are like pretty rich or something because you've all got them all right

[56:50] So I got an email from John Morgan John. Thank you for listening. He said Chris

[56:54] I doubt you remember me, but again, I wanted to thank you for all you do on your podcast

[56:59] I really enjoy your insightfulness and passion for pinball have a great next year hope to run into you at the Texas pinball show

[57:07] I have to mention this ad that was just posted on pinside classified

[57:12] We'll be interesting if someone buys these two machines and so the ad that John posted

[57:17] Was scared stiff and a vire and the party monsters

[57:21] for 35,000 dollars for both and these were the machines that

[57:26] A vire herself Cassandra Peterson has in storage since they've been new

[57:32] So this is some lucky person's chance to have new new new a vire classic pinball game

[57:37] Okay, so what's crazy about this and I this

[57:41] these two games have been

[57:44] for sale for a long time John and I've seen this and

[57:49] You know, I've I think the only way these games would sell is if Cassandra brought them in box

[57:55] To a pinball show like tpf and did a seminar and said look

[58:01] We're gonna sell these games and half of the proceeds are gonna go to charity or something like that

[58:06] There's no way each of these games in their respective

[58:10] Self are worth like 17,500 dollars. They're

[58:14] Why you know because the new inbox of these games at most might be worth what like 10 grand

[58:20] But the problem is this is once you open the box. I've said this new inbox buying is

[58:26] Is not you should never pay it and flayed it amount because once you open of the box

[58:29] It's no longer new in box you now just have a a a nice mint new version of the game

[58:34] And then every time you play the game

[58:36] It's just a used game and then a year from now you just have a game that is in nice condition

[58:42] So it's absolutely a name to think that this story of who had these games is gonna add that kind of value

[58:51] Now if she had he if she had two games that were personalized in some other way right if if her two games had like a different art

[58:59] Package or like Elvira edition that they made especially for her

[59:03] Then I could see this being that kind of sale

[59:06] But that's not the case what she has in boxes with every other arcade and collector got when these games shipped

[59:13] Cool concept, but not really gonna be worth anywhere close to that

[59:18] No one's gonna buy it and especially with the remake fear out there

[59:22] These games are always in in jeopardy of being remade all right

[59:26] Gonna read a couple more than I gotta go get ready. We're going to a friend's place for a holiday lunch

[59:31] All right Jeff at this week in pinball

[59:35] Well, he talked to me about how he's been talking to

[59:38] Robert at deep route and

[59:41] I don't want to read this because we Jeff and I keep our conversations, you know pretty pretty secret

[59:47] Um, you know, I've been curious if Robert from deep route is gonna come back and actually talk and we'll see what they deliver in 2018

[59:52] But I don't want to I don't want to even talk about them

[59:55] um

[59:57] I got an email from Molly at consent Molly. Thank you for listening to the show

[01:00:01] I you know like Molly is is a very opinionated and strong point of view woman

[01:00:07] I hope she comes on the show. I'd love to talk to her about her views on pinball

[01:00:12] You know, I know she she is

[01:00:14] Seen within the hobby as being someone with a strong opinion and guess who else is seen that way? I am

[01:00:19] So I'm cool if Molly's cool to have her come on the show and talk pinball

[01:00:23] I think it'd be great. So Molly if you're listening let's let's do it sometime in in 2018

[01:00:28] Uh, I got an email from

[01:00:31] Duh-du-du-du-du-du Adam Schwartz 15 minutes ago he said he can aid it first off. I love your show

[01:00:36] I'm addicted keep up the great work. Did you see this thread on pinside? It's about women in pinball

[01:00:40] I'm curious on your thoughts about the lack of female pinball collectors

[01:00:44] I know it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem for the manufacturers

[01:00:47] But seems like some themes that cross genders could bring women to the hobby

[01:00:52] Would love to get your always insightful perspective. So his question is why don't I think there's more pinball collectors in the hobby

[01:00:58] And my answer is pretty simple is I think women are really much smarter than men

[01:01:04] I have to say women make smarter decisions

[01:01:07] Than men for the most part

[01:01:09] You could argue some women buy bags and choose that plummet in value. And yes, that is true

[01:01:14] No, I mean, I'm not I'm being I'm I'm being

[01:01:18] um, this ceas is here when I say women are smarter than men

[01:01:21] I think most women if I'm gonna be honest are not pinball collectors

[01:01:26] Is I don't think most young women when they were young when they were this when they were

[01:01:31] When think about this you're a man think about the age at which you went to our Cades and played pinball machines and fell in love with pinball

[01:01:40] Was your sister with you playing that Adam's family or trying to really master street fighter?

[01:01:47] We're trying to get up over the barrels and Donkey Kong

[01:01:51] You know for the most part arcade culture was more male dominated. That's not being sexist

[01:01:56] There are women who love gaming not as much as men did back in the day

[01:02:02] Okay, so you have a whole generation of young boys who grew up in our Cades

[01:02:08] becoming gaming efficient not as those young boys grew up

[01:02:12] Now have good jobs. Hopefully have money to burn

[01:02:17] And now are realizing that the things they loved as a kid the things they have nostalgia for

[01:02:23] Can be purchased and put in their homes and so that's why they collect

[01:02:28] They want those things that they enjoyed when they were a young boy

[01:02:32] If you didn't have that experience as a young girl in our Cade then there's there's this really like

[01:02:37] Not a desire probably for you if you had $10,000 to go buy a pinball machine

[01:02:45] And so for that reason that reason alone I think you're never going to see a lot of female collectors now

[01:02:51] I don't think you know like collecting pinball machines is is even the extreme side of the hobby right

[01:02:56] So sometimes you know pinside will have you thinking that the majority of people who enjoy pinball collect pinball

[01:03:03] And that is anything but the case

[01:03:05] There are there are millions people out there who who interact with pinball that enjoy it

[01:03:11] Maybe maybe not millions but maybe a million maybe a few hundred thousand

[01:03:14] But I'll say this percentage wise far more people enjoy playing pinball than owning pinball machines

[01:03:22] And there's always it's always hard to understand that because you really

[01:03:27] You know you go into the forums and it's primarily collectors on pinside

[01:03:32] So I think more and more women enjoy playing pinball

[01:03:35] But again, I just don't think the money would ever want to go into a machine

[01:03:39] And and book it's in life in life we all collect different things

[01:03:44] I don't know many women that collect

[01:03:47] Like toys or action figures or video games or pinball machines or this or that

[01:03:53] You know if someone has a collection of some if I know women who have collections of

[01:03:59] Fashion items of bags of shoes and you know

[01:04:03] God bless everybody like buy what you want, you know, you know

[01:04:06] You know someone a woman might have a beanie baby collection or might have

[01:04:11] You know, I know I friend hit me up because I'm selling a work of artwork

[01:04:14] So like my girlfriend collects everything with unicorns on it. I'm like this cool like

[01:04:18] Many women can be into different things and I don't think they're um

[01:04:22] I think that's what makes the world go round

[01:04:24] I think everyone has their own passions and decides where they spend their money

[01:04:28] But I do think if you look at this hobby if you go to shows

[01:04:32] predominantly

[01:04:34] Caucasian male

[01:04:36] Between the ages of 40 and like 65 that are the are the primary

[01:04:44] Collectors in this hobby if you fall outside of that

[01:04:48] I think you are going to be very very slim pickings in terms of people of other

[01:04:53] genders and ethnicities and backgrounds who are really into this hobby it is very sort of insulated

[01:05:00] fanbase all right

[01:05:02] That is the last of my emails

[01:05:04] Um, I don't know if I'll do another podcast before Christmas if I do not everybody

[01:05:09] Have a very merry Christmas have a very happy holidays next week

[01:05:13] I'm hoping to get some guests on the show to do our year in review um and we'll have a good sort of go at it

[01:05:19] And just our predictions of what we think is going to happen

[01:05:22] We did some of it on head to head pinball. We'll do it on this show

[01:05:25] I'm gonna go I'm gonna go down the trippy awards

[01:05:28] And say what I think will win in each of those categories if again if you want to say you love my show

[01:05:34] Please go vote for me in the trippy awards

[01:05:36] Uh, so I can come in like eighth place instead of ninth. I appreciate it

[01:05:41] Everyone take care of yourselves enjoy your time and your time off with friends and family

[01:05:46] I love that you guys love pinball and that you tune in on a weekly basis. I'll talk to you real soon

[01:05:57] Oh, be all right
