[00:00] Welcome to episode 121 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:29] It's a sunny day here in New York City.

[00:31] Bubb is got his bone and Canada's wearing a neck brace because I pinched a nerve,

[00:36] lift and weights.

[00:37] But I'm so dedicated to getting you guys the pinball news of the week that I'm still

[00:42] going to do this podcast.

[00:44] I have to start out on this episode with Kathy Coolick, Kevin Coolick's mother.

[00:51] Since it's Mother's Day this weekend, don't forget to send your mother flowers or to go

[00:56] take her out for brunch guys.

[00:58] Because it's Mother's Day, we have to talk about predator and skit bee and what's going

[01:02] on with the court systems.

[01:03] Now, I haven't reported that frequently.

[01:07] There's a lot of different audio recordings that have been popping up, but this one really

[01:11] was a juicy one.

[01:12] I want to play you guys a few clips from it and we'll discuss after we hear some of those

[01:18] clips.

[01:19] So let's just roll the tape.

[01:20] Even if it's my last breath, I want you to know the truth.

[01:24] Your honor.

[01:25] I'm alone.

[01:26] That's what I am.

[01:27] That's what I am.

[01:28] I'm not, I'm not a profile, I'm a mom.

[01:32] Sure.

[01:33] And I've always been, now I'm a grandma.

[01:35] I don't ever want him to accuse me of being anything less than a jacket.

[01:40] And I don't want to ever have to find out anything on the internet again.

[01:46] And I would also ask the judge right now, is this, are you going to allow this to be

[01:52] recorded and put on the internet?

[01:55] Now, all I can do is tell you that we record this and then it's available to the public.

[02:02] That's part of having a public course.

[02:09] What happens after that, I really don't know.

[02:11] I can't throw much.

[02:13] I don't like my voice being publicized for all these reasons.

[02:19] Okay.

[02:20] It's against my rights, my civil rights.

[02:23] It's against my rights.

[02:24] I have rights, privacy.

[02:25] I know it's open court, but I still don't like it.

[02:30] Well, you don't get to like it, Kathy.

[02:32] What people also don't like is giving money to your son, Kevin Kool-Aik, and then not

[02:37] getting their predator pinball machine.

[02:39] What people don't like is that when Kevin realized that the gig was up and that he didn't

[02:45] have a license and that he had a refund people's money, what people didn't like is that he

[02:49] kept the money.

[02:50] And he bought you things, Kathy Kool-Aik.

[02:52] This family, seriously, when you look at the skitbee company, she was involved in everything.

[02:59] She was involved in all aspects of skitbee pinball and knew everything that was going down with

[03:04] predator when it went down.

[03:06] And it is sad and it's also pathetic.

[03:10] I really find it pathetic when people make themselves the victim.

[03:15] When they are the ones who lost people's money, they are the ones who lied, they are the

[03:20] ones who misled people.

[03:22] And I think what's really devastating about the skitbee thing, because I do find it a

[03:26] little bit different than like J-Pop's lies and J-Pop getting himself in the red and

[03:31] not being able to get out of it.

[03:33] I understand how John went off the deep end because he focused so much on the artwork

[03:38] and all the fun stuff.

[03:40] He didn't engineer the games or he didn't have the ability to make these games.

[03:45] He really did it.

[03:47] But John never reached a point where he had money to give back to people and he didn't.

[03:54] Kevin reached a point where he clearly had over half a million dollars of people's money.

[04:00] Instead of refunding it, he decided to pay some of his friends who were vendors.

[04:06] He decided to buy his mom in RV.

[04:08] He decided to put money in other people's bank accounts.

[04:11] His wife decided to go buy expensive cameras and other things and buy laptops for his kids

[04:16] for Christmas and all these different things.

[04:18] We saw him going to arcade shows and buying other coin-op devices with people's money.

[04:24] The guy is a scumbag.

[04:27] His mom should be ashamed.

[04:29] It's just a matter of time.

[04:30] It's just a matter of time before the judge slams the book on these guys.

[04:34] We hope it comes soon because the judge seems to be pretty lenient.

[04:38] God man, listening to all these different audio tapes too, the wheels of justice, how

[04:45] slowly they do turn, how slowly they do turn.

[04:49] That's our little Mother's Day update on Kevin Koolik.

[04:53] Let's switch gears to the big Lebowski.

[04:55] I got a bunch of people who emailed me saying, what's the Lebowski news?

[04:58] What's the Lebowski news?

[04:59] Because everyone is anxiously waiting some positive news on the big Lebowski whether or

[05:04] not a Dutch pinball has aimed to deal with aRA, the manufacturer and company to get people

[05:10] their games.

[05:11] I want to read.

[05:12] Just the latest update, it seems bearing the app have communicated to people.

[05:16] They wrote, we received a lot of feedback about our frequent updates.

[05:21] It is great to hear that you appreciate the updates even if there's no spectacular

[05:25] news.

[05:26] We will continue to do this.

[05:28] We talked again with aRA but this time also with NIVOGE.

[05:34] I think I'm pronouncing that right.

[05:35] As you might know, aRA is part of the NIVOGE group that is led by a board of three people.

[05:41] Two members of this board are now the intern management of aRA.

[05:45] We also hired a business consultant to advise us in the process.

[05:49] He advised us not to share any details of the negotiations.

[05:53] So right now there's no good news and no bad news.

[05:56] But things look positive that you will get your Lebowski.

[05:59] We will send out another update next week.

[06:02] Alright, so that's the update.

[06:04] The update is they're talking, I keep hearing the talks are going well, the talks are positive.

[06:11] You still don't have your Lebowski.

[06:13] So that's the thing.

[06:14] It's just like how many months are you willing to wait?

[06:18] How many years are you willing to wait for these guys to iron stuff out?

[06:23] Now production is not happening though.

[06:25] So we're still at this point where there's 40 games sitting in boxes.

[06:29] So if you're one of those people who you know your game is built, then I could see you

[06:35] holding out.

[06:36] But I know people who are number 147 on the list to get a big Lebowski.

[06:41] And the way these guys are looking at it is maybe by the end of the year they might get

[06:47] their pinball machine with the way this thing is dragging on and they don't have any idea

[06:53] of when production will actually start up again.

[06:56] Is it that simple that they just flip a switch and all of a sudden they're making tons

[07:00] of games a month or is it going to drag on and is production going to have to ramp

[07:05] up again which could take a while.

[07:07] So I think the whole situation sucks to be honest.

[07:10] I think Dutch pinball, even if they get the Lebowski's out, I think Dutch pinball is

[07:15] going to struggle to get people to feel confident about their company again.

[07:19] I don't think anyone's going to buy BOP 2.0, 3.0 whatever they're calling it.

[07:24] I don't think that's going to work.

[07:26] I think the $12,500 price point on that was arbitrary and ridiculous.

[07:31] It seemed like a joke making fun of the collector's edition price for dialed in but it wasn't

[07:38] a joke.

[07:39] It was real which made it even more scary that they thought that that was a good business

[07:43] idea.

[07:44] And I think this company is going to really learn a lesson that when you lie people are

[07:50] not really going to forgive.

[07:52] They're not going to forgive until you truly, truly earn that forgiveness.

[07:58] But I don't think Dutch so far has earned the forgiveness of people after what they did.

[08:03] I really don't.

[08:04] And I know Barry and I really want to make this thing work but I think they've got a long

[08:10] ways to go.

[08:12] I think they've got a long ways to go.

[08:13] And I'll say this, my final point is this.

[08:16] The fact that they thought that the BOP 3.0 was a good idea, the fact that they even came,

[08:22] they came to Texas to show that knowing what was going on with Lebowski.

[08:27] I don't know.

[08:28] Part of me just feels like we saw enough of their character and enough of what they think

[08:34] is a good business move to really not have any confidence in what these guys are doing

[08:41] moving forward.

[08:42] I mean I just don't understand.

[08:44] And then the funny part too is they show that damn BOP 3.0 and the prototype of it is

[08:50] locked at ARA.

[08:51] They can't even work on it.

[08:52] That's the whole thing.

[08:53] Just made me be like these guys.

[08:56] These guys are not really on top of it.

[08:58] And I look, I hope they can turn the corner.

[09:00] I hope they get this ARA deal inked out.

[09:03] I hope they rethink BOP 3.0 and actually make a legitimate second title because I do

[09:08] like Lebowski.

[09:09] I played it at Sunshine and I do like the pin.

[09:12] Sure it has some quality issues here and there.

[09:15] I felt like the left ramp was kind of cheap the way it was flopping around when I hit

[09:18] it.

[09:19] But the game is fun.

[09:23] It's a really quirky unique theme.

[09:24] I think it's a great theme for pinball.

[09:26] I think it has some amazing toys in it.

[09:28] And I would love to see Dutch pinball.

[09:32] Move on to game 2 and get game 1 out.

[09:34] But I just don't think that's going to happen for a while.

[09:38] And I hope I'm wrong.

[09:39] I do hope I'm wrong.

[09:40] All right.

[09:41] Speaking of getting games out, a little update to is on Alien is.

[09:46] So we're hearing now that Alien has new mechs that are being put into the games that are

[09:53] currently going out this week.

[09:55] They've redesigned the Xenomorph head and the boards that go with it so that that toy

[10:02] will no longer be an issue.

[10:03] So it seems like that was what was holding up Aliens from going out the doors.

[10:08] So look, I don't know how many total Aliens have gone out.

[10:11] I do know that we're seeing more people saying mine's going out.

[10:15] I spoke to Andrew and team and I should get my game soon.

[10:19] So here's what I'm excited about.

[10:21] I'm excited to see a review of this game with all parts functioning.

[10:25] All right.

[10:26] Because the main mech has not really functioned in a lot of the videos we've seen.

[10:30] It hasn't worked at different shows that that I've gone to where the game has been there.

[10:35] It wasn't working in Allentown.

[10:38] So I'm excited to see the totality of Alien.

[10:41] I still don't think they're going to get Alien, Aliens out the door in significant numbers

[10:46] in June and July.

[10:48] I don't think that's going to happen.

[10:50] I think if we believe what people are saying that they didn't even order the parts for

[10:55] the lighted, fiber optic ramps and those parts are going to take at least two months to

[11:01] get in, then you're not looking at your game in June and July.

[11:04] So we'll see what happens.

[11:06] But look, I will call this as I see it and I think Aliens going out the door is good

[11:11] news for highway.

[11:12] I think it's long overdue that we get more games out the door.

[11:16] But as someone said, is it 16 games?

[11:19] It needs to be 60 a month.

[11:21] It can't be 16.

[11:22] So it's good news that they're going out.

[11:25] I think they have a long ways to go.

[11:27] But I do think if they don't get Aliens out in June and July and Ali people start asking

[11:33] for refunds, I think that could be what sings the ship.

[11:38] I really do.

[11:39] I think they need to get Ali people their games when they were promised.

[11:45] But then again, Ali people, I think they're gluttoning for punishment.

[11:49] I think they'll stay in no matter what.

[11:51] Even if you show them Star Wars and even if you miss their date again, these people have

[11:57] waited so long.

[11:58] I don't even think people look at these things in months anymore.

[12:01] It's just like, well, maybe this year, maybe this year.

[12:04] All right.

[12:05] So we wish these guys more luck in the future.

[12:09] I hope they get the games out.

[12:10] That's all I'm going to say.

[12:11] If they miss those June, July dates, of course, we will cover it on this podcast.

[12:16] All right.

[12:17] Bubba has just decided that he's going to lie next to me and pant like crazy.

[12:21] Bubba, come on.

[12:22] Get your breath, buddy.

[12:23] Get your breath.

[12:24] All right.

[12:25] Something else I want to talk about is a question I see a lot on Pinside, which is, should

[12:30] I buy Ghostbusters Premium or Aerosmith Premium?

[12:33] Which one should I get?

[12:36] It's a tough decision.

[12:37] It's a tough decision.

[12:38] Tough games are available, new in box.

[12:41] Distributors have both games ready to go for people.

[12:45] And I have to say, I have to say, if I were to pick one.

[12:47] And I played both at Sunshine for a really long time the other day.

[12:52] And I went back and forth between Aerosmith and Ghostbusters because I tried to put myself

[12:55] in the mindset of someone who's trying to make this tough decision.

[13:00] And it's hard.

[13:01] It's hard.

[13:02] I think if we go by theme, I think Ghostbusters definitely has the better theme of the two

[13:06] machines.

[13:08] If we go by artwork, I mean, I think it's a coin toss.

[13:10] I really do.

[13:11] I think Donnie crushed it on Aerosmith.

[13:14] I love Zombie Yeti's artwork on Ghostbusters as well.

[13:18] So I think it's just a coin toss there.

[13:21] If we go in terms of display though, I mean Aerosmith has the LCD.

[13:26] I mean, it blows away the red dots on Ghostbusters DMD.

[13:29] So I think that's one for Aerosmith.

[13:32] When it comes to shots, I also think Aerosmith is a much more fun game to shoot than Ghostbusters.

[13:38] I really do.

[13:39] I think my problem with Ghostbusters, and as I look at people's photos of the machine

[13:43] too, I just think it wasn't designed that well.

[13:49] And what I mean by that is this.

[13:51] I think the game has so many brick shots.

[13:54] The shots are too tight.

[13:55] And I think there's too many shots there that make everything brick, make everything air

[14:01] ball, and make the game so frustrating to play.

[14:05] And I'm not even talking about the huge gap with the flippers, the desire for the ball,

[14:13] the constantly jump the out lanes.

[14:15] And when I look down and see people's machines and they have all these additional plastics

[14:19] everywhere trying to make the game more fun and less brutal, that to me signifies this

[14:28] game was poorly designed.

[14:29] You shouldn't have to go around a pinball machine and put plastics everywhere to try and

[14:35] keep the ball in play properly.

[14:38] That's just an Aerosmith, on the other hand, to me plays like silky smooth compared to

[14:42] Ghostbusters.

[14:44] The major toy in Aerosmith, the toy box, is so much cooler than the major toy in Ghostbusters.

[14:51] The slimer mechanism, I don't know, I've always felt it feels a little bit cheesy.

[14:58] When slimer drags his ass, to me that's the ultimate symbol of this thing which is poorly

[15:02] designed.

[15:03] When his ass drags over the different, like the pop bumper area and why did nobody look

[15:10] at that and say, what the f is this?

[15:13] Trudeau, this looks terrible.

[15:14] You've got to fix this.

[15:17] No, they still ship out and that slimer the way it hits everything when it moves around.

[15:23] To me, it's just the exact reason why I think Ghostbusters is poorly designed and I think

[15:28] Aerosmith is better designed.

[15:30] So look, if you put theme aside.

[15:33] I think Aerosmith wins in every other category and is the better pen.

[15:37] I really do.

[15:38] I think people don't want to like Aerosmith because they want it to love Ghostbusters so

[15:43] damn much.

[15:46] But if I had to play a pen and I'm putting my money in, I would much rather play Aerosmith.

[15:52] That's it.

[15:53] That's my pick.

[15:54] I think Aerosmith Premium is a superior pen to Ghostbusters Premium and I think Aerosmith

[16:00] is going to go down as one of the best turns in a long time.

[16:03] I really do.

[16:04] I wouldn't be surprised if people even think Aerosmith is better than Star Wars.

[16:09] It's going to get compared to a lot.

[16:11] I think it's better than Batman.

[16:13] I think I'm just going on a list of recent turns.

[16:16] I think it's better than Game of Thrones.

[16:18] I think it is one of Stern's best pens in a long time.

[16:23] I really do.

[16:24] All right.

[16:25] So my vote is for Aerosmith.

[16:27] Can you tell?

[16:28] It's not just because I talk to Donnie.

[16:31] Because I do think it is better pen.

[16:34] All right.

[16:35] So there's a fun thread on pen side and the thread is, who is your favorite pen cider?

[16:40] So they're just asking people to write in who their favorite pen cider is.

[16:45] And I have to say, a few people said Canada.

[16:47] It got a punch.

[16:49] It was received with misreaction.

[16:51] So I want to thank those people who consider Canada to be their favorite pen cider.

[16:55] Even though Canada hasn't been on pen side in a really, really long time, it's been over

[16:59] a year.

[17:00] I get a lot of mail to you from people who are just basically like, I don't know why you're

[17:05] still banned from pen side.

[17:07] Speaking of mail, let me read out and do a couple shout outs to some of my listeners who

[17:11] sent me emails.

[17:13] I want to say thank you to Oliver.

[17:15] So Oliver C wrote me.

[17:17] You did a fairly good job of drawing people's attention to various things that Andrew has

[17:20] promised and committed to in the past.

[17:23] One thing you missed were some of his pronastications, pronastications at Expo 2013.

[17:29] He claimed in his seminar that they'd start initial production weeks later and ramped

[17:35] to a cadence of 12 to 14,000 machines per year in 2014.

[17:41] You can listen to it in full.

[17:43] It's posted on the Pimball News Expo 13 report.

[17:47] That's an astonishing statement.

[17:48] He was effectively claiming that they would produce two times the entire industry in 2013,

[17:54] the following year, just on their own.

[17:58] Well Oliver, thank you for writing in.

[18:00] I must have missed that.

[18:01] I tried to grab as many sound bites of Andrew highway's promises over the years for that

[18:06] alien day podcast.

[18:08] But look, I think Andrew speaks before really checking with the people back in the factory

[18:14] if this is even possible.

[18:16] I think it's not just Andrew who does it.

[18:19] I think a lot of these Pimball people out there, they want to get credit for their intentions

[18:25] and they want to get credit for what they say, not what they do.

[18:28] They get away with it.

[18:30] The reason why they get away with it is because there are so many people in this hobby that

[18:35] will just take people by their word.

[18:39] They don't care what the company does.

[18:42] You've got these people and it's weird.

[18:43] People just become fans of a manufacturer and no matter what that manufacturer does,

[18:50] the people remain loyal to them.

[18:53] Even if the actions of those manufacturers are suspect, even if the actions are lies,

[19:00] even if the actions are mistruths, even if the actions are misdeadlines, people continue

[19:06] to be supportive.

[19:07] It's like a religion.

[19:10] People decide, my religious belief is going to be highway Pimball.

[19:13] No matter what highway Pimball does, I will still believe in them.

[19:17] I will still have faith in them.

[19:18] I will still support them even if they are doing things that aren't right.

[19:23] We see people like that.

[19:25] Wicker man is like that.

[19:26] Like Hilton is like that.

[19:28] There's a few other alien fanboys out there that will continually ignore and excuse the

[19:36] behaviors that shouldn't be excused and ignored.

[19:40] No one can change their minds.

[19:43] I thought I did a pretty good job of presenting just the facts and using Andrew's own words

[19:49] to present what he said highway Pimball would be capable of.

[19:54] I don't know how you can hear all that stuff and still blindly support the company, but

[19:59] that's just Pimball hobbyist.

[20:01] The same is true with Jersey Jack supporters.

[20:04] The same is true with Stern supporters.

[20:07] A lot of these people will just keep making excuses for these companies.

[20:12] I tend to look at the facts.

[20:15] I think you'll be happier if instead of blindly supporting companies, just look at the facts

[20:21] of what they do and make up your mind based upon their actions and not their words.

[20:26] I think you'll find yourself in a much better place and your money will actually be in

[20:29] a much better place if you follow that approach.

[20:32] I want to thank Warren for writing it to the show.

[20:36] He says, hey, Kay, enjoy the dirty, donny interview.

[20:41] Did you mention that ACDC may be rerun with new art?

[20:44] That would be awesome.

[20:45] I was so pumped when the title was originally announced as I had been suggesting it as a

[20:49] theme for years.

[20:51] I was so close to buying one, but when art was finally revealed, I just couldn't do it.

[20:56] I even had permission from my wife and was ready to sell all my games to finance it.

[21:02] So is dirty, donny going to be doing the artwork for the new ACDC run?

[21:07] Well, let's look Warren, thank you for the note.

[21:11] Thank you for listening to the podcast.

[21:13] Do I think dirty donny is doing art on a new ACDC game?

[21:17] I don't think so.

[21:18] I really don't.

[21:19] I don't think he would be pulled in to do that.

[21:23] I also don't think they'd have double donny happening.

[21:27] Donny on AeroSmith, Donny on ACDC.

[21:30] I also don't even know for sure that ACDC vault is going to happen.

[21:36] And we're going to talk a little bit about Lord the Rings, Vault Edition, rumors, and

[21:40] but at the end of the day, Stern does a really good job of misleading everybody.

[21:45] And all they have to do is they can leak out information to certain distributors and

[21:51] then distributors talk to customers and then customers talk to each other and then

[21:55] someone tells Kaneda something, right?

[21:57] That's how all this stuff starts.

[21:59] All the leaks happen from the distributors.

[22:02] And so when a distributor says, I hear ACDC might be next, we tend to believe distributors

[22:09] for some reason.

[22:10] And I think Stern can easily mislead people by leaking information to keep people off

[22:17] like the actual path.

[22:20] And we fall for it time and time again, right?

[22:22] How often have we been right on vault editions and remakes and this and that?

[22:28] I think people are, we heard about Batman, we heard about Spider-Man, but ACDC, another

[22:35] edition of it.

[22:37] I don't really, you know, I think it'll sell.

[22:40] I don't think people care too much because there's so many ACDCs floating around.

[22:45] But Warren, if it gets remade, I don't expect Dirty Donny to do the art.

[22:48] I think it'll be a different art package.

[22:51] If Donny does do the art, forget it.

[22:53] It'll be the most in demand one because if there's one weak thing with ACDC, it's

[22:58] the terrible art package in that game.

[23:01] All right.

[23:02] I want to thank Douglas Roberts for writing in.

[23:06] He says, I think if Stern integrated some RGB LEDs into their speaker panels, kind of

[23:11] like what Chicago gaming is doing with the tech from our remake, it would look pretty

[23:16] sweet and fill in that large area of blank space better.

[23:20] They could even integrate them with gameplay and make them change colors depending on what's

[23:24] going on in the game.

[23:26] Thanks and keep up the great work.

[23:28] Your show is the only pinball podcast that doesn't put me to sleep, Doug.

[23:32] Well, Doug, thank you for listening to the podcast.

[23:35] I'm glad it doesn't put you to sleep.

[23:38] I try hard to make this as entertaining into the point as I can with regards to the speaker

[23:43] panel area.

[23:44] Do I think a light it speaker panel area would be better than what Stern is currently giving

[23:50] us?

[23:51] Yeah, maybe.

[23:52] Maybe.

[23:53] It's such a big area.

[23:54] I don't know if lights will make it better.

[23:59] I kind of wish there was more artwork there.

[24:03] It's just these two big black monoliths next to the LCD.

[24:09] Here's the thing.

[24:11] I don't hate it, but I don't love it.

[24:14] You know what I'm saying?

[24:15] I'm just indifferent by it.

[24:18] But it's such an important part of the real estate on a machine that I just wish Stern

[24:24] would think a little bit more creatively about how to make that area look better.

[24:29] But I'll say this, we're complaining about a Stern LCD speaker grill.

[24:34] Right?

[24:35] I mean, Stern is the only real pinball player in town.

[24:40] They constantly listen to our feedback and they're giving us exactly what we've asked

[24:45] for.

[24:47] Their games have better sound.

[24:48] They have better visuals.

[24:49] They have better artwork now than they ever did before.

[24:52] I think, look, we're going to nitpick everything that goes on with Stern pinball machines simply

[24:58] because Stern pinball machines are really the only pinball machines in town.

[25:02] So that's why they get criticized and nitpicks so much.

[25:05] But look, it's not a big deal.

[25:07] And I'm waiting to see what the mod community does do with that speaker panel area because

[25:12] I think there's potential to make it better.

[25:17] All right.

[25:18] What else?

[25:19] This thread just pops up every once in a while and it's do we think Lord of the Rings will

[25:23] have a vault edition.

[25:26] And you know, look, here's the thing with vault editions and I want to read crazy levies

[25:31] response to this because I want you to hear what he says and then I want to discuss this

[25:36] whole situation.

[25:37] All right.

[25:38] So he writes, if you look at it, Stern has only done one vault game, Iron Man twice, which

[25:46] is generally agreed to be the most stripped down cheapest game they've ever made.

[25:51] Spider Man doesn't count its reskinned and costs $1,500 more.

[25:56] Vault editions are going to be few and far between as has been stated a million times.

[26:02] Lord of the Rings doesn't really make any sense.

[26:04] They'd have to charge $8,000 to make it worth their while and home use only versions

[26:09] cost much less.

[26:12] The vault discussion gets annoying because it's hard to understand why people can't

[26:16] grasp the reality of the situation.

[26:19] Stern was very clever and their re-release of Iron Man.

[26:22] They pumped out a cheap game people wanted and at the same time made a big deal about this

[26:27] vault edition and how we could look forward to more releases from the vault.

[26:32] In three years, it hasn't happened again yet any seeds of doubt they can plant into the

[26:37] minds of people who might otherwise buy a new Stern instead of a new one is just a bonus.

[26:43] And no doubt they've caused buyers to put off buying new Sterns in hope of the Pine

[26:48] Sky Vault.

[26:49] Alright, well, levy, you say a lot in this post and I want to...

[26:53] Here's my thinking around vault editions.

[26:56] I love you.

[26:57] I think you're wrong that they've only put out one.

[26:59] How can you not consider Spider Man a Vault?

[27:05] Stern never said that vault editions will simply be a 100% remake of the original game.

[27:10] They never said that.

[27:12] So I consider Spider Man to be a Vault.

[27:15] I consider Batman to be somewhat of a Vault edition.

[27:19] This whole re-skinning, re-thieving, old game is still then going back to the Vault and

[27:25] re-releasing a title.

[27:27] If what we're hearing is true, ACDC will be a Vault edition that will come out with new

[27:32] art.

[27:34] And so Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Rings Vault edition at $8,000 would sell like hotcakes

[27:41] levy.

[27:42] I don't understand why these guys don't get that.

[27:45] If you make any changes to Lord of the Rings for the better and you vault it and you charge

[27:50] eight grand, it would sell.

[27:53] It would sell like butter.

[27:56] Is that even a phrase or like butter?

[27:58] I don't think so.

[27:59] It would sell like hotcakes.

[28:00] And the reason why is that the artwork is the part of Lord of the Rings that kind of

[28:05] sucks, right?

[28:06] The pixelated cabinet art is horrible.

[28:09] And even on the play field, if you look at the one weakness of that game and I think Lord

[28:12] of the Rings is as close to pinball perfection as you can get, it could really use updated

[28:19] artwork.

[28:21] Even on the L.E.s that came out later, like in 2008, 2009, you still had that pixelated

[28:27] sort of terrible Photoshop art.

[28:31] It's not horrible.

[28:32] It's by no means like the worst if use of Photoshop that Stern's done.

[28:37] But if you updated Lord of the Rings, right?

[28:40] If you gave people better brass plated legs and side armor, it would sell.

[28:48] It would sell.

[28:49] It would sell all day long at $8,000.

[28:51] In fact, I think you could vault edition Lord of the Rings with new art and sell for

[28:56] $10,000.

[28:57] Especially if they say, hey, look, we're only going to make, if they said we're going to

[29:01] make $500 vault edition Lord of the Rings, commemorative editions, calm whatever they want,

[29:08] with better brass plating and this and that, they would sell everyone.

[29:13] And so will it happen?

[29:14] I don't know.

[29:15] That's the thing about vault editions.

[29:16] We hear rumors of Lord of the Rings, of Tron.

[29:19] George Gomez keeps saying, every game you expect, we're going to vault.

[29:25] I think Levy is on to something that I think Stern does dangle that out there to prevent

[29:32] people from buying used games.

[29:35] Because why do you want to go buy the used one if the new one's about to hit, right?

[29:41] We see that now.

[29:42] I think there's a reason why people are starting to unload more of their ACDC, Lucy's than

[29:48] ever before and other ACDC titles are going up for sale.

[29:52] If people believe that a vault is coming out that has new artwork and it's a premium

[29:56] ACDC, people probably want to get that one because they think that one could be the more

[30:02] sought after one, right?

[30:04] The rare one.

[30:05] It's that's always going to be what people chase.

[30:08] Even if it's, you know, I, I, I don't think these are like truly collectibles, but if

[30:13] there's a new ACDC with new art, that's going to be where people chase, okay?

[30:17] And that's, it's just that simple.

[30:19] I personally, I hate, I hate vaults.

[30:22] I hate looking to the past.

[30:23] I, I think there's so much exciting stuff coming out in Pimball.

[30:28] Do we really need to go back and remake and re-skin and re-theme old games?

[30:33] Why can't games just have their moment and move on?

[30:37] Okay?

[30:38] You know, you don't see people going back too often and, and re-releasing movies with new

[30:43] effects put in.

[30:44] Yeah, George Luke has tried that, but you don't even need it.

[30:46] Like let a movie, let a game, let it, let it have its time.

[30:51] Let it, let it have its time and then move on.

[30:54] And there's enough, we're moving on to that.

[30:56] I really don't like that.

[30:59] We have to constantly be unsure of like what's next.

[31:03] Is it something from the past?

[31:04] Is it something, you know, from the present?

[31:05] Is it something from the future?

[31:07] Just release new games, Stern, and don't look back, but they're not going to listen to

[31:11] me because there's money on the table.

[31:13] There's money on the table.

[31:14] All right, what else is going on in the Pimball world?

[31:17] Attack from Mars is, are they shipping?

[31:19] We keep seeing production is ramping up over at Chicago Gaming and Planetary Pimball.

[31:27] And I don't know.

[31:28] I haven't heard anyone who has received their attack from Mars remake.

[31:34] I heard that May is the month that it is going to go out.

[31:38] So we look forward to seeing if those games go out sometime over the next couple weeks.

[31:42] Now speaking of the next couple weeks, it is what May 11th today.

[31:46] Is it, and 11th or 12th?

[31:49] So the Star Wars, the actual date of the Star Wars 40th anniversary, I believe is May 25th.

[31:57] Okay.

[31:58] I think that's a Friday or Thursday.

[32:02] If you believe the new rumor, okay, this is the new Star Wars rumor that just keeps on

[32:08] going, May 25th is a likely date to release a teaser video to commemorate that day.

[32:17] So will that happen?

[32:18] I don't know.

[32:19] I don't know.

[32:20] Star Wars is the worst kept secret in Pimball history.

[32:24] I don't know.

[32:25] I keep hearing that ACDC might be before it, but then I keep hearing that Star Wars will

[32:30] be on the line in June.

[32:32] Like they will be making Star Wars in June.

[32:35] So that means that a release and a reveal is going to happen imminently, right?

[32:41] Will it happen in two weeks?

[32:42] I don't know.

[32:43] I kind of wanted to just take a break from doing this podcast until a couple of things

[32:49] happen until alien Ellie shipped or Star Wars was revealed because there is this, we're

[32:56] all waiting.

[32:59] This is the news.

[33:00] This is the big news of the summer.

[33:02] This is the big news of Pimball that we've been waiting for.

[33:06] What will Star Wars be?

[33:07] What will it be?

[33:08] We've speculated so long on it, the expectations are so high on it.

[33:13] I don't know if it can deliver, but I go back and forth.

[33:17] Like one day I'll wake up and be like, eh, it's going to be a richy game.

[33:21] It's going to have ramps.

[33:22] It's going to be a game full of flow, but I don't think richy really puts magic in terms

[33:26] of mechanisms.

[33:27] I don't really know if I'm going to like it that much.

[33:29] Yada, yada, yada.

[33:31] And then what will happen?

[33:32] I'll wake up the next day and I hear the John Williams theme song.

[33:33] I'm like Star Wars is going to be the greatest Pimball machine of all time.

[33:36] How could I not get Star Wars?

[33:37] I'm going to buy eight of them.

[33:38] I'm going to buy every single Ellie version, light slide, dark side, you know, Sith Lord,

[33:42] Jedi, Yoda, Skywalker edition, Darth Vader edition.

[33:46] I'm going to buy them all, Boba Fett edition, you know, Star Wars.

[33:50] You know, it's crazy.

[33:51] It's crazy how, but that's what makes it fun, right?

[33:54] I think all of us are in this boat.

[33:56] The most fun with all this stuff, with this entire hobby is the anticipation of the game,

[34:03] right?

[34:04] Leading up to it, dreaming about what it could be.

[34:07] Imagining what's going to be on the play field, imagining what the artwork will look like.

[34:12] All of that anticipation is what makes collecting so much fun, right?

[34:18] The chase, the dreaming, the imagination.

[34:22] When we actually get it, it's so rare that what's delivered lives up to our expectations

[34:29] and creates a high that is as high as the anticipation high we get, right?

[34:36] And we know that Star Wars, man, it better blow people away or people are going to be disappointed.

[34:42] Now look, I do think it's going to be amazing.

[34:45] I mean, I'll tell you why because the theme is just so powerful.

[34:49] It's so powerful.

[34:50] There's not another franchise out there that emotionally, I think emotionally, stirs

[34:56] people quite like Star Wars.

[34:57] Now look, when you read Pinside, a lot of these guys are like, well, Star Wars is kind

[35:01] of like old, it's not that popular.

[35:03] These guys are out of their mind, like the old cramudions that don't understand.

[35:07] Star Wars has transcended generations.

[35:10] Kids are more obsessed with Star Wars than you old farts out there who collect pinball

[35:14] machines.

[35:15] You've just missed it.

[35:16] You're just not aware of it.

[35:17] For those of you who have kids, you know what I'm talking about.

[35:20] You know how obsessed.

[35:22] Children are with Star Wars.

[35:24] The new movies are phenomenal.

[35:25] For those of you who haven't seen the new movies, I don't know.

[35:28] You need to let go of the prequels that Lucas did.

[35:32] These new movies are incredible.

[35:34] Rogue One, episode seven, are incredible films.

[35:38] The franchise is hotter now than it's ever been.

[35:42] You know, so on theme alone, I think Star Wars, with an LCD, with clips from the original

[35:48] movies knowing that they made this pinball machine based on the original three movies

[35:52] that universally people love, is incredible.

[35:56] The part about it emotionally moving people, that music, the music of Star Wars, the

[36:02] scenes, people know every scene word for word.

[36:05] Star Wars is such a more emotionally gripping film than like Alien is.

[36:10] I mean, aliens like a great movie, but it doesn't emotionally move you.

[36:14] You don't get like goosebumps.

[36:15] There's no scenes in Alien that are aliens that really bring you to that point.

[36:22] Right?

[36:23] Like when Obi-Wan says, like, well, that's a name I haven't heard in a very long time.

[36:27] Right?

[36:28] Or the scene where Obi-Wan and Vader are fighting, and he looks over and he sees Luke and

[36:32] he lets Vader kill him.

[36:34] Right?

[36:35] All the Yoda scenes, all the scenes between like Han and Leia.

[36:38] Like these scenes, they're just so iconic.

[36:41] And you can't get those levels of like emotional draw in other themes.

[36:50] And that's the thing too.

[36:51] I think about Star Wars versus Dial then, because that's my dilemma this summer.

[36:55] I know both are going to come out around the same time.

[36:58] And I'm sorry, but like how does saving quantum city compare to blowing up the death star?

[37:04] Right?

[37:05] How does shooting bobs, whatever, theater, how does shooting that compare to like shooting,

[37:14] you know, an AT-80 or starting up the hyperdrive versus like keeping aliens

[37:21] away from quantum city, right?

[37:23] It's going to be so hard for me not to want Star Wars, right?

[37:29] And I think that's my dilemma is I know for a fact.

[37:33] I know for a fact Dial then is going to be the better built pin.

[37:37] It'll probably be better designed.

[37:39] It'll probably be even, like, you know, maybe even, I'm choosing my words carefully here.

[37:47] It should be more, it probably plays more fun in terms of what the balls do.

[37:51] It's doing it all the magnets and it's a waller design, right?

[37:54] But, but I just know it will never emotionally pull me in the way Star Wars would.

[38:00] It just, there's nothing it can do.

[38:02] There's nothing it can do.

[38:03] I have no emotional attachment to what's going on in Dial then, to selfie modes,

[38:08] to any of the stuff that's happening in the game.

[38:10] But I think it'll be a better pinball experience, but Star Wars will just be a more emotional

[38:16] and visceral experience that will, that transcends even pinball.

[38:20] It just will.

[38:21] And I think that's why Star Wars is going to be the best selling stern of all time.

[38:26] And if you think it's not going to be, you're crazy.

[38:28] You're crazy.

[38:29] Wait.

[38:30] Just wait until the madness occurs when Stern reveals it.

[38:35] My thoughts on the Ellie number.

[38:37] I only think Stern's going to make 500 LEDs of Star Wars.

[38:40] I really do.

[38:41] I don't think they're going to make a thousand limited editions.

[38:44] I don't.

[38:45] I think Stern knows that a thousand of anything, whether 500 or light side and five

[38:50] hundred or a duck shot, I think a thousand is just too many.

[38:54] And they know how to create the hype.

[38:57] And they know that they can sell more, but they still keep it limited.

[39:00] They did it with Batman.

[39:01] They did it with Ghostbusters.

[39:03] They could have sold a thousand Ghostbusters.

[39:04] Ellie's easily.

[39:06] But Stern keeps some special.

[39:08] So I fully expect only 500, which means there might be like only 250 dark and 250 light.

[39:14] And if you believe Stern, and you believe that half of those are going to go overseas,

[39:18] there's only going to be potentially 250 total Star Wars Ellie Pimble machines available

[39:26] in the United States.

[39:28] Good luck getting one.

[39:30] Good luck.

[39:31] If you are not in on a Star Wars now, you are not getting one for MSRP.

[39:36] And in terms of like what the second hand value of a Star Wars will be, I don't know.

[39:42] Look, I've sold Ghostbusters and Batman two themes that are not even close to being

[39:48] as popular as Star Wars for thousands more than they were MSRP.

[39:52] So it's going to be exciting.

[39:54] I don't know about you guys.

[39:55] I can tell I'm excited.

[39:56] Star Wars in the summer of a brand new Star Wars Pimble machine is coming out.

[40:02] You know, I think I'm so excited looking at this stuff too, because I know it's going

[40:05] to happen, right?

[40:06] I've stopped reading Pinside that much, because I'm so tired of the threads that depress

[40:13] me, right?

[40:14] All these companies that don't have their shit together, it's just depressing.

[40:16] It's sad.

[40:17] It takes the fun out of the hobby.

[40:19] Pimble should be about games that are out there, games that are coming out.

[40:24] It should not be about this constant back and forth trying to figure out what's going

[40:28] on with the company.

[40:29] Like, we're not worried what's going on with Stern.

[40:31] We're wondering how awesome Star Wars is going to be.

[40:35] We don't have to worry about like the like the financials of the organization.

[40:40] We're worried like, are they dreaming about this theme as much as we are and are they

[40:44] going to deliver?

[40:45] And that's how it should be.

[40:46] These are toys.

[40:47] Like, these companies are toy companies for no better terminology.

[40:54] Toy companies should make the toys and get the toys to us big kids so we can play with

[40:57] them.

[40:58] All right.

[40:59] That's it.

[41:00] Everyone out there who doesn't have their shit together, I hope they all go away by the

[41:04] end of this year and only the companies that are giving us our toys survive.

[41:08] All right.

[41:09] I don't know what's going on in the Netherlands.

[41:11] I don't know what's going on in the UK.

[41:13] I don't know what's going on in all these other places.

[41:15] But, man, Stern Army is going to keep growing and Star Wars is going to put other companies

[41:21] out of business.

[41:23] If you don't think that's going to happen, you're just fooling yourself.

[41:26] Keep buying stock, Hilton in that company.

[41:28] Keep thinking it's all going to turn around.

[41:30] It's not going to turn around, guys.

[41:32] Money is going to go to a galaxy far, far away and companies that don't have their shit

[41:37] together are going to collapse in 2017.

[41:41] Have a beautiful Friday, have an amazing Mother's Day, enjoy your weekend and shoot me any

[41:47] feedback to CanadianPimball at gmail.com.

[41:51] Have a great weekend, guys.
