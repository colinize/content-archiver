[00:00] It's been one week since you looked at me

[00:03] I can't handle the sudden, so I'm hungry

[00:05] Five days since you left, you made the same

[00:07] Get back together, come back and see this

[00:16] Welcome to episode 209 of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:20] Happy Monday morning, everybody

[00:22] We've got a bunch of pinball news to talk about on this episode

[00:27] Hope you guys had a great week

[00:29] I'm just gonna dive right into it

[00:31] The first news that I'm hearing

[00:34] We're gonna go down by manufacturer

[00:36] Jersey Jack Pimball has a change occurring at the top levels of Jersey Jack Pimball

[00:44] I'm hearing that the CEO Joe Harbor, he's out

[00:48] He's no longer part of Jersey Jack Pimball

[00:51] Now I don't have any more details on why Joe is no longer the CEO of the company

[00:57] Who is stepping in to become the CEO of Jersey Jack Pimball

[01:01] Joe was with the company for a little over two years

[01:05] Two years and three months now

[01:07] What does that mean for Jersey Jack?

[01:09] I don't know, I don't know

[01:11] It still seems like things are going full steam ahead with Pirates of the Caribbean

[01:16] About to be shown again at TPS and orders

[01:20] And distribution and production of the game are about to happen in Q1 of 2018

[01:26] So not sure what this means

[01:29] I'm sure we'll learn more about who is filling in for Joe

[01:33] But that is a big change happening at the top of Jersey Jack Pimball

[01:38] Now staying on the subject of Jersey Jack Pimball

[01:42] For those of you in on Pirates of the Caribbean

[01:45] You have to watch straight down the middle did an incredible sort of walkthrough of the game

[01:52] It's on YouTube they talk to Eric the designer they talk to Keith the coder

[01:57] And it's about two hours long of a deep dive into the game Pirates of the Caribbean

[02:03] Now I think POTC as the abbreviation of the game is really interesting

[02:08] Because I can't help but feel like this game should be called Pirates of the Complex

[02:15] Because there's so much going on in this game that I just have to say

[02:21] When they go over how to play the game you kind of need an encyclopedia to figure out everything to do in the game

[02:29] And I'm a little bit concerned about that I have to say I just don't think a Pimball machine should require a half hour tutorial on how to play the game

[02:41] There's just too much going on

[02:44] And if you look at the game and you look at the sheer amount of inserts and arrows and it's just too much

[02:52] At some point I really wish Pimball designers would reach a point where there can't be too much stuff going on

[03:02] I mean there's like there's inserts and there's targets and there's shots that are happening in the game

[03:08] I don't think you can like physically see them I think those like things that happen at the top of the play field where the magnets shooting the ball back and forth

[03:16] You don't even like I don't even know if you can control or see what's going on there but something is going on there

[03:22] And it just begs the question is how much is too much in Pimball?

[03:28] And I think you guys should go look at the white wood of Pirates of the Caribbean

[03:32] The original white wood had even way more inserts than the final game. So many inserts that I don't even think you could have artwork on the game

[03:40] Because there's so much they wanted to put in and I think the challenge is this when you're making a Pimball machine that is based on five movies

[03:49] You're trying to jam pack into it so much and I've said if I just thought five films is too many

[03:57] And I really hope when when we play this game that it's not nearly as difficult to figure out as some of these early videos I've been watching

[04:07] I just really for the life of me I don't think Pimball machines should be so complicated

[04:13] And as I look at like you know I use Batman as an example because I have one in front of me

[04:18] It's not that hard to explain to people here's the here's the goal of the game

[04:22] You want to put the villains in jail and here's how you do that go. I mean it's that simple and each villain has a corresponding shot

[04:30] And there's not that much to go over I think you could explain all there is to do in Batman in just a couple minutes

[04:38] Now I don't think the same is true for for Pirates of the Caribbean and look look I'm just gonna say it

[04:44] I just think these games are getting too complex I really do and I think maybe that's great if you own the game

[04:51] And you're gonna have it for years and they're designing these games for those people

[04:55] But I think these games are gonna be a nightmare on location for people to try and figure out

[05:01] Alright what else is going on? I actually we don't really talk too much about four sale threads on this podcast

[05:08] But every once in a while I see a four sale thread that makes me scratch my head a little bit

[05:13] And we all know that being the price police is the easiest thing to do

[05:18] But I saw that crazy levy is trying to sell a dialed in standard edition in New York City for $7,600 and the price is firm

[05:29] This isn't one of those or best offer prices now here's the thing a dialed in standard edition the price from a distributor is basically that

[05:40] I mean that is what you would pay for a dialed in standard edition brand new inbox from a distributor

[05:46] And he wants that price and you'll be take it here take this you'll be the third owner of the game

[05:54] So there's already been two owners of this game and for for the $7,600 price you could be number three

[06:02] Why would anybody spend $7,600 on a dialed in when they could go get one for that price brand new?

[06:11] I don't get it you're gonna lose money on these machines the whole notion that a pinball machine could be passed around from owner to owner

[06:22] And lose absolutely no value is completely a name

[06:26] I don't think this game is gonna sell and I also think for people who want dialed in I just don't understand getting a standard edition

[06:34] I just don't I think it's better to get the limited edition which is not even very limited I think they made what a thousand or 1500 of them

[06:42] But it's just if you're gonna spend that much you might as well spend if like a thousand dollars more and get the one that's got all the bells and whistles

[06:51] Alright, we'll see if he sells that game. I highly I highly doubt it. What else is going on in the pinball world?

[06:57] So for you guys out there I

[07:00] Send it about maybe like 20 emails maybe more of the Hilton hoodie now for those of you who haven't seen the Hilton hoodie

[07:08] There is still time to email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[07:12] It came out terrific. It really did now my challenges

[07:16] I need to find someone to print it because the damn company won't print because of copyright infringement of the Homer Simpson image

[07:23] What I also found hilarious is that some of you tried to post pictures of the Hilton hoodie on pinside and what happened?

[07:31] The pinside moderators they yanked all the the images down. Why can't we have a little fun with this guy?

[07:38] No, no, the hoodie itself doesn't all it does is it has his famous quote about how Skitbee has the license the predator and on the back of the hoodie we make fun of the fact that if you order your Hilton hoodie

[07:51] You're gonna get it in two weeks with a nice picture of Andrew highway on the back. Alright well look if you want to see it let me know and actually I might make a small run so we could sell these things and maybe

[08:03] Maybe send the proceeds to all the people who lost money on on predator maybe that could be an interesting thing we do.

[08:10] Let's stay there real quick. Let's stay in the world of Skitbee. So I don't know if you guys have been following the thread but it's another one of these like never ending 300 something pages on on pinside

[08:24] But the problem with the Skitbee thread now is Keith the lawyer involved in the whole lawsuit against Kevin cool like he's no longer posting on pinside and he's probably not posting anymore because he's involved in an ongoing case

[08:41] And it is kind of silly to think that the lawyer in an ongoing case would be speaking about the case on a public forum like pinside so I think he's been told by the judge or the defense to just stop what you're doing

[08:56] But we know that Amanda cool like I think is officially filing for divorce from Kevin so she's had enough

[09:05] We also know that Kevin owes Amanda 27 dollars a month in child support how sad is that I think they have like four or five kids how can you break down child support to 27 dollars a month

[09:20] I mean I had one drink in New York City yesterday in the backer at hotel and it was 36 dollars and that's a drink one drink

[09:30] And that's a monthly child support fee it's just it's it's so sad following this case and I think people are finally realizing that the money's gone nobody's going to see anything all that's going to happen is you're going to bury this guy even deeper debt than he is currently I mean this this is basically like trailer park people trying to make a pinball machine I mean that's based on one of the most expensive

[09:59] active licenses IP's out there Arnold Schwarzenegger you I mean everyone fell victim to this I I want us to just reach a point where we just say it's done it's over you lost your $4,500 you learned a lesson and walk away it's just time to bury this whole thing it's over it's over and there will never be any real forgiveness given to Hilton and to the people who kept everyone in on it

[10:28] because the people who are skeptical they were right to be skeptical and they were ignored by the by the people shielding the game and we all know how it ended but look it's not about forgiving Hilton or those shells who kept people in on it it's now reached the point where like everyone needs to just shut up and bury this thread I would just lock it it's over it's over there is nothing left

[10:51] there's nothing to come from this in the future all right where should we go next in this little sort of schmorgasborg of pinball manufacturers let's go to home pin so thunderbirds is going to start shipping soon that's what it seems and the price I hope you're sitting down the price for thunderbirds is actually not bad it's $4,999 so it's a little bit underneath the price

[11:21] of a stern pro which if you think about it that's really really low considering Mike had to build a pinball company and a manufacturing plan and everything from the ground up and he's able to get the price that low

[11:36] so that's sort of what his goal was from the very get go if he can control the supply of parts in China he can get the price down and $5,000 for thunderbirds

[11:47] now the real question becomes do you still want thunderbirds based upon who Mike is as a person and how well the game plays and we haven't really seen the newer version of thunderbirds we all saw the original gameplay videos that were pretty horrendous

[12:03] so I think the game has a long ways to go I still you know I found it funny that the distributor in Australia that is going to be shipping this game are you ready for this the name of the distributor is highway pinball

[12:19] I'm not making this up highway pinball will be the distributor for home pin I mean is that just like an ironic twist of faith that that's the name of the distributor now it is not highway from the UK

[12:32] I mean I just spelled like the traditional spelling of highway but I just found it hysterical that home pins going to try and sell games from from a distributor named highway anyway we'll see what happens my point of view on this game is I think Mike is really really damaged his company's reputation

[12:52] I think that people are going to stay away from home pin because of him and I think it was a silly stance to take and I think when you start to get into political and social statements and insensitivities and then not apologizing for them all you're doing is hurting your company

[13:12] I don't just make a pinball machine make a pinball company don't make it personal and don't get into stupid arguments with people so speaking of getting political let's jump to mezzle mods so I got an email in my I can eat a pinball from the mezzle mod from from from Kristen and it was like can you guys go on to Facebook and support us because we've taken a beating over the past few days

[13:41] I was like what I don't even know like what what it was referring to so I went over there and I read this morning it seems that they have decided not to work with FedEx anymore because of FedEx supporting the NRA and we've all seen the tragedy that happened in in Florida and the gun debate issue continues to be one of the you know the most prevalent issues facing America today and I'm not going to go into my opinions about the issue

[14:11] I'm not going to talk about this but their decision to stop using FedEx because of their support of the NRA it kind of created issues for them it created a debate about that topic and you know some people supported them doing this other people are like you know what I'm not going to buy from you anymore because people who buy pinball mods they are going to be politically divided

[14:36] like every product out there you are going to have people who are in support of Trump and against Trump you are going to have people who are in support of owning guns and people who are against it but when people think about pinball they don't want to think about those political issues

[14:53] and they don't want the people who make their pinball products to make political statements that could you know couldn't make it difficult for them to support such companies

[15:06] and so my whole thing on this is look I think if you own your company you have every right to stand up for what you believe in and if you feel really passionate about something because you have children and you just feel this is the right thing to do

[15:21] then by all means you have the power to make a statement like this to work with whichever carrier you want but as some people have pointed out you also have to think about it like we're a business like at the end of the day we are a business and the best thing for our children is for us to run our business and make it as successful as possible

[15:47] because I've always believed in the world the ultimate freedom comes from when you become financially independent and you don't have to rely on anybody else you don't have to rely on government you don't rely on family members you don't have to beg borrowers steal you are financially completely independent and I've always believed that that's where real freedom lies in America

[16:10] because money is the ultimate thing that tells you like where you can live where you can eat what you can wear where you can travel to everything everything it is a thing that gives us freedom and peace of mind and obviously it's not the most important thing in life right but it's still like I think you got to put the business first and you know making this move I think people could argue that not using FedEx isn't really going to do anything to come back to you

[16:40] and that the gun issue in America all it's going to do is inconvenience some of your customers and is that is it worth it okay but again it's their business their decision I I I I would still buy from them of course I would because here's the thing too is I try to see things a little bit balanced and I support people who have an opinion who care about something who are passionate enough about a topic to make a decision like this

[17:09] and I won't hold it against them even if I believe the opposite of what they're saying because it's it's to me it's kind of a name to think that someone is is making a mistake by not wanting there to be gun violence right and someone is making a mistake because they would rather see children protected

[17:30] I mean, how do you not respect that stance?

[17:32] And that's just me.

[17:34] I get labeled all the time as like a New York City liberal

[17:37] and I'm not, I'm like I'm raised by a conservative family.

[17:42] I'm very socially liberal,

[17:44] but I'm very fiscally conservative.

[17:45] And that's always been my stance on life.

[17:47] All right, let's move on.

[17:49] I still think you guys should support Meso-Moz.

[17:51] I think Meso-Moz, whichever way you pronounce it,

[17:54] I think they're great people.

[17:55] I think they make great products

[17:57] and I think we should respect the fact

[17:58] that they're doing something,

[18:00] that they're activating in some way.

[18:01] All right, now let's go over to Chicago Gaming.

[18:05] It's a new week and everyone is waiting to see

[18:08] how they handle the large issues

[18:10] that have been facing attack from Mars Remix.

[18:14] We talked a couple of podcasts

[18:15] ago about play field issues and cabin issues

[18:20] and how they have failed to come to the aid

[18:23] of people who have had chipped play fields,

[18:27] who have had terrible play field wear early on in the game,

[18:30] planking, play fields, whatever you want to save.

[18:33] You know, there might be some silk screening

[18:36] where the colors are off.

[18:38] These major issues that customers are facing,

[18:42] how will they handle these issues?

[18:44] We're still waiting to see, as of today,

[18:47] I have still heard no reports that Chicago Gaming

[18:51] is taking care of their customers.

[18:54] And we're gonna hold them to it.

[18:55] We're gonna keep reporting on this

[18:57] until we hear what their resolution is.

[19:00] But the update this week is there is still no resolution

[19:05] that they've provided to those people.

[19:06] So we hope they do the right thing.

[19:08] We hope they do the right thing.

[19:09] All right, let's move on to Stern Pimball.

[19:13] And look, we're seeing a lot more,

[19:15] we're gonna see Iron Maiden within two weeks.

[19:17] We all know it.

[19:18] Iron Maiden is going to be at Texas Pimball Festival.

[19:22] It is most likely a Keith, it is Keith Elwin.

[19:26] It is most likely an archery theme.

[19:29] And we are gonna see Zombietti's artwork on it.

[19:32] And I'm hearing that it's based on the Book of Souls.

[19:34] And I'm hearing the Book of Souls rumor

[19:36] from very, very reliable sources, okay.

[19:40] So if you don't want it to be based on Book of Souls,

[19:43] I think you might be disappointed,

[19:44] but that's what I am hearing.

[19:47] And I don't know.

[19:48] I mean, we're ready to see it.

[19:49] This is like that pre-TPF sort of law.

[19:53] Like even when you go on this week in Pimball,

[19:55] there's no real news.

[19:56] There's not a lot of stuff that people don't know about.

[20:00] And the curtain is about to be pulled back

[20:03] on this title.

[20:06] There's a, we're not gonna have to speculate much longer.

[20:10] So that's coming.

[20:12] There's the new Batman code, 0.88 is out.

[20:15] I actually had a chance to install and play it.

[20:18] And look, it makes the game great.

[20:21] I mean, the things that are getting better in the game,

[20:24] there's the riddler has been fully coded now.

[20:28] So you can choose to either jail him

[20:30] or continue playing him.

[20:32] You, basically the way it works is you can,

[20:33] you can jail a major villain immediately

[20:36] after you hit a certain amount of shots,

[20:38] or you can keep playing into that in the villain.

[20:41] And the points go up and up.

[20:43] And you can do, you can, you can continue playing

[20:45] up to three times.

[20:46] And it shows you more clips from the shows

[20:49] and you get better points.

[20:51] The thing about the game too is when you drain,

[20:54] you're still in the mode.

[20:55] So you don't lose being in the mode,

[20:57] which actually I think is good.

[20:58] There's not like the ultimate risk

[21:00] of losing all that you've worked up to.

[21:03] The thing that does make the game hard

[21:06] is the minor villains are actually much more hard

[21:09] than the major villains.

[21:11] And the minor villains, some of them require up to 10 shots.

[21:15] For some of them, like bookworm,

[21:17] I feel like I've never jailed him.

[21:19] I don't even know how to finish bookworm mode.

[21:21] I don't, I feel like I hit a million shots

[21:23] and he's still never completed.

[21:26] I do think the minor villains are a little too tough.

[21:29] And I think for those of us trying to get to

[21:32] Betoosy Multi-Ball, it's really hard.

[21:34] Here's my recommendation for the best way to get there.

[21:38] Do the mad hat or he's the one I can jail them easiest

[21:41] or put, you know, finish his mode.

[21:43] Do the mad hat or in season one,

[21:45] then do egghead in season two,

[21:48] and then you have to choose Tut in three

[21:50] because he's the only option for season three.

[21:53] But I've been able to get to Betoosy

[21:54] about three times in that order.

[21:57] It sucks because I want to do like Mr. Freeze

[21:59] and whatnot, but it's so hard.

[22:01] It is so hard the amount of shots required

[22:03] in some of those other character modes.

[22:05] All right, the thing that concerns me though,

[22:08] and if you read the Batman threat,

[22:10] there were someone who just installed

[22:12] a new code update and all of a sudden we see

[22:15] node board number eight not found.

[22:17] And that was the same error that happened in my game.

[22:20] And so we're still seeing these node boards

[22:23] are problematic and they're prone to fail.

[22:25] And I really, really think that everyone who owns

[22:28] one of these modern stirrns,

[22:30] I feel like we should have some backup node boards

[22:33] on hand at all times.

[22:34] Now, my question is, will Stern sell you a node board?

[22:38] Can you buy just like a bunch of backup node boards?

[22:41] I would love to.

[22:42] I don't know if I have to wait for one to fail.

[22:45] And then that's only when a distributor can get one from Stern.

[22:48] So if you know the answer to that,

[22:49] email me at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[22:52] All right, what else is going on in the world of Pimbal?

[22:55] So deep root Pimbal.

[22:57] So it is with much satisfaction that we are hearing

[23:03] from Zidware owners that deep root has reached out to them

[23:07] and is actually starting to confirm people's claims

[23:11] on those Zidware games.

[23:12] So that is good news.

[23:14] And I think if you're in on a Zidware game,

[23:17] and you've had the bandaid ripped off so many times

[23:23] that is there gonna be light at the end of the tunnel now for you?

[23:28] I mean, you've waited five years for Raza and Alice in Wonderland

[23:32] and for you, Magic Girl, guys.

[23:34] I know you've waited for a working Magic Girl forever.

[23:37] You know, I don't know.

[23:40] I don't know if this is your best bet.

[23:41] This is your best chance at ever seeing a working Pimbal game.

[23:47] And you know, it's hard because I also know people

[23:50] who are in on the lawsuit.

[23:53] And I do, I'm torn because I feel like John needs to be taught

[23:57] a lesson, but people also just want their game.

[24:00] And if I had to choose which path I'd go down,

[24:05] which is like if you look at the two options,

[24:07] we can stay in on the lawsuit and go after John.

[24:10] And if we do that, we're not gonna be able to have a claim

[24:14] with Deeproot or we could go in on the claim

[24:20] and get a game hopefully from Deeproot.

[24:24] I mean, I don't know.

[24:26] I would just want my game.

[24:28] I just would never want any Pimbal purchase to land me

[24:33] like in the courtroom trying to sue a guy for years,

[24:36] spending money on the lawsuit.

[24:38] And then what are you gonna get?

[24:39] I don't know what you get.

[24:41] But I also did hear from the plaintiffs that

[24:44] they are close to a resolution or a judgment on this whole case.

[24:48] So I don't know how this thing's gonna play out.

[24:51] As I've said, I've sort of taken the stance now

[24:53] that I'm excited to see what happens with Deeproot.

[24:57] And I think we have, you know, an 18 month wait

[25:00] until their delivery date is promised.

[25:02] But we'll probably see stuff far before then.

[25:06] I do wanna go see what's happening at Deeproot.

[25:10] I wanna sign an NDA and go take a tour.

[25:13] I, you know, maybe we can work that out sometime

[25:16] in the next like six months, two year.

[25:18] But whenever Robert feels like it's a good time,

[25:21] I will happily go and see what's happening

[25:24] behind the scenes over at Deeproot.

[25:26] All right, what else is going on?

[25:28] Highway Pimbal continues to baffle me.

[25:31] They continue to mail parts to owners of Alien Pimbal

[25:37] with absolutely no instructions on how to install those parts

[25:41] or where things go.

[25:42] And I just, why?

[25:44] Wait, at what point is this company gonna put on its common sense

[25:49] hat and do things right?

[25:51] I just, I don't understand it.

[25:53] I really don't.

[25:54] You're continuing to make the same mistakes

[25:57] over and over and over again.

[25:58] We know that they listen to this podcast.

[26:01] We know.

[26:02] So guys, when you mail people parts,

[26:06] just print out the step-by-step instructions

[26:09] or make a video showing how those parts from,

[26:13] you know, the new parts go into an old game.

[26:15] Why not just grab a cell phone camera

[26:19] and record a half hour video that's,

[26:22] and then you just have to do it once and upload it, okay?

[26:25] I just think you can't leave your customers

[26:28] in the dark like this.

[26:31] We still have not seen Ellie's go out to people

[26:35] and that refund thread, I mean,

[26:37] it just hangs over this whole project like a dark cloud

[26:41] and people are still waiting for their money.

[26:43] And I don't know, we'll see what happens.

[26:45] I just, there's really nothing else to say on that.

[26:49] All right, what else is going on?

[26:52] American Pimbal.

[26:54] So one thing I want to talk about with American Pimbal

[26:58] is someone uploaded pictures of Houdini

[27:02] with Penn Stadium lights.

[27:05] And then they showed what the game looks like

[27:07] with Penn Stadium lights and then without.

[27:10] And I have to say, if you have not installed

[27:13] Penn Stadium lights into your games,

[27:16] it is the best mod I think you can do for Pimbal.

[27:19] I really do.

[27:20] I think it's as important as PDI glass,

[27:25] it's as important as color DMDs.

[27:27] It is a must have.

[27:29] It has changed the way my Batman plays and looks

[27:32] and it has changed the enjoyment level of the game.

[27:36] Houdini without them looks really dark with them.

[27:39] It looks incredible.

[27:40] Now here's the thing though.

[27:42] I am surprised that Stern or another company out there

[27:46] hasn't acquired Penn Stadium lights.

[27:49] I don't know if it's trademarked or not.

[27:51] But what needs to happen next is this.

[27:54] Is someone needs to design a Pimbal cabinet

[27:57] in which Penn Stadium lighting is built into the cabinet

[28:02] so that you don't have to take off the lights

[28:05] every time you lift the play field.

[28:07] Because that's the only annoying part about it.

[28:09] It's not that annoying, but it is annoying.

[28:13] And you could easily build LED strip lighting

[28:17] into a cabinet that's just always there permanently.

[28:20] And it's one of those innovations that just feels like,

[28:22] you know what, this should have been thought of all along

[28:26] with all these new manufacturers

[28:28] and all the new Pimbal innovation going on.

[28:30] Like nobody really has figured lighting out.

[28:34] So it's just important.

[28:36] It's important.

[28:37] And I think it's a great mod.

[28:38] And for those of you out there who don't have it,

[28:41] I think you need to get it.

[28:42] All right.

[28:43] Okay, I wanna read some of your mail.

[28:46] Now, I have to like go down the list

[28:49] of looking for new mail that I got

[28:52] that's not Hilton Hoodie requests

[28:54] because it's all I've been getting are Hilton Hoodie requests.

[28:59] All right, I got an email from, let's see,

[29:03] from Dave Sanders over at Highway Dave.

[29:05] Thank you.

[29:06] He always emails me.

[29:07] So I love it.

[29:09] And the subject was Star Wars licensing and art.

[29:12] And he said, okay.

[29:14] This has been brought up several times previously,

[29:16] but I think the chief difference between Zen Pimbal Star Wars

[29:20] and Sterns is in different categories of license.

[29:24] First and foremost, Zen Pimbal is a video game

[29:29] and licensed as such.

[29:31] It's the more disposable products sold in volume

[29:34] for cheap price like a comic book.

[29:37] And also like a comic book, the license

[29:40] has the ability to demand how individual elements look

[29:44] according to the style guide,

[29:46] but not how those elements are actually used

[29:49] or it would kill the product.

[29:51] The comic is trying to tell a story via sequential images

[29:55] and the game is trying to convey

[29:57] an experience through graphics that move.

[30:00] Okay.

[30:02] All right.

[30:03] Now, compare that to a Pimbal machine.

[30:06] The visual design consists of static, printed

[30:09] and non-sequential art, closest in function and style

[30:13] to a movie poster.

[30:15] And that license is going to exert strict control over.

[30:19] Ditto for the fact that the Pimbal experience

[30:22] relies a lot more heavily on reproducing existing media

[30:27] than a video game, which can fill in the gaps.

[30:30] The Pimbal machine is also a prestige,

[30:35] a piece of high cost merchandise as you can get.

[30:39] And so of course, Lucas Disney will want the product

[30:41] to represent their brand as authentically as possible

[30:45] under their own terms.

[30:47] But it's not manufactured by an industry

[30:49] whose revenue reflects that prestige you said

[30:52] as much before.

[30:53] Pimbal just isn't that big and that's what I think

[30:56] this all boils down to in the end.

[30:59] And why Stern's hands were tied before they even

[31:01] knocked on Disney's door.

[31:03] All right.

[31:04] All right, but you can't tell me this, Dave.

[31:06] I get your point.

[31:07] But if you are going to make a limited run product,

[31:12] like a Pimbal machine, and it's been like 20 years

[31:15] since there's been a Star Wars theme Pimbal machine,

[31:19] you're telling me that Disney wouldn't want their Pimbal

[31:23] machine to have the nicest looking art package

[31:26] of any Pimbal machine ever that their hands were tied.

[31:30] I just can't imagine that being the case.

[31:34] And besides that, the actual game, the way the game was designed,

[31:40] I'm just never going to believe that putting a tie fighter

[31:45] on a spring and a lazy LCD screen with targets in front

[31:49] of it is the best design Stern could have done

[31:54] to bring to Disney for approval out of all the things

[31:58] in the Star Wars universe.

[32:00] I mean, if you go look at the data E Star Wars game,

[32:02] look at all the sculpts and the toys from the Star Wars world.

[32:06] You can't tell me that they couldn't have got more creative

[32:10] with everything in that universe than they did.

[32:13] I'm sorry.

[32:14] I just don't buy it.

[32:15] I think that they wanted to do the Hyperloop as the main thing.

[32:20] It's not even the main part of the movie franchise.

[32:23] And they made a game that is, it's a Steve Richie game

[32:27] that is like with Star Wars slapped on top of it.

[32:30] It's not a Star Wars game from the bottom up.

[32:33] It's just not.

[32:34] And look, I get it's fast, I get it's fun,

[32:38] but I just don't think that this will go down

[32:41] as a great theme integration.

[32:43] And I don't think Disney is to blame, I don't.

[32:45] I think Stern, I think this is the game Stern was going to make

[32:49] because of who they had on it.

[32:51] And that's that.

[32:52] All right.

[32:53] I got an email from Tim Leonard.

[32:57] And Tim wrote me a long email.

[32:59] And he basically said, look, he's a big Lebowski early

[33:05] achiever.

[33:07] And he wrote, the thing that really incited me to email you

[33:12] was listening to your latest episode last night

[33:14] and hearing you say in the same breath

[33:17] after expressing empathy with alien and the big Lebowski

[33:21] buyers, how we were all a bunch of fools for prepaying

[33:26] for a game rather than buying Amazon stock.

[33:29] I realized that you mean to use our pre-purchase mistakes

[33:33] as a lesson for others in the hobby.

[33:35] But please be aware of how you're choosing to make your point.

[33:39] It's bad enough that I've had to deal with not getting a game

[33:42] that I paid for four years ago now.

[33:46] And I don't need yet another lecture on how stupid it was

[33:50] to trust Dutch Pimball in retrospect.

[33:54] Or on top of that, how much money I could have made

[33:57] in addition to what I may end up losing?

[34:00] Times have changed since I made that pre-purchase years ago.

[34:04] I've learned a hard lesson and believe me,

[34:06] I'm not about to make that mistake again.

[34:09] Thanks again for your time and dedication.

[34:11] I look forward to future Canadian podcast episodes.

[34:14] Well, look, Tim, I am sorry, man.

[34:16] And it's like, I know I can sometimes say we all should have

[34:21] thought, wiser, that hindsight is 2020 when it comes to

[34:26] everything people is doing in Pimball.

[34:28] Everything people were doing in Pimball when it came to

[34:31] purchasing decisions four years ago was idiotic.

[34:34] Everybody was stupid.

[34:36] We were throwing money at Magic Girl.

[34:38] We were throwing money at Roz, and we were throwing money

[34:40] at the Big Lebowski.

[34:41] We were throwing money at Andrew Highway.

[34:44] I mean, people paid in full for alien Pimball

[34:47] before full throttle even started shipping.

[34:50] Payed in full.

[34:52] And when you ask people why, like, why did you pay in full?

[34:56] The whole thing was people's fear of missing out.

[34:59] They were worried that they were going to get locked out

[35:01] of one of these limited games, and I'm not going to make

[35:05] the same mistake as Tronelli.

[35:06] I'm not going to make the same mistake as like ACDC,

[35:09] like back in black edition.

[35:11] I'm not.

[35:11] I'm not going to miss out and then see the game selling

[35:14] for thousands more a year later.

[35:18] And now look where we're at.

[35:21] Most of the people never got their boutique games.

[35:24] Most of those stern games that we're selling for $12,000

[35:28] have now come back down to reality.

[35:31] No one wants them.

[35:33] They're not in demand.

[35:35] I think we've all realized that, you know what?

[35:38] None of these Pimball games are really that rare.

[35:41] Like the experience is not rare.

[35:43] None of them are worth these premiums.

[35:45] It's because when you start spending upwards of like

[35:49] eight to 10 to $12,000 on Pimball machines,

[35:53] the experience of Pimball is not worth it.

[35:56] And then you also realize that the only people that give a shit

[35:59] that you've got that rare game, that only two to 500

[36:03] are out in the world, are other Pimball people.

[36:06] And you know what?

[36:08] If once you stop caring what those people think,

[36:11] and you actually just buy a game that you enjoy,

[36:14] and you don't worry about the resale,

[36:16] you don't worry about the collectibility,

[36:18] you'll realize that every Pimball machine

[36:21] becomes available for sale,

[36:23] that you don't have to rush and go get a day one, right?

[36:26] We've all learned that lesson.

[36:28] Look, everything's for sale.

[36:29] Like I found a Batman SLE, own Obtainium, right?

[36:32] I found it in box.

[36:34] There are other Batman SLEs out there for sale.

[36:37] You can find one if you want one bad enough.

[36:40] And if you offer money for a pin, you can get one.

[36:43] You know right now, I mean,

[36:44] if I were to offer $15,000 for a big Lebowski,

[36:48] you know, maybe that's what they've been going for recently,

[36:50] someone would sell me their big Lebowski.

[36:53] You know, this game is, it's out there.

[36:57] So look, Tim, I do feel bad,

[36:59] and I'm sorry if I sort of rubbed it in,

[37:02] but you know, we all were fools.

[37:05] We all were idiots.

[37:06] I mean, I was an idiot.

[37:07] I spent $23,000 on Magic Girl a year ago.

[37:12] Now let's just break it down to a year ago.

[37:15] I bet Amazon stock was like half of what it is now.

[37:18] So that $23,000, if I put into GrubHub or Amazon

[37:23] or so many companies, Domino's Pizza,

[37:26] I would have doubled my money.

[37:28] I would have had $46,000.

[37:31] All right, then I'd pay some capital gains tax on top of that.

[37:34] But you know what, but instead I lost $3,000,

[37:37] and I sold it for $20,000.

[37:40] I felt happy to be out of it.

[37:42] But you know, we're idiots if we go into these high-price

[37:46] pinball machines thinking about resale.

[37:48] Speaking of the Big Lebowski,

[37:51] I got an email from the Black Knight,

[37:53] and he wrote, Chris, just for reference,

[37:56] I have direct access for review

[37:59] of one of the Big Lebowski original ARA games

[38:02] since the percentage were shipped,

[38:06] the percentage were shipped to the United States.

[38:07] I don't know what that means.

[38:09] I guess that means most of them were shipped to the United States.

[38:12] Its design has had massive electronic and mechanical problems,

[38:16] and it has shelved an warehouse storage for nearly a year.

[38:20] I see it every day now.

[38:22] No parts, no service, and there's no concern

[38:25] about attempting to get it working again.

[38:28] As the maintenance was not worth the coinage,

[38:30] and it was generated once it started exhibiting problems

[38:34] and ball hangups in the bowling section.

[38:37] Baba, I'm speaking from people who are very experienced

[38:41] in technically maintaining games, not someone's garage.

[38:45] Private ownership has shown equal levels of issues,

[38:48] and in the case of another that was routed

[38:51] in the PNW region very briefly,

[38:55] it was pulled from location and placed in the business owner's home

[38:58] to prevent further issues.

[39:00] All right, so look, what Chris is saying is that

[39:04] the big Lebowski is very prone to problems.

[39:08] And when you have a problem, I'm going to go,

[39:09] sorry guys, I got to go pet Baba

[39:11] because he's Baba, what's up buddy?

[39:13] Do you have a big Lebowski problems, Baba?

[39:16] Or are you just barking?

[39:17] Okay, come on buddy, there you go.

[39:18] He gets a pet, now he'll calm down.

[39:21] This game, if you have problems, you're screwed.

[39:24] Everybody knows that, and I think that's the issue.

[39:26] And look, the one it's sunshine has been broken,

[39:29] I would hate to own a machine,

[39:33] and then be left out in the dark.

[39:35] Because here's what happens, if you own a game,

[39:38] and there's no customer support,

[39:40] and something happens, like your bowling alley mechanism

[39:42] goes down, owning the game will suck.

[39:46] Any mechanism that goes down in a game,

[39:49] whether it's a xenomorph head has problems with alien

[39:51] or it's the magic girl center mechanism

[39:54] or it's anything, they are theater of magic,

[39:57] trunk stops working.

[39:59] The second you have a major mech that goes down in a game,

[40:02] the game's worthless, you don't wanna play it,

[40:05] you wanna turn it off.

[40:07] And so if you don't have support, what are you gonna do?

[40:11] Imagine those Batman guys, when node board number eight

[40:14] goes down, imagine if nobody was making more node boards,

[40:19] they basically would have a broken game.

[40:20] The game wouldn't even turn on.

[40:23] And that's the danger of these new companies,

[40:26] is if they go away, you could be screwed forever

[40:31] and never have a working game.

[40:33] And you basically just have a $10,000 paperweight, all right?

[40:37] All right, let's see, I got another email,

[40:40] all these Hilton hoodies, let's see.

[40:45] All right, well look, let's end it there,

[40:48] cause I gotta get to work.

[40:50] I'll do one last one, Brian now.

[40:52] Brian, thank you for the email.

[40:54] He says, hey man, just a loyal follower

[40:57] of your pinball podcast and wanted to say,

[40:59] your podcast is awesome.

[41:01] Your passion and opinions are very entertaining.

[41:04] You focus on the stuff that's interesting,

[41:07] no BS boring filler.

[41:10] Anyhow, I live on the East Coast as well near Baltimore.

[41:14] Perhaps I'll run into you at one of the PA pinball shows,

[41:18] like York or Allentown, keep up the great work.

[41:20] Well, Brian, thank you so much, bro.

[41:23] Yes, I do go to Allentown every year,

[41:24] I usually go with Ted.

[41:26] So let's definitely connect this year at Allentown.

[41:29] And thank you again for listening to the show.

[41:32] For those of you out there,

[41:33] if you want to email me any of your pinball opinions,

[41:37] canateapinballatgmail.com.

[41:39] Have a great Monday, have a great start to your week,

[41:42] and we'll talk to you guys real soon.
