[00:00] I gave you guys a little treat there at the beginning of this podcast if you're guns

[00:28] and roses fan because that is an unreleased track called Blood in the Water that Axel worked

[00:33] on during the Chinese democracy error. I got a whole bunch of leaks that nobody's really

[00:38] heard out in the world. I'll start leaking them on this show but welcome to episode 251

[00:43] of Canadian Pimball Podcast. Happy Friday everybody. It is a very good Friday in the Pimball

[00:49] world. A lot is going on that we should celebrate. I want to start off on this episode by

[00:55] talking about my previous podcast which I think was a really good show. I think talking

[01:01] to Robert Mueller at Deeproot Pimball, hearing from him in this format, I think works best

[01:07] for him. I think it works best for his company. I think it's the best way to get you information

[01:13] about what is going on over at Deeproot. I think I asked the right questions. I think

[01:18] I pushed on some subjects that I know a lot of you are thinking about. I think we got

[01:23] a lot of information from Robert that must leave you at least curious if not excited

[01:30] about what is going on over at Deeproot Pimball. If you haven't listened to that episode,

[01:35] I encourage you to listen to it. I think you will come away with a new found curiosity

[01:43] for this company. I mean that's the best word to describe it. The advice I always give

[01:46] people like Robert is let the product do the talking. You have a lot of stuff going

[01:51] on. You have a team of people. There is no point in being on Pinside and arguing with

[01:56] people and trying to put people in their place. Ultimately, Deeproot will succeed or fail.

[02:02] They will either prove people right or wrong but it's going to be on them to deliver on

[02:08] the ambitions that they have set out to achieve. The thing that makes me believe that something

[02:16] will come of this venture is that they are not asking for people's pre-order money to

[02:21] get stuff going. Robert is a very successful business person. He has also assembled people

[02:27] who seemingly know what they are doing in Pimball. I think that's another good sign because

[02:32] I think those people would bail. They would bail pretty quickly if things were not looking

[02:38] on the up and up. For example, didn't we have the ultimate tell-tale sign that highway

[02:43] Pimball was going to be a complete failure when Dennis Nordman quit the company immediately

[02:49] after designing Alien. It's like we had the writing on the wall. It was actually pretty

[02:55] interesting. Someone uploaded a photo of Barrio and John Papaduke. John Norris is there.

[03:02] They were all eating lunch out in Texas and I have to say. It is nice seeing a bunch

[03:10] of Pimball luminaries all sitting together, having a good time, going in every day and

[03:15] trying to make great Pimball machines for everybody. That's what it should feel like. It

[03:20] shouldn't be these long faces and stressed out looks because games aren't being made or

[03:29] people's pre-order money is spent. I do wish deep-root luck and I look forward to talking

[03:35] to Robert and seeing what comes of the company as we move towards the five days of deep-root.

[03:40] Now one other thing I want to talk about is Houdini because something that I failed to talk

[03:46] about on the interview was the fact that Houdini is one of the John Papaduke titles that

[03:52] they have the rights to make. I know there's a lot of speculation about whether that's

[03:57] a dick move to do because American Pimball has made their version of Houdini and I just

[04:03] want to give my opinion on this because I have a strong opinion about this because Houdini,

[04:10] if you don't know this, Houdini wasn't the title that Joe Balser wanted to make. It isn't

[04:16] the title that Dauble wanted to make. It isn't the title that anyone at American Pimball

[04:21] had a lot of like you know this was the game that they really really wanted to have out

[04:26] in the world. Now they did make a great Houdini. Don't get me wrong. I think the American

[04:30] Pimball Houdini gives you so much bang for the buck. I'm not a fan of the tight shots in

[04:37] the game. I'm also not the biggest fan of the dark artwork in the game. I just don't like

[04:42] dark artwork on Pimball machines. I don't think it fits. It's like very steam punkish and

[04:48] I just something about it. I just don't like it. Now here is the thing. John Papaduke's

[04:53] Houdini with artwork drawn by Matt Andrews. I look the game as we saw it doesn't wouldn't

[05:01] work right. Everyone is seeing it that there's places where the ball can't get to. It's

[05:05] another typical thing. But aesthetically and the artwork in the game and I heard people say

[05:11] this like they think the colors are washed out. Anyone who saw that game and I walked around

[05:17] the play field. I walked around it. They had it at T. P. F. This is when American Pimball

[05:23] came to T. P. F. with John's play field for Houdini. The game is amazing in person. That

[05:32] game would sell like hot cakes if they actually made it. I actually prefer the Matt Andrews

[05:39] cabinet artwork and the translate artwork and the look of that more sort of cartoonish

[05:46] Houdini. I know it doesn't look exactly like Harry Houdini himself. But I actually think

[05:52] that game pops and would sell like hot cakes. For those of you out there who think people

[06:00] who want Houdini pins already have one. I think that American Pimball Houdini has shown

[06:06] deep route. If you want to make a Houdini that's a magical pin, you have to make something

[06:13] better. Look, it's not going to sell if the game they put out. It doesn't have as many

[06:17] wow features. Look, Houdini's got the incredible catapult. It's got the stage. It's got the

[06:23] stuff in it. It's got the hands, it's got the magnets in it. It's got a lot for $7,000.

[06:30] Now here's another thing that people were discussing that I just thought was silly. They're

[06:33] like, do we really need another magic pin? We've already got magic girl. We've already got

[06:37] a theater of magic. You need to realize something. John Papa Duke is obsessed. I mean, obsessed

[06:43] with magic. It is his favorite thing in the world. He is a huge David Copperfield fan.

[06:52] I believe theater of magic was supposed to be a David Copperfield pin back in the day.

[06:58] He wanted, when I used to talk to John about magic girl, and I used to talk to him about

[07:02] how do you market magic girl into the world? All he kept saying to me was, I really want

[07:06] David Copperfield to get the first one and open it up. Let's do that first. That was

[07:11] his only idea on how to get this game into the marketplace. We've got magic girl, which

[07:17] is supposed to be this sequel to theater of magic or prequel to it. I don't even know.

[07:24] Having owned a magic girl, I have no idea what the story is about. Absolutely none whatsoever.

[07:29] Harry Houdini is John's obsession. He designed Houdini and he does not want to live in a world

[07:39] where someone else took his passion and made it without him. He's that kind of control

[07:45] freak. You heard it in the interview. Robert says it. John just doesn't want anyone else

[07:50] to steal his vision. I bet J-Pop looks at American Pimples Houdini and is like, you bastardized

[07:58] my vision for this game. I think that Robert clearly wants to see John's games be made

[08:07] and he now sees those games as his games and he's not going to stop until J-Pop's visions

[08:14] for these properties see the light of day. I think we're going to see it. I'll leave

[08:20] it at that. Let me go on to what else is going on in the Pimple world. We have to celebrate

[08:24] the fact that Jersey Jack Pimple, he has a production line that is now going for the

[08:32] much anticipated, hugely delayed, still probably going to be a fun game. That's a theme that

[08:37] nobody really asks for but it's probably still going to shoot great and everyone's going

[08:41] to buy it and defend it or not buy it and hate on it. Pirates of the Caribbean. Production

[08:47] has begun. All the rumors that there's problems financially, those people will now shut up

[08:54] and go away for good. The game is on the line. We see people making it. We see different

[08:59] stages of production happening. We want to congratulate Eric and Jack and everyone over

[09:05] there for finally we know it's been a long journey getting the game on the line. It's

[09:09] exciting because there's even mods for the game. It's not even out yet. The mod couple

[09:14] has been working on some really cool stuff for that game as well. When will people get

[09:19] the game? Let's see. I would assume with stuff on the line and the way Jack normally does

[09:27] it is a lot. He sort of spreads out the love across the distributor so each distributor gets

[09:33] a few at first so it's not like one guy gets them all and everyone else is waiting. I would

[09:39] expect people to get them within a couple weeks. It's usually what the timeframe is like

[09:45] and Jack will do is cartwheel and the games will be out. They're making limited editions

[09:50] and standard editions first and then they will make collectors editions. Speaking of collectors

[09:57] edition two things. Someone is trying to sell their dialed-in collectors edition for $11,000.

[10:04] It's always interesting to me because these collectors editions, when the price is set

[10:10] so high from the factory, is there any room to make money on it? Here's why I think it's

[10:16] got to be painful to sell a game like dialed-in collectors edition for a loss because if you

[10:21] read the gentleman's post, he tells us. He's pretty straightforward about it. He's got

[10:27] $14,000 into the game he says. Then I really just don't want to lose much more. I'm selling

[10:36] it for $11,000. Right away he's losing $3,000 on a dialed-in collectors edition. My whole

[10:44] thing is I always thought the point of these super expensive collectors editions, they were

[10:52] for people who just loved Pat Lawler. You had to have this game. It's completely over

[11:00] price. We all knew that. Did anyone even get their lunch with Pat Lawler? I don't think

[11:05] anybody did. The only people I thought would buy this would be Pat Lawler fans who would

[11:12] both the game to the ground and never get rid of it. Guys like Richie Wrench, our plumber-front

[11:18] extraordinaire from Pinside who has to have every single collector's edition regardless of

[11:22] theme it seems. You can make a collector's edition of Gem and he would buy it or Care Bears

[11:28] and he would buy it. I feel like he can only own something that has collector's edition on it.

[11:34] But here's the thing. He's never going to get his coin door painted the color of the railing.

[11:39] He's never going to happen. It's all he wants. It's all he wants. But anyway, so when you spend $11,000

[11:45] on a dialed-in collectors edition, I think you'd have a hard time. I think you'd have a hard-in-time

[11:52] because it's still $11,000. We'll see if it sells. I would assume that a dialed-in collectors

[12:00] edition won't hold value the same way of Batman 66 SLE would. Here's the crazy part too. There

[12:08] are really there's twice as many collectors edition dialed-ins as there are Batman SLEs, which is

[12:16] kind of nuts. Other thing about collectors editions I want to bring up real quick is where

[12:24] are the final images of what pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition is going to look like?

[12:30] Because we haven't seen the final what you're going to get. I still have a problem with this.

[12:35] When it comes to marketing, why is Jack selling a game, his most expensive pirates of the Caribbean

[12:42] version, and people still don't know what the final package is going to be? Haven't they figured it

[12:47] out or are they still figuring it out? But they've taken people's money on it. I think that's to

[12:53] me always the issue with when you jump into something and you don't really know what you're going

[13:00] to get. I just think we're at a point now in Pimball where everyone should be 100% certain. They know

[13:08] the features, they know the trim, they know everything that the game will entail before they pay

[13:14] for the game. But we probably know that Pimball buyers will still pay for stuff without ever really

[13:21] seeing the final product in box because they just have a fear of missing out on stuff. All right, let's go on.

[13:29] I was going to talk about Guns and Roses and Jersey Jack having the license for Guns and Roses,

[13:34] but the reason why I'm never excited about anything like that because you have to ask yourself,

[13:40] when would Jack actually make this game? Like 2022? At the rate at which they're putting games out,

[13:47] I mean, we've got Willy Wonka now next, then we've got Toy Story, then Guns and Roses. It just seems

[13:54] like we would wait forever and I don't want to be reaching the age of 50 by the time

[14:00] Pires the Caribbean comes out. All right, let's talk about Stern. So two things going on at Stern.

[14:05] There's new Batman code that just dropped. I think it's 0.93. It looks like there's some updates

[14:11] and added episodes to the minor villains. I'm actually going to stop updating code on Batman

[14:18] until it's like done. I'm just I just I get it. The game is actually really fun as it is. I know

[14:24] that there's going to be like minor villain stuff tweaked. I really wish they would use the crane

[14:30] more in the game and I also really wish the villain vision actually did something. I just don't

[14:35] I just feel like to me the one part of this game that continues to like I don't know baffle me

[14:42] a little bit is the rotating table. I just feel like nothing that happens on that thing and it

[14:48] takes up such a big piece of the real estate. Nothing is like that exciting and the villain vision

[14:53] TV is really cool but I just feel like it's so underutilized and the crane is also like this

[14:58] amazing. It's like the most amazing mech on the game but it really it doesn't get utilized that

[15:04] much and I wish it would pop in more and I also wish I would hear more of the penguin in the

[15:10] game. Like I just that's the one thing too is like when the penguin crane is going you like barely

[15:15] hear any penguin quacks or callouts or anything of that nature but these are minor minor minor complaints

[15:23] on what I still consider to be a very very stellar game that I would have a hard time getting rid of

[15:30] all right. The other news at Stern is the the Star Wars topper has been revealed and you can

[15:35] find it if you go to Pinside and look at the thread we've lifted the ban on canada and to celebrate

[15:42] here are pictures of the Star Wars topper. I know it's taken a year I know it's taken a year and

[15:48] look making a topper it's it's harder than making pinball and making a Star Wars topper is probably

[15:53] the hardest thing of all time so so go check out the images inside that thread and I think you guys

[15:58] are going to be blown away by the R2D2 with the holographic display that it has all right let's move

[16:04] on to Chicago gaming company so Chicago gaming company after all this time after all this waiting

[16:12] for Monster Bash remake to be revealed or announced or was it good and be a cactus canyon how lame

[16:19] was it that they they just put out like a silly little like Facebook update like hey we're really

[16:25] bad at keeping a secret you guessed it it's Monster Bash like what like how I mean look I'm not

[16:31] saying anything negative about the actual game but what a sad and pathetic way to to finally

[16:39] announce to the world that this is the title like it just felt so piss poor like they could have

[16:46] done so much more to generate hype have a little image of like the topper have a little like

[16:53] teaser something something but to just use only words and then don't follow it up with anything

[17:01] and then say oh we're waiting on final license or approval like it just to me just is like what's

[17:06] wrong with these people like seriously like how how bad can pinball marketing get like it literally

[17:12] is like the worst it like I I shouldn't even bother I shouldn't even bother like applying

[17:18] any marketing knowledge to this industry because it's run by a bunch of like old men who are just

[17:24] winging it they really are just winging it like now the app being said let's remove how lame I

[17:29] think that announcement was the game is close we know the game we know what it is and look I think

[17:36] this game is going to do really well and from what I've heard and I and I've talked to people

[17:41] who have seen it and they are can telling me that people are gonna be blown away like it's gonna take

[17:46] what we got an attack from Mars and take it to a whole nother level so big big expectations

[17:52] around monster bash remake and so there's a lot of questions about like well what will be different

[17:56] like so we know there's going to be an amazing topper attack from our remake Ellie has probably the

[18:01] greatest pinball topper of all time we have a lot of people saying there's going to be new code now

[18:08] lineman coded monster bash right I'm I'm correcting that right and I should have looked that up

[18:13] I'm pretty sure how do you improve upon that code so that's going to be something that's very

[18:18] interesting because there you know people out there say like the monster bash code gets a little

[18:21] bit old after a while and you're going to want to sell it you know it's just it's very simple the

[18:26] way the code it maps out so will they update the code people the CE edition of monster bash is the

[18:34] classic edition it is like a stern pro it is not the collectors edition so for those of you looking

[18:40] to get on your distributor list for the top of the line version of this game you need to ask for

[18:45] the limited edition all right so let's put that bed to rest how many elis will there will there be

[18:52] probably a thousand I wouldn't think they'll go less than attack from Mars I don't think all

[18:57] one thousand attack from Mars at least sold out I would like I never like seeing a thousand elis

[19:04] I just don't I just think the word limited and one thousand just don't go when it comes to

[19:10] pinball it's just there's too many that's just too many in pinball you know three thousand dodge

[19:16] demons for the United States that's limited because there's way way way way more than three thousand

[19:22] people that want to buy that card eighty six thousand dollars okay it's there's not way more than

[19:27] one thousand people that are going to want to buy a monster bash remake Ellie in 2018 there's

[19:33] just not there's already all those monster bash is out in the world and monster bash is one of those

[19:38] titles where a lot of people who are collectors they restored them you know they they paid people

[19:44] money or they found nice examples of them and they brought them back to perfect condition and

[19:50] those people now are kind of fucked I mean let's let's be honest I mean I see this people talk

[19:55] well is it going to really hold value the old ones and it might go down a little bit but then

[20:00] it'll go back up the problem is most people got their monster bash is when they got them before

[20:05] pinball went crazy on pricing remember people used to be able to get monster bash is for like three four

[20:11] five thousand dollars and they they restored them and then then we had that period where all we

[20:16] had were like stern games that weren't that exciting and monster bash is in value Williams games

[20:22] that were restored were going for like nine ten twelve thousand dollars for like really good

[20:27] examples of those games since then the whole pinball market has changed there are so many more

[20:33] players in the games so many more new and box games the demand to have the old stuff in good

[20:38] condition is not as high as it used to be and now that they're remaking those games even better

[20:44] I mean forget it like it's it's over the the period of like you gaining that kind of money or

[20:51] those games holding that value um rgb lighting well it'd be in the game if they put rgb lighting

[20:58] in a monster bash that we know the new displays can be there with new animations you add all that up

[21:03] with with new colored trim you add it all up and I think you're gonna have a freaking knockout title

[21:10] I mean it's gonna be it's gonna be fun watching monster bash go up against uh the monsters that's

[21:16] gonna you know and out of this Cooper's nightmare castle right it's like a spooky themed battle royale

[21:22] that's gonna take place this you know end of summer fall when it comes to pinball all right so

[21:27] let's move on to highway pinball so obviously there is no more highway pinball so there's nothing I

[21:33] let's move on to alien because there's a thread on pinside um about owning an alien and it's like

[21:39] the alien owners club thread and I've been saying on this podcast that if you buy an alien pinball

[21:45] you are gonna have problems with it it's going to cause headaches and you're not gonna be able to

[21:52] enjoy it in the long run it's just a ticking time bomb now do people listen to me no iceman goes

[21:58] and buys one other people are chasing them down okay cool go buy it you know even after we

[22:04] interviewed the people who made the game Dave Sanders we got confirmation that there's just like

[22:11] things in the game that are just like designed poorly and they wish they had more resources and

[22:17] more time to make the game properly and even after we see people opening up the game and having

[22:24] left and right issues uh we still have people thinking they're gonna get one of the good ones you know

[22:31] it to me it's like the red ring of death on Xbox like it doesn't matter if you buy an alien

[22:36] you're gonna have problems now so I couldn't help but laugh at pin cider time bandit because

[22:45] it's kind of sad it's sad because if you read in that thread his recent unboxing experience with

[22:52] alien it is exactly what I've been saying will happen and what sad is this is like the story starts

[23:00] out as young time bandit is a very optimistic child who's super excited because his new toy is

[23:08] about to come in and he knows it's about to arrive the next day and he's like a kid on Christmas Eve

[23:13] you know and he talks about this about how there's just gonna be that moment of elation where he

[23:19] opens it up and he starts playing the pinball machine and he's just gonna get immersed in it for a

[23:24] few hours okay and it's coming to him and it's double box then it's like and you know it's like

[23:30] he's all right all right okay so then I want to read the following part of this story on

[23:36] canadus pinball podcast is lifted right off of time bandits own words on his unboxing experience

[23:45] with highway pinball's alien machine all right he writes as follows I haven't updated the code yet

[23:54] just checking the mechanics just had to bend the scoop top a little the ball was taking five to

[24:01] six attempts to get out everything else seems great all right so let's just let's just take a

[24:08] moment there everything else seems great all right we come back to time bandits unboxing story a

[24:15] little bit later on any rights area two fuse has just blown like everyone else has said audio

[24:24] visual is incredible just incredible there's nothing that matches it that's the other thing too

[24:30] is you always hear these these alien owners they've always got to tell us like the audio visuals are

[24:35] the best in any machine ever and they always describe their game like everything else seems great

[24:41] right so he writes everything else seems great the next line is area two fuse has just blown so

[24:49] he and he wrote all this in one posting so like why would you not go back and be like actually

[24:55] everything else is not great like a fuse just blue on my brand new machine all right but it's like

[25:01] got great audio David teal you saved the day okay but he goes on to say the following he goes now

[25:06] here's a major ball like though the recharge target is not screwed in and the two screws are

[25:14] under a damn PCB not any PCB the biggest one under the play field there is no way I'm taking that

[25:22] board off to screw that target in so I'm getting intermittent okay so that's that's another post

[25:28] okay so that's post number two so now he's got a problem or like screws are lodged under the big

[25:35] PCB and people are telling him like oh man you better be careful like don't go near that big PCB

[25:40] because if you break it you are fucked and you will never be able to get a new one remember

[25:47] the pinball brothers they are not going to go off and support highway pinball alien games there

[25:53] there's no more parts being made there's no more trans lights being made there's a guy who bust

[26:00] who got a busted translate when his game arrived and guess what that guy is that guy is fucked you

[26:06] know because there this is not going to be the kind of game we're like like the community comes

[26:11] together and makes all these replacement parts and does all these things to make sure they're all

[26:15] up and running it's just never going to turn into that kind of game all right but then he goes

[26:19] on to say this after he realizes these screws are stuck under the PCB he writes so I'm getting

[26:25] intermittent flipper failure they just stop until the ball drains then are okay on the next ball

[26:32] no I'm not tilting it got really bad at one point so I restarted the machine and that seemed to

[26:38] fix it for a while but it's still there every now and then is this a thing I haven't noticed it

[26:46] in other threads but I could have missed it otherwise I'll check connections again but given the

[26:51] behavior I don't think it's cabling all right so here's the thing and time been it I do feel bad

[26:58] for you but look this is what is going to happen with everybody who owns an alien machine as you're

[27:04] just gonna keep having these like little bugs and problems and no one's gonna be there to help you

[27:09] and owning it is gonna be a frustrating nightmare and all the beautiful lights and sounds that the

[27:13] game does have won't be worth it it just won't be worth it because you will never have peace of mind

[27:20] you will think the next plunge is the plunge you break something so then it will become a game

[27:26] that you simply have in your house and when it's working correctly you won't want to play it

[27:32] you'll want to just keep it there it'll be like a rare item it'll be a conversation piece

[27:37] but it will always make people anxious to flip and how can you not be and that is the problem

[27:44] when you have a game where you don't have a bunch of spare parts lying around and pinball as we know

[27:50] is a hobby where everything breaks and everything will eventually need some support and some help

[27:57] and you are not gonna get it on this pin so time been it we wish you luck we wish iceman luck

[28:04] but I bet you these games are gonna end up being very very heavy paper weights in the future all

[28:10] right all right what else is going on in pinball um I don't really you know I think we said our

[28:15] peace of mind on Dutch pinball I think the company is I think they're done I think we've we called

[28:23] it last year that Dutch pinball and highway pinball would not survive into 2018 and I think we were

[28:29] accurate on that I think the early achievers are have got stock home syndrome when it comes to that

[28:36] game I don't think they're ever gonna give up you know it's crazy too is and this is like there's

[28:42] never really been a sort of a story like this the reason why they're never gonna give up as long

[28:47] as those 40 games sit in box at a.r.a they're never gonna give up you know it's almost like it's

[28:54] like these guys they they feel like they've been separated from their children by trump at the border

[28:59] you know it's like they they can see their child like I saw some guy said I'm number 56 I mean oh

[29:05] man like how bad is your luck when you're number 56 and your game is built and in a box and it's

[29:12] been sitting in a box for two years and you just can't get to it like that's insanely painful for

[29:18] these people and they also have to see other people playing the game and you know it's just it's

[29:24] unfortunate it really is unfortunate so that's that's that so let's go on to team pinball mafia now

[29:32] I've been reading the thread I think it's on page like six or seven and I have to say like

[29:37] based on the feedback but you know and I think people are either like nice or nasty um it's not

[29:42] even nice or nasty I think people are like are just being kind or they're being like nasty and

[29:47] maybe honest uh I think it's hard to look at mafia at $7,500 when people are selling loaded iron

[29:57] made in pros for like 5,500 bucks it is like how do you not consider that price point for that game

[30:06] to be dead on arrival and and I'll just leave it at that I I commend them for what they did

[30:12] the the price is just too high I'm just gonna say you can't sell that thing at $7,500 you just can't

[30:17] I'm sorry like when you lift the play field on that game and you look at what's on it $7,500

[30:26] I can't I can't see it all right spooky pinball we talked about well first of all

[30:31] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is in production I've seen uh we know that one shit but I see the

[30:36] line spooky's putting up pictures like they're getting games built so we're gonna start to see

[30:41] people get their games soon so that's another good thing it's crazy all these games are coming out

[30:45] in like summer which is you know a lot of these games were supposed to come out more around tpf

[30:50] and I think we've had a wait but now you've got spooky coming out now you've got pirates the

[30:55] Caribbean you got monster bash remake you've got iron made in selling well you've got deadpool

[30:59] right around the corner you've got all these games coming uh you get you got you know you got

[31:05] mafia you've got thunderbirds you see what I'm getting at you got american pinball still needs to sell

[31:12] Houdini's there's just too many games there's too many games for your game not to be great

[31:18] there are too many games out there for your game not to be amazing and the error of like I'm

[31:22] just gonna invest in pinball to support people and support their companies at errors like

[31:27] yeah but the game still needs to be great because there's too much greatness out there in pinball

[31:31] and if you either hit a home run or you strike out I think in this pinball marketplace uh so

[31:37] Alice Cooper is in production jack danger is going to go play on July 30th I believe that's Monday

[31:43] so people can see people haven't seen much of this game uh much of the gameplay footage uh I played it

[31:49] I you know it looks great I think some of the shots are really tight I think people are some people

[31:52] are gonna get on this game it's gonna be a brickfest um but I haven't played it more than like

[31:57] once or twice so like whatever maybe I just had a shitty game so I'm not gonna declare anything about

[32:03] the way the game plays I did want to talk about as I was thinking about jack danger going over there

[32:08] because it's weird to me that people get like excited that jack danger is gonna go play the game

[32:12] um here's why I'm like I like watching it but here's what you're not gonna get you're not gonna

[32:18] get like a review of the game you're not gonna get like an honest assessment about how the game

[32:23] plays you're gonna get what jack does which is not supposed to be a review it is it's supposed to be

[32:29] like he's supposed to introduce you to the game he's gonna drink beers with the staff they're

[32:34] gonna have fun they're gonna joke they're having a good time and they're gonna show you like the game

[32:38] he it's more like jack danger gives you an introduction to a game he's not gonna give you like his

[32:44] honest feedback on the game now that's fine that's not what jack shows supposed to do but what I

[32:50] do find interesting about pinball because I was just thinking about this it's like I'm really excited

[32:53] to go see the new mission impossible and Rod and tomatoes tells me that it's fucking amazing the problem

[32:58] with pinball games at nine thousand dollars is we never get like honest reviews of the products

[33:05] um by sort of like a pinball media right and maybe just the way this hobby is but they're like

[33:13] there aren't people out there that do reviews like unbiased reviews of pinball machines and put

[33:20] them up for us to respond to where those people have credibility and cloud like it wouldn't be me

[33:28] like nobody would ever say like let let's canada hop on the game and let's hear what he thinks about

[33:33] it uh you know my opinions about pinball I I think I look at a game from what you get in it I think

[33:40] I look at it from like the wow factor you know me the world under glass that's like that's the kind

[33:44] of guy I am I I want a pinball machine to be like something amazing that makes me go holy shit like I

[33:49] need to own that but when you look at pinball and the point at which someone buys a pinball machine very

[33:57] often the person hasn't had any time on the game like very often you we haven't even got feedback from

[34:05] people about what the what the final product is and a lot of times it's because these games come to

[34:11] shows they're not complete and you get like a half baked experience it would be like asking a

[34:17] restaurant reviewer to come come review our restaurant when half the menus not done or half of the

[34:22] meals aren't even prepared properly and I think it's unfortunate and I would like to see more of a

[34:29] group of people that could become professional pinball reviewers and companies could invite them

[34:37] to play the games early and give their personal opinions and reviews of the games that in an unbiased

[34:46] unfiltered manner look it's very much the way auto manufacturers will invite auto journalists to

[34:54] like a test track somewhere or to somewhere in the world invite them to drive the new car and then

[34:59] the journalist can go right whatever they want about the experience with that car okay a lot of

[35:07] that happens now in youtube is videos from these people the problem I see with that happening in

[35:11] pinball is people are going to be too afraid to be blacklisted by the company they don't say something

[35:15] nice and then you know that's why companies like stern they want nothing to do with a guy like me

[35:21] because I'm not going to just cheerlead every game you know I mean it's just the way it is and so

[35:28] I think that's unfortunate I think I could give people my opinions about the game and I know

[35:34] enough about how to play pinball and how to get through a game and get to modes and shit I've been

[35:39] the bat to z plenty of times with the glass on at Robertson with the glass on but what I'm saying is

[35:48] that it's like it's unfortunate like we just don't know like and I said that in in you know coming

[35:52] out of the Alice Cooper comments because Alice Cooper is a game that you know 500 people are asking

[35:59] to put deposits on that we don't even have any reviews of and and so I just I just think we're at

[36:05] the point now where there could be more you know credible reviews of games before you have to spend

[36:12] your money but it's all it's hard because people just don't want to miss out on the game so they're

[36:16] going to buy it anyway without even playing it once but I just think it's pathetic when people buy

[36:20] a game and then they sell it within two weeks like that it's to me is like the dumbest thing ever

[36:24] to buy a pinball machine and like sell it within like a month or two like how bored and rich are you

[36:31] that that's what people do like this isn't like an easy thing to move in and out of a house it's not

[36:37] like a watch it's not like a cigar it's a god damn 350 pound huge box um all right what

[36:45] else I want to talk about let me read your emails real quick and then I got to call the day because

[36:50] I got to get to work so I got some emails from you guys do do do I got a lot more people asking

[36:58] to be put on the mystery pinball list so I will do that for you guys I got all right someone sent

[37:04] me the mafia do do do okay so I got an email from Jeff as he says Chris congrats on recording

[37:13] episode 250 that is a lot of airtime have you added up how many hours I guess at an hour

[37:20] an episode plus a few deleted episodes would put you around 300 hours your mom must be proud of you

[37:28] enjoyed the deeper interview Robert was entertaining and he covered a lot of material he didn't

[37:34] shy away from any questions you broke ground in your interview gathering new info I suggest you

[37:40] post a pick of Robert too nobody has done so yet and this would be a real coupe over other podcast

[37:46] to and scoop this weekend pinball all right so like I've seen pictures of Robert I never put

[37:53] pictures of people on my podcast it's usually a picture of canada in some different fashion but

[37:59] I'm glad you enjoyed episode 250 I think Robert was a great interview and again I think we saw

[38:03] a different side of Robert I know that you know he can get aggressive he can use legal means at times

[38:09] but at the end of the day you know if you can deliver a good pinball machine I think all will be

[38:15] forgiven Chris healy wrote Chris I really enjoyed your interview with Robert Mueller I think this

[38:20] was one of the best episodes you've done well thank you Chris I'm glad I got something from Dave

[38:27] Sanders he said the Dutch pinball tactic of don't sue us or you'll bankrupt the company is

[38:33] all fully familiar it's the same kind of crap and you would pull on me when I try and have

[38:39] contract meetings with him playing the victim of circumstance and making it out like it would be

[38:44] my fault that everyone else's jobs would be taken away don't think for a second that I don't have

[38:51] any of this on record either all right well look you know Dave it doesn't surprise me you know it

[38:58] doesn't surprise me that Barry Oppen Andrew highway all have similar tactics businessmen that

[39:06] fail always fail the same way they blame everybody else but themselves they're the victims it's not

[39:13] their fault it's not there it's it's it's canada and rubber ducks fault that people asked for

[39:18] refunds it's not the fact that Andrew lied and games took years later to get out he lied to our

[39:24] faces about the licensing he lied to oric about the artwork he lied he lied he lied and yet I'm

[39:31] the one who's he's threatening to sue it's my fault that the company had troubles my fault that

[39:36] it's my fault I I'm the one who went on Nate shivers show and said I was going to build 500 games

[39:42] a month that was me that was an Andrew who said that that was canada yeah okay sure sending a

[39:47] bearing you out they lied to you they lied to you about the board issue they lied to everybody

[39:53] about what the stall was they've never told you how much more a Ra was asking per game why not

[40:00] they've never opened up the books how much salary did they pay themselves shouldn't you know that

[40:07] when you you invest in a company you know what the executives are making so why won't they tell us

[40:13] what their salary was why won't they tell us how much more per game a Ra wanted why won't they

[40:20] be transparent on that instead they want us to give them five hundred thousand dollars to pay

[40:25] their legal fees and I just think the whole thing is despicable and again it's like this is who

[40:31] these guys are they ran a company into the ground and now they want you to excuse them of that

[40:38] responsibility and they want to blame the people like me who are asking you to do whatever it takes

[40:45] to get a refund and look people are getting refunds from Dutch pinball and the thing is is

[40:50] those people once they get their refund I got to be honest they don't give a flying fuck about

[40:55] the other early achievers who who are too timid to sort of stir the pot cool be that guy who doesn't

[41:02] want to upset bearing up because you still want your precious little game some guy got his 8500

[41:06] dollars last week last week he got it back and you know how we got it back he threatened to sue them

[41:13] that's how we got it back he wrote a very simple email either you give me my money back

[41:18] or I'm going to contact universal and sue you that's what he wrote like nothing more than that

[41:23] and guess what he got his money back so maybe all of you should be sending those emails

[41:28] instead of oh thinking there's some like you know hail Mary pass that's going to happen with

[41:33] a Ra it's not happening it's not happening all right all right what else did I get in emails thank

[41:38] you Dave I always love when Dave Sanders reaches out I got an email from Clinton he said episode

[41:45] 250 was crazy good definitely the best pinball interview I've ever heard everybody keeps saying

[41:51] head to head is going to win the trippy this year the in 2016 everybody was saying Hillary Clinton

[41:56] was going to win but we all saw how that went you're not going to like this comparison but you're

[42:02] like the Donald Trump of the pinball community I say that in the sense that you're liked by so many

[42:08] but a lot of those people keep it to themselves because you come with controversy and backlash

[42:14] from others I believe one of the reasons Trump was elected is because people were sick of Hollywood

[42:19] telling them who to vote for and constantly bashing Trump to the point where it became annoying

[42:25] well in this situation your Trump and Pinside is Hollywood a vote for you is a vote against Pinside

[42:32] and we all know there's a ton of people who hate the majority of Pinside users you say some things

[42:38] that you shouldn't even when you're probably advised not to and you speak your mind whether people

[42:43] like it or not you my friend are the Donald Trump of pinball keep up the great work when you were gone

[42:50] I checked out some of the other podcasts and none of them compare nobody wants to hear somebody

[42:55] talking about their weekend at a tournament or randomly telling his crap about how they burn the pot

[43:00] roast the other night keep bringing the heat and topics we enjoy hearing and you will continue to

[43:04] stay number one Clint well Clint thank you I appreciate the note I don't I don't like Donald

[43:12] Trump so I understand the metaphorical comparison to Trump as a disruptor and someone that you know

[43:20] people probably look at this podcast and say to themselves how the hell does he get anybody to

[43:27] listen to his podcast if he knows nothing if he's an idiot if he's a troll and you know and

[43:34] like I think that we provide again I keep saying this in unfiltered honest dialogue about this hobby

[43:40] and people don't want to give you that you know I think a lot of other podcasts out there they just

[43:46] want to say everything's great about pinball and they enjoy pinball and this and that and like I

[43:50] enjoy pinball too but I look at these products as unnecessary toys for your home that bring enjoyment

[43:57] and for the money they cost we should look at them with a little bit of a critical I am am I

[44:04] getting the value in this game and I've always said this no matter what I say if you buy a game and

[44:09] you enjoy it and you love it that's all that matters nothing I say matters um but I also think

[44:15] there's just a lot of shenanigans and there's a lot of can't tankerous people in you know on the

[44:21] forum that you know are immune to my kind of rebuttal of what they say and what they do and the

[44:28] thing is when I try to do that on pinside they simply band me because pinside wants to give that

[44:36] site over to you know this vocal minority that I think makes reading that site annoying and I

[44:44] think this podcast is entertaining and I think we go at the topics that people want to hear about

[44:50] and are thinking about in a way that you could never do on that site so will I become the

[44:57] twippy number one pinball podcast in the year two I don't I don't know I'm I was flattered that

[45:02] people voted for me I thought it was exciting um I you know I think what Ryan and Marty do is great

[45:07] I think there are a lot of pinball podcasts out there I don't think we need anymore um but if you're

[45:13] gonna do a pinball podcast at least do something different um but this is free the you know anyone can

[45:19] pick up a headset and do a pinball podcast you can listen to whoever you want my listener base

[45:24] goes up and down up and down up and down um you know and I'm very transparent about how many listeners

[45:28] are I get and I you know like I think head to head might get more than me it's it's always funny

[45:34] to me that know their pinball podcast other than like um what is it the little kings one they don't

[45:40] report how many people listen like it's just this secret and I'm like why is it a secret is not

[45:45] like they're making marketing dollars on it so you know how many people listen we go between like

[45:50] 1200 up to 3000 sometimes and I really just do it for those of you who tune in consistently

[45:59] and and I enjoy that you listen to the show so that is episode 251 I have to go to work everyone

[46:05] enjoy your weekends enjoy your weekends and we will talk to you again real soon
