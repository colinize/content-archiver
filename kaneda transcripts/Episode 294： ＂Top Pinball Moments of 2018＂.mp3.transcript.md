[00:00] I get knocked out, right over here, good ever gonna leave me down, right over here, good ever gonna leave me down.

[00:09] MASS!

[00:09] Alright, it's that time of year again when we are right upon the new year and I don't know about you but when we get to New Year's Eve it's a great moment of reflection right we're thinking about the year prior and we're thinking about the year ahead and it's a lot of fun to do that in the world of Pimball.

[00:35] We're gonna do that on this episode of Canatus Pimball Podcast. I am going to give to you what I believe were the top 10 moments in the Pimball hobby in 2018 and what I mean by that these are the 10 moments that I think sparked the most discussion conversation, debate, maybe controversy in Pimball in 2018.

[01:02] We're also gonna have some honorable mentions because it's really hard to do only 10 because there's so much that we're into in the world of Pimball. Before I do that though I want to take a step back and just reflect a little bit on where we are in Pimball in 2018 and I have to say overall, overall you can't look at this hobby and not say that we're in a really good place in terms of Pimball and being hobbyist associated with Pimball.

[01:30] There are more manufacturers than ever before making Pimball new in box and selling them to you the customer. So that is a good thing. I know I go back and forth on whether or not what's inside those boxes is incredible or not. That's a different topic for a different day.

[01:48] We have more Pimball content than ever before. So if you're really into Pimball you don't have to always buy a Pimball machine to enjoy Pimball.

[01:58] I remember five years ago if you really wanted to spend your free time listening to Pimball podcast or watching Pimball on YouTube your options were very limited.

[02:10] And I think now we have more and more people out there creating incredible Pimball content for you to enjoy. Some of my favorite are Jack Danger.

[02:19] You cannot deny all the incredible stuff Jack is doing for the hobby straight down the middle and their reviews Greg and Zach over there.

[02:27] My favorite Pimball podcast right now, special when lit, head to head Pimball, slap save is a new one that I'm really enjoying.

[02:35] And we have to give an incredible shout out to Jeff over at this weekend Pimball because I think at of all the Pimball content that has happened in the world.

[02:47] This weekend Pimball has allowed us to absorb the news without absorbing the drama which is why this weekend Pimball is great.

[02:55] It's a great resource for everyone. But every week every month it seems like more and more people are putting on a mic or turning on a camera and creating Pimball content for you.

[03:05] And I think that's that's a good thing. You know this isn't a race to be the best at any of this stuff right.

[03:11] Okay, so that being said what kind of year was it in 2018 and it's interesting because I don't know about you but when I try to remember what actually happened in 2018.

[03:23] Like did that happen in 2017 for example if I asked you when was Pirates of the Caribbean revealed to the world it was October of 2017 not even 2018.

[03:35] And so I had to do a little bit of research in homework because 365 days is not a long time in the world of Pimball especially when most of us are reading about this hobby every single day.

[03:47] But I did my best to make sure that everything we're going to discuss on this podcast happened in 2018.

[03:54] So let's jump right to it. So before I do the list of the top 10 moments I wanted to throw out some honorable mentions.

[04:02] And these are things that have just happened again that have sparked conversation that it becomes somewhat of a hot topic in the world of Pimball.

[04:11] Number one in that list of honorable mentions is Odin hyper user on Pinside takes a break once again not a huge deal but he is one of the personalities that keeps Pinside refreshing and fun for people to go on.

[04:28] And I will say this we have to give an honorable mention to Pinside in general without it most of us would really struggle to have a daily place to go and communicate and connect with people over Pimball.

[04:43] It is the greatest Pimball website forum community of all time. There's no way around it. There's no way around it.

[04:53] There's no Robin and the team over there. You have the best resource for people in Pimball and there's no there's no greater way to sort of articulate that than I think owners club threads when you buy a new Pimball machine and there's something going on with the game.

[05:11] You miss most about Pinside. You go on there and you tell someone hey look my shooter rod isn't working right and within minutes sometimes seconds you will get a response from someone on how to troubleshoot your game.

[05:25] That's incredible. There's like no other hobby where you get the immediate response like you do in Pimball.

[05:32] And I'm going to go to those two everyone who keeps Pinside running on a daily basis.

[05:39] Next on honorable mention Todd Tucky's book deal goes south is one of the funniest threads you could ever read in all of Pimball history.

[05:49] Todd Tucky signed a 10 book deal. First book comes out. It's printed on toilet paper. The publisher and Todd go back and forth.

[05:57] In a way that I couldn't even craft if I tried to make the craziest thread ever just read it.

[06:04] Another honorable mention for the year just another day in Dutch BS neighborhood. So Dutch Pimball really did nothing in 2018.

[06:15] This is not in the top 10 because this has been this way now for a few years. They continue to keep people in the dark on what is going on.

[06:25] The latest news is that Yop is suffering from cancer which sucks but there's no momentum anymore around the big Lebowski.

[06:35] It's a shame I still consider to be one of the greatest Pimball machines I've seen come out in the last five years but nothing is happening.

[06:42] It just seems to be another bad year for those of you who went in on the big Lebowski.

[06:48] Speaking of another bad year but not this is like this this one's been dead for a while.

[06:53] But 2018 was also another year in which there was no real justice served to Kevin Koolik and Skitbee and Predator.

[07:02] Whatever came of the court date and all the court hearings and all the court moments surrounding Kevin Koolik probably nothing will come out of it.

[07:12] Nobody's going to get any money. It's just going to just going to go away.

[07:17] But in 2018 we saw absolutely no updates around Kevin Koolik.

[07:23] This one was going to make the top 10 but I moved it out because I just think that even though this does create a lot of conversation and a lot of controversy I don't think a lot of people care.

[07:35] And I don't think a lot of people are in on this game and I don't think a lot of people even give a shit if this company succeeds or fails.

[07:43] And that is home pin ignoring the Australian pre-order customers and shipping the first Thunderbird games to Canada.

[07:54] And when this happened it was like the biggest kick between the legs that all of these Australian pre-order people who supported Mike all these years received.

[08:07] And most of them still don't have their games as of December 27th 2018.

[08:14] And this has been a five year journey that is again leaving a lot of these Thunderbirds pre-order customers feeling really salty.

[08:24] I think the other thing you could add to this whole thing is that just throughout 2018 it's been an absolute terrible year for the public relations surrounding this company.

[08:34] Mike has time and time again.

[08:36] Continue to be his own worst enemy.

[08:39] Continue to battle customers.

[08:41] Continue to fight people in a very vitriolic way.

[08:46] And he's very cantankerous.

[08:48] And I just don't think you're going to see a lot more coming from this company in the future.

[08:55] And that's going to be part of my 2019 prediction episode but not today.

[08:59] Another honorable mention is Batman 66 code is finally finished after two years.

[09:06] I think we're going to see a lot more stern games getting faster code updates.

[09:12] But the fact that it took two years to get Batman from, you know, its release.

[09:17] I think it was October I want to say 2016 to finally being finished in December of 2018.

[09:25] The journey was painful for those who went in early on the game.

[09:29] But the overall consensus is that lineman has once again created a masterpiece.

[09:34] But that was a big moment this year.

[09:36] When Batman hit 1.0 I think owners really finally felt validated for going in on this title.

[09:44] This is another big moment.

[09:46] No, this is not a big moment.

[09:48] This is an honorable mention, Chris Dick with the program.

[09:51] Just an honorable mention that R2D2 topper is still not out.

[09:55] We know it's been revealed.

[09:57] But wait, why would it take two years to get a topper approved?

[10:01] There's something going on with R2D2.

[10:04] And it's kind of crazy because stern, you remember stern sold the most amount of Ellie's I think ever with Star Wars.

[10:13] The 100 is the largest number of limited edition games stern has ever sold.

[10:19] And all those Ellie guys would probably love to put R2D2 on top of the game.

[10:25] Still not out.

[10:26] I think it's soon.

[10:28] But it's kind of crazy that R2D2 toppers won't be shipping until 2019.

[10:33] Alright, the last thing and this was going to be my top 10 moments.

[10:37] But it's not really like a top 10 moment.

[10:40] We discussed a lot on Pinside.

[10:43] But to me this is one of the most pivotal things happening in the hobby.

[10:48] It's kind of like a wake up call.

[10:51] It's sort of like a reality check.

[10:53] And if I were to look at 2018 and you asked me like,

[10:55] well what's something that you think kind of defined the direction this hobby is going in.

[11:01] And something that was just a really important thing that happened.

[11:04] That is just indicative of where we are in Pimble.

[11:08] And that is that dialed in.

[11:11] It won the most Twippy Awards in 2017.

[11:15] At the end of 2017 everybody praised dialed in.

[11:20] And yet throughout 2018 dialed in at the end of Jersey Jack telling up its sales.

[11:28] Dialed in will go down as being Jersey Jack's worst selling game.

[11:34] And I think that's a significant moment in 2018.

[11:37] I think it's an honorable mention moment because I think what that indicates.

[11:41] And you could argue that Jack sort of destroyed the sales of dialed in by showing pirates of the Caribbean.

[11:46] So early and I wouldn't argue against you if you said that.

[11:49] But I think what it indicates is that overall in Pimble is that theme is really important.

[11:56] And how you launch a game is really important.

[11:59] And making sure you give people something simple and easy enough to understand is important in getting people.

[12:06] To be attracted to your Pimble offering.

[12:11] And I think dialed in is just a good example of something that was such a...

[12:18] It was such a Pimble experiment with Pat Lawler five years.

[12:22] The best designer blank check.

[12:25] But then it didn't sell.

[12:27] And I think that lack of sales is really going to impact what other companies do and their strategies.

[12:34] As they think about how much you need to put into a game to make it successful.

[12:39] As Pimble companies really are fighting to stay viable and above water as we go into 2019.

[12:47] Alright, drum roll please.

[12:49] These are Canadian's top 10 moments of 2018.

[12:53] And again, remember what I said.

[12:55] These are moments that you talked a lot about.

[12:58] These are moments that you discussed.

[12:59] I want to go down the list now.

[13:01] And I think I arranged these in order of least impactful to most impactful.

[13:07] Or most significant.

[13:09] And again, maybe I didn't.

[13:11] But these are all moments that I think took over the Pimble hobby in 2018.

[13:16] Are you ready?

[13:17] Number 10.

[13:18] Deeproot Pimble.

[13:20] And 2018 was an interesting year for Deeproot Pimble because they said a whole lot of stuff and delivered on absolutely nothing.

[13:29] And I was probably most shocked by Deeproot Pimble's appearance at Chicago Pimble Expo in which they made probably some of the most ridiculous claims you can possibly make about making more games than any other manufacturer ever in a single year.

[13:45] Having five titles, having this, having that.

[13:49] All of it added up to absolutely nothing.

[13:52] And now we have news that they are not going to be a T.P.F. in March to show us the five days of Deeproot.

[14:00] Now, this is interesting because it just goes to show that you can take over a lot of the Pimble conversation with by doing almost absolutely nothing.

[14:12] Other than communicating what your plans are, you will get people on board.

[14:17] Now, do I think Deeproot Pimble is smoking mirrors and going to fail horribly and all the stuff that people might be speculating?

[14:25] I don't.

[14:27] I think they have a team.

[14:28] I think they have a plan in place.

[14:30] I do think their challenge is going to be all the money they are spending to get to day one of putting a game in a box.

[14:38] How are they going to make up all that money spent?

[14:40] And we know that Robert is using investor dollars to get Deeproot Pimble off the ground.

[14:46] But every day they go in there, everyone is getting paid.

[14:49] Every day they go in there, money is going out the door, but no money is coming in.

[14:55] How do you make up for that?

[14:57] And I also think they are probably trying to do too much at once.

[15:00] You don't need to release five to seven games a year.

[15:03] I also, if you listen to my latest podcast with CEO Dave, I don't think you are going to win trying to go out at Stern.

[15:11] I don't think you are going to win trying to go at Stern prices.

[15:13] I don't think you are going to win trying to go at Stern volume.

[15:16] I am not necessarily sure.

[15:18] Deeproot has identified what their position within the Pimble marketplace will be.

[15:24] You just can't be like, we are going to make better Pimble and then we are going to be successful.

[15:27] That is the mentality that has sunk every other new to the game manufacturer.

[15:32] Because they are trying to beat Stern at Stern's game and you just can't do it because there is no way Deeproot will ever figure out manufacturing at the level Stern has.

[15:43] And I don't mean that with any disrespect, but I just wouldn't become a company trying to compete with Stern on volume and price.

[15:51] I think that is a surefire way to disaster.

[15:54] Number nine moment in 2018 was the Monster Bash remake launch.

[16:01] Their launch strategy was somewhat scarier than the theme itself.

[16:06] This title was rumored to be the next title.

[16:09] Remember, most of 2018, we had absolutely zero confirmation about Monster Bash remake.

[16:16] It was supposed to be at Texas Pimble Festival in March in 2018 and they announced they weren't going to be there.

[16:24] We waited and waited and waited and waited and then finally they just put up a Facebook announcement sometime in the summer being like, you guessed it.

[16:34] Our next game is Monster Bash and it was sort of like a really pissed poor way to get people excited about the title.

[16:43] Now you could argue that they don't have to get people too excited because it's already a game that's been around for 20 plus years that people have played and love.

[16:51] And so it did become a big moment because we finally got confirmation that Monster Bash remake was coming out.

[16:59] We finally saw the game at Expo. The feedback was great, but I'll say this.

[17:05] The other moment with this game in 2018 is the lack of limited edition games that have shipped to customers who have paid for the game now since November.

[17:15] I know that doesn't seem like a long time, but when you go into the Monster Bash remake thread, I think you're just reading a lot of frustrated buyers right now.

[17:24] A lot of people expected to get these games faster.

[17:28] And I'm not sure if that's unrealistic expectations, but I think a lot of distributors promise consumers their games quicker than they got them.

[17:38] And I think a lot of distributors were asking people to pay and fall and then now people are like, wait a minute, where's my game?

[17:44] And let's also be honest that when you buy a game in November, you really want it before Christmas.

[17:52] There's something about getting your game before Christmas or during the holidays that is on everyone's wish list because you have friends and family coming over and you want to open up your new toy.

[18:02] And so when that doesn't happen, I think that rubs people the wrong way.

[18:06] All right, number eight in the top 10 moments of 2018 was the Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle reveal.

[18:13] Again, we're going back in time. We're going back to March of 2018 and Charlie revealed this game at T.P.F. and I have to say, it was a little bit of like a mixed bag reveal.

[18:25] I think he revealed his best looking pin two day by far.

[18:29] I think when you stand over Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and you put it next to the other spooky pinball games, we are definitely seeing progress occur.

[18:39] The company keeps making each game better than the game before.

[18:43] And I think there was a lot of excitement when he pulled the curtain off the game. I think the reveal itself was very lukewarm.

[18:49] But what is really to find the conversation around Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle in 2018 and the reason it's on the top 10 list is more about the delay of this game.

[19:01] Where is it?

[19:03] We are at the end of the year. That was almost 11 months ago that Chuck revealed the game, maybe 10 months ago that Chuck revealed the game.

[19:13] And we still don't have consumers getting the game. Now he's got to make 500 of these.

[19:19] And so I think the weight for this game has really defined the conversation this year.

[19:25] And more and more people are getting anxious and impatient and you can't blame them.

[19:31] You can't blame them. And the reason why you can't blame them is Charlie asked for non-refundable deposits on the game.

[19:39] And it's hard to do that when you haven't played the game, when you haven't seen good video footage of the game.

[19:46] And you're sort of just going in on basically visuals alone.

[19:52] And as we know in Pimball, I think games looking sexy is sort of becoming par for the course.

[20:00] So really ashamed that Charlie wasn't able to get games in boxes and out to consumers in a shorter window.

[20:10] And again, we talk a lot about this, but you really have to get customers their games within two months of revealing your product.

[20:18] Or you're going to create an environment where all hype is gone. And also as we see in Pimball with so much coming out,

[20:25] we don't really continue to get excited about games that we saw like a year ago or 11 months ago.

[20:31] We're very much on to the next, on to the next. I think Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle was revealed too soon.

[20:38] And the weight and the delay has really become the predominant conversation around that title right now.

[20:44] Number six, I will say, or sorry, number seven on the Canadian's top ten, is October Fest has a monkey problem.

[20:54] And this is another, you know, just as we think about, again, the conversations that were born out of different moments throughout the year,

[21:04] we all knew that October Fest was a rumored title. We got confirmation that October Fest was going to be American Pimball's latest title at Chicago Expo in October.

[21:16] October and October Fest, finally the worlds of marketing have synchronized.

[21:22] But if you think about the conversation coming out of that reveal, really, really controversial stuff around probably one of the stupidest things ever,

[21:35] the simple fact that there was a monkey on the back glass that had his hands on two girls' buttocks without their consent apparently.

[21:45] And it really opened up Pandora's box in this politically correct Me Too culture. How could they do that? That's completely creepy and insensitive.

[21:54] And it created this entire debate around the game that I know they didn't want. It wasn't a good discussion happening.

[22:04] They are going to correct that issue. So it's going to be a non-issue.

[22:08] But I think the overall moment around this game in 2018 was we have a new American Pimball game. It looks really interesting.

[22:18] But I think the monkey is just indicative of a bigger issue that became the conversation with this game. And that was just what is going on with the artwork on this game.

[22:29] Like who is creatively directing this game? And I think in 2018, if you come out with your game review and the conversation around artwork is anything other than it looks freaking amazing, I wouldn't change a thing, you've sort of fucked up big time.

[22:50] Because there's no room anymore. There's no room with where the caliber of artwork is in Pimball to release an art package that just looks so mediocre.

[23:00] Now I know for a fact that American Pimball is trying to like figure out a solve here. I know they've reached out to some other Pimball artists that you are familiar with. That has done some work in other Pimball games that you're aware of to kind of create a solution here.

[23:17] But for 2018, I think the big moment is October Fest, a title that a lot of us hoped wouldn't be the title was confirmed. And the game came out and it looked just, it looked like it wasn't up to the same standard we're seeing from other manufacturers. In terms of art, I think they were putting a lot into the game mechanically.

[23:40] I think it has a lot more interesting stuff going on in layout and in toys. But American Pimball continues to just be, you know, I think they're struggling to figure out how to give you everything you want in a Pimball experience.

[23:53] Now the caveat being the games are $7,500. So give them a break too. They're not charging you nearly as much as some other Pimball companies are further offerings.

[24:04] So we look forward to seeing what the final version of the game is. But every month they get further from October. The more and more the game becomes a harder thing to sell because of the seasonality of the theme.

[24:17] All right. Number six on the top 10 moments of 2018, Monsters leaks. So Monsters is probably the worst kept secret in Pimball history.

[24:28] We all know that Monsters is coming out. We've known for months and months and months. We've known probably since the beginning of last year that Stern had the Monsters license.

[24:40] But we then started to see some leaked images that just confirmed it. And nothing, nothing huge. We saw some cabinet art.

[24:48] But most recently we saw more leaks of the Playfield art and looked like they were grabbed off a computer screen. But the Monsters leaks have created a year long of Monsters speculation.

[25:02] And it's interesting that that speculation continues because we pretty much now have seen what the entire Playfield is. Now look, it doesn't take a genius to sort of imagine what we've seen and just put a lower Playfield in there.

[25:17] And maybe a bash toy here or there. But that's what the Monsters is going to look like. It's going to look a lot like Monster Bash. The remakes of Monster Bash, sorry, the remake. It's the layout of Monster Bash. And the Monsters is very similar.

[25:31] The artwork of course looks great. Christopher Frenchie always knocks it out of the park with his art packages. But the Monsters leaks was really interesting because it also was a big moment in 2018.

[25:43] Because Stern didn't give us three cornerstone titles in 2018. They missed that window. And it's interesting because they get really promised us that. But we really only got Iron Maiden.

[25:58] These were the titles in 2018. Iron Maiden, Deadpool, Beatles and Primus. Right. So where are the cornerstones? Is Deadpool and Iron Maiden? And then it was supposed to be Monsters.

[26:11] So we didn't get Monsters in 2018. But here's what I think is going to happen. And I might be wrong. I might be right. But I think Stern is going to reveal the Monsters on New Year's Eve. Mark my words. I think they're going to do that. I think it's going to be a New Year's sort of special.

[26:32] I think they're going to do it so they can say they did deliver and reveal three cornerstone titles in one year. That is Canadian prediction. Now I know Zach listens to this show. And he's probably like, fuck Chris once again said something. And now we can't do it because now it's going to look like we listen to him. Nope. Nope. I just think it'd be smart to do it on New Year's Eve because it keeps you true to your word. And it's also on the line already. So we know it's coming out. So the Monsters leaks was a big moment in 2020.

[27:01] 2018. All right. Number five on my list is it was the year of the Yeti. It was the year of zombie Yeti. We got back to back titles. We got we got iron made in legacy of the beast. And we got Deadpool back to back.

[27:20] Which was really really like an awesome thing. You know, zombie Yeti his artwork is some of the best we've ever seen in Pimball. It's always very detailed. It's always very incredible. He's he's a very passionate personality in the Pimball hobby. And I will say it's the year of the Yeti too.

[27:38] Not just because he gave us two phenomenal looking games. He also like was very outspoken this year in Pimball. And it's like he's completely burnt out. And look, I forgot to mention two primus Pimball three titles from zombie Yeti in one year.

[27:55] So he's been breaking his back, making these Pimball games happen behind the scenes. And I think it broke him. I think it broke him. And I think that's one of the top 10 moments of 2018 is that zombie Yeti is burnt out and wants to take time off. And we might not see a zombie Yeti title in 2019. And I think that's that was definitely an interesting moment because within the year of the Yeti, I do want to say that you have to put within one of the top 10 moments iron made in Pimball.

[28:25] And I think within that Keith Owens design and getting something refreshingly new from a design layout for Stern was just a huge moment. And I don't mean to sort of minimize the impact of Keith's design on the hobby this year because it truly was a great year for Stern and the fact that they took a title like archer.

[28:50] They worked with Keith Owens to sort of redo it within the world of iron made in a re-skin it. Sorry because it wasn't fully redone. But it was exciting year. And I think for those of you out there, I think Iron Maiden was a game that a lot of tournament players appreciated because it shot so differently.

[29:13] The scoring balance is great. I will say this, it's the end of the year and I've been in the iron made in threads a lot recently. I think people are having a lot of trouble getting that game dialed in. I think there's a lot of mechanical issues that are going on with the game that have to work properly for the game to be satisfying.

[29:35] And what is the long term quality control assessment of a game like Iron Maiden? I'm not going to go down that road right now. But it does seem like owners are having a little bit of a problem with this game and getting everything to work properly.

[29:51] Which is a shame because I want Stern to take more chances and do more innovative things. And I feel like if they go down a different road of what they've been doing lately and there's issues, they might want to go back to playing it safe. And I don't want Stern to play safe with their designs.

[30:09] All right, number four, sticking in the world of Stern, number four on my list of top 10 moments of 2018, Beatles and Supreme Pimball both sent the Pimball enthusiast world into a tailspin.

[30:25] I don't think I've ever seen more people but hurt than when Beatles Pimball was revealed. It was a moment that has been dominating conversation for the last few months for a few reasons, right?

[30:39] One, it's Beatles. It's one of the biggest themes of all time. So you've got the camp of people who really feel that Beatles deserved a completely new game. It should not have been a reskin to see which.

[30:52] Then you've got the, it looks good. It looks good. And like I get what they were going for. They were going for a classic game that looked like it came from 1964. I get all of that. I get it all. But then you get the price. No game brought out the price police. And we know who they are because you know who they are. They're all of you. We all are in, you know, we are deputized price police members. Every one of you, if you love Pimball, you can't help.

[31:21] But at any point, look at a game and say if you think it's worth it or not. And you want to give your opinion about whether it's worth it or not. And you're not like most, you know, you don't, you don't behave the way Stern would want you to behave, which is, hey, if it's fun, then it's worth it.

[31:36] No, that's not the way we think. We're actually adults with brains that function. And we don't just say fun equals value in Pimball. All right. So the price police came out and they came out in droves around this title because it was like this like it was almost like an atom bomb went off inside the Pimball world when they announced that the Beatles gold would be 8,000.

[32:03] The platinum and diamond editions wouldn't be priced at all. Now here's, that's the thing. There, there is no official price on those two higher end versions that that's out there. It was up to distributors to set the price. And we know what happened.

[32:23] Distributors were setting the diamond edition between 25 and 30,000 dollars in sanity ensued debate raged on people were calling people morons and idiots for if they were going to pay that. How could you charge that much? It's just a little placard on the apron. There's actually nothing different in the game. And I agree with all that.

[32:49] I think this the diamond and platinum editions were total cash grabs, but they're not really cash grabs if you think about it, but they're total. They're totally designed to fleece the obsessive Beatles collector into buying this game because no Pimball collectors actually going to go in on those super expensive versions because they know too well.

[33:11] The story of magic girl, the story of like rare games for rare's sake that aren't actually different or even like, you know, that's the thing with Beatles is no one's ever the diamond edition will had nothing but south. If you paid 25,000 dollars for a diamond edition, no one's going to be like, oh my god, I really got to have a diamond is because you know why because they can have the same exact experience in a gold edition.

[33:35] If there were different songs, different mechs, different layout, something that made the experience different, it could have somewhat justified an increase in price. But if you buy one, people will look at you like you're a dope and they won't really care to get it.

[33:53] And I think it's just going to be those kinds of games, right? Now that being said, I don't blame Stern at all. I don't blame Joe Kamikaw. I think what Stern did was was fine. Ultimately, it's up to you.

[34:03] If you don't want to buy it, don't buy it. And remember, Stern never set that high price. The distributors did. So blame the distributors. This was a gift from Stern to the distributors to make them some extra money because they've watched consumers like me flip their games and no one sees an extra penny, not the distributors, not Stern.

[34:24] You know who sees it, the flipper. And this game was designed to basically allow the distributors to act like a flipper, make a big profit, and also ultimately to hoodwink you from thinking the gold edition is worth $8,000 because it seems like a bargain.

[34:41] Now, Supreme Pimbal on the other hand, completely different contract manufactured by Supreme with Stern in partnership to create a Supreme version of Pimbal. And we all know, if you don't know the world of Supreme, that's okay.

[34:56] The world of Supreme collecting and Pimbal hobbyists, their worlds apart, their universes apart. But Supreme is more popular in mainstream society than Stern Pimbal.

[35:07] And if you don't understand that, then you don't understand where culture is at and where society is at. Supreme Pimbal is a juggernaut in the world of fashion.

[35:20] And it's just the way it is. Like you could argue that point, but Supreme has more fans than Stern Pimbal. And it's, I think it goes without saying that when Supreme put up a video of their Pimbal machine, they got 2 million views.

[35:35] If Stern Pimbal put up a Pimbal video, it would get like 2,000 views. So just do the math. Okay. Now look, Supreme Pimbal also was never like for sale.

[35:46] It was made. It was sold through Supreme's network to Supreme collectors. I believe at the price of $10,000. I'm not sure how people like Ed Robertson and Sunshine Laundromack got them.

[36:00] I could take a guess that's probably not too wild that they buy so many Stern machines that Stern just hooked them up with a game that's really valuable and collectible. And that's cool. I'm no problem with that.

[36:11] There's something called loyalty and taking care of your loyal customers that is the reality of business. And I think that's how it should be.

[36:19] But Supreme Pimbal really made a lot of people angry. It was a re-skin of the Spider-Man, you know, the simple Spider-Man game. And why is Stern selling out to this like, you know, fashion entity that's, you know, millennials and crazy rich Asians are into. And this does nothing to do with Pimbal. And it's a terrible Pimbal experience. And once again, I think the diehard Pimbal community failed to understand what this game was all about.

[36:47] And I think it also speaks to a larger issue that we see crop up every now and again, which is that the Pimbal enthusiasts, the people on Pinside, they think they're entitled for every single Pimbal game to be made for them.

[37:01] That they own this hobby that every single game has to appeal to them or else it's a piece of shit or else it's not going to sell or else they're going to kick and scream about it.

[37:10] And it's kind of ironic because these are the same people that want to see Pimbal expand, that want to see Pimbal attract a new audience, that want to see, you know, more people out in the world understand that Pimbal is still alive and kicking. And Supreme Pimbal does that.

[37:28] It did that more than any other sort of Pimbal release, simply because what, like there's new Pimbal machines, oh, there's Supreme Pimbal machine. I'll tell you this. I have friends out there in the world who don't follow Pimbal.

[37:40] And they know that I do a Pimbal podcast and they are into Supreme. And literally the only time they've ever shared anything Pimbal related with me is when Supreme Pimbal came out and they would send me a link and say, oh my god, this is so cool.

[37:54] Can you help me get one? And I'm like, yeah, get out your checkbook for like $40,000. So anyway, that was a huge moment.

[38:01] Number three on my top 10 moment. And this was a big one. This was a big one. This is one we called for a long time.

[38:10] But we finally got confirmation and this might surprise you that this actually happened in 2018 because this is one of those stories where I'm never quite sure what year did what happened in because it dragged on for so many years.

[38:22] But in 2018, Highway Pimbal folded its doors or closed its doors for good. The new investors that came out, Team Highway, they finally said it's over. We're done. We're liquidating the company. We're filing for bankruptcy.

[38:40] And everyone who was waiting for their alien Pimbal machine received the bad news. And look, this is a huge moment.

[38:49] The collapse of Highway Pimbal was something that was like a slow motion train wreck. And the writing had been on the wall for a really long time. And we've covered this multiple times on this show. You know the story.

[39:03] But I think there was a huge moment in 2018. It showed that no Pimbal company is going to survive. Even if they have a great theme, unless they do the right thing from a big moment.

[39:18] You have to figure out how to structure your company properly. You have to learn how to manufacture. You have to learn how to get your vendors in place. There's a lot that making Pimbal is really hard.

[39:34] And Highway Pimbal on the surface always tried to convince us that everything was okay and we knew it wasn't. And even when Andrew was gone and these new people took over, there was a lot of hope that they were going to figure it out.

[39:47] Because they did get some of those alien machines out the door. But ultimately, they were handed a sinking ship. It was still taking on too much water. And they were losing, I would say, six to seven figures annually, just trying to figure out how to get these games out the door. And they called it quits.

[40:05] Now, what is the future hold for the individuals who started this company? I don't know. I don't know, but maybe we'll talk about them in our 2019 prediction show.

[40:14] At the number two moment, top 10 moment in 2018 is this Jersey Jack Pimbal removes the spinning discs and treasure chest from opening and closing from Pirates of the Caribbean. Now again, remember, these are the moments that sparked the conversation.

[40:33] These are the moments that got people like engage and riled up. And this was a huge moment. This was a huge moment because 2018 was a year in which people were expecting to get Pirates of the Caribbean sort of in Q1.

[40:48] I mean, Jack promised this game in Q1 of 2018. He revealed it in Q4 of 2017 month after month went by. And then everyone got what we all could agree was the bad news that they couldn't figure out how to make two of the features in the game function properly that they were going to be removed from the game.

[41:12] And we all remember the video Eric posted a video, real somber videos like it was on it was on a like a Friday afternoon like a good time to deliver bad news.

[41:21] And I think what was hard with this one with Jersey Jack is that these features were really the focal point of the game when they revealed it and they launched it to the world.

[41:32] And so here we were months later and now stuff was being yanked out of the game. And I think what this did to the game is still impacting the sales of this game today.

[41:44] And here we are. We're December 27th. The game is finally getting to consumers. I mean, it literally just started shipping a few weeks ago.

[41:53] And I've covered it. I've been reading the threads. I hear everything from the game's biggest masterpiece of all time. It's the greatest Jersey Jack game ever.

[42:03] All the way to there's a lot of issues with the game in terms of breaking down on people, broken wires, this and that. And you know, like it's really hard with any new game like this to know where the truth lies.

[42:17] And because the reality in this whole hobby is pinball truth only lies within if you love it, you love it. If you don't, you don't.

[42:27] There's no one man's opinion that is that should be taken as fact. Right. I can't tell you something about this game. And then that's exactly what that game is. You might absolutely love it.

[42:39] You know how I feel about the game. I'm not going to rehash some of the stuff I feel about the game. I'm happy people are finally getting them.

[42:46] But I do think the biggest moment in Jersey Jack's year was that removal because we know that orders were canceled.

[42:54] We know that excitement for the game and hype for the game started to dissipate. And I don't say the delay goes along with that.

[43:02] You know, this was a year where Jersey Jack completely fumbled another launch. And then this again, this is not a personal attack.

[43:11] This is not an opinion. They fumbled the delay of the game. They literally made people wait. If you think about it, this game really isn't shipping in high volume yet.

[43:23] And it's over a year since it was revealed. And that is that was the big moment of 2018 for Jersey Jack, the delay of the game and the two features coming out.

[43:35] All right. Number one moment of 2018 and I wanted to end on a positive high note because some of this stuff goes back and forth.

[43:43] I think the number one moment of 2018 for me, the moment that just like said, you know what? Like this is awesome.

[43:50] This is really an accomplishment. This should be celebrated. And that is that total nuclear annihilation has sold 550 units, making it the best selling spooky game of all time, making it a game that went from someone's basement onto an assembly line into people's homes.

[44:11] It is one of the games where I hear the most positive feedback around. It was a different approach to pinball. It's not a complex game. It's not a confusing game. It's not an over, it's not a game that's relying overly on like, you know, an art package.

[44:29] It's just cool pinball and people spoke and people wanted it. And I think this game represents what I would like to see. There be more of pinball, which is just a different take on pinball.

[44:45] You know, and look, Scott will be the first one to tell you. He's not trying to take down Stern. He's not trying to compete with themes like Batman and Star Wars. He just wanted to make a really cool pinball machine. And he succeeded in that.

[44:57] And I think to me, that was the number one moment in terms of 2018 because I think it's a moment that everyone feels good about. I think it's a moment that everyone can understand why that game is the way it is.

[45:10] I remember standing in front of the whitewood. It was like one of the coolest light shows in music, musical experiences ever in a pinball game. And it's like, wait, this guy like coated this in his basement, he wrote the music himself. It was like a one man band kind of game. And that's really cool. And he made the game with parts that he could get from pinball life. It wasn't like he was trying to do too much.

[45:33] And pinball used to be something you could step up to. And in 30 seconds to a minute, enjoy. And if there was one wish I could put out into the world, being that it's the holidays, is that we get back to more of that.

[45:51] Pinball should be immediately fun. I've heard people like criticize me. He's so negative on pirates, the Caribbean because he's so lazy. He doesn't want to take the time to have to fit. You shouldn't have to take a large amount of time to figure out how to have fun with pinball machine.

[46:07] When do we get to this world where like to have fun with the pinball machine, you need a manual before you can start having fun. That's not how it should be. And I think that's why games like the Beatles, games like TNA, they're fun for people. They're very fun for people.

[46:23] You know, I want to leave you on this note. There's two movies you should go see. Incredible. I was thinking about pinball when I was thinking about these movies. And why I love them so much.

[46:32] But Bumblebee and Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse are two of the most amazing films I've seen all year. If not probably the greatest superhero movie and definitely the greatest Transformer movie I've ever seen since the animated film back in the day with Orson Wells in 1987.

[46:49] The reason why they're so much fun is basically they're both very simple stories that you care about, that you enjoy, that engage you immediately. You're right in it. They're not complex. They're not trying to do too much. They're not trying to save like the entire galactic world from like Infinity Stones. It's not this over like over reaching thing. It's just God damn good time. God damn fun.

[47:18] Look, and maybe Pirates gets there for you and if it is great, you know, I just think that pinball and the experience of playing pinball and the reason why people love pinball from the 90s is you can walk up to a machine and immediately find something to have fun and engage with.

[47:35] Really, you can bash the genie, you could hit the treasure chest, you could like do this, do that, like all the great games, you could hit the castle, medieval madness and hit it a few times and all of a sudden like the job bridge goes, you know, and it collapses. That's what pinball needs. That a dummy can walk up to it and absolutely know what to do and shoot for and have an amazing time. And that's my criticism.

[47:57] You know, of where we are with pinball nowadays, you walk up to the machines and there's nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And so why can't we have the best of both worlds where we have those elements in the game and also have, you know, stuff for people that want to go deeper.

[48:15] And that's where pinball magic lies. Right? All right, everyone. That was my top 10 list. I would love to hear if you think I missed anything or if you agree with anything at canadapinballgmail.com.

[48:26] I will be back with more CEO Dave assessments. I will also be back. I'm going to try and get a guess to do my 2019 predictions, which is coming up. And I have to say this. I do think that the trippy awards being in March is too late. It's just too late, Jeff. Why in March?

[48:47] Like literally the best, the best of everything from 2018 is going to be, it's going to take place three months after the years over. It's too late. You should have done it now. Now's always the fun time to award the best of the year. I'm just saying from a marketing standpoint, you kind of messed up. Everyone have a great day.

[49:47] You
