[00:00] I heard Andrew Highway, Barian Yop, rented out a pen out of the apartment and are all singing this song right now.

[00:08] If they could turn back Pimbal Time, they probably wouldn't fuck up the boutique Pimbal Javi and make all those people lose all that money.

[00:23] We're gonna talk about that on episode 242 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast. Let's go!

[00:30] It is over. Let me repeat that. It is over. Dutch Pimbal is done. Alright, I'm still reading in the thread.

[00:45] People who have money invested trying to figure out a scenario in which Dutch Pimbal will actually recover from this latest bit of news and get them their Pimbal machine.

[00:56] Let me just say, I'm saddened to say this. You're not getting your big Lebowski machine. It's not going to happen.

[01:04] And we've been saying this and we predicted it last year. I'm not even gloating. It sucks, but we said that in 2018, Highway Pimbal and Dutch Pimbal would collapse and be no more.

[01:17] And here we are. Exactly as we predicted. I want to read to you the correspondence from Dutch Pimbal that went out to people.

[01:28] I think it was last night that finally has people realizing that this is the end. That you know what? It's over.

[01:37] It is game set match and big Lebowski Pimbal will not be getting to people. Alright, here we go. It says, and this is from Dutch Pimbal.

[01:48] We are reaching out with the kind of news we desperately never want it to do. Just know we are continuing to do all that we can to rectify this situation.

[01:59] Unfortunately, we find ourselves at a critical point in time. We have been subpoenaed by our former contract manufacturer, ARA. And as a result, we have put in a counter claim.

[02:13] Given the seriousness of this, we are not able to provide any details about this process until it goes to the courts for their findings and decision.

[02:25] What started out as a dream of creating wonderful Pimbal machines has become an ongoing and terrible nightmare.

[02:33] We deeply and sincerely wish we had better news to share, especially for all of you who have been so supportive of us over these past few years.

[02:44] We honestly have tried everything we could to give this project a positive outcome. But with the pending lawsuit, we have to put everything on hold.

[02:54] This does mean that production by ZerTech or ZerTech has to be postponed until further notice.

[03:03] The only thing we ever wanted is to build a beautiful game for you and many other people to enjoy.

[03:09] Our dream has been shattered by forces we could not control. We are heartbroken about this but have not given up hope that all will be resolved and games will get built and shipped.

[03:23] But the question of when this might happen is still unknown. Be assured that as soon as we have any news we can share, we will send in update all our very best Dutch Pimbal.

[03:35] Alright, here's my thing. I'm just going to say this. I think it's what everyone just is thinking Dutch Pimbal, barrianyop, just say once and for all, it's over.

[03:50] You cannot now find the money to engage in a legal lawsuit and also still have money to make people's big Lebowski's.

[04:02] What annoys me about this entire communication chain from these gentlemen is very simply, first off, we don't hear anywhere in here. I'm sorry.

[04:14] We're sorry we lost your money. We're sorry we took your deposit of $8,500 years ago and did not get you a machine. Where is the apology? It's all about how it's a nightmare for them.

[04:29] And the line that they weren't able to get you your game because of forces outside their control.

[04:38] Everything that has happened with this company has been their decision. They decided to partner with the R.A. They decided not to figure out a solution with the R.A.

[04:51] And go on a two year sort of you know, boondoggle trying to figure out a new way to manufacture the game. Here's what I don't understand. This is what they've never communicated.

[05:03] How much money per game did A.R.A. want you to pay? How much money? And why didn't you give the people who invested in your company in opportunity to decide whether or not they were okay with the price increase that A.R.A. put on your desk?

[05:26] Why was that never communicated? Why do we always have to just take their word for it that they are in the right and A.R.A. is in the wrong? I just don't buy it.

[05:39] I have never bought it from way back when they lied to us that it was a board supply issue when it really wasn't. I don't believe it today.

[05:47] None of these forces were outside their control. All the decisions that were made by this company were made by them. Do you see the similarities?

[05:58] The same similarities between Barry and Yop and Andrew Highway and how these gentlemen who take people's money and run the company into a position where people are losing their money and not getting their games.

[06:11] It's always someone else's fault. There's always someone else to blame. It's rubber ducks and it's canada that led people to ask for refunds which is why Highway Pinball collapsed.

[06:21] It's A.R.A. and the fact that they raised the prices on manufacturing. That's the reason why you didn't get your game. Never, never do these men ever take responsibility or accountability for the collapse of their ventures.

[06:35] I think you're tired of it too. I'll never forget the cab ride I shared with George Gomez. It was Texas Pinball Festival and 2016. We were sharing a taxi to the airport and we were talking Pinball.

[06:55] George and I were probably on a bit better terms. I think this is even right before the beginning of the podcast. He said to me, Chris, Dutch Pinball is going to fail because they are trying to contract manufacture Pinball machines.

[07:09] By doing that, they are going to realize that they are going to be at the mercy of a contract manufacturer and it never works out because making Pinball is a lot harder than people think.

[07:21] You run into issues all throughout the manufacturing of a Pinball machine that will just destroy their ability to succeed if they use a contract manufacturer and don't know how to do the manufacturing themselves or have control over it.

[07:35] Here we are two years later and George Gomez was right. All that F-Sturn and F-That, who's laughing now? I remember people were making fun of Gary Stern looking at the Big Lebowski and they were saying stuff like, well, there's the look of a man who realizes he's about to lose a lot of money to a competitor.

[07:55] How stupid do remarks like that sound now? But what I really can't stand is that these gentlemen still refuse to just call it a day. They still have to manufacture this arbitrary and illusion of hope.

[08:18] This illusion of hope, I love this, look at this. When they say we are heartbroken about this but have not given up hope that all will be resolved and games will get built.

[08:29] So right there, once again, it's like, stop it, bury, stop it, stop it, just for once in your lives just admit that you don't have the money and the necessary resources to get this thing done.

[08:48] I know it sucks but you know what sucks even more is constantly filling the heads of your victims with more hope. You know, it's kind of like, you know, kid who gets kidnapped and you keep telling the parents, well, we still hope we'll find them and it's like years go by and all the statistics point to when that much time goes by, the chances are the outcomes not going to be good.

[09:13] And the same thing is true of Pimball, the more years that go on without a real manufacturing process in place, the more likelihood is that your money is gone.

[09:25] You're not getting your big Lebowski and I really want to say to everyone out there who believed in this game and I still believe that the big Lebowski is a wonderful game.

[09:35] But I think that everyone just needs to accept that it's not happening and I'm reading Pinside and I think it's hard, it's a hard pill for people to swallow, they still don't want to just admit it's over, it's done.

[09:52] And that's it, that is it. I mean, do you really think they're going to be able to fight a lawsuit with money? So where's that money come from? You know how much lawyers cost? So how are they going to afford to fight this lawsuit?

[10:07] How are they going to afford to do that and do the production in China? And now the fact that the Chinese production is on hold, that's a whole nother thing let's discuss for a second.

[10:18] So you're this company's iTech or whatever they're called right and they come to you and you're going to you're going to make a pinball machine for the first time and you're spending all this effort to remanufacture a game to train your staff how to make a pinball machine right and I think we've got to like a couple prototypes that they sent out to different shows and to coin taker.

[10:40] And now you're being told by them, hey guys, a little problem here, we now have a lawsuit and we can't do what we were going to do and we need you to stop any any work on this and just halt it.

[10:54] So what do you think those guys are going to do? You think they're going to like want to just pick up the second bearing knob, call them again? No, and you have to wonder what kind of deal was inked with that company to actually get them to even do any work on this?

[11:09] They must have been promised royalties on future games sold and not been paid a lot of money up front but whatever they were promised and whatever money changed hands we all know one thing that there is no money anymore to be distributed.

[11:29] How can they have still have any capital? All right, it has to be at the end and I heard Yop is taking this really hard. I mean this is his dream crushed and this is what must be going on in his head right about now.

[11:42] What a fucking lawyer man. I want Bill, a counselor man or a wrong could be.

[11:52] And the a or a lawyer, this is what he must be thinking. It's bush leek, psycho stuff laughable man. I would have fucked you in the ass Saturday.

[12:04] I'll fuck you in the ass the next Wednesday instead. You got a day Wednesday.

[12:11] But all joking aside, the whole thing sucks and it sucks for a lot of reasons. It sucks for Chris and Melissa coin taker who invested in highway pinball in Zidware and in Dutch pinball and they've got burned.

[12:31] It sucks for all the people out there who've worked really hard and wanted to support these companies from the very advent of these organizations.

[12:40] And I think that's the part that really blows is that so many people all they wanted to do was show their support for pinball by investing in new pinball ventures.

[12:52] And when we look at the amount of ventures that have succeeded versus the ones that have failed the failures now are far out weighing the successes.

[13:03] And we've all learned our lesson or have we right. I don't know. I also think it's unfortunate because right now there are people who are working really hard to build a new pinball machine and a new pinball experience.

[13:18] And now you can it's really hard to ask people to invest in a pinball venture because of all these failures.

[13:26] Remember they've made it hard now for anyone that wants to come out and does need some pre-order money to get their company off the ground because of what these companies have done.

[13:39] They put the fear of God and everybody that pre-order equals lost money and that's not always the case.

[13:46] I think the reality is that if you want to sell pinball machines and you want to start a company, a brand new pinball company, you have to start really small.

[13:56] And you can't let someone else do the hard work, you can't hire a contract manufacturer, you can't show the game before it's ready to ship.

[14:04] And that was the other part. When you remember what Dutch pinball did is they showed you the prototype of the Big Lebowski, they took money on it and then they went and used a lot of that money to re-engineer the game.

[14:16] And the problem is is when you don't have capital and you don't have additional money coming in from investors that are not your buyers but capital you've raised, then that money is now spent and it wasn't spent on the parts needed to make the person's money.

[14:33] And the money is then gone and then you're in a hole and then you can't get new money to build the old games.

[14:40] I really feel bad for all the people involved and it's time that we get rid of these companies.

[14:48] And I've said it before, pinball will be much better off without these companies creating a dark cloud over the hobby.

[14:56] I enjoy doing this podcast with I'm talking more about how awesome the art packages are on Iron Maiden and how cool Monster Bash remake is going to be when they give it a 2.0 with the top and the armor and the display.

[15:10] I want to talk about the stuff that excites you guys. I want to entertain you guys. There's a lot of misconception that I want this show to only be about these dramatic pinball collapses and I don't.

[15:23] But I did tell you all that this would happen and I'm not a genius. I just know that when you give someone a hundred bucks to do something for you and they spend $200 without doing the thing they were supposed to do, the company is going to collapse.

[15:40] It's very much just basic economics as to why highway pinball and Dutch pinball were never going to make it the same with Z-Ware. They were never going to make it.

[15:50] And here we are. They didn't make it. So it's another sad day in pinball to see a company go under. But it's even sadder to me that they refuse to just go under that they're still trying to keep the door open that there might be a future for the big Lebowski.

[16:05] The final thing I'll talk about is what does this mean for people who actually have a big Lebowski and do I think those games that are a made are going to end up somewhere. Let me start with the first thing.

[16:16] Which is you have a big Lebowski machine and you own one we know Kim Mitchell has one we know he was selling it for 20 grand. He's probably going to offer it now for like 40 50 grand.

[16:26] All right. He's now got this rare item and there are other people out there who have one as well. And so if you own one I know there's one at Sunshine Laundromat that's always broken.

[16:37] If you own this machine is it going to go up in value let me just tackle that. I look I think it will go up in value. I'm not and here's why I don't think alien machines are look at alien they're selling now for like eight nine thousand dollars which is what they were kind of selling for.

[16:55] Nobody wants them they're still for sale nobody's gobbling up alien machines if you offered a big Lebowski today for nine thousand dollars it would sell immediately I think there's a few reasons for that I think the big Lebowski is a far superior game.

[17:11] Then alien pinball it looks much better it plays much better it's got way more wow factor going on in the game I think a lot more people would rather own the big Lebowski so there's that reason.

[17:23] It's a standard body which we know people want more than than wide bodies I know that's like a silly little stupid reason but it's true it's true.

[17:30] I also think that when it comes to support long term support of the games I think there's much more nervousness around alien pinball than the big Lebowski but I'll say this both games both games in my mind are ticking mechanical time bombs so you can buy one but if something breaks how fun will it be to own a big Lebowski when someone comes over and you're like well the bowling alley doesn't work but it's there or that doesn't work or this doesn't work.

[17:59] And once that starts to happen and there is no support and there is no customer service it really begs the question is will you enjoy in joy owning it and as someone who's owned a rare game with a negative story surrounding it with no support I can tell you flat out it is absolutely no fun owning these games and I also think just from an emotional standpoint it is no fun.

[18:28] It is no fun owning a rare game that is caused so many people pain and suffering and anxiety and also you own a game that should be someone else's okay so what do I mean by that is if you go buy a big Lebowski now from someone and you buy second hand and you have it in your game room you just have you have to live with the fact that you have a game that a couple hundred guys out there paid in full four and never got.

[18:57] And that just makes you feel kind of shitty that if anyone should get a crack at it it should probably be them but look life is not fair and if you've seen Cobra Kai the ultimate lesson in Cobra Kai is no mercy and I love the way that the that Johnny describes what no mercy means in 2018 and it means that life is not fucking fair that one day life is going great and the next day you know life throws you a curve ball and something shitty happens it's shit in your face.

[19:27] And that's life like Dutch pinball has shit on everybody that thought they were getting a big Lebowski it's not fair but you know what that's life if you want to go get a big Lebowski and you're going to have to wave you know fifteen twenty thousand dollars around and you get one and some other guy who's supposed to have it doesn't have it that's just life it sucks but that's the reality of of of where we are with this whole thing.

[19:53] I wouldn't want to own one knowing that there's not going to be support I really if if a race at look we made the parts we will we you know the company's closed down but we're going to sell replacement parts for the game I mean they could charge a lot but people would stock up on them and at least just have the game the other thing is the game is not really done the game has not been fully coded but the game runs on p rock so coding the game

[20:21] and getting the game to a better place is not impossible it can be done so there is that part of it so it's a gamble it's a gamble I just I just think with all the pinball coming out that's not a gamble you have to be a little bit obsessed or crazy to go in on such a volatile title all right now what do I think about the forty games at a.a. will they ever be released you know that's going to that's going to be part of the lawsuit

[20:49] and they might sell those games to raise capital for the money they feel their owed that will be an interesting day in pinball if those games hit the auction block I would love to see what they go for can you imagine if if forty big libous he's all of a sudden win up for auction as much as people say like they wouldn't buy one I think a lot of collectors out there would would find their own thoughts to be somewhat hypocritical of their action

[21:18] and they would probably want to go grab one so who knows who knows what we do know is this lawsuits take a long time lawsuits take a lot of money this thing is not going to end well it's just not there is not going to be this positive ending to the Dutch pinball tail it's unfortunate again I think they had two options

[21:47] they had two options that they failed to do properly they should have worked it out with a.r.a. and given their buyers the opportunity to pay more to resolve the higher cost of manufacturing or they should have gone to someone like a spooky or a Jersey Jack or even a stern would a contract manufactured it for them think about it stern contract manufactured medieval madness remake why didn't varying the op just go to stern and say can you make our game

[22:17] you know why they probably couldn't because they said fuck stern so why would George Gomez and Gary stern open their doors to a company that came out of the gates cursing them out all right so it's over it's over and you know I just think ultimately ultimately the last four years of pinball I think it has shown everybody one thing that stern

[22:46] pinball for all of their faults for all of the things that you know we complain about with dimples and ghosted inserts and all that jazz stern pinball has spent 30 years 30 years figuring out how to make pinball machines in that 30 plus years they have figured out you know issues that will come up they have figured out problems that need to be solved they have figured out how to do the

[23:16] most important thing in all of pinball and I know people don't like to hear this but the most important thing to know how to do in all of pinball is very simple and that is make a profit it's the thing that people never want to face up to it's not about making pinball fun it's about making pinball financially

[23:42] profitable if you aren't financially profitable as a pinball company you will go away and then is that fun owning a game from a company that's now defunct that there will be no support for and I think stern catches a lot of

[23:58] the things they do to remain profitable and I think all of us should basically be thankful that we have them right because they made machines that are profitable so they'll be around and and look we're going to talk a little bit on this podcast I want to

[24:18] I want to read your mail next because in it I got some stuff about my comments about pirates the Caribbean so I want to talk about that on this podcast as well but I do I do think we need to stop you know looking at pinball as something that we should just blindly cheerlead and root for every new pinball company to succeed no what we really should do is is scrutinize any new pinball company's ability to actually deliver on the market

[24:48] and what they promise right if someone comes out and says hey I'm going to make 10 pinball machines just 10 and I'm going to build them in my house would you look at that guy like he's crazy maybe not probably not you could do that right but when Andrew highway says I'm going to ship 500 games a month and I've never built a game before and people like gave him money like that's crazy and now we know all right let me move on to mail and let's talk about some of the stuff that you guys have been

[25:18] saying to me now I did get a bunch of questions for Jerry and I'll let you guys know this I tried to move the Jerry interview to tonight simply because I had to go to a work function last night we're going to do it early next week so look out for that interview I also interviewed let's see Joe Newhart from pinball star a distributor who is one of the greatest distributors out there and we're going to talk to him about all the things going on

[25:48] the pinball world I think you guys are going to love that interview but let me read your emails that I have received recently okay all right I'm trying to think like yeah

[25:58] yeah I got an email from to to to to to I'm trying to we through the p3 once I got one from Jacob Jacob thank you for listening to the show and he's in his headline is please no more Dave Sanders he says

[26:13] canada love the show but for the love of Christ please no more interviews with Dave Sanders please he sucks balls as a guest furthermore I find it somewhat ironic how you

[26:27] rightfully vilify Andrew highway then turn around and encourage your listener base to donate to someone who so easily duped by that

[26:37] swindler no thanks in my opinion only a moron would work for no pay keep fighting the good fight Jacob and he says

[26:47] p s I'd be willing to bet you fifty bucks that had to head pinball wins next year's best podcast twippy all right so here's the thing Jacob first of

[26:56] all let me let me address both these things first of why you know having Dave Sanders on as a guest so I actually think

[27:04] that Dave is a really great guest and I think Dave has shared some amazing stories about highway pinball what it was like working

[27:12] there and the stories he has should be captured so I'm not sure why you have an issue with with Dave and having him on I don't think he sucks

[27:21] as a guest I do think that you know when you say that Dave worked for no pay and he was a moron and this and that I think you

[27:29] lack something Jacob I think you lack empathy and I'll explain why I think you lack empathy is Dave Sanders is not a moron

[27:37] right Dave Sanders has some disabilities and empathy would lead me to believe that for Dave Sanders to have a normal career like a lot of people can

[27:48] that might not be an option for him so he was lured in to working for Andrew and and being given a career as he saw it and Andrew was doing all sorts of things

[28:02] to try and you know accommodate Dave's needs but also took advantage of Dave and if you I think a lot of people in life can relate to being taken advantage of

[28:16] it's not just no pay I mean most people go into their jobs and they're taking advantage of by their bosses and they don't get what they deserve

[28:23] and this is just another example of that I mean Andrew provided enough for Dave to live on right but he didn't provide him a salary

[28:32] and compensation for the pinball work that he did and and I feel bad for for Dave and I think a lot of people feel bad for him too and I don't think he's a moron

[28:41] so that's just that's just how I feel about that do I think that head to head pinball is going to beat me for the twippy

[28:49] I don't know I think it's it's way too early to tell we've got way too many more shows to go before now and then and who knows if

[28:57] either one of these shows will still be kicking by then who knows anything could happen anything could happen but but Jacob thank you for

[29:03] listening I do appreciate you sharing your opinion and let's go to the next email I got an email from

[29:11] Tim Fudderby and he wrote Tim wrote Tim wrote Tim wrote iron maiden premium was the subject had and he said I felt they screwed me over since I wanted a premium but settled on a pro

[29:24] I don't know if many feel this way but I'm finding the artwork better on the pro and the added features of the premium

[29:31] Ellie are not coded well so while they look cool and cool to have you get very little benefit from them upper playfields and game of thrones

[29:41] Aerospace lower playfield on a cdc I buy pros premiums and elis but that's how I've been feeling on it pros are

[29:50] easier to maintain if my games don't play right I stop playing them until I have time to make them right

[29:56] having a great time on iron maiden pro I think the artwork might not be improved yet on the premium maybe they also considered iron maiden a gamble so why create a premium if there's not enough buyers but it seems like the longer you hold

[30:11] something back the longer the hype might still last all right so Tim sent me this note right before they revealed the premium artwork for iron maiden

[30:20] so look I think that anyone who rushed in and bought an iron maiden pro without waiting to see what the premium package was I don't know why you would do that and here's here's why I mean that and I mean this whole

[30:34] heartedly why do you need a machine tomorrow why do you need it in a week if you haven't seen the premium yet why wouldn't you just wait if I'm about to spend

[30:45] fifty three hundred dollars on something but another version of it is coming out that is seventy three hundred and I'm and I can't afford both I would just wait to see if I would want the the premium right and so I think

[31:01] what's happening with maiden is this and I'm not just seeing it on gameplay I'm seeing it on the art packages I think a lot of people just can't be happy with what they have and this is just

[31:13] this is universal to pinball buyers they always have to justify what they buy and explain to us how happy they are with their decision and that they didn't choose the other

[31:26] version of the game I see it all the time I'm really happy I got iron maiden Ellie because the premium sucks and looks like Indiana Jones

[31:34] and then you got the premium guys that are like the premiums the way to go I'm saving two thousand dollars and you've got a Christmas you know

[31:41] Christmas tree as a pinball machine and then you got the pro guys that are like oh the pros all you need like you don't need

[31:47] the features on the premium it's just you know what you know what why can't people just ever be happy with the game they bought

[31:56] without putting down the other variations of the game at the end of the day nobody gives you shit right and I say

[32:05] this and I mean this nobody gives a shit outside of a few hardcore collectors which version you have because nothing

[32:14] is truly really that limited it's not really rare to stand in front of any of these games because the only

[32:22] thing that's different is the art package for the most part and then a few small features but I could take

[32:28] in 99.9% of people off the street and convince them that iron maiden pro was really the Ellie and this game cost

[32:36] $9,000 and they would just shrug their children and be like oh okay and then move on with their day and go on and not

[32:42] giving a shit I think all the iron maidens look great I don't think anyone should feel like they got

[32:47] fucked over in fact I think this is the nicest game and the nicest options stern as ever given people

[32:55] and they're probably just laughing that even though they've done that right zombie Eddie has given

[33:00] everyone something to feel happy about you go over to pinside and they're still bitching and complaining

[33:08] and saying mean things about different versions of the game and I think that just is why stern doesn't

[33:15] give a shit what people on pinside say about anything because they're selling these things like hotcakes all

[33:21] right I got an email from let's see all right Kevin sandborn and it says you should actually have to

[33:30] be an employee to call yourself staff and he attached a pinside screen grab for you that I want to read

[33:38] to you right now so this comes from the pinside thread of the definitive pinball podcast list and I

[33:45] want to read what someone wrote so pinside user looks like K K O O S wrote I won't believe that it's

[33:54] intentional that canators pinball podcast isn't listed here come on write his name down he's not

[34:02] Voldemort nothing bad will happen when we say his name I must admit he can often go on a rant

[34:09] especially now with the whole highway disaster and I often don't even make it halfway before stop

[34:16] listening but he can offer some good insights news and rumors and it's up to the listeners to

[34:22] decide who likes him and who doesn't right right so the pinside staff responded to this gentleman's

[34:29] post and here's what the pinside staff wrote allow me to offer the pinside staff's position with

[34:36] regard to canada pinside reserves the right to refuse service to anyone and canada lost his

[34:44] pinside privileges so we are exercising our right to refuse service to him anyone is still

[34:52] free to listen to his podcast we are equally free to make the decision not to advertise his podcast

[34:59] I love how they say like we're not going to offer him service like they're giving me like a

[35:03] hand job like pinside is some gas station that I'm pulling up to in my demon and like sorry canada

[35:09] we're not going to fill up your tank you we're not going to do this it's so funny the way they talk

[35:15] like service like they've got this service they're offering us he then goes on to write while we

[35:21] recognize the podcast has its share of listeners topics in those podcasts sometimes include personal

[35:30] tax on members or pinside staff which are not allowed right because you're not allowed to call out

[35:37] force flow on his hypocritical bullshit on pinside if you do that they will threat eject you

[35:43] and you're not allowed to say anything derogatory about a pinside member because you know what

[35:49] we're it's grown man talking about pinball he then goes on to say if you would like to discuss

[35:54] topics that come up in the podcast about news interviews and the like those are fine but that's

[36:01] that's not exactly true if I interview someone that you think was a great interview and you want

[36:07] to say hey you should listen to this interview by canada they will probably scrub that down they

[36:12] then go on to say if anyone would like to discuss our position please open a moderator feedback

[36:18] what I and then what I love about this is they sign it off as pinside staff what I love about this

[36:23] is think about it for a minute you can't openly discuss this topic with them in the open they don't

[36:31] want people to see the actual conversation they want to take it to private messages and that is

[36:39] the whole reason why the pinside staff every time they listen to this podcast which I know they

[36:45] listen to it they go and they crawl up into the corner of the room and they start crying like babies

[36:52] because they can't handle one simple fact that this is the only place where we have a pinball

[36:58] conversation where we don't hold back I mean there is and by that I mean we also will call

[37:04] individuals out who deserve it and they don't want that to exist they would rather live in a world

[37:12] where they have revisionist history where they can control the conversation and they can censor

[37:18] like they love censorship I mean pinside is all about censoring what can be said and let me tell you

[37:25] something when you live in a country where you can't say anything negative about the leaders think

[37:30] about that for a minute we live in America in America you can say fuck you Donald Trump you can say

[37:36] whatever you want about the leadership of this country and you're not going to get a knock on the

[37:41] door and be evicted from your home but on pinside if you say fuck you to the staff for doing something

[37:48] or you question them just questioning them it's not allowed they run a dictatorship right it is not

[37:55] an open dialogue about pinball so don't believe robins excuses about how they really just wanted to be

[38:03] a family you know fun site for pinball hobbyists absolute bullshit they want to control the conversation

[38:09] and they do control the conversation and they have aided it and abetted many many pinball manufacturers

[38:17] ability to advertise think about this they allowed Andrew highway Kevin Koolik barrianyah

[38:24] to advertise their services on pinside and what happened when they allowed this gentleman to advertise

[38:31] their services hundreds of thousands of dollars of pinball hobbyist money is now gone all right my

[38:39] podcast is free i've never heard anybody i never will i don't cause the collapse of pinball companies

[38:46] if a pinball company collapses it's because they made a shitty game and that's the truth all right

[38:53] all right i got an email from lineman sheets lineman and i might be catching up this weekend when

[38:59] he's in for the new york city pinball championship so i want to just pause for a second and say i want

[39:04] to congratulate crazy levy levy newman gregg popparelli you know steve boudin all the people i know

[39:12] neem a craze in town all the people but especially the people that put together the new york city pinball

[39:18] championships i'm not a tournament player i don't pretend to be but i think it's great that they

[39:23] brought the new york city pinball championship to life we got al we got eddy kramer all these people

[39:29] are working on this thing and it's taking place this weekend in new york city so i think that's great

[39:35] i'm going to stop by it at some point uh and and it's funny because i asked levy to come out of the show

[39:42] or or i said to levy like can i come by and do a podcast live from the tournament and he goes to

[39:48] me he's like he's like man like you're gonna come by and just make fun of it and i can't i you know i

[39:53] couldn't tell him with a straight face that i wouldn't actually do that uh but look playing in pinball

[39:58] tournaments is fun for the people playing in the tournaments spectating a pinball tournament

[40:04] questionable how fun that is but i wish those guys the best the luck i hope they raise money

[40:10] i'm glad they got their g fuel sponsor which is really cool that they got a sponsor and that energy

[40:15] drink so i just want to say congrats to those guys that are doing that all right all right let's go

[40:19] back to the emails i got an email from mike georgio and he says hey bud this is mike georgio and

[40:28] Kentucky his name is pin tucky on pinside i just listened to two or three of your podcasts and i

[40:35] wanted to compliment you on what a great job you do you are very articulate and you keep your

[40:41] thought processes very smooth no stumbling or dead airtime you have a tremendous vocabulary

[40:53] education and you are extremely bright i'm just gonna stop there for a second um mike well first

[40:58] thank you very much i think my mom would love to read that with all the money she spent on my education

[41:03] and my mom and dad i'm i'm gonna read another email next where a guy actually corrects some of the

[41:08] grammatical things i've been doing incorrectly which is why i find it funny i love that my listeners

[41:13] keep me honest he then goes on to say i remember when some on pinside were really on your case and

[41:19] i was always supportive of you and couldn't understand why some were so hostile to anything you

[41:25] had to say the only word that kept popping up in my brain then is jealousy i'm a former former tv

[41:32] news broadcaster and radio announcer man you have the perfect voice for talk radio you are quick

[41:37] on your feet and you stay focused you are natural for that so that leads me to wanting to ask you

[41:43] just a few questions my last name is italian i'm catholic republican italian irish all i know

[41:49] about you is your republican do you care to tell me what ethnic origin your last name is doesn't

[41:54] mean anything mine means farmer also what do you do for a living you said on one of the podcasts

[42:00] that you were traveling i'm wondering if that is in connection with your job lastly i viewed your

[42:06] videos a long time ago on the magic girl pin you had at your home i actually only viewed it just

[42:12] to see what you look like and try to figure out what kind of personality you had well i was impressed

[42:18] i immediately sensed i would have chosen to be one of your top friends i simply fell in love with

[42:24] your voice i know you must be busy so i will cut this off thanks for reading mic and Kentucky well

[42:30] mic thank you man i really appreciate that that was very flattering um here's the thing

[42:35] um i'll answer some of your questions so my background my last name is greek my father is greek

[42:41] and my mother is secilian and when you grow up in a secilian in greek household what that means is

[42:47] you grow up in a one hundred percent secilian household my mother has to say over everything yes i

[42:53] am republican by uh... let's see by the way i was raised i'm very physically conservative and very

[43:00] socially liberal i am in i mean i live in uric city this is a city where we have a very open mind

[43:05] about things um but i'm not one of these people that think girl should be allowed into the boy scout

[43:11] sub-america like shit like that makes me sick to my stomach um but i think women's rights is one

[43:17] of the most important things going on is that we see you know i'm just giving you a sense like i think

[43:20] i think gay marriage should be allowed i i don't think we should take away people's rights or make

[43:24] people uh... feel like lesser citizens uh but i also hate when the government like takes more than

[43:29] they deserve and i think government's really ineffective um i want him to give you my views on

[43:34] trump i don't like the man i don't like the man at all all right let me um let me see what else you

[43:39] asked me here my job i work in marketing i work in public relations for a top five public relations

[43:45] firm and i represent some really awesome brands like royal Caribbean and bud wiser and orio

[43:52] you know a lot of fun stuff i get to do every day i get to go in every day and just come up with

[43:56] fun creative ideas to help get these brands into the media so that's why when you hear me saying

[44:01] i know a thing or two about marketing uh i kind of do know a thing or two about marketing now not

[44:06] all of my marketing applies to pinball so we know that i look if you just make a decent game

[44:10] it'll sell i mean that's that's what i know about pinball and thank you for writing it uh let's see

[44:16] oh to to to do i got an email from to to to to to do to do to do to do to do to do this i want to read

[44:21] this one i want to find the one that that makes fun of my grammar because i think it's so funny okay

[44:26] yes i got an email from uh ginger ginger tockens he says hey christ love the show i'll try and put

[44:35] this in a nice way please stop using the term begs the question it doesn't mean what you think

[44:42] it means use raises the question instead as the host of the show your point gets across better if

[44:51] you sound like you know what you're talking about in other words if you sound educated in the

[44:57] topic you're speaking about when you use the wrong terms often um this makes you sound uneducated

[45:05] unprofessional you see what i love about these two emails one guy just said i'm very educated and have

[45:10] a great professional sense and now because i use the term begs the question um and then he gives me

[45:18] the the logical fallacy behind using it so begging the question sometimes known by its ladd and name

[45:24] patitio principi meaning assuming the initial point is a logical fallacy in which the writer or

[45:32] speaker assumes the statement under examination to be true in other words begging the question

[45:38] involves using a premise to support itself uh let's see also don't get mad um on american

[45:47] bastardization of the term i couldn't care less you guys could say couldn't could instead or

[45:54] couldn't which actually means you do care uh all right so first of all i want to thank you

[46:00] for the for the grammar lesson i appreciate it um you know after reading this it begs the question

[46:07] should i stop doing i'm just kidding i'm just kidding i appreciate it i do we all use some of these

[46:12] phrases incorrectly and i'm glad that he called me out on it all right i got an email from james

[46:18] about jersey jack and pyrates the carabin and i want to read this one because i was i was pretty

[46:24] specific on why i think pyrates the carabin is just missing something really important he writes

[46:31] canada uh several podcasts ago you wonder you you wondered how loud how jersey jack got the idea

[46:38] for wizard of os to be its first pinball the answer is simple jack already had licensed the name

[46:44] for several redemption type arcade games using the theme attached are the pictures since he

[46:50] already had a working relationship with a license or and he wanted to make a game that had why

[46:55] to peel what would be more logical uh well first i'll stop you right there james um i you know

[47:02] just you there's a lot more logical pinball themes that people would want considering the pinball

[47:08] demographic the demographic for people who play redemption games is not the demographic for pinball

[47:15] if you ask me i think that's just a little bit lazy that you would just go with a license because

[47:23] it was easier to get i i do i don't think that's what i would come out the gate with in terms of

[47:28] pinball look i still think he made a great game with was but that's just my opinion he writes then

[47:34] secondly you have been quite critical of jersey jack for making complicated games that have too much

[47:40] stuff keep in mind that you have also stated that you would like to see jersey jack as a kind of

[47:46] luxury brand in order to be a luxury brand for many types of products you need lots of extra

[47:52] bells and whistles even if they are not necessary just look at any modern pinball or sorry any

[47:59] modern luxury vehicle Mercedes BMW Lexus go down the features list i'll bet that there are many

[48:06] features most people don't even know they have even if they do most people will use many features

[48:13] once or never all right he finishes by saying keep in mind that there are differing opinions i

[48:20] agree that for someone playing a game in the wild that it can be overwhelming and discouraging

[48:25] but if i were to buy the game for my home my wants would be completely different if they offered

[48:31] 100 different characters i wouldn't think that was too many all right i just need to stop you there

[48:37] james i'm gonna go through more of what you said you don't think it'd be too many to select from

[48:41] 100 different characters for pirates or the Caribbean i almost shouldn't have read that part of

[48:46] your email because i feel like that this that discredits anything you're but you say because

[48:52] that's that's insane my man 100 can you imagine having to cycle through 100 different characters

[48:57] anyway he goes on to conclude it just gives you more to explore if i'm going to spend almost 10k

[49:04] on a game i want there to be as many features modes and things to do as possible this includes

[49:10] video modes after all with computers these days a programmer can just create an option to turn off

[49:16] any feature that you don't want also in theory that is why pro and premium machines were created

[49:23] even if it hasn't necessarily turned out that way easier lesser featured and easier to understand

[49:29] machines should be in the arcades all right well james thank you for writing in and and the email

[49:35] i want to i want to talk about this for a minute because i think you bring up some interesting points

[49:40] and i want to start off with the whole notion that uh jersey jack wants to be luxury pinball

[49:46] and i agree that jersey jack machines are best suited for the home environment i do think that jack

[49:53] has a little bit of a pipe dream in that operators are going to run to buy his games because i don't

[50:00] think his games work well on location uh for a few reasons they're far too expensive you have to

[50:08] collect way too much money before you break even on a game at the end of the day a ghost buster's

[50:14] pro will run circles around a jersey jack game in terms of what it will earn for an operator so

[50:21] what are you going to go buy a forty five hundred dollar ghost buster's pro or put an eight nine

[50:27] thousand dollar jersey jack machine next to it twice as much money and will also have you know twice

[50:33] as much stuff that could possibly go wrong in the game you know so i think that jack's market is

[50:39] the home market but i don't agree that more equals better or more equals luxury i don't agree with

[50:46] that if you look at sure you can look at mercedes and bmw and that and that but go go into a maclan

[50:53] go into a Ferrari go into the fun cars right please remember this pinball is meant to be fun

[51:00] so if you want to say let's look at luxury cars that are designed to be fun the luxury car that

[51:07] is designed for entertainment and i think you know fun factor those are your enthusiast cars

[51:13] and those cars are very rarely complicated to figure out what to do and i was in my friends

[51:18] McLaren the other weekend there's like nothing in it but a few knobs for the stereo for the climate

[51:24] control and then your focus is on that big digital tech that's showing you how god damn fast you're

[51:31] accelerating right and i just think that when i say that jersey jack games are too complex i don't

[51:37] mean there's like too much physical stuff in the game i don't think that's the issue i think we're

[51:42] where the games fall down for me is there's way too much in the coding that to understand when you

[51:48] step up to the machine i also think the way jack lays his games out it's oftentimes confusing just

[51:53] from a visual standpoint what do i shoot at see a game can have a lot in it but still be simple

[52:00] and when a pimple machine has a simple layout that you understand it doesn't mean there's not a lot

[52:06] it just means it's simple to understand what to shoot for that also doesn't make it easy right pimple

[52:12] is not easy you can have a simple lots to do in a game that you that you understand you need to know

[52:19] how to do but it's also hard right so that's that's why i like Batman Batman is like really easy

[52:26] to understand what to shoot at it's really the shots are clearly marked what i do is clearly marked

[52:33] but it doesn't make it super easy it's still a hard game at times sometimes you have long ball

[52:39] times sometimes your games over quickly that's why i like the game you know so and then when you

[52:45] talk about his last point you know for ten thousand dollars you want to have all these things and

[52:50] all this depth yeah i think people expect a lot for that kind of money but again like i think

[52:57] where jack has issues is premiums pros and elise right here's my thing and i'm just i've been

[53:05] thinking a lot about jersey jack because i do like the company and i do like jack personally and i

[53:09] do want them to be successful i just for the life of me can't understand why it is hard to follow

[53:18] in the footsteps of what stern does and just emulate what they do but make the games better and

[53:24] here's here's what i mean by that in the last ten years how many games has stern shipped right i

[53:31] would say if you say on let's say on average on average and this is probably low the in the last

[53:37] ten years stern is probably shipped i would five thousand games a year that is probably a low

[53:43] average let's just say fifty thousand machines they've they've sold i bet that's a low low number

[53:49] how many of those games were a wide body how many zero all right how many of them right

[53:58] allowed you to select twenty two characters when you start the game zero how many times did they

[54:05] offer in le and make one thousand to fifteen hundred of those limited editions zero right so

[54:15] i just keep thinking that jack just won't do get people what they want which is that first of all

[54:23] collectors really want a limited edition version of the game that is truly limited and i've said

[54:27] this before around four to five hundred is all you should ever make of a limited edition version

[54:33] of the game and jack tries to like call the limited editions limited and then makes them forever

[54:40] so they're actually his premiums and so then the collectors edition becomes the limited edition

[54:45] but it's so stupid the word limited is limited for a reason and he just uses it arbitrarily and i

[54:54] think that's a huge mistake i also don't think that people want wide body machines show me someone

[55:00] out there who prefers wide body over standard body games they just don't shoot as well and i

[55:07] think that's why people prefer the way dialed in shoots to both wizard of us and the hobbit but

[55:13] now we're going to once again get another wide body and pirates another wide body in willy

[55:19] wonka and we have to wait for pat lawler why is it think about that for a minute why is it that

[55:24] the best pinball designer of all time the the layout that he prefers to use for his jersey jack

[55:31] games is a standard body machine and when you look at the fact that sternones ninety five percent

[55:37] of the market and all they ever make are standard body machines why is jack going wide because the

[55:44] reason is is jack thinks he needs to always go bigger batter boulder to like justify the cost and

[55:50] i say he doesn't if he would just put that quality that he makes into a standard body he'd be

[55:55] more successful because what happened to jack is he misread the complete market when he came out

[56:02] when jersey jack came out in like circuit two thousand twelve two thousand thirteen with his plans

[56:07] i think what he saw was that collectors were really excited by games like twilight zone i think

[56:14] he used twilight zone as his sort of guiding light his north star for his entire company like

[56:22] i'm going to make a wide body full featured game because that is what collectors want but why did

[56:28] he lock himself in to that so much i just think he'd be better off if you went with standard body

[56:36] games so and look here we are here we are and i still think that jersey jack has such potential

[56:44] but until they get back to offering the normal amount of elis for the right price he twelve thousand

[56:53] dollar five hundred that's not that's not the right price for jacks elis it's just not and

[57:01] and and i doubt they're going to sell every pyrids the care being collectors edition i doubt

[57:06] they sold every collectors edition of dialed in that they made a hundred and fifty of them

[57:10] have you seen a hundred and fifty people unbox dialed in collectors editions i why doesn't someone

[57:16] on the inside do a dialed in collectors edition roll call remember when you guys did the roll call

[57:21] with alien and everyone said what number they were can we please do that i would love i would love

[57:27] to verify how many of those one fifty actually went out the door okay okay so look i i said a lot

[57:35] about pirates and the last podcast and i stand behind what i said i think the game has a lot to like

[57:43] but i just think it's missing the personality of of the pirates world that people people love

[57:49] and and that's that's that so let's end this podcast with one more email i got this from Alex

[57:55] Rose Alex thank you for listening to canada's pinball podcast he writes hey canada i'm a new listener

[58:02] and i also am new to pinball enjoying most of your podcast i bought my first two games this year

[58:09] with pretty much zero history i went with a dialed in and a tna well first of all Alex that that is

[58:16] a great beginning lineup in pinball um he then writes our family loves them both and we're hooked

[58:22] on the hobby i plan to eventually settle in on a four pin collection so enjoy the search for three

[58:29] and four prior to the caribbean has had me excited from the announcement and i've healed my deposit

[58:37] through discate but since then i've struggled with losing my excitement with the game that i had

[58:44] the first six months and i'm often debating if i will get one or not like you i watched the last

[58:50] stream and i just felt like what's been done with the game just didn't capture the essence of what

[58:57] i enjoyed most about the movies the humor i actually posted this on pincs i'd write after the stream

[59:04] and so it was pretty cool to hear you echo the sentiment i sat down and watched one of the

[59:09] pirates the caribbean movies and the whole thing the whole magic is the humor and the game hasn't

[59:15] captured one ounce of it instead it's this pinball journey to unlock chapters qualify shots unlock

[59:24] multi balls and ultimately get to each movies wizard mode throughout this whole pinball journey

[59:30] you won't laugh you won't get any pirate humor you can't laugh at jack's drunk and womanizing

[59:36] it's actually super super disappointing if you actually like the movies even the disney rides

[59:44] portray the movies with the same sense of humor i don't understand why disney would want a shitty

[59:49] humorless pinball and integration with no alcohol as a restriction why when it's some prevel when

[59:57] it's so prevalent in the movie would they make this stipulation especially for something that needs

[01:00:02] to attract dollars in barcades and other locations filled with paying adults we have gory the walking

[01:00:09] debts any theme imaginable yet we can't have rum on pirates there isn't a rum aren't their pirates

[01:00:16] drinking rum in the pirates the caribbean ride at disney world that's just me saying that right now

[01:00:21] um Alex that then goes on to say anyway my anxiousness and desire to not wait a year has me holding

[01:00:28] my deposit for the le maybe i have a tiny shrewd of hope i'll be heard and jj will start

[01:00:36] operation pirate humor and revitalize the game making it the humorous ride journey it needs to be

[01:00:43] i think the physical game is nearly perfect it needs a completely new performance though that

[01:00:49] entertains me on my pinball journey not the serious stagnant solstice result they have now if i

[01:00:57] can buy a funny as hell pirates pinball machine that insults me womanizes and makes me laugh out loud

[01:01:04] i'm in i didn't think i was alone in my opinion so i'm writing to commiserate with you i love

[01:01:11] jersey jack i want pirates but they have to spend the rest of the hours before launched to inject

[01:01:15] life and entertainment into the game it just falls way too short as it is Alex well Alex first of all

[01:01:20] thank you i couldn't agree more uh and i think the reason why we don't have a pirate to the caribbean

[01:01:27] game with humor is very simple i think when you look at the four people who made the game

[01:01:36] or even the two people most responsible for the game is you've got an engineer and you've got a

[01:01:43] programmer that to me i don't think they set out to make a game that was funny i don't think they

[01:01:52] set out to make a game that was humorous i think they set out to make a game that was a pinball

[01:01:58] machine that would succeed on a pinball level and what i mean by that is i i think it's all about

[01:02:06] the pinball it's all about um scoring it's all about multi balls it's all about chapters it's

[01:02:13] all about how how this happens on a pinball level but not how do we make this funny as hell right

[01:02:22] imagine a tack from ours that very game it's it's a great shooter people have fun with it but

[01:02:29] imagine if you strip the humor out of attack from ours and make it a serious game about aliens

[01:02:36] invading right imagine and to me like that's kind of you know almost like dialed in has like a

[01:02:42] lack of sense of humor too imagine if you took medieval madness and made it more of an earnest

[01:02:48] tale about you know a night and a castle and dragons and i think when i look at Keith and eric

[01:02:56] it's like they know how to talk about this thing on a pinball level but i just don't feel like

[01:03:04] laughing like when you watch them play it too they're never laughing they're never like

[01:03:09] there's never that like call out or that like thing that happens or you know that really is like

[01:03:15] humorous it's just not you know i think we even got we definitely got more humor and dialed in like

[01:03:21] when the dialed in selfie mode happens that always makes people laugh when they walk by and they see

[01:03:26] that and we know that Pirate of the Caribbean has a camera like a front a front facing camera

[01:03:32] like they could have done something more fun with that versus just making it take your photo for

[01:03:38] like the wanted poster for the high scores so it is what it is i think the game we're gonna get

[01:03:44] is the game we're gonna get i don't think there's gonna be i think it's really hard now to radically go

[01:03:49] and try and design a game to make it funny i think they went all in on a more serious Pirates game and

[01:03:56] i think for me that's why i don't think it brings to life the fun whimsical nature of Pirates of

[01:04:02] the Caribbean that that's just my take if you agree or disagree it's your opinion that's just my

[01:04:07] opinion and i happily welcome eric and Keith to come on the show at any time to talk about the

[01:04:14] i mean i i think all of us went through this like cycle where we were super excited about the game

[01:04:19] like visually a bluest the fuck away and then as we've seen it more and more and maybe it's just a

[01:04:23] matter of like over all the months we've waited the hype dies down your excitement dies down

[01:04:30] yeah and maybe we are nitpicking and and looking for stuff to not be happy about because some of

[01:04:36] our excitement has waned you know in the wake of like iron maiden in the in the wake of other things

[01:04:42] that have gone on in the hobby so that's that all right what else is going on in the world well

[01:04:50] that's the thing i want to close on with this episodic need us pinball podcasts there's always

[01:04:55] bad news in the world and you know i saw this tragedy in texas today in the school shooting again

[01:05:02] right it's like it happens like every month it feels like and i just want to say that

[01:05:07] i really appreciate all you guys who listen to this show and i really just hope everyone out

[01:05:12] there puts their health and their happiness first and i know we take jabs at people on the show

[01:05:17] and we say things that might be considered disparaging about pinball companies and some of you might

[01:05:23] have lost eighty five hundred dollars on your big Lebowski's or your aliens and and you might not be

[01:05:29] as excited about pirates of the Caribbean as you want it to be but we all should just be really

[01:05:34] thankful that we're alive that we're here that that we can spend our time freely talking about

[01:05:44] pinball machines that we live in a country for the most part and for those of you around the world

[01:05:49] who listen to the show you also live in a country where you have access to pinball machines and

[01:05:55] that's a special thing and we are really lucky all of us like nobody nobody out there

[01:06:02] has a pinball collection who you know who who who's like down and out like who's completely like

[01:06:10] at the end of the line and i hope not i hope no one's in that situation for the most part

[01:06:15] you know when you get to the point where you can buy these kinds of machines and get into this hobby

[01:06:21] you know hopefully you've got everything else in your life in order and life isn't fair

[01:06:26] and and that is the reality of life it's not fair that you lost money on a pinball venture

[01:06:30] but life does go on and you sometimes have to chalk it up and move on you know and it sucks

[01:06:37] and and your anger is real and it's okay to share it and it's okay to lash out at times and express

[01:06:42] those emotions but when you do look at what else is going on in the world you know the families

[01:06:48] that have to come home and all of a sudden like a son or a daughter is not there and we're like

[01:06:53] arguing about pinball it does help to put a lot of what we do into perspective so i just want to say

[01:06:59] this week and everyone like like kiss your kiss your loved ones be thankful be happy that you can

[01:07:06] flip pinball machines and take care of yourselves i haven't said that in a while but i i do i do think

[01:07:19] because i want you guys to be around uh to finally see toy story come out it's probably going to

[01:07:25] be sometime in the next like five years okay so i want everyone to be here to see that moment
