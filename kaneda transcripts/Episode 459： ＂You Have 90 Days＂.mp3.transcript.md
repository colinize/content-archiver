[00:00] Oh, what a beautiful morning.

[00:04] Oh, what a beautiful day.

[00:09] I got a beautiful feeling.

[00:14] Everything's going my way.

[00:24] Did you miss me?

[00:26] I did a little experiment to see how much

[00:29] Canadian Spinball Podcast fans could miss the show.

[00:31] Could you go a whole week without an episode

[00:34] of Canadian Spinball Podcasts?

[00:36] I'm sitting here before you,

[00:37] the only pinball podcaster with a fractured rib.

[00:42] And my God, if you've ever broken a rib,

[00:45] you know this is one of the most painful injuries.

[00:47] You can't breathe, you can't sleep, you can't move.

[00:52] I did not fracture my eighth rib by choice.

[00:56] I'm in a lot of pain.

[00:58] But you know it'll take the pain away

[01:00] thinking about pinball for a half hour or so.

[01:03] So let's do that right now in episode 459

[01:06] of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[01:08] And there's been some pinball developments

[01:10] since we've been away, since we've been mending

[01:13] the world's number one pinball podcaster.

[01:15] And one of my biggest rumors has come true.

[01:19] And that was, and I told you so,

[01:21] that Jersey Jack Pinball would be moving

[01:23] his manufacturing facilities to Chicago.

[01:27] And really it's funny, because it's like just down

[01:30] the road from Stern Pinball.

[01:31] And so what do we think about Jersey Jack moving

[01:34] to Illinois?

[01:36] Is it now going to be Illinois Jack Pinball?

[01:39] No, it's not.

[01:39] I don't think they're going to change the name.

[01:41] But I think this move is long overdue.

[01:44] And Jack did an interview with this weekend pinball

[01:48] in which he says the reason why they're moving,

[01:51] their operations from New Jersey to Chicago

[01:55] is because they've outgrown their New Jersey facility.

[01:59] And I'm here to tell you right now on Canadian Spinball

[02:02] Podcasts.

[02:02] And it's the reason why you love this show.

[02:04] I'm here to tell you right now, I think that's a flat out lie.

[02:08] I don't think this is a move because demand was so great

[02:11] for their product that they had to move operations there

[02:14] into a bigger facility.

[02:15] It's cheaper.

[02:16] It's cheaper to make pinball machines in Chicago.

[02:20] More of the talent associated with pinball is in Chicago.

[02:24] More of the vendors and the parts and the suppliers

[02:28] are in Chicago.

[02:29] There's trade shows in Chicago.

[02:32] You don't have, there's more arcades and barcades in Chicago.

[02:35] There's more ability to test your games out in Chicago.

[02:39] There's just so many advantages to being in Chicago

[02:43] over New Jersey.

[02:44] And also, I think the biggest thing is,

[02:46] it's much easier to get workers and skilled laborers

[02:51] who know how to make pinball machines in Chicago.

[02:54] Because you can't tell me if Jersey Jack Pinball

[02:56] doesn't offer another $2 more an hour

[03:00] that they can't go grab a bunch of employees

[03:03] from Stern Pinball to come and sit on the line and make games.

[03:06] And these are people who have been making games for decades.

[03:08] So that is why Jersey Jack Pinball is probably

[03:12] moving to Chicago.

[03:13] I mean, Jack is the ultimate salesman.

[03:15] He'll never give us the truth and just tell us

[03:17] the real reason why it's always the salesman's spin.

[03:21] But this means that guns and roses

[03:23] will be manufactured in Chicago.

[03:26] Now, the question then becomes, is when?

[03:29] When will they be ready to put guns and roses on the line?

[03:32] Is the Chicago manufacturing facility all set up

[03:35] and ready to go?

[03:37] I don't think so.

[03:38] I don't think it's going to happen in March or April.

[03:41] So maybe they've been tooling this facility for a while now

[03:44] and maybe it is ready to go.

[03:46] But I do know this.

[03:47] They do not plan to show guns and roses

[03:50] until games are in box and ready to go out to people.

[03:54] And Jack's main goal, and I hope he hits it, I really do.

[03:58] His main goal is to reveal and ship two games in one fiscal year.

[04:04] And that means guns and roses by Eric and Toy Story

[04:09] by Pat Lawler will Jack be able to reveal and ship two games

[04:13] in one year.

[04:13] Now, he said he was going to do that last year

[04:16] with Wizard of Oz and, sorry, Wizard of Oz.

[04:19] See, it's the pain medications with Willie Wonka and guns

[04:23] and roses.

[04:24] Now, clearly the delays were all to do with the play field issues

[04:27] and Jack had to stop.

[04:29] Like, I think that created a three to four month delay

[04:32] on their scheduling.

[04:33] And guns and roses is a machine that's been done for a while.

[04:36] Now, guns and roses coming out of Chicago by Eric,

[04:39] when will we see the game?

[04:41] I do not think we're going to see this game at T-P-F.

[04:44] I also don't think we're going to see this game at MGC.

[04:49] I don't know if they're going to be ready to go.

[04:52] Now, if we do see it, I do hope that Jack doesn't show this game

[04:57] until it's ready to ship.

[04:59] Because here's something I've been hearing from people.

[05:01] And this is something that I agree with and I want to share it with you.

[05:05] And this is what distributors tell manufacturers left and right.

[05:08] 90 days.

[05:10] 90 days is the biggest key in all of Pimball.

[05:15] You have 90 days to reveal your game, to create hype,

[05:20] and to sell as many of those games as you can in a 90 day window.

[05:26] And it makes total sense when you think about it.

[05:28] 90 days from a reveal to manufacturing, to shipping,

[05:33] to taking orders, to locking in buyers.

[05:35] You have 90 days.

[05:37] And then hype is dead.

[05:39] People move on.

[05:40] Three months.

[05:41] And people no longer care about your title.

[05:44] And if you think about Stern Pimball,

[05:45] they understand this principle better than everybody.

[05:49] After 90 days, what does Stern do?

[05:51] After they reveal a title.

[05:53] They reveal another title.

[05:55] Four cornerstone games.

[05:58] Three months apart.

[05:59] They understand this to the tee.

[06:02] And then in between that, they'll release vault additions

[06:05] and they'll make commission games.

[06:07] But 90 days is the window you have to create hype.

[06:11] That is why when a game like October Fest was revealed,

[06:15] and then there was a six month delay to ship it,

[06:18] it was dead on arrival.

[06:19] Even the greatest game of all time, right?

[06:21] Piverts of the Caribbean by Jersey Jack Pimball.

[06:25] What happened when they revealed that game

[06:27] and made people wait like 10 to 12 months?

[06:31] It was a sales flop.

[06:33] People forget this.

[06:35] There is like revisionist history as people are claiming

[06:37] this is the greatest game of all time

[06:39] and it needs to be rerun.

[06:40] People are forgetting that it was so easy to get a pirate

[06:44] to the Caribbean, Ellie and Collective's edition.

[06:46] It was easy.

[06:47] It wasn't hard to get.

[06:48] They weren't flying off a shelves.

[06:50] The demand wasn't there.

[06:51] And then now that they're no longer making the game,

[06:54] the demand is there.

[06:55] And that's only because of scarcity.

[06:57] But 90 day window.

[06:59] And that is the benchmark for all the Pimball.

[07:02] And that's why if you're spooky Pimball,

[07:04] you're doing back flips.

[07:06] Because you don't need 90 days for Rick and Morty.

[07:08] You did it in four hours, right?

[07:11] They created such a strong hype window

[07:14] that within four hours, Rick and Morty

[07:16] had sold every single spot.

[07:18] And not only sold every single spot,

[07:21] remember, these are a $1,500 blood sucker edition

[07:25] non-refundable deposits that Chuck put in the bank

[07:30] that people can't back out of.

[07:33] Unbelievable in four hours.

[07:34] Okay, let's talk a little bit about Rick and Morty.

[07:37] Okay, because I have not,

[07:39] due to my injury last Friday,

[07:42] I have not been able to go to Jack Bar to play Rick and Morty.

[07:45] And it is painful.

[07:47] Knowing that this machine is literally

[07:51] a 20 minute subway ride, a 15 minute Uber ride away from me,

[07:55] and I can't go play it.

[07:58] I haven't left the apartment since then.

[08:01] I'm in pain.

[08:02] So it is painful to me that I have not been able

[08:05] to jump on a Rick and Morty.

[08:06] Now, that being said, I've heard a lot of good

[08:12] about this game.

[08:13] I've also heard some people out there

[08:15] are having real issues with the upper right flipper

[08:20] orbit shot.

[08:21] I need to go play it.

[08:22] I've heard from, you know, from John at Jack Bar,

[08:26] and he says the game is phenomenal.

[08:28] I've heard from Wysnow who won't stop talking

[08:31] about the game, how amazing it is.

[08:33] I mean, he's basically anointed himself

[08:36] the ambassador of Rick and Morty Pimbal.

[08:38] And you know how I feel about Hilton.

[08:40] He's a passionate guy.

[08:41] He's outspoken.

[08:43] But he's kind of not the ambassador

[08:45] do you want to have on your machine.

[08:46] If he becomes the torch bearer of your machine,

[08:49] you're kind of in trouble because nobody really believes him.

[08:53] And he doesn't deserve the credibility.

[08:56] I mean, after all the predator and alien,

[08:58] all the people, again, history people.

[09:00] Study your history of where stuff is coming from now.

[09:04] That being said, I've heard from many more people

[09:07] other than Hilton that Rick and Morty

[09:09] is a really fun, incredible experience.

[09:11] I look forward to playing it.

[09:13] But here's a couple things I want to talk about.

[09:15] So first and foremost, I saw spooky Pimbal

[09:18] is uploading videos on adjustments

[09:21] that you will probably need to make to your Rick and Morty

[09:24] game.

[09:25] And I'm watching them put these videos up online

[09:28] about adjustments to the flippers and this and that.

[09:31] And I'm saying to myself, oh, that's great.

[09:33] That's really cool.

[09:34] Thanks for that spooky Pimbal.

[09:36] Hey, do me a favor.

[09:37] Why don't you make the adjustments?

[09:39] Why do I have to make the adjustments?

[09:41] Sorry, my cell phone's going off.

[09:42] I'm not going to stop.

[09:43] See, it just seems so silly to me that consumers

[09:47] have to be told adjustments that need to be made out of box.

[09:52] Why?

[09:53] Why doesn't the company just do these adjustments for us?

[09:57] See, there is something that all of us want to do.

[10:01] And if you disagree, I think you're a liar.

[10:04] Everybody wants to open up a new inbox machine

[10:07] and have it work perfectly.

[10:10] It's brand new.

[10:11] You don't want to have to buy a new car and go get it aligned.

[10:15] And to me, an alignment on a new car

[10:17] is the same as having to align the flippers on the game.

[10:22] Why aren't they playing every game

[10:25] before it goes into box and aligning everything

[10:27] so that it works?

[10:29] I don't want to have to be bending rails.

[10:31] Bending spinners, readjusting flippers, adding this, adding that, making...

[10:36] Why?

[10:37] Why do we have to do this?

[10:39] If you design a game in which the alignment on the shots

[10:43] is so...

[10:44] The margin of error between a smooth shot and a clunky shot,

[10:49] if you design a game where it requires such a perfect dialing in of the game,

[10:54] that's a bad design.

[10:56] I'm sorry, but that's bad design.

[10:58] I don't think a pinball machine should come down to like millimeters of alignment

[11:03] or else it's not going to shoot properly.

[11:05] That's not good design.

[11:06] And games should have a margin of error

[11:09] in which stuff will still work.

[11:11] And shots will still be makeable and not be rattling around.

[11:15] So I look forward to getting my game.

[11:18] I'm also going to do this because it just feels like

[11:21] it's one of those games that you're going to have to set up properly.

[11:24] Like, not properly, perfectly

[11:27] for the game to function the right way.

[11:28] And so, luckily for me,

[11:31] I can invite John from Jack Bar over to come set up my machine with me

[11:36] and help me set it up,

[11:38] because he'll have a lot of key learnings, okay?

[11:40] Now, look, it's not huge stuff,

[11:42] but it's still weird to me that pinball companies,

[11:46] still to this day, ship us new inbox games

[11:48] and we have to make adjustments that should have been caught at the factory level.

[11:53] Do you disagree?

[11:54] All right.

[11:55] So what else about this game?

[11:56] So now it's becoming quite clear to people

[12:00] that it's going to be a long wait.

[12:02] And the other thing I saw,

[12:04] which was announced today,

[12:06] yesterday was that, or two days ago,

[12:09] was that Ben Heck and Chicago Gaming Company

[12:13] and Spooky Pimball would be teaming up on a new game.

[12:19] It would be a Ben Heck designed and programmed game.

[12:22] And the reason they're doing this,

[12:24] it's quite simple.

[12:26] Spooky Pimball can't make another game for 18 months.

[12:31] And they are now at a point where their games are so popular

[12:35] that the bottleneck to get games out over at Spooky

[12:39] is now a real business problem.

[12:42] It really is.

[12:43] As much as it's great that the next 18 months, they're sold out,

[12:48] it's not great to grow the company

[12:51] because they're leaving so much money on the table

[12:55] because you don't think Charlie would want to make

[12:58] and ship all 750 Rick and Morty's to consumers in just four months

[13:04] and then move on to the next game.

[13:06] You don't think they would want to have more of a pipeline

[13:09] of games coming out.

[13:11] And because of the way they're structured right now,

[13:14] Spooky Pimball is very unattractive to designers

[13:19] because they're going to have to wait forever in a day

[13:23] to get their game going.

[13:24] And we know that was a lot of the reason why Benheck had

[13:28] parted ways with Spooky Pimball because he was frustrated

[13:32] in how long it was taking to get a game out.

[13:35] And I think Charlie now sees that with the right theme

[13:39] and the right amount of goodies in a game,

[13:41] he maybe should have made Benheck's evil dead.

[13:44] Now, will it be evil dead with Chicago Gaming Company?

[13:47] Of course, it will not be evil dead.

[13:50] I don't know, evil dead is not a big enough theme

[13:55] to warrant partnering with Chicago Gaming Company.

[13:59] Now, here's the thing.

[14:00] I want to talk about this.

[14:01] I don't think anyone knows what it is.

[14:03] I don't think we're going to know.

[14:04] Here's my main thing with this announcement is very simply

[14:08] why?

[14:09] Why did they announce this now?

[14:12] And I talked to Ben.

[14:14] The game is over a year away.

[14:16] Why are we announcing this partnership over a year out?

[14:22] I mean, it's no big deal.

[14:25] But something was said that I think is a big deal.

[14:27] And I think it was somewhat of a mistake to say this.

[14:30] And I'd say it to Ben if he called me today.

[14:32] He wrote that this is a re-theme of a game

[14:38] he was designing while at Spooky Pimball.

[14:41] OK.

[14:42] So here's why I think that's a colossal mistake

[14:45] because deep down inside all of us,

[14:48] we want a Pimball machine designed

[14:52] from the ground up based on a theme we love.

[14:55] But we want the theme to dictate the design of the game.

[15:00] Right?

[15:01] You should know what the theme is before you ever put

[15:04] pen to paper and start making the machine itself.

[15:08] Why are you re-skimming what we know is probably

[15:11] evil dead into something else?

[15:14] To me, that just makes no sense.

[15:16] It made no sense to re-skine archer into iron maiden.

[15:21] Because when you do that, how can you not say

[15:26] that there had to be creative limitations to what you made

[15:30] because you had already worked within the pre-existing

[15:33] sandbox that you already designed for another theme?

[15:36] And when Ben HECK designed an evil dead Pimball machine,

[15:40] you can't tell me that he didn't put certain things

[15:43] in certain places because he was trying to bring

[15:46] the evil dead to life in Pimball form.

[15:49] And so then if he goes and re-skins it,

[15:51] and let's say hypothetically, he makes it Gremlins.

[15:55] And evil dead design becomes Gremlins.

[15:57] Well, if you were starting from scratch with Gremlins,

[16:01] wouldn't you maybe have designed it completely differently?

[16:04] Because your entire concept of what that world would be

[16:07] under glass would lay out differently.

[16:10] And that's just my thing with Pimball

[16:12] is I think a game should always be designed

[16:16] from the ground up based on the theme.

[16:19] So I'll give you an example.

[16:20] You take one look at Pirates of the Caribbean

[16:23] and you see Eric designing a pirate world under glass

[16:28] from the ground up.

[16:30] You can't re-skine something into that.

[16:33] It's got a freaking rocking ship.

[16:35] It's got a whirlpool.

[16:36] It's got a treasure chest, right?

[16:37] Everything is in its place based and guided by the theme.

[16:42] The same thing with Willie Wonka,

[16:44] the same thing with Wizard of Oz.

[16:47] You know, a game that I think I would say like the hobbit

[16:49] to me feels more like a boring generic design

[16:52] that could have just been a re-skinned of a lot of stuff.

[16:55] You could put something in place as smog

[16:57] and something else popping up.

[16:59] And to me, that's where the hobbit failed.

[17:00] It just felt generic.

[17:02] It felt uninspired.

[17:03] It didn't feel like it was created by some inspiration

[17:07] by another world.

[17:09] It just felt, you know?

[17:11] So that's, I would not have said that if I were Ben,

[17:14] that it's a re-skinned of a spooky design.

[17:17] All right, so, but look, we're a year out.

[17:19] There's so much exciting stuff coming.

[17:21] It's like almost impossible to think 12 months from now

[17:24] with what's coming in the pipeline.

[17:26] But we do know this.

[17:27] Benheck designing it, going to be a licensed theme

[17:31] and it's going to probably most likely

[17:34] have Christopher Francian artwork,

[17:36] which is music to many people's ears,

[17:38] which is great.

[17:39] But here's the thing with Chicago Gaming Company.

[17:41] They can't even get their next title out.

[17:43] Again, people are like forgetting the troubles

[17:46] with some of these companies.

[17:48] Where the hell is the next game?

[17:51] We've had Minival madness and Monster Bash

[17:53] and attack from Mars.

[17:54] Where is the next remake?

[17:57] It's taken forever, supposed to be Cactus Canyon.

[18:00] It's not going to be, there's not going to be a new T-P-F

[18:03] a new game at T-P-F from Chicago Gaming Company.

[18:06] So I also, I think Chicago Gaming Company

[18:09] is having its own delays.

[18:12] And I think they need to figure out

[18:13] their manufacturing better because we need to move forward.

[18:16] But I'm excited by the thought of Chicago Gaming Company

[18:21] making original games.

[18:23] And also here's, here I think,

[18:25] if you were to ask me,

[18:26] Canada, what's the big story here?

[18:29] The big story is this.

[18:31] This is the big story.

[18:33] Spooky Pimball and Chicago Gaming Company combining forces.

[18:38] The reality of Pimball is this.

[18:40] Is that making Pimball is really difficult.

[18:43] I am shocked that all these boutique companies

[18:47] keep popping up wanting to do manufacturing themselves,

[18:51] wanting to go through all the trials and tribulations

[18:55] and extensive cost required to get Pimball machines

[18:59] out in the world.

[19:00] And yet, why don't some of these boutiques just connect

[19:04] and combine and bring their operations under one roof

[19:08] and share the manufacturing cost

[19:12] and actually give Stern some competition?

[19:15] It makes total sense that Spooky Pimball,

[19:18] a company that has tremendous goodwill,

[19:21] a company that has a lot of fans,

[19:23] a company that now knows the secret sauce.

[19:26] Spooky Pimball now knows the secret formula.

[19:29] They can't go back.

[19:30] They can't go back and make obscure niche,

[19:34] sort of horror movies, spooky themes at Chuck and Bug Love.

[19:38] That company was built on themes

[19:41] that Chuck and Bug were into.

[19:42] They now understand where success lies.

[19:46] It lies in more mainstream themes.

[19:49] It lies in licensed themes that have larger audiences.

[19:53] It lies in themes that have contemporary audiences.

[19:56] They can't go back.

[19:58] They know now what Stern has always shown us

[20:01] is the way to succeed.

[20:02] This is what you need to succeed

[20:04] and grow Pimball companies.

[20:06] But they don't have the resources and the capacity

[20:10] to make games fast enough.

[20:12] They definitely know now what to give people

[20:14] to make the demand high.

[20:16] So it makes total sense that Chicago gaming company

[20:19] and Spooky would collaborate on this.

[20:22] Now the funny question is this.

[20:24] I mean, think about it.

[20:25] What collaboration is there?

[20:28] Like I don't get yet now how this partnership is working.

[20:32] Is it that Spooky owns the design of this Ben Heck game

[20:35] and they're lending it out to Chicago gaming?

[20:38] Will the manufacturing be,

[20:41] what roof will it take place under?

[20:43] Will it be made at CGC?

[20:45] Will it be made at Spooky?

[20:47] Is CGC there to make the cabinets and the play?

[20:50] I don't know.

[20:51] I don't know how the vision of labor will take place.

[20:54] But I think it makes total sense

[20:57] that some of these companies unite

[20:59] and combine forces and stop competing with each other

[21:04] and connect with each other to compete against Stern.

[21:08] Now another thing I forgot to mention is this.

[21:11] And if you don't think that Spooky Pimball

[21:13] is up the quality in the product versus Stern,

[21:17] the world's largest Pimball manufacturer,

[21:19] Stern Pimball, a lifestyle brand.

[21:21] Do me a favor people.

[21:22] Hilton's Rick and Morty has been played over a thousand times.

[21:27] All right, a thousand times out on location.

[21:30] And look at the game now.

[21:32] The play field still looks like glass.

[21:35] Very, very if any dimples at all in the game.

[21:39] It still looks like glass.

[21:41] Look at Stranger Things Pimball after over a hundred plays.

[21:46] Heck, after ten plays,

[21:48] a Stranger Things Pimball machine looks worse

[21:51] than Spooky Pimball's 1000 plays on Rick and Morty.

[21:55] And you tell me that we've blown play fields

[21:58] at a proportion that all the dimpling is BS.

[22:02] It's crap.

[22:03] You are getting a crappy quality Stern play field.

[22:09] What else proof do you need people?

[22:12] What else proof do you need?

[22:13] Why is a little company in Benton, Wisconsin

[22:17] giving you a better paint job and clear coat

[22:20] than the biggest company in the world?

[22:23] It's a joke.

[22:24] And I think Stern Pimball needs to up the play field game.

[22:27] And if people get Ninja Turtles and it's a dimplefest,

[22:32] people are gonna get tired of the crappy quality

[22:35] of Stern play fields.

[22:37] I still don't know how you rush to buy these Stern games.

[22:41] I really don't.

[22:42] And I'm not saying they're bad games.

[22:44] I just think the quality is embarrassing

[22:47] for the fact that they have the most resources

[22:49] to make these things the best.

[22:51] And a little company is just showing them how it's done.

[22:53] All right.

[22:55] Oh wow.

[22:55] What else is going on?

[22:56] Dutch Pimball.

[22:57] Dutch Pimball seems to be working it out.

[23:00] So if you look at Dutch recently,

[23:03] they're doing what I said I wanted them to do.

[23:05] They're uploading photos and videos of production.

[23:08] Have you seen the early achiever apron they're making now

[23:11] with the lights underneath it?

[23:12] Super cool.

[23:13] And it lights up with the light show.

[23:15] But here's what Barry needs to do.

[23:18] Is it Barry?

[23:18] No, it's Yop.

[23:19] Who's there now?

[23:20] It's Barry there right now, right?

[23:22] I get confused.

[23:23] Who's still there?

[23:24] Batman or Robin?

[23:25] What they need to do now?

[23:27] What they need to do now.

[23:28] It's Barry.

[23:29] What Barry needs to do now?

[23:30] He needs to finish this game.

[23:32] And I mean finish the coding of the game.

[23:34] And for people who have owned Big Lebowski,

[23:37] it's still an amazing world under glass.

[23:40] It's still one of the coolest games I've ever seen

[23:42] since I've been following Pimball.

[23:44] The problem with the game now is for a homeowner.

[23:47] The Big Lebowski is too shallow.

[23:50] And everyone who owns it knows that.

[23:52] So he needs to do that.

[23:54] And I think he needs to make spare parts

[23:56] readily available to everybody.

[23:58] And if he can keep going,

[24:00] I do think if he can keep going at this pace,

[24:03] I do think he will sell four to 500 at that price point.

[24:07] But what I think he needs to do,

[24:09] and this is just a lesson learned

[24:10] from Pirates the Caribbean and everything else.

[24:12] I think what Barry needs to do,

[24:13] as they think he needs to say,

[24:14] we're going to make this many and no more.

[24:17] I think the second he says we're only making

[24:19] 500 Big Lebowski's or 600,

[24:22] I think that is the day in which everyone goes in

[24:26] and buys one again,

[24:28] because they're just knowing that there's only that many,

[24:31] will it make the price that high?

[24:33] I don't know.

[24:33] There's just also such bad will around this game

[24:36] that I don't know if it's ever going to return.

[24:38] Going from a beautiful machine like the Big Lebowski

[24:41] to one of the ugliest Pimball machines I've ever seen.

[24:46] And we've seen some dogs people.

[24:48] We've seen some horrible, horrible dogs.

[24:51] We've seen October Fest was ugly.

[24:54] We've seen Thunderbirds ugly.

[24:57] We've seen Game of Thrones ugly.

[24:59] You know, Stern's gone through some amazing games

[25:02] and some ugly games.

[25:04] And then there's just this game.

[25:06] And that is Heavy Metal.

[25:08] Have you seen the atrocious art package

[25:12] that is Heavy Metal Pimball for 80, 200 bucks?

[25:17] It is one of the worst I've ever seen.

[25:20] And again, this game will always get a little bit

[25:22] of a pass because it's not a Stern game.

[25:25] It's a commission game.

[25:26] Come on, BS.

[25:28] This Stern, who do you think is helping

[25:31] Heavy Metal make this game?

[25:33] Stern Pimball.

[25:34] Who do you think is helping them with the art package?

[25:37] Stern Pimball.

[25:38] I mean, Stern Pimball's making this game.

[25:40] These license holders, they don't know

[25:43] didly squat about making a Pimball machine.

[25:46] So all of this is Stern guiding them through the process.

[25:50] The game looks like crap.

[25:52] It's not gonna sell.

[25:54] And if anyone buys this, the other game

[25:56] they have in their possession is most likely

[25:59] in a Vira Signature Edition.

[26:01] And yes, you're hearing it first from Canada.

[26:03] Canada's Pimball Podcast is telling you

[26:06] if you buy Heavy Metal with that crappy art,

[26:10] a re-skin game that costs no money using red dots

[26:14] for $8,200 bucks, you need to look in the mirror

[26:19] and say, I am a freaking moron

[26:22] because it is a moronic thing to buy this game.

[26:25] I mean, you can go get a freaking Hobbit,

[26:28] Ellie from Jersey Jack, for like $6,200 bucks.

[26:31] You're gonna spend $2,000 more on this.

[26:34] Now speaking of Hobbit for $6,200 bucks,

[26:37] somebody put up a post that said,

[26:39] why do Jersey Jack Pimball machines lose money faster

[26:42] than everybody else?

[26:43] Like why do New and Box Jersey Jack machines

[26:45] lose value faster?

[26:46] And the answer is simple, they don't.

[26:50] They're just more expensive.

[26:52] But almost every single game I'm seeing recently,

[26:56] every single game is losing value.

[26:59] Almost every single game I see now,

[27:02] after a year is losing $2,500 in value.

[27:08] And it makes sense.

[27:09] So a lot of the Jersey Jack games that were 9,000

[27:11] are readily available for $7,500, $7,000.

[27:16] And that's the drop.

[27:19] Now, Stern premiums, I think,

[27:20] maybe hold the value the best and Stern pros

[27:25] because the more expensive you are,

[27:27] the more likely you are to fall in value.

[27:30] Because if you want to find a buyer,

[27:33] you have less buyers at higher price points.

[27:35] It makes sense.

[27:35] Same thing in the real estate market.

[27:36] It's always the multi-million dollar apartments

[27:38] that have a harder time moving

[27:40] than the $1 million apartments

[27:42] or the half a million dollar apartments.

[27:44] But I think the whole industry,

[27:46] if we're to be completely honest,

[27:48] the whole industry right now is at an oversaturation level.

[27:52] And it doesn't help.

[27:53] It doesn't help that you've got the economy,

[27:56] which is now being hurt significantly

[27:59] by the coronavirus.

[28:01] It's also, you know, it's laughing because

[28:03] the coronavirus and Texas Pimball Festival

[28:05] don't go together.

[28:07] You look at how to keep yourself healthy

[28:09] during the coronavirus.

[28:10] It's like, don't come in contact

[28:12] where other people have been and wash your hands.

[28:15] And it's like, well, the Pimball Machine

[28:16] is the worst toy possible.

[28:20] And if you're playing at a Pimball Festival

[28:22] in which hundreds, there's eight to 10,000 people

[28:25] who are strangers, who are using Pimball Machines

[28:29] and not washing their hands,

[28:30] which is what happens at Pimball shows.

[28:33] It is probably the last place you should find yourself

[28:36] is on a Pimball Machine,

[28:37] if you're trying to prevent yourself

[28:38] from getting the coronavirus.

[28:40] But with the economy going down,

[28:42] with the amount of titles that are out there,

[28:44] with the never-ending sort of releases of games,

[28:48] and the lack of space,

[28:50] I, again, I just think you're gonna see games going down

[28:54] and down and down,

[28:55] and the only games that will hold value.

[28:58] The only games that will hold value

[29:00] are games in which there are not many of them.

[29:04] So it is a market place in which only scarcity

[29:08] will maintain a game's value.

[29:11] I mean, there's a reason why I bought

[29:13] a Batman super limited edition,

[29:15] only 200 in the world.

[29:17] I paid 15,000 for it.

[29:20] I sold it a year and a half later for 16.5.

[29:23] Two reasons, only 200 in the world.

[29:26] And I had a Playfield protector on it

[29:28] that made the game perfect.

[29:30] Because those games look like crap.

[29:32] The Playfield's dimple like crap.

[29:34] But again, if they made 2000 Batman super limited editions,

[29:39] then not so much.

[29:41] And I think that's one of the issues Jack has with his games

[29:44] is he's always made too many editions of each game.

[29:48] And even though still to this day,

[29:50] the nicest Pimball Machine that Jack has ever made

[29:54] is the direct screen printed Wizard of Oz

[29:57] Emerald City edition.

[29:59] It's to this day that's still the most beautiful

[30:01] Jersey Jack machine of all time.

[30:03] He just made so many of them.

[30:05] And now you don't really, you know,

[30:06] you don't even like, you don't even know.

[30:08] Like is it that one?

[30:09] Is it the, is it the Yellow brick road edition one?

[30:12] Is it the Ruby Red edition?

[30:14] He's made too many.

[30:16] He's made too many.

[30:17] And getting a Waz is so easy.

[30:20] I mean, think about like this.

[30:20] If there's say there's 5,000 Wizard of Oz is out there.

[30:24] Well, you, you know, there's only 750 Rick and Morty's.

[30:28] So no matter how much better the game is,

[30:31] if you want to get one,

[30:33] it's just always going to be harder to get a Rick and Morty.

[30:36] And that is why it pires the care of being

[30:37] in collector's edition will always hold value

[30:39] because there will always only be 200.

[30:42] Now, I wish Jack would tell us the real number

[30:44] of Wanka collector's editions.

[30:46] There's no way he's making and selling 500.

[30:49] And I heard the number again is closer to 200.

[30:52] And so we'll see.

[30:54] And if he makes Willy Wonka collectors edition 200

[30:57] and let's say he said tomorrow,

[30:59] we're only, you know, we've made 200 of them.

[31:01] Distributors have some of them.

[31:03] That's all we're ever going to make

[31:05] of Willy Wonka collectors edition.

[31:06] You know what happens?

[31:08] In a week, they all sell out.

[31:10] They all sell out.

[31:11] And that's it.

[31:12] But if he keeps, you know,

[31:13] again, they're not selling out now because 500,

[31:15] there's not, there's not demand for 500.

[31:17] What else is going on in the world of pinball?

[31:19] So American pinball has released a teaser image.

[31:24] Are you ready for something hot?

[31:27] Now, maybe they're trying to make a joke

[31:29] of the Hot Wheels reveal.

[31:30] But I know, I almost know for fact it's going to be Hot Wheels.

[31:35] But I'm here to tell you something

[31:37] and then I'm going to end this show.

[31:38] You know, Canada, I like to end it

[31:39] with a little bit of a rumor or speculation.

[31:42] But this is something that I'm hearing

[31:44] is going to be what you see

[31:47] when you see this game for the first time.

[31:49] You are used to, what are you used to

[31:51] with American pinball games?

[31:53] You're used to games that are packed with features,

[31:57] with magnets, with ramps, with scoops,

[32:00] with revolving doors, with cannon shots

[32:04] down the play field.

[32:05] American pinball has given you jam-packed games

[32:10] for $7,500.

[32:12] And it has a lot of you thinking

[32:15] that if they get a theme like Hot Wheels,

[32:18] that you're going to get another jam-packed game

[32:21] for $7,500.

[32:23] But I'll tell you, prepare to probably be disappointed.

[32:28] And the reason why is simple.

[32:30] They sank so much money into two games that failed.

[32:36] They failed horribly.

[32:37] They failed horribly when it came to sales.

[32:40] They failed horribly when it came to theme and art

[32:43] and the games didn't sell.

[32:45] And the way it works in business

[32:48] is you invest in your third property,

[32:52] the leftover profits from games one and two.

[32:56] There are none from game one and two.

[32:58] So I think what you're gonna see from American pinball

[33:01] is one step forward in terms of a theme

[33:04] that is finally a licensed theme,

[33:07] but what you're going to see,

[33:09] and I think it's going to disappoint,

[33:11] is I think you're gonna see two steps back

[33:13] in what you expect from them

[33:15] in terms of a fully featured game.

[33:18] And that is unfortunate.

[33:20] And I still to this day,

[33:22] I don't know who is taking accountability.

[33:25] And who said, let's make October Fest.

[33:29] Why did they do that game?

[33:32] Why did they make that game?

[33:33] Your sophomore title is your most important title

[33:37] when you're a brand new company.

[33:39] Not your first.

[33:40] You gotta get your feet wet.

[33:42] It's your soft morric game that matters most.

[33:46] And I also don't think American pinball

[33:48] is gonna go out of business.

[33:50] People keep saying to me,

[33:52] well that's it, then they're done,

[33:53] but they're not done because they're not

[33:55] a real standalone pinball company.

[33:59] They are like a subsidiary of Amtron,

[34:02] which is a multi-million dollar successful company.

[34:06] And they're making their games inside Amtron's factory.

[34:09] You see what I'm saying?

[34:10] This is like a pet project for,

[34:12] it's like Dovel's uncle's company.

[34:15] This isn't, again, when companies don't operate normally,

[34:20] same thing with Jersey Jack.

[34:21] It's like they got bailed out.

[34:23] Like yeah, Jersey Jack would have gone under three times

[34:26] in a row with like three fumbled launches.

[34:30] The thing is this, American pinball,

[34:33] they're in transformation right now.

[34:35] They need help.

[34:37] They need to rethink what they're doing.

[34:39] And if this game comes out,

[34:41] amidst Ninja Turtles and Deep Root

[34:45] and Rick and Morty and all these new games coming out,

[34:49] if it's got 90 days,

[34:52] it's got 90 days.

[34:54] And here's the other part.

[34:55] If they rock up to Texas pinball festival

[34:58] and they don't have games on the line

[35:00] and games in boxes,

[35:01] they're going to be in big trouble.

[35:04] And I'm just worried

[35:06] that Hot Wheels is not the theme

[35:08] that is going to have this 90 days hype window.

[35:12] I mean, look at Stranger Things.

[35:14] They still haven't sold out of L-leas.

[35:17] Stranger Things is the most popular Netflix show

[35:21] of all time, has tens of millions of fans.

[35:24] And they can't even get enough hype

[35:26] to sell enough of those games.

[35:29] I mean, Stranger Things is going to go down again.

[35:31] It's, again, it's not a horrible game.

[35:33] It's not this amazing game.

[35:35] It's just eh.

[35:37] It's just eh.

[35:38] It's middle of the road.

[35:39] And even with that power of that theme,

[35:42] it's not driving the excitement

[35:44] that Stern thought it would.

[35:46] And you're telling me Hot Wheels.

[35:49] It's not even in the same ballpark.

[35:50] It's not even in the same zip code

[35:53] as a Stranger Things theme.

[35:55] And I just think it's, I don't know.

[35:57] I'm worried.

[35:58] And again, I don't mean to brag.

[36:01] But I told those guys over there

[36:03] like a year and a half ago,

[36:05] I would happily help them figure out a theme

[36:08] that would work in Pimball.

[36:09] And they never got back to me.

[36:11] And it's their loss, not mine.

[36:12] Because they have so much money on the line

[36:14] and they need to get their, they need to get their SHIT

[36:17] in order.

[36:18] All right, everybody.

[36:19] Here's the deal.

[36:20] Here's the deal.

[36:21] I'm still mending.

[36:22] I'm still recovering.

[36:24] I'm not going to do the number of shows I have

[36:27] in the past over the next couple weeks

[36:29] as I get better.

[36:30] I also want to thank all of you out there.

[36:32] And I have, I know I haven't gotten back to each

[36:34] of you personally.

[36:36] Everyone out there who's reached out to me,

[36:39] who said, feel better, who said, like, you know,

[36:41] I know how painful that injury is.

[36:44] I want to thank each and every one of you

[36:47] for reaching out to me.

[36:48] If you haven't reached out to me, it's cool.

[36:50] I know some of you aren't on Facebook,

[36:52] which is also really cool.

[36:53] The key to happiness in life is staying off of Facebook.

[36:57] I just want to let you know that I'm not gone.

[36:59] I didn't leave you by choice.

[37:02] And I think that you listen to the show.

[37:04] And I know that when I look at the numbers,

[37:06] even though a week and a half has gone by,

[37:09] we're still going to be right up there at the top

[37:11] with Canadian Spinball podcast.

[37:13] And that's all because of you.

[37:14] So thank you for listening to the show

[37:16] and putting up with my crazy observations

[37:18] in the pinball world.

[37:19] Have a great day, everybody.

[37:20] We'll talk to you soon.

[37:22] Oh, what a beautiful day.
