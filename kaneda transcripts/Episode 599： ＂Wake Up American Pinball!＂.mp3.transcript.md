[00:00] [♪ INTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:16] Welcome everybody to episode 599 of Canadian Pimball Podcasts, Money for Nothing.

[00:22] Money for nothing we live in a Pimball World now, where you can actually show zero gameplay

[00:28] and sell 1,750 games.

[00:32] We're going to talk about that.

[00:33] We're going to talk about American Pimball and what their next title is rumored to be is Ben

[00:39] Heck correct.

[00:40] Did they pull a fast one on Canada when they confirmed for me that it would not be Riot Pimball's

[00:47] Legends of Vahala?

[00:49] Did they simply change the name of the exact same game?

[00:53] We're going to talk about that.

[00:55] We're going to talk about a little bit of a Jersey Jack Toy Story rumor.

[00:59] Not really that much of a breakthrough there that you might not see the game this year.

[01:03] We'll talk about that.

[01:04] We'll talk about Chicago Gaming Company.

[01:07] And where are they?

[01:08] Where they've been hiding all this time.

[01:10] It's been almost like two or three years since Monster Bash was revealed.

[01:14] It's about time they revealed the worst kept secret in Pimball, which is Cactus Canyon

[01:19] remake.

[01:20] When are we going to get that?

[01:21] It is the middle of July people.

[01:24] We're almost at August, which means Keith Lwynn's next game is September.

[01:29] We're like two months away from a new Keith Lwynn Pimball machine and all of the conversation

[01:34] and all of the attention is going to go towards Keith Lwynn's next game because you know

[01:41] and I know it's the big one and I always say that but this time it's going to be true

[01:47] I think so.

[01:48] And also we want to congratulate Stern Pimball on getting all of these Mandalorian Ellie's

[01:53] out the door.

[01:54] It's really incredible when you see how Stern Pimball can take orders on 750 Mandalorian

[02:02] Ellie's and within a week or two every single person has their game.

[02:08] Every single person I see the unboxings happening left and right.

[02:12] This is why Stern Pimball just dominates.

[02:16] By the time you actually have time to study the game and see if there's anything in it

[02:20] you love or hate.

[02:22] It doesn't matter.

[02:23] It's in your house.

[02:24] They've taken your money and you've got the game and guess what?

[02:28] When it comes to buying a toy, the greatest moment is actually being able to be in possession

[02:34] of that toy.

[02:36] It's like imagine if it was Christmas morning and everyone in America got the next

[02:40] deep root Pimball machine and every kid is opening up nothing.

[02:44] You have to give people the toys.

[02:47] Stern Pimball at the top of their list, how do we dominate in this industry?

[02:51] Let's actually get people product with a novel idea.

[02:56] Let's start a Pimball company and actually ship people games so when they order it they

[03:01] get to unbox it within the first few months of buying it.

[03:05] That's amazing.

[03:06] Would you buy a TV and wait 18 months for it?

[03:10] Would you buy a car and wait a year for it?

[03:14] No.

[03:15] Stern Pimball is the only one that understands that principle that when you buy an unnecessary

[03:20] item, the faster you get it, the better.

[03:25] There's a lot of Mandalorian LEDs for sale.

[03:28] There's a lot of scalpers and flippers with this game and I think people should have

[03:31] done what the early flippers did and that is sell it before people even saw it.

[03:37] These things were going for 13 to $14,000 and I'm starting to see the prices come back

[03:43] down to around $11,000, $11,500, $12,000.

[03:48] Even more and more then we'll go up for sale.

[03:50] $750 is a lot and once Mandalorian premium starts to ship, then the early prices will go

[03:57] down even more.

[03:59] There's just a lot of machines coming out but these games have held strong.

[04:03] Don't get me wrong.

[04:04] The Pimball market has held much stronger than the cryptocurrency market.

[04:09] So speaking about the market, I wanted to start out this podcast by talking about

[04:13] spooky Pimball and their new titles, Ultraman and Halloween.

[04:18] And these games have now been on sale for about a little over a week and people have given

[04:23] their deposits and they had an extraordinary sales day in which 1,750 games were spoken

[04:29] for.

[04:30] And without seeing any gameplay footage, without seeing anything on the screen, without

[04:35] hearing any callouts, without seeing if the game is clunky or has flow, 1,750 games were

[04:43] spoken for by both consumers and distributors.

[04:47] Now I want to say right now, if you've solved this many games and you have your customers

[04:52] lined up, why would they show gameplay footage now?

[04:56] And I said this on a Facebook live and I want to say this right now, I think streaming

[05:00] a game and showing people what's in it is an absolute sure fire way to absolutely spoil

[05:08] everything that's in the game.

[05:10] And imagine if you're spooky Pimball right now, why would you bother streaming the game

[05:14] now?

[05:15] Why would you bother showing people what's in the game when all the games are spoken for?

[05:20] What benefit to them does it have to stream the game now?

[05:24] The deposits were non-refundable, you can't back out of your order.

[05:29] So if they show the game now, you are going to do maybe a few things.

[05:33] One thing is you're going to spoil what's in the game for some people that want to unbox

[05:38] it and be surprised when they play the game for the first time.

[05:42] You are also maybe going to excite people who bought the game and see the clips from Halloween

[05:47] and Ultraman and they get excited.

[05:49] So you could argue that the reason why you want to stream it is that people have a long

[05:53] wait to get their games and you might as well excite them with this.

[05:57] Okay, I understand that.

[05:59] You could also argue that you want to show people the game in the right way, but we all

[06:02] know this.

[06:03] But no pinball machine actually streams nearly as well and the experience of watching a

[06:09] machine being streamed is not nearly as exciting as playing the machine itself.

[06:15] I would argue that the translation of playing a pinball machine to streaming one as a mechanism

[06:21] to excite you about the game almost always falls flat.

[06:26] There's no way you can do it.

[06:27] There's no way you can do it.

[06:28] There's no way you can stream guns and roses and accurately display for someone what

[06:34] it's actually like to stand over that game when that music is blasting and that light

[06:39] show is going.

[06:40] There's no way to capture it.

[06:42] So the same will be true with this game.

[06:43] The same is true with Mandalorian.

[06:45] You just can't convey how exciting a game is via a stream.

[06:49] Now what a stream can do is show you if the game has flowed to show you if there's combos

[06:53] to see how easy it is to hit the shots.

[06:56] You can see the way the mechs work.

[06:58] So that stuff does come through well in a stream.

[07:01] But why stream it if you're spooky?

[07:03] I think spooky should in stream this machine or both of these machines.

[07:07] I think they should actually let the first customers have an amazing surprising delight

[07:12] moment in which they get to unbox it and experience for the first time all of those clips, all

[07:18] of those shots, all of the flow.

[07:20] But they're going to stream it.

[07:21] I know they're talking a Jack Danger so we're going to see this game soon.

[07:25] But there is something that happened with the great success of this spooky launch that

[07:29] should have each and every one of us somewhat concerned.

[07:33] Here's my concern about all of this and it's not just spooky.

[07:37] It's the current state of pinball sales and how they are developing.

[07:42] Stern Pinball can sell out 750 Mandalorians before a single person sees a single thing about

[07:49] the game.

[07:50] The pinball won up that and sells 1,750 games before we've seen a single ball flip.

[07:58] You have no idea what's in the game.

[08:01] You have no idea if the game shoots well.

[08:04] You have no idea if it's clunky.

[08:06] You have no idea if it's smooth.

[08:08] You have no idea what the assets are.

[08:10] You have no idea what the display looks like.

[08:12] You have no idea about anything.

[08:14] We are now in a world in which if you simply have a theme that is exciting.

[08:19] I would argue that you don't even need a theme that is very exciting.

[08:23] Ultraman, come on people.

[08:25] Let's be fully honest right now.

[08:27] I'm glad they sold the games.

[08:29] But Ultraman was nowhere near on anyone's top 100 themes we can't wait to see in pinball.

[08:35] If I had done a survey of the top 100 themes you would love to see in a pinball machine,

[08:41] Ultraman wouldn't even make the list and yet it was still spoken for in one day.

[08:47] So it doesn't even matter so much about theme if it's licensed, if the art is good and

[08:53] the company is reputable, it doesn't really matter.

[08:57] And Stern's been experiencing this kind of success for years.

[09:01] But the downside of this ability to move product quickly with a licensed theme before anyone

[09:08] sees anything just because you're limiting the amount of games you're going to make.

[09:13] And that's what spooky did.

[09:14] The problem with all of this is what's the incentive from the manufacturer to actually

[09:20] make the game worthwhile.

[09:22] And again, this is not a knock on any specific company but this kind of instant sellout behavior.

[09:28] If you're a manufacturer you start to realize well we don't have to put as much in these

[09:33] games.

[09:34] We don't have to go as far as we normally would.

[09:37] We don't have to impress beyond a certain point because if we're selling at this why would

[09:43] we put more in?

[09:44] And this is where Stern Pimball's been for many many years now.

[09:48] You go look at a game like Simpsons and Lord of the Rings and you look at a modern Stern

[09:53] and you realize they've been stripping stuff out of these games for years.

[09:57] They've been lowering the amount of money they've been investing on what's physically

[10:01] in the games.

[10:03] And they've so geniusly put better artwork and more stuff on a screen and much less

[10:10] into the games and significantly raise the prices of these Pimball machines and they sell

[10:16] out on day one.

[10:18] And so I'm concerned that this is where Pimball currently is at.

[10:22] And Spooky Pimball got to taste and take a bite from the Stern Apple with these launches

[10:27] because it's the same formula and it works time and time again.

[10:32] All you need is something people know, a beautiful art package and you make it limited

[10:39] and you're going to have an incredible sales day unless you totally mess up on some aspect

[10:46] of the game.

[10:47] But there is a fourth element to that and that is good will with the community and that

[10:51] is people trust you and respect you.

[10:55] And that is why we didn't see stuff like Hot Wheels sell as well as Ultra Man.

[11:00] I mean isn't that crazy?

[11:02] If I were to tell you which would make for a more fun Pimball experience like a year

[11:06] and a half ago if I were to blindfold you and say imagine a Hot Wheels Pimball machine

[11:11] versus an Ultra Man Pimball machine.

[11:14] Which do you think would sell better to the US Pimball Buying community?

[11:19] Even the global Pimball Buying community, everybody would have said Hot Wheels but that

[11:23] wasn't the case.

[11:25] Hot Wheels probably hasn't even sold 500 units today.

[11:29] So I just want to say I'm happy for Spooky.

[11:32] I'm happy for Spooky that they got these sales numbers but what is happening in Pimball

[11:37] now isn't something that consumers and us Pimball people should really be celebrating

[11:43] because on some level this is going to push companies to probably do less because they're

[11:49] making money before we even see it.

[11:52] And I think all of us next year when there's all these titles coming out there's going

[11:57] to come a day where this is going to end right.

[12:00] This is just throwing money at every single new Pimball venture that happens.

[12:05] Throwing money at anything J.J.P., Spooky and Stern releases like anything they put out

[12:10] will be successful.

[12:12] Take my money now.

[12:14] At some point it will come to an end.

[12:15] You have to understand this.

[12:17] It will come to an end.

[12:18] The prices are so high that no one's even questioning this stuff.

[12:22] And it makes a hypocrite of all of us right.

[12:24] We're all like oh we shouldn't buy it unless it's a dream theme.

[12:27] Ultraman okay sold out.

[12:28] I mean it's like what are we all doing and I bought one.

[12:31] And I never even said Ultraman was like a dream theme of mine.

[12:34] It's not but it's just cool and I kind of want it.

[12:38] Maybe that's just all that boils down to.

[12:40] It's just a toy.

[12:41] It's like if you want it you want it.

[12:43] And we don't need to overanalyze it.

[12:45] And I think some of us are experiencing some of that as well.

[12:48] We're just into it.

[12:49] We're just into Pimball.

[12:51] And we've waited months for new Pimball machines and when a new one comes out it doesn't

[12:55] matter all the mental strength we think we have.

[12:58] We don't we don't most of us you and me if you love Pimball and you have some money

[13:04] set aside that you could buy silly things you don't need like Pimball machines all of

[13:09] our mental toughness all of the stuff we say we're going to do it all goes out the window

[13:15] the moment a new game is revealed and it happens time and time again.

[13:20] And maybe instead of saying we're going to be different next time we're going to put

[13:24] our foot down and only buy dream themes.

[13:26] We're going to put our foot down and only buy a game if it's got mechanical magic in

[13:30] it.

[13:31] We're only going to buy a game if it's filled with Pimball moments that are unbelievable.

[13:35] We're all hypocrites we're all liars it doesn't matter just put a theme in front of me

[13:39] with some nice artwork and tell me that I might not be able to get it because it's

[13:43] limited and there's a great chance you're going to sell out in one day.

[13:47] That's where Pimball is at.

[13:48] Now spooky Pimball is having a little bit of a delay in getting people what number

[13:53] game they are.

[13:55] Like if you ordered this game right now you have no idea in my number one or twelve

[13:59] fifty they don't know.

[14:01] I did hear from some distributors that the way they did it with the three different

[14:05] models actually made it a little bit more confusing.

[14:09] Next time with spooky might think about doing is just say how many are there going to

[14:13] be of C.E.s blood sucker additions and standard additions because it's creating a little

[14:19] bit of a nightmare for them probably figuring all of this out.

[14:23] We've got to figure out 1750 orders and there's three tiers so that's a lot harder to

[14:29] do than just you know everyone's got a Rick and Morty and here's a different order

[14:34] sheet.

[14:35] So I hope people know what number game they are soon and that's going to tell people

[14:38] how long the wait is you know are you going to be waiting a few months or you're going

[14:42] to be waiting over a year so we will find out hopefully soon and hopefully soon we'll

[14:46] see the game streamed.

[14:48] So American Pimball right they're like the complete opposite of spooky Pimball.

[14:52] Now I would argue that American Pimball has put more into their games than any spooky

[14:58] game to date except for maybe Hot Wheels but if you look at Houdini and you look at October

[15:04] Fest it's always been somewhat perplexing to all of us.

[15:08] Why is American Pimball just failed to click with the Pimball buying audience?

[15:14] It's almost like they think they're doing the right thing.

[15:17] It's almost like because they're on the forums they think they're giving people what

[15:21] they want but what they always fail to realize is there's a method and a formula to creating

[15:27] sales success for your organization.

[15:30] Now I'm about to give American Pimball some good advice and I think they're going to take

[15:35] this advice and I'm also going to tell you why this company has failed so horribly over

[15:40] the years.

[15:41] First and foremost the number one thing you need to create to sell Pimball machines in

[15:46] modern day is FOMO, the fear of missing out.

[15:52] Stern does it, spooky does it, everyone successful does it, CGC does it, we're only going to make

[15:59] this number of games.

[16:02] This is how many we're going to make.

[16:04] What is the one thing that American Pimball has never done on any of their titles?

[16:10] They have never said we're only making this many games.

[16:14] The biggest mistake they ever made was this.

[16:16] They only needed to sell 1000 Houdinis to consider a success.

[16:21] So what did they do?

[16:23] They said we're going to make unlimited amounts of Houdini.

[16:27] So the moment you hear that there is no urgency for you to go buy that game because you're

[16:31] like well I could just order this game a year from now.

[16:33] I could order this game six months from now.

[16:36] I'll just wait to play it at shows and on location and there's absolutely no urgency

[16:41] to get this game.

[16:42] Now if they said we're only going to make 1000 Houdinis ever and that's it, they would

[16:47] have done much better with it but they didn't do that.

[16:51] So they kept the order banks open and they barely sold.

[16:54] They did the same exact thing with October Fest and arguably two themes that nobody wants.

[17:00] So you think about this right now.

[17:02] We've got two themes that nobody really wants.

[17:05] We've created no FOMO.

[17:07] There's no limited nature to our product and guess what?

[17:12] Sales, failure after sales, failure and they did the same exact thing with Hot Wheels.

[17:18] They didn't limit the number of Hot Wheels.

[17:20] They tried to create FOMO by saying I think it was like the first 250 games will get a

[17:26] free shaker motor.

[17:28] Shaker motor, I just want to shake these guys up.

[17:31] Do you really think that a shaker motor installation is how you're going to create a sense of urgency

[17:36] and demand for the product?

[17:38] It doesn't work and it didn't work and three times in a row this company has made games

[17:44] that people just don't want.

[17:46] Now the sad part is this.

[17:48] They put so much into those first two games and the build quality of American Pimball

[17:54] games is stellar, phenomenal build quality.

[17:57] I would argue that they might be building the highest quality games in Pimball and I never

[18:03] hear people complain about the quality of their products.

[18:07] I don't hear people complain about the quality of the play fields.

[18:10] I don't hear people say anything about AP quality.

[18:15] It's always so frustrating in this hobby.

[18:17] How it's always a compromise, right?

[18:19] Why are the best quality products wrapped in games that nobody wants?

[18:24] It's so annoying like why can't Jersey Jack have the quality of American Pimball?

[18:30] Can you imagine if those two things came together?

[18:32] A man can only dream.

[18:34] So here we are, right?

[18:36] Here we are on the verge of AP's next title and what did I just say?

[18:40] You have to have FOMO, you have to limit the amount of games you're going to make but

[18:44] you also need a theme that people want.

[18:47] Now I'm hearing that the next game is going to be Legends of Vahala.

[18:52] I'm hearing that they're renaming it into like rampage, quest for Vahala or something.

[18:57] I know rampage is the main title of the game.

[19:01] Let's talk about that for a minute.

[19:02] Why would you if you're American Pimball?

[19:05] And you know that theme sells.

[19:08] You know that you got to give people something where there's some connection to it.

[19:13] There's some fan base out in the world.

[19:15] There's some emotional appeal to this thing.

[19:18] Why would you knowing that, seeing how your first two games sold and even how your license

[19:25] game sold, why would you go back and make an original game based on Vikings right now?

[19:35] How can you sit in the American Pimball board room right now and say we're going to go

[19:39] up against the Mandalorian Ultraman which is a multi-billion dollar franchise, Halloween

[19:45] which has like 40 plus years of fandom and the horror community loves Halloween.

[19:51] We're going to go up against that potentially Godzilla.

[19:54] We're going to go up against Led Zeppelin and Guns and Roses.

[19:58] We're going to take down these games and we're going to get sales in this marketplace

[20:02] with wait for it drum roll rampage quest for Vahala.

[20:09] How do you do that?

[20:10] And they've had over a year to plan what this game is going to be.

[20:14] Now look, I could be wrong.

[20:15] I could be completely wrong and it might not be that game.

[20:19] But we know that the next game is not licensed and just right there that is the colossal mistake.

[20:27] We can't launch unlicensed games in 2021 that have absolutely no following.

[20:36] Cactus Canyon has a following.

[20:38] People know about Cactus Canyon and Monster Bash and all those old games.

[20:42] People know about them.

[20:44] There's at least a built-in fanbase from Pimball fanatics.

[20:47] There's nobody that wakes up and says, you know what?

[20:51] I'm really upset with myself that I missed out on Rath of Olympus.

[20:56] Or I'm really upset with myself that I never got Legends of Vahala from Riot Pimball.

[21:01] You know, no one is waking up and saying, you know what?

[21:04] I wish I got Celts or I wish I got Cosmic Carnival.

[21:08] And the list just goes on and on and on of pretty much almost every single modern day original

[21:15] theme has failed.

[21:17] Kyle Dinn was also a sales failure.

[21:20] If you look at what they put into it, it was a sales failure for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[21:25] It was not successful for them.

[21:27] It did not do the numbers they needed it to do.

[21:30] The only one that was successful was TNA.

[21:33] TNA was not on a mission to sell a thousand units.

[21:37] And only Spooky could put a game like TNA into the marketplace and make it work for them

[21:43] on a financial level.

[21:45] But even Spooky has moved away from original games like TNA.

[21:49] So here's what I think is going to happen.

[21:50] I think a few things.

[21:51] I think American Pimball is going to come out with this Vikings Rampage game.

[21:56] I do think they're going to have a limited edition version of the game.

[22:01] You're going to see them adopt a two to three tier system in which they're going to

[22:05] try to create FOMO for this title.

[22:08] Now the hard part is going to be this.

[22:10] If it is Legends of Vahala.

[22:12] It is also a game that almost everyone in this community has seen for a very long time.

[22:19] Now most of us have not played it.

[22:21] So the game play will be fresh, but the game itself will not.

[22:24] I'm also hearing from my sources that two steps from hell was higher to do the music sound

[22:30] package on the game.

[22:32] Are you guys fans of two steps from hell?

[22:35] Never heard of them.

[22:36] Never heard of them.

[22:37] So that's not going to be another thing that pulls in a bunch of people to the game.

[22:41] So let's see what happens, but I'm here to tell you right now.

[22:44] Canada is going to predict that this will be AP's next game.

[22:48] Now the question is when are they going to come out with this game?

[22:51] And what are they waiting for every week they wait to show this game I think is a mistake

[22:57] because money is going in other directions.

[23:00] The moment we hit August 1st, I'm telling you what's going to happen.

[23:04] Two things are going to happen.

[23:06] The Kaggo gaming company is going to get cactus canyon remake out at the end of July

[23:11] early August.

[23:12] So that is going to happen and that is going to make it harder for American Pimball to sell

[23:17] this title.

[23:18] The other thing that's going to happen is this the moment we hit August August is a

[23:23] slower month for everybody.

[23:25] You're going on vacation.

[23:26] You're spending more money with your family.

[23:29] COVID is starting to ease up a little bit where people are getting back out there.

[23:33] On August things will slow down and I think the entire mindset of the Pimball world is going

[23:40] to be on one thing and one thing only.

[23:43] We are very, very close to Keith LWIN's next game.

[23:49] And Keith LWIN isn't just another designer.

[23:52] He's something special people and we know it.

[23:55] You know, he's like when a new Tarantino movie came out.

[23:58] It wasn't just like another movie.

[24:00] You know, I would say like Keith LWIN is kind of like the Christopher Nolan of the Pimball

[24:05] world is that when he makes something, people pay attention more than anybody else.

[24:10] I would argue that right now in the Pimball world without a doubt Keith LWIN is the number

[24:16] one Pimball designer in the world.

[24:19] He is designing games that excite the most people in the Pimball world.

[24:23] He's three for three on his Pimball machines.

[24:27] And I look at the stern climate over the years and I look at what games people are loving.

[24:31] I think Jurassic Park is at the top of that list.

[24:34] I know people voted Iron Maiden to be number one, but if I'm looking at LWIN's portfolio

[24:39] right now, Jurassic Park number one, then I would put Iron Maiden and then Avengers.

[24:46] But here's a thing.

[24:47] It's not like there's a dog anywhere in that mix.

[24:50] Like there's no bad games.

[24:53] And what people love about Keith LWIN games, you know, I don't even have to tell you.

[24:56] But he designs his games from the ground up to shoot tremendously well.

[25:01] He has a tremendous ability to get the most out of the stern bomb.

[25:05] He designs the rule sets in his games with that in mind as he's designing the game.

[25:12] And that is such an important element that a lot of games don't have.

[25:16] His games feel more synchronized than most other games out there.

[25:21] He's also got on his team a dude called Zambi Yeti.

[25:26] So you've got Keith LWIN and Zambi Yeti making what is going to be a game that everyone

[25:33] knows is going to have a higher bomb in it, less restrictions on the designer.

[25:40] And this is a statement game I am hearing from Keith LWIN.

[25:44] Keith LWIN reached out to me when Avengers came out and said, you haven't seen anything

[25:51] yet.

[25:52] Just wait to see my next game.

[25:54] Why would he tell Canada that?

[25:56] And it is the last person on Planet Earth you would ever want to say something like that

[26:01] to because when you say that to me, it almost makes me want to just skip Avengers altogether

[26:06] and wait.

[26:07] So come August, the storyline in pinball will be how beautiful the cactus canyon remake

[26:15] is, which it will be.

[26:16] But the real storyline will be what's next from stern pinball, what's next from Keith

[26:22] LWIN, and we can't wait to see it.

[26:25] This is why without stern pinball, this hobby becomes so boring.

[26:29] Can you imagine if stern was an in pinball and it would just be like one spooky game or

[26:33] two every 18 months, one Jersey Jack game every two years, I love that stern pinball never

[26:40] stops coming with stuff, right?

[26:42] They never stop coming with stuff.

[26:45] If it wasn't for them, you and I would both be very bored covering this hobby.

[26:50] There couldn't really even be pinball podcasts without stern.

[26:54] There couldn't be.

[26:55] There wouldn't be pinball YouTube channels really without stern.

[26:58] Without stern pinball's constant delivering of stuff, it would get really stale really

[27:04] fast.

[27:05] And look, do I wish stern put more into their games so that their games were more magical

[27:10] I do?

[27:11] Do I wish stern games had a longer shelf life than what I mean by that is I don't really

[27:15] think they're creating tons of masterpieces, they're not for the amount of games they

[27:19] make.

[27:20] They don't really make that many masterpieces.

[27:23] That's also why it's exciting to follow stern because with every new release, we always

[27:27] hope that this is going to be the one that blows us away, this is going to be the master

[27:32] piece, this is going to be their latest Lord of the Rings, 10 years from now we're never

[27:37] going to get sick of playing this game, that is what people want with every new stern

[27:42] release.

[27:43] And I will say it, what we really want is a game that plays as good as Ghostbusters looks.

[27:49] That's really it.

[27:50] Ghostbusters is that world under glass.

[27:53] We just want a game that plays as good and has the longevity that Ghostbusters does not

[28:00] have.

[28:01] I'm sorry, I will never get over how bad Ghostbusters shoots.

[28:05] Imagine if Keith L and did Ghostbusters with Zambi Eddie's art package on that game,

[28:09] we would all be spending $20,000 right now to try to find an Ellie somewhere.

[28:14] That's how amazing that game would have been.

[28:16] Throwing an LCD with Ghostbusters as well and forget it, it would be unobtainium.

[28:21] I mean that's what's going to happen, so like the window is closed on American pinball

[28:25] again and it couldn't be a worst time for them to release a pinball machine.

[28:31] I just want these guys to get their act together.

[28:33] I really do, because like I said I think they make one of the highest quality pinball

[28:38] machines.

[28:39] We know they can stuff a ton of mechanical wow stuff into their games, like the milkans

[28:45] shot on Houdini that fires the ball all the way down the play field, that's cooler than

[28:50] anything I've seen in most modern pinball machines.

[28:53] They've got the potential, but they just need to execute it right.

[28:57] And I think they're once again going to have the timing off.

[29:01] I think they're going to have the theme off and I think they're going to struggle here.

[29:05] And then I'm hearing the next game is going to be a Joe Balser game that Dennis Norman is

[29:11] going to help finish.

[29:13] Why are we going back to a Joe Balser design if you cut him loose?

[29:18] And I hear it's also probably not going to be a licensed game, but they're thinking

[29:23] about putting a license on top of it.

[29:26] Come on guys, come on AP.

[29:28] I am rooting for you.

[29:29] I am rooting for you and this is hard love in.

[29:32] It's hard love in guys because what's crazy to me is that you would even start a pinball

[29:37] company without understanding how to sell games.

[29:40] How can you go down this road and do all this hard work AP?

[29:44] You are able to put games in boxes.

[29:47] If you can get to that point, you should be making millions a year selling pinball machines.

[29:53] Your games should be flipping for more money than they're worth.

[29:56] You guys need a marketing strategy.

[29:58] You should call me up.

[30:00] You need to create this brand American pinball.

[30:02] You need to figure out where you want to be.

[30:04] How many games do we want to make?

[30:06] How do we create some sort of like aura around this company that's exciting.

[30:10] If I were them, I'd say we're only making a thousand of each title and that's it.

[30:15] You got to get it when we make it and I'm telling you right now you're going to want

[30:18] these games.

[30:19] But stop saying you're going to make original themes from Dennis Norton.

[30:22] Nobody wants original themes from Dennis Norton.

[30:26] If Elvira's House of Horrors was not Elvira, it doesn't sell.

[30:32] If it's just the House of Horror, Dennis Norton's House of Horrors, nobody cares.

[30:37] You need license themes.

[30:39] You need to limit the amount you make and you need to jump into this marketplace in a

[30:44] way that's aggressive with something you know is going to make people want to buy it

[30:48] in one day.

[30:50] If you don't have a single day sell out in your American pinball right now, that is the

[30:54] new benchmark.

[30:56] You failed.

[30:57] If you need to slowly sell games in 2021 when the sharks are in a feeding frenzy to get

[31:02] games this year, you failed.

[31:05] So this is going to be it.

[31:06] I'm excited to see it because if this game comes out and it's just like, eh, then what

[31:10] do you do?

[31:11] Why do they keep doing this stuff?

[31:13] And then if this game flops, then what?

[31:15] What?

[31:16] It's just like available.

[31:17] Nobody really wants it.

[31:18] And then we got to wait three to four months further.

[31:20] They're next attempt at the plate.

[31:23] Four strikes in a row.

[31:24] Come on AP.

[31:26] Come on wake up.

[31:27] Wake up.

[31:28] It is so easy to make money in pinball if you've figured manufacturing out.

[31:33] And I'm just going to say this.

[31:34] If you're not making money in pinball and you have manufacturing figured out, then you

[31:39] worked really hard to do really stupid stuff.

[31:42] And whoever is consulting them and making the decisions over there has made really stupid

[31:47] decisions.

[31:48] Now I believe in the new AP.

[31:50] I believe in what David fix as he wants to do.

[31:53] But if David fix his first move is to drop legends of Vahala out into the world, this

[31:59] is the new AP.

[32:00] If that's your first move, it's going to tell everybody you haven't learned anything.

[32:07] Guys, you haven't learned anything.

[32:08] Alright, we'll see what happens.

[32:11] Hi drama.

[32:12] Can you just pinball podcast this morning?

[32:13] So speaking of dropping new games, I'm hearing that toy story is not coming out this year.

[32:20] That is what I'm hearing.

[32:21] I'm hearing that Jack just renewed the license that Pat Lawler has taken a little bit longer.

[32:26] I'm hearing that the game might not be fully completed yet.

[32:29] Not sure about that, just a rumor, but I do not expect to see.

[32:33] I don't expect to see toy story this year.

[32:36] And I know, look, I mean for all of us out there, we know they have to make all these

[32:40] guns and roses machines.

[32:41] So it was highly unlikely that they were going to show another title this year.

[32:46] So if you're Jersey Jack, your entire year now is just making these guns and roses machines.

[32:51] There are still people who ordered the machine last October that have not received their

[32:56] product.

[32:57] So they've just got a lot of games to build.

[33:00] But most importantly, Jersey Jack pinball has a lot of confidence to build.

[33:05] They need to restore consumer confidence in this company.

[33:08] They've yet to do anything to do that.

[33:11] I'm sure they're working at it, but whatever it is, it's going to take more than just a

[33:16] seal of approval on a play field that meant nothing.

[33:21] Are we going to get a deep root update any day now?

[33:25] The latest is it's July 15th and the last time deep root gave us an update, they said

[33:30] we should expect something around July 4th.

[33:33] Okay, July 4th was over a week ago.

[33:36] And so now we're hearing that it might be sometime around July 18th.

[33:41] Now do you think we are going to get an update from Robert Mueller that says games are on

[33:47] the line or do you think we're going to get an update that says we're still waiting on

[33:51] something?

[33:52] My bet is the latter because every single update we've ever had from them has been about

[33:58] a delay.

[33:59] Now I'll tell you something that hasn't been delayed.

[34:02] That's Canadian pinball podcast.

[34:04] We continue to deliver episodes every single week.

[34:07] We also do our shows for the Canadian club members.

[34:10] And I'm here to tell you right now as of today, Canadian pinball podcast has surpassed

[34:17] Raza with sales.

[34:19] We now have a hundred and twenty three people who contribute via Patreon to Canadian pinball

[34:27] podcast.

[34:28] Raza has sold a hundred and twenty two games.

[34:33] So as of today, July 15th, Canadian pinball podcast has sold more product.

[34:39] If you will, if you call it product, a subscription, we've sold more than Raza.

[34:44] And as of today, we are much more profitable than deep root pinball.

[34:49] Look, one dollar, one dollar earned is much more profitable than deep root pinball.

[34:54] I do want to give a shout out to my latest contributors.

[34:57] Let's see.

[34:58] I got Tyson.

[34:59] I got Jeff M. I got Andrew D and then DMV, not like the DMV.

[35:06] Those are his initials.

[35:07] But here's also one I got.

[35:08] This is why I love my fans.

[35:11] Someone just contributed to Canadian pinball podcast.

[35:14] And it said your new patron is Bob Mueller and J. Pop.

[35:19] So people are actually putting down their name as Bob Mueller and J. Pop and contributing

[35:25] to Canadian pinball podcast.

[35:27] So thank you so much, Robert and J. Pop.

[35:30] I didn't realize you were fans of the show.

[35:32] Now speaking of fans of the show, and this is something I've been hearing for a very,

[35:37] very, very long time.

[35:39] And that was when are you going to finally make some merchandise and when are you going

[35:43] to give us the ability, if we love your show, to wear a t-shirt, to have a mug, to put

[35:48] a hat on that says Canadian pinball podcast.

[35:51] And I'm here to tell you right now, I have located a merchandise vendor in Brooklyn,

[35:56] New York.

[35:57] I am working on the merchandise as we speak.

[36:00] And I'm going to tell you right now that the first item that I will release to my fans

[36:05] in a merchandise format will be a very special limited edition t-shirt in which I'm only

[36:12] going to make a hundred and twenty two of them, a hundred and twenty two super limited

[36:19] collectors edition t-shirts.

[36:22] On the front, it will say Viva LaRaza.

[36:26] This is going to be the Canadian pinball podcast Viva LaRaza special edition t-shirt.

[36:32] The first people to have access to this t-shirt will be the Canadian club members who are donating

[36:37] on Patreon, so they will get access to it.

[36:40] Now there's only going to be a hundred and twenty two of these t-shirts.

[36:43] And right now we have a hundred and twenty three contributors on Patreon, so someone's

[36:48] going to miss out if everybody wants one.

[36:51] They're going to be super fun.

[36:52] I'm also going to make other merchandise as well that just has the logo of Canadian pinball

[36:56] podcast.

[36:57] I'm going to make a hat that says Viva LaRaza.

[37:00] I'm going to have a hat that says Canadian pinball podcast.

[37:02] And my plan is every month or so to release a new limited edition t-shirt with something

[37:08] fun on it.

[37:09] I'm going to make it so like yes, you can have the basic t- with the logo, but I want

[37:13] to do stuff that makes you guys want to wear it and make sure you laugh.

[37:16] I mean, this show has always been about that.

[37:18] This show has always taken the piss out of pinball.

[37:21] And look, my t-shirts are going to tell you right now.

[37:24] Canadian pinball podcast t-shirts, 100% guarantee they will not pull and they will not chip.

[37:31] And they're guaranteed to ship to you within two weeks.

[37:34] Are you ready for Canadian merchandise?

[37:36] Because my goal is this.

[37:38] For those of you out there, I want to get as many people as possible rocking Canadian pinball

[37:43] podcast gear at pinball expo this year.

[37:48] It is going to be amazing.

[37:50] We need to walk around that show and the Canadian army and Canadian club and everyone who loves

[37:55] Canadian pinball podcast.

[37:56] You know who you are.

[37:58] I want us to be at that show and just make a statement that Canadian pinball podcast has

[38:02] been the number one pinball podcast for so many years.

[38:06] And now you can finally show people out in public that you enjoy the show.

[38:10] Now I'm going to be at pinball expo.

[38:13] I haven't really run that by Brenda yet.

[38:14] But I'm going to be at the show and I'm going to be walking around and I want to see you

[38:19] guys rocking your Canadian gear.

[38:21] I want to take selfies and I want to buy everyone who's rocking this gear, a beer and have

[38:26] a good time and just enjoy pinball in real life, which is what we've all been waiting for.

[38:31] So that merch is coming out very, very soon.
