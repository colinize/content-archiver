[00:00] My heart's like an open book for the whole world to read.

[00:06] Sometime nothing keeps me together at the smith.

[00:19] Welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] And this is going to be a podcast that has been on my mind for a few days.

[00:28] I actually recorded a very sort of rant-filled podcast a couple nights ago.

[00:34] And I just deleted it because I didn't think it was very intelligent or well-thought-out.

[00:41] And I wanted to think about the best way to articulate the show I'm about to give you

[00:47] and the points I'm about to make.

[00:50] And I hope you listen to the show.

[00:52] I hope you know that this comes from a place of caring about pinball and about this hobby.

[01:00] And I hope this also starts to turn the tide a little bit in the conversation happening

[01:06] in the pinball world, which has been really, really negative and down and out and pessimistic.

[01:13] And I don't think it needs to be that.

[01:15] But I also think there is a lot of bullying and a lot of people that are very smug and

[01:22] act as if they know what is right for the entire hobby just because they play a lot of pinball.

[01:31] And I don't know if the word shill is the right word, but I want to give you a little bit

[01:34] of a context before I get into the heart of this episode.

[01:38] Now I'm going to say this too.

[01:41] Normally, normally, Canadian Spinball Podcast just goes off the cuff.

[01:45] I don't edit.

[01:46] I don't do notes.

[01:47] But on this one, I wanted to think about how to best articulate this because I had to do

[01:52] a little research to pull up some facts.

[01:55] I want to pull some quotes from some people.

[01:58] And I want to discuss what I think is going to be one of my most truthful and candid podcasts

[02:05] to date.

[02:07] And this podcast, and I go down these roads because I just don't hear anyone else trying

[02:12] to really get under the surface of pinball.

[02:15] Like I could do a whole episode complaining about Gary Stern telling people that they

[02:21] can't stream stranger things from CES.

[02:24] And we saw that happen this week.

[02:26] And yes, it is ridiculous that you go to a trade show where everyone is filming your technology

[02:32] and then you ask them not to film.

[02:33] I just hope Gary gets his help back because he sounds like he's dying in those videos

[02:40] and long Vegas nights will do that to you, but he's an older man.

[02:45] And I just hope he gets some rest.

[02:46] That's the only thing I was thinking about.

[02:49] But I don't want to go down that road.

[02:50] Ultimately, you can buy stranger things if you want it and you cannot buy it.

[02:55] I mean, it's just it's another decision for people to make.

[02:59] And I think next week we're going to get the stream of the game and you're going to be

[03:01] able to make up your mind.

[03:02] But that's not the point of this show.

[03:05] The point of this show is going to be about the nonstop bullying of people that are

[03:12] new in box buyers that just are raising questions about these games that are being served up

[03:18] to them from Stern Pimball.

[03:21] And I want to give you the genesis of what was my rant show and what this show's genesis

[03:27] was.

[03:28] And it was two things.

[03:29] One was I was listening to Slapsafe Pimball podcast and they gave George Gomez the

[03:33] man of the year award.

[03:35] So I had a little bit of a reaction to that.

[03:37] I'm like, why are we always just praising Stern?

[03:40] Just because they make so many games and they're the big jug or not.

[03:44] Why does Stern just universally always get applauded?

[03:47] Even if you look at the portfolio of games, are they making the most magical Pimball machines

[03:52] currently?

[03:53] Okay.

[03:54] Now, and I'm going to go into all of this, the pros and cons of being the number one by

[04:00] far Pimball company and what I think that means for us the Pimball buyer.

[04:05] Okay.

[04:06] So that's one part of it.

[04:07] The other part was this.

[04:09] I was just, I was trying, you know, I've been trying to make amends and bury the hatchet

[04:14] and move forward with a person that you know is crazy levy and I'm talking to our friend

[04:20] Adam about creating a, you know, a moment in which we can meet and discuss and I want

[04:25] to help try and find him a sponsor for his Pimball tournament in New York.

[04:29] And the whole time I'm like reading his post the last few days in which he's not just

[04:35] going to bat for Stern in the stranger things thread like vehemently going to bat for them.

[04:41] He's also calling me annoying and calling me all sorts of names and it's okay.

[04:45] Like I get it.

[04:46] It's like levy's not a bad guy.

[04:48] He's doing this stuff because that's the popular stance for him to take on Pinside which

[04:53] is to insult the fact that I don't have a game right now.

[04:56] He says that I don't play Pimball very often.

[04:59] He doesn't know that.

[05:00] He doesn't follow me around the city.

[05:02] I do play quite often and I do play a lot.

[05:05] I just don't go to league nights and I don't always play when he's playing or where he's

[05:09] playing.

[05:10] There's a lot of places to play.

[05:11] And so that I'm just this annoying spokesperson in the hobby.

[05:15] So what I want to do on this episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast is just address some of

[05:19] this stuff and how I think the Stern's shilling is probably one of the worst things for

[05:26] this hobby.

[05:27] And I think the Stern's shilling and this bullying that happens on Pinside is one of the worst

[05:34] things to happen in this hobby and I don't think it's going to get to better product.

[05:40] And I want to go down a journey with you, the listener and I want to tell you how I really

[05:45] feel about all of this, about this behavior of bullying people who have questions about

[05:51] the games they're being sold.

[05:53] I want to go down the industry as a whole and look at what is actually happening.

[05:59] You know, when we say like, what do we want in 2020?

[06:02] What do we want?

[06:03] What was 2019?

[06:04] Like, where does the industry going?

[06:05] I kind of want to look at it from a little bit more of an intellectual level and not just

[06:12] a surface level.

[06:13] And I also want to hold some people accountable for things they're saying.

[06:18] And I think I've got to the root of what I think is the number one issue that I think

[06:24] is the big problem in Pimball today.

[06:27] And again, it's not like all of this is under the umbrella of this is a toy that we play

[06:33] and enjoy.

[06:34] None of this is like that important.

[06:37] But there is something that I think has infiltrated the Pimball collecting and buying community

[06:44] and that is the mentality from people like Levy and what they're doing in their constant,

[06:51] never-ending, you know, bombardment of people with their opinions about what you should

[06:58] look for in a new-in-box game.

[07:00] And let's just go down this journey on Canadian Pimball podcast.

[07:03] All right.

[07:04] Now, I want you to ask Levy how many new-in-box games he buys a year?

[07:10] He's in every game thread preaching to people that actually have money on the line.

[07:17] But for the most part, he does not.

[07:19] He plays his games on location and in other people's homes or lofts in Tribeca.

[07:26] Yet he's the spokesperson for value and issues we might have as customers with new-in-box

[07:33] games.

[07:34] He's a tournament player in operator that hangs out on Pinside, which is not the forum

[07:42] for tournament players or operators.

[07:45] Right?

[07:46] There are other forums for that discussion.

[07:47] So why does he do that?

[07:49] Why does he spend all day long on a site for customers and collectors?

[07:55] And sure sounds like he's shilling for Stern and his boys that work there trying to make

[08:00] the rest of us oftentimes feel small like we don't know what we're talking about.

[08:06] And he sure can take over a thread, right?

[08:08] And that's why Canadian Pimball podcast exists.

[08:12] Because I can read what's going on and I can say stuff in response to that kind of behavior

[08:18] in a way that can't be buried in a Pinside thread.

[08:21] Because it's not about upvotes, downvotes here.

[08:23] It's about two to three thousand people that are going to listen and, you know, and I

[08:29] invite, I invite Levy to come on the show anytime to refute, to discuss, to talk about

[08:37] what I'm about to say on this episode of Canadian Pimball podcast, all right?

[08:41] So here's really what I want to do this podcast because in the stranger things thread, he

[08:46] had a response to somebody that was talking about we should get more in Pimball and someone

[08:53] put up a picture of Twilight Zone Pimball, right?

[08:58] And said, you know, I don't really think like bomb came into consideration here.

[09:01] Look at everything they put into this game.

[09:04] And so this was Levy's response to a person saying, I just want more games like Twilight

[09:11] Zone.

[09:12] He responds with the following and this is word for word what he said.

[09:15] He said, Pimball should shoot for staying in business.

[09:21] Games like Twilight Zone, we're counter to that goal in the 90s and even more so today.

[09:28] I'm not rewriting history.

[09:32] Games like Twilight Zone taught ops they should stop buying Pimball machines.

[09:38] If Pinside ran stern, they'd be out of business in a year.

[09:44] All right.

[09:45] I want to deconstruct this.

[09:47] That Pimball should shoot for staying in business.

[09:50] That games like Twilight Zone were counter to the goal in the 90s and that's the reason

[09:56] why operators stopped buying Pimball machines.

[09:59] Okay.

[10:00] So first I want to say this to crazy Levy.

[10:05] Twilight Zone is the fourth most popular Pimball machine of all time according to the top

[10:11] 100.

[10:13] So everybody, tournament players, collectors, hobbyists have considered that game to be

[10:19] the fourth best Pimball machine ever.

[10:21] And a gentleman that wants to see more games like that is being told by him that you

[10:28] shouldn't want that because this game was an operator nightmare and the reason why

[10:33] games were stopped being ordered by operators.

[10:36] Okay.

[10:37] So let's take that line that this game is the reason why people stopped ordering Pimball.

[10:42] So how many Twilight zones, if it was such a disaster and such a mechanical problem and

[10:48] such a bad game, they probably didn't sell many Twilight zones, right?

[10:52] Well actually, that's wrong because they sold, are you ready for it?

[10:57] 15,235 Twilight Zone Pimball machines were made.

[11:05] In the 1990s, Twilight Zone is not what told the operators to stop buying Pimball machines.

[11:12] The 1990s was the height of Pimball sales.

[11:16] What killed Pimball sales were arcade games and home councils.

[11:22] But more so, the overall death of the arcade in the late 90s is what killed Pimball sales.

[11:30] People began staying home and enjoying video game councils that connected them to their

[11:35] friends via the internet.

[11:38] So levees statements about Pimball companies striving to stay in business and we should

[11:44] root for them to stay in business is all that's wrong with Pimball today.

[11:49] Like we should root for a creative company like Stern Pimball.

[11:54] Here's what we should root for them to do.

[11:55] Not just stay in business.

[11:58] We should root for them to make the highest quality games in the world.

[12:03] We should ask them to shoot for delivering the most innovative and creative product imaginable.

[12:11] We should shoot for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in Pimball with today's

[12:17] technology.

[12:19] And they should shoot for dreaming big and creating the unimaginable.

[12:23] If we keep rooting for them and they should shoot for staying in business, that means

[12:28] we're rooting for the highest possible profit, the lowest possible bomb, saving money wherever

[12:36] they can, getting things out so the line stays moving even if the game is not done.

[12:43] So I wouldn't root, you know, I would root for hell like these things and I would shoot

[12:47] for these things if I were an investor in Stern.

[12:51] But we, my friends, are not investors in Stern Pimball.

[12:56] We are customers.

[12:58] And as customers, it's not in our best interest to just root for them to stay in business,

[13:05] no matter the cost to us.

[13:08] As customers, we want what we pay for.

[13:11] You know what I've said this many times before and maybe some of you just don't want to

[13:16] absorb this fact.

[13:18] And this is a fact.

[13:19] Do you know that Stern Pimball sells its LE machines for just a tad over $3,000 to

[13:27] its own people?

[13:29] That's the friends and family price of the Stern LE.

[13:32] So really think about that when you're plunking down $9,100 on a stranger things, LE, okay?

[13:41] And I'm here to tell you today that the Stern investors are much happier than you are today,

[13:48] even if you love your games.

[13:50] So I want to read for you.

[13:51] This is a direct statement from a Stern employee who emailed me about how well Stern has

[13:57] been growing.

[13:58] So I was corresponding the email with this person and I asked them what is Stern's response

[14:04] to some of the negative feedback with stranger things.

[14:07] And this is the response I got from a Stern employee.

[14:10] He wrote, well I suppose we shall see if 2020 is another record breaking sales year.

[14:18] Company is up more than 600% since 2015.

[14:25] Now I know Levy, I know his friends, they are not bad people.

[14:29] They love Pimball perhaps more than anyone, right?

[14:32] It's why he's on Pinsite all day long.

[14:35] I mean this is, he's addicted to Pimball and that's fine.

[14:39] Everyone who's into this hobby has the bug in some fashion.

[14:44] But I love people that geek out and go very far into their love of their hobbies.

[14:51] So I get why they want Pimball to stay alive.

[14:54] And I know why they want to shoot for Stern to stay in business and root for them to have

[15:01] great business successes.

[15:03] But here's the reasons also why.

[15:05] If you look at these tournament players and why they are always defending Stern at all

[15:11] cost, it's because the hobby would be boring without new games.

[15:16] And if new games on location makes location play, and tournaments much more fun.

[15:22] Because it's fun learning a new game when you have great Pimball skills like Levy does

[15:28] and his friends, right?

[15:29] It's like it's much more interesting that every few months there's new games for them

[15:34] to learn.

[15:35] And they can apply their amazing skill sets to understanding how to like now play this

[15:38] game in a tournament.

[15:40] Because they would get real boring playing the same game over and over again.

[15:43] But there's also this point.

[15:44] And this is true.

[15:45] Lots of these guys are friends like lifelong friends with employees at Stern Pimball.

[15:52] So they naturally want to see them stay gainfully employed for a while.

[15:58] And that's all understandable, right?

[16:01] And that is what this hobby boils down to for me.

[16:04] This pressure to always root for Stern or else our beloved hobby will disappear.

[16:13] But I'm here to tell you that this is not the case.

[16:16] It doesn't have to be the case.

[16:18] It's clear there's a lot of Pimball fans, buyers, collectors out there.

[16:23] Do you think if Stern went away, that the demand for Pimball today would dry up immediately?

[16:30] Now Stern is going absolutely nowhere.

[16:32] And I don't want Stern to go away at all.

[16:36] What I want for Stern and what I want for all of us is to shoot for one thing in the Pimball

[16:42] hobby.

[16:43] And the thing we should be shooting for is not just for Stern to stay in business.

[16:46] The thing we should be shooting for is one word and one word only.

[16:51] And that word is competition.

[16:55] Stern has none.

[16:56] They are competing against themselves and their own challenges to keep the line moving.

[17:02] That's it.

[17:03] They have zero competition.

[17:05] Jjp, CGC, spooky, all add up to maybe 5% to 10% of the market.

[17:11] If you go globally, it's even less.

[17:14] So why do they have no competition?

[17:17] Why?

[17:18] The demand is there.

[17:19] Why can't these other companies figure it out?

[17:21] Well, Stern has 35 plus years of manufacturing experience when it comes to Pimball and you

[17:27] cannot acquire overnight that kind of experience by throwing money at it.

[17:34] Competitors just don't get it.

[17:36] Jersey Jack Pimball should be destroying Stern at the high end of the marketplace.

[17:43] But themes like the Hobbit and Dial Dinn and Pirates of the Caribbean are not what people

[17:49] really want.

[17:51] And remember, Jack spent over 5 years making just those 3 titles.

[17:57] He could have had the Matrix.

[18:00] He could have had Toy Story out by then.

[18:03] And wait for it.

[18:04] He could have had Rick and Morty as well if he really went after a title like that.

[18:09] If he understood his audience and what moves them and what they want.

[18:14] And here's the sad part.

[18:15] If you put a $9,000 Dial Dinn next to a $9,000 Strap,

[18:21] you can't just change your things.

[18:23] Please just take a minute, listener.

[18:25] And look at both of these games side by side.

[18:29] Just please do that today at some point.

[18:31] And you tell me which company is aiming for greatness, is dreaming, is innovating, is

[18:38] trying to give us the most, is trying to recreate the Twilight Zone magic that has that

[18:45] game at number 4 of all time.

[18:48] Dial Dinn sells barely 2,000 units.

[18:53] Stern sold more black knights with nothing in it for a higher profit margin.

[18:59] And that's where Pimbal is today.

[19:01] And great, they're staying in business because they make those moves.

[19:05] But it's not creating competition for Stern on any level.

[19:09] American Pimbal, they jam pack their games, right?

[19:13] But they make bad themes and can't get the easy stuff like art and animations right.

[19:19] And Hot Wheels vs Stranger Things and Ninja Turtles, it could be dead on arrival.

[19:25] Why this company did not go out and get alien and the big Lebowski is beyond me?

[19:32] Two developed games, people want it, feverishly want it.

[19:37] They're sitting there and you go off and you develop October Fest.

[19:43] Chicago Gaming Company is only going after the die hard Pimbal collector who don't want

[19:49] to pay $12,000 for a nice, really restored classic.

[19:52] I mean that's what like medieval madness in those games were going for when before the

[19:57] remakes happened.

[19:59] But they're not giving us anything contemporary.

[20:03] It's a new dress on an old lady.

[20:07] Deep root, we'll have to wait and see.

[20:09] P3 multi morphic, they've lessened sales in seven years than Stern makes in seven hours.

[20:17] But it's a problem, right?

[20:19] It's a platform, y'all.

[20:21] If the next game doesn't bring this platform to life, Jerry needs to find a new idea in

[20:26] Pimbal.

[20:27] I'm totally fine with Stern owning the majority of the Pimbal market.

[20:33] Give us four to five titles a year and the ranges of maybe six to eight to nine thousand

[20:37] dollars based on themes people love.

[20:40] I'm cool with that.

[20:42] But where it becomes comical and almost criminal is how Stern wants to take over the high-end

[20:49] premium market without making the product any better.

[20:54] As consumers, buyers, players and collectors, where do we draw the line?

[21:00] If you buy a fifteen thousand dollar pin that has nothing more than a piece of couch in

[21:05] it, you just sent a very clear message.

[21:09] You just told the Honda of Pimbal that you would pay Ferrari prices if all they did

[21:17] were change the seats in the car.

[21:20] Can you blame those fifty buyers?

[21:22] They just wanted something special.

[21:24] All collectors do.

[21:26] Everyone out there who's listening to this, when you look at your Pimbal collection and

[21:29] you want to have something special, something collectible, you know you all do.

[21:34] I'm here to tell you, 95% of what Stern makes is not special, it's not collectible, and

[21:42] it never will be.

[21:43] It won't hold value and people won't care about it in six months.

[21:49] And here's what I would love to see happen in Pimbal.

[21:52] This is Canadian's wishes for how I would love this industry to just shake out a little

[21:57] bit.

[21:58] This thing, I would love tournament players like Levian is friends.

[22:03] To just enjoy their tournaments, enjoy going out and playing on location, enjoy being

[22:09] operators if that's what they do, but I would ask them to please stop telling new inbox

[22:15] home buyers what's important to them, what they should look for, what they should stop

[22:21] complaining about.

[22:23] We don't go to your tournaments, stand over your shoulder and say how silly you look,

[22:29] spending hours each week just to win $40 and assign Translate.

[22:35] Levian a good guy, but trolling Pinside all day long, is that really the best use of

[22:42] your time?

[22:44] Stern, give us four to five titles a year, but please put more mechanical wow stuff into

[22:49] these games.

[22:51] Pimbal is a physical world under glass.

[22:55] Mr. Gomez said that, never forget that.

[22:58] You've got the best talent in the industry without a doubt, but it's time you unshackled

[23:05] them.

[23:06] Gary, you're greedy and you know it.

[23:10] Is that extra $200,000 you saved by yanking out a feature really going to matter?

[23:16] You've been giving the investors their best returns ever in your final years.

[23:23] Maybe focus on making games the world will remember long after you're gone.

[23:30] Nobody will remember the profit.

[23:32] It's the pinball that is your legacy and you know your games could be better and you know

[23:38] every time you walk over to a John Borg, every time you walk over to a Brian Eddie and

[23:45] every time you walk over to an L win, every time you walk over to one of your big designers

[23:50] or tell George Gomez, yes, it takes something out.

[23:53] You know you know you're doing it for your investors.

[23:57] You're not yanking that stuff out to make your customers happy.

[24:00] And I would love Stern Pimbal moving forward because this train is going to end people.

[24:07] You know it.

[24:08] This pinball train is not going to keep going, but I would love for Stern Pimbal to

[24:12] just show us what they can do in an unshackled format.

[24:15] And hey, hey Gary, hey George, hey all you designers who listen to this show.

[24:21] We're okay.

[24:23] We are okay spending more on these games if you give us more.

[24:28] Why can't Stern have like a platinum series line of games?

[24:33] That's just high end pinball.

[24:35] But put more in it.

[24:37] Don't just dress up a basic machine with stickers and BS translates and signatures that

[24:44] mean nothing and pieces of catch.

[24:46] No, actually say we're going to make a series of games that cost $15,000 each and we're

[24:52] going to spare no expense.

[24:54] And guess what?

[24:55] You'll sell every one.

[24:57] I would love for JJP to do one thing.

[25:00] Jersey Jack Pimbal needs to wake up.

[25:03] You need to wake up.

[25:05] Jack you make the world's most high end pinball ever.

[25:09] In the history of pinball, Jersey Jack machines are the most high end games of all time.

[25:15] You are the Bugatti of pinball, the Ferrari of pinball.

[25:20] But Jack you need to stop thinking you are still a salesman at Stern.

[25:26] You need to stop trying to compete with Stern on volume.

[25:31] Four games look and are three times nicer than Stern machines.

[25:37] Yet you price them equal.

[25:40] Wake up Jack.

[25:42] JJP should only make 500 total of each title and they should sell each one of those 500

[25:53] games.

[25:54] And by that I mean 500 Willy Wonka is only 500 pirates only 500 guns and roses only.

[26:01] And they should sell each one of those 500 games for $20,000 each.

[26:09] He'd sell every single game.

[26:12] And I can already hear the tournament players and some of the people that don't have a lot

[26:17] of money complaining saying his games are further wealthy.

[26:21] And I'm here to tell you, well so what?

[26:24] So our big houses and fancy cars and that doesn't stop people from making those.

[26:30] There is an audience of over 500 collectors who would much rather have $120,000 special

[26:39] game that's a collectible.

[26:42] Then four $5,000 Stern games that there are thousands of them out in the world that

[26:49] mean nothing that are not special that are not collectibles.

[26:53] And yet I see all of these men with all of this money Jack who are buying every single

[27:00] new Stern game that's not special and you need to understand there's a market for

[27:05] this suggestion.

[27:06] All right.

[27:07] Jack makes a rich man's product but he has a poor man's mentality and that is what is

[27:14] killing Jersey Jack.

[27:16] It's like he prices his games based on guilt.

[27:20] And if you just run the numbers let's do the math.

[27:23] 500 games at $20,000 is $10 million.

[27:28] Now let's see what he's doing now like dialed in 2000 games at $9,000 is $18 million.

[27:36] So you might think oh wait it's smarter to do that way but no because if Jack made 2000

[27:42] games which would be four titles if you do 500 each title 2000 games at 20,000 each would

[27:51] equal 40 million dollars for the company.

[27:55] And imagine that.

[27:56] So imagine you know instead of making dialed in for two years and you're only making $18,000

[28:01] imagine if he did two games a year at 20,000 each he'd be at 40 million dollars in two

[28:08] years.

[28:09] And if you're only doing 500 games each you can have a smaller place to make the games.

[28:16] You can have less overhead less workers less everything but you can charge more and you

[28:24] can have higher bombs and get all the assets you need like you can let Eric and Pat go to

[28:29] town on each game without asking them to pull back.

[28:34] See Jack's going in the wrong direction now he wants to get more games out of here he

[28:38] wants to get more volume out of here he's trying to be like stern and he's going to fail

[28:42] horribly at it because he's not going to be able to make the games as high end if he

[28:46] tries to make him faster and he tries to get more out in the world.

[28:51] And lastly with only 500 each each game becomes special forever each would be bolted to

[28:57] the floor and only leave for more money and you'd be known as the man that made the

[29:02] greatest games ever without compromise.

[29:05] I wish Jack had thought about this before he scaled so large but if I were him I'd

[29:13] look to do just what I have suggested.

[29:16] Jack you make the best games you're just marketing them all wrong and your strategy is all

[29:22] wrong.

[29:24] Deep root Robert and company they know the play field and I don't mean the pinball play

[29:28] field they know the play field of the whole pinball industry they see what works and what

[29:33] doesn't they know what people want they either deliver a compelling offer or they don't

[29:40] if they make something magical I think buyers will line up but there's so much yet to

[29:45] be determined with deep root.

[29:47] Ultimately my final thoughts are this it is just pinball a toy a toy a pinball toy that

[29:56] is meant to be fun but being fun does not mean we don't think about the cost my father

[30:04] always told me if you create something a value the money will come and it has come for

[30:09] stern and they deserve all of the successes they have but they have made the games cheaper

[30:14] and we all know it they can make them better if we don't just apologize and show for them

[30:21] the way some are doing on pin side the craters in these games are not normal as much as again

[30:29] I see levy going to bat against these one week of owning a stranger things and it looks

[30:35] absolutely horrendous and he's going to bat for the for stern it just makes no sense

[30:41] it's not normal most pinball buyers are not on pin side they don't listen to podcasts

[30:48] they are just normal people who have homes barcades game rooms arcades that want an amusement

[30:55] device most pinball buyers don't know what code is most don't care to play in tournaments

[31:01] if you're listening to this we are the die hards the enthusiast and it's about time

[31:08] the die hard to learn how to stick together in this hobby we should be working together

[31:13] me levy iceman wise snow all of us rare hero all of us you know we're always arguing

[31:21] with each other we should be working together to root and to shoot for pinball magic and

[31:29] to get more games like twilight zone back into the world we should not we should not

[31:35] be rooting for the rich investors over at stern to get richer and every time something

[31:40] happens at stern that's not positive we try to like bury it and and just defend the company

[31:45] at all cost because we are the customers levy we are the customers we are not the investors

[31:54] when we buy a pinball machine we are not buying a stock in stern pinball we are buying a product

[32:01] that we want to be as good as possible you have to understand that man you're smart

[32:07] enough to understand that we all love pinball even if we don't love each other I don't expect

[32:15] everyone to forgive me I don't expect everyone to like me but we all love pinball so next

[32:21] time I see levy at a bar in New York City I'm not going to go and make a fist I'm going

[32:27] to go buy him a beer because that is what I love about pinball is no matter our opinions

[32:33] on all these companies I can sit down and I can geek out with levy with rare hero with

[32:41] ice man with dealt with all the guys out there I mean there's a million of them mr. 66

[32:47] you know we all love pinball but don't for a minute let's not ever ever again slam

[32:54] somebody who just wants modern pinball to be as magical as the twilight zone to bring a

[33:01] full this back full circle we should all be wanting that levy you know we don't root for

[33:08] Disney to make the stock price go up unless we're investors we look for Disney to make magical

[33:14] things happen because we want to feel like kids again inside and I just when I see this attacking

[33:20] of people that just want pinball to be as magical as possible because we want to get all giddy

[33:26] inside when we see it I think we have to respect that and I think as people who love pinball

[33:32] collectively that is what we should ask these companies to shoot for and I also think it's quite

[33:39] clear the role of Jersey Jack and the hobby the role of Stern the role of spooky the role of CGC

[33:47] and if everyone can get into their lane in the right way it's gonna be amazing for us but it's

[33:54] weird they're all trying to fight against Stern in the wrong ways except for spooky I believe I

[33:59] really do I think spooky is doing it right all right everybody this has been a little bit of a

[34:05] journey and I did this podcast because you know I just get tired of seeing people who should love

[34:11] this hobby more attacking new inbox buyers levy the bottom line is this if it wasn't for these

[34:19] new inbox buyers Stern would be at a business you tournament players you would not keep them in

[34:26] business at all now I just want to call a truce and a ceasefire because there's no reason why

[34:34] tournament players and new inbox buyers have to clash have to be at odds at all we all love the

[34:41] same thing but I think levy if you were going into your pocket time and time again with $9,000

[34:48] and this was the quality you were getting you would think differently about it and you're right

[34:54] pinball is fun when you go out to a bar and beat on a machine and have beer with your friends

[34:59] and then you you know there's no headaches when you leave that bar but for the rest of us

[35:04] we just want more because we're spending more and remember never forget that number people

[35:10] externally sold to its customers internally its friends and family price is just a little over

[35:18] $3,000 so you tell me ice man I'm talking right to you how great it is to write a check for $9,100

[35:27] and then you look at a dialed in for $9,000 and look I get it you could say Jersey Jack went

[35:34] out of business because he doesn't understand I don't want Jack to stop giving us everything he

[35:39] wants to give us I think he just needs to price it accordingly and people have the money Jack

[35:46] charge what they're worth look at pirates of the care being collectors edition right now

[35:51] they're going to start selling for $20,000 Jack because they're rare and it's amazing and you're

[35:58] never going to see another game like that from anyone else on the planet so just make 500

[36:03] pirate CEs and sell them all for $20,000 and only make that many never make any more and you'll sell

[36:11] everyone I really hope people understand that I'm saying stuff like this because I want I want

[36:18] these companies to be around for a long time and I think they all need to wake up a little bit

[36:25] Stern can do whatever they want but the other companies just wake up wake up there's an

[36:29] opportunity staring you in the face and if everyone just like wakes up I think they'll be the

[36:35] most successful they can be but as consumers everybody let's root for pinball magic let's shoot

[36:42] for pinball magic and let's stop bullying people who just want to see more from these games all right

[36:49] have a great week in everybody

[36:59] we
