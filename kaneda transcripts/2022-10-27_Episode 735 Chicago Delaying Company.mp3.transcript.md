[00:00] Alright, so let's do this for a second.

[00:14] Let's talk about when Chicago Gaming Company revealed that they were making Monster Bash.

[00:20] Do you remember what year it was?

[00:21] This is shocking.

[00:22] It was July of 2018 when Chicago Gaming Company said, we're making Monster Bash and then

[00:29] they showed it a few months later.

[00:31] So four years ago, and here we are four years later, and where the heck is Cactus Canyon

[00:37] LE?

[00:38] And now we are learning from distributors, not even from Chicago Gaming Company themselves,

[00:44] that this LE is now delayed again at least another six weeks.

[00:50] So you are not going to get your Cactus Canyon LE probably until 2023.

[00:56] And it begs the question.

[00:58] Why did they reveal this game at Expo last year if they knew they couldn't get these

[01:04] games on the line?

[01:06] And a lot of you out there bought this game.

[01:09] They sold 1,250 LEs of Cactus Canyon.

[01:13] I was in the room when the order banks opened up and everybody wanted one because it was

[01:18] like $9,700.

[01:20] It was a good bargain.

[01:22] It had this amazing topper.

[01:24] It had this amazing apron.

[01:26] And here we are one year later.

[01:29] There is nothing on planet Earth that would take a year to figure out how to source the

[01:36] material.

[01:37] So why do you think Chicago Gaming Company is so delayed?

[01:41] What do you think the issue is with this game?

[01:44] I'm going to speculate on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, but before I speculate

[01:49] on what the issue is, I just want to say this.

[01:53] I think it's inexcusable that a pinball company that takes people's money a year ago and then

[02:00] goes radio silent is allowed to operate this way.

[02:05] Why are they allowed not to make official statements?

[02:09] Why are we hearing through distributors like the Game Room guys that this game is now delayed?

[02:15] Why doesn't Ryan White actually do his job?

[02:19] And this is not a personal attack.

[02:21] If you're in charge of marketing and sales and communications for a pinball company and

[02:27] you have a delay, then you need to man up and tell everybody what the delay is, when

[02:35] they can expect to have another sort of update, and when people can expect their games.

[02:41] That is just called being a professional.

[02:44] I'm not asking for them to like take us through the factory every single week.

[02:49] I'm not asking for a weekly newsletter of updates if they don't have weekly updates,

[02:53] but we keep seeing this trend in pinball, where companies keep taking money and then

[02:58] they absolutely don't keep you updated on the progress of where your game is at.

[03:04] I don't know about you, but I would be very frustrated and very upset that I locked my

[03:08] money in so long ago for a game and the company can't even have the common decency to let

[03:15] me know the status.

[03:16] What's the big deal?

[03:18] Facebook Live is something I go on all the time throughout the week.

[03:21] I went on Facebook Live at four in the morning yesterday or this morning because I couldn't

[03:26] sleep, because I woke up early.

[03:28] Why is it that Canada can do this?

[03:30] Can keep you more updated on what's going on in the world of pinball, and these pinball

[03:34] companies that are making millions of dollars off of you can't even do it.

[03:39] They can't even keep you posted on the status of the build.

[03:43] We saw it with the pinball brothers.

[03:44] They revealed Queen Pinball.

[03:46] What happened next?

[03:47] Distributors were taking money, non-refundable, paid in full money on the game, promising

[03:54] people the game sometime this year.

[03:57] Now what happened?

[03:58] They came to Expo.

[03:59] The games are not on the line.

[04:01] The games are still in prototype form, and you have no idea when you're going to get

[04:06] your game.

[04:07] We're seeing it across the boutique pinball space.

[04:12] I think we're just at the point now where this community is allowing this to happen

[04:17] to itself.

[04:19] Look, if you ordered a cactus canyon, I know what you were thinking.

[04:23] Why should I worry?

[04:24] They've made Monster Bash.

[04:25] They've made the other games.

[04:27] They always deliver, and when they do deliver, people are getting quality product.

[04:32] You're right.

[04:33] You're absolutely right.

[04:34] I was blown away.

[04:35] I saw that yesterday that Medieval Madness Royal Edition for $24,000 or best offer has

[04:43] a sale pending.

[04:45] Sale pending.

[04:46] The person who bought it probably spent over $20,000 on it.

[04:50] It's just crazy.

[04:51] But I just think Ryan White needs to wake up and do his job.

[04:55] He's not doing his job.

[04:56] He needs to communicate and not rely on the distributors to give the updates on his game.

[05:02] The problem with all these boutique companies that are financed by something else, like

[05:07] CGC is financed by Churchill cabinets.

[05:09] Jersey Jack is financed by the Abbess Money.

[05:13] You've got Ametron financing American Pinball.

[05:15] Did you see the American Pinball Tour that David Fix did?

[05:18] He opens the door to American Pinball.

[05:21] There's no receptionists.

[05:23] There's barely anyone inside the company.

[05:25] You do a walk around and you're like, this does not look like a pinball company that

[05:30] is putting pinballs into boxes every day.

[05:34] And I don't understand that, right?

[05:35] But it doesn't matter, right?

[05:37] Because Ametron is making tens of millions of dollars a year and this is probably a tax

[05:42] write-off venture.

[05:44] I doubt any of these companies are making tremendous profits.

[05:48] JJP obviously turned a corner with Guns N' Roses, but before then it was hard for JJP

[05:54] to turn a profit on their games.

[05:56] Like it was.

[05:57] That's why they moved the whole factory to Chicago from New Jersey.

[06:00] Spooky Pinball seems to be the only company, and I mean this when I say it.

[06:04] Spooky Pinball is transparent.

[06:07] At least they are honest with people about how many games they can make a week.

[06:13] They're honest about when you're going to get your game.

[06:16] You know what number game you are and so you can figure out when you should expect your

[06:21] game from Spooky Pinball.

[06:23] Say what you will about Spooky.

[06:25] And I've said a lot about Spooky.

[06:27] At least they are professional.

[06:30] At least they communicate like grown adults.

[06:33] Nothing they do is ever ambiguous.

[06:35] They don't tell people to pound sand.

[06:38] They don't hide from their promises.

[06:40] They say, hey, we're going to do this.

[06:42] We're going to build this game.

[06:43] We're going to build this many a week.

[06:45] We're going to make this many in this much time frame.

[06:48] And we are going to make all of them within 18 months.

[06:51] And they've delivered on that promise.

[06:54] And say what you will about the hot glue guns and the cheap LCD screens and no real toys

[06:59] in the last two games.

[07:01] I don't really care.

[07:02] At least Spooky Pinball is alive and well.

[07:06] At least Spooky Pinball when they do a factory tour, there's actually people there building

[07:10] the games every single day.

[07:12] Every time we go live to Spooky, we see games with playfields up and in cabinets and stuff

[07:18] is happening.

[07:20] And that is the thing.

[07:21] It's like we've learned from Stern and we've learned from the number one dog in the game.

[07:25] When you do a factory tour, the line needs to be moving.

[07:29] Every day games are not going into boxes.

[07:34] You are losing money as a manufacturing company.

[07:38] No factory wants to have a day in which nothing is made.

[07:43] But this is the problem when these companies are outside financed.

[07:46] It's like they don't really need it.

[07:48] They don't need to survive based on their pinball profits alone.

[07:53] And when you do that, right, when you're financed by something else, you can get really lazy.

[07:58] You can get more apathetic.

[08:00] It's like these boutique companies that are financed by other ventures.

[08:04] It's like they've got trust fund money, right?

[08:06] Imagine trying to get a trust fund kid to have a sense of urgency at work.

[08:11] Imagine trying to get a trust fund kid to go the extra effort to go above and beyond.

[08:16] And that's what it feels like.

[08:17] The Chicago gaming company feel like they're going above and beyond with their customer

[08:21] service.

[08:22] Does Haggis Pinball feel like they're going above and beyond?

[08:25] You can go down a list of these boutique companies where it's like when you're a customer of

[08:30] theirs, you kind of feel like you've been abandoned and you just have to wait with your

[08:35] fingers crossed.

[08:36] Now look, why do I think this Cactus Canyon game is delayed?

[08:40] Here's why I think it's delayed.

[08:42] I don't think the Lyman sheets code is that far along.

[08:45] I think they're waiting for this code to get to a place where they feel like confident

[08:49] that it's going to live up to what people are expecting.

[08:53] Because I can't imagine any other reason why this game is delayed.

[08:57] It can't because of metal parts for the train or wood for the apron or whatever else is

[09:02] in this game because we know they are making essays of the game.

[09:07] It can't because of the topper.

[09:08] How would a topper cause a one year delay?

[09:11] How?

[09:12] Plastic with like some servos.

[09:15] So I fully expect that the reason why this game is delayed is they want the L.E.s to

[09:20] ship with the code completed.

[09:22] I don't know when that's going to be.

[09:24] Now we're hearing it's going to be four to six weeks.

[09:26] Remember when it used to be two weeks was the joke?

[09:28] Now it feels like it's six weeks.

[09:30] Six weeks from now we promise games are going to be on the line.

[09:33] You know, I'm just going to say this.

[09:35] At these prices with all of these companies, we all deserve better customer service.

[09:41] And what I mean by that, it's not just like communication because communication in the

[09:44] pinball world is pretty much piss poor.

[09:47] Like it's piss poor.

[09:48] The thing we really need though is just better customer service.

[09:52] We need better warranties in this industry.

[09:54] Nobody's demanding better warranties.

[09:56] Have you ever read the warranty on your pinball machine?

[09:58] It's basically not even covered.

[10:00] Like nothing on the machine is actually covered.

[10:03] So we don't have good warranties.

[10:05] When you buy these games over and over again, do you feel like you're getting invited into

[10:10] this VIP club?

[10:12] Do you feel like they're treating you special?

[10:14] You could spend a hundred thousand dollars on stern pinball machines.

[10:18] What does it get you?

[10:19] Do you get invited to anything?

[10:21] Do you get early access to the next games?

[10:23] You get absolutely nothing.

[10:25] Absolutely nothing.

[10:26] The only thing you'll get is the opportunity to buy into their like stern insider club,

[10:31] which then it just gives you the opportunity to try to catch an Ellie on their website

[10:35] before it sells out in 30 seconds.

[10:38] But there's absolutely no loyalty program for the pinball collector.

[10:43] And I've been saying this before, all of the effort into building the community goes into

[10:48] the tournament and league players, right?

[10:51] That's where all of the effort is going.

[10:53] But I've been hearing from people like in these games and the stern insider connected,

[10:57] there are supposed to be like rewards for unlocking achievements in the game.

[11:02] Notice how many rewards and things people are experiencing as they hook up stern insider

[11:07] connected.

[11:08] None.

[11:09] Like there's nothing.

[11:10] Like all of this is like good in theory, but in practice and the way this stuff is actually

[11:15] coming to life.

[11:17] I just want us as a community to get more, especially at these prices.

[11:23] You know, pinballs are as much as a Rolex now.

[11:26] When you walk into buy a Rolex, when you go to a Rolex dealer, if you've ever walked into

[11:30] a watch shop, it's much more polished.

[11:33] It's a nice environment.

[11:34] They'll pour you some champagne.

[11:36] They'll get you some pariet.

[11:38] They treat you like a valued customer.

[11:41] And I know some of you are getting that from your distributors, but for the most part,

[11:45] I just want to see these pinball companies do more to make everybody feel like a valued

[11:50] customer.

[11:51] And I'm just going to go down a list of things I expect from all of these companies.

[11:54] I expect more transparency.

[11:56] I think they should be talking to the community more.

[11:59] I think they should be talking to their buyers more.

[12:01] Even if their buyers complain, I don't care.

[12:04] I expect these pinball companies to be in threads the same way spooky pinball is.

[12:09] Stern Pinball has a marketing team.

[12:11] Where is Jared on pin side?

[12:13] He's nowhere to be found, right?

[12:14] Where are these people?

[12:15] Like every once in a while, a zombie yeti will jump in defending something.

[12:19] But for the most part, there's absolutely no communication from Stern on the number one

[12:23] forum, right?

[12:24] There's barely any communication from Jersey Jack on the forum.

[12:27] Sometimes Kiefer jumps in, but for the most part, no communication.

[12:31] So I would just like more transparency and look, I get it.

[12:35] The more transparent you are, the more there's going to be a target on your back for the

[12:39] haters and the people to come in and troll you a little bit.

[12:42] But you can always block those people.

[12:44] Like I'm blocked from Jersey Jack's Facebook page.

[12:46] I can't comment on anything.

[12:48] I would like more transparency.

[12:49] I would like better warranties.

[12:51] I would also like to feel if I buy many machines with these companies that that somehow

[12:57] unlocks more rewards and more loyalty from those companies with me, you know, because

[13:02] it's so much money.

[13:04] It's absolutely getting to the point now where at these prices, I think we expect more from

[13:09] these companies.

[13:10] And I'll say this and I'm going to play devil's advocate right now.

[13:13] I don't need all that stuff.

[13:15] If companies just make great games, get them out on time and the games are built well.

[13:21] If you do that, right?

[13:22] If you make a great game, you get it out.

[13:25] When you say you're going to get it out and the build quality is great.

[13:28] Guess what you're going to have?

[13:29] A happy customer.

[13:31] I'm not going to want anymore.

[13:32] I'm not going to feel like I missed out on some stuff.

[13:35] I'm not going to feel like I'm longing for more from you because I'm going to feel like

[13:39] you delivered to me what I expected for the money.

[13:42] And I think that's where it's at right now at these prices in Pimbal.

[13:46] Our expectations are going to go up and we're going to want great games.

[13:51] And if a game isn't great, it's not going to survive.

[13:54] And it's a really interesting time in Pimbal because of that.

[13:57] Mediocrity in Pimbal is dead.

[13:59] Like you can see it when people jumped on Queen Pimbal at Expo.

[14:03] I was looking at all of the Queen Pimbal reviews and they were not stellar.

[14:07] Like people were kind of shoulder shrugging.

[14:09] The only people praising the game are the distributors who want to sell you one.

[14:15] And everyone's going to start to see past that.

[14:17] There's no room for spinal tap in this Pimbal marketplace.

[14:21] There's no room for mediocre games.

[14:23] They haven't even sold all the TNAs for $9,000 with 250 of them being made.

[14:28] At this point, it's going to be whoever delivers the magic is going to get the cheddar.

[14:34] And that's why I'm excited to see American Pimbal's new game because out of all the games coming out,

[14:40] I think the Dennis Nordman game is going to be the one that just packs it with stuff.

[14:45] And I really think they know they need to do that.

[14:47] So I'm excited to see that game.

[14:49] I just don't know when.

[14:51] There's no hype for it.

[14:52] I do feel like the James Bond hype is dead.

[14:55] Doesn't it feel like that?

[14:56] Like who is still really, really excited about James Bond?

[14:59] Like not even our friend Neil McCray is chomping at the bit about James Bond anymore because it was a really bad launch.

[15:06] And so here we are.

[15:07] It's almost November.

[15:09] We've got two more months in the Pimbal year.

[15:12] We've got the Twippies coming up.

[15:13] Did you hear this news?

[15:14] Jeff Patterson is no longer part of the Twippies.

[15:17] The co-creator of it has stepped aside.

[15:20] We all know what they need to do.

[15:22] They need to get Greg and Zach to host a show again.

[15:25] They asked Jeff T. Ollis to host it and he said, no.

[15:28] Have they never listened to Jeff T. Ollis talk about the Twippies?

[15:31] He makes fun of it in every single podcast.

[15:34] And I don't blame him.

[15:35] Like him and Marty always used to make fun of it.

[15:37] Why would you ask him?

[15:38] Now look, I'm not going to host the Twippies.

[15:40] They're never going to ask me.

[15:41] But we need to not try to fix something that wasn't really broken.

[15:44] Greg and Zach were the greatest hosts of it.

[15:47] We need one award show in which the consumers out there

[15:50] vote on their favorite stuff.

[15:51] And let's just get back to making it what it used to be.

[15:54] I don't think that's going to happen.

[15:56] We're still going to have two award shows.

[15:57] There's going to be the industry awards with the committee voting.

[16:01] And then there's going to be this.

[16:02] And then it's going to make everybody nervous because whoever you get,

[16:05] are they going to be able to keep the Twippies going in a live format?

[16:09] The last Twippies was so bad, ladies and gentlemen,

[16:12] that I'm really, really questioning whether or not

[16:16] I even want to be at Texas for it because it was just so bad

[16:20] being in the audience of that show.

[16:23] And I think they need to hand it back over to the guys who knew how to do it

[16:26] live because the best Twippies ever was the one that was live,

[16:31] where Kaneda got booed and Greg and Zach kept the show going in an entertaining way.

[16:37] And now we're going to go back and try to find new hosts who are going to try to do that.

[16:41] And I think they're going to have a hard time being successful at it.

[16:44] And here we are.

[16:44] It's almost November.

[16:45] There is no hype of the show.

[16:47] And it's just crazy to me.

[16:48] Like, how hard is it?

[16:50] As we're getting to the end of the year, we should start to be teasing these things,

[16:53] start to get people ready to get excited about who they're going to vote for.

[16:57] But absolutely nothing.

[16:58] Radio silence.

[17:00] The guy in New York who doesn't even have a pinball machine set up

[17:04] is talking to you the most on a weekly basis about pinball.

[17:08] It's about time all of these other entities that are making a lot more money than me.

[17:13] A lot more than me.

[17:15] It's about time they bring us along with the journey more.

[17:19] And I mean that.

[17:20] And I feel like we deserve that for this much money.

[17:23] The only get out of jail free card you should get is if you make a masterpiece.

[17:27] And I mean this.

[17:28] When you make a masterpiece, I don't care if you don't go to the awards shows, Keith Elwyn.

[17:32] I don't care if you never talk to me.

[17:34] All I care about is a great game.

[17:36] I don't care even about seeing people at the factory.

[17:39] I don't care about receptionists.

[17:40] I don't care about Dennis Nordman being interviewed.

[17:43] All I want from Nordman is a great game.

[17:45] All we wanted from Pat Lawler was a great game.

[17:48] I don't want to watch a video of Pat Lawler talk about Toy Story because it's the biggest

[17:53] whiff I think we've ever seen in the last five years of pinball.

[17:58] It's almost more of a whiff than Star Wars.

[18:00] It's such a whiff on so many levels that I don't want to hear these videos.

[18:04] I don't want to see him smiling up there with the JJP team.

[18:07] I just want great games, magic, world under glass.

[18:11] Let me ask you a question.

[18:13] In 2022, which game is the magical world under glass?

[18:17] Which game is improving upon what we've seen before in pinball?

[18:21] I'm just going to leave that to you right now.

[18:23] I want you to tell me, email me at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[18:28] Out of all the games that came out in 2022, where is the magic?

[18:33] Legends of the Hala, James Bond, Halloween, Ultraman, what else we got?

[18:38] Rush pinball.

[18:40] Where is the magic?

[18:41] Alien pinball.

[18:42] Alien pinball.

[18:43] Like, these are just games that are shipping right now.

[18:45] I'll just name everything shipping.

[18:47] But tell me, where is the magic?

[18:49] Where is the magic?

[18:50] Am I missing something?

[18:51] Am I being irrational?

[18:53] Is Ed Robertson going to send me a text right now saying, Canada, hang it up.

[18:58] You're clearly not enjoying it.

[19:00] Absolutely, I'm enjoying it.

[19:01] I love doing this show.

[19:03] I just want more for the money.

[19:06] And I think you do too.

[19:07] Everybody have a great day.

[19:08] I'll be back.

[19:09] Maybe tomorrow.

[19:10] Maybe Saturday.

[19:11] I'll pick up the mic anytime I want to talk to you guys about pinball.

[19:14] You're going to get your money's worth with canada.

[19:15] You're not going to be starting for content with canada's pinball podcast.

[19:19] Later everybody.

[19:20] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
