[00:00] 🎵

[00:20] I wish I was announcing like a new Indiana Jones pinball machine by Jersey Jack pinball, but I'm not.

[00:26] I just knew that that theme song would get your emotions going people. Welcome happy Monday morning. I'm your host

[00:33] Canada. This is Canada's pinball podcast. The world's favorite pinball podcast. And I want to say,

[00:39] first and foremost, thank you so much. We are now at a hundred and sixty-seven members of the

[00:46] Canadian club on Patreon. And I want to welcome our new members Jonathan Kay, Eric S. Daniel B.

[00:53] Brad B. Daniel P. Troy S. Ryan R. N. No other than the man himself from the bare naked ladies Mr.

[01:04] Ed Robertson became a member of the Canadian club on my birthday at one thirty-six in the morning.

[01:13] Wasn't sure if he was drinking or not, but he decided to join the club. Ed, welcome to the party.

[01:19] It's about time. So here's what I want to do on this episode. I want to go down and talk about what's

[01:24] happening at each pinball company. It's always nice on a Monday to sort of go through everybody in the

[01:29] hobby and just give you my point of view on where they're at and just some thoughts and observations.

[01:35] And let's jump right in. Let's start out this episode with the letter A. A stands for alien.

[01:42] And the pinball brothers on Friday, September 24th, they revealed to the world the limited version

[01:49] of their alien machine. And I want to talk about how they did this. They put up images on Facebook.

[01:55] Coin ticker is now taking orders. The machine is I think ten thousand six hundred and fifty dollars.

[02:02] And they are making one thousand L. E's of this game. Now when I saw that and I saw they're

[02:08] going to make a thousand L. E's the first thing I thought of was wow they're exactly copying the

[02:13] amount of Godzilla L. E's that just got put out into the world. And Godzilla is also ten thousand

[02:19] five hundred dollars. So these two machines pretty much cost exactly the same and they're going to

[02:25] make exactly the same amount of each game. The only difference is there is one hundred percent

[02:32] confidence in Stern pinball getting you your godzilla L. E before Christmas. When are you going to

[02:39] get your pinball brothers alien L. E machine. If you ordered it last week, when do you think the

[02:45] first ones will ship? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. The track record of getting games quickly from

[02:50] the pinball brothers is not the best. But here's the real confusing part about this whole thing. So

[02:55] they've had months to get the L. E machine together. And when they showed it to the world, it was all

[03:01] just rendered images. None of it was like the actual game being photographed. Everything was rendered.

[03:07] Now I will say if you just look at the game itself with the nice new cabinet artwork, it's got this

[03:12] purple armor, it's got the xenomorph head sort of edged into the armor. I do think the game looks

[03:19] good. I believe this is the art package that Orrick worked on when he did Alien Back for Andrew

[03:24] Highway. I think that translate was the artwork he was working on. And obviously now that the

[03:29] whole back box is not taken up by the big 27 inch screen, you can actually incorporate more of

[03:35] that artwork. It was always kind of strange, right? That they even bothered making that big art

[03:40] back glass on the original highway game because the screen just took up the entire area. Let's do

[03:45] this. Let's go down the features list of this limited version alien machine. And let's ask ourselves,

[03:51] is this enough? Are we getting enough in this package to warrant the price increase to $10,600?

[03:58] So you get custom color powder coated armor pack. All right, so they lead with that. All right,

[04:03] not too expensive to color the armor on a game. The next is new lid up play field backboard art.

[04:11] Now I don't know what that's going to look like because in the renders of this machine,

[04:14] there are no pictures of what that looks like lit up. So it's kind of like take our word for it,

[04:20] but it's going to be there rotating game interactive beacons. Okay, so they're putting exactly the same

[04:27] type of topper on this game that Andrew Highway did so much of this game is just recycled ideas and

[04:33] they're doing it again. I don't have a problem with those beacons up there, but they're not that

[04:38] special. I mean, I bet they're cool when you're playing it and they're going while you're playing

[04:42] the game as minuscule as these beacons look. What I do like about them is during gameplay, they

[04:48] actually serve a function. There are so many toppers out there right now that don't interact with the

[04:54] game at all. They're just up there for eye candy. So I do like the fact that these beacons when

[04:58] they're spinning the kind of atmosphere it would create in the room, especially if you're playing

[05:03] in a dark room and this is alien custom cut Zeno head side armor. Okay, and you can see it at the

[05:08] very end where the button is is the head of the Zeno morph is sort of like cut out there.

[05:13] Limited number dog tag. Okay, now we're really we're really running out of options. Anti-reflective glass

[05:20] duh. Everything has that now. Open pop bumper egg. Okay, here's the funny part. It says open

[05:25] pop bumper egg, but then when you look at the egg, they're not open. All of them are closed. And

[05:30] this is just why are these guys doing this? There's no common sense here. You are putting stuff

[05:36] in the features list and then the very pictures you're sharing with everybody don't even contain

[05:43] those things. And so the question becomes, are they even near production on this at all? Have

[05:49] those things even been sculpted yet? Why? Why are we seeing renders that aren't even accurate?

[05:55] All right, the next thing is the lit inner side blades. Those are really cool. The limited artwork,

[06:00] shaker motor and limited apron. Okay, so they basically they basically are going to start lighting

[06:05] up some of the artwork inside the game, which I think is going to look good. I think the armor

[06:10] looks better. I think overall this does look like a nice version of alien. I will admit this looks

[06:16] far, far better than the SE version of the game they put out in the world a few months ago.

[06:21] The big question with alien pinball remains the same. What's the quality of this machine? I keep

[06:27] seeing people in the owners thread. It's like they're always discussing how to keep these games

[06:31] working and to keep them working consistently. And if you go in on an alien and you love this theme,

[06:38] I think you do have to agree that you're going to be someone who's going to have to maintain

[06:43] this machine. This is not going to be a bulletproof experience. This is not going to be a game

[06:49] in which you never lift the hood. I think this is a game where you're going to have to put up with

[06:54] some quirks and some things you need to tweak and you're going to have to put up with some quality

[06:58] issues. And you're going to have to want to be a part of like this little owner circle that's

[07:03] going to have to help each other out figure out and solve some of the reliability issues that seem

[07:09] to be plaguing this game. The issues were around when Andrew was there. The issues are still there

[07:14] with the pinball brothers. Something about this game just always feels like you need to constantly

[07:19] tweak it to keep it playing right. I also think a thousand LVs of this game and I get it. Like this

[07:25] is all they're going to make. Like there's no other version. Personally, I think a thousand of these

[07:30] is a little ambitious for this company. I do. I don't think they have much trust or credibility

[07:36] where people want to get deep into this list of a thousand of them. I don't think they sold out

[07:41] yet. What I would have done if I were them. And this is just me giving them some quick marketing

[07:46] advice. I just think a thousand is an arbitrary number that means nothing. If I were them, I would have

[07:52] done 426, which is the alien day number. I would have done 426 maybe in purple and 426 in black.

[08:01] Like sparkly black or shiny black like a high gloss black. And I would have had two different

[08:06] versions of the LV 426 each. That way what you're totaling 852 total games. But at least you're

[08:14] making those LVs connect to the alien theme somehow. You're still going to make a ton of them.

[08:19] And you're also going to make people who get one or the other feel really special that they have

[08:23] one of 426. We now live in this space now where like nothing is really limited. And I don't think

[08:30] we're ever going to go back to the days where like in LVs only 4 to 500 units. I think we're

[08:35] going to now start to see everything's like 750 or a thousand. And the way people are spending

[08:40] money in this hobby right now, we might even see Stern push that number up and up and up.

[08:45] Like imagine if Stern has back to the future, are they going to only make a thousand of them? Or

[08:49] 1250 or 1500 LVs. They'll sell every single one. Stern Pimble doesn't care that these things

[08:57] hold value and go up. They want to get as much money through the door on day one. And people would

[09:04] they would go in on it and they can absolutely control the number. And feeling special doesn't

[09:09] matter. It's all about the bottom line. It's all about the profit. So this is the alien LV. We'll see

[09:15] how it does. It's another game in the mix. All right. So alien, 10,650 dollars. Godzilla, 10,500

[09:25] dollars. Willy Wonka is coming back at Jersey Jack Pimble. So that was the other announcement. So

[09:30] when I said that we were going to hear a Jersey Jack Pimble game announcement very soon,

[09:35] I wasn't wrong. I was 100% wrong that it was going to be toy story. Now I have some news on that

[09:42] front for everybody. But clearly this was the announcement that they were going to make,

[09:47] that they were going to rerun Willy Wonka and they were going to do us a favor by increasing

[09:52] the price of Willy Wonka L.E.s. Willy Wonka L.E.s used to be $9,500. Now the same game,

[10:02] nothing at it, nothing given to you that's special. The same game is now going to cost you $11,000.

[10:08] Now what does that do for the price of every single Willy Wonka L.E. now? Are they all now worth

[10:14] $11,000? I'm not surprised they're doing this. There are increased costs to labor that are

[10:19] happening right now. There's an increasing cost to goods and materials they need to make these

[10:24] Pimble machines. I'm not surprised they're doing this because they're looking at what games are

[10:28] selling for and they're looking at the fact that most distributors don't have much new inbox

[10:33] ready to go. That if you can give them something brand new, wouldn't you rather buy a brand new

[10:39] never played before Willy Wonka versus one that's opened. And for most of these guys out there that

[10:45] have money, they always want it brand new. Like nobody really wants to use car, nobody wants to use

[10:51] Pimble machine, they want it brand new. And so now you can have it and you can have it for $11,000

[10:57] and there's no haggling. There's no bartering back and forth. You get it. It's going to be hopefully

[11:02] in mint condition when you take it out of the box. But I won't lie when I saw this and this is

[11:07] just another example of pinflation happening around this and it doesn't excite me. Like am I

[11:12] excited? Willy Wonka's back. No, you know, I'm like, okay, cool. They're making more. Am I

[11:17] excited that it's higher than it used to be? No, why would anybody be excited the game is costing more?

[11:22] I just kind of look at these moves like wow, this hobby has become so expensive. And there's no

[11:27] way around it. It must be pretty hard for Jersey Jack Pimble to look over at Stern Pimble and

[11:33] realize that Stern is now charging 10-5 for their machines. It must be hard because look how much more

[11:39] Jersey Jack puts into their games. Remember Wizard of Oz was originally $6,500. Now an

[11:46] LE of a game is almost double that, right? Double that. And Stern is making all this money now and

[11:52] their profit margins must be through the roof as they realize that Jersey Jack Pimble many, many

[11:58] years ago showed Stern Pimble that the ceiling was much higher than Stern thought and they've been

[12:05] capitalizing on it ever since. But show of hands out there, who's happy by all of this? Are you

[12:11] guys excited that Pimble machines are now so expensive? The more I see these prices going up,

[12:17] the decision for me to just stay out of the new inbox frenzy becomes easier and easier and easier.

[12:24] I'm probably going to end up just going to Jack Bar more and playing Pimble machines on location

[12:28] more than I ever did before because I just don't feel the need to own these machines. I don't

[12:33] want to tie up $20,000 in two games. So I think a location play is going to become a lot more

[12:40] enticing as these prices keep going up and up and up. And by the way, I want to say thank you to

[12:46] everybody who gave me a happy birthday wish this weekend. I had the most amazing time, the most

[12:53] amazing time Brenda took me to Omokassi. She surprised me with all my friends there and then we went

[12:59] to Jack Bar and played Pimble and drank until I can't remember how I got home. So it was that kind

[13:05] of a good evening and I want to thank each and every one of you who said happy birthday to me. I

[13:09] really do appreciate it. I really do. And what a special day it was going over to automate it

[13:14] and visiting Mike and I hung out with Mike and we did our really fun Saturday morning spectacular

[13:20] Mike. Thank you so much. Mike is the nicest guy. If you've never met Mike at Automated, oh my god,

[13:25] he's really one of the most genuine, nice and sweet people I've ever met in this hobby and it

[13:31] was so great being there. It was so great getting Brad, his Godzilla Ellie. We had 15 people try to

[13:36] get it. Brad won the Canadian Saturday morning, Godzilla Ellie spectacular and he is paying

[13:43] manufacturers advertised price for the game, which is $10,499. Thank you to everyone who entered

[13:50] to win that. We're going to do it every time. We're going to go to Automated whenever there's a really

[13:54] hot game and we're going to give someone a chance to pay the price they should for the game. So Mike,

[14:00] I will be seeing you many times in the future and thanks so much for the hospitality. But speaking

[14:05] of prices, right, it's just getting to the point now where these pins are no longer cheap.

[14:10] Even the premiums are so expensive, Willy Wonka is $11,000. What do you think the price is going to be

[14:16] of the next collector's edition from Jersey Jack Pimball? I think it's going to be $15,000. Why

[14:22] wouldn't they price it at that? I do have a pretty reliable rumor about what's happening over at

[14:27] Jersey Jack Pimball. The rumor is this that the reason why they're making more Willy Wonka's

[14:32] is not because everybody wants Willy Wonka again. The reason why they're making more Willy Wonka's

[14:38] is they're waiting on guns and roses parts. So there's always been like procurement issues with

[14:43] Jersey Jack Pimball and making guns and roses is not going as fast as they would like. Hearing a

[14:50] rumor that they're making around 10 machines a day. So 50 games a week, like that's not a lot. Like

[14:57] we don't see a ton of guns and roses unboxings, do you? I haven't seen a ton. And so I'm hearing that

[15:04] there is a parts issue and that is why they are putting Wonka back on the line, right? You have to

[15:09] keep the line going. The other rumor I'm hearing is this and this is again, this is just a rumor. I'm

[15:14] also hearing that toy story by Pat Lawler isn't even done yet. And so toy stories not done yet.

[15:21] Of course they're not going to announce that they're not going to reveal it and why is it taking

[15:26] Pat Lawler so long to finish games? People forget when he may dial then he may Jack wait almost two

[15:33] years past the due date of that game. He also dragged his feet the first time he was making toy

[15:39] story and that's why they had to switch the titles from toy story to Willy Wonka because he

[15:44] couldn't hit the deadline to release the game with the movie. Pat Lawler takes a really long time.

[15:50] Pat Lawler does make incredible games and I would argue that yes, maybe they're worth the wait

[15:56] but unfortunately whenever there are long delays at Jersey Jack Pimball that doesn't help the

[16:02] company out. The more they're off schedule, the more they're off deadline, the more that hurts them

[16:07] financially. It hurts their ability to sync up with their license holders and there are also,

[16:12] here's a crazy part two. They also the clock is ticking on how long they have the license for

[16:18] each of these games and the more time they burn in development and the less time the games are

[16:24] actually out there for sale, that clock is ticking and it's expensive to secure the licenses for

[16:30] these games. It's not super cheap. So Jersey Jack more Willy Wonka's I just have one wish for

[16:35] Jersey Jack. I just have one thing I hope Jersey Jack can do now that we're paying $11,000 for

[16:40] machines and $12, 5 and $10, 5 for G&R. Jersey Jack can you please replace the flipper rubbers in your

[16:48] games? I saw another photo yesterday of a brand new Guns and Roses with 200 plays on it and

[16:56] legitimately the flipper rubber is all black and worn through pretty much to the plastic of the

[17:03] flipper. Why Jersey Jack are you using the cheapest flipper rubbers on planet earth? Can you please

[17:11] upgrade those for us? Can you do it for Canada? Can you do it for Canada? I really would appreciate it.

[17:16] Alright so Jersey Jack we've got pinball brothers. Let's go over to storm pinball. Right now,

[17:20] storm pinball, it's a little bit of that quiet before the storm. Godzilla's are on the line.

[17:26] Godzilla Ellie's will be on the line in October and we're going to see nothing but Godzilla

[17:31] conversation dominate the pinball world over the next few weeks. I think people who have issues with

[17:37] the Godzilla artwork. I think they're getting over it. I'm starting to see more and more people

[17:41] sort of come around and understand the approach they went with the art package. It's hard to look at

[17:47] Godzilla and just not get excited. Right? It's hard to look at that game and not have a smile. Like

[17:53] it looks like a lot of fun. There is a ton in it like Stern finally did some mechs in a game.

[17:59] The colorful artwork. It's all fun. Like when I was at my ex I noticed that. I'm like man when

[18:04] I stood over Batman 66 I'm like this is it like pinball should be bright. It should be colorful. It

[18:10] should pop. It should draw you into the game and nobody is giving you art packages that do that

[18:16] better than Stern right now. I mean their games are just colorful. They're bright. They look good

[18:21] next to each other and I think sometimes over the internet we like to cry and complain about

[18:26] some of the decisions they make from an artistic standpoint but there is no denying a fact that if

[18:31] you put every single Stern next to each other and I mean even Led Zeppelin premium I was standing

[18:36] over a Led Zeppelin premium and it also is colorful. It's bright. It's inviting. This is what pinball

[18:42] is supposed to be. It's supposed to be attractive and I do think when you look at these modern Stern

[18:47] machines with all of these art packages sure we can nitpick but for the most part these things do

[18:53] pull us in. They do look great. They look better than all the games from the 90s. I mean let's not

[18:58] let's not fool ourselves and think the old games look this good. You know when you combine the

[19:02] colorful artwork that these new games have with the LCD displays and the good speakers in them now

[19:08] these games I just think modern pinball is here. Modern pinball is here with incredible artwork very

[19:14] vibrant and you've got a lot more like visual wow happening with modern pinball than you ever did

[19:20] before with some of the older games. Alright what's happening over at Haggis pinball still

[19:24] no fathoms on the line and I'm going into the thread I'm like there's not much activity there

[19:29] so I hope to see this game soon I don't know what the latest is but if you're in on a fathom

[19:34] the weight continues. Alright let's talk about spooky pinball now spooky pinball is a company right

[19:40] now that I think is in an interesting place they've sold through a lot of Halloween's and a lot

[19:46] of ultra man machines and now we all wait this is the waiting period right everyone is waiting to see

[19:51] if spooky's code update I think it's October 1st if the code update for Halloween improves what

[19:59] we've seen so far there's a lot of pressure on spooky right now this is a company that is selling

[20:04] $9,000 pinball machines which is a pretty good price for a spooky pinball machine so people's

[20:10] expectations of these games are higher than they've ever been before right when it was at little

[20:16] boutique company where you spent five to six thousand dollars on their machine you didn't mind

[20:21] seeing like hot glue gun stuff everywhere you know you didn't mind seeing like 3d printed stuff in

[20:26] the game but now that these games are more expensive people are demanding more and Halloween especially

[20:32] Halloween because you've got a fan base that loves this movie they want to see more of the movie

[20:38] in the game so that's the big question mark with spooky right now will they be able to satisfy

[20:45] on a code level both the ultra man and the Halloween fan bases I think the ultra man fan bases a lot

[20:52] easier to satisfy because I don't think there's that many die hard ultra man fans that are going to

[20:58] nitpick this thing it's the Halloween people that I think are going to be a lot more difficult to

[21:04] please and also because of where the animations have been and the lack of movie clips in this game

[21:11] it's created a lot of anxiety for these Halloween buyers it's so funny when you read the

[21:17] Halloween thread because you can see some of these owners like trying to convince themselves that

[21:21] it's all going to be okay that it's all going to work out in the end and I don't know yet like

[21:27] I'm I'm sort of observing this I'm observing what's going on I don't know if it's all just going

[21:32] to work out as easy as people think I think they committed to an animator that I'm not quite sure

[21:38] is up to the caliber in fact I know these animations are not up to the caliber of where pinball

[21:43] animations need to be I know the clips in the game right now are not up to the par of where theme

[21:48] integration needs to be with a movie like this so nothing I've seen so far has really been that

[21:54] impressive so why do we think if the same people working on it why do we think they're all of a

[22:00] sudden going to be able to flip a switch and create it in a way that's going to blow us away I

[22:05] hope it does I hope they do but I'm just not sure I'm just not sure they have the right talent

[22:12] on the field to change the outcome of this game after half time okay and it feels like that right

[22:17] they went into the locker room and spooky's meeting and discussing how are they going to make people

[22:22] more excited with this code so time will tell I'm not going to slam it now but time will tell

[22:28] but I do think a lot of people are scratching their heads and wondering what exactly did I buy

[22:34] with Halloween the game shoots great it does the software is the only thing that can let the

[22:40] hardware down on this game there's not a lot else happening in the industry right now I'm very

[22:45] happy that this damn auction at the pinball museum is over it's been so annoying seeing these games

[22:51] sell for fifteen thousand dollars for Lord the Rings Ellie these games are just being sold at

[22:57] prices that are just stupid I think pirates of the Caribbean CE with all fees is like forty thousand

[23:02] dollars magic girl actually he lost money on magic girl I sold them my magic girl for twenty

[23:08] thousand dollars and I think it sold for eighteen five okay now he knew it didn't work when I sold

[23:13] it to him for twenty thousand dollars what's funny if you want to know the ultimate indictment of

[23:18] pat lawlers dialed in I think dialed in at that auction only sold for like eight thousand dollars

[23:24] or eighty five hundred dollars how is that possible how is it like every single game went for so

[23:29] much more than it's worth but dialed in actually went for what it's worth market value just goes

[23:34] to show the power of a license theme because I think a lot of people bidding on these they read about

[23:41] this auction in the New York Times or Wall Street Journal they saw it in the news and they ran to

[23:46] this thing and they probably don't know they don't know they just know that like I love Lord the Rings

[23:51] and there's the Ellie machine and I think a lot of people are thinking that because this stuff is

[23:55] coming from the pinball museum that these are museum quality games no these are not museum quality

[24:01] games by any means these games all have a lot of plays on them here's what things gonna happen I

[24:06] think a lot of rich people went and bought these things they're gonna end up in their home they're

[24:10] not gonna turn it on very much and when they go to sell it they're not even gonna care because nobody

[24:14] who knows pinball would ever spend these prices nobody nobody who knows and loves pinball would ever

[24:21] spend these prices on these games these are all newbies who just ran to this hobby during this

[24:28] moment because they got caught up in the excitement of an auction it was fun to watch these prices go

[24:33] it was fun to watch it now do I think these prices are gonna change the prices of pinball machines

[24:38] moving forward absolutely not pinball machines are going up regardless of this auction and I think

[24:44] for a lot of us out there right now and I mean this for a lot of us out there right now we are all

[24:48] staring at what's in our checking account we're all staring at what our salaries are and we're all

[24:54] starting to realize whether you're richer poor pinball is now very very expensive it's the most

[25:01] expensive it's ever been in the history of pinball and the inflation has happened on a level lately

[25:08] that nobody quite expected if I told you four years ago a spooky machine would be $10,000 you

[25:15] would call me crazy if I told you five years ago stern will sell $15,000 machines with a piece of

[25:21] couch and nothing else in it you would call me crazy and now we're seeing those very games like if

[25:26] you bought in a viral collectors edition now it's worth $30,000 or $26,000 the world has gone nuts

[25:36] each and every one of us has the decision to make do I jump in now or do I just wait it out

[25:42] personally it's easy for me to wait it out because I don't have room and I don't have the money

[25:46] I have to be honest with everything going on in my life with daycare with savings for the future

[25:51] with card payments with maintenance payments with just quality of life and just being able to take

[25:56] a few vacations I want to travel down to pinball expo I don't want to tie up tens of thousands of

[26:03] dollars in a pinball machine this birthday weekend showed me to like Brenda rented out the restaurant

[26:09] then we all went to jack bar I would rather spend a few thousand dollars on a moment I'll never

[26:14] forget on a moment that won't happen ever again then just always chase these new machines because I

[26:21] just don't think pinball gives you an experience that is going to fulfill you at this price point I

[26:27] really don't I really don't and again I would much rather go and play on location and have some

[26:34] beers and support our friends out there in the world and not feel like I have to put this thing in my

[26:39] house I have to study this code for the next six months I have to try to reach this wizard mode I'm

[26:44] never going to get to again that's just me personally and I'm and I'm being completely honest with you

[26:49] I'm going to be completely transparent I just don't see the value at these prices I just don't see

[26:54] the experience equaling this much money now all of a sudden will you want because eleven thousand

[26:59] dollars I'm sorry I just don't see eleven thousand dollars there but that's just me that's just me

[27:05] I just want to have a pocket full of quarters go play some pinball drinks and whiskey have some beer

[27:10] and enjoy this hobby in a way that shouldn't break the bank but for many of us out there this hobby

[27:16] really is starting to break the bank and chip away at our enthusiasm for it it's just crazy I mean

[27:22] I just don't want to see like Ghostbuster premiums selling for like thirteen thousand dollars like

[27:28] what happened a premium it's not even an L.E. everybody happy Monday I love this hobby I love

[27:35] reporting on it and I don't cost you much I really don't cost you much for most of you out there

[27:40] you get this for free some of you understand the amount of work I put into this so you contribute

[27:44] on patreon so thank you so much and then some of you out there show your contributions other ways

[27:49] like Viva Laraza t-shirts we're gonna get them all sold there's fifty left there's more going out

[27:53] the door this week and we have more orders coming in I can't wait for all you guys to be rocking

[27:58] your Viva Laraza's at Expo it's gonna be so much fun everybody have a great Monday and don't forget

[28:04] this week some point this week we are going to talk to David fix at American pinball that's why I

[28:10] didn't cover American pinball on this show because why speculate when we're gonna have the man

[28:15] himself come on the show and we're gonna talk about American pinball what their plans are and what

[28:20] the future looks like for that company so super excited to have David fix on the show I think he's

[28:25] gonna be a great guest I think it's gonna be one of my best interviews because this has been a

[28:29] company that I know I've been hard on but you know me we will be very respectful and I really want

[28:35] to give David the stage to talk about AP and what his plans are for that company so look forward to

[28:39] that this week other than that I don't think there's that much news I really don't I think you're

[28:43] gonna see Godzilla pro shipping and then we're gonna go from there all right have a great day we'll

[28:48] talk to you soon
