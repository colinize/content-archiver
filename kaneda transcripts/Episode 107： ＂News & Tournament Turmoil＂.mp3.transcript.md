[00:00] Swimming in women with their own condominiums, five plus fives,

[00:04] Who drive millenniums to solve about the Benjamin's what?

[00:07] I get a 50 pound bag of oof for the mutt.

[00:10] It's all about the Benjamin's what?

[00:19] I love that line from Puff Daddy, and we're gonna talk about the Benjamin's and the money,

[00:24] because I've been up since 4am, and I've been up since 4am,

[00:28] simply because Bubba was like, woof, and woke me up.

[00:31] I had to take him for a walk, and after that I couldn't go back to sleep.

[00:35] So I was reading up on a lot of what's been going on on PINSIDE,

[00:38] and I have to talk about all the different news items that have been popping this week.

[00:44] This is what we do on this podcast.

[00:45] I also want to let you guys know that I had a great interview with Rare Hero,

[00:50] Mr. Greg Colton.

[00:52] We guys know him very well on PINSIDE, works on Family Guy.

[00:55] I'm gonna air that interview later this week,

[00:57] so I think you guys are gonna really enjoy that, but that will be next.

[01:01] That will be next. We have a busy schedule.

[01:02] We have a busy schedule. I'm talking to JJ, a game exchange.

[01:06] Lots of stuff going on with interviews, but I want to mix in the new stuff,

[01:10] because I think you guys also turn to this podcast every week to just get caught up on the latest and the greatest.

[01:14] So I have one rule on this podcast.

[01:18] I have one rule, and I'm about to break it, and that rule is that I don't talk about tournament talk,

[01:25] because I think talking about tournament pinball is the most boring thing to discuss on a podcast.

[01:32] It doesn't mean I think that competitive pinball is not cool to engage in.

[01:37] I think it's the worst thing to talk about, but there is an unavoidable thing that has happened

[01:43] in the pinball universe that is just creating such shockwaves that I would be ignorant

[01:50] as a pinball news podcast not to talk about it.

[01:53] And that is the fact that the IFPA, with the International Flipber Pimball Association,

[01:59] has decided to announce on April 1st of no other day, April Fools Day, that they are going to

[02:06] charge $1 entries during all IFPA sanctioned events.

[02:13] And I'm not going to bore you guys with the, I read through so many of the 13 pages plus

[02:20] of this discussion, and I'm going to summarize it as best as I can.

[02:24] And here's my summary of it.

[02:25] The reason they want to charge a dollar per sanctioned event is to collect money to then

[02:33] distribute that money to winners at both the state level and winners at both the national level.

[02:41] So for example, if you're in New York and you go to an IFPA sanctioned event,

[02:47] you pay a dollar to enter that event that evening.

[02:51] It's every time you go.

[02:52] And then that money, I think it gets distributed something like 75% of it goes to the New York state

[02:58] champion and then 25% goes to national. And obviously national will be collecting a pool from

[03:03] all 50 states.

[03:05] So they announced this, Josh Sharp announces this, and all of it, you know, right away, right away,

[03:14] there's like how the hell can they charge people to play competitive pinball?

[03:18] This is nothing but greed, this is nothing but them fattening their wallets.

[03:23] And I think the funny thing is if you read the thread, and I know we pick on this guy a lot,

[03:28] but there's a reason why. There's a reason why because he's just always pops up.

[03:32] He's sort of like, it's like whack him all. It's like whack a hilton.

[03:36] But a hilton chimes it and is basically like, what the F is this?

[03:43] Like this is BS. And I think what he's really mad about, and it comes through in so many of his

[03:48] posts, is that nobody consulted him on this, right? So he sees himself as like the leader of

[03:55] tournament pinball and over there in Wisconsin and Madison pinball, they do a whole bunch of

[04:01] tournaments. And so there's just the funny, just go read the thread. There's a funny back and forth

[04:06] between him and Josh, like for pages about him saying this and him saying that. And what's my take

[04:13] on this whole thing? So I don't really give a shit, all right? That's my first take on this whole

[04:18] thing. I don't think one dollar is enough to get all of your pennies in a wide people about every

[04:25] time you go to play pinball at a sanctioned event, they ask for a dollar to go into the pool.

[04:30] I fail to see how that's a big deal. I really do. Especially in a hobby where people are

[04:38] spending eight to fifteen thousand dollars on machines, hundreds of dollars on pointless mods,

[04:45] one pointless mod would pay for your tournament entry for years. I think it's not a big deal.

[04:51] I also think that the IFPA does a lot of hard work and doesn't get compensated for it. And I

[04:58] never understood this notion that people should work for free, that the sharps should do all this work,

[05:05] coordinating hundreds of players across 50 states, all these tournaments, tournament directors,

[05:12] all the stuff that goes into that. And then they're not really paid for their services. So the notion

[05:18] that they want to start collecting money, it doesn't scare me, it doesn't make me feel like that's

[05:24] inappropriate or doesn't feel like it's a greedy move. Now there are a lot of logistical things

[05:32] that people pointed out that these guys didn't really think through. One of them being when you

[05:38] collect money to then redistribute to people in terms of winnings, all of a sudden that becomes

[05:44] gambling and prize money. And so there's different laws in each state and there's different

[05:49] taxes associated with those types of earnings, especially when you get over a certain dollar amount.

[05:57] So I don't know if they really did the due diligence on how this would really work logistically

[06:04] from state to state. It doesn't sound like they did. Again, I really don't give a shit. I don't

[06:09] think any lawmakers are going to come down or any the IRS is going to come after someone's

[06:15] pinball winnings. I could be wrong, you could get audit it, but for the most part, I don't think anyone

[06:21] really gives a shit. And so I think both sides of this issue are sort of acting kind of ridiculous.

[06:30] I think Hilton's being crazy for like flying off to handle, making it sound like Wisconsin is the

[06:35] center of the pinball universe and they must always be consulted whenever anything occurs that

[06:41] has to do with tournament play. If Hilton's not consulted, everything you do is complete gibberish.

[06:47] I think he's acting like a little kid and I think he types before he speaks. I also think the

[06:52] IFPA and Josh didn't really think this thing through, right? I mean Josh said in one of his posts,

[07:02] we're just going to test this out. And he said like, I have no fucking idea. He said,

[07:06] NFI, no fucking idea if this will work. And when I read that, I was kind of like, man, what?

[07:14] Are you serious, bro? Like, you're trying to market this thing. You're trying to market this thing

[07:19] and you're trying to sell people on a new approach for IFPA. You're running it and you want to come

[07:26] out and say you have no fucking idea it's going to work. I mean, I just when I read stuff like that,

[07:33] I'm like, are you being honest or you just being naive and ignorant and asking people to follow

[07:40] you down this ignorant journey of yours because if you're marketing your thing, you've made a decision

[07:45] to do this and now you need to market it and get people on board. At that level, I have no fucking idea

[07:52] if it will work is not an acceptable way to sell this thing to people, bro. Like, take a marketing class,

[07:58] take marketing one on one. Every day when I go in and talk to clients about ideas, you think I

[08:03] don't get that question like, is this going to work, Chris? Like, if we tap into this new story,

[08:07] are we going to get coverage? If I said to my clients, I have no fucking idea, they would never

[08:13] hire me to do anything. They would never have any faith or credibility or trust me in what I'm

[08:18] doing. So Josh, man, you got to grow up a little bit, bro. I'm serious. And then when I read like

[08:24] these Pimbal organizations are having a hard time getting sponsorships and corporate sponsors,

[08:29] that's exactly why. It's just this inability for Pimbal companies and people associate it with it

[08:38] to act professional is the reason why corporate dollars don't really pay attention to Pimbal.

[08:45] And there's another reason why I'll get to in a second, but no one really has their act together.

[08:50] Like, imagine I work for ABI, I work for Budweiser, Bud Light, all these big brands. I mean,

[08:55] we sponsor stuff all the time. Imagine me walking into a room with my clients and then a Hilton.

[09:02] Imagine him trying to sell them on something. And again, it's like these people,

[09:08] they're so passionate, but they can't act professional. And that's the problem is the industry

[09:14] is really just sort of like, wing in it. And that's fine, right? Pimbal is just in a bar and you drink

[09:19] beers and you're having fun playing it. Again, it's the number one reason why I don't give a

[09:23] fuck about all this tournament play and this competitive play and these league nights, I go to play

[09:28] Pimbal for fun. For me, I'd rock up to the bar and I throw 20 bucks on the table and be like,

[09:34] when are gets it? Like, do we really need this organization on a national level to find who's

[09:39] the best in the state, who's the best in the country, who gives a shit. As it was said in the thread,

[09:44] everyone always knows it's the same 20 dudes who win everything. So that's another reason why

[09:49] people don't want to pay because it's like, cool, I'm going to pay money. I'm like just a casual

[09:55] player just to make these like pro guys richer. And again, the term pro Pimbal player is

[10:03] oxymoronic and doesn't really mean much. But I love doing someone pointed out in the thread,

[10:08] a very basic thing. That the best Pimbal player in the country, the best Pimbal player. If he wins

[10:14] the national Pimbal tournament, what is he get? What is he get? I think it's something like a

[10:20] free Stern machine and maybe if you factor in all this money being collected, he might get like

[10:25] 15 grand, 20 grand at most. If you're the best Pimbal player in the country. Meanwhile,

[10:32] the best Dart player, right? Someone who throws darts at a wall gets $2 million. People who win

[10:41] putt putt tournaments, national putt putt miniature golf tournaments make hundreds of thousands of

[10:47] dollars. So you have to ask yourself, why does the country's best Pimbal player only make like 20 grand?

[10:55] And the answer is super simple. And it's again, it's a reason why I don't talk about tournament

[10:59] talk on this podcast is that watching people play competitive Pimbal is the most boring,

[11:05] fucking thing you can watch. It is so boring to watch. It's not boring to play. It's not boring to

[11:13] be engaged with it, but it's so boring to watch. I would rather watch someone throw darts. I would

[11:19] rather watch someone try to sink a putt things that take a matter of seconds to either succeed or

[11:26] fail at to watch someone to watch someone play competitive Pimbal is is tantamount to watching

[11:32] paint dry. I mean, imagine like a national commentator being like, here we are, Jim, at the

[11:37] National Pimbal tournament in the final round of the tournament. And crazy levy has just hit

[11:43] the orbit multiplier 25 times in a row. Amazing. Hit the amount of times he's hit that orbit.

[11:50] And now he's scoring up 25 times stacked multi-ball jackpots. Fuck me. Fuck that. It will never work.

[11:58] It's not going to be the thing that so that's why that's why corporate brands will never sponsor

[12:03] it that much because it's just not that exciting. There's no way around it. We all know that the most

[12:09] exciting thing to follow in Pimbal are new in box machines and collecting Pimbal and watching all

[12:16] the drama come out with people trying to pre-order and get their machines. That is far more exciting

[12:20] to me than all this tournament. I have PA talk, but I think I've done my due diligence. I want to reach

[12:27] out to Josh Sharp to see if I'll come on and explain this whole thing and if there's a way to sort

[12:32] of put it in layman's terms that won't put my listeners to sleep. But at the end of the day,

[12:36] guys, just buck up and pay the fucking dollar. I think the real reason Josh did it and he's not,

[12:42] and if he was just honest, he would say it. The reason why we're doing this is we want to thin out

[12:48] the amount of people that we have to manage with the IFPA. It's just going to get unruly and

[12:55] Hilton stop being such a freaking idiot. The sharps saves Pimbal. The sharps are Pimbal royalty.

[13:03] They will always be Pimbal royalty. You will never be. So attacking the sharps is never a good move

[13:10] without them. You wouldn't even have your silly Madison Wisconsin Pimbal League. So show them some

[13:16] respect, dude. Zoom out from your little world in Wisconsin and show them some respect, right?

[13:22] So look, I think the IFPA's move was not delivered in the best way. But I think it's important

[13:30] to then weed out all the casual players who will just play for fun and don't give a shit.

[13:34] Those guys will go and have their own leagues and their own times and entertainment with Pimbal.

[13:39] But this was meant to make the serious guys like be the ones who IFPA is tracking and IFPA is

[13:46] sort of responsible for on a weekly basis. So I think that's why they did it. Again, I don't give a

[13:51] shit. So let's go on to other news that's happening in the hobby. So I saw this too. There's a lot of

[13:57] this. This rumor pops up every once in a while that ACDC is going to be rerun. That this is going

[14:04] to be the next Stern Vault. And I love it whenever these rumors from, you know, I heard from a Stern

[14:09] employee and then someone's like, I heard it too. So that means it's true. When two people confirm

[14:14] that they're anonymous friends, it's Stern told them that they're rerunning ACDC. You are guaranteed

[14:19] to get it. I always read those things and I'm like, all right, well, how many years have we heard

[14:23] that Tron's going to be remade and how many years have we heard that Lord of the Rings is going to be

[14:27] remade. And if there's one game that doesn't need to be remade because they made so freaking many of

[14:34] them, it's ACDC. So what are my thoughts on ACDC rerun? And the other rumor out there too is that

[14:42] there's going to be a walking dead rerun with the comic book art. Okay? Like you could just

[14:48] throw out any remake and whatever. It's like, it's just speculation. So I think a lot of people out

[14:53] there who say like, I don't really mind. That's cool. Like rerun ACDC. I just hope it's not like

[15:01] the Lucy edition. The fact of the matter is this. I think people who buy new and boxed Stern machines,

[15:07] anyone who buys an Ellie or like a Lucy edition is not happy about reruns. And the reason why

[15:16] is people want something that's special and something that's limited. And Stern has to be careful

[15:22] here. Stern has to be really careful because they can't burn the candle from both ends of the candle.

[15:30] They have to make sure that they don't fuck over the collectors, the home collector who is

[15:38] their biggest target right now by rerunning stuff too much and destroying the resill value

[15:46] of certain machines that people collect. And I know that the player out there, the pinball player

[15:53] who doesn't get a shit who just wants to be able to get machines at a good price because he

[15:58] loves playing pinball. He's super excited. To that guy, remakes and vault additions are his oyster

[16:05] and he applauds it. And I could see it on pinside. There's like pressure. There's pressure to just

[16:13] go with the flow and say you're excited for remakes. And whenever someone says, I'm not happy about

[16:19] this because I bought something that was supposed to be limited and now they're going to screw over

[16:25] my limited item if they redo it. That person always gets down voted. And I don't know why because

[16:30] I really think that person's being honest. I really do. People who have Lucy's are really happy

[16:37] that they can go sell them used for $8,000 plus. People who have back and blocks are really happy

[16:43] with what they're getting. And if Sternery does it, if they remake Lucy, of course the Lucy

[16:48] prices will go down. Now you could argue that that Lucy prices never were supposed to be the way

[16:54] they were. That it was just a limited, it was just a run at the end. It wasn't limited. Remember,

[16:59] Lucy's were not limited. They were going to make as many as people ordered. But because so many people

[17:03] had already bought ACDC, Lucy ended up coming out in low volumes and thus became a really desirable

[17:10] version of ACDC. And the artwork is really cool. And I still think it's the coolest ACDC to have.

[17:16] Like I think if I had anyone, I would have Lucy. I actually think that the back and black ones and

[17:21] all those ones with like Photoshop art kind of look like shit. At least Lucy's got like the majority

[17:26] of the art on the back box and cabinet hand drawn. So there's also people saying, well, what if like

[17:31] Dirty Donnie reduzzi, DC and hand draws it? How awesome would that be? Yes, it would be absolutely

[17:37] awesome. And for those people who say, well artwork doesn't really matter to me. It's the gameplay.

[17:44] Get the fuck out of here. Artwork doesn't matter. Are you kidding me? The artwork is almost everything

[17:50] on a classic pen that's already a proven shooter that already has great code that's already like

[17:56] kind of like one of Stern's greatest pins of all time. If they enhance the artwork, that would be

[18:02] the most desirable version of ACDC that people would want. And it really brings up the question. And

[18:07] people say this all the time. It's just is nothing collectible. Is nothing Stern makes collectible?

[18:14] And I have a hard time deciding whether or not that's an accurate statement. Because we're collectors

[18:24] and we want something that is collectible. And that is just the nature of collectors is I think people

[18:30] really do want to have something that's limited. For example, Ghostbusters, Ellie owners, I know all

[18:36] them are very happy that they have one of only 500 of those machines out in the world. And there's

[18:44] not many of them in the slimer edition with with the green armor is you know, feel special. And those

[18:50] guys feel that way about it. And that's why you don't see many Ghostbusters Ellie's come up for sale.

[18:56] When you do now see them come up for sale. They are for sale above $8,000, which is more than the game

[19:02] was even new. So I think that that's it's important to make those people feel like you're not going

[19:10] to hoodwink them and and and do another run of the game that becomes even more collectible.

[19:16] Now look, do I think Stern cares about that? I don't and we saw that with the walking dead when they

[19:24] said there's an Ellie and a pro and there's not going to be a premium. They sold out of the Ellie

[19:28] and then they launched the premium. Right so Stern's in it for the money. Stern's in it for the money.

[19:33] And if the reason why Stern is going to rerun ACDC, none of it has to do with whether or not they're

[19:39] worried about the collectors and if people feel like they're going to get screwed. If they feel they

[19:44] can make money rerunning Lucy and and make another thousand of them, they will and they'll collect that

[19:50] money and and they'll listen to people bitch about how they'll never buy another Stern and Stern is

[19:55] once again sort of shown they don't care about the collector and then they'll announce Star Wars

[20:00] and everyone will buy Star Wars and then they'll announce you know Deadpool and everyone will buy

[20:04] Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy whatever it is like Stern isn't have to worry and the reason why

[20:08] I don't think Stern cares about the collector or hurting the collector or pissing them off.

[20:15] It goes back to one very simple thing. The reason they don't care is Stern has no competition.

[20:21] Stern has no competition. It would be different if there was another boutique manufacturer out there

[20:27] that was offering truly limited games that were great. Nobody out there is offering truly

[20:33] limited games that are great and if they did if they did then people that would really hurt the

[20:40] Stern Ellie buyer right it would really prevent people from buying S.L. Lee Stern's. I think

[20:45] Stern would have a hard time constantly selling out right they sell out of their L.E.s immediately

[20:51] to those collectors. I think like if someone like Dutch Pimball could have got their act together

[20:56] properly and had enough cadence of pins that were premium and limited that that would hurt Stern's

[21:04] Ellie market. I think the guy who had the best approach to it who really knew what he was doing

[21:10] when it came to the marketing of it but just failed horrendously on the execution was John

[21:15] Papaduke. Zidware games where he was going with these highly artistic highly creative absolutely

[21:21] beautiful Pimball machines that were also special and also limited for a high amount of money

[21:29] they would have been the ones people wanted. So I say make all the ACDs as you want Stern. Make

[21:34] make make make another 3,000 of them because there's only going to be 25 or less magic girls in the

[21:39] world. You're just going to keep up in the value of my magic girl that more Stern's they make.

[21:43] But I don't think Stern's are collectible. I don't think you can look at them as collectibles

[21:48] and if we talk about Star Wars they're going to do the same thing with Star Wars. So for you guys

[21:53] like I'm one of them included I'm on a Star Wars list. I'm excited. I feel like I'm going to get

[21:58] one of the desired collectible versions of Star Wars but here's my prediction of what's going to

[22:03] happen for Star Wars and I think it's going to be just like ACDC. I think they're going to do a

[22:07] light side of the force and a dark side of the force. I think they're probably going to make

[22:12] 500 of each a thousand which is a lot to begin with. Nobody's going to really want the light side

[22:18] of the force unless they put Yoda on it which I hope they do with green armor being credible.

[22:24] And then what will happen though? They'll sell out of all those LEs. They'll sell out.

[22:30] Well they'll sell tons of premiums. Thousands of premiums. They'll make a pro that will sell

[22:37] and they will do is this. They'll pull on the ACDC and they will make character specific special

[22:44] edition runs at the end of the run. Something like a Boba Fed edition. Something like a Vader edition.

[22:53] And then that one will become even more like desirable and limited and that'll be what happens.

[23:00] And I think for the first time ever because of the themes power, Star Wars could be the first

[23:06] pinball machine where people buy multiple versions of the game. I know it sounds crazy but if they

[23:12] make like a Vader edition and a Boba Fed and a light side or dark side I could see the ultimate

[23:18] Star Wars fan wanting to have one of each because remember these are the guys that also do collect

[23:23] all the different variations of the toys and the figures and every little variation is what they

[23:28] love and we'll see how it pans out. Now I will segue now and that's my talk about ACDC and whether

[23:36] it's going to be rerun. The Walking Dead, I don't know if it's going to be rerun with comic book

[23:40] art. Yes it seems to make sense because it was based on the comic book and I think it would be

[23:45] cool because a lot of what's in the show doesn't really come through in the game itself in terms of

[23:50] the dots and the call outs so why not go comic book. But here's the deal. I'm not that excited

[23:55] about these turn remakes with these vault editions because I'm so much more excited about the future

[24:00] pins coming from Stern and I really do think the LCD error stuff just blows away the DMD stuff so

[24:07] keep buying your old machines guys because I'm excited about what the future holds. So let's talk

[24:12] about Star Wars because I talked about collectibility and let's talk about the fact that Stern is

[24:16] continuing to deny any presence at the Star Wars fan convention and they were up there as an

[24:23] exhibitor and it was pulled down. So we don't know whether or not it was pulled down because Stern is

[24:30] not going to actually go. We don't know if it was pulled down because Jody's trying to surprise us.

[24:37] This wouldn't be the first time that Stern has tried to just deny what the next game is. They do

[24:42] it all the time. They did it with Game of Thrones. Remember Stern like all Stern's marketing people

[24:47] were like Game of Thrones is not the next title. It's not next. It's not coming up and then boom HBO

[24:53] video with Game of Thrones announcement. So they do it before. They did remember when Stern went to

[24:58] the Slayer concert and was holding up Stern signs. Again just trying to throw people off the

[25:04] Erasmith scent. I think it's kind of silly. I really do. I don't know why they do it. Every secret

[25:10] they have is never a secret. Everything always leaks. Nothing is really that much of a surprise.

[25:16] We've heard about everything. They're too big of an organization to keep these leaks under wraps.

[25:22] I think it would be smart for Stern to be there. I think there are so many Star Wars fans.

[25:28] I think May 4th would be the perfect day to reveal the actual game with the teaser happening

[25:32] at the fan convention. Look we just have to wait till next week. We're going to know one way or

[25:37] another. I know Stern is trying to pump Erasmith sales. Going out with Star Wars too early will

[25:44] definitely hurt Erasmith sales. Which is a good segue to Erasmith. I'm just going down a list of

[25:51] news. I'm actually jumping around because I realize this stuff segues better like this.

[25:56] Erasmith is out. All three models are shipping I believe. People are unboxing them and the

[26:03] unanimous feedback is it's really fun that this title which everyone had an adversion to because

[26:13] they don't really like Erasmith enough to buy a pinball machine has now proven to be

[26:20] one heck of a fun pinball machine. I'm hearing nothing but positive responses from owners.

[26:27] I'm hearing nothing but positive responses from people playing on location. I've said it.

[26:32] It was my pick of the show. Remember all the games I saw at TPS. I said my pick of the show

[26:37] is Erasmith Pro. I think Bang for the Buck. Nothing gives you everything like it does.

[26:44] Artwork, LCD, code, shots, toys, great sound. It's got the total package for $5200. Show

[26:53] me something else that is delivering on that for that price. Also it's something that's universal.

[27:02] People can jump on an Erasmith pin and they recognize the songs and they'll have a good time.

[27:07] It's exciting. This is what I love. The title that nobody really had high expectations for

[27:14] I think Erasmith could go down as the most fun machine of 2017 for Stern. Part of me is

[27:22] worried I do think Star Wars might underwhelm. I really do. I'm really concerned about the expectations

[27:29] and height for Star Wars and what it will ultimately deliver. I think it's going to be underwhelming.

[27:34] The most underwhelming pinball machine of the year, the machine that I think is just a flop.

[27:42] It is Batman 66. As much as I wanted it to be this exciting pin that had the perfect theme to

[27:51] sort of base itself off of, we hear it time and time again. If you put Batman 66 next to Erasmith,

[27:58] it is not even close which machine is more fun, which machine has better shots, which machine

[28:04] is further along, which machine has the better art package. The only thing Batman has going for it

[28:09] is better theme. It has a better theme, but as a pinball experience, it's not even close.

[28:16] It's not even close. It's really a shame. It's really a shame that Lyman, the best coder they have,

[28:22] is stuck, coding a machine that I just don't think he's going to be able to transform it into what

[28:31] people expect because the shots aren't there. The game is just not there. It's such a shame

[28:39] that you don't have Lyman, your best coder in your entire organization in the history of

[28:46] Stern Pinball. Hands down, Lyman comes to the top of the coder list and he's not working on

[28:51] Star Wars. How do you not have your best coder working on Star Wars? He's sort of like,

[28:56] I feel like he's wasting away on Batman, a game that people have already forgotten about

[29:02] because the gameplay isn't there. I've talked to many Batman owners and behind the scenes,

[29:08] these guys aren't really that happy. They're not that happy. It was the title that everyone rushed.

[29:14] Remember, they sold out of this title before anyone saw anything. I think Erasmith is proving

[29:21] that Bore can make one hell of fun pin and that when you give people something that's just

[29:28] newer and we all heard, it's just kiss-rescind. If that were the case, I don't think you'd be hearing

[29:35] the kinds of applause and accolades you are for Erasmith. Yes, there are similarities and there are

[29:40] also similarities in the code. But like I said, it's everything people want it kiss to be, but better.

[29:45] And so it feels new because I think people move past kiss pretty quickly. So I want to say,

[29:50] I think it's great and an eighth-is-thiel to me like fuck you to Batman S.L.E. owner. So Stern has put

[29:59] mirrored back glass, real glass, in Erasmith, L.E. and it looks phenomenal. So they're hearing your

[30:06] feedback guys. Every time something like this bubbles to the surface where people are complaining,

[30:12] you know, I can't believe Stern is removing glass from the trans lights, especially on the L.E.s.

[30:18] for all the money we're spending, they're taking out the things that really made pinball special.

[30:21] And what did Stern do? This company that always gets chastised for not caring and not listening,

[30:27] they put mirrored back glass into Erasmith, L.E. and it looks incredible. It looks incredible. Now,

[30:34] the $15,000 Batman S.L.E buyers, how do they feel right now? They don't get that. So if you ask me,

[30:42] Stern should print 80 mirrored back glasses and send them to all the Batman S.L.E. owners.

[30:50] They also should send all the Batman S.L.E. owners a free glass of the new Stern non-reflective glass.

[31:00] They should do both of those things. They should do both of those things because they know

[31:06] that they made so much money off of those buyers with the S.L.E. and they didn't put in all the goodies

[31:14] they knew were coming. They knew they were going to do glass for Erasmith, they had to.

[31:19] They knew they had the glass coming, they had to. And I think Batman S.L.E. is going to go down in

[31:25] history, just Batman in general. As one of the greatest pinball themes that was sort of rushed to

[31:30] market to hit this anniversary date, and I think they made a mistake with the risk of it. And that's

[31:37] where they're at with it. I think Batman is going to go down to that game that like, eh, you know,

[31:42] it's fun enough. It's pinball, right? All pinball will be fun. But I definitely think Batman

[31:48] will go down as a game that was sort of half baked and it was like a partspin game that was made.

[31:56] And if you had started making a Batman 66 game from the ground up and George Gomez was designing

[32:01] it from the ground up, I think it would have looked completely different. So what else is going on

[32:06] in the world? So I have tried to get Yop and Barry on the show. I've corresponded with them and

[32:13] they finally got back to me and said, you know, Chris, we're just not going to do the show. We're not

[32:18] going to do any podcast. But we will, and I said, look, that's cool. I get it. I did try and convince

[32:24] them. I said, look, you know, Barry, I think the podcast is a better format for you to talk and explain

[32:30] what's going on because your tonality and your, you know, your voice is what people want to hear

[32:37] versus just something that you write in an email or in a pinside post. You're also going to get

[32:43] nuked on pinside unless the news is good. If the news is good, it doesn't matter. It doesn't

[32:49] matter where they deliver. They could, you know, they could deliver via pigeon mail and people would

[32:53] still be happy that the news is good. So what we do know is that they are meeting with ARA tomorrow.

[32:59] Thursday, Dutch Pimbal and ARA are sitting down. It is the first time they will sit down after

[33:06] Renee, the project manager over there, the director, the managing director was fired from ARA who

[33:12] was in charge of the Lebowski project. Whether or not he was fired because of this is unclear.

[33:19] There is nothing we can do but speculate. I will say this. I hope they get their shit together.

[33:26] So that idiot on eBay can take down his $50,000 big Lebowski for sale. I think it's a joke.

[33:33] But go look, it's the most expensive pin up there right now, even more than Magic Girl.

[33:38] I also, I hope they get their shit together because I really want people to get their machines.

[33:42] When you listen to my interview with Greg, you know, rare hero, he's in on one and these people who

[33:48] support this company for multiple years, they deserve to get what they paid for. They relied to

[33:54] and there's a lot that Dutch needs to do to regain credibility. One of those things they need to do

[34:00] is show they're able to work something out with ARA because let's be honest people. The whole

[34:04] future of their company depends on this meeting and whether or not they can ink out a deal.

[34:09] If it goes to the court systems, if it goes to lawsuits, if they're not able to come to a middle ground,

[34:16] this whole company will collapse. They're never going to be able to just sue ARA and find a new

[34:22] manufacturer after ARA like developed all the parts and it is the people who know how to make it.

[34:29] So really, really critical time for Dutch. Canada wishes them the best of luck. I hope they work

[34:36] it all out. I want to see Big Lebowski out there and in more homes and I think people deserve it.

[34:43] And I think you guys all agree. I think Dutch was on to something and they showed quite clearly

[34:49] how difficult it really is to deliver a quality pinball machine at scale in a timely manner.

[34:57] You know, it's a good segue to Alien Pinball which I'm glad we got to talk to Brad

[35:05] and to Blake. I hope you guys enjoyed that. I get criticized a lot for always being anti-highway

[35:11] and anti-alien and you know, Andrew Highways never happy with me. So and I told him like, look man,

[35:17] I'm fair. Everything I say about a highway pinball is fair. Everything that I've said about them

[35:23] has been supported by facts or very reliable sources and I've given Andrew every ability to come

[35:30] on this show or send me an email to clarify any mistakes I've made. Do you know how many emails

[35:36] I've gotten from Andrew Highway clarifying a mistake I made or something I said that wasn't true?

[35:42] None. Okay. I know he listens to this podcast. I know he listens to it. So I just wanted to say that

[35:49] talking to Brad and talking to Blake was a great time. They are extremely excited for the machine

[35:56] and I think the feedback we heard from them has all alien buyers really excited and happy to hear

[36:02] that the gameplay experience is what they were hoping for. It's got a great light show. It's really

[36:07] immersive. It pulls you into that alien world and you don't spend your whole time missing

[36:13] Sigourney Weaver. So it does pay homage to Alien in the proper way according to these two guys.

[36:22] Right. You could be like what do these two guys know? And look there's always that honeymoon period.

[36:26] I think Brad pulled a little bit of a fast one to get his alien ahead of the line. That's

[36:32] that's something that I don't even want to go into but you guys can you guys know that that's

[36:37] how it works with distributors that they have their own inventory and it's up to them to decide

[36:42] who gets their early inventory. But we've seen it time and time again. People always cut the line.

[36:48] They always cut the line and that is why it is I think it's silly to ever give money pay and

[36:54] fold like two years in advance and you're still waiting and someone didn't even wait two months

[37:00] and they have a machine. So it sucks. It sucks. I would be mad too if I fire one of you guys. So

[37:07] what does this mean now for Alien? I think at this point it has to be pencils down. When I heard

[37:13] Brad talk about how Andrew is like we should could do this we could add this we could add that.

[37:18] He needs to stop. He needs to stop. I feel like Andrew highway would add a microwave oven to the

[37:23] pinball machine if people told them they also want to warm up their fucking bagel bites while they play.

[37:27] He needs to stop thinking that everything needs to be tweaked and and and add it. He's at the point

[37:33] now where the shit needs to ship. Right it's just that simple pencils down. He needs to get the

[37:40] shit on the line and out to people because it's great that the game's getting good reviews. What's

[37:47] not great is we still haven't seen the Ellie artwork that Ellie buyers don't know what they're

[37:52] getting. Here's a little thing that I want to just you know I want to discuss because I saw Bill

[37:58] Brand is posted this in the Alien thread and people just like to smith it. You know where is

[38:04] highway when it comes to production? Are they financially able to get this game on the line?

[38:09] How can you not ask that question and the one thing I'll say is this we heard from Andrew

[38:17] that the Ellie's would be going out 100 Ellie's would go out in January at the beginning of January.

[38:23] Okay so the Ellie buyers back in like November when they were first promised a game were willing

[38:30] to accept that date and I know he hasn't given any dates since which was my recommendation.

[38:35] I got him to stop saying two weeks on everything right and he stopped for the most part which is good

[38:41] which is good but he is now telling people that Ellie's will ship in June and July. June and July

[38:50] so what does that mean? That's six to seven months past past when he said it would ship in January

[38:58] so isn't it that's the thing like it's it's really how are you how are people not nervous

[39:04] when so many months keep going by and still nothing and still nothing and still nothing and still

[39:10] nothing. Are you telling me that the Ellie and Ellie artwork has taken six months to get approval

[39:17] when all they're using is the assets that were given to them by Fox and it just goes to show

[39:24] I I don't know what to say anymore about this I've said it all I think they need to get the game

[39:30] on the line I think the Fox approval is being used as a stall tactic and I think Ellie and Ellie

[39:37] owners are going to be waiting a long time I also I think that Andrew has waited too long I think he

[39:45] needs this game to sell and I don't think he can afford for people to ask ask for any more refunds

[39:51] from his company and I think he's missed the mark badly and the reason why I think he's missed

[39:58] the mark badly and he's got to be panicking about not getting inundated with refunds is I don't

[40:05] care what people say you know whether you love alien you know when you got alien tatted on your

[40:10] body when attacked from Mars remix starts shipping at 6500 and Stern starts shipping Star Wars and

[40:18] announced a Star Wars see one Star Wars gets announced and people see it Andrew's going to get hit

[40:24] with a lot of refund requests and if Stern Star Wars ships in June like I'm hearing it will

[40:31] and he's beating out alien that's just crazy to me that Star Wars may beat out alien right that

[40:38] magic girl beat out alien it's just crazy but I think his timing couldn't be worse and you know

[40:44] what else is coming out dialed in so at the end of the day this spring summer is going to be the

[40:53] most competitive sort of four to six months this four month stretch is going to be the most

[41:00] competitive marketplace that pinball has seen in years and Andrew highway if he would have got

[41:08] alien out earlier he would have had so many orders coming in and he would have been fine I still

[41:16] don't get why he made full throttle first and he's and it still just seems like he can't get the

[41:22] revenue necessary to hit go on the line if he's waiting on parts and boards that's one thing

[41:30] and that may be the case but again you know we heard there were like a Chinese New Year delay

[41:36] and new boards would be coming in two weeks we heard that in December people it's now April

[41:43] so December January February March April like it's five months since we heard those boards were

[41:50] going to be be arriving in two weeks so these are just the facts these are the facts do with it what

[41:57] you may all right what else am I missing I want to end with spooky pinball some news from spooky is

[42:04] that Alice Cooper will be revealed in August so that is good news we now know the date in which we

[42:13] can expect to see Alice Cooper what I like about spooky amongst all the other things is

[42:20] they give you the date you're going to get to see the game I like that in August we'll show you

[42:25] Alice Cooper okay what does that mean that means you can stop fucking speculating you can stop

[42:31] worrying about it you can stop having it like beyond your mind like wondering when you're going to

[42:37] see it you know when you're going to see it and I like that because it's just like okay cool all

[42:41] way to August and I can enjoy the rest of what's going on in pinball we can we can enjoy what they're

[42:46] doing with like the Rob Zombie final production and we can just we can just not worry about it

[42:51] and we know that spooky come August will show us Alice Cooper they this company doesn't pull

[43:00] like oh no it's not ready you know be ready in two weeks oh no in two weeks it'll be ready in two

[43:04] weeks you know they're not like that and and I love that they do it and I also love that they have

[43:10] uh rz rob zombie number 300 that is going on the auction block I believe it's this Saturday

[43:17] at mgc the is at the Midwest gaming classic I think that's right um but they're auctioning

[43:23] it off for a really great cause uh they're auctioning it off I believe it's for uh I want to say

[43:30] is it a children's hospital or diabetes foundation uh and one of the gentlemen uploaded a picture

[43:37] I believe it's his nephew who suffers from diabetes at a young age or one of his cousins I think it's

[43:42] nephew and love that love that about spooky I love that they do these special games for a really good

[43:49] cause I think they raised I want to say $15,000 or $16,000 maybe $14,000 for the America's most

[43:56] honoured that they raised for that they donated uh the money to charity for or the money over the

[44:01] machine went to charity um but again once again congratulations I think the machine looks freaking

[44:06] cool I love the armor I love the rz 300 that's everywhere on it uh I think spooky you know

[44:13] that to me that's that's a collectible that that's a one off one of one version of something that

[44:20] if you're gonna go in go in on that uh because no one else will have that ever again and I think

[44:25] it's really really a great that charlie and and and the family are doing that and we look forward

[44:30] to out scooper I think it's going to be a big title for spooky I need to be a big title and we

[44:35] all have high expectations but they know that they're not they're not stupid they don't they don't

[44:41] they don't really feel that like the jetsons and and dominoes is is what they're capable of and you

[44:46] know they they know they're capable of much more and I and I think they're they're hard at work

[44:51] uh to deliver on that um that's it uh this little sort of Wednesday morning bubble 4 a.m.

[44:58] pinside news dump on you guys but hope you enjoyed it uh look forward to airing the rare hero

[45:05] interview for you guys next uh and then I look forward to talking to jj from from game exchange I

[45:10] think jj is one of the most admirable and amazing guys he's he's one of the greatest distributors

[45:16] out there total stand up class act I can't say nice good stuff about him and um I want to hear

[45:24] from a distributor like him because I think as a distributor right now it's it's a really interesting

[45:28] time with all that's going on and and I think his insights into where pinball is headed and and where

[45:35] the market is is going to be really great to hear because he knows it firsthand uh what the

[45:41] demand is for pinball and and where people are you know where people's money's going and where he

[45:46] thinks it's going to go and and and and even stuff like how hard it is to snag some of these like

[45:51] elite versions of star wars I want you know we want to pick his brain and see you know where he's at

[45:56] so that's it enjoy your day ladies and gentlemen go get a british bulldog they are amazing
