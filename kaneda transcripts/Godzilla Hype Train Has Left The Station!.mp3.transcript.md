[00:00] I might have been wrong on Willy Wonka.

[00:03] I might have got you excited for Mandalorian and you should have been excited for Mandalorian.

[00:08] How do you not put Mandalorian magic under the glass?

[00:11] But I told you Guns and Roses was going to be epic and I'm here to tell you right now

[00:15] I am thanking my show on this fact.

[00:19] Godzilla Pinball from Stern Ellie is going to stop into the Pinball world tomorrow and

[00:25] it is going to take all of your money out of all of your wallets.

[00:29] This is the game.

[00:31] We've been saying for years we want to see a world under glass.

[00:35] We want to see a world under glass that's three dimensional.

[00:38] A world under glass that has movement has things to shoot when you look down at it.

[00:43] You just marvel at that little three dimensional world that you can't wait to shoot and I was

[00:49] talking to Keith Thalwin last night.

[00:51] That's not true.

[00:52] I don't know if you can say that but if I were talking to Keith Thalwin last night I

[00:55] tell you he would say to me, can you tell me this is the one?

[00:59] This is the one in which Stern Pinball gave me more.

[01:02] This is the game that is going to show people what Stern Pinball can do and I have some

[01:06] details for you.

[01:07] This game is going to be an all original Godzilla adventure much like Jurassic Park and you're

[01:13] not going to see like one movie from Godzilla from back in the day.

[01:17] You're going to go on an all new adventure and it's pretty much like Godzilla battling

[01:21] monsters saving Tokyo, destroying Tokyo.

[01:24] It's not like Godzilla's some storyline that you have to stay true to.

[01:27] It's kind of like the same story over and over again and there is going to be CGI graphics

[01:33] that are great just like in Jurassic Park and there's going to be movement.

[01:38] There is a big wow mechanism in the game.

[01:41] The reason why the reason why at first I didn't think it was in the game is the person

[01:47] who I talked to was looking at a static version of the play field.

[01:52] But when you see the video of the game in motion that is where you see stuff move.

[01:57] I think the buildings are going to move.

[01:59] I think things are going to fall down.

[02:01] I think it's going to open up new pathways for the ball to go and I think we're going

[02:05] to see this game and we're going to see Zambi Yeti's greatest art package to date.

[02:10] I heard the Ellie art package is his best art package to date and people are going to

[02:16] be fighting and kicking and screaming to get their hands on an Ellie and you have to look

[02:22] no further than the stupid auction prices this weekend to realize the greatest bargain

[02:28] in the pinball world right now is a Stern Ellie machine and why wouldn't you buy an

[02:34] Ellie of Godzilla and I'm here to tell you that the Ellie's played better than the premiums.

[02:39] Don't fool yourself in Ellie machine absolutely plays better than the premium because when

[02:44] you're playing the Ellie in your head you're like I'm a boss I'm the boss man I'm the

[02:48] big guy I'm the big shot with the Ellie those premium guys they wish they were me and

[02:52] that's true everybody feels that way deep down inside I'm sorry you premium guys you know

[02:58] it you know it's true and everybody knows frozen for hose Godzilla Ellie sold out already

[03:03] are you ready is the hype train leaving the station can it just drop that chew chew get
