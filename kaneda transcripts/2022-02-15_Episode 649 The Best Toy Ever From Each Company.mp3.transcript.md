[00:00] Do you believe in magic?

[00:02] In a young girl's heart, have a music and freedom.

[00:06] Whenever it starts and it's magic, if the music is proving, it makes you feel happy like an old-time movie.

[00:14] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:18] Ah, welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:21] I'm your host, Kaneda, for you new club members.

[00:23] Welcome.

[00:24] We're at 391.

[00:26] Everyone said nobody would join the Kaneda Club.

[00:28] Here we are.

[00:29] The only show that gets right to it.

[00:30] So we're going to talk about some pinball news.

[00:33] And then I want to do something a little different.

[00:36] I want to go down each manufacturer, all new manufacturers, and I want to say what I think is the best toy they've ever made.

[00:45] The best toy.

[00:46] And there can only be one winner for each manufacturer.

[00:50] Okay, so best toy because you know me.

[00:53] I think for this much money and these games are a world under glass,

[00:58] that toys are so important in pinball.

[01:00] What's the point of making a pinball machine if you can't engineer spectacular toys that make people go, wow, when they play the machine?

[01:10] But before we do that, let's talk about the news.

[01:12] What's going on in pinball?

[01:14] All right, so Stern Pinball, any news?

[01:16] Well, if you're a rush buyer and you bought a rush machine early on, know that your scoop protector is defective and Stern is working on a fix.

[01:26] The ball's going to get stuck.

[01:27] If you're operating a rush pinball on location, you can't really operate it because you're going to have to remove the glass all day long because that scoop protector bends and then it stops the ball from going into the scoop.

[01:40] Now, Stern is saying they have a fix coming for the LE.

[01:44] We shall see.

[01:45] We shall see.

[01:46] This is another example of how Stern Pinball doesn't really test these games very much before they send them out to customers.

[01:55] How do they not test this?

[01:57] How do they not spend a few months with the scoops on rush, making sure that either the playfields didn't wear or they needed scoop protectors?

[02:05] But it seems like the scoop protectors were a last minute addition.

[02:10] And for the life of me, I cannot understand why Stern Pinball or Jersey Jack or one of them doesn't just buy Cliffy.

[02:18] Just buy the company and give Cliffy a whitewood of all of your machines and have him have the scoop protectors ready to go for every single new machine made.

[02:29] It's so mind boggling to me that Cliffy is like still a separate entity that none of these big companies have like purchased as like an exclusive thing that will be part of their game.

[02:39] All right, some other news in the Stern Pinball world heard this from Craig Bobby over at TPN.

[02:44] So in the Mandalorian code, there is an option to send out video footage via an HDMI cable that is reverse footage.

[02:54] So the rumor is if you have a Mandalorian, there is going to be something additive to the game that will most likely create like a hologram image.

[03:04] Now, if you remember the show, the puck in the show, the hologram puck was one of the coolest parts of the show.

[03:11] It was like what the bounty hunters received to know who they were going after.

[03:15] Now, do we think this will be part of the Mandalorian topper, a hologram topper or I thought the topper was going to be the droid robot?

[03:25] Will it be both?

[03:26] Here's what I'm speculating.

[03:28] I think Stern is going to add that puck to the game somewhere.

[03:31] Maybe it's going to be a little screen you put on the apron of the game.

[03:35] And then the topper is going to be the droid that spins around and fires and shoots.

[03:41] Now, maybe it's all up there on the topper itself.

[03:44] So the topper might have a hologram and the droid that seems like a little overkill.

[03:49] And maybe that makes sense to put the puck next to the droid because remember, the droid is also a bounty hunter.

[03:55] So is that how they're going to implement it?

[03:58] But the word on the street is we're going to see this Mandalorian topper any day now.

[04:02] Now, I also think Stern might make this topper limited.

[04:05] And I believe that this topper could be anywhere from a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars.

[04:11] I really wouldn't be surprised if Stern pinball charges fifteen hundred dollars for this topper.

[04:16] I mean, they're seeing the way the use game toppers are going now.

[04:18] And if they limit this thing to, let's say, just a thousand of them, they could probably charge two thousand dollars for a Mandalorian topper,

[04:27] knowing that every single Ellie buyer is going to want one and then you've got all the premium and pro buyers.

[04:33] It's really kind of crazy.

[04:35] I mean, these secondhand prices are showing these pinball companies.

[04:38] We're not even near the ceiling on anything.

[04:41] And I just think we're going to see companies charging more and more and more.

[04:44] All right, so Mandalorian topper coming soon.

[04:47] So the next question becomes like, when are we going to see Venom?

[04:50] Are we going to see it by TPF?

[04:52] I don't think so.

[04:53] I think we're going to see Venom sometime in April, May.

[04:56] I think Stern pinball is just so backlogged that they're going to have to slow down the new releases a little bit.

[05:02] They just have to.

[05:03] They just have so many orders with distributors that they can't keep doing it this way.

[05:08] They don't want to have thousands and thousands and thousands of back orders.

[05:12] And then customers are going to have to wait like a year to get their game.

[05:15] So what else is going on in the pinball world?

[05:17] Cactus Canyon remake is now shipping.

[05:20] It's official.

[05:21] Games are going into boxes and Cactus Canyon Essies are going out to customers.

[05:27] I've seen it in a box.

[05:29] I've seen the unboxing happening.

[05:31] More people are going to be getting their games.

[05:33] I'm hearing tomorrow.

[05:34] So this is good news.

[05:36] If you ordered this game way back at pinball expo in October, you've been waiting for the paint to dry.

[05:42] You've been waiting for a CGC to get this game out the door.

[05:45] And this is good news.

[05:46] I really want Cactus Canyon to get out there and for all of you in on it to get your games.

[05:51] I still think if you ordered in LE, you're going to be waiting a lot longer.

[05:57] I heard the LE delay is longer because of something with the metal parts for the train in it.

[06:02] It's a different metal than the SE and the SE Plus.

[06:06] So you might be waiting to early summer, late spring for your LE of the game.

[06:12] Now, the other thing I'm being told, and I was handed this information,

[06:16] I'm being told by CGC that Lyman Sheets has completed the code that he was working on with Cactus Canyon remake.

[06:25] So if you're in on a Cactus Canyon remake, that's music to your ears that this will be the last game that Lyman ever worked on.

[06:32] And a lot of his work will find its way into your game.

[06:36] But here's the thing.

[06:37] I mean, is he done?

[06:38] Is he not?

[06:39] We'll never really know.

[06:40] Like, how could you tell if everything he ever wanted into this game is in this game?

[06:46] Lyman Sheets was a guy who was never finished with code.

[06:49] So like, you know what I'm saying?

[06:50] Like, Lyman never had a finish line.

[06:52] He would always be tweaking his games and working on them and adding stuff to them years down the road.

[06:58] So for them to say like, Lyman completed everything he was going to do for Cactus Canyon,

[07:04] I would take that with a grain of salt.

[07:06] I think they want people to know that.

[07:09] And if we know CGC, I just don't quite trust them when they say stuff like this.

[07:15] Because we also heard from Josh Sharp that he's going to continue to be working on the game.

[07:21] Why would Josh Sharp have to do anything if Lyman Sheets was done with the game?

[07:25] As far as I'm concerned, when Lyman says a game is done, it's done.

[07:28] Like, I don't know.

[07:29] Josh doesn't have experience making games better than Lyman Sheets.

[07:33] So I think this is a little bit of marketing spin by CGC.

[07:37] I do.

[07:37] I think they just want people to feel like this is everything that they were planning.

[07:42] And you'll never be able to know.

[07:43] You just won't.

[07:44] So it is good news that we are going to get some of Lyman's touch on this game.

[07:49] Now, the question becomes, how much did he add to the game?

[07:52] And how much money are they going to charge for this updated code?

[07:57] Remember, it's not part of the game.

[07:58] You have to pay extra money.

[08:00] What do you think it's going to cost?

[08:02] 200 bucks?

[08:03] 500 bucks?

[08:04] A thousand dollars?

[08:06] What do you charge now that this is Lyman's last coded game?

[08:10] Going to be really interesting.

[08:12] Now, we know CGC and Doug over there.

[08:14] He's not out to fleece the pinball community.

[08:16] So I think you're going to see the code update be more around like 250 to 300 bucks.

[08:21] I don't think it's going to be like a thousand dollars.

[08:24] Stern would charge you like 15 thousand dollars and you'd probably pay Stern the money for that.

[08:29] All right.

[08:30] Still no pictures from Haggis Pinball.

[08:32] No fathoms on the line just yet.

[08:35] I've seen some emails that Damien has sent consumers.

[08:38] He is telling them very soon and we will be patient.

[08:42] I'm not in on this game.

[08:44] I hope you guys get your games and I want to clarify my stance once again.

[08:49] I do think they will get you your fathoms.

[08:53] I don't think they will make any money on these games.

[08:56] I think it is a pride play and I don't think there's much profit to have after this delay.

[09:03] And I'm just going to leave it at that.

[09:05] And they know the truth.

[09:06] I don't.

[09:07] They're looking at their balance sheet.

[09:08] I'm not.

[09:09] But there is no way you can go nine months delayed on the production of this game.

[09:14] And still make money on it.

[09:16] How can you do that?

[09:16] How can you do that?

[09:17] All right.

[09:18] Any news over at Spooky Pinball?

[09:20] More Ultramans and Halloween's are going out the door.

[09:24] Here's the one question I have.

[09:25] They said they were going to fix the hedge multi-baw issue on the Halloween games.

[09:31] Right.

[09:31] The insert.

[09:31] It's all miscut.

[09:33] It doesn't fill the hedge multi-baw.

[09:35] It only says hedge multi-baw.

[09:38] Now they were telling customers they were going to fix this issue.

[09:42] I know this because certain customers like gave up their spot online and moved further

[09:47] back in the line so that their game would have the fix.

[09:51] But games are being unboxed as of last week still do not have the correction.

[09:57] So I would just like an official statement from Spooky Pinball.

[10:02] Are you fixing the problem and on what game can we expect to see the fix?

[10:07] If you're not going to fix it fine, but I think for buyers of this game, it's still

[10:12] a little bit of a head scratcher that nobody caught that thing early on.

[10:16] Still no news from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:19] There is just nothing to report.

[10:21] I think all signs point to Toy Story being around the corner with the new Buzz

[10:26] Lightyear movie coming out.

[10:27] It makes absolute total sense that this would happen, that they would time the

[10:33] Toy Story pinball machine with the enormous hype that will happen when Buzz

[10:38] Lightyear movie comes out this spring summer.

[10:40] So I hope, I really hope that they can finally time up a game with a theatrical

[10:47] release for some reason Jersey Jack can never, ever stay on schedule.

[10:51] So we'll see if they can do it and we'll see if it's Toy Story.

[10:54] I know there's a lot of rumors that it might not be Toy Story.

[10:57] I think it's Toy Story.

[10:59] I would be shocked if this game is not Toy Story.

[11:02] The reason why is Pat Lawler is so slow.

[11:07] It takes him forever to work on a game and he was always planning to do Toy Story.

[11:14] So I think, you know, when he had to quickly change it to Wonka, I think there's

[11:19] got to be a few Toy Story mechs that he took out of that Willy Wonka game and that

[11:25] we're going to see put back into his version of Toy Story sometime this spring summer.

[11:30] Ah, you know, I also heard on the pinball show that the new Lord of the Rings TV

[11:34] show could become a new stern machine.

[11:37] I don't think so.

[11:38] I don't think Stern's going to make a Lord of the Rings TV show.

[11:42] The smart thing to do would be to vault the original Lord of the Rings pinball

[11:46] machine, which is one of Stern's best ever, make the art package better,

[11:50] make some of the sculpts better, and you would sell a game at like

[11:55] 20 grand. I mean, if Stern vaulted Lord of the Rings,

[11:58] they could sell it at twenty thousand dollars and make five hundred vault

[12:04] editions or a thousand new ones.

[12:05] If they made a thousand Ellie's only of a new Lord of the Rings,

[12:10] 20 grand every day, take my money now, easy,

[12:13] twenty million dollars in the bank for a remake of a game.

[12:17] There's a reason why I'm hearing Gary Stern is worth like eighty five million

[12:21] dollars, because Stern can so easily make tens of millions of dollars by just

[12:28] remaking stuff.

[12:29] All they have to do is renew the license and maybe polish the artwork and put it

[12:35] on the line, and they're putting tens of millions of dollars in the bank.

[12:40] Zero R&D cost people, zero R&D.

[12:44] They could just stop making any new pinball machines forever and vault ghost

[12:49] busters, Tron, Lord of the Rings.

[12:51] This is Stern's advantage.

[12:53] They can keep going back to the well now with sort of like super limited edition

[12:58] versions of all their games.

[12:59] They could never make a new game again and still make tens of millions of dollars

[13:03] a year, because all of us would be clawing over each other to get the new

[13:07] super limited version of Iron Maiden or Jurassic Park or Tron or Lord of the Rings

[13:12] or Simpsons Pinball Party.

[13:13] You could just go on and on and on.

[13:15] Now, the question is, will they vault a white star game?

[13:19] Right? They've only been remaking spike edition games.

[13:22] And I think it would be worth the trouble to port over Lord of the Rings into the

[13:29] spike system. It can't be that hard.

[13:31] Like seriously, with all of their coders over there, how hard could it be to just

[13:36] take what you did on the white star and put it onto the new platform?

[13:41] It's not impossible, people.

[13:43] It can be done.

[13:44] All right. And the last bit of news is I'm hearing that P3

[13:48] Multimorphic is going to reveal their first licensed game before Texas

[13:55] Pinball Festival. So that means Jerry's going to show the world what he's been

[14:00] working on before March 25th.

[14:04] Now, this, I think, is a little bit of a make or break moment for P3 Multimorphic.

[14:09] They need a licensed theme.

[14:11] They need a licensed theme that people want.

[14:13] All they need is one.

[14:15] If they create a licensed theme that makes you want to own the game,

[14:19] that's the smartest thing they could ever do because if you buy it, OK,

[14:25] if you buy the licensed game, you are then very likely to buy the older kids

[14:30] like Heist and Cosmic Cart Racing and like Lexi Lightspeed.

[14:35] So this is a huge moment for Jerry.

[14:39] He's got Scott Denisi and Boan Karens over there.

[14:42] Now, what theme do you think it is?

[14:44] The rumor that I hope is true because Jerry loves the theme.

[14:48] We know Scott Denisi does is that the licensed game over at P3 Multimorphic

[14:53] is going to be Futurama.

[14:56] Now, that would be a humongous theme for this company to get.

[15:01] Do I think they have it?

[15:03] No, I just don't.

[15:04] I just don't have faith that Jerry is going to line up a huge theme like that.

[15:10] It's very much like a Rick and Morty theme.

[15:12] It's got millions of fans and it would make a lot of people out there say,

[15:16] take my money now, I just can't see him doing it.

[15:19] Every time I hear him talk, he always undersells the importance of a theme.

[15:24] And I'm like, is this the kind of guy that's going to take, you know,

[15:27] six figures plus and invest in a theme that's going to make him seven figures plus?

[15:32] I always feel like Jerry thinks the platform is more important than the theme.

[15:37] So I just can't see him making a huge investment in a theme like this.

[15:42] And I really hope it's not some license like cell phone game,

[15:46] like a Candy Crush or Bejeweled, because if you think about it,

[15:50] the hardest part of making a licensed theme for this platform is you have to fill

[15:54] that big playfield screen with something.

[15:57] And how do you fill that with a licensed theme property?

[16:02] Now, a smart thing to maybe do is I've been saying this,

[16:05] make it look like a static pinball playfield that moves a little bit, right?

[16:10] Like get an artist to draw what looks like a normal pinball,

[16:14] Futurama playfield, and as you're playing,

[16:17] the actual art can like manipulate and transform.

[16:21] So you could have like eight different playfields of Futurama like sort of pop up

[16:26] when you're in a different mode.

[16:28] That would be super cool.

[16:29] So we'll see what he does.

[16:31] We'll see what it is.

[16:32] I hope it's Futurama.

[16:34] I hope Scott Denisi is on this licensed theme.

[16:37] And I hope this game finally makes us say, hey,

[16:40] we should consider buying a P3 multi-morphic.

[16:43] All right, so let's get to my pick for each new manufacturer's best toy they've ever done.

[16:50] And I believe toys are super important in pinball.

[16:53] I think toys make pinball machines special.

[16:56] There's something about the fact that pinball is analog.

[17:00] It's physical.

[17:01] You want to see the ball do something interesting, but not just the ball.

[17:06] You want to see the environment under that glass transform and do things magical

[17:13] that make you go, wow, that create pinball moments that make you want to pull people

[17:18] over and say, look at this thing, I can't wait to show you what this does.

[17:24] I mean, I think that's the greatest way to describe what a great toy does.

[17:29] It makes you want to show it off to everybody and be like, you won't be able

[17:34] to believe your eyes when you see this thing do what it can do.

[17:38] And I will say, for the most part, modern pinball machines and toys have been pretty

[17:45] damn lackluster and I mean it.

[17:48] I am not going to go best toys of the 90s.

[17:51] I'll tell you why.

[17:52] There are so many amazing toys from the 90s, pinball machines,

[17:56] the Balli Williams or even some Daddy East stuff.

[17:59] It would just embarrass what we are getting into pinball machines these days.

[18:04] The medieval madness castle, right?

[18:06] Embarrass is anything we've seen today.

[18:09] You could talk about Rudy from Fun House.

[18:11] Embarrass is pretty much anything we've seen today.

[18:14] Go into like Twilight Zone and look at the toys in that game, the Gumball,

[18:19] the magnetic flip upper play field.

[18:22] You go to Adam's family and the hands.

[18:24] Like, name me one, one modern toy that grabs a ball as cool as the hand does in

[18:32] the Adam's family.

[18:33] And so, you know, there are some decent toys.

[18:35] We're going to talk about them.

[18:37] But for the most part, I don't want to go down the Valley Williams days.

[18:41] I don't want to talk about the whirlpool in whitewater.

[18:43] I don't.

[18:44] They just engineered more magic into those games.

[18:48] I didn't even mention some of the greatest toys ever.

[18:51] The trunk in Theater of Magic, right?

[18:54] The Ringmaster in Circus Voltaire.

[18:56] There's a reason why J-pop is so damn popular.

[18:59] The genie with the disappearing magnet in Toten, right?

[19:02] All these things.

[19:03] There's like, there's more wow in one J-pop game than I think in any of these

[19:09] modern games right now from a mechanical toy standpoint.

[19:13] The wow now is happening mostly with the artwork and it's happening mostly with the code.

[19:18] You know why?

[19:19] Because those are two things that don't require any mechanical engineering.

[19:24] That is too complex and those things never really break, right?

[19:28] They don't break unless the arts chipping off a J-J-P play field.

[19:32] It's a lot easier for stern to sell machines that don't have

[19:37] complex mechanical things in them.

[19:39] Now, that being said, these modern pinball companies have some damn fun toys.

[19:45] They do.

[19:45] It's not like they've just been barren.

[19:47] And I think, you know, when you look at a company like Stern,

[19:49] they put a lot of fun toys into their games.

[19:52] Don't get me wrong.

[19:53] They put a lot of fun stuff in them and I'm going to talk about them.

[19:56] We're going to end with Stern Pinball.

[19:57] I'm going to go from bottom up and talk about the best toys that each modern

[20:02] company has put into their machines.

[20:04] The only company I'm not going to feature here right now is Chicago Gaming Company

[20:09] because they did not engineer any modern toys.

[20:13] They are remaking the Balli Williams toys.

[20:16] So they are not going to be included in my mentions.

[20:19] And I'm going to pick the best toy from each company.

[20:23] And for some of these companies, you're going to see it was really hard to even

[20:26] identify one toy that was very impressive.

[20:29] So let's start with Haggis Pinball.

[20:31] OK, and again, I just want to get this stuff out of the way.

[20:34] So Haggis Pinball, as a company right now, has only made Celts.

[20:39] They also are remaking Fathom.

[20:41] Now, I would say that Celts is a game that doesn't really have a toy.

[20:48] And I want to give you my criteria for how I'm ranking the best toys from each

[20:54] company. Number one, it has a visual wow when you walk up to the pin.

[21:00] So when you see it right from a distance, even before you start playing,

[21:04] the toy jumps out at you and makes you say, wow, I wonder what that does.

[21:10] It pulls you into the game, if you will.

[21:13] The second is, is it aesthetically pleasing and beautifully sculpted?

[21:17] Right. Does the toy itself look amazing?

[21:20] All right, just from a visual standpoint.

[21:22] Number three, it interacts with the ball.

[21:25] And the more ways the merrier, like how many different ways does this toy

[21:30] interact with the ball or with gameplay?

[21:33] Number four, it has movement.

[21:35] Does it have movement?

[21:37] Is it static or actually does it move?

[21:39] Did they just put something in front of it or can you actually bash it?

[21:43] Does it transform in any way? Some do more than others.

[21:46] Some have no movement. Some move a lot.

[21:49] Number five, it does something unexpected that creates a memorable pinball moment.

[21:55] And this might be the most important one.

[21:57] What does this toy do that makes you say, wow, that makes you come back for more?

[22:03] That does something in front of your eyes that you didn't think it would do.

[22:07] So then apply that to Celts and there's nothing in it.

[22:10] Right. There's nothing in it.

[22:11] There's a scoop in front of a sculpted guy, but there's no toy there.

[22:14] There's no toy. There's pop bumpers.

[22:16] There's spinners. There's an LCD under the screen.

[22:19] But Haggis Pinball has yet to engineer a single pinball toy that meets this criteria.

[22:26] So no toys at all in Haggis Pinball.

[22:29] Let's go to Highway and Pinball Brothers.

[22:31] You got full throttle and alien.

[22:33] Easy choice here.

[22:35] The best toy they've ever engineered is the alien head, the xenomorph head that

[22:40] grabs the ball, arguably a bit of a clunky toy, but it does pull you into the game.

[22:46] It does scream alien and it does create movement.

[22:51] It does have a wow moment.

[22:53] The ball is going into the xenomorph's head.

[22:57] The tongue comes out even though it looks like a silver pencil.

[23:00] It's still a very cool toy.

[23:03] Engineering that toy for Andrew Highway was super hard.

[23:06] The thing breaks down a lot, which is kind of good because it shows they actually

[23:10] tried to do something complex, keeping it running as a nightmare.

[23:13] But the alien head is a great toy that the modern pinball world has seen.

[23:18] All right. Now let's go to Dutch Pinball.

[23:20] Now, this is a company that you know me.

[23:22] I love the Big Lebowski.

[23:24] I think the Big Lebowski has many toys and I love games that have more than just

[23:28] one central toy.

[23:30] Now, if you're going to ask me, what's the greatest toy that Dutch Pinball ever put

[23:34] out, and it's a hard one, like the rug is awesome.

[23:37] The upper play field parking lot is awesome.

[23:40] You bash the wall, the car comes out, you bash the car.

[23:43] But without a doubt, probably the coolest toy I've ever seen since covering Pinball.

[23:49] And the thing that makes you when you walk up to the machine, just smile and say,

[23:54] man, they nailed it.

[23:56] They nailed this theme.

[23:57] There maybe is no better lower play field ever than the bowling alley in the Big

[24:02] Lebowski. And this is by far, I think one of the coolest toys ever in Pinball.

[24:07] And definitely the coolest toy Dutch Pinball has ever made.

[24:11] They've also only made one game.

[24:13] So it's not like I could compare and contrast with other stuff, but amazing

[24:17] engineering and the fact that Dutch Pinball engineered this stuff from the ground up.

[24:22] This was like Bally Williams kind of imagination.

[24:25] Just speaks volumes about what's possible in Pinball.

[24:29] And when I see a big company like Stern hasn't really, really, really engineered

[24:35] stuff as cool as that rug or the upper play field or the bowling alley.

[24:39] It just reminds me and it should remind all of you.

[24:43] You're getting what you pay for with Stern machines.

[24:46] They're not putting the engineering complexity into their games.

[24:51] And so stop spending like 19 grand on Stern machines, people.

[24:55] You're getting out of control.

[24:57] All right. P3 multi-morphic.

[24:59] We've got Lexi Lightspeed.

[25:00] We got Cosmic Heart Racing.

[25:03] And then we've got Heist.

[25:04] Now, obviously this was an easy one.

[25:06] The crane in the Heist is a very cool toy.

[25:10] Visually, it's stunning.

[25:12] It moves around the game.

[25:14] It grabs the ball.

[25:15] It's also a bash toy.

[25:17] It does everything.

[25:18] I think the crane, it extends.

[25:20] I mean, the damn crane extends.

[25:23] Right. We don't get the extension in the Batman 66 crane.

[25:26] This thing is an engineering marvel.

[25:29] Jerry should be very proud of himself.

[25:32] And I think for a lot of us out there, we're like, oh, man, like one of the greatest

[25:36] pinball toys in the last like decade and it's trapped inside a P3 game Heist.

[25:41] And everyone's like, oh, man, can you imagine if Stern put that thing into one

[25:44] of their games, we wouldn't stop talking about it.

[25:47] You know, unfortunately, you have to spend

[25:49] ten thousand dollars on a P3 to get it.

[25:51] And hey, hey, Jerry, give us that license theme.

[25:54] And then maybe we'll buy the Heist as an added on addition to the game.

[25:57] All right, let's go to American Pinball next.

[26:00] Now, this is a company, very interesting company when it comes to toys,

[26:04] because AP came out of the gate.

[26:06] I mean, they put a lot into their first two games, Houdini and Oktoberfest.

[26:11] We saw them recycle one of their mechs in Oktoberfest.

[26:15] It was the Houdini stage.

[26:16] Then we got Hot Wheels, which arguably doesn't have any toys.

[26:21] I mean, is that a toy the car spinning around?

[26:23] No, really, really disappointing that a Hot Wheels game, which is based on a kids

[26:30] toy that is filled with stuff that is a wow thing.

[26:34] Loopy Loops, jumps, car washes, everything that's in the Hot Wheels universe.

[26:39] None of it makes its way onto the pinball machine.

[26:42] Very embarrassing, very embarrassing.

[26:45] And then we've got Legends of the Hala, which arguably also really doesn't have any

[26:50] toys. I mean, the magnet under the play field, I don't really consider to be a toy

[26:54] toy. You can't even see it.

[26:56] It doesn't create like an unbelievable wow moment.

[26:59] And then that big Viking ship, right?

[27:01] That Viking ship is like a prime example of something that you wanted to do

[27:07] something cool and it doesn't do anything cool.

[27:10] They couldn't even get the oars to move.

[27:12] Nothing about it makes it a magical toy.

[27:15] And so the easy winner here for American pinball's greatest toy of all time.

[27:20] And still one of the coolest visual wow moments, I think, in modern pinball is the

[27:26] trunk shot in Houdini.

[27:28] If you've never experienced that trunk shot, that milk trunk shot or whatever,

[27:32] it's called milk can trunk shot.

[27:33] It fires the ball like three feet from the lower left side of the game all the way

[27:38] into the trunk in the back of the play field.

[27:41] And it is amazing.

[27:43] It is epic.

[27:44] Unfortunately, the game itself is brutally hard.

[27:49] The shots are too tight.

[27:51] And Houdini is just another one of these games, though, even though it has a lot in

[27:55] it, the overall experience of it is more frustrating than fun because of how tight

[28:00] the shots are. Now, I'm leaving Stern to the end because there are so many

[28:03] stern toys to discuss and I can't talk about everyone.

[28:06] Let's go to spooky pinball next.

[28:09] Now, spooky pinball was an interesting one because as I went down my criteria of

[28:14] is it a visual wow, like, does it interact with the ball?

[28:17] Does it do something unexpected and amazing?

[28:20] Have to be honest.

[28:21] I have to be honest, people.

[28:22] There are hardly anything in spooky games that meet this criteria.

[28:28] I would almost argue that spooky pinball has never really engineered a toy.

[28:35] I don't think they have like a complete mechanism that was engineered to do any

[28:40] of the things that I've been describing.

[28:42] They'll find unique ways to have upper play fields and drop targets and pop bumpers,

[28:48] but they've never really engineered a toy.

[28:51] And I mean that America's most haunted like the ghost.

[28:55] Maybe that's a toy.

[28:56] You bash that it's got the magnet in front.

[28:59] Rob Zombie literally has nothing like nothing.

[29:02] It's usually just targets in front of scopes.

[29:04] Like spooky will put scopes all over the game, but the scopes don't do anything.

[29:10] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle.

[29:12] You could argue maybe the guillotine, you know, maybe the Frankenstein that pops up.

[29:16] I think it's a Frankenstein or a werewolf.

[29:18] You got T and A has like no toys.

[29:21] It's got the drop targets that lock the balls.

[29:23] It's got the pop bumper on the side.

[29:25] Rick and Morty, another game, not really a game with a toy.

[29:30] I don't consider going into the garage a toy.

[29:32] That's not a toy.

[29:33] It's a hole that goes into a subway that then kicks it out of a scoop.

[29:37] That's not a toy.

[29:39] The horseshoe lock, not really a toy.

[29:41] You could argue it's a toy again.

[29:43] But based on my definition, a toy in Rick and Morty would have been like if they

[29:48] actually engineered Rick and Morty's spaceship where like it opens up and you

[29:53] lock the balls inside it, then it releases the balls.

[29:57] Or if you went through a portal and it sort of came out in multiple locations

[30:01] around the play field, because the other part,

[30:03] when you think about the portal traveling in Rick and Morty,

[30:06] it's always going from the same place A to B every single time.

[30:10] It also gets kind of boring.

[30:12] It doesn't really have the wow.

[30:13] I would argue that the best toy in Rick and Morty, which isn't even a toy,

[30:18] is putting the pop bumper as the slingshot, which I think creates the most wow

[30:23] moment in that game.

[30:24] Then you get to Halloween in Ultraman.

[30:26] And I mean this when I say this, I'm looking over Halloween in Ultraman trying

[30:30] to find the toy that creates the wow.

[30:34] And there isn't any.

[30:36] Like do you consider like the hedges on the left side to be a toy?

[30:40] There's nothing that you really bash other than like drop targets.

[30:44] It's a game with no toys.

[30:46] And again, there's a lot in it, but they're not a company that is really ever

[30:51] engineered a toy.

[30:53] And that is why, you know, again, I'm just going to say it,

[30:56] these games shouldn't be eighty seven hundred dollars, nine thousand,

[30:59] ten thousand dollars.

[31:00] Like you're spending money on almost hardly any engineering.

[31:05] All this stuff, people, is off the shelf parts with very little engineering.

[31:11] And you're spending so much money on them.

[31:14] It's crazy to me when you think a Godzilla premium is the same price as a

[31:18] Halloween and look at the difference of what's in it from a mechanical engineering

[31:23] standpoint. And so if I had a picture.

[31:26] Take one as Spooky Pinball's best toy to date, that when you walk up to it,

[31:31] you're like, wow, I wonder what happens there.

[31:33] I would give it to the castle in Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle,

[31:37] because I do consider that whole castle area to sort of be like a toy.

[31:42] It's nowhere near like the medieval madness castle,

[31:44] but it just has a lot going on.

[31:47] And I'll consider that a toy.

[31:48] I got to give him something because again, as I said,

[31:50] I just don't think they've ever engineered a toy.

[31:53] Now, our next company, we know they've tried really hard to engineer

[31:57] Baldy Williams kinds of moments and toys in their games.

[32:01] And that's Jersey Jack Pinball.

[32:03] You know, this is another one where you're like, at first glance,

[32:06] you might be like, oh, Jersey Jack loads their games with memorable toys, right?

[32:11] And then you sort of start to be like, wait a minute,

[32:14] try to pinpoint ones that do magical stuff, that have done stuff you've never

[32:20] seen before or make you pull people over and say, you've got to see this, do this.

[32:25] Jersey Jack Pinball came out of the gate with a lot of toys in Wizard of Oz.

[32:29] I mean, there's a lot of stuff happening in Wizard of Oz that interacts with the ball.

[32:34] That has movement that makes you say, wow, look at that.

[32:38] They've got the witch that comes up who's got the magnet in front of her.

[32:41] That's like a bash toy.

[32:43] They've got the spinning house in the upper right play field.

[32:46] They had the flying monkey that carried the ball up to the upper play field.

[32:50] They've got the doors that open up in the upper left play field.

[32:53] There's a lot of toys in this game.

[32:56] You could even argue maybe the pop bumpers with the trees and the eyes are all toys.

[33:00] It's got the crystal ball.

[33:02] It's got a lot of stuff going on in this game that I would consider to be toys.

[33:07] And yet Wizard of Oz is not going to win for best toy by Jersey Jack Pinball.

[33:11] You've got the hobbit, right?

[33:13] Smog was supposed to be the one that blew everybody away, but it's just a talking sock puppet.

[33:18] You don't bash it.

[33:19] You don't hit it.

[33:20] It doesn't interact with the ball at all.

[33:22] After that, you know, the trolls that pop up in Hobbit are not that amazing.

[33:27] And so Hobbit is kind of like a miss.

[33:29] And then you go to dialed in, right?

[33:31] This game that's supposed to be loaded with Pat Lawler toys.

[33:34] And arguably there's a lot in it, but none of it is that incredible.

[33:39] You got the quantum theater.

[33:40] You've got the drones with the magnet there.

[33:43] You've got the diverter woman in the back with the wrench.

[33:46] You've got all this stuff happening in dialed in.

[33:48] You've got the subway lock, but none of it is like, oh, my God, I can't wait to see what that does.

[33:54] I would say the quantum theater is the coolest thing in the game.

[33:58] But it's also just a little underwhelming after you play it for a while.

[34:03] And then you've got Pirates of the Caribbean, right?

[34:06] With the pirate ship in the upper right corner that seesaws back and forth like it's on the ocean.

[34:12] We're going to talk more about this one because as you can tell,

[34:15] this is going to take it.

[34:16] It's going to go to Pirates of the Caribbean ship before we crown it.

[34:20] Willy Wonka, another one, right?

[34:22] Willy Wonka, think about it.

[34:23] What's the best toy in Willy Wonka that makes you go, wow, I can't wait to see what that does.

[34:28] It doesn't really have one.

[34:29] Wonka vision was a missed opportunity.

[34:32] Nothing really cool happens on Wonka vision.

[34:34] The gobstopper sort of mystery machine thing.

[34:37] I don't know. It's just kind of like after a while, it's kind of clunky shooting into that thing.

[34:41] It's not that magical.

[34:43] There's nothing.

[34:44] And that's what kills me about Willy Wonka.

[34:46] It's a game where the code is super fun, but physically nothing happens on that playfield.

[34:52] That is that magical.

[34:55] And guns and roses is just like 15,000 lights.

[34:58] Like there's absolutely nothing from a mechanical standpoint that makes you go, wow, and G&R.

[35:03] The lights do make you go, wow.

[35:05] And as I've said, G&R, the mech is the machine.

[35:08] The toy is the whole machine because it's a concert in a box, but Pirates of the Caribbean.

[35:13] Is the greatest Jersey Jack toy ever engineered.

[35:17] It's incredible going up there.

[35:19] You've got two flippers.

[35:21] You've got targets.

[35:21] You've got a spinner.

[35:22] It's also got a cannon shot that cannon shoots it over to the other ship on the other side of the playfield.

[35:29] But when you walk up to Pirates for the first time, that thing grabbed people like it was like nothing you'd ever seen before.

[35:37] And I hope we see more of that.

[35:39] I really do.

[35:40] I hope we see more engineering like that.

[35:43] On Jersey Jack games in the future.

[35:45] All right, Stern pinballs best toy ever, ever.

[35:50] Now, the hard part about doing this with Stern is they have so many damn games and I can't even like really go through them all.

[35:57] I'm going to have to tell you like my favorites and then just tell you the one that I think is the best one they've ever done.

[36:03] And let's remind you, it's something that visually wows you when you walk up to the machine.

[36:07] It's aesthetically beautiful.

[36:09] It interacts with the ball.

[36:11] It has movement and it does something that creates a magical and memorable pinball moment.

[36:16] Let's go down a bunch of Stern machines that don't have it.

[36:18] Mandalorian doesn't have it.

[36:20] Doesn't have it.

[36:21] I don't care what we put on top.

[36:22] It doesn't got that.

[36:23] Stranger things, you know, I don't know, right?

[36:26] Is the screen in the projector a toy?

[36:28] Probably.

[36:28] I would consider it a toy.

[36:30] Is it a wow thing?

[36:31] You can't wait to see what happens on it.

[36:33] Yeah, maybe the UV kit is cool.

[36:36] But still, nothing in Stranger Things really is that singular toy.

[36:41] That just blows you away and interacts with the ball the right way.

[36:45] Avengers doesn't have it.

[36:46] It's got a lot of cool shots.

[36:48] It's got a lot of wire forms.

[36:49] Star Trek.

[36:50] Nope.

[36:51] Simpsons Pinball Party.

[36:52] The garage is cool.

[36:53] That goes up to the upper play field.

[36:55] Lots of cool stuff in the Simpsons Pinball Party.

[36:58] But, you know, I would say that it doesn't have sort of that toy that's amazingly interactive.

[37:04] That just makes you say, oh my God, look at that.

[37:07] Led Zeppelin, I just want to punch myself in the face,

[37:09] has probably the worst toy Stern has ever made.

[37:12] I mean it.

[37:12] I think the spinner that comes out of the play field is the laziest and worst toy Stern has ever done.

[37:18] Every time I see it, it's like watching Stonehenge come down in Spinal Tap.

[37:22] Oh, I love the Tron rotating disc behind the three drop target bank.

[37:26] Guardians of the Galaxy is Groot cool enough.

[37:29] I don't know.

[37:30] Groot, like it's fun to bash Groot, you know, you bash him, his mouth opens up.

[37:34] Lots of cool stuff there.

[37:36] I think it's a solid toy Groot.

[37:37] I really do.

[37:38] It's just not Stern's best.

[37:39] In The Walking Dead, you've got the prison, you've got the well walker.

[37:43] The prison never made much sense to me.

[37:44] You like open up the doors and there's a big zombie head inside.

[37:48] The scale was all wrong and that made no sense.

[37:50] Why is there this ginormous zombie head inside this prison?

[37:54] X-Men's got some cool toys.

[37:56] Magneto multi-ball is super cool.

[37:58] Avengers, you know, the Hulk smash is really cool.

[38:01] We haven't seen anything like that.

[38:03] I mean, look what they did with Herman Munster and the Munster.

[38:05] It's like, how lazy is that?

[38:07] Just put a magnet in front of him.

[38:09] He's not really a bash toy.

[38:10] Not that much fun.

[38:12] Rush pinball, nothing really like a recycled toy, but nothing else.

[38:16] That's really that incredible.

[38:18] Let me get to like some of the best ones I think Stern is done.

[38:20] I think Aerosmith, the toy box is incredible.

[38:24] Like the fact that it shoots the ball across the play field and the box opens up

[38:29] and then the box unloads balls for multi-ball.

[38:32] Super incredible toy, but it's not the best.

[38:35] ACDC, a game loaded with toys.

[38:38] You've got the cannon.

[38:39] You've got the bell.

[38:40] I love those toys.

[38:41] I really do.

[38:43] When you walk up to ACDC, you see the train, you see the cannon, you see the bell.

[38:47] The bell I love because you walk up to it and you want to hit it.

[38:51] You want to see what happens when you hit the ACDC bell.

[38:54] Very cool.

[38:55] And remember, Stern let Richie put a lot into ACDC because they wanted to show

[39:03] JJP what they could do.

[39:05] Very cool game with a lot of toys, but not the best.

[39:09] The crane in Batman 66 and Batman the Dark Knight is amazingly cool.

[39:14] It is one of Stern's best mechanisms ever.

[39:16] It's super rewarding to hit it as it sweeps across the play field.

[39:20] I love the fact that visually you're drawn to it when you start a game.

[39:25] I love the fact that it interacts with the ball in such a unique way.

[39:29] The only thing with this toy is it's never really been in a great game.

[39:32] And Batman 66, it doesn't make any sense that it's in Batman 66, but I still do

[39:37] think it's one of the best engineered toys Stern has ever done.

[39:40] Stewie Pinball, right?

[39:42] I mean, this upper play field miniature pinball machine, super cool.

[39:45] I would argue it's Stern's best upper play field ever.

[39:48] I love this thing.

[39:49] I think it's super fun.

[39:51] When you walk up to Family Guy, it pops right out at you and you can't wait to

[39:56] sort of activate it, right?

[39:57] It really does have that like magical moment when you're playing miniature

[40:01] pinball up there.

[40:02] It's a far more enjoyable experience than the lower play field on the

[40:06] Munsters, but it's still not Stern's best.

[40:09] Black Knight sort of rage, right?

[40:11] When this came out, when we saw the Black Knight mech, we were all just like,

[40:14] Stern can finally engineer a mechanism when we were all starting to go crazy.

[40:19] Like this is the greatest thing ever.

[40:20] Truth is, it's not that complex and there's nothing else in the game, right?

[40:24] It's like they gave us that one toy in the game and then the rest of the Black

[40:28] Knight game is completely empty.

[40:30] The upper play field is terrible in that game.

[40:33] And so while it's neat and I like that there's stuff happening on each side

[40:37] of the toy that are doing different things like the shield going up and down

[40:41] and the flail spinning, it's still not the best toy per se.

[40:47] I do like it.

[40:48] I do think it's great, but Stern has done better.

[40:51] Let's talk about the other pirate ship in Stern's Pirates of the Caribbean.

[40:55] Now this is a super cool toy.

[40:57] Now it's like it's sailing along and then you destroy it and it collapses.

[41:02] And you know, people hold this up as one of Stern's greatest toys of all time.

[41:07] And it is, it feels like something where they actually had to engineer

[41:11] something very creative.

[41:13] It is super neat.

[41:14] Now, the reason why I am not going to pick this one as the best is simply this.

[41:19] It kind of looks cheap.

[41:21] Like it's this flat plastic looking thing.

[41:23] It looks really wonky.

[41:25] Thinking about it next to Jersey Jack's machine now too.

[41:28] It has an aged as well because that game has an aged well.

[41:32] It looks really, really cheap.

[41:35] All right, here's one where a lot of people think this is one of the best.

[41:37] And that's Star Wars hyperdrive, right?

[41:39] The huge hyperdrive in the Star Wars machine.

[41:42] Now, I will say this, when you walk up to Star Wars, the pinball machine

[41:46] and you see that hyperdrive sort of going around the entire pinball machine,

[41:50] it really does have a wow.

[41:52] Like you walk up to it, you're like, oh, my God,

[41:54] I can't wait to see what this does.

[41:56] I can't wait to, you know, get balls into this thing and have them spin around

[42:00] and and feel that energy.

[42:02] The problem is this, you could play this machine dozens of times

[42:06] as a casual pinball player and you'll never experience it.

[42:10] You'll never see it happen to get balls going into the hyperdrive.

[42:15] The shot to get there is way too clunky.

[42:18] I think it's a frustrating toy.

[42:19] I really do.

[42:21] And also because this is Star Wars people,

[42:24] the fact that Stern made the hyperdrive, the main toy in a theme like Star Wars

[42:30] and didn't give us anything like ad at walkers and lightsabers don't light up.

[42:35] And there's like nothing else in this game.

[42:37] There's a tie fighter on a spring.

[42:39] Now, just looking at this toy, it's super cool.

[42:42] But again, I just don't think you experience it enough as a player.

[42:46] And that is why this thing cannot win.

[42:49] I've got the top four Stern toys of all time.

[42:52] I'm going to go through them right now.

[42:54] Number four is Sparky in Metallica.

[42:56] I love the hammer.

[42:57] The disappearing magnet hammer is also super cool where it comes

[43:00] smashing down and the ball disappears.

[43:03] But Sparky is just such a fun bash toy.

[43:06] I think Sparky is Stern's best bash toy of all time.

[43:10] When you keep hitting Sparky and then he freezes the ball and then you get to that

[43:13] Sparky multi ball, it is such a great pinball moment.

[43:17] It is such a fun toy.

[43:18] And when you walk up to Metallica, right, that big Sparky in the electric chair,

[43:23] it pulls you into the game.

[43:25] The sculpt is gorgeous.

[43:26] There's been a lot of modders that make additional sculpts for it, but it's

[43:29] such an identifiable toy in a game that has all of the wow elements that you

[43:36] look for in a toy in pinball.

[43:38] All right.

[43:38] After Sparky, we get to the building in Godzilla.

[43:42] This thing that just came out wowed everybody.

[43:46] I mean, it goes up, it locks balls, it changes the pathway of the ball.

[43:51] It's like there's nothing this building can't do.

[43:54] It's super amazing.

[43:56] It's super intricate.

[43:57] When they lift the play field, what went into this mech?

[44:00] It delivers.

[44:01] It delivers.

[44:02] I love this mech.

[44:03] I think it's great.

[44:04] I think it's super fun.

[44:06] The only area it falls down a little bit, it's a little plasticky looking.

[44:10] It doesn't really have the detail of like a building.

[44:12] It feels very flat.

[44:14] I'm not sure if modders can help with that.

[44:16] And also this, it's like Godzilla pinball.

[44:19] And the greatest toy in Godzilla is not even Godzilla.

[44:24] It's not Mothra flapping its wings.

[44:26] It's a building that goes up and down.

[44:28] I would have loved it if when the building went up and down, Godzilla actually

[44:33] breathed fire at it and breathe fire at that bridge.

[44:36] And he moved the left and right and he caused the destruction of these things.

[44:40] He doesn't move at all.

[44:42] He doesn't move at all.

[44:43] I can't believe they made a Godzilla pin where Godzilla doesn't do anything.

[44:47] All right, number two on my list is the T-Rex in Jurassic Park.

[44:51] And if you get the Leor sculpt for it, it's even better because he makes it look

[44:55] just like the movie one, but you've got a T-Rex, a big T-Rex head in the back

[45:00] of this stern machine that tracks the ball.

[45:03] The ball goes into its mouth.

[45:05] It spits the ball out.

[45:07] It roars at you.

[45:08] This is everything a toy should be.

[45:11] A toy should bring the theme to life.

[45:14] It should have movement.

[45:15] It should make you walk up to the machine and be like, wow, like put you in a place

[45:20] of suspended disbelief that, wow, like look at what this machine is doing and look

[45:24] how much fun it is.

[45:25] And I love the T-Rex in Jurassic Park so much for that reason.

[45:30] Now, number one on my list might be a little controversial that I put this as

[45:34] the number one coolest toy stern has ever made.

[45:38] Because I think what makes this toy so cool is that it perfectly brings the theme

[45:44] to life is not only that it visually when you walk up to this machine,

[45:48] this thing visually just pops out at you and is the perfect translation of the

[45:55] theme in gameplay itself.

[45:58] This thing just does something that's pure magic that makes you say, wow,

[46:03] oh my God.

[46:04] And then within a pinball moment of the game,

[46:08] it absolutely serves as the ultimate toy during the ultimate moment in the pinball

[46:14] machine. And you might guess what it is.

[46:16] I think the greatest toy stern has ever made is the ring in the Lord of the Rings.

[46:22] This thing is incredible.

[46:25] It's surrounded by magnets.

[46:28] It causes the ball to be suspended in midair.

[46:31] We talk about levitating ball.

[46:33] It is levitating in midair.

[46:36] And then perhaps the coolest thing ever is it fires the ball behind it and loops

[46:42] back around into gameplay.

[46:43] But that's not only it.

[46:45] The best part about this toy and if you've played this game,

[46:48] if you haven't, you have to experience this is when you get through all of the

[46:52] modes in the game and the music is going and you get to destroy the ring.

[46:57] And then this is like the greatest use of a toy ever.

[47:01] You shoot the ball up the ramp and the ring freezes the ball in the middle of the

[47:06] ring and then you get another ball.

[47:08] And the way you destroy the ring is you have to fire that ball up the ramp and

[47:13] knock that ball through the ring to throw the ring into the fires of Mordor.

[47:18] And then the whole machine goes haywire when you do that.

[47:21] It is possibly the greatest moment in all of pinball.

[47:25] I'm going to do another show and maybe I just gave away the number one moment.

[47:29] But I want to do another show that talks about the greatest moments in pinball,

[47:33] not just toys, but that toy by stern is incredible.

[47:38] And you couple that with the ball rock that swings out.

[47:41] And that's like maybe the greatest one, two toy punch in the history of stern

[47:45] is when ball rock swings out and blocks your pathway up the ramp so you can't

[47:51] cross like it's so good.

[47:53] I know the ball times are long,

[47:55] but there's a reason why Lord of the Rings saved stern pinball because they

[48:01] engineered one of the coolest toys ever.

[48:04] I haven't seen anything this cool since that in stern pinball.

[48:08] I hope you enjoyed me speaking positively about things I love in pinball machines.

[48:13] I know there hasn't been news.

[48:15] I know it's easy for me to get negative about Haggis and Spooky,

[48:18] but I just want there to be more exciting toys like this.

[48:21] And I think we have to give stern credit.

[48:23] Like when I went down this list,

[48:25] they put a lot of really fun stuff into pinball machines.

[48:28] We haven't seen that from companies like AP.

[48:31] We haven't seen it from Spooky.

[48:33] We haven't even seen that many from Jersey Jack.

[48:35] So stern pinball for all the dings they get,

[48:38] they also have put in some of the most fun toys in pinball.

[48:43] They have. And I think everyone else needs to wake up a little bit because I'm not

[48:47] spending 10 grand on a spooky machine in which I can't even say what one toy is.

[48:53] And the same is true with like Legends of Ahala and the same is true of Fathom.

[48:57] I don't want to spend 10 grand and walk away from a pinball machine and be like,

[49:02] well, there's not really a toy in it.

[49:04] So then what am I spending money on?

[49:06] You're just giving me switches, artwork and code.

[49:09] No, put toys into these machines, everybody.

[49:13] Everyone have a great day.

[49:14] We'll talk to you soon.
