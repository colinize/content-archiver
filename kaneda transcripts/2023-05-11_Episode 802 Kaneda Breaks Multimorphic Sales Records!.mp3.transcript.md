[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcaster that is smashing

[00:20] multi-morphics record.

[00:22] We're gonna talk about that, we're gonna talk about this Dutch pinball tour that we just

[00:26] saw.

[00:27] Barry, thank you for doing that.

[00:29] We're gonna talk about spooky pinball with some new like LED board driver.

[00:34] But let's start out with Canada's Pinball Podcast smashing multi-morphics sales record.

[00:41] Yes, did everybody see the news?

[00:43] Jerry put out an announcement that freaking final resistance from Scott Denisi has broken

[00:50] the sales record set by multi-morphics previous release Weird Al.

[00:56] Now there's just one question I have for Jerry.

[01:00] If you broke your sales record, what was the sales record?

[01:05] Let me tell you people, this is such spin and such weirdness.

[01:10] If I told you Canada just broke the record for doing a long jump, right?

[01:15] I just broke the record for long jump.

[01:18] Isn't the first question you would have, what was the long jump record, Jerry?

[01:24] So how many Weird Al's did you sell?

[01:27] How many final resistance games have you sold?

[01:32] It is so crazy to me.

[01:34] And this podcast has a new mission and you can tell ladies and gentlemen, look at what

[01:37] I'm doing for pinball with this boutique pinball challenge.

[01:41] I am bringing a new level of transparency to this hobby.

[01:46] That is a positive thing.

[01:48] We are asking companies that take our money to open up the door and show us what they

[01:52] have going on.

[01:54] And so when I read this story on Naps Arcade about how Jerry and Multi-Morphic are breaking

[01:59] their sales records, I have one simple question.

[02:03] What's the record, Jerry?

[02:05] Why are you talking in riddles like this?

[02:07] I think we have more subscribers to Canada's Pinball Podcast than Jerry has sold of P3

[02:15] Multi-Morphic games.

[02:17] I have 615 subscribers.

[02:20] So I have smashed his record.

[02:23] I have more people who are listening to this show than he has sold pinball machines in

[02:28] 10 years.

[02:29] And I'm not trying to be a jerk.

[02:31] I'm really not.

[02:32] I'm just trying to get these companies to be more transparent.

[02:36] So if you're going to say you broke a record, then tell us what record you broke with real

[02:42] data and tell us what the new data is in which you broke the record.

[02:48] It's like Bozo the Clown Marketing trying to take credit for this stuff.

[02:52] He's patting himself on the back but then won't reveal any real numbers.

[02:57] And the real numbers I want to see are this.

[02:59] Jerry, how many games a week can you make?

[03:04] Just tell us that.

[03:05] I have the same question for Damian over at Haggis.

[03:08] I have the same question for Freakin' Pinball Adventures.

[03:12] Anyone who's making pinball machines, how many can you make a week?

[03:17] We just got a great tour of Dutch Pinball.

[03:19] Barry opened up the door.

[03:21] In his office, he has a sign that says, I love Canada.

[03:25] And I love Barry for doing this tour.

[03:27] He walked us through the entire factory.

[03:30] He showed us everyone there making the machines.

[03:32] He showed us all of the parts.

[03:34] He showed us the process by which they make the big Lebowski.

[03:39] The factory is so clean you could eat off the floor.

[03:42] The games look incredible.

[03:44] This is the greatest way to connect a pinball company to a customer.

[03:49] You know you want the game.

[03:51] What's the other thing you know you want?

[03:52] You want to know when you're going to get your game.

[03:55] You want to know if these companies are legitimately making games.

[03:58] You want to keep them honest when they tell you what the timeline is.

[04:02] So when Barry was asked, how many games a week can you make?

[04:06] He didn't say, well, we broke our own manufacturing record with how many games we're making this

[04:11] week and then say nothing else.

[04:14] He said we can make 10 games a week.

[04:17] We make 40 games a month.

[04:19] Okay, now that's how it should be.

[04:22] Now we know how many they can make a week.

[04:25] Now we know how many they can make a year.

[04:28] Now you know if you order a game, how long it's going to take to get your game and guess

[04:33] what?

[04:34] Knowing puts you at peace.

[04:37] Knowing something like that allows you to relax a little bit, to not wonder, to not be

[04:43] in a mysterious state of when am I going to get my game that I'm being asked to pay for

[04:47] right now.

[04:48] You don't know that at Haggis Pinball.

[04:51] You don't know that at CGC with your Pulp Fiction.

[04:54] You don't know that at most of these pinball companies.

[04:56] Do you know how many games Jersey Jack Pinball makes a week?

[04:59] It's still a mystery.

[05:00] They've been around for how long and we still don't know this.

[05:04] I am going to bring a new level of transparency to this hobby and look what's happening.

[05:10] The companies that are actually opening the door and going live, I mean not some stage

[05:15] production video, but they're going live to their factory.

[05:18] Look how good they're looking and all the companies that are going to avoid doing this,

[05:24] they're going to look bad and they're going to hang themselves with their silence, with

[05:29] their inability to hit one button on a phone.

[05:32] Everybody has a phone.

[05:34] Everybody's got Facebook in this hobby and all you got to do is hit live, walk around

[05:40] and show us what's really happening at your company.

[05:43] I still challenge Jerry to do that.

[05:46] I'm still challenging Marty and Damien to do that.

[05:49] I'm challenging Andrew over at Pinball Adventures to do that.

[05:53] Stern Pinball does it every Friday.

[05:54] Their factory Friday tour.

[05:56] Nobody's wondering if Stern Pinball is making games.

[05:58] They do nothing but make games.

[06:00] They always make games.

[06:02] There could be a world war going on and Stern Pinball would get out there four to six hundred

[06:06] games a week like nothing stops Stern's production line.

[06:10] Nothing.

[06:11] COVID barely dented their production.

[06:13] They just had so much demand through COVID.

[06:15] But for everybody else, it's a new era in Pinball.

[06:19] As games are costing this much money, we need to see more.

[06:22] And here's the thing.

[06:23] If we had asked this question years ago, if we had asked to open up the door to Zidware,

[06:29] John Papadook would not have been able to do what he did because you would have opened

[06:33] the door to Zidware and saw that clown doing nothing every day, just twiddling with Zambietti's

[06:38] artwork.

[06:39] He had nothing going on.

[06:40] He didn't know how to make a game.

[06:42] He was just making things light up, sit in a chair by himself and cry himself to sleep.

[06:47] That was John Papadook's factory.

[06:49] If you open up the door to Kevin Coolick's factory when he said, I'm going to make predator,

[06:53] right?

[06:54] And then you had all these people vouching for him.

[06:56] Oh, he's got the license.

[06:58] Send him your money.

[06:59] So you open up the door to Kevin Coolick's factory, right?

[07:02] Skit B Pinball.

[07:03] And he's making his games in his mom's basement, in his mom's kitchen.

[07:07] He was like building a game in a trailer park it looked like.

[07:11] And would you have sent him your money if we were doing this Boutique Canada challenge?

[07:16] No freaking way.

[07:18] The same is true with Andrew Highway.

[07:20] I mean, almost every single day, Andrew Highway's factory was not running.

[07:24] He would make fake stage production videos that he would put up on Alien Day.

[07:29] But every other day, everything he was doing was smoke in mirrors.

[07:33] And so I know people want to say I'm toxic and I'm negative and I'm unkind for asking

[07:38] these companies to be held accountable, right?

[07:41] You're a pinball manufacturing company.

[07:43] Somebody asked to see your manufacturing.

[07:45] Should that scare you?

[07:47] Is that a negative thing?

[07:48] Hey, we have a hamburger joint.

[07:50] Okay, can I see how you make your hamburgers?

[07:52] Nope, not going to do it.

[07:53] Okay, weird, right?

[07:54] Very weird.

[07:55] You would not trust a hamburger company that wanted you to buy a $10 hamburger if you

[08:00] couldn't actually see they had a stove, they have the patties, they have the buns.

[08:05] You need to see stuff.

[08:06] That's why most burger joints let you see into the kitchen.

[08:10] And if they were to say, no, you're not allowed to see it, but you got to prepay for your

[08:13] burger, you would be skeptical of a $10 item.

[08:17] And yet for many of you out there, you're spending $10,000 and you're not asking to see

[08:23] behind the door at Haggis Pinball.

[08:25] Think about how inane that is.

[08:28] Think about how ridiculous that is.

[08:30] Think about how Canada has just introduced something that is changing pinball culture

[08:36] forever.

[08:37] It is.

[08:38] Now, everyone's going to want to see these factory tours whenever a new game is released

[08:42] by these companies.

[08:44] They want to see this stuff.

[08:45] This stuff makes these companies look good.

[08:48] And I think it's a great thing we're doing.

[08:50] And I love the fact that all of the pinball media that are covering these tours, nobody

[08:56] is saying the origin of all of these tours was the Canada Pinball Boutique Challenge.

[09:02] I did good for pinball.

[09:04] I just wish they would give me credit when I actually do something that is bringing a

[09:08] lot of positivity into the pinball space, but I don't do it for them.

[09:13] I'm still the number one pinball podcaster in the world for a reason.

[09:16] And this is why, because I'm just on your side as consumers.

[09:21] If we were even to comically call this pinball journalism or media, that is the responsibility

[09:27] of the media to be looking out for the consumer, not for the companies, not for the distributors,

[09:33] not for each and every one of you.

[09:35] And I happily wear that badge every single day.

[09:39] All right, so Spooky Pinball has said they have a new driver board for their LED lights.

[09:45] This driver board is better.

[09:47] And look, it's three screws.

[09:48] I watched the video.

[09:50] It's like a three minute video.

[09:52] This is the easiest thing to replace in your game.

[09:55] I think it's great that they caught an issue.

[09:57] I think it's great that they're passing this on to everybody who has an existing Scooby

[10:01] Doe.

[10:02] I think they're around like 350 or 400 have been made so far.

[10:06] So this is going to be an easy fix for everyone who has one.

[10:09] The other thing I was thinking about this week, right, I reported that Steve Richie's

[10:13] next game is going to be the Matrix.

[10:15] That's the big rumor.

[10:16] Now I also hear that like Dutch Pinball has been rumored to be in the mix for getting the

[10:21] Matrix license, but I am hearing from a very good source that this is Steve Richie's next

[10:26] game.

[10:27] And I might be wrong, right?

[10:28] It's just a rumor.

[10:29] I'm not saying I have confirmation.

[10:30] I haven't seen it, right?

[10:31] I haven't seen like this picture of a Matrix game with Jersey Jack logos all over it, but

[10:36] I do know this.

[10:38] Nobody has come out and said I'm wrong.

[10:40] Now normally when I'm wrong on something like this, somebody will come out of the woodworks

[10:46] and say, Canade is reporting.

[10:48] It's Steve Richie the Matrix and he's incorrect and he's an idiot.

[10:51] And why would we listen to him?

[10:53] I love it.

[10:54] Every single time I do these big rumors, this is a big one because Jersey Jack Pinball does

[10:58] not want you to think that the Matrix is next because if you feel like the Matrix is

[11:03] next, you're not going to want to buy Godfather.

[11:05] And speaking of Godfather, Godfather prices are really starting to sink on the LEDs.

[11:10] And I'm starting to see the LEDs now be already around $10,500 and they're not moving.

[11:16] So again, if you just waited, you would have got a game for much cheaper.

[11:20] Derek, I'm sorry, my friend, he just bought one new in box for $12,000.

[11:24] I don't understand.

[11:25] Like all these games are new.

[11:27] Why would you want to buy one for $12,000 when you can have it for $10,500?

[11:32] You could take that $1,500 and buy your wife amazing meals.

[11:37] Now maybe you do that already, Derek.

[11:39] Why would anyone want to spend more money for the cardboard box?

[11:42] It makes absolutely no sense.

[11:44] And this is just the beginning of Godfather prices going down.

[11:48] I'm looking at a Guns N' Roses LE right now with a pinwoofer in it and mint condition.

[11:53] LE of GNR, $8,600.

[11:56] I mean, this is the thing now.

[11:59] This is crazy.

[12:00] Like these Jersey Jack LEs are losing $4,000 almost in value.

[12:05] We know we're going to see Godfather's CEs once they make these.

[12:08] I mean, they haven't made any of them yet.

[12:11] Once people start unboxing the CE of Godfather, what direction do you think that price is

[12:15] going to go in?

[12:16] It's going to go south.

[12:17] It's going to go south.

[12:18] People will get it for like $13,000.

[12:20] You could have saved $2,000, have the same exact game.

[12:24] And then when the matrix comes out, the games are going to plummet in value.

[12:28] This is why in this pinball climate, you need a hit or your customers are just going to

[12:33] take a bath.

[12:34] There's no middle ground anymore.

[12:36] You need a hit theme.

[12:37] People want.

[12:38] You need to execute it right.

[12:40] It needs to have a fan base that wants it.

[12:43] And if you get it right, you'll be fine.

[12:44] Like your sales will be great.

[12:46] The games will hold value and everyone wins.

[12:49] But if you pick a mediocre theme and you don't execute it perfectly, if it doesn't really

[12:54] innovate or bring anything new and special to pinball and it just starts to immediately

[12:59] lose value, lose interest, lose hype, lose excitement, then what?

[13:04] Then what with those games?

[13:06] And you're not going to be able to make those games for eight months and keep your line going.

[13:10] And that's why you've got to make sure you get it right.

[13:12] I don't think Jersey Jack got it right with Toy Story.

[13:14] I don't think they got it right with Godfather.

[13:16] I think American pinball is in big trouble with Galactic Tank Force people.

[13:21] Games still not sold out.

[13:23] They're not making that many LEs.

[13:24] They're not sold out.

[13:25] And now David Ficks is going against his own word.

[13:28] If you go back and listen to his interviews, what did he say?

[13:31] We're going to make the LE and the signature edition games first.

[13:35] He's not doing that.

[13:37] He's sending out deluxe editions of the game.

[13:40] Why is he doing that?

[13:41] Has anyone even gotten a tank version of this game?

[13:44] Does anyone know how many they're going to make a week?

[13:46] There's no denying the fact that Galactic Tank Force shoots alright.

[13:50] It's an alright shooter.

[13:51] There's not much to shoot at.

[13:52] It doesn't have tons of mechs.

[13:54] But it's not a theme anybody really wanted.

[13:56] It also shows that marketing really matters in pinball.

[14:00] Their marketing video was so bad, it turned off everybody.

[14:03] Look at Bud Light, for example.

[14:04] You know, they're one of my brands.

[14:06] Bud Light over 20 years did all of this successful marketing and they erased it all in one move.

[14:12] And obviously, you know, there's not as much at stake in the pinball industry.

[14:16] But if you don't launch your game properly and your game needed a great launch because

[14:20] it came out in a crowded time, how are you ever going to get hype back for the game?

[14:26] How?

[14:27] What are they going to do?

[14:28] They're going to wheel it around shows and get a handful of orders and that's it.

[14:31] There are probably only 20 at most Galactic Tank Force games in the world.

[14:37] And you're not going to buy this game because of what you see on a stream now or on the

[14:40] internet because you've seen it and you don't want it because you know if you just wait,

[14:45] not only are the prices going to go down, but if you just wait a few more months, we're

[14:49] going to see Venom.

[14:51] We might see the Matrix.

[14:53] We're going to see Indiana Jones from John Borg.

[14:56] We're going to see Jaws.

[14:57] We're possibly going to see Back to the Future with Keith Elwin as a Kappao title.

[15:02] We're going to see Pulp Fiction make its way out.

[15:04] And other stuff is coming people.

[15:06] This is not the end.

[15:07] We're most likely going to see a remake of Twilight Zone.

[15:11] There is going to be so much happening in pinball.

[15:13] But right now, right now in this moment, mid-May, right now, doesn't it feel like there's nothing

[15:18] really happening?

[15:19] Foo Fighters are making their way out there.

[15:21] We're excited about the game.

[15:23] It's a great game.

[15:24] But Foo Fighters has had its moment.

[15:26] It's excited people.

[15:28] But now, you know, we're a little bit of a fickle bunch.

[15:30] We always want to have the new high, right?

[15:32] The highs worn off on Foo Fighters are high as worn off on Pulp Fiction because none of

[15:37] them are being made until like Mr. Pinball Australia said Q4 now.

[15:42] No one knows when this game is being made.

[15:44] There's no high around Galactic Tank Force right now.

[15:47] And then what?

[15:48] Right?

[15:49] Godfather doesn't have a frenzy going on.

[15:51] No one really cares that much.

[15:53] So even though so many games were revealed, I'm noticing a vibe in pinball right now

[15:58] where everyone's just like, uh, I think we're all waiting for something major.

[16:02] You know, and seeing that Dutch pinball factory tour, big Lebowski man, guns and roses, Jurassic

[16:09] Park, Ghostbusters, Batman, like we want to get back to a moment in which a game comes

[16:15] out and the theme is just triple A and the code is amazing and there's some magical mix.

[16:21] I'm not saying the games I just mentioned all have that, but at these prices, this is

[16:26] the sense I'm getting.

[16:28] Everyone's just like, all right, all right, this is how the game is now.

[16:31] The game's very expensive.

[16:33] When I buy a game, I've got to make sure I really want it.

[16:36] I got to make sure I want to kind of bolt it to the floor because we're no longer in

[16:40] this cute little hobby where like a pro is $5,000 and an L.E. is $7,500.

[16:46] An L.E. is now $13,000.

[16:49] A Jersey Jack C.E. is now $15,000.

[16:54] The days are gone in which it's just this cute little hobby.

[16:58] Now it's crazy, right?

[17:00] The prices are nuts.

[17:01] People are starting to slow down.

[17:03] People want more for their money.

[17:05] It's a good thing.

[17:06] People want to see inside these companies doors.

[17:08] It's a good thing.

[17:09] People want to vote for Canadian Pinball Podcasts in the Twipees to win the seventh

[17:13] award.

[17:14] It's a good thing.

[17:15] People have told us that $5 a month is as much as they want to spend on a Pinball podcast

[17:19] for the most part.

[17:20] That's a good thing.

[17:22] There's so much transparency happening now.

[17:24] We know what the Pinball game is.

[17:26] We know what the marketplace looks like.

[17:28] There's a lot of games for sale.

[17:30] A lot of people are trying to cash out on these COVID prices.

[17:34] Things are not nearly moving as fast as they were a year ago.

[17:37] It's all a really good thing because the more we pause and the more we demand more, the more

[17:44] we say we're not going to spend this much unless you put real magic into these games,

[17:50] the more they're going to have to deliver that or they will go out of business.

[17:55] I'm going to say something that's not very popular.

[17:57] If you're not bringing something special to Pinball, don't get into it.

[18:01] I don't care if a Pinball company goes out of business.

[18:04] I actually think it's a good thing.

[18:06] If a few of these Pinball companies go out of business, you know why?

[18:10] Because it's going to light a fire under the asses of everybody else.

[18:15] We need to get it right because if we get it wrong, there are real consequences.

[18:21] AIMTRON is not going to save us.

[18:23] The Abbott family billions won't save us.

[18:25] We've got to make sure we have a hit.

[18:28] And ultimately, it should come down to this for all of these Pinball companies.

[18:32] We want to make something that we have pride in.

[18:35] That's the point of making a game if this game is not going to be a masterpiece.

[18:39] Why would we even bother?

[18:41] Why would we get into Pinball if we're not going to do something different, somewhat

[18:46] revolutionary, somewhat innovative?

[18:49] Why?

[18:50] Why are we here?

[18:51] We're just here to make money.

[18:52] This is the last place you would go if you wanted to make money.

[18:55] There's so much complexity.

[18:57] When we see these tours of the factory, who the hell wants to get into Pinball manufacturing

[19:02] to make money?

[19:03] You only get into it because you love it, because the passion is there.

[19:07] But we're not seeing nearly that level of passion in the final products.

[19:12] And you know it, not for this much money.

[19:15] Sure at $5,000 I'm willing to accept Galactic Tank Force or $6,000, but at $11,000, I don't

[19:23] know, doesn't feel like it's there.

[19:25] Where the magical mechs?

[19:27] Everybody look, I love doing this show.

[19:29] I'm trying to change Pinball culture for the better.

[19:32] And I think look, there's a lot of pressure on these companies, but with pressure there's

[19:36] privilege.

[19:37] And they have the privilege of making Pinball machines.
