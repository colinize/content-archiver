[00:00] You're simply the best!

[00:06] Better than all the rest!

[00:10] Better than anyone!

[00:15] Anyone I live in my bed!

[00:24] Simply the Best Pinball Podcast!

[00:27] This one, right? We're gonna win the Twippy Award for Best Pinball Podcast this Friday because all of you who listen went and voted for me, right?

[00:35] Now, I still think Nate Chivers is probably gonna win it.

[00:38] Welcome to episode 193 of Canadian Pinball Podcast! I've been a busy man!

[00:44] You probably have noticed that in the last few weeks, our cadence of podcast, it has decreased.

[00:51] We're no longer doing like 2-3 shows every week.

[00:55] And I always said, I want to do this show when I feel like doing it.

[00:59] When I feel like there's news and I feel like there is stuff to cover.

[01:03] And I think all of us in the Pinball world have noticed that this time of year, things start to slow down.

[01:10] It's the buildup to Texas Pinball Festival where things start to heat up again.

[01:15] But that doesn't mean there's not news. It doesn't mean that you guys out there are not thinking about Pinball.

[01:22] I've been traveling for work. I just got back from Santa Barbara.

[01:27] And as you know, some of you may know, there are no direct flights from Santa Barbara to New York.

[01:33] So I've had some long, long days.

[01:36] Was pitching some new business, was at airports and on planes.

[01:42] I probably spent about within a three-day period, about 20 hours on planes and in airports for one hour meeting.

[01:51] So it drained me. It drained me. But I did manage to get up a podcast for you guys on that trip.

[01:58] But I'm back. And Brendan and I, we had an engagement party last night, which was a lot of fun.

[02:05] I feel like I've been drinking and eating like shit since Thanksgiving.

[02:11] I'm still like working out as much as I can.

[02:14] I don't know how you guys who like just eat crap do it.

[02:17] Because doesn't your body just like start to feel so bad?

[02:22] I mean, that's how mine is. Like as I get older, I can't even recover from a hangover like after, if I drink two days in a row, I'm destroyed for a week.

[02:31] Anyway, you don't want to hear about my hangover, my eating issues. You want to hear about Pinball.

[02:36] So here's what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[02:39] We're going to go down what's going on in the hobby with the different manufacturers.

[02:44] And we're just going to go down a list of things that I know you are probably talking about speculating about and thinking about when you think about Pinball.

[02:52] So I want to cover up on the manufacturers. I also want to just give you guys a real quick, maybe five minute, how I really feel about getting rid of Magic Girl.

[03:01] Now that I'm fully paid and I've received full payment, I want to tell you what I really think about the game and the man behind it.

[03:09] I want to give my honest, honest assessment of the game. Then I want to go to bed.

[03:17] Alright, so let's jump right into it. So here are the big things going on in Pinball. And here's sort of my observation.

[03:24] So number one on my list is American Pinball.

[03:27] And I really do think that American Pinball has a golden opportunity to strike right now.

[03:34] I think if you look at the window, the window to get Houdini out into market, this is the perfect window because there is nothing else shipping right now that is sort of setting the world on fire.

[03:49] Alright, we're going to talk a little bit later on about Gardens the Galaxy and what's going on with that title.

[03:53] But that game is not setting the world on fire.

[03:56] Star Wars, I think everyone wants a Star Wars, has a Star Wars.

[04:01] I doubt there's tons of new orders flying in for Star Wars. We still have a window to get Pirate to the Caribbean out.

[04:08] Right, Monster Bash, remake, not announced yet. I think the next couple months of these guys can really ramp up and get games out.

[04:17] This is their window.

[04:19] Now I got an email from Friend of the Show, Josh Kugler and Josh, thank you always for reaching out.

[04:25] And Josh, as you know, is coding Houdini and he is an integral part of the American Pinball team.

[04:33] And I think Josh is just like this amazingly transparent communicator.

[04:37] So many of you know what's going on with Houdini, with American Pinball because of Josh.

[04:42] Josh understands one very simple principle.

[04:46] Communication with Inanishh Habi, where thousands of potential buyers reside on message boards and forums is critical.

[04:57] If you want to operate in Pinball and just go silent to the community, you're not going to be very successful unless your name is Stern Pinball.

[05:07] Stern knows they don't really have to bother going on to the forums because Stern is the only company that actually ships machines consistently.

[05:16] And I think they understand when to use and not to use social media.

[05:21] But Josh is always on there. He's keeping everyone up to date.

[05:24] And I said that, you know, I thought when they shipped only one Houdini out in the end of January, that it was a little bit of a PR move.

[05:32] I also said that if they can't get volume high enough, people are going to move on because they're not going to want to wait around for a long time.

[05:40] Now I have a little bit of a news update. Josh let me know that when they ramp up production, really randomly that word has been so overused in Pinball.

[05:53] And I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when they ramp up production. Josh is telling me that they will be able to make over a hundred games a month.

[06:03] Now I want to use Woody Ag, his exact words to me. They will be able to do more than a hundred a month, but he would expect to be well above that number.

[06:15] So take it with a grain of salt, producing your first machine as a pinball manufacturer, not easy. We give him credit. The game is out. It's out in public.

[06:26] The other thing that it sounds like is happening with them. And I said this would be a problem. I said it. They have too many distributors who signed up.

[06:35] And what happens then is you get into the political nightmare of you now owe games to all these different distributors because they've all taken $250 deposits and their customers want their games.

[06:51] Now how do you allocate Houdini machines now? Who gets the most? Is it the distributor that's the largest or do you want each distributor to get a game? It's not easy to figure it out.

[07:05] And I think what they've done is the distributors that could actually drive and pick up the machines are getting the first ones allocated.

[07:13] But if you bought a Houdini, you have absolutely no idea when you're getting your game. And that's the difficult part. It's the real difficult part of this whole thing.

[07:26] And look, I'm curious as to how patient people will be to wait for a pinball machine. And again, I think the window for these guys they have to get machines out before pie or to the Caribbean starts shipping.

[07:41] And monster bash remake and iron made in like there's a there's a wave of new titles coming. So I think it's a good window for them. But look, I look forward to seeing people unbox the game.

[07:55] The number one thing people are going to be looking for when they open up their Houdini is the quality there. Are there any issues with the game out of the box? What is it play like?

[08:06] Because there's nothing more frustrating. It doesn't matter if you're a new manufacturer or an old one. You spend a lot of money on these things. You want them to work. And you want them to almost work perfectly. In fact, everyone wants it to be perfect out of the box.

[08:22] The majority of people who buy new and box pinball machines don't want them fixed switches. They don't want to have mechanical errors. They don't. They want the game to work. And they deserve it to work because every pinball company out there should have good quality control and testing before game goes into a box.

[08:44] Now nothing is a guarantee. It's a 300 pound machine bouncing around a truck on its way to your house. So you might expect some issues. But for the most part, I think the quality of this machine early on is going to be critical. All right. So speaking of quality of the initial batch of machines.

[09:04] Let's move on to highway pinball. And highway pinball. This continues to be the same sort of story and the story being that people who are waiting for refunds are still not getting refunds. But lo and behold, there's a new code update.

[09:19] And I've said it from the very beginning when these new investors took the reins that they were going to do everything in their power to try and win the race. And the race to them was simple.

[09:33] Can we get games out fast enough and get the word of mouth that it's worth waiting for? Can we win that race versus the race for people to get a refund?

[09:46] I've always recommended people get refunds because I still to this day believe that nobody at this point nobody should be insecure about where their money is. And if they're going to succeed, let them succeed with their own money.

[10:02] And not yours. Now here's the thing. Here's the thing for you, Ellie owners out there. The pain continues to hang over you. You still don't know when you're going to get a game.

[10:16] And I want to read something that is it Morgan over at highway pinball. I want to read what he told an Ellie owner last week or a few days ago.

[10:27] When asked when am I going to get my alien Ellie? You would think by now these guys would have some sort of understanding of production cadence.

[10:40] They have 500 L's to make. And so you think they would know all right, like your Ellie is this number. And we're going to get to that number on this date.

[10:50] And then it's going to be put on a ship or in a crate and make its way to coin taker or directly to you. So this gentleman, he ordered his alien Ellie October of 2016.

[11:04] So this is what Morgan said. Thank you for contacting us today and thank you for the support of our company.

[11:13] We are hard at work here at highway pinball to get machines produced and into the hands of customers across the world as soon as possible.

[11:22] I do not have specific update on your machine at the moment and can instead say that we are aiming to get machines produced and out ASAP.

[11:33] I thank you from all the team here at highway and we hope to be in contact again soon with more substantial information for you.

[11:41] All right, so that was communication that I think happened even like last week or a couple days ago.

[11:49] And so here's the thing. Here's the thing. And again, like this is up for you Ellie guys to decide what your options are if you even think you have options.

[11:58] But the fact that we are now in January of 2018, you know, which is a good like six plus months since these new investors have taken over the company.

[12:09] And in that six months, they still don't know like when people are going to get their machines.

[12:16] And it has to be really frustrating. It has to continue to raise the red flags that they still just are kind of winging it.

[12:26] And they're doing it like one game at a time, one game at a time. But it's is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is the quality there? Right.

[12:35] I still when I read the alien thread, it's hard for me not to feel like the thread is the following. It just sounds like the same 20 dudes talking to each other.

[12:47] Most of them don't even have their machines yet. And it's all of them just hoping and praying they're going to get their machine.

[12:54] And there's a lot of justification for how great the machine is. The people who buy it, they really have no other way to vocalize their purchase other than to like overly glorify the machine.

[13:09] And then I just read this as I was collecting notes, someone just opened up an alien pinball. And this is Pinside user, we're a pinball from Middletown, Ohio.

[13:21] And he's warming, he warms it up to room temperature. He says before I turn it on and update the code, is there a list of common stuff to check?

[13:28] I did a visual on the connector is only found one loose and one solenoid wire that came off. And Ted basically said you should check everything.

[13:38] So he he turns on his brand new alien pinball machine. And he says so far, ball won't launch up the ramp.

[13:45] He hits it and comes back to the kicker ball won't go into the mouth hits alien jaw and falls off high pitch sound when I hold the left flipper nothing like a high pitch sound when you hold the left flipper.

[13:57] That's that's the sound of Andrew highway screaming.

[14:01] Um, trough or tro kicker was too strong in ball trough. I only say this word wrong and ball will bounce right back into the trough.

[14:11] The tro man, I got to just like remember this word. He fixed that. So look at some point at some point the fact of the matter is these games have issues they ship with issues. They're clearly not.

[14:27] Quality tested where they should be there probably rushing games out and also like the long journey from the UK. I don't care what anybody says coming all the way from the UK to the US with a pinball machine.

[14:42] The more bumps the more ocean swells the more trucks it goes in and out of the more hands that touch it.

[14:50] There's a greater likelihood something will happen with the game. Okay. So that's where we're at people aren't getting their money back the games that are shipping or having issues and if you're an le owner.

[15:00] You have no choice other than to stay on the painful weight. So that's alien pinball. I again I still predict these guys will go under.

[15:11] I think they're my prediction is they are going to show it clean at tpf and people are just going to roll their eyes and never given them a pre order dollar and honestly let's be honest for a moment dear listener of the show clean pinball is not going to be the title that gets these guys out of the red.

[15:31] It's just not bad marketing. I think this whole company has been ill conceive these guys would be better off fold and close highway pinball and reopen if they want to reopen under a new name and a whole new approach and go get normal balli William style cabinets.

[15:51] Ditch the whole modular thing ditch like clean as the next theme ditch everything start over they need a complete rehaul and I think they're going to try and salvage highway pinball and I think that's a mistake I do I do I think it's time to move on.

[16:08] All right let's move on to stern pinball. So stern pinball there's there's like this is like what I notice is going on well first and foremost I will let you guys know that iron maiden is 100% going to be the next game that comes out I know I like dance around this stuff it's coming out it's next it's zombie Eddie and it's Keith L.

[16:28] All right exciting exciting stuff if you like iron maiden which is not me which is nobody I know but look I've said it before this band has sold tens of millions of albums they have millions of millions of fans I just don't happen to know any of them.

[16:46] So if you are a fan though you have to be excited by this news. Now the thing that like is the big question mark and I'm noticing more and more.

[16:56] This is the big question mark is who's going to code the game is it going to be Lonnie is it going to be Dwight is it going to be lineman you know and look I don't I don't I can't imagine it being lineman sheets I really can't the rumor is that lineman's next game will be Elvira he's not done with Batman Elvira is not coming out in 2018 okay I can confirm that you will not

[17:25] see Elvira anytime in 2018 so that does make me curious does lineman have time to code a game after Batman before Elvira because here's the real problem with Elvira and the way they fucked up the announcement of it it was never supposed to be announced the game could be so early on it's not even funny Elvira might not come out until like October of 2019 that's not going to be a good thing.

[17:54] 2019 that could be when we see it and now that's almost like two years since he started on Batman so I think there might be a window where he does code another game so I wouldn't rule it out but at the real thing is this and this is this is like the unspoken yet spoken thing I'm I'm in the camp of the only stern machines worth owning our machines that are coded by lineman sheets I think it's it's it's come to that

[18:24] point where he's the only one who really really has coding down to a science that makes everyone else's efforts seem a little bit average a little bit mediocre and it's just it's amazing what he can do with a game and I think no one would disagree.

[18:43] Now I think it's kind of strange that we can't hire new coders or programmers to follow in the footsteps of lineman sheets right I mean stern is the biggest company in the world why don't they hire a coder for lineman to train to be his predecessor I think we're at that point I mean come on stern hire a guy pay him 75,000 a year 50 80,000 a year your job is to become the next lineman you're going to shadow him we're going to

[19:13] pay you you're going to learn the art of coding amazing pinball and then imagine that imagine if they had like three young lineman sheets replacements that learned from him and I think the problem nowadays is the institutional knowledge of how to code a game and make it great it isn't being passed on to anyone it isn't you know there's a lot of like speculation about what will will Keith Elwin even help with the coding of iron made in the game.

[19:43] Since he's such a good player he understands rulesets and all that jazz but I'll say this the magic and good code it's not just rulesets it's a balance right it's a dance between the software the hardware the scoring the emotion the music the visuals it is all of those things have to come together to make that magic happen and just nobody does it better than lineman I think the second best code in the world is definitely Keith.

[20:11] Keith Scott and sort of overboard with like quality quality versus quality like just too many modes and like the habit like just too much going on he needs to like simplify it a little bit but Keith is great too he's I think what Keith needs is just an awesome theme to work with and I don't think we're going to get it until I don't know I don't know pirates it can be that way I mean pirates seems like another one with like code overkill like 120 something modes you never play the same thing.

[20:41] I don't really believe I can just use any mode twice there's random selection of modes I do people want to randomly select their game I don't know I kind of like going in with a strategy and being able to pick all right so

[20:50] that's what's going on with

[20:53] UM you know iron Maiden and so look the other thing that's happening was stern right now it just if you read the form it's kind of getting really nasty a negative

[21:01] If you read the forum, it's kind of getting really nasty and negative.

[21:05] Everyone is just down and out on Guardians of the Galaxy.

[21:09] I don't think I've seen a title come out recently that just has so little enthusiasm for

[21:16] it.

[21:17] And then the people who buy it are like, I actually like it.

[21:20] I guess there's so much hate coming from the sidelines of this game.

[21:25] But our friend Jeff over at the Pimbal Podcast, he broke it down.

[21:30] He just broke it down.

[21:31] And he like dropped the hammer on why this game is like just shitty and doesn't deserve

[21:38] your dollars.

[21:39] I mean, I don't have his email pulled up here or his post.

[21:43] But I mean, I think what everyone's been thinking, it's like an uninspired copycat layout.

[21:50] The rules are just copycats of Erasmus.

[21:53] There's nothing original there.

[21:56] This got like the most imbalanced scoring in any game where the easiest things to do

[22:01] in the game give you the highest points.

[22:04] So you take the challenging route and you make more less points.

[22:09] But the big issue seems to be like the theme integration just seems to be like these clips

[22:14] are just thrown up there with no rhyme or reason.

[22:17] Like stuff's happening on the screen that doesn't synchronize with the game at all.

[22:21] And it just seems to be so disjoined.

[22:24] Like where Stern, they got the assets, but then they just like didn't integrate them.

[22:29] And it just seems like they are layered on top of a Pimbal machine without any true rhyme

[22:34] or reason.

[22:35] You know, you have sounds going on in the game and sounds happening on the screen that

[22:40] don't reflect what's going on with the actual Pimbal experience.

[22:45] And I think we're at the point now where people have had so many good Pimbal experiences

[22:51] that when you get it wrong, like you really get it wrong.

[22:55] Like people have no, they're not going to like accept something that is just a half-ass

[23:04] effort in terms of integrating a theme into the Pimbal machine.

[23:09] So that's where Guardians is at right now.

[23:11] I mean, there's not a lot of Guardians love out there.

[23:14] There's not.

[23:15] And I keep hearing there's like an terrible implementation of the magnet.

[23:19] It just sort of throws the ball into the outlay.

[23:21] I don't know.

[23:22] Maybe that's just someone setting it up poorly.

[23:24] But there's just not the enthusiasm for this game that I think Stern thought there would

[23:28] be.

[23:29] I have as I've said, I don't think they're going to come close to selling 600 Elise of this

[23:35] machine.

[23:36] I think the W.W.E. armor will continue to be the bane of Gary Stern's existence.

[23:42] He'll never get rid of it.

[23:43] He'll never get rid of this armor.

[23:46] It's going to end up being on everything moving forward just to get rid of it.

[23:51] So that's what's happening, man.

[23:52] Stern's sort of like in this weird place because I definitely think Stern is going to have

[23:59] a sales decline.

[24:03] They're not going to have 40% growth in 2018.

[24:06] Not with the titles they have slated for 2018.

[24:09] There is no way they're going to have it.

[24:11] All right.

[24:12] Now speaking of Stern quality, I had to lift the playfield on my Batman 66 because I was

[24:17] having two issues with my game.

[24:19] One issue was with the Batcave spinner on the turntable.

[24:25] The ball gets hung up on there sometimes.

[24:28] It creates almost like a little lip where the spinner is sitting just a little bit higher

[24:33] than the area behind it, which the ball can get hung up on.

[24:39] You can nudge the machine and it can come out.

[24:42] There's that issue.

[24:43] The other issue I was having since day one was the Batman crane.

[24:48] It would never sit on the insert properly and whenever it would swing out to the left,

[24:55] it would always swing out to the left and then swing back to the right.

[25:00] It was loose, the crane.

[25:02] It wasn't...

[25:04] I could move the crane a good almost four inches back and forth when it was supposed

[25:09] to be on one spot.

[25:11] When I realized, I was trying to troubleshoot this and this is always a problem not having

[25:15] a pin sight.

[25:16] I couldn't ask people's opinions.

[25:18] I actually thought the mechanism was really easy to work on and I worked on it myself.

[25:23] Basically, the way the mech works is that crane is moved by a rubber poly.

[25:31] It's like a rubber...

[25:32] God, I don't even think poly is the right word.

[25:35] It's like a rubber belt.

[25:37] It's a rubber belt that's between the motor and the mechanism.

[25:41] There's about, I would say, maybe four to five inches between where the belt is attached

[25:49] to the belt drive.

[25:50] The teeth of the motor and then the mech.

[25:54] What I realized is there was just too much slack in the belt and it was slipping and that's

[25:58] what was causing it to swing out and then come back.

[26:04] I saw that the mech on the left, the motor part, you could actually unscrew it and you

[26:10] could move it to the left so that would create more tension and get a tighter, make the

[26:15] belt tighter.

[26:18] I did that and it worked perfectly.

[26:20] Brenda helped me hold it in the last position because you can see on the board when it's

[26:28] at each location of the insert and she held it at the final top position and then I tightened

[26:35] it.

[26:36] I'm going to make a part as much as I could to get a really nice tightness between it and

[26:40] now it works perfect.

[26:42] I'm super happy.

[26:43] Super happy.

[26:44] Now, the turntable, getting to that batcave spinner, it's not easy.

[26:51] I don't think I have the right tool to do it because you have to rotate the turntable and

[26:57] then you have to sort of, I can't get to the screw.

[27:01] There's like three screws that I apparently help you lower and raise that batcave and

[27:07] what I don't want to do is start taking apart that turntable.

[27:11] It is a ginormous mechanism.

[27:14] I get nervous every time I go near it.

[27:17] It's also nerve wracking too because when you lift your playfield that turntable is like

[27:21] held down by gravity.

[27:23] So when the playfield is up, it sort of shifts up a little bit and then when you go to

[27:31] turn the turntable with your diagnostic menu, it won't turn the turntable because the

[27:37] cogs are not touching.

[27:39] It freaks me out.

[27:40] I was like, oh, fuck did I break it?

[27:42] No.

[27:43] It needs the weight of that mech to sit down to be able to turn.

[27:47] But I'll say this.

[27:49] I'd rather nudge my machine a little bit than start tearing the turntable apart.

[27:55] For those of you out there who have a batman, were you able to lower and raise the

[28:00] batcave spinner without doing much work?

[28:03] If you were, please hit me up at canadapimbal.com and show me how you did it or you can do this.

[28:09] You can post on pin side, hey, canada had a problem with his batman and I know he can't

[28:15] post it here but could someone help?

[28:18] And that would be greatly appreciated.

[28:20] But I really need to, I know the three screws to go at but can you get at them without having

[28:26] to take anything else off of the turntable?

[28:29] Okay, that's my question.

[28:32] All right.

[28:33] So anything else going on with stern pinball right now?

[28:35] No, we're all waiting for Iron Maiden.

[28:37] So Jersey Jack, Jersey Jack pinball, we're all waiting for pirates.

[28:43] I think this game is going to be an interesting game.

[28:46] I think releasing it at Expo, now that we've all seen it, right?

[28:50] Don't you feel like it was a mistake to do it?

[28:53] But can't you guys understand the importance of marketing and timing and Jack wanted to

[29:00] own Expo and what did Gary Stern do?

[29:03] Go ahead, you can have Expo because all that did was hurt Jack.

[29:09] I mean, it's almost like, it's kind of like a genius move that Stern just decided to

[29:13] bail on Expo altogether because think about it.

[29:16] The only person that Jack hurt by revealing it early was himself with dialed in sales.

[29:24] And I really do feel like it must have created almost like a halt on a lot of dialed in purchases.

[29:31] So and now we've seen the game for six months.

[29:35] It's on YouTube, it's videos, it's this and that.

[29:38] You know, we haven't seen how the code progresses, but you really do only get one chance to make

[29:43] a first impression and the hype surrounding the launch of a new pinball machine.

[29:49] It's super important.

[29:50] If you don't think hype is important, you're wrong.

[29:53] I mean, it is on any non-essential toy making you want to write a big check to somebody.

[30:01] It's like, these are all somewhat impulse buys.

[30:03] They are.

[30:05] And you want to allow people to separate from their money at the moment they're the most

[30:10] excited because they just saw it and they have to have it.

[30:13] And we all fall victim to that.

[30:15] Oh my God, I need to have it.

[30:16] It's brand new.

[30:17] They're going to sell out of the collector's editions.

[30:19] See, that's the problem with Jack and all this stuff is he's got these collector's editions.

[30:25] I'm in on one.

[30:26] It's a thousand dollars, fully refundable.

[30:28] 200 are going to be made.

[30:30] Well, now those guys have had six to eight months to think about if they really, really

[30:35] need a 12,500 dollar version of the game.

[30:39] People were clamoring to get on the list when it was revealed.

[30:43] But you wait too long.

[30:45] People have too much time to think about it.

[30:47] People might have spent that money elsewhere.

[30:50] It doesn't just mean pinball.

[30:51] That money could have gone to a house renovation to a new car, to some jewelry for people's

[30:57] wives.

[30:59] Taxes might not go the way people think they're going to go.

[31:01] All the other reasons why you might lose out on that sale.

[31:06] So as a marketer, you want to shorten the distance between reveal and selling.

[31:12] You don't want to make it bigger.

[31:15] I think Jack has to learn that.

[31:19] I think he has to learn that.

[31:21] The other thing, when we talk about marketing and we talk about pirates of the Caribbean,

[31:26] for the life of me, I can't understand why pirates, like why now.

[31:32] When you read Jack's interview, there was a good one that was posted on this week in

[31:35] pinball.

[31:36] I really feel like the main reason why he did it is that when he worked at Stern, he sold

[31:43] 6 to 700 pirates machines to customers.

[31:47] He saw how popular it was.

[31:50] And I really do believe that he just felt like he can catch lightning in a bottle again.

[31:57] The same thing will happen all over for him.

[32:01] So clearly he's got the better machine than the Stern version.

[32:05] It is a theme that people want.

[32:08] And that's going to be the big thing.

[32:09] It continues to be the Achilles heel of Jersey Jack pinball.

[32:13] It's a great machine.

[32:15] It's a great machine, but I'll say this.

[32:17] The Onus is now on Keith to do something amazing with this game.

[32:24] It's all on Keith.

[32:26] Eric did his job.

[32:27] The Playfield has got a lot of magic going on.

[32:31] But knowing that the theme can't be integrated the way people would want means they need

[32:37] to work some magic with how they do integrate it, with the code, with the music, everything.

[32:43] It's an uphill battle.

[32:45] It's going to be an uphill battle.

[32:47] But I look forward to seeing the game.

[32:49] It's going to come out in a few months and where the code is progressed.

[32:52] But look, I've said it before.

[32:54] I really think Jersey Jack should be hitting me up.

[32:57] I would have Jack releasing titles that would sell out immediately.

[33:02] Would no questions ask.

[33:04] Sell out immediately.

[33:05] All right.

[33:06] Let's talk about home pin.

[33:10] So they had an update.

[33:11] Home pin said we are almost finished the build of two final sample machines.

[33:17] These are flushing out a few small issues that we need to tweak before we make a full

[33:23] production run.

[33:24] Some small changes to mechanisms to improve the operation and proving the final version

[33:30] of all the boards used.

[33:32] We are also making the final assembly jigs, things like the wiring harness frame.

[33:38] There is a lot of work doing this and it's very time consuming to get it right.

[33:43] Home pin.

[33:44] All right.

[33:45] Cool.

[33:46] You man, look, every weekend I go out and me and my boys, we talk about wiring harness

[33:52] frames.

[33:53] No, nothing cooler, man.

[33:54] That's cool.

[33:55] Yeah.

[33:56] And you look, there is a ton that goes into a pinball machine.

[34:00] I don't envy anyone who decides to make it.

[34:03] Home pin, these guys, you know, look, it's January of 2018.

[34:08] It's another one of these like, you'll see it when?

[34:13] Who knows.

[34:14] I know that when we do see it, it's going to come out in 2018 with orange DMD dots.

[34:21] It is all you need to know about all the time, money, and effort that went into a game.

[34:29] It's like releasing a car in 2018 with no ABS brakes, no traction control, and no fuel

[34:39] injection.

[34:40] Like, it just remove the stuff that actually signifies you understand the innovations that

[34:45] are available to you.

[34:47] All right.

[34:48] I don't know.

[34:49] Stick a fork in these guys, right?

[34:50] All right.

[34:51] So let me talk about magic girl because it's gone.

[34:53] The pain of magic girls gone.

[34:55] I think many of you have experienced the elation and more positive outlook I've had on

[35:01] this hobby since I've sent magic girl away.

[35:05] And I want to just give you like my honest, candid feedback about this machine.

[35:11] I apologize to Robert Mooney in advance as he's trying to sell his for $22,500.

[35:18] But here's the thing, the albatross, it's off my shoulder.

[35:22] And I think I did the world a favor by being honest and candid about this machine.

[35:30] Think about it.

[35:31] Think about the videos I put up on YouTube.

[35:34] No one else has done anything since the reason why possible is because there's nothing

[35:39] you to say.

[35:41] But I opened up the box.

[35:42] I was excited.

[35:44] And I had a game in front of me that I wanted so badly because I did believe that John

[35:49] Papa Duke was was it was a magic maker that he was a designer that approached pinball like

[35:55] nobody else.

[35:56] His previous titles still hold their weight.

[36:00] After all these years, there are still games that are some of the most beautiful, most

[36:05] amazingly designed pinball machines because John Papa Duke understood that pinball is a

[36:11] game that should be magical.

[36:14] I do, like when you read John's like insanity when he posts now, he does believe in the silver

[36:21] ball's power to do something magical that a ball should something should happen in the

[36:27] game that makes you feel like something magical happened, right?

[36:31] Whether it's magnets and that disappear, whether it's shooting star out lanes, saves and

[36:36] toad in, whether it's the theater of magic box, you know, stuff happens in his games that

[36:43] just wasn't happening in pinball.

[36:46] So when he said he wanted to come back with these games, we went bonkers.

[36:50] You guys went bonkers.

[36:51] People were expecting a lot.

[36:53] Now I think the easiest way to think about magic girl and the John Papa Duke story is

[36:59] very simple.

[37:00] I think, you know, not only did John Papa Duke bite off more than he could chew when

[37:04] it came to creating a pinball company from scratch.

[37:07] I think that shows an unbelievable level of arrogance of arrogance to think that he solely

[37:16] could replace the army of people that made his games work that designed his games, that

[37:23] built his games that engineered his games.

[37:26] He really put himself above all of those people at Valley Williams who made his games great.

[37:33] And then look what happened when he went and did it on his own.

[37:38] He quickly realized that there are so many logistical things that he could just never figure

[37:43] out.

[37:44] Now, I think John is the designer.

[37:46] What I mean by that, I think he conceptualizes a pinball machine.

[37:51] But then when it goes to actually making a pinball machine, he's clueless.

[37:56] The mechanisms on magic girl don't work.

[37:59] They don't work.

[38:00] They don't function.

[38:02] They don't operate.

[38:04] And it just shows that John Papa Duke, when it comes to the physical things that have to

[38:10] go into a machine, he has no clue.

[38:12] I think nothing is more embarrassingly bad in magic girl than the spinning black disc

[38:20] on the left out lane.

[38:23] Okay.

[38:24] It's jinx.

[38:25] It's the jinx is on, right?

[38:26] So that thing is supposed to spin the ball and create some sort of chaos, whether the

[38:32] ball goes out lane or back out into the game.

[38:35] It almost 100% of the time goes into the out lane because there is, because John clearly

[38:42] didn't test that mechanism with any real pinball play.

[38:47] Because when the ball has any velocity, it just flies right over it.

[38:51] He then ships the magic girls.

[38:53] This is what the most mind-boggling thing to me.

[38:56] He ships the magic girls.

[38:57] The only mechanism that actually functions, there's two of them.

[39:01] One is the magnet save on the right out lane area, but that doesn't really work.

[39:07] Like it never really grabs the ball when you wanted to.

[39:11] Only when the ball is slowly moving in that area, it does it grab it.

[39:15] Okay.

[39:16] That actually, it's just a magnet turning on, so that works.

[39:19] But the levitation chamber, the King's chamber, that levitates.

[39:23] You saw me in my YouTube video.

[39:25] If you hit it and you hold the ball up, it actually goes up.

[39:29] Now when he designed Magic Girl, he designed a little ramp in the prototype that actually

[39:34] allows the ball to go up into that chamber.

[39:39] He sent the American pinball version of Magic Girl out to consumers without that ramp.

[39:44] It didn't even have the holes to put the little ramp so people could add it.

[39:48] He basically knew he was sending people something that would never function.

[39:53] I'm not even talking about the big center mechanism that does absolutely nothing, where

[39:59] the ball falls out of the middle magnet flab area.

[40:03] Even if you hold the ball and throw it around the back, it falls off and into the pop bumpers.

[40:09] The whole thing is a joke.

[40:10] It's a joke.

[40:12] It is a cathedral built on Quixan.

[40:17] It looks impressive and does nothing.

[40:20] Because of that, it is mind boggling that John Papadouk has another chance to get it

[40:28] right.

[40:29] Now look, I mean, everything can be...

[40:33] I don't think they're going to fix the Magic Girls.

[40:36] I don't think they're going to take what John did and just like improve it.

[40:40] I think they're going to start over and I think they're going to make a working pinball

[40:44] game happen on top of just the art that everyone loves.

[40:49] Speaking of art, I think John Papadouk is a man who hid behind Zambietti's talents

[40:54] in the talents of Matt Andrews.

[40:56] He put the icing on a cardboard cake and when you asked him to cut you a slice, he said,

[41:04] trust me, trust me, the cake's amazing, but look at the icing and that's all he did.

[41:10] He paraded around the hobby with beautiful icing and beautiful artwork for years to deflect

[41:16] people's questions about the actual functioning pinball machine.

[41:21] He also suckered so many people on the hobby to give him parts for free with the promise

[41:26] of a machine.

[41:28] He got the game coded without paying for the full services of apple juice.

[41:34] The game is a joke.

[41:35] I mean, it's a joke.

[41:36] The code is a joke.

[41:38] Think about it like this.

[41:39] Andrew girl has no animations.

[41:41] It is just music with still images and score and they couldn't even code it to work.

[41:48] The whole thing, it is simply a blinking box of lights work of art.

[41:56] If you own a bunch of pinball machines, I still think it's a story to be told and you

[42:00] can flip it.

[42:01] Like, playing a magic girl is an experience.

[42:05] But if you follow the story to the very end, I think magic girl, I think skip B, I think

[42:14] highway pinball and I think Dutch pinball, I put all four of these companies in the same

[42:20] box and I think they all four of them have managed to do one thing and one thing only.

[42:28] They have destroyed the promise of boutique pinball for people.

[42:33] They have added more harm and more pain and more suffering to this hobby than it deserved.

[42:40] And pinball is an amazing thing.

[42:43] It's an amazing device.

[42:44] It's an amazing toy and there is an amazing amount of work that goes into making a pinball

[42:49] machine.

[42:50] If you don't think so, Google Batman 66 pinball manual, go through any stern manuals,

[42:59] much as you want to talk shit.

[43:02] Look at every single piece and every single part that goes into making a pinball machine.

[43:09] That has to go in the right order, has to be assembled, it has to be soldered, it has

[43:15] to be put in place, screwed in, thousands of pieces.

[43:21] And I think stern pinball, people have crapped on them for way too long, stern, jersey jack,

[43:29] bouquet, Chicago gaming and now American pinball, they're going to send people games when

[43:35] they're made.

[43:36] They're not going to lose your money.

[43:39] But the boutique companies, what sucks about what they did is I really think the pinball

[43:47] industry need it more boutique presence to get the quality higher on some of the stern

[43:55] machines.

[43:57] But look, I mean stern staying in business.

[44:00] But boutique always has a special place in all hobbies, in all industries.

[44:05] And it's the perfect industry for boutique to succeed and it sucks that the people who

[44:12] grab the boutique reins, they screwed everybody, they screwed everybody.

[44:17] And now look at us, we're right now.

[44:19] I mean, pinside nowadays is a shadow of the exciting place it was three years ago.

[44:26] I mean, there's no denying it.

[44:27] I mean, I'm bored reading pinside.

[44:30] I feel like so many good people have left the site.

[44:33] It's the same dingle berries in every thread that are just patting themselves on the back.

[44:38] Like, you know who you are?

[44:39] It's the guys who are obsessed with pinside.

[44:43] The guys who are pre-ordered on these machines for four years, with nowhere else to go,

[44:49] but there for some solace.

[44:52] But it's not the same.

[44:53] This hobby is not the same.

[44:56] And I really do.

[44:57] I encourage all of you to add additional balance and hobbies to your life because it's

[45:03] not worth it.

[45:05] The excitement, the pinball resurgence, I'm just not feeling it.

[45:09] I'm not buying it.

[45:11] If it's happening out in public by operators, then that's great.

[45:15] That's where it should happen.

[45:16] Have a few beers, pump $20 into pinball machines, and then go home and work out and

[45:23] love your significant other and have your money put aside for important things in life.

[45:28] But man, there's like, because here's the thing, it's like collectors, none of you out

[45:32] there.

[45:33] None of you really own anything truly special because you're one shot at owning something

[45:40] that was worth collecting was the boutique offering.

[45:44] And it screwed you.

[45:46] It screwed you.

[45:47] Now they're remaking everything.

[45:49] Now like, kingpin's going to be remade.

[45:51] The one shot that real, the real thing that collectors wanted was a pinball company to

[45:57] come out and say like, we're going to make the big Lebowski.

[46:00] Here it is.

[46:01] It's amazing.

[46:02] We're only making 400 and that's it.

[46:04] And the game's incredible.

[46:05] And only 400 exists.

[46:07] You know, if there's, if there's any window, if there's any company that is listening to

[46:13] this right now, the white space that continues to be ignored in this hobby is boutique

[46:19] manufacturer to become the Ferrari Lamborghini Bugatti of pinball to come out and make a very

[46:27] low, limited run game that is absolutely stunning, that is unique, and that is what John

[46:34] Papaduke promised.

[46:36] When deep root comes out and says, well, we're going to make as many magic grows as we can

[46:40] and we're going to price them like kias.

[46:42] I lost all interest in that company.

[46:46] All interest.

[46:48] Nobody, no collector, if they're honest, wants to just have something that everybody has.

[46:56] I say this is like the demon is coming, only 3000.

[47:01] That's why it's special.

[47:02] If Dodge made 30,000 demons, nobody would give a shit.

[47:06] All right.

[47:07] That's episode one, 93 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[47:10] I'll talk to you guys real soon.

[47:13] And for those of you who are supposed to come on the show, my friend in Australia with

[47:17] the P3, we're going to make it happen.

[47:19] And David, you're also coming on the show.

[47:22] We're going to make it happen.

[47:24] I'm just been busy.

[47:26] I'm sorry guys, I'm not this like inconsistent with my interviews and talking to you.

[47:32] I've just been busy.

[47:33] I've been tired and I've needed a break.

[47:35] But I'm glad for all of you who listen.

[47:37] I really am.

[47:39] I get like new Facebook friend requests all the time from people who say I love the show.

[47:45] And only half of those people are family members.

[47:48] Have a great day guys.

[47:49] We'll talk to you soon.
