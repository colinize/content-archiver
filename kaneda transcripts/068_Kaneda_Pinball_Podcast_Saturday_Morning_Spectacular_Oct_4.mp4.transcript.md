[01:10] a

[01:11] good morning

[01:14] how's everybody doing?

[01:17] Good morning

[01:24] we can have to expo we're excited I'm excited

[01:27] and try to read without my glasses how's everybody doing good

[01:30] it's a beautiful day here in Connecticut

[01:33] killings about to go do soccer I got a wedding to go to

[01:37] first time we're having like a all day babysitter come over

[01:42] here one of the teachers watch the kids so Brennan I can go

[01:46] I'm

[01:51] I'm

[01:53] I'm

[01:56] I'm

[02:01] I'm

[02:04] I'm

[02:07] I'm

[02:11] I can't wait to see it I have some thoughts I have some thoughts

[02:16] but I think it's fun I think it's always fun when we get these home

[02:20] brew games and people are building these games you know with

[02:24] with nothing but passion with nothing but passion

[02:29] let's let's welcome everybody who you say hi I say hi back we got

[02:34] chance it's not mass produced what's the relevance

[02:39] I'm

[02:42] well

[02:44] well

[02:46] chance like I mean

[02:48] I don't I don't I don't look at home brew like that

[02:51] you know like if I can't own it why do I care I don't think it's like that at all I think it's about celebrating

[02:56] pinball I think it's about creativity I think it's about

[03:00] seeing the potential in some of these themes that might not even be

[03:05] feasible from a licensing standpoint

[03:08] but it's exciting because you know look we're never going to get a top gun

[03:12] pinball machine ever with Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer and the original movie right never

[03:16] is going to happen

[03:18] so the closest we'll ever get to a top gun would be if someone just made a home

[03:22] brew right and re-skinned in old game maybe or built a new one but that's about

[03:26] it

[03:28] what's up Louis Fizzy Mike Jones everybody how we doing we got nine on

[03:33] Facebook

[03:35] you're funny kill you

[03:42] you are funny

[03:45] we'll never get a good star wars pin I absolutely want to talk about star wars

[03:50] and the the owners club is pretty damn sad and now now it's all about the

[03:58] death star shot is just rejecting left and right it's not working well

[04:03] some do showed a picture of his expression lighting is all wavy like the way

[04:08] they screwed it into the cabinet the quality is not great on it

[04:12] we're going to talk about star wars we're going to talk about spooky we're

[04:16] going to talk about J.J.P we're going to talk about home brew we're going to share

[04:19] thoughts on everything going on in the pinball world

[04:23] I think it's safe to say pinball is more exciting than a Taylor Swift album

[04:27] that album is pretty damn bad

[04:30] after listening to the entire album I can honestly say I will never listen to it

[04:35] again not as good as chapel ron not as good as Sabrina Carpenter not as good as

[04:40] machine gun Kelly's new album lost Americana trust me look there's been a lot of

[04:44] great music recently and Taylor Swift

[04:49] no one cares no one cares now say nothing

[04:54] you know we're at a point now in all of like what we like we collect pinball

[04:59] we talk about pinball we do content about pinball thank you Fizzy for the

[05:04] for the two bucks brother we're at a point now where it's basically

[05:11] we have so much entertainment at our disposal

[05:19] so much to excite us entertain us keep us occupied free us from boredom

[05:26] that it's like I don't know the world's different now like you either do

[05:30] something that that like breaks through or it kind of gets instantly

[05:34] ignored and that's the quagmire that this new Stern star wars is in is

[05:41] it's immediately and I mean this immediately by the masses is going to be

[05:47] dismissed thank you and for the hundred stars and I think the response to

[05:53] star wars has to be sending shockwaves through Stern Pimball there's no way

[05:58] they expected this star wars pin to sell so poorly

[06:03] they're it's embarrassing that the LEDs didn't they couldn't even sell

[06:07] seven hundred and seventy LEDs of star wars that is embarrassing

[06:11] what's caught up to Stern now is a perfect storm that's against them

[06:16] they continue to hand their customers significant financial losses

[06:23] wrapped up in mediocrity of you know mediocre pinball machines with B-level

[06:28] themes for the most part and they continue to burn their existing collectors

[06:34] and customers time and time again releasing a nicer playfield on jaws 50th

[06:40] is a burn to the jaws Ellie owners I don't care who you are if you love

[06:45] jaws there's no like I would want to be swapping in a jaws 50th playfield in

[06:52] my into my jaws Ellie cabinet because I would be I would know like I love

[06:58] this game I want to keep this game I want the nicest version of this game and

[07:01] now the nicest playfield version of the game is in the 50th anniversary not

[07:06] in the Ellie that I spent thirteen thousand dollars on and you just can't

[07:10] keep doing this you can't keep doing this you can't keep burning your customers

[07:14] can't keep making nicer versions of games we all know star wars 50th will come

[07:18] out I don't even think they'll do star wars 50th now because star wars is a

[07:21] sales disaster it's got to be a sales disaster from them is no way it's selling that

[07:26] well and why would they go back now and make another like I think Stern is in real

[07:31] big trouble I think they underestimate it what the competition would deliver

[07:36] and I think they've spent too many years just burning their customer base and

[07:41] the majority of their customer base are not dudes like Neil McRae who just

[07:45] have so much money to burn no like they need it to be more aware of what their

[07:52] core new inbox buyer what that person was was was wanting from them as a

[08:01] company and as I said out of my podcast this week carry harder losing 3500

[08:06] dollars on a brand new Keith L. and King Kong Ellie is a disaster think about

[08:11] that for a minute and I said it on my show since 2000 like basically in

[08:17] Stern's like 30 40 year history you never would have lost 3500 dollars on a

[08:24] pinball machine ever no matter what the game was Mustang Ellie WWE Ellie no

[08:29] matter what the game was there was never a single example where Stern Ellie

[08:33] that someone paid top dollar for would ever lose 3500 dollars in value ever

[08:40] during the entire duration of owning the game never now you're losing 3500

[08:45] dollars in less than six months and they don't see that as like the biggest

[08:51] problem facing their company why would anybody because here's the thing if you

[08:55] want a King Kong Ellie the code's not done and now I can go get one for 3500

[09:01] dollars cheaper than carry hardy so every sucker that bought it new inbox for

[09:06] 13 is a sucker because all those guys could have bought them now for 3500

[09:11] dollars off you know and nobody wants to feel like a sucker nobody feels like a

[09:16] sucker if they bought evil dead nobody feels like a sucker if they bought

[09:19] Harry Potter nobody feels like a sucker if they bought you know Beetle

[09:24] Juice which we're going to talk about but like everything man everything's just

[09:28] like these prices they don't hold they don't hold they don't hold

[09:35] and here's the thing to here's the thing to you know I was just on I was

[09:43] curious because I like let me just check out Elton John Elton John C.E. is now

[09:48] 11.5 as a 3500 dollar loss you know yeah yeah 3500

[09:58] loss I mean given that game is two years old it held held strong because

[10:06] Avatar was so weak I was a sucker I bought labyrinth traded it for John

[10:12] Elie couldn't be happier was it was it a straight-up trade Sean I mean

[10:22] Sean and you got your John with L.E. for like 3000 off what it was

[10:28] yeah you know I agree that jaws and James Bond are the best I would say

[10:38] obviously I think jaws is better shooter than James Bond I think that to me the

[10:45] one thing again correct me if I'm wrong but I'm I grew up watching all the old

[10:51] Sean Connery James Bond movies correct me if I'm wrong because I haven't played

[10:54] the latest code to me the one thing missing in James Bond is all of the

[10:59] funny sort of inappropriate overtly not sexist but like the whole like the woman

[11:09] rising aspect of James Bond which made those old movies so fun to watch now

[11:13] because of how like ridiculous they are is any of that in the game like is

[11:19] any of James Bond being like a heart throb and you know all these beautiful women

[11:24] are lusting after him is that in the game because like I always I never felt like

[11:29] that came through in the game at all

[11:31] all right is in the game okay not real I love this yes not really which what

[11:45] is it I don't know who who to believe who to believe thank you guys for the

[11:50] good news on on on Facebook you know it's very it's kind of like a yes or no

[11:59] question and we're getting answers in the middle I am you know I look I like

[12:07] the fact that I see these people with star wars having quality control issues

[12:17] having death star rejects like how can Stern I the game was rushed by the way you

[12:25] guys do know this that Star Wars was another rushed project that Stern you do

[12:29] know this that John Bork did not have a lot of time to make this game you do know

[12:32] this right like like shelving his Indiana Jones putting him into Star Wars

[12:38] it's not really this game wasn't really they didn't go at it with all their

[12:45] resources and all their talent

[12:48] Kelly dead you know the pitball pal is of course people are going to love it on

[12:55] location you know why playing a game on locations like sleeping with the

[12:58] prostitute you don't have to you don't have to take it home

[13:04] you don't look like whatever I play games on location I'm usually really happy

[13:08] to play it I but Kelly here's the thing no one's playing in me like I want to

[13:12] go by the game

[13:20] someone has Indiana Jones

[13:23] hmm

[13:25] well look it's um it's going to be a I think it's going to be brutal when Stern

[13:32] releases the walking dead and it doesn't take off

[13:37] and that's that to me Stern launching the walking dead increasing the

[13:43] prices could be a real catastrophe for them

[13:50] and I again you have to remember like this company like Spooka needs to

[13:55] make one game a year touch one game a year

[13:59] you know barrels one game a year pinball brothers one game a year

[14:03] a pretty one game a year C. G. C. one game a year Stern

[14:07] Pim all needs to sell four games a year to keep that line going four

[14:12] at these prices as all the old games get

[14:16] clobbered in value it's the writing is on the wall

[14:21] Stern Pim ball cannot survive

[14:26] at these prices with this kind of product

[14:31] this is not me making this up this is the market is speaking to them

[14:36] directly and they're about to raise prices does anyone else

[14:42] are there any economist in the house here I mean I did not study

[14:48] economics significantly I did take a few classes I do know business though

[14:52] I do know the very principles of supply and demand

[14:56] and Stern is now stuck in a position where they have to

[15:01] have an in abundance of supply to keep that factory going but the demand keeps shrinking

[15:14] all right so Charles Thomas just said my friend was offered a star wars

[15:17] Ellie from a distro for eleven two yeah

[15:22] I'm not going to be a star wars

[15:27] do you think it's comic art with hill they call it for TV assets for walking dead

[15:32] I don't know I really don't know I think it's going to be new artwork

[15:39] I mean they did new artwork on Metallica I don't think they're going to get the TV assets I don't I just looking at the way I mean they didn't get the

[15:48] I don't think that's going to happen you know Anthony said like the walking dead is another burn to

[15:57] early owners the problem is this it's like you know when you remake the walking dead much like Metallica what happens is

[16:04] is you now have thousands of the original walking dead games that now become undesirable

[16:13] you then now have all these owners knowing that so you'll probably just keep it because you know they're not going to lose their

[16:20] shirt on it nobody really wants the old one and then if they do decide to like free up room for a new game

[16:28] you are now you're adding even more to the oversaturated nature of the market you see how this is like a house of cards that's just going to come down on Stern

[16:37] and it's going to it's it's already hitting like they they could they must be seeing it I mean the rumors of employees not being happy the rumors of a four day work week I

[16:46] mean I don't think these are rumors people I don't think these are rumors in fact I have like you know first 10 knowledge of people like not like like not wanting to work

[16:56] out there anymore like it's these are not rumors star wars Ellie 18k by Christmas no does anyone know where to get

[17:07] all right should we watch on YouTube let's watch the trailer for let me pull it up for this big trouble and little China game hold on a second let me just

[17:19] pull it up let me close all these other windows you guys can see what I'm working on

[17:24] do do do do

[17:29] let's say the Facebook with the apple has a better camera than a Macbook pro which is kind of crazy when you think about that a

[17:38] cellphone has a better camera than a laptop how's that possible

[17:43] all right let's do this this got a close I'm working on some highly confidential Super Bowl stuff right now all right let's do this go to YouTube

[17:58] big trouble little China pinball

[19:50] Ak展 moderstag Buven

[20:08] f

[20:32] a, yeah, I, it's a teaser.

[20:37] So there's like, there's much more of the movie footage

[20:40] than there is of actual what the game is.

[20:44] I saw more pictures on NAPS arcade.

[20:45] Let's go there real quick.

[20:50] Yeah, you know, look, I will say this.

[20:52] I, I want to see it because I love this theme so much.

[20:57] Love this theme so much.

[20:59] I mean, you know me.
