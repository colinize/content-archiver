[00:00] Pop Patrol, Pop Patrol, Whenever you're in trouble,

[00:04] Pop Patrol, Pop Patrol, We'll be there on the double,

[00:08] No job's too big, no pup's too small,

[00:10] Pop Patrol, We're on a roll,

[00:13] So here we go, Pop Patrol!

[00:15] Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera!

[00:20] Uh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:23] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:24] It's been a rough few days in this household.

[00:27] We have a stomach virus that started with Killian,

[00:31] he passed it to me, I then passed it to Brenda,

[00:35] so I was up like all Super Bowl night, every hour,

[00:40] vomiting, right?

[00:41] It wasn't fun at all, we're all still recovering.

[00:44] Killian is still home today, he's manipulating us.

[00:48] That's why I played the Pop Patrol theme song

[00:51] to start this episode, so you know what it's like

[00:54] being Daddy Canada in this household,

[00:57] trying to pinball podcasts, I got a little one downstairs,

[01:00] so if you hear Lion Guard music,

[01:04] and you hear the banging of toys in the background,

[01:08] that is because he is home again today,

[01:10] he manipulated us, he threw up right before school,

[01:14] because he knows if he does that,

[01:15] he gets to stay home and watch TV.

[01:19] The same way I wish we could throw up

[01:21] before going to work and stay home all day long,

[01:24] and just play pinball, so what is happening

[01:26] in the world of pinball?

[01:28] We've got the conclusion of pinball at the beach,

[01:31] it seems like the big winner at the show itself,

[01:33] listening to everybody give their feedback,

[01:36] was the Evil Dead by Spooky Pinball.

[01:40] It seems like a really chill show, I will admit,

[01:43] I wish I could have gone if they do it again next year,

[01:47] I think this show is gonna be on everybody's radar,

[01:50] I didn't see anybody at the beach,

[01:52] that was the one funny part,

[01:54] I'm like it's pinball at the beach, sit by the pool,

[01:57] have like a pina colada with your favorite

[01:59] pinball personalities, and all the footage I saw

[02:03] was under a white wedding tent,

[02:05] I didn't see anybody shirt off at the beach,

[02:09] well we all know why you don't see the pinball community

[02:12] with their shirts off, you know,

[02:14] it's more of a community that goes into a swimming pool

[02:17] wearing a t-shirt, but man it looked like a really good time,

[02:21] and everybody got to play the new games

[02:23] and hang out with each other,

[02:25] so it was a really great show,

[02:27] so congratulations to Kim and Ed,

[02:30] and Spooky Pinball and Stern Pinball,

[02:32] and all the people who went down there,

[02:34] Jersey Jack was down there, I saw Ken Cromwell,

[02:37] I saw George Gomez, it looked like a really great time

[02:40] at the beach, and I know they probably sold more Evil Deads

[02:44] after the showing at the show itself,

[02:47] the game is still not sold out,

[02:49] but what's interesting about Spooky Pinball

[02:51] is this company really has pulled it back,

[02:54] if you think about it, when they released Scooby-Doo,

[02:57] they announced 1969 Scooby-Doo's,

[03:01] and then when they released, what was it,

[03:04] you got Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[03:08] they were making 888 of each title,

[03:12] the fact that they are now only making one title,

[03:16] 888 of them is a sign that Spooky Pinball realizes

[03:21] we don't wanna oversaturate and oversupply the market

[03:26] with our product, they also don't wanna just make

[03:29] the same game, like I bet they are so tired

[03:32] of making Scooby-Doo's to the point where A,

[03:35] nobody wants it, and the second hand value

[03:38] just deteriorates, so I think they've been very wise

[03:41] in understanding what's the right amount of games,

[03:44] and look, you can make an argument

[03:46] that they might be making a little too many evil debts,

[03:49] I don't think that's the case, I think over time,

[03:52] they will eventually sell all of these games,

[03:55] they're very close, they look to be around

[03:57] maybe a hundred or so games short of selling out,

[04:01] you know why they're not selling out right now,

[04:04] is by the time they make five, 600 of these,

[04:07] you'll be able to get one for less money than they are new,

[04:12] it really does make no sense getting at the back of the line

[04:16] for Spooky Pinball unless you wanna show support,

[04:19] and when I see this company out at the shows,

[04:22] and I see all the smiling photos of the Spooky family

[04:26] with the community, it really does just make you want

[04:31] to support this company, and for those of you out there,

[04:35] if you're George Gomez, and look, I get it,

[04:37] like Stern Pinball makes in one week

[04:40] what Spooky Pinball makes all year,

[04:44] when you think about that, it's not even a comparison,

[04:47] Jersey Jack Pinball has so much money and so many resources,

[04:51] and can make so many more games as well,

[04:54] but there's no denying the fact,

[04:56] if you're like Jersey Jack and you're Stern Pinball,

[05:00] and you're looking at where the lines are forming,

[05:04] where is their enthusiasm in the community around a new game,

[05:09] and you walk over to Spooky Pinball,

[05:11] a company that 10 years ago made games as atrocious

[05:16] as America's most haunted,

[05:19] and you walk over to Spooky Pinball today,

[05:22] and you see what they're bringing to market,

[05:26] you have to be so impressed by this company's ascension,

[05:30] by their progress, by what they're putting

[05:33] into the pinball market, I mean,

[05:35] they are putting into the market,

[05:37] fully featured, stacked games with beautiful artwork,

[05:41] amazing theme integration,

[05:43] heck, they're even like wide body games,

[05:46] like they're giving you everything and then some,

[05:49] they're putting a lot of effort into the toppers,

[05:52] which you would charge another $700, $800 for,

[05:55] they're charging $1300, and so look,

[05:58] there's no denying the fact,

[05:59] I think the new bell of the ball at this show

[06:03] was Spooky Pinball, and I do think it's a little bit

[06:06] of like a wake up call for everybody else,

[06:08] and look, there's always gonna be room

[06:09] for these boutique companies,

[06:11] I think the wake up call is Spooky Pinball

[06:14] is giving people what they want,

[06:16] not necessarily the themes they want,

[06:19] but everything else is what you want in a game,

[06:22] you want a theme that's integrated in an amazing way,

[06:25] you want a lot of toys, you want interesting shots,

[06:29] you also want a company that makes you feel good

[06:32] about buying from them,

[06:33] I feel like that's something that's lost

[06:35] in the pinball world, there's a little bit of like arrogance

[06:38] and hubris and all this sort of like attitude

[06:41] where like we're too good to engage

[06:43] with the pinball community,

[06:44] I mean, think about what's happening right now with X-Men,

[06:47] right, where's the engagement from the X-Men design team

[06:52] to talk the buyers off the ledge,

[06:55] these buyers are all wondering what's happening

[06:58] with the game, are they gonna do more for the code,

[07:02] are they gonna do this, are they gonna do that,

[07:04] are they even listening to our feedback?

[07:07] I am shocked that Stern Pinball has not invited

[07:12] like 20 X-Men owners into Stern Pinball, fly them over

[07:17] and say, hey, look, we've been reading your feedback

[07:21] on Pinside, you have a lot of really interesting ideas

[07:25] on how to make this game better,

[07:27] we're committed to making this game better,

[07:30] we wanna capture your feedback in a very professional way

[07:34] and sit down and help us make this game the game it can be.

[07:38] Nope, they're not doing any of that,

[07:40] maybe they're reading Pinside, maybe they're not,

[07:42] but if you're an owner, you have no idea,

[07:45] you have no idea what the future holds for X-Men's past,

[07:49] you have no idea if they're actually gonna make

[07:52] those eight modes more entertaining,

[07:55] you have no idea if they're gonna code in

[07:57] more side quests to the game,

[07:59] you have no idea if going into the future

[08:02] even means anything in the game, you're in the dark.

[08:06] And I think the old days of like, well,

[08:08] Stern's just gonna make it great like James Bond

[08:12] and Stern's just gonna make it great like Batman 66,

[08:16] I don't think that holds water anymore,

[08:19] I don't think that's the case here,

[08:21] now we all want that to be the case,

[08:23] but again, it's a company that seemingly

[08:26] is leaving its owners in the dark

[08:28] and I think the goodwill that Spooky Pinball

[08:31] continues to create in this community

[08:34] is gonna really, really pay off in spades

[08:38] when these dudes have a game like Beetlejuice,

[08:41] when they have more mainstream stuff,

[08:44] I mean, most of you are walking up to Evil Dead

[08:47] and it's not a dream theme,

[08:49] but they're a company that makes you feel as a buyer,

[08:52] they're giving you a dream scenario,

[08:54] you just feel good, you feel ingratiated

[08:57] into the Spooky family and as more and more of us

[09:00] are becoming very discerning with how we spend our money

[09:03] in the Pinball hobby, it's becoming quite clear,

[09:07] the companies that go the distance,

[09:09] not just on the games themselves,

[09:12] but the companies that are going the distance

[09:14] in building a brand that you feel pride in owning

[09:19] is gonna go a long way and I don't see a lot of it in Pinball,

[09:24] the old days, if you just put it in a box,

[09:26] it's gonna sell, those days are over,

[09:29] we need to see more transparency, right?

[09:32] I mean, look at a game like Avatar,

[09:34] have you seen Mark Sidon pop up at all

[09:37] over the last like three months?

[09:39] If he's not out there publicly getting people excited

[09:43] about the game, why should you be excited about the game?

[09:47] It doesn't make any sense,

[09:48] if I worked on something for two years,

[09:51] even if it wasn't good, you know me,

[09:53] I can't even shut up and I don't even make a good product.

[09:57] I make a freaking Pinball podcast,

[09:59] that's $5 a month and I don't shut up about it.

[10:02] If these guys are making 12 to $15,000 products

[10:06] that they want you to buy,

[10:08] you have to make $30,000 before taxes

[10:10] to buy Mark Sidon's game.

[10:12] The dude should be out there all the time,

[10:16] putting a face to this, explaining why he made this,

[10:19] getting you excited about the game, but he's not,

[10:23] not even their marketing department is out there.

[10:25] It's almost like they don't really care.

[10:28] And that's my thing.

[10:29] We're getting to a point now where this hobby,

[10:32] as big as it's gotten, it's the smallest it's ever been.

[10:37] Let me repeat that, the bigger this hobby gets,

[10:41] the smaller it actually becomes,

[10:44] because there's less room, there's less money to go around,

[10:49] and where people will ally,

[10:52] and where they will throw their support,

[10:54] are with the companies that care,

[10:57] the companies that listen to them,

[11:00] the companies that bring out themes

[11:02] that align with what they want.

[11:05] If Barrels of Fun comes out with Dune Pinball,

[11:08] I've heard you people loud and clear, you don't want Dune.

[11:13] If David Van Es placed his bets on Dune Pinball

[11:18] being where it's at, and most of you, I put up a poll,

[11:21] like 95% of you don't want Dune,

[11:25] then what is that telegraph?

[11:28] You've got a company making games,

[11:31] doing zero market research, why?

[11:35] Why would Barrels of Fun, a small Lutu Boutique company?

[11:39] And look, I also think that Barrels,

[11:42] a lot of that company was born in the shadows

[11:44] of Spooky Pinball, they haven't done a good job

[11:47] of being transparent, do they talk to us?

[11:50] Do they do a lot of Facebook Lives?

[11:52] Do they let you behind the scenes of the company?

[11:55] I think the problem with Barrels,

[11:57] they're also overly consumed with keeping everything

[12:00] a secret that they've stopped talking to people.

[12:03] And I know the people working on those games, like Blake,

[12:07] I think Aaron at Fast Pinball may be working on that stuff.

[12:10] I'm not sure, Aaron, sorry, Fast Pinball,

[12:12] all capital FAST, make sure you capitalize it all,

[12:16] or else it'll come at you with a season this is.

[12:19] You know, there's a lot of good people over there,

[12:21] but they don't speak, and it's like, why not?

[12:24] And here's the thing, David, if it's Dune,

[12:27] you might as well just say it right now.

[12:30] You might as well just say it,

[12:31] you might as well get it out there

[12:33] before the Academy Awards,

[12:35] you might as well rip the band-aid off,

[12:37] because now you know, through the polling

[12:41] of people like Kaneda, that this community

[12:44] isn't like gung-ho about Dune.

[12:47] So if it is Dune, you should warm them up to the theme.

[12:51] Don't make the same mistake Elton John made.

[12:54] If Jersey Jack told you sooner it was Elton John,

[12:59] told you what songs were in it,

[13:01] they would have had a better reception to the game,

[13:04] because you don't want like 95% of the potential buyer base

[13:09] hoping and praying it's not gonna be Elton John.

[13:13] Hoping and praying it's not gonna be Dune,

[13:16] but we're at a whole new period in Pimble, right?

[13:19] It's like we've got big themes like Harry Potter coming.

[13:22] I've heard a lot of your feedback about Potter people.

[13:26] A lot of you people don't want this theme as well,

[13:29] and I understand it, right?

[13:30] If you're like 45 to 65, is Harry Potter for you

[13:36] or is it a kiddie theme?

[13:38] Now the consensus by some of you older curmudgens

[13:42] is that it is a kiddie theme,

[13:44] and hey, you know, I kind of get it.

[13:46] I understand it, right?

[13:47] Harry Potter's a little kid, right?

[13:49] This isn't Luke Skywalker learning his lightsaber.

[13:52] It's a little boy that is living under his parents' staircase

[13:55] or his step-parents' staircase, and he learns magic,

[13:59] and he's got little whiny friends,

[14:01] and they run around trying to find out who the bad guy is,

[14:05] and it takes eight movies to get there, right?

[14:07] It's not Star Wars.

[14:09] There's no Millennium Falcon.

[14:11] There's no Han Solo.

[14:13] There's no Chewbacca.

[14:14] There's no Darth Vader.

[14:16] It doesn't have the same gravitas for a lot of us

[14:19] that Star Wars did.

[14:20] There's also so many damn books and so many movies.

[14:24] Yes, it is a huge property,

[14:27] but I do understand how some of you

[14:30] don't think it will translate well

[14:33] and appeal to the pinball buying demographic.

[14:36] Now we shall see.

[14:37] I'm on the record for saying I think secondhand CEs

[14:41] will go for 20K.

[14:43] As I think about that more over the past week,

[14:46] maybe it was a little bit of my flu

[14:49] or my head cold getting to me.

[14:51] That's a lot of crazy money,

[14:53] especially if they're gonna make a thousand of them,

[14:56] and you need to make $40,000 before taxes

[15:01] to buy one single pinball machine.

[15:03] That's never gonna be rare.

[15:05] It's never gonna be hard to get.

[15:08] It's never, and the more I think about it,

[15:10] maybe I was wrong, but we shall see.

[15:12] I just have a feeling that there is a pent up desire

[15:16] to jump on a FOMO train.

[15:19] D&D did not create it.

[15:22] X-Men did not create it.

[15:24] The last time we got it was Metallica,

[15:27] and there's way more potential Harry Potter buyers out there

[15:31] than Metallica buyers.

[15:33] So I just think that's where we're at.

[15:35] This entire collector community

[15:38] is built and runs on FOMO.

[15:40] The problem is nothing has made anybody feel any FOMO

[15:44] in years.

[15:46] So I think there's a lot of people

[15:48] who have waited on the sidelines.

[15:50] I think there's a lot of people

[15:51] that wanna jump on the FOMO train,

[15:53] and I think when the game hits,

[15:55] if it just has a few magical things in it,

[15:58] the Jersey Jack package is always spectacular,

[16:02] and there's not gonna be any UV lighting issues

[16:05] with this game like Avatar,

[16:06] and it's not a theme you hate like Avatar.

[16:09] I think Avatar brought out the worst in a lot of people,

[16:13] so I don't know.

[16:15] It could possibly sell out instantly.

[16:17] I still think it's gonna sell out instantly

[16:20] because the way I look at Harry Potter is this.

[16:22] I look at it like Jersey Jack is only making 1,000 games

[16:26] because I don't think anybody wants in LE.

[16:29] I think the way they've structured their business model

[16:33] makes in LE stupid to buy.

[16:36] If you have 12,000, you have 15,

[16:39] the $15,000 CE is so much nicer than the $12,000 LE

[16:46] that I almost don't even consider the Jersey Jack LE

[16:50] to be an option.

[16:52] And when I look at it like that,

[16:54] I think everybody who wants a Harry Potter,

[16:57] all like 5,000 people are gonna want the CE.

[17:01] So I think there's gonna be a much greater demand

[17:04] for the only version you want,

[17:07] and nobody's gonna want the LE version of the game.

[17:10] And I think Jersey Jack did that to themselves,

[17:13] and I think it's a reason why you're seeing more

[17:17] Avatar CE sales than LE sales,

[17:19] and the same thing will probably happen with Harry Potter.

[17:23] When I look at this hobby right now,

[17:25] I posted on Facebook this incredible discounted game.

[17:29] If I'm in the market for a pinball machine right now,

[17:32] I'm not looking at all this new and box nonsense.

[17:35] I'm not wasting my life away on pinside,

[17:40] arguing with the 20 alcoholics

[17:43] that are hyper-posting on there,

[17:45] or the multi-millionaires who can fly around the world

[17:48] to every pinball show, but never hit the gym once.

[17:52] I'm not gonna spend my life doing that.

[17:55] The thing I'm gonna do is say,

[17:58] hey, I wanna have pinball fun,

[18:00] and where can the best pinball fun be had for the buck?

[18:05] What's the best bang for the buck?

[18:06] And there's a lot of really, really great games out there.

[18:10] And now that Stern's gonna remake stuff like Walking Dead,

[18:14] how about this for a rumor?

[18:15] What if the Walking Dead remake is just codename

[18:20] for Ghostbusters remake?

[18:22] Think about it.

[18:23] Aren't ghosts walking dead entities?

[18:27] So maybe Kade is gonna put that thought in your head

[18:31] that the Walking Dead as a remake

[18:33] is just a smokescreen sort of codename

[18:37] for Ghostbusters coming back.

[18:39] Look, everybody, we know that Ghostbusters

[18:42] is gonna come back, Tron is gonna come back.

[18:46] We know that the Walking Dead will most likely come back.

[18:48] Anything with dots that was super popular

[18:53] is gonna come back,

[18:54] because Stern can run all those DMD games

[18:58] as LEs in LCD format.

[19:01] That's the loophole they're gonna use.

[19:03] They're never gonna make a new LE of a game

[19:06] that came out with an LCD screen,

[19:09] but if they bring some of those older games back, ACDC,

[19:13] they're all gonna come back.

[19:15] Seth Davis is under tremendous pressure

[19:17] to keep the numbers high,

[19:20] to grow the company,

[19:21] to fit the size of the factory he's in.

[19:24] So they're all gonna come back,

[19:26] and it's just anybody's guess what the order is.

[19:29] But my point is this,

[19:31] there are some really great bangs for the buck right now,

[19:36] and the one I'm looking at,

[19:37] and I'm saying to myself, wow,

[19:39] if you have $6,000, right,

[19:43] that's cheaper than a Stern Pro.

[19:46] That's almost half the price of an Evil Dead fully loaded.

[19:50] That is almost a third of the price

[19:53] of a freaking JJPCE,

[19:57] or a Stern LE with a topper that's two grand.

[20:00] For $6,000,

[20:02] you can go get a dialed in LE machine

[20:08] and have a blast.

[20:10] I mean, I always loved dialed in.

[20:13] I always wanted one more than it really spoke to me.

[20:16] It lacked a little bit of the personality

[20:18] I was looking for in a game,

[20:20] but at $6,000,

[20:23] it's like, wow,

[20:25] the amount of effort that went into that game,

[20:27] it's a satisfying game to shoot.

[20:29] I know the SIM card is a little frustrating,

[20:32] but man, like look at the code,

[20:34] look at the overall presentation of that game.

[20:37] When you stand over a dialed in,

[20:40] you gotta realize, that's Pat Lawler's,

[20:42] like that seemingly was the game

[20:44] he thought would be his masterpiece.

[20:46] He put everything into that game that he wanted to,

[20:50] and yeah, it falls down a lot

[20:52] because of the lack of personality,

[20:54] but it's a damn good $6,000 game.

[20:57] It is probably the best $6,000 game your money can buy.

[21:02] And so I think we're gonna get to this new period now

[21:04] over the next couple of years,

[21:05] where a lot of really good games

[21:08] that they made a lot of,

[21:09] or the demand was never fully there,

[21:12] I think we're gonna see the prices keep going down.

[21:15] I mean, the next stop on a $6,000 dialed in LE

[21:19] is $5,500.

[21:21] And the more we get new games

[21:23] and the more new product is commanding such a high price,

[21:27] I think more and more of us

[21:28] are gonna look for some of these used games

[21:31] where it's just a great bang for the buck,

[21:33] where it's just pure pinball fun.

[21:36] You buy these games at the bottom of their depreciation

[21:40] and you won't lose $3,000 to $4,000.

[21:43] I mean, I think the idiotic move

[21:45] is a Dungeons and Dragons LE.

[21:47] If you bought one, why?

[21:49] You just lost $3,000 to $4,000.

[21:51] Oh, because I want the game, because yeah, I get it.

[21:54] But most of you are not gonna keep that game.

[21:56] And my point is this, yeah, if you really love D&D

[22:00] and you really want an LE,

[22:01] why wouldn't you just wait and get one for 10 Gs?

[22:04] Why?

[22:04] That's the reality that's facing everything right now.

[22:08] So I think it's a really good time

[22:09] to look at some of these used games.

[22:11] I think we're not gonna get Harry Potter

[22:14] before Texas Pinball Festival.

[22:15] That's the new rumor.

[22:17] I wish TPF would confirm for people

[22:20] whether or not the next Jersey Jack game

[22:23] is gonna be present, because if it's not,

[22:26] there's no reason to go to TPF.

[22:28] I mean that.

[22:29] Like, I'm sorry guys, but if you wanna have a pinball show,

[22:33] you need to give people a compelling reason to go

[22:35] and having a new game launched and revealed at your show

[22:40] is something these show organizers sort of need to work on.

[22:44] Because why bother then?

[22:46] There's so many shows now, right?

[22:48] You played everything new at Pinball by the Beach.

[22:50] Are you really a month later gonna go to Texas?

[22:53] If Jersey Jack's new game was gonna be there,

[22:56] yeah, that's a reason to go.

[22:58] If the Twippies were gonna be there,

[23:00] yeah, that's a reason to go.

[23:02] But as is, I don't see a reason to go

[23:05] unless these shows really find a compelling reason

[23:09] to get me there.

[23:10] And yeah, the people are the main reason to go,

[23:13] but man, I'm not gonna fly all the way down to Texas.

[23:15] I would much rather be at Florida on the beach

[23:19] versus TPF where there's nothing but like

[23:22] a Perry steakhouse to walk to.

[23:24] Everybody, thank you for tuning in.

[23:26] We're still getting over our sickness.

[23:29] I wanna thank you guys for your support.

[23:31] We're still just a little bit over 700 subscribers.

[23:34] I don't know what to do.

[23:35] We need some new games.

[23:36] I get it, I get it, but this is still, I think,

[23:39] the world's most entertaining weekly podcast about pinball

[23:43] where we don't show anything

[23:45] and we tell you it like it is.

[23:47] Canade out.

[23:48] Paw Patrol, we're on a roll.

[23:50] See me go, Paw Patrol.

[23:55] You can watch more Paw Patrol in the free Nick Jr. app.
