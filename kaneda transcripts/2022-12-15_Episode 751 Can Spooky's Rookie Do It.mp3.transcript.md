[00:00] Welcome everybody, my name is Kaneda and this is a podcast about pinball and we're going

[00:23] to fill the weekly void with what's happening in the pinball world.

[00:26] So, Friday will be the one week anniversary of Scooby-Doo being on sale.

[00:32] How well has it sold?

[00:34] I think the only people that know for sure are Spooky themselves and as I predicted, the

[00:38] game would not sell out in day one.

[00:41] Now look, that is not an indictment on this game at all.

[00:44] 1969 games is a heck of a lot of games.

[00:49] And here's what I think is going to happen next.

[00:51] I think distributors are going to have these games for sale over the next few weeks.

[00:56] I think they probably will sell all of their units once people start to see more of the

[01:01] game sometime in January and February.

[01:04] But also here's what's going to happen.

[01:06] Consumers are going to start to get these machines sometime in January, February and

[01:11] we will then see the most important question that is surrounding this game.

[01:17] It's not whether or not the theme is good for pinball.

[01:20] This theme is good for pinball.

[01:22] It's not whether or not the game is pretty and beautiful because it is a work of art.

[01:26] This is the nicest looking machine Spooky pinball has ever made.

[01:30] The real question is this.

[01:32] Can the rookie coder pull this off?

[01:35] Because this is the biggest mystery surrounding this entire game.

[01:40] We are going to have someone who's never coded a pinball machine before coding Scooby-Doo.

[01:45] And a game that's got like a lot of callouts, 4,000 custom callouts.

[01:50] I was thinking about this in the shower the other day.

[01:52] Why do they have 4,000 custom callouts?

[01:56] Doesn't that sound like too many?

[01:58] It made me think like how do you actually come up with a list of the callouts?

[02:02] Don't you have to have like all of the modes and all of the rules set and the entire consumer

[02:07] journey you want in the game?

[02:09] I think you have to map all of that out first and then you figure out what callouts do you

[02:15] need to go along with all those different modes and different scenarios and moments

[02:20] you want to create in the pinball experience.

[02:23] So 4,000 though just sounds like a crazy amount.

[02:27] It almost is like how do you even manage that many callouts?

[02:32] Imagine sitting down and you're trying to code this machine and you're like alright

[02:35] I just use like eight callouts for this mode.

[02:38] I've got 3,992 more callouts I can use in this game.

[02:45] I don't even know how you organize it all.

[02:47] It's going to be a herculean effort by DJ to sort of plow through all of those callouts.

[02:53] And then you also got to go through all the different footage from the show and figure

[02:57] out how to slice that and dice that and put it into the game in a way that is really effective,

[03:02] a way that's really meaningful and a way that's going to create magical pinball moments.

[03:07] Now look, I think when people see the Scooby Doo show up on that LCD screen, it's going

[03:12] to put a smile on people's faces.

[03:14] The reason why this theme is so good for pinball is simply that.

[03:18] It's fun.

[03:19] It's campy.

[03:20] Like you know when you watch an episode of Scooby Doo it also still kind of holds up

[03:23] after all these years.

[03:24] So I think a lot of people went in on this game early simply because of that fact.

[03:29] And I think you know we're learning now.

[03:31] Nostalgia is the most powerful thing you can tap into when it comes to making a theme decision,

[03:37] right?

[03:38] And we're seeing it in pinball once again and I mean this when I say it.

[03:40] None of you who are listening to this right now.

[03:43] None of you have seen enough of Scooby Doo to know you're going to enjoy the pinball

[03:47] experience.

[03:48] You haven't seen hardly anything and yet they sold more games in a single day than any other

[03:53] previous spooky pinball title.

[03:56] So what does that say about nostalgia, right?

[03:58] You just add up nostalgia, theme, beautiful artwork and enough to sort of bedazzle people

[04:04] and they don't even have to see much gameplay.

[04:07] But it's not just spooky who does this.

[04:08] Remember, every time Stern launches a game and sells it on day one.

[04:12] We don't really see gameplay.

[04:14] We hardly see anything in the game.

[04:17] The only difference is, is we know what Stern designers can deliver.

[04:21] We know what Stern can deliver from a code standpoint.

[04:24] So I think a lot more people have faith when it comes to those departments because it's

[04:28] Stern pinball.

[04:30] And that is why DJ's efforts on this game are going to be the biggest question mark because

[04:35] what happens if you start to see this game and the code is buggy or it's like really

[04:41] incomplete?

[04:42] We are already hearing from spooky pinball that they will be working on this code over

[04:47] the next 12 months.

[04:48] And that is why I've been telling everybody, if you simply wait and you don't fall for

[04:53] the sales hype FOMO that we're going to talk about next, if you don't fall for these distributor

[04:57] sales pitches right now, which are basically this, oh, we were able to snag a few more

[05:02] Scooby-Doo's.

[05:03] So make sure you get them now.

[05:04] Let me tell you right now, you are not going to have a hard time getting Scooby-Doo at

[05:08] all ever in the history of pinball with like over 1500 of these are going to be collector's

[05:14] edition games.

[05:15] They are going to be so easy to get.

[05:18] Mark my words because it's over $11,000.

[05:22] You're going to have people who commit to spots.

[05:24] And then when they get asked to pay for the remaining balance, you're going to have people

[05:27] who walk away from their deposits.

[05:29] You're just going to have a lot of inventory on this game.

[05:32] And so it is funny to see those sales pitches.

[05:35] And look, I understand it.

[05:36] Remember this, a distributor, they just want to sell you a game and they want to sell you

[05:42] a pinball machine before you play it.

[05:45] Think about how weird this hobby has been ever since I've been a part of it, right?

[05:49] Nobody gets to test drive the car before they are told they need to buy it or put a deposit.

[05:55] That's non-refundable.

[05:57] And that's a weird dilemma for me, right?

[05:59] Because you know, you know that the sales forces that are out there, think about what

[06:03] they're doing.

[06:04] They want to entice you to buy without playing the game.

[06:07] And then you've got Canada on the other side of the spectrum saying, hey, I think on this

[06:11] title, like everyone should wait and see.

[06:14] People should wait and jump on it and make sure it's for them before they plop down money

[06:19] they can't get back.

[06:21] I don't think either side of the argument is wrong.

[06:23] Like they're doing their job as salespeople, but I'm also doing my job as trying to sort

[06:28] of guide people into a little bit more of a common sensical place around all of these

[06:33] machines.

[06:34] Because the days are over, people, where it was just 500 L.E.s of a stern machine.

[06:40] Like Spooky is tapping into that FOMO, but there's nothing really truly limited with

[06:44] these machines.

[06:45] And yes, 1969 is technically limited, but it will never be a rare machine to own.

[06:53] So look, I can't wait to see what DJ does with this game, but I think all of us need

[06:57] to see what he's capable of before giving non-refundable deposits.

[07:02] I hope they knock it out of the park.

[07:04] I hope this game is super fun.

[07:05] I grew up watching Scooby-Doo and I would be a total grinch and a scrooge if I was

[07:11] rooting against Spooky.

[07:13] Pimbo, I'm not rooting against them, but the other part is this.

[07:16] I keep seeing like bug-do Q&As with other podcasters and I mean it when I say it.

[07:21] Think about it like this.

[07:22] When does a movie director do a Q&A on the movie they made?

[07:26] They do it after the movie is out.

[07:29] It's like show people what you've done and then do your press junket, you know,

[07:33] answering questions about it.

[07:35] But it's so weird to me to prematurely do these interviews with these guys because

[07:40] we haven't seen anything and I don't care what they intend to put in the game.

[07:45] And I'll tell you why.

[07:47] Because in life, I've learned this in marketing and in any creative field.

[07:51] It doesn't matter what the creative field is.

[07:53] What you intend to do doesn't matter.

[07:57] The most important thing is how well you execute a creative idea.

[08:02] And so for them to get up there and be like, oh, this is the best game we've ever done.

[08:05] Like this is amazing.

[08:06] I can't wait for everybody to see it.

[08:07] I'm like, cool, great.

[08:08] I get it.

[08:09] You're hyping your machine.

[08:10] But I don't want to do a Q&A with anybody until I actually get to see the final product.

[08:15] You know, the same thing with Stern with like James Bond.

[08:18] Like we saw Gomez do all these interviews and the game's not even out.

[08:21] Like I don't really care.

[08:23] This industry has done everything backwards.

[08:26] Remember, it's an industry that has been fueled by consumer FOMO for the last like 10 to 15 years.

[08:32] And because of it, these companies get to absolutely take advantage of consumers by

[08:38] getting them to buy stuff before you see enough to make a wise decision.

[08:42] And that's the way they want it.

[08:44] And ultimately, it's not their fault.

[08:46] That's what they're trying to do.

[08:47] But we still have all of the power and the ultimate power you can display as a consumer is simply waiting.

[08:54] And that is not a message anybody wants you to think about when they're trying to sell you the product.

[08:59] So yeah, like I don't want to talk to George Gomez about James Bond.

[09:02] I want to see what Lonnie and him do on the game when the game is done.

[09:06] Now, unfortunately, when I go to play the game today at Jack Bar, I'm going to be playing a very, very incomplete game.

[09:13] And I can already tell you right now, I don't like playing Pimball machines until their code complete.

[09:17] All right, so let's talk about whether or not we think we're going to see the Keith

[09:21] L. and James Bond game today.

[09:22] Doesn't it feel like Stern's just forgot about this title?

[09:25] George Gomez said like a month ago, we're going to show you this game in a week or two.

[09:30] And look, it hasn't happened.

[09:32] And there's not even like a date on the calendar and there's not even like a countdown to it.

[09:36] And it's kind of weird because they've already kind of like revealed the game.

[09:41] Like that leaked image is what it's going to be.

[09:44] They've already put it into the press release around the James Bond 60th anniversary junket stuff.

[09:49] So we know this game is confirmed.

[09:51] It's coming.

[09:52] But where is it?

[09:53] Is it even going to be on the line in January?

[09:56] But it almost feels like Stern doesn't even care about this anymore.

[09:59] And I wish they would do a little bit more, you know, and they continue to fumble this like James Bond launch.

[10:05] Like this was the year.

[10:06] This was the 60th anniversary year.

[10:09] And Stern, you knew about this, even though the license holder might have been complicated and difficult.

[10:14] This isn't your first rodeo, Stern.

[10:17] Like you should have planned better than you did.

[10:19] So we'll see because I can't wait to see it.

[10:21] I can't wait to see how overpriced it is.

[10:24] And I can't wait to see if it becomes a day one sell out.

[10:27] I'm telling you right now, if this machine is over $20,000, there is no way it's selling out day one.

[10:33] All right, speaking of over $20,000, our friend of the show, Mr.

[10:37] Kim Mitchell has listed his Haggis Pinball Mermaid Edition of Fathom for a very affordable price of $30,000.

[10:47] Which has triggered the cargo shorts wearing babies over at Pinside who have downvoted him tremendously.

[10:53] Now, do I think a Fathom mermaid edition is worth $30,000?

[10:57] No.

[10:58] Do I think Kim Mitchell thinks it's worth that?

[11:00] No.

[11:01] Do I think he did that to get a rise out of people?

[11:03] Yes.

[11:04] Would I have done the same thing?

[11:05] Yes.

[11:06] Canada would have asked for $50,000 for a mermaid edition because here's what's fun about all of this.

[11:12] I think people forget this.

[11:13] This hobby is supposed to be fun.

[11:14] And a fun troll like that is a brilliant move.

[11:17] My hat goes off to Mr.

[11:19] Kim Mitchell.

[11:19] I think you underpriced it, buddy.

[11:21] I think we can get $50,000 for this game by Christmas.

[11:24] All right.

[11:24] So here's the other thing, though, and I don't really mention Haggis that much.

[11:28] And I took down that slanderous comment on Facebook Live that I highlighted for Mr.

[11:32] Michael Huntsman because I thought it was funny.

[11:34] I thought it was funny to see someone just go off the rails about this game.

[11:37] The real conversation with Haggis Pinball that nobody seems to be able to have because Haggis Pinball won't have a

[11:43] conversation with anybody.

[11:44] Owners have been coming to me left and right, asking if I could somehow help them on their process of getting a game.

[11:52] And here's the truth.

[11:53] The truth is this.

[11:54] A lot of people were told if they paid in fall, they would get their game in eight weeks.

[12:00] The actual time frame for a lot of those people has been eight to 10 months since they've paid in fall.

[12:07] Now, that is just the actual facts of what is happening.

[12:11] Other than that, I don't know like the financial situation over there.

[12:15] I don't know how many games a week they're making.

[12:18] I don't know how many games are going to be in this container coming to the US.

[12:22] But we also know this.

[12:24] The majority of games were sold to US buyers.

[12:27] They are very unhappy right now.

[12:29] And that is why I keep telling people, why would you pay in fall if you know you're not going to get your game?

[12:37] If you know what they're telling you is not truthful, why are you handing over money?

[12:42] They're doing exactly what some of the other boutiques did who had real financial problems.

[12:48] As long as a few games trickle out, they're using that and pointing at those games and saying, see, look, see, the games are real.

[12:56] Pay in fall now and you'll have your game in eight weeks.

[13:00] I mean, eight weeks is the haggis pinball equivalent of highway pinball telling people two weeks.

[13:05] But nothing has changed.

[13:07] They know they cannot deliver those games in eight weeks.

[13:11] And I don't understand why there's not more of an uproar that they are telling people this.

[13:16] Why don't they just be honest like Jerry is over at Multimorphic?

[13:21] Jerry tells people, if you order a game today, the ETA is a year from now.

[13:27] Thank you, Jerry, for being honest and upfront.

[13:30] Do I think you need your head examined if you go in on a weird owl with a year wait?

[13:34] Maybe because we're going to see more of them pop up for sale.

[13:37] And we just saw one pop up for sale.

[13:39] And the same is going to happen with Scooby-Doo.

[13:42] If you wait on every single game, you will be able to get one new inbox or opened with no plays on it and cut the line for people who have been waiting for months.

[13:53] It's just the way it goes.

[13:55] And again, these companies don't want you to know that.

[13:57] These distributors don't want you to know that because those secondhand sales, they don't see a penny from those sales.

[14:04] You know, so that's where we're at in Pimball right now.

[14:06] I think James Bond hype is completely dead.

[14:09] I think Scooby-Doo hype is real, but I don't think there's enough people to buy 1969 games before they see more from this company.

[14:17] And I think the pressure is going to be on this new young coder, DJ.

[14:22] You know, I think he's going to have to show something in January that really wows people.

[14:26] I want to end this podcast with what I think is a really interesting move.

[14:30] And I would debate whether or not this is strange.

[14:34] You're going to have the first person who streams live for the world, Scooby-Doo Pimball, be someone who works at Stern Pimball, a competitor of yours.

[14:43] Jack Danger over at Deadflip is supposedly going to be the guy that shows us Scooby-Doo for the first time.

[14:50] He works at Stern Pimball.

[14:51] That is like having an engineer over at Chevrolet give you a first drive impression of the new Ford Mustang.

[14:59] I love using carguments because you guys can relate.

[15:02] Now, like, it's weird. I just don't understand this.

[15:04] I don't understand, like, how are you even allowed to do this?

[15:07] Like, there needs to be some firewalls between these companies competing with each other.

[15:12] I don't know. I mean, maybe this community just doesn't care and everyone just gets along.

[15:16] But I thought it was interesting that they're going to use Jack to stream the game.

[15:20] He does great streams, but I also will say this, and I'm going to be completely honest.

[15:23] This is nothing against what Jack does.

[15:25] But I think these two hour streams to show you the game are not really the best way to show the game.

[15:32] I think the best way to show everybody the game for the first time is to make a five to ten minute video

[15:38] in which you go over the game and you edit it down so we can see everything.

[15:43] Watching for two to three hours as guys just bang on a machine and then you get some guys up there who are no good at pinball and they're draining.

[15:50] And you just keep seeing the same stuff over and over again.

[15:53] I'm sorry. That's just not the best way to do it.

[15:57] Why can't pinball marketing elevate its game a little bit?

[16:01] And I'm going to say it, like the best sort of reveal videos tend to be the videos that like Greg and Zach do at straight down the middle because it's like a 20 minute video.

[16:11] Everything is packaged nicely and you see everything you want to see.

[16:15] Now look, I get it. Like he's a distributor. You're going to see stuff that's more salesy.

[16:19] You know, you're probably going to see only the good because they're trying to sell you the game, but I don't care.

[16:24] Like I'd rather have something like that than watch for two to three hours.

[16:28] Right? Three hours? No, who's got that much time? I do because I'm on PTO. Have a good day everybody.

[16:58] I feel the way I feel.

[17:04] Man, I feel like a woman.
