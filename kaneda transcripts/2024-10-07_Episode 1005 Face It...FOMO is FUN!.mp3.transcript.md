[00:00] This is what it sounded like after Kaneda overhyped Willy Wonka all those years ago.

[00:17] And this is what it's going to sound like today after you see Alice.

[00:30] Can't keep them down.

[00:32] Are you ready?

[00:33] Are you ready?

[00:35] It's FOMO Launch Day!

[00:38] I love it so much.

[00:39] Here we go everybody.

[00:41] We're not even going to play the Kaneda intro song.

[00:44] That was enough.

[00:46] Here we are on new pin FOMO launch day.

[00:49] And you have to admit it.

[00:51] You have to admit it.

[00:52] What made this hobby so much fun for so many years was the FOMO.

[00:58] And we've lost it for so many years.

[01:01] These newbies have no idea the excitement we're all feeling today.

[01:05] A new pinball machine coming out in the world where you haven't seen anything on it yet.

[01:12] And you know you all can't have one.

[01:14] That was the most amazing thing we used to experience.

[01:18] And yeah, back in the day it wasn't that expensive to get a Stern LE,

[01:22] but only like 500 people got them.

[01:24] And there were like 800 people that wanted them.

[01:27] And it was so much fun.

[01:29] And the games were like 7500 bucks.

[01:32] And if you knew a distributor, it was like no one a drug dealer.

[01:35] You were getting your game.

[01:37] But there was so much excitement.

[01:39] And think about it over the last three to four years, it's been gone.

[01:43] There's been no FOMO.

[01:44] There's just a bunch of newbies who have been buying everything

[01:47] and losing their shirt and losing thousands of dollars.

[01:50] And here we are finally back in the FOMO saddle.

[01:55] The hype train is leaving the station.

[01:57] I have been looking at photos of Alice now for 48 hours.

[02:03] And I've been asking myself,

[02:04] Canada, are you going to do it again?

[02:06] Are you going to get everybody excited again about a game like you did with Willy Wonka?

[02:10] And I'm here to tell you right now, Wonka is still not my fault.

[02:15] Jack told me all the clips from the movie were going to be in the game.

[02:19] And guess what?

[02:20] None of them were in the game.

[02:22] But I'm telling you right now,

[02:24] the good news about Alice, it's not going to be missing any assets.

[02:28] Because there are no assets.

[02:30] There's no movie.

[02:31] I mean, there's assets in the game,

[02:32] but there's nothing from the source material that they're going to botch,

[02:36] that they're going to leave out.

[02:38] It's going to have everything you always wanted in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[02:44] Because you probably never really even wanted anything

[02:47] in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[02:50] Because it might not even be a theme that speaks to you.

[02:52] And I'm just going to tell you right now,

[02:54] this game has a lot of fun stuff in it.

[02:57] What happened to actually having mechanical fun stuff in a game?

[03:02] Like a secret magnet underneath the play field that you can't see.

[03:06] What happened to having like a fun way to save the ball from draining in the out lanes?

[03:11] It's got two buttons on each side.

[03:13] One controls the flipper,

[03:15] and the other controls the spinning discs that keep the ball in play.

[03:19] Hey, that sounds pretty fun to me.

[03:21] Hey, it's got a big Jabberwocky guy that moves his arm up and down,

[03:25] and he moves it much more dramatically than the Colonel in Avatar.

[03:29] That's just a little $2 figure.

[03:31] You know, look, I know that this company doesn't have a marketing budget.

[03:35] Hence the reason why they gave me an NDA to sign.

[03:38] Hence the reason why I've been hyping this game.

[03:40] Look, I'm going to tell you right now, Jersey Jack Pinball,

[03:43] I heard they spent $100,000 on the launch video.

[03:48] On the launch video.

[03:49] And I'm going to get people more excited for this game

[03:52] with just a free Audacity software program,

[03:55] because it's not about polish.

[03:56] It's not about overproducing everything.

[03:59] It's about actually having a game that has the fun in it.

[04:03] That's the most important thing.

[04:05] It's not what I say.

[04:06] It's what's in the game.

[04:08] And look, there's a lot of pinball out there,

[04:10] and I'm really happy for all these pinball companies.

[04:13] And Variety is the spice of life.

[04:15] And we have so many good options.

[04:17] But what we have not had

[04:19] in so many years is a game that created any FOMO.

[04:24] There was no FOMO around James Bond.

[04:27] There was no FOMO around Jaws.

[04:29] There was no FOMO around Venom or John Wick

[04:32] or the Godfather or Elton John or Looney Tunes, right?

[04:36] Or what else?

[04:36] Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Princess Bride, zero FOMO.

[04:40] None of those games sold out day one.

[04:42] I'm here to tell you right now, this game's going to sell out day one.

[04:45] It's going to sell out day one.

[04:47] And all of you that have been hating on me for saying that,

[04:51] all of you, I mean, Bill Brandt has probably bought 499 of these.

[04:55] There's probably only one available for all the distributors out there in the world.

[04:59] No, these games are going to go, and they're going to go fast.

[05:02] And when you see my show today, Join Me Today at 12.15,

[05:07] we're going to go on YouTube, and it's going to be an open link.

[05:10] So everybody can join.

[05:12] You can join.

[05:13] Your momma can join.

[05:13] Your grandmama can join.

[05:15] Everybody, your dog can join.

[05:16] Your kids can join.

[05:17] And you can watch me show you the assets to this game.

[05:20] And trust me, you're going to want to see this game on my channel

[05:25] because I've packaged together the assets even nicer than you're going to see them

[05:29] on Dutch Pinball's website today on Facebook.

[05:32] And I'm also going to give you an exclusive bit of information on this game.

[05:37] And when I heard it, it made me laugh out loud.

[05:40] When you hear a hidden Easter egg feature in this game,

[05:44] that is going to be available to one of you.

[05:46] If you're lucky enough to snag a game.

[05:49] And yeah, I'm happy people.

[05:51] I'm happy that a pinball machine is going to come out that not everybody can have.

[05:56] Oh, it's so unfair.

[05:59] It's so unfair life.

[06:01] Some people have millions of dollars,

[06:03] and some people can't even afford a stern pro.

[06:06] Life is not fair.

[06:08] Canada, you don't deserve to win another Twippy.

[06:10] We're going to have an award show and remove you from the category.

[06:14] Life ain't fair.

[06:16] How could they make an Alice and make her look like that?

[06:19] She looks like she's a prostitute on 42nd Street.

[06:22] And I'm going to tell you right now, people, she's going to sell out.

[06:26] And I know people are like, well, people are going to be offended.

[06:28] They're going to be offended when they see this game.

[06:30] And I keep asking people, well, who's going to be offended?

[06:33] Are men going to be offended?

[06:35] I don't know.

[06:36] I don't think so.

[06:38] Are women going to be offended?

[06:39] Maybe possibly.

[06:41] It's a pinball machine.

[06:43] And trust me, when you see Alice and you see the Queen of Hearts,

[06:47] their special skills are all over this game.

[06:51] And I'm just going to say this.

[06:52] This is the art package that John Poppityu commissioned Zombieetti to make.

[06:57] So, you know, this is the mind of J-Pop.

[06:59] But I'm just here to say this is not a J-Pop game per se.

[07:03] Yes, it was inspired by him, but it is brought to the finish line by Melvin and Barry

[07:10] and the team over at Dutch.

[07:12] And obviously, Zombieetti had a big part to play in this game.

[07:15] And when you see it and when you look at the game,

[07:18] I'm telling you what I love about this game,

[07:20] it's just like throwback to a Balli Williams game

[07:24] where there's a lot of fun stuff in it.

[07:26] There's a lot of like, how do I get the ball there?

[07:28] How does it get up there?

[07:29] What do I do when I get the ball up there?

[07:31] What happens when it rolls over here?

[07:33] What happens when I hit that target?

[07:35] There's a lot.

[07:35] There's a lot happening in the game that's just like surprising and fun.

[07:40] And it's colorful and it's bright and it's inviting.

[07:43] And you're not going to be confused about how to play the game.

[07:47] And not every game is going to be the same

[07:49] because of the way the code is randomized.

[07:51] So you're not going to have the same journey every time.

[07:54] But unlike these modern games, let's all just be honest for a minute.

[07:58] These modern games, they've become so complex.

[08:01] Like when Jersey Jack gives you this huge rule set

[08:04] and they think that's like something to celebrate.

[08:06] No, that is not what Pimball is about.

[08:10] It never used to be about that.

[08:11] When you look at some of these games today,

[08:14] you need to study them for like weeks or months

[08:16] before you really even know how to play them.

[08:18] And even then, most people aren't even scratching the surface

[08:22] of what's in the game.

[08:23] And that's not fun.

[08:25] The key to Pimball is this.

[08:26] You got to have physical fun stuff in the game.

[08:30] And look, the game can be deep, but not complex.

[08:34] And that is something all these companies need to wake up and realize.

[08:38] You can make it challenging, but it should be really simple

[08:42] to understand how to get through the game.

[08:45] And most of these modern games don't do that.

[08:47] And this game is going to do it.

[08:50] And I think when people see it and they see the inserts

[08:53] and they see the shots, yes, it's not going to take over the world

[08:57] and be the next best shooter like a Godzilla or an X-Men or a Foo Fighters.

[09:02] No, it's not going to have the Jersey Jack level of animations

[09:06] and depth to the code.

[09:07] There's not going to be 27 mini modes and a final wizard mode

[09:12] that they never finish, but it does have nice animations.

[09:15] Jean-Paul DeWynne, who's done all the animations for the Jersey Jack games,

[09:20] he was too busy to do this game because he's working on so much.

[09:24] But he gave these guys the company he would use to do the animations.

[09:29] And that's who they did use.

[09:31] And I think they look really good.

[09:33] I'm just happy because finally after all of these years,

[09:38] we're getting a working version of a Zidware-like game.

[09:42] We're going to get a beautiful pinball machine

[09:45] that's going to stand out in any collection.

[09:48] And we're going to get a game that's approachable for everybody.

[09:52] Now, you might not want your young kids to get in front of the machine

[09:56] because of the risqueness of the outfits.

[09:59] But if your kids are daring and your wife is cool,

[10:02] this might find a place in your game room.

[10:05] But when you see this game, I think it's just going to make everybody happy.

[10:09] All right, so this game is $12,500, right?

[10:12] It's a little bit more than a Jersey Jack le, but let me ask you a question.

[10:16] If you buy an Avatar le for $12,000,

[10:21] and they've already said they're making up to 5,000 of them,

[10:25] sure, they're not going to get that many orders,

[10:27] but think about that for a minute.

[10:29] If you put 12 grand on a game that's that unlimited, really,

[10:33] or $500 more for this game, where there might only be 300 in the US,

[10:39] it has more toys in it, it has more mechanical magic in it.

[10:44] It just does.

[10:45] I mean, come on.

[10:46] I mean, it's going to be a wake-up call.

[10:48] I really do mean it.

[10:49] It's going to be a wake-up call because everyone's got to remember this.

[10:52] This is really Dutch pinballs second game.

[10:56] After like 12 years, I know it's embarrassing.

[11:00] I know what you're thinking.

[11:01] I know the backstory better than any of you,

[11:04] but now they've turned a new page.

[11:07] They've got DPX making this killer game.

[11:10] They've got Back to the Future coming out next year.

[11:13] And by the way, they are going to announce officially,

[11:17] so Don can actually give me credit for once,

[11:20] they're going to announce officially, Don,

[11:22] that Back to the Future is coming out at Pinball Expo.

[11:26] So you heard it here first,

[11:28] even though I've been telling you all the Alice information for like two weeks,

[11:31] he's like, oh, does anyone know what the price is?

[11:33] Does anyone come up?

[11:34] Yeah, come on.

[11:35] Like, I don't exist no more.

[11:36] Like all of a sudden, the emperor of pinball podcasting went away

[11:40] and all my little padawans are acting like, I'm not still here,

[11:44] controlling the pinball hype, controlling the pinball universe.

[11:48] It's time to bow down and kiss some rings, you mofos,

[11:50] because this is the show in town, baby.

[11:52] We've been doing this for 11 years.

[11:54] So like, here we go.

[11:55] Like this is Dutch's next game.

[11:58] And think about it, Dutch, the company that made Lebowski,

[12:02] that knows how to load a game up with really fun stuff,

[12:05] and Barry partnered up with Melvin.

[12:08] I think you're going to see something that's really, really exciting

[12:11] and really reminds all of you why you love pinball, right?

[12:16] Why you love pinball?

[12:17] Not an LCD screen, not like internet connected stuff.

[12:22] The reason you love pinball is something,

[12:25] is a beautiful box of blinking lights calls to you,

[12:29] and you walk over to it, and it has stuff in it

[12:32] that makes you want to come back time and time again.

[12:35] And the only thing that could be the biggest problem for me right now

[12:40] is I've never played the game.

[12:42] And I can just see John Erlich and Crazy Levy

[12:46] being like, look at Canada, he doesn't even play pinball,

[12:49] and he's hyping this game, and it's like news flash, gentlemen.

[12:53] Have the world's number one pinball podcast for years,

[12:56] and I didn't even own a game.

[12:58] And I told Brenda I could probably have the number one show

[13:00] and not even play a game,

[13:02] because this is not even about gameplay, gentlemen.

[13:05] It's about FOMO, the fear of missing out.

[13:10] And you know John Erlich's going to want one.

[13:12] I was talking to him today.

[13:13] He's like, I don't want one.

[13:14] I got a chorus.

[13:16] Yeah, sure you don't, John.

[13:17] You've just got like 800 games in storage for your afterlife.

[13:21] You're like some sort of Egyptian pinball operator.

[13:24] They're going to bury this dude in some sarcophagus underneath Jack Bar.

[13:28] He's going to be buried with all the coin door keys

[13:31] so that when he reincarnates,

[13:32] he's going to be able to finally enjoy that entire collection.

[13:36] He's got stored away for his next life.

[13:39] Everybody look, this game is fun.

[13:42] This launch is going to have FOMO.

[13:44] And this thing is going to sell out like almost instantly

[13:48] if it's not already.

[13:50] And the hype train has left the station, Drew.

[13:53] The hype train's gone.

[13:54] Choo-choo.

[13:55] Canada did it again.

[13:56] And I think what all of you miss, all of you miss,

[13:59] is this is where the hype is.

[14:01] Canada's pinball podcast.

[14:02] This is who's hyping this stuff.

[14:04] I've done more marketing for this game

[14:06] and don't even have a penny from them.

[14:08] Because you want people like me to get excited about this hobby.

[14:12] This is what it's about.

[14:13] Genuine excitement.

[14:16] Not these newbies who buy every single game.

[14:19] When you get excited about everything,

[14:21] nobody believes you about anything.

[14:24] But when you get excited like this, trust me,

[14:28] I'm not going to be wrong on this one.

[14:30] This is not going to be Wonka all over again.

[14:33] At least I hope not.

[14:34] Everybody try to get an analyst today.

[14:37] CoinTaker might have one.

[14:38] Great American pinball and pinball traders.

[14:41] That's your only safe way to get a game.

[14:44] Bill Brandis has five of them.

[14:46] So maybe hit up Bill Brandis.

[14:48] And who knows, maybe Canada's got his hand on a few titles.

[14:52] Who knows?

[14:53] Oh, why do you get special privilege, Canada?

[14:56] Because I've done over a thousand pinball podcasts

[14:59] and none of y'all haters have.

[15:01] Later.

[15:02] I get no town.

[15:04] Rock it up again.

[15:05] Yeah, they're never going to keep me tall.

[15:07] I get no town.

[15:08] Rock it up again.

[15:09] Yeah, they're never going to keep me tall.

[15:11] Rock it up down.

[15:13] Rock it up again.

[15:14] Yeah, they're never going to keep me tall.

[15:16] I get no town.

[15:17] Rock it up again.

[15:19] Yeah, they're never going to keep me tall.
