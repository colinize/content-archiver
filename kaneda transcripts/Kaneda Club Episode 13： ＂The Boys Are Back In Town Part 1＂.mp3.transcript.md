[00:00] I'm always a Macintown, I'm always a Macintown

[00:06] I'm always a Macintown

[00:09] I'm always a Macintown

[00:15] Ah, welcome to the Canadian Club Episode 13

[00:18] And before I give you this one of a two-part series

[00:22] about the big news happening over at Chicago Gaming Company

[00:26] I want to say thank you

[00:28] I want to say thank you to each and every one of you

[00:30] and I want to tell you a little story

[00:32] A little over a year ago

[00:33] they definitely tried to cancel

[00:35] Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:37] People went after my employer

[00:39] they tried to get me off the airwaves

[00:41] When I was off the airwaves

[00:43] because I was scared I had a family

[00:44] I had a baby on the way

[00:46] and people really tried to destroy my livelihood

[00:49] because I do a podcast about Pimball

[00:51] And when I was thinking about returning

[00:53] I said you know, it would be great

[00:55] it would be great if we could get our contributions

[00:58] and our support for the show to a certain number

[01:01] and I put out a number

[01:02] and I was ridiculed by everybody else in the Pimball Media

[01:06] You know who I'm talking about

[01:07] I was ridiculed by other people who do shows and make content

[01:11] and they said we would never get there

[01:13] They said it was lame that I would even ask for support

[01:16] right after five years

[01:17] and thousands and thousands of hours of content

[01:21] they said this is a joke

[01:23] and I want to say right now

[01:25] each and every one of us

[01:26] who's part of this Canadian club

[01:28] we are having the last laugh

[01:30] we didn't just hit that number

[01:32] we blew by it

[01:33] and I'm happy to report today

[01:35] that we have 172 members of the Canadian club on Patreon

[01:40] and then we have another about like 30 members

[01:43] that have donated to PayPal and Venmo

[01:46] so I want to thank each and every one of you

[01:48] I want to welcome Raymond, Joey, Stephen, Sebastian C

[01:52] Jonathan Kay, Eric S

[01:55] these are like our latest members

[01:57] there's 172 of you

[01:59] and I really do appreciate each and every one of you

[02:02] and each and every one of you

[02:04] every month contributes to this show

[02:06] and it means so much

[02:07] it's not just saying thanks to Canada

[02:09] it's saying thanks to my family

[02:11] my beautiful wife

[02:12] my child who allow me to do this on a weekly basis

[02:16] I mean that because all of the time it takes to do this

[02:19] I'm so thankful that you show your support

[02:22] and that is why I'm going to give you

[02:24] stuff before everybody else

[02:26] I'm not only going to give you what's going on at CGC

[02:29] but you're going to hear it from here first

[02:31] and it's going to happen on the Canadian club

[02:33] you're going to hear what Eric Minier's next game is

[02:35] now when I say that I don't know

[02:37] because Eric Minier's next game is not close

[02:40] but I will tell you this right now

[02:42] Eric Minier's next game is not the Matrix

[02:45] and it is not Avatar

[02:47] and I was hoping it was going to be one of those two

[02:50] I was actually just hoping it would be the Matrix

[02:52] but it's not

[02:53] I will say when I heard what it was

[02:56] when I heard what it was

[02:57] it was not a take my money now theme

[03:01] it's a very very interesting selection by Jersey Jack

[03:05] and I know Jack is in charge of the licensing

[03:08] and they're probably panicking right now

[03:11] how does Canada know this

[03:12] and they're not even near ready

[03:14] to get that game out

[03:15] they can't even get toy story out

[03:18] but I want to let you know

[03:20] and I want to let them know

[03:22] that I know

[03:23] and if there's one guy

[03:24] who you don't want to know this information

[03:27] it's Canada

[03:28] so they're probably going to have to

[03:30] huddle and figure out what to do with Canada

[03:33] when they see him at Pinball Expo

[03:35] are they going to kidnap me

[03:36] are they going to shake my hand

[03:38] we shall see

[03:39] okay so I'm here to tell you right now

[03:41] with 100% confirmation

[03:44] something that we've been speculating

[03:46] but now I have official confirmation

[03:49] from Chicago Gaming Company

[03:51] Chicago Gaming Company

[03:52] and the reason why the song was

[03:54] the boys are back in town

[03:56] they're about to officially announce

[03:58] this week or Monday

[04:00] that two of the industry's biggest names

[04:03] are joining CGC officially

[04:06] now I was asked to hold off

[04:08] on the second name

[04:09] until maybe some time later today

[04:11] I'm not sure why

[04:13] and I'm actually doing Ryan White

[04:15] a favor and the reason why I'm doing

[04:17] Ryan White a favor

[04:18] and I shouldn't be

[04:19] I shouldn't be because

[04:20] I reported something that was 100% factual

[04:24] and accurate

[04:25] and he told me no that's not true

[04:27] take it down

[04:28] he's like not that not that I'm aware of

[04:30] but I'm here to tell you right now

[04:31] that I spoke to Ryan

[04:32] he's a great guy

[04:33] and he's giving me this scoop

[04:35] so thank you Ryan

[04:36] even though I scooped you already

[04:37] so I'm getting this scoop on my own scoop

[04:40] I'm here to tell you right now

[04:41] that Mr. Lyman Sheets

[04:43] is officially joining

[04:45] Chicago Gaming Company

[04:47] to work on code for the

[04:49] Chicago Gaming Company portfolio

[04:51] and this is an incredible

[04:53] accusation for Chicago Gaming Company

[04:55] a company that is forever delayed

[04:57] and now they're bringing on the coder

[04:59] who I arguably think

[05:01] is the greatest coder in

[05:03] Pimball history

[05:04] and if you're looking over at the spooky games

[05:06] right now and wondering

[05:07] why people aren't that excited

[05:08] it's because the code is not good

[05:10] it's not good

[05:11] and they're struggling

[05:12] and Lyman Sheets can make a game

[05:14] incredible

[05:15] he understands what makes a

[05:17] Pimball machine not only

[05:19] enjoyable for casual people

[05:21] who walk up to the machine

[05:23] he knows how to make a game

[05:25] enjoyable for people who are

[05:27] amazing at Pimball

[05:28] and that is an art form

[05:29] I've always compared Lyman Sheets

[05:31] to a conductor at an orchestra

[05:34] he knows how to conduct a game

[05:38] he knows how to make the rules

[05:40] work how to make the clips work

[05:42] how to make the animations work

[05:44] how to make the lights work

[05:45] now if there's one area he could

[05:47] improve it is the light shows

[05:49] on Lyman Sheets Games

[05:50] the light shows are not that

[05:52] impressive but it's more than that

[05:54] he knows how to make a game

[05:55] so satisfying to journey through it

[05:58] and it is an art form I have not

[06:00] experienced anyone

[06:01] who's ever coded a machine

[06:03] that can code a machine

[06:04] as good as Lyman Sheets

[06:05] but it's official now

[06:06] so no more guessing

[06:07] no more speculating

[06:08] Lyman Sheets will be joining

[06:10] CGC with another member

[06:13] of the Pimball community

[06:14] you know very well

[06:15] with a name in Pimball

[06:17] you know very well

[06:18] and that is going to be on part

[06:20] two of my boys are back in town

[06:23] because if the boys are back in town

[06:25] it has to be a plural

[06:26] so there is more than just Lyman Sheets

[06:29] now you might be wondering

[06:31] is Lyman Sheets working on

[06:33] Cactus Canyon

[06:35] and the new Cactus Canyon game

[06:37] and the answer is this

[06:39] 100% confirmed here on the

[06:42] Canadian Club for all of you

[06:44] amazing people who contribute

[06:46] he is working on Cactus Canyon

[06:49] and they are doing new code

[06:51] on Cactus Canyon

[06:52] so Cactus Pimball

[06:53] podcast once again

[06:54] was 100% right

[06:56] even though you know

[06:57] other shows won't give me credit

[06:58] they'll just make fun of me

[07:00] when I get a couple things wrong

[07:01] even though eight things are

[07:02] accurate so they are

[07:03] listening to this right now

[07:04] being like he did it again

[07:05] he snaked us again

[07:06] yeah I did

[07:07] because I knew something

[07:08] and I said it

[07:09] and you knew something

[07:10] and you buried it

[07:11] and that's why we are number

[07:12] one that's why we will have

[07:14] five twippies that is why

[07:15] we have the best audience

[07:17] that is why we have the most

[07:18] contributors that is why

[07:19] we have the best merchandise

[07:20] that is why

[07:21] Cactus Pimball podcast

[07:23] is the number one source

[07:25] for Pimball news rumors

[07:27] and speculation

[07:28] because that's what makes it fun

[07:29] it's fun to say this stuff

[07:31] it's fun to get

[07:33] excited about what's coming

[07:34] down the road

[07:35] and not just wait until

[07:36] it's official

[07:37] because then it's boring

[07:38] then everybody has the news

[07:39] then there's nothing

[07:40] that gets you excited about

[07:41] there's nothing to look

[07:42] forward to

[07:43] so he's going to be working

[07:44] on Cactus Canyon

[07:46] now here's another bit

[07:47] of news for you

[07:48] and this is something that

[07:49] nobody knows

[07:50] and this is something

[07:51] that the Canadian club members

[07:52] will know first

[07:53] on day one

[07:54] when Cactus Canyon ships

[07:56] this game most likely

[07:58] will not have

[07:59] the fall lineman

[08:01] sheets game in it

[08:02] what you're going to get

[08:03] in the new Cactus Canyon game

[08:04] is improved code

[08:06] but the people who

[08:07] made that improved code

[08:08] lineman sheets

[08:09] was acting as a consultant

[08:11] as that work was going on

[08:12] because remember

[08:13] they've been making this game

[08:14] for a couple of years

[08:15] and lineman sheets

[08:16] hasn't been over there

[08:17] for a couple of years

[08:18] so he was more of a consultant

[08:20] on this game

[08:21] that will be released

[08:22] any day now

[08:23] any day now

[08:24] but here is the news

[08:26] here's the real

[08:27] exciting part

[08:28] lineman sheets

[08:29] and this other gentleman

[08:30] who I will be mentioning

[08:31] probably later today

[08:32] they will be given the game

[08:34] and they will be told

[08:36] the following

[08:37] make it amazing

[08:38] do what you want with it

[08:40] go and do how you

[08:42] would do this game

[08:44] if you were coding Cactus Canyon

[08:46] from the very start

[08:47] and so there will be

[08:49] a completely lineman sheets

[08:51] driven version of Cactus Canyon

[08:53] and he will be given

[08:55] Cactus Canyon

[08:56] and he will be given

[08:57] Cart Blanche

[08:58] to make this game

[09:00] however he wants to make it

[09:02] and they will drop that

[09:03] at a later date

[09:04] so you'll be able

[09:05] to upgrade your Cactus Canyon

[09:07] to an even new adventure

[09:09] created solely by lineman sheets

[09:11] and this other gentleman

[09:13] now that is incredible

[09:15] and yes

[09:16] you're going to have to pay

[09:17] for that

[09:18] because it is a whole new game

[09:20] made by lineman

[09:21] now I don't think

[09:22] people are going to have a problem

[09:23] paying for DLC

[09:25] if DLC is new code

[09:27] by lineman sheets

[09:28] I think it's a really smart move

[09:30] and I think it's a really

[09:32] really late to the game approach

[09:34] that most people have been

[09:35] sleeping on

[09:36] because this makes total sense

[09:38] you've got this amazing game

[09:40] that is going to be built

[09:41] better than any game

[09:42] in Pimble

[09:43] like the CGC games

[09:44] they build their games

[09:45] to perfection

[09:46] you don't see CGC owners

[09:48] having issues with their games

[09:50] this isn't a jersey jack game

[09:51] in which you unbox it

[09:52] you love it for a couple months

[09:54] and then you look down

[09:55] and your playfields

[09:56] all over the place

[09:57] right?

[09:58] this isn't a JJP game

[09:59] where you have to take out

[10:00] like scissors

[10:01] and cut the spotlights

[10:02] on your guns and roses

[10:03] machine because they're breaking

[10:04] you don't have to lift the hood

[10:06] on a CGC machine

[10:08] and I give them credit

[10:09] for waiting until the game is perfect

[10:11] the other part is this

[10:12] they don't launch a game

[10:14] until it is completely done

[10:16] now this lineman thing

[10:18] is going to be like

[10:19] an additional adventure

[10:20] for Cactus Canyon

[10:21] but on day one

[10:22] you're not going to have to wait

[10:23] for this game to be finished

[10:25] you're not going to have to wait

[10:26] for additional code

[10:27] or additional that

[10:28] it's going to be

[10:29] 100%

[10:30] an amazing game

[10:31] on day one

[10:32] and we don't see that

[10:33] from other manufacturers

[10:34] and you wonder why CGC

[10:35] is always so delayed

[10:37] because this is

[10:38] their approach

[10:39] the other manufacturers

[10:40] put their games out

[10:42] before they're done

[10:43] and you have to wait

[10:44] for code updates

[10:45] and you have to wait

[10:46] for maintenance issues

[10:47] to be discovered by the community

[10:48] they don't want to launch

[10:49] their games that way

[10:50] and as much as the wait

[10:52] sucks, I much prefer

[10:53] what CGC is doing

[10:54] I don't want to

[10:55] buy a game like Halloween

[10:57] and then just like

[10:58] shrug my shoulders

[10:59] for a year

[11:00] hoping it gets better

[11:01] I don't want to buy

[11:02] Ultraman and be like

[11:03] oh I hope they fix this

[11:04] and that

[11:05] and that

[11:06] no, I want a game

[11:07] on day one

[11:08] to be the best

[11:09] it can possibly be

[11:10] do you want to go see a movie

[11:12] and none of the special

[11:13] effects are in the movie yet

[11:15] and you have to watch the movie

[11:17] you have to see the whole

[11:18] storyline

[11:19] and just imagine

[11:20] how much better it could be

[11:21] a year from now

[11:22] that is not how

[11:23] we want to buy our games

[11:25] our toys

[11:26] our entertainment

[11:27] I want them to be

[11:28] the best they can be

[11:29] on day one

[11:30] and that's CGC's approach

[11:31] so this is really

[11:32] exciting news

[11:33] the other

[11:34] really exciting part

[11:35] about this

[11:36] is imagine if

[11:37] Lyman Sheets

[11:38] and his new partner

[11:39] which you're going to hear

[11:40] later they go

[11:41] after the other titles

[11:42] too

[11:43] and continue to make

[11:44] new adventures

[11:45] for monster bash

[11:46] new adventures

[11:47] for media

[11:48] madness

[11:49] new adventures

[11:50] for attack

[11:51] from Mars

[11:52] and I don't care what

[11:53] anybody says

[11:54] when you're like

[11:55] those games are perfect

[11:56] don't touch them

[11:57] that's not true

[11:58] they're amazing

[11:59] and there could be

[12:00] even new

[12:01] amazing adventures

[12:02] waiting for us

[12:03] inside those games

[12:04] and they're

[12:05] classic games

[12:06] and they're amazing

[12:07] to shoot

[12:08] and that's why

[12:09] they're like

[12:10] ranked in the top 10

[12:11] of all time

[12:12] and so if you own a CGC

[12:14] machine

[12:15] this is such a smart move

[12:16] on their part

[12:17] make

[12:18] games that we know

[12:19] mechanically

[12:20] and on a

[12:21] pinball level

[12:22] are the greatest of all time

[12:23] make them

[12:24] and then now

[12:26] get the modern

[12:27] pinball

[12:28] coder who is also

[12:29] around back in the day

[12:30] and Lyman's

[12:31] coded some of these

[12:32] older games

[12:33] but get the guy

[12:34] who's the best

[12:35] coder in the business

[12:36] to make these games

[12:37] even more

[12:38] enjoyable

[12:39] to have even more

[12:40] longevity

[12:41] and replay value

[12:43] for generations

[12:44] to come

[12:45] I think it's super smart

[12:46] I think when they

[12:47] reveal all this to people

[12:48] you're going to get

[12:49] super excited

[12:50] and I think

[12:51] CGC is doing it right

[12:52] I really do

[12:53] and I think CGC

[12:54] is the biggest threat

[12:55] to Jersey Jack

[12:56] pinball

[12:57] they are

[12:58] nobody's a threat

[12:59] to Stern

[13:00] but if Chicago

[13:01] gaming company

[13:02] if everything I'm

[13:03] hearing is going to happen

[13:04] with Ben Hex new game

[13:05] Christopher

[13:06] Francie's working on some

[13:07] art with them

[13:08] you've got an

[13:09] original game

[13:10] from Mark Richie

[13:11] coming out

[13:12] you've got more

[13:13] remakes coming out

[13:14] you've got the best

[13:15] they are well-positioned

[13:17] and they are positioning

[13:18] themselves I think

[13:20] to become the biggest

[13:21] threat to Jersey Jack

[13:22] pinball

[13:23] because manufacturing

[13:24] and quality

[13:26] is also something CGC

[13:28] does very well

[13:30] there is not a

[13:31] person out there

[13:32] that doesn't

[13:33] appreciate what's

[13:34] in Jersey Jack games

[13:36] but the quality issues

[13:37] with these

[13:38] Jersey Jack games

[13:39] have eroded

[13:40] so much

[13:41] consumer confidence

[13:43] in them

[13:44] and I think

[13:45] if Chicago

[13:46] gaming company

[13:47] can come out

[13:48] not just with

[13:49] these remakes but

[13:50] with pulp fiction

[13:51] with other games

[13:52] that have

[13:53] lineman

[13:54] sheets coding

[13:55] and their

[13:56] themes that people want

[13:57] my God

[13:58] this company

[13:59] is going to be

[14:00] so successful

[14:01] and the orders

[14:02] are going to be

[14:03] insane

[14:04] alright so there you have it

[14:05] there you have it

[14:06] I think CGC is going to have

[14:07] a really, really amazing

[14:09] expo in a few weeks

[14:10] because I think

[14:11] they're going to show us

[14:12] the game

[14:13] and then

[14:14] you're going to hear

[14:15] about all the great

[14:16] stuff happening

[14:17] with the organization

[14:18] so thank you Ryan

[14:19] for the scoop

[14:20] that was my scoop

[14:21] to begin with

[14:22] so thank you

[14:23] I really appreciate

[14:24] you allowing me

[14:25] to take credit

[14:26] for my own scoop

[14:27] that I did weeks ago

[14:28] the last thing I want to

[14:29] talk about on this

[14:30] club episode

[14:31] and be candid with you

[14:32] is the Pimball

[14:33] Brothers

[14:34] and Queen Pimball

[14:35] I've said it

[14:36] when I first saw

[14:38] the Alien game

[14:39] and I don't

[14:40] mean to be

[14:41] hypercritical

[14:42] but

[14:43] first, they don't

[14:44] have taste

[14:45] they can't stand

[14:46] over a machine

[14:47] and say this looks

[14:48] good

[14:49] this looks like

[14:50] it's a modern game

[14:51] capable of competing

[14:52] with what's in the

[14:53] marketplace

[14:54] that game looks

[14:56] it's an insult

[14:57] to call that game

[14:58] a home-brew-looking game

[14:59] because there are

[15:00] many home-brew game

[15:01] that look better than

[15:02] that

[15:03] it just doesn't

[15:04] look good

[15:05] nobody wants

[15:06] live footage

[15:07] from Queen

[15:08] they want the actual

[15:09] studio recordings

[15:10] and we're hearing

[15:11] this game apparently like they weren't allowed to do it okay they were forced to make the

[15:15] game this way by the band and by the management of queen but Brian may is friends with slash

[15:22] and when I saw this game that's the first thing I thought of is like slash is gonna call

[15:27] them up and be like dude what is with your pinball machine look at mine did you not even

[15:33] get involved are you even a fan of pinball and they're probably not Brian may probably

[15:37] doesn't care the way slash cares about the machine but that's the problem is like you

[15:41] can't launch this crap after guns and roses you can't there's no room for this kind of

[15:46] crap after guns and roses look it looks like a decent shooter it's a fan layout and there's

[15:51] a lot of stuff going on in the game but it just looks bad it looks unfinished it looks

[15:57] unpollished it looks bad and people are saying well it's a prototype it's a prototype

[16:03] is it really is it a prototype because this game has a flyer do you make flyers for the

[16:08] prototype of a game no this is their game if they make queen pinball next this is it like this

[16:15] is what they're gonna make and there's not gonna be drastic changes and there's not gonna be a

[16:19] whole new art package this is it why would they make a flyer saying this is queen pinball

[16:24] from pinball brothers the other thing is the marketing is atrocious like this is how you launch

[16:30] this game this band deserved so much better they do this band is so amazing like queen is

[16:38] incredible and for queen pinball to get this treatment by the pinball brothers and remember this

[16:43] is also the last game by the Andrew highway team this is not an all new game with like an

[16:51] all new design team this was Andrew highways next game after alien and it just goes to show

[16:58] that Andrew highway was never gonna be successful in pinball he also didn't have a good eye for

[17:04] this stuff he didn't remember when he held up the alien playfield and that was atrocious and

[17:10] it's like why is everybody else making gorgeous pinball machines and highway pinball was always

[17:15] making the excuse about well this is what the license holder wanted BS total BS they just don't

[17:22] have any taste they have no creative direction and it's showing in these games and they're just a

[17:26] joke right so we got all these amazing games coming out from C.G.C. from spooky from Jersey Jack

[17:32] pinball you've got all this stuff that's beautiful to look at that shoots amazing there's all these

[17:37] mechs now in Godzilla and then you've got games like queen games like spinal tap and there's just

[17:45] these games where it's like who wants this stuff like who's the target audience for this stuff you

[17:51] can't launch a game like this after guns and roses after Godzilla after willy Wonka you can't do

[17:59] it you can't do it and people are not gonna run to this stuff and they will have a problem selling

[18:05] it even if it's queen and I mean that all right all right everybody this has been part one of the

[18:10] boys are back in town part two is probably gonna be pretty short it's just gonna be me letting you
