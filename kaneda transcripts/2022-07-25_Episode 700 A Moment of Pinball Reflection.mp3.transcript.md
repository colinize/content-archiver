[00:00] After you'd used 700 shows about pinball, this song just starts to play in your head.

[00:08] I can see clearly now the rain is gone I can see all obstacles in my way

[00:20] CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR

[00:24] Wow, 700 canada's pinball podcast episodes.

[00:29] It's kind of crazy when I think about it all, when I close my eyes and I think about this

[00:33] journey of covering the pinball hobby after all of these years, right?

[00:38] Being banned from pinside, not being silenced, feeling like I still had something to say

[00:43] about this hobby we all love.

[00:45] I want to thank each and every one of you for your support over the years.

[00:49] It's meant the world to me and my family.

[00:51] It's been a creative outlet.

[00:53] I really can't imagine my life without this show because this show has really been the

[00:57] one thing I have total control over.

[01:00] And it's been a fun hobby.

[01:01] I've made my best friends in life through pinball.

[01:04] It's true.

[01:05] I mean, I have more consistent friendships because of the pinball hobby than I did make

[01:10] at work, than I've made growing up that I made in college.

[01:14] All of you are some crazy amazing people and I love the diversity in pinball.

[01:19] I love the conversation.

[01:21] I love the fact that no matter what happens in the world, that each and every one of us

[01:26] could find a little corner of the universe, sit down over a couple of beers or even a

[01:31] glass of water and just have a fun conversation about what's going on in pinball.

[01:37] It is such a unique device and it's really hard to tell people who are not into it why

[01:41] we love it so much.

[01:43] But in this digital world in which everyone is unhappy, getting more and more depressed,

[01:49] scrolling on their phones, looking at other people's lives, overly consumed with all of

[01:54] the tragic stuff happening in the world, even though if you look at historically speaking,

[01:59] it is the safest time to be alive in the history of the entire universe.

[02:04] But somehow we've been convinced everything is horrible, the countries are falling apart,

[02:09] our political systems have divided us and all of our kids are growing up with mental

[02:14] health issues.

[02:15] They don't know how to identify their genders.

[02:18] Everything is wrong in the world and yet here's this device.

[02:21] That's what?

[02:22] Like a hundred years old?

[02:23] It used to be outlawed.

[02:25] It was illegal.

[02:26] And now here we are in 2022, a world in which we are tempted with nothing but blockbuster

[02:32] three hour movies and streaming services and yet it is a physical steel ball bouncing

[02:39] around a piece of wood that cannot be replicated with anything digitally.

[02:45] You can't replicate the feeling and sensation of pinball with a screen.

[02:50] You can't do it with like virtual reality or some metaverse.

[02:53] You have to physically stand in front of the machine and I love it and I love the fact

[02:57] that we've got all these companies every year trying to show us the best they can do at

[03:03] creating magic in a world under glass.

[03:06] Now here's what I want to talk about on episode 700.

[03:08] I don't have some big interview.

[03:10] I tried to get Ben Heck on the show but he said if I came on your show, spooky pinball

[03:15] would kill me and I think he was being serious.

[03:18] And we know that most of the manufacturers don't really want to talk to me so I do what

[03:22] I do.

[03:23] I cover what's going on in pinball.

[03:24] Now I was thinking maybe I'd give you guys a little treat.

[03:26] Should I spoil something out there?

[03:28] Should I reveal something that you don't know is happening in pinball?

[03:31] And I have a little something and maybe I'll do it at the end of the show.

[03:34] It is the game that Marty Robbins is working on over at Haggis Pinball.

[03:38] Now I know you're all saying we don't care about that, Canada.

[03:41] We want to get Steve Ritchie's game at Jersey Jack Pinball and the reason why I haven't

[03:45] told you it yet is I need to get more confirmation on it because I'm a little bit skeptical about

[03:50] what I was told and I don't want to share it unless I feel better about the information

[03:55] I got.

[03:56] And yes, I will talk a little bit about the Godzilla Topper drama that happened yesterday

[04:01] on Facebook.

[04:02] You probably missed it.

[04:03] It wasn't a big deal, but now John is a little pissed off at me over at Jack Bar.

[04:08] You know, one of my greatest skill sets is just pissing people off.

[04:12] I have a real knack for it.

[04:13] Like if I could make money, if I could be paid to piss people off, I would be the richest

[04:18] man on this planet.

[04:20] Now you might be saying you're making money on your podcast and all it does is piss off

[04:23] everyone in the pinball world.

[04:25] I don't think so.

[04:26] I think people who listen to this show and if you've listened to this show for five,

[04:29] six years and you've heard and some people have heard all 700 episodes.

[04:33] You realize that it's just entertaining.

[04:36] It's as entertaining as the pinball machines themselves.

[04:39] But the theme of this show is my reflection on pinball and what I've learned about this

[04:43] hobby.

[04:44] And much like our lives in general, you go through different stages of how you interact

[04:49] with stuff.

[04:50] Your thoughts and your points of view on things can change over time.

[04:55] Like the pinball world has changed significantly over the last couple of years.

[04:59] We've seen a significant increase in price.

[05:02] We've seen a decrease in mechanical mechanisms being put into the games.

[05:07] We've seen an increase in the amount of companies that are trying to make it in the pinball

[05:11] world.

[05:12] We've seen a global pandemic that shut down supply chains so no new and box games were

[05:17] going out to distributors for almost like a year.

[05:20] We've seen a backlog of orders over at Stern Pinball that caused them to pause their assembly

[05:25] lines on new games and just make the old orders.

[05:29] We've seen a delay, right?

[05:30] We've never had delays from Stern Pinball and the entire time I've been covering this

[05:34] hobby there was never a delay.

[05:36] Like we kept getting new games every four months from Stern Pinball.

[05:39] We've seen the explosion of pinball media over the last five to six years.

[05:43] It's great for those of you out there.

[05:45] If you took a time machine six years earlier, there was only a handful of podcasts about

[05:51] pinball.

[05:52] There were very few YouTube channels.

[05:54] There were very few streamers.

[05:56] Now you are living in the golden age of pinball content creation.

[06:01] I mean there are so many shows to choose from and I just want to say to everyone out there

[06:05] who sets up a microphone and does a show about pinball, my hat is off to you.

[06:11] It is not easy.

[06:13] There are way more critics who know how to do it better than us but it is hard to fill

[06:18] dead air every week with a show talking about a toy in which maybe in a good year there

[06:26] is only six to seven days of legitimate news in pinball.

[06:31] The rest of it is us waiting, speculating and wondering what's around the corner and

[06:38] then every few months we get a new game and we talk about how much we love it or hate it

[06:43] and that is why I want to say thank you to all the content creators because I do feel

[06:48] like pinball content creators are some of the glue that keeps the community together.

[06:53] It's what makes you interested in pinball every week.

[06:57] I also want to say thank you to Pinside.

[06:59] Yes, as toxic as Pinside can be, without it how many of you would really, really be into

[07:05] pinball?

[07:06] How many of you would have found this community if it wasn't for Pinside?

[07:09] Now there are other places to go that are a lot more positive than Pinside like Facebook

[07:15] groups are better because people aren't anonymous but for the most part Pinside was the gateway

[07:21] drug that got a lot of us into our daily consumption of pinball content.

[07:26] And look, if it wasn't for Pinside banning me, there never would have been Canada's

[07:31] Pinball Podcast.

[07:32] I probably would still be listening to Nate Shivers and like Spooky Pinballs podcast and

[07:37] like John's Arcade and there was a few of those.

[07:39] In a weird way, my banning from Pinside was the creation of this show so I have to be

[07:44] somewhat thankful that they put my life on this direction.

[07:48] Now you could argue this was one of the worst directions to steer your life in Chris.

[07:52] Like what are you doing?

[07:53] Spending all of this time and all of these hours talking about pinball but I love it

[07:57] and I'm glad that you love it too and I enjoy doing the show.

[08:01] It's somewhat like therapy for me.

[08:03] So what have I learned about pinball over all of these years and what do I feel about

[08:06] pinball right now?

[08:08] Like in this moment, this Monday morning as I hit record, here are my thoughts on pinball

[08:13] and what I've learned.

[08:14] I've learned ultimately I know that this hobby is filled with very passionate people

[08:20] that love pinball a lot and they love it so much they're willing to spend in inordinate

[08:26] amounts of money on every new machine that comes out.

[08:30] But I also think that the market is going to get so soft so fast because I do think

[08:36] the hobby is now overpriced and I think the majority of people are feeling that and I

[08:43] don't blame the pinball companies for trying to find where the ceiling is but I think they've

[08:48] found it and even though some great games get flipped for more than they were new, I

[08:53] still don't think that a thousand LEs or a thousand collector's editions are rare in

[08:59] any sense of the word.

[09:01] When you zoom out a little bit, I don't think there are tens of thousands of people that

[09:05] want to buy pinball machines between 10 and 15 thousand dollars.

[09:10] It's going to be really hard even to find just a thousand people that will commit at

[09:15] those prices and the only way you're going to get those prices moving forward and this

[09:20] also goes for like the 12 thousand dollar LEs at Jersey Jack.

[09:24] The only way you're going to get those prices is if you deliver an amazing machine.

[09:28] There is absolutely no room for mediocrity anymore in pinball at these prices and we

[09:34] are all looking at all of these companies through a much more serious lens because this is serious

[09:41] money now.

[09:42] So we're no longer looking at a company like Spooky and saying, hey, like you're the little

[09:46] guy, I'll buy everything you make because we want to support you and see you stay in

[09:50] business for years to come because the truth is this, Spooky has been in business now for

[09:55] years to come.

[09:57] Charlie's probably put a few million dollars in his pocket which he's deserved.

[10:02] Make no mistake, Charlie Emory lived the American dream and deserves the success of his company

[10:09] and he's at a crossroads now and he's either going to hire the talent he needs to keep

[10:14] Spooky Pinball competitive at these prices or his company will fail and that's the truth

[10:20] with everybody, not just Spooky, it's the truth with Haggis.

[10:24] It's the truth with any pinball company that doesn't have ancillary income backing their

[10:30] company.

[10:31] Now there are companies that are just immune to the market forces.

[10:36] The Abbas family has so much money that nothing could tank Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:41] Amtron is funding American Pinball so they could stick around for a while.

[10:46] Chicago Gaming Company is funded by Churchill Cabinets so that is how they're allowed

[10:51] to take forever and a day to get new games out because it's not their annuity.

[10:55] The Pinball is more like a side business for the other millions of dollars coming in the

[11:00] door.

[11:01] So I've seen you guys, I've seen how much we all love pinball machines and I've seen

[11:05] the frenzy around every time a new pinball machine comes out.

[11:09] Here's what I also think is going to soften.

[11:12] I think a lot of people's enthusiasm for new and box games is going to really diminish.

[11:18] Not that we're not excited to see it but I think the majority of people are starting

[11:22] to be priced out of the hobby.

[11:25] It's at the point now where nobody wants three games to cost $30,000 or $45,000.

[11:33] It's just not there.

[11:34] Like the experience is just not there.

[11:37] Now look, each and every one of us, we put a personal price on stuff.

[11:43] Like we look at something like a Snoopy watch from Omega and some people look at that watch

[11:48] and they see the $6,000 watch that Omega charges people.

[11:52] Some people look at it and say it's rare, it takes two years to get one.

[11:57] If you want one today, I'll pay $30,000 for it even though it's a $6,000 watch.

[12:02] And I've been noticing this in different collectible communities like pinball and in watches and

[12:08] what people are paying over for cars is also ridiculous.

[12:11] It's why I sold our Honda Civic this weekend for $35,000 because it's three years old.

[12:18] It's got 8,000 miles on it, which is not a lot, but I paid $34,000 for it.

[12:22] I was able to drive the car for three years and get exactly what I paid for it in a car

[12:28] that's a Honda Civic and it didn't even diminish in value.

[12:31] The world is upside down right now and it's been a long period of people taking a lot

[12:36] of loans at one to two percent interest rates.

[12:40] And I think everyone's starting to feel like the world has been printing free money for

[12:45] way too long.

[12:46] We've all been spending money on stuff like this for way too long.

[12:50] And I think also there's going to be a period in pinball where a lot of us are just going

[12:54] to say, you know what?

[12:56] I'm content.

[12:57] How many more new games do we need to own before it's diminishing returns on our satisfaction?

[13:04] I was thinking about it this morning when I was thinking about this show.

[13:08] Like how many music pins do you need?

[13:10] How many pinball machines based on movies you like do you need?

[13:13] How many pinball machines based on comic book characters or superheroes do you need

[13:18] before you could actually just line up 10 amazing pinball machines and say, hey, look,

[13:24] we've got enough great pinball that covers a variety of themes with a variety of layouts

[13:31] and toys and experiences.

[13:33] Why do we need more?

[13:35] Now look, it's human nature to keep moving forward and to keep progressing.

[13:39] And that's the other thing I've been feeling about pinball lately is if we just keep making

[13:44] more pinball, is that a good thing?

[13:47] I think a lot of us want to see more innovation in pinball and progress in pinball.

[13:51] And what I mean by progress, it doesn't mean we have to completely change the game.

[13:56] No, I just mean like new experiences, new moments.

[14:00] And I want to see designers take more chances and take more risks.

[14:04] I want to see stuff like the UV kit in Stranger Things and creating the upside down world.

[14:10] That's a moment in that game.

[14:11] That's incredible.

[14:12] I want to see more stuff like a Godzilla building that goes up and down and changes the pathway

[14:17] of the ball.

[14:18] That's a moment in that pinball machine.

[14:20] I want to see more stuff like Guns N' Roses in which when you start a song, you're teleported

[14:25] to the concert and you feel like you're there.

[14:28] Like Live and Let Die took 40 hours to code people.

[14:32] I want to see more stuff like that.

[14:35] You know, and that's why pinball is so fun because every time they take a theme and they

[14:38] translate it into pinball, there's a golden opportunity to create more pinball moments

[14:44] that we're going to fall in love with.

[14:45] There's also just a limit to how many games you need before you're happy.

[14:51] There's a limit to how much room you have in your house.

[14:53] There's a limit to how much money you want to spend.

[14:56] And I just, when I play a pinball machine, I just don't see an experience that really

[15:02] should cost more than $10,000.

[15:05] And that's just my own personal opinion.

[15:07] But it's like I said with the Snoopy Omega, it's no longer about the material costs.

[15:13] It's about the emotional value of this machine for people.

[15:17] Like some people out there love Elvira and if they really want a 40th anniversary edition,

[15:22] they might spend $20,000 on it without blinking an eye because it makes them happy.

[15:27] And that's fine.

[15:28] Like that's all this is.

[15:30] These things are designed to just make us happy.

[15:32] And if they make you happy and you want it, sometimes you might have to spend more than

[15:37] the game originally costs and nothing I say is ever going to change that.

[15:41] And that takes place in every single collectible marketplace.

[15:44] But what I think is happening now in pinball is these manufacturers are getting greedy.

[15:48] And the greed is going to hurt them because it is greedy.

[15:53] Because when you lift the play field on some of these modern games, you are not seeing

[15:57] anywhere near, near the stuff under that play field that there should be under that

[16:03] play field if these games are going to cost $12,000, $13,000, $15,000, $20,000 for Elvira.

[16:14] You just don't see it.

[16:15] So then it's all about an emotional appeal because it's not like the physical value is

[16:20] there.

[16:21] It's not.

[16:22] The physical stuff is not there to warrant these prices.

[16:24] So my observation of how pinball has changed is I think these manufacturers are now guessing

[16:29] at what is the emotional value of these machines to you and I think they're about to overprice

[16:35] it.

[16:36] Because only dream themes can warrant a super high price.

[16:41] Like you're not going to be able to charge $12,500 for Venom.

[16:45] Like I don't think there's enough Venom fans to buy a thousand units at $12,000.

[16:52] There's definitely not enough Toy Story 4 fans to buy a thousand CEs at $15,000.

[16:59] And so now, right, it gets really interesting for someone like me because now in all of

[17:04] the years I've been covering pinball, in all of the years I've followed this hobby, there

[17:09] has never been a time in pinball where marketing mattered more than it does now.

[17:14] Now these companies really need to think about the marketing and the market research.

[17:20] Like marketing isn't just like the salesman side of it.

[17:23] It's also the research.

[17:25] It's also trying to figure out how much can I charge for this and still have demand.

[17:32] Like that's all a marketing decision.

[17:34] And Jersey Jack got the marketing all wrong on Toy Story.

[17:37] It was a perfect storm of like mistakes for them.

[17:40] They got the wrong title.

[17:42] They got the wrong mechs.

[17:44] They got the wrong toys.

[17:46] They got the wrong price.

[17:47] They got the wrong volume.

[17:49] And they packaged it all together in a beautiful, colorful game, but it's just not what people

[17:55] want.

[17:56] And so why do you think Jersey Jack is sending out a survey right after they launched Toy

[18:01] Story?

[18:02] They're obviously trying to figure out what we want.

[18:06] Now it's a little day late and dollar short with Toy Story 4, but at least they're trying

[18:11] to understand what we want.

[18:13] The only thing that wasn't in that survey that was interesting is they didn't ask you

[18:18] how much would you want to spend on a pinball machine.

[18:21] And I think what Jersey Jack needs to do is more of a private focus group and get people

[18:26] together of different economic backgrounds and really understand where the market is.

[18:33] I think the thing that's hurting all these pinball companies is they just charge the

[18:36] same thing for every game.

[18:38] Like once they raise their prices on machines, like every Stern LE is now going to cost like

[18:43] what, 11.5?

[18:45] Jersey Jack LE is going to be 12,000 or 15,000 for the CE.

[18:49] I don't think you can do it like that.

[18:51] These aren't movie tickets.

[18:53] Like these aren't video games.

[18:55] These are physical things that have different levels of craftsmanship in them.

[18:59] And I think they need to look at this more like a watch.

[19:02] I do.

[19:03] I think if there's more materials in this game, charge more for it.

[19:07] If it took longer to make this game, charge more for it.

[19:10] If the theme is more expensive, charge more for it.

[19:14] But you can't charge me the same amount of money, regardless of what's in it.

[19:19] And that's the main thing I've noticed in 2022 is we're all starting to ask about every

[19:24] single new game now is the value there.

[19:28] And if the value is not there, people are going to close up their wallets real fast.

[19:33] Now the problem with pinball is if you have a miss now, right?

[19:37] If you put out a game into the market and it's a miss and the sales are slow, you can't

[19:42] quickly pivot and get another game on the line.

[19:46] Only stern pinball can really do that.

[19:48] Like they could have a miss and then just rerun a game they know people love.

[19:52] You can't really do that at Jersey Jack.

[19:54] American pinball can't do that because they haven't even had a game people love.

[19:58] Like it's a really difficult time.

[20:00] Spooky pinball couldn't do that.

[20:02] The only game they could rerun is TNA, which is what they're going to do.

[20:06] But they don't have a portfolio of in-demand games and stupidly for them.

[20:11] And this was a stupid decision.

[20:12] It was a marketing decision when they said they were only going to make 750 Rican Mortys.

[20:18] I mean, don't you think Chuck right now would love to do another run of like 1500 Rican

[20:25] Mortys, which he could easily sell because people would much rather have that game than

[20:31] Halloween or Ultraman.

[20:33] But he can't do it because he made a marketing decision to limit the number of them because

[20:38] they were trying to create FOMO and they did and it worked and it sold out in just a couple

[20:43] hours.

[20:44] But I think a lot of these companies are learning.

[20:46] It's not about winning the sprint.

[20:48] It's about winning the marathon.

[20:50] And that's what stern wins.

[20:52] They win both the sprint and the marathon, but it's much smarter to be able to make money

[20:57] on a game over five years than to just sell out in five minutes.

[21:03] And that's it.

[21:04] You can never make the game again because you put in arbitrary limit on the game.

[21:08] I think the market research these companies do is going to be super important for them

[21:12] to nail it and get it right at these prices.

[21:15] The other thing that's changed in BIMO now, and I'm just going to say this like scalping

[21:19] and flipping machines for money, it's now going to come with a lot more risk.

[21:24] And this was coming all along.

[21:26] And you almost needed it to come with a risk.

[21:27] And I'm the worst offender of this.

[21:29] I'm just going to fall on my own sword and I'm going to take the arrows I deserve.

[21:33] I was one of these scalpers.

[21:35] I was a guy that would get on multiple LE lists and I would simply get a game to sell

[21:41] it to make money.

[21:43] You know why I did it?

[21:44] Because there was no risk in losing money because I could read the market.

[21:49] The deposits on stern games were refundable.

[21:51] I didn't even have to give a deposit.

[21:53] There was no non-refundable deposits.

[21:55] I could just get on a list, get a game, realize that more people wanted Ghostbusters or Batman

[22:01] than there were games available, and then sell it for a few thousand dollars money in

[22:05] my pocket.

[22:06] Everybody wins.

[22:07] But those days are over now.

[22:08] Now that the deposits are non-refundable and the deposits are $2,000 or $2,500, if you

[22:15] speculate and lose, you're going to lose that deposit.

[22:19] And you're going to lose $2,000.

[22:21] I lost $2,000 on Ultraman.

[22:23] Toy Story was revealed and you had a chance to see it and a distributor asked you for

[22:29] a deposit.

[22:30] After you saw it, you are committing to that game in that moment.

[22:35] Like the 100 people who bought directly from Jersey Jack Pinball in like three minutes,

[22:40] it's sold out on the site, those people are committed to buying that collector's edition.

[22:44] And look, everyone knows the reality now.

[22:47] The demand is not there.

[22:49] They are already selling for below MSRP.

[22:53] The LE and the CE have already lost money before the games have been made.

[23:00] We saw the same thing happen with Halloween.

[23:02] It's just happening a lot faster this time because the games are so expensive.

[23:07] And if you put out $2,500 for a Toy Story CE and you know you don't really want it now

[23:13] and you know there's no money to be made, well, you're going to sell your deposit spot

[23:17] for probably at least $500 to $1,000 less than you spent on it.

[23:24] And then this creates the problem, right?

[23:25] Because imagine if you want the game, well then wouldn't you want to just buy it for

[23:29] cheaper and buy someone's spot who doesn't want it?

[23:33] This is what happens when you get the market wrong.

[23:36] If this game was great and people really wanted it, we wouldn't have this problem, but it's

[23:40] not a game where the demand is there.

[23:43] And now the market is speaking and every single flipper is going to lose money on this machine.

[23:48] And then it's not fun, right?

[23:50] It used to be fun to flip pinball machines a few years ago in which you could easily pocket

[23:54] a few thousand dollars.

[23:56] This is not fun.

[23:57] You lose money.

[23:58] You are basically setting your money on fire if you run in on these nonrefundable deposits.

[24:04] And look, I go back and forth on this.

[24:06] Is it a good thing if we have scalping?

[24:07] Is it a bad thing?

[24:08] You're never going to stop it, but it's definitely over.

[24:12] But the days are over.

[24:13] You can't do it anymore.

[24:15] Even these stern games, I don't know, a thousand of them?

[24:19] And I'm seeing games just sit.

[24:21] I'm seeing games sit on the second hand market.

[24:24] And once they start making a ton of Godzilla premiums, people are not going to be spending

[24:29] 16,000 on the LE or 18,000 on the LE.

[24:32] You're going to see the LE slide back down because everyone is having the same exact

[24:37] experience.

[24:38] It's the same game.

[24:39] And that's my other takeaway from pinball in general, is I think the FOMO and the anxiety

[24:46] to have the best version of the game, I think that's wearing off because I think the flex

[24:51] is gone.

[24:52] It was all about the flex.

[24:53] It was about, hey, look, I got one.

[24:55] It was hard to get.

[24:56] I got one.

[24:57] Those days are over.

[24:58] And you could argue on a philosophical level that that's a good thing, that this is going

[25:02] to force everybody to go back to just enjoying the machine and buying a machine you know

[25:07] you love.

[25:08] You remove the flex and you remove the vanity of it all.

[25:11] Then all of a sudden you're not chasing after these super high end versions of the game,

[25:15] especially because you can have the same exact gameplay experience with every single premium.

[25:22] Like there is no reason to buy Toy Story Collector's Edition.

[25:25] There's absolutely no reason to spend $3,000 more.

[25:30] The LE plays just fine.

[25:33] In fact, it plays exactly the same.

[25:36] And once you put inner art blades into the LE, no one's even going to feel like they

[25:40] have the second fiddle game.

[25:42] And so even this like three tiered model might start to get really soft.

[25:45] And again, like I'm not sure it's going to go that way, but I do think you're going to

[25:49] see less and less people obsessing over the version that's the flex because I think flexing

[25:56] with your pinball collection was so like three, four years ago.

[25:59] And I think it's getting to the point too where like people just don't care anymore.

[26:02] They don't care because the market is oversaturated.

[26:05] It would be different if there were fewer games, but there's just too many games.

[26:10] And I think all of this, right?

[26:11] We're all on this journey in our own personal lives.

[26:14] Like how many toys do I need?

[26:16] How many cars do I need?

[26:17] How many watches do I need?

[26:18] How many houses do I need?

[26:20] You know, for some of us, the questions become bigger based upon how much money we have,

[26:24] but it ultimately boils down to this in life.

[26:27] All of this stuff is meant to just cure some of the carnal boredom of life.

[26:34] If you really think about it, like all of us on some level get bored.

[26:39] We get bored with stuff.

[26:40] We get bored with how to fill the time.

[26:42] And when you're bored, you usher in stuff that cures you from the boredom, but everything

[26:47] has a cost.

[26:48] Like some stuff costs you time.

[26:50] Like you could sit on your couch and watch Netflix shows all day long, but the cost of

[26:54] that is the time you could spend doing other stuff and making yourself a better person.

[27:00] You could eat delicious fast food every day and feel like you're getting a great meal

[27:04] at a great cost.

[27:05] But that comes at the cost of your health.

[27:07] You're not going to look good.

[27:08] You're not going to feel good.

[27:10] You're not going to be the best version of you.

[27:12] You know, and so like same is true with pinball.

[27:14] Like you could have 10 pinball machines and be happy.

[27:17] You could have one machine and be happy.

[27:19] You could have no machines and be happy.

[27:20] You could just go to your local operator and support them every week and be happy.

[27:25] Everyone has a different agenda, right?

[27:27] It's like the distributors, their agenda is to sell you games.

[27:30] The manufacturer's agenda is to sell you games.

[27:32] My agenda is to just entertain you.

[27:35] Your agenda in life, only you know your agenda.

[27:38] Only you know what you need to do to be truly happy, to be the best version of yourself,

[27:45] to be the best version for your partner and for your kids.

[27:49] Only you know what it takes.

[27:50] But I can tell you this in no manual in life, you will never find anyone who's become enlightened

[27:57] and the best version of themselves.

[28:00] Nobody will ever say the pathway to true happiness is to fill your life with stuff.

[28:05] And as I get older, I see this more and more.

[28:08] Like I don't want more work all the time.

[28:10] I don't want more pressures.

[28:13] I don't want more things to worry about.

[28:15] Like I was happy when I sold the Honda.

[28:18] One less thing to worry about.

[28:20] Now pinball machines don't really make you worry and for many of you rich collectors

[28:23] out there, you don't even play your machines that much.

[28:25] That's why they never break down.

[28:27] But most of these machines for the most part are pretty bulletproof and that's a good thing.

[28:30] But I think everyone's going through that journey and I think coming out of COVID, I

[28:34] think all of us have reevaluated our lives in a lot of different ways.

[28:39] And for me, just personally for me, if I just have two to three really awesome pinball machines

[28:45] in my home, I will be happy.

[28:47] I will stop there.

[28:49] I won't keep chasing machines.

[28:52] I don't think there's more happiness to be had if I keep buying these things.

[28:57] And again, I had a lot of fun flipping and scalping machines, but those days are over.

[29:01] I'm priced out.

[29:02] I can't do it.

[29:03] I'm not losing money anymore and there's not really much money to be made on the flips

[29:06] anymore.

[29:07] I don't know about you, but I also think about it like this.

[29:10] Like what's another $3,000 to $5,000 going to do for my life?

[29:14] Like absolutely nothing.

[29:16] It's nice to have, sure.

[29:18] But it's absolutely going to change nothing.

[29:21] It's not going to change what I get Brenda for her birthday.

[29:24] It's not going to change what vacations I can take.

[29:26] It's not going to change my job.

[29:28] It's not going to change my physique.

[29:29] It's going to change nothing.

[29:31] It's just going to add a few more numbers into my checking account, which seems embarrassingly

[29:36] low considering how expensive everything is in the world today.

[29:40] Sure I could give it to my financial advisor on our plan for my retirement, but even that

[29:44] makes me sad.

[29:45] Even though I'm very responsible how much I contribute to my retirement every month,

[29:50] it's just like this weird thing of like planning for your life to end, which isn't really that

[29:54] much fun either.

[29:56] So that's my personal journey, a few great machines, and I will enjoy doing this podcast

[30:01] for hopefully another six to seven years.

[30:04] Like I'll be an old man yelling about the pinball games.

[30:06] Can you imagine me still arguing about pinball machines over the next five years?

[30:10] We'll see.

[30:11] I mean, I'm not burnt out.

[30:12] I'm really not burnt out.

[30:13] I do want to like try to minimize the drama this hobby can bring.

[30:17] I know I create some of that drama.

[30:19] So long story short about what happened at Jack Bar yesterday, and then I'm going to

[30:22] leave you with what Marty Robbins' game is over at Haggis Pinball.

[30:26] So yesterday I've got like serious cabin fever.

[30:29] We were inside all day long.

[30:31] The temperature is too hot to bring killing outside.

[30:33] And I was just getting antsy.

[30:34] I'm like, I just want to go play some pinball.

[30:36] And Bren is like, cool.

[30:37] Yeah.

[30:38] So I take the subway to Jack Bar.

[30:39] I walk in, John is there, and like there's not many people in there.

[30:43] There's like four to five people in there.

[30:45] And I see a topper on top of Godzilla.

[30:47] And I'm like, wow, like that's a really cool topper.

[30:50] It looks just like Zambietti's artwork.

[30:52] Is that the official topper from Stern Pinball?

[30:55] And John said, no, it isn't.

[30:57] And I said, okay, I'm going to share it.

[30:58] And he's like, well, can you wait to Tuesday because there's going to be a big reveal?

[31:01] I did not say John, I won't share this.

[31:03] I was like, come on, man, this is what I, the topper is on top of a machine in a bar that

[31:08] anyone can walk into.

[31:10] And this is what I do.

[31:11] Like this is what Canadian Pinball podcast does.

[31:13] I share what's going on.

[31:15] And this is where like I have to be objective.

[31:17] I don't do like NDAs.

[31:18] I don't hold things back.

[31:19] Like I share what I see when I see it.

[31:22] And so that's where we left it.

[31:24] And then I shared it and he got mad at me.

[31:26] He's like, I can't believe it.

[31:27] I asked you not to share it.

[31:29] And I hope John forgives me.

[31:31] I said I was sorry this morning.

[31:32] I took down the content.

[31:33] Here's why I took down the content because it's not a hill I want to die on, not with

[31:37] our friendship.

[31:38] And yeah, I probably shouldn't have shared it after he said, don't share it, but he

[31:42] also probably shouldn't have put it up on top of the machine if the guy didn't want

[31:45] it revealed until Tuesday.

[31:47] So I think we both were wrong and we'll talk it out and we'll figure out our differences.

[31:51] But here's the thing too, the topper itself is illegal.

[31:55] Like this isn't an official stern topper and it's basically copying Zambietti's artwork

[32:01] and Zambietti himself chimed in and said, that's not the official topper.

[32:06] That's kind of stealing my artwork.

[32:07] The official one will be coming out soon.

[32:10] Okay.

[32:11] So then this guy who's waiting for his big reveal who did all this hard work on the

[32:14] topper and don't get me wrong, the topper looks great, but it doesn't matter how much

[32:18] hard work you do on something if you're not allowed to release it.

[32:22] It's called stealing the IP that Stern paid good money for.

[32:26] It's not just the stealing of the IP.

[32:28] That's the problem.

[32:29] He's hijacking Zambietti's artwork.

[32:31] I mean, it's basically like the same artwork being reused on the topper.

[32:36] Like you got to know if you're going to do something on an IP, you got to know what the

[32:40] line is if you're making a mod for something that has an IP.

[32:44] We saw the same thing happen with guns and roses.

[32:46] Remember when that game came out and everyone started to launch toppers that had the guns

[32:49] and roses logo all over it?

[32:51] And it's like, no, you can't do that.

[32:52] Remember when Batman elite came out and someone was able to recreate the Batman topper, right?

[32:57] With them in the Batmobile.

[32:58] They couldn't sell it.

[32:59] They couldn't make it.

[33:00] You can't do that.

[33:01] You can't steal the IP.

[33:03] So that happened yesterday and it kind of bummed me out and I'm like, I always find

[33:07] ways to like make myself feel bad about Pimball every once in a while.

[33:12] Usually involves a few drinks.

[33:13] It usually involves me doing something on Facebook or Facebook Live.

[33:17] And so I took it down because I don't want John to be upset at me and I hope he accepts

[33:20] my apology.

[33:22] But the real culprit in all of this is not John.

[33:24] It's not me.

[33:25] It's the guy who made the topper.

[33:26] That's illegal.

[33:27] If that illegal topper was never made, John and I never have this dispute.

[33:32] It's funny the way the universe works.

[33:34] So let me end episode 700 by telling you the game that I'm hearing Marty Robbins is working

[33:39] on.

[33:40] Now, why am I revealing this?

[33:41] When you're like, Chris, they need to make Centaur next.

[33:44] This game is a while away.

[33:45] Well, I'll tell you why I'm going to reveal it because I release rumors when I hear them.

[33:50] And I also just want to say this.

[33:51] I was something rub me the wrong way.

[33:53] And I'm going to tell you what rub me the wrong way.

[33:54] I was listening to Marty and Jeff talk on their show about how they knew it was Toy Story

[33:59] 4 before everybody else did.

[34:01] And Jeff was saying specifically how he knew 10 games that are coming out down the line

[34:07] and how he's signed NDAs and he knows what's coming out in Pimbal.

[34:13] And that's fine.

[34:14] You know, Jeff has relationships with all those manufacturers and they can share stuff

[34:17] with him and they can trust him.

[34:18] But I also don't like the fact that certain people get to know that information and you

[34:23] don't.

[34:24] I don't think this information should be secretive.

[34:27] I think this information sure it benefits the manufacturers so they can create that one

[34:31] day of FOMO when they do the reveal.

[34:34] But I also don't like the fact that there is a circle of people in this community and

[34:38] they're not manufacturers.

[34:40] They don't work for the manufacturers, but they know everything.

[34:44] And those people are able to make decisions based on that knowledge.

[34:49] But this is what Canada does.

[34:50] It's what I've been doing for years is I tell you stuff when I hear it.

[34:53] Now this is a rumor.

[34:54] This is a rumor that this is the game Marty Robbins is working on over at Haggis Pimbal.

[35:00] There is a whitewood for it.

[35:02] Now this is a smart choice by Marty because even though he's doing an original game, it

[35:07] is not an original IP.

[35:09] It is an IP that is now in the public domain.

[35:13] And that's a smart thing to do.

[35:15] Like Sherlock Holmes is public domain.

[35:18] Like you can make Houdini because it's public domain.

[35:22] What's not smart is to make galactic tank force or galactic space force because there's no

[35:28] emotional connection to that whatsoever.

[35:31] I think it is smart to take something that people know, that they recognize, that has

[35:35] some sort of historical prominence and then make a Pimbal machine based on it.

[35:41] Okay, so what is it?

[35:42] You know what?

[35:43] I can tell you what it is with an audio file.

[35:45] And then you'll be able to know exactly what it is.

[35:47] Now I'm not sure if he's using this, but the good news is this for them.

[35:51] This is also public domain.

[35:54] So this game can use this audio file and use this radio address in the game because it

[36:00] is now public domain.

[36:02] Anyone can use it for their entertainment purposes.

[36:06] Everybody, thank you so much for your support over all of these years.

[36:09] I know this was just more of like a discussion and a reflection episode.

[36:13] I will get back to covering what's happening with each company, but it's a milestone for

[36:17] me and I just want to share what's going on inside my head as I reflect on doing a Pimbal

[36:23] podcast all of these years.

[36:25] Thank you so much.

[36:26] Have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.

[36:28] Ladies and gentlemen, here I am, back of a stone wall that joins Mr. Wilma's garden.

[36:35] From here I get a sweep of the whole scene.

[36:37] I'll give you every detail as long as I can talk and as long as I can see.

[36:41] More state police have arrived.

[36:42] They're drawing up a cordon in front of the pit.

[36:45] About 30 of them.

[36:47] No need to push the crowd back now.

[36:49] They're willing to keep their distance.

[36:51] The captain's conferring with someone.

[36:53] Can't quite see who.

[36:54] I guess.

[36:55] I believe it's Professor Pearson.

[36:56] Yes, it is.

[36:57] Now they've parted and the professor moves around one side, studying the object while

[37:02] the captain and two policemen advance with something in their hands.

[37:05] I can see it now.

[37:06] It's a white hex if tied to a pole.

[37:09] Like a truce.

[37:10] Those preachers know what that means.

[37:12] What anything means.

[37:13] Wait a minute.

[37:14] Something's happening.

[37:15] Humped shape is rising out of the pit.

[37:19] They make out a small beam of light against a mirror.

[37:23] What's that?

[37:24] It's a jet of flame springing from the mirror and at least right at the advancing men.

[37:29] It strikes them head on.

[37:30] Lord, they're turning into flames.

[37:31] Now the whole field's qualified.

[37:32] The woods are barred.

[37:33] They're gas tanks.

[37:34] Tanks with the automobile spreading everywhere.

[37:35] Coming this way now.

[37:36] About 20 yards to my right.

[37:37] Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue

[37:51] the broadcast from Grover's Mill.

[37:53] Evidently, there's some difficulty with our field transmission.

[37:56] However, we will return to that point at the earliest opportunity.

[38:00] In the meantime, we have a late bulletin from San Diego, California.

[38:04] Senator Indelkoffer, speaking at a dinner of the California Astronomical Society, expressed

[38:09] the opinion that the explosions on Mars are undoubtedly nothing more than severe volcanic

[38:14] disturbances on the surface of the planet.

[38:18] We continue now with our piano interlude.
