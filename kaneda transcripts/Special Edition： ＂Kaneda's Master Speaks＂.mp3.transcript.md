[00:00] What is thy bidding, my master?

[00:17] There is only one reason that I'm still in this hobby, and there's only one reason why

[00:23] I sort of stick around, and that is because of some of the amazing people in the hobby.

[00:29] The actual machines themselves, the wood and the lights and the silver ball, I could give

[00:35] two shits about it most of the time.

[00:37] What I enjoy is that that machine itself is a catalyst for good times with cool people,

[00:43] and that's pretty much it.

[00:44] I don't really care.

[00:46] Otherwise, I really don't.

[00:47] It's an inanimate object that gets talked about way too much.

[00:51] But over the years, I developed a friendship with an individual that has really inspired

[00:57] me, has really mentored me in how to think about this hobby and how to approach it properly.

[01:06] We've developed a friendship.

[01:08] This individual is someone that I hold with the highest regard, and I do feel like his

[01:13] pate of wang in a lot of ways, because the way he sees it, the way he thinks about this

[01:18] hobby is truly incredible.

[01:21] He's not someone who's running his mouth on pin sight all day long saying stupid shit.

[01:27] He's quiet, he's in the corner, but I think one day he may not be in such a shadowy corner.

[01:35] I'll just say that, but I do consider him to be one of the smartest individuals out there,

[01:42] especially when it comes to this hobby.

[01:45] I've always asked this individual to be able to share some of his insights and his thoughts

[01:50] on this hobby, because we communicate back and forth all the time.

[01:56] Whether it's late night, G-chats, whether it's through email, whether it's through text

[02:00] messages, him and I have always had a great banter back and forth, and I've always loved

[02:05] reading his take on things.

[02:07] And finally, he's allowed me to share his insights and point of view with my listeners.

[02:14] I think you guys are going to get a kick out of this.

[02:17] I'm going to do a fun little thing every time we have something of interest to share with

[02:21] you.

[02:22] Those of you out there who think this is my thoughts, my opinions, they are not.

[02:27] I swear to you they are not.

[02:30] So without further ado, I want to reveal to all of you a little insight from a shadowy

[02:38] figure who is Kaneda's master.

[02:43] Enjoy.

[02:45] You still have a lot to learn, Kaneda, about the ways of pinball.

[02:52] Listen to me now and learn the truth of this hobby.

[02:59] Stern is thinking each big bang bar sold for 25 to 30 thousand dollars.

[03:09] They did not.

[03:12] They sold for what?

[03:15] $4,500.

[03:18] It is an illusion.

[03:21] They are trying to get from point A to point B without waiting to see how the game turns

[03:30] out or waiting for the title to mature.

[03:34] Here is why they are going very wrong.

[03:39] One game is not consistently awesome.

[03:45] For every sell out there is another dog that people lose money on their L's.

[03:53] Avengers.

[03:56] WWE, X-Men, Avatar, Transformers and Kiss.

[04:06] Just a name of you.

[04:10] The idea that Stern knows it has a blockbuster on its hands is laughable.

[04:20] And remember that K-Pow designed it with Stern too.

[04:27] God knows what this game will be like.

[04:31] Don't get me wrong, Kaneda.

[04:35] They are going to pull out some stops.

[04:39] Not all the stops because Stern is cheap as fuck.

[04:46] I think it is safe to say that the game will be very fucking cool.

[04:54] But it will just be another Stern.

[05:00] Crapi-vinyl decals and play feel printing.

[05:06] It will have an LCD but who knows what that will be.

[05:13] From Stern's point of view, they just wanted to build a low run game.

[05:22] Like you said, Kaneda, a special collector only game.

[05:29] They just went about it really weird.

[05:34] Bios remorse at $10,000 is fucking dangerous.

[05:44] Let's look at another high end product category.

[05:49] Shall we say speakers?

[05:53] In the speaker industry, there was always this clear cut path to upgrade.

[06:02] The NW for example always has their entry, mid level and high end.

[06:11] Entry level has just taste of what the big speakers have.

[06:18] But only features a single bookshelf and floor standing option.

[06:25] Boxes are plain black with molded plastic front.

[06:30] The mid level speakers might grab a tweeter from their high end brother.

[06:37] The cabinets get a little bit sexy, veneer, a piano glass finish with metal trim.

[06:46] This series features some larger floor standards and larger sub options.

[06:53] The high end is a version of their matrix not only stuff with the high end tweeter.

[07:03] Cabinets are curved, drivers are separated into separate sub enclosures.

[07:11] They offer a huge reference floor standing pair and lots of options.

[07:19] And of course they always have a flagship reference not a speaker above it all to tie

[07:26] the lines together.

[07:30] Stern is trying to sell their mid level product at three highest price brackets.

[07:41] They are shoving their mid level product into a flagship cabinet.

[07:49] This really weird thing to do.

[07:53] How it isn't even mid level, it's an entry level game.

[08:01] They are just changing the names.

[08:05] When all three machines play the same, the premium, the alley and the super alley, it's

[08:13] going to fuck with people's heads.

[08:18] This market has been fucked with enough.

[08:22] Stern doesn't care.

[08:25] For Kaneda, they want what every boutique competitor got who never even delivered.

[08:35] Look, Kaneda, this premium alley shit, it does work.

[08:43] It works really well or they would never do it.

[08:49] But what started out with great intentions has turned into a monster.

[08:56] Transstandard and LE, a basic game coupled with a true LE.

[09:07] Rear-end for the ops and limited for the collectors.

[09:13] Real limited run and real differences.

[09:18] The price difference was what, Kaneda, 1500?

[09:24] At that time people probably bitched endlessly about the price difference.

[09:33] The leaf the idea was sound and it made sense.

[09:39] Then one day they ran out of LEDs and started making premiums.

[09:47] This was the moment that he announced to the world that the home market had taken over.

[09:58] Premiums, Kaneda.

[10:00] They are not going to let sale slip through their fingers.

[10:05] So they added a premium to supplement the LE's.

[10:12] Hell, they sometimes add a second alley like back and back.

[10:18] And Lucy, again, the home market has taken over.

[10:25] Here is your proof, everybody.

[10:29] They kept the whole home market thing to themselves.

[10:35] Why you may ask?

[10:39] Because information you pin-side is power.

[10:45] Whenever anybody quotes how many games sell and to whom, they always quote Gary Stern.

[10:56] He controls that information.

[11:01] He is the trafficker.

[11:04] He is the morovinjian of pinball.

[11:12] Because if you tell all of your competitors that the majority of games are operator sales,

[11:21] they won't pay attention to how many premiums you are selling.

[11:28] And they will trick their competitors into thinking that 50% goes overseas.

[11:36] 50% stays here less than half are collector sales.

[11:43] So only 20% of their games are going to US home collectors.

[11:51] Bullshit, I say.

[11:55] Pure genius, Gary Stern.

[11:59] But Bullshit.

[12:02] Home collectors are everything now and have been for a long time.

[12:09] But Gary was smart enough to never give that away.

[12:14] The man plays dumb really well.

[12:18] Jersey Jack Pinball on the contrary blabs everything online.

[12:26] Every ticket, every fact, and sales number.

[12:31] We all know he has sold more than 3,000 was machines.

[12:39] Bops aren't buying 9,000 dollar machines to put on route.

[12:45] Yes, there are small number on route, but they are always in really high-end pin places.

[12:55] You won't find a was at a pizza place in a million years.

[13:03] Gary also realized that he doesn't make as much selling to operators.

[13:09] They don't pay as much and they constantly break their shit.

[13:15] Home guys pay a lot more for the same games and their games never break.

[13:23] Operators need like 5 to 10,000 plays to break even.

[13:30] Home guys don't break 50 plays before they sell it.

[13:35] I mean of course he is catering to the home collectors.

[13:39] Why?

[13:41] We all would.

[13:44] Somehow in that transition something got lost and fucked up.

[13:50] Now these tears ruin people's enjoyment of the games and the hobby.

[13:57] Three choices for the same game is fucking stupid.

[14:03] Have you ever seen the coin count on those big fancy driving games that Dave and Busters?

[14:11] It is not uncommon to have 250 to 500,000 plays on them.

[14:20] That is at like 2 to 3 dollars a play.

[14:24] That is bananas.

[14:27] The whole operator market has completely moved away from pinball because it is no longer

[14:34] for casuals.

[14:36] I played the walking dead for like 7 to 8 minutes the other day on one credit.

[14:42] I got an extra ball because I knew to shoot for the lit inserts and how to select modes.

[14:50] People don't fucking get this.

[14:54] They have no idea what the fuck to do and your first pinball game is going to suck because

[15:00] you will suck.

[15:03] The guy after me drain 3 balls down the left outline in 2 minutes because that is what

[15:11] the walking dead does.

[15:14] But play a Lamborghini racing game and you will know perfectly well how to drive.

[15:22] So at least you feel like you have a shot.

[15:26] So as the games get more complicated they become even less appealing for operators.

[15:34] Fruit Ninja will destroy any stern game on route.

[15:41] It is a joke, doodle jump, whatever games need to be simple and fun.

[15:49] Pinball may be fun but it sure as fuck a simple not by a long shot.

[15:58] Gary should have started a second company inside of stern to make boutiques.

[16:06] Stern platinum.

[16:08] Stern ultra.

[16:10] Stern whatever.

[16:13] Prior to guys to let design and make those games make them different and price them through

[16:22] the roof canada.

[16:26] Instead he is watering down everything and making a mockery of collectors.

[16:32] Who the fuck wants to show $10,000 and feel slighted.

[16:41] They are paying more than he has ever paid for any pinball machine ever made.

[16:48] Gary is not stupid to milk the market.

[16:53] I just wonder if this game won't have serious consequences for everybody including stern

[17:02] itself.

[17:04] I predict a huge failure.

[17:09] Batman 66.

[17:12] It's old.

[17:14] They can make it awesome and they will but it's in odd theme choice for sure.

[17:22] And that $15,000 game has shot the other models right in the foot.

[17:31] I think the fact that you could grab a pair of Elise is a big deal canada.

[17:38] Our wars has been sold out for ages.

[17:42] People were fighting over Ghostbusters Elise.

[17:46] Available Batman Elise not a good sign.

[17:50] Not at all.

[17:54] More to write but gotta get a burly.

[17:57] Talk to you later bro.

[17:59] Your nest.
