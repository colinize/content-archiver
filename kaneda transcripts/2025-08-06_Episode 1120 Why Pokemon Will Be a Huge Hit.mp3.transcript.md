[00:00] Alright, well that's not exactly the Star Wars theme song that's gonna get most of you

[00:26] pinheads going, but the Pokemon debate rages on.

[00:32] On this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, let's ask ourselves, do we think the world's

[00:38] biggest IP, Pokemon, will be successful in the world of pinball?

[00:45] Now before we get into this, because it's an interesting topic, nobody knows yet.

[00:50] Nobody knows.

[00:51] There hasn't been a Pokemon machine yet.

[00:54] We've seen some major, major themes really fall flat like Avatar, but there's a big difference.

[01:04] And the reason why I think there's a big difference between a billion dollar franchise like Avatar

[01:10] and Pokemon is Pokemon has the most valuable thing.

[01:16] And the most valuable thing that usually translates into sales is a really enthusiastic

[01:24] and engaged community.

[01:26] And it's spanned like 20 something plus years of Pokemon fanatics.

[01:32] I feel like Pokemon's been around for almost 30 years.

[01:35] So let's look at some statistics, because I think in the world of pinball, you get a

[01:39] lot of people screaming at the clouds, people that are always very angry.

[01:46] Now look, most of you I think are more around my age.

[01:50] The things we want are the things we grew up with.

[01:54] That's what we gravitate towards.

[01:56] You give us any popular theme that Gen X loves and we are going to like perk up.

[02:04] We're going to be like, yeah, that's a great theme for pinball.

[02:07] Beetlejuice, Goonies, Karate Kid, Top Gun, Total Recall, Running Man, you know, Fifth

[02:14] Element, Matrix.

[02:15] Like these are things the 80s and the 90s really hit us in a great way.

[02:21] Now what's interesting about Pokemon is it came out in 1996.

[02:27] That's when I was a freshman in college.

[02:30] That's when Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, I think both passed away 1996, you know, and

[02:38] when 96 rolled around, we were listening to like Poc.

[02:43] We weren't into Pokemon.

[02:45] And so we didn't grow up with Pokemon in those formidable years in which we geeked out over

[02:51] stuff like this.

[02:53] It was like a new generation's Transformers, a new generation's G.I.

[02:58] Joe, but there's no denying the fact that Pokemon is incredibly popular and has had

[03:05] a huge cultural impact.

[03:08] So in terms of commercial dominance, Pokemon is the highest grossing media franchise of

[03:14] all time, with total revenues exceeding 100 billion across games, trading cards, merchandise,

[03:25] anime and movies.

[03:27] This surpasses even Disney's Mickey Mouse franchise and other entertainment giants.

[03:33] The global gaming phenomenon around Pokemon, the original Pokemon Red and Blue games sold

[03:40] over 31 million copies worldwide, making them among the best selling video games ever.

[03:48] The franchise has sold over 480 million video games in total.

[03:56] That's not the revenue.

[03:57] That's the number of units.

[04:00] So just think about that for a minute.

[04:03] 480 million video games.

[04:08] Everyone's turn, Pinball, went to them and they're like, well, how many pinball machines

[04:12] do you think we might sell?

[04:13] Well, a thousand le's is what we're thinking.

[04:16] A thousand?

[04:18] These guys have sold 480 million video games in total.

[04:24] It just goes to show you how small our pinball community is, how niche pinball is, and all

[04:33] you need is like 0.01% of Pokemon fanatics and you're going to have an incredible selling

[04:41] pinball machine.

[04:42] The trading card success.

[04:44] Pokemon trading cards have sold over 52 billion cards worldwide since 1996.

[04:50] During the pandemic, vintage Pokemon cards saw explosive price increases with some rare

[04:56] cards selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars at auction.

[05:01] The cultural bridge.

[05:03] Pokemon became one of the first major Japanese cultural exports to achieve massive success

[05:09] in Western markets, helping pave the way for anime and manga's mainstream acceptance globally.

[05:17] Mobile gaming revolution.

[05:19] Pokemon Go became a cultural phenomenon in 2016, downloaded over 1 billion times and

[05:26] generating more than 6 billion in revenue.

[05:29] It demonstrated the massive potential of augmented reality gaming and got millions

[05:35] of people walking outdoors.

[05:38] Multi-generational appeal.

[05:39] This is important for us.

[05:41] The franchise has successfully maintained relevance across multiple generations with

[05:46] parents who grew up with Pokemon now sharing it with their children, creating a unique

[05:52] multi-generational fan base.

[05:55] The franchise has been studied in fields ranging from sociology to game design theory.

[06:08] The brand's ability to evolve while maintaining its core appeal has made it one of the most

[06:12] enduring entertainment properties in modern history.

[06:18] Now after hearing all of that, do you think they'll be able to sell Pokemon pinball machines?

[06:26] Two things that have been very culturally relevant for decades coming together with

[06:33] most likely two of the best designers in pinball because now the rumor is Jack Danger might

[06:38] have started this game and Elwyn might help him finish it and that would be amazing.

[06:44] So here's what I think is going to happen.

[06:46] I think a lot of people on pinside are going to moan and groan about this theme.

[06:51] They're going to see it, it's going to be colorful, it's going to be fun and they're

[06:55] going to get bit by the Pokemon bug.

[06:57] The same way Pokemon Go made older people get into it because it was just fun and if

[07:03] you really zoom out a little bit, it's Pokemon is fun and the theme of Pokemon is perfect

[07:10] for pinball and if you get one of the best pinball designers or two of the best designers

[07:15] collaborating on a game that shoots really well is very colorful, stands out in a lineup

[07:22] and has all these fun things to achieve and all these monsters to get and all this magic

[07:27] in a pinball experience, you're going to tell me you'd rather play John Wick or Venom or

[07:34] games like D&D.

[07:35] No this property opens the door for I think what is going to be one of the most fun pinball

[07:42] experiences and now it's starting to look like Stern Pinball might not be in so much

[07:48] trouble.

[07:49] If they nail Star Wars and then the next game after Star Wars is Pokemon that is two of

[07:57] the biggest IPs ever in a four month window.

[08:04] Most of you are going to wait more than four months to get your Harry Potter CE that you

[08:09] ordered a month and a half ago and that's the crazy thing about the hobby these days

[08:16] is sometimes it's easy to sort of feel like we're in a lull, nothing's happening, nothing's

[08:23] new and Stern Pinball is not sitting idly in that huge factory.

[08:29] They are planning some humongous juggernaut IP games and here's where it's going to get

[08:36] exciting and this is why I've said it and I'll say it again I think the next three years

[08:41] of pinball will be the best pinball we've ever had.

[08:47] These companies know the competition is higher than it's ever been.

[08:52] They know the prices are making us demand the games better be great and they better have

[08:58] everything in it or we're not going to buy because if you don't drop a game into the

[09:03] world that has what the fans of that property want they're going to go elsewhere.

[09:09] Look how many people you know who I'm talking about I'm one of them.

[09:12] How many people love the movie Predator?

[09:15] How many of you ordered a Predator?

[09:19] Exactly.

[09:20] If you love Pokemon you're going to love this game and get it.

[09:23] If you don't love Pokemon but you love pinball you're going to want this game and that's

[09:30] the other way in.

[09:32] There is a huge portion of this hobby that will put great pinball over theme.

[09:40] They will warm up to the theme.

[09:42] I was here, see the newbies don't know this, the newbie content creators were not in the

[09:47] hobby when stuff like this went down.

[09:50] I was here when Rick and Morty came out and most people in the pinball buying demo were

[09:57] not in to Rick and Morty and questioned whether or not people would want it.

[10:02] Even though that gameplay wasn't great we just loved Scott Denisi so much and the light

[10:07] show was amazing it sold out instantly.

[10:11] So Pokemon mark my words much like Star Wars will be a day one LE sell out not only that

[10:20] you won't be able to touch the LE's for anywhere near $13,000 it's just the power of IP.

[10:29] If Harry Potter only made a thousand CEs trust me it would have been more fun.

[10:36] We would have been trying harder to get one it would have been fun to see how much people

[10:41] would pay.

[10:42] It's kind of boring that they made it unlimited I get why they did it but as a collector

[10:49] and as someone who speculates on pinball market and pinball market prices it's boring

[10:55] when you just say we're going to make as many as people want.

[10:59] It's good for you if you want to buy it but it's a boring topic all of a sudden.

[11:04] If everybody could have it then it doesn't create that much excitement and that much

[11:10] interest.

[11:11] And so here we are August 6th Pokemon is coming out in January that is when it's going to

[11:18] drop and so let's look at the next few months Star Wars coming out in just a few weeks then

[11:25] we're going to get the walking dead remastered then we're going to get Beetlejuice from Spooky

[11:32] Pinball and then we're going to get Pokemon from Stern.

[11:36] I do not think we see Steve Richie's pin anytime soon in early 2026 I don't think we're going

[11:44] to see Steve Richie's pin until the end of next year.

[11:48] I don't think we're going to see back to the future until October back to the future day

[11:54] of 2026.

[11:55] I think Dutch pinball has got a long way to go which is why I think after they make around

[12:01] like 350 Alice's or 400 I don't think they make all 500.

[12:05] I think Melvin is going to throw Raza on the line and make about 300 of them and that's

[12:13] going to bridge the gap between Alice and back to the future.

[12:18] Dutch pinball can't afford to have no games on the line in that factory.

[12:23] I'm not exactly sure what's going on over there when they announced DPX.

[12:28] Remember the announcement it was like two buildings we got the building across the street.

[12:33] This is the building that's going to make DPX games and across the street is where we're

[12:37] going to make our Dutch pinball games and everyone's like cool the exclusive games over

[12:42] there and back to the future over here and then both of them will make back to the future

[12:47] because the demand is going to be so great.

[12:49] It doesn't feel like that's happening does it?

[12:52] Feels like Alice is just being made in the main building.

[12:55] Back to the future is nowhere in sight and there's no way they're going to make 500

[12:59] Alice's in this year and so it's about to get very very interesting and now that you

[13:06] realize that Stern pinball has got these humongous bookends Star Wars and Pokemon it almost feels

[13:15] like now you can approach the walking dead remastered a little bit differently.

[13:21] It doesn't need to be this ginormous hit.

[13:25] It's probably not even meant to be that.

[13:28] It's probably meant to just get some more money because think about this when Stern

[13:34] revolts or remasters a game that doesn't need any design R&D.

[13:42] Think about how much more profit and how incredible the margins are on a game that's already been

[13:51] designed.

[13:53] It's already been coded.

[13:55] Yeah, they might have to port over Lyman's masterpiece code onto a screen but that's a

[14:01] lot easier to do.

[14:04] It's already written the novel.

[14:06] You just have to reprint it on a new medium and so the margin play on these remastered

[14:13] games is phenomenal and they probably make more money on those remasters more money per

[14:20] game than they do on a Star Wars than they do on a Pokemon and so that's part of Stern's

[14:26] strategy and then the other thing they're going to do is clobber us with overpriced

[14:31] accessories and you add it all up and that's Stern's modern approach and so they don't really

[14:37] care that they're not re-releasing Tron when the new Tron movie comes out.

[14:43] The other thing that's crazy about Stern is look how many hit games they have.

[14:48] Look how many huge IPs they have.

[14:51] They can, they will and they've shown us they will go back to the well and re-release

[14:58] something when they need to just fill in the gap and that's why I think we're going

[15:03] to get ACDC again and for the two to three thousand they might sell to the newbies.

[15:08] You got to remember a game like ACDC has been out for ten years plus so there are a lot

[15:16] of new to pinball buyers that were not around back then that don't want to buy used and

[15:23] if they modernize it they'll go in on the game because it's still a great game.

[15:29] It's just refreshed and looks better than it ever did before and we know that this is

[15:36] the balancing act over at Stern.

[15:38] They know that's going to burn the original buyers.

[15:42] They know that's going to decrease the value of those old collectors.

[15:46] They don't care about collectors anymore.

[15:49] Stern has made it quite clear that all of you people that collected Sterns that kept

[15:54] them in business for the last decade they don't care about you.

[16:00] When was the last time they did anything for you?

[16:04] They've never given you a bone.

[16:06] They've only fleeced you.

[16:08] Imagine Stern when James Bond's 60th came out.

[16:11] They easily could have said we're going to offer this game for eight thousand dollars

[16:17] to anyone that's bought more than a hundred thousand dollars in Stern LEs over the years.

[16:24] No one would have complained about that strategy.

[16:27] Then you hand your loyal customers a valuable item that only five hundred people have.

[16:33] Did they do that?

[16:35] No.

[16:36] They asked for twenty thousand dollars on a game that looked like a five thousand dollar

[16:40] game.

[16:41] They don't care about collectors.

[16:43] The marketing department has always been focused on League Night players and operators

[16:49] and Gary sees the distros as the customers.

[16:53] That's why they want to sell a twenty thousand dollar James Bond 60th because they're going

[16:59] to sell that to the distro for twelve and they feel like yeah we're going to hand our

[17:05] loyal distros in eight thousand dollar profit while we screw over the real customer which

[17:12] is you and me.

[17:13] They're going to screw over the end user and that's been Stern's biggest marketing mistake

[17:19] over the last ten years.

[17:21] Gary could care less about us.

[17:24] He only cares about who buys his product directly which are the dealers and the distros.

[17:31] It's an outdated business model.

[17:33] Everybody knows it.

[17:34] We don't need it anymore.

[17:36] And it's the number one reason why Stern has destroyed its own collector base.

[17:42] And so now here we are.

[17:44] No one's collecting Harry Potter's.

[17:46] It's a new pinball market now.

[17:48] Just buy what you love.

[17:50] Play games before you buy it but nothing you buy is really going to hold much value anymore.

[17:56] Now I'm going to play devil's advocate a little bit.

[17:59] If they make a thousand Star Wars L.E.'s and it's four five and six and it's finally an

[18:04] amazing Star Wars game.

[18:06] It's absolutely going to be sought after.

[18:08] It's absolutely going to become a collectible and it's going to do what it does.

[18:12] That's what a strong IP does.

[18:14] If by nature if you nail a strong IP and you make it limited it will remain collectible.

[18:21] Same with Pokemon fallout not so much fallout.

[18:25] I hear people saying oh yeah fallouts can be the next big thing fallout will do all right.

[18:31] It's not at the same level.

[18:33] It's just not.

[18:35] And so what's really going to get tough for the companies like barrels for the companies

[18:41] like multi-morphic for the companies like Turner pinball for the companies I don't know

[18:47] not really Dutch because they have the biggest theme everybody wants for companies like American

[18:52] pinball if they're even still around for everybody else companies like C.G.C. I mean C.G.C. is

[18:57] making all their money from Churchill cabinets.

[18:59] They don't care about you at all.

[19:01] I mean talk about a company that doesn't care about its consumers Chicago gaming company

[19:06] craps all over its consumers every single year.

[19:11] Here we are August 6th nobody knows where their medieval madness Merlin remakes are for everybody

[19:17] else it's going to get really tough.

[19:20] It's going to be calm and I've been saying it for a while.

[19:23] It's a three horse race between spooky Stern and J.J.P.

[19:31] Those three companies that's where all the excitement is that's where all the energy

[19:36] is and that's where all the enthusiasm lies.

[19:39] If you want to break into that three horse race you got to get the theme right.

[19:45] You got to have a company that's more transparent that knows how to connect with communities

[19:50] and you got to drop a banger.

[19:52] I forgot to mention pinball brothers Pajretty gaming right.

[19:56] Do you really think a year from now we're going to be saying those names like people

[20:00] are going to be looking to those guys.

[20:02] It's not going to happen.

[20:04] It's a three horse race.

[20:06] Games are too expensive and juggernauts are coming out.

[20:09] I'm so excited to see these games.

[20:12] I know you are you know and the pressure is on for everybody else.

[20:16] Everybody have a great Wednesday a great hump day.

[20:20] Wednesday Adams is back on Netflix.

[20:23] Will I get a Pokemon.

[20:25] I love Japanese culture.

[20:27] Look I'm open minded about it.

[20:29] I am absolutely open minded about it.

[20:31] It's not a dream theme but it's not a theme I hate.

[20:35] You know it doesn't turn me off like a venom or a D&D.

[20:38] Everybody will chat soon.

[20:41] Let me know how you feel about Pokemon.

[20:43] Canadian pinball at gmail.com.

[20:45] Peace out.

[20:58] I got a catch on more.

[21:00] Got a catch on more.

[21:02] Pokemon.
