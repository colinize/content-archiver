[00:00] Did you like that crying Nicholas Cage down?

[00:21] We had to start this edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] The crying, the moaning, the groaning that I'm hearing over a few topics is really going

[00:31] to be the topic of this short sort of micro edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:36] It's Wednesday, it's a beautiful day in New York City, the cold weather is sort of broken,

[00:41] the sunshine is coming through.

[00:43] I went on Pinside this morning and I saw just threat after threat of people crying about

[00:50] stern code.

[00:52] I want to talk about that for a minute because I think there is an unfair sort of anger

[01:00] and critique and impatience that people have with stern code.

[01:06] Let's talk about Batman code because even I said, look, George Gomez said New Batman

[01:13] code was going to be out last Tuesday.

[01:15] Now two Tuesdays have come and gone and there's no code.

[01:20] You could easily look at that in a vacuum and lose your mind and say holy shit like this

[01:25] is total bullshit stern.

[01:27] What's wrong with you?

[01:28] You're such liars.

[01:29] How could you do this to us?

[01:31] Or you could say the game just came out three weeks ago.

[01:37] It's playable.

[01:38] People are having fun with it and new code is definitely coming and it's coming from the

[01:45] best coder in the world, which is lime and sheets.

[01:49] So is there really reason to panic and have such concern over not getting the code this

[01:56] week?

[01:57] And I think to me, the most irritating part about the people whining and moaning and

[02:03] groaning about the lack of Batman code is because the people crying for the most part,

[02:10] they don't even have the game.

[02:12] They don't have the game.

[02:14] So I don't even understand why these people on the sidelines are so upset and so angry

[02:21] that George Gomez lied and there's no new code.

[02:25] Really everyone I know who has a Batman Ellie loves it.

[02:28] They're having fun with it.

[02:30] They're enjoying it.

[02:32] They're happy.

[02:33] They're happy people.

[02:35] And they're really happy because they know that the game is fun.

[02:39] It's colorful.

[02:40] The LCD is great.

[02:42] And they can see the potential of what limeing can do with the game.

[02:46] Yes, there are some people out there that say, I'm not impressed with the shots.

[02:50] I don't like the rotating mechanism.

[02:53] It's not for me.

[02:54] And that's cool.

[02:55] That's cool.

[02:56] Not every pin is going to be for everybody.

[02:58] But for the most part, I think people are really excited about this pin.

[03:03] And it's just really at the point now where the people who do wine and moan and complain

[03:08] about stuff like stern code taking a little while to get out.

[03:12] I think all those people need to take a big step back and look at the hobby in general

[03:18] and ask yourself one question.

[03:21] Where would we be without stern?

[03:24] Right?

[03:25] Stern is the only manufacturer out there that consistently ships pinball machines to buyers

[03:31] and collectors and to operators.

[03:34] Without stern, there really is no conversation.

[03:38] There's no news.

[03:39] There's no pin-side dialogue.

[03:41] We'd still be talking about medieval madness from 20 years ago.

[03:46] Stern is not without faults.

[03:49] And I have this debate all the time with people online about stern.

[03:53] I have issues with stern quality.

[03:56] I have issues with stern cookie cutter approach to pinball.

[03:59] I think stern, though, has made significant improvements over the last couple years in terms

[04:05] of artwork in terms of getting code out sooner than later.

[04:10] I mean, Ghostbusters for all intents and purposes came with complete code for the most part.

[04:17] And when they made the code update, they made the one big change everyone asked for.

[04:22] And that was the ability to have modes time out and to be able to progress to the next

[04:27] mode without completing a mode.

[04:29] And I don't hear people complaining about Ghostbusters code.

[04:32] And remember, Ghostbusters came out within six months and the code is pretty much complete.

[04:38] If you were to tell people you can have the pinball machine you want in your living room,

[04:43] in your game room today and you might have to wait six months for complete code, I bet

[04:49] you 99% of people would accept that type of agreement.

[04:53] So it really perplexes me that people still continue to bitch and moan about Stern's

[04:58] code and their delay in getting code.

[05:01] Let me tell you what every other manufacturer out there has a real problem getting to you.

[05:05] And that's just a damn machine.

[05:07] They can't even get you the machine.

[05:09] And you can't tell me that Stern is some sort of criminal pinball organization that lies

[05:16] to people and doesn't do what they say.

[05:19] That's not the case.

[05:21] That's not the case.

[05:22] And Batman code is coming.

[05:25] And we all know that Lyman is a perfectionist and won't release a code if it's buggy and

[05:30] if it's not right.

[05:31] You can't tell me that George Gomez and the Stern people did not want people to flip Batman

[05:37] at Expo in October.

[05:38] Of course they did.

[05:39] Lyman wouldn't let them because the code wasn't ready.

[05:42] And I look, I go back and forth in that.

[05:46] I think they should let people at least see the shot geometry and let people play it.

[05:50] We understood it was early.

[05:52] But the other thing too is if people can't realize that Stern developed Batman after Aerosmith,

[06:00] that's what happened.

[06:02] They pushed Batman in front of Aerosmith.

[06:05] And why did they do that?

[06:06] I think it's pretty obvious why.

[06:09] Thirtyth anniversary of Stern.

[06:11] They wanted a big theme that really captivated the audience, that excited people.

[06:19] And what better way to do it than with Adam West and Batman and Batman 66.

[06:24] You had Adam West at Stern's booth at Expo.

[06:28] You had the Batmobile there.

[06:30] You had a great way to celebrate for them in their minds.

[06:33] I don't think the party and all that celebration came to fruition properly.

[06:38] But in the end of the day, that theme was really a good birthday present to the company.

[06:44] If they had chosen Aerosmith, they weren't going to get Aerosmith to come to Expo.

[06:49] They weren't going to get Stephen Tyler and Joe Perry and these guys to participate in

[06:53] anything for them.

[06:55] And so it makes sense that they went with the theme that gave them more assets, gave

[07:00] them and was less bipolar, right?

[07:03] Or less polarizing.

[07:04] People either love Aerosmith or don't like Aerosmith.

[07:07] I think a lot more people universally find the Adam West Batman fun.

[07:14] They have nostalgia with it and it's more of a universal theme.

[07:17] So that's why they did it.

[07:19] So for people that keep bitching about the code, why don't all you guys stop bitching about

[07:24] Stern code and actually start going into the threads where I think people should be

[07:28] bitching a little bit more and should have a little bit more pitchforks.

[07:32] Let's take for example something that I even left off of my 2017 recap.

[07:38] Why don't people start and go bitch about pinball circus and where is pinball circus?

[07:44] Two years ago pinball circus was being remade.

[07:47] Where is it?

[07:48] Right?

[07:49] Where are the 12 prototypes?

[07:50] I don't know.

[07:51] Why don't you go bitch about that?

[07:53] Or how about people go and they bitch in the alien thread about the lack of updates in

[07:58] January of 2017?

[07:59] I don't see people even saying anything.

[08:02] Where is the LA artwork?

[08:03] Why don't people go complain about that?

[08:05] Where is the alien machine?

[08:07] Forget about the artwork.

[08:08] The machine was promised to be out in April of 2015 and that thread right now is pretty

[08:14] much dead, dead silent.

[08:16] Nobody's on there.

[08:17] Nobody's complaining.

[08:18] Nobody's saying anything.

[08:20] I saw Andrew posted this morning a little just a sentence that the programmer has all

[08:26] they need to program and then someone said to him, Andrew convinced me to get your machine

[08:31] over the Wizard of Oz.

[08:33] When is it shipping?

[08:34] Then there's just like dead silence.

[08:36] If you want to bring your pitchforks, don't bring them to Stern's door because of Batman

[08:40] code.

[08:41] Bring them to Andrew Highway's door because of the lack of information he's sharing

[08:44] with alien buyers.

[08:46] People have paid in full.

[08:50] People have paid in full for alien pinball now for almost two years and they don't have

[08:55] even a visualization of what the LE package is.

[08:59] I'm surprised more people aren't complaining about that.

[09:02] You gotta be careful when you bitch.

[09:04] You gotta be careful because Stern reads Pinside.

[09:08] For those of you who think that they don't, you're wrong.

[09:12] For the chronic complainers out there, Stern knows who you are and they're not going

[09:17] to help you if you have issues.

[09:21] It's very interesting to see Pinside user KPG.

[09:26] He's had issues with his Ghostbusters.

[09:28] When he had issues with his Ghostbusters, Gary Stern personally reached out to him and

[09:33] said he was going to help him.

[09:35] What did KPG do after that?

[09:37] He went on Pinside and just slammed Stern every chance he got.

[09:43] He went against the trust that Gary was trying to build with him and now where is he left

[09:49] without any help from Stern.

[09:51] I have to say this.

[09:52] If I was a business owner and I ran a company and I made products and I sent a product

[09:58] to somebody and they had a problem with my product and I called them up and said, you know

[10:03] what?

[10:04] I'm going to help you.

[10:05] My personal number and I'm going to make sure we make you right and you say thank you,

[10:11] thank you Chris.

[10:12] Thank you for reaching out and I look forward to seeing a solution happen in the future.

[10:19] If I then go on the forum and see this person who I personally reached out to, slam me, slam

[10:26] my company, start talking all this trash about pinball and Stern pinball and my product

[10:34] without contacting me first after I had built up a relationship with this person and confided

[10:40] in them that they could come to me, what would I do?

[10:43] What would I do?

[10:44] I mean I might do what Gary is doing and say, you know what?

[10:49] Screw you man, screw you.

[10:51] I'm trying to help you.

[10:53] You know we have a situation here.

[10:55] I'm tackling each one case by case and you're going to go off and do that after I reached

[11:00] out to you.

[11:01] I wouldn't be surprised if guys like KPG just never see any support from Stern in the

[11:06] future and Stern doesn't care to lose you and as much as KPG might go on and complain

[11:12] about Stern's lack of support for him, I think we have to look at his case in a little

[11:17] bit of a vacuum and say, you know what man, you kind of shot yourself in the foot by going

[11:22] off and saying all those nasty things about Stern and then expecting them to help you.

[11:27] And this again, it's part of what everyone needs to do a little bit and just zoom out

[11:33] and look at the reality of the world and how the world works.

[11:38] If you want to go crazy and completely bash a company, don't expect that company to

[11:44] help you out, right?

[11:45] I don't expect, you know like I've been very critical of highly pinball and whatnot.

[11:51] I don't expect if I went in on an alien pinball machine for Andrew or anyone over there

[11:57] ever to roll out the red carpet or help me with an issue, right?

[12:00] I don't expect him to come on my show to do an interview.

[12:03] When I saw Andrew at Expo, he said he'd come on the show, I reached out to him and he

[12:08] never got back to me.

[12:09] And look, I get it, like we don't have to pretend, like we don't always have to pretend

[12:13] and be friends with everybody.

[12:16] But there is just a reality and a consequence that comes along with the constant complaining

[12:21] that goes on.

[12:23] So you know, look, code takes a while to get out.

[12:27] We know this.

[12:28] We know that Stern pinball machines don't come with complete code and some games may take

[12:35] a long time to get code updates.

[12:36] We also know Stern's business model by now.

[12:38] So everyone knows it by now and just to clarify, if you don't know it and you're a pinball

[12:43] collector and you're on pin side or you really need to learn the realities of going in on

[12:48] a Stern and it's very simple to understand.

[12:51] But Stern is all about keeping the assembly line moving and they get the games out before

[12:56] code's done and they're on to the next game.

[12:59] And the games that sell well, they will of course pay more attention to those games when

[13:03] it comes to code updates and stuff like that.

[13:07] The games that don't sell tremendously well, you might risk those games not getting polished

[13:14] and finished when it comes to code.

[13:16] And the best advice is always, always, just wait.

[13:21] Wait until a game is done.

[13:24] I actually was really spoiled because my first pinball machine that I bought was Lord of

[13:28] the Rings, Ellie and I got it when code was done.

[13:33] And it also just happened to be probably one of Stern's best games ever and probably

[13:37] I think one of the best codes in any pinball machine of all time.

[13:43] So I was spoiled as that being my first pin.

[13:45] So I don't know what it's really liked to have like incomplete code.

[13:49] But if you wait, if you wait a year after a Stern pinball machine is released, chances

[13:54] are you'll either have a game with complete code or know that that game has been abandoned

[13:59] by Stern.

[14:00] Okay, there's a good chance of that.

[14:02] You'll also be able to get that pinball machine in fantastic shape with low plays from another

[14:08] collector.

[14:09] Always happens.

[14:10] Every game comes up for sale.

[14:11] No matter what it is, it will always come up for sale.

[14:15] We are also at a place now where I don't think any game is going to increase in value

[14:20] after a year.

[14:22] Those days are over.

[14:23] Okay, the Tron Ellie days are done.

[14:26] You are not going to see Batman Ellie's sell for more than 10K.

[14:29] You will not see super Ellie's sell for more than 15K.

[14:33] Nobody is selling hobbits for more than they paid for.

[14:36] No one is going to sell a bouski for more than they paid for it.

[14:39] So it's to all of your advantage to just wait.

[14:43] Alright, and also I think if you wait, you have one thing.

[14:46] You have total peace of mind.

[14:47] There is such peace of mind to be found in waiting to see where a game goes versus the opposite,

[14:54] which is rushing in during the period of hype, getting the game because you have to have

[14:59] it now, locking your money in, sometimes never even seeing what the game looks like, sometimes

[15:05] not knowing how many they're going to make.

[15:06] Most importantly, for many people out there, when your option is not a stern, you are anxiously

[15:13] awaiting just to know when you're going to get your game.

[15:16] And I say this, it's not fun.

[15:19] It is no fun at all waiting on a release date for a product.

[15:25] At least stern gets you the game within weeks normally of reveal and announcement.

[15:32] Right?

[15:33] They've sometimes that slipped.

[15:35] For the most part, we saw the Batman flyer when in October, early October, late September,

[15:44] said the game was going to be out in November.

[15:46] They missed that date by what, three weeks, and the game was out and people had it right

[15:51] after Christmas.

[15:52] Now they're going out in larger volumes.

[15:56] People can live with that.

[15:57] When did you hear about Alien?

[15:59] When did you hear about Hobbit?

[16:00] When did you hear about Magic Girl?

[16:03] When did you hear about Pimball Circus?

[16:07] When did you hear about P3?

[16:09] When did you hear, I just keep going.

[16:10] It's an endless list of all these other games we've heard about, thunderbirds.

[16:15] When have you heard about all these things?

[16:17] They're out there.

[16:20] Terrible marketing across the board by all these other companies.

[16:23] There's nothing gained by having your title out there and then you don't have it.

[16:27] Let's give Stern some breaks.

[16:29] Let's cut them some slack.

[16:31] The moaning and groaning about code at this point is just the most silly argument out

[16:36] there.

[16:37] It's like crying that the sky is blue.

[16:38] It is just the reality that you're going to have to wait.

[16:41] Speaking of coding and coders and programmers, did you see the news that Josh Kugler is joining

[16:49] American Pimball to be the programmer for Houdini?

[16:56] It's exciting news.

[16:57] I think American Pimball in my book is at a crossroads still.

[17:02] These guys still have to do one thing.

[17:04] They have to clarify what the situation is with Zidware and Magic Girl and John.

[17:11] They have to eventually get to that.

[17:14] I think they need to finish that before they start getting us excited about Houdini and

[17:18] start mentioning all these updates around Houdini.

[17:21] I think the marketer and me, and I know Scott's a marketer and I know he's over there

[17:25] too juggling these two things.

[17:28] It's got to be an annoying situation for them, but they have nobody to blame but themselves.

[17:33] They put themselves into this situation.

[17:36] Because on one front, you want to start getting people excited about Houdini.

[17:40] You're a new Pimball company.

[17:42] This is really your first Pimball machine.

[17:45] You're designing it from the ground up.

[17:47] You're building a team at American Pimball that is sort of poaching talent from the industry

[17:53] that you think is great and think has good chemistry together to make Houdini.

[17:59] It doesn't change the fact that Houdini will still be a John Papaduke theme that he was

[18:06] working on it for you guys.

[18:08] Your initial intent was to make John Papaduke's Houdini through American Pimball.

[18:16] It's clear they're not going to do that.

[18:18] They need to address the magic girl buyers and they need to do it soon.

[18:24] I keep asking Scott for information.

[18:27] I've asked John for information.

[18:29] I even asked Josh yesterday when I congratulated him on joining American Pimball.

[18:35] What I heard from him was it's just completely two separate camps.

[18:38] The people working on getting magic girl done have nothing to do with the completion

[18:43] or the work on Houdini.

[18:46] It makes sense.

[18:47] Completely makes sense.

[18:49] If you believe that magic girl was commissioned to be made by American Pimball and it's completely

[18:54] separate project fine.

[18:57] I still think there is more overlap than they want us to believe.

[19:02] I am giving these guys every benefit of the doubt to come out and give us some clear

[19:08] information.

[19:09] I don't know why it's so hard to get clarity around this topic.

[19:12] I really don't.

[19:14] When is magic girl going to ship?

[19:16] When will they be done?

[19:18] I know the legal issues which they were claiming to have worked through and this and that.

[19:24] They're not 100% work through now because the communication between Bill and American

[19:30] Pimball is not finalized.

[19:33] That's all I'm going to say in that matter.

[19:35] I've been waiting and I've given these guys every ability to move quickly and to be clear

[19:43] in their strategy with magic girl and I really don't get anything but ambiguous answers.

[19:50] Look all I can do is wait.

[19:52] I know Bill has been very patient with these guys and he's waiting.

[19:55] I know Chris from coin takers very patient and he's waiting.

[19:59] I know the other magic girl owners out there have been very patient and they're waiting.

[20:03] I really really think these guys deserve an answer soon.

[20:07] Same as I think everyone in on alien deserves to see what the Ellie package looks like.

[20:12] I think people are owed these things.

[20:13] I think they've spent money and when you've taken people's money for something I don't

[20:19] think you can make them sit in the dark for very long.

[20:23] I'm hearing the same thing from the Bowsky buyers.

[20:27] They're just not getting any communication from the team over at Dutch.

[20:32] We said it.

[20:33] We really want 2017 to be the year where these companies start behaving differently and are

[20:39] held accountable.

[20:41] I think they will be.

[20:42] I think they will be because I think you guys out there.

[20:45] You control everything.

[20:47] You are the community of Pimble, the buyers out there, the collectors out there.

[20:53] Your purchase decisions will determine which one of these companies survives and which one

[20:59] of these companies fails.

[21:02] It is all up to you.

[21:04] There was that thread that was like let's tell Stern hell no and as much as I thought

[21:08] that thread was a little bit silly the thread has merit and all of you can control this

[21:17] entire hobby.

[21:19] You can control Pimble pricing.

[21:21] You can control the delays and when you get your Pimble machine because look if a Pimble

[21:28] company comes out and takes your money and refuses to ship you the game when they said

[21:33] they're going to ship it you guys have the power to do one thing and that's go get a

[21:38] refund.

[21:39] If you were all to go ask for a refund because so and so missed their deadline by six months

[21:45] or a year and you all pulled your money out that company would go under.

[21:50] It would go under and by keeping your money invested in people who have proven time and

[21:57] time again to miss deadlines, to lie, to be disingenuous, to set false expectations

[22:04] when you invest your money with those companies and keep your money invested there.

[22:09] All you're doing is supporting and reinforcing the bad behavior of those organizations.

[22:16] I don't buy it like oh no you're supporting Pimble or you're investing in Pimble and that's

[22:22] why you're keeping your money there.

[22:23] I don't think that's the case.

[22:27] You might think that's what you're doing but at the end of the day I think we're letting

[22:30] a lot of really bad businessmen get away with being bad businessmen because they're

[22:36] not being held accountable and the only way to make men accountable or bad businessmen

[22:41] accountable is to not either buy their products or to get a refund when you're unhappy with

[22:46] the service you have with them.

[22:48] It's like take dutch for example.

[22:50] There are so many people out there that are truly unhappy with the lack of communication

[22:55] but these people have been invested for years now and this mentality of why I've been in

[23:00] it so long I might as well just wait and I hate to see people get stuck there.

[23:06] You see the same mentality people have in the stock market in other areas of your life

[23:11] and even in personal relationships how many of us have been in a relationship with someone

[23:16] where we've been dating someone for years and we know we know we should get out.

[23:21] We know we don't want to end up with them like we know we truly don't love them but

[23:26] we say to ourselves well I've been in it so long I might as well just stay in it and

[23:32] whenever you make a decision through a mentality like that it always ends poorly right you end

[23:37] up marrying someone you don't love you end up buying a product that by the time you get

[23:43] it you're never really able to fully enjoy it.

[23:46] So I really want this to be the year guys where all of us really really take back the hobby

[23:56] and show these companies that they don't own the pinball world that they don't control

[24:01] the way the pinball world operates that the buyers do that the buyers do the collectors

[24:07] do the players do.

[24:09] I really I think it's the year where we need to tell Stern you know we need to see more

[24:14] of a world under glass from you guys the cookie cutter approach ain't cutting it.

[24:19] It's more than just art guys you need to create magic in your games.

[24:23] I think we need to start telling people like Andrew and Dutch enough is enough like you

[24:29] know shit or get off the pot guys like either get your games out or just just go under

[24:35] like it's one or the other like no one wants to see the sausage being made for years.

[24:41] It's the worst marketing ever and your money should be spent buying something and enjoying

[24:47] it because you could have bought two or three other games and enjoyed them and sold them

[24:53] and not really lost much and had great pinball experiences over the last two years or you

[24:57] could have waited for alien and been anxious and great you have an Ellie like the Ellie's

[25:02] aren't even they're still not sold out they're still not sold out just think about that

[25:07] for a minute when Stern sells out Ellie's in a minute matter of minutes so that's it you

[25:13] know everyone needs to stop bitching about code stop stop bitching about Stern all the

[25:18] time I mean it gets old it gets old and if you want to complain about things you know

[25:23] look at the other people out there look at what they're doing show me someone who's

[25:26] doing it better than Stern really who's actually doing it better than Stern and ultimately

[25:33] take back the hobby take it back it's yours don't let them push you around don't let these

[25:40] manufacturers lie to you to see you and could jol you into investing in them and if you

[25:47] do invest in them and you see that your investment isn't being respected and they're not good business

[25:55] people then take your money out take your money out so that's it little sort of micro Wednesday
