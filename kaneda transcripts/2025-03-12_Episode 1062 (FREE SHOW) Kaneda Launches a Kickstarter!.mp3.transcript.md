[00:00] I am begging, each and every one of you, stop sending me that Alice Kickstarter

[00:29] Story.

[00:30] I saw it went live yesterday.

[00:32] I've been following this game like the rest of you.

[00:35] I don't care.

[00:38] This thing is a cheap Tinker toy.

[00:42] How stupid can this community be?

[00:45] I mean that.

[00:46] Why do people keep sending me this?

[00:48] Being like, see, these guys can do it for $799.

[00:53] We're getting ripped off by Jersey Jack and Stern Pimple.

[00:56] People wake up.

[00:57] How stupid can you be?

[00:59] Just like someone sending me a freaking Power Wheels toy saying that I paid too much for

[01:06] my Dodge Demon.

[01:08] This thing is going to be a plastic piece of junk.

[01:14] How can they make a pinball machine for $799 and make a profit?

[01:23] Think about that.

[01:24] That means the cost to make this machine for them is going to be around like $300 to $400

[01:31] at most.

[01:33] So if you think you're getting a quality product, it's going to be like cardboard people and

[01:39] plastic.

[01:40] I'm so sick of this thing.

[01:42] And here's what I'm going to do.

[01:44] I'm going to create Canada's Pinball Podcaster, the Canada Kickstarter.

[01:49] And here's how it's going to work.

[01:51] Look for it in the next week or so.

[01:53] I am going to raise on Kickstarter $1,000.

[01:59] That's what I'm going to ask of all of you.

[02:01] That's my goal.

[02:02] And if we hit the goal of $1,000, I'm going to buy one of these $800 Alice machines.

[02:10] I'm going to spend the rest of the money on gasoline.

[02:13] I'm going to drive it to Todd Tucky's place to TNT Amusements.

[02:18] And I'm going to push this damn thing off the roof.

[02:22] That is what I plan to do with the $1,000.

[02:26] And if you want to contribute more than that, thank you.

[02:29] I will take Brenda out to dinner with the money over the $1,000.

[02:34] Look for the Canada Kickstarter real soon.

[02:36] And I can guarantee you that my Kickstarter moment will be much more entertaining than

[02:43] the cheap plastic tinker toy version of Alice.

[02:47] And also people, wake up.

[02:49] You none of you know, and I don't even think it was any of you, the people that donated

[02:54] to this thing are moronic because they don't know the way Kickstarter works.

[02:59] There's a reason why he set the goal at $100,000.

[03:04] You and I both know you can start a pinball manufacturing company for $100,000.

[03:09] But the reason why they set the goal at that is if they don't reach the goal of $100,000,

[03:16] then everybody who donated gets a refund.

[03:19] But the moment they hit that goal, nobody gets any money back.

[03:24] This thing could go belly up and nobody gets a refund.

[03:28] Not only that, any money raised over that $100,000 goes directly into their pockets.

[03:36] So think about that for a minute.

[03:38] This company could have set up this whole thing and this guy could walk away with almost

[03:44] a half a million dollars and then announced that the project wasn't feasible.

[03:50] And after they ran the numbers on production, they couldn't make it work.

[03:55] And he can ride off into the sunset with only having made a prototype of the game and never

[04:00] getting customers their products.

[04:02] I don't think it's going to go that way.

[04:03] I don't know if it's going to go that way.

[04:05] But what I do know is that he now has $450,000 that he doesn't have to return to anybody.

[04:11] And you might have just paid his salary.

[04:13] This thing could have been fully financed and independently financed by an outside investment

[04:18] group.

[04:19] And you just gave this guy half a million dollars.

[04:21] And again, I don't know why I'm saying they.

[04:22] I know nobody who listens to Canade's BitBall podcast donated to this thing.

[04:27] I can't even get you guys to donate $10 a month, let alone buy an $800 tinker toy.

[04:32] And I apologize to those of you out there who are offended.

[04:36] He did it again.

[04:37] Canade did it again.

[04:38] He just made fun of us for only making a $5 donation a month and he's busking for $10

[04:43] a month.

[04:44] I'm so sorry if you're a grown man and you're upset that Canade is asking you to raise the

[04:51] roof because he does two to three shows a week, a 90 minute live show.

[04:57] Everybody are you not entertained?

[05:00] Jerry, where's your portal game?

[05:03] Did you see this?

[05:04] Carrie already coming out telling us, hey guys, something about me you didn't know.

[05:09] I've been secretly under NDA with Jerry at Multimorphic.

[05:14] Well let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, Canade has not been secretly under

[05:19] the NDA of Jerry Stelenberg.

[05:21] I'm free.

[05:23] Carrie doesn't know what it's like to be free.

[05:26] Carrie's got to keep his mouth shut and now he's saying that portal is going to be a hit.

[05:31] You see this?

[05:32] It's going to be a hit.

[05:34] And he's saying it's the best Multimorphic P3 game to date.

[05:39] Let me tell you something.

[05:40] That's like saying this is the best Canade is pinball podcast to date.

[05:46] Do you know how damn low the bar is on this pinball podcast?

[05:50] Do you know how damn low the bar is on Multimorphic games?

[05:54] Saying it's the greatest Multimorphic game to date isn't saying anything at all.

[06:00] They haven't had a hit game ever, Carrie.

[06:04] They haven't had a hit game ever.

[06:07] Stern pinball has sold more John Wick pros than this company has ever sold.

[06:15] Spooky pinball has sold more Rob's zombies than Multimorphic has ever sold.

[06:23] So I am at the point now with Multimorphic.

[06:26] I understand you're doing all this work.

[06:28] I think Jerry said something like he hasn't taken a salary in a decade.

[06:33] Sure.

[06:34] He hasn't made any money in a decade.

[06:37] Is he a robot?

[06:39] Is he someone who doesn't need food and sustenance?

[06:42] How does he pay his bills if he hasn't taken a salary in a decade?

[06:47] How is he paying all these people to engineer stuff for Multimorphic?

[06:52] We know he's made money off of P-Rock, but Jerry is a genius.

[06:56] He is a genius.

[06:57] He is the kind of guy that can turn a million dollars into a thousand dollars.

[07:02] He's missed the entire pinball money making wave over the last 10 years.

[07:08] And I know he invested his own money.

[07:10] He invested his family money in Multimorphic.

[07:13] And it's sort of sad to me.

[07:14] It's sort of sad because they haven't even sold 500 units.

[07:17] And I know nobody wants to talk about it like this, but I'll talk about it like this.

[07:21] Look, I hope Portals are hit.

[07:22] I hope they have a game that's really fun.

[07:24] And the same thing is going to happen when this becomes the best Multimorphic game ever

[07:28] made.

[07:29] The same thing that's going to happen when you saw Weird Al, the same thing that's going

[07:32] to happen when you saw Princess Bride.

[07:35] You're still not going to want one because even though you might want the game, you're

[07:39] not going to want to commit to this platform.

[07:42] And that's the part that's never going to work for Multimorphic.

[07:44] There is no market research out there that says people want to swap out these modular

[07:50] things inside pinball machines.

[07:52] And you know what's funny to me is they make this modular system where you could swap in

[07:57] the last third of the playfield becomes Lexi Lightspeed.

[08:00] It becomes Heist.

[08:01] It becomes Final Resistance.

[08:03] It becomes Princess Bride.

[08:04] Cool.

[08:05] So you're swapping them in and out.

[08:06] And what's the one thing this company's never made?

[08:08] They didn't even make a thing where you could store those extra modular versions of the

[08:13] playfield or the sections of the playfield.

[08:15] They have to leave it up to the community to design something to store those units.

[08:20] If you're going to make something like this, like even when we bought Nintendo cartridges

[08:25] when we were kids, right?

[08:26] Because this is what Jerry wants to make.

[08:28] He wants to make something that's more like a console and then you're going to buy like

[08:32] new games for the console.

[08:34] Okay.

[08:35] When Nintendo sold us all those cartridges, they also sold you something to put the cartridges

[08:39] in so you can have a nice sort of display of the things you own.

[08:44] He's never done that.

[08:45] Not that these things are small like Nintendo cartridges, but my thing is this Jerry, just

[08:48] get the game out.

[08:50] Just show us what the game is.

[08:51] I'm at the point now where it's really crazy to be that like portal for multi-morphic.

[08:57] It's going to be the first game we see and we'll see.

[08:59] I bet it is the best game they've ever made.

[09:01] I bet it's got the best engineering.

[09:03] I bet it's got the best toys.

[09:05] I mean it when I say it.

[09:06] This game is going to have more wow in it than Harry Potter.

[09:10] I mean it.

[09:11] The engineers over at multi-morphic are going to put more toys in it.

[09:16] They're going to be more innovative.

[09:18] They're going to do more than like most of these modern pinball companies are doing,

[09:22] but here's the caveat.

[09:24] They're doing it on a platform people don't want.

[09:29] It is like serving lobster on top of cardboard.

[09:34] Imagine having a lobster dinner and you're cutting into it over cardboard.

[09:41] That's what this is because people don't want the platform.

[09:45] What you're serving them up is not what they want.

[09:49] If they wanted it, you would have had a lot more people buying it over the last 10 years,

[09:55] Jerry.

[09:56] And the thing is, this is still a company that refuses to tell us how many units they've

[10:02] sold.

[10:03] So here's the thing.

[10:04] I will, I will turn a page and a new chapter on multi-morphic and be more positive if they

[10:11] do one thing.

[10:12] If they tell us how many units they have sold because I don't want to give credit to something

[10:18] unless it deserves credit.

[10:20] And I mean that.

[10:21] And look, again, the game's going to be probably really awesome.

[10:25] And here's the thing.

[10:26] You're going to want to play it, but at a show, you're going to want to play it on location.

[10:31] You're not going to find any on location, but it's just a real dilemma for pinball buyers

[10:36] now.

[10:37] Do you want to go in on this?

[10:39] If you commit to this platform, you're also kind of have to commit to getting the other

[10:44] games and then you know it, you know it.

[10:46] You're going to be like 20,000 in on a multi-morphic with all of its games and you go to sell it

[10:51] and you'll be lucky to get $10,000.

[10:53] And that's the state of pinball now.

[10:55] And so did you see this guy?

[10:57] Speaking of the state of pinball now, did you see this guy?

[10:59] He's got an avatar CE and he solved the issue with the UV lighting.

[11:05] Oh, congratulations.

[11:07] And has finally solved how to make the game look and feel more like stranger things when

[11:13] you go into that moment, the bioluminescent eclipse happening during the Pandora world,

[11:19] right?

[11:20] And so what the guy had to do, he went to like Home Depot and got a UV black light, put

[11:26] it on a tripod and it's like bent over.

[11:29] It almost looks like a four by six inch black light and he toggles it on and off when the

[11:35] game goes into eclipse mode.

[11:38] It is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

[11:41] If you are working at Jersey Jack and this was the big feature on your machine, all of

[11:49] you, all of you, Mark Sidon, everybody over there, Tom Capara, Eric Minier, I love you

[11:55] guys.

[11:56] You should be embarrassed that you are watching your customers have to do this to create the

[12:03] effect in your game that you sold us on in your hundred thousand dollar video.

[12:11] To me, Avatar is the past.

[12:14] This game is not going to sell that much.

[12:16] It's going to tank in value.

[12:18] It's not going to be a game people really want.

[12:20] It's beautiful.

[12:21] But you know what?

[12:22] You hoodwinked everybody with that reveal video and I'm over it.

[12:26] I'm looking forward to Harry Potter.

[12:28] I think Potter is the moment this company either shows us.

[12:33] They can do it or it's going to be the moment where people shoulder shrug, walk away and

[12:38] you're going to start to see more and more people supporting companies like Spooky, people

[12:43] that are putting the passion in and Jersey Jack is heading south unless they nail Potter.

[12:50] Doesn't matter how beautiful the games are.

[12:51] Look at the resale value on a Godfather's CE.

[12:55] You are now losing six to seven thousand dollars on a game.

[12:59] When you really sit down and think about what that means.

[13:02] I supported Jersey Jack Pinball and on two games.

[13:06] Let's just take Toy Story CE and Godfather CE.

[13:10] On those two games you lost between twelve and thirteen thousand dollars if you go to

[13:16] sell it today.

[13:17] I haven't even lost that much money on a Dodge Demon over six years.

[13:22] This is just the new state of Pinball and you got to think people how long are customers

[13:28] going to line up if they keep absorbing all of these things and if they made Toy Story

[13:34] one you wouldn't have lost a penny.

[13:37] If they made Toy Story one I would own one you would own one.

[13:41] If they made Toy Story one Andy's room Pizza Planet the claw.

[13:46] If they made the Toy Story everybody wanted you still would not be able to get one.

[13:51] Those CE's would be bolted to the floor.

[13:54] They only made Godfather because Jack wanted to make it.

[13:58] Makes no sense.

[14:00] Harry Potter is their moment.

[14:02] Gentlemen it's time.

[14:04] You know it's time.

[14:05] The game is done.

[14:06] The game is done.

[14:07] We're going to see it real soon.

[14:08] I'm excited because it's all or nothing on this.

[14:10] They're never going to go out of business.

[14:12] You have to understand this.

[14:13] When people say Jersey Jack needs to nail this they don't need to nail this for money.

[14:19] They don't need to nail this to stay in business.

[14:22] They need to nail this for their own pride.

[14:25] For their own legacy.

[14:28] Brett Abbas Eric Minier everybody over there.

[14:32] Jack Winnerty this is your legacy.

[14:35] And I know you think you've made games that people are appreciating but I don't think

[14:41] you're really reading the room.

[14:43] You guys have all the resources to make the greatest pinball that's ever been made and

[14:49] you haven't really hit the way you should be hitting.

[14:54] And you're only as good as your last game.

[14:56] If you make a magical Potter game that has great flow, great toys, great theme integration,

[15:04] great artwork you know what you need to do.

[15:06] I don't need to tell you what to do.

[15:09] You get to walk in every day and have a dream job.

[15:12] You get to walk in every day.

[15:14] You've got unlimited funding.

[15:16] You've got Eric who loves this theme.

[15:19] You've got a focus.

[15:21] This company has the ability to focus on one game at a time over a two year period.

[15:28] They didn't rob this game from your hands Eric the way they robbed X-Men from Jack and

[15:33] forced him to release it early because Stern has to keep that huge factory going.

[15:38] If Jersey Jack has nothing on the line for four months they can stay in business.

[15:44] If Jersey Jack doesn't put out a game for a year they could stay in business.

[15:49] That's not how Stern operates.

[15:51] It's not.

[15:52] And so Jersey Jack you've got all the resources.

[15:55] You've got all the time.

[15:57] You've got all the feedback right after a decade of us giving these guys feedback.

[16:03] Now's the moment.

[16:05] And that's why I'm so excited to see what they do.

[16:08] And don't mistake me for some strident vitriolic A-hole Canada.

[16:13] I want this game to be amazing.

[16:17] I want Eric Minier to show us what he's got.

[16:20] I want this game to be a combination of sort of Elton John gameplay meets the toys and

[16:30] fun of games like Wizard of Oz and Pirates meets the sort of satisfaction of Willy Wonka

[16:37] layout meets the sort of code enthusiasm we have.

[16:43] You know I'm trying to think of like which Jersey Jack game has the best code.

[16:46] I would probably say it's Willy Wonka.

[16:49] Really?

[16:50] It really is.

[16:51] The problem is they made it so hard but you know what I'm saying.

[16:52] It's like we shouldn't have to struggle for this much money to land on a Jersey Jack

[16:58] game where the code is incredible.

[17:00] We're going to get there and it's going to happen in less than two months.

[17:05] All right.

[17:06] So we got Portal.

[17:07] We got Alice is going out the door.

[17:08] Barrels of fun.

[17:09] All right.

[17:10] Here's the thing.

[17:11] I want to make my final guess and I'm probably going to be wrong but I want to make my final

[17:15] guess on what I think the Barrels game is because I'm tired of seeing just the exclamation

[17:20] flipper.

[17:21] I'm tired of seeing that on my here's what's coming out and the only one I'm not making

[17:26] a guess on is Barrels and it's really just a few weeks away.

[17:30] I'm going to tell you right now what my guess is and I think it's Goonies.

[17:35] That's it.

[17:36] That's Canadian's final guess.

[17:37] I think it's Goonies.

[17:38] I think they've been sandbagging us.

[17:40] I think they've done a good job.

[17:42] I think they've misdirected us.

[17:44] I think they've put out rumors that aren't real and I think it's going to be Goonies.

[17:49] I think there's going to be a massive pirate ship under the glass and I think they've done

[17:54] a great job keeping it under wraps.

[17:57] And I also think there's a 95% chance I could be wrong but I want to just tell you that's

[18:03] my final guess.

[18:04] Like if this is an episode of Traders and we're writing down with chalk on a little chalkboard

[18:09] and I'm going to turn it over and be like look you know what David you know what team

[18:13] you know what I think it's Goonies.

[18:15] I don't even know if that's a good metaphor for what I'm saying right now but anyway that's

[18:19] it here's the other thing we're going to know about this game in less than four weeks so

[18:23] it's going to happen then we're going to get Predator then we're going to get Harry Potter

[18:27] or King Kong and it's all coming in the next two months.

[18:31] It's about to get really exciting.

[18:32] Texas Pinball Festival is like what like nine days away.

[18:36] Normally people would reveal their stuff before TPF that's what's going to happen with Portal.

[18:40] I think we're going to see that any day now probably end of this week sometime into next

[18:45] week so it's about to get really exciting.

[18:48] Everybody thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[18:50] Hopefully you got some entertainment here.

[18:53] Hopefully this is the one show that's never going to I don't want to be under NDA.

[18:57] Hey something you didn't know about me guys is I've been talking to Jerry Stelenberg behind

[19:01] the scenes.

[19:02] Carrie you know I love you.

[19:03] You know I love you.

[19:04] Your content is great.

[19:05] And hey it's fun to see stuff early.

[19:07] I don't really like seeing stuff early because it's more fun for me to leak stuff and to

[19:12] spoil the plans of these precious pinball companies.

[19:16] Think about everything going on in the world.

[19:19] We haven't talked about how everyone's like investment portfolios has been decimated.

[19:24] Everyone's crypto has been decimated over the last few weeks.

[19:28] It's rough people so you know right when all these pinball companies are getting ready

[19:33] to ask you to buy eight to fifteen thousand dollar non-essential elements of your life

[19:39] you've lost a lot of money.

[19:42] And so it's not a good time to drop something like this into the world.

[19:47] I think a lot of you are going to start closing up your wallets.

[19:50] I think a lot of you are going to learn how to be satisfied with what you've got in life

[19:55] and I think we're heading into a period just a sort of reawakening.

[19:59] There's too much stuff out there in the world I was talking to my friend about this.

[20:02] Look at all the cars and watches and toys like all the collectible things.

[20:07] There's just so much of it at some point you wake up you're like honey I'm happy with what

[20:13] we have and I don't need more.

[20:16] When you reach that supernal realm in life you will be a lot happier.

[20:20] See it makes it it makes it easy when the economies tank because when the economies tank you don't

[20:25] even have to come to that conclusion on your own.

[20:27] The world has forced you into a situation where you can't just go buy everything like

[20:32] a little kid in a candy store.

[20:34] You've got to now sort of prioritize what's important to you and it's going to be fun

[20:40] watching all these games go up for sale.

[20:42] Do you see all these like walking dead Elize are going to start to go up for sale all these

[20:45] metallic Elize.

[20:47] Everyone's trying to still cash out and I mean this the amount of people trying to cash

[20:52] out on prices that are three years ago is crazy to me.

[20:57] Everyone started a thread on pin side the hobby is blah now and what they meant by that

[21:00] is can everyone just stop with the delusion of like thinking you're a metallic L.E. the

[21:06] old one is still worth like 18 or 15,000 your ghostbusters L.E. is 17,000 your walking dead

[21:13] L.E. is 14,000 it's over you're never getting those prices again and what used to be fun

[21:20] about this hobby I mean this we didn't like abuse each other.

[21:25] I mean that we did not abuse each other let me take you back to one moment in my life

[21:30] when I scalp the game I bought a ghostbusters L.E. I think it was like eight grand something

[21:35] like that I sold it not for 18,000 not for 15,000 I got something like 10 grand that

[21:44] was what we asked over for a game this was before $2,000 toppers this was before all

[21:51] these content creators bought every single game imaginable told you it was the best game

[21:55] ever and then sold it a week later right this is before all of that right well yeah it's

[21:59] great John Wickle these great okay yeah it's an amazing game I'm so happy I see my $13,000

[22:03] in value and then the games up for sale on Facebook a week later you know you bought

[22:07] a game for eight it was hard to get it was impossible to get they all sold out instantly

[22:11] and we were happy just putting $1,500 or $2,000 in our pockets you know the buyer was happy

[22:16] they weren't paying astronomical amounts over and for everything else people weren't trying

[22:21] to like go crazy COVID made everything go crazy and really it hasn't changed it hasn't

[22:26] become fun because everything is so astronomically overpriced and I hope we all wake up and again

[22:33] I think the market force is happening in the geopolitical world are gonna force it on

[22:38] a lot of us you know because I think your brains are still stuck in that COVID pricing

[22:42] pinball world I think with all these new games coming out there's gonna be a reality especially

[22:47] for these manufacturers they're not gonna be able to find homes for all of these products

[22:51] think about it how are we gonna absorb four to five new games over the next six weeks

[22:56] how is that gonna actually be successful how many people are gonna keep putting deposits

[23:00] down on things they can't actually afford it's about to get really interesting you know

[23:04] for me two things my house dictates how many games I can have at most I can have two and

[23:11] the other thing that dictates how many games I want is my mind like common sense I won't

[23:17] be happier in life if I get more pinball machines I won't be happier in life if I add more elements

[23:27] into my life that I don't really need my priorities are different than some of you I've got young

[23:33] children my priority is to get these kids educated to enjoy every moment as they are young I

[23:41] would rather spend ten thousand dollars on a Disney vacation with my children than buy

[23:47] a pinball machine that's where I'm at because those memories will live forever the pinball

[23:52] machine won't y'all get bored of it and then I'll lose three to four thousand dollars when

[23:56] I go to sell it when I got back from Disney even though it's overcrowded yes and Disney

[24:01] can be stressful every time I look back at those photos where we're blowing Killian's

[24:06] mind and Cassian is inside Brenda's belly we feel great it's amazing I want to get as

[24:13] close to that feeling on Jersey Jack pinballs Harry Potter I'm curious about Kong Jerry

[24:21] I know Portals gonna have a lot of toys in it but just tell me how many units you've

[24:25] made and if we raise a thousand dollars on Kickstarter Canada will push an eight hundred

[24:31] dollar Alice pinball machine off the roof of Todd Tucky's building and I bet it probably

[24:38] won't even break because the thing is going to be made of plastic it's just gonna bounce

[24:43] okay everybody happy Wednesday Canada out
