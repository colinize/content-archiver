[00:00] You're so brave.

[00:02] You probably think this song is about you.

[00:07] You're so brave.

[00:09] You're so insane.

[00:16] You know, I've been doing this for about three years now.

[00:19] And I have to say that last night was one of the most fun nights I've had.

[00:23] In the entire Pinball hobby,

[00:25] I'm going to talk a little bit about that.

[00:27] A lot about that on episode three hundred and sixty five of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[00:34] That is right.

[00:35] You could now listen to an episode every day for an entire year.

[00:41] Now that might terrify some of you.

[00:43] It might excite some of you.

[00:45] But if you've just caught on to this show, like if this is the first episode you've ever listened to,

[00:50] you can go back and catch up over an entire year.

[00:54] But I want to thank all of you out there who tune into the show, who have done it since day one.

[01:00] Those of you who join later on in the show.

[01:02] Those of you who hate the show.

[01:04] Those of you who love the show.

[01:06] I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for tuning in every week and listening to me ramble on about my thoughts about the Pinball hobby.

[01:14] Now what happened last night?

[01:17] Amazing, amazing night.

[01:19] Those of you who are there, I think you were part of a very special Pinball streaming night.

[01:23] So Ken Bill and Steve, Ken and Bill from Special When Lit, they were on their weekly flipping out sort of stream on Twitch,

[01:33] which is Zach Menys Pinball Distribution Company.

[01:36] He has a great streaming channel on Twitch.

[01:39] And so here's what happened.

[01:41] They were streaming Willy Wonka.

[01:43] And then for like an hour, there were a bunch of us in there watching them stream asking questions.

[01:48] And Jersey Jack himself dialed into the show and hung out with everybody for what seemed like over an hour and just answered everybody's questions about the game.

[01:59] He didn't hold back.

[02:00] He gave us a lot of information about Wonka, about some pirates of the Caribbean news and some other news regarding Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:08] And the reason why I think it was a special night is you know that this hobby always boils down to one thing.

[02:15] It boils down to one thing, the people.

[02:17] And it's fun hanging out with people and geeking out over Pinball.

[02:22] You know, I've always said this.

[02:24] I think Pinball is really fun to play.

[02:26] But without the people, this hobby would be boring.

[02:30] Right? If you just had a game in your apartment and you just played by yourself, and that's all it was, right?

[02:34] And you didn't have the ability to go online and chat with people about Pinball, it would be boring.

[02:39] If you didn't have friends who wanted to come over and play with you, it would be boring.

[02:43] It's just a static toy.

[02:46] And yeah, you bring it to life by playing it, but it's the other people in the hobby that really make it fun to be part of the Pinball community.

[02:54] And so it was like a sort of like an amalgamation, a gathering together of a lot of different personalities, a lot of you from Pinside, a lot of you, outspoken gentleman out there.

[03:06] And we were going back and forth. It gets sarcastic. Sometimes it feels like it starts to get a little personal, but it's never really personal.

[03:13] And I think it was great. So here's the big takeaway for you who weren't a part of it.

[03:18] You can watch it on YouTube. I think flipping out uploads it to their YouTube channel.

[03:23] But here's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about Willy Wonka.

[03:26] And I want to talk about what we learned with Willy Wonka from Jersey Jack Pinball last night.

[03:32] Okay, so we learned the following. They asked Jack straight up, what are the deal with the assets in the game?

[03:40] What's the deal with the video and the audio in the game? Are we going to see synchronized voice actors occurring during their video sequences?

[03:50] Now, here's what I want to say.

[03:52] You know, Jack gives answers that sometimes make you wonder what exactly is the answer.

[03:58] So he said there is lots of video and sound synced up in the game. So he gave that answer.

[04:06] If you go watch it, he says that specifically. He then also said something that really, really was interesting when he did it.

[04:13] Because you could just see the look on Bill Ken and Steve's faces when he said this.

[04:18] But Jack said, and I quote paraphrase maybe a little bit, but he basically said the game is done that this game is done.

[04:27] And I think what he meant by that because then he went back later on and said, well, you know, have we ever, you know, just finished a game and that's it when we've shipped it or have we continued to polish a game over time?

[04:40] And we all know the answer to that that Jersey Jack doesn't just, you know, ship a game, finish code and we're never going to see more in the game.

[04:49] But I guess here's what I want to talk about when I talk about this. I just want to say right now that it's pointless.

[04:56] It is pointless beating a dead horse over the issues with the assets in this game.

[05:03] And I came to this realization last night and I think all of you out there should also come to this realization.

[05:09] This game is pretty far along. If you enjoy it the way it is now and this game is a game that excites you, it's a theme that you're, you know, into that you love a lot.

[05:21] If it's a game that you enjoy shooting, go buy it. If you enjoy it that much, I think that's the only thing you can do is jump on this game and see if it's a game for you.

[05:32] If you love Willy Wonka and you wanted a game in which you progressed through the chocolate factory, in which you hear all the songs from the movie, in which the musical of Willy Wonka, the film comes to life in the pinball machine in a more mode based way.

[05:48] This is never going to be the game for you. And I think that's just where we're at. You just have to make up your mind on whether or not this game and its approach delivers to you what you want.

[06:01] From a pinball experience and there's a lot going on in this game from toys from mex from sounds from lights from shot from geometries. You know there's all these things going on in the game from the LCD.

[06:14] So all you can do and if I've learned anything after 365 episodes of Canadian pinball podcast all you can do is decide whether or not it's the right game for you.

[06:27] You know people ask me why you still in on the collector's edition. And you know as if that matters on whether or not you'll like the game but I think it does matter to people out there who do value my opinion and want to know what what am I going to do.

[06:42] Well here's the thing. Here's the thing is right now the way the game currently stands the way the code is in the game.

[06:52] I am not as excited about Willy Wonka the way I was when I first flipped it because I thought the code would go in a different direction.

[07:02] And you know me I like story narrative driven pinball machines I like to feel like I'm progressing through a narrative and I don't get that sense when I watch the stream of Willy Wonka but here's my dilemma.

[07:18] Okay because Brenda loves the theme and Brenda said she really wants to try and play it again so if Brenda loves this game we're going to get a Willy Wonka because happy wife happy life but also want you know I want there to be a mixture of games and I think the reason why Brenda really liked Willy Wonka it's really easy to things it's easy to understand and jump into the game.

[07:42] It's also easy to hit some of the shots that are really rewarding you know it's harder for people who are casual players to enjoy some of these games that require too much precision or the games are very clunky and wonka shoots so nice whether you're a great player or a new player to pinball it shoots buttery smooth.

[08:04] And also the ball times are not that long so you're not like standing there watching someone play for a really long time now I will say when I watch the stream I still can't help but like I can't help but think like what what are we actually doing in this game like what what is happening like what what's the objective I mean they they were playing last night and I will say nothing got spoiled last night because Ken Bill and Steve they were putting up some pretty brutal games they weren't really going deep into the game itself.

[08:32] So that is a big update that this is kind of how the game is going to be don't expect it to have any radical changes so I don't think you're going to see like the root assaults in and I don't think you're going to see you know the scenes from each room come to life with the voice actors talking and even if it's not the songs you know there's just there's not going to be that there's not going to be any of that sort of you know scenes for the movie coming out in the pinball machine now I saw people on the the twitch stream line.

[09:02] I was like last night saying stuff like you know it's not it's not a big deal like you play the game you don't watch the clips and I don't know I disagree imagine a game like Batman 66 and remove all the clips from that game and then what do you have I think it is a big deal and I think in pinball here's where we're at it's really hard apparently to get the licensing agreement in place to get the right assets to then be able to use the game.

[09:32] I think it's really hard to use all of the things you would want to have in the pinball game and I could go two ways on this right I could complain about this or I could just accept it for that's just the way it is and that is just the way it is the the apparently if you want more you got to pay more and I had a great conversation with the gentleman last night and we were going back and forth on the thread and it seemed like it was getting a little heated he called into the show which is also a great part of what they do.

[10:02] After they stream they have a call in period in which you can call in live and talk to them and it's on twitch it's awesome I freaking love it it's so much more fun and productive and engaging then pinside bickering or just you know listening to a podcast but it's it's like real time this gentleman jobber his name jobber I don't know it has a last part but it's a jobber a ruge we were going back and forth and he actually worked on it.

[10:32] He worked in licensing and was giving me a lot of insights after I was like jabbing at him that's not how the contracts were back when Wonka was made but the truth is he's right you know it's expensive you just can't get all the rights and the assets to these films unless you pony up the dollars now here's the thing none of us know none of us know actually how much it would have cost for them to get all the stuff that you would want in the game and they have to you know they have to do a balancing act of how much can I put in a game

[11:01] how much do I how many games do I expect to sell so for example if it was $500,000 to get all the songs in the game that you want and all the voice clips synced up with the video let's say it's half a million dollars more if they're anticipating to sell 5,000 Willy Wonka's then that's only a hundred dollars per game now my whole thing is this and this is just how I would always do it I would put everything that I know people would want in a game

[11:30] I know it's easy to say this because I'm not running a business but almost irregardless of cost and then I would cost the game what it needs to be or price it what it needs to be because I think I would sell way more if it gave everybody what they wanted

[11:47] because I think when you remove those things and they're not in there hello like no no Ripley and Alien right when you remove those things I think you lose a lot of customers

[12:27] you want it or the musical songs from Willy Wonka so you know that's what we learned yesterday okay so another thing we learned all right so this is it I would jump on the gameplay another thing we learned is that

[12:39] Pirates of the Caribbean will not be remade this year okay not coming out again anytime this year so Jack did not rule out in fact he kind of said they're going to remake it one day

[12:54] he said what's the next letter after Q and it's like all right so the reality is pirates parts need to be ordered for them to rerun it

[13:04] it takes about six months to order all those parts and get them in whether or not Jersey Jack has ordered those parts is up for debate nobody really knows it'd be stupid for Jack to start talking about pirates I mean even when people ask I get people are

[13:19] loving the game but he's his focus is on Wonka his focus is on selling the game that's on the line now and here's the other bit of news that's that's exciting the LEDs of Wonka are on the line now so if you have an

[13:33] L.E. of Wonka in early L.E. you're about to get your game soon you know the only big difference really is is the artwork on the cabinet and then you get the

[13:41] Wonka Vator the Wonka Vator multi-ball that carries over to the next game I have to say this I have to say this I can't really understand all the talk about the

[13:53] Wonka Vator I'll tell you why I rarely see it in action in a game and this whole carrying over multi-ball is to the next game it seems to me the

[14:02] Wonka Vator seems a lot like the hyper loop in Star Wars it's not utilized enough it's not easy enough to lock balls in that

[14:09] Wonka Vator for something to make more of an impact I think you need to see it implement it more frequently and I'd always

[14:17] frustrates me in pinball when you have something that's supposed to be a somewhat impactful thing in the game but then you make it

[14:23] really really difficult to engage it and be a part of the experience because the Wonka Vator is cool it takes up all that

[14:29] real estate in the upper left and I don't if you're making a game for casual people on location I don't think you make that

[14:36] Wonka Vator so difficult to be a part of the experience nothing kills me more than I've played Star Wars so many times on

[14:43] location so many times at sunshine and I rarely ever even see the hyper loop in action and it's like it's there it's like

[14:52] it takes up all the real estate it's like the thing you want to see happen but yet it never happens so so bad so

[14:58] bad to make it like that like every game if you play five games of a pinball machine in a row you should see

[15:04] everything somewhat going on and activated in the game or else I think it's a missed opportunity okay so so

[15:12] we know that you know pirates is not coming back this year he wants you to focus on on Wonka here's the other

[15:18] big news when asked directly will we see another Jersey Jack game this year his answer was yes you will

[15:26] holy cow do you know where the F you are you're in the jungle baby wake up time to die right so we're going to see

[15:35] guns and roses sometime this year and that is most likely going to be around October November right

[15:42] because if you're going to show a game and you know Jersey Jack has got it down now where they can show a game

[15:47] and ship a game within a couple months of reveal it makes total sense to show G and R sometimes in the fall

[15:55] to get people their games by the holidays lots of debate I had with people around guns and roses and

[16:01] their popularity and how well the pin would do I don't know man I I love guns and roses I think a lot of people do

[16:09] and I also think guns and roses you know the old pinball machine from daddy East was incredible

[16:14] but imagine a modern G and R with modern sound the one thing I hope the one thing I hope I really hope this

[16:22] more than anything I don't want to see like old chubby Sam kinesen Axe Rose on the machine I don't want to see

[16:29] like current guns and roses because as much as I love G and R you know Axel has not taken care of himself

[16:36] he's not aged well he looks like you know someone to like the mom from goonies which is kind of true

[16:42] and you know it's just not that's not the guns and roses that I want to be immortalized on a pinball machine

[16:49] it's just not I heard it has like 22 songs which is cool you know guns and roses libraries amazing I mean for those of you out there I mean there's no

[16:57] there's no way people are not going to enjoy flipping the kind of you know guns and roses it's that high energy music that's perfect for pin

[17:04] I also hope they have an unreleased track only in the pinball machine the way we got it back in the day remember there's a song called

[17:10] ain't going down that never was released by guns and roses the only place in the planet you could hear it was in the pinball machine

[17:17] I doubt will see it because no way Axel gives slash permission to use one of his unreleased Chinese democracy songs

[17:25] all right but maybe they do crash diet which is a really amazing song just just YouTube guns and roses crash diet

[17:31] a great song from back in the day they never officially released okay so guns and roses all right so we know that

[17:39] all right so it's like really awesome that Jack came in and talked with the fans for such a long period of time

[17:45] and that leads me to another point about you know ultimately look we could look at everything and complain about like what's not in a pinball game

[17:54] or we could look at the amount of pinball games that are available in 2019 and just be thankful that we have all this stuff out there for us the buyer to choose from

[18:05] and you know look it it weighs you down it gets stressful it gets annoying to always cling to the negative side of the hobby

[18:17] now I do believe games could improve I do believe pinball magic isn't found very frequently I do think that all games are fun I think the whole thing

[18:28] well it's fun like I always think that's a fallback excuse and I don't tell you why because all pinballs fun it is you could have fun flipping team pinballs

[18:36] the mafia you could it's all about how you approach it right it's never been about like whether or not pinballs fun or not for me

[18:44] it's been about like whether or not the magic and this game is you know there's one word that I think equals a magical pinball game

[18:53] and I got to give credit where credits do mr. rare hero Greg Greg Holton always tells me this he's like what really separates you know just a fun pinball game from one that's a classic is there is an orchestration happening

[19:07] that everything comes together beautifully and it's a dance it is a dance between the code between the lights between the shots between the music between the callouts

[19:18] I mean it's really really hard and it seems easy as a as a spectator as a buyer being like well why couldn't they just like poured over this into this

[19:28] sometimes when I play Batman 66 I am just floored and blown away by the amount of work it must have taken lineman sheets to do everything that's happening in that game I mean just play Batman for five minutes and look at the way all of the clips the shots the sound the callouts all of it connects it connects in a way that works it doesn't

[19:55] feel disjoint it it doesn't feel like slap together it's just a beautiful orchestra and lineman sheets is probably the greatest conductor in the history of pinball he is he's the greatest conductor in the history of pinball

[20:10] and he knows had design and experience that is unforgettable and I think as we look at Jersey Jack and as we look at deep route and we look at stern and we look at spooky

[20:21] we so often fall back on critiquing stuff like art and stuff like you know shot geometry and everything else but ultimately you know for a game to become a classic classic it needs to be orchestrated properly

[20:38] and you know very few games do that but it's but that's why we love this hobby because we're always hoping that the next game is going to be the one that puts all the pieces together the way we want to see the pieces put together

[20:50] and I love pinball because of that and nothing's ever going to be perfect right and that's why we're still in it right because if if if if if there were like 10 perfect games in a row there be no need for more

[21:00] and so it is almost pinball imperfections that drives the conversation you know it's almost pinballes you know misses or near near perfect shots that always keep us sort of like hoping and praying that someone you know around the corner will figure it out

[21:18] right so I just want to say thank you to Jack thank you to Ken Bill and Steve thank you thank you to all those who contributed to that stream last night and thank you to Zach to pin stadium I mean it was like an awesome awesome night and and I'll say you know it's it's great to have fun like that I'm probably going to get killed by Brenda a little bit because I said I'm only going to watch for 30 minutes and it was like three hours later I'm still you know engage with with this audience and this community

[21:46] and almost made me feel like I don't really need to go to a pinball show to like have three hours of amazing banter with you guys you know so look great night I think you need to jump on a wanka it's done ish it's done ish I'll call that this episode that that wonka is done ish there might be more to come all right what else is going on so how do I think wanka is going to sell I think it'll be fine again I think most people who buy these things are not looking at these things under a magnifying glass

[22:15] the way so many of us are okay now I was looking around and pins that I'm like what else is going on like what people talking about and then I saw the deep root thread and it seems like there was a deep root article that went up on this weekend pinball and now it's down and Jeff is having complications

[22:32] oh something I haven't talked about was was Jeff lied to by Jersey Jack pinball if you've been following this story Jeff as Jack straight up are Willy Wonka's on the line and Jack did not tell him yes so Jeff kept reporting that Willy Wonka is not on the line and that Jack told him they were not on the line last night Jack said well Willy Wonka is coming out like by summer so you figure it out I don't know which one is going to be on the line

[23:00] so you figure it out I don't know which is which look I've implored Jeff don't take it personally lying to the pinball media is not a crime against humanity Jack was probably just trying to surprise everybody yes he easily could have said no comment he didn't have to maybe spin and make Jeff feel like he was getting a mistruth and if that is the case I think it's unfortunate but let's just bury that hatchet and move on because it's not a big deal

[23:29] it really isn't a big deal and Jeff you know I love you brother and I always tell this to Jeff our credibility as pinball journalists it's kind of a funny thing it doesn't really matter I mean we're right sometimes we're wrong sometimes it's who cares like I always say like who cares who cares if like we report on something and it's accurate who cares if we report on something and it's not accurate none of these pinball companies are publicly trade it

[23:57] manufacturers do not give us a lot of early access to stuff and we are not treated like normal journalists would be treated in other industries okay and I'm okay with that they know that we're just doing this for entertainment value it's not a serious topic that needs to be approached with any real serious journalistic integrity it's not it's pinball come on come on people anyway but I've been reading the deep route threat

[24:25] and there was a trip article about deep route that seemingly is now down it's somewhere lost I think Jeff is working on the site I know the site was crashing when I was trying to go on it a few days ago but it's back up again but there's more and more conversation about deep route now look deep roots time is running out to make a big impact and by that I don't mean like running out running out I mean they're just they're they're they're running into when they have to show the game they're showing it in Houston and it's just a few months away

[24:55] right what seemed like years ago in which they announced their plans to take over the pinball world last year at expo remember a year ago at expo they told us this year they'd ship more games and any manufacturer in the history and to people out there who have followed the whole J pop scandal this whole thing is looked eerily familiar to all the other pinball failures that have taken place now we're not I'm not saying deep roots gonna fail but they did everything a little backwards in terms of you talk

[25:25] first you show artwork you tell people what you're gonna do before you actually do it what was the point of all that like what was the point like

[25:32] quad manufacturing octo manufacturing we're gonna make more games than stern we're gonna do this we're gonna do that we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna right it just gets old like just do it

[25:43] they just do it like Nike says just do it you know people respect those who do more and say less and that is why I think

[25:55] people look at deep root with a little bit of like an iRoll and then I'm in the thread and it's like Ben hex says something and then Robert Mueller likes is like stick to your last

[26:05] Ben like kind of going after him and I just think nobody at deep root should be on pinside defending the company or saying stuff or

[26:15] lighting a fire or making threats or saying you know why why why do we get this like trickle out of like art why do we need

[26:24] any of this so all see here's the thing now because now all the pressure is on them to deliver something that makes all of that

[26:33] hyperbole worth it so you have to ask yourself they must know they have something that's gonna blow people away or they

[26:42] are they're going to deliver something that might be the laughing stock of the pinball industry and even if they

[26:49] show something that blows people away the other question will be can they manufacture the game and get it to people if they get

[26:57] hundreds if not thousands of orders there's a reason why stern is set up the way they're set up 350 employees at stern pinball

[27:07] working every day to send pinball around the globe now deeper does indicated they will make more games than that so how do you

[27:16] beat a company that has 350 employees who have been doing this for decades who know how to build these games like clockwork how do you beat them

[27:26] when you haven't made a single game ever right it starts to get a little comical when you break it down like that that I mean deep roots

[27:34] a startup versus a jug or not now look I mean in many industries new companies have uprooted uprooted deep roots the how the you know

[27:45] the incumbent like the the market leader right so will stern look like blockbuster and will deep root look like netflix when this is all said and done

[27:54] I don't think so I'll tell you why it's just still got to be pinball it's still has to be pinball you know there's only so much you can adjust on these games

[28:02] that is going to like still make it feel like pinball like we've seen people overreach and and try to do too much but from everything we're hearing it's gonna be pinball

[28:11] I'm not worried I'm not worried that you know that deep roots gonna come out with something that's so radically different than pinball people are not going to be attracted to it

[28:20] everything I've heard you know they've got a big mechanism they've got crazy ramps but the cabinet looks like a pinball machine

[28:26] the emphasis is on artwork and the cabinets and you're not going to see like some radically different like design of a cabinet or an approach to a pinball machine

[28:35] I think they're trying to make it so there's a less soldering in the game or as little as possible which amen to that

[28:41] and I think they're going to focus a lot to like you know putting the magic on the playfield and reliability and the ease of working on these games because I think pinball machines are a nightmare for most people to lift the hood on okay

[28:55] all right so we'll see we'll see so here we are July

[28:59] do you believe me that Stern's gonna show new game at Comic Con I think it's gonna happen I definitely think that is going to occur

[29:06] and so what have I learned after 365 episodes of the Canadian Spinball podcast well a few things a few things

[29:14] number one is always you have to play the game and make up your mind on it don't listen to anyone else's opinion on a game

[29:19] okay number two I think a lot of manufacturers out there do very little market research to understand what the appetite is for the game

[29:29] they're gonna make and I see it happen time and time again and I think it's unfortunate I'll tell you why because you know if you did just a little bit of the pre

[29:38] work it would make everything else so much more effective so stuff like how do you not just screen with the focus group the artwork on

[29:47] October fest to see if people like it or not and then if they don't just redo it it's not the hardest thing to redo but I think there's you know

[29:53] there's some of that just continues to mind boggle me in this hobby I think the hardest thing though for me is this and this is not for me

[30:01] I mean this is just like the third thing that I just am always sort of like thinking about why is it so much different now than it was

[30:08] back then to get it all right and I and here's where I'm landing on this the problem today is back in the day you could put a game on

[30:18] location and test it and let people play it get feedback go back work on it and you didn't have to worry about

[30:27] spoiling the reveal of the game there was no internet back then there was no pen side back then there was no way

[30:36] to like snap a photo of something and immediately the whole world like new about it and then all of a sudden your big

[30:42] plans to like reveal it were spoiled you know that they were able to build stuff put it out in the world test it quality control it

[30:50] and not release it until it was ready to be released and they didn't have to worry about all the dialogue and

[30:58] conversation and complaining and and they don't worry about you know even even not selling well because people have

[31:05] already seen it or spoiling the plans of the reveal because that's just the way the world was back then and I

[31:11] think nowadays it's so hard for these manufacturers to test games to test stuff on location because you get one shot at

[31:20] creating a hype window to get sales for your game and because of that a lot of these games are built in silos they're

[31:28] built in vacuums they're built in privacy and by the time the world gets the game it's it's either like good enough or

[31:37] like never going to make it like you're either dead on arrival with your game or your game is going to find buyers you know and it and we've

[31:44] seen it I mean we've seen this happen with like look what happened like pirates of the Caribbean I mean again that had so much hype a

[31:51] year later it's like dead on arrival I mean the game was not selling well when it finally was on the line and we see games like

[31:59] October fest where you know you reveal the game six months go by you give people six months to think about it and you

[32:06] don't really change the one thing that people were like oh it needs to be better and there's like there's like that's the fourth

[32:13] thing I want to say is like there's just a level of stubbornness in this hobby by the people who create these things that is you know is

[32:22] somewhat necessary right this combination of my vision my design this is my game versus like what do people want and who is you

[32:31] know who actually gets to set the final agenda for what a game will be in the end you know it's like I look at it like you need to

[32:42] stand over a game at some point and say is this the best we could do is this the best we could do with what we had to

[32:51] work with and we know right in all of the years we've been a part of this hobby the best we have to work with

[32:57] sometimes might be a little limiting in terms of the assets you have in terms of the art you have in terms of the

[33:03] speech or the callouts but if you stand over a game even with the limitations and you say this is the best we could

[33:13] make with what we have if you put your heart and soul into it if you applied all of your passion into it and you gave it

[33:22] the best I do believe that you will have a great game at the end of that conversation with yourself like you will you will stand

[33:31] over a game and people will also see the passion in it and I think parts of the Caribbean is sort of you know I've sort of

[33:38] changed my tune a little bit about that game I mean I think that's when you look at people's reviews of the game I think they see

[33:44] that they did the absolute best with what they had I think with Willie Wonka I don't know people are going to feel the same

[33:51] way about Wonka in like a few months the way they do about pirates right do you think Wonka is going to keep gaining in popularity or will start to

[33:58] fizzle out where pirates did the complete opposite it was an upward trajectory of how excited people were feeling about the game so we'll see time won't

[34:07] tell I don't know it's too early to tell right so I think to like the final point is this all right and then I got to get I mean I'm just sort of

[34:15] ram I have no notes I don't do notes anymore the easiest company to pick on is Stern Pimball Stern Pimball is the greatest

[34:23] Pimball company of all time and and I mean that when I say that it's easy to look at you know the Valley Williams titles do I

[34:32] think they were better yes do I think they were more magical yes where is Valley Williams today where are they

[34:38] what have they done for you lately nothing they decided to close the Pimball business okay Stern

[34:45] Pimball is the greatest Pimball company in history because they've survived throughout history and yes their games some of

[34:53] them are great some of them are mediocre some of them are like whatever yes they charge a lot more money than I think some of

[35:02] those games are worth but what would this hobby be like without them you know it's easy to look at Stern and nitpick but I look at

[35:11] Stern and I've covered them now for a few years and I've seen Stern out of all the companies out there I see Stern as the

[35:19] company that listens the most and makes the most changes and gives people what they want more often than any

[35:29] other Pimball company they do and it's easy to like try and sort of you know discard that and just say well no they

[35:38] haven't like they've been like they've taken out the cabinet practice and there's like you know ghosted

[35:43] inserts and there's like you know playfields like have like dimples and you know what do you think that they

[35:50] are not trying to give you like the best Pimball experience of course they are 350 people are going

[35:57] into Stern Pimball every day trying to give people the most fun Pimball experience they have now you know

[36:04] look look you know and Stern is not really engaged with the community on a level that some of you would like and by

[36:12] that I mean they're not on Pinside they're not they're not in the weeds of like the obsessive people and that's actually a smart

[36:19] marketing decision because they know something that a lot of people don't want to just like realize is that the

[36:26] majority of people who buy stern Pimball games are not on Pinside they're just normal people who want a fun Pimball

[36:33] game most of those people wouldn't really know if the code isn't complete most of those people wouldn't really

[36:40] know that the cabinets don't have metal brackets and that's that you know you need those most people

[36:47] wouldn't know what a dimple is most people would never in a million years freak out over a hairline ghosted

[36:55] insert right most people would never in a million years look at a post by a sling that has a little like ripple

[37:03] effect happening and start to freak out and go on the internet and complain to all their friends about

[37:08] the possibilities of their play field cracking 95% of people who enjoy Pimball that that doesn't bother them

[37:15] they wouldn't even know about it now this is not me giving them immunity for poor quality control at all

[37:22] it's not but i just want to say like without stern uh this hobby would be really boring

[37:28] and the two companies that i'm really excited to see go back and forth are stern and jersey jack

[37:34] absolutely i love the way these two companies push each other to make the product better and i

[37:39] love spooky Pimball i think out of all the people out there spooky Pimball is like the one company

[37:46] that actually like grew properly that actually grew properly they bid off as much as they could chew

[37:53] during each iteration of the company the company has a vol the company product has has

[38:00] has become better and better with each release there's been hurdles there's been internal drama

[38:05] there's been fighting you know there's been bickering but they've delivered time and time again

[38:11] right and that's great so jersey jack spooky and stern Pimball right and then Chicago gaming

[38:20] on top of that giving you the old games that used to cost a fortune and giving you them in a modernized

[38:26] contemporary way what a great time to be in Pimball with just those four entities there
