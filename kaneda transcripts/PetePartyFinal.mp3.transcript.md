[00:00] It took 42 years to write and about four minutes to sing.

[00:06] So...

[00:07] I got the call today that I didn't want to hear, but I knew that it was done.

[00:31] Oh, truth and the lies were stuck on the phone.

[00:38] She said she found someone.

[00:45] And I thought of all the bad ones, and struggles we went through.

[00:57] And I lost me and you lost you.

[01:04] But are these voices outside of the door?

[01:09] Because no one found me and picked me up in the morning.

[01:16] I'm learning to live with you now.

[01:24] But I miss you sometimes.

[01:28] But no one knew that I understand.

[01:33] Oh, I knew that I knew I'm learning again.

[01:39] And I'm trying to get down.

[01:42] You know the heart of the matter, but my way will get to you.

[01:48] And I thought you were scared of what I think it's about.

[01:52] Look in this.

[01:55] Look in this.

[01:57] Even it, even it.

[02:00] You don't love me anymore.

[02:05] Oh, these times are so unsubbed,

[02:16] they're the yearning undefined,

[02:19] and people filled with rage.

[02:24] And we all need a little tenderness,

[02:28] how can love survive in such a placeless age?

[02:36] I'm a trust and self-ashore,

[02:39] that I need to happen it's with the hurtings we kill,

[02:46] I guess I'll cry and competition,

[02:51] cannot feel these happy arms,

[02:54] and the work I put between us.

[02:57] You know it doesn't keep me warm.

[03:01] I'm learning to live without you now.

[03:08] But I miss you baby.

[03:12] And more I know that I understand.

[03:17] Oh, I know that I feel I'm figuring out.

[03:20] I have to learn again.

[03:23] I've been trying to get down to the heart of the man

[03:28] but you can do everything changes.

[03:32] And my friends you've got to,

[03:34] but I think it's about forgiveness.

[03:39] Forgiveness, even it, even it.

[03:43] You don't love me anymore.

[03:51] There are people in your life who are coming wrong.

[03:57] They let you down.

[04:00] You know they hurt you, Brian.

[04:04] You better put it all behind your back.

[04:07] Cause life goes on if you carry that anger.

[04:12] It'll eat you up inside, baby.

[04:15] I'm trying to get down to the heart of the man.

[04:20] But I'm over it against me.

[04:24] And my thoughts even scatter,

[04:26] but I think it's about forgiveness.

[04:31] Forgiveness, even it, even it.

[04:35] You don't love me anymore.

[04:39] I've been trying to get down to the heart of the man.

[04:44] Because the flesh will get weak.

[04:47] And the ashes must get us all thinking about.

[04:51] Forgiveness, even it, even it.

[04:58] You don't love me anymore.

[05:03] Forgiveness, even it.

[05:07] She's a pretty good woman.

[05:11] I know she's a mother of truth.

[05:15] She's a mother of truth.

[05:19] She's a pretty good woman.

[05:22] She's crazy about it.

[05:24] All this is what I was supposed to say.

[05:28] And it will be a good future.

[05:33] It's morning,

[05:39] and the sun of the freeway.

[05:45] Running in the yard,

[05:48] and I'm a bad boy.

[05:51] Cause you don't even miss her.

[06:17] Free for him.

[06:23] Another time passed.

[06:26] Walking through the valley,

[06:32] and the venture will rise.

[06:35] Another bad boy.

[06:38] He's standing in a shadow,

[06:41] and the good girls

[06:44] are all with broken hearts.

[06:47] And I'm free.

[06:51] Free for him.

[06:57] One day, yeah.

[07:03] Free for him.

[08:41] She gave me some weights.

[08:44] With my head going on her.

[08:47] How many days did I spend trying to see it go away?

[08:51] If you try, you'll remember.

[08:54] I changed and changed.

[40:32] He's so tall and handsome as hell.

[40:35] He's so bad but he does it so well.

[40:39] And when we've had our very last kiss, my last request...

[40:45] Stay over and out my name.

[40:49] Standing in a nice, first staring at the sun.

[40:53] His head says, hey, bad legs and rosy jeans.

[40:56] Say you'll see me up again even if it's just in your heart.

[41:02] One, dream on.

[41:07] One, one, dream on.

[41:26] Nobody here, knocking at my door.

[41:32] The sound of sight and talking, taking more.

[41:39] Nobody bringing my telephone out.

[41:45] Oh, how I miss such a beautiful sound.

[41:51] And I don't even know how I survive.

[41:58] I won't make it to the shore without your light.

[42:04] No, I don't even know if I'm alive.

[42:10] Oh, without you now, this is what I feel like.

[42:27] I feel my way through the darkness.

[42:32] Got it by beating hard.

[42:37] I can't tell where the journey will end.

[42:42] I can't tell where the journey will end.

[42:47] I can't tell where the journey will end.

[42:53] I can't tell where the journey will end.

[42:57] But I know where the stars tell me I'm too young to understand.

[43:04] And say I'm caught up in a dream.

[43:08] Well, life will pass by if I don't open up my eyes.

[43:12] So that's fine by me.

[43:15] So wake me up when it's all over.

[43:19] When I'm wise I ran out of mold.

[43:23] All this time I was finding myself in love.

[43:28] Didn't know I was lost.

[43:31] So wake me up when it's all over.

[43:35] When I'm wise I ran out of mold.

[43:39] All this time I was finding myself in love.

[43:44] Didn't know I was lost.

[43:49] I can't tell where the journey will end.

[43:54] But I know where the journey will end.

[43:59] I can't tell where the journey will end.

[44:29] So that's fine by me.

[44:59] Waiting for love, waiting for love

[45:03] Play with the stars this Friday

[45:05] I'm burning like a firegun

[45:07] Wild on Saturday

[45:09] Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday

[45:13] I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love

[45:17] To cover up

[45:29] ��

[45:52] It's hot

[45:54] That you settled down that you found a girl and you married now

[46:08] I love that you would use games to get you things

[46:17] I love you to you

[46:22] Oh, hey, why are you so shy?

[46:28] Ain't like who you are, you're the best

[46:32] Oh, right from the line

[46:36] I hate to turn out bad for the one by the back

[46:41] And stay with me, I put my fight out

[46:44] You took it to see my face, and let you feel it

[46:47] And let's not, it doesn't know

[46:53] So let me find a fine, so I like you

[46:59] I wish nothing were the best for you

[47:06] Don't forget me, no thanks

[47:10] I'll be in bed for you to stay

[47:14] So let me find a way to stay

[47:21] So let me find a way to stay

[47:28] I'm going on during this time of year, there's no one to say even

[47:42] There's no endothin' really, go the way you're driving me crazy

[47:50] I need somebody, I hear somebody too long

[47:55] Somebody, I hear somebody too long

[47:59] It's easy to say, but it's never safe

[48:03] I guess I can't let go where you know the pain

[48:07] Love the day, please, it's a nightfall

[48:11] In your Lord, he is again before it all

[48:14] I let him on God down, and then you pull the rug

[48:18] I was getting cut and used to being so well you love so much

[48:23] I was getting cut and used to being so well you love so much

[48:30] Love the day, please, it's a nightfall

[48:34] In your Lord, he is again before it all

[48:38] I let him on God down, and then you pull the rug

[48:42] I was getting cut and used to being so well you love so much

[48:47] I'm going on during this time of year, there's no one to turn into

[48:54] There's no endothin' really, go the way you're driving me sleepin' without you

[49:00] I need somebody, I hear somebody too long

[49:05] Somebody, I hear somebody too long

[49:07] It's easy to say, but it's never safe

[49:13] I guess I can't let go where you help me escape

[49:16] Love the day, please, it's a nightfall

[49:20] In your Lord, he is again before it all

[49:24] I let him on God down, and then you pull the rug

[49:28] I was getting cut and used to being so well you love

[49:33] In eyes and the clouds blind

[49:36] He's letting her, sometimes I fall into your arms

[49:42] I'll be safe in your soul to look back around

[49:47] For love the day, please, it's a nightfall

[49:51] In your Lord, he is again before it all

[49:55] I let him on God down, and then you pull the rug

[49:59] I was getting cut and used to being so well you love so much

[50:03] I'm going on during this time of year, there's no one to turn into

[50:07] There's no endothin' really, go the way you're driving me sleepin'

[50:11] Love the day, please, it's a nightfall

[50:14] In your Lord, he is again before it all

[50:17] I let him on God down, and then you pull the rug

[50:20] I was getting cut and used to being so well you love so well you love so much

[50:25] Once upon a young year, when all our shadows disappeared

[50:30] The animals inside came out to play

[50:34] When face to face with all our fears

[50:37] Learned our lessons through the tears

[50:39] And then slip away, it should be in his arms I heard him say

[50:44] You get older, you wow, I will live for your good days

[50:48] Think it's ever your face

[50:51] He said one day, you live this world behind

[50:55] Forever live, you will remember

[50:59] My father told me when I was just a child

[51:03] These are the nights to never die

[51:06] My father told me

[51:37] I lose myself tonight

[51:41] It'll be by your side

[51:44] I lose myself tonight

[51:51] I lose myself tonight

[51:55] It'll be you and I

[51:58] I lose myself tonight

[52:05] I woke up with the sun

[52:27] Thought of all other people places and things I've loved

[52:35] I woke up just to see

[52:41] With all of the faces you were the one next to me

[52:48] You can feel the light and start to tremble

[52:51] Watch on what you know, I hope to see it

[52:55] You can see your life, I hope you will know you tonight

[53:02] I lose myself tonight

[53:07] It'll be by your side

[53:10] I lose myself tonight

[53:15] I lose myself tonight

[53:32] I lose myself tonight

[53:52] There we go

[54:02] There we go

[54:33] My darling, my darling

[54:44] I've hungered more your touch

[54:51] Alone, lonely time

[55:02] And time goes by so slowly

[55:12] And time can do so much

[55:19] All you do is still more

[55:31] I need your love

[55:38] I need your love

[55:45] God, spare your love to me

[56:02] Come up to me, you tell me I'm sorry

[56:06] You don't know how I love you

[56:11] I have to find you

[56:13] Tell you I need you

[56:15] Tell you I said she apart

[56:20] Tell me because you miss me a quick kiss

[56:24] Now let's go back to the side

[56:29] But it's a good call and pay your debt

[56:34] Don't stop apart

[56:38] Nobody said it was easy

[56:42] It's such a shame for us to part

[56:47] Nobody said it was easy

[56:52] No one ever said it was easy

[56:56] No one ever said it was easy

[57:01] It's such a shame for us to part

[57:06] I'll take you back to the start

[57:11] I was just getting the numbers and fingers

[57:16] Pulling your cards open to part

[57:21] Questions and science, science and progress

[57:25] Love me, come back to the home

[57:29] All I run through the start

[57:33] Run inside the coast to tell you

[57:38] Come back as we are

[57:42] Nobody said it was easy

[57:47] It's such a shame for us to part

[57:51] Nobody said it was easy

[57:56] No one ever said it was easy

[58:01] I'm going back to the start

[58:16] Now maybe

[58:20] I didn't want to be too cheap

[58:24] But I didn't anyway

[58:27] And then maybe

[58:30] So I'm going to say it like we say

[58:34] But you lived it anyway

[58:37] And so maybe

[58:40] Your friends stand around you

[58:42] Why'd you come home

[58:45] As you fall down to the ground

[58:48] And then someday

[58:51] Your friends stand beside you

[58:53] Of flying

[58:55] Oh, you were flying out so high

[58:58] But then someday people look at you

[59:01] They're worth the call

[59:03] They're only one to yourself all

[59:06] Yeah, you're going home

[59:09] And someday we could take our time

[59:12] To brush the leaves

[59:14] And start to carry dust

[59:17] And watch you let me fall behind

[59:20] No, may, may, may, may

[59:24] And did a ring to treat you less over

[59:28] But I didn't anyway

[59:30] And all the time, I may, may, may, may

[59:34] So I'm going to say it like we say

[59:37] But you lived it anyway

[59:41] And I'm now

[59:45] Couldn't share the pain

[59:47] And watch you suffer

[59:50] Mm-hmm

[59:52] Now maybe

[59:56] Could it make my own mistakes

[01:00:00] But I live far enough

[01:00:03] And then maybe

[01:00:06] We might share in something

[01:00:08] We want you to look at where we're grown

[01:00:11] And then someday

[01:00:14] Comes to my real holds

[01:00:16] Sense of what I feel

[01:00:18] You're in my mind

[01:00:21] As a trip to final Iron

[01:00:24] And that cold day

[01:00:25] When you lost control

[01:00:27] Shame you left my life

[01:00:29] Sissor when you said it told me

[01:00:31] Hey, what do you love me for me?

[01:00:34] Hey, yeah, now may, may, may, may

[01:00:39] And did a ring to treat you less over

[01:00:42] But I'm all I did anyway

[01:00:45] And I'm now

[01:00:47] Hey, yeah, may, may, may

[01:00:49] So I'm going to say it like we want you to look

[01:00:53] I'm going to say it like we say

[01:00:56] But you lived it anyway

[01:00:58] Mm-hmm

[01:01:08] Mm-hmm

[01:01:39] Uh-oh

[01:01:44] Oh, no, no, no, no

[01:01:49] I don't know

[01:01:51] I know

[01:01:53] I know

[01:01:56] I know

[01:01:59] But me yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm all the way

[01:02:02] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:02:05] I'm going to meet you

[01:02:07] I'm not a dead end in the way now

[01:02:12] She's on the make of the middle of the mountain

[01:02:15] Baby, someone say you're left with what you have

[01:02:19] What you're good to be knows and all times

[01:02:23] Change your friends and come and watch your gum

[01:02:26] What you really have, they watch you suffer

[01:02:30] Yeah, they are holding down, hold on down to the end of the world

[01:02:36] Baby, I'm not a dead end, take to me

[01:02:41] What you left me for behind

[01:02:44] They're all behind, they're all behind

[01:02:49] When I look into your eyes, I still love you

[01:03:07] Darling, when I hold you, I don't know why I feel the same

[01:03:20] Nothing lasts forever, and for all the more I've seen

[01:03:27] In the time I hold you, I can't love you

[01:03:30] It can cause no end of her life

[01:03:45] I've been through this such a long time

[01:03:48] You've tried to keep me from appearing

[01:03:57] Love is always coming, love is always going

[01:04:00] I know I'm in a trouble, but I didn't go to daddy

[01:04:05] Walking away

[01:04:09] We can take the time, I live on the line

[01:04:12] And the rent's fired, that's no one that you'll find

[01:04:18] Come back

[01:04:24] So if you want love, then you can fly and go away

[01:04:36] I run and stand up walking, you'll go no longer away

[01:04:46] To hear me sometimes, on your own

[01:04:53] To hear me sometimes, on your own

[01:04:59] Everybody needs some time, on your own

[01:05:06] Everybody needs some time, on your own

[01:05:14] I know what time it is, and on your own

[01:05:20] Even the friendship out on you

[01:05:26] What if you could hear the broken heart

[01:05:32] Wouldn't it die beyond the jungle?

[01:05:41] We disposition, and my wide eyed gaze

[01:05:46] We're singing in the car getting lost up

[01:05:50] Stay, autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

[01:05:55] And I can picture it after all these days

[01:06:01] And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more

[01:06:06] And I might be okay, but I'm not finding a fool

[01:06:16] Cause then we are again on that little town streets

[01:06:21] You're almost in the red, cause you were looking over at me

[01:06:26] Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[01:06:36] For an album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red

[01:06:42] It used to be a little kid with glasses and it's wind-sized bed

[01:06:47] And your mother's telling stories about you on the tea ball team

[01:06:52] You told me about your past thinking you've used to be

[01:06:57] And you were tossing me the car keys, but the patriarchy

[01:07:02] Keaching on the ground, we were always skipping town

[01:07:08] And I was thinking on the drive down anytime now

[01:07:12] He's gonna say it's a love, you never called it what it was

[01:07:18] Till we were dead and gone and buried

[01:07:21] Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same

[01:07:25] After three months in the grave

[01:07:28] And then you wondered where it went too

[01:07:31] As I reached for you, but all I felt was shame

[01:07:35] And you held my life this frame

[01:07:39] And I know it's forgotten

[01:07:42] There was nothing else I could do

[01:07:44] And I forget about you long enough

[01:07:47] To forget who I needed to do

[01:07:54] Cause we are again in the middle of the night

[01:08:00] We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light

[01:08:04] Down the stairs I was there

[01:08:07] I remember it all too well

[01:08:15] And there we are again when nobody had to know

[01:08:20] You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an old secret prayer

[01:08:26] And we swear to remember it all too well

[01:08:37] And then you were dead and gone and buried

[01:08:42] Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same

[01:08:47] After three months in the grave

[01:08:51] And then you wondered where it went

[01:08:54] What it was?

[01:08:56] I remember it all too well

[01:08:59] And then you held my life this frame

[01:09:04] And I remember it all too well

[01:09:11] And you called me up again

[01:09:14] Just to break me like a promise

[01:09:17] So casually cruel

[01:09:19] In the name of being honest I'm a crumpled up

[01:09:23] Piece of paper lying here

[01:09:26] Cause I remember it all

[01:09:29] Oh, oh, oh!

[01:09:33] They say all's well, life ends well,

[01:09:36] but I'm in a new hell every time.

[01:09:40] You double crossed my mind.

[01:09:43] You said if we had been closer and age,

[01:09:47] maybe it would've been fine.

[01:09:50] And that baby wants to die,

[01:09:54] the idea you had of me who was she.

[01:09:56] I never need, ever, love me, Joel,

[01:10:00] cause shine reflects on you.

[01:10:04] Not we've been in a party,

[01:10:06] bathroom's on, actress asking me what happened to you.

[01:10:11] That's what happened to you.

[01:10:14] You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes.

[01:10:20] Sip and coffee like you're on a late night show.

[01:10:24] But then he watched me watch the front door all night,

[01:10:28] willing you to come.

[01:10:29] And he said it's supposed to be fun, turning 21.

[01:10:48] Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it.

[01:10:53] I'd like to be my old self again,

[01:10:56] but I'm still trying to find it after a pleasure days.

[01:11:00] And that's when you made me your own.

[01:11:03] Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone.

[01:11:09] But you keep my old scarf from that very first week.

[01:11:14] Cause it reminds you of innocence,

[01:11:16] and it smells like me.

[01:11:18] You can't get rid of it.

[01:11:21] Cause you remember it all too well.

[01:11:29] Cause the way I began when I loved you so.

[01:11:35] Back before you lost,

[01:11:36] the one real thing you've ever known.

[01:11:39] It was rare, I was there.

[01:11:41] I remember it all too well.

[01:11:49] Wind in my hair, you were there.

[01:11:52] You remember it all down the stairs.

[01:11:56] You were there.

[01:11:57] You remember it all.

[01:12:00] It was rare, I was there.

[01:12:02] I remember it all too well.

[01:12:09] And I was never good at telling jokes,

[01:12:13] but the punchline goes,

[01:12:15] I'll get older but your lovers stay my age.

[01:12:20] From when you're Brooklyn broke,

[01:12:23] my skin and bones,

[01:12:25] I'm a soldier who's returning,

[01:12:28] half her weight,

[01:12:30] and did the twin's lame bruise paint you blue.

[01:12:36] Just between a stedol of affair made you two.

[01:12:41] Cause in this city's barren cold,

[01:12:45] I still remember the first fall of snow

[01:12:50] and how it goes and as it fell.

[01:12:54] I remember it all too well.

[01:13:02] Just between a stedol of affair made you two.

[01:13:12] Just between a stedol of affair made you two.

[01:13:16] Cause in this city's barren cold,

[01:13:22] I still remember it all too well.

[01:13:25] And I was never good at telling jokes,

[01:13:31] but the punchline goes,

[01:13:33] I'll get older but your lovers stay my age.

[01:13:38] From when you're Brooklyn broke,

[01:13:41] my skin and bones,

[01:13:43] I'm a soldier who's returning,

[01:13:45] half her weight,

[01:13:47] and did the twin's lame bruise paint you blue.

[01:13:50] And I was never good at telling jokes,

[01:13:53] but the punchline goes,

[01:13:55] I'm a stedol of affair made you two.

[01:14:07] I remember when this was all far man,

[01:14:09] as far as the eye could see,

[01:14:10] oh man, me body.

[01:14:12] Oh no, this is crazy idea about breeding pine.

[01:14:16] Listen, sorry, I'm not any of those guys.

[01:14:18] I'm a kid from a trainer park.

[01:14:19] If that's what you think,

[01:14:21] then that's all you'll ever be.

[01:14:23] This is, this is,

[01:14:24] this is,

[01:14:25] my, my, my, my,

[01:14:26] and what you're about to witness is one of the most sinister sounding intros to a trailer

[01:14:31] to one of the greatest epics ever produced.

[01:14:33] Yay!

[01:14:34] Introses beware.

[01:14:36] Good evening.

[01:14:37] I'm Dr. David Brown.

[01:14:38] I'm standing on the parking lot.

[01:14:39] A twin pines mall.

[01:14:40] Trushing death in gray.

[01:14:43] Sorry, I'm warning October 26, 1980,

[01:14:45] 1980, 1985,

[01:14:46] 180, 180,

[01:14:47] so too broad of the trespassing fee.

[01:14:52] This is temporal experiment number one.

[01:14:54] You really know what's happening right here, don't you?

[01:14:56] Well, it tastes,

[01:14:57] you don't know shit, but you.

[01:14:59] Fuehler,

[01:15:00] wax on,

[01:15:01] right time.

[01:15:02] Fuehler,

[01:15:03] wax off,

[01:15:04] left time.

[01:15:05] This, this, this, this, this,

[01:15:08] big coat.

[01:15:08] It's an end of the game.

[01:15:09] If you still love it to be here tonight,

[01:17:29] I can't think it all

[01:17:33] Gonna live with life

[01:17:39] I'm lonely

[01:18:07] I'll always be there

[01:18:11] And when you're in doubt

[01:18:15] And when you're in danger

[01:18:19] Take a look all around

[01:18:23] And I'll be there

[01:18:28] I'm sorry but I just think another ride was just a promise

[01:18:33] I know they don't sound the way I plan that to be

[01:18:37] But if you wait around the wall

[01:18:39] And make your fool for me

[01:18:41] I promise

[01:18:43] I promise you I will

[01:18:49] I will

[01:19:03] And when I'm in your room

[01:19:06] I'll take you out

[01:19:07] I'll shoot you up until you arrive

[01:19:10] Until you enter someone new

[01:19:14] And I'll fire you later on

[01:19:34] You're acting

[01:19:38] You're acting

[01:19:47] If I am a silence

[01:19:50] Looking down the path of blue

[01:19:55] I find myself a little knocking

[01:19:59] All alone with you

[01:20:03] I can see behind your eyes

[01:20:07] The things that I don't know

[01:20:11] If you hide away from me

[01:20:15] How can I not know?

[01:20:18] I want to know

[01:20:20] What you're thinking

[01:20:23] That I'm a sun-tease

[01:20:24] You can't hide

[01:20:26] I want to know

[01:20:28] What you're feeling

[01:20:31] Tell me what's on your mind

[01:20:59] You're all of a sudden

[01:21:11] I will not accept defeat

[01:21:14] I have you, yes I have you

[01:21:18] I'll find myself a little more

[01:21:21] I'll shoot you up until you arrive

[01:21:24] Until you enter someone new

[01:21:27] I will find myself a little more

[01:21:31] I'll find myself a little more

[01:21:35] I will create you and capture you

[01:21:39] My calculations are correct

[01:21:42] When this baby is 88 miles per hour

[01:21:45] You're gonna see some serious shit

[01:21:58] You're all of a sudden

[01:22:00] I cannot sleep my own obsession

[01:22:03] I'm hoping that you'll feed

[01:22:05] There's no balance, no problems

[01:22:08] You're all of a sudden

[01:22:11] I can't sleep my own obsession

[01:22:14] I'm hoping that you'll feed

[01:22:17] There's no balance, no problems

[01:22:20] You're all of a sudden

[01:22:23] Born and raised in soft control

[01:22:28] It took me not long ago today

[01:22:59] It's no problem in mind that it's a problem I find

[01:23:03] Living a life that I can't be behind

[01:23:07] But there's no sense in telling me

[01:23:11] The wisdom of the rules that she free

[01:23:15] But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows

[01:23:19] Well, everything in my confusion grows

[01:23:23] When I die, but you tell me you grow the time machine

[01:23:26] If you're gonna build a time machine, why not do it some style?

[01:23:29] Smile, smile, smile, smile

[02:35:19] I took too much to stay here

[02:35:20] Picking in chains and knocking down tables

[02:35:22] And I was strong

[02:35:23] In a western town, call the police

[02:35:25] There's a map that around

[02:35:26] Flutting town, underground

[02:35:28] To a die fall

[02:35:29] In a western town, a dead end world

[02:35:32] The eastern world is a war

[02:35:34] In a western town, a dead end world

[02:35:37] The eastern world is a war

[02:35:42] In a western town, a dead end world

[02:35:46] You know you can't go all the time

[02:35:48] When we meet

[02:35:50] Our body burning to just my countries

[02:35:54] bunlar somewhere between souls and machines

[02:35:58] Where I find myself hungry

[02:36:02] Eerie glaze on that hood

[02:36:03] Where I'mbeatin' like Saturn

[02:36:05] Eerie glaze on the dark, sunlight linin'

[02:36:09] Eerie glaze on my deadly functions

[02:36:13] Give me a laser on the fire when you're back

[02:36:17] There's a heart for the reason

[02:36:19] All the way along

[02:36:21] Down on the roof

[02:36:23] Down on the roof

[02:36:25] You fly along like a room

[02:36:29] And it's all over you

[02:36:33] There's a heart for the reason

[02:36:36] And it's just one heart

[02:36:40] There's a heart for the reason

[02:36:44] There's a heart for the reason

[02:36:48] All the way along

[02:37:07] And like I can't fight

[02:37:10] Oh, oh, oh, we're gonna run

[02:37:12] Now to the electric I value

[02:37:15] As I can take it higher

[02:37:19] I can't sit here while I stay moving

[02:37:23] Chase my dreams you thought that you did it

[02:37:27] Soaking on a white

[02:37:29] Running out of lights

[02:37:31] There's no room in the so hard of mine

[02:37:35] Filled the lack of waiting number of hearts

[02:37:39] A paper screen and cardboard

[02:37:41] But you're wrong

[02:37:43] Merge of all the pain

[02:37:45] As the hit the streets

[02:37:47] As the scoop and then the city

[02:37:50] So all of us

[02:37:52] I walk by

[02:37:54] Driven in the face and put a bit of fire

[02:37:58] Then load you again and again

[02:38:02] First into my heart and he's mad

[02:38:06] No one knows how I feel

[02:38:10] What I've done left between me and between my lies

[02:38:14] One man walk away from me

[02:38:18] Smirking through my head

[02:38:20] Deadly, oh, bad bad, bad bad

[02:38:24] In the middle of my room

[02:38:27] But nothing can help you

[02:38:30] So all right, all right

[02:38:33] Be standing in the light

[02:38:35] Be standing in the light

[02:38:37] Be standing in the light

[02:38:39] I have a pride

[02:38:43] It's it

[02:38:45] La la la la la la la la la la la la la

[02:38:50] La la la la la la la la

[02:38:56] Sooner, dear

[02:38:58] They lay my friends

[02:39:00] Like a widow

[02:39:02] I can't be ours

[02:39:05] No man, call my name

[02:39:08] So maintain

[02:39:11] Don't walk, don't walk away from you

[02:39:16] Baby, you're a friend of the soul that you do

[02:39:20] One man, sitting on the floor

[02:39:24] He asked me for my love and I was all

[02:39:28] Deadly, oh, bad bad bad

[02:39:31] Bloody are a young man

[02:39:33] Hard man shouting in the street

[02:39:35] Gonna take on the world someday

[02:39:37] You got blood on your face

[02:39:39] A big disgrace

[02:39:41] Waving your banner on the plate

[02:39:57] Poor man, didn't with your eyes

[02:39:59] Gonna make his own beast

[02:40:00] Some day you got blood on your face

[02:40:02] A big disgrace

[02:40:04] Somebody better put your bag into your place

[02:40:06] We were a, we were a rock you

[02:40:10] Singing

[02:40:12] We were a, we were a rock you

[02:40:36] You wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world right now

[02:40:40] So without further ado

[02:40:42] Where do I want to go?

[02:40:46] I'm kidding, gotta run

[02:40:50] Baby, gotta run

[02:40:56] Come on, come on

[02:41:00] Stay at the sun

[02:41:04] What did her, daddy do?

[02:41:08] What did he or she do?

[02:41:10] That's it when Jamie was arrested

[02:41:14] They found him on an impotry

[02:41:20] But man he had a comment

[02:41:22] Now that Jamie's got a gun she never got

[02:41:25] A gun she never got

[02:41:55] I'll press the trigger

[02:42:01] I said she got a smile

[02:42:03] That it seems the mirror reminds me of childhood

[02:42:07] There are more ease

[02:42:09] Where everything wants to crash

[02:42:11] As it bright blue sky

[02:42:13] Yeah

[02:42:15] Now it's there when I see your face

[02:42:19] It makes me way to prosperity

[02:42:23] And if I stay too long I'll probably break down and cry

[02:42:31] Whoa

[02:42:34] I'll change a line

[02:42:40] I'll change a line

[02:42:45] Natural moves take me ao

[02:42:51] I'm out of place, my eye below

[02:42:56] Where's Virginia?

[02:42:59] My life on my own, take me home

[02:43:05] Don't you roll?

[02:43:08] Oh, man, we've got a rounder, minus league

[02:43:14] Change your truth with this water

[02:44:18] If it's right, I'm ready to let you go

[02:44:22] Because it's too late to not know

[02:44:28] This fight lasts without reason

[02:44:34] I'm ready to let you go

[02:44:38] If it's right, you're one from me

[02:44:42] They're taking away

[02:44:48] Everything, not what you feel

[02:44:52] It's all over again

[02:44:58] Do you really want to love me?

[02:45:02] Do you really want to make me cry?

[02:45:07] Do you really want to hurt me?

[02:45:11] Do you really want to make me cry?

[02:45:15] I love you, I love you

[02:45:27] I love you

[02:45:29] I love you

[02:45:35] I'm ready to step

[02:45:37] You take me

[02:45:39] I'll be watching you

[02:45:43] Every single day

[02:45:47] Ever word you say

[02:45:51] You remain new to me

[02:45:53] they're not just you

[02:45:55] I'll be watching you

[02:46:05] When we find you, bring every step you take, I'll be watching

[02:46:12] Every single day, every word you say

[02:46:21] Every day you play, every night you stay, I'll be watching

[02:46:35] For heaven's hollow gold, let's sweet eyes

[02:47:05] For heaven's never cold, she's got better days, I should talk to you

[02:47:12] I'll have to make a day, she's got a few nights long, she's a pain I've been waiting for

[02:47:26] Come to my house, that's easy, in a magic tomb, she's a pure pig

[02:47:36] It's crazy about it, I'll love some more things that are working too

[02:47:46] You're so long again, living in the sea, don't know there's a free way

[02:47:59] Right through the arms, and I'm a bad girl, this don't even mess her

[02:48:08] I'm a bad girl, the great and fun I'm free

[02:48:17] I'm free, holding you, I'm free

[02:48:28] Oh, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it

[02:48:34] The first gig that took us land, here for the man, in the black of dogs, we beat you up to your spanned head

[02:48:43] You're life to cover him up now, born in the USA, born in the USA

[02:49:03] Take me home tonight, I don't wanna let you go to see the moon

[02:49:10] Take me home tonight, listen to me, just like what I said

[02:49:15] Be my little baby, hold me

[02:49:20] Take me home tonight, I don't wanna let you go to see the moon

[02:49:29] Take me home tonight, I don't wanna let you go to see the moon

[02:49:38] This is the story, I'm not any of those guys, I'm just hit from a train's apartment

[02:49:41] That's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be

[02:49:46] And I need you forever, and if you're lonely, hold me tight

[02:49:52] We'll be holding on forever, and we'll only be making it right

[02:49:59] Cause we'll never be wrong, it's the time I was falling in love

[02:50:05] And I'm only falling apart, there's nothing I can do, that's all we've lived to go by

[02:50:15] I'm only one, I'm holding on for a hero, so the end of the night

[02:50:20] Cause he's gonna be strong, and he's gonna be fast

[02:50:24] And he's gonna be rich from the fight

[02:50:27] I'm only a hero, I'm holding on for a hero, so my body's alive

[02:50:33] He's gonna be sure, and it's gonna be true, and he's gonna be lost in the light

[02:50:41] I'm a hero, I'm a hero, so the most pancassist that comes out of the middle of a goddamn alley

[02:50:47] While his buddies are flying around on wires, cutting everybody's head

[02:50:51] And he just stands there waiting for me to drive my truck straight through him

[02:50:55] With a fight coming out of his mouth

[02:51:10] Break it away from you and it will go, you got to be stable

[02:51:17] You need to sit down with this kind of Japanese dance

[02:51:21] When I wake up and listen to the slow ball of town

[02:51:27] Talkin' aS这么 say you can't put you up

[02:51:32] And attracted people from the 70's

[02:51:37] Like a game with years down

[02:51:39] What better will change to be here?

[02:51:41] What better time to fail?

[02:51:44] Like that, through the wheel

[02:51:47] I swear that you did all the right thing

[02:51:50] Through the wheel

[02:51:52] It's worth it!

[02:51:53] Through the wheel

[02:51:54] Right now, through the wheel

[02:51:57] It's worth it!

[02:51:58] It all, right now

[02:51:59] Through the wheel

[02:52:01] It's worth it!

[02:52:02] Through the wheel

[02:52:03] It's worth it!

[02:52:04] I'm just living under the streets of our heart

[02:52:06] I can't stop the beat of your charity case

[02:52:08] I'm tearing a case, come on, what's up and do me?

[02:52:10] I'll pay you one another time

[02:52:13] I'm making the end of the night

[02:52:16] Rates, I'll kill you both, I'll shake

[02:52:20] Break the laws, I'll break the laws

[02:52:22] Break the laws, I'll break the laws

[02:52:24] Break the laws, I'll break my laws

[02:52:26] Break the laws, so they say you got them

[02:52:28] Keep with them all, but watch in the face, we know it

[02:52:30] It's all my evil words, just to get it

[02:52:32] You treated like a pebble of blood

[02:52:34] I'll break the laws, never lost your way to die

[02:52:38] Lakes are down to the paradise

[02:52:40] To where the brass is free

[02:52:42] And the girls are pretty

[02:52:44] Oh, won't you please, take me home

[02:52:46] Yeah, take me home

[02:52:48] Take me down to the paradise

[02:52:50] To where the brass is free

[02:52:52] And the girls are pretty

[02:52:54] Take me home

[02:52:58] Break the laws, we're dead

[02:53:02] I won't round theへ like that

[02:53:04] I won't round theへ葛

[02:53:05] I won't round theへ like that

[02:53:07] I'll break the laws

[02:53:17] Break the laws, I'll break my chains

[02:53:19] Take me home

[02:53:20] My street

[02:53:21] It is not evil

[02:53:24] I'll go back on my my

[02:53:27] Just the mad que organised

[02:53:30] So many times it happens to last

[02:53:34] You say don't cry, you don't know me

[02:53:38] Don't lose your rhythm, hold a breath of love

[02:53:41] You must cry, you must keep them alive

[02:53:44] It's the eye of the time

[02:53:47] So remember to fight, right to the point

[02:53:50] To the tear of the heart

[02:53:52] And the eyes of those alive

[02:53:54] So you pray to the night, I'll keep working

[02:53:57] To the tear of the time

[02:54:04] Raise your hands, I'll keep working

[02:54:08] And don't take me away

[02:54:11] There's not the end, we can't get in the street

[02:54:15] The human with the speed of use of our life

[02:54:18] If the time is the same

[02:54:21] We lose our rights, we're back

[02:54:24] To the tear of the heart

[02:54:26] And the eyes of those alive

[02:54:29] To the tear of the night, I'll keep working

[02:54:32] One constant through all the years, Ray

[02:54:35] has been faced by

[02:54:37] America's rules by like an army of steamrollers

[02:54:41] And it race like a blackboard

[02:54:43] Rebuilt in wrist again

[02:54:47] Faceball

[02:54:48] Mark the time

[02:54:51] This field

[02:54:53] This game

[02:54:55] is a part of our past race

[02:54:58] Remind us all the ones who were good

[02:55:01] He's sick with his life

[02:55:03] He's a devil

[02:55:04] He's your top

[02:55:06] He's a little

[02:55:07] He's more comrade

[02:55:09] He wouldn't want to be anywhere

[02:55:11] He was most definitely coming

[02:55:13] So without further ado

[02:55:15] We're all party people left

[02:55:17] We're all party people left

[02:55:19] We're all party people left

[02:55:21] We're all party people left

[02:55:23] We're all party people left

[02:55:25] And I'm sure to be the first one to get displayed in the store

[02:55:28] You know that, Bobo, let me hug and toss it on

[02:55:31] I'm sure people you're going to be number two

[02:55:34] But you don't got the fuck up and get the fuck up the cloud

[02:55:36] My crew is taking over the soonest beat of the door

[02:55:39] You're a devil, we coming in and you going home

[02:55:42] You really need to get it, you can stop us

[02:55:44] We're all running, never knew somethings on us

[02:55:46] That were rather we go

[02:55:47] Shotgun on my phoneies, and hold him up

[02:55:49] Holy Ghost, we cover tongues

[02:55:51] It's like we just stop and takin' to long

[02:56:07] We're all party people left

[02:56:10] We're all party people left

[02:56:12] When I came into the game, they'd do nothing but doubt me

[02:56:17] Out of whole games, changing it ain't nothing without me

[02:56:19] Taking up my sloppy seconds, as they reach for the crowd

[02:56:22] Only reason you own this song is because I turn that down

[02:56:25] When from hot wheels to peak wheels, time dies to finish

[02:56:27] If I cause meals, no more pop-ups and blebby

[02:56:30] So all right to hand, so throwin' room to nantips

[02:56:33] From hanging on a block to throwin' bodies in the hamptest row

[02:56:36] Trogues and jokers, I beat that butter, plain and a bone

[02:56:40] Six out the whips and I'm on a, from dax on the curb

[02:56:42] The second I'm tipped, but on a, from birds on my nerves

[03:06:37] Too little beautiful

[03:06:38] Girls looking puzzled in the days

[03:06:39] I know it's confusing you

[03:06:40] Daddy's always on the move

[03:06:42] Mama's always on the news

[03:06:43] I try to keep youself in front of me

[03:06:45] But sometimes I would seem

[03:06:46] I try to do that

[03:06:47] The more it backfires on me

[03:06:48] All the things growing up is daddy

[03:06:50] Daddy had to see

[03:06:51] Daddy don't want you to see

[03:06:52] But you see just as much as he did

[03:06:53] We did not plan it to be this way

[03:06:55] No more threatening me

[03:06:56] But things have got so bad between us

[03:06:58] I don't see it's ever been

[03:06:59] Together ever again

[03:07:00] Like we used to be when we was teenagers

[03:07:02] But in the close every day

[03:07:04] We was having strong feelings

[03:07:05] I guess it was never meant to be

[03:07:07] But it's just something we have no control over

[03:07:09] And that's what destiny is

[03:07:10] But no more worries

[03:07:11] Rest your head and go to sleep

[03:07:13] Maybe one day we'll wake up

[03:07:14] And this will all be a dream

[03:07:16] When you see the love that's left

[03:07:22] It's where we are

[03:07:27] It's love

[03:07:29] But it's what I don't wanna know

[03:07:32] That we got to fall

[03:07:38] When you see the love that's left

[03:07:42] I'm a slave, you're a man

[03:07:48] You're a love, you're a man

[03:07:52] You're a man, you're a man

[03:07:54] You're a man

[03:07:58] This funny, I remember back when you and daddy had no money

[03:08:02] Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck them under the tree and said some more

[03:08:06] More from me, because daddy couldn't buy them

[03:08:08] I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

[03:08:10] Because daddy felt like a bum

[03:08:12] See daddy had a job, but his job was to keep the food on the table

[03:08:15] Where you and mommy at the time

[03:08:17] Every house that we lived and either kept getting broken into

[03:08:20] And robbed a shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you

[03:08:23] When the drugs on the start of piggy bank

[03:08:25] Where you see you could go to college

[03:08:27] You almost had a thousand dollars

[03:08:29] So someone broke in and stole it and I know we're so bad

[03:08:31] It broke your mom's heart

[03:08:32] And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart

[03:08:35] Mom and dad was arguing a lot

[03:08:37] So mom will back on the traumas and the flat

[03:08:39] One bedroom apart, men and dad will back to the other side

[03:08:47] And flew you and my mom out to see me

[03:08:49] With daddy had the work

[03:08:51] But you started seeing daddy on the TV

[03:08:53] And mama didn't like it

[03:08:55] And you and Wayney were too young to understand it

[03:47:59] His vomit on his sweater already

[03:48:01] Moms forget he's nervous, but on the surface

[03:48:03] He looks calm and ready to drop palms

[03:48:06] But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down

[03:48:08] The whole crowd goes so loud, he opens his mouth

[03:48:11] But the words won't come out, he's choking how

[03:48:14] Everybody's choking now, the clock's run out

[03:48:17] Time's up over, plies

[03:48:19] Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh

[03:49:10] As we move toward a new world order

[03:49:12] A normal life is born, a super star, and close to post-mortem

[03:49:16] It only grows harder, homie grows harder, he blows his all over

[03:49:20] His hose is all on him, goes to co-shows

[03:49:23] He's known as the globe's router, lonely roads got only nose

[03:49:26] He's grown farther from home, he's no farther

[03:49:29] He goes home and barely knows his home gotter

[03:49:32] And the whole gym knows this, he goes to cold water

[03:49:34] His hose don't want him no more, he's cold product

[03:49:37] And he moved on to the next smooths, loads he knows don't

[03:49:40] And so he's not a soulless old barber

[03:49:43] And totally unfolds, I suppose it's so partner

[03:49:45] But the beat goes on that it's up to the moon

[03:49:48] He ran out of his stuff, think of music, the moment you own

[03:49:51] It's your better, never let it go

[03:49:53] You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

[03:49:57] This opportunity comes once on a lifetime

[03:52:21] Friday night and the lights are low

[03:52:28] Looking out for a place to go

[03:52:33] We're afraid of our music

[03:52:36] Getting in the swing

[03:52:38] You're come to your forecane

[03:52:41] Anybody could be that guy

[03:52:47] Not as young and musics

[03:53:39] Watch that scene

[03:53:41] Diggin' sexy queen

[03:53:46] A man who had rock was young

[03:53:50] Me and Susie had so much fun

[03:53:53] Holdin' hands and skim and stones

[03:53:57] Had no gold shaman

[03:53:59] And I'm flestering my arm

[03:54:00] But the biggest kick I ever got

[03:54:03] Was gonna playin' called a crocodile rock

[03:54:06] While the other kids are rockin' round the clock

[03:54:09] We were hoppin' and bobin'

[03:54:11] To the crocodile rockin' well

[03:54:13] Draw a rock and song and shout

[03:54:16] And when you feel it just can keep still

[03:54:19] I never knew me about time

[03:54:22] I guess I never knew

[03:54:25] I'm flestering my eyes

[03:54:29] As soon as we walk it's done, I am

[03:54:32] I'm flestering my arm

[03:54:35] I'm flestering my arm

[03:54:38] But the biggest kick I ever got

[03:54:42] Was gonna playin' called a crocodile

[03:54:47] But the biggest kick I ever got

[03:54:50] Was gonna playin' called a crocodile rock

[03:54:54] While the other kids are rockin' round the clock

[03:54:57] We were hoppin' and bobin'

[03:54:59] To the crocodile rock

[03:55:00] While the other kids are rockin'

[03:55:02] We record machine

[03:55:03] Dreaming off the shaft and I'm over change

[03:55:05] But then I never kill the pills we got

[03:55:08] Burnin' up to the crocodile rock

[03:55:11] Burnin' fast, that little weeks went fast

[03:55:14] We really thought we'd rockin' crocodile well

[03:55:18] Draw a rock and song and shout

[03:55:20] And when you feel it just can keep still

[03:55:24] I'll never do me a proud time

[03:55:27] I'll have to sign it all real

[03:55:30] I will, I will

[03:55:32] I swear to God

[03:56:08] I'll come home in the morning

[03:56:10] I go to bed, be the man

[03:56:13] The same way, I ain't nothing but tired

[03:56:17] And I'm just tired and bored

[03:56:20] But myself, here they're here

[03:56:24] I've got you just a little

[03:56:27] You can't start a fire

[03:56:30] You can't start a fire

[03:56:32] Without a spark

[03:56:34] This thing's behind

[03:56:36] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:56:46] Messages keep getting bleeder

[03:56:48] We're here

[03:56:50] We're here as long as I move around

[03:56:52] My place, I check my luck in the mirror

[03:56:56] Wanna change my clothes

[03:56:58] My hair, my face

[03:57:00] And I ain't getting nowhere

[03:58:18] We can't start a fire

[03:58:20] It's nothing wrong

[03:58:22] Trying to go broke and caught

[03:58:24] This thing's behind

[03:58:26] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:58:30] We can't start a fire

[03:58:32] We're not sure if it will work

[03:58:36] But we're not sure if this thing's behind

[03:58:38] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:58:42] Stay been sliding the eye of your mind

[03:59:16] Step outside and stop at times in bloom

[03:59:22] Stand up and satisfy your place

[03:59:26] Take that look from off your face

[04:01:20] I feel warm in all night

[04:01:24] So start a revolution from my head

[04:01:28] Turn it back and ask it out

[04:01:30] I heard you say

[04:01:32] It sound beautiful

[04:01:34] Take that look from me

[04:01:38] I feel warm in all night

[04:01:42] So start a revolution from my head

[04:01:46] So start a revolution

[04:01:58] Turn it back and ask it out

[04:02:02] I heard you say

[04:02:14] If it's not a day

[04:02:20] It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

[04:02:24] The regular crowd shuffles in

[04:02:28] There's a no man sitting next to me

[04:02:32] Making love to his tonic engine

[04:02:46] He says, son, can you play me a memory

[04:02:50] I'm not really sure how it goes

[04:02:54] But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete

[04:02:58] When I worry on the man's clothes

[04:03:02] La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[04:03:16] Sing us the song of a piano man

[04:03:20] Sing us the song tonight

[04:03:22] When we're out in the mood for a melody

[04:03:26] And you've got us feeling all right

[04:03:46] Now John at the bar is a friend of mine

[04:03:50] He gets me my drinks for free

[04:03:54] And he's quick with a joke

[04:03:56] Or a light of your smoke

[04:03:58] But there's some place that he'd rather be

[04:04:04] He says, Bill, I believe this is killing me

[04:04:08] As a smile run away from his face

[04:04:12] Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star

[04:04:16] If I could get out of this place

[04:04:20] Oh la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[04:04:32] Now Paul is a real estate novelist

[04:04:36] Who never had time for a while

[04:04:40] And he's talking with David

[04:04:42] Who's still in the Navy

[04:04:44] And probably will be alive

[04:04:58] And the waitress is practicing politics

[04:05:02] As a businessman slowly gets stoned

[04:05:06] Yes, they're sharing a dream

[04:05:08] They call loneliness

[04:05:10] But it's better than drinking alone

[04:05:30] Sing us the song of a piano man

[04:05:34] Sing us the song tonight

[04:05:38] Well, we're all in the mood for melody

[04:05:42] And you've got us feeling all right

[04:05:54] Oh take a little time

[04:05:58] A little time will look around me

[04:06:02] I've got nowhere left to hide

[04:06:08] It looks like love has finally found me

[04:06:14] In my life

[04:06:18] There's been honey can paint

[04:06:20] I don't know if I can face it again

[04:06:26] I can't stop now

[04:06:28] I've traveled so far

[04:06:32] The chain gets lonely

[04:06:36] I want to know what love is

[04:06:44] I want you to show me

[04:06:48] I want to feel what love is

[04:06:54] I know you can show me

[04:07:02] I want to know what love is

[04:07:08] I want you to show me

[04:07:12] I want to feel what love is

[04:07:18] I know

[04:07:20] I know you can show me

[04:07:28] There's been honey can paint

[04:07:30] I want to know what love is

[04:07:32] I want to feel what love is

[04:07:36] I want you to show me

[04:07:40] I'm feeling so right now

[04:07:42] I want you to show me

[04:07:44] I know you're just going to hide

[04:07:48] I know you can show me

[04:07:56] I know you love me

[04:08:00] It's about a thousand

[04:08:02] I know you can show me

[04:08:06] I want you to show me

[04:08:08] I want you to show me

[04:08:10] I want you to show me

[04:08:12] I know

[04:08:14] I know you can show me

[04:08:18] I know you can show me

[04:08:22] I know you can show me

[04:08:26] I know you can show me

[04:08:42] This home you was bleeding

[04:08:46] You can't see his blood

[04:08:50] And his old arm kicked up

[04:08:54] He's been raining since you left me

[04:08:58] Now I'm drowning in the flood

[04:09:02] You see I've always been a fighter

[04:09:04] But without you I give up

[04:09:08] Now I can't sing a love song

[04:09:10] Like the way it's meant to be

[04:09:14] Well I guess I'm not that good anymore

[04:09:18] But baby that's just me

[04:09:22] I will love you

[04:09:28] Baby

[04:09:32] Always am I there

[04:09:38] Forever ever be

[04:09:44] Always am I there

[04:09:50] To the starlight shine

[04:09:52] To the heavens first

[04:09:54] In the words no rhyme

[04:09:56] But when I die

[04:09:58] You blow my mind

[04:10:00] And I love you

[04:10:02] Always

[04:10:08] Now your pictures there

[04:10:10] You live behind

[04:10:12] All just memories

[04:10:14] Over different lives

[04:10:16] Something made us laugh

[04:10:18] Something made us cry

[04:10:20] Well then made you

[04:10:22] Have to say goodbye

[04:10:24] When I give to run my fingers

[04:10:26] Through your hair

[04:10:28] Touch your lips

[04:10:30] To hold you near

[04:10:32] When you say your prayers

[04:10:34] Try to understand

[04:10:36] I've made mistakes

[04:10:38] I'm just a man

[04:10:40] This is the words

[04:10:42] You've been needing to hear

[04:10:44] I wish I was him

[04:10:46] Cook those words of mine

[04:10:48] To save you

[04:10:50] Till the end of time

[04:10:52] And I

[04:10:54] Will love you

[04:10:56] Baby

[04:11:00] Always am I there

[04:11:06] Forever ever be

[04:11:08] Always am I there

[04:11:12] Forever be

[04:11:18] Always am I there

[04:11:22] I'm so beautiful

[04:11:24] We can tell me

[04:11:26] You're my only one

[04:12:00] Everything is just a dream

[04:12:04] And I'm so beautiful
