[00:00] I tried so hard and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.

[00:09] I had too far to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.

[00:19] Welcome to the Canada Spinball Podcast, everybody.

[00:30] I hope you had a very great 4th of July weekend in Ireland.

[00:34] Nobody celebrates it.

[00:36] And as I tell all of the people here, that's because you are unsuccessful in getting the

[00:40] British out of your country.

[00:42] I'm super happy to do this show, and here's what we're going to talk about on this episode

[00:46] of Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:47] We are going to talk about whether or not I think the pinball market for you collectors

[00:52] out there, and this is for collectors, whether or not the pinball market has softened.

[00:59] And I don't think it has.

[01:00] I think we keep saying that, and people keep saying, I'm noticing the market is getting

[01:04] softer.

[01:05] I'm noticing prices are coming back down to reality, but the truth is that's not very

[01:12] truthful when you look at what's available.

[01:16] And if you're a collector and you get bit by the pinball bug, and let's say it's right

[01:20] now, it's July of 2022, and you get into pinball, you are going to start to look for games to

[01:28] buy, and you're going to want to get the better games, and you're going to want to get the

[01:31] LEs, you're going to want to get the CEs of all of these pinball machines that you've

[01:36] been hearing about.

[01:38] And right now, it's interesting because right now, there are so many games out there that

[01:43] people are saying are great games to own, right?

[01:46] Look at Stranger Things, for example.

[01:48] This was a game that sat new in box for like a year and a half at like $9,000, you couldn't

[01:56] give the game away.

[01:58] Now try and go get a Stranger Things LE and see what you're going to pay.

[02:03] You're going to pay like $16,000 or more.

[02:08] And so what I want to do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, it's going to be

[02:11] fun because I haven't done this in a while.

[02:13] I am going to go down a list of the games that I think collectors really want to own,

[02:18] and I'm just going to go on to the pinside marketplace, and we're going to look at the

[02:21] price.

[02:22] How much money are people asking for these games?

[02:25] And then let's ask the question, is the pinball marketplace softening?

[02:31] Are we headed towards a recession, and is that being baked into the price of these games?

[02:37] And I'm here to tell you right now, I've done a little cheating.

[02:39] I've looked at some of the prices, and the answer is absolutely not.

[02:43] The pinball market is not softening.

[02:45] It's not going south.

[02:47] These games, the ones people really want, they are so much more expensive than they ever

[02:52] were.

[02:53] And I also just want to say that I'm very happy to listen to so many of the pinball content

[02:57] creators out there, and everybody is responding to Toy Story the same way.

[03:03] Everyone is saying the game is fine, the game is fun, but there is nowhere near $12,000

[03:09] to $15,000 in value for Toy Story 4, and I'm just happy to see this.

[03:15] We all universally agree.

[03:18] And as I'm talking about the pinball market and pinball prices, I have to say, this game

[03:23] is going to lose value.

[03:24] If you bought a collector's edition of Toy Story, by the time they make it, you are

[03:30] going to see people trying to get rid of their deposits.

[03:34] And I've been saying this for the last year and a half now.

[03:37] The non-refundable deposit.

[03:39] The non-refundable thing was spooky with Jersey Jack.

[03:43] There's a reason why Stern Pinball doesn't need non-refundable deposits.

[03:48] But if you've committed to spending $2,500 on Toy Story 4, and you committed to $2,000

[03:55] on Ultraman and Halloween, what you're going to see is you're going to be able to get

[04:00] those games for less money than you committed to buying them for.

[04:05] And I mean it.

[04:06] With 1,000 Toy Stories being made, you're going to be able to get a CE for below $15,000.

[04:15] And by the time they make this game, I mean it.

[04:17] I can see the climate on this game.

[04:19] By the time they make it, the demand for this game is going to be gone.

[04:24] And everyone can sense it.

[04:26] Everybody knows it.

[04:27] And again, it doesn't mean that the game's not fun.

[04:30] It's just not a game that people are going to want to hand over $15,000 for, or $12,000

[04:37] for.

[04:38] And everyone will have enough time on an LE.

[04:41] And by the time they're asked to make up the difference for their CE, they're going to

[04:45] want to bail.

[04:46] All right.

[04:47] So enough about Toy Story 4, right?

[04:48] You're going to lose your shirt on the game.

[04:50] You know you are.

[04:51] Let's talk about the other games out there.

[04:53] The games that the collectors might want to buy and how much money they would have to

[04:57] spend on it.

[04:58] So let's start with the Munster's Limited Edition.

[05:02] Now I was there, and I remember it all too well, when the Munster's LE came out.

[05:08] There was a lot of demand for the game at the very beginning.

[05:11] Remember this was a game in which sterned up the number of LE's they were going to make

[05:15] from 500 to 600.

[05:18] But then they screwed over everybody because what made the Munster's LE at first glance

[05:24] a really appealing buy was it was supposed to be the only full featured version of the

[05:29] game that had a full color play field.

[05:33] Because remember the premiums were just black and white.

[05:36] And then the LE was the full colored play field.

[05:39] And then they announced they were going to make a full colored premium version of the

[05:44] Munster's, which made the LE not that exclusive anymore.

[05:48] And remember this game didn't even come with the topper, which is now impossible to get

[05:53] by the way.

[05:54] So the Munster's LE when it came out, I believe this game was $9,000.

[06:01] So how much money would you need to spend to get a Munster's LE today?

[06:05] So there is only one game for sale on Pinside, which is out of 600.

[06:11] Only one is available to buy.

[06:13] It is currently listed as sale pending for $14,500.

[06:20] Now I don't know what any of the final sale prices are, but they will probably be close

[06:26] to what the asking price was.

[06:28] So that is an increase of $5,500 on the original price of the game.

[06:36] Over 50% increase in price.

[06:39] All right, let's go to Deadpool Limited Edition.

[06:42] Now Deadpool LE was another game when it came out.

[06:46] We were all sort of complaining there weren't curses.

[06:49] We were complaining a little bit that there was Deadpool on a spring.

[06:53] We were complaining about sort of the lack of movie clips and all that jazz.

[06:57] But then you know, it was a beautiful art package from Zambietti.

[07:01] But this was another game.

[07:02] It wasn't hard to get a Deadpool LE at all.

[07:06] And they made 500 of them, I believe.

[07:09] Now how much is an out of box used Deadpool Limited Edition?

[07:14] There are two for sale right now for the prices.

[07:17] So wait, there's three for sale.

[07:20] $15,750, $16,500, and $16,250.

[07:29] So if you want to go get a Deadpool LE, you are looking at prices above $15,000.

[07:36] That's a $6,000 increase in price over the game.

[07:41] That is about what?

[07:42] Like a 70% increase over what this game was new in box.

[07:48] And come to me and tell me that pinball prices are softening.

[07:52] Let's go to Godzilla LE next.

[07:54] Godzilla LE, now this is a game that is being heralded as one of the greatest games of all

[08:00] time.

[08:01] Now the good news is if you want to get probably one of Stern's best games ever and you're

[08:06] a collector and you want the LE, they made a thousand of them.

[08:10] So this is a lot and there is a lot out there and that's why there are more for sale.

[08:16] This game brand new, brand new was what?

[08:20] $10,500.

[08:22] So remember that price.

[08:23] If you want to get one today, here's what you're looking at.

[08:27] You're looking at $15,500.

[08:30] You're looking at a new in box one for $25,000.

[08:33] You're looking at one for $16,500, $16,900 for new in box, $18,000, $16,500, $16,900 and

[08:42] $23,000 firm with a sale pending.

[08:46] There is no way that game sold for $23,000 when there's another new in box game for $16,900.

[08:54] See when you look at the pin side marketplace, you almost have to throw out the highest priced

[08:59] one and the lowest priced one to get the real indication.

[09:03] But right now it's looking like if you want to get a Godzilla, you can get one new in

[09:07] box for like $16,900.

[09:09] If you want an opened one, the cheapest we're looking at right now is around $15,500.

[09:15] I think if you offered $15,000, you'd walk away with one, but this is still a really

[09:19] great return on investment.

[09:22] But again, it's also another increase in price.

[09:26] So even with a thousand out there, if you want a Godzilla, you are spending at least

[09:32] $4,000 more than the game was new just a few months ago.

[09:36] But let's look at a game like Star Wars Limited Edition because this is where it gets fun.

[09:41] Games that people really have been crapping on for a long time.

[09:45] So a game like Star Wars, they made 800 of them and you're asking yourselves, well, how

[09:50] much is a Star Wars Limited Edition right now on the marketplace?

[09:55] Are you ready for the answer?

[09:56] There's zero.

[09:58] There's zero for sale.

[10:00] That's incredible.

[10:01] You absolutely can't find a Star Wars LE.

[10:04] And so when something like that happens and there's like no supply, you best bet that

[10:09] the first person who lists their Star Wars LE is going to ask for a lot of money.

[10:13] Now look, there's a Star Wars premium here for sale for $7,300.

[10:17] And I think that's the smart bet.

[10:19] Wait, is this an LE?

[10:20] This looks like an LE.

[10:21] Hold on a second.

[10:22] Now this is a premium.

[10:23] There are no LEs for sale.

[10:24] All right, let's look at Mandalorian LE.

[10:26] A game I've been ragging on.

[10:28] Did Mandalorian LE hold its value?

[10:30] Let's see.

[10:31] All right, so Mandalorian LE, remember this game knew was...

[10:36] So Mandalorian LE, this game, I believe they made 800 Mandalorian LEs.

[10:41] I forget what the price was of Mando.

[10:44] I want to say Mando LE was $10,000.

[10:47] And so right now the price of this sort of indicates where this game is at.

[10:53] For this theme being so popular and we're seeing Mandalorian, so there's a sale pending

[10:58] at 10.5 and then there are a bunch of them for 13.2, 13.5 NUENBOX, 12.9 NUENBOX, which

[11:06] is sale pending, 11.9, 11.5, 12,000, 12.7, all for opened up versions of the game.

[11:14] You know, Mandalorian is a game that really didn't sort of win everybody over.

[11:18] You're not seeing that sales spike on this machine.

[11:21] I don't think you're ever going to see this game go up more in value.

[11:24] But I would argue that Mandalorian has still gone up, right?

[11:28] It's still crazy.

[11:29] If you bought this game NUENBOX, you're still making money.

[11:33] And we're starting to see a pattern here where every single Stern machine has been a great

[11:38] investment.

[11:39] And I think a lot of people are applying this mentality to everything at Spooky, everything

[11:45] at Jersey Jack, but the truth is the reason why Stern Pima Machines keep going up in value

[11:51] is they have the largest collector base.

[11:54] And I also think people believe in Stern's quality the best.

[11:57] I think Stern games are sought after more because they're less problematic.

[12:02] And I'll say this, when you line up Stern games next to each other, they just look the

[12:07] best.

[12:08] It's like matching luggage.

[12:09] And that is why Stern Pinball is so smart.

[12:12] They know exactly what collectors want.

[12:15] But what about older Stern games?

[12:17] Let's look at Lord of the Rings, Ellie.

[12:19] So I bought my Lord of the Rings, Ellie, seven years ago.

[12:23] I paid $7,000 for Lord of the Rings limited edition.

[12:28] And it was in good condition.

[12:30] There was maybe like one broken plastic.

[12:32] But today, if you want to buy a Lord of the Rings, Ellie, and there's only 400 of them,

[12:38] there is one for sale for $11,900 and one for sale for $12,500 or best offer.

[12:48] So it's a lot of money, right?

[12:49] This is a DMD error game.

[12:51] It doesn't have great artwork.

[12:53] It's still one of the greatest pinball machines of all time.

[12:56] It has way more toys in it than anything happening right now in Toy Story.

[13:01] See this is the part about Toy Story.

[13:03] It's kind of crazy to spend $15,000 on a Toy Story CE.

[13:07] I would much rather go buy Lord of the Rings, Ellie, in which there's 600 less of those

[13:14] than Toy Story CE.

[13:15] And the game has way better toys in it and way better code in it than Toy Story 4.

[13:22] Everybody knows this and it's such a better pin.

[13:25] You can tell it's such a better pin.

[13:27] And not for nothing.

[13:29] These error games from Stern Pinball are damn reliable.

[13:32] If you get a Lord of the Rings home use only game, you're not going to be lifting the hood

[13:36] very often on that machine and you're going to have a great time.

[13:39] All right.

[13:40] Now, what about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ellie?

[13:43] I still think Ninja Turtles is a beautiful game, but it was a game when it came out.

[13:48] It really didn't catch on.

[13:50] I think the game was just too hard.

[13:52] I think the game wasn't as satisfying as people want it.

[13:55] And the prices of TMNT, Ellie, reflect that right now.

[14:00] There is a sale pending for an $8,500 TMNT, Ellie.

[14:04] So at that price, right, the game was 9 grand.

[14:07] So at 8,500, you actually lost money on TMNT, Ellie.

[14:12] And this is a good sign.

[14:13] You don't want every single game to just go up in value, regardless of how good the game

[14:19] is.

[14:20] There's another one for sale for 10, 5.

[14:22] Now, what's interesting about this is if someone's listing it for 10, 5 and one sold

[14:27] for 8,500, that's really good bargaining power.

[14:31] If you want one to go to that guy selling it for 10, 5 and say, hey, look, one just sold

[14:37] for $2,000 less than this, let's make a deal.

[14:40] All right.

[14:41] So, Stranger Things, as I was talking about, Stranger Things, a game that sat forever.

[14:47] And now we have two for sale, $16,000.

[14:51] 16 grand, people.

[14:54] These games were 9 grand and they sat in a box.

[14:57] And these are opened up used machines, by the way, for $7,000 more than they were brand

[15:04] new.

[15:05] What about Jurassic Park Limited Edition?

[15:07] How much would one of those cost today?

[15:09] Well, there's one for sale.

[15:11] Just one, $17,650 and it's listed as firm, which means he's not taking a penny below

[15:21] that.

[15:22] Jurassic Park, Ellie knew was what, $8,500.

[15:26] We're looking at about $9,000 over what the game cost, twice the price.

[15:34] And you're telling me the pinball market is softening.

[15:36] Let's go to Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[15:38] Now, Ghostbusters, Ellie is interesting because this game is still, I think, the most beautiful

[15:43] pinball machine that zombie Eddie has ever done.

[15:46] I think it's one of the best pinball themes Stern has ever had.

[15:49] And I think it's one of the most, like, packed with toys, colorful pinball experience.

[15:54] I would also argue that it's one of the worst shooting games.

[15:59] That no matter how you skin this game, it's like you're holding on for dear life.

[16:04] It's not a fun game to shoot.

[16:06] It is a more fun game to listen to and to watch.

[16:10] Now that being said, Ghostbusters, Ellie, when this game came out, it was $8,000.

[16:16] How much would an Ellie cost of Ghostbusters?

[16:19] The prices have come down some.

[16:21] I'm looking at a sale pending for an Ellie for $15,000, another one for sale for $15,500,

[16:29] another one for sale for $18,000 or best offer.

[16:34] That one comes with the topper.

[16:36] So basically you're looking at Ghostbusters without a topper around $15,000.

[16:42] That is an increase of $7,000 more than it was new, about an 80% increase in price.

[16:50] Pinball prices aren't softening people.

[16:53] Oh, Iron Maiden, Keith Owens masterpiece.

[16:58] Iron Maiden Ellie.

[17:00] Are you sitting down, people?

[17:02] $18,000 firm for an Iron Maiden Ellie.

[17:07] I had one.

[17:08] I flipped one for like a couple thousand dollar profit when it was like $8,500.

[17:13] This is about $10,000 more than this game was new, more than a 100% increase in the price.

[17:21] And the premiums are selling for $12,000 plus dollars.

[17:25] $12,000 for a premium of Iron Maiden, a game that they're still going to make.

[17:32] You will still be able to get Iron Maiden premium in the future.

[17:36] No one at Stern said they're never making Iron Maiden again.

[17:39] And this is the issue.

[17:41] This is bonkers.

[17:42] And now you wonder why Toy Story is $12,000 to $15,000 because they're looking at this

[17:47] stuff.

[17:48] But the problem is you got to make a game as good as Iron Maiden Ellie to charge this

[17:52] kind of money.

[17:53] And we know that Toy Story is not as good as Iron Maiden.

[17:57] See, here's where the problem lies, people, is Metallica Limited Edition.

[18:02] What was the Metallica Ellie when it came out?

[18:05] $6,700, maybe $7,000.

[18:09] Maybe $7,000.

[18:11] If you want a Metallica Ellie two day, you just got into this hobby.

[18:15] There are three for sale.

[18:17] One is sale pending at $17,000.

[18:21] One is for sale for $17,500.

[18:23] And then another one's for sale for $18,000.

[18:27] These are all $10,000 more than this game was brand new.

[18:33] $10,000.

[18:34] See, the hobbies sort of jumped the shark.

[18:36] We all know it.

[18:37] We all used to joke that a $7,000 Metallica would be 10K by Christmas.

[18:42] But $17,000.

[18:44] $17,000 for these games.

[18:47] What is going on?

[18:48] The market is not softening because one just sold for around $17,000.

[18:53] I mean, if you want a Batman 66 Ellie, an Ellie of Batman 66, which was what when it came

[19:00] out?

[19:01] I think the Ellie's were $10,000 and the premiums were $8,500.

[19:04] I think it was something like that.

[19:06] An Ellie of Batman 66, which was once $10,000, is now $19,999 is how much they want for the

[19:16] game.

[19:17] Another increase of $10,000.

[19:19] Let's look at a Jersey Jack.

[19:21] Let's look at Guns N' Roses Collectors Edition.

[19:24] This game came out, it was $12,500.

[19:27] If you want a GNR CE, there's one for $16,500, $17,200, $16,500, or best offer and $20,000

[19:39] for one new inbox.

[19:41] The prices of this game have come down.

[19:43] $15,000 or best offer leads me to believe that someone would accept $14,500, which means

[19:50] that's only $2,000 more than it was new in box.

[19:54] You're still making money, but we're really starting to see the price of this game slide

[19:59] backwards.

[20:00] It used to be $18,000, $19,000 for a CE and I think people are starting to get out of

[20:05] this game.

[20:06] The market's speaking here, right?

[20:08] These games aren't selling.

[20:09] These games selling for $16,000, $16,500 are not selling, which means the demand for guns

[20:15] and roses because they made so many Ellie's has dried up.

[20:19] Here's one that's interesting, the Hobbit.

[20:22] I remember when the Hobbits came out and everyone realized that this game was not what it was

[20:27] supposed to be.

[20:29] Smog wasn't really that interesting.

[20:31] The code was cool, the call-outs were cool, but the Hobbit Pimball Machine for the longest

[20:36] time sat for sale used around $6,500.

[20:42] Nowadays, if you want a Hobbit, 10-2, 10-2, 9,500, 9,800, 9,800, 13-2 for a Smog edition,

[20:54] 10-8 for a Smog Gold edition.

[20:57] These games have gone up by about $4,000 and they are now more expensive than they were

[21:02] brand new.

[21:04] Even a game like the Hobbit, which had very little demand, is now demanding way more money

[21:10] than it used to.

[21:11] See, the days are gone when a game would come out and not be that sought after and then

[21:16] it would lose value.

[21:18] That was when Pimball was fun, is when something that was a little bit of a miss, you could

[21:23] get for like a 30% discount, you could enjoy it knowing you got it for a deal.

[21:28] But there's no more deals to be had in Pimball.

[21:31] The only deals you can find in Pimball nowadays are on games that people really, really don't

[21:37] want, like an Ultraman or a Halloween.

[21:40] There's nothing else.

[21:41] Like, what else can you get a deal on?

[21:43] You can maybe get a little off on a Led Zeppelin or a Ninja Turtles, which are also games

[21:48] that people really don't want.

[21:50] But if there's any demand or the game is good, you're paying like a 30 to like 90% increase

[21:57] in price on these games.

[21:59] I mean, the same is true with like the Wizard of Oz.

[22:02] Like the Wizard of Oz was a game where they made so many of them and for the longest time

[22:07] you could get a waz for like $7,500 to like $8,000.

[22:12] Nowadays, $12,900, $12,513,590, $8,000, $13,000, $12,500.

[22:21] What's happening people?

[22:22] They made so many of these games.

[22:24] Look at this.

[22:25] There's one dialed in Collector's Edition for sale right now on Pinside for $16,500.

[22:30] Now look, if I were a collector, I would much rather spend $1,500 more than Toy Story

[22:38] CE and go get this dialed in.

[22:40] Why?

[22:41] It's packed with way more toys than Toy Story.

[22:44] There's only 150 dialed in CEs out in the world.

[22:48] It's arguably the best game that Pat Lawler's made at JJP.

[22:52] It is.

[22:53] It just is.

[22:54] So like if you're listening to this, I would go grab that machine.

[22:57] They just don't pop up very often.

[22:59] Now there's nothing really special about the dialed in CE.

[23:02] It has the same artwork.

[23:03] It's really just the purple powder coating and it's the same game.

[23:07] There's not much else happening in the game.

[23:10] The topper is terrible.

[23:12] Pat Lawler doesn't know how to make a nice CE, but I'm just saying $16,500.

[23:17] Now when this game came out, it was $12,500 and anyone could get a CE and only 150 people

[23:25] actually wanted one.

[23:26] It just goes to show dialed in has been a game where the demand's never really been

[23:30] there.

[23:31] But here's the crazy part about Pimble.

[23:32] It's not just these new games.

[23:35] We used to have the new Stearns, the new Jersey Jacks, the new Spooky Machines, the

[23:39] remakes from CGC and then we were able to go get like Baldy Williams games for really

[23:44] affordable prices.

[23:45] We used to be able to go get like a toad in for $6,500, $7,000 at most.

[23:51] But if you want to get a Tales of the Arabian now and these aren't even games that are

[23:54] like restored.

[23:56] These aren't even games that are fully brass plated.

[23:58] If you want to go get a toad in right now, $13,000, $12,500 and $12,000.

[24:06] Let's look at the Adams Family prices.

[24:08] The Adams Family is the most produced Pimble machine of all time.

[24:13] 22,000 units made and this is a game where it used to sell for around like $6,000, $7,000.

[24:21] Now $9,000.

[24:23] $15,000, $12,000 with a sale pending, $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 with a sale pending, $10,000

[24:33] and $14,000.

[24:35] I don't even have to keep going.

[24:36] You get the point everybody.

[24:38] The Pimble market is not softening.

[24:41] The Pimble market isn't.

[24:43] The Pimble market is so inflated right now.

[24:47] It is comical.

[24:48] I think deep down all of us wanted to be softening, but the truth is this.

[24:54] This hobby used to be a hobby in which you could get 95% of games for less than $10,000.

[25:03] But now if you're a collector and you want to get a game that's worth collecting and

[25:07] the collectible version of it, now 95% of the hobby is over $10,000.

[25:14] 95% of the hobby is over $12,000.

[25:18] And at what point does everybody say enough?

[25:21] I don't want this hobby to be this expensive.

[25:24] And I never wanted it to be this expensive.

[25:26] I never wanted everything to go up in value this much, 80% increase in value.

[25:31] Because none of this money is going into research and development.

[25:36] None of this money is going into innovation and R&D for new games.

[25:40] In fact, it's going in the opposite direction.

[25:43] So all of these games are going up in value like 50% to 80%.

[25:47] And none of these companies are putting 50% to 80% more into the games.

[25:53] Why does anyone want to be a part of a hobby where the prices go through the roof, but

[25:57] what we're getting for the money hasn't improved at all?

[26:01] If I'm going to spend this much money, I want to see games like the big Lebowski.

[26:05] I want to see games like Wizard of Oz.

[26:07] I want to see games packed from end to end of that wood, north to south,

[26:13] east to west.

[26:14] I want to see tons of stuff in the game.

[26:17] But that's not going to happen.

[26:19] And it's not going to happen if people are spending this much money on a Deadpool or

[26:23] this much money on a stranger things.

[26:26] So did everybody make 80% more money salary wise?

[26:30] Has everyone's portfolios gone up 50%?

[26:33] I'm just not sure where this is all coming from.

[26:36] I think the thing is this.

[26:37] It's like the people who are in this hobby have disposable income.

[26:42] And the ultimate reality is, is for these people, they can afford to spend $20,000 easily

[26:49] on a pinball machine.

[26:50] So maybe in their heads, they've been getting these machines at a discount all these years

[26:55] on all these games that were always worth less than 10K.

[26:58] But I think the new reality is it's getting easier and easier to say no.

[27:02] People who want to spend $30,000 on two Jersey Jack CEs.

[27:08] Does anyone want to really do that?

[27:10] Two pinball machines for $30,000.

[27:14] That's what they're priced at.

[27:16] Get ready for it, people.

[27:17] That's the price for two Jersey Jack CEs, even if they're not great machines.

[27:23] Like they're just going to charge you that regardless of what's in it.

[27:26] Stern Pinball is going to start charging you $12,000 for LEDs regardless of how great the

[27:30] game is.

[27:31] And I could understand if you want to spend $12,000 on Batman or Back to the Future.

[27:37] But do you want to spend $12,000 on Venom?

[27:40] Do you want to spend $12,000 on the Foo Fighters?

[27:43] And this is the thing, it's like in a world in which everything costs the same amount

[27:47] of money, I don't think you can do that when themes have different degrees of popularity.

[27:52] And also, if they're going to make a thousand of every single LE and CE moving forward,

[27:58] then nothing's really collectible.

[28:00] So my summary is this.

[28:02] Nothing is really that collectible anymore.

[28:05] Everything is overpriced in my book.

[28:07] And I do think if we keep going in this direction and flooding the market with $12,000 to $15,000

[28:14] games and games that used to be $8,000 are now selling for $17,000, if we keep going

[28:21] in this direction, so many people are going to wave the white flag and say, I'm done.

[28:27] I'm just going to enjoy my collection.

[28:29] I don't care anymore about these super high priced versions of games, because the other

[28:34] thing I think is happening is this.

[28:36] The ability to flex with your collection is disintegrating.

[28:41] Like people don't care, because remember, it was really cool when you got like a Jurassic

[28:46] Park LE for $8,000.

[28:48] It was really cool when you could get a Tron LE for $6,700 or find a Lord of the Rings for

[28:54] $7,000.

[28:55] But nowadays, if you're showing, hey, I just bought a Stranger Things LE and I paid $16,000,

[29:02] everyone's like, you're a sucker.

[29:04] You paid way too much for something and you didn't get your value in it.

[29:07] And I think that's what's happening with like toy stories.

[29:10] Nobody feels like this sense of pride or accomplishment in landing one.

[29:16] And for so many years, it was easy for all of us to get LEs, get CEs, pay what they were

[29:22] worth and then show people, hey, I just unboxed my game and I didn't have to spend 80% over

[29:29] the price of the game to unbox it.

[29:31] 80% over the price of the game just to have it.

[29:34] And I think that's where this hobby is headed.

[29:36] People are just like enough.

[29:37] We can't take all these prices.

[29:39] The market has not softened.

[29:40] It hasn't.

[29:41] It's still crazy high.

[29:43] Do you think I'm wrong?

[29:44] Like let me know.

[29:45] But that's just my sentiment is this hobby has gone through the roof.

[29:49] It didn't even happen slowly.

[29:50] Like someone just flipped a switch and all of a sudden all these stern LEs were double

[29:54] the price or 7000 more than they were new.

[29:57] It's bonkers.

[29:58] It's absolutely bonkers.

[30:00] Everybody thank you for joining the Canadian club if you're new and thank you for hanging

[30:04] out all these years.

[30:05] If you're not, I'll talk to you soon.
