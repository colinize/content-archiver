[00:00] Here we are back from Las Vegas back from a weekend filled with guns and

[00:29] fucking roses. Casinos, good friends, my twin brother. It was an amazing, amazing

[00:40] weekend and I have to say this I really didn't miss talking to you guys and I've

[00:44] been waiting, waiting, waiting just to get back and record the next podcast

[00:48] because it seems there's been so much commotion since we last spoke very, very

[00:53] briefly before I left for Vegas with the Pinside babies thread. It seems a lot

[00:58] of people took that thread to heart and had a lot of discussion. We were laughing,

[01:04] we were drinking whiskey and Vegas just reading the thread and seeing how Ben

[01:08] out of shape people were getting. I just want to address that thread real quick

[01:12] and then we'll move on to some other things to talk about on this episode of

[01:16] Canada's Pinball Podcast. But let's just call it like it is guys. If you don't

[01:22] want to listen to this podcast, you don't have to. It is so simple. You can just

[01:27] close out right now. You can hit pause on your MP3 player. You can take the

[01:33] earbuds out. You can turn the speakers off and you don't have to listen. You don't

[01:37] have to hear any of it. So there's that. If you don't want to engage with Canada's

[01:42] Pinball Podcast on Pinside, you also do not have to. You can simply drain the

[01:47] thread or just ignore it. It's that simple. The tools are all there but you know

[01:53] it's funny is all the people that cry the loudest and all the babies who

[01:57] whine the most about Canada's Pinball Podcast are the ones that listen the most.

[02:03] They're the ones that can't stop listening. They're the ones that are the most

[02:06] vocal and post the most frequent in the thread. So I don't know guys what else

[02:11] to do. I'm not going away. I love Pinball. I love talking about Pinball with you

[02:16] guys. But we're gonna have a different podcast here than everybody else. And if

[02:20] you don't like that, there are tons of other podcasts out there that would

[02:24] love to have your attention and your ears and your and and you be the audience

[02:29] for them. But if you want to listen to Canada's Pinball Podcast and you enjoy it,

[02:33] then we're gonna keep going. And we're gonna still do what we always do best. And

[02:37] one of the things that we're gonna do is we will call out people at times when

[02:41] they deserve it. And I'm not arbitrarily going out there and attacking

[02:45] individuals. I'm not putting words in people's mouths. But there is gonna be

[02:50] times when if you say something that I think is idiotic or moronic, I'm gonna

[02:55] call you out on this podcast. And if you want to come on and defend yourself,

[02:59] then come on the show and defend yourself. I think what really annoys people is

[03:05] that all those guys, and I'm not talking most of you, but some of those guys who

[03:10] I annoyed so much, all they wanted was to see me ban from Pinside. And now that I

[03:15] am, it just kills them to know in that they can't engage in a dialogue or

[03:19] defend themselves in the thread, the way they always used to, the way they used to

[03:24] just call me names and call me every game in the book. And then if I would

[03:27] retaliate, I would get moderated. My thread would get locked and eventually I got

[03:32] banned. So it's gonna happen in this forum and I invite you all on. So let's talk

[03:38] about Pinball. There's been a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff going on recently in

[03:42] Pinball, though last, seems like it's been like almost like a week since we last

[03:46] talked. So the first thing I want to do is I want to congratulate a very, very,

[03:50] very special person. Congratulations, Robert. Is it gagno? I hope I'm saying that

[03:55] right on winning Papa 19. Now for those of you who don't know Robert's story,

[04:00] Robert suffers from autism, but he's sort of found this amazing escape in Pinball

[04:06] where it really becomes something that he's that just brings him such joy. And he's

[04:12] able to sort of overcome some of the other hurdles he has because of the way

[04:16] Pinball allows him to focus and just sort of lose himself in the game. And he's

[04:21] an amazing story. And I recommend you guys watch the documentary on Robert that's

[04:26] out there. It's really, really incredible. And to see him win Papa 19 this year, I

[04:32] just want to say congratulations. I don't think he could happen to a better person.

[04:36] I don't think you could craft a more special story than that. So congratulations,

[04:42] Robert. It was great seeing you holding up your trophy. Really cool trophy. It's

[04:46] like a tack from Mars trophy. So congratulations, Robert, on winning Papa 19.

[04:51] Now speaking of Papa 19 and speaking of Pinball, I want to talk about a topic that

[04:58] is sort of on fire right now. And that is, it's a very simple question. Is Pinball

[05:03] a sport? Is it a sport? And there's a lot of dialogue back on forth.

[05:09] You know, people have different opinions about this. It's some say, of course it's a sport

[05:14] because you're playing it. Of course it's a sport because you're competing with people.

[05:19] And you know, it's a game of skill. And then there's, it ticks off enough of the box

[05:24] as to be a sport. Here's, here's my opinion about this. I don't, I, there are lots of

[05:30] different ways to define sports and competitions and in games of skill. But I like to think

[05:36] about sport a little bit differently. I like, I like to think about this way. I like

[05:40] to think that sports are played by people that are called athletes. Okay, let me repeat

[05:49] that. I think athletes play sports. And I think someone said a best in the thread. They

[05:55] said, I don't think anything's a sport where you can still play it when you have a broken

[05:59] leg. And pinball, it's not a sport, guys. It's a competition. It's a competition of skill.

[06:08] And I get it. And it's competitive. And you play against someone. But it's not a sport.

[06:13] It's not. And I want to tackle this from a few angles. The first is, there's no way

[06:19] that it's a sport when your preparation for pinball can sound something like this.

[06:24] You want it, don't you fat boy? You want it, don't I? Go ahead and have a bite. Just a little

[06:33] bite. One little bite will hurt you. Yeah, I think I just blew my ear drums out. But yeah,

[06:43] you could, you could have a box of donuts as you get ready to play pinball and then go play.

[06:48] I mean, come on. It's not a sport. And I think, I think too, when I'm at these pinball

[06:53] festivals and these expos and these tournaments, I think it's the only place I go to where I see

[06:59] grown men in their 40s. Literally walking with canes. I'm sorry, like guys who are way too

[07:08] young to be so physically out of it. And I get it. We all have different attitudes with food.

[07:15] And we all have different lifestyles and different exercise regimens. But if you're going to play

[07:21] as sport, I think you need to be somewhat in shape. And I think it requires some sort of physical

[07:26] training to get there. I think pinball is a competition. I do. I think it's a competition

[07:31] of skill like chess. I don't think chess is a sport either. I think it's a game of your

[07:36] mind and your wit and you know, and and and I hand coordination. But it's not, it's like,

[07:43] be like saying the game operation is a sport because it's your I hand coordination. But

[07:48] it's not a sport because you don't need to be physically fit to play it. Okay. So that's my

[07:51] opinion about pinball being a sport. So hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[08:08] So hallelujah. Hallelujah. The hobbits are shipping. People are getting them. This is a good thing.

[08:16] We are happy to see this happen. We are also happy to see there is a code update for the hobbit.

[08:21] I believe it's code 1.01, which is fixing some of the issues people have had with balls getting stuck

[08:29] in the popups and more modes are being added to this game. And I want to ask a question just out

[08:36] into the crowd here because I this is a game that we've had a lot of opinions about. And here is

[08:42] my question for all of you out there and I want you to email me or find a way to contact me and tell

[08:48] me what your opinions are. But how does one review the hobbit? I just don't know how to fairly assess

[08:55] this game. Every time I try to approach it, I get I get slammed or the JJP fanboys go nuts.

[09:03] And I just don't know what we're supposed to do. Are we supposed to just wait now for every

[09:09] code update and then review it again as if it's a new game? And I think that's the only way to do it.

[09:16] But I think it's kind of ridiculous that it's like this slow little journey

[09:22] considering the game has been in development for so long. I will always believe that I think the

[09:26] hobbit should have been further along. But I think that it's further along than people think it is.

[09:32] And I think that's another part of this game that you know I'm not quite sure about. You see in

[09:38] the thread some people are saying well there's a lot of modes in there. And there may be. But a lot

[09:44] of people are saying well those modes aren't really adding up to much though. You don't really feel

[09:48] like you're progressing through the game to get to some wizard mode or to get to some final thing.

[09:54] So it's really confusing to me like how do I review this game? I know that you can't review this

[10:02] game on location. It's impossible. You'll never really be able to sort of immerse yourself in the

[10:08] experience or understand what's going on out on location. So that means for me to review this game

[10:14] I either have to go find someone who has it who understands it who can let me on it to play it.

[10:22] Or we hear reviews from people who own it. Now the problem with that it's very simple.

[10:28] How often do you actually get an honest review from someone who owns it?

[10:34] Right? People who have waited years and have a lot of money in on it are always going to claim that

[10:39] it's incredible. And I get that you know it makes sense. But here's what I want to say about the

[10:44] Hopper right now what I've noticed is and this is just my overall assessment of where people are

[10:50] you know sort of making these claims that it's going to be so amazing because of all the modes

[10:53] that are happening. I saw someone say the other day they just added nine modes with the recent

[10:58] code update and that's more modes and some some other games have all together. But I think we're

[11:03] looking at these modes all wrong and a lot of them are just like really really really like short

[11:08] simple modes. They're not you know as long as modes in other games. But I try to look at a game

[11:17] and I look at when I had Lord of the Rings and there was maybe like six or eight modes from the

[11:22] movies that you started and then there was three multi balls. I kind of look at modes like pizza

[11:28] right. Imagine you have a pizza pie and imagine this imagine if all you really need to have an

[11:34] incredible experience is to have an entire pie of pizza and you cut up that pizza into eight

[11:40] different slices and each slice is is is the perfect amount each slice is rewarding you can eat one

[11:47] at a time and be satisfied if you don't eat the whole pie. But there's going to be times when

[11:52] you're hungry and you want to make it all the way through the pie. Here I am telling people

[11:56] they go eat an entire pizza pie when a little bit earlier I'm slamming the the physical condition

[12:01] of some of the pinball community. But this is more of a metaphor than me suggesting you go eat an

[12:06] entire pizza pie. But here's the thing I'd rather have a pinball machine where you have eight modes

[12:12] that are incredible and are give you just as much satisfaction and you want to get through all of them

[12:18] versus cutting each of those slices into smaller slices because you can take a normal size pizza

[12:25] and cut it into 32 different slices does that make it better right does that make the pizza better

[12:31] and and that's the thing with the hobbit is people are just saying that quantity is better than not

[12:38] better than quality but they're putting quantity as the most important thing like oh my god it has so

[12:42] many modes in the game oh my god he's going to be able to code for so many things but here's my second

[12:46] question if you have 32 modes how the hell are you going to get through 32 modes with three balls how

[12:55] the hell are you even get through 16 modes with three balls so it either means the modes are really

[13:00] short and easy to get through and I'm not sure how rewarding those are going to be or there's

[13:05] just too much in the game and then you're going to really really long ball times to get through it all

[13:10] which is also something that people don't really like so I think you couple a game that might be

[13:16] a little bit slower a little bit floatier with tons of modes and long ball times and I'm not

[13:21] necessarily sure that's going to be the game that everyone enjoys and and and I will but I just

[13:27] wish I knew how to like review it I wish I guess I'll just have to wait until it's finally done

[13:34] and when will that be weren't I'm not sure nobody's really sure but it's a good and here's

[13:41] here's my final point I want to say today though I do want the hobbit to turn out good I do I just

[13:47] think there's so much going against it because of all the weight and the hype and then you got the

[13:51] fanboys just saying this and saying you know it doesn't matter the shot layout the code's going to

[13:55] save it we'll see we'll see right but the thing is to see what we need to see might take another year

[14:03] to to complete it I just I don't know I who knows I wish this game would have came out with code

[14:10] that was much much further along or there was an explanation of how much percent of the code is

[14:15] done and what we can expect next so that's my take on that but what was interesting is I don't

[14:21] know if you saw today but there was an interview with Jack about Jersey Jack Pimball's game number three

[14:26] now a local reporter DJ blogger interviewed Jack and I want to play you the clip of what Jack said

[14:33] about Jersey Jack Pimball game number three I can tell you that Pat Lowe is designing and we have a

[14:40] team of people it's you know it's a full feature game it's something when you see it you say wow

[14:48] yeah it is true to what Pat Lowe's designs are it's a lot of fun and I've only played you know

[14:55] or shot the whitewood versions of it it's different whitewood versions of it it's picking up speed so

[15:02] you know we would expect it to be completed in the next several months and we expect to show the game

[15:11] and an appropriate time okay now for me to work so sorry I'm gonna I had to cut it there guys

[15:15] because like a like a forklift came into the clip and just makes this horrendous beeping noise

[15:21] for like a few minutes but I want to stop there and sort of analyze what Jack is saying so

[15:25] it looks like the game is in whitewood form which we all expected I'm just curious how long

[15:35] is this pin been worked on too it I feel like we've been hearing about Pat Lowe's game now for a few

[15:41] years right so I'm just really really really concerned about the amount of time that's going into some

[15:48] of these games and with the state they're at so they're at three years now and you've got I don't

[15:56] know maybe let's just say two years in development you're at whitewood with this thing

[16:00] um that seems like longer than it normally took these guys to make games back in the valley Williams

[16:07] days it's definitely longer than it's taking guys to develop pins for stern uh and it's it's

[16:13] concerning it should be concerning because I think what's happening is people don't have the

[16:18] deadlines the pressures to get stuff done and I think they're tinkering around with stuff for so

[16:23] long that it's and it's not making the product any better and I know I'm saying this without even

[16:28] seeing it but but in our experiences um when we've watched guys take their time making these like

[16:34] games that from you know designers of yesteryears and they get too much time to design a pinball

[16:39] machine it doesn't always end very well it doesn't end very well I think that there's something

[16:45] to be said about hitting deadlines and having deadlines but I want to go on to the next part of the

[16:51] interview where uh Jack talks a little bit about when we might see it and sort of like what the

[16:57] what sort of like the emotion of the game is and his games um they have a lot of fun features on

[17:05] them a lot of innovating features on them and they're really a funny kind of game so we're looking

[17:11] at game three to be a really kind of laugh out loud kind of funny game um in one of it well that's

[17:18] interesting a laugh out loud kind of funny game I don't think we've really heard that sort of

[17:24] uh description of the lawler game we've heard that it possibly might have a cell phone that it

[17:32] uses and and and and some other things but it's laugh out loud funny so it's going for like a

[17:39] comedic approach that's I think that's interesting I mean I don't know how I feel about that you know

[17:44] I don't I don't really know many games out there that really make you laugh out loud that are trying

[17:49] you know we elicit that much humor um there's definitely some whimsical themes out there but you

[17:55] know games like medieval madness or sort of based on a comical approach to medieval times so it's

[18:01] going to be interesting to see if you know they can get humor right because when it comes to pinball

[18:07] humor is really hard this also goes completely against what some of us were thinking it would be

[18:11] with some sort of natural disaster kind of theme I'm not sure I I know of a funny natural disaster

[18:18] that exists out there usually those are things that cause pain and suffering and people but

[18:24] maybe it's a funny earthquake game I don't know who knows um but uh Jack was on at the end of

[18:29] his interview to say something that is interesting let's listen you heard it here folks game three is

[18:35] coming from Jersey and the good thing about game three I'll tell you this good thing about game three

[18:39] is that it'll be on time because we didn't take any deposits for it we didn't promise any dates for

[18:46] so when it's ready it's ready and I don't think you should let it all be on time

[18:51] but it's awesome thank you oh jack forever the politician in his use of of things like it'll be

[18:58] on time because we've never set a date for it you know it's so I don't know how I feel about that

[19:05] I think the date that everyone was expecting to see pat lawler's game the date that's been

[19:09] floating around the community has been expo 2016 I think that is the date that everybody wanted to

[19:15] see it uh and so because expo is where companies reveal what's coming up down the line and

[19:22] I think if jack doesn't show it at expo 16 I bet you'll see it you won't see it until expo 17

[19:30] it doesn't sound like they're that far along with the game or it's near completion and

[19:37] you know and when you when you hear jack say things like well it's got you know you know many more

[19:42] months to go and you know it's not gonna we it's gonna ship when it's on time we're not taking pre-orders

[19:49] and then I see people in the thread saying oh well that means that everything's going great at

[19:53] Jersey Jack I mean if he's not taking pre-orders and he then things are great like financially

[19:58] that absolutely does not mean that at all they what what what how much money they've probably

[20:03] spent on pat lawlers game I mean they're making a whitewood they're prototyping it they're building it

[20:08] they're not ordering parts yet nothing nothing yet indicates whether or not they have enough money

[20:14] to build pat lawlers machine put them new in box get them on the assembly line it's all about that

[20:19] it's about getting the game on the assembly line and putting it in a box before you take a single

[20:24] dollar from people okay that's the difference between stern and everybody else it's a difference

[20:30] between you know stern doesn't require you to put money down before you place your order you

[20:36] you place your order you buy your game you get your game if you're not pre-ordering a game okay so

[20:43] you know I before Jack takes credit for this let's see it I want to see it I hope it comes true

[20:47] but he's yet to prove that he can do this so the next thing I want to talk about is we saw today

[20:56] alien from Zen Pimball the trailers for the alien Pimball game have been released and they look

[21:04] great yes it's digital Pimball it's not a real Pimball machine so they've got stuff like

[21:11] a little like holographic sagorny weaver you know shooting a flame thrower at the pop bumpers

[21:19] obviously that's not something you can do in a real Pimball game um but what you can do in a real

[21:23] Pimball game you know is is the artwork we can compare the artwork we can compare the shot layouts

[21:30] we can compare the toys and and and really say like which stuff is possible which stuff is not

[21:35] and I think the alien Pimball stuff has to be really annoying to Andrew and and orric and

[21:44] highway Pimball simply because the last thing you want is to have people's expectations set by

[21:51] what Zen is doing and a few things I want to ask and this is just I'm curious right yeah and

[21:57] then again on a can you just Pimball podcast we will ask the questions that you really can't ask

[22:01] on the thread because if you ask these questions you get attacked so question number one I want to

[22:06] ask is what kind of license did Roger Sharp set up with up between highway Pimball and Fox

[22:13] I know Roger Sharp does great stuff and he secures you know great licenses for for all these

[22:20] different Pimball companies and his history and Pimball is settled but this just feels like a

[22:25] shoe-string license that they have it on and explain why how did you secure a license where you

[22:30] don't have the exclusive rights to Pimball you can let someone else make a digital Pimball of the

[22:36] same theme you're making and get it out before your your game I think that is a bad licensing deal

[22:42] I think you need to sign a deal that says we're the only ones you can make Pimball both virtual and

[22:48] and like analog like real-life machine but that wasn't the case

[22:53] also let's talk about the fact that who is all over the Zen Pimball playfield

[23:00] Sigorni Weaver right she's in there so we know that her likeness in being used in a Pimball

[23:06] machine is something you can do did highway secure that license we kept hearing no that's why she's

[23:13] not on the play field you know and then you've got in one of the pictures and I want to go into

[23:18] the alien thread guys look at this one of the photos is really awesome you've got what looks to

[23:23] me like hand drawn airbrush artwork of of Sigorni Weaver holding the gun with the xenomorph behind her

[23:30] and it just looks awesome and then below her is a screen on the play field much like highway

[23:36] Pimball screen with sort of like the the radar to see where they to track the alien progress

[23:42] I mean super freaking cool and much better looking to having that dead center on the play field

[23:50] than just an art just a planet you know the the fact that they kept coming on saying that

[23:57] they were going for the space thing and they didn't really want to use the characters from the

[24:01] films it was ridiculous I think this looks really really awesome and you got like the marine

[24:05] tanger that like locks the ball and drops it out and there's some really cool stuff going on here

[24:10] and and sort of like the sides of the machine look like the hangers they look like the the

[24:17] Geiger sort of tunnels I don't know it looks really cool again not it's apples the orange is like

[24:23] get that but I just really really really wanted to to say that I think highways contract with Fox

[24:32] is they should come out and say what do they have at this point but what do they have I mean it's

[24:36] April 8th the game was supposed to be out a year ago they showed the play field like a couple

[24:41] months ago they've showed a video at it takes a pinball festival that they now say is not that relevant

[24:48] to keep showing alien days in like two weeks and I just want to know like what they got

[24:54] so the best way to like get an answer from these guys is just actually to reach out to them so

[24:57] I reached out to Andrew said Andrew how do you feel about Zen pinball showing their alien game today

[25:03] with Sigourney weaver all over it and here's what he said

[25:10] oh come on Andrew can't be that bad and so I try to calm back see if you felt you know if you

[25:15] felt different about it and he didn't or he wouldn't pick up so I decided like track or down and

[25:19] I finally got him I said or man you've been so critical of all these other pins and the artwork

[25:25] on it you keep telling us you couldn't use any hand draw on artwork on your alien pin and now we're

[25:30] saying the digital game has hand draw on artwork it has Sigourney weaver in it uh what's up man

[25:35] and tell us like what are your thoughts you're usually so vocal and you've gone quiet and here's

[25:38] what he said maybe I'm been keeping up on current events we just got our asses chick pal yeah and

[25:44] you know and and I and I heard through a lot of people that the reason why the alien threat is

[25:49] just kind of gone like dead and stale is that is that that Andrew and orc really aren't talking

[25:56] and the reason they're not talking is because orc's gone missing and and and Andrew's really concerned

[26:01] so he called all of his employees together uh and here's what he said as they were trying to find

[26:07] orc uh and get him back on the forms and and get him back commenting and being a spokesperson

[26:12] for the company listen up ladies and gentlemen our fears you did has been on the run for 90 minutes

[26:18] average foot speed over on even ground barring injuries four miles an hour that gives us a radius

[26:24] six mile what I want to be to every one of you is a heart target search of every gas station

[26:31] residents warehouse farmhouse hen house outhouse doghouse in that area go get him

[26:40] yeah I hope they find them I mean we really should I think after all we've been put through

[26:46] but by Pinsides creative director we should uh get his opinions at least you know on what he

[26:51] thinks of the alien artwork that is out there that is hand drawn and looks pretty damn good so

[26:57] um we'll see if he surfaces I think he's hiding somewhere but he can't hide forever eventually you'll

[27:01] have to come back uh what else is going on what else is going on oh so I want to sort of end oh

[27:07] one more thing before I end this show on on something that means a lot to me but uh I want to talk

[27:13] about the Terminator 2 that was for sale that I think the threat is gone now but it was probably one

[27:20] of the greatest price police threats I've seen in a long time a guy was selling his Terminator 2

[27:28] uh it was like he said it was like collector quality museum quality home use only all you know

[27:33] all the words we all throw out there to describe him all machines that are that look nice

[27:37] he's never seen one like this that is this nice and he went at 4500 dollars for it and everyone else

[27:43] just started going nuts that that was like twice the price of what a Terminator 2 should be

[27:49] uh people who were selling Terminator 2's that were of equal quality for much less we're chiming in

[27:55] and hijacking the threat uh I and I I say this look I've said it before the only person that has

[28:03] to be happy when you're selling a Pim-Mall machine is the buyer in the seller so it doesn't matter

[28:08] if some guy really wants a mint Terminator 2 and this is the only one available out there even though

[28:13] it's 1500 maybe 2000 more than people think it's worth and he buys it is that buyer an idiot

[28:20] no he's not he's getting what he wants but I will also say this and I say this from personal

[28:24] experience I think it is very important that the community does price police at times and the

[28:30] community does let people know what they should pay for stuff because if not people who are new

[28:35] to the hobby will get ripped off and I say this because I got completely ripped off when I started

[28:40] collecting arcade games because nobody really told me what it was what things were worth

[28:45] not and it wasn't their fault I just didn't know what they were worth the first place I went to

[28:49] buy stuff was on eBay which is the worst place you would go to buy stuff uh and then you know even

[28:56] when I started realizing that there was like obviously a variety of prices for things I was still

[29:01] getting fleece by like local guys who were selling arcade games and I you know I won't name names

[29:07] but you know someone's like oh I got a tron it's perfect you know and this and that this and that

[29:11] $3,000 $3,000 is what you would pay for the best condition restored tron imaginable I got

[29:18] something completely south of that I ended up restoring a lot of it myself and ended up selling it

[29:22] for 2500 bucks probably get he got $3,000 but I sold it again to a guy who was just building a

[29:28] game room he had no clue I could have charged four grand he was just excited to see tron available

[29:33] so I do think it's helpful but I also think that the newbies that are buying pinball machines are

[29:38] not coming on the pin side guys they're not new collectors a guy who just wants one pinball in his

[29:45] game room he might go on Craigslist he might go on eBay he probably might go to like a retailer

[29:50] who sells pinball in arcade games so yeah well so it's just silly watching the price please guys

[29:56] like you're just all battling yourselves back and forth and ultimately you know you're not helping

[30:02] the person who needs the help and you're really just using it as like a springboard to make some bold

[30:07] claims about you know how you know what things should be priced so it was fun to see that whole

[30:13] thread derail so we're at the 30 minute mark and I want to I don't want this podcast to be too long

[30:17] but I want to end on a sort of a sad note I saw that Nate shivers was going to sort of take a

[30:25] step back from podcasting and he was going to take some some time back in his life and still do

[30:32] pinball at the pros but not consistently do his podcast after doing 200 plus episodes and I want

[30:40] to say that it really does sad in me because Nate shivers is the main reason why I got into really

[30:48] into pinball as much as I love the game it was Nate's podcast that kept my excitement going

[30:56] each each week each month I would really listen to his podcast and feel such a connection to the

[31:01] hobby so I think his podcast coupled with pinside you know and and my love of like the machines

[31:08] themselves were the three main factors that made the hobby so exciting for me because if you remember

[31:13] about two years ago when you really wanted a pinball podcast there weren't that many out there

[31:19] and I think what separated Nate's show from the rest of the ones that were out there was he really

[31:24] brought like a personal element to to the to the hobby it was very much of about Nate and his

[31:30] experiences with the machines he had his talents from the crypt the collection he was building things he

[31:35] was looking forward to getting whether it was in americans most honoured I think I mean got him a

[31:40] talika I love the dynamic between him and Teresa about about pinball and how he would ask her questions

[31:47] and you know her opinion was always interesting because a lot of times we just keep asking

[31:51] diehard enthusiasts for their opinion and I love hearing what she had to say on stuff and it just

[31:57] felt like you were at this personal connection with Nate and it's why I really really really loved

[32:02] the podcast and and you know I think others have mentioned this and I and I can't say that I

[32:09] also didn't feel the effects of this but there came a time when Nate really wanted to focus his show

[32:14] more on competitive pinball playing and and helping people learn how to become a better or

[32:21] competitor competitive pinball player because that's what he got into and so you know he had done so

[32:27] many interviews and he had done so many personal stories and so now he sort of switched gears and

[32:32] made the show more about that and when that happened I think a lot of people who weren't into

[32:39] competitive pinball you know probably felt like they weren't getting the content that they wanted

[32:45] and that's fine I mean his numbers are still great but there's a ton of people who are

[32:48] are into competitive pinball but for me personally I mean I that's sort of where I just start to feel

[32:53] like every episode was about how to score on a pinball machine how to you know how I have PA points

[33:00] worked how Papa worked all the you know all the different tutorials on the games and everything and

[33:06] and it's sort of you know I felt like I lost a little bit of connection to Nate and it was more

[33:11] about learning about pinball machines and I felt like there were a lot more outlets for me to learn

[33:15] about pinball machines and and that is the one thing that I will miss I will miss sort of Nate sort of

[33:20] bringing more of his personal connection to it but I also think you know Nate deserves in a tremendous

[33:26] round of applause for all the energy and time he puts into it I mean for for those of you who do

[33:32] podcast knows of you who listen to podcasts out there it's not easy to find the time to do this

[33:38] it's not easy it's not just me putting on a headset and talking to you and rambling and it does

[33:45] take a lot more preparation in terms of staying in on the hobby reading the notes seeing what's going

[33:50] on those in that stuff takes hours and hours a week to stay dialed into that stuff you might just

[33:58] get a 30 minute 40 minute 12 minute canator rant podcast but there's a lot more that goes into it

[34:05] than just that couple with that when you do interviews and you have a pinball podcast it takes even

[34:10] more time I mean you have to research you have to come up with topics you have to keep the conversation

[34:15] going and then you're you're skyping with someone you have to find out a time networks to talk

[34:20] together and then when you're actually doing the interview in your head you're like I need to make

[34:24] this interview interesting I don't want you guys to listen to like a turd or just hear the you

[34:28] know regurgitate stuff that you've already gotten from that person or that guest so it takes a lot of

[34:32] work so Nate puts so much into it and then on top of that all the video work he's doing with pinball

[34:37] with the pros I can't imagine that that hasn't had taken over too much of his life and I think there

[34:43] was another thread that was just how deep are you in it and I know Nate must be in it really deep

[34:49] and I think he probably needs time to pull back I think a lot of us reach a point where you just

[34:53] get in too deep and you want to pull back for me I think my goals I want to find the balance where

[34:58] I don't get in too deep and I want to be able to keep talking to you guys multiple times a week

[35:02] and that's that's why sometimes you're going to get interviews because I've time to do interviews

[35:07] sometimes you're going to get a 12 minute rant that might get more listens than my hour and a half

[35:13] interviews and sometimes you're going to get episodes like this that are roughly around 30 minutes long

[35:18] but what I'll say this is you're always going to get something I hopefully that is entertaining

[35:22] that is fresh that talks about pinball and if you think this thread or this podcast belongs in the

[35:28] pinside basement where off topic things are discussed I don't know what to tell you we talk about

[35:34] pinball here and if you're too sensitive to talk about pinball and you want to run to the

[35:39] pinside moderators every time canator talks about pinball I think you should grow up I really do

[35:44] I think you're the grown men who run the moderators and complain about someone discussing pinball

[35:50] those are the biggest real pinside babies and I think they know who they are and they're probably

[35:55] going to listen to this and you know what they're going to do they're going to go run to the

[35:57] moderators and be like you're not allowed to talk about moderation on pinside he needs to be banned

[36:02] again and just stop just grow up talk join the conversation if you want to talk with me it's

[36:08] canada pinball you know how to spell it by now it's right there on the on the logo canada pinball

[36:13] at gmail.com and I'll happily have any of you guys on and speaking of that I wish Nate all the best

[36:19] and I hope he comes back and I hope he gets rejuvenated and refreshing it takes the time he needs

[36:24] but speaking of interviews I want ice man and I want bill brand is to come on the show together

[36:30] and the three of us can talk pinball I saw that in the thread I thought that'd be such a fun episode

[36:34] maybe we'll throw Ted into the mix you and have a four of us just all going back and forth

[36:38] so if you can reach out to them tell them to hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com so that's it

[36:44] for episode I don't even know what episode this is I think this is episode 28 of canada pinball

[36:49] podcast I want to thank all you guys for listening and there's some exciting interviews coming up soon

[36:55] and there's going to be some crazy rants coming up soon as well because I know you love them
