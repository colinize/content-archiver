[00:00] You know, some people love the holidays because of the eggnog, the presence, the family

[00:24] members, the trees, all the stuff, I love the holidays because it's twippy season,

[00:28] Ladies and gentlemen, the Twippies have kicked off today.

[00:32] And on this episode of Canatus Pimball Podcast,

[00:34] I'm going to interview Dave Sanders,

[00:37] whose designer of Highway Pimball's alien Pimball machine,

[00:41] because you might have noticed that this game

[00:43] is starting to tease itself as having a triumphant return

[00:48] into the Pimball marketing landscape.

[00:50] So I wanted to talk to Dave Sanders about his thoughts

[00:53] and his feelings on alien Pimball coming back into the world.

[00:57] And I think he's going to clarify

[00:59] some of the things we've been speculating about this game.

[01:02] But before I do that, a couple news items

[01:04] to talk about on this show first and foremost.

[01:07] Before we talk about the new Twippy Voting Standard,

[01:11] that's going to take place this year.

[01:12] I don't know about this.

[01:14] I think they might be trying to set up a system

[01:17] that's going to make it harder for a Canadian to win.

[01:19] But I'm not worried because we have the best fans in the world.

[01:22] Before I go there, I want to talk about another interview.

[01:26] Now that I've fixed my computer

[01:28] and I can do interviews again,

[01:29] this show is going to interview on December 3rd,

[01:34] which is just in two days, December 3rd.

[01:37] You heard it here first.

[01:39] You are going to get an interview with Gary Stern.

[01:42] So I can't wait for you guys to hear this interview

[01:45] with Gary Stern.

[01:46] And I think it's the only Gary Stern interview

[01:48] happening this week.

[01:49] Is there another one?

[01:50] I don't know.

[01:51] I don't know, but tune in December 3rd

[01:52] for Canadian Pimball podcast.

[01:54] A super awesome, exclusive interview with Mr. Gary Stern.

[01:58] All right, so let's talk about the Twippy voting system

[02:02] this year.

[02:02] And for some reason, for some reason,

[02:05] the Twippies, which have always been the People's Choice Awards

[02:08] in which people get to vote for their favorite,

[02:12] their favorite in the world of Pimball,

[02:14] their favorite designer, their favorite light show,

[02:17] their favorite podcast, or their favorite streamer,

[02:20] the show has gone off for three years now.

[02:23] But all of a sudden, they've decided

[02:25] to change the way the voting is going to work.

[02:29] So there's now a new voting format in the Twippies.

[02:32] And I want to read for you what the new voting format is.

[02:35] And you tell me that this is not.

[02:37] This is not totally such a new format

[02:40] that will actually work against a podcast or like myself.

[02:44] And I'll describe why.

[02:45] But let me read for you the new voting format.

[02:47] This year, people can choose their top two right in nominees

[02:52] for each category if they wish.

[02:54] These votes will determine nominees

[02:56] for the drop downs in the January voting.

[02:59] Okay, that's fine.

[03:00] We know we're going to make it

[03:01] into the main voting of the year.

[03:02] We will be one of the podcasts you can pick.

[03:05] But then here's the part where it gets super funny.

[03:09] During the January voting, voters can choose their top three

[03:14] for each category if they wish.

[03:17] This will count as three points for the first pick,

[03:20] two points for second pick, and one point for third pick

[03:25] for January voting.

[03:26] And we'll determine the winners of the category.

[03:29] Okay, so if the category is favorite pinball podcast,

[03:33] let's talk about this category.

[03:35] This means that if I get your number one vote,

[03:39] I get three points.

[03:40] If I get your, I'm the second favorite, I get two.

[03:42] And I'm the third favorite, I get one.

[03:44] And if I'm not on your top three, I don't get any.

[03:47] The problem with this system is simply this.

[03:50] What if you are like Canada,

[03:52] and you are a polarizing pinball podcaster?

[03:56] I am either going to be someone's favorite,

[03:58] or I am most likely not going to be on your list at all.

[04:02] But I might have the most amount of favorites,

[04:05] and I might not be on other people's lists as one, two, or three,

[04:09] but I might lose, and I can very easily lose,

[04:13] to someone who accrues the most number two votes

[04:16] throughout everyone's voting, right?

[04:19] Because people are more likely to put a podcaster

[04:22] as a second or third option,

[04:25] that they don't have strong feelings for or against,

[04:28] but they just might enjoy that show.

[04:30] I don't think I fall anywhere into that category.

[04:34] I think you either love this show, or you hate this show.

[04:37] But I do know this, if we were only counting

[04:41] people's favorite vote, your favorite vote,

[04:44] I'm going to get a lot of people's number one pick,

[04:47] but I'm not going to be your second or third favorite.

[04:49] I'm just not.

[04:50] I'm not that kind of guy, and it's not that kind of show.

[04:54] And I think this unfairly does give people

[04:59] who are challengers to the favorite selections,

[05:02] a much greater chance of sneaking in, of sneaking in a victory.

[05:06] Now look, I still think that we have the best fan base

[05:10] by far.

[05:10] I think we have the most listeners by far,

[05:13] so I'm not worried about Twippy voting,

[05:15] but it is very, very interesting that they

[05:19] decided to make this change this year.

[05:22] And you have to ask yourselves, why did the Twippy committee?

[05:25] And I've reached out to Jeff, and I've told Jeff this.

[05:27] I even uploaded onto my Facebook page, a scenario,

[05:31] which you can quite clearly see how it is very possible

[05:36] that someone who gets the most second place votes

[05:39] and doesn't get the most votes for number one or favorite

[05:43] can actually win the title of favorite.

[05:46] And this isn't just in the pinball category.

[05:48] This isn't all the categories.

[05:50] So I don't like this scale, because it's not weighted properly.

[05:54] The person who gets, or the game that gets,

[05:57] or the designer that gets, the most votes for favorite

[06:00] should win.

[06:02] Now that can actually not happen with the way

[06:06] they've weighted this scale.

[06:07] But why the change?

[06:09] Why the change now?

[06:10] And I'll tell you why the change,

[06:11] because this is the culture we now live in.

[06:16] You can't have people walking away discouraged.

[06:19] Everybody has to get a medal.

[06:21] Everybody has to be recognized.

[06:23] Everyone has to be given a new chance

[06:25] at lifting up the leader board.

[06:27] We just can't have it be the way it is.

[06:29] We just can't have one person, one vote.

[06:32] What's your favorite?

[06:33] Like that isn't that what this show is?

[06:35] What's your favorite?

[06:37] Not what's your second favorite.

[06:38] Not what's your third favorite, but this is the thing.

[06:41] It's all designed because you want the people

[06:44] at the bottom of the leader boards

[06:46] to have more of a fighting chance to move up.

[06:48] And it's imbalanced way of doing it.

[06:50] It's like when you used to play Daytona USA in the arcade,

[06:54] and you were like the leader, but the computer

[06:56] would assist the other drivers to make the race closer

[06:59] than it really is.

[07:00] And I think this is a move by the Twippy committee

[07:03] to make this thing closer than it actually would be.

[07:08] Because then your total is not the number of votes you got.

[07:13] It's the number of points you got.

[07:15] And the way this system is weighted is all wrong.

[07:18] And I told that to Jeff.

[07:20] And I don't know why they're doing it this way.

[07:22] I don't know what's up with the Twippy committee.

[07:24] But they can figure out all these different ways

[07:26] to try to make it closer and more even it out.

[07:29] But it's supposed to be these are everybody's favorites.

[07:34] Not their second favorite, not their third favorite,

[07:38] not what they had for dinner last night,

[07:40] not if they have a dog or not,

[07:41] you get an extra half a point.

[07:43] You can come up with all these cockamani scenarios

[07:46] in which you can start to arbitrarily give people

[07:48] points for different things.

[07:50] I mean, then you've got the Topper category,

[07:52] which is like this Topper cannot,

[07:54] like it has to be IP approved and release this year.

[07:58] And what's that about?

[07:59] All of a sudden, Pimbal mods need to have

[08:02] official licensing approval.

[08:04] Why?

[08:06] Like, what is that mean?

[08:08] So then you just cut off half of the mod community

[08:11] from being able to win these awards

[08:13] if they need to have like officially licensed IP products.

[08:16] Right?

[08:17] So why are we changing all of this?

[08:19] This is a niche hobby.

[08:21] It's very simple to understand one person, one vote.

[08:25] Isn't that how it works?

[08:26] One person, one vote.

[08:27] Now we have to have this, that,

[08:29] we have to, we have to weigh it differently.

[08:31] It's not, no, okay, over here.

[08:32] Okay, that wasn't, that's not an official endorsed Topper.

[08:36] This is that.

[08:37] And then there's not even like a drop down for Toppers.

[08:40] Yet you have a drop down of like 50 different streamers.

[08:43] My, my God, the entire thing.

[08:46] It's if it's not broken, don't fix it.

[08:49] If it's not broken, don't fix it.

[08:50] Why can't you just leave well enough alone?

[08:53] I mean, if I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win.

[08:55] If I'm gonna lose, I'm gonna lose.

[08:56] I don't really care.

[08:57] All I ask for in any damn election,

[09:00] or any damn voting thing,

[09:02] is make it simple and transparent to understand

[09:05] how you're doing it.

[09:06] You, you change in the roles,

[09:08] you're changing them each year, why?

[09:10] You have to answer that question of why.

[09:13] And it's not to make it more fair.

[09:15] It isn't.

[09:16] It's to even the playing field,

[09:18] which is not necessarily making it more fair, right?

[09:21] But we're still number one.

[09:22] And I, look, I, whatever happens happens.

[09:24] If we win, we win, great.

[09:25] If not, I will happily congratulate

[09:28] whoever takes the, the twippy for favorite Pimbal podcast.

[09:31] But I think you're gonna vote for Canada,

[09:33] especially after we interview Gary Stern this week.

[09:35] All right, so I have confirmation

[09:37] that all of these Pimbal Brothers tweets are authentic.

[09:41] These are coming from the Pimbal Brothers themselves.

[09:43] And before I air the Dave Sanders interview,

[09:46] I wanna just say this right now.

[09:48] I don't find this teaser campaign

[09:51] by the Pimbal Brothers to be very cute.

[09:54] I don't find it to be exciting.

[09:56] I don't find this to be an appropriate strategy

[09:58] for a company that still has not shipped people

[10:01] the games they paid for.

[10:02] People cannot forget, again, revisionist history.

[10:05] The Pimbal Brothers were always highway Pimbal.

[10:08] These were the investors in Andrew Highway's company

[10:12] from the very beginning.

[10:13] This is in some new entity.

[10:15] So don't be fooled.

[10:16] When they bailed out Andrew

[10:17] and then they bought him out and kicked him out of the company,

[10:20] they still did not get everyone who paid

[10:23] for their alien Pimbal Machine a game.

[10:25] And so now they're bringing the game back.

[10:27] And so what I wanna see versus a stupid teaser campaign,

[10:32] in which you're teasing a game that already came out,

[10:35] in which you already failed to get people

[10:37] what they paid for, what I wanna know

[10:38] from these gentlemen is, are you really making it?

[10:41] Is this for real?

[10:43] Are you going to make the buyers

[10:44] who didn't get their games whole?

[10:47] Like how are you gonna satiate those individuals?

[10:49] And if this is a new game, when is it happening?

[10:52] Who's making it and show us some proof

[10:54] that it's a real thing?

[10:55] Because the days of getting people excited

[10:58] with schematics, really schematics?

[11:01] I don't care about your schematics.

[11:02] I don't care what your plans are.

[11:04] The only thing that matters is that you know

[11:07] how to make these games, is that you have

[11:09] a manufacturing partner, and you have a manufacturing capability

[11:13] that's gonna deliver on this teaser campaign.

[11:16] And I think Pimbal, I think Pimbal companies

[11:19] that do it this way, that tease us with Raza

[11:22] and all the fancy designs of Deeproot,

[11:24] it doesn't matter anymore.

[11:26] Everyone is way too smart.

[11:28] If you don't know how to make a game,

[11:30] then don't bother with these silly teaser campaigns

[11:34] and these silly launch strategies

[11:36] that will never pay off for the consumer.

[11:38] I mean, most of the Pimbal companies out there,

[11:40] even when they're reputable,

[11:42] even when Jersey Jack Pimbal gets

[11:44] a super excited about guns and roses,

[11:46] look how hard it is just to get those games in boxes.

[11:49] And look, I will say this,

[11:51] if Alien Pimbal comes back into the world,

[11:55] the demand for this game is gonna be humongous.

[11:58] If they put a new artist on this game,

[12:00] and it looks stellar, like if Brian Allen jumps on this game

[12:04] and has a huge alien in Xenomorph

[12:06] in the middle of that play field,

[12:08] because I think they're gonna ditch the screen,

[12:10] the demand for this game will be through the roof.

[12:12] And I hate to say this, but we all know

[12:15] that if this game comes back and if Valley Williams cabinet,

[12:19] and it looks amazing with what's in this game,

[12:22] and they improved everything that was wrong

[12:23] with the highway game, people will step over

[12:27] the carcasses of those who got robbed by Andrew Highway

[12:30] just to get one.

[12:32] And I wish I didn't say that,

[12:33] and I wish that weren't the case,

[12:35] but this is Alien people.

[12:36] It's Alien, and if the game is built much better

[12:39] and can be manufactured at volume,

[12:42] they are going to sell this game.

[12:44] Now, the big question mark,

[12:45] which Dave does not answer,

[12:47] I'll just tell you that right now,

[12:48] is who's making this game, when is it happening,

[12:50] how much is it?

[12:51] And I think the only thing that would make total sense to me

[12:54] is if Chicago Gaming Company or American Pimball makes this game.

[12:59] I think those are your best bets

[13:00] that one of the big companies in America

[13:03] is going to make this game.

[13:04] And I've been saying this,

[13:05] I've already broken this exclusive that this game is coming back.

[13:08] And if I were a betting man,

[13:10] if I were a betting man,

[13:12] I would say that Chicago Gaming Company

[13:14] is making Alien Pimball.

[13:16] That is my bet, that Chicago Gaming Company

[13:19] is going to make Alien.

[13:20] I might be wrong, and if I'm wrong on that,

[13:23] I hope it's American Pimball,

[13:24] because other than that, where do you go?

[13:27] Where do you go to make this game?

[13:28] So will Canada's prediction be right

[13:31] that Chicago Gaming Company is going to bring back Alien Pimball

[13:35] and as partnered with the Pimball Brothers?

[13:37] It seems to make total sense.

[13:39] I know that they went to CGC,

[13:41] and I know that Ryan White is denying it,

[13:44] and that's why I think it's gonna happen.

[13:46] Because Ryan White, and I've spoken to him,

[13:48] he always gets like this,

[13:49] he's like, no, no, no, no, and then it's like, it happens.

[13:52] So we'll see, we'll see.

[13:54] I think there's also gonna be on Christopher Franchi,

[13:56] so he's got some alien news or exclusive

[14:00] he wants to break in the middle of December.

[14:01] So we'll see what that is.

[14:03] Maybe he's interviewing the Pimball Brothers,

[14:04] or maybe it's that it's gonna happen over at CGC,

[14:08] and he's been working on it a little bit.

[14:10] So not sure what the case is.

[14:12] So imagine if that's the news,

[14:14] that Christopher Franchi, whose art package

[14:16] and his art style would work so well with Alien.

[14:19] Imagine if he is reworking those assets for Fox

[14:24] in this game, and that's what's coming out

[14:27] from Chicago Gaming Company,

[14:28] and not Cactus Canyon Remake.

[14:30] So interesting times, interesting times.

[14:33] I'll tell you this, if I'm gonna be fully honest,

[14:36] all of it somewhat fatigues me at this point,

[14:38] because I'm so exhausted by the sheer amount

[14:41] of titles that are already out,

[14:43] and now we've got this hanging over the community.

[14:46] We've got Alien possibly coming back.

[14:48] We've got Cactus Canyon possibly happening soon.

[14:51] We've got Raze possibly happening.

[14:53] Led Zeppelin, you know, I mean, it's like,

[14:55] and we just allocated all this money to Avengers

[14:59] and guns and roses, this hobby.

[15:02] I mean, I swear, some of you guys,

[15:03] you guys all multi-millionaires,

[15:04] because how can this hobby maintain

[15:07] and sustain itself under the weight of all of these titles?

[15:11] I mean, aren't people at a room and at a money at this point?

[15:14] My God, exciting times.

[15:16] All right, everyone, get your Twippy Votes in.

[15:19] Cactus Pinball podcast.

[15:20] We'll see what happens.

[15:22] We are either your favorite show or you hate us.

[15:24] There is no in-between.

[15:26] My mama always said, strive for the top.

[15:28] You don't wanna be a B or C student,

[15:30] we're an A student.

[15:31] We don't want to be in the middle,

[15:33] but the middle could win this.

[15:35] Unbelievable, Jeff, what were you thinking?

[15:37] What were you thinking?

[15:38] Ladies and gentlemen, let's air Dave Sanders.

[15:41] I wanna welcome back to Cactus Pinball podcast,

[15:43] a man who's been on before,

[15:46] and you know him as Dave Sanders.

[15:48] Dave was the designer with Andrew Highway

[15:51] who made the alien pinball design back in the day.

[15:54] Dave, welcome back to the show.

[15:56] Yeah, it's been a long two years, isn't it?

[15:59] It's been a long two years for bloody everyone.

[16:01] Exactly.

[16:02] Now Dave, the reason why I wanted to have you back on

[16:05] is all of a sudden out of the blue,

[16:08] we're starting to see the pinball brothers resurface

[16:12] with some alien pinball teasers.

[16:15] What are your thoughts on just this from a macro level,

[16:18] like that this thing is coming back somehow?

[16:21] Well, first of all,

[16:23] it hasn't been entirely out of the blue.

[16:27] Anybody who's been following their Twitter accounts,

[16:31] they've been posting some like pretty abstract pictures

[16:36] and things with little tag lines and questions,

[16:40] tag lines and deliberately designed to be confusing,

[16:46] just little things of colors and whatever,

[16:48] and then they slowly started to morph into

[16:51] sort of like more and more alien related things

[16:54] until it was obvious that that's what it was about.

[16:57] And now they've just started posting the bits and pieces

[17:04] of the first few schematics.

[17:08] And that's just the point where it's just suddenly blown up.

[17:11] Right, so they started on October 10th

[17:13] with these really obscure sort of super closeups of stuff,

[17:17] you know, paint splatter,

[17:20] raindrops on a leaf, like all these weird things,

[17:22] and then in November, it started to get clearer

[17:25] that it was alien stuff,

[17:27] and then it just switched over to being xenomorphs

[17:30] and absolutely clearly alien stuff

[17:33] and then pinball related stuff.

[17:35] But the amusing part with the actual alien stuff

[17:40] is they were still trying to play the jokes.

[17:43] They were still trying to play the modern art jokes

[17:45] as, ooh, what could this modern art abstract thing

[17:49] as a fucking xenomorph?

[17:50] Right, now Dave, let me just ask you,

[17:52] do you think these gentlemen aren't a position

[17:55] to even be making jokes and teasers when people

[17:58] are still waiting for their game they paid for, right?

[18:01] They, not everyone who bought an alien got one.

[18:05] Well, that's getting into my history over the game.

[18:07] Let's skin it this way.

[18:09] Do you think that these guys are ready to come out

[18:13] with the machine?

[18:13] Have they reached out to you knowing that you design

[18:15] the original game?

[18:16] I have talked to Roger, yes.

[18:18] How recently?

[18:20] Quite recently, actually.

[18:22] And what's the conversation been like?

[18:24] Well, they're keeping the cards

[18:26] as you might expect, very close to their chest.

[18:30] Don't expect to get anything business related, anime,

[18:33] because that's the kind of thing that they want,

[18:39] that they're absolutely not going to devolve to this point.

[18:42] And even if they were prepared to,

[18:48] it would be entirely off limits

[18:50] for the purpose of this conversation.

[18:52] Right.

[18:53] So, I mean, I said this on the, the pin side thread

[18:59] when people were asking me about the schematics

[19:05] and about my input.

[19:06] And I said, well, basically I was seeing this,

[19:11] I could give my input on the schematics themselves,

[19:14] but I was essentially seeing this for the first time

[19:18] and that there's like been half a dozen occasions

[19:21] where you could reach out and ask,

[19:22] well, what's the story with alien?

[19:24] What's happening with alien?

[19:25] And I would reply in old truthfulness,

[19:28] you know as much as I do at this point.

[19:31] So, Dave, the things that I've reported on that I've heard

[19:36] to a pretty confident degree of certainty

[19:40] is that these gentlemen have made alien

[19:43] into a standard body game versus a wide body game,

[19:47] utilizing very much your design,

[19:50] but obviously making some alterations

[19:52] is that accurate that it's going to be standard body?

[19:55] From what I can tell with schematics?

[19:58] Now, it's going to be pretty much the same game.

[20:03] I could tell that from the underside of the play field

[20:07] and from where the mechs were positioned,

[20:10] where the t-nuts were positioned.

[20:12] There's probably a little bit of shifting about

[20:16] to make certain things fit because what they're doing,

[20:21] one thing I can immediately tell that they're doing

[20:24] is they're not using the parts that were designed

[20:29] for highway pinball purposes.

[20:31] They're not using the flip-flates, for example.

[20:35] Those look much more like WMS ones to me.

[20:38] Okay, you can tell by where things are laid out right now

[20:42] that this is pretty similar in terms of exactly

[20:45] to your specs that it's wide body.

[20:47] Because that's big news because we thought

[20:49] it was going to be standard body.

[20:51] It's definitely wide body.

[20:53] All four flip-flipers are there.

[20:55] All four flip-flipers are in the same place.

[20:57] All the shots look like they're there in the same place.

[21:02] What they've done above the play field,

[21:05] I mean, these being, well, the first schematic

[21:10] that they showed was below the play field.

[21:12] So I had to judge it based on that.

[21:15] There is one thing I can say,

[21:21] if they are going back to William's standards,

[21:24] then there's one specific difference.

[21:27] And this is to do with the cabinet.

[21:29] The William's games, as you know,

[21:32] are the play field is hinged with the two points

[21:37] close to the top of the play field.

[21:39] Right.

[21:40] And the play field rests on that,

[21:42] and it also rests at the bottom,

[21:44] and there is nothing in between.

[21:46] The highway pinball, the play field would rest

[21:50] on rails on the inside of the cabinet

[21:54] that came in around about half an inch on each side.

[21:59] What that meant was you could put,

[22:01] you could put screws in, you could put teenups in

[22:04] because you could embed those into the wood underneath.

[22:07] But any mechs that you were going to put in,

[22:09] the plates could not clash or the mechs

[22:12] could not clash with that half an inch space.

[22:16] And by going back to William's kind of system,

[22:21] that space that wasn't available to me before,

[22:25] because it was a bit of a restriction.

[22:27] That place, that space under the play field,

[22:31] they can use that again.

[22:33] So they can put in things like William's mechs

[22:36] and utilize an extra half an inch,

[22:39] which would make it easier for them to put the teenup.

[22:43] I'll give you one specific example with this.

[22:45] I could see with the schematic that they put up,

[22:49] they've got a second magnet in there.

[22:51] Early, well actually until quite late in the design process,

[22:54] but one of the original things that Arian was going to have

[22:59] was a magnet in the chest first area.

[23:03] The intent was that it could snatch it out of the lane

[23:07] and provide an extra feed for the flipper.

[23:12] OK.

[23:13] But the problem was that the magnet had to be so close

[23:16] to the edge that I found that it was going to clash

[23:20] with the rail that the play field put it on.

[23:24] And we tried thinking about various work

[23:27] around to make this work, like say, a diverter from above

[23:31] that would come down and so on,

[23:34] nudged the ball onto the magnet.

[23:36] But we started really, really, really overthinking.

[23:40] And eventually Andrew just throw up his hat and says,

[23:44] said, do we really need this?

[23:47] Do we really need two or three devices just doing this one

[23:51] thing?

[23:52] And as soon as he said that, the obvious answer was, well,

[23:55] no, we don't really, as long as we can compensate for it

[24:00] in other ways.

[24:01] But that second magnet is definitely on that schematic.

[24:06] It might just be there to stop the balls

[24:10] and it has a nice, slow feed for the flipper.

[24:13] It'll just drop it on it to make it easier for making things

[24:17] like the ramp shots from that upper flipper.

[24:19] But the magnet is definitely there.

[24:21] OK.

[24:22] Now, and that is where the magnet was

[24:25] with your original schematic.

[24:27] Or did they, like, who's working on any of this additional design

[24:31] if not you right now?

[24:32] I don't know.

[24:34] I have absolutely no idea.

[24:36] But is that where you had the magnet originally?

[24:38] The magnet was in that relative position above flipper.

[24:45] But the important thing is that the magnet is definitely there.

[24:48] OK.

[24:49] All right.

[24:49] So any other major changes is the screen still

[24:52] on the play field in the middle?

[24:54] Well, those square bits that you're seeing,

[24:57] those are the second ones.

[25:00] That's for the screen itself.

[25:03] I'm not entirely sure.

[25:04] I mean, I can't see any cutout window.

[25:10] But I do know that trimming off the bomb

[25:14] was one thing that they really wanted to do

[25:19] because the bomb on the behind-wing pinball version,

[25:23] because all the shenanigans that went on

[25:25] or all the pissing about and trying to add things

[25:29] or whatever, the 11th hour, the bomb did get kind of overinflated.

[25:36] There was definitely room trim the ball bottom one way or another.

[25:42] And if you lose that screen, I mean,

[25:44] that screen has shown you pretty much exactly what's

[25:48] on the larger screen, correct?

[25:50] Yes.

[25:51] It's a mirror of what's on the larger screen.

[25:53] Now, there was the cool radar mode, right,

[25:56] where you're seeing almost like the shots

[25:59] where the aliens are located.

[26:01] The motion tracker.

[26:02] Well, you won't see the shots.

[26:04] You won't see the shots themselves.

[26:08] You were seeing sort of like the proximity

[26:11] that the aliens worked or like coming towards you.

[26:13] And the game would also shout range X meters or whatever.

[26:19] Whether or not you actually would actually lose anything

[26:22] from the screen not being there.

[26:24] I mean, look at the thread.

[26:26] There's people saying,

[26:28] there's people saying they do, there's people saying they doubt.

[26:30] There was two years ago.

[26:32] I mean, I do remember I did like the way the ambush multiple works

[26:36] on the screen, but on the small screen bar.

[26:40] I don't know at this point, but I've actually missed it.

[26:43] And I do know having read so many threads about alien ownership

[26:48] that they were having issues with getting that screen level

[26:52] on the play field.

[26:53] The other part too, not for nothing,

[26:55] but that's a huge chunk of real estate

[26:58] where you could have beautiful alien artwork.

[27:01] Because that's the other thing.

[27:02] I think a lot of people are wondering

[27:03] and I was reading a orc loss

[27:05] and who did the original art package

[27:07] has not been in touch with the pinball brothers,

[27:10] which leads people to wonder

[27:13] if there will be an all new art package with this game.

[27:16] Have you heard anything about that?

[27:18] Nope, can't say that I have.

[27:20] I'm going by the same information

[27:22] that everybody else is at the moment.

[27:25] I have deliberately refrained from asking about particular things

[27:32] like that because, well, I gotta keep my mouth shut, you know?

[27:36] It's, why would they tell me?

[27:40] I mean, so Dave, you're just curious.

[27:42] So you haven't heard from the pinball brothers

[27:45] in a couple of years and then you recently heard

[27:48] as they were turning on this teaser campaign.

[27:51] So do you think that releasing these schematics,

[27:55] November 28th, or just a couple of days ago,

[27:57] that this is an indication of a game

[28:01] about to be announced?

[28:03] Hmm, that's a good question.

[28:08] But why do you do it then, right?

[28:09] Well, let me put it this way.

[28:10] Let me put it this way.

[28:12] If this thing does happen and it does come back

[28:18] onto the manufacturing blocks

[28:20] and everybody who wants an alien,

[28:26] there's still demand for the alien that that demand

[28:29] can be met regardless of how many total sales

[28:34] and regardless of the time scale

[28:38] that we're talking about here,

[28:39] because I have no clue about that either.

[28:42] As long as they can, as long as,

[28:44] if this actually happens, this will be the kind of healing

[28:50] step if you like, but I really kind of need it.

[28:55] Right.

[28:56] I mean, COVID, COVID, notwithstanding everybody

[29:00] went through so much shit, bathroom.

[29:03] And there was a point after a whole pinball folded

[29:10] where during tournaments and things

[29:14] where there was an alien has part of the tournaments,

[29:19] I couldn't bring myself to even to like really look

[29:23] or play it the thing for any real particular length

[29:28] of time without the kind of, you know,

[29:31] the trauma's starting to come back.

[29:34] I mean, it's like disengaging and got stared

[29:37] and just trying to relax and shit.

[29:39] Because that thing was, that thing was literally

[29:43] giving me pain at what point.

[29:45] Yeah, just the very sight of it made it too painful

[29:48] to enjoy seeing it.

[29:50] But let me ask you something, David,

[29:52] and I'm wondering if, who did,

[29:55] or I keep your memories.

[29:56] Yes, he couldn't even hold on to it.

[29:58] And he was saying today how this whole thing,

[30:01] and I think you feel the same way,

[30:03] it was a labor of love for all those involved.

[30:06] And he didn't make any money off of it.

[30:08] In fact, he lost a lot of money with all the time

[30:10] he put into the project.

[30:12] And I think everyone has a similar message that,

[30:14] when it was done, you guys were really proud

[30:17] of the game you made, but the painful journey.

[30:20] We couldn't enjoy it, exactly.

[30:22] We were proud of what we did, but we couldn't enjoy it.

[30:26] But it's a good two years.

[30:28] It's one over two years later now.

[30:30] And if this thing were to come out,

[30:33] and especially come out in the form,

[30:35] that it looks from the schematics

[30:38] that it's gonna come out in, I mean, those schematics

[30:41] are definitely not a one person,

[30:44] but at least one person has speculated this on the thread

[30:48] that, oh, they're just re-printing by the byway,

[30:50] pinball schematics, I mean, is there,

[30:53] what are we supposed to be doing with this?

[30:56] But I can tell you, no, that's not what you're looking at.

[30:59] Those are all new schematics.

[31:01] The newer one that they put up,

[31:03] which showed the RAM area and the high-pressing area,

[31:07] you have positions for optos on that.

[31:10] So you've got opto ramps now,

[31:12] instead of micr-switch ones,

[31:14] they're taking the micr-switches off.

[31:17] So those are brand new.

[31:18] But what I'm saying here is,

[31:20] given the amount of time that has actually passed,

[31:23] the machine would still have my DNA on it.

[31:27] I could still point to the machine and say,

[31:30] I did that, but enough time has passed,

[31:34] and there'd be enough distance, if you like,

[31:37] between myself and the machine again,

[31:42] but I can actually get excited for the thing again.

[31:45] I mean, I really do want to see what they do,

[31:49] what they put out, what else they've done with it.

[31:53] And more to the point, I actually want one.

[31:56] Well, and that was a question I was gonna ask you, Dave, too,

[31:59] because when I hear people talk about Alien,

[32:02] and it's not just the people who own it,

[32:04] but I've heard nothing but incredible experiences

[32:09] with the game, and everyone says it,

[32:11] if this thing just worked right,

[32:12] I know there's a lot of out of the box issues,

[32:15] the design and the code in this machine

[32:18] is so well executed that if you can just get

[32:23] the full package together, this game is gonna be

[32:26] an incredible pinball experience

[32:28] that a lot of people are gonna want to have.

[32:29] And do you feel like we could get there, Dave?

[32:32] I mean, it seems this is closer than nothing, right?

[32:36] It's definitely closer than nothing.

[32:38] It also makes perfect sense for the game

[32:46] to be as close to what it was physically as a layout

[32:52] to remain a wide body, to have all the shots,

[32:54] to keep everything in it, because you've got that code,

[32:57] you've got all the audio visual side,

[33:00] you've got all the stuff the American team did

[33:03] that everybody loves about the game.

[33:05] Why would you flush that down the toilet?

[33:08] You would have to, you make it into a standard body,

[33:14] you would have to take stuff out.

[33:16] You would certainly have to take stuff out with the shots

[33:18] because there are so many sort of like

[33:20] crisscrossing cross-play field angles.

[33:24] They're all intersect each other and layers

[33:27] are players with the design as well.

[33:29] I mean, out of all the designs that I had

[33:35] at Highway Pinball,

[33:36] the most geometrically complex one was Adrian.

[33:40] Right.

[33:41] You could not just cram that into a standard body

[33:45] and lose nothingness, no way that was gonna happen.

[33:48] So it was either, so especially if the

[33:53] redevelopment costs were a part of the equation,

[33:56] what you'd save from making a standard body design out of it,

[34:02] you would have to spend in redevelopments

[34:06] and fund costs and everything else would be code again.

[34:11] So what would you really be saving?

[34:13] But you've already said, Dave, you can see from that

[34:15] underneath schematic that it's the same design

[34:18] as the wide body.

[34:20] Maybe what I've misheard or what people have misinterpreted

[34:24] is that it's going into a,

[34:26] is this even like accurately to say it,

[34:28] it could go into a standard Valley Williams wide body cabinet.

[34:33] And I think what people mean is that the highway cabinet

[34:35] was Andrew's own design,

[34:37] that it's going into a Valley Williams standardized cabinet

[34:41] that's a wide body.

[34:42] I don't even know if that's accurate to say it that way.

[34:44] You mean a super pin?

[34:46] Well, I mean, the super pin size.

[34:47] Yeah, I mean, yeah, what's the,

[34:49] is there like a proper terminology

[34:52] for a wide body Valley Williams cabinet?

[34:55] Well, yeah, the whole format was the super pin, right?

[34:58] Okay.

[34:59] The half a dozen games from...

[35:01] Twilight Jones.

[35:02] Twilight Jones.

[35:03] Indiana Jones, Red and Ted's Roadshow.

[35:05] Those were a third to last a super pin.

[35:08] And the play fields were a specific size.

[35:13] It was 23 inches wide by 46 inches long.

[35:19] And that was the format that I used for design

[35:24] for the highway games.

[35:27] Now, that means some of the stuff that the lit up cabinet artwork

[35:30] that might change and be more of your traditional standard

[35:34] cabinet artwork, but all that stuff, right?

[35:37] I mean, what I always hear about Alien,

[35:38] what makes this game so praised by people

[35:43] is the way it immerses you in that alien world,

[35:46] but light show, the callouts,

[35:49] the atmosphere, I think is the best word.

[35:51] Like the atmosphere around this game.

[35:53] And then of that's going to be lost.

[35:54] It's exactly the same thing that you say

[35:57] about Guns and Roses.

[35:58] Right.

[35:59] It may not have absolutely everything

[36:03] that you think of in there,

[36:06] but when it comes to the immersion,

[36:09] it's like greater than some of its parts.

[36:12] Right.

[36:13] And that's what Pimball is supposed to do.

[36:14] It's supposed to transport you into the world you love

[36:18] of that theme.

[36:19] And each game goes about it differently.

[36:21] And it's not just the sum of the toys.

[36:23] It's sometimes it's just an experiential thing.

[36:26] And I think Alien is a lot like G&R in that aspect.

[36:29] Yeah, and it took G&R to actually put this to click with here.

[36:34] Yeah. No, it did.

[36:35] I mean, I've been like, oh, where are the toys?

[36:37] Like where is the complex mechs?

[36:39] And I'm like, well, what if the actual machine itself

[36:42] is the experience?

[36:44] And you can't look at it one mech at a time.

[36:46] You just got to say, hey, did I just feel like

[36:49] I was in the Alien movies right now?

[36:51] And if the answer is yes, did I just feel like

[36:53] I was at a G&R concert?

[36:55] If the answer is yes, then the machine maybe has done its job

[36:58] in transporting you there.

[36:59] That's certainly what the American sub of the team did.

[37:02] It brings up an interesting question.

[37:03] I mean, you've had all sorts of, I mean,

[37:06] your criticisms of Iron Maiden, for example,

[37:11] that I've always been along the lines of,

[37:13] I don't see what's in here.

[37:15] This, this, okay, it looks nice.

[37:18] It flips nice, but I don't see anything in here.

[37:21] But you're on the Iron Maiden fan.

[37:23] Do you think if you were an Iron Maiden fan,

[37:26] you would have come to this conclusion

[37:29] with Iron Maiden sooner than you did with Guns and Roses?

[37:32] You know, it's an interesting question

[37:34] because I don't, when I play Iron Maiden,

[37:37] two things are going on in my head when I play it.

[37:39] One is, I know this game was designed as archer.

[37:42] So I know from the beginning, it,

[37:44] that's true, that's that.

[37:46] You know, they just layered on it

[37:47] the Iron Maiden theme.

[37:48] So the stuff that's in that game,

[37:51] I know from a designer standpoint,

[37:53] it was never intended to be made in at the beginning.

[37:57] But also, like, I don't know exactly,

[37:59] like what's the goal of Iron Maiden in the game?

[38:03] Um, I haven't played Iron Maiden very much.

[38:06] Some games that will transcend the music itself

[38:09] and there are some that do not.

[38:11] I personally don't think Iron Maiden does.

[38:15] It's meant to be Iron Maiden.

[38:17] I, Guns and Roses, I definitely wanna play Guns and Roses,

[38:23] but the whole experiential thing,

[38:25] it's not my sort of music either,

[38:26] but I did like the data east comes and Roses.

[38:30] Yeah, it's interesting,

[38:31] because music pins all go about it differently.

[38:33] The, they do.

[38:34] You know, like, I would argue that the Aerosmith toys,

[38:36] probably the coolest, the toy box is probably one

[38:39] of the coolest things in these music pins.

[38:41] But ultimately, I think all music pins are really designed

[38:44] for fans of those bands that wanna just have an awesome,

[38:48] like, fun way to rock out to their favorite music

[38:50] in pinball format.

[38:51] And what G&R does that none of them have done before

[38:54] is try to make the pinball machine reflect

[38:56] what it's like going to see that band in concert.

[38:59] So that's what I think what I love about G&R

[39:01] was just the unique approach to how Eric thought about it

[39:05] from a creative design standpoint

[39:07] that that had never been done before.

[39:08] Ooh, what have been done with Queen, you know?

[39:11] That's kind of, I looked at, I look,

[39:15] I look at Guns and Roses and I think more,

[39:19] that's kind of what we were trying to go for with Queen

[39:21] because that's what the, the band wanted.

[39:23] So speaking of Queen, speaking of Queen,

[39:26] so this has been something that I've rumored

[39:28] to be possibly switching over to a stern title

[39:31] in the near future.

[39:33] Was Queen designed by you, Dave?

[39:35] Is there like a Queen layout somewhere

[39:37] in the files of a computer somewhere

[39:40] and on Andrew's like boat that he's rolling around in?

[39:44] Wow, Queen, Queen was given the battery.

[39:47] Once we had all the stuff about the licensing,

[39:50] once that was sorted out and we knew

[39:52] what they wanted for the game.

[39:53] I mean, I, I, I, I,

[39:55] I looked together, preliminary designs and concepts

[39:58] and layouts for, uh, for, for Queen.

[40:02] So where did the band want?

[40:03] The band wanted the live aspect.

[40:05] Now the thing about Barry's work was,

[40:09] feedback that he was getting from Andrew

[40:13] was gone awful.

[40:15] Barry ended up working on three games at, uh, one time.

[40:20] And Queen was, I think, the one where he was least allowed

[40:27] to sort of like be himself as it were.

[40:30] So when we, when we had these sky calls with, uh, Andrew,

[40:34] myself, Andrew, Barry,

[40:38] but what would predominantly happen was Andrew would,

[40:41] would have thought of an idea in between sky calls and then say,

[40:47] Oh, can we squeeze this in here?

[40:48] Can we put this idea in here?

[40:50] And then Barry would have to go away and then just like cram

[40:55] everything over to get this new idea in.

[40:58] That's really, really not how you're supposed to design a game.

[41:02] You really do need to have as much in your head as possible

[41:06] as or as much down on paper.

[41:08] The things that you want and the things that you can do

[41:10] before you start really drawing things up.

[41:15] What was the worst thing he suggested that was anything specific

[41:19] that you guys were like, Oh, man, really?

[41:21] Oh, God.

[41:23] Yes.

[41:24] Wanted to do with Queen, but, but, um,

[41:28] the very, very worst thing that Andrew ever suggested.

[41:31] And this scuppet, this thing right from the start.

[41:35] Oh my God.

[41:37] There was a game where the very first thing Andrew said about it was

[41:44] he wanted it to have a 14 ball multi wall.

[41:48] And he wanted some kind of ski lift kind of system in the

[41:53] shooter lane that would deposit balls to a secondary area

[42:00] to be kept for multi ball.

[42:02] And the only reason he wanted the 14 ball multi ball

[42:07] on this game was to break Apollo 13's record.

[42:10] What game was that?

[42:12] Ah, well, I don't know if I can actually say

[42:16] a because I don't know where things are going to,

[42:19] uh, going to stand with that design.

[42:22] I mean, I did do quite a, did you quite a bit of, uh,

[42:25] stuff with, um, Barry with some of these, uh,

[42:30] did the number 14 matter or was it just an arbitrary thing to beat

[42:35] the Apollo 13?

[42:36] It was entirely arbitrary.

[42:37] It was before any design had even started.

[42:40] Andrew would basically scuppet this thing with that,

[42:43] without bloody idea, um, before we even started.

[42:47] So it was one of those things where one sandwich would go.

[42:51] First chance we got, we ditched that fuck.

[42:55] He Andrew walks in.

[42:56] He's like, hey guys, I couldn't afford the Friday to 13th

[42:59] license, but I did get his Friday the 14th.

[43:01] So, uh, let's get to work on this.

[43:04] I'm sorry, it wasn't anything to do with it.

[43:07] Oh man.

[43:08] Any other like crazy, I don't know, do you,

[43:10] I mean, does it feel more cathartic now for you to talk about

[43:13] some of these crazy highway stories as it feel good to just

[43:16] air them out or?

[43:17] It, it's more like I kind of got to get them out.

[43:21] Otherwise I'll fucking not.

[43:24] Ask me about, ask me about the plastic and metal deck on full throttle.

[43:29] Yeah, let's do it.

[43:29] Tell us about it.

[43:30] Yeah, the chain loop accelerator.

[43:33] Oh my god.

[43:37] When, uh, full throttle became, uh, full throttle.

[43:43] One of the ideas, all the stuff that made it full throttle over

[43:46] and above my design, none of that was my idea.

[43:49] I am distancing myself from it.

[43:52] Fucking immediately, all right?

[43:53] None of the stuff that seems like the spinning wheels,

[43:57] the spinning wheels were originally going to be,

[43:59] this was actually a good idea if we could have made it work.

[44:02] But, uh, oh, let's call it part of took one look at the idea and say

[44:06] those will never stand up to anywhere and tear.

[44:09] The spinning wheels were originally intended to be so like spinning

[44:12] bumpers that would raise about, uh, up the playfield.

[44:16] Uh, so it makes like big thick rubber cylinders

[44:20] that you would have to shoot between.

[44:22] Okay.

[44:22] Uh, I plan the shots around those.

[44:26] Um, that's why, one reason why they're, they're that size,

[44:30] because they were the size of the motorbike wheels on the, uh, on the playfield.

[44:37] I mean, as spinning wheels, I mean,

[44:39] that's what the things were absolutely bobbin.

[44:41] They did, they did, they did, they virtually did do jacks,

[44:45] shit.

[44:46] So, um, but this chain loop accelerator was this thing.

[44:50] It was the, it was supposed to be this thing that was some like

[44:54] the supercharger on getaway.

[44:57] It was like doing the ball doing, uh, stunts in a loop.

[45:01] Now the problem with the thing was the big problem with the thing was from, uh,

[45:06] from a mechanical and from a physical standpoint.

[45:09] I knew immediately this thing would never work.

[45:11] Not in a million years, because the point of the, uh, of the, uh,

[45:17] getaway supercharger is, first of all, it's horizontal.

[45:21] It's always lying flat.

[45:22] Right.

[45:23] And second, and this was the way it was marketed specifically,

[45:27] there are no moving parts on it.

[45:29] There, uh, it's all done by magnets, okay?

[45:33] And you could take the supercharger, the supercharger would have

[45:37] break down.

[45:39] If you had a fault with the supercharger, you wouldn't lose anything on getaway.

[45:43] It just not, I mean, William, William's games were designed with this kind of

[45:48] code failsafe in mind.

[45:50] If something were to break down, then the game could carry on without it.

[45:55] So if the supercharger was to go down on getaway, then I assume,

[46:00] give me the points and you would just give me a ball back.

[46:03] But given that it was all magnet driven, the chances of it actually breaking down,

[46:10] I mean, really, really, really way it would actually break down, I assume.

[46:14] Ben Heck could probably, um, tell you more than I could,

[46:19] but I would assume that the only way it would really break down was optofalia

[46:23] or if the magnet's overheated.

[46:25] Right.

[46:26] And the magnets are, uh, magnets are not on long enough for it to overheat.

[46:30] I could just continually pulsing.

[46:33] But anyway, the chain loop accelerator, the thing with a chain loop accelerator is

[46:38] it wasn't horizontal.

[46:40] It was vertical.

[46:42] So you were expecting the ball to be able to sort of like loop up and around and go

[46:47] a distance and then come back down.

[46:50] And it was sort of like squeeze to fit into the, um, around the area where

[47:00] there was already, there was space allocated for sort of like a roundish kind of, uh, of toy.

[47:07] So it was trying to squeeze into space that nothing had been intended to squeeze into.

[47:14] And I just, I hated the idea of the thing, even if it, even if it actually worked,

[47:21] I hated the idea of the thing because it was, it wasn't quite a loop.

[47:25] It was sort of like a, a big, big half loop one end.

[47:31] And then it's sort of like a smaller half loop another, uh, the other ends, okay.

[47:35] And now you can see where this is going.

[47:37] Um, when we finally got the, the, the, the first mock ups of the,

[47:44] uh, the, the, the chain loop accelerator frame back the, uh, the metal loop with the,

[47:50] uh, plastic guards around it.

[47:53] And we got this thing back as she was not in the room.

[47:57] When we are back this day, but we were holding this thing in our hands and we could suddenly see

[48:04] what shape it was.

[48:07] Oh, man.

[48:08] And the size that it was.

[48:11] Oh, I mean, just, it was literally looked like a plastic and metal deck.

[48:22] It literally did.

[48:24] Oh, but, and it was like, yeah, I mean, but isn't that what for throttles all about?

[48:31] Oh, it isn't that way they call it for throttle.

[48:33] Laughing are asses.

[48:35] I don't know.

[48:36] Oh, I'm sorry.

[48:37] I'm sorry.

[48:37] My way this thing goes.

[48:40] And just like, you know, so far as to just like just do pretend depicts with it.

[48:48] Because it looks so goddamn happy.

[48:54] Oh, my God.

[48:56] So when, so this leads me into, uh, another thing about the alien design.

[49:02] I mean, after, after the, um, yeah.

[49:08] So, so first moment I got that, that, that, that, that, that's your living accelerator.

[49:12] That was not going anywhere near for throttling in million years.

[49:16] But it may be, it made me that much more weary of Andrew's ideas, not just from a conceptual

[49:23] point of view, but from a logical and a visual point of view.

[49:28] So the next thing that came up, this is when, um, oh God.

[49:32] This was alien.

[49:33] My way was, we were trying to figure out what to do with the chest buster.

[49:37] Um, how to get, have a good chest burst effect on alien.

[49:42] My preferred idea at the time would have been to have some like feel area where you had some

[49:46] of a dead troopers like sprawled on his back.

[49:50] And, uh, some like, uh, a bloody stomach area.

[49:53] Now to that area, out of the stomach area, you'd have a single drop target that had the,

[49:58] like the chest burst to design.

[50:00] So it popped up and down like, uh, like a chest burst to actually work.

[50:04] This was, um, this idea was, I think it was vetoed at the same time as the magnet.

[50:10] Andrew's idea for a, for a chest burst effect.

[50:16] This was all on the exit to the, uh, reverse so rap.

[50:22] Between the reverse so and a habit trail.

[50:24] Every time, uh, he would have had a flesh covered,

[50:28] covered plastic torso on the exit of the reverse so ramps.

[50:32] And every time you shot the reverse so the ball would go through this thing.

[50:37] But the ball would go through this thing and then go onto the habit trails.

[50:40] And I, uh, after the, after the fall throttle, the bloody chain loop fiasco.

[50:48] The very first words I said, I knew exactly what this thing would look like when it, uh,

[50:53] when it came out, I just, I just flat out said to him, there is no way I am putting a

[50:59] shitting ass on this game. Oh, man. So as a designer, is it just annoying when you have someone

[51:08] who doesn't understand design or geometry or just optics, like how stupid something's going

[51:14] to look to have them weighing in and trying to sort of armchair quarterback the design of a

[51:19] pinball machine? Well, the thing is you do need a fresh pair of eyes because it's very, very

[51:25] easy to get. It's very, very easy to get too close to a design where you can't see the bigger

[51:32] picture, you have to focus on what you're doing. Okay. You have to have somebody come in periodically

[51:40] with a fresh, fresh pair of eyes and tell you from their perspective, either that's not going to

[51:47] work or I don't like that feature. Well, it's a new day now, right Dave? So where do you go from

[51:53] here? So recently, correct me if I'm wrong, but you are the design behind the punny factory

[52:00] game, right? Yes, I did punny factory to their brief to the, uh, I was working, I built it up in, uh,

[52:09] visual pinball first. I still use visual pinball as a design tool because I've got this large pool of,

[52:16] accurate components that I use and I tested geometry of shots and things with it first. And with

[52:23] with pine factory, I mean, we knew that this was going to be, I mean, just as mafia was essentially

[52:30] team pimples first draft, punny factory, they, um, they wanted to know that we could give them

[52:40] what they wanted and that we could also put our two penathon and say, well, how about if we do

[52:47] things this way? How about if we, we can do this, but we need to do it in this sort of a fashion?

[52:54] How much of a synergy was there between the two groups? Because, uh, see, I mean, that's what we

[53:02] lacked at highway pinball was that synergy, okay? Uh, the, the American side of the team ended up

[53:10] literally saving alien because they were so far away from Andrew and they were so close to it as

[53:15] a group that Andrew could not push them around. Right. So it was more, it was more enjoyable

[53:20] making punny factory for you. It was more enjoyable making punny factory. No pun intended. Let me ask you

[53:26] a question because, you know, Dave, you, you've released and designed more games in the last 10

[53:31] years than John Papa, who cares? And I'm curious, like, as a designer, do you, oh, that, that, that,

[53:37] that means more than zero. Right. Well, as a designer, how, did you check out the Raza stream? I'm

[53:44] just wondering what your point of view is. I haven't actually checked out the Raza stream. So,

[53:49] Dave, thank you so much for taking a time to talk about this stuff. How do you feel now? Do you

[53:54] feel a lot better? Hopefully that this could give you the closure you want and also, you know, maybe

[53:59] get alien out into the world in a way in which others can enjoy it and you can finally enjoy this

[54:05] game you worked on so many years ago. Yeah, it's been good to talk about it. There's, there's, there's

[54:12] still a lot of healing that I've got to do and it's been very, very difficult for me. Certainly this

[54:17] service, this, this past year where everybody has been so boxed in. So, but yeah, I have been

[54:25] feeling more and more sort of like withdrawn. I've been trying to keep myself working, but it's been

[54:33] kind of hard, kind of slow. Right. Sorry, kind of slow, but then this news comes along and it

[54:40] and it gives me hope again. Okay, seeing what they've actually done with alien. I mean, yeah, I've

[54:45] said, this is the kind of healing that I need and this kind of just the chat we've had just now,

[54:51] this is the kind of chat. This is the kind of opening up that I need to do. Yeah, Dave, I'm happy to

[54:56] chat with you, you know, even off the show, you know, that and so like, I think this community does

[55:01] help a lot of us sort of get through this time. Oh, okay. Help me up time, my baby. Yeah. Uh, when they,

[55:06] when the company shut down, yeah, something. Yeah. It's just in jet. I mean, this is why we need hobbies.

[55:10] We need hobbies and things we enjoy so we can connect with people because this has been the year

[55:17] where we have not been able to connect out in the open and out in the wild. So Dave,

[55:22] always a pleasure having you on and you know, here's to a better 2021 for all of us. Hopefully

[55:26] this game comes out sometime soon. I'll drink to that and I'm not even I'm not even a drink. I'll

[55:31] still drink for that. Well, Dave, thank you. Have an awesome night, my friend and we'll talk soon.

[55:36] All right. Thanks. Yeah.
