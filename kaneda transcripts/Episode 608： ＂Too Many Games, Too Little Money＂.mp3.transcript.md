[00:00] I can feel it.

[00:02] All the way from the Westbury Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, the pinball world is about to explode

[00:07] with so much happening we're going to talk about it.

[00:09] I want to give a shout out to the poor man's pinball podcast we're going to miss you guys

[00:12] on the air.

[00:13] We're going to miss you Ian, no way Drew can replace you, but you know it's about to happen

[00:17] in pinball.

[00:18] They'll be back on the air together because there's so much exciting stuff about to pop.

[00:22] This is going to be episode 608 of Canadian pinball podcast proving you don't need an hour

[00:27] to give you all of what's happening in pinball.

[00:46] Welcome to episode 608 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:49] The only pinball podcast with 140 subscribers on Patreon.

[00:54] I want to thank my latest contributors Josh Kaye, Oliver D. Garrison T. Craig R. Thomas

[01:01] C. Matthew A. Stuart B. Tim O. I think that's the latest.

[01:06] We have 140.

[01:07] I don't want to give a special shout out to those who contributed to Brenda's birthday,

[01:11] bash and hector.

[01:13] You are overly generous and Mr. Kim forget it.

[01:15] You take the cake.

[01:16] Here's what we're going to do on episode 608 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:19] I'm going to tell you why.

[01:20] I think this is going to be the most exciting four months heading in to the fall winter.

[01:26] We've seen in pinball in many years.

[01:29] As you know, COVID has delayed a lot, which means there is a lot about to pop in pinball.

[01:34] If you're not excited about what's about to happen in pinball, I don't know what to tell

[01:38] you.

[01:39] I think this is going to be the most exciting four to six months.

[01:42] We've seen in pinball in a very, very long time because a lot.

[01:46] That has been waiting to drop is going to drop on our laps and many of us are going to

[01:51] have to tell the wives.

[01:53] I'm sorry, babe, but we're not going on vacation this year because I just bought four pinball

[01:57] machines that I don't even need.

[01:59] Let's go down the list of manufacturers and let's talk about what's about to happen with

[02:05] each of these companies and why you should be excited and why you need to get your wallet

[02:10] stacked for what's about to happen in pinball.

[02:13] We have to start with stern pinball, the biggest player in the industry that just never stops.

[02:18] It is happening, people.

[02:20] Keith Ellwin and Zombieiti's Godzilla is going to be revealed to the world in September.

[02:26] I am hearing it is going to be the second week in September.

[02:30] Why am I excited about this title?

[02:32] Not just the fact that Zombieiti is still working up to this deadline to make sure these

[02:35] three art packages are incredible, but I heard directly from Keith Ellwin when he dropped

[02:42] Avengers.

[02:43] He told me just wait to see my next game.

[02:46] I don't have any restrictions.

[02:49] This game is going to be either the greatest, most exciting stern pinball machine we've seen

[02:54] in a really long time or it's going to be the biggest disappointment ever because your

[02:59] expectations are through the roof.

[03:01] But I want to say internally over at Stern, they weren't that excited about the Mandalorian.

[03:05] You know it.

[03:06] I know it.

[03:07] Everybody knows it.

[03:08] Brian Eddie even knows it.

[03:09] This is the game that I think is going to show everybody that Stern pinball is the Godzilla

[03:15] of the pinball industry and this is going to stop on everyone who's been talking so much

[03:22] trash about Stern pinball over the years in terms of them not having mechanisms, them

[03:27] not putting a world under glass.

[03:29] I expect this game to be the ultimate take my money now game from Stern in the last

[03:34] five years.

[03:35] Absolutely.

[03:36] You're hearing it now.

[03:37] The problem is for all of you out there who want to get a Godzilla Ellie, good luck trying

[03:42] to get one because all of these distributor lists are way too long and you invited all

[03:47] of your rich friends into the pinball hobby and now there is no room for anyone new to

[03:53] get any of these Ellie machines.

[03:55] There are way more than 500 or even 750 people out there that will shell out over $9,000

[04:03] for a pinball machine and I'm here to tell you right now that Godzilla Ellie will be the

[04:09] first Stern Ellie to cost more than $10,000.

[04:13] This thing I think is going to be between $10,200 and $10,500.

[04:18] Now, is Stern going to deliver a game that looks like it has $10,000 worth of stuff in

[04:23] it?

[04:24] Are they going to give us internet connectivity?

[04:26] A $10,000 piece of technology can actually connect to the internet and we're going to

[04:32] celebrate and pay more for that.

[04:34] Think about how archaic this industry has been that the leading technology company in pinball

[04:40] still does not connect to the internet and then you wonder why people make fun of us

[04:45] for being into pinball because no matter how new it gets, it's still a really old ridiculous

[04:51] toy that we're all putting in our homes.

[04:53] So Godzilla is coming.

[04:54] I expect this game to be insane.

[04:56] I'm telling you right now, the best way to get a Godzilla if you can't get in on the

[05:01] distributor list, Stern is going to sell a few of these direct.

[05:06] Now unfortunately that means that you have to sign up for that crappy Stern insider club,

[05:11] but if you do, that is your best bet to get one at MSRP because you know what's going to

[05:16] happen.

[05:17] You know what's going to happen when Godzilla comes out.

[05:19] This game is going to be flipped for way more than $10,000 and you best believe Stern

[05:24] is watching all of these prices.

[05:26] They're watching all of these Mandalorians sell out immediately and then get sold for way

[05:31] more than $9,200 bucks.

[05:33] You know, this is where pinball is headed.

[05:34] There's nothing I'm going to do or you're going to do about it unless you keep your money

[05:38] in your wallet.

[05:39] These companies are so much smarter now and they're going to bake in these prices into their

[05:44] MSRP's moving forward.

[05:45] But that's not just it from Stern pinball, right?

[05:47] It's not just Godzilla.

[05:49] We also have back to the future coming.

[05:51] Now is back to the future going to be a game in 2021.

[05:54] I don't think so.

[05:55] I think it's going to be next year.

[05:56] I think next year the big titles will be back to the future and James Bond.

[06:01] Now James Bond was designed by Steve Richie.

[06:04] He worked on two white woods before leaving Stern, but I best believe George Gomez will

[06:09] be finishing James Bond.

[06:11] I also am here to predict and I'm just this is just a prediction.

[06:14] I don't have any information on this.

[06:16] I am here to predict is I think one of the Stern artists from yesterday years might make

[06:20] his way back at Stern and his talents might make their way onto James Bond.

[06:25] I'm just going to guess that maybe Mr. Franchi could be the perfect artist for something

[06:30] like James Bond.

[06:31] We'll see what happens.

[06:32] I think that Yeti and Franchi are the perfect one to punch at Stern pinball.

[06:36] I think both of their styles are perfect and I would love to see Franchi back at Stern.

[06:41] But man, it's just like I'm in on a Godzilla Ellie.

[06:43] I've already got my order in.

[06:45] And for those of you out there saying it's not fair that Kaneda has a Godzilla Ellie,

[06:49] I'm here to tell you when you do 608 podcasts about pinball, you make some friends out there

[06:56] in the world.

[06:57] And I know for some of you out there, just because you have money, you think you should be

[07:00] able to get one at MSRP.

[07:02] It's not about money.

[07:03] It's about time invested in this hobby and it's about the relationships people have built

[07:09] with their distributors.

[07:11] If you walk into a restaurant and there are no seats available and I know the owner,

[07:16] it doesn't matter how much money you have.

[07:18] He's going to sit me down over you and that's what's happening in pinball.

[07:23] Those of us who have been in this hobby for many, many years, we are not going to have

[07:27] a problem getting Ellie's.

[07:29] For those new guys out there, welcome to pinball.

[07:32] It's a doggy dog fight to try to get these Ellie machines.

[07:35] And then there's rush pinball, which I absolutely am not a fan of rush.

[07:38] I could care less about rush pinball and I know for many of you out there, there are

[07:43] rush fans out there.

[07:44] But I think rush is a B level title.

[07:47] It is not a cornerstone and I know I get an argument.

[07:50] But even if they release it as a cornerstone, it will not be that successful.

[07:55] I think rush is a B theme and I think it's going to be treated like such and I think rush

[08:00] is going to come out as a reskin of something else.

[08:03] So we'll see if I'm right on that.

[08:05] So after a stern pinball, spooky pinball is in the driver's seat.

[08:10] They are making games left and right every day now.

[08:13] The photo of their manufacturing facility is amazing.

[08:17] I am so happy seeing spooky pinball making Halloween and ultra man's side by side.

[08:23] And these games are going to be going out the door.

[08:25] I think like maybe the end of this week, it looks like stuff is ready to go out.

[08:29] Now I think a lot of you and you know this and I know you won't admit this.

[08:33] But I think a lot of you ran into the fire and grabbed the game.

[08:37] Now you're wondering whether or not you really want it.

[08:40] The good news is for spooky.

[08:41] It doesn't matter for them.

[08:43] They've sold through every single game.

[08:45] It doesn't matter if you think the Halloween music is annoying.

[08:48] It doesn't matter if you think ultra man actually looks more fun.

[08:51] It doesn't matter.

[08:53] They did the smartest marketing move of the year.

[08:57] And spooky pinball's goodwill continues to pay them back beautifully.

[09:02] And this company is the greatest example of how a boutique pinball company can go from

[09:08] making a hundred and fifty games a year to selling 1,750 games in just a matter of minutes.

[09:16] It was just a matter of minutes.

[09:18] In just a few hours, all of these games were sold through.

[09:21] And I have confirmation that I'm getting ultra man number 500.

[09:25] It will be the last one built.

[09:27] It will be a collector's edition with a butter cabinet.

[09:31] And I am super excited to get that possibly like a year from now.

[09:35] And I need to wait until I have a house.

[09:37] And that's why I asked for number 500 for those people complaining about it.

[09:41] I don't know what to tell you.

[09:43] You didn't ask for number 500 and you're not canada.

[09:46] Those two things working against you.

[09:47] So spooky pinball in a great position and there's nothing really new from them other than

[09:52] making these games now.

[09:53] I also know that TNA 2.0 will be coming out at some point.

[09:58] But let's also be honest.

[10:00] Who really still cares about getting more TNAs?

[10:03] I really don't think they need to make more TNAs.

[10:05] I think if you want a TNA, you can go get one.

[10:08] But dropping TNA out again, it just doesn't seem like something they need to do.

[10:13] All right, Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:15] The company with I think made the best masterpiece in guns and roses this year with also the

[10:20] worst customer service of the year as well.

[10:23] So you put those two things together.

[10:25] You put your arms around Jersey Jack Pinball and you have a somewhat of a weird hug, right?

[10:29] It feels somewhat good.

[10:31] But it also feels like someone's giving you a wedgie at the same time.

[10:34] So Jersey Jack Pinball has been somewhat of a mixed bag this year.

[10:38] I will say it looks like the guns and roses games that have been going out most recently

[10:45] have had better results than the ones that went out earlier in the year.

[10:50] I'm hearing from owners that there might be less clear coat on it.

[10:53] Now is that the fix?

[10:55] We don't know.

[10:56] It's really hard to tell what this company's future is with their quality.

[11:00] I'm not here to tell you.

[11:01] I haven't figured out.

[11:02] I know that they've made some hiccups along the way and ultimately it will come down

[11:07] to this.

[11:08] I still think Jersey Jack Pinball makes incredible machines.

[11:12] I think guns and roses is a masterpiece.

[11:14] I think if you can't enjoy the machine because the play field has some issues, I think Pinball

[11:21] might not be the hobby for you.

[11:22] And I don't mean that your complaints are not valid because they are.

[11:26] We never should have had this issue.

[11:29] But when you play the game and the lights are out in the room, I can guarantee you that

[11:35] having a little pooling on a few of those posts is not going to detract your ability to

[11:40] enjoy this machine.

[11:42] So I hope that they finally figure out this problem because we all know that Toy Story

[11:47] is coming.

[11:48] And I keep seeing on Pinside people are wondering is Toy Story the next game?

[11:52] It is the next game.

[11:54] Toy Story was supposed to come out before Willy Wonka.

[11:58] Disney got mad that they took so long.

[12:00] Pat Lawler takes forever to finish a game.

[12:04] And so we know that Toy Story is next.

[12:07] Toy Story, I don't think they're going to show Toy Story before the end of the year.

[12:11] Because they need to have a line ready to go with it.

[12:15] They will not show Toy Story until it is on the line.

[12:19] Remember what they did with guns and roses?

[12:21] 100 G&Rs were already built and in a box on the day they revealed guns and roses.

[12:28] So Jersey Jack Pimbal is going to go for the same thing because otherwise they would

[12:32] be going in the wrong direction.

[12:34] But we do know this.

[12:35] They don't have a second line up and running.

[12:38] They've got the room.

[12:40] They've got the money.

[12:42] But they just don't seem to have the personnel yet to have a second line running.

[12:47] And Jersey Jack as a company, if it's actually to fit into the big boy pants that they purchased,

[12:53] they need to figure out how to have multiple lines going a year.

[12:57] And not just to make like Toy Story and guns and roses, they need additional lines that

[13:03] can also make some of the wide body games that people will always want from them.

[13:09] People will always buy a new inbox was.

[13:12] People will always buy a new inbox pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:16] And they're not stupid over there.

[13:19] And I don't care how many times they tell us they're only tooled up for standard edition

[13:23] games now.

[13:24] That's a load of BS.

[13:26] They could easily create a wide body line.

[13:30] That's like the third line that just prints money.

[13:34] All of these games that people now want.

[13:37] How much could you charge for a pirate to the Caribbean now?

[13:41] Right?

[13:42] Jack Pimbal could release another version of pirates, a la Yellow brick road Wizard of

[13:47] Oz, and charge all of you $15,000 per pop on a game that's already designed, already

[13:55] coded.

[13:56] Everything is just, you just got to order it and screw it together.

[14:00] And they could charge $15,000 for each one.

[14:05] And why wouldn't they do that?

[14:07] Why would they gamble?

[14:08] And when they can easily print money?

[14:10] And why isn't Eric Minier a millionaire by now?

[14:14] I really, I just don't understand.

[14:15] Like the money is just waiting to go towards them.

[14:19] And I think they are going to realize that.

[14:21] And they will ultimately have to get those lines going.

[14:25] The Steve Richie Hire solves no problem for them.

[14:28] That's not the problem they have.

[14:29] They don't need another designer.

[14:31] They need more manufacturing.

[14:33] They know that.

[14:34] They know that.

[14:35] You know that.

[14:36] So I don't think we're going to see Toy Story this year.

[14:39] Toy Story is going to be a game that we see early 2022.

[14:43] I think they're going to hold it for Texas Pimball Festival.

[14:45] And I think that's what's going to happen.

[14:47] Toy Story is going to be a great example of whether or not this company is going to continue

[14:52] to load their games up.

[14:54] Or is it going to be a little bit more stripped down like Willie Wanko was?

[14:57] I think people forget that Wanko was stripped down compared to Dildan, you know, compared

[15:01] to some of the other games.

[15:03] Let's go on the Chicago gaming company.

[15:05] This is the one.

[15:06] They're the ones.

[15:07] This company any day now is going to launch cactus Canyon remake.

[15:11] It will have complete code.

[15:13] It will have artwork, I think, by Christopher Franchi.

[15:16] It's going to have an interactive topper that's a shooting gallery.

[15:19] This game should have been out in July.

[15:22] It is now almost end of August.

[15:24] This game could drop two day.

[15:26] It could drop tomorrow.

[15:27] And when it does drop, it's going to sell out instantly.

[15:31] I'm telling you right now.

[15:33] And I've spoken to people who have seen it.

[15:35] I've spoken to people who have played it.

[15:37] This game is going to sell out so fast because when people see how much is in this game

[15:43] and they see how much it cost and they see the final code of the game, it's going to be

[15:49] a take my money now kind of game.

[15:52] You're going to put cactus Canyon remake next to Mandalorian.

[15:56] And then you're going to see how Mandalorian has nothing in it.

[16:01] And then you're going to see cactus Canyon and be like, this is what pinball is supposed

[16:05] to be.

[16:06] A world under glass in which a pinball interacts with a lot of fun stuff.

[16:10] Isn't that what pinball is all about?

[16:12] Yup.

[16:13] Bally Williams knew it.

[16:14] And now you're going to know it when you see this game from Chicago gaming company.

[16:18] Now the delay has been forever.

[16:19] People are tired of waiting.

[16:21] But this is not the end of what they have planned.

[16:23] I think CGC has three major games coming.

[16:28] And I think this is just one of them.

[16:30] And then I think we're going to see Mark Richie's pulp fiction.

[16:33] And I also think we're going to see Mark Richie's sci-fi game.

[16:36] Now Mark Richie's been working on these games for a very long time.

[16:40] He's probably done with both.

[16:42] And so I think we're going to see that.

[16:44] I think Lyman Sheets is going to end up over there.

[16:47] That's where I think he's going to end up.

[16:49] And I don't care what Ryan White says.

[16:51] If you're Lyman Sheets, you're not done coding pinball machines.

[16:54] You're the best in the world at it.

[16:56] And where is he going to go?

[16:58] This seems like the natural place for Lyman Sheets to end up.

[17:01] But that could be any day now.

[17:03] I actually think people will be ordering Cactus Canyon remake before Godzilla.

[17:08] And I think if they're smart, they need to get it out before Godzilla.

[17:12] It's still going to sell out.

[17:13] And again, unfortunately for everybody out there, you're going to have to tell your partner

[17:18] that you blew the vacation money because you bought Cactus Canyon and Godzilla and you

[17:23] just bought Mandalorian and you just ordered a spooky machine.

[17:26] And see how silly it gets so quickly and you're still waiting on your guns and roses.

[17:30] Oh my God, what did I just do, honey?

[17:32] I just spent $50,000 on pinball machines this year.

[17:37] And we're going to act like this is not a rich person's hobby.

[17:40] And we're not going to act like it's first world problems that the upper post is chipping

[17:44] in a pinball machine.

[17:45] Oh my God, most people don't even have running water or electricity in the world.

[17:50] And here we are, crying about play fields.

[17:54] And I love it.

[17:55] It should be, we should be getting what we pay for though.

[17:57] All right, American pinball, American pinball, David Fix's big promises.

[18:01] When will they come out?

[18:02] American pinball is another company that has been waiting and waiting and waiting.

[18:07] I have confirmation that their next title is this.

[18:10] It's a three word game.

[18:13] All right, legends of Vahala.

[18:16] Is it that?

[18:17] Is it nightmare before Christmas?

[18:21] Could it be that?

[18:22] Sonic the hedgehog?

[18:24] I don't know.

[18:25] I think it's legends of Vahala.

[18:27] I think that's going to be it.

[18:29] But they have more than just that game coming.

[18:31] So American pinball is another company where I think they have about three titles, possibly

[18:37] ready to go.

[18:38] And it's just going to be a matter of how they shuffle the deck.

[18:41] Now they're probably going to want to shuffle the deck just to prove Canadian wrong.

[18:46] David Fix came out of the gate, swinging really hard.

[18:49] This company has never had a success.

[18:52] They do build a stellar game.

[18:54] If they can give people the right theme, the right world under glass, people will go to

[19:01] American pinball.

[19:02] They will not have a problem selling games because they build a great game.

[19:07] It's a great quality product.

[19:09] They've just made three games nobody wants.

[19:13] And I've said it before, if you have manufacturing down and you can't get designed down, you

[19:19] have to work really hard to do something really stupid.

[19:23] Because that's the stupidest way to run a pinball company.

[19:27] It's usually the other way around, right?

[19:30] Designing is the easy thing.

[19:31] Picking a great theme is the easy part.

[19:34] It's manufacturing.

[19:35] That's the hard part.

[19:36] Just go talk to Deeproot about that.

[19:38] All right, so we'll see because American pinball has to come out with these games too,

[19:42] like any day now.

[19:43] And I think they're going to be the one that's left holding the bag because I think they

[19:47] waited too long.

[19:49] And I think by the time they show their game, they're going to be up against Godzilla

[19:54] and they're going to be up against cactus canyon remake.

[19:56] And I don't care how rich you are.

[19:59] Nobody wants to spend more than 30 to $40,000 on pinball machines in one year.

[20:05] I don't care how big your house is.

[20:07] You probably don't have enough room for all of these machines you just ordered.

[20:12] And you're probably waking up, staring in the mirror and saying, what do you do, man?

[20:17] You don't even need any more games.

[20:19] Why are you going in on every single new game?

[20:21] And here's going to be the problem.

[20:22] It's going to be a bottleneck.

[20:24] All of these games are going to be coming out in a short window of time.

[20:28] And you're going to have to make some tough decisions.

[20:30] But the other thing that's going to happen is this, the scalpers are going to love this

[20:34] period.

[20:35] I'm telling you, and it's not just canada.

[20:37] People are going to gobble up everything and just flip them for money.

[20:41] And you're going to see it and there's nothing you're going to be able to do to stop it

[20:45] unless you get off of the hype train.

[20:48] Unless you stop caring about the L.E.'s and the C.E.'s and just enjoy Pimball.

[20:53] I hope most of you go that other direction.

[20:56] I hope you realize that nobody cares that you've got the L.E. of anything or the C.E. of

[21:01] anything.

[21:02] Nobody really cares in general that you're a grown man putting many Pimball machines into

[21:07] your house.

[21:08] I was sitting at Gremolin Castle in Ireland in the cocktail bar with all of these gentlemen.

[21:14] And we were talking about world affairs.

[21:16] We were talking about Afghanistan.

[21:17] We were talking about the Olympics.

[21:19] We were talking about cryptocurrency.

[21:21] And I said, gentlemen, lend me the I.E.'s photo minutes.

[21:24] Can we quickly talk about the new Beska-Elle version of Mandalorian-Elle Pimball machine

[21:30] and whether or not we think it is frozen at $11,000 or if that price might go up the

[21:36] 13.

[21:37] And they looked at me like, are you crazy, man?

[21:41] Nobody here.

[21:42] Nobody in the real world wakes up in any situation and wants to have a conversation about these

[21:48] over-priced Pimball machines.

[21:50] Never forget this fact.

[21:52] Ten years ago, if you put $10,000 into Tesla stock, $10,000 into Tesla stock, 10 years

[22:00] ago, is now worth $1.8 million.

[22:03] Think about how painful that is for Frolic to look down his Pimball collection and be

[22:08] like, oh man, I could have had like $8 million bucks right here.

[22:12] Instead, I've got Mustang LE and I've got full throttle.

[22:16] All right.

[22:17] All right, let's keep going.

[22:18] P3 multi-morphic.

[22:19] Jerry over at P3 continues to do this really weird marketing thing where he's like, we've

[22:23] got a license theme coming, but then he also says, but we're much more than that.

[22:28] We're much, no, Jerry, you're not.

[22:30] You're not much more than your license theme.

[22:32] He's already backtracking.

[22:34] I can, I can see it.

[22:35] I can see it.

[22:36] Like, he knows he doesn't have a huge license and that's why he's saying we've got a license

[22:41] theme and so much more.

[22:42] Like, no, Jerry, yeah, don't.

[22:44] The license theme is going to be what I think you need to get this company really where

[22:50] it needs to be, which is like, people want it.

[22:53] It's now been like eight years, maybe more than eight years, like 10 years.

[22:58] This is like the slowest marketing campaign ever to get people to adopt this P3 multi-morphic

[23:04] system.

[23:05] And everyone's been saying the same thing to Jerry for the last eight years.

[23:09] Jerry put a theme on this thing that people want.

[23:13] He hasn't done it yet.

[23:15] It's not heist.

[23:16] It's not Lexi Lightspeed.

[23:17] It needs a licensed theme.

[23:20] And so I hope the license theme he has is going to knock our socks off.

[23:25] It's really hard because it's really expensive.

[23:27] And if you buy it, here's the problem he's always going to have.

[23:30] You only really want it if you want kind of all of the games, right?

[23:34] Like, do you want Canon Lagoon?

[23:36] Do you want heist?

[23:37] Do you want Lexi Lightspeed?

[23:38] And you know, I don't see that's the thing.

[23:40] It's like, you can't sell a platform unless you want a decent amount of the games on the

[23:46] platform.

[23:47] If all Nintendo had was one game and every other game was like, eh, Nintendo wouldn't

[23:52] take off.

[23:53] Same thing with Xbox and PlayStation.

[23:54] So P3 multi-morphic, I hear the heist is great.

[23:58] I can't wait to play it.

[23:59] It looks like it's a lot of fun.

[24:01] But Jerry, I hope this theme of yours is going to be a take my money now theme and not

[24:06] something like Candy Crush or like Angry Birds.

[24:08] So we'll see.

[24:09] Next on the list, Dutch Pimball.

[24:11] So here's one I want to say about Dutch Pimball.

[24:13] And I've been reading in the threads and I've been reading what people are going through.

[24:16] I want to say right now, we've forgotten about a group of people out there in the world.

[24:21] And those are the early achievers.

[24:23] Now, I don't think they're doing what they said they were going to do.

[24:26] They're making the games.

[24:27] There's been a delay.

[24:28] But they said they were going to make about four machines for every EA machine.

[24:33] They're not doing that.

[24:34] And the EA's are still out to dry.

[24:37] They're not getting a lot of communication.

[24:39] And I think we can't forget about them.

[24:41] And I know a lot of people are going in on this machine and the machine is beautiful.

[24:45] It is my favorite world under glass.

[24:48] But I think Barry needs to figure out a way to communicate to those EA's because it was

[24:52] those people's money that is paying for everything we're seeing right now.

[24:57] And I know that in Pimball, we tend to forget this that you can't rob Peter to pay Paul

[25:01] as a business model.

[25:03] But that's exactly what he's doing.

[25:05] And I bet with the increase in cost of material cost at 12.5, he's probably not even pricing

[25:12] it high enough to do what he needs to do.

[25:16] And I think we need better communication.

[25:18] And I want to hear more people in the Pimball media asking Barry and Dutch Pimball to communicate

[25:24] to those EA's because I think they've been forgotten.

[25:27] And I think they're getting buried under the rug.

[25:30] No pun intended.

[25:31] But this needs to stop.

[25:33] And I think these EA's need to start getting their games.

[25:36] And we need to start seeing EA unboxings from Dutch Pimball.

[25:40] Otherwise he just used that as a way to turn it back on for new buyers.

[25:43] But he's still screwing over the EA's.

[25:45] And I'm not seeing enough EA's unbox games, Barry.

[25:48] Home pin over there in Taiwan.

[25:50] I don't even know what to say about home pin.

[25:52] Right?

[25:53] When we get to home pin and Pimball brothers, aren't you already exhausted by the amount

[25:57] of stuff I just talked about?

[25:59] And we've still got more companies.

[26:01] So home pin has a license game coming out.

[26:04] Is it a music pin?

[26:05] Is it something else?

[26:06] I'm not sure.

[26:07] Mike has got a really, really big mountain to climb to get people to go in on a product

[26:12] from home pin.

[26:14] Arguably Thunderbirds was a huge flop.

[26:17] Mike hasn't helped himself the way he's talked to the community.

[26:20] So we'll see what happens from them.

[26:21] But they're one of those companies that's so far off the radar for people that it doesn't

[26:26] really matter.

[26:27] And we're not going to spend much time on home pin.

[26:29] All right, pinball brothers.

[26:30] Alien machines are going out.

[26:32] The summer is over in a few weeks and they did not reveal the LV version of the game.

[26:37] So clearly they are delayed.

[26:39] They've had some part problems.

[26:41] They've been reengineering some of the parts on the game.

[26:44] For those people unboxing aliens, it looks like the pin is holding up pretty well.

[26:49] And I think people are also enjoying it.

[26:51] But this is another one where the people that got burned by Andrew Highway, they haven't

[26:56] really been made holy yet.

[26:58] The production is very slow.

[27:01] And these are the kinds of trains that I just try to avoid.

[27:04] These companies that are just, they're still around.

[27:07] They're still hanging on.

[27:09] But you don't really feel great about supporting them.

[27:12] And we're still stuck on a game from years ago.

[27:15] To me, that's the saddest thing in pinball.

[27:16] These companies that are just stuck on a game from years ago as if it's worth it.

[27:21] And alien as cool as the theme is, this game just feels dated to me.

[27:26] It looks old.

[27:27] It doesn't feel new.

[27:28] It doesn't feel exciting.

[27:30] And the storyline behind it is not exciting.

[27:33] And me, like the rest of you, I've been waiting for the LV version of the game to see it

[27:38] in the most exciting package possible.

[27:40] And I don't know.

[27:41] I don't know when we're going to see it.

[27:42] But I'm not excited about the standard version of the game at all.

[27:45] All right.

[27:46] Haggis pinball.

[27:47] It doesn't end.

[27:48] Haggis pinball.

[27:49] I want to give them credit for showing us a factory tour of how they're scaling up.

[27:52] They're already well ahead of deep root, but that's not saying much, right?

[27:56] But Haggis pinball, they are scaling up.

[27:59] They have big intentions in the pinball world.

[28:01] My only fear is that maybe they scaled up a little too big, too fast.

[28:05] And I don't know if they're going to be able to keep the line going.

[28:08] Because the thing is, when you scale up the way Haggis is scaling up, it's not just

[28:11] about making those fathoms, you now need to have the next game ready to go.

[28:16] Every day there's nothing new on the line, or the line isn't making something, is a day

[28:21] you're losing money.

[28:23] So can Haggis pinball keep manufacturing going and keep the excitement going?

[28:28] The real test for Haggis pinball.

[28:30] And let's be honest, people, Celts was a bit of a dog.

[28:32] I mean, Celts had no place in pinball in modern day.

[28:36] Like it's not even close to being on the same level of a Stern Pro.

[28:40] We don't need games that can't even get to that level of polish in every category, in art,

[28:45] in layout, in toys, in themes.

[28:47] There is nothing about it that would make you want to want one.

[28:50] And I know they sold some of them, but let's be honest.

[28:53] The real test of Haggis pinball, on whether or not I think they will have long term viability,

[28:59] is how well they can make a modern pinball machine, and can they compete with the other

[29:04] companies out there from a design standpoint, and from a manufacturing standpoint, and from

[29:09] a theme standpoint, right?

[29:11] They need to show us they can do this.

[29:12] Now they got Marty Robbins designing a game.

[29:15] Now I don't know if Marty's any good or not, we're going to find out people's expectations

[29:20] are going to be high.

[29:21] Marty's a guy that's played all the Stern machines, all the Baldy Williams machines,

[29:25] he knows pinball, and does he have what it takes?

[29:28] Now look, it's a very unique skill set.

[29:30] And just because you play a lot of pinball, doesn't mean you will be a great pinball designer.

[29:34] I don't know if Marty's good or not, we will find out.

[29:37] But that's going to be the real test of Haggis.

[29:39] Can they make a game?

[29:40] That is as good, if not better than a Stern Pro, and can they deliver on what people want?

[29:45] And remaking old stuff isn't proof that they can quite do that yet.

[29:49] I think I'm pretty much done.

[29:51] I got a couple more.

[29:53] A couple more that are just huge question marks.

[29:55] And that is this Kingpin remake by Circus Maximus.

[29:59] And I have no idea where this game is.

[30:01] And I do think that if Kingpin gets remade, I think it's going to be remade by American

[30:06] pinball.

[30:07] It makes no sense that these guys would build this thing, or if they need to find a contract

[30:11] manufacturer, obviously they would go to American pinball.

[30:15] Makes total sense.

[30:16] Like why would you take it anywhere else?

[30:18] American pinball needs themes.

[30:19] You've got to theme people want.

[30:21] So I think if Kingpin does come out, it's going to come out from them.

[30:25] Now the other part is this.

[30:26] I also think this is another company that has done a piss poor job of communicating with

[30:31] its buyers.

[30:32] And they sold translates.

[30:33] And those translates were your spot online to get Kingpin.

[30:37] And they have done nothing.

[30:39] They've not shared any information with anybody for like a year.

[30:44] And I'm sorry, gentlemen.

[30:45] But if you want to push your product into a pinball show and take people's money, at

[30:52] least have the decency every month just to give an update.

[30:56] Even if it's what you had for breakfast, talk to your buyers, talk to your customers.

[31:01] I think it is so pathetic when companies do this.

[31:05] I don't care what your intentions are.

[31:07] You took people's money, just communicate to them.

[31:11] To go radio silent for like six months at a time, really?

[31:16] Why do you even start this project?

[31:18] Why did you bring it to a show if you knew you couldn't get it made for two years?

[31:22] There's no excuses.

[31:23] There's just no excuses.

[31:25] And then we have to end this on Deeproot pinball.

[31:27] Will Ben Heck be right or will Robert Mueller be right?

[31:31] That's really what it comes down to.

[31:32] I mean, it's not looking good for Deeproot.

[31:34] Nothing about this is looking good.

[31:36] It continues to be the most exciting thread in all of pinball.

[31:39] I just don't see a way out for these guys.

[31:42] I don't.

[31:43] It's also funny to me that Barry O's food truck, I keep hearing from the people who saw it.

[31:47] They were like, that's the better game.

[31:50] And it's funny to say that now nobody wants food truck as a theme, but until they can build

[31:55] these ruses, everything else means nothing.

[31:58] Nothing.

[31:59] This thing is exhausting to think about.

[32:00] It's exhausting to talk about.

[32:02] I think Robert Mueller is another one in which he took people's money.

[32:06] He's not communicating.

[32:07] If he really has a legal issue, then he could at least tell you what it is.

[32:10] He's not telling you that.

[32:12] But none of that, none of the legal issues is stopping this man from doing a video like

[32:17] Damien did and just showing you what's going on behind the scenes at Deeproot.

[32:23] That game is five years delayed.

[32:25] It's at least three years late.

[32:27] There is nothing that stopped them in the past from opening the door and giving you some

[32:31] confidence.

[32:32] Now I think again, that's it.

[32:34] So look, a lot is happening in pinball.

[32:36] As you can see, there are way more companies than there needs to be.

[32:39] There's just too many games coming out from too many people that just don't have their

[32:43] S H I T figured out.

[32:45] The companies that will figure manufacturing out and get you products, they're going to

[32:49] be successful.

[32:51] Everyone else is going to be left holding the bag.

[32:53] It's an exciting time to be in pinball, but as you can tell by my voice, it's also an

[32:57] exhausting time because there's just too much.

[33:00] I just think there's too much pinball and not enough magic.

[33:03] I mean this.

[33:04] I'm trying off by saying this, the majority of modern pinball machines are mediocre.

[33:09] You know that.

[33:10] I know that.

[33:11] The distributors don't want you to feel that way.

[33:13] The companies don't want you to feel that way, but the majority of these games are mediocre

[33:18] compared to what we know can go into a pinball machine.

[33:21] I get excited because with every new game, I'm just hoping we get back to the magic we

[33:26] know can be put into these machines.

[33:29] And with every new game, there's that new chance, right, that we're going to be blown away.

[33:34] And I'm glad I get to hype you on these games and we better be blown away by Godzilla.

[33:38] We better be blown away by back to the future.

[33:41] What's the point of making pinball machines?

[33:43] If we can't make spectacular worlds on your glass, right, everybody?

[33:47] This has been Canadian Spinball Podcast coming at you live from Dublin, Ireland.
