[00:00] I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar

[00:06] SICKS SICKS SICKS SICKS SICKS SICKS

[00:10] No, I should write. I should write how to start a pinball podcast. You get right to it.

[00:15] You don't have 45 seconds of nonsense and...

[00:18] And hey, maybe, maybe I should spam all the Facebook today on every single pinball group that I have a new show up.

[00:25] No, I'm just gonna do what I always do. Just upload it to SoundCloud and on my own page and that's it and become the number one pinball podcast.

[00:32] But the reason why we're number one is because of shows like this. I'm gonna give you some news, rumors, and something that is actually happening in pinball.

[00:42] And then this becomes the content that every other show talks about. So welcome to Canadian pinball podcast. I'm your host, Canada.

[00:49] We're gonna jump right into it. Again, it's gonna be another not very long show because you don't need to talk for nine minutes about pinball.

[00:57] And we're gonna give you something that I don't think anyone's talking about.

[01:01] One of them is a rumor. One of them is absolutely fact because I have correspondence from the company itself.

[01:10] And then one other one I think is actually happening but is also a little bit of a rumor.

[01:15] And then I'm gonna close the show on my final thoughts on this UV kit upgrade as I've slept on it over the last 24 hours. How does that sound? Alright.

[01:26] So this is a Canadian pinball exclusive. You will only hear it on the Canadian pinball podcast. It is exclusive even though you can find it everywhere after two days.

[01:38] Welcome to my exclusive people. The first, the first bit of news. I am going to call a rumor. And this is a big one.

[01:49] This is a big one. So are you sitting down? You're listening to Canadian pinball podcast. I don't have a, you know, I don't tell you what day of the week.

[01:56] It's coming. Look, we just did two days in a row. Alright, cool. This is what I am hearing.

[02:02] That Mark Richie is designing or designed already. Mark Richie designed a licensed game for Chicago gaming company.

[02:13] And the game title that I'm hearing it might be this is so strange. It might be aliens. Okay. That Mark Richie has designed aliens for Chicago gaming company.

[02:28] As it is a game mechanics joint venture with CGC. Okay. So game mechanics and CGC have made supposedly aliens designed by Mark Richie, which means Mr. Christopher Franchie would be doing the artwork for this game.

[02:49] So let, let that rumor sink in. Get your mics out. Other podcasters and let's start doing some shows together. Alright, let's go on the next thing that this not really a rumor, but this is happening as well.

[03:01] The pin stadium is going to offer an alternative kit to the UV lighting kit that Stern wants to sell you for $280. I'll tell you why I think that is silly.

[03:15] And because Stern's kit is much more than just lighting, you need to get the other plastics as well. And if you don't buy the entire kit, you're not going to get the apron.

[03:26] You're not going to get the plastics. You're not going to get the full shabang and the full experience. So what good would it be to buy pin stadiums UV lighting kit?

[03:35] Because you're not going to get all the other stuff. No, maybe maybe Stern's going to sell this stuff in pieces. But if I were Stern, I wouldn't break up that kit as much as I hate it. I wouldn't break it up.

[03:46] So that is something else that is happening in the pinball world added to your pinball news items everyone else. Alright, what else? Okay, here we go. Ready?

[03:54] Now I'm going to read you this one. I'm going to read you this one word for word. Okay, American pinball has been taken over by Amtron. His uncle and Dan is no longer at American pinball.

[04:10] So I'm talking about Davils uncle and Dan. Okay, let me read this is a note that they sent to their employees articulating and communicating what's happened at American pinball. And I'm just going to read you this note word for word exclusively on the Canadian pinball podcast. Okay, you ready?

[04:32] It says hope you doing well. Alright, I love it. First of all, it's got it's got bad grammar right off the bat. Hope you doing well. I would like to introduce myself Mukesh Vassani founder and CEO of the Amtron group of companies.

[04:50] As you might know, American pinball is now part of Amtron. And I wanted to inform you we are getting ready to move into our new 52,000 square foot facility located at 500 South. I'm not going to say the whole address. In case some of you are mad and want to go spate spray paint it.

[05:09] We are equally excited for the upcoming introduction and release of our third pinball machine, which we believe is going to be a significant change from what you might expect from American pinball.

[05:22] Well, I'll stop right there because I do hope we see a significant change because the first two games were kind of crappy. So maybe you know, so the so are these actually going to be games that people want that they sell that people buy.

[05:37] He goes on to say we are hoping as well that you will be available to travel out for the first of our dealer events to take place this spring. All of us are extremely anxious to know more about your business.

[05:51] But most importantly, what we can do better to be your best partner. We continue to look at new ways to evolve all aspects of our operations, starting with you as our customer.

[06:04] If there has not been the frequency of communication between us as there might have been in the past, please accept my personal apologies.

[06:12] And you know that 2020 marks a new year for us and the desire and commitment to build stronger relationships.

[06:21] Welcome, I welcome the chance for us to sit down and meet depending on your schedule.

[06:27] In advance of that, might we set up a call about your needs and what more we can do to help you.

[06:33] Thank you in advance for your support of American pinball. I look forward to hearing from you since Sierra LeMue Keshe, Vassani, CEO.

[06:41] Alright, I've got his desk number. I've got his cell phone number. He also writes this, it is with deep regret I would like to inform you that the departure of Dan Selikovic from American pinball.

[06:56] We wish him success in this future endeavors. We are actively searching for his replacement. Please direct all your inquiries, sales communications to either myself or Jim Patlaw.

[07:08] We will keep you posted on the game number three updates and sales position replacement. Thank you for understanding and cooperation.

[07:17] Alright, so there you have it. There you have it. I mean, this is not the biggest surprise, but I think it goes to show.

[07:26] I think it goes to show that American pinball two date has been a colossal failure as a business. And bringing it underneath, you know, Amtron.

[07:37] What will that do? More people who don't know anything about pinball are now in charge of pinball. And someone who knew a lot about pinball, Dan is gone.

[07:49] What is the future hold for Joe Balser? Is he happy there? Is he staying there? You know, that's up in the air as well. But the whole point is this.

[07:57] And we've learned this in pinball. It doesn't matter how much money because Amtron is very successful company. It doesn't matter how much money you throw at a pinball company.

[08:10] What you really need is talent. You need talent. You need passion. You need energy. And coming off of two major, major commercial flop games for American pinball.

[08:23] It just leads me to believe that the same team was in place that made game one in two. So why do we expect game three to be significantly better?

[08:34] Now, I hope it is. I hope it is. I don't like to see this company fail. I think this game offers incredible, I mean, this company incredible bang for the buck.

[08:44] But it does scare me a little bit that a company that is failed on their first two games is already moving into a 50,000 square foot facility to make pinball machines.

[08:58] Think about that for a minute or maybe Amtron just moving into that and this is going to be part of it. But how big is spooky pinball?

[09:05] How big is Jersey Jack pinball? How big is Chicago gaming pinball in terms of square footage of their operations? And I'm sorry, but you should not be growing when you've failed.

[09:19] You should not be increasing your overhead when you've failed. You should increase your size and your scale and your operations because the demand is there for more of what you're making.

[09:34] And as of today, they have proven that there is hardly any demand. I mean, we're talking like 300 total October fest have sold 300 maybe a little bit more Houdinis.

[09:49] Games are going for basement prices now in the second hand market. So this is a big move. Now, if you were to ask me what I think American pinball needs to do is they need a hot theme game.

[10:02] Is hot wheels going to be it? I mean, if it is, if this is if game number three is hot wheels and this is the significant excitement that we're waiting for, I don't know how that theme is going to compete. But anyway, that's the news from American pinball.

[10:16] Another news item. All right, you ready for this one? And this one's more maybe a rumor. But again, this one can easily be shot down because they they're very vocal. Everyone knows people there. So I'm hearing this.

[10:29] Jersey Jack pinball is moving to Chicago all under one roof design and manufacture. Okay. So that is what I'm hearing the rumor is that Jersey Jack pinball is going to move design and manufacture into the Chicago area and out of New Jersey.

[10:51] Now, will this happen? Is it still Jersey Jack pinball if that happens? You know, I don't know if this rumors true. But I will say this that it's very expensive where Jack decided to put his company.

[11:05] It's very expensive in terms of taxes. It's very expensive for real estate. And it's extremely difficult for him to find affordable labor where he's at. So is this true? Is this happening?

[11:20] You know what I don't hear from Jersey Jack pinball? I don't hear anything about what's after toy story. So maybe that's good. Maybe that's good. But I know that like people there have like loose lips. I feel like there was something else cooking that they were excited about. I don't know.

[11:36] I heard a rumor back to the future. I heard Matrix, but I heard he couldn't get Matrix. So we will see what happens with Jersey Jack pinball. Okay. All right.

[11:47] So look, can you just pinball podcast look we're only 12 minutes in and you've heard some major major announcements. That is actual news. That is going on in the pinball world and some big rumors to discuss.

[11:59] I've now done the research for so many so many of my friends out there. Let's go on Facebook and let's let's drop this episode all over every single pinball club.

[12:10] Let's expand the pinball hobby with pinball content. That's what pinball needs. You know, we need more content equals the expansion of pinball. Come on. Come on. We're just doing this for entertainment value. Everyone knows that. This is not introducing more people into the hobby. It never will. It's meant for you guys who are the die hearts. Okay. So I just want to close this episode by saying listen to my last episode. If you want to hear my entire thoughts on the stern UV release.

[12:39] It is I think the biggest joke cast grab I've seen since I've been covering this hobby. They intended to do it all along and look at the feedback. Nobody is talking about how cool this feature is because it's super cool. It's one of the coolest things Stern has ever put in the game. The entire conversation and the entire dialogue is about the negative aspects of Stern do you know what I'm talking about.

[13:08] The effects of Stern doing it the way they did it. Now you can't tell me see marketing is not about upsetting your customer base. And again, I think Stern is once again pushing against the community in the wrong way. And it's going to backfire. It's going to even if you buy this, it's turning people off to this company. And they don't give a crap. And I think you have to. I don't think Jody and Gary give two SHITs about any of you.

[13:37] I don't. I really don't. I think the designers care about you. I think the coders care about you. I think the people actually making these games care about you. But I think the people at the top, the investors and the fat cats, they don't give two SHITs about you. And you know it. And the only way you can get to those people is if you stop buying into this crap. And you stop buying the lies they're selling you.

[14:05] And you stop throwing your money at stupid stuff like 15 KL virus and $300 or kids you should have got from the beginning. And all this stuff that is that they're not giving you anything for your money. Now what stinks is this is to get to those people to get to those jerks and those investors and make them feel it where it hurts.

[14:28] You have to hurt the people that we actually care about the George Gomez is the Keith L wins the designers the artist the coders the hard working people on the line it's done. There's all those people that mean well.

[14:41] And they are not mean spirited people. But this move is is a evil money grabbing move on Stern's part. And you if you think otherwise I don't understand your angle.

[14:54] And I'm reading on the inside people attacking the people that are outraged by this saying there's too much negativity what's wrong with people it's only this it's only that it's not about the money you fools.

[15:05] It's the principle of what this company is doing they're greedy they have 85% of the pinball market you spent $9100 on an LE that's unfinished and not only is it unfinished code wise it's unfinished because they left a feature out that they already put into the game.

[15:23] And now you have to pay to unlock it in unprecedented cash grab and people are still like defending Stern. Stop defending Stern I'll say it and I'll say it again and I'm going to end this show.

[15:36] Stern pinball has fooled all of you in so many ways they have but the saddest thing is this and you all know it you're spending so much money on a company that is making games and they're not the best pinball company.

[15:52] They never were they're just number one in volume but the best games in the world I don't know I don't know I don't think they're aiming to make the best pinball possible they just survived.

[16:09] Imagine if Valley Williams never went away if Gottlieb never went away of other companies say if everyone just stayed in it go look at modern day Sega arcade games if other companies that actually

[16:21] innovate it and pushed industries forward stayed in it Capcom I don't care if everyone from the 90s stayed in this game these are the worst these were the worst games in the 80s and 90s and now all of a sudden they have 85% of the market and you know what the past is the past we're never going to know what it would have been like if Valley Williams was still making games today.

[16:46] Okay let's just let that go because most of these Stern guys came from Valley Williams and that's why it's so frustrating because it's not like the people over there don't want to make games at the caliber of like Jersey Jack it's not like they don't have the talent they do and then some it's the investors at the top it's Gary they have these people in in straight jackets they're not going to be a good guy.

[17:15] They're in a bomb straight jacket they have these people designing to a cost not designing to a dream and it wreaks of that and these games wreak of that and they know it you get them over a few beers and that's what the designer will tell you how pissed off they are about what didn't go into the game.

[17:37] You know they yank out the ramps the cool ramps that Dennis Norman put into his game why why did they change the game to make it cheaper do you think he was designing his passion project but to make it cheaper and then you have people being like well Stern should do this to stay in business I'm telling you it's faller past the point of needing to stay in business this is not needing to stay in business they are doing so well they are now fleecing the community.

[18:07] Wake up this is a symbol of that I don't care if you think I'm being too negative I think Stern should be ashamed of this fleet and they don't care I bet if Gary and Jody were listening to this they would they would light a cigar and they would count the hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars they're making off of you they're not making it off of me because I'm not buying any stern games in the foreseeable future after this kind of stuff they're making the money off of you and I'll tell you what would hurt them.

[18:37] If the two to three thousand people who listen to this podcast didn't buy a stern game in 2020 just wait 2000 people times $8000 16 million in revenue they feel that so if you want them to feel it and you want them to change their ways then let's not keep buying everything and let's see what the other distributors out there who have shows let's see what they say about this UV kid if they think it's also disgusting.

[19:07] Or are they going to tell you to buy buy buy it because it's great and the features awesome I don't know when everyone's complaining about because you spent money on a product you should get everything that should have been in that product all right I know I'm getting a little heated again but that's how I feel that's how I feel can you to pinball podcast we're number one people we're taking the twippy three years in a row you know we are you know we are come on what who else is I mean come on I don't need I don't need 18 like shows on on a week that with a schedule and they don't we're just

[19:37] doing what we do I know you love it we'll be back soon everyone and hey hey do me a favor screw this pinball for the week go to the gym work out workout people if you're not exercising you are not living your life to the fullest okay and I mean that I care about you people more I care more about your health and your well being and don't get too stressed out over a stupid UV kid in a

[20:07] game that we all know pretty much is not that good here's that's the best part the game is not even that good everybody knows it everyone knows it except for the people who bought it who want to make apologies for it this is Brian Eddie's come back game after all these years come on I don't care what

[20:25] ink you put in it I don't care what light you shine down on it the game is a little bit of a mess and it even now feels even more like a chaotic mess like you didn't need this we got a project we got this we got this like plastic already

[20:40] choking the middle that does see you know what's amazing to me is they defeated they they've accepted defeat on the demigorgan now you don't even need to shoot it in the

[20:48] hole because it it'll register hits and kill it without even going in the mouth then what was the point of making a toy in which you were

[20:54] supposed to shoot it in the hole to kill it you now admit it that it's designed poorly and people are annoyed by it so you just use

[21:02] code to erase your your physical design failures way to go stern pinball you really knocks stranger stranger things out of the

[21:09] park this game these L. E's this game is going to be a $7,000 L. E in a year everybody knows it enjoy it while last all you

[21:17] apologize because you're the ones are going to get burned the most who run towards the fire make excuses for the heat and then all of a sudden

[21:25] you're going to wake up one day in your collection full machines has lost like 30% of its value bye bye bye people and I'm going to say bye bye bye right now but the B.

[21:34] y. e. kind later
