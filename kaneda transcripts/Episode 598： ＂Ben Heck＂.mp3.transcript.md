[00:00] They let it be known if I'm this day full,

[00:02] But I wanted to say thanks,

[00:03] Cause your haters became any strengths,

[00:05] To let them pick ranks,

[00:06] Cause I came in five nine,

[00:07] But I feel like I'm six days.

[00:08] Hey,

[00:08] It's once for you and me.

[00:10] Living out our dreams,

[00:13] Where are right where we should be?

[00:23] Alright, no intro needed,

[00:24] Canadus Bimbal podcast,

[00:26] Episode 598,

[00:30] Ben Heck,

[00:30] Let's roll it.

[00:31] Alright, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:33] I want to welcome back to this show,

[00:35] One of our most frequent guests,

[00:36] A man who has maybe seen

[00:39] One episode of Ultraman,

[00:40] Mr. Ben Heck,

[00:42] Ben, welcome.

[00:42] Yeah, I think I remember being on reruns,

[00:45] On Fox back in the 80s,

[00:46] When they didn't have anything,

[00:47] Can you remember what I was a new TV channel?

[00:49] Yeah, did you ever watch Ultraman growing up?

[00:51] I know a lot of people have been sort of wondering

[00:54] Where it was,

[00:55] And I mean, it's an old show from 66,

[00:57] What's your relationship with this theme?

[00:59] I've heard of Ultraman,

[01:00] I mean, I know what it is,

[01:02] I don't follow,

[01:03] That's not technical anime,

[01:04] That's basically a power ranger for boomers, right?

[01:07] Pretty much, yeah, pretty much.

[01:09] Yeah, I know it's a popular Japanese thing,

[01:13] There was a TV show,

[01:14] You said it went back to 66,

[01:16] I didn't realize it was that old.

[01:17] Yeah, 1966 was when it first started airing,

[01:21] Mostly in Japan, though,

[01:22] I don't think in America it was big back then,

[01:24] But I think people grew up with it in the 70s and early 80s,

[01:28] So I missed it, I never saw it on TV,

[01:30] But let's start here,

[01:31] What did you think about Spooky's

[01:34] Incredibly successful launch of Ultraman and Halloween?

[01:39] Like, what were your thoughts on that day?

[01:41] Well, I'm surprised Ultraman did that well,

[01:43] I think a lot of people are,

[01:45] Maybe not Charlie, but,

[01:47] Yeah, I mean, yes, as I mentioned,

[01:50] I knew what Ultraman was,

[01:51] I know a lot of people,

[01:53] Of course, a lot of people saw the game before it was announced,

[01:55] And a lot of the feedback was what?

[01:59] Yeah, but as far as my,

[02:02] I think it's really cool,

[02:03] Of course, now that Parker and I are vendors again,

[02:07] It's nice for us as well,

[02:09] So we had a good Wednesday as well,

[02:11] As far as that's concerned.

[02:12] Yeah, 1700 and 50 games.

[02:14] Now, let's go back to people's opinions of Ultraman,

[02:18] Was this like internal and external?

[02:20] So people were seeing this game they were playing it,

[02:22] And there was just a lot of head scratching,

[02:23] And people didn't think there'd be demand for Ultraman.

[02:26] Oh, internally?

[02:28] Yeah, it was a head scratcher.

[02:31] Again, I mean, I knew what it was,

[02:34] And I'm like, oh man, this is,

[02:36] It felt really, really niche.

[02:37] I mean, I know Charlie's a big fan of it,

[02:39] He has a lot of like,

[02:40] Ultraman, I think Charlie's,

[02:42] You know that house that Gailmo Dottaro has

[02:45] That he doesn't live in?

[02:46] That's like his horror house?

[02:48] I don't know if you've ever heard of this.

[02:49] Yeah, he basically has this house,

[02:51] And then he puts all of his accoutrements

[02:54] To use the predator word.

[02:56] Charlie's house feels like he's trying to do it like that.

[02:58] He's got like all sorts of like,

[03:00] Macabbe stuff.

[03:01] And yeah, I mean, if you go to his house,

[03:03] You'd expect him to make creature from a black lagoon

[03:05] Because my god, he must have like,

[03:07] Eight sculpts of that monster in his house.

[03:10] Wow.

[03:10] Like there's like two in one bathroom alone.

[03:12] Yeah.

[03:13] But yeah, there's also a lot of Ultraman.

[03:16] And I completely forgotten,

[03:17] Well, I didn't look at all the photos,

[03:19] But you know, when he went on his trip to Japan,

[03:21] Which apparently is the new trendy thing to do,

[03:23] Or maybe it was the trendy thing to do.

[03:25] You know what I mean?

[03:27] I know he saw like a lot of Ultraman mecha's, so to speak.

[03:31] Yeah, so obviously Charlie is incredibly well versed with it.

[03:33] Um, I, my initial thought was like,

[03:36] Wow, this is very niche.

[03:39] Yeah, but you know, apparently from what I heard,

[03:42] It was actually pretty easy to work with.

[03:44] And then I don't know if it was in a,

[03:46] In a private message or on the forum, but um, uh,

[03:49] Rare hero, you know, Greg, um, he made the comment.

[03:52] Oh, he's probably, he's probably in sense

[03:54] That I'm bringing this up on yours.

[03:55] Oh, we know.

[03:56] Are you guys friend of me?

[03:57] I can't remember.

[03:57] No, we're friends.

[03:59] Yeah, okay.

[03:59] I know you and Orc play Street Fighter, right?

[04:01] Yeah.

[04:02] But Greg says he's like, this is amazing.

[04:04] This is basically the Japanese version of Batman 66.

[04:08] And I'm like, oh, that's a good way of putting it.

[04:10] And then when I played it the other day,

[04:12] And which is actually the first time I played it,

[04:14] Well, at least with the skin.

[04:16] He's exactly right.

[04:17] That's exactly what it felt like because the music,

[04:19] the music, the tone, the sound effects, the speech,

[04:22] it's exactly what it feels like.

[04:23] So I guess if people are wondering kind of like the audio visual feel of the game,

[04:27] Right.

[04:28] That's Japanese Batman 66.

[04:30] So Ben, I have to ask you, I have to ask you,

[04:33] Because you've played these games now.

[04:35] What are they like to play?

[04:36] Because no one knows anything about gameplay.

[04:38] So I actually didn't play the finished Halloween with assets.

[04:43] I think we popped it open because we were talking about, um,

[04:46] board stuff.

[04:46] The games are very,

[04:49] Well, I've obviously can see from the photos.

[04:51] They're very mechanically dense.

[04:53] They've got like the three layers.

[04:54] Or I'm, well, is it three layers or two?

[04:56] Oh, yes, two layers of the upper play field.

[04:58] I think it, no, I think it's four layers

[05:00] with the main play field.

[05:02] So like there's three upper play fields with the fourth being the main play field.

[05:07] Yeah, and then well, so when you're playing it,

[05:09] Yeah, so there's ramps that, well, there's two ramps in particular that lead to the upper play field.

[05:15] And I don't know if they were visible from the, from the video,

[05:17] but it's pretty easy to get up to them and then you qualify things when they're,

[05:21] when you're up there.

[05:21] And then of course, depending on the games,

[05:23] I don't know exactly how the Ultraman rules work,

[05:25] but I know in Halloween,

[05:28] one of the upper play fields it represents the strowed home

[05:31] or maybe just homes in general.

[05:32] But what is it, Mike Myers?

[05:34] Mm-hmm.

[05:36] Isn't that also the guy that was like Shrek and Austin Powers?

[05:38] Yeah, there's a Michael Myers from SNL.

[05:41] Uh, yes, there's a, and then there's the horror guy with the knife.

[05:44] Uh, he's like, I'm Mike Myers, baby.

[05:47] Yeah, um, so on Halloween, those two play fields,

[05:50] one of them represents houses and one represents the insane asylum where he escapes from.

[05:56] Mm-hmm.

[05:57] Uh, yeah, that's the distinction there.

[05:58] On Ultraman, I, I obviously, the arc's all different.

[06:02] I don't know what they're supposed to represent on Ultraman.

[06:05] I, I think I probably played about 10 games of it.

[06:08] And when I was there, because actually when I went down to the other day,

[06:10] uh, I wasn't even doing code stuff.

[06:12] I just took a road trip with another guy and we just,

[06:14] you know, he just went down there to like check stuff up and,

[06:16] you know, eat the delicious pizza they have.

[06:18] Now Ben, one of the criticisms of prior spooky games is that they've been pretty,

[06:22] pretty tight, somewhat clunky.

[06:24] Um, people use the word brickfest.

[06:27] Is this a friendlier game from them?

[06:29] I would say it's definitely friendlier than Alice Cooper,

[06:32] which I think had some really tight shots.

[06:34] Uh, Cabrera Ricca Morty.

[06:35] Uh, Ricca Morty also, I think it could've been smoother.

[06:39] I hope, you know, Child is probably going to kick me in the nuts,

[06:42] but I think it could've been, I know they made some adjustments later on.

[06:46] This one definitely has a lot more depth that kind of,

[06:48] in a way it feels like white water, where, you know, it's got like,

[06:51] actually, it's very much like that where you've got like an upper plate field or play fields.

[06:54] But then you also have some depth to the left of that, you know, where the wall has further to go.

[06:58] Mm-hmm.

[06:59] And that definitely makes it, I think it makes it easier to line up your shots.

[07:02] And then I think there's some confusion as to the ball lifters or whatever,

[07:06] uh, that are on the in lanes.

[07:08] And those are basically subway returns.

[07:11] Okay.

[07:12] The shots on the left side of the game where the hedges are in in in Halloween and the buildings are.

[07:16] Yes.

[07:16] Those go into a subway and the ball can go from there to the in lanes.

[07:21] Correct. I believe the shots on the left go into the left in lane.

[07:25] Yeah, the left in lane riser.

[07:27] And then on the right hand side, uh, let's see, they've got the tombstone lock.

[07:30] There's another one over there that is a general purpose scoop and that

[07:35] feeds the right lane.

[07:36] I think something else feeds it as well.

[07:38] I remember I didn't design these games.

[07:39] I've just played them in, right.

[07:40] And yeah, I'll go down there, but usually when I'm there, it's me and Fosmo,

[07:45] just trouble shooting code.

[07:47] So we're not playing the game where basically making everything, make sure everything works.

[07:52] So I haven't had a lot of time on either.

[07:54] And then the, uh, the returns, it's a rack opinion.

[07:58] A rack opinion is there's a rack, which is a linear actuate.

[08:01] And the opinion is the gear that moves it.

[08:03] Like old school, that's how power is during use to work on cars.

[08:07] Okay.

[08:08] Yeah.

[08:08] So the ball comes down and then it's lifted up, but the ball can,

[08:11] there's like a flap, like a metal spring, still flap.

[08:14] So when the ball is lifted up from under the play field, it pushes the flap open

[08:17] and then feeds down into lane.

[08:19] And then the ball is, if you're just rolling around the play field,

[08:21] I can just roll over that flap as well.

[08:23] Do the balls lock into those shots on the left side?

[08:26] Those three different subway entrances when Mike Myers pops out, you're supposed to hit,

[08:31] right? A certain shot.

[08:32] Do they lock there?

[08:33] You know, I actually, I'm not sure.

[08:35] I know it feeds down into it, but I'm not sure how the code works.

[08:38] I think they probably do stage a ball.

[08:41] I believe they said there's something like seven different ball locks or ball stops,

[08:46] which is good for code.

[08:47] I know sometimes people are like, oh, there's too many stops.

[08:50] You know, it breaks up the flow, but it also makes it easier to code versus games where

[08:55] the ball is just constantly moving like, I don't know, walking dead.

[08:59] And there's no pop bumpers in this game, correct?

[09:02] Yeah, Al's Cooper didn't have any either.

[09:04] Interesting.

[09:05] I mean, it's pretty uncommon, like a shadow didn't have any pop bumpers.

[09:08] If I, yeah, the Brian Eddie game.

[09:11] Yep.

[09:11] You know, if I had to guess, I know sometimes people think that pop bumpers,

[09:16] they do take up a lot of space when you're designing a game.

[09:19] And they are, you know, from a gameplay standpoint, they're mostly for randomization.

[09:25] You know, like basically, everything in the pinball is meant to make you lose the ball and lose

[09:29] your money.

[09:29] Yeah, so I think sometimes people expect them, but I mean, I personally like them because

[09:33] they're very pinbally.

[09:35] Yeah, there's no pop bumpers.

[09:36] Now, the flow of the game, does it have a lot of flow or is there a lot of stop and go with

[09:40] this game because you're going into those upper playfields?

[09:42] Like, how would you sort of rate this in terms of the flowy-ness?

[09:46] Well, it's not theater magic when it comes to flow.

[09:49] It probably has more flow than people expect because most of the shots return some place,

[09:53] like they either, I think there's a left habit trail that you can return to.

[09:58] And then they also, you know, you make a shot in the ball returns either down.

[10:02] Is there a right habit trail I can't remember?

[10:04] Or it returns through the in lanes.

[10:06] So the balls moving around are a pretty good amount.

[10:09] Again, I didn't have a ton of games on it.

[10:11] Okay.

[10:12] Now, talk to me about Ultraman because you played that one with assets.

[10:15] And so it's got this campiness.

[10:17] How far along are these games?

[10:19] Is the code near complete on any of them or is there still work to be done?

[10:23] Uh, well, when would I play of Ultraman?

[10:26] Well, I back in.

[10:27] I don't know what the rules are.

[10:28] I, of course, I don't understand anything about the theme.

[10:32] Everything seemed to be there.

[10:33] I'm sure there's still going to be tweaking things.

[10:36] Are there a lot of clips from the show?

[10:37] In Ultraman, yes, there are.

[10:40] You don't recognize it, don't right?

[10:42] It's like your play.

[10:42] You're like, oh, I remember.

[10:43] I'm like, Ultraman, I believe Ultraman, he was big.

[10:47] Kind of like Godzilla.

[10:48] So it's like a, it's a guy in his suit.

[10:50] But it's basically like a giant man, I want to say.

[10:53] So he's like smash and buildings and stuff.

[10:55] It's very cheesy.

[10:57] But they have lots of the clips.

[10:58] And then they have two different voices.

[11:02] Or two main voices that I heard.

[11:04] There's like a male, main narrator.

[11:06] And then there's a female voice.

[11:08] And I believe that's the, they got actress

[11:12] who is actually Japanese or Japanese American or what have you.

[11:15] I believe they actually recorded all of her dialogue

[11:18] in both languages and you can switch it in the menu.

[11:20] So you can actually have the game be Japanese if you want.

[11:23] That's really cool.

[11:24] Yeah, yeah.

[11:25] Now Ben, I got to ask you two,

[11:27] 1700 and 50 games.

[11:29] That's a lot.

[11:30] This is a thousand more than Rick and Morty.

[11:33] Yeah.

[11:34] Is there any nervousness over there making these many?

[11:37] Like, are they ready?

[11:38] Are they good to go?

[11:39] Well, I mean, I can't really speak for them.

[11:41] They definitely, oh man, hopefully Chris

[11:45] wants to name Charlie doesn't like, like not so far.

[11:47] I'm not really saying anything proprietary.

[11:50] I kind of expected that I would go down there.

[11:52] Everyone would be like, you know,

[11:53] spraying champagne around each other and stuff.

[11:55] Like, like at the end of a football game or something.

[11:58] Not really.

[11:58] I mean, I think KT got like pizza for everyone.

[12:01] I think that was a reward.

[12:03] But no, basically, I'm not surprised that they sold out.

[12:08] I didn't think the numbers are going to be that high.

[12:10] I thought they're going for more like a thousand

[12:12] Halloween and like maybe 200 ultra man.

[12:14] So I'm kind of surprised they bumped it up that high.

[12:17] I know they are going to be at least two lines

[12:20] because they have a new building that they've added on to as well.

[12:23] Not sure the square footage on that.

[12:24] But I believe what they're doing is the new building

[12:27] is just assembly slash.

[12:30] Well, yeah, assembly and the existing building is they

[12:33] will building they've been in it for like what a year or 14 months.

[12:37] Excuse me.

[12:37] The old building is just going to be, I guess,

[12:39] production be the word.

[12:40] Okay.

[12:41] They've moved the laser in house, for instance,

[12:43] which is good.

[12:44] Now they have a welding table there.

[12:45] To my point that I was making about the champagne.

[12:48] No, when I was there, they were very much.

[12:50] I mean, we were discussing some ideas and stuff

[12:53] and some tech stuff.

[12:54] But they're basically, you know, they're like,

[12:57] okay, well, we sold them all.

[12:58] And so it's like all hands on deck

[13:00] for making sure that they can get it done.

[13:03] I know they, I think they said 18 months is their goal.

[13:06] It does seem like they're, because they actually did

[13:09] Rick and Morty ahead of schedule,

[13:10] even with the two month COVID thing.

[13:12] So I know they're being pretty aggressive,

[13:14] but at the same time, as many everyone has noticed,

[13:17] like Spooky has grown at a reasonable speed

[13:20] or a manageable speed.

[13:22] It definitely seemed like, you know,

[13:24] they weren't just like, you know,

[13:25] skipping around and like singing.

[13:27] They were like, okay, let's get this done, you know, like,

[13:29] it sounds like games are going to be going on the line

[13:31] in the next few weeks.

[13:32] So this is going to turn on real soon.

[13:34] And they're going to build both Halloween

[13:36] and Ultra Man together, right?

[13:38] You said there's two lines of assembly.

[13:40] I know that one of their goals

[13:41] with the new building is to have more than one line.

[13:44] As far as building the games concurrently,

[13:47] I would assume they're doing that,

[13:48] but I can't speak to that.

[13:49] But what do you think Ben about the

[13:51] using the same design for two themes?

[13:54] Do you think Spooky showed other manufacturers?

[13:57] Like, it worked for them, right?

[13:59] I mean, absolutely worked for them.

[14:01] I am actually kind of shocked

[14:03] that they didn't get a bunch of negative feedback for that.

[14:06] That is kind of what I expected.

[14:08] Yeah.

[14:08] People seemed okay with it,

[14:09] because I think it's because they chose

[14:11] two disparate themes, you know,

[14:13] you've got this, well, it's not even bloody at all,

[14:17] but you have a horror movie.

[14:19] And then you have something really

[14:20] campy and fun for the kids.

[14:21] And I mean, honestly, yeah, again,

[14:23] when I first heard the theme,

[14:24] I'm like, okay, you'll sell one to Rob Burke.

[14:26] I don't know who else,

[14:28] but good luck with that.

[14:29] But I was wrong.

[14:30] So as I told Lucas, I'm like,

[14:32] we're never getting here at the end of this.

[14:33] He's like, nope.

[14:34] The layout too, right,

[14:36] is very sort of accommodating, if you will,

[14:38] to both themes if you look at it, right?

[14:40] There's not like a big, less Paul guitar

[14:43] in the middle of like an ultra man game, you know?

[14:46] Well, again, I hope that I'm not speaking out of turn,

[14:49] but that game started as a different intended license.

[14:55] I won't say which, but it was something that they just

[14:58] not really their nerve fault.

[14:59] It was something that they probably weren't going to be able

[15:01] to get for a little bit, just for license reasons.

[15:04] So I believe the idea was, okay, well,

[15:07] you know, we have this.

[15:08] It's ready to go.

[15:10] The thing that's important to think,

[15:11] I don't know if this really helps the end user,

[15:13] but the game was designed by their staff.

[15:16] That's known, right?

[15:17] I assume.

[15:18] Yep.

[15:18] And it was designed in a way to be as manufacturables possible.

[15:23] So it was like the upper play field.

[15:25] I think you can remove it with two screws or something.

[15:27] Yeah, so you can build that in one assembly area

[15:30] and just throw it right on pretty simply.

[15:32] Uh, yeah, not just that.

[15:33] Like the board set that we made, the pinnatar,

[15:36] which is not, if you call it pinheck,

[15:38] Parker gets super triggered.

[15:39] Yeah, it's, you know, it's mounted under the play field.

[15:42] Again, I'm surprised more people didn't complain about that.

[15:44] Let's talk about that.

[15:45] Why is it mounted there?

[15:46] Because it also saves time.

[15:49] Okay, again, I can't speak for the whole process,

[15:52] but the existing way they make games like how they made Rick and Morty

[15:55] is they have a board assembly area,

[15:57] which is one part of the building.

[15:59] And they'll put everything onto the bottom of the board,

[16:01] but to actually fire it up and test it,

[16:03] they have to take it down into the main line

[16:04] and then put it into a cabinet.

[16:05] Uh, so even though, you know, you've got the computer in the back,

[16:08] I think the only thing in the back box of these games

[16:11] is like the little Singapore computer.

[16:13] Everything else is, yeah, there's just a little

[16:15] Singapore computer in lights.

[16:16] This is the back box is almost completely empty.

[16:18] And then you just got a USB cable going down to the, uh,

[16:21] to the pinnacle board, but an advantage with that.

[16:24] It's not necessarily the cost of the wire,

[16:26] you know, like, oh, there's more wire than a Ford focus

[16:28] or whatever, uh, Stern or Gary says.

[16:31] But it's the fact that you can mount the board to the game

[16:35] and then do basically like 99% of the wiring in one station

[16:40] because you have all of your IO preferals

[16:43] on the same plane as your lights and your switches and whatnot.

[16:48] I think which is kind of like a happy accident

[16:49] that the board fit under the play field.

[16:52] Right.

[16:52] And so as soon as Lucas saw that it would fit,

[16:54] he's like, oh, we got to do this.

[16:55] Is there a disadvantage to it having it there?

[16:57] Uh, yeah, I mean, there could be disadvantages of vibration.

[17:00] Uh, it could be a problem.

[17:02] Uh, hopefully static isn't a problem.

[17:04] Uh, it shouldn't, I mean, they've been testing it for probably about six months now

[17:08] like that.

[17:08] Uh, also, you know, if this is like the stigma about it,

[17:12] again, more like what was it?

[17:14] The old Atari up in balls like Roadrunner or Superman,

[17:17] they had the computer in the bottom of the cabinet

[17:20] and screws would fall onto it and cause short circuits.

[17:23] But obviously this would be upside down.

[17:25] And then I mean, you saw that with them.

[17:27] Stern had that node board fix where they put,

[17:30] give you a zip tie to put around a MOSFET.

[17:32] But they were using standup through whole MOSFETs

[17:35] or ours or surface mount.

[17:36] So they're not standing in the breeze.

[17:38] So they can't bend, you know, they're flat.

[17:41] Ben, when you saw the sales on in one day

[17:44] and not even a full day, like half a day,

[17:46] 1750 spoken for, do you think it's the themes like

[17:49] was Charlie like vindicated with this ultra man theme

[17:53] or is it just the market is so hot

[17:55] and games are going for so much money now

[17:57] and distributors can't even keep anything in stock?

[17:59] Do you think some of it was that as well?

[18:02] I think it's a combination.

[18:03] Uh, there is more demand than supply with these machines.

[18:08] I think also if you think about, well,

[18:10] let's just be honest, COVID,

[18:12] you have a clientele that let's also be honest

[18:15] are at least upper middle class, if not rich.

[18:18] And they they've had less things to spend their money on.

[18:22] I mean, I know that's not entirely true.

[18:24] Like, I like around here, the North Woods of Wisconsin.

[18:27] People were buying cabins, site unseen to escape the city.

[18:31] So, you know, there have been, you know,

[18:34] respites for the rich during these unprecedented times.

[18:37] But still, you know, they have the money.

[18:40] It's not like these people were losing their jobs at, uh,

[18:43] at, you know, the steel plant or something.

[18:46] And yeah, there's a lot of demand.

[18:48] And if you think about it, they're really,

[18:50] when was the last certain really?

[18:51] What do you think about the whole, the fang club

[18:53] and creating that FOMO?

[18:55] Like, without it, do you think they would have had the success

[18:58] that they had?

[18:59] Um, I think a big part of maybe not the FOMO was spooky,

[19:03] but what people like spooky is, I think, you know,

[19:06] I think they still have things they can improve on.

[19:09] You know, I think the games continue to get better.

[19:11] The art definitely has continued to get a lot better

[19:13] as you always remind us.

[19:15] Uh, but I think a big part of it is, um,

[19:18] I think people just like supporting spooky,

[19:20] because after all, the misadventures in Pimball,

[19:23] spooky was one of the few success stories.

[19:25] And they continue to be a success story.

[19:28] And I think people like that.

[19:29] Yeah.

[19:30] That's one of the reasons they support it.

[19:31] Well, and they really, with the play field issues

[19:34] that have been plaguing Jersey Jack Pimball,

[19:36] which I've talked about to no end apparently.

[19:40] Oh, yeah.

[19:40] They've nailed it, though.

[19:42] They've got the play field quality down.

[19:44] Like, what are they doing over there

[19:46] that no one else can figure out?

[19:48] Um, well, there's some proprietary things that I won't repeat.

[19:51] Uh, I don't, you know, I honestly know, yeah.

[19:54] If I have, uh, a little, a miracle is what,

[19:57] Germany here, it's somewhere in Europe, right?

[19:59] Yeah, Germany.

[20:00] I kind of wonder if there are some more regulations

[20:03] in the EU regarding solvents and whatnot

[20:05] that we don't have to deal with here.

[20:08] Maybe that's an issue.

[20:11] I just, I don't know.

[20:13] I know what spooky,

[20:15] sweetie did that thing where they don't have the, um,

[20:18] they don't have the ink or they don't, yeah, they,

[20:20] they don't print the ink under where a post might be.

[20:22] You know, they have like the wooden trap lines and whatnot.

[20:24] And Stern, Stern basically just makes things as cheap as possible.

[20:28] I mean, that's, that's their thing.

[20:30] I'm sure that's not exactly,

[20:31] I'm sure that's not the problem that Jack has.

[20:33] Jack or whoever runs a company,

[20:36] you know, they, they care more about quality.

[20:38] Uh, yeah, I don't know.

[20:39] It's spooky.

[20:41] You know, even since the beginning,

[20:42] they basically just went out of the way

[20:44] to make rigged play fields.

[20:45] I know they have like just struck

[20:47] old rigs tested up where they like throw balls around

[20:49] and test it all day.

[20:50] And I don't know.

[20:51] They've just done a really good job with it.

[20:53] I mean, I'm glad that their play fields

[20:55] have been holding up well.

[20:56] I mean, I, I know, I think TNA had a few issues

[20:59] if I recall correctly.

[21:00] And that's when they fixed the problem.

[21:01] TNA had some issues.

[21:03] That is when they, I believe they began to remove the artwork

[21:07] from around the post.

[21:08] And then they haven't had any issues.

[21:09] And the Rick and Morty has been bulletproof.

[21:12] I mean, I haven't seen anyone share

[21:14] a Rick and Morty play field with any issues.

[21:16] So there's a lot of confidence in the quality

[21:19] and then there's the goodwill.

[21:21] And then you have the FOMO, right?

[21:22] It was like a perfect storm for them.

[21:24] And it really hasn't been

[21:25] many new inbox releases this year.

[21:28] We've had Mandalorian.

[21:30] Led Zeppelin was pretty much beginning of the year.

[21:33] And then nothing from American Pimball,

[21:35] nothing from your favorite deep root.

[21:37] We'll talk a little bit about deep root

[21:39] and Nuftly Think Roses coming out.

[21:41] I did play a mandal last week.

[21:43] Yeah, what do you think of Mandalorian?

[21:44] It was a pro.

[21:46] It's all right.

[21:48] I would say it's Brian Nutty, right?

[21:50] Yep.

[21:50] It shoots better than Stranger Things.

[21:53] It's Stranger Things.

[21:54] Apparently that's like kind of like a set of resurgence

[21:57] and popularity of the Pimball, I mean.

[21:59] Yeah, the code came around.

[22:00] I think a lot of people are enjoying it.

[22:02] And I think the UV Kit adds a lot to the atmosphere.

[22:05] So I'm hearing a lot more positive stuff.

[22:09] You can't find one now.

[22:10] I mean, this is crazy.

[22:11] Like Stranger Things went from being sitting on eBay for a year.

[22:15] The LEDs were available.

[22:16] And then all of a sudden you snap your fingers

[22:19] and people think every Stern LEDs now $15,000.

[22:23] It's crazy.

[22:24] The projector works better in person

[22:28] than the photos and video really do justice.

[22:30] It's actually pretty decent.

[22:32] I think like that big billboard in the middle,

[22:35] that's kind of dumb.

[22:36] I think it would have been more interesting

[22:37] if they did like projection mapping like they do.

[22:39] And what's the thing called the haunted mansion?

[22:41] The ride, you know?

[22:42] But it's, I mean, it's a really cool concept.

[22:44] And I applaud Stern for, you know, trying that.

[22:48] Even if the game isn't really the greatest shooter.

[22:50] And the Demi-Gorgon's mouth is like those rigged

[22:54] games at the fair, you know, where they're meant to make you fail.

[22:57] It's, you know, if you do a shot at the middle,

[22:59] it should go in his mouth, no matter what.

[23:02] But it doesn't.

[23:03] Yeah, but anyway, so yeah, speaking of Brian Eddie,

[23:05] so Mando definitely I felt shot better than Stranger Things.

[23:10] I know I think I was talking about LCDs on Pinside just earlier today.

[23:14] It did seem like there was a lot of stop and go where it's like,

[23:16] oh, we paid big money for these video clips.

[23:18] So you're gonna, there's gonna be a video clip

[23:20] that's like 20 seconds long before seven happens.

[23:22] It's like, no, brother.

[23:23] Just give me the ball back.

[23:24] Right.

[23:25] That, that, that I kind of noticed.

[23:26] And I couldn't really hear it in the environment that I played it in.

[23:29] But it seemed like a solid shooter.

[23:31] Stern Games shoot great for the most part.

[23:33] I mean, they know how to make their games feel good.

[23:35] There usually is good flow in a Stern machine.

[23:38] And, you know, my whole thing with Mando is just like,

[23:41] for the subject matter,

[23:42] I just wanted there to be a little bit more innovation or something mechanically

[23:46] that wowes you on the play field.

[23:48] And it doesn't, I think there's more in Stranger Things that is actually

[23:52] like cool, just to look at, right?

[23:54] You've got the UV kit, you've got the projector, you've got the,

[23:57] she grabs the ball 11 with the magnet lock on the upper part of the,

[24:01] the play field.

[24:02] There's nothing like that in Mando.

[24:04] But you know what, Ben, the Mando people are loving it.

[24:07] I see them loving it.

[24:08] And they're gonna scream at me if I don't endorse it glowingly.

[24:12] So there you are, Mandalorian Ellie owners.

[24:14] I'm happy you're enjoying your game with no force powers in it.

[24:17] Oh, and I completely agree about in your podcast,

[24:20] we talk about how Grogu or whatever the thing is called should grab,

[24:23] you know, have the outlaying ball save like,

[24:27] gold and eye or Al's coup.

[24:28] What a bit so cool.

[24:29] Yeah, because it fits the theme and Grogu was always saving Mando's ass.

[24:33] I mean, I don't know how they missed that.

[24:35] And I heard the the magnet grab that he does is not good.

[24:39] He just keeps throwing the ball in the same place over and over.

[24:41] Like it's not fun to see that.

[24:44] Like it just why not down by the shoot again,

[24:46] have the magnet there and then have, you know, a drawing.

[24:49] It wouldn't even mean a drawing of Grogu and having his hands like reached out

[24:53] and, you know, Jedi fashion like he's forming an orb around the magnet.

[24:57] And then he grabs a magnet.

[24:58] So even if there's not a toy involved,

[25:00] he still have the thematic element of,

[25:02] oh, there's an image of Grogu.

[25:03] Oh, oh, and he's grabbing the ball, even though it's the art.

[25:06] And saving Mando, I know I completely agree that would have been.

[25:09] Yeah, not that would just make it would just made too much sense to do that.

[25:12] So let's do what we always do and one it's and it's stern.

[25:15] So technically, yeah, they made the gold and eye game

[25:19] because that was a data east or Sega.

[25:21] No, it was, well, whatever.

[25:22] It was stern, you know, back in like 95 and then movie came out.

[25:26] So they probably have the Mac somewhere in their archives.

[25:29] Well, the Mac, it's a magnet with code.

[25:31] It's not a Mac.

[25:32] So let's talk about a little because you're very active

[25:35] Ben in the deep root thread.

[25:36] It seems to be the place you go and just to have some.

[25:39] Oh, I love stirring the pot on the internet.

[25:43] So what do you think?

[25:44] Do you think it's going to happen?

[25:45] And by that, I just mean Raza shipping.

[25:47] My theory this spring was that they're going to just give up

[25:51] and they're just trying to do it as gracefully as possible.

[25:54] And they're, my thought was that we're going to offer refunds

[25:59] and then say, well, we had too many refunds to make this viable.

[26:02] So we can't go forward.

[26:03] The crazy thing is they offered refunds, but not many people took it.

[26:08] And you know, that reminds me of, well, it was a Broadway play

[26:11] in the movie, The Producers.

[26:13] They're these movie producers, the producers.

[26:15] And they go around like getting us money from like little,

[26:18] little ladies, basically con investors.

[26:20] Yeah, it sounds familiar.

[26:22] And the idea is they want this money for a movie.

[26:25] But if they make the movie and then the movie flops,

[26:29] they can hide all the money that they didn't spend.

[26:31] But only if the movie flops.

[26:33] If the movie is successful, they're screwed.

[26:36] It's kind of like a short sale on stock.

[26:38] Right.

[26:39] So then and so the move.

[26:41] Oh, yes.

[26:41] Okay, the movie that they make is called Springtime for Hitler.

[26:44] Or Springtime for Hitler and Germany.

[26:49] Winter for Poland and France.

[26:51] Yeah, yeah.

[26:52] So it's, it's, they're making a musical glorified Hitler.

[26:55] So basically it's supposed to fail.

[26:58] But then I think in the movie what happens is the movie that they make is seen as like this

[27:03] kish classic, like a rocky horror.

[27:05] And so it's successful.

[27:07] And therefore, their scam doesn't work because there's scam

[27:11] required it to be a flop.

[27:12] I mean, again, I'm not saying that was deep roots intention, but I was kind of thinking

[27:18] maybe they're like, okay, if we get a run in the bank that gives us an out.

[27:21] But yeah, maybe there wasn't a run on the bank because again,

[27:25] a redneck buys a $1 scratcher and thinks nothing of it.

[27:29] These pin people, they put down $2,000 or whatever on a deposit.

[27:33] They think nothing of it, you know, it scales.

[27:36] But it just seems like they're trying to build the ship in the ocean, right?

[27:38] I mean, you know how hard it is to make a pimpal manufacturing

[27:42] It's a good analogy.

[27:44] Does the number of cars in the parking lot equal their further along?

[27:48] Or like that's all we've got is cars and parking lots.

[27:51] I mean, I've said this on the topic many times.

[27:55] The only way, well, of course, logic doesn't seem to apply to them anyway,

[27:59] but if it was a real endeavor that was actually trying to make money,

[28:04] it only works is if they have another game ready to go after they poop out 125,

[28:10] not bad, not bad, Raza's.

[28:12] 122.

[28:13] 122 Raza's, which, well, again, theme is everything.

[28:19] But ultra man, I mean, ultra man beat it easily.

[28:23] Well, that's the thing is like, do you think when they saw

[28:25] ultra man sell that many?

[28:28] I mean, how do they not just be like, what are we doing?

[28:30] Like, what, like all this effort, all these millions, 122?

[28:34] People trust spooky, you know?

[28:36] That's a big part of it.

[28:38] And, you know, deep fruit, if they make some games and give confidence,

[28:44] of course, you know, confidence is where the term con comes from,

[28:47] because you have to give people confidence first.

[28:49] But, you know, if people have confidence that they would put their money in,

[28:54] yeah, it's, but even then, I would have thought, Raza would have sold like 300.

[29:00] I mean, it's a colorful game.

[29:02] It looks good.

[29:02] I mean, the theme is completely, I'll use this word again.

[29:06] It's not just deep fruit.

[29:08] It's the J-pop legacy of never being able to build a game

[29:12] has stuck with his reputation and this title.

[29:15] And so if Robert wanted there to be confidence,

[29:18] why won't he show production ramping up?

[29:21] I, that's a part I don't even get.

[29:22] Like, even for the people who, who gave deposits in December,

[29:26] they have not seen a single photo or video of anything happening behind the doors there.

[29:32] That's scary.

[29:33] Remember when you, way before the people,

[29:37] talked about Kevin Kool-Ack and the pile of bones on his mother's kitchen table.

[29:40] You remember that?

[29:41] Yeah, at least he had.

[29:42] He was doing it.

[29:43] Right.

[29:44] But even though it was a stupid pile of bones on his mother's kitchen table,

[29:48] he did that to build confidence.

[29:50] Yep.

[29:51] And, and deep fruit's not even doing that.

[29:53] But, if you think about it from a legal standpoint,

[29:56] because remember, Robert's a lawyer and when your only tool is a hammer,

[30:00] every problem is a nail, something else you consider.

[30:02] And this is also what formulated my theory.

[30:05] If he did release photos to build confidence and then didn't make anything,

[30:10] that might make him legally liable,

[30:13] like culpable for building confidence when, you know, there was no hope.

[30:19] Maybe that's why he hasn't done it.

[30:20] I mean, remember, he is a lawyer and he probably doesn't,

[30:24] I mean, because, thing is, and he could talk a big game and threaten people,

[30:28] but he has taken a lot of money from investors.

[30:31] And I mean, who cares what someone's best at Pinside,

[30:35] but he got the SEC out there?

[30:36] They took a lot of government payroll money.

[30:39] They were taking PPP loads.

[30:41] This April, not last April.

[30:44] Yeah.

[30:44] This April, in a state that was only closed for one month,

[30:49] that is, that is not good.

[30:53] You know, like, you know, I could see if it was like California or one of these

[30:57] state or like where you live.

[31:00] But yeah, and that's pretty fishy.

[31:02] But I guess my point is, yes, maybe the reason they haven't shown any photos of confidence

[31:06] is because they don't want to build false confidence because they've already figured out

[31:10] what their exes strategy is, but they were supposed to be an update, but there hasn't been

[31:13] a one, right?

[31:14] Yeah, the latest is maybe July 18th or 19th.

[31:18] Now, but they did go on podcasts in December back when the order banks were opening up,

[31:23] and they were telling people games would ship in six to eight weeks from those podcasts.

[31:30] And I mean, here we are six to eight months later, and no games.

[31:35] So, but there's no new orders that they'll take on Raza, which is another reason why Ben,

[31:40] like, I don't think it even matters, right?

[31:42] What do you think their game is or their strategy is?

[31:45] I just think now it's a pride thing, and the money is almost like irrelevant,

[31:50] because if they were to actually charge for each Raza, what has gone into deep root pinball

[31:57] and tech and studios, I think each game would be like $300,000.

[32:01] So, like, you do the numbers.

[32:05] Yeah, and even if you didn't armitize the total cost production,

[32:10] whatever they're spending to build it, I'm sure as well beyond what they charge.

[32:14] Right.

[32:15] Look at these beautiful studio work that they did for Foodtruck.

[32:19] Those animations are phenomenal for a pinball game, right?

[32:23] I mean, this is an industry that just had dots.

[32:26] But now it's like, where does it go?

[32:29] Where's the game to put that into?

[32:31] And if Foodtruck is your next title, we can't forget that Andrew Highway had alien

[32:38] to keep people going.

[32:39] He knew he had a blockbuster theme.

[32:41] I've never seen a company need sales so much like Deeproot,

[32:45] but how do you get it with Foodtruck?

[32:47] This isn't Mandalorian, right?

[32:49] This is not like it take my money now theme.

[32:52] And I'm just curious what they're going to say this month,

[32:56] because if it's another delay, I don't know.

[33:00] I don't know if you see games before December.

[33:04] I mean, it's hard to say, right?

[33:06] Because something else to think about rich people, rich people,

[33:10] don't want to be in cash right now with inflation we have going on.

[33:13] So they probably would rather have $2,000 in a mythical raza than in the bank, you know,

[33:21] because they don't care about the game.

[33:23] They just want this rare thing that they can put in their base,

[33:26] but like, oh, look, I have one of 222 games.

[33:29] And unlike America's most haunted, it's really good looking,

[33:32] even though I'm caring to you.

[33:33] It sounds good as a game.

[33:35] I think that's a big part of it.

[33:37] So, you know what I'm saying?

[33:38] Like, these rich people, they don't want to be in cash right now.

[33:41] They're not dumb.

[33:42] Well, and that's been the gamble with raza has been,

[33:46] if it does come out, there's this sort of grail item.

[33:50] They will talk themselves into feeling.

[33:52] And, you know, but you got to go down the road further than that.

[33:56] And you got to go down the road of,

[33:58] am I going to get support?

[33:59] There's a lot of rare video games that are crap.

[34:01] Like, people don't buy them because they're good.

[34:04] They buy them because they're rare.

[34:06] Little Samson, maybe, is the exception.

[34:07] Oh, yeah, just one more thing before I talk about the parts

[34:11] as I brought up earlier was, um,

[34:13] so to make it a going endeavor, okay, we're only going to make 122 raza.

[34:16] Okay, maybe that's how you get your line spooled up, right?

[34:19] Like, oh, we're going to do this.

[34:21] But then, you have to have a game ready to go immediately afterwards,

[34:24] especially now with this worker shortage,

[34:27] which totally is a real thing.

[34:29] It's not a myth.

[34:30] Like, you have to keep the line going.

[34:32] Because if you lose the people,

[34:34] you have to re-hiren retrain, which is one thing that's

[34:38] screwed Jack a couple years ago.

[34:40] Right? So they have to have a game.

[34:41] Okay, maybe raza is a joke.

[34:43] The sales are pathetic,

[34:45] but they have to have something ready to go after that.

[34:47] And it's not going to be food truck.

[34:48] They are, they're, food truck,

[34:50] if it was lucky, it would do like October Fest numbers.

[34:53] Nobody gives a crap.

[34:54] And I've said this about American Pimball many times,

[34:56] when I guess I'll reiterate it here.

[34:58] American Pimball, because I know you bought them

[35:00] a few minutes ago as well.

[35:01] They don't understand themes.

[35:03] They don't understand wish fulfillment.

[35:05] They don't understand desirability or mythicism.

[35:10] You play something like you want to be,

[35:12] well, maybe you don't want to be as fat as the Axel Rose,

[35:14] but you want to be as famous as the Axel Rose.

[35:16] Or you want to be a night demon slayer,

[35:18] or you want to be Rick or Morty.

[35:20] You know, you want to have a fantasy, right?

[35:22] But you have something like October Fest.

[35:25] What's the fantasy?

[35:26] Like, I can go get drunk in October.

[35:29] There's no wish fulfillment there.

[35:31] Like, if I want to go get drunk,

[35:32] I can have more fun doing that.

[35:33] I can eat drunk than playing in Pimball.

[35:34] Hot Wheels.

[35:35] Hot Wheels is for like eight-year-old boys

[35:37] who dream of having their driver's license.

[35:39] They're selling these cars to guys who have, you know,

[35:43] they have what's your thing, a Dodge demon, right?

[35:45] Like, there's no wish being fulfilled

[35:47] in the same thing with food truck.

[35:48] Oh, boy, I sure wish I could work in a sweaty food truck.

[35:51] Right.

[35:52] What's the, you know, what I'm saying?

[35:53] What's the fantasy?

[35:54] What's the wish fulfillment?

[35:55] Well, and the problem with hot wheels

[35:57] is the actual Hot Wheels toys

[35:59] that cost 20 or 30 bucks

[36:00] are more fun in a Pimball machine.

[36:04] I mean, I want to say that we'll do a loop-to-loop

[36:06] and jump and I want to take it through the car wash.

[36:08] I can't do any of that in the Pimball machine

[36:11] that costs thousands of dollars.

[36:13] Great job, AP.

[36:14] Yeah, they could have had two cars, same car,

[36:17] but ones like, you know, distressed,

[36:19] whatever the movie term is.

[36:20] It goes into the car wash,

[36:22] and then they like sequence out the clean car.

[36:24] Like, that would have been cool, right?

[36:26] I would have been amazing.

[36:26] Everybody would have been a great moment of that game.

[36:29] Oh, yes.

[36:30] Nope.

[36:30] That's what we want, people.

[36:31] That's what we want.

[36:32] We want moments in Pimball.

[36:34] Right.

[36:35] It's the main thing.

[36:36] It's the main thing.

[36:37] So, okay, so Deep RootRaza will see AP.

[36:39] Do you think they're going to get a game out?

[36:41] And if they do, they keep saying it's going to be a game

[36:44] from a junior designer.

[36:45] So it's probably going to be

[36:47] one of these unlicensed themes, like legends of Vahala.

[36:51] Oh, it's legends of Vahala, isn't it?

[36:53] That's what I heard.

[36:54] Yeah, well, that's what I've been saying.

[36:55] So you might have heard it for me, but...

[36:57] Oh, but get this.

[36:58] This is what I heard.

[36:59] It's legends of Vahala, but they've renamed it to

[37:03] Rampage, colon, something Vikings.

[37:06] Wait, is that what you heard?

[37:08] Yes, what have you heard?

[37:09] So, but you actually heard that they're

[37:11] renaming it, like, Viking Rampage or something like that?

[37:14] I heard it's Rampage, and I'm like, oh,

[37:17] because you've heard me say that Rampage

[37:18] would be a really cool Pimball machine.

[37:20] But it's not Rampage, like the video game Rampage.

[37:22] It's still Viking themed.

[37:23] It's like a Viking game, and then it's called

[37:25] Rampage or Rampage Quest for Vahala or something.

[37:29] Ah, so that's probably why Michael Grant

[37:32] told me to take down my post because it's not

[37:37] technically legends of Vahala.

[37:39] It is Rampage something interesting.

[37:43] So he's...

[37:44] Yeah, you're connecting some dots.

[37:46] So look, AP, we just spoiled your plans.

[37:49] Can you just send ball podcasts and Ben Heck?

[37:50] Always, always bringing you new information.

[37:54] It's a ruin the day.

[37:55] Well, it's like one of those movies where we take

[37:57] we take the sift dagger and we plug it into like the Holocaust

[38:00] or whatever Harry Potter had, and then we figure out the thing.

[38:04] But think is nothing to get Scott,

[38:07] but people don't want unlicensed themes.

[38:10] Yeah, and they're still saying they're going to do that.

[38:13] Like, half of our games are going to be unlicensed,

[38:15] and it's like, why?

[38:17] I think what happens is they look back to the 90s and volumes,

[38:20] and they had this romanticism about

[38:22] the unlicensed themes that were successful, even though by time you got to like 1995,

[38:26] they're great games, but they weren't nearly as successful as the games from the early 90s.

[38:31] And yes, it is because of the part of the decline of our Cades, but

[38:35] all like the 10-K sellers from the early 90s, it was Terminator 2.

[38:38] It was Star Trek Next Gen.

[38:40] It was, uh, it was other one, Twilight Zone.

[38:42] All licensed games.

[38:43] How do you think, uh, Cactus Canyon remake does?

[38:47] Oh, I...

[38:49] I have no idea.

[38:50] I just hope they get it out soon because that makes my game sooner.

[38:56] Yeah, I guess here's a question.

[38:58] Like, what are the new and with the code?

[39:00] I have no idea.

[39:01] They know they've completely revamped the code.

[39:04] Cactus Canyon is a very mechanically satisfying game.

[39:07] You know, it has like those quick draw things,

[39:08] which they kind of borrowed in the Stirn Jurassic Park.

[39:12] It's got that mechanical cowboy you can hit.

[39:14] It's got like the mine car.

[39:16] With better rules applied, I think it could be a pretty cool game,

[39:19] because there's a lot of physical satisfaction on the play field.

[39:22] And it's going to have the most amazing topper they've ever done to date,

[39:25] which we all know the topper is the most important part of a pinball game these days.

[39:29] Hey, CGC's toppers are pretty badass.

[39:31] They're great.

[39:32] You know, it's crazy the Ben is like, I collect some anime statues,

[39:35] and if you look at the world of sculpting and molding,

[39:39] and it's so silly what people spend $1,000 on, $2,000 on for these toppers,

[39:45] go look at any of these intricate statues that, you know,

[39:48] anime fans collect, and they're like a couple hundred bucks,

[39:51] and they would be the greatest pinball toppers of all time.

[39:54] It's, but it's amazing how we have time.

[39:56] No, no, you're completely right.

[39:58] The economy's the scale is completely different,

[40:00] and you're not wrong.

[40:02] Yeah, like spooky throws it in for free,

[40:04] but you know, some of these toppers,

[40:05] you look at these games and it's like flat piece of plastic,

[40:09] 200 bucks, 300 bucks.

[40:10] I think they were talking about the Halloween topper,

[40:13] and I don't know if it was,

[40:15] I think I might have been KT that suggested that,

[40:18] and I'm like, oh yeah, you just gotta have a,

[40:19] have a slit in the top of the playfield,

[40:22] so the knife, like stab it,

[40:24] oh I'm sorry, I have a slit in top of the back box,

[40:26] so the knife can stab into it,

[40:27] because good, there's nothing in the back box.

[40:30] Yeah, it's very cool.

[40:31] You know, well, maybe I'm biased,

[40:33] because I have an older house with, you know, low,

[40:36] you know, my ceilings in my basement are only like seven feet tall,

[40:39] but I don't, I don't understand what people love toppers,

[40:42] but whatever, teach their own.

[40:44] Now Ben, your theme is licensed,

[40:46] and are you working, and you're getting all the assets you want

[40:50] for your theme?

[40:51] We haven't really gotten to that point yet.

[40:53] It's in the engineering stages right now.

[40:55] Yeah, Pete Prachowski, who worked on champion pub,

[41:00] is the mechanical engineer, and also working on the playfield.

[41:03] He's doing a fantastic job,

[41:05] and really excited for people to see it.

[41:07] Well, all I'll say is that when you talk about games where

[41:10] there's not enough magic on the playfield,

[41:12] this one has all the magic on the playfield, so.

[41:15] All right, now we're excited.

[41:16] When next year or the year after next?

[41:20] I have no idea.

[41:21] It's probably a ways off.

[41:23] Can spooky make it if CGC's just drag in their feet?

[41:26] Doug's already invested a lot in what Pete has done,

[41:30] so I'm pretty sure it's still going to be a CGC game.

[41:33] I mean, again, I shouldn't really speak to that.

[41:36] I mean, it's okay.

[41:36] Like, I have other stuff I can do.

[41:40] I mean, really, for me, I just have to wait to get to Whitewood,

[41:43] so I can program it and put assets in and whatnot.

[41:45] How far are you from that?

[41:48] I'm pretty sure right now that I've got all hands on deck.

[41:51] Well, obviously it's Cactus Canyon.

[41:53] I don't think that's a secret.

[41:55] So I really don't know.

[41:57] It's, Pimboa is a very long-drawn-up process.

[42:00] However, now that we got our boards back in the spooky,

[42:04] I'm fine to just take that money.

[42:05] You know, I'm not that greedy of a person,

[42:08] so I'm fine-weighting.

[42:09] I got a lot of things I can do.

[42:11] It will be a really mechanically satisfying game.

[42:14] There's one mechanism that has never been seen before,

[42:18] and it's one of those things.

[42:19] As soon as people see it, they will probably copy it,

[42:22] so it's like fingers crossed.

[42:23] Nobody else does it first.

[42:24] What did you pat in it?

[42:25] Did you do the old J-pop and file a pat in it?

[42:28] That was not my place to do that, but we'll see.

[42:32] All right.

[42:33] Well, we're excited for those new listeners

[42:35] to Cactus Bimboa podcast after almost 600 episodes.

[42:38] Ben is working on a game with Chicago Gaming Company

[42:41] in conjunction with spooky, right?

[42:43] So there's some overlap.

[42:45] Yes, there is some.

[42:46] Yeah, so we will say, and it is a license theme,

[42:50] and it is a rebranding of the game I was working on at spooky

[42:54] about four years ago, so it has...

[42:56] Yeah, can I ask you, is Mr. Franchi doing the art?

[43:00] I don't know.

[43:01] I think at one time they were thinking that he would.

[43:03] I actually don't...

[43:06] I can't tell you at this time.

[43:08] I mean, I'd be happy to work with him.

[43:10] I certainly have an idea of what kind of style I think the art should be in,

[43:15] which I hope someone more talented than myself will work on,

[43:18] unlike American's Most Honored, as he always like to bring up.

[43:21] Nobody wants you to touch the art, Ben.

[43:23] Not even you.

[43:23] Not even you.

[43:24] You know what?

[43:26] You know what?

[43:26] I would love to commission someone to read you the play field on American's Most Honored,

[43:30] just to spite you.

[43:31] Good.

[43:32] I'll do it.

[43:33] I could do a better job.

[43:34] I literally could do a better job.

[43:36] You can even think Pisa Wood and a Sharpie marker and it'll come out better.

[43:43] Oh man, that would be so cool if we did like American's Most Honored with the new art package.

[43:46] Yeah, the Canadian Collector's Edition.

[43:48] One and one.

[43:50] I bet it would sell, but we said 150 unfortunately.

[43:53] Yeah, now it's fine, but maybe one day we'll do it.

[43:56] He didn't have...

[43:57] Well, I shouldn't say we because I did, but Spooky didn't have any money back then.

[44:03] We had no money.

[44:05] So we could tell by looking at the game.

[44:08] No, no, no, no, I know, but hear me out, hear me out.

[44:12] Your typical art package, I don't know, say it's like 20k.

[44:15] Yeah, around there.

[44:16] 50% of the budget would have been just the art.

[44:19] Based off what Spooky started up funding, which was Charlie's life savings, right?

[44:25] So you're talking like, I mean, that's like what Deeproot would do.

[44:27] You spend half your money on art and we didn't do that.

[44:30] And all sorts of games later, he imagined if Deeproot had actually

[44:35] absorbed Spooky back in the day, like...

[44:38] Yeah, so you told this before, but Robert tried to acquire Spooky Pimball.

[44:42] And what did he say he thought the J-Pop games would sell how many units?

[44:46] Oh, I'm not quite ready to tell that whole story.

[44:49] I'm gonna wait until they're dead and buried before I tell that story, which I will.

[44:53] Tell it here, please, please tell it on Canadian Spimball Pimball Pimball.

[44:56] I'll just briefly say, if Robert sold the investors on those levels of projections

[45:05] and then sold 122 units, he should be...

[45:10] I would be worried about you and I'm saying...

[45:13] Right.

[45:16] Someone shared with me once too.

[45:18] I'm trying to find the file, but they got asked to look at the projections for P3 multi-morphic.

[45:25] And it was another one of these like pretty high numbers.

[45:27] And I'm like, oh, and they're nowhere near these sales.

[45:31] How did Jerry take the news when you switched over to your board?

[45:34] I know he was providing the P-Rock boards for the Spooky games.

[45:37] I'm sure he hates my guts.

[45:40] I love the honesty of Mr. Ben Heck.

[45:42] No, that's all right.

[45:43] I don't mind having an art stem, it's kind of fun.

[45:46] You've outboarded him.

[45:47] How does it feel?

[45:49] Hey, you know, I'm 45 years old.

[45:51] I think about the old computers and like, what really made them successful like the Commodore,

[45:55] and it was being cheap.

[45:57] So your board is more cost effective, I take it.

[46:00] I believe so.

[46:01] I mean, I can't speak to the exact numbers, but that was one of our mean...

[46:05] Well, no, that was our main goal.

[46:08] And hey, now that we have a world of park shortages,

[46:12] a pinball system that runs off a single microcontroller is a boon because you only have to buy one

[46:18] microcontroller instead of five.

[46:20] And you've designed these, this is four pinball, right?

[46:22] I mean, and it does everything a pinball machine needs to do.

[46:25] There's no limitations with your board.

[46:28] Yeah, well, I mean, you'd run out of switches eventually,

[46:31] but you could also use it for redemption games.

[46:33] And we're also talking about making a miniature version of it called the Minitar,

[46:36] which would have approximately one-third of the capabilities and obviously a lower price.

[46:40] That could be used to drive a simpler pinball machine,

[46:43] or perhaps a simple redemption game,

[46:44] or if you need more functionality than what the pinitar has,

[46:49] you can buy a Minitar and put both of them in the same game,

[46:52] although hopefully that wouldn't come to that because then that makes the price go up.

[46:56] But...

[46:56] Well, very cool, Ben.

[46:57] I always appreciate you taking the time, or I think we're just a little bit out our hour mark.

[47:02] So anything else on your mind in the world of pinball that you want to let our listeners know about?

[47:07] Well, I mean, it's cool to see the evolution of spooky.

[47:11] I know a lot of people sometimes they just think I'm some sort of blowhard on the internet.

[47:17] Well, I am, but I'm more than that.

[47:19] I mean, I was there at the very beginning.

[47:21] It's quite interesting to see how it's grown.

[47:25] I remember Charlie originally was going to start a pinball company.

[47:28] I thought he was crazy.

[47:29] It is a crazy idea.

[47:30] But if I could go back in time, I would have been like,

[47:33] okay, I'll match your startup funds.

[47:36] That would have been a good investment.

[47:38] Of course, if I could go back in time, I'd tell myself to buy games stop.

[47:42] I would also tell, I'd be like,

[47:46] no, think about.

[47:47] It's like, you or I could go back in time and tell us,

[47:50] we could go back in time to December and say, hey, drop 50k into GameStop.

[47:55] Come back to March and we'd be like multi-millionaires.

[48:00] But the reason why people love spooky right is there's no shortcuts in life.

[48:04] That's why like GameStop and Dogecoin and Bitcoin.

[48:07] Yes, absolutely.

[48:09] We always we took those shortcuts.

[48:11] But the truth is to wake up every day and feel fulfilled,

[48:14] you need to make something you're proud of.

[48:17] And you can't rely on a lottery ticket stock pick.

[48:20] And look, would I love to have done that?

[48:23] Sure.

[48:25] But there's a reason why most lottery winners die broke because they didn't earn it.

[48:30] Well, lottery winners are one new in the lottery.

[48:33] That's the dumb red neck.

[48:35] I don't want to do anything.

[48:36] Path of success.

[48:39] The thing is actually taking a risk, risking your own money, your own time,

[48:44] your family's, you know, well-being, that's a risk.

[48:48] And a lot of people aren't comfortable doing it and Charlie did it.

[48:51] He took a massive risk and you know, that's capitalism.

[48:55] You take a massive risk, you can get screwed or I could pay off massively.

[49:00] I think one of the things, you know, maybe to close,

[49:02] is one of the things that people like about spooky,

[49:05] maybe almost on a subconscious level.

[49:07] And it isn't a way.

[49:08] It's the American dream.

[49:09] Like, you've got this guy who's a very normal guy.

[49:12] He's not like, oh, I don't know, a rich investment lawyer, for instance.

[49:17] He's just this guy who's got like a blue collar job.

[49:20] And he lives in this town.

[49:21] He's got like, you know, two kids, you know,

[49:23] 2.5 kids in a dog, you know, a little house.

[49:26] And he's like, you know what?

[49:27] I'm going to start a company.

[49:29] And through the sweat of his brow, he makes it work.

[49:32] And it's, I think that's what attracts people is because, you know,

[49:37] you're not just investing in a, in a, in a game,

[49:39] you're investing in the idea of the American dream.

[49:42] And that's really what that is.

[49:43] And that's attracted to people because, you know,

[49:47] it's someone who starts from, you know, more or less nothing.

[49:51] And they accomplished that.

[49:52] So people like rewarding that because deep down, even if we don't,

[49:55] well, of course, most of these people are rich.

[49:57] But deep down, we like to reward that because it reinforces our idea of what,

[50:02] you know, the American dreams should be.

[50:03] Look, and I'm going to say most of the people buying these games who are wealthy,

[50:08] they probably had the same journey.

[50:10] I mean, there might be some people who inherited the money,

[50:12] but they respect that.

[50:14] And, and it shows.

[50:15] Well, let's be honest, this isn't CNN.

[50:18] We know that a lot of rich people didn't, you know, they,

[50:22] you know, I could have sold books online when I was 22 and ended up like Jeff Bezos,

[50:27] but I wasn't.

[50:27] I was too busy screwing around, right?

[50:30] Yeah, it's, you're right.

[50:32] Yeah, you're exactly right.

[50:33] Like people like, hey, that was me 20 years ago.

[50:36] I'm going to support in a way me.

[50:39] Yeah, yeah, no, it's, and you know what the other part too is,

[50:42] they're very transparent.

[50:43] They're part of the community.

[50:44] I mean, I love seeing them on, they're like the only Bimbal company that's actually in their own thread

[50:50] connecting with their customers.

[50:52] Wow, there's a novel idea.

[50:54] Yeah, well, it's because, you know, they have a, you know,

[50:57] pretty good reputation.

[50:58] So they, they know they're not going to just get flamed the whole time.

[51:01] But you could tell them, like, I think Rick and Morty shoots like crap and they're not going to

[51:05] like deactivate their account.

[51:06] They'll take it.

[51:08] No, no, no, just like, okay, well, or they'll, you know,

[51:11] they'll make sure the next game, you know, shoots even better.

[51:14] And I try to do that too.

[51:15] Like, you know, I'll go on pin sign, I'll rail people up and I'll like,

[51:18] but you know, it's like, well, that's Ben, you know, it's, it's just honesty.

[51:22] And so I think people appreciate that, like with spooky or, or whoever.

[51:26] It's like, you know, it's accessibility.

[51:28] I love a good honest role, especially when his name is Ben Heckendorn.

[51:32] Ben, thank you so much for taking the time.

[51:34] Always appreciate it.

[51:36] And I look forward to having more stories from you come onto the airwaves and,

[51:41] and give this, this little meager podcast during New York City of Fifth Twippy.

[51:45] It could happen.

[51:46] Five in a row.

[51:48] There it is.

[51:48] Five and five.

[51:50] Five, you and four in a row, you might as well keep going, right?

[51:52] You're like, Merrill Streep.

[51:53] It's never been done before.

[51:54] We're an uncharted territory.

[51:56] You know, we're going to start throwing around the word dynasty.

[52:00] All right, my friend.

[52:01] Have a great night and thank you so much for coming on.

[52:03] What problem?

[52:25] Is the sky full of lighters?
