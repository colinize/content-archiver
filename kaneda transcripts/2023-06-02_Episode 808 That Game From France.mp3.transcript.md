[00:00] No, I don't regret anything.

[00:05] Neither the good we did, nor the bad. Everything is good and bad.

[00:30] I know, when that $5 bill comes at the end of the month, it entices some people to leave the show.

[00:36] We have dipped a little bit below 600 subscribers, but we're going to get them back by the end of June.

[00:43] We're going to talk on this episode. We're going to talk about the French pinball company, Hexa Pinball,

[00:48] trying to sell us a pinball machine that's either between what, like $9000 or $119, almost $12000 for this freakin space hunt game?

[00:59] Let's talk about that. No one really cares about it. We'll talk about how the fact when I went on pinside,

[01:05] I could barely find a freaking thread about it. There was only like four comments about this game.

[01:11] Let's talk about Stern Pinball and this Godzilla topper. As much as we complained about it,

[01:16] as much as it is a travesty to our wallets that they charge $1000 for this damn thing,

[01:23] they sold out of a thousand of them in one freakin day.

[01:28] A million dollars in Stern Pinball's pocket in one day for some flat plastic and some zip ties.

[01:35] I mean, we keep sending a message to Stern Pinball. If you think we're suckers, you ain't seen anything yet, Stern.

[01:42] I mean, come on, remove the damn Godzilla from the damn thing and we'll spend even more money on the damn topper.

[01:49] We're going to talk about what that means for the future of pinball pricing.

[01:53] We're going to talk a little bit about what's going on around the horn in the pinball world.

[01:58] And then we'll do another episode of Canada's Collector's Corner. We'll pull up some games for sale.

[02:04] We'll talk about whether or not we think the price is right and whether or not this is the kind of game I would collect if I were a pinball collector.

[02:13] Alright, let's start with this Hexa Pinball game Space Hunt.

[02:17] Came out of nowhere and it's also going nowhere.

[02:21] This game, as we all know, is like a galactic tank force with no tank in it.

[02:27] I was reading the storyline, you're in outer space, you got to save your sort of citizens from attack.

[02:35] Who cares about any of this?

[02:37] Why would you even go the effort to make a pinball machine that costs more money than a Stern Pro and almost as much money as a Stern Premium?

[02:49] Why would you go through the effort to make a game that is based on a theme nobody wants?

[02:56] It has done nothing special in pinball.

[02:59] This is as pedestrian as it gets.

[03:03] And look, we all know that this thing is going to be dead on arrival.

[03:07] They're not even going to sell a hundred of these things.

[03:10] They might not even sell fifty at this price.

[03:13] And I wish any company that's thinking of making pinball would wake up.

[03:17] There are now freaking fourteen pinball companies.

[03:20] We weren't even counting Hexa Pinball from France in our list of pinball companies that are trying to make games in modern times.

[03:29] And I think we're almost at like fifteen companies.

[03:32] And if you're going to throw your hat in the ring, the only way you'll be successful, you need to be able to compete on some level within the marketplace.

[03:42] So if you're not going to be able to compete on theme, you got to be able to compete on price.

[03:48] And if you're not going to be able to compete on price, you better put everything and the kitchen sink into the game.

[03:55] If you're going to go an original theme or a public domain kind of route in the pinball world, then you need to come out with a game that looks as amazing as John Papa Duke's Alice in Wonderland.

[04:09] And that was Zambietti that made that game look amazing or something like the old Raza or Magic Girl.

[04:15] But if you're going to go off and make your own game, call it Space Hunt.

[04:19] Have artwork that is really bad compared to what's in pinball today.

[04:24] Have no special mechanisms.

[04:26] Have no special code.

[04:28] Have absolutely no reason why or any compelling reason why anybody should spend this much money on your game.

[04:36] Why would you even go through the effort?

[04:39] You know, and I don't know how many people are over at this company.

[04:42] I don't know what their manufacturing looks like.

[04:45] Space Hunt might give Pony Factory a run for the money.

[04:49] I mean, who's buying these games?

[04:51] Is the crack good over there in France?

[04:53] Like how many drugs do you need to do to wake up one day and say, hey, let's get into the pinball space.

[05:00] Let's make a game called Space Hunt.

[05:02] Let's have a mechanism that basically looks like a green tampon just hanging down from the game itself.

[05:08] And let's just see who wants this game.

[05:11] I don't get it, people. I don't get it.

[05:13] And I have some people that buy almost every single game, but I don't know anyone who's going to go in on this game.

[05:19] And based on the excitement on pinside, nobody's buying this game.

[05:23] All right, so we'll move on from them to the company that sells the most games in all of pinball.

[05:28] Let's talk about Stern Pinball quickly.

[05:30] Okay, so we've got this Godzilla topper.

[05:33] They sold a thousand in one day.

[05:36] I'm not surprised they probably have at this point somewhere in the ballpark of five to six thousand

[05:43] Godzilla's are out there in the wild.

[05:46] And all you need are a thousand Joe bodies out there that will buy anything that's an accessory for a game they love.

[05:54] They will justify it at any cost.

[05:56] It doesn't matter how many zip ties are on the damn thing.

[06:00] Now look, this thing's not worth a thousand dollars.

[06:02] It's not even about the price.

[06:04] It's just about the principal with Stern Pinball.

[06:06] And excuse me if you hear some of the honking in the background.

[06:09] This is the downside of doing the podcast in my apartment.

[06:12] I'm on the third floor.

[06:14] I'm not in my office, which is quiet and I'm on a street that's really busy.

[06:19] So look, Stern sold them and now they're going to do runs two and three of the Godzilla topper.

[06:25] Now, do you think they sold a thousand to customers or our distributors gobbling these things up?

[06:31] Because if history has shown us anything as much as we're making fun of this topper right now,

[06:37] imagine if they stop making this topper one day, but they keep making Godzilla pinball machines for the next five years.

[06:45] What's going to happen?

[06:46] Are people going to want this topper three years from now?

[06:49] And then all of a sudden there's only like fifteen hundred of them and people are going to start offering freaking three thousand dollars for this topper.

[06:57] And that's what toppers have become.

[06:59] It's not even about what's up there.

[07:01] It's not about the creativity that went into it.

[07:04] It's not even about the price Stern is charging.

[07:07] It's simply this.

[07:08] Toppers are meant for collectors, right?

[07:11] Why would a pinball player want a topper, right?

[07:13] It has nothing to do with gameplay.

[07:15] The modes that you unlock when you buy these toppers are garbage.

[07:19] So this is all about a collector who wants to have his game with all of the accessories Stern offers for the machine

[07:28] because then they feel it's complete.

[07:31] And when you look at it through that lens, that's where it gets really scary how much they could charge for something that is so little.

[07:39] They could have charged fifteen hundred for this damn thing and they most likely would have sold all one thousand.

[07:46] It just doesn't matter.

[07:47] Now Stern has made some kick ass toppers in the past like the Black Knight topper, the Batman topper.

[07:53] I would even argue even though it looks cheap, the Ghostbusters topper at least does something cooler than this Godzilla topper.

[07:59] Is it just me or does Godzilla in this topper look like he's actually putting out a fire versus creating fire?

[08:07] His damn plasma ray looks more like a fire extinguisher than it does look like something those tanks don't want to run into.

[08:15] But look, this topper talk comes and goes.

[08:17] We all get upset.

[08:18] We all yell at the pinball clouds how Stern is fleecing us and ripping us off and no one has to buy it.

[08:25] Don't let it get to you too much.

[08:27] I'm not that enraged by the topper.

[08:30] The real funny part about all of this is the electric playground gang over there, those two guys in St. Louis trying to sell their own Godzilla topper.

[08:39] And clearly they have friends who knew the Stern Godzilla topper was about to come out.

[08:45] And that is why they reveal their topper a day before the freaking Stern topper.

[08:50] These guys topper not only is it pretty damn ugly, it does look like a dog ball.

[08:55] And then they're going to offer like an even more enhanced version of it that has a piece of plastic that goes in front of it that has like four little screens that are going to show stuff.

[09:06] They need to just stop right now.

[09:09] Nobody is going to buy an unofficial topper for Godzilla.

[09:15] If you want to make toppers and you don't want to get a cease and desist letter from Stern pinball, because remember, you're not allowed to make a Stern topper for Godzilla that uses the Godzilla IP.

[09:29] And that is why this new topper from electric playground doesn't have any IP infringement.

[09:35] It's also why the damn thing is terrible.

[09:38] And it's why nobody's going to buy it.

[09:40] And if they're going to want to make toppers, what they should do is only make toppers for pinball machines that never had a topper.

[09:49] Make a topper for games like Twilight Zone.

[09:52] Make a topper for a game like Metallica.

[09:56] Don't waste your time making toppers for games like Godzilla.

[10:01] Don't waste your time making a topper for a game like Foo Fighters, because Stern is going to come out with the official Foo Fighter topper any month now and nobody's going to buy your product.

[10:11] Alright, so speaking about Foo Fighters and Stern, I've heard a lot of great stuff about the game.

[10:16] Owners are loving it.

[10:18] There's really only two complaints I'm hearing about Foo Fighters.

[10:21] Complaint number one is the game is so damn fast and somewhat brutal, but it's so fast when you're playing it that you don't really have time to look up at the screen and actually appreciate all of the amazing stuff that went into the animations in the code itself.

[10:41] So that's complaint number one.

[10:43] I don't know what you do about that.

[10:45] You know, it all comes down to like certain games are really fast and some games have more stop and go action.

[10:51] When you have a more stop and go game, you can appreciate what's on the screen more.

[10:55] The other complaint I'm hearing from customers of the game is they would like to see just a little bit more of the narrative come into the game itself.

[11:04] Like when you're in a city mode, they would like to see more call outs from the overlord and make it really feel like you're battling the overlord and you're sort of progressing through the narrative of the game.

[11:17] And so I think people are waiting to see if Stern pinball will add more of that to the game.

[11:21] But other than that, I'm really not seeing many complaints about this game.

[11:26] I think it's kind of scary now that Stern pinball has Keith Ellen and Jack Danger making pinball machines.

[11:34] They also have George Gomez and Brian Eddy and John Borg.

[11:38] How can anybody really compete with that lineup?

[11:41] I mean, they've got so much talent and the real talent at Stern.

[11:46] This is the scary part too.

[11:47] The real talent over there.

[11:49] You don't even really know who they are.

[11:51] You don't.

[11:52] Do you know all the mechanical engineers over at Stern?

[11:54] Do you know all the software people over at Stern?

[11:56] I don't just mean like the coders.

[11:58] I mean the people doing the animations.

[12:00] Like who did the animations for Foo Fighters?

[12:02] Are you familiar with them?

[12:04] Are they a household name like Jack Danger or Keith Ellen?

[12:07] And they just have so many people that are doing what they do so damn well.

[12:13] And this is just the beginning because what I also heard is Stern is in the process of moving into their much, much, much larger factory.

[12:22] And I heard the new factory is humongous and everybody has moved out of the old Stern factory except for the assembly line.

[12:31] So everybody else who works at Stern, they no longer are there and they're going to be working remotely for the next two to three months.

[12:39] And it makes total sense.

[12:40] Like keep making your games, keep the line going and the last thing to move over to the new factory will be the line.

[12:48] But here's what they're probably doing.

[12:49] They most likely are just setting up the new line in the new factory.

[12:53] And so one day they're just going to say, okay, you know, they're going to bring all the parts over everything over ready to go.

[12:59] And then all you got to do is bring over that workforce who makes the game and they're going to be able to jump right on to the new line.

[13:08] And then what happens to the competitors of Stern when Stern Pinball is able to make a thousand games a week, maybe more than that.

[13:17] It is going to be scary when you think about it.

[13:20] They can make all of Jersey Jack's Godfather CEs in one week.

[13:25] They can make all of the Scooby-Doo Run in two weeks.

[13:29] I mean, ultimately, nobody's going to be able to compete.

[13:33] The more Stern presses their foot down on the accelerator when it comes to manufacturing, they're just going to keep getting more buyers because people are not going to want to wait a year and a half, 18 months to get a game.

[13:44] They can have it pretty quickly when Stern turns things up.

[13:47] The only thing that's going to be interesting to watch really is what happens to this pinball market, right?

[13:53] If Stern can put 50,000 new games into the world every year.

[13:57] What is going to happen?

[13:59] Because old games don't really become old games because all of pinball is kind of old.

[14:05] And so games that have been coming out over the last five to 10 years that are kept in good condition,

[14:11] those games are still an exciting pinball experience.

[14:14] So when you think about the pinball marketplace and if you have something like 8 to 15,000 dollars burning a hole in your pocket,

[14:22] there are now going to be like 50 really good games you're going to be able to decide on which one do you want.

[14:29] And with so many games in the marketplace, and I've always said this, people are just going to run out of room in their homes.

[14:36] And when that happens, they're going to need to make room for the new stuff because a lot of new stuff is coming.

[14:41] Believe me, Stern's not building this new factory just to make old games.

[14:46] I mean, they are going to make a lot of new titles.

[14:48] A lot of exciting stuff is coming from every pinball manufacturer.

[14:52] But Stern pinball is going to be the only one that gets their stuff to market in the most effective and efficient way possible

[14:58] and based on the biggest themes in the world.

[15:01] Alright, speaking of biggest themes in the world, let's talk about the Godfather real quick.

[15:05] And I told my friend Derek, I was going to watch some of his Godfather stream.

[15:10] He did a great job streaming the game, explaining the rulesets, talking to viewer through how everything works in the game,

[15:18] how you choose your family, how you go on jobs, how you collect things.

[15:23] And I'm watching this stream for a half hour and I called Derek tonight because I wanted to talk to him about it.

[15:29] And I want to get him on the show to talk about why he loves this game so much.

[15:33] And I just want to say this, the first thing I said to Derek was, you owe me 25 minutes of my life back.

[15:40] And here's the thing about the Godfather, it's just such a hard theme to translate into pinball.

[15:47] And as much as I'm watching this game and I understand better now how to play the game and I'm watching Derek play it,

[15:53] I still can't help but feel like when I watch someone play the Godfather, I just never see like any real wow moments in the game.

[16:02] I don't see any wow moments in the mechs or in the shots.

[16:07] I don't see any wow moments when you start a mode or a multi-ball.

[16:11] And I just feel like one of the reasons why there aren't any real wow moments, because to create a wow moment in a pinball machine,

[16:19] you have to build up to it.

[16:21] And when I watch the way Jersey Jack choreographies its games, I think they need to step back and listen to some of the feedback.

[16:29] It does feel like you're stepping into a casino in Vegas.

[16:33] You're hearing like this non-stop music and chimes and beeps and all of these sounds and the lights are always going off.

[16:41] And so if all of that is always happening in the game, when you finally get to like a mode or a multi-ball or a scene from the Godfather movie

[16:50] and you want to create a dramatic moment, it never comes because the game, since the moment you plunge the game,

[16:57] it's always assaulting you with never ending music and call-outs, all these beeps and chimes and lights.

[17:05] It's just like everything louder than everything else.

[17:08] And I think they need to slow down a little bit.

[17:11] I really do think Jersey Jack needs to reassess these games a little bit.

[17:15] I don't think they need to make the games less of a deep rule set or have less to do in their games,

[17:21] but it's just the way they bring their games to you.

[17:24] It's just an assault on the senses.

[17:27] And I don't know, I think it's more numbing than it is exciting.

[17:31] I feel like it makes you feel a little bit more overwhelmed than over the moon.

[17:35] And I just think about some of my favorite game.

[17:38] And my favorite game of all time was a game that Keith Johnson coded, The Lord of the Rings.

[17:44] And when you think about the way multi-balls start in Lord of the Rings and how amazing they are

[17:49] and how much energy is there and how it builds to those moments, I don't feel that in his Jersey Jack games.

[17:57] I just feel like in his Jersey Jack games, he's always trying to do too much at the same time.

[18:02] And then when you look at the screen in Godfather and it's got the four quadrants and then it's got the quadrant in the middle,

[18:09] and like five different mini screens they want you to look at to track your progress in the game.

[18:16] And it's just all too much.

[18:18] And I really wish they would get back to more of like Gundon Roses and dialed in to me.

[18:23] My two favorite Jersey Jack games when it came to how they use the 27 inch screen.

[18:28] And I think they need to stop trying to put so much on the screen and just work more with the assets you have,

[18:35] organize them in a way that's easier and more digestible for someone playing the machine.

[18:41] Like you've got this iconic Godfather movie and you barely still see clips from the movie.

[18:47] There's not much of it in it.

[18:49] And I know it's not a high energy theme and it's hard to create like energetic moments of wow.

[18:55] Like Lord of the Rings has that.

[18:56] Like to war.

[18:57] Like it has those pivotal scenes in the movie itself that make you go crazy.

[19:03] Godfather has none of that.

[19:04] So remember that as I indict Godfather a little bit.

[19:08] And so even though the Godfather doesn't have like those high energy moments,

[19:12] it does have some of the most memorable moments in cinema history.

[19:17] And if you're going to show them Jersey Jack, show them freaking full screen.

[19:23] No, you get like a little bit of full screen at times and then it goes into the small screen in the middle.

[19:29] And it ends up on a newspaper and it's like, what are you doing?

[19:32] It's like you're thumb nailing some of the most iconic movie scenes of all time.

[19:37] And even when you're playing through the modes, you definitely don't feel like you're progressing through those iconic scenes from the movie.

[19:45] It's all chopped up.

[19:46] There's so much going on.

[19:48] And then once you start stacking all those multi balls and everything is going at once,

[19:53] it's almost like seizure inducing what's happening on that screen.

[19:57] And so Jersey Jack, at some point,

[20:00] I really do think you should invite into Jersey Jack pinball a focus group of like 20 different personalities,

[20:08] players and just get some real feedback on what people would like to see in your games moving forward.

[20:15] It's like they just keep doing the same approach.

[20:19] And again, I think them doing less work would actually help them out more.

[20:24] Sometimes less layers can make the cake more enjoyable to eat.

[20:29] And that's just my feedback for Jersey Jack pinball.

[20:32] I think they need to stop over baking this stuff, stop putting so much in and don't pick themes that aren't inherently exciting.

[20:41] All right, let's go to Canada's collector's corner.

[20:45] See what's been popping up in the marketplace recently.

[20:48] All right, so let's start here and AC DC, let there be rock new out of box with 631 plays.

[20:58] Now, AC DC, let there be rock is a limited edition game.

[21:02] They made different versions of AC DC.

[21:05] I think there was like a back and black edition.

[21:07] There was a Lucy edition.

[21:08] The let there be rock, I think was the rarest of the Le's.

[21:13] They made 200 of them.

[21:15] Now, I've never been a fan of any of the AC DC editions other than Lucy because I think Lucy,

[21:21] because it's illustrated is actually the nicest looking version of AC DC.

[21:26] Now they want $18,500 or best offer for an AC DC pinball machine.

[21:33] Yeah, I'm going to pass on that price.

[21:35] I think that's way too much money for this game as awesome as AC DC is as a pinball machine.

[21:42] It's still one of those pinball machines that came out in an era when Stern was using terrible Photoshop drag and drop artwork.

[21:51] So the artwork on it isn't there.

[21:53] The gameplay is there.

[21:55] It's a Steve Ritchie masterpiece.

[21:57] Limon sheets worked on the code.

[21:59] It has so many toys in it.

[22:01] I mean, if you look at AC DC next to Foo Fighters, it's kind of embarrassing in the toy department.

[22:06] But I just wouldn't spend that much on an AC DC let there be rock.

[22:10] You just have to be the biggest diehard AC DC fan.

[22:13] But even then, I just think the Lucy is the way to go if I were going to collect an AC DC machine.

[22:19] Alright, here's a new inbox.

[22:21] Never opened number 50 Jersey Jack Pinball Wizard of Oz Yellow Brick Road Edition.

[22:28] Now look, every once in a while I hear from a new pinball collector that gets bitten by the pinball bug recently.

[22:34] And they always ask me about two pins when they're thinking about Jersey Jack.

[22:38] They always ask me about guns and roses.

[22:40] And then they always ask me about Wizard of Oz.

[22:42] Now look, Wizard of Oz is a visually stunning pinball machine.

[22:46] I think the gameplay is pretty terrible.

[22:48] All the shots are up the middle.

[22:50] It's got that cheap drain on the left side.

[22:52] It's just not the most enjoyable game to shoot, but it is a packed machine.

[22:58] And I can see why when people stand over Wizard of Oz, they are visually blown away by the package.

[23:04] Now, the Yellow Brick Road Edition is pretty interesting.

[23:07] We don't know how many they made in total.

[23:10] It was a really weird thing.

[23:12] Jack was like, we're going to make this a limited edition game.

[23:15] And then he never said what the limit was, which is the weirdest thing ever.

[23:19] And I used to call him out on that when he announced this game.

[23:22] When this game first got announced, I think it was $12,500.

[23:26] So just note, this is $5,000 more than the game was originally, but there is a bud here.

[23:32] This game is for sale in Toronto.

[23:35] So I think this price is actually a lot closer to like $13,000.

[23:40] Now, would I buy a new in-box Yellow Brick Road Edition of Wizard of Oz?

[23:45] So here's the question.

[23:46] If you want to collect Wizard of Oz, which version of Wizard of Oz would I collect?

[23:52] Do you collect the Emerald City Edition?

[23:54] Do you collect the Ruby Red Edition?

[23:57] Or do you collect the Yellow Brick Road Edition?

[24:00] And just so you know, the changes on the Yellow Brick Road, it had the updated lightboards,

[24:04] but they removed the Monkey Mech from the game.

[24:07] But they also upgraded the computer and the back box area of the game

[24:12] are more upgraded in the Yellow Brick Road Edition.

[24:15] And then they made everything yellow.

[24:17] It looks like Roller Coaster Tycoon.

[24:19] If I were you and I were looking for a Wizard of Oz to collect,

[24:23] and how much would I spend on one?

[24:25] The one I would get is the Emerald City Edition, the first one in green.

[24:30] I think it looks the best.

[24:32] The wood apron is absolutely stunning, but you're going to need to find one.

[24:36] That has done the 2.0 kit lightboard installation.

[24:40] There have also been some amazing mods for Wizard of Oz.

[24:44] Like there's a Wicked Witch Mod that's amazing.

[24:47] There's other stuff you can put into the game that's pretty interesting that you can't get anymore.

[24:52] I would look for one of those and I wouldn't pay more than 11,000, 12,000 at most.

[24:59] I would try to get one for around $11,000.

[25:03] Does everyone else remember when Wizard of Oz Emerald City Editions were like $7,500 for like 5 years?

[25:12] Because nobody wanted them? Because they made so many of these games?

[25:15] Let's move on to Ghostbusters LE Mod with a topper.

[25:19] I'm not sure if this is that old machine we were talking about, but this one is $23,000 or best offer.

[25:25] I think this is the same game.

[25:27] No, this is a new game.

[25:29] Maybe the one for $24,000 or best offer sold.

[25:34] And this thing has been listed for three days on Pinside.

[25:37] Would I spend $23,000 for a Ghostbusters LE with a bunch of mods on it with the Ecto1 topper?

[25:47] I wouldn't.

[25:48] And the reason I wouldn't, it's just too much for a Ghostbuster.

[25:53] I think Ghostbuster LE's are collectible.

[25:56] I think the topper is now almost worth $5,000.

[26:00] It just is people.

[26:01] You can't find them anywhere.

[26:02] I think with that in mind, I think the Ghostbuster LE as just a machine alone.

[26:08] I think you're looking at 15 for just the machine.

[26:11] And then you got to think how much price are you going to put on the topper.

[26:14] I think a Ghostbuster LE with topper should be 18 to 18.5 no more.

[26:20] And I would offer that, right?

[26:21] 23 or best offer.

[26:23] I don't know.

[26:24] Maybe come in at 18.

[26:25] I think you're going to take it that's $5,000 less than he wants.

[26:28] Probably not.

[26:29] These things are just going to get harder and harder to get.

[26:32] Not easier and easier to get.

[26:34] Here's another James Bond 60th game number 64500 for $17,995.

[26:41] Trust me on James Bond 60th people.

[26:44] This game will be selling open next year for $12,000.

[26:49] Mark my words.

[26:51] You will see them being sold for $12,000.

[26:54] There are still so many distributors sitting on this game.

[26:58] Once Keith Elwin's jaws comes out, this game is going to go further and further down in value.

[27:04] This game will always have a negative stigma because of how Stern launched it.

[27:09] I would stay far away from this game at 18,000.

[27:13] You're going to be able to get one mint condition $12,000 within a year.

[27:19] Mark my words.

[27:20] I'm looking at two more Stern machines that are interesting to discuss.

[27:25] Jurassic Park Limited Edition.

[27:28] If you heard me on the pinball party, which by the way, I had so much fun talking to Jason on the pinball party.

[27:35] It was my first time on the pinball network.

[27:37] If you haven't listened to the episode, go listen to it.

[27:41] Jason was a really nice guy, very respectful.

[27:44] I had a blast doing the show with him.

[27:46] The show sounds amazing.

[27:47] He's an audiophile.

[27:48] I know Jason is not a subscriber to the Canadian Pinball Podcast, but if you know Jason, let him know.

[27:54] I gave him a shout out and then I had a blast doing his show this past weekend.

[27:58] Jason's favorite game is Jurassic Park Limited.

[28:02] A lot of people love this game.

[28:04] When you look down at Jurassic Park, it really is a loaded world under glass.

[28:10] Once that Jurassic Park theme song comes on, you're in it.

[28:13] This is going to go down as one of Stern's greatest pinball machines of all time.

[28:18] The only knock on this game, there's probably just three things people knock on with this game.

[28:23] One is the artwork by Johnny Crap is kind of crappy compared to Stern's other games.

[28:29] Number two, there's no assets from the movie.

[28:32] You could put in that hacked up code that puts the movie into it, but there's no movie clips in the game.

[28:38] And number three is that the game is hard.

[28:40] I hear this a lot. The game is really hard.

[28:42] As fun as the game is to look at, I think it's really hard for a lot of mediocre players to get through this game

[28:49] and see everything that's in the game.

[28:52] But that being said, it's Jurassic Freakin Park and on that level alone,

[28:58] and I think they only made 500 LEs of Jurassic Park.

[29:02] Maybe it was 800, but I want to say it was 500.

[29:05] So I think Jurassic Park LE will be a game that does hold value.

[29:10] It is definitely a game that collectors are going to want for a very long time.

[29:15] 17,000 fern. Do I like that price for a Jurassic Park LE?

[29:22] I think it's a fair price. I do.

[29:24] And I'll tell you why.

[29:26] $4,000 more than a 1,000 made Foo Fighters than a 1,000 made Rush.

[29:31] I just think that's it.

[29:33] I think all of these stern games where there's less than a thousand LEs,

[29:37] you can add another $2,000 to $3,000 to the value of those games instantly

[29:43] simply because of the supply problem with them.

[29:46] There's just never going to be more made.

[29:49] Now, here is the one thing I would be careful about with Jurassic Park.

[29:53] I would be nervous that Stern Pimbal isn't one day going to do an anniversary edition of Jurassic Park.

[30:02] An anniversary edition of Ghostbusters.

[30:05] I'm worried that they are going to do more and more of that with some of these big themes

[30:11] that are coming up on big anniversaries.

[30:14] And look, every five to ten years, all of these games are up for another 30th anniversary,

[30:20] 35th anniversary edition.

[30:22] And if Stern does that and makes them the most beautiful versions of the game,

[30:27] then that's going to be the one that every collector is going to want.

[30:30] So that's the only thing I would be nervous about, but I would also say this.

[30:34] We only live once and you don't know what the future holds.

[30:39] We don't know if we're going to be here years from now.

[30:41] We don't know if they're ever going to make an anniversary edition.

[30:44] So for most of us who collect stuff like Pimbal machines,

[30:48] we tend to live in the here and now and spend money in the here and now.

[30:52] And that's FOMO's greatest friend ever, right?

[30:55] The here and now is what FOMO loves.

[30:57] Like, I don't want to miss out on it and I want to get it.

[30:59] And this guy is selling it for 17.

[31:01] I'm going to go get it.

[31:02] Here is a Stranger Things LE for $19,250 in Massachusetts.

[31:09] I think that's overpriced for a Stranger Things 19-2.

[31:12] I wouldn't spend it.

[31:14] I think Stranger Things is a game that after COVID had a sort of resurgence in its popularity.

[31:20] I think it does some really interesting stuff with the UV kit.

[31:25] I think the theme is a winner.

[31:27] But remember, it's only season one and season two of Stranger Things.

[31:31] And I think as time goes on, and this is just my prediction,

[31:34] I think as time goes on, properties like Stranger Things are not going to age as well

[31:41] as properties like Ghostbusters and properties like Jurassic Park.

[31:46] They're just not.

[31:47] The more and more time that goes on, I think some of these properties become less and less relevant.

[31:53] That's just the thing.

[31:54] Now look, it's still going to be an iconic show.

[31:56] It had an impact on culture that was so significant.

[32:00] It's still one of Netflix's largest properties of all time.

[32:04] So I'm in on Stranger Things LE for maybe 16.5, not 19-2.5.0.

[32:10] Here's a funny one.

[32:12] For sale, P3 Multimorphic, P3 Heist, Weird Out, Lexi, Canon, and Cosmic Cart Racing.

[32:19] I mean, someone is trying to sell their entire Multimorphic collection.

[32:23] See, this is the problem when you buy all these Multimorphic kits.

[32:26] They're trying to sell all of it for $19,000 firm.

[32:31] Now look, none of it is collectible.

[32:34] And it really begs the question.

[32:35] I mean, this is it.

[32:36] Like, is the Multimorphic platform, when you go to sell it, this is what happens to you.

[32:41] Because remember, this person is paying almost $2,500 for each one of those separate games.

[32:46] It's just too much money.

[32:48] It's too much of a commitment.

[32:50] I know if the Multimorphic fanboys would say, well, you're getting like five games for the price of like what?

[32:56] For the price of what is the question?

[32:58] For $19,000, you can go get three Stern Pro Machines that are each better than all of these Multimorphic games.

[33:08] And that's the problem.

[33:09] If I'm going to spend $19,000, it better be on something epic.

[33:14] That's a pinball machine that's going to hold its value and be a collectible for a very long time.

[33:19] All right, the last machine I'm going to end up on, and this machine has gone down in price.

[33:24] It started out at $24,000.

[33:27] I think it started at $25,000.

[33:29] A KISS LE with the Stern, Topper and all of these added features to it.

[33:36] It is now listed at $22,500.

[33:41] So what do I think, $22,500 for a KISS LE?

[33:44] If you go on the pinside marketplace and type in KISS LE, this is the only one for sale.

[33:51] And whenever you get into this territory where there are no others out there, that is a very, very, very good sign.

[33:59] If you're a pinball collector, that this is something that is highly collectible.

[34:04] Whenever there are a ton of a game for sale, it is a good indication that people have moved on from the title or it's lost its popularity.

[34:13] Go on and look for Batman LE.

[34:15] Go look for Batman SLE.

[34:17] You know, go look for Ghostbusters LE.

[34:19] Go look for Tron LE.

[34:21] There's never many for sale.

[34:23] Go look for Lord of the Rings LE.

[34:25] There's none for sale right now.

[34:27] None.

[34:28] And so KISS LE at $22,000 plus with the Topper, which is also another one of these Stern Toppers that's impossible to get.

[34:37] It's almost hard to put a price on any of these unobtainable Toppers.

[34:41] Do I think KISS LE for 22,000 plus is a good buy?

[34:46] I think it's a little high.

[34:47] It's absolutely a little high, but this kind of game sale with this much in the game, this seller is looking for one person and one person only.

[34:58] They are looking for a KISS diehard fan who is new to the hobby.

[35:03] Because if you were in this hobby when this game came out and you were a KISS fan, guess what?

[35:08] You already have your machine.

[35:09] They are looking for someone who kind of got into pinball in the last two to three years who missed out on this game when it came out.

[35:16] I think this game is like six years old and they're looking for somebody who loves KISS dearly and is a very wealthy individual.

[35:24] And that is it.

[35:25] And they only need one person.

[35:27] They just need one person who fits that criteria, who's going to look at this game.

[35:32] And this is what happens.

[35:33] They're going to look at this game.

[35:34] They're going to refresh this page every day.

[35:37] They're going to just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, and then eventually they're going to wake up one day, not want to lose it.

[35:43] And they'll offer the guy 21.5 and they'll get the game.

[35:46] So I do think this game sells for over $20,000 to the right KISS fanatic.

[35:51] Would I spend that?

[35:52] No.

[35:53] It's also a very interesting testament to the overall reality of what's going to happen in pinball.

[35:59] And that is that stern pinball machines will be the ones that people collect predominantly.

[36:05] I mean, look at what's happening with Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition.

[36:09] Much more stunning game than KISS LE.

[36:11] Much more innovative, has way more songs in it, is much more visually impressive.

[36:18] Now it maybe doesn't shoot as well as KISS LE.

[36:21] And now you can find so many Guns N' Roses Collector's Editions for sale,

[36:25] which leads me to believe that that game is no longer a highly sought after collectible.

[36:30] And the price on Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition is really weak right now.

[36:35] You can pretty much get one for the price they were new if you factor in inflation over the last two to three years.

[36:42] But remember this people, if you're buying any of these like stern alleys at this price,

[36:46] you know, buying a Ghostbusters for $23 or buying a Stranger Things for $19 or a KISS for $22,

[36:52] trust me, I think on a lot of these games, this is the top of the bubble.

[36:57] Do not buy a game at these prices, expecting them to go further north.

[37:02] These are the kinds of games you buy at these prices, like my Batman SLE for $25,000.

[37:08] You buy a game like this at these inflated prices because you want to keep the game forever.

[37:15] It is not the kind of money you spend on a game because you want to then flip it in a few years for a profit.

[37:20] The days of profiting at this level are long gone, I feel.

[37:24] Alright, what a good episode of Canadian Collector's Corner.

[37:28] Wow, you guys who are still in the club at the beginning of the month, what a treat you have.

[37:32] And we've gone on now for much longer than the normal show, but I love doing this segment.

[37:36] We're going to do it every once in a while.

[37:38] And I just wanted to do it at the beginning of the month as a nice thank you to each and every one of you

[37:44] who remained a member of the Canada Club.

[37:46] And I'm going to say this, if you have friends that are not members of the Canada Club,

[37:51] please get them to sign up.

[37:53] Don't let them steal the content for free or share the content with them.

[37:58] I do a lot of work on this show.

[38:01] You will never know how much energy goes into this and my Facebook Live.

[38:06] And it absolutely kills me that so many people watch Facebook Live for free.

[38:11] We do tours of their game rooms where they have a half a million dollar in games.

[38:16] And then you're like, are you a Canada Club member?

[38:19] And they're like, no, you know, I'm not like, oh yeah, you spend half a million on games

[38:23] and you can spend 60 bucks a year supporting the dude that you hang out with every single Saturday morning.

[38:29] I don't get it.

[38:30] Anyway, Hexapimball, dead on arrival.

[38:33] Later everybody.
