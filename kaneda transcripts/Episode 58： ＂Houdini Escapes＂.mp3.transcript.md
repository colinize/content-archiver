[00:00] You can't talk about magic without the name Harry Houdini coming up.

[00:04] Many books and movies have been written about him and his exploits.

[00:08] And with October being National Magic Month,

[00:11] it seems like a good time to see if we have all of our facts straight.

[00:21] There's just too much irony to go around with this new company American Pimball and Harry Houdini.

[00:28] It has just literally taken over the conversation of Pimball as we head into the most anticipated expo in a very long time.

[00:38] On this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast, episode number 58, I want to discuss what we know so far, what's been going on.

[00:46] Yesterday's activities, which turned out to be kind of like a dud day where nothing really did happen.

[00:51] I think we all were expecting a lot more.

[00:53] But we got some stuff.

[00:55] We got some stuff and we know you guys have been talking a lot about it.

[00:58] We know there's still tons of speculation, tons of emotion, tons of feelings.

[01:02] So without further ado, let's talk about American Pimball, Harry Houdini and Zidware customers.

[01:11] And what is going to happen as we go into expo 2016?

[01:15] So yesterday was the day that we all thought that American Pimball was going to reveal to the world Harry Houdini Pimball.

[01:22] And we saw it in their press release that they were going to reveal it in Las Vegas.

[01:27] And nothing really happened.

[01:29] I don't know about you guys, but in the press release, it said 9 a.m.

[01:32] Alright, so then that's 11 a.m. New York time.

[01:35] I kept hitting refresh on Pinside throughout the day.

[01:38] It was just nothing. It was nothing.

[01:40] It was the same people on Pinside bickering amongst each other about this whole thing.

[01:46] And I get it. People are not patient. People are not in the mood to even let these guys have any sort of stage.

[01:53] But nothing came until very, very, very, very late in the day.

[01:58] I don't know about you guys, but I suffered through the presidential debate.

[02:02] It was completely nauseating. It's depressing to know that America has come to this.

[02:06] And our two candidates are as polarizing as we can get.

[02:10] I won't even go into politics.

[02:13] And then all of a sudden, we saw the flyer.

[02:17] We saw Mr. Cornelius holding it up.

[02:20] And people were just like, oh, it's stock photography.

[02:23] And this is all it's going to be is bullshit all over again.

[02:27] Bullshit, J-pop all over again.

[02:29] We're going to see a cabinet. We're going to see some blinking lights.

[02:32] And nothing else is really done. And it's all just a bunch of bullshit.

[02:35] And then, you know, what happened?

[02:38] We woke up this morning.

[02:40] And it seems like there's a pinball news story.

[02:43] We're Tim at Pinball News.

[02:44] Actually went over there and got a scoop for all of us.

[02:48] And I just want to congratulate Tim on doing this because I'll say this.

[02:51] There's so much moaning and groaning on pin-side.

[02:54] But nobody on that site actually tries and goes to get information.

[02:59] Did any of the guys out there, like Iceman, Wise Snow,

[03:02] any of the people out there that are super vocal about this,

[03:05] did any of them even try and reach out to anyone at American Pinball

[03:08] and just ask some of their questions?

[03:10] They didn't. But I did.

[03:12] Okay. And I reached out and I'm not affiliate with these guys.

[03:15] But I reached out to Scott days ago.

[03:17] And let me clarify a couple things that I've been told.

[03:19] And then we can go into what the American Pinball has said to Tim

[03:23] and the Pinball News story.

[03:25] On September 22nd, I reached out to Scott and asked if Houdini was going to be at Expo

[03:31] and what state it was going to be in.

[03:34] And he said, and I quote him,

[03:37] it's going to be at Expo.

[03:39] It's going to be $69.95 and it is absolutely playable.

[03:43] Okay. Let me repeat that. Absolutely playable.

[03:46] I know that there's been rumors floating around that it's not playable,

[03:49] that it's just another magic girl like Smoking Mirrors.

[03:53] Again, the irony of all the magical metaphors that apply to this whole endeavor

[04:00] are just ridiculous.

[04:01] So Scott says it's playable. Scott says it's going to be at Expo.

[04:05] Scott says it's real.

[04:07] All right.

[04:09] We've seen this before, right, with J-Pop.

[04:11] But the only difference is, and it's a big difference,

[04:13] is we heard this all from J-Pop.

[04:15] And I don't believe J-Pop.

[04:18] He says things are playable and they're ready, and nobody should believe him.

[04:22] But I don't know.

[04:24] Okay. So I still haven't seen it flipped though, right?

[04:27] I'm not going to take someone further word on it.

[04:30] I want to see it flip.

[04:32] And then we saw like a blurry image that Tim got from this machine inside the hotel room.

[04:40] And I don't know about you guys, and I don't know if I'm allowed to even feel this way

[04:45] because of all the pressure from people on the, on the inside.

[04:48] But I was kind of like, wow.

[04:51] It looks really, really cool.

[04:54] It looks like J-Pop game.

[04:57] I mean, oh, yeah, this is from a distance, but it looks, it looks awesome.

[05:01] But again, looks mean nothing.

[05:04] And I agree with the people that are like, we've been there, we've seen it,

[05:08] we were blown away by Magic Girl, we all were.

[05:11] And then when Magic Girl actually got turned on and we tried to flip a game, right?

[05:15] It was horrendous.

[05:16] So it doesn't mean anything.

[05:18] But again, the story this time is different.

[05:22] You can't just say that anything with J-Pop included is the same,

[05:27] is it going to be the same result?

[05:29] John tried to do everything on his own.

[05:32] He was a mad scientist in his lab, and he couldn't get organized,

[05:35] and he took on too much, and when he realized it was, he had gone too far,

[05:39] he did the wrong thing, and he asked for more money, and he kept going in the wrong direction,

[05:43] and he should, he should always be blamed for that.

[05:47] All right, there is no excusing J-Pop's behavior that he did with Zidware.

[05:52] There is no excusing when he realized that Magic Girl was starting to like sink

[05:56] that he just announced another title and took money for it.

[05:59] I mean, it's bullshit.

[06:00] I will never make excuses for that behavior, and you guys are right to be super fucking pissed off.

[06:06] So we see Houdini, and what are we supposed to think?

[06:10] Here we have this beautiful box with lights, and there's a hand drawn artist.

[06:14] The art from a distance looks amazing.

[06:17] Right? It's someone that has never worked with the pinball industry before.

[06:20] Well, like we know John, as like even a creative director,

[06:23] is really good at finding incredible artists out there and applying them the pinball.

[06:28] It's got the LCD screen in the back that we saw with Magic Girl.

[06:33] And according to Tim, it's got a whole bunch of unique toys, like a catapult,

[06:38] a loop-to-loop ramp, it's got a bumper that raises up.

[06:42] It sounds very J-Pop. It sounds like a lot of magic going on in the game.

[06:46] What is incredible about this game, if it's real, and it works,

[06:51] and it is playable at Expo, is the price.

[06:55] $69.95. Holy shit.

[06:58] If they can hit that, I think these guys have a legitimate chance.

[07:02] But we are so far from that point, right?

[07:05] We are so far from saying, yeah, they're going to make it.

[07:08] Yeah. I mean, when I hear stuff in the pinball news star that sort of jumps out at me and being worrisome,

[07:15] one of the things is like, we've been working on Houdini for three months, and here it is.

[07:18] Three months.

[07:19] Three months. And how can that game in three months be further along than John was with Magic Girl after three years?

[07:28] So what, who did it? I mean, I have so many more questions.

[07:31] Let me just go down my questions of American pinball.

[07:34] First and foremost, who's on this team?

[07:38] All I've seen is sort of like a dilapidated looking building with the American pinball printed out on a piece of paper,

[07:46] on a glass door, and all the blinds were closed.

[07:50] So it was just like a fake front.

[07:52] And who is this, Dave Hall, a Vasini, am I saying that right?

[07:56] And Scott Goldberg, I mean, where are they coming from?

[07:59] I know Scott is with Zizzle and is in the gaming world.

[08:02] But Dave Hall, he comes from a company, Amitron, is that the name of it?

[08:07] And they're a components manufacturer.

[08:11] And they have a factory, but it is interesting because you see someone showed Amitron's factory and then lined it up with where the Magic Girl cabinet is on its same exact space.

[08:23] So the question is of like, who's working on this game?

[08:27] Who's coding it?

[08:29] Where are they building these games?

[08:31] Where are they sourcing their materials from?

[08:33] Who are their vendors?

[08:35] How much backing do they have?

[08:37] How many games do they have that they're working on?

[08:40] But the most important question that everybody has, because unless this question is answered, nothing will really move forward.

[08:49] Well, I'm not so sure about that.

[08:51] I'm going to talk about that a little bit.

[08:52] But the most important question is what are you going to do for the people that were burned by John?

[08:59] And they keep telling people to be rest assured we're going to make those wrongs right.

[09:08] And so, yes, it becomes a whole world, we'll believe it when we see it.

[09:11] And that is why they leaked for us the Magic Girl cabinets.

[09:15] And it was a little, I think, a shame that the empty cabinets of Magic Girl have become sort of like a running joke for years.

[09:24] Like, oh, here we go again, more empty Magic Girl cabinets.

[09:27] But they are going on the record as saying we are going to get Magic Girl buyers their games starting at Expo and throughout

[09:37] 2016.

[09:38] Everyone who was burned by Magic Girl will get their game by the end of the year.

[09:44] And look, I keep seeing people being like, oh, for all looks like, but they don't take care of Ros and Alice Winterland.

[09:50] Guys, they have to start somewhere, right?

[09:53] So this is the first place to start.

[09:56] This was John's first pin.

[09:57] This is the first people that get burned.

[09:59] Start with those people.

[10:01] And then they will have to address the other buyers.

[10:04] Yes, yes.

[10:05] They know this.

[10:07] Everyone is acting like, well, they are just going to just do Magic Girl and just move on to Houdini.

[10:12] And that would be that.

[10:13] I don't think that is the case.

[10:15] I don't think they are going to win people over if that is their approach.

[10:18] So do we give them the time and do we allow them to explain what their attempts are going to be to make the Raza owners and the Alice and Wonderland owners right?

[10:32] Yeah, I am, look, I'm a grown adult.

[10:36] Everyone on Pinsides are grown adult.

[10:38] And when I hear stuff like, nobody deserves a fucking second chance.

[10:42] Nobody deserves to do what they did and come back.

[10:46] And look, I don't believe in that.

[10:49] I don't believe in a world in where there is absolutely no forgiveness.

[10:52] And there is absolutely no second chances for people because that is not fair also.

[10:57] If they make these people right, then I think it is fair.

[11:01] And I think there is an opportunity for there to be a second chance for J-pop.

[11:05] And because we're not evil people.

[11:08] This isn't like one strike you're out.

[11:10] And I know J-pop has had three strikes with three machines.

[11:13] And look, if you want him to be out, and here's the other part of this whole thing.

[11:16] When I see guys like, health and just, they don't deserve the stage.

[11:20] They don't, they don't, they don't, they don't keep them away.

[11:23] Look, at the end of the day, this is still a free country.

[11:26] And if you want to like go up there and show your goods and explain what you want to do.

[11:32] At the end of the day, the people who have the power aren't Scott, aren't American pinball.

[11:39] It's not J-pop.

[11:41] It's you guys.

[11:42] If you really want to send a message that John doesn't deserve a second chance, then just don't buy the fucking pin.

[11:49] Don't go to their booth at Expo or go to their, if they have like a presentation at Expo, go there and ask all your tough questions, all you tough guys and get your answers.

[12:02] Alright, be an adult about it.

[12:05] And speak with your wallet.

[12:07] And then you'll be fine.

[12:09] This company won't go anywhere if that is the case and no one places orders on pinside.

[12:14] But here's why I think people are really upset.

[12:17] And this is what we always try to do on this podcast.

[12:19] We try to get to a little bit of the truth underneath all the drama queens on pinside.

[12:25] I love it when people recommend that, hey, why don't you go listen to Canada's pinball podcast?

[12:29] And these guys are like, I would never do that.

[12:32] I would never listen to that.

[12:34] I would never support it.

[12:35] Why?

[12:36] If you listen to the last bunch of episodes around this whole thing, we've been completely fair.

[12:41] We've been completely objective.

[12:43] And more importantly, we've been completely timely in covering this whole thing.

[12:48] Where is everybody else?

[12:49] I've been going out my pinball podcast feed.

[12:52] Everybody is still missed this.

[12:54] Everyone doesn't, it's just still waiting for their weekly schedule.

[12:57] But I'm sorry when news breaks like this and you have a pinball podcast guys, get on it.

[13:02] Get on it.

[13:03] Don't just wait for our normal Sunday time.

[13:05] Like pinball used to be like that because there's never any fucking news.

[13:08] But between now and Expo, it's breaking news every day.

[13:11] So, at least give me some credit is what I'm saying for doing this at the frequency to get you guys something to think about as we go through this freaking the Asco.

[13:22] All right.

[13:23] So, in people are really upset because the truth is when I look at that image of Houdini pinball.

[13:32] And if it flips and it's fun and it's got toys and it's $7,000, it won't matter that it came from John Papa Duke.

[13:40] It will sell.

[13:41] It will sell and it will sell well.

[13:43] And the reason why that is the case is Houdini is a nice theme.

[13:49] It's fun theme.

[13:50] It's got lots of toys and lights and the J-pop aesthetic.

[13:55] It's priced beyond competitively where the market's at.

[13:59] And the majority of people who buy pinball machines are not on pinside.

[14:04] The majority of people who collect pinball machines are not on pinside.

[14:08] The pinside mob has proven time and time again that every time they make some sort of bold claim about what is going to happen to a company if the company doesn't bend to what pinside wants.

[14:21] That has never, ever effected a company in a bad way.

[14:27] I have heard from people at Stern, I've heard from people at other companies.

[14:30] The more these people bitch, it doesn't do anything.

[14:33] It doesn't hurt our business.

[14:35] So it makes no point.

[14:37] I mean, sorry, it makes no sense for us to be engaged in that community because why?

[14:42] Why? All people do is say, oh, this is bullshit.

[14:45] And we're going to, we're not going to go in.

[14:48] I mean, how many people said, if Stern raises prices, we're not going to go in.

[14:52] We're not going to, we're going to stand our ground.

[14:54] This is bullshit.

[14:55] Gary's fleeting the market.

[14:57] Okay, Batman 66 announced it sells out immediately.

[15:00] It sells out immediately.

[15:02] $10,000 for an L.E. and it's sold out immediately.

[15:05] That's $3,000 more than Houdini is going to be priced at.

[15:09] $3,000 more and it's sold out.

[15:12] And so like, fuck, there might be, there might be people might want to buy this.

[15:19] And what are you going to do?

[15:21] And they might be fine with, with or without you, pinside.

[15:24] But look, as much as like I get annoyed by people bickering back and forth on pinside,

[15:29] I appreciate that there is a place where people actually have a conversation, you know, like collectors.

[15:36] And there's a, you know, yes, you have to sift through all the bullshit to get to something good.

[15:42] But it's, it's where else would I go?

[15:44] Like to hit refresh door in the day to find the news.

[15:47] I mean, it is good at delivering that.

[15:49] These guys are like hyper, hyper tuned into what's going on.

[15:53] So the question is, is like, what they're going to do for Zidware?

[15:56] So I think we have to find out.

[15:59] I think we have to wait and see.

[16:00] And I think we're going to have the biggest answer at Expo.

[16:05] If Chris over at CoinTaker doesn't get his magic girl at Expo, then all of this is going to unravel super fast.

[16:13] They made a promise that they are going to bring his to Expo.

[16:17] That's in like a little over two weeks, guys.

[16:21] That's insane, which leads me to believe that magic girl is done.

[16:26] That they are just putting together all 25 and they are going to get them to the owners.

[16:31] And I've asked Scott this too, what's the deal with magic girl?

[16:35] Because you hear a lot of people saying, well, they should just make as many magic girls to fulfill all the orders of the rods that people in Alice and Wonderland people.

[16:42] That is not going to happen.

[16:45] I'm sorry for you guys who are in on Ross and Alice and Wonderland who of course would love to just take them to the corner.

[16:50] If you would love to just take a magic girl off their hands and be done with all the pain, you're not going to get it.

[16:56] They are not going to run magic girl in more volume.

[16:59] That is what they are saying.

[17:01] And it makes sense because if magic girl was sold to people at an extraordinarily high price of $16,000 or $17,000,

[17:09] for people bought it at that price for the exclusivity.

[17:13] And I know people, I've heard people on both sides of this argument saying, well, you know, people are just going to be happy to get anything.

[17:19] So they won't care if they run more.

[17:21] Maybe that's the case, but maybe not.

[17:24] But if you just give people who paid for it one and that's a call today, that kind of gets you past the magic girl problem and you can move on to the Raza and Alice Wonderland problem.

[17:36] So who knows?

[17:38] They might offer people who denies for Raza and where people take it.

[17:41] I don't know.

[17:42] I don't know what their solution is going to be.

[17:44] So you know, there's also a few vendors that J-Pop owes money to, that J-Pop also promised games to.

[17:51] I mean, J-Pop promised a game to Zombie Eddie.

[17:54] And I think if anybody gets a magic girl, Zombie Eddie has to get one.

[17:59] The man worked for Harley anything for John for years.

[18:03] And if it wasn't for Zombie Eddie's artwork, there would have been no excitement around magic girl.

[18:10] He basically deserves a machine.

[18:15] I don't even want to go on and on and on about it.

[18:19] I mean, John, you know what you told Jeremy and just make it right.

[18:23] Make it right.

[18:24] And the few people that John did promise machines to, I think they should get them.

[18:29] I'm not sure how many that is though.

[18:30] That's the problem with these agreements.

[18:32] As John didn't have books, you didn't have normal receipts.

[18:36] When I buy from a company, I get a receipt.

[18:38] I get like an order number.

[18:39] I get all this stuff that's documentation that I can then take and take to American Pimball

[18:47] and say, look, I bought a magic girl.

[18:49] How many people can show them actual documentation?

[18:52] I paid for magic girl.

[18:54] And I got this.

[18:55] And here's the checks I wrote.

[18:57] And here's the documentation.

[18:59] For those of you out there who just have John's word of mouth that you were going to get one,

[19:03] I mean, I don't know what you do there.

[19:05] Because that could just open up Pandora's box where everyone's knocking on their door and saying,

[19:10] hey, J-pop promised me a magic girl.

[19:12] You know, when I worked with John when I was doing a little bit of some marketing ideas for him,

[19:18] you know, he verbally said he would let me in on magic girl.

[19:22] He wouldn't take my money then because that's when I think he realized things were getting pretty dire

[19:26] and he had stopped taking money at that point.

[19:29] And I wanted to give him like 16 grand.

[19:31] I was like, wow, give you a check if I could get a spot and I'll do all this work.

[19:35] And you wouldn't take it.

[19:37] But I, you know, I'm not going to go there and say, hey, I did some work for John.

[19:40] And he said I could get a magic girl.

[19:42] And look, I put a marketing debt together.

[19:44] I spent hours on it, you know, whatever.

[19:46] I could say like, John owes me a check.

[19:48] No, I did it for free.

[19:49] I did it because I, you know, I was just trying to give this guy some ideas.

[19:53] But I'm not going to ask for a magical from them because of that work.

[19:57] But some people have been out thousands of dollars and John owes them that money.

[20:02] And maybe the game is what they deserve for restitution.

[20:05] I don't know.

[20:06] I don't want to get involved in it.

[20:07] I keep hearing that there were 19 magic girls that were sold.

[20:11] A few extra here and there.

[20:13] But that is around the number.

[20:15] So we'll see what they do with that.

[20:17] I think they're going to answer these questions.

[20:19] You're not going to get these answers from Canada.

[20:20] You're going to get them from Scott.

[20:22] You're going to get them from the people of American Pimball.

[20:25] What else?

[20:26] So, I mean, look, we're heading into Expo and Houdini is going to be there.

[20:31] And if I hold Scott to his word, it's going to be playable.

[20:34] Now, what does this mean for Expo?

[20:36] Should we let them into Expo?

[20:38] Should we?

[20:39] I know a lot of you say no.

[20:41] But I think we should let them into Expo.

[20:43] Come on.

[20:44] Again, as I said, we're grown, man.

[20:45] I want to see Houdini.

[20:46] Who doesn't want to see it?

[20:47] You want to keep it from being seen?

[20:50] John doesn't deserve to be able to bring a game in there.

[20:52] Well, you know, again, as I said, if you feel really terrible about it,

[20:57] go in there and curse them out, go in there and ask them tough questions,

[21:01] go in there and play it and see if it's actually a working game.

[21:04] We all saw what magic girl was like.

[21:06] Let the actual things these guys have done mean something, right?

[21:10] It can't all mean nothing.

[21:12] It can't.

[21:13] I mean, we're human beings.

[21:15] We have empathy.

[21:17] And look, here's the thing.

[21:18] I'm asking all of you out there to be better than John.

[21:22] Because I think John does lack empathy.

[21:24] I think John does lack the necessary sort of emotions to understand

[21:31] why people are acting the way they are.

[21:33] When John was going on Nate's show, I asked him, I begged him, I pleaded him.

[21:38] John, just fall on your sword, say your sorry.

[21:42] Just say your sorry.

[21:43] It was all your fault and ask for forgiveness.

[21:47] And he didn't do that.

[21:49] And after I heard that, I walked away.

[21:52] I walked away and I was just, I just felt bad for the guy.

[21:55] Because I'm like, he's incapable of some of these things.

[21:59] And part of that, why do I think that is?

[22:01] Because I think John has an incredible ego.

[22:04] And I think John doesn't understand.

[22:06] I think he looks at us like we are mere servants to his genius.

[22:11] That we should, we should, we should be thankful that he even graces us with his talents.

[22:16] And allows us to play.

[22:18] And that's how we approached a lot of his vendors.

[22:21] And a lot of the people who tried to help him with magic or on zidware.

[22:24] Is that he almost wanted people to pay him to become pimbal apprentices.

[22:29] And that's crazy in my mind.

[22:32] So I think John lacks a lot of the social and the empathy skills and the understanding of doing wrong.

[22:40] That most people have.

[22:43] So what I'm asking all of us to do is don't stoop down to John's level and be very single minded and stubborn here.

[22:51] I think people should like just keep an open mind.

[22:55] And yes, be very concerned, be skeptical.

[22:59] But don't be above giving people another chance to make it right.

[23:03] Now look, that, then the pressure falls on American pimbal to make all this right.

[23:07] And we're going to see what they do.

[23:09] Okay.

[23:10] And I think, look, it's September 20, what, seven today.

[23:13] I think we're going to get more news about this machine as the, because the show's open today.

[23:19] So I think we're going to get real photos, real conversation going with these guys.

[23:22] And so there might even be another Canadian pimbal podcast today as we discussed this.

[23:27] So this leads me to again, just, I want to just talk about the climate of the pimbal world right now.

[23:35] And what all this means.

[23:37] And I, nobody was expecting us to talk about this.

[23:40] Nobody was expecting this to sort of take over the conversation as we head into expo.

[23:46] A couple other things I want to discuss in relation to this.

[23:51] Batman 66 went from being the talk of the show.

[23:56] Stern's super early, Stern's application process, Batman 66 is now just a wait and see.

[24:03] It doesn't matter for Stern, they've sold out.

[24:06] Right. If you're Gary, you don't really care.

[24:09] This is all just like a distraction.

[24:11] You're probably pretty curious as to how this all came about.

[24:14] You're monitoring the situation for sure.

[24:17] Because it's, it's not going to look good if you show your $10,000 pimbal machine.

[24:23] And American pimbal is one for $3,000 less.

[24:25] Looks much, much better and seems much more magical and has much more going on.

[24:30] And let's be honest, it's going to be, it's going to be a fresher, new or feeling game regardless with that artwork and with a whole new layout.

[24:38] I mean, we can't forget that Stern is really just throwing a new layout in the upper left corner of Batman.

[24:45] And we're not going to see too much different stuff going on there.

[24:49] So, and here's the thing about Batman 66.

[24:51] And I was in on a couple.

[24:53] And I need to make up my mind today what to do with my deposits.

[24:57] I have it a positive game exchange and you don't have to say I'm probably going to get refunds.

[25:03] And I'll tell you why because I need to make up my mind today and I can't even see the damn pimbal machine.

[25:09] And I think that's insulting.

[25:11] And I want to, you know, this could have been a different podcast, but we'll loop it all in with this one.

[25:15] I think it's insulting what Stern is doing to customers around Batman 66.

[25:19] I think it is arrogant.

[25:21] I think it is closed-minded.

[25:23] And I think it is a little ego-driven.

[25:26] I think it's also like they're just trying to have fun with us.

[25:29] But don't, don't Gary.

[25:31] Don't Jarrett.

[25:33] Don't Jody.

[25:34] You guys don't George Gomez.

[25:35] You guys don't have to do this.

[25:37] Like, it's like you guys sat in a room and decided to come up with the most annoying way to market something that you're really excited about.

[25:44] Like, how can we fuck with these guys in a way that's going to get them all like talking?

[25:48] Oh yeah, let's ask for their money before they ever get to see it.

[25:51] We've never done that before.

[25:52] Let's fuck with them that way.

[25:53] Let's make them apply to give us $15,000.

[25:56] Let's fuck with them that way.

[25:58] And the whole thing, the whole thing, has put a really sour taste in people's mouths.

[26:05] And you have to understand, there is a balance between getting people excited with marketing and turning people off.

[26:12] And this whole thing is a turn off.

[26:14] So I need to lock in a $2,000 deposit on a $10,000 machine that I've never seen before.

[26:21] And I need to do that two to three weeks before I even see the machine.

[26:26] Fuck, no.

[26:27] Why would I do that?

[26:29] Why would I do that?

[26:30] Just take your word that it's awesome.

[26:32] I'm not going to do that because if, all right, if the LE was like the same price as Ghostbusters, maybe $8,000 and the deposit was maybe $500 bucks,

[26:43] I might consider it, but you can't do this, Stern.

[26:46] You can't make me spend the most money I've ever spent on a Stern Pimball machine, site unseen, with all the other options that are out there.

[26:53] I think anyone who agrees to this is kind of idiotic.

[26:57] Why would you do it?

[26:58] Oh, there's only going to be 240 Batman Ali's.

[27:01] I think we're beyond the point of treating these damn things like they're going to be unobtainium, and we have to rush in to get them.

[27:07] It's stupid.

[27:08] Why not wait and see what Lawler's game is, what happens with Alien, what happens with this whole Houdini?

[27:15] Is there going to be a Jetsons Pimball machine?

[27:18] I think there is.

[27:19] I know there's going to be one.

[27:21] What's going to happen?

[27:23] Why lock in?

[27:26] Why lock in?

[27:27] And the only reason that Stern is asking you to lock in is they're playing off of Fear of Missing Out.

[27:33] Fear of Missing Out is Stern's new marketing approach, and I think it sucks.

[27:37] We're not little millennial fucking teeny-boppers running around at fucking music festivals with neon glowsticks, living a fomo lifestyle.

[27:45] The people in Pimball, the people that are smart with their money, they're not driven by the fear of missing out.

[27:52] They want to make an educated decision, and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that there's no way to make an educated decision.

[27:57] When it comes to American Pimball, they show Houdini, and there's no Ali's, and it's just this is the game, and we're going to make this many, and it's one version.

[28:05] That's what I recommend they do, Scott.

[28:07] If you're listening, don't fall victim to this Ellie 3 tier system of making games.

[28:11] It's absolutely idiotic.

[28:13] Do not make like Magic Girl the first 25, like Ellie is in a whole super run of like regular's.

[28:20] No, no, no, no.

[28:22] Can we get back to just making a game the best way the game should be made?

[28:26] And if you want to make it limited, just limit the numbers of it.

[28:29] But I think Stern is super overshot here.

[28:34] And all of a sudden the $15,000 Batman super elite of me with 30 of them being made doesn't really even nearly excite me or feel that interesting next to the notion of like maybe Magic Girls are super limited.

[28:49] Right?

[28:50] So if Magic Girl comes out, and there's only 25 or whatever, 50 or whatever they make, but it's only that many of the game, who cares about super elite Batman when anyone who buys a premium is playing the exact same game?

[29:03] See, that's the problem Stern faces here.

[29:06] Their whole model is built around the dressings of the machines and not the actual game itself.

[29:12] You know, it's like Xbox.

[29:14] You ever see when they have the special edition Call of Duty bungalow that comes with a drone and all this shit, but we're all just playing Call of Duty.

[29:21] Why would I spend like 250 bucks on a special edition version of Call of Duty when I can just go get the $59 version of the game and when we get into the game, everyone's having the same experience.

[29:32] So I think it's, I think Stern really, really, really, their hype has gone away.

[29:38] And I've been talking to people over there and like, man, like everyone's talking about this other thing.

[29:42] Like, well, we're gonna have Adam West.

[29:43] Like, whatever, fucking, no one cares.

[29:47] People care more about Pimble than Adam West.

[29:50] And this big party, this big Stern's 30th birthday bash to itself, they fucked up.

[29:57] They fucked up marketing this whole thing.

[29:59] They should have shown Batman. They should have had people been really excited.

[30:03] They should have had it flipping like a week ago for people to see.

[30:06] They should have had a Jack Danger do a video of it and got people excited.

[30:11] They should have not done what they're doing.

[30:14] It's like, they should have just kept this super early as the version we're gonna hold for you to see.

[30:19] But at least show people the premium beforehand just to like, just to give people a reason to lock in their deposits.

[30:26] So I think Stern fucked up there.

[30:28] All right, sorry guys. I just listened to this podcast and I realized like the last few minutes,

[30:32] like, didn't get recorded and I'm at work now, so I have to close it out.

[30:36] So here's the thing. What else? So the other company is going on.

[30:39] So spooky, I know spooky is gonna be there. They're gonna bring Jetson.

[30:42] It's gonna be a very sort of like commission game.

[30:45] It's not gonna be considered spooky number three.

[30:48] And that seems to be spooky thing.

[30:50] They're gonna let people come to them and make games in a very limited number.

[30:55] That are gonna be licensed.

[30:57] And they're gonna have IPs, like Domino's like Jetsons.

[31:01] And they're not considering this to be like spooky's number three machine.

[31:05] So I don't know, it's a little weird.

[31:07] It's like the number counting is gonna get all discombobulated.

[31:10] Like what's a spooky machine and what's a commission machine?

[31:13] But that will be at expo.

[31:16] More importantly is, you know, I just keep trying to figure out like what is going on inside Jack's head and Andrew's head.

[31:22] They can't feel good about any of this news and all these latest developments.

[31:27] Because at the end of the day, for a boutique company to survive,

[31:30] you don't wanna have too much competition.

[31:33] Right? There's only so many dollars to go around.

[31:35] And you know, if money's going in in one direction, it's not going in your direction.

[31:40] So I think both of them have to be a little bit worried.

[31:44] And I think Jack's got an advantage having a Lawler's pen.

[31:48] Right? This is the pen that we've been waiting years for.

[31:51] But I think he has no hype going into expo about the reveal of this pen.

[31:55] I mean, Jack, what is your marketing doing?

[31:58] You're not showing anything.

[32:00] You're not even teasing a little bit.

[32:01] You're not getting anyone talking about this.

[32:03] In fact, the only way you mentioned it was like in just a sort of slight little remark on a Todd Tucky video,

[32:11] on Minute 33 of him visiting your open house.

[32:14] And that's how you're announcing your bringing Pat Lawler's machine to expo.

[32:18] And I just think it's like so at the market on me, it just cringes.

[32:21] It's like, why aren't you getting people talking leading up to the show?

[32:26] The other company that has to just be super worried is Andrew Highway.

[32:30] I mean, Andrew Highway cannot feel excited with these other machines coming out.

[32:36] If Houdini comes out in the next few months and is at that price point,

[32:40] how can he be excited about that?

[32:42] He's got to be watching Stern just sell out of Batman L.E.'s in a matter of days, even hours,

[32:49] at $10,000 price point, and he's still sitting on Alien L.E.'s.

[32:53] I saw him pinside yesterday, someone dropped out of their Alien L.E. order yesterday.

[32:59] And I look, I know that's just one order, but I mean, that every order hurts.

[33:04] Every order counts, too, right?

[33:07] And what is he doing?

[33:08] Like, where is the video?

[33:09] I mean, Andrew and Orrick have been so quiet recently, so quiet that I don't think that is a good sign.

[33:17] They're usually very vocal, they're very, they're very talkative, they're usually great at getting the community and people riled up, and they're just quiet.

[33:24] Absolute quiet.

[33:26] And where's the video?

[33:28] Where's the video that Andrew showed people months ago around Aliens?

[33:32] He still hasn't had Fox approval to show that video.

[33:35] I'm just getting the point where I just don't buy it.

[33:37] I don't buy that, it's that hard for him to get Fox's permission to show you something.

[33:43] So we're going to see, man, it's Sink or Swim Time for a lot of these companies, I think coming out of Expo.

[33:48] But here's the thing, and of all of this.

[33:50] And I think everyone is making a big mistake.

[33:52] They're letting American pinball swoop in and steal the conversation, steal the hype, and steal the excitement surrounding Expo 2016.

[34:01] Everyone is doing everything wrong, but these guys.

[34:05] Because these guys are giving you access, they're doing stuff, they're actually making moves.

[34:11] Where the fuck is everybody else?

[34:13] You're all just sitting back, sort of like with your hands and your pockets, waiting to like pull a sheet off your machine at the Weston in Chicago.

[34:22] And is that the best way to get people excited about your machine?

[34:26] When you're going into a major event, and I used to do E3 for many years, used to do auto shows for many years,

[34:32] you want to get people talking about your brand going into that event.

[34:36] Not just remain silent and let someone come in and just steal all the thunder, steal all the conversation.

[34:42] Because if the event were to open tomorrow, the machine everybody would run towards, would probably be Houdini.

[34:48] As much as you guys will say, no, no, no, they're the only ones that have really made us super curious.

[34:54] They're the only ones that have shown us enough to get like excited.

[34:58] And it's just, I don't think you can just fall back on the laurels being like Pat Lawler, and that's, we're not going to give you anything else to chew on.

[35:05] Alien, like come on Andrew, show us something, show us like the alien head, Mac.

[35:09] You already showed it like a year ago, how does it work?

[35:12] Can you just show us one function? Get people excited, get people talking.

[35:16] I think everyone should be ashamed. Even Stern, I mean all these guys are pumping, the Stern is pumping so much marketing dollars into the show.

[35:22] And all of a sudden everyone's talking about American Pimble.

[35:24] And you, all these other companies need to get their marketing acts in gear, and they need to realize it's beyond the point where you can just sit back and think money's going to come to you.

[35:33] You are going to have to fight for every dollar, and you're going to have to convince people why they should buy your games.

[35:38] And you're going to have to excite people.

[35:39] All right, and if you're just sitting back and waiting for them to come to you, it's not going to happen.

[35:44] It's not going to happen.

[35:45] And once you lose the hype, we've seen this. If you lose the hype, it will take you really, really long time to get it back.

[35:52] And you may never get it back. You may never get it back. You might just turn out to be the next, next, the big Lebowski.

[35:57] All right, there's no hype around that machine. And look, this is how it's going to be.

[36:02] We are on the eve of Expo. I am asking all of the manufacturers out there, give us something, show us something, get people talking.

[36:09] And we will see what happens at Expo. I'm excited. You guys should be excited. And just remember in life.

[36:15] Right? There are times when we should get people second chances.

[36:19] I don't think we've seen enough from American Pimball to say that they deserve a second chance. That Cheapop deserves one.

[36:27] And I think their actions are going to have to speak louder than their words, louder than the color palettes on the art of the new machine, louder than the LEDs, louder than everything.

[36:37] Their actions will define whether or not the company sinks or swims. But at the end of the day, too, the other side of my brain is like, it doesn't even fucking matter, because people will just buy a shiny new Pimball machine without even seeing it.

[36:48] Let alone like seeing one that has a lot of toys and bells and whistles. So we're sort of like damned if you do, damned if you don't.

[36:55] It's crazy. It's a crazy hobby. Some days I love it, some days I hate it. But at the end of the day, Expo 2016 is going to be the shit. Have a good day.

[37:04] We'll see if we get some Houdini pictures today. Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen.
