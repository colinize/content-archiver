[00:00] I want to read something for you right now and I don't think I've read something that

[00:15] has inspired me to do a show more than this single comment from a pinball company.

[00:21] And this occurred in the pinball brothers on November 24th at 4.16 am.

[00:29] As they were doing their alien pinball teaser campaign on Facebook, a person who's

[00:34] part of this community, his name is Billy Mills, he wrote the following that this is my dream

[00:41] theme.

[00:42] I lost $4,000 on that machine.

[00:46] All right.

[00:47] So we obviously gave Andrew highway a $4,000 deposit for his alien and never got his machine.

[00:54] And the pinball brothers responded to Billy with the following.

[00:58] We are sorry to hear that you lost money.

[01:01] We know exactly how that feels exclamation point.

[01:05] However, pinball brothers has no liability for the debts of another company.

[01:11] If you are still interested in a game, please do contact support at pinballbrothers.com.

[01:18] And we might be able to work something out together, but we can make no promise at this

[01:25] stage.

[01:26] Okay.

[01:27] So we do a show about this and about something else that just hangs over this entire hobby.

[01:35] And that is this hobby's ability to give people who have misled customers a second chance

[01:43] at redemption, but without doing the right thing.

[01:46] And I want to talk about that because I think that this hobby for some reason invites individuals

[01:53] to do things that are disingenuous, that rob people of their money, that willingly tell

[01:59] people half the truths, that walk away with people's hard earned money without getting

[02:05] them a machine.

[02:06] And we've seen it time and time again, there are far more failed pinball ventures than successful

[02:11] ones, right?

[02:13] And there's a lot of new people to this hobby every year who don't understand the past

[02:17] of what's happened in the pinball world.

[02:20] And the reason I want to do this show is two companies right now are trying to pave

[02:24] a way to the future.

[02:26] Two companies that would very much benefit from revisionist history.

[02:30] They don't want people to know what John Papaduke did over at Deeproot.

[02:35] They don't want people to know what the pinball brothers were about with Andrew Highway.

[02:39] They would simply like you to forget all of that and go in on these new games.

[02:44] And it doesn't work that way because there's a memory to these moments that happened.

[02:49] And I want to talk about that on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast because I think

[02:53] it's important that we actually hold these companies accountable to some of the crimes

[02:58] of the past.

[02:59] And that some of these individuals make up for some of this behavior if they want a new

[03:04] chance at redemption for forgiveness by us in the future.

[03:09] And in the present even with some of these companies who are really rolling these games

[03:13] out right now.

[03:14] And so let's look at pinball brothers real quickly because the line that they say, this

[03:19] line is everything.

[03:21] The pinball brothers has no liability for the debts of another company.

[03:26] Okay.

[03:27] Now here's the truth to that statement.

[03:29] The truth is the pinball brothers were highway pinball.

[03:33] It wasn't another company.

[03:35] It was their company.

[03:37] They were the investors with Andrew Highway.

[03:40] Andrew Highway's name may have been on the company door and on the product.

[03:45] But it was the pinball brothers and those gentlemen who funded the entire thing.

[03:51] And I get that they lost money as well and they kept throwing good money after bad money.

[03:56] And they kept reinvesting in Andrew Highway and they made a humongous mistake when they

[04:01] did that.

[04:02] But it still was their company.

[04:03] And so they were still inside that company when Andrew Highway was taking deposits from

[04:10] people when we know that he was misleading people on when they can expect their games.

[04:15] And he was trying, you know, he was trying to like stop the ship from sinking.

[04:19] No pun intended because that's where he went after highway pinball.

[04:22] But he was trying to get new pre-order money in to build the games that people had already

[04:27] paid in full.

[04:29] This is the part about all these companies that people forget.

[04:33] Most of these companies sink for the following reason.

[04:35] The same thing happened to Dutch.

[04:37] They take people's money, right?

[04:39] People pre-order the game.

[04:40] They then did not get their game yet.

[04:43] The company had those people's money and they wasted that money on development costs,

[04:49] traveling around the world doing all sorts of things.

[04:52] That money never went to actually paying for the parts for that person's game.

[04:57] So then the only way you can build that guy's game is if you get new money in.

[05:02] And so that's what ended up happening to highway pinball.

[05:05] And these pinball brothers were on board for all of that behavior.

[05:09] They knew what was happening.

[05:11] Okay.

[05:12] So then what happens is the pinball brothers, they come out from behind the curtain and

[05:18] then they bailed out Andrew Highway and then they kicked them to the curb.

[05:22] We know the story, right?

[05:24] The pinball brothers gave new life a second chance to highway pinball's alien buyers and

[05:30] they said, we're going to write this ship.

[05:32] We're going to solve these issues and Andrew Highway is going to take a step back and we're

[05:37] going to finish making the aliens and quickly and pretty immediately they realized that the

[05:43] troubles they were in and that the whole that Andrew Highway had dug for the company,

[05:48] there was no way out.

[05:50] There was too much financial debt for them to ever make a profit.

[05:54] And if they kept investing in highway pinball that this company would collapse and ultimately

[05:59] everyone would lose.

[06:00] They would lose more money, customers wouldn't get their games.

[06:03] So what did they do?

[06:04] They simply created a new company which was the pinball brothers and they bankrupted highway

[06:10] pinball so that if you bought a game with highway pinball, they are not legally bound to the

[06:17] debts of that company because now they have a new company.

[06:21] And so what they did was they transferred over the assets from highway pinball to pinball

[06:26] brothers.

[06:27] Okay.

[06:28] So the pinball brothers wants to be an entirely new entity that has no responsibility to the

[06:34] debts of highway pinball even though it's the same people.

[06:37] Now that is the problem.

[06:39] That is the problem.

[06:40] We're not stupid.

[06:42] Like we know that it's the same people.

[06:44] So do you think that this company should get a pass and be able to do this, to use some

[06:50] legal jargon and to sidestep the problem they created many years ago and just be able

[06:58] to start over again without any responsibility to all those people who lost money with

[07:04] Andrew highway.

[07:05] Now the one thing they're not doing is coming out and saying we're sorry we made a mistake.

[07:12] We backed that guy and he bankrupted the company.

[07:15] He was much more in debt than we realized.

[07:18] You know this is the problem too is none of this is like how you ever want to start a new

[07:21] pinball company.

[07:23] Why would you ever if you want to make pinball machines which are meant to bring joy

[07:27] and excitement to consumers.

[07:29] Why would you ever start a pinball company that is trying to pick up the torch of failure?

[07:38] The torch of failure.

[07:40] Alien pinball and highway pinball represented failure.

[07:43] It represented lost money.

[07:45] It represented like a lot of people who have lost enthusiasm for the hobby and it pissed

[07:50] off a bunch of people.

[07:52] Why start with two and a half strikes already at the plate and do something like this.

[07:58] But these people are in my mind they're even worse than what deep root is doing with

[08:02] John Papaduke's customers because at least deep root set up a system in which Robert gave

[08:07] people money back.

[08:08] I do applaud Robert for doing that.

[08:10] If you lost money with John Papaduke he gave people an opportunity to get a check.

[08:16] I think it was for around $4,000 or something.

[08:19] Like it wasn't a dollar to dollar exchange but at least you got something back.

[08:23] I think we have to give Robert credit for that.

[08:26] But these gentlemen are doing no such thing.

[08:28] There is absolutely nothing they are doing for people who got burned by Andrew highway.

[08:33] But again let me remind you they are doing nothing for people that got burned by their own

[08:39] company.

[08:40] This is why I think we can't have revisionist history and just forget about this stuff.

[08:46] It is also why this New teaser campaign for Alien Pimball and I get it.

[08:51] You want a great Alien game to come back out and so do I.

[08:55] But we can't just bury this stuff under the carpet.

[08:58] This is not how you do stuff.

[09:00] We should not step over the carcasses of our community friends who got burned by the Pimball

[09:06] brothers.

[09:07] And this is why Canadian Pimball Podcast is the one Pimball Podcast that none of these

[09:11] companies want around.

[09:13] They don't want this podcast to be out there.

[09:15] They don't want us to be talking about this stuff.

[09:17] I mean if you go back to September 14th of 2017, Deeproot Pimball put out a statement

[09:23] and they said the following, podcasters most notably Chris of Canadian Pimball Podcast,

[09:30] released podcasts with harsh criticism of Deeproot.

[09:34] All of this of course caused severe negative reaction to Deeproot since John Papaduke

[09:40] still owed many Zidware customers refunds or machines.

[09:45] That was September 14th of 2017.

[09:49] And you see what happens here.

[09:52] It becomes the people like myself who are simply trying to remind us all that you can't

[09:59] give up on some of this history that you just can't let everything go that making a Pimball

[10:06] machine in the present day does not absolve companies of the wrong doings that they did.

[10:13] That if some of our friends and family lost money on some of these ventures, those people

[10:18] shouldn't just have to walk away dejected it for the rest of their lives while these

[10:23] companies get a second chance and they get to absolutely ignore all those people they

[10:28] burned.

[10:29] So I think it's good on Deeproot that they gave Zidware customers a chance.

[10:34] I am seeing no such thing from the Pimball brothers.

[10:37] And so for all of you out there that are watching this teaser campaign that are wondering

[10:41] when aliens going to return, Ishikago Gaming Company is going to make it.

[10:46] Is American Pimball going to make it?

[10:47] I want to tell you right now, none of it matters.

[10:50] None of it matters.

[10:51] As far as I'm concerned, these gentlemen should not be given a second chance unless they

[10:56] do make those customers whole that lost money who gave money to these gentlemen.

[11:02] It wasn't another company.

[11:04] It was their company.

[11:06] And how convenient it would be for them to have us all forget that.

[11:10] Now, I think we need to put our foot down on some of this stuff.

[11:13] And I think as a community, we need to stand up for the rights of those of us who are our

[11:17] friends who are part of this community.

[11:20] You just don't get a second chance like this without making it whole.

[11:25] And Robert knew that and that's why he did what he did.

[11:27] Now the problem with this stuff, the problem with both of these companies when it comes

[11:32] to trying to course correct.

[11:35] The reality is this and we've seen this time and time again.

[11:39] There just is no financial way out of some of these holes because there's not enough margins

[11:45] in Pimball to make up for six or seven figure debts.

[11:51] You can't do it.

[11:52] There's just no way you can sell enough razas to make up for the amount of money that

[11:58] John Papaduke has spent developing this game.

[12:02] You can't make up for the amount of deposits that you had to refund people.

[12:05] There's just no way to do it.

[12:07] The only way you can do it, the only way you can do it is if you have a game that can

[12:12] sell many, many, many titles so that you can then increase the price of it.

[12:18] This is what Dutch Pimball is doing.

[12:20] You increase the price of a high demand product and you are able to sell enough over the

[12:26] bomb to have enough profit where you can make the old investors whole and get new people

[12:31] their games.

[12:32] That is exactly what Dutch Pimball is slowly doing with the big Lebowski.

[12:37] Remember, big Lebowski was $8,500 and they went bankrupt because they could not afford

[12:44] to pay their vendor, their contract manufacturer to make the games at $8,500.

[12:50] What did they do?

[12:51] They jacked the price up by $4,000.

[12:55] It's almost a 50% increase in the big Lebowski Pimball but that is the only way they could

[13:02] survive is doing it that way.

[13:04] The benefit of having a title like the big Lebowski is people love that movie.

[13:10] I see there is a light at the end of the tunnel for Dutch Pimball because people would go

[13:16] in on such a great theme and people would absolutely go in on a great theme like Alien.

[13:22] I think if they can make Alien again, these gentlemen can sell this machine.

[13:28] Alien Pimball wide body with all the toys in it, new magnets in it, it's a $10,000 plus

[13:34] machine and if they price it at that, they will sell.

[13:38] It will easily sell but what they need to do is if you are going to make this machine,

[13:43] you need to give those gentlemen and this is what I am asking of the Pimball Brothers.

[13:48] Someone who lost money on Andrew Hywae's BS company, it was also your BS company Pimball

[13:54] Brothers.

[13:55] You need to give them credit towards the new Alien machine and you need to think this

[14:00] through and you need to articulate what that will be on day one of announcing this game

[14:06] is coming back.

[14:07] Robert did it with Deeproot with the Zidware customers but you can't avoid this and I just

[14:13] read that comment on Facebook and it just compelled me to do a new show in the middle

[14:18] of the week because we need to demand this of the Pimball Brothers.

[14:23] What I don't want to have happen is them just go on other shows and do interviews and

[14:27] talk about how excited they are to bring Alien back and look they are going to have to answer

[14:31] these tough questions sooner or later but I don't think they can answer it with ambiguity.

[14:36] I don't think they can answer it with like oh we are not sure yet.

[14:39] Even like they said like reach out to us and we will tell you like maybe we will work

[14:44] something out.

[14:45] I'm telling you right now maybe we will work something out is not an official statement

[14:49] that's not going to make someone feel good who lost money four years ago maybe we'll

[14:53] figure something out.

[14:54] No, there's no maybe we'll figure something out.

[14:58] If you want permission to come back into this hobby and be part of this Pimball community

[15:02] Pimball Brothers you need to work it out and there needs to be no maybe it needs to be

[15:07] a definite solution you have for those people that your company burned okay.

[15:12] Don't try to do some like side stepping with some legal liability BS like we're not stupid

[15:17] we know it was you we know it was you it would be like it would be like if canada retired

[15:22] canadas Pimball podcast and came back as Chris's Pimball podcast and Chris's Pimball

[15:27] podcast cannot be held accountable to anything that was said on canadas Pimball podcast.

[15:33] The only thing we will transfer over to Chris's Pimball podcast are his three twippy victories

[15:39] alright so that's my point people is we just need to make sure we hold these companies

[15:43] accountable.

[15:44] I want to say this I had a bunch of conversation last night on my two year wedding anniversary

[15:49] night and this is always what happens in Pimball like my phones blowing up it's Jeff Patterson

[15:53] over at this week at Pimball being like dude what are you doing why you saying this stuff

[15:57] about the twitties and I just want to say for the record look we did highlight the new

[16:01] scoring system it is what it is I'm not going to keep bringing it up I'm fully confident

[16:07] that we are going to get votes and it's going to be beneficial to canadas Pimball podcast

[16:11] I will say this I did find it funny because Jeff said to me he's like dude this new scoring

[16:16] system will probably help you help you he said and and my mind I'm like help me I've

[16:23] won three years in a row.

[16:25] Third what what help do I need it's the only place you can go when your number one is

[16:30] down it's not going to help me get more votes and but like it is what it is I just want

[16:35] to say look I support the twitties I love that we have an annual end of the year well

[16:40] it's actually in March I do think it's way too late in the year I won't let that part

[16:44] go Jeff but I think that it's great that we have this moment in which people can recognize

[16:49] and show their support for what they love in Pimball so it is a very great thing so I'm

[16:54] not here to piss on it at all and I told this to Jeff I'm like you know I love the twitties

[16:58] nobody loves the twitties more than canada nobody puts more energy into the twitties than

[17:03] canada nobody promotes the damn show more than canada and heck when it comes to acceptance

[17:08] videos nobody put more effort into their acceptance video last year than canada so don't

[17:13] point fingers at canada saying I'm slamming the twitties canada has like propped up the

[17:18] twitties for three years now all right so what else am I looking at right now that's

[17:22] new so I want to tell you right now that I'm staring at the play field quality control

[17:28] that Mirko is putting on all guns and roses play fields moving forward and I got news

[17:33] yesterday that consumers of Ellie games have been told their games are shipping so that

[17:39] is happening this week new Ellie's of G&R are going out the door now that also means

[17:45] they once again are making them the most expensive buyers of the game wait the long is to get

[17:50] their product and collector's editions will most likely not be under the Christmas tree

[17:56] this year and so I do think that is a another fail by Jersey Jack I mean look ultimately

[18:02] you came out with this game on October 5th you got everyone excited you took 12 5 from

[18:07] 500 people around the world 12 500 dollars and now three months later these people still

[18:15] don't have their games and they're watching Ellie's go out they're watching scs go out

[18:20] it's a fail it's a really it's not look I also have said this the game is worth waiting

[18:25] for and I and I bet those people want high quality machines and again I think one of the

[18:30] reasons why the C.E.s were delayed was they had play field issues again I mean this is

[18:34] willy wonka all over again they were not expecting there to be pooling in these machines

[18:40] and so they made the executive decision to hold off on the C.E.s until they figure out the

[18:45] play field issues I mean I mean look it's the same story it's a broken record with these

[18:49] damn play field issues I can't believe we're we're here again but here's what the image

[18:53] looks like on the miracle play field it's in the lower right corner at the very end the

[18:58] very tip and there is a big seal it looks like one of these like you know a good house

[19:04] keeping seal of approvals it's orange and red and in the middle it's like a ribbon with

[19:09] a like you know one of those seal things around it it says quality real big and white letters

[19:14] and it says play field control and then quality across the middle okay and then it has a

[19:20] section on the left that is where you screw in a post and so this is what they're going to do

[19:27] to test the quality of these play fields now is this is this the fix we've all been waiting for

[19:33] now if you were to ask me I don't really get how screwing a post into the lower section of

[19:41] the play field that's under the apron is actually going to indicate for them whether or not

[19:46] there's an issue because as we're seeing in the games it's areas that take vibration and pounding

[19:54] that are causing those posts to pull the slingshot area the post that are getting hit by the ball

[19:59] directly pretty frequently that's usually the areas where the play field starts to pull and

[20:05] lift and whatnot so not quite sure how just a static screw or post going into this area of the

[20:12] play field is going to be all they need to know before they ship these play fields the Jersey

[20:18] Jack pinball so we'll see what happens but I will say this when those new LEDs get unboxed if

[20:25] there is still pulling in these games then they are going to have a real PR crisis on their hands

[20:32] and see owners are going to be so anxious about getting their games and you should not be anxious

[20:37] about getting a $12,500 pinball machine okay what else is going on in pinball right now so you

[20:43] know the Gary Stern interviews tomorrow to you know December 3rd I have an exclusive interview with

[20:47] Gary Stern so don't miss that all right what else is going on in pinball the last thing I want to

[20:51] say is this and this is just me noticing what's going on in the hobby it is funny to see all of the

[20:56] alien pinball machines all of a sudden pop up for sale like people are trying to sell their s's

[21:01] of alien pinball for like 13 or 14 thousand dollars and I'm here to tell you right now if you buy

[21:08] a highway pinball alien pinball right now knowing that there's a new one right around the corner

[21:14] with all improved parts in a better cabinet with much better stuff put into the game if you spend

[21:21] 13 or 14 thousand dollars on a game that was originally $6,500 or revisionist history don't forget

[21:28] what alien originally cost people if you spend 13 or 14 thousand dollars on an alien pinball right

[21:34] now I'm telling you right now you're pretty stupid don't be stupid just don't be stupid this

[21:40] holiday season don't be dumb there is and obviously don't be stupid because the game's about to

[21:46] come out again this whole teaser campaign is leading to a new better version of alien so I find

[21:52] it funny that all these alien owners are all of a sudden trying to ditch these products right now

[21:57] don't be stupid and hey maybe hold on to those old aliens because maybe it's the ones with the

[22:02] screen in the play field that's going to be the rare one everyone wants 20 years from now when we

[22:06] all wake up from this stupid pinball coma and realize investing all this money in all these

[22:11] pinball machines was absolutely idiotic and then all of our friends who bought Tesla stock are

[22:17] rolling around in Lamborghini's and you're still driving a Honda Civic wondering why nobody cares

[22:21] about your collector's edition and on your your lineup of LEDs like oh man it sucks why'd you

[22:26] buy Mustang L.E. frolic why'd you buy it you know but you know what I'm saying is like don't be

[22:31] stupid the other thing that's happening in the pinball marketplace right now and it's unavoidable

[22:35] to see this how many Rick and Morty's have changed hands I don't think I've ever seen a game

[22:41] switch hands so frequently with so few out there like Rick and Morty but my favorite part about

[22:48] the Rick and Morty sales are always this it's always like this sellers are always like this game's

[22:52] amazing this game's incredible I love my Rick and Morty but yeah here it is for sale oh yeah my

[22:59] favorite is Delph like Delph's cleaning out his entire collection Delph who was like such a fan

[23:03] of alien he's trying to sell his alien for like 13 5 he's trying to sell his Rick and Morty my favorite

[23:09] is what he said and Delph's a fan of the show so brother I just had I just had to call you out here

[23:13] Delph is selling his Rick and Morty and I love this sales tactic love the game it's so much fun

[23:19] I'm in no rush to sell it just seeing what's out there that's Delph's line he's just seeing

[23:23] what's out there he's just like he doesn't know what's out there you know exactly what's out there

[23:27] Delph you just behind his brother you're trying to make money on this game because you realize

[23:32] right now you can still possibly make a profit on it it's not that you're just seeing what's out

[23:37] there you need money for guns and roses you need money for Avengers L.E. you need money for this

[23:42] new alien there's so many new games you'd rather have and nobody wants to be honest and say this

[23:47] nobody only canator will say this the reason you're selling your Rick and Morty is it doesn't

[23:51] shoot that great nobody's got the guts to say what canator will this is why this is going to be

[23:57] the fourth twippy for canator because I'm the only one who has the guts to get up and say

[24:00] you're selling your Rick and Morty because it doesn't shoot great and the code's a little shallow

[24:05] and after like an hour or two of playing the game you've seen the entire game and you don't really

[24:11] care that Greg Colton Mr. Rare Hero is on a mission to collect 50 megacids that's the only

[24:17] reason to keep playing this game for Greg to get to those 50 megacids and even Greg's listening

[24:22] to this being like oh man he's right he's right that's why Greg's voting for me and the twippies

[24:27] because he knows that he's trying to get to those 50 megacids but if you don't care about getting

[24:31] to 50 megacids there's nothing to really do in the game after a couple hours and that shots are

[24:37] not that satisfying that's why people are letting it go now here's I think Rick and Morty is a

[24:42] fun pin don't get me wrong it is a really fun pin but it's almost like the perfect location pin

[24:48] it's the kind of pin you can hop on and in a half hour you have a lot of fun but it's almost like

[24:53] you don't need to own it and I think that's why you're seeing so many people transfer these games to

[24:58] new owners the other thing is this there's money to be made let's let's not beat around the bush

[25:04] for a lot of these guys they pay 8500 88 with tax for their Rick and Morty so if they can get

[25:10] 9500 10,000 for it why not because they know that that's not going to be available to them

[25:16] six months from now when every game is out I mean I paid 9500 for mine and I sold it for 11,000

[25:22] so that money's getting moved right over to Guns and Roses collector's edition now I wish I had

[25:28] the Rick and Morty playfield quality my G and R but such as life all right all right everybody

[25:33] this has just been another edition of can you just pinball podcast is it twippy season are we

[25:37] going to start going on overdrive who knows who knows it's always fun as we head into January and

[25:42] we get into twippy season it brings out the best in every pinball podcast or everybody have a great

[25:48] day if you have any feedback for me canada pinball at gmail.com no I'm not buying your alien pinball

[25:54] for 13,000 yes I did say that people are selling Rick and Morty because they don't shoot great

[25:59] yes I did say that the pinball brothers have to make the old highway alien buyers whole and yes

[26:06] Robert you did the right thing with giving people money back with john poppity but there's still a long

[26:11] a long way to go before any of those did where buyers are truly made whole because we need the game

[26:17] out gotta get that game out that's the ultimate moment of like you did it because the goal was to

[26:23] make a working john poppity game available to the world and we still haven't seen that yet and

[26:29] it's twenty twenty one is the earliest we're going to get it and four years ago remember four

[26:34] years ago it was canada pinball podcast that caused tremendous harm to people's perception of my

[26:42] company come on people I'm just a pinball podcast as I told Andrew highway many years ago when he

[26:47] grabbed me at tpf and yelled at me I said Andrew all you got to do is get people their games

[26:55] and nothing I say matters and you know what he did he never did that canada out

[27:17] time
