[00:00] Last night's pinball stream of James Bond's 60th, I think, was one of the lowest periods

[00:07] in pinball since I've been covering this hobby.

[00:10] This is the most expensive pinball machine that has ever been released by a manufacturer.

[00:14] $1995, and Stern Pinball is ashamed of that price because they've removed it from their

[00:20] website, they don't even want to stand behind it.

[00:23] And when the most expensive pinball machine of all time gets streamed by the biggest pinball

[00:28] company in the world, isn't it fun?

[00:29] Funny how they were moderating out the comments when people were asking about the price, because

[00:34] nobody saw $20,000 in value, nobody saw $15,000 in value, nobody even saw $10,000 in value.

[00:43] Everybody knows the reality behind this game.

[00:46] This is a Stern home edition, this is worth like $5,000 to $7,000 at most.

[00:51] And the game itself is all over the place, it's a mess, you don't need the scoring

[00:55] reels, you don't add anything to the game, you've got no call outs, there's no real

[01:00] innovation on the play field whatsoever, you've got barely any code in the game.

[01:05] And so look, it's not about this game, it's what this game represents.

[01:10] It's really unfortunate that our hobby is now being hijacked by greed people, it is simply

[01:16] greed.

[01:17] As a community, we have spent millions of dollars with our distributor friends buying these

[01:22] Stern machines over the years.

[01:24] And Bitball has made so much money, and this is how they pay you back as a collector,

[01:30] and I feel ashamed for them, I feel ashamed for Keith Lwind being up there and having

[01:35] his name associated with this $20,000 machine.

[01:38] I feel ashamed for all you distributors out there that are trying to convince us that

[01:43] this game is worth anywhere near that much money.

[01:46] And we all know you're making like anything over $15,000 is money in your pocket, so

[01:52] no wonder you're trying to convince us to buy this game.

[01:55] And then you've got the James Bond fanatics that are going to war for this game, but I'm

[01:59] here to tell you right now, none of us, and I mean none of us in this community should

[02:04] be celebrating this move.

[02:06] If you buy this game, you are sending a message to Stern Pinball that this is okay, that

[02:12] you can put almost nothing in a machine, almost nothing, no software, no moments, there

[02:17] was no pinball moments in this stream last night, absolutely no call outs, no energy,

[02:22] none of what we love about pinball came through in this game, other than like some interesting

[02:28] geometry and shot layouts, which Keith Lwind could design in his sleep.

[02:32] And now all of a sudden this thing is $20,000.

[02:36] All of a sudden we're going to start getting fleeced by the number one pinball company in

[02:39] the world, and everybody knows the real truth.

[02:42] Just not even about this game ladies and gentlemen, this game at this price is a Trojan

[02:48] horse.

[02:49] To make the rest of us feel like these $13,000 or LEs are a good value.

[02:55] To make the rest of us feel like these $10,000 premiums are a good value.

[03:00] All of a sudden just a few years later you're paying double what you used to pay for Stern

[03:05] LEs.

[03:06] And now you want to tell me that that's fun?

[03:09] Why is anybody going along with this ride?

[03:12] Why are people celebrating this?

[03:14] Why would anybody support this?

[03:16] And I don't want to be a part of this hobby anymore.

[03:19] Where they're going to censor people asking Stern and Keith Lwind and George Gomez and Jack

[03:24] Danger.

[03:25] Show us where the $20,000 in value is in this machine.

[03:30] They don't even want to give us the ability to ask that question.

[03:33] When people interview Keith Lwind, they're not asking him that question.

[03:37] And I think that is sad.

[03:39] And I don't know what happened to all of us grown men, but they've absolutely amasculated

[03:44] so much of this community where so many of you rich guys are just saying, well, it looks

[03:49] fun and I can't wait to shoot it.

[03:51] Is that the only conclusion you can come to?

[03:54] It looks fun and I can't wait to shoot it.

[03:57] How about the fact that it's $20,000?

[04:01] Let me tell you something.

[04:02] McDonald's French fries are delicious.

[04:05] And they're still delicious if McDonald's charges us $100 for the French fries.

[04:10] But if I charged you $100 for French fries, people would boycott McDonald's.

[04:15] And yet Stern Pimbal can usher out this game, a game with barely anything in it.

[04:20] And it was an absolute joke to see this machine as being sold for this much money.

[04:26] And there was a reason why Stern Pimbal didn't stream this game before they took your

[04:29] hard earned money because they knew.

[04:32] They knew if they streamed this machine before the order banks opened up that almost nobody

[04:37] would buy this game.

[04:38] And so this is what Pimbal has become?

[04:41] This is all it is now.

[04:42] A bunch of greedy companies cash grabbing us before they show us what's in the game.

[04:48] This is what Pimbal has become now.

[04:50] $15,000 Jersey Jack machines that they're going to make a thousand of.

[04:54] And then Stern Pimbal trying to justify that most of these games are going overseas.

[04:59] These James Bond games.

[05:00] No, they're not.

[05:01] You've seen what the exchange rate is on this game overseas.

[05:04] It's like freaking $30,000 in Europe and it's like $40,000 in Australia.

[05:10] There is no way these games are heading overseas and people are gobbling these things up.

[05:14] And I mean it when I say it, if you buy this game and if you support this kind of move,

[05:19] you're just hurting this hobby for everybody.

[05:22] And where's the fun in that?

[05:24] Like where is the fun in any of this?

[05:26] There's no innovation in this game?

[05:28] There's no hard work that went into this game.

[05:31] Keith L. Winn can make this game in his sleep.

[05:33] And I'm sorry, but I just got so disgusted looking at the stream last night and then looking

[05:39] at the comments as everybody kisses Stern's ass with this move.

[05:43] Stern Pimbal, if you're going to make a $20,000 machine, it should be the greatest machine

[05:48] you've ever made.

[05:50] Not this joke.

[05:51] And if this hobby keeps going in this direction, more and more people are going to get fed

[05:55] up with it.

[05:56] More and more people are going to exit the hobby.

[05:59] And I mean it when I say you distributors need to have our backs.

[06:03] When Stern pushes a product like this on you, say no, we're not taking it.

[06:09] We put our faith in our trust and our distributor friends and you've got to have our backs.

[06:14] So when distributors say they price this perfectly, they're letting us down, all right?

[06:19] What an embarrassing day for everybody involved with this game.

[06:23] And what an embarrassing day for anyone supporting and celebrating this move in Pimbal.

[06:27] This is horrible people.

[06:29] Let's get back to loaded games where the value is there.

[06:33] Scooby-Doo is half the price.

[06:34] Galactic tank force is going to be half the price.

[06:37] Every Pimbal machine should be half the price.

[06:39] We've got to wake up people.

[06:41] Canadian Pimbal podcast out.

[06:43] And if you're not a club member, maybe you should join because we're the only ones

[06:46] saying this stuff.
