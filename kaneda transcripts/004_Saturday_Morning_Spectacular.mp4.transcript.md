[00:00] All right, we are allowed.

[00:07] Down, down in the basement.

[00:12] The lighting is, you know, it's grainy.

[00:15] It's too dark in here or something.

[00:19] We're going to share, we're going to be sharing screen.

[00:24] Copy this link.

[00:26] Just get everybody a Facebook in the house.

[00:30] This is going to be a good show.

[00:32] I mean, I've been waiting all day to talk about what we're going to talk about.

[00:37] And I think this is going to be a show that some people get upset about.

[00:44] But I think most of you will appreciate what we're going to talk about.

[00:53] I'm so excited to do this show.

[00:59] I can't even tell you.

[01:02] I can't even tell you how excited I am.

[01:05] Well, I just did tell you.

[01:09] But Brian Cos is in the house.

[01:12] We're going to let people come in.

[01:13] You say hi to me.

[01:14] I am in Massachusetts.

[01:16] Brenda's great aunties 90th.

[01:21] 90th birthday.

[01:24] I'm really, really looking forward to the party.

[01:32] Bill Brand is my join.

[01:34] He's not happy.

[01:35] He's not.

[01:36] Does anyone hear anything negative about Potter?

[01:38] I love these people.

[01:39] They really only want to hear one side of it.

[01:43] But you know what?

[01:44] We're going to do.

[01:45] We're going to show on this Saturday morning spectacular that everyone started to see what I'm going to do.

[01:50] I'm going to start to see what I saw first.

[01:53] Everyone starting to realize there's a lot of work that has to be done to make this game click for people.

[02:00] And it's it's good.

[02:01] It's good feedback.

[02:02] And they should they should take it to heart.

[02:05] Christopher Franchise in the house.

[02:07] Welcome.

[02:08] We got Mike Jones.

[02:09] We got Charles Thomas.

[02:11] We got people coming in.

[02:13] They're going to get in.

[02:14] They're going to start to hear what we're saying.

[02:17] What we're saying is that the text messages are going to be going out.

[02:20] You need to turn on canada Saturday morning spectacular.

[02:23] He just mentioned you or he mentioned this about the game.

[02:27] How do we stop this guy?

[02:29] I don't even think he plays bimbal.

[02:31] I don't even think he likes bimbal.

[02:33] And here he is all these years later.

[02:35] He's made more episodes about bimbal.

[02:40] Then most bimbal companies have ever made games.

[02:43] We are going to have a good show.

[02:45] And you know what I love about this hobby is is that every few months we get something new to react to to play.

[02:54] I don't think I've played a game more on launch week than I've played of Harry Potter.

[03:00] I went over yesterday.

[03:02] I played the game a lot more.

[03:04] I've put I played the game.

[03:06] And this is like you can't.

[03:08] This is why I think people are going to be listening to me because the 95% of people on the pin side that I've been playing.

[03:14] People on the pin side that have ordered this game have never played it.

[03:18] And now I can I can say with a straight face I've put hours on this game.

[03:25] I also played the longest game probably anyone's ever played on it because I tell you what I did.

[03:33] I wanted to see into the game more.

[03:37] Mike is great at automated for opening the door.

[03:39] The CEO is set up.

[03:40] If you want to play the game and you're near Millford Connecticut, it's it's worth the trip.

[03:47] It's a display sample of the CE game.

[03:50] I played about two hours in total.

[03:54] But you know playing straight through is the key.

[03:57] It's annoying when you have a new game and you're just trying to get a sense of it.

[04:02] It's annoying to do two ball games, three ball with other people.

[04:06] And my boy Frank was with me and he was nice enough to just like let me just let me play.

[04:13] Let me bake on this game.

[04:15] Let me see what's going on.

[04:17] Let me let me after hearing how Eric coded this game.

[04:20] I really we went into it being like all right.

[04:23] Now we know how this game is coded.

[04:26] Now we know what their philosophy was and making it this way.

[04:30] Now let's go experience what we know is in the game.

[04:36] And lots of thoughts I have to share with each and every one of you about what that experience was like.

[04:43] How much more of an understanding I have of why they made the game this way.

[04:50] How much more feelings I have around.

[04:53] If I think this was the right way to make the game.

[04:57] Do I think they can fix things do they need to fix things all of it's going to be discussed on today's Saturday morning spectacular.

[05:07] Going to discuss what this game means.

[05:10] I think how it will be received by the pinball community.

[05:16] And how the shelf life of enthusiasm around this game.

[05:21] How long do I think it's going to last right?

[05:23] Is it going to be a game that people are going to want for years based on theme alone?

[05:28] Is it going to be a game where word of mouth elevates people's enthusiasm to get it or is it going to be a game where word of mouth early on.

[05:36] Makes people wait on the sidelines.

[05:39] So all that and more on today's Saturday morning spectacular.

[05:44] I've been up since four o'clock in the morning because I drove three hours to get here.

[05:50] Surprise Brenda she didn't think I was coming.

[05:53] You know she thought I was like a bad husband.

[05:55] I was just like gonna let her go.

[05:57] Now she went yesterday like I just I couldn't do two days away.

[06:01] And sometimes when you have the house to yourself if you saw my my life last night.

[06:07] It was nice to just play pinball loudly on a Friday night on a Friday night.

[06:14] It's going to sell great.

[06:16] Yeah man Harry Potter sales are going to be amazing.

[06:21] Who cares right is it a great game or not Harry Potter would always sell great.

[06:26] If if if hexa pinball made it someone asked me to talk about hexa pinballs.

[06:30] What was it?

[06:31] What was that game even I even forgot the game.

[06:35] What's that hexa pinball game?

[06:38] It's something Ranger or something space Ranger space monkey.

[06:43] Why why I sorry I literally just had the game.

[06:48] Oh let me see it was space hunt thank you Ryan.

[06:56] And I was like look I he's like I got a good idea for a show topic.

[07:00] Talk about hexa pinball space hunt and I'm like I don't think anybody bought it.

[07:05] I don't think hexa pinball is going to I don't know have much of a future if they keep making games like that.

[07:11] So it is what it is.

[07:15] So we're going to get going here so we've only been here for six minutes we're going to get more people join.

[07:21] I'm also going to do something that I think is important because I'm going to share and we're going to watch.

[07:28] A few other pinball personalities talk about Harry Potter code and talk about the game because I think they nail it.

[07:37] Oh at least one of them nails it and understands exactly what I've been saying about Harry Potter now for a week.

[07:44] I think more and more people are coming on board and we're going to air that in a little bit.

[07:49] But I want to give everybody here my take okay.

[07:53] My take on Harry Potter after playing it for over an hour yesterday sitting on the game.

[08:02] Diving into the game diving into the modes seeing the multi balls getting to the big Hogwarts battle I think it was called battle for Hogwarts it was it was that mode.

[08:15] It's like you get to that it's very much like Lord of the Rings.

[08:19] If you do the three multi balls it then unlocks the battle for Hogwarts and it is one of the coolest modes.

[08:30] The sound during it and the atmosphere and the sort of you know the sense of achievement and accomplishment to get there.

[08:41] The only bad thing is you're probably never going to even see it unless you do something to your game because the game is once again one of these games where to unlock the things that are like magical are really really really going to be difficult for people to get there.

[08:59] It's difficult for people to ever experience them on a three ball game and this is not about playing better it's just so much is buried deeper into the game.

[09:13] And I'm just not sure and the other thing is this when you experience some of those multi balls and those moments it makes you wish they gave you these moments more.

[09:26] As you know you're starting all those movies and the movie modes and and so here's all I want to talk about Harry Potter code first and foremost the one thing about this game.

[09:39] If I had to summarize it before getting into more specific details if I had to summarize this game right now it is a beautiful game to shoot with quite possibly one of the most.

[09:54] Confusing codes I've ever experienced in a pinball machine because there's everything happening at once at all times as you're playing the game.

[10:06] And so imagine this imagine playing guns and roses which I know last night I triggered some people by saying guns and roses is a much better coded game than Harry Potter is right now because you understand what you're doing.

[10:23] And in pinball understanding how to play the game is important for you to have enjoyment like in guns and roses I know I'm just trying to collect the band members when I do that I can start a song by shooting the scoop and then I'm in the song and each song becomes a mode and it tells you what to shoot in each song differently and it and again like but you're intimately connected to that song when you started.

[10:52] Harry Potter is the opposite it it's the so imagine guns and roses imagine you start living let die right and you're you're loving it like you're an imagine in the middle of the song or just at the beginning right when acts was like set live and let and it's like do get that theater boom quidditch match start imagine if you kept interrupting what you're in the mode to do with everything else happening.

[11:21] Else in the game is still on right everything else is still registering everything else is still you know making sounds everything else is like you know stacking up on top of what you think is the thing you're supposed to be focused on and imagine if that was happening in guns and roses it would be horrible and that is exactly what's happening in Potter.

[11:44] You select your movie and what happens when you select your movie is you're starting the different lessons from that film and it's just linear going through each one I think it's something like 30 seconds on a timer whether or not you make your shots or not doesn't matter it's just going to go on to the next scene.

[12:09] So talk about removing any sense of satisfaction of getting through the mode because it's just it's just like you're just going to get through it and when that starts you also you know they have the rights to all the voice actors and the synced up and it's in there you can hear it but it's so low that you don't really connect with the scenes but here's the bigger issue I have with Potter first.

[12:39] First and foremost Eric said he wanted to create a game where casual fans can walk up and experience the movies they love the characters they love and and you know jump on a machine and when he says casuals I mean he means people that are like walking up to a pinball machine probably for the first time maybe that are even Harry Potter fans they are never going to see anything because the only way to even begin seeing that stuff is a difficult shot like it is a difficult shot.

[13:09] The scoop on the right is not easy it is one of these shots where you're going to hit it only even with your like a good player you're going to be hitting it like 30% of the time at best if you're good at pinball I mean it's off the tip of the left flipper you can't backhand it it's a very difficult shot and that's the shot required to even get started with your movies.

[13:38] Okay, so that's an issue right I would never have made such a difficult shot the way you start getting into the game I think that is a bad decision it should have been something simpler okay.

[13:52] Okay, then when you start a movie this is the other issue I have it's like Mark silk I think's voice is introducing each movie and what they don't do when you start a movie is they don't just like let a little bit of the movie clip play full screen like introducing you to that film.

[14:13] So that's a huge miss because you don't again feel like you're achieving or turning on a connection to the films it just starts playing.

[14:25] You know you start the linear loop of whatever the first scene is that is started and that's it and there's no drama there's no excitement that starts off it doesn't turn anything else off everything else is still going every switch is still doing something else that's outside.

[14:43] So you're going to have that mode and then what they've done is they said hey you have to hit the red shots and the gold shots to get through the modes but it's so unsatisfying first and foremost it is hard to even tell which shots you're supposed to hit.

[14:59] It is very hard to tell the inserts on this game are small you can't read any of the writing on the inserts and there's just something about the fact that it's just not satisfying because you see the red and the gold inserts lit you have to sort of find them and then when you everything else is still lit around them so imagine that you don't that's why you don't feel like you're in this mode I don't feel like I'm in this movie right now because it didn't change the game at all.

[15:28] The whole game is still just all on all the time and now there's just two colored inserts I'm looking for amongst all the other stuff lit up at the same time makes it really unfulfilling to play it like that and so that really is unsatisfying and so I and then from there you got to imagine what the experience is like.

[15:58] It's like everything's in a blender at once so you don't feel a connection you don't get pulled into the movie with a full screen clip even if it's just five seconds 10 seconds just hairy like what you know what i'm saying like here like there there are pivotal moments in all of these films that could have been used to introduce the movies and what they're about and there's nothing there's nothing you hear Mark silks call outs just over it.

[16:28] It all and what's also what's crazy in this game and and I mean this is just one of the things that just I really don't get is why they have the boring sound on the slingshots it never turns off so when I was in battle for Hogwarts this epic music like David feels music is so good in the scene the sound effects are incredible it's like it's like it's my it was my favorite moment playing this game that in the owl multi ball we're so cool.

[16:58] And the people I were with they were saying the same thing that everyone just wants more of the game to be like this like every time you start a movie this is what it should feel like this is how the game should come at you not what's happening with everything all these like side things happening all at the same time but you're in this like battle and it's dark and the music is amazing and then in the middle of this like dark battle you boring.

[17:27] Boying boy boy like why didn't they just turn it off you know like I love the rings I don't think lor the rings even as a slingshot sound I don't think you even have to give the slings a sound effect why does a slingshot even needed you're going to hear the sound of the physical sling through the glass and you'll hear it always you it's just it's just one of those things so to give it a sound effect on every sling.

[17:57] And the slingshot is absolutely like a terribly distracting thing to have when you're like in this moment.

[18:07] So you know after walking through and seeing the way they've kind of built this game code wise I walked away just so like unsure of what they were thinking because I just I just don't understand I mean I'm not sure what they were thinking.

[18:25] I just don't understand I mean I get what Eric and company were doing that a really difficult task of getting eight films into a pinball machine experience and it's a lot so they kind of broad strokes the movies and I think they they focus more on the moments that you're going to remember are the multi balls that will unlock another like many wizard mode multi ball moment like that's.

[18:55] What you're driving towards in this game you will not feel much when you start these movies and I I don't know if this is the case but are you supposed to be able to like is one of the things unlocked when you get through all six of those films because I'll tell you this right now.

[19:15] You're never going to get through like two on a three ball game never like you're just not going to get through it all I really I really worry that this is another case of these guys had an intention to put all this stuff into a game but like forgot what pinball is they forgot what pinball is on a fundamental level that pinball you know a three ball game will only allow you this one.

[19:45] I've got to spend much time to experience this much pinball and I think they forgot that and even on like I had like a half hour game because I'll tell you what I did I was like I was using the coin door ball save to just stay alive to see what this game would bring me and and that's how I got that 900 million score was saving the ball.

[20:11] I will say this after playing it for like a half hour for it's amazing how repetitive the game does get and how how few moments there are because of how the movie moments just don't come through in a very meaningful way right now and so I understand the direction they took but I think they had a golden opportunity a golden opportunity because here's here's what I think they were going for.

[20:41] That whenever you start a game they know you're not going to make it through all six movies they wanted so every time you play Harry Potter you could pick from one of six movies and like that's your game like your game will be that movie experience I get it but then the movie has to come through more and that's not what's happening and then they need to make it so when you're in those modes you are experiencing Harry and his friends journey through that film.

[21:11] You were what's okay so that's that's gang where I'm at I think this code is hurting this game.

[21:23] I think people that are playing it now are feeling the same way and I think people that order this game.

[21:32] I don't think you quite know what you're about to get and I think I think once you see what I've been talking about you're going to feel the same way and I think what's going to happen is there's a lot of expectations now on them fixing this and the code is at point seven zero but historically I don't know I worry that Jersey Jack is laid too much of the foundation of the code and they're not going to fix it I think to me the fix is.

[22:01] They need to stop stacking everything need to stop having seven things you can be doing all at once allow the gamer allow the player to intimately be in the movie the whole game the shots should be in dedication to getting through the modes of the movie I don't want everything else to be on so my point is that I'm going to be in the movie.

[22:30] So my point is this so then yeah have a shot that's a red or yeah gold shot have it up there were quiddages but I want to get up there to hit that shot to get through the mode of the movie I'm in I don't want every time I get up there to be starting a quiddage tournament because why are you taking me to a quiddage tournament if I'm at you know the dinner table and the you know the first movie.

[22:59] You know i'm saying like I we you're you're you're asking the player to you're in you're constantly asking them to jump out of where you where the focus should be so it becomes this skits of frantic journey that is just not fun I don't know any other way to say it this game is incredibly fun to shoot and it is incredibly frustrating to experience the code and so when I walked away after an hour I said.

[23:29] That wasn't fun like it was fun when I got to the end moments that mattered but the journey to get there not fun.

[23:39] Not fun everything's just happening at once now if you think it's just me saying this what I want to do now is I want to play for you a conversation about this game for a few minutes we're just going to watch it.

[23:55] Where I think this is exactly how I feel and I think Travis you'll hear him is is like aligned exactly with what my fears are about this game and what I think about the game it's not early code.

[24:13] I think people need to stop saying it's early this is not early code there is so much in there it's how they've laid the foundation for the code they're not going to like see I'm saying this game doesn't need more it needs less.

[24:31] So when people say it's early code I again I think you guys are in for a world of disappointment if Jersey Jack keeps plowing the software software in the direction they're going in okay.

[24:44] I want to play this for you.

[24:47] And we're just going to watch this because these guys nail it and what what what Joel says about taking the glass off is embarrassing I almost feel bad for him but you know he said it I didn't.

[25:03] A lot of conversations with people it's us talking about the different parts of.

[25:09] Harry Potter and this is what happens with so much is in the game I think we take we take it for granted of what people actually see in the game that's what we talk about how the first 10 minutes are so important because that's what everybody's going to see right even the first five minutes even the first three minutes and that's why I've told you guys like my non negotiable.

[25:30] Yeah especially high end themes for rules is what I've told you this Joel constable what is what is it what is it.

[25:38] Don't put a mode start on a scoop or put a mode start on a hard shot like you want a mode start to be selectable and if anything when is that mode need start yes at 100% it needs to start.

[25:49] So much so question for you go ahead.

[25:52] Why is Godzilla so popular when you have to hit two ramps and then a scoop that's easy because Godzilla was not a huge IP at the beginning I'm talking about IP's the very beginning that you know are going to sell gangbusters that you know is so unique that it's going to go.

[26:11] Godzilla didn't do that because it was Godzilla Godzilla was a slow seller like first week a lot of people forget that we were all talking about how the playfield art was and all that and Joel and I even had a podcast about it live that I was like I think this is going to be the sleeper like number one yeah I'm looking at it I can see how it's going to develop so a lot of that we're talking about like two different things I think the design in the rules and what Godzilla is pulled it not the theme now Harry Potter.

[26:41] I agree with that that theme is going to lead it it's going to get people like Joel's wife to come up and want to play it yeah it's going to get a lot of people to want to play it and get a problem is that means you're going to introduce so many people that haven't played pinball consistently have never played pinball and if they step up to Harry Potter and they're not even in a movie yet and they have no idea how to start a movie like you lost you lost the hook you've lost let's talk about everything is have have that movie mode start.

[27:11] At the plunge at the bout oh yeah.

[27:14] A thousand.

[27:15] So by your selector movie mode.

[27:17] Yeah everybody's going to have their opinions and we talk like Tom and I talked about this before that we always create something in our minds and so

[27:24] it's always better in our minds besides the actual reality that's just creativity right there but if I was in the room there at J.J.

[27:30] P. and we're going over the rules and somebody said we're going to start the movies at the scoop that's on the right hand side that's already a difficult shot for even experienced world class players

[27:40] and I promise you it is it can disappear or a lot of people even people that are world champions or people are taught 50 true how how is a casual going to handle that and now we are automatically putting up a barrier unnecessarily in front of the meat and potatoes of a game to get people into the experience

[27:59] immediately like if I have a game and I want people to experience that world I want to thrust them into that world otherwise it's like writing a roller coaster and not getting to your first drop until like five minutes of just like

[28:13] going around like I'm waiting I'm still going like

[28:17] or a listen to a podcast so listening to a podcast and not getting to the actual meat of the podcast till five minutes in right you know you're

[28:24] just playing it's all about hooks we sure know everything's about hooks you got to hook a player in you got to give him a reason to keep playing and simplest way if somebody's playing Harry Potter I play here I have I have a lot of thoughts on that I was going to one side comment was

[28:42] Tom it asks why is why is Godzilla because we've we've talked before that unfortunately the scoop you have to get to get my impromptu you have to do scoop I'm scoop is so hard to hit on Godzilla for casual players that a lot of them don't experience battle but I remember asking my dad who played Godzilla I was like why did you

[28:58] enjoy that so much he goes well I didn't know what I was doing but every shot I was hitting maybe feel like I was accomplishing something they've designed it well there's other stuff going on he could

[29:37] stream on Wednesday night yeah how did Jared feel like honestly honestly that's what he said he goes he goes that's a good game he goes I enjoyed that game I look forward to playing that game more that's a good game he goes there's

[29:51] just so much you know Joel said there's so much going on you do you do you don't quite understand what's going on coming and that led us to a very interesting conversation about I mean long story short I said if I had to buy a game right now would you rather me buy Kong Harry Potter or Evil Dead

[30:06] and he without hesitation said evil dead like evil dead really he loved evil dead and that because I think you've let it away game Max and moments very well that's then that's what he enjoys in pinball is makes and moments so Harry Potter here we go I agree everything you said Travis I

[30:24] completely agree because that was the frustration I had on my first few games was if you're playing Harry Potter you want to see the movie I don't

[30:34] want to sit there and watch it I'm not going don't don't don't miss can see what I'm saying here I don't want to sit there and watch the movie I know a lot of people are

[30:41] been up about the sound balancing which is I do agree needs a little bit of work there's a lot of Mark silk like you his call outs are loud and clear the music's great David the old did a great job with the music in the fan fair but there's some audio dipping to you know make Mark

[30:58] so loud and clear but the movie clips are very quiet in the well here's the easiest question ask because you guys all know how I feel about LCDs and all that we don't even have to go over that

[31:08] Joe doesn't like it by the way but yeah but what I'm asking is since you guys have played it you've started a movie you're in the lessons because the way it works is I

[31:18] guess it's lessons for 30 seconds in the time or goes it rotates the next lesson regardless of yeah right regardless of if you

[31:24] completed or not you just get the points for whatever you've done at that point my question is does it feel like you're actually playing that movie do you feel

[31:35] like do you realize what scene of that movie you're playing space and you're going because like if I take it to rush which is Tom's baby that that is very well

[31:46] integrated to where I feel like the most I actually are what they are you know I'll say yes and no and what I mean is when I took

[31:54] the glass off let's go no no let me when I took the glass off taking when I took the glass off and and started throwing the ball around and what that allowed me to do was focus so it's like I

[32:04] wouldn't understand this multi-ball so all I did I never started a movie I didn't I just I just had the multi-ball so only the multi-ball is being displayed it's very

[32:13] easy to see what you're saying so if you're only playing a movie and you can and only the movie shots are lit yes they actually did a

[32:21] decent job of like oh this movie is with Ron so the wrong targets are lit Joe you're you're saying that in order to

[32:27] understand what's going on you have to have the glass off that's why I know I think the modes themselves they just like I that's

[32:36] something I think Simpson's does well where the modes you know Homer's day you're hitting the areas of the play field that are

[32:42] Homer's day right that mode immersive I think there are modes in Harry Potter as in the the lessons that if you can focus on

[32:51] just the lit shots they do correspond to what's going on in the scene well yeah well of course they will but it's about the

[32:58] totality of the package not the individuality of everything because if you take the glass off of course you can

[33:05] isolate anything yeah nobody's going to go on location and say hey hey if glass off I want to experience this

[33:11] right now like you know what I mean lesson going and then start a quidditch match so that's the the snitch is

[33:19] writing as flying all over the screen right and then accidentally start a multi-ball and then while you're doing that hit a

[33:27] death-eater shot and you got all that going all over each other yeah at that point you have no idea how

[33:33] the whole thing lit but then you have to teach yourself okay red and red and gold colors for that this is for this

[33:38] oh this is for this right but yes it's you're not experiencing a moment at that point you're experiencing all of it

[33:45] you're experiencing skittles throwing in your face you're going to get all of it I mean it's it's fine and here's why it's fine okay some some parts

[33:53] okay some parts is not Tom will fully understand this because we have to do this all the time and tournament play

[33:59] when we try to stack things together and get the perfect stack yeah it's natural and pinball to have overlap of certain

[34:06] features going but at some point you do have to have certain features that are priority right right and so that's the

[34:13] main thing is that you you're gonna always have background stuff like side features that's what makes the game very

[34:19] accessible but if everything tries to be like the number one that's when it gets like super confusing and this isn't just a

[34:28] J.J.P. I've seen this across every manufacturer yeah it's not just like this isn't just picking on J.J.P.

[34:33] it is that's what happens that's what makes it overwhelming even in King Kong if you if you're in the middle of a

[34:38] scene a movie scene and then you start King Kong multiple you're gonna have those two things overlap the colors

[34:43] overlap but that should so you see what I mean everybody we're all coming to the same conclusion a confusing game

[34:54] everything is on top of each other layered in a way that's not fun and it's it doesn't work it doesn't

[35:05] make you walk away feeling satisfied and this is this is the game right until they do a major code update

[35:15] until they fix I don't know how you fix it now though I don't know how you fix it now they would really have

[35:23] to go back and rework a lot of what's on the screen the UI they would have to you know I guess they

[35:33] could just turn off all that side stuff when you're in a movie and elevate the movie sounds like you

[35:39] know you'd still see them in the middle you know like it's a shame that they had they had this big 27

[35:45] inch screen and they very rare like whenever you're in a movie you're not seeing the full screen

[35:54] image of those movie scenes it's only when you lock a ball do you get the full screen of something

[36:01] happening so silly Jersey Jack you had 4k Harry Potter movie footage and you decided to reduce it

[36:12] down to a 10 inch middle of the screen surrounded by seven other things happening you like that was a

[36:19] mistake so I am I want to kind of read what you guys are writing now and and and and comment on

[36:29] your thoughts and then I want to talk about how I think kind of King Kong is unfairly getting

[36:35] thrown under the bus but I'll tell you what my thoughts on Kong um this is one of the most

[36:42] informative and research shows you've put together um thank you um Sean I look I I really feel

[36:51] so after playing the game and thinking about it it it allows me to talk in a lot more uh educated way

[37:00] about the about the game right I mean I would look I wish I had access to every game as much as

[37:05] everybody else you know we're not just we're not bitching about price right isn't it fun every once

[37:10] in a while we're not just complaining about price now that being said um I wouldn't go anywhere

[37:14] near the $15,000 version of this game when you can get the same exact game for 10 because you're

[37:19] just not going to notice like much happening on the CE package um but yeah I think this game is

[37:27] going to be in the short term a very very um beautiful game I think people are going to have fun

[37:35] to shoot it but after you kind of get into it you're going to really wish it was completely

[37:44] executed differently you're going to wish the great gameplay was complemented by beautiful code

[37:51] that immersed you in the films you love you're you're just going to wish for that and you're never

[37:56] going to get it you might get it one day but you're not getting it right now and you're not going

[38:01] to get it early on I don't think we need to be invalidating any opinions um look gang like look

[38:14] I think you guys know how to code I think you know how to like let people play the thing they want

[38:19] I think you did it with Scooby-Doo I think you've done it with evil dead I think you did it with

[38:23] Halloween I think you did it with like ultimate like I think you guys understand the concepts of like

[38:28] when people buy a theme they want to feel like they're playing that theme and they're getting what they

[38:33] want George said got my evil dead yesterday it's crazy good yeah no it's great um

[38:41] you know I I also you know it's so it's so I want to say this and I mean this and I'm coming from a place

[38:54] of caring about this hobby I think Jersey Jack Pimball is incapable of listening to feedback

[39:06] and and by that I mean they just need new blood in that company they keep making the same bone

[39:12] head at mistakes they keep putting the same team on the field and you know what it is is because

[39:18] they look they they sell they sell games to people that love them and I think they only want to hear

[39:26] the feedback from those people and I just think that if they had brought in Travis or me and we

[39:34] banged on this game for like an hour like six months ago we would have given them the same feedback

[39:41] we're giving them now and what worries me about Jersey Jack Pimball is after 14 years of being in

[39:47] business the fact that they need feedback like this shows me they don't get it they don't get what

[39:56] fun is they I just I mean that they don't get they don't get it they don't get it I actually you

[40:02] know and when I when I hear the interviews of Eric and Joe so Eric directed it this way too like

[40:08] this was under Eric's guidance to make the game this way I just think they don't get it I they just

[40:15] don't get it what they do got what they did get right they really got it right but what they got

[40:22] wrong on this game they really got it wrong and on a theme this big they should have nailed it you

[40:29] know I was talking to George Gomez today as like George I just want to say thank you

[40:34] for how you handled Lord of the Rings and that was a Keith Johnson game but I just want to say thank

[40:38] you like you made you took an iconic film trilogy and you you nailed it and as like George you know

[40:46] I'm playing Harry Potter like like they took these eight movies and they just like they just

[40:50] nerfed nerfed it like in terms of feeling anything so like I just don't think Jersey Jack like I

[40:58] don't even think they care and you know and like and the Potter fanboys you know who you are you've

[41:03] ordered one you're like you don't want to hear this you think it's negative this is not us

[41:09] slandering I'm rooting for this game I want this game to be the masterpiece it can be it still can

[41:15] be saved but what if I'm Jersey Jack I'm I'm I'm hitting up Travis I'm hitting up Canada I'm hitting

[41:24] up you know for other people guys look we you didn't play test this game with anybody you know

[41:34] and that's terrifying it's like they might have played tested it mechanically to make sure the game

[41:39] doesn't break down but they clearly did not play test this game with anybody like us and when I say

[41:47] like us I just mean like the normal pinball playing community and so when you don't play tested and

[41:53] you build it in a vacuum and you've got you know millions of dollars invested in this IP

[42:00] what what the heck were you doing you know you could have saved yourselves and look and the things

[42:06] we would suggest would have saved them so much energy because you don't need all this other

[42:11] stuff happening you literally have access to everything people want just serve it back to them

[42:16] in the right way why do you need all this other stuff happening because you realize what Eric did

[42:23] is like he put these elements in the game and then he made the whole game about interacting with

[42:28] those elements versus focusing on feeling amazingly good about going through the movies you love

[42:37] he he made it all about the elements on the play field taking center stage not the storyline

[42:45] of Harry's journey to defeat Voldemort I mean think about like Voldemort's not even on the

[42:51] play field guys the death eater is how do you not have Voldemort it's like it's like not having

[42:58] Darth Vader on you know as the bad guy isn't the death eater like even like it isn't that a good

[43:05] character you know like I don't get it I don't get it I don't get it

[43:10] you're the guy who only owns guns and roses yeah guns and roses is a better machine than Harry

[43:22] Potter right now and I'll explain why and I know this made some people upset yesterday and I

[43:28] took it down because a friend asked me to and I won't explain why guns and roses what it does do

[43:37] good it what it does do well it does better than anything Harry Potter does well

[43:42] so Harry Potter shoots way better than guns and roses no argument there you will never see

[43:47] can he had to say oh yeah like guns and roses shoots well no I crap on the guns and roses

[43:52] gameplay every chance I get I also hate the brutal outland drains and GnR but when guns and roses

[44:01] when it what it does well when it when it hits you with a song and it's on volume 40 and I've

[44:07] got pinwoofer speakers and you have a couple whiskies in you guns and roses is so much more impactful

[44:15] and hits you so much harder and and puts a smile on your face way bigger than you're going to get

[44:24] with where Potter is currently I don't like again it's because of the experience

[44:31] right it's clunky it's not the best shooter but man sometimes when you when you got it going and it's going

[44:41] and look music pins are easier it's way easier to make a good music pin than a good Harry Potter pin

[44:48] a good music pin really just like you know just play the music back in an interesting way

[44:53] and it'll it'll it'll you know it's it's hard to fail at being a music pin

[44:58] it's really easy to fail at being a Harry Potter eight movies trying to get it all into one game right

[45:08] Don what's up buddy still being a grumpy weirdo Don why are you so negative man

[45:13] Don we're all having a good conversation here I'm friends with jengas again you you come in here

[45:19] and call me a weirdo that's really strange man I just don't you know what happy fathers day tomorrow

[45:26] I wish you the best but I really wish you would just accept the apology I've given you multiple times

[45:35] and can we just bury the hatchet right now now that you're here what's what's holding you up at this

[45:41] stage Don like what like I've said I'm sorry we should just bury the hatchet we're too grown adults

[45:48] and you come into my show and call me a grumpy weirdo to me that's strange man because I don't

[45:55] I don't interfere with any of your shows I don't go to your page and say negative stuff

[46:01] so just just it's it's it's in your court man and that's all I'm going to say but like really

[46:09] really don't appreciate you doing that I don't I don't think it makes much sense

[46:14] um but yeah what's up jengas what's up jengas you know you know jengas you know you know who

[46:22] your your your boy is I know you guys look I'm I I'm happy you guys are making your content

[46:28] it's it's it's it's the way it should be everybody do your thing but you know just don't come

[46:32] into my house and call me a weirdo man it's just not it's not cool it's not cool um look

[46:39] everybody this is the thing it's like when Don comes in here and says I'm being a grumpy weirdo

[46:45] it's this desire to shut down a conversation about this game I think we've been having a really

[46:51] good conversation about this game Don and the only way this game is going to get better Don

[46:56] is if we give this kind of constructive feedback I probably have played Potter as much if not

[47:04] more than you I don't know how much you've played it but I don't think anything we just talked about

[47:08] I don't think I'm wrong I don't think Travis is wrong and Joel is wrong so we're all grumpy weirdos

[47:14] sorry man you know and the thing is this bro it's like this is your Saturday morning

[47:21] I I don't wake up and go engage with you if I think you're a weirdo and I don't like you so

[47:29] to spend your time and this is like this triggers me to spend your time

[47:34] coming into and you're doing it in front of all these people and they're all gonna see it and

[47:38] and again it's just like it's now in your court bro to be like look let's just bury it right now

[47:43] hatch a buried we're cool right that's fine I you know life's too short bro life's too short I'm here

[47:50] I'm here to celebrate the birthday of a nine-year-old woman who's amazing here she's doing like

[47:57] um she's taking edibles now at like it's it's it's good it's good to be a fun party anyway

[48:05] it's it's it's fine it's fine you know I don't I don't you know I'm happy to be the grumpy weirdo

[48:11] that you guys um subscribe to and you guys listen to every week I think this is um you know

[48:17] this is gonna be a good thing so look the the potter fixes they are doable they they are doable

[48:26] it's gonna take a while and so my here's what I encourage each and every one of you to do

[48:32] I encourage each and every one of you to go play the game and I think the real the real exciting

[48:38] thing now in pinball is every single one of these new games king Kong Harry Potter

[48:45] dune right the last three launches you can go play them before you need to order them none of

[48:54] these games will be hard to get none and I've been covering this hobby for 12 years now and I've

[49:01] never seen a moment in pinball where every new game that's come out this year has zero

[49:09] phonetic that you don't have to order it you didn't even have to order evil debt like you could

[49:14] play these games and I've always encouraged everybody to play the games make up your mind know you

[49:23] really want the games and and then make your decision right I mean not look all I want is you

[49:29] guys to buy games that make you happy it means a toy it's a toy right so buy the toy that makes it

[49:35] happy and so you can go play you can miss me Frank if Frank isn't house Frank you're not getting

[49:42] the CE here's the thing I also gang the there's no way to justify Harry Potter CE at 15 when you

[49:50] can get the same exact game for 10 a I absolutely I don't think the CE is nice enough I don't think

[49:58] that the top is just I didn't even talk about it bros but like dudes the top is so bad

[50:05] in Harry Potter like even like Frank and I were like looking at it like how did they even end up

[50:10] with this thing it is that bad we we were looking about the you know how good the top is on

[50:16] Elton John and pirates and the other games what what like I've never seen and this is again this

[50:23] is this is why Jersey Jack worries me because how did they like green light the damn top

[50:31] how did they as an organization like no but you know I don't know why Ken Cromwell left but I

[50:38] I I would love it and I'm just making this up Ken and Ken and I were talking I wish him the best

[50:42] I can't wait to have a beer with Ken Ken has always been a class act a great guy you know I said

[50:48] this to Ken you've always treated me with so much respect and dignity even when I didn't deserve it

[50:53] even when I was like you know saying disparaging things about Jersey Jack Ken was the first one

[50:59] to invite me into the company right Ken great guy I didn't get the same love from from Mr.

[51:05] Sharp over at Stern he didn't he decided not to invite me and what we're going to talk about

[51:09] Stern sending a D&D to a PC reviewer guy we're going to talk about that in a little bit how

[51:16] stupid that is but again like yeah we'll talk about it anyway but Ken I would love it if Ken was like

[51:23] you know I saw the topper and they and I they didn't listen to me and that's why I left because I'm

[51:31] just tired of list like being at a place it doesn't take my ideas they just ignore what I'm saying

[51:37] and I like you know what I'm saying like it would just be amazing if that topper made him rage quit

[51:43] J.J.P. which I again I'm just making this up this is just for entertainment don't go texting Ken

[51:48] canator said you quit because of the topper um but it's terrible it's terrible

[51:57] I didn't read the whole chat the don the don accept my apology or did he just come in here call me a grumpy

[52:02] weirdo and then did he did he leave did he okay I think he just left

[52:08] J.J.P. is work on your boy work on your boy you know it's cool it's all good

[52:14] life is too short to hold on to a pinball grudge you know speaking of pinball grudge is now

[52:19] you know who's like like really just call in again like I just you know he said some real

[52:25] nasty stuff about me when when when Ken left someone wrote something like oh now the marketing

[52:30] positions open at J.J.P. canator should take it and he's like that would be the worst thing or

[52:34] and just start slamming me like like bro I don't know what's up man and I think a lot of it comes

[52:40] because you know I when he tried to clickbait everybody with his JK Rowling trans clickbait story

[52:48] like he was you know and then again once again he's like oh you know he's just always trying to like

[52:54] I just I just something about Colin man like I try I try with that guy

[52:59] So he was praising Stern he called it a great PR move okay I work in PR a great PR move

[53:07] for Stern pinball a big win to send that PC gamer guy of free dungeons and dragons game

[53:14] okay and the guy has like I think a million followers and got like a hundred thousand views on

[53:20] the and then he already says he's like this this video alone got more views than all the Harry Potter

[53:26] pinball content combined and that's a big win for Stern and so the reason why Colin doesn't work in

[53:34] marketing anymore and is making all of his living with a pinball website that can't even be cracking

[53:39] six figures a year the reason why Colin doesn't work in marketing anymore is Colin doesn't understand

[53:44] the concept in marketing of reach versus impact that it's more important to do a move that has

[53:54] impact on your business and impacts your audience versus just reach and so what Stern pinball

[54:03] did with that move was they reached a lot of people and they gave the game to a guy who has no

[54:09] idea about pinball didn't look what he was like a complete newbie and that kind of video won't

[54:17] sell you one more game and instead of you know whereas Jersey Jack hit all the pinball people with

[54:27] much more impact and sold a lot more games so like I don't and I think Stern's strategy now

[54:34] and you could see it like they've expanded they've expanded their net of who talks about their

[54:40] product but they're abandoning you know in some ways the people that have more impact for them

[54:47] so I'm look I'm just gonna say this I would impact sales more for Stern than that guy and I mean that

[54:56] my one to three thousand people that absorb my content on a weekly basis and it's you know

[55:03] it's I'm just taking into account my podcast plus this plus Facebook lives the the three thousand

[55:09] people I reach will have more of a sales impact on Stern and its games than the hundred thousand

[55:17] people watching that guy can in a confusing way try to set up a pinball machine

[55:22] and yet they give him a free game they gave him a free game

[55:33] somebody else got a free game too recently not gonna name names but here's the thing here's the

[55:37] thing and I mean this if you get free product from a company you're supposed to disclose it so

[55:42] that when you start doing reviews everybody knows you got it for free like is that gonna change

[55:49] I don't want a free game I don't want a free game I'll buy my own game you know carry hardy bought

[55:54] his own King Kong Ali with his patreon money he bought his own game that's how you you know

[55:59] you don't want to take a free game from a manufacturer if you're in a space like ours where you

[56:05] want to objectively review the game Don and Colin hate you buddy I know that yeah it's fine I mean

[56:14] look they can never hate me as much as I hate myself but I'm joking here guys like literally

[56:19] I love myself John how you doing brother better to have a small impact amongst people

[56:24] who never bought pins than a huge impact with those who already do

[56:34] no John that doesn't make any sense John that John that's not how you grow pinball

[56:40] John that that's been the stern model now and it's not working out for them

[56:45] it's not working out for them there are very few people that will wake up on planet earth

[56:50] and write a check for seven to fifteen thousand dollars for a pinball machine

[56:54] I can tell you I live in a town where people have twenty million dollar homes I live in a town where

[56:59] every car that pulls up to the restaurants a hundred thousand dollars or more the moment I start

[57:04] talking about pinball they all stop talking to me nobody wants to hear it nobody nobody

[57:09] nobody cares nobody cares hey guys Harry Potter pinball nobody nope nope nope nobody cares

[57:18] we care and the best way to get another person into the hobby is if each of us invites a friend

[57:27] but you know it's it's it's it's it's it's fine okay so Kong Ellie Kong in general

[57:42] I think King Kong is getting a little bit of an unfair go I think every time I talk to people

[57:51] about Harry Potter the first thing they say is King Kong sucks they're like oh Stern's in trouble

[57:56] King Kong look at this game you know and then I go over and I play King Kong I'm like wait a minute

[58:00] why are people like in writing this game saying Harry Potter is loaded and King Kong sucks and then

[58:05] I play King Kong and I'm like oh there's a lot more interesting Mexican King Kong

[58:11] there's like an easier storyline to follow I can read the inserts which I can't on Harry Potter

[58:19] and it it the Stern has one mistake

[58:24] Stern just has one big mistake they just don't make a 13,000 dollar product and if I could give

[58:37] Seth and George just just they had it that that's their problem is I should walk up to King Kong Ellie

[58:47] and it should be $10,500 and Harry Potter's the should be $15,000 and I should see why

[58:55] Stern is the greatest option in the best bang for the buck once Stern took all of its products so

[59:02] upmarket you can't help but look at it and just not see something worth that much money they

[59:12] legitimately they lived in a little bubble during COVID and when demand was through the roof and

[59:19] supply was nonexistent they now price themselves on everything in a time that's gone it's been

[59:29] gone now for four years and so yeah if I'm looking at Harry Potter next to King Kong and you're

[59:37] telling me like this is 13 this is 50 it's just it's just I I don't even care how much better

[59:44] King Kong is I just don't want to buy something that looks so much cheaper and I just think that's

[59:52] their issue also I don't know if you've noticed this the clear coat on a Stern game now it's bad

[01:00:02] it's not glossy like it used to be I think they like are trying to avoid dimples and by the way

[01:00:08] Harry Potter dimples like crazy but it just feels shinier it feels glossier it feels more premium

[01:00:17] Stern play feels lately just feel like dull like they're just coming across as like a dull looking

[01:00:23] game and I think they need to fix that too but yeah I mean King Kong is is is clearly not selling

[01:00:33] like they thought of what first of all I want to thank that we have 166 people right now which is

[01:00:38] pretty good for my Saturday morning lives I think we got another 20 people join you know once you

[01:00:44] start talking about other content creators I just want to give a shout out to everybody for being

[01:00:50] here I want to thank you guys for joining this grumpy weirdo every Saturday morning thank you Don

[01:00:57] I'm going to start using that as as my new descriptor I want to thank you for hanging out because

[01:01:02] you're taking time out of your life to hang out here talk pinball genome brother we have people

[01:01:09] here in Australia in Europe in America in Canada probably lad in America you know it's it's so

[01:01:17] amazing to me what a community has has you know gotten together to join myself every week and talk

[01:01:26] about pinball and it's and and again as people continue to try to like paint me as this thing look

[01:01:33] yeah there are times when I say stuff that's stride in there's times I might come at some people

[01:01:38] but never never never like just like if if they didn't deserve it a little bit and they know that

[01:01:45] and and also like these companies deserve to hear it from us they do and that's always been the

[01:01:49] thing about canators pinball podcasts is like I love what these companies create and sometimes I

[01:01:55] love the decisions they make and that's what makes this hobby fun right if every game was just like

[01:02:00] perfect way huh yeah okay on that you know but they're not like and they're so far from it but we're

[01:02:06] getting there we're getting there um and I want to thank everybody who subscribes the canators

[01:02:11] pinball podcasts uh we've been below 700 for a while but the numbers are still really good

[01:03:38] banter every day Ralph tries to like earnestly like get to like change my mind or like can't quite get

[01:03:46] me yet like he doesn't quite get it yet and then when he does get it it like annoys him he's like

[01:03:51] you're doing it for entertainment you're not even playing the game and you're slamming this company

[01:03:55] and I got to go there and film a featurette like it's like Ralph like chill bro chill you like I'm not a

[01:04:00] shill I'm not a shill I'm not a shill the avatar is the best game ever see even that like I'm joking

[01:04:07] right he's gonna why oh man you call I'm not a shill man I'm not a shill X-Men O Lee is incredible

[01:04:15] I'm not a shill I'm I you know it looked it's like and that's the thing is you've got to be able to

[01:04:21] laugh at yourself and I don't I don't I think the the shill like that many leaned into it

[01:04:29] he leaned into it because he knew he was shilling games it's a distributor like he leaned into it

[01:04:34] and I know when you find yourself in that unfortunate situation where you just like everything

[01:04:39] about pinball yeah like it's like you're gonna get called the shill and it's fine just lean into it

[01:04:52] ah how's everybody doing? Avatar is terrible it's terrible it's it's it's it's it's I mean like it's not

[01:05:00] it's just it's just another soulless game you it's just you just like you know it's like

[01:05:08] as I was saying earlier like if we if life is short and we measure our life and how we spend our time

[01:05:13] you're gonna have a lot more time 90 minutes of canada's Saturday morning spectacular this will

[01:05:19] this will be more entertaining than any 90 minute game on an avatar and this cost you how much money

[01:05:27] exactly no one even gave me any money or super chats I don't care like whatever you know what I'm saying

[01:05:33] you know carry gets icy carry giving money people give carry money all the time to be a super

[01:05:38] chat no it's fine it's fine I'm not busking I'm not busking today people I'm too happy

[01:05:43] he's a paid spokesperson so he's gonna shill if anyone understands it's a paid promo I'm fine

[01:05:49] with it Scotty Pimble yeah no I don't care I don't care you're just supposed to disclose if

[01:05:56] you're paid or not you're you're you're you're supposed to make that disclosure and you're also

[01:06:00] supposed to disclose you know the terms of some of those deals but you know no one ever does it's

[01:06:06] like this the the for years we've been joking there's no real journalism in Pimble and there's

[01:06:12] other than Jason that and Jason that like he's the only guy and like what the the thing I love

[01:06:19] about Jason as you can you know you remember when Jason started it was like it was just the news

[01:06:25] you know then a little bit you know then he started to give his opinion a little bit more then he

[01:06:28] went full Canadian was like rumors man rumors I love it he he where you got to go remember the origins

[01:06:34] of nap he didn't really want to do rumors or spoil company is news and you know now it's great

[01:06:42] like I love his site everybody does you know you know I was selling this to Cal can you imagine

[01:06:49] you know we talk about like newbies coming into Pimble can you imagine how much exponentially

[01:06:55] better a grown man's life is before he joins Pinside like let me let me just repeat that a man's life

[01:07:06] is exponentially better every year of his life before he joins Pinside the moment he joins Pinside

[01:07:16] is a bad moment for his life you know you you understand this right it's like you had it bro

[01:07:23] you had peace of mind you had the ability to enjoy Pimble machines without listening to a bunch of

[01:07:28] alcoholics argue with each other all day long without listening to Iceman and Neil battle it out like

[01:07:35] who's got more money who which means who's opinion matters more and it's like the most ridiculous

[01:07:41] place to end up and the reason why I love naps arcade is you don't have to end up there ever again

[01:07:48] yeah you maybe pop in for the for the club thread but even that's kind of nauseating it's like

[01:07:54] all these buyers justifying their purchase before they've even played the game I

[01:07:58] and this is where my Harry Potter is gonna go I love the Harry Potter club thread right now you

[01:08:02] got to do this with like owls on their walls like this is where my Harry Potter is gonna go and I'm

[01:08:06] like oh man is it too late to get a refund because that game if you're a Harry Potter fanatic I don't

[01:08:14] know man get ready strap in let's talk predator all right so jeng is is here and jeng is and I have

[01:08:21] been going back and forth because you know he's he's getting he's not he's not hearing my show

[01:08:30] so when I say when I say that Bill Billy Boying Brand is in the house Billy welcome to the show

[01:08:38] dude you have gummy bears on your wall what does that mean Billy see Bill Bill order two

[01:08:44] Harry Potter's already one for each of his home and he could order 50 and not even feel it and you

[01:08:53] know you know Bill come on it's Bill I get it I get it Bill the thing is you're in a

[01:08:58] suburnal realm unlike most people so like it doesn't matter to you right and I know you have fun

[01:09:08] I know this is all like you know you're you're part of the community um but you are very jaded

[01:09:15] on the side of jgp around this game like so Bill do you think I'm wrong on how they're coding this

[01:09:22] game it's that is that simple you were just knocking Bill Bill I'm having fun you know I'm not like

[01:09:34] literally making fun of people that have owls on their walls because Harry Potter's gonna go

[01:09:38] underneath it yeah like yeah I was making fun of that person Bill I was making fun of a Harry

[01:09:44] Potter fan what happened to all of us girly men we need to get to the chop I mean let's talk about

[01:09:51] like it's so funny to me the sensitivities you up you can't make fun of someone having a

[01:09:56] Harry Potter owl on their wall canada get to the chop up Billy come on Bill let's do this you

[01:10:04] are always wrong you're Bill I'm always wrong so Bill who's more wrong me or you hanging out here

[01:10:10] I got you I got you and guess what I don't do I don't go watch people make content every week

[01:10:17] who are wrong so clearly something I'm saying is right Bill if I was wrong Billy boy

[01:10:24] why would I have so many subscribers why everybody's just like they all just want to tune into

[01:10:29] like someone who's just wrong about pinball come on Bill we love you you're loaded it doesn't matter

[01:10:37] we love you okay but you're you're you're not gonna have a pie to the Caribbean experience with

[01:10:43] your Harry Potter okay just accept it okay I plead it with you to join I just asked you to

[01:10:50] join today Bill it wasn't I wasn't begging you don't worry don't worry Bill I know I know I know

[01:10:58] no I'm glad you're here Bill I'm glad you're here so predator is coming out this week

[01:11:05] and so back to the jangus so jangus has been the one with all the he has the keys to the castle like

[01:11:10] he's been teasing and leaking this game slowly clearly he's on board with the pinball brothers

[01:11:17] this is their strategy and and I've said it before you know they didn't give anybody else any assets

[01:11:22] they people with much larger reaches but it's fine it's cool like I they can do what they want to do

[01:11:31] and when I said I'm sick of the slow tease of this game he was like just block me and I'm like bro

[01:11:37] I mean it's not you I'm mad at it's the pinball brothers they this this whole game is like just

[01:11:45] show the game already there's only so much of these little teasers and every time we see a new tease

[01:11:54] it's like we get less excited about the game and so that helicopter is horrible how is that

[01:12:05] the major mech in the like I don't I don't think it's the major mech in the game but how is

[01:12:09] there a better helicopter in abba then in predator how I I mean I just don't get it

[01:12:21] but we're gonna see it this week you know wide body pinball brothers game I don't know I don't

[01:12:27] know why why I don't know maybe there's a guy bunch of cabinets lying around that aliens didn't

[01:12:32] go into they should have shown predator before Potter came out maybe I don't know I mean I look if

[01:12:42] you ordered a game I wouldn't buy either any new game without playing it first like and because

[01:12:48] you remember these are like non-refundable deposits like the best non-refundable deposit that just

[01:12:54] got refunded it is Tony Homer's you guys know Tony Homer if you don't know Tony Homer he's a gentleman

[01:13:02] that ordered two Alice's adventures in Wonderland has been moaning about not having them yet

[01:13:09] and I love it after just being a troll in the Alice thread for months both distros are like we're

[01:13:18] just giving you your money back get out of here they don't want them I don't want you know you're

[01:13:21] not worth it you're not worth the headache he's been threatening to do a credit card chargeback so

[01:13:27] one distributor won't give him the check until he confirms that he's not doing the credit card

[01:13:33] chargeback I get it because if if they write him a check and then he charges back they they can't

[01:13:40] get that check back and then he might double dip so it's Melissa was the other distro so coin taker

[01:13:48] and the other distro were just like dude get we were done with you and and he really is because in

[01:13:54] like a nightmare for these these these damn distros it's like you were promised a game by the end

[01:13:58] of the year not right now 400 people going to get refunded I look the the the the the toper

[01:14:10] for Alice the company that was making it went out of business so I so like it's like

[01:14:18] yeah right I mean damn like that sucks so Melvin who's now the partner with Leor at little shop of

[01:14:27] or just Leor the art of pinball he has to find a new source for that topper because Leor didn't

[01:14:33] make that topper he would have been even more expensive so I that that's unfortunate I hope they've

[01:14:39] nailed it like one to one like I wouldn't want to I don't know even know how you would go about

[01:14:44] finding another supplier for such a unique item canator was a salesman for that dog Alice then

[01:14:51] just pretended it never existed no I was 100% transparent about Alice I've been completely

[01:15:00] a transparent about my relationship with Melvin the assets carry and I got I I have been very

[01:15:07] critical of Alice's adventures in Wonderland since the moment Dutch couldn't even stream the

[01:15:13] game in good lighting so you know that's it and my whole thing is this it's like you got to see

[01:15:21] the game before you ordered one you know what I'm saying like you all got to see the game if you

[01:15:26] place an order for Alice it's on you you know what I'm saying I I got no kickbacks I have no

[01:15:34] skin in the game

[01:15:43] um

[01:15:50] anything else you guys want to talk about we got 15 more minutes I think this has been a great show

[01:15:55] we got Bill Brandis in the house Christopher Franci your favorite grumpy weirdo

[01:16:02] jengus is in the house I have it about 250 plays an X-Men you know when I was at automated yesterday

[01:16:10] I hate to say this but X-Men is just such a beautiful pen I mean I don't hate to say it I'm happy

[01:16:17] to say it I hate to say it because I want the game to be as amazing as it looks I think it is one

[01:16:24] of the most stunning sternum machines of all time it it nails world under glass like nothing else

[01:16:31] and it's such a unique layout I love what yet he did with the art I'm just so sad in that like

[01:16:38] you know we're we might never get you know it's much like Potter like both of those games

[01:16:47] we think about this X-Men and Potter like both incredible shooters potentially spoiled by

[01:16:55] by rod and code yeah and look I got I got to be honest both codes are just as annoying

[01:17:05] one one is annoying in it's like just like X-Men's just like uh just you know the potter is just

[01:17:12] annoying because it's just so confusing and just so frustrating how you can't focus on anything

[01:17:17] it's like trying to eat a hamburger and to someone shoving five other food items in your mouth

[01:17:22] at the same time asking how's the hamburger

[01:17:34] major update coming in July how do you guys you know I just it's weird that I mean Kong just

[01:17:44] seems to be it seems to be a gain that everyone's just sort of moving past pretty quickly and

[01:17:52] we we might get jaws 60th this week and then sorry jaws 50th and then um you know John Borg

[01:18:04] Star Wars episode one through three yeah I know I've been using Lyman as an example of like

[01:18:12] the reason why Lyman was the greatest code or in the history of pinball is his understanding of

[01:18:17] how to make a game where casual players will experience magic and experience players will

[01:18:27] get even more magic and the way you journey through a Lyman sheets game is just pure genius and

[01:18:35] there will never be another pinball coder that I think kind of understands from both a player's

[01:18:41] perspective and an emotional perspective what a pinball machine can do I think he was the the

[01:18:50] best I just understanding what fun and what rewarding moments in pinball can be if you take the

[01:18:59] player along on a journey like this you know I just I just have nothing nothing but fun

[01:19:06] thoughts of him personally too and but also just professionally he was just the best

[01:19:11] um Bill Brand is just didn't like Kong at all just feels so cheap

[01:19:18] yeah Bill you know I talked about this um you know having there literally is a Kong next to Harry

[01:19:23] Potter at at automated and it is just it's so glaringly cheaper everything about it just feels

[01:19:33] subpar next to it next to Jersey Jack and it's a problem for Stern it's a problem like it's like

[01:19:41] if you see King Kong on its own a lot easier to warm up to it but if you see it next to Harry Potter

[01:19:48] it's just worlds apart you know it's worlds apart

[01:19:55] but Jersey Jack games have always been beautiful and we it's not the beauty we want we want the

[01:20:01] substance that keeps us coming back from more in these games

[01:20:04] I think King Kong did not move units like Stern needed it too and I mean the LEDs are still not sold out

[01:20:18] you know what game we haven't talked about and I just don't see people I are people even

[01:20:22] unboxing this game like where's doom where's the where's the where's the where's the conversation

[01:20:31] around Dune I haven't spoken to David in a few weeks but I just kind of I'm just kind of

[01:20:40] observing the community like how many pages I'm gonna go to the pins I right now like the

[01:20:46] Dune owners club like is it even like 10 pages long I mean the game's been out now for months

[01:20:53] the Dune hype thread let's see the Dune club thread let's see here we go

[01:21:08] for it's oh my god like I guess it's been out for like what a little over a month

[01:21:21] but the the Dune the Dune club thread is four pages long

[01:21:29] four pages what what like is nobody getting machines if you put up a post right now being like

[01:21:39] canadus canada doesn't like Harry Potter code within an hour there'd be more than four pages on

[01:21:46] pinside yeah I just I just don't know it's I don't think they're really sending out games until they get

[01:21:58] more approvals on the code but yeah I it's just I don't think they should have launched it when they

[01:22:08] did I think they they went out too early the the game wasn't ready and you know you serve people

[01:22:17] cookie dough it's hard to get them to buy the cookies actually cookie dough is really good but you

[01:22:22] know what I mean I can't wait for more people to play Potter you know right now there's just a

[01:22:31] handful of us that have played it and reviewed it and talked about the code I I just can't wait for

[01:22:36] more people to play it and I think when people jump on now they're going to be looking at it

[01:22:42] through the lens of what we've been describing and so I think I think people are going to walk

[01:22:47] over very similar feelings see Bill when you play Potter did you know what you were doing

[01:23:00] it's a bit you know and bills like me like we're not Potter fanatics I think we probably maybe

[01:23:04] seen the movies but did you know what you were doing and like did you feel like I just again like

[01:23:12] I think if JJP can just remove the anointness of stacking everything when you're in a movie it'll

[01:23:18] be much better and that's and like it's like less is more having a more connected feeling to a moment

[01:23:26] is better than everything crashing on top of itself my distro said 80% sells or see yeah man

[01:23:34] everybody's buying the CE it's good news for Jersey Jack you know look because when you watch

[01:23:40] the feature right video how do you not buy the CE like write all that discussion of the art but I'm

[01:23:46] I'm telling you like when you see it all in person I think the wizard addition with the rad cows

[01:23:52] is going to be the most visually stunning version of the game because the artwork on the CE it's

[01:24:00] very muted and dull as I mean just like it's it's because it's mad it doesn't pop like shiny pop

[01:24:07] glossy rad cow so again I think the wizard addition is the way to go because I also just think the

[01:24:15] the top on the CE is terrible like it's terrible it's like it's so frustrating because the

[01:24:20] top is usually like I want one of those and it's like this is like ah that's embarrassing

[01:24:24] there was a moment I saw on the top or like an I think an owl pops out and just looks like a

[01:24:30] a tongue depressor it's like yeah it's like it's like all of a sudden it's like it's just doing this

[01:24:37] it's so cheap looking it's like this flat piece of plastic owl pops out from behind like I'm just

[01:24:43] I can't like whoever designed this thing was trying to sabotage your game

[01:24:55] yeah I do like the gold wire forms but I feel like you won't even notice them when you're

[01:25:01] when you're in the because this game is so fast that's the other thing is like because it's so fast

[01:25:06] you're not really stopping to look at stuff as much I wish the inserts were maybe a little bit

[01:25:15] bigger or there was like a better way to telegraph where to shoot in the game I didn't I did feel

[01:25:20] a little confusion at times like where to shoot again it's simply because like

[01:25:26] everything's lit at once so it just gets a little difficult is that yellow or is that gold

[01:25:32] is that a red shot or is that the red shot you'll see when you play people I'm not making this stuff up

[01:25:41] yeah I mean jaw stacks a lot and but I think you know but but jaws knows when the turn stuff off

[01:25:48] when you get to like the moments that matter and I think that's what they need to do with Potter

[01:25:54] everybody look happy happy Saturday I'm gonna go take a nap I've been up since four o'clock

[01:26:06] though I don't understand like what your issue is with my my gradient gummy bear art like I don't

[01:26:11] understand like you do not you don't understand contemporary pop art like that is like it goes

[01:26:18] perfectly with the color schemes of my house like I don't I don't understand Bill like it's like weird

[01:26:27] art is very subjective and if you walked into my house Bill it looks really good like the whole

[01:26:33] thing is very very artistically pleasing if you will but you know apparently the gummy

[01:26:41] bear artwork is is not to the liking of Mr William Brandis we should change it to the grumpy bear

[01:26:49] art instead of gummy bear art because this is the grumpy weirdo signing off everybody saying enjoy

[01:26:55] your pinball machines play all these new games make up your own mind okay don't let me persuade you

[01:27:04] don't let the shills persuade you Harry Potter in my honest opinion needs a lot of work it's not

[01:27:11] a masterpiece yet it shoots great the code is a complex confusing you know mess right now it's

[01:27:18] it's a schizophrenic game that doesn't know what it wants to be will they fix it I don't know do they

[01:27:23] need to I think so have they gone too far down the road to make major changes I don't know historically

[01:27:30] speaking the answer would be yes that we're you're gonna what you see is more of what you're gonna get

[01:27:36] um I think the hobby overall is very expensive right now I don't think people see most of the value

[01:27:44] anymore and in the other companies all charging 12 13 14 I think everyone is just a little bit

[01:27:49] fatigued the world is a very crazy scary unstable place right now and I think a lot more people are

[01:27:55] gonna be pulling back of course they're gonna sell a ton of Harry Potter's but just play everything

[01:28:00] before you buy it okay that's all I'm asking you to do just get time on it don't lock in your

[01:28:06] money before you play the game don't ask for people's opinions about these games go play them

[01:28:12] and the good news is that nothing is sold out nothing will sell out you will be able to get any

[01:28:18] of these games for years to come and guess what and then they're gonna be a lot cheaper if you

[01:28:24] think Harry Potter CE is gonna hold at 15 in a year a CE will be if the code continues the way

[01:28:31] it's going in a year it will be 12 it will in a year easily and knowing what jack has coming down

[01:28:42] the road again I think I don't know I think this might have been a real challenge in game because of

[01:28:49] the amount that's in it and I think they funneled a little bit figuring out how to get it all into

[01:28:54] the game and I think what they the decision they made to not really make it about a journey of the

[01:28:59] movies but more you know things interacting with these key elements of the of the universe might

[01:29:07] have been a mistake but we we will see this is it's too early to tell that's why I think it's too

[01:29:12] early to buy one more they need to do some work on this game where the first focus group you know

[01:29:18] they didn't bring in playtesters to give them feedback on the code that's us that's now so they're

[01:29:25] getting what they should have got six months ago if they had pulled more people like Travis and Bill

[01:29:30] and me if they pulled people in earlier and how does give them feedback we would have given in this

[01:29:35] feedback so they could have tweaked stuff before releasing it just always concerning to me that

[01:29:40] Jersey Jack seemingly doesn't get some of this stuff it seems very common senseical and they

[01:29:47] continue to make the same I think mistakes time and time again and again because they just don't

[01:29:52] bring in outside feedback I think they they just think they're making the greatest and they don't

[01:29:57] want to hear about it from anybody else I get that vibe a little bit um I think they're making
