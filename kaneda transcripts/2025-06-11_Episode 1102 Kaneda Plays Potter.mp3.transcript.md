[00:00] We're caught in a trap.

[00:04] I can't walk out.

[00:08] Because I love you too much, baby.

[00:17] Alright, I've done it. I've been there. I've played Harry Potter Pinball.

[00:23] I've played a bunch of games over at Automated.

[00:26] I return to you now at the turn of the tide.

[00:29] People can stop complaining that I haven't played the pin.

[00:34] Am I now allowed to have an opinion about Harry Potter Pinball?

[00:38] It was there. It was next to every major release by Jersey Jack and Stern Pinball.

[00:44] The great thing about seeing Harry Potter at Automated, when you see it in a lineup of everything that's come out over the last bunch of years,

[00:53] you appreciate what Jersey Jack has brought to Pinball.

[00:57] I've got a lot of feelings about this game.

[00:59] And I kind of want to walk you through what my experience was walking up to it for the first time.

[01:05] Because right now, all I've seen are streams.

[01:08] I've seen videos on the internet.

[01:10] I've seen all the assets that Jersey Jack has given us.

[01:14] And when I walked up to the machine, it was just there.

[01:16] It was just like, I turn the corner and there it is.

[01:19] The first thing I noticed, like all Jersey Jack machines,

[01:23] they light up a room.

[01:24] It is so bright in a dark playing environment, which is what we had.

[01:29] And it really does just pop out.

[01:32] It is like opening up the Ark of the Covenant.

[01:36] There's just like Godlike glow coming from the machine, which you just never get on any other machine.

[01:43] Something about the Hot Rails and the full RGB LEDs.

[01:48] There's just something about the way Jersey Jack machines light up the box that just nobody else does.

[01:55] And it pulls you in.

[01:56] It really does.

[01:57] And that's going to be a theme that you hear throughout this show.

[02:01] This game's ability to pull you in.

[02:04] And keep in mind, this is just me playing it for like an hour, but it definitely does pull you in.

[02:10] The second thing I noticed when walking up to the machine was how dull looking in person.

[02:18] The CE cabinet artwork is.

[02:20] And I don't mean dull like it's uninteresting, but I was expecting really shiny.

[02:27] You know, having seen so many Jersey Jack CEs in person, I have one in my home right now.

[02:32] I was expecting a much glossier, shinier cabinet.

[02:37] And this artwork, it doesn't come through in any of the photos.

[02:42] It's not like that shiny, rad, cow material that we're all used to.

[02:47] It's very dull and has a matte like finish.

[02:51] Even when you touch it, it's very coarse and has a very, almost like a rough finish to it.

[02:57] And certain elements in the art have more like a smooth foil like texture.

[03:03] I didn't love that.

[03:04] I got to be honest.

[03:05] I was expecting it to pop more.

[03:07] I was expecting it to be more shiny and it is much more subdued.

[03:12] Because I went back and I looked at Elton John.

[03:14] I looked at Godfather.

[03:16] I looked at Avatar.

[03:17] Those rad cows just look better.

[03:20] I mean it.

[03:21] I wish they had done a little bit more shininess in that cabinet, but it kind of goes because

[03:28] the gold armor on the game has a sort of similar subdued look to it.

[03:34] It's not the same armor as Godfather or Elton John.

[03:39] We went and got a lockdown bar from those two games and it is a different color.

[03:44] So they're not reusing parts for Harry Potter.

[03:47] Okay.

[03:47] So then the next thing I noticed in the game was the topper because I haven't played it yet.

[03:53] This is just my first time walking up to the machine.

[03:56] I looked at the topper and it is even worse than I imagined.

[04:00] It is atrocious.

[04:01] You might have heard me on my live.

[04:03] I think it is horrible.

[04:05] I think they should be embarrassed.

[04:08] There is no way this thing ever should have been approved.

[04:12] I don't know what Eric was doing.

[04:14] If I'm Jersey Jack, I would hit pause on these toppers and I would start over and I would

[04:22] tell everybody we're going to send you the real topper because it is such a disgrace

[04:27] that on such a beautiful pinball machine, they put the ugliest cherry on top of it.

[04:33] It is really that bad people.

[04:35] Okay, but we don't love pinball because of rad cows.

[04:39] We don't love pinball because of toppers.

[04:42] We love pinball because it is a world under glass.

[04:46] It is a kinetically satisfying analog experience of a ball rolling around a piece of wood and

[04:54] you want to see how you get the ball from here to there.

[04:57] You want to see the ball do magical stuff.

[05:00] You want the game to come alive in your hands.

[05:02] So what was it like playing Harry Potter right next to it was a King Kong premium.

[05:08] I got to play.

[05:09] I've been playing guns and roses way too much.

[05:12] Some might say two games on guns and roses is too much, but I'm here right now to tell

[05:18] you that this is the best shooting Jersey Jack game ever made.

[05:25] It is.

[05:26] It eclipses Elton John and the reason why I say that is Elton John is a lot of fun.

[05:32] Don't get me wrong, but this game's got a lot more to shoot at.

[05:36] It's got a lot more things happening with the ball.

[05:39] That's a lot more interesting when you go from Harry Potter and walk over to Elton John,

[05:45] which I did.

[05:46] It makes Elton John look empty.

[05:49] Even when you go over to Avatar, it makes that game look empty.

[05:53] When you go over to Godfather, it makes that game look like it wasn't even started.

[05:57] I hate to say this, but if you own a Godfather, Harry Potter is going to destroy the value

[06:04] on your Godfather.

[06:06] It's going to destroy the value on your Avatar.

[06:10] I think it's really going to chip away at all the Elton John's that have been holding

[06:14] value because it's the best shooting Jersey Jack game to date.

[06:18] When you start playing it and you enjoy the shots and the geometry and it's not a brick

[06:24] fest and it doesn't drain like crazy on the out lanes like some other Jersey Jack games,

[06:31] I noticed that the slingshots were really big on this game.

[06:35] If you look how long they are, they look longer than normal.

[06:39] I think Jersey Jack did that on purpose.

[06:42] I think they're trying to make it so you're not going to see a lot of side to side action

[06:47] drain the ball.

[06:49] It's a much easier game to play than any other Jersey Jack game I've ever played.

[06:55] I think the easiest game before this was probably Toy Story, but there's just something satisfying

[07:02] about shooting this game and looking down at it.

[07:06] It definitely does have a much more world under glass feel to it than any of the previous

[07:12] Jersey Jack games we got recently.

[07:15] And look, there's no Hogwarts Castle under there, but what is there?

[07:20] What is there does really pull you in?

[07:24] The gold wire forms, the big diverter staircase, the death eater, the upper quidditch playfield,

[07:32] it all sort of works nicely.

[07:35] Most of the action in this game is happening at the top of the game.

[07:41] So the middle of the game is pretty wide open and that's what makes it very fun to shoot.

[07:47] It's real simple and bimbo.

[07:49] You've got to give the ball some space to go to really have flow.

[07:54] And that's why Guns N' Roses is so unsatisfying because it's always crashing into something

[08:00] so close to the flippers and you really can't get any flow in Guns N' Roses even when you

[08:05] lob it up the game because there's nothing on the right side that has any flow whatsoever.

[08:11] And there's really no flow on the left side because you go up that ramp and that's about

[08:16] it.

[08:17] The orbits are all the way on the end.

[08:19] That doesn't really create a lot of satisfying flow.

[08:22] And the upper right flipper shot on Guns N' Roses is clunky.

[08:26] It's not a really satisfying shot to hit.

[08:29] Because in this game the upper right flipper shot is super satisfying.

[08:34] The shots up the middle are very satisfying.

[08:38] How they send the ball either into the staircase, it can go into the pop bumper.

[08:43] There's a little mirror I didn't even notice until I was playing the game that is showing

[08:48] you what the ball is doing.

[08:50] That's really cool.

[08:51] I think someone's going to mob that and make a really nice mirror go there.

[08:55] But I didn't even notice that was there looking at any of the streams.

[08:59] The player's point of view of this game.

[09:02] We've been seeing so much of the top down view of Potter.

[09:06] But from a player's point of view it definitely is an interesting game.

[09:12] It definitely feels like it has more in it than we've seen in the photos.

[09:16] Now is it packed?

[09:19] I wouldn't use the word packed.

[09:22] I think a third of the game is packed.

[09:25] I think two thirds of the game are kind of empty.

[09:28] I would have liked to have seen something interesting on the left side of the game.

[09:33] There's not even a physical kickback in this game.

[09:36] There's usually a physical kickback in Jersey Jack games.

[09:40] So there's nothing really happening on that left side at all.

[09:44] There's nothing really happening on the right side at all other than that target that pops

[09:48] up that saves your ball.

[09:50] So there's not a lot of drama or anything really interesting happening in the lower

[09:55] half of the game.

[09:57] It's all about going north on the play field.

[10:00] It's all about the speeds that are happening up there.

[10:03] But there's a lot of really interesting combos in this game I was hitting.

[10:08] And man you can't you can't fall asleep in this game.

[10:12] There's moments the ball is coming back at you so damn quick.

[10:15] I was like wait a minute did that come from somewhere else.

[10:18] I wasn't sure like because when you hit the ball into the staircase area it's firing

[10:23] it in so many different directions.

[10:25] I love the fact that the game keeps you on your toes.

[10:29] It's not going to get boring.

[10:30] And when you play it realizing that that's going to be how this game plays it does make

[10:36] the replay value in it extraordinary.

[10:39] It really does.

[10:40] It's definitely not going to be a game where you're going to get tired of the way it shoots.

[10:45] And I hate to say this this game is really going to make every other Jersey Jack game

[10:50] age pretty poorly because I think this being the most satisfying JJP game.

[10:56] I think people are going to get over the old ones really quickly.

[11:00] It's been forever and a day since we've ever got a Jersey Jack game.

[11:05] That's not a music pin that shoots this well.

[11:08] Wonka is not this interesting to shoot.

[11:11] It's not that interesting to shoot dialed in.

[11:14] I think it really is a gameplay winner.

[11:17] And I think Eric should feel really proud about the satisfaction that he's going to give

[11:21] players when they play Harry Potter Pimbal.

[11:24] I will also say like the artwork is fine.

[11:27] The artwork I didn't have a problem with it.

[11:29] The lights in the game are fine.

[11:31] There's a lot of lights going on in this game.

[11:33] And when they're doing interesting things with the light shows it's really cool.

[11:37] They don't use the tiny little LEDs.

[11:40] But when they want to when they want to create a moment in this game with

[11:44] lighting they can do a really cool job.

[11:47] I didn't feel like it was Rainbow Puk.

[11:50] I didn't really know what I was doing either.

[11:52] The one shot that was hard in this game and I'm sure I'll just find it was the scoop

[11:57] on the right side.

[11:59] That's how you select the different movies.

[12:03] That's not an easy shot to hit.

[12:05] I'm not sure I ever got to the top top wire form which uses the magnet to send the ball

[12:11] in a different way.

[12:12] I got the balls on the magic wand.

[12:15] Locking them there was cool.

[12:17] There was a lot of satisfaction in that way more satisfaction than locking the

[12:21] balls in Avatar or Godfather.

[12:24] There's just something about physical ball locks that are nice to see.

[12:27] So gameplay wise great game.

[12:30] Great layout.

[12:31] Super fun to shoot.

[12:33] Does it have a wow mechanism in it?

[12:36] The answer is still no.

[12:38] Even after playing it a bunch.

[12:40] I was wishing there would be a little bit of something more dramatic.

[12:46] Something that would just wow when it happens.

[12:49] It's not going to happen in this game.

[12:51] Would I have liked there to have been something you know the ball flying through the air a la

[12:56] Houdini something like the theater of magic trunk.

[13:00] I would have liked there to have been something more like the shooting star out lane save

[13:04] from Toten.

[13:06] Something mechanically that pops up and does something a little bit more magical.

[13:12] Maybe to save your ball.

[13:14] Maybe to fly through the air like a wizard just doesn't have it.

[13:17] OK, so for those of you that want to call people over you're not really going to have

[13:23] the thing to show people that this game can do.

[13:26] So there's that.

[13:27] I also felt like looking down at the bottom of the game and I mean this like the bottom

[13:33] half of the game does feel like they stopped spending money in that part of the game.

[13:40] Like everything's happening at the top the scopes all the levels of play all the effort

[13:46] something about looking down at the plastics on the slingshot area.

[13:51] It just looked like a little cheap.

[13:53] It looked like an opportunity to put some scopes there.

[13:56] I get the modders might do it.

[13:58] But again we're talking about a $15,000 machine.

[14:03] So I would have liked to have seen something on there something a little bit more interesting.

[14:09] It didn't bother me because your attention is so much on the gameplay.

[14:13] And that's the thing is when you make the gameplay so satisfying it's true you get away

[14:18] with not having too much other stuff.

[14:21] The flippers are amazing.

[14:24] These flippers are so much better than my guns and roses flippers with the new I.O.

[14:30] board.

[14:31] This game I think has as close to stern flipper feel as you're ever going to feel on a Jersey

[14:38] Jack machine.

[14:39] They also don't sound so loud.

[14:42] We went over to King Kong and they're so snappy and loud.

[14:45] These just felt a lot more premium.

[14:47] It's weird to say that it just felt like the way you close a door on a Mercedes and stern

[14:52] feels like you're closing the door on a Honda Civic.

[14:55] The other thing about this game and it's hard to sort of it's hard to really crystallize

[15:01] what I mean by this.

[15:02] But I think this is where Harry Potter just really shines.

[15:06] And I think everyone who plays this might want one because of this.

[15:11] This game is just so magnetically appealing.

[15:16] And by a magnetically appealing, I mean it just pulls you in because of how beautiful

[15:22] it is, because of how beautiful it shoots and because of how stunning the overall presentation

[15:29] and platform is of a Jersey Jack game.

[15:33] It's like they nailed the craft of what a pinball machine can be.

[15:37] And this company's been doing it but I think they finally have done it where it's not

[15:41] unsatisfying after you hit the start button because of the gameplay.

[15:46] But this game wins on craft alone.

[15:50] When you look at this thing next to the lineup of stern machines they had there, when you

[15:55] look at it next to Pulp Fiction, when you look at it next to all the games, it's like

[16:00] Jersey Jack is just giving you now something that just looks so much better than everything

[16:08] else.

[16:09] And the $10,000 version of this game has everything in it.

[16:15] I would argue that the Wizard Edition, if it has the glossy radcals, is the way to go

[16:22] because I don't think everyone's going to love the matte finish of the CE artwork and

[16:28] I think the CE topper is atrocious.

[16:31] So I think the Wizard Edition, if it has the glossy radcals, is going to be the best version

[16:37] of this game.

[16:38] It's also going to be the best looking version of this game because again the CE's just

[16:42] got a dull finish to it.

[16:44] But it doesn't matter, it's like this game just jumps out at you.

[16:49] It hits you in a visceral way that stern machines just don't.

[16:54] But this game also has an Achilles heel and I think the Achilles heel of this game is

[17:02] going to be the code.

[17:04] And after playing this game and really enjoying the way it's shot, I turned around to everybody

[17:10] I was with and I was like, do you have any idea what you're doing?

[17:15] And everyone said no.

[17:17] And then they handed me the rule chart for the game and it was ridiculous.

[17:22] And that's my worry about Harry Potter, pinball.

[17:26] I'm not worried about it being stunning.

[17:28] I'm not worried about the gameplay.

[17:31] I'm worried that this game has got too much they're trying to do with the code so that

[17:38] when you hit start, you're not really sure what is happening at the beginning of the

[17:44] game, which I don't like.

[17:46] And it's just overly complex.

[17:49] It's just nothing about it is intuitive.

[17:52] And there's way too much happening all at once.

[17:55] And I'm worried about that because I think there's a masterpiece here if Jersey Jack can

[18:02] dial it down a little bit on the code.

[18:06] They've got to figure out a way to use more finesse when they're tackling the subject

[18:11] matter like this.

[18:13] They should have done broader strokes, less of all this stuff happening at once, all these

[18:19] side things and choosing this and choosing that and getting this banner and going to

[18:23] this school and collecting this item.

[18:26] They should have broad stroked the major moments in the films that everybody remembers

[18:32] and they should have pulled those through more and let you feel those moments more.

[18:37] We started this mode and it's hairy at the table with his relatives and the guy's belly

[18:43] is blowing up and you see them talking to each other, but you're not really in it.

[18:49] And here's the crazy part.

[18:51] You can hear very slightly.

[18:53] You can hear in a lot of those scenes the sound effects.

[18:56] So I do think they have permission to use those clips, but for some reason I just feel

[19:02] like the game's trying to do too much all at once.

[19:06] And that is my worry about this game is that they might have overdone it in the way they're

[19:13] approaching the software and that could really be detrimental to the overall enjoyment of

[19:21] the game because you still want to feel like you have a grasp of the code of what's going

[19:27] on.

[19:28] I only played it for like an hour, but that's my only concern.

[19:33] If I'm them, I think they need to do what they did with Wonka.

[19:38] Remember when Wonka came out and nobody got to see a lot of the fun stuff and it was too

[19:42] hard to get to everything, but it makes me nervous because Wonka was only five golden

[19:46] tickets.

[19:47] Right?

[19:48] Five golden tickets unlocked.

[19:49] Five magical, memorable wow moments in the game.

[19:53] I'm worried about this because I don't even know like what the journey is.

[19:59] 96 modes, eight movies.

[20:02] You can't even unlock movies seven and eight until you get through all of one through six,

[20:09] all of one through six on a three ball game.

[20:12] And that's my worry is that you're going to jump on Potter.

[20:17] You're going to have fun playing it, but progressing through the game is going to be

[20:23] impossible because they've just put too much in it.

[20:27] And I think the way they're treating this game is that movies seven and eight are kind

[20:33] of like Valoranor in Lord of the Rings.

[20:35] Like they don't expect most people to ever get there or see it.

[20:39] And I don't know, right?

[20:41] It's like when you play Lord of the Rings, you can still destroy the ring and get to

[20:46] all the memorable moments in the movies without having to get to Valoranor.

[20:51] And if you've ever played Lord of the Rings, Pinball, one of the most satisfying moments

[20:55] to get to is there and back again.

[20:58] And I'm just worried looking at the map of everything happening in this game.

[21:04] It's too much.

[21:05] It's too much.

[21:06] And that's my overall assessment of Harry Potter, Pinball.

[21:08] It's absolutely stunning.

[21:10] It's an amazing shooter.

[21:12] It makes Stern games look like a tinker toy.

[21:16] Stern's got some work to do.

[21:17] It really does.

[21:18] I think this game is going to sell like no other.

[21:21] They're going to make collector's editions first, then they're going to make one of the

[21:25] other editions.

[21:26] So if you get an early CE, I think your games are going to go up in value because I think

[21:31] people are going to want one.

[21:32] But I actually don't know if the CE is the way to go.

[21:35] I thought I did going into today.

[21:38] But again, I think the Wizard Edition with the Radcals.

[21:42] And I actually think the Wizard Edition toppers nicer than that atrocious thing on top of

[21:48] the CE.

[21:49] Again, you could save yourself a bunch of money.

[21:51] And with them making the CE's unlimited, I don't really see any of the FOMO or the need

[21:56] to get one.

[21:57] They're not even going to have a plaque on it that says this number out of, right?

[22:01] You're not even going to know.

[22:02] But overall, overall, I was surprised.

[22:05] It doesn't sound like a slot machine.

[22:08] I was wrong.

[22:09] When you are playing this game in person, it doesn't sound like Willy Wonka.

[22:15] It doesn't sound like a slot machine.

[22:17] There's just so much going on.

[22:19] And I think this game will be one of the greatest games of all time.

[22:24] If the software team on it can distill it down to something that gives the player a

[22:31] more intimate, approachable game.

[22:35] Right now, as it stands, it is not that.

[22:39] It is too much going on at once.

[22:41] Everything's crashing on top of everything.

[22:44] You start a mode and eight other things are crashing on top of it.

[22:47] It's not intimate.

[22:49] They need to approach it with a little bit more style, a little bit more taste.

[22:55] And right now, it just feels like Joe Katz is wearing all of his clothes at once and

[23:00] wants us to feel like he's got good taste.

[23:03] It's too much.

[23:04] I think they need to dial it down.

[23:06] I think they need to simplify it.

[23:08] And I hope they can do that.

[23:09] It's one of the reasons why I worry that they don't do any early testing or focus groups

[23:15] on games because I do worry that what we see is what we're going to get.

[23:21] And I worry that they're going to add even more and they don't need to add more.

[23:25] They just need to simplify what they have.

[23:28] Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[23:32] I love playing new pinball machines.

[23:34] I love it.

[23:35] I can't wait to go back and play this game again.

[23:38] I do kind of wish there was one in my home.

[23:41] I'm going to lose a fortune on Guns N' Roses.

[23:43] My Guns N' Roses CE is after Harry Potter comes out, it's going to be worth eight at

[23:49] most, eight, seven thousand on top of it to get a damn Harry Potter CE.

[23:54] But that's going to happen to so many games.

[23:57] This game is going to torpedo the value of your Guns N' Roses, your Elton John, your

[24:03] Avatar, and your Godfather.

[24:06] I think out of all of them, Godfathers are going to start to be worth like seven thousand

[24:11] for the CE and five for the Ellie.

[24:13] I mean it.

[24:14] That's how much better Harry Potter is.

[24:16] Canada out.
