[00:00] I mean, Vincenble! You're a loony. The Black Knight always trumps! Havageo!

[00:14] Episode 41 of Canadian's Pinball Podcasts. I have to say this is probably one of my favorite podcasts that I've done to date.

[00:24] I had the chance to talk with Pinsides very own The Black Knight, but this man goes way beyond Pinsides.

[00:32] And I think for all of you out there who listen to this show and some of you have been in this hobby for a long time, many of you might be new to the hobby.

[00:41] This interview is just great because his depth of knowledge is just phenomenal and he's been in this hobby for over a quarter decades.

[00:53] And so when we talk about what it means to get into the Pinball hobby, what it means to be a collector, what it means to be a buyer, a player, he's seen it all.

[01:02] And I think his perspective is so interesting and it's unlike any other perspective I've really heard when I talk to people about Pinball.

[01:10] And this first interview that we did, it's really a lot of great information for those of us who are new to the hobby.

[01:18] And there's many of us on Pinside who are pretty brand new to this hobby. And by that I mean, it doesn't mean we don't like Pinball, but we've just started getting into the whole notion of we're going to collect Pinball machines and we're going to put them into our homes and we're going to make them part of our lives.

[01:34] Not only that, but we're going to spend like an inordinate amount of time talking about Pinball.

[01:39] And you know who you are, the people who just talk and talk and talk and we are on the forums and we're constantly spewing out statements and so little of them are educated and are rooted in any real knowledge of what we're even talking about sometimes.

[01:54] And I think the reason why I was trying to think about it, because most of us when we get into collecting something like arcade games or Pinball machines, it's so much of an emotional thing that gets us into collecting.

[02:07] We see a machine we loved. Oh my god, we realized we can have this toy in our house and all of us in our home can be transformed into an arcade like environment.

[02:15] And we just run, we run towards it so emotionally and that we fail to do the due diligence in educating ourselves on on the hobby itself.

[02:26] And I think black nights, feedback I think is insights are invaluable. I want to let you just hear them. We had a great conversation.

[02:35] We also teed up a lot of other things we definitely want to talk about down the road. So without further ado, I want to thank you to the black night for doing this interview and I think you guys are really going to enjoy this chat.

[02:47] So without further ado, let's roll the tape.

[02:50] All right, I want to welcome to Canada's pinball podcast, probably the man who knows more than anyone I know about pinball, and that is the black night talking to the guy who knows probably the least about pinball canada.

[03:04] So this should be interesting. Black night, welcome to the show.

[03:08] Hey, thanks for being allowed to be a part of your what pinball fireside chat. That's what it is. That's what it is.

[03:15] I didn't even have to bribe you with any money or Pepsi perfect. That's usually what I have to resort to these days to get people on. So thank you for coming on for free.

[03:25] I don't know if you kind of put it as a stretch. I mean, there's plenty of guys out here like me that have a lot of history and knowledge. We just a lot of them don't post and talk.

[03:35] They're either busy or you know, they do other things are retired or you're on pinside a lot and you really do share so much valuable information with when topics come up.

[03:47] Now how often are you on the forum?

[03:51] Generally, I log in at the end of the day, you know, because I am still working. I you know, I retired from the military about three years ago and returned to pinball really only in the last year just because I was so busy.

[04:06] And now I just you know, I have obviously those staple thread post that I find interesting and particularly those that are like machines that I've owned or still do own because a lot of guys they need tech help and RGP is as great as a resources it is.

[04:26] It's kind of a shotgun effect. You don't get the same level of immediate response sometimes. The advantage is of course as you can post pictures, you know, and in general for general tech stuff, RGP is still the best.

[04:42] But pinside it has that outer reach. It kind of captures a lot of the new collectors and they're not as reading all these other like the WPC forums. There's a lot of other places other than pinside.

[04:54] And the only thing that I can say is that pinside is not just the only mecca of pinball. It's just the one that is most popular because it's easy to read.

[05:02] And the format is great. And I think you bring a bring a good point because pinside is really an amalgamation of mostly collectors. So I see owners. I don't know if they're all collectors, but they're certainly owners.

[05:14] That's true. I consider myself a collector with technically right now I own three pinball machines. Is that enough to be considered a collector?

[05:26] If you have one machine you're a collector. I'm not one of these guys that feels like you got to have some massive collection. The key is it's kind of in your mentality.

[05:36] I mean I wrote an article a long time ago which is the stages of pinball that a lot of people may have read on pinside and then Chris Munson wrote a really nice article which I did a repost our recently that was from an original Texas pinball festival on kind of like where are you in this world?

[05:54] Are you a player that the stages of pinball collecting this this is like the little bit of history like you know plug is it always goes in the basics these basic stages you start out as a player.

[06:06] Then you're an owner then you're a collector then you're a store and then you're a hoarder.

[06:12] And that's where and and and where were you start or end in this process or where you take breaks and stuff that's up to you and it's not based on money it's just based on time and you know you you mentioned to me before the show about you know avoiding burnout which is absolutely critical.

[06:31] I mean even I've got burnout and that's one of the reasons why a lot of people don't stick around in the hobby right so they they get so far into it get so close to it up front and then they well they're they're over their head technically and they're really so my god my house is full pinball machines that don't work or they you know financially some people over extend themselves because they get the bug real bad.

[06:54] Yeah there's a lot of different reasons but the key is that you have to look at your you know I think you said it and some other shows you know when when you start to get too close to this hobby well you might want to consider going outside in the sunshine right.

[07:10] The weather here like I live in the Pacific Northwest the weather here turns okay we're not in this rainy season right now I mean it's like I'm not spending a whole lot of time indoors right.

[07:21] All in just the shows the shows are in the summer yeah I mean a lot of them are so in you know if you're going to go to the shows and be active you you know you got to do it then.

[07:32] No there's nothing better use there's no better use of time on a nice sunny day than the city inside all they're going to play pinball.

[07:39] I don't like agenda sorry I just don't like cup of tea right right well black night you bring up an interesting point so I know we were talking about some of the things we want to tackle on this

[07:51] episode and I think a good place to start is what kind of advice would you give people who are getting into the hobby because I think we've seen very recently in explosion of new people getting into this hobby right we hear so many people saying Ghostbusters is the first pin I'm

[08:07] ever going to buy new in box. What do you want to tell people that are thinking of going down this road. Well the first thing is simply put I mean I got

[08:16] involved in a hobby as a collector not as an owner or player I mean players like you know eons ago I guess and the don't you know dinosaurs you know

[08:24] room here but no I got involved in the early 90s I mean I started working collecting actually owning machines in 91 or well I had machines before

[08:36] them but once I could buy was 91 but when I started out I mean it was obviously it was a different environment a lot I mean I

[08:44] still remember comments and not necessarily recently but once like well nobody owned pinball machines before 1990 well I'm like what there's a lot of people

[08:55] to did but one of the basic things that when a person starts to get into this hobby is I need to set a budget all right because that's

[09:03] one of the things that quickly overtakes people because I really don't understand how much I mean it's this is people say well this is an

[09:11] expensive hobby and you can't break into it well the same shit was said like 20 years ago yeah and it's not true it's always been

[09:19] it's always been in you know somewhat expensive but there are ways we know there's a lot more expensive hobbies out there sure guys

[09:26] car car collections shit guitars I mean everything I mean it I mean granted it the thing that separates it from other hobbies is the it wanted it

[09:36] in that it has to be an indoor thing which means it takes up a lot of space we all know that and every time I've ever had a house and I've

[09:44] owned you know moved around the world quite a bit first thing it is you know I got this mental image of how many

[09:50] machines I can fit in the house right and that's probably when you know you're you're been bitten a little bit too deep by the bug is when

[09:58] you're the only furniture you want to optimize for as a pinball machine it might make it hard to to be in a relationship with the

[10:06] significant other if that's the prior I mean I had a guy I remember here in Portland and this was you know almost 15 20 years ago it is

[10:15] that famous pinball living room picture where he's got like six or eight behind his couch and his TV is like a foot away from his couch screen I mean it's just right you

[10:25] have to draw the line because you know so the first thing is it really is it's setting the budget the second thing is sitting down and figuring out you know what

[10:35] what did you enjoy because the key is a lot of people will buy machines because it's available which isn't necessarily a good choice because

[10:43] in terms of games the ones you want to own are the longevity ones it may not be the greatest pin after there's a I hate the say this and as much you know I am opinionated people know that I'm

[10:54] pinside and you know something like an accepted and some people can't but one of the things that we got into a kind of a trap back in the early 2000s

[11:02] that was called the cookie cutter collection you know I actually had somebody accused me back in like 98 or five or something like what you have

[11:13] and there was this kind of this consolidation of certain titles that where everybody everybody wanted okay there wasn't like a pure top

[11:22] ten list they were always popular I mean things like Twilight Zone Indiana Jones I mean the originals from you know Williams and ballet I mean they were

[11:30] always popular but there wasn't like this massive you know collection all number of people and then you know somebody said well you just have all the

[11:40] pins that everybody else had I said well I had these pins before people had a had a music concept you know like I bought my night my

[11:48] Indiana or a Twilight Zone for example I bought new out of box as an overstock in 1994 I mean it's been with me ever

[11:56] since it never went in an arcade what what did it cost back then 24 hundred bucks wow that was what it was brand new

[12:04] so let's talk budget because that was the first thing to consider right so you when you got into the hobby I mean price is something we can

[12:12] avoid especially now it is what was it light back then buying pinball machines well you didn't have like today you know the market as

[12:22] it's about a sixty forty split right now I one of the things I do is I track the market really close I'm not a price guide per say I mean a lot

[12:31] of people asking that kind of stuff but you know the market is completely shifted from what it was in the 90s and in the 2000s

[12:37] in the 2000 well in the 90s it was exclusively eight it was like 80 20 and operators okay 80% was operators 20% was home market sales

[12:46] because there I mean you know one of the first games that was the home market was the you know a abyss family right that was really the first

[12:56] home marketed pin of a commercial nature beyond the home addition of games that were previous and you know in the

[13:05] 2000s it was the re imports which happened after Williams closed in nineteen ninety not so you know to answer

[13:15] question it comes to budget it it still was the same it there wasn't really like oh well the costs were less and you

[13:23] could pick up games left and right for a hundred dollars yes that's true but that you are those the games you want

[13:29] right because a lot of times a hundred dollar pin in like nineteen ninety five or four or whatever it still was crap

[13:38] right right it's a it's a player game I mean I was buying you know like I had my own my first games about

[13:45] personally was a with help was a f 14 Tomcat in 1988 but you know that was a used game right I couldn't afford a new

[13:54] game I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm hate my pockets aren't endless right I don't gotten by new inbox pins every

[14:02] week well mostly because I don't see it value in it right so is it so is it so is an Adams family when it was sold

[14:10] new inbox back in the day was roughly what around three well no no no no no it was less in nineteen ninety two

[14:19] when Adams family came out I mean I can't remember without going back to my records from the distributor study

[14:25] dealt with but the key was you didn't have any private sellers if you wanted to buy a game and this was all

[14:31] the way up through the early two thousand and I mean even through the mid two thousand if you wanted to buy a brand new

[14:38] machine you had to go find your local distributor okay because remember I mean if you want to go back to the

[14:45] ninety so the internet wasn't like there's no forums there's no can there's nothing well they had forums but you

[14:51] wouldn't remember them because everybody it was the days even before our GP well that was a chat room days

[14:56] right I mean people are you know all up moto it was a more moto than you dial up and you like oh I wonder if I

[15:02] can like see some stuff and and it was predominantly operators you didn't have a lot of collectors that were

[15:08] because the internet was fairly a new thing so the bottom line is yeah you when you were looking for games brand

[15:13] new right you had to find whoever the local distributor was in your region you couldn't easily connect with

[15:20] distributors in other states you couldn't cross level prices very well so you were kind of stock

[15:26] with whoever was local because you were trying to minimize the cost for shipping okay and that was

[15:33] that simple so you it wasn't that you were price locked because one difference thing is like a operator

[15:40] if an individual owner went to a distributor and wanted to buy a game they you could still

[15:46] haggle to a certain extent okay you can do that today it's like hey you take it or not because

[15:52] there's obviously a lot of other different distributors that you can buy games from and they're all

[15:57] there you know they're at this point because the market is driven partially by home use right that the

[16:03] competition at the distributor level is very is critical because that's how they stay in business

[16:08] a lot of the dealers and the brokers that I still deal with in fact some of the guys that I helped

[16:13] re ship re import container pins back in nearly 2000s because I was living in Europe okay so I

[16:21] would my these guys would be like hey if you see pins like we could buy and re import can you

[16:28] give us a call and I helped these guys put them containers and ship them back and then I got kind of

[16:32] like the cherry pick okay and and I didn't get a good place to be good place I mean I will I mean

[16:38] I mean that's a whole different subject you want to talk about Europe and the re import that's an

[16:43] interesting story in itself because that was a feeding frenzy of a different type well we'll cover

[16:49] off on that you get another episode like sure good but I do want to talk about that because I when I

[16:55] when I was going over my tails the rabie and nights and I bought one I never asked the question of

[17:01] if it was a re import or not I didn't even think to ask that it doesn't matter people used I remember

[17:06] it this is a very funny point I remember in the multiple forums it wasn't just RGP

[17:12] where I said in particularly the re import days they said hey re import suck or actually the

[17:19] original suck and it was it's complete crap you it doesn't matter I mean yes there are pure

[17:25] sout there that only want the domestic versions of a game but we all know there's no

[17:30] difference in the game you switch the transformer settings and you're good to go in fact the

[17:35] interesting simply put is the games that were re imported from the majority of them that

[17:41] were good shape that were re imported from Europe and other places were generally in better

[17:45] condition than the US games because they didn't have arcades right I said there's a whole

[17:49] another story there can go behind this and it would probably take 30 minutes to an

[17:54] hour to describe that and we're we're going to go into that at another episode and I was

[17:59] telling the black night we're going to we're going to keep these these to around an hour

[18:03] but he he said I'll come back so for those of you listening we're not going to you

[18:08] well I think I think it's going to be good so let's talk about interesting questions

[18:13] items family what do you think what do you think that game would be priced at today

[18:18] if it came out I just did one I actually I had a collector here now remember it prices

[18:24] are effective on multiple factors and this is something a collector should know or

[18:28] potential buyer okay it's based obviously number one is condition period any game

[18:35] that you buy is based on condition but you all have to consider things like

[18:39] availability collectability or trends the individual market and that's the complex one

[18:46] because there's no price guide flat rate because there's no synonymous thing it's never

[18:50] been stabilized and the last one being regional area okay now for example there was a very

[18:57] nice Adams family that recently sold by another collector I had real close to my house

[19:02] and I'm looking for a third one I've had two last one I sold we got shipped back to

[19:07] that's the joke itself but that was back in early 2000s the point is he wanted

[19:12] seven thousand dollars for it okay is that a fair price I don't know let's go see take

[19:18] look at it you show me the pictures pictures look nice but that isn't the tail of the

[19:23] tape so I'm going to put on you know my collector glasses with it you know go over

[19:27] there and take a look at the machine the machine was an excellent condition was it

[19:31] had condition wise I would rate it probably excellent it wasn't super wasn't

[19:36] collector quality but you know it didn't have any issues meaning the DMD was good

[19:41] the play field didn't have magnet burns and so on and so on and so on and you know

[19:45] I looked at the machine and you know it wasn't the machine I was looking for I know

[19:50] and so they answer your question is okay what was it worth seven thousand dollars no

[19:55] okay currently right now on the market inflation of an Adams family currently

[20:00] right now not considering what dealers are charging is between fifty two and fifty

[20:05] eight hundred dollars here okay here and this part of the country I can't say what it is in

[20:11] Europe I can't say what it is in East Coast or New York City I can't I can tell you

[20:16] what it's here because I can see it based on the market now the key is okay well is

[20:20] that a fair price well yes it is if the machine is in that condition where it is

[20:25] and so on but it's not seven thousand dollar machine and he asked me in and

[20:30] he was very you know professional normally you don't want to do that I'm one of

[20:35] those type of guys are not good low ball anybody if you want seven thousand bucks

[20:40] and I don't think the machine is worth it I'm not going to haggle right I'm like well

[20:45] you know I I'm sorry but I got a pass and you don't have to say why but he actually

[20:50] asked me he says well what do you think it's worth I says well I told him exactly

[20:55] what I just said but I said here's the catch I said based on the area that you're in

[20:59] you're probably going to sell it between six thousand and sixty five hundred

[21:02] dollars because of the market and people that hear that have deep pockets

[21:08] right guess what it's all for sixty two okay now it makes hard make out of sense

[21:13] but it but that you know that doesn't mean that people won't pay more but the

[21:17] number one thing that you can add on to this statement about collectors or what

[21:21] they can do to help themselves is if they're interested in getting into this

[21:24] hobby and it doesn't matter what machine they want to buy go find a local

[21:28] collector and have them help you not an owner find somebody that really knows

[21:33] their shit and go down there and help them out help them inspect the machine

[21:38] ask questions I get people that ping me to ping a seller because and I'm the

[21:45] guy that's buying the machine to find out if it's legitimate and it's

[21:50] totally fine and above the board right because if you have to go ahead it's the same

[21:55] way you you know there's services where if you're buying a used car site unseen

[21:59] you can you can hire mechanics to go look at it right so what's the best way

[22:04] for people who are you know thinking of buying machine that either they don't

[22:09] have enough knowledge which is a lot of people who collect right or

[22:13] if you know I mean I don't know I mean it depends on how long they've been

[22:16] involved in the hobby but there's a huge difference between somebody it's a

[22:19] player and somebody it's an owner and somebody it's a collector it just is

[22:23] right because there's vast number of years of experience now some people say

[22:26] well that's kind of arrogant or pompous I said well no it's not because you

[22:30] know if people want to get help I'll I'm here to say you as it what they

[22:34] consider to be part of the old guard of our GP you know the guys like Cliff you

[22:39] were near and Steve Charlin then you know Steve Cooper and all these people

[22:44] that people might remember but maybe they don't I don't know we're here to help

[22:50] I mean sometimes we come off as being brash and you play Harold for example I

[22:55] mean he's a great guy but he robs people the wrong way he's a very guff guy

[22:58] and and why because he knows his crap okay and he doesn't like to hear

[23:03] stuff from other people that is wrong and so yeah he's extremely opinionated

[23:08] but we're here to help and there are ever I've never met another collector that

[23:12] isn't a flipper remember that's the key word if they're not a flipper and

[23:17] they're not a broker I haven't met a single collector in this hobby ever that

[23:20] wouldn't be willing to help another person parts machines whatever right where

[23:26] do you where do you recommend someone go if they're looking for a collector

[23:31] who's got great knowledge to help them buy a pin to make sure they're getting

[23:35] it for the right price is is pin side to place to go is it actually you can

[23:39] still reference mr. pinball mr. pinball because a lot of the older

[23:43] collectors that's where they have their their their shameless plug of where

[23:47] they they may not have updated their information a long time but if you do a

[23:50] site a state search the names will pop up and these guys have been around

[23:55] forever they don't move and if they're willing to help they usually have their

[24:01] email or some of them have their phone number for Christ and they don't run

[24:06] businesses these are private collectors that that are all they do is this is a

[24:11] hobby for them and and a lot of them specialized in particular areas of

[24:16] machines whether they're EM whether they're early you know solid state whether

[24:21] they're 6803 ballies whether they're got a lead wedge heads whatever they

[24:27] are and if you find out who the what they want it's so much easier than even

[24:32] pin side because pin sides like a shotgun blast when it comes to collectors

[24:36] right you know you need not to say that people aren't extremely knowledgeable but

[24:40] I'm here to tell you that the majority of the people that are on

[24:43] pin site aren't the hardcore collectors right there's a enthusiast there are the

[24:47] new the latest and newest generation remember I didn't even have a pin

[24:51] side account until 2015 so you know I come back from being the United States

[24:55] and like what's been said right no and I know it I think that's an accurate

[24:59] assessment of of who's on there and the and these guys are new they're

[25:03] enthusiastic and absolutely they can't get enough of it right they've just been

[25:07] bitten by the bug because they right a lot of them are already been doing that we've been

[25:12] doing that for years yeah yeah you're like not you guys are like not this

[25:16] conversation again like those guys I mean on pin side some of the hyper

[25:20] uses there I mean they literally post every hour every day 24 seven there's a

[25:25] lot of questions like on that's the thing a lot of people don't want to post

[25:28] tech answers because if you go like it do any type of small search online like

[25:33] 90% of the questions that ever get asked on pin side have already been answered

[25:37] a thousand times on every other forum across the United States right and and

[25:42] and for people that are old we get that one of the things that really irritates

[25:47] us as a person that tries to help with tech is you know you've got to be able to

[25:52] speak the jargon okay if the guys will this thing you won't work and they go

[25:58] sideways and it's supposed to move up and down I mean I don't know what that is

[26:02] right I say reference of schematic tell me and if I tech speak in actual

[26:07] tech word some people take offense to it feel like they're being demeaned and

[26:11] I'm not I'm not doing that at all I'm just trying to answer your question but I

[26:14] don't know how to answer it in thingy talk right do you know what a a pinball

[26:19] tro is a tro because I call the trough a tro it was like the biggest I think I

[26:27] I've heard you call it that yeah I know but you know hey you can call it any

[26:32] thing you want you want to call it a ball tray some people call it a ball tray

[26:35] right I'm going to make canada pinball tro t shirts up for for the different

[26:39] expos I go to this year it's going to be great sure big seller well black line

[26:44] let me show question about budget and pricing another angle of it

[26:48] Adams family came out is below $3,000 what do you think though like a if

[26:54] they if Valley Williams were still around or it at a game like Adams

[26:59] fan if you didn't kill pinball you mean yeah if you know they didn't kill it what do

[27:04] you think that game would be if it sold new in box in 2016 with all the toys

[27:09] all the lights all the you know I bet I bet somewhere hiding in somebody's

[27:14] time travel warehouse there is probably an Adams family still somewhere in a box

[27:19] there has to be there's they made were a 20,000 made and you know why I know

[27:23] that because John Robertson for example up Jones juke's up in Vancouver

[27:27] brisk Columbia he got six black nights new in box and sold the last ones in

[27:32] 2001 and 2000 but actually 2005 he had eight of them should have held on to them

[27:39] a few more years that's what he's a good dealer but the dealers I mean they're

[27:43] not you know they got to rotate their stock but my point is is the game was

[27:48] built in 1981 he acquired them in 2001 right these things do exist I'll

[27:55] give you another example I have a overstocked new in box game not recently bought

[28:02] but analysis garage band there's a world for you know so we'll hear out all right

[28:08] but the way I want to add this I guess what I'm getting out of the question now is

[28:11] like not not not not a leftover Adams family new in box like let's just say

[28:16] a pin like Adams family let's say okay Adam family let's say Adams family

[28:24] never came out in 1990 was it to do well it was designed in 1991 but came out

[28:32] let's say that pin with its toys with patlaw potlaw or designing it let's say

[28:38] it came out as a new in box pin by a modern manufacturer in 2016 right so

[28:43] they're going to make as many as as people want yeah how much would the same

[28:48] features I mean like same features every game every LCD let's take him out

[28:55] like a year ago so do you think that pin would be $8,000 $9,000 $7,000 the market

[29:02] sets the price that one of the gold the gold things that people seem to fail

[29:07] to realize on on pen slide and others is that the market sets the price right for

[29:13] new games and old games you know that collectors owners and collectors are

[29:18] shooting himself in the face with a pinball shotgun every single time they

[29:22] overpay for a machine whether it's new or used plain and simple this is not

[29:26] not me putting on my police price hat I don't care what people buy their

[29:31] games for just be aware that like Jersey Jack pinball when he introduced was

[29:36] he raised the bar and what he did is he raised bar because he made stern of

[29:41] that they could charge more for the games right otherwise we'd still be

[29:46] sitting at somewhere in the fifth in the 5,000 not considering an LE or a special

[29:50] premium but we would still be sitting much lower than we are right now because

[29:55] the price jumps on both new in box and use games of the top ten variety have

[30:01] tripled in some cases over the last ten years right and with our fish so

[30:06] Jack's initial price for was 6,500 just a couple years later same pinball

[30:12] machine nine thousand dollars and that was in that's because it was price

[30:16] tested because a common it is no conspiracy here no no it's it's simply I

[30:21] mean if you look I don't want to put a little humor in it but basically all it

[30:25] is is simply put you know stern at some lean times they barely survive I mean

[30:30] they they were caught by their fingernails there's a few titles that saved

[30:33] them in the mid-2000s during the drought up until before 2009 and you

[30:38] know there was no Jersey Jack pinball there was no Dutch pinball there was no

[30:43] in and none of this boutique stuff was eggs round I mean the only one it was boutique

[30:47] before then we all know is Gene cutting out he's the only person that ever

[30:52] actually made anything that actually came to grips by the way that's a great

[30:56] story to you might put that on your hat we were making our yeah I'm making

[31:01] notes a re-import big bang bar creation there's a lot of people that would love to

[31:06] hear the history not because you know like I have the opportunity on that I'll

[31:10] keep it real short that open up new inbox you know unboxing ceremony for one

[31:16] of his remakes because I was part of the original process long story but anyway

[31:20] we're gonna get it's just sort of listeners future episodes this is good this

[31:23] is good people are gonna come back to the podcast now this is great it's history

[31:26] and one of the things that I like and a lot of the old collectors look and then we'll

[31:30] get back to whatever point you want to talk about is you know as a collector I'm

[31:34] more interested in the history and the art you know of games yes I do the technical

[31:39] side too but that's how I see put keeping pinball alive right yeah that playing

[31:44] yours great but eventually you get you move into this different phase because you

[31:49] know I don't play competition anymore because I don't want to get all alpha on

[31:53] people so I just chill right but yeah if a game cannot right now if there was an

[31:59] analyst family from a new maker that we would have to obviously help self-compete

[32:04] with Stern and and Jersey Jack panel I mean it would probably be sitting I mean

[32:09] if you're I'm not gonna go the MMR route because the equivalency would be

[32:14] close to that anyway right but we'll be looking at somewhere between seven and

[32:18] eight thousand dollars because of the fact that that's where the market

[32:21] prices amount for new inbox right would you I don't agree to that but that's not my

[32:26] choice so do you think what what is fueling these do you think it's like the new to the

[32:33] hobby over enthusiastic guy who all of a sudden is you know he's probably in the prime

[32:38] earning of his career and he's kind of bored and start to get in this prime

[32:42] earning there's I mean the guys in early 30s or 20s that's not their prime prime

[32:46] earlier 40s but are those the guys really shelling out because when I go to the

[32:50] shows I kind of think it's a little bit you know early 40s sort of

[32:55] it may be 50s no no actually slow younger that the current generations that I

[33:00] see based on me remember to where I live in this is like mecca of pinball where there's

[33:04] like five places within one mile of my house that have pinball and I'm not

[33:08] even metro I mean there's a lot of pinball here it's like 250 plus games in

[33:13] the less than that 20 mile square area just insane amount of not operators

[33:17] this games the majority of of people that are breaking into the hobby now

[33:22] physically now that are interested in the hobby are wanting to own machines may

[33:27] not own them yet but they're looking towards it or in their 20s they're in their

[33:31] late 20s early 30s and and and the guys that are in their 40s you know they're

[33:38] not as common but as soon as the kids leave the house and they're still

[33:42] interested in pinball they start by machines so yes there are guys that are in

[33:46] their 40s guys that are in their 50s and 60s are more of a staple you don't have as

[33:50] many people coming into the hobby they already were in the hobby but maybe they

[33:55] were dormant a lot of guys take breaks for long periods of time but the machines

[34:00] are still there I mean crap I had to keep my soul out of my games and evolve in

[34:04] crates for 10 years and then I just recently brought them out in the last year

[34:08] and a half but it the majority of that's fueling the fire is the ones that are in

[34:14] their 20s the barcades are huge and that's what's big out here that means that

[34:20] the guys hang out they go to their bars with the friends they've got pinball

[34:24] machines there they drink beer they shoot the crap and they play pinball and

[34:28] I would but I would say that I think those guys are fueling the new sort of

[34:33] the the player fire but in terms of buying you and well

[34:37] buying you those guys are not buying new box in their 20s well no okay if you

[34:41] want to specify I thought you were talking about the market in general you're

[34:45] talking new in box well when you will well that's people that are in their 30s

[34:49] and early I mean late 30s so when you define the pinball market so you're

[34:53] talking about the overall specific use games new games I mean it's the

[34:57] Apple's oranges right right well I guess when we were talking about you know

[35:04] Jersey Jack and like the price of new games now so set the bar he did and you

[35:10] think the bar I didn't look so just this week we saw someone sell a a ghost

[35:16] buster's Ellie on pinside for 10 grand right now do you have for the guy

[35:20] total now I like you should be jumping over down free money right do you think

[35:24] that the buyers in it or you think the seller with the seller did great what

[35:28] do you think I don't have an opinion either way can either I don't it's well I

[35:32] I stopped it because anything that I say can be perceived as a price police my

[35:37] point is is the sellers have you set up yourself yeah the sellers happy in the

[35:41] buyers happy everybody's happy I don't I don't care I do I personally think that

[35:46] that person that's buying the machine for 10 grand is smart not particularly

[35:51] because I know that if ghost busters as as interesting and as it as people

[35:57] enthusiastic not just with type it is a good game I've had the chance to play it

[36:00] you know I haven't played an Ellie or a premium because I want to see the

[36:05] features I would I never buy games without playing them first ever okay so let's

[36:10] stop there because I think that what where does that let's talk about that

[36:14] because I think that is a really good piece of advice to people who are getting

[36:19] all the time they throw money out the door and they don't even know what they're

[36:22] getting I mean what the hell right and ghost busters I think I'd have almost

[36:26] every new release has sort of caught people in that web right where they did

[36:34] it off it that was awesome I watched this for three years oh it's gonna be the

[36:37] greatest pin ever and then we unfortunately when it finally gets released to

[36:41] realize oh we got some issues well yeah why not wait I mean here's the thing I

[36:46] I hate to interrupt but this one is a good one because when it comes to ghost

[36:49] buster whether it's a premium Ellie pro whatever if you buy this game before

[36:55] it's released and hopefully you got a chance to play a pro I I can't speak for

[37:01] that but you know if you're willing to drop that kind of money in a new box

[37:05] game and then you get it home and it finally ships and we're not gonna go in any

[37:09] MMR stuff and people waiting two and a half years and all that kind of thing if

[37:14] if if they get at home they open it and they play it and they don't like it I'm

[37:18] not I mean I was gonna blame anybody I mean you can spend your money however you

[37:23] want but do not complain about it because the code's not finished don't complain

[37:27] because it has issues because if you wait in the case of ghost buster specifically

[37:34] if the game is as popular as it like met Metallica right they're gonna keep making

[37:41] premiums and pros until the market is satisfied the market will be saturated and the prices will

[37:47] drop right and Ellie's that there were 12,000 dollars or whatever they're gonna turn into

[37:54] will drop right and you're gonna be able to get one for a couple reasons one because they are

[37:59] there is so many available to buy and then people won't just say well drop an extra

[38:05] because in the justification gets harder to sell because that person had bought the Ellie

[38:10] for whatever they bought 72 95 or whatever the cost was they were able to get from your distributor

[38:15] it no longer has that value and you that's where you talk about the market as a collector in

[38:20] me understanding it so yeah if I want to go spusters Ellie I'll buy by time right now buy one used

[38:27] and I guarantee you that that machine will be very nice because most likely it's gonna be

[38:31] in a collector's hands right it'll it'll and I can guarantee you they will advertise it as less

[38:36] than 200 plays which is what everyone always says hey hey you know what you you can't really tell

[38:44] what I mean that when it comes to even evaluating a game I mean I can't tell a game as 200 plays

[38:50] or a thousand plays I can tell when a game has more than 10,000 plays right but even I mean I

[38:57] it really doesn't matter if the condition of the game warrants the money great why do you think

[39:02] why do you think why do you think people do that like why do they it's easy buy pinball machines

[39:09] without ever playing it instant gratification that's the way it is today but where's the instant

[39:14] gratification when you have to wait two and a half years to get your hobbit hey you know what I

[39:18] can't answer that question I'm part of a different generation all right so I don't I don't make

[39:23] it doesn't make any sense to me but that doesn't mean it doesn't make sense to them if they're happy

[39:28] with their sale it's just like buying a new car ordering it or whatever it'd be really cool

[39:32] someday you know in the pinball market you could order a pinball customized to you know like a car

[39:37] that would be kind of right but no we're not there yet the market isn't there we haven't

[39:41] tipped the balance we're not over 50% in terms of home use not yet people make that mistake all the

[39:47] time oh the home market is driving the force no it's not not yet it might be in two three five

[39:53] I don't know but you know I when it comes to people in their money

[40:00] right all I know is I know what I buy I might buy a 1969 EM Valley joust that had less than

[40:07] about a thousand made you know 40 years ago for 800 bucks and it plays fantastically but it's not

[40:14] a ghost busters but I look you know I don't like the term bang for the buck though

[40:21] there the the list that's on pinside is good to help new people I like that list for under

[40:25] two thousand dollars because there's a lot of machines out there everybody forgets about the

[40:29] EMs but that's another topic again about that stuff yeah it's another one of those like you know

[40:34] EMs versus solid state because there's a whole I mean I'm here as a virtue of saying everybody

[40:43] should own a pinball machine in their house right I think I think it's an awesome toy it is a toy

[40:49] it's not an investment okay I don't buy my games investment I don't stick them in a quarter in the

[40:54] box okay like like coyote that's been you know put his big bang bar on sale for eBay for $30,000

[41:01] for the last year and a half I've been watching that for a year and a half just laughing and

[41:05] eventually the market will catch up to it and somebody will buy it but you know right now it's

[41:10] not there you know I just had a good friend of mine he's owned a game here he he was a second owner

[41:17] of a big bang bar that came from the factory on the remake sold it I'm not gonna say for how much

[41:22] it doesn't really matter the point is he sold it to another friend of mine and kept it in the family

[41:26] right well one just sold I think it was Rockland pinball sold there is which is a really nice machine

[41:31] I saw it at Allentown and I think they sold it for like 16 grand which was probably one of the

[41:37] that's about in the average right yeah I mean I like I think that I don't want it I mean basic factory

[41:44] not a whole bunch of garbage on it and stuff or anything there's um I don't know I think with the

[41:49] the there's a there's definitely a surplus of machines coming now right and I think stuff that

[41:55] out of certain titles right now here's the interesting thing can I did you got to think about

[42:00] in the last five years the number of machines that are available of I mean every time every year

[42:09] a year goes by less machines that were originally produced disappear they always do and that's

[42:15] very important for the market okay so there's not a lot it's a can pretty much a stabilized I

[42:22] mean I'm working with a there's a distributor broker dealer I'd normally deal with in Colorado

[42:29] he I mean from their standpoint as a seller it's going like gang bag still is didn't slow down

[42:35] from Christmas isn't a Christmas sales you know people all buy Adams family during Halloween

[42:40] you know it's yeah that kind of crazy stuff my my point that is is the the market is is is not

[42:48] you know flooded with used machines it's very steady right now people buying people are selling

[42:53] you know in five years when it comes to certain titles which you're what you've been seeing is

[42:58] all these games from the 90s these ones that top 10 that everybody wants you know the scared

[43:03] stuff the copycats right the correct it's they're disappearing slowly and the reason why is the

[43:09] imports dried up in 2005 okay so what you have is what was made you know there's like for example

[43:16] there's only 7000 white waters that are out there floating in the wild that means only 7000 people

[43:22] are can own one and we all know that 7000 white waters don't exist anymore because well one it was

[43:28] over 20 years ago second of all is their thing games have been lost right games have been used up

[43:34] so it gets harder and harder to find certain titles but when it comes to the stuff that's

[43:39] sterns made since 1999 that's the stuff that you see on the market readily right or really old

[43:46] stuff that's like the EMS that have been sitting on somebody's basement for 20 years but

[43:51] but a lot of these like middle ground collectible pins they're getting hard to find especially in

[43:57] nice shape because what happens is they get traded back and forth between collector to collector

[44:02] I if you want to hear a funny joke I'll let you in on a secret I restored obviously games for a long

[44:08] time when I restored game I used to sell games periodically not not as a distributor just just buy

[44:14] and sell games that are out of my private collection because I did what was called back to the

[44:19] collector point how do you break into the hobby right you call it the buy restore resell buy

[44:25] okay and you increase the quality of your collection as you sell off your crap okay and it's

[44:33] it's it's and it comes in it goes slowly it isn't a rapid I dropped $90,000 on eight brand new

[44:40] stern machines in one year now that is very common right now which we see people do that we see a

[44:46] lot of people do that but the problem is is in about three years they don't know how to change

[44:50] a fuse and their games don't work they end up trying to sell for a loss or equal that they put

[44:55] $3,000 a mod in them that's a different topic altogether the point that I'm trying to make is

[45:02] if you want to go to direction of of collecting if you set the budget and you and you work up to it

[45:08] and you make your networking as friends and local collectors because everybody wants to help

[45:12] you're gonna be on a fast track for greatness as long as you don't get on Craigslist and buy

[45:17] everything you see right that which is another trap and there's a lot when I made that mistake I

[45:23] mean I think everyone who's who's new to sort of awakening to the notion that I want to put like a

[45:31] game room in my house right people get really anxious that they want to fill that space as quick as

[45:37] possible and you get you get totally housed if you rush in that way and I I got housed not really

[45:44] in the pinball market because I actually got really lucky with my first pen I bought a homie's

[45:48] only Lord of the Rings Ellie from a nice gentleman and and it was it was men it I mean luckily

[45:54] yeah as it should be the guy put it in this house he played it a few times took care of it the limits

[45:59] and he moved it on when you got the chance right but when I went into the when I collected some video

[46:05] games it was a different story yeah that market's a little different I used to be involved in that too

[46:11] yeah and then you get like a dicey descriptions of stuff you know I got a mint tron the tron's

[46:16] men the tron's men trust me tron tron shows up and like it's not your work to lie balls that that

[46:24] the only you know we I owe everybody's always said it don't buy off eBay or don't buy off a Craigslist

[46:30] don't buy off the internet you know what that's crap okay if you if you know who you're buying from

[46:35] and you know people say it photos are everything we know that okay if a guy wants I make the jokes

[46:42] because we always see you know big Craigslist laughs and stuff look if if you get a guy that takes

[46:47] pictures that has books stacked on his game and there's glare from the windows and you know and

[46:53] it's it looks like the guy has Tourette syndrome with the camera and he doesn't want to give you any

[46:58] other photos don't buy it okay don't even bother to look at it I it might be the best thing since

[47:04] slice bread but if you can't evaluate it are you really going to waste your time that's where you

[47:10] reach out to other collectors if you have a network you go hey man I know you're like two hours

[47:16] away can you go buy and check that game out for me they'll do it right right and guess what you'd

[47:22] save yourself hours of driving and you didn't get disappointed and you're not sitting there trying

[47:27] to hang off for a piece of junk right now I think it's a great point I mean when I bought

[47:32] my tells the Arabian Knights actually came from Canada and so I didn't have anyone who could

[47:37] scope it out the the the things you know I learned a lesson to and I bought this one because

[47:43] the guy had put a new CPR gold play field and rebuilt the whole play field and yeah

[47:49] game looks beautiful I mean brass everything but underneath the play field he didn't really

[47:55] restore anything yeah in shop he didn't even shop it no so there there was like and luckily for

[48:01] me though I you know Eddie Kramer who lives or you know locally in New York is a great guy I mean

[48:07] Eddie restores games Eddie can pick up a play field and and and see everything that needs to be

[48:14] changed on it he's also very meticulous so he looked at it and he's like oh my god we need to change

[48:17] this this is this so I haven't working on some stuff but you know the game works it's not

[48:24] shopped out completely the the lot like the big projects were done but it was really frustrating

[48:30] though is the guy rebuilt the whole play field and he didn't put plastic protectors which would have

[48:35] been so easy to do some people don't I know it's easy you know I always look at this way don't

[48:41] get me wrong guys I mean if you want there are plenty diamonds in the rough okay and if you can

[48:47] find one at a what I consider to be a reasonable cost I mean don't pay retail or dealer price for

[48:52] a diamond and the rough that needs work but there's nothing wrong I mean yes there's a level

[48:58] it goes back to that owner versus collector thing I said at the beginning you know at this point

[49:03] like in my life I don't accept games that are routed player games because I've probably already owned

[49:09] them before I use in some case I've had two or three copies of the same title sometimes I regret

[49:15] selling them because they get harder to of course find in the same condition but if you're coming

[49:19] into this hobby you should not be sit I mean there's a lot of people that are so infaticant like

[49:23] I've got to have a brand new game and it's not because they're worried exclusively about maintenance

[49:29] they you know they feel the need that they've got to have this brand new thing but then they forget

[49:33] it's like hey it's pinball are you gonna have fun with it does it work right I mean do you have

[49:39] broken ramps I mean if the game works well and it plays well and it's just dirty who cares

[49:49] right yeah have fun have fun fix it I mean it cleaning a game is nothing I used to buy

[49:56] unshopped games all the time from brokers and dealers not for resale I'm not a flipper I don't do that

[50:04] I if if I bought one I said look this is what I'm looking for the best thing about it is if you

[50:08] network long enough and you stick around in the hobby I can call up a dealer and say this is what

[50:13] I'm looking for do you have one and I don't even have to tell them what I'm looking for in terms

[50:19] of quality they all know right so you just they say nope sorry we don't have anything like that

[50:25] and it's that simple now you have to it takes time because honestly that's where this goes

[50:31] in a direction it's like okay are you a general interest guy that's passing through that you

[50:37] enjoy pinball and you want to have one machine in your you know den or do you want to have a stable

[50:43] lineup of herd of games right and I you know and you know it I'm not here to be a show you know

[50:50] showboat I don't I don't think I've had any well I've had a few friends of course that are

[50:54] collectors over to my house but you know I don't have open houses like to I'm not I'm not you know

[50:59] Dave pack you know he's got a fantastic collectionist in you know in New Zealand you know I there

[51:06] there are a number of collectors that have regular open houses which is fantastic I go to them

[51:11] um but you have to set the bar about where you're going in collecting and if you

[51:19] overstep that bar which is very easy to do we talked about that earlier

[51:24] you're on a slippery slope because I was helping a guy recently that I helped to get into the hobby

[51:29] about 15 years ago he lives up near Tacoma and it overtook his life and he was married okay and he

[51:37] had machines in every orifice of his house I mean he had you know he had this he had what was

[51:42] called the the pinball barn shed and it was full of games and his garage was full of games and his

[51:49] basement was full of games and his living was full of games you know once you you you got to start

[51:55] out small you you know even if you're buying brand new games it get by your first game I'm a very

[52:03] I'm a huge guy when it comes to the tech side my whole key is whatever game you buy it doesn't matter

[52:11] what era would age new inbox used learn how it works Ben Hack would make a wonderful tech guy to

[52:22] teach on how to repair pinball machines if he chose to choose there there's other guys on the

[52:26] internet and YouTube that did it he would be fun to watch just because you know he's a hoot right

[52:32] right yeah he doesn't have time I know he's a busy man but you know if you learn how to fix

[52:39] and just understand how the game works right I'm not asking you have to learn how to do circuit

[52:44] theory and board repair but if you understand how to you know change out for example coil sleeves

[52:51] on your flippers basic maintenance understand troubleshooting switches or making switch adjustments

[52:57] you know keeping the game clean you know learning how to make sure you because here's the bottom

[53:02] line it always says when it comes to collecting if you buy a pinball machine and I and unlike the

[53:08] arcade market which is different you know it is it is it can be cutthroat at times like pinball

[53:15] but and you know this more than me I used to have a very large collection of arcade I was a

[53:20] gun shooter guy I like exity games crack shot chiller shy and combat you know crossbow

[53:30] those pass by the wayside and pinball continues to increase in value at a much more rapid rate

[53:35] than arcade because it you know he can be emulated in some cases not always right I mean can't have

[53:41] the full coin off experience like you have in your apartment with your giant control board I think

[53:46] you can't do that with a next block controller it doesn't work but if you hold onto these machines

[53:52] and you take care of them they will always retain their value yeah you never ever and you but the

[53:58] best part about is you can play the game yeah right you know when I tried to get my games

[54:03] insured originally I yeah in my insurance company they boxed because they said well but do you

[54:10] play them and I said well of course I play them and they said well we can't insure them because

[54:15] you use them I said what's the difference between that and the classic car right or cycle and

[54:20] they said in the reason was is they didn't have any appraisers because there is none it doesn't

[54:25] exist in this market it never has that's what causes the market spikes in this in the in the

[54:31] fluctuations in the craziness because there's no checks and balances whether it be at an auction

[54:37] and I'm not talking about eBay we're talking about arcade auctions crags list people can ask whatever

[54:43] they want and then people may say things like the mr. pinball price guide which is extremely valuable

[54:49] only because I don't know it's been around for 26 years okay since he started making with Dana

[54:55] petite and that has a lot of value but that should be your baseline cost of okay the game is in good

[55:02] condition right it works I mean there's another resource there's another answer to your question

[55:08] well where do you go to get a baseline yes you can go to various websites and get pricing

[55:13] information based on auctions but they're always inflated if you go to the mr. pinball price

[55:19] guide or Larry Bezos guide or any of the other ones like the collectors got there's several of

[55:24] them out there some of them that people probably aren't aware of because they're used to going on the

[55:28] web the hard copies of some of these price guides are still extremely valuable because you can go

[55:36] into a place and you can see where the benchmark is set because they track trends increases in price

[55:44] numbers of machines that are available roughly and production numbers those information in

[55:50] itself can be available because a person that goes on I don't know I don't want to sound overly

[55:56] negative but like if a guy says on Craigslist why I've seen this machine sell for $11,000 there

[56:01] was a fun house that was here in the Pacific Northwest the guy says you know I his was listed at

[56:08] $49.95 I'm kind of big sometimes not really liking this stuff but it says well you know the

[56:16] average I've seen machines like this sell for $6,500 to $11,000 and in the particular not

[56:24] not the quote his own game it had some you know various issues it was not worth $49.95 for a fun

[56:30] house but I'm sorry I haven't seen an $11,000 fun house yet okay and I've seen some pretty high

[56:36] ones like 95 I mean it's probably what he paid for it I don't know I don't know I don't

[56:42] know I don't ask me if it was one I wouldn't pay $9,500 for fun house even if it was a brand new

[56:48] NOS play field fully deco I mean I know what I'm looking for and yes they have sold for over 10

[56:54] but the high end restorations those were insane right I mean it was somebody saying please

[56:59] restore my game and yes the big cost if you're not familiar if you want a game repaired in your

[57:06] home or you want somebody to restore your game it's a 90 to $110 an hour wow I always feel like

[57:13] two some of these and you know these I mean like heaven the high end you know restoration jobs

[57:20] it probably is a point that you spend so much risk if you go too high in on the restore you probably

[57:24] don't even want to play the pinball machine it's it's yeah that's why I made the joke about the

[57:29] Big Bang bar when my friend offered me to buy it again he's like hey you want to buy it I'm like no

[57:32] I have to put it in like a time right or something and never play it it is high but I mean some

[57:39] people money doesn't matter and that's okay you know my point is is that's your baby and trust me

[57:44] there's that's okay you know everybody has a favorite game or favorite nostalgia memory and if

[57:49] that's your game and you want it to be perfect and you can't find one that's better and you want

[57:54] to spend the money that makes sense to me it's just like a classic car right definitely but you

[57:59] know don't kick yourself in the head later when you realize that you spent $6,000 of storing a

[58:04] game and that's really only worth eight right right I think I think I think you know I think the key

[58:10] to is you know and we were we've been saying this like in different ways is you know if the end

[58:16] result isn't you're having fun then you're doing something wrong but see a lot of people do that

[58:22] they kind of like oh my god what did I do but it's already too late all right and and that's where

[58:27] you know you get a lot of people sometimes they fall in hard times to which I hate I cringe when

[58:33] I see a large collector friend of mine and he starts to empty out his collection because of hard

[58:37] times because I've even helped buy machines to hold on to him I don't even I'm like look you want

[58:43] to buy it back for me you buy it for whatever I paid in its yours again I'll hold on depends and

[58:48] put them in storage I don't have enough space in my house anyway for everything I own I don't I don't

[58:53] have a Argentuan general warehouse that I do you know I mean it just doesn't happen so but I I mean

[58:58] I don't like that so you know I just I keep saying it don't don't overstep your bounds because

[59:06] once you start dropping a lot of money in this hobby and you don't have the tech background to

[59:12] keep them running and it doesn't matter if they're new or they're old let's let's talk about

[59:17] one simple universal fact in one sentence the define when it comes to pinball things will always

[59:24] go wrong okay it's pinball it's mechanical it's electronic it's a very complex device it's

[59:32] more complex than a car it's more complex than a motorcycle it doesn't matter if it's modern solid

[59:37] state or an EM by the way EMs are actually simpler to understand the most modern machines because

[59:42] you don't have to understand a electrical circuit theory but the point that I'm trying to make is they

[59:47] aren't complicated devices and they will break down so if you have no background whatsoever and you

[59:53] can't even change a fuse you're probably putting yourself in a pickle right right now in your

[59:59] right because they're expensive so my my Lord the Rings I had a Steve Zellor over from modern pinball

[01:00:06] he did like a marathon game on it for two hours the left flipper broke we turned it back on the

[01:00:12] whole thing started smoking yeah mad sign yeah we couldn't die shut down quick yeah we shut down

[01:00:19] quick then the DMD went out and then you know we were on the phone with Stern eventually the game

[01:00:24] had to be picked up to get repaired because I had to have someone but that's pinball that's pinball

[01:00:30] I think I mean it people that believe that it's supposed to work like a brand new car I mean I'm not

[01:00:36] I'm not gonna go down the route like when you receive it new in box I know your opinions on that

[01:00:39] matter but I'm different okay I bought I mean when I worked start work as a technician back in

[01:00:46] the early 90s and I put these games out new in box and we had to do burn-ins on them and we had

[01:00:51] the check them and we had to adjust things I mean the factories aren't perfect these are not these

[01:00:56] are commercial industrial devices that they do a good job for the most part of the factory but

[01:01:01] this is not a car okay it's different it's more complex than a car so you know you have more

[01:01:08] things that can go wrong and it's not just things like I'm not talking about wrinkle decals either

[01:01:12] I'm talking about major issues what I think but I think the point you're making though is right so

[01:01:17] and I think it's a lesson that everyone who's listened to this podcast who was on Pinsider

[01:01:21] other forums should do if you're gonna buy a new in box pinball machine and you don't have just

[01:01:27] fundamental knowledge on how to do some of the things you were describing you really yeah you

[01:01:33] oh oh ask because I just saw I just saw it like today pans are free because super excited to

[01:01:39] finally get his hobbit new in box opens it up and there's like a few issues and we see that time

[01:01:46] and again right the guy and they but it's like this you know there's like that immediate sort of

[01:01:52] you know a little bit of a panic that oh my god my rollover switches are like a fraction of a

[01:01:57] centimeter too high oh my god this you know and yeah and these guys are like and it's that's

[01:02:03] why I just I just hate it when people like are in pain because they can't fix their new toy it's

[01:02:09] it's one of the one of the biggest challenges though with that is this it's called the sour taste

[01:02:14] okay when you get a new collector doesn't it doesn't matter what I mean use game new game doesn't

[01:02:20] matter they get at home just like I said and it doesn't work right what is their first reaction

[01:02:25] I never want to have pinball again right and and unfortunately that's what I'm trying to personally

[01:02:30] avoid as a collector and trying to help people because I said look you know I'm not I don't expect

[01:02:35] people to have like this ridiculous amount of technical knowledge and understanding all this

[01:02:40] but if they're if they're intimidated or they you know they they don't have any of that basic knowledge

[01:02:48] you know they're gonna they're gonna quit the hobby I've seen it over and over again because they

[01:02:52] get frustrated but but I'm here to tell you that there's plenty of help out there okay we're

[01:02:58] granted now you know I there's no joke as I tell my friends the ones you know that say holy shit

[01:03:04] you own pinballs you know the new ones they're like I don't know you could own those in your house

[01:03:07] you know the old joke and stuff and I said well yeah I've been doing this for like over a quarter

[01:03:11] century and and they said well you know wow that's just I can't understand this I mean it's incomprehensible

[01:03:20] I mean I don't have them in my bedroom but hey I mean that's the best place to have them

[01:03:26] I gotta keep them out my my significant other and I'm not married right now I don't think

[01:03:30] she would necessarily approve in my house so I'm gonna keep it away but you know it's it's tough

[01:03:35] because you know from their perspective once you realize that you can own a pinball machine

[01:03:39] your first step would should be hey what can I learn to help me educate myself not only on how to buy

[01:03:46] one but also how to fix it and those two things with your budget will get you on a fast track and

[01:03:52] then go to a show hey if you got a local show there's a great place to meet new collectors so I think

[01:03:57] black night this is a good place for us to hit stop on our first inaugural interview with

[01:04:05] the black night because I think this is a these are great great lessons that I really did want the

[01:04:10] first chat to be helpful information for those people who are who are new to the hobby because I'll

[01:04:17] say this to a lot of us and I put myself in this category we may be on pinside for two to three

[01:04:23] years but we're not really learning and so they move on right so it's important that we we and look

[01:04:31] I think everyone has more than enough time because I see how much people post on that site

[01:04:37] to educate themselves on the on the the actual thing they're talking about every day more often so

[01:04:45] this has been great so I hope we can do this again because we've already got a few other topics

[01:04:49] teed up for future episodes if if your game on game because I think this is this is really good

[01:04:55] and this is really fun pinball is thriving let it continue okay I mean I know that I'm watching it

[01:05:00] it's great it's the best revival we've had since the early 90s yeah period I mean we haven't I

[01:05:07] haven't seen this since two are nineteen ninety three ninety four right and it's and 2016 2017

[01:05:13] if all the rumors of what we know is coming out are true I think it's just going to keep getting

[01:05:17] more and more exciting so black night I want to thank you for joining canators pinball podcasts and

[01:05:22] we're going to do this again real soon no problem a good one all right so that was the black night

[01:05:27] ladies and gentlemen a man who's been in this hobby for a really long time so I think everything he

[01:05:33] says comes with added wisdom that we should all listen to I'm not saying that a lot of people are

[01:05:39] going to learn or really pay attention to some of the things he's recommending especially the part

[01:05:44] about playing machines before you buy them I still think people are going to be taken over by their

[01:05:49] emotions in fact I was just reading the alien thread and people are going in on a pre-order paid

[01:05:56] in full why you can get your money back you don't have to pay in full and it just goes to show

[01:06:01] that there's just some people that will just be 100 percent of motion on their decisions and I'm

[01:06:06] not saying they're wrong but the opportunity to get burned is there and I think if we all just

[01:06:13] took a step back and we're a little bit more patient the marketplace would settle down more

[01:06:19] and and people would spend more time educating themselves on the games that they have

[01:06:23] and and the market in general so great advice from the black night I look forward to talking to him

[01:06:28] again I want to hear the story about Big Bang Bar I want to go over some other topics with him as well

[01:06:34] and if you haven't have any topics you'd like for us to discuss uh Canadian the black night just

[01:06:41] email me at canada pimbal at gmail.com that's k-a-n-e-d-a pimbal at gmail.com have a great day later

[01:06:49] from hinoughman
