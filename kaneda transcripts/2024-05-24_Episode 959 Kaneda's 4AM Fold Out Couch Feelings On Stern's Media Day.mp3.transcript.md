[00:00] Alright, no intro music required.

[00:02] This is like old school, Canada.

[00:04] I'm holding the mic in my hand.

[00:06] It's almost four o'clock in the morning.

[00:08] I'm on paternity leave and I've got some thoughts.

[00:11] And the reason why I don't want to do the intro music is once I hear that Canada theme

[00:15] song, it just triggers me and I have to start screaming about everything.

[00:18] Pinball.

[00:19] But I want to give you my thoughts after looking at some of these photos from the Stern Media

[00:24] Tour.

[00:25] And look, I'm happy everybody got to go there.

[00:27] They look like they had a really good time.

[00:29] It looked like it was a huge day touring the facility.

[00:33] It looked like a lot of fun going to the different arcades like in Chicago area, getting into

[00:38] the tour bus with Gary Stern.

[00:41] And you're just hanging out with pinball people like I've always said.

[00:44] The most valuable thing in this entire hobby are the friends you're going to make.

[00:49] I was telling Brenda tonight, I was like, some of my best friends in the entire world,

[00:54] I've met through this hobby and this hobby has always provided me so much enjoyment because

[01:00] of the people.

[01:01] The products are ancillary to where the real value lies.

[01:06] And I think that's what I love to see when people go over to a place like Stern and they

[01:10] get to meet the people and they get to hang out and have great conversations about the

[01:14] thing they love.

[01:15] And that's the other part about this beautiful hobby.

[01:18] It's very niche.

[01:19] So when you hang out with other people that love it, it really does put a smile on your

[01:25] face.

[01:26] So I'm happy that all those people got to go there.

[01:28] I'm happy that they got to tour the facility.

[01:31] I heard it was mind boggling big.

[01:34] Like it is so big.

[01:36] And I'm like, yep, it's got to be big because they're going to have to store all those John

[01:39] Wicks.

[01:40] That's the thing about this whole thing.

[01:42] This whole thing is calculated.

[01:44] This whole thing is happening for a reason.

[01:48] Stern Pinball is not selling this game.

[01:51] And so why do you think they're bringing in all of these people?

[01:55] Now look, I know I'll joke and say it's shillapalooza and they're just bringing in media to turn

[02:01] them into spokespeople for Stern.

[02:03] And I just want to say this.

[02:04] Do I think Stern Pinball will use people to get them to say nice things about their company

[02:11] and their products?

[02:12] Yes, it's what all companies do when they bring people over, when they fly you on and

[02:17] all expense paid trip.

[02:19] Now normally media will have to disclose all of that, but no one's really disclosing anything

[02:24] because as we all know, there really is no such thing as pinball media.

[02:29] But look, everyone's having a good time.

[02:30] But this whole thing is so thinly veiled as an attempt by this company to sell these

[02:36] games.

[02:37] And remember, if they really, really, really wanted to do this right and get all of these

[02:42] pinball personalities to see John Wick, to see the LE, the foil cabinet, and by the way,

[02:49] as grown men, can we stop being so impressed by shiny stickers that go on a $13,000 pinball

[02:57] machine?

[02:58] It is not that expensive to put shiny stickers on a $13,000 game.

[03:05] Little kids go up to those machines at the supermarkets and with a single quarter get

[03:10] shiny stickers.

[03:11] We act like anything that shines is diamonds and gold in the world of pinball and it's

[03:17] not.

[03:18] But if they really wanted to do it right, Zack Sharp would have done this before the

[03:23] game came out.

[03:24] So when the game launched in that little week in which Stern needs all of that FOMO to sell

[03:30] their products, they would have had all those smiling faces putting up content sort of advocating

[03:37] for people to buy the LEs and the premiums and understand everything that went into making

[03:42] John Wick.

[03:43] They didn't do that.

[03:44] You know what that tells me?

[03:46] They didn't want to do that.

[03:48] This whole thing is basically Stern Panic Tour round three because of the lack of John

[03:55] Wick sales and that's it to me.

[03:57] I don't care how big your facilities are.

[04:00] I don't care what goes into licensing.

[04:02] I don't care what goes into wiring harnesses.

[04:04] I don't really care because what I care about is the final product.

[04:08] When you put the final product in front of me, do I see the value in it?

[04:14] Is it to me worth this much money?

[04:17] And look, for certain games and certain themes, Stern Pinball knocks it out of the park.

[04:22] This is not a company that makes a lot of failures.

[04:25] Stern Pinball hasn't had to do this because they've made the best pinball in all of pinball

[04:31] and nobody would argue with that.

[04:32] Their success indicates that.

[04:34] And I don't hate Stern Pinball.

[04:36] I've hated some of the moves they've made but it's not personal.

[04:40] But they absolutely have made some very greedy moves and they absolutely turn their back

[04:46] on all the collectors that kept them in business all these years.

[04:51] Absolutely.

[04:52] And you can't overlook that with an all expense paid media tour.

[04:55] Now look, those that will overlook it got an invite and those that won't overlook it

[05:01] didn't get an invite.

[05:02] And that's my other thing.

[05:04] When you do something like this, it doesn't really get you anywhere because you're just

[05:08] inviting in the people that are already praising you and you're not changing minds, right?

[05:15] You're not changing anybody's mind.

[05:17] There's nobody that went over there that deconstructs Stern Pinball the way I do, the way other

[05:22] people do on other podcasts and YouTube channels that did not get invited.

[05:27] So they've done absolutely nothing in changing the minds of any of those people.

[05:32] And I will say this and I mean this as I look down at all my subscribers and all the people

[05:37] that are on my Facebook page, there's more people paying attention to what we're doing

[05:41] in the Canada community than a lot of the other content creators that have always said

[05:46] very nice things about Stern.

[05:47] And look, that's great.

[05:49] Like I'm happy people are happy.

[05:51] I'm not here to reign on anybody's parade, but I'm just saying all of this.

[05:57] Some seeing is so obviously thinly veiled as a last ditch effort to sell these John

[06:04] Wick machines.

[06:05] And if this game was selling great on day one, this media tour never happens.

[06:12] And it's just that simple.

[06:14] When Stern is doing successful work and the games are flying off the shelves, they don't

[06:18] want anything to do with these media people.

[06:21] They're not inviting them in.

[06:22] They're not paying for their trips.

[06:24] They don't care.

[06:25] It's only when they're Delta Blow and they have a game that's not moving.

[06:29] Now all of a sudden they care.

[06:32] And some people have very low thresholds for what they're willing to do for the money.

[06:38] Look, and I think there's a combination of people there.

[06:40] I think there's real journalists like Jason Knapp who's going to cover this thing the

[06:44] right way.

[06:45] Like when you read Knapp's arcade, he covers this stuff the right way.

[06:50] Yes.

[06:51] Is he having a good time over there?

[06:52] Absolutely.

[06:53] Yes.

[06:54] Is he dealing with the Stern employees over there?

[06:56] Absolutely.

[06:57] But best believe you're not going to see Jason Knapp be like, I just ordered an LE.

[07:01] Like it's just not going to happen.

[07:02] I think you might see that behavior from some of the other people over there because all

[07:06] it takes is a little shiny cabinet and having a good night with people and drinking beers.

[07:11] And hey, who amongst us hasn't got drunk and then made a silly purchase decision?

[07:17] But here's the bigger damage in all of this.

[07:20] Is that Stern is doing this in a moment of their weakness.

[07:25] And now what they're going to do is they're going to win people over and get them to think

[07:30] twice about saying how they really feel about a Stern machine when Stern releases another

[07:37] overpriced game in the future.

[07:39] That's the point of this tour.

[07:41] Zach Sharp probably should have done this long ago before Stern Pimbal raised its prices

[07:46] so significantly, but he didn't.

[07:49] But look, better late than never, right?

[07:51] In the world of marketing, better late than never.

[07:53] But all of this to me doesn't matter.

[07:55] At the end of the day, Stern Pimbal needs to convince you.

[07:59] They need to convince thousands of people out there that the products they make are worth

[08:05] this much money.

[08:06] And at the end of everybody's day, I don't know how you're feeling, but people are stressed.

[08:11] People are finding themselves in a financial situation now that's not as favorable as it

[08:17] was in 2019.

[08:20] And so if you look at where Pimbal prices have gone since COVID, we're at a significant

[08:25] increase in price, almost 40% increase for the price of an LE since 2019.

[08:32] People's wages haven't gone up 40%.

[08:34] And I understand that other things in life have gone up in price.

[08:37] But come on, everybody, be smart.

[08:40] Stern saw what was happening during COVID.

[08:42] They saw the overwhelming demand and they adjusted their prices.

[08:47] They far overshot that with stuff like James Bond's 60th for $20,000 with all these $2,000

[08:54] toppers by making more Jurassic Park anniversary editions.

[08:58] And that's the thing that has me concerned right now because I think the other real reason

[09:03] why Stern invited these people over, it's not even about John Wick.

[09:08] I think they know that John Wick is dead on arrival.

[09:12] It's never going to catch on.

[09:13] It's never going to be the next James Bond everybody wake up.

[09:16] James Bond has 60 years of fandom.

[09:20] This game will never have a turnaround like that.

[09:22] I think the real reason these people are there is because of the next move that's going to

[09:27] happen from Stern Pimbal.

[09:29] I think the next move that's going to happen is going to be a vault, most likely of Metallica.

[09:34] I said it first, June, July Metallica, okay?

[09:37] And I think they know when they go back to the well.

[09:41] And if it's not a vault of Metallica, it's going to be a Godzilla anniversary edition,

[09:46] which Jason Knapp reported.

[09:47] Now look, I had originally reported Godzilla, Ellie, black and white, right?

[09:52] With like a green Godzilla, Allah, Elvira.

[09:55] And I think they shelved that for a while, but it is the 70th anniversary of Godzilla.

[10:01] And so the reason why I think they brought these people in now is they know if they go

[10:05] back to either the Metallica well or the Godzilla well, they're going to piss off so many people.

[10:12] I think they're going to do something a little sleazy.

[10:14] Here's why, because they went on the record and said they're never making more Ellies.

[10:19] Okay, so what happens though, if Stern Pimbal makes a nicer version of a Metallica Ellie or

[10:26] a Godzilla Ellie, they make a nicer version than that game and they don't call it in Ellie.

[10:32] And they say something like, well, we're going to do one run of premiums on this game.

[10:38] And here's the new version of the premium, but it's one run, right?

[10:43] It's really easy to use semantics and create a new Ellie based upon the fact that you're

[10:49] not going to make it forever.

[10:50] They could call it like Godzilla last run premium 70th anniversary edition.

[10:56] That's all they got to do.

[10:57] As long as they don't number each game, it will technically not be limited by nature.

[11:04] And they could do the same thing with Metallica.

[11:06] But I think the real reason these people are there, they're going to go back to the vault.

[11:10] And when they go back to the vault, they're going to piss off all the old owners.

[11:14] And yes, that is exciting when they vault a game for the newbies.

[11:18] So the newbies don't have to spend the astronomical prices on some of these games.

[11:23] As I look at a Metallica Ellie listed for $16,000.

[11:28] That game brand new was $6,000, right?

[11:33] The second hand market on that game has gone up almost $10,000.

[11:37] And all of that will evaporate the moment Stern makes a nicer game.

[11:43] And you could argue, I'm not selling mine.

[11:45] I love the game.

[11:46] It doesn't matter.

[11:47] You can't go to bed at night.

[11:48] If you spend $6,000 on a game and you know it's now worth like $15,000, $16,000 on the

[11:55] second hand market, you can't tell me that you're not going to bed at night realizing

[12:01] what value you have.

[12:03] Beyond just the fact that it's fun to play.

[12:05] And if you lose all of that value in the machine because they're making more, you can't tell

[12:10] me that's not a little bit upsetting that you could have sold your machine for $16,000

[12:16] had you known, right?

[12:17] It's like insider trading.

[12:18] Like I'm going to tell you now is the time you should sell it because you can always

[12:22] buy it back for much cheaper.

[12:24] And that's where we are in all the pinball people.

[12:27] Everyone has to be a little bit of a market speculator unless you're super loaded and none

[12:31] of this matters.

[12:32] Yes, those people are out there and some of you are listening to this right now and I

[12:36] love your freedom.

[12:37] If you have enough money, you are free from everything.

[12:40] You can do whatever you want whenever you want to do it.

[12:43] Now, will Stern Pinball be able to attract enough of those people to keep this company

[12:48] going to sell a thousand of these games?

[12:51] So look, a really exciting time in pinball.

[12:54] I'm not bitter about any of this.

[12:56] Someone sent me a screenshot of Andrew McBain, you know, the guy with like pinball adventures,

[13:02] ragging on me.

[13:03] I haven't even thought about this guy in like months.

[13:05] He's blocked by the way from my Facebook page and from this podcast.

[13:08] He used to be a member and how butthurt I was that I wasn't at Stern today.

[13:13] Let me tell you what I did today, Andrew McBain.

[13:15] I changed about eight nappies.

[13:18] I burped my baby about eight times and I looked into his eyes and I saw in my little baby's

[13:24] eyes another person who's not going to buy your products.

[13:28] And look, it just is what it is.

[13:29] I have more subscribers than he will ever sell of pinball machines.

[13:34] So don't lecture anybody on what it takes to manufacture a product because I'll tell

[13:38] you this.

[13:39] There's a lot of people who make stuff.

[13:41] There's a lot of people who film movies.

[13:43] There's a lot of people who record songs.

[13:45] And there's a lot of people who have no talent.

[13:48] And even though they do all that stuff, the world is trying to tell them to stop doing

[13:52] it.

[13:53] The best part is what he's like, Stern is going to sue you.

[13:54] No, they're not.

[13:55] Stern doesn't sue people.

[13:56] You do.

[13:57] That's that, ladies and gentlemen.

[13:59] To put a bow around this, I'm happy everybody had a good time over there.

[14:03] I think it's a thinly veiled, a day late and a dollar short invite for these individuals.

[14:09] And I think the whole thing is engineered to get these people to say nice things about

[14:14] Stern as Stern's about to do another move that's going to piss off more people.

[14:20] And I think they know that John Wick sales are never going to really turn around.

[14:25] And that's that.

[14:26] One look, $13,000, $10,000 for unlimited premiums.

[14:31] We all know these prices are too high.

[14:34] And I don't care how big the factory is.

[14:36] I don't care what they show us.

[14:37] They were able to make a profit on all of these games when the prices were so much cheaper.

[14:43] And there's no way the cost of them doing business has gone up this much.

[14:47] The same thing is happening to McDonald's and other places.

[14:51] They got greedy and consumers are pushing back.

[14:54] Stern could lower the prices by $2,000 a game and still be very profitable and still create

[15:01] a win-win for its dealers and its distros.

[15:03] And we all know that because if you're passing on those margins to the dealers and the distros,

[15:09] you don't want to have everybody saying, well, why do we even need that?

[15:11] Why can I just buy directly from Stern?

[15:14] The world's getting very expensive people and people are going to start buckling down

[15:18] and only spending their money on things they truly need.

[15:23] And I think that's going to be the really interesting part about 2024 and 2025.

[15:28] If people are getting pinched everywhere, if they're still going to want to buy stuff for

[15:32] this much money, Killian just woke up.

[15:34] I got to put him back to bed.

[15:36] Love you guys.

[15:37] Good night.

[15:38] It did it again!

[15:39] It's going to bring you down!

[15:40] Come!

[15:41] Some people coming more recent.

[15:42] It's making the whole thing.
