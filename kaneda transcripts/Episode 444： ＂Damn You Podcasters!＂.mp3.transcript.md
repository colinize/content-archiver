[00:00] We were singing by by the sun, American, high oversharing to the living, let the living was dry

[00:07] And the lower voice was making whiskey by singing this will be the day that I die

[00:15] This will be the day that I die

[00:18] Let's say it, let's say it, let's say it, let's say it, let's say it, let's say it, let's say it, let's say it

[00:23] All right, so let me get this straight in the span of one week

[00:28] We hear that head-to-head pinball, special win-lit, and this weekend pinball are no longer going to do their podcasts

[00:37] And we also hear from pinball supernova that he's gone supernova and wants completely out of the hobby as well

[00:45] I'm as shocked as you guys are

[00:48] And people have been hitting me up over the weekend, you know, sharing this news, asking when I'm going to do a show

[00:54] and respond to this whole thing going down

[00:56] I've been a little preoccupied, it was Brenda's sister's 21st birthday, her parents were in town

[01:03] So family took over my weekend, but you know, here we are, it's a chilly night in New York City

[01:08] And I want to talk to you and share my thoughts about what has gone down in the pinball podcasting landscape

[01:16] And this news, first let me just say, on a very like, if I zoom out and just look at this news

[01:22] This news sucks, like it sucks that three of the greatest pinball podcasts that have been on the airwaves

[01:31] are no longer going to be doing podcasts in the way we know them to do their podcasts

[01:36] And I know for many of you out there, you listen to a lot of these shows

[01:40] I mean, I listen to a lot of these shows, I love hearing all the different pinball podcasts that are out there

[01:46] And I love tuning in and checking them out

[01:49] And for many of us, we've grown just accustomed to these shows

[01:55] And when their content becomes available, so maybe it's every Monday

[01:59] You expect a new this week in pinball podcasts

[02:02] Or you expect a new head to head pinball podcasts

[02:04] And then every week you expect a new special when lit pinball podcasts

[02:09] And now those are going away

[02:11] And what are my thoughts?

[02:13] Why do I think they're going away?

[02:15] And what does this mean for the pinball podcasting landscape moving forward

[02:21] And what do I think these gentlemen are going to do in the future

[02:25] Because as you know, they love pinball so much

[02:28] I do not think this is the last we're going to hear from any of those personalities

[02:33] That have announced they're going to stop their shows now

[02:35] Look, I've done 444 podcasts about pinball

[02:40] I think I know what it's like to get burnt out

[02:43] I think I know what it's like to reach a point

[02:46] In which you start to question what you're doing

[02:49] And start to wonder and reflect

[02:51] Is this worth it?

[02:53] Am I still enjoying this?

[02:55] You know, I can't tell you the specific reasons why

[02:59] Someone is ready to hang up their show

[03:01] Or stop doing something that they have been doing for a while

[03:05] But I can tell you the reason why everyone begins to create pinball content

[03:10] And it's simple, we all love pinball

[03:13] And it's a lot of fun to create your own pinball content

[03:18] And it's not for everyone

[03:20] And not everyone is great at it

[03:22] But for the shows I've mentioned

[03:25] These are shows with big followings

[03:27] These are shows in which the hosts of these shows

[03:30] They created a really great product

[03:33] And I mean that

[03:34] I mean that when I look at Martin

[03:37] And what he accomplished with head to head

[03:39] There's no denying the fact that Martin and Ryan see together

[03:44] Those two were like excellent slash

[03:46] Like they just had a great chemistry

[03:49] And the dynamic between them those two

[03:51] It was irreplaceable

[03:52] It was irreplaceable

[03:53] And for many people out there

[03:56] When Ryan left the show

[03:57] It just was never the same

[03:59] And that's how I kind of felt too

[04:01] And Joe did a good job filling in for Ryan

[04:04] But it just never felt the same again

[04:08] And Martin's a trooper man

[04:10] He just kept making shows

[04:11] He kept giving people content

[04:13] And he loves pinball

[04:15] Without a doubt

[04:16] And I think he'll definitely be back

[04:18] And we're definitely going to hear more from Martin in the future

[04:21] You know Ken and Bill, a special one, lit

[04:23] Those two have a great, great banter

[04:26] And what they're doing with the stream

[04:29] You know and I talked to Ken on an almost daily basis about this stuff

[04:32] I just think those guys

[04:34] Have found something else that they might enjoy doing even more

[04:39] Than podcasting

[04:40] And the stream itself that they put up on Monday nights

[04:43] It just always seems like they're having a ton of fun

[04:47] And they can go live

[04:48] And engage with the community

[04:50] And play pinball

[04:52] And talk to you about playing pinball and the hobby

[04:55] All in real time

[04:56] You don't need show notes

[04:58] You don't have to edit afterwards

[05:01] It's just a good old time for them every Monday night

[05:04] And I'm guessing that that is one of the big reasons why

[05:09] They're deciding to end the podcast

[05:11] But they're going to continue the stream

[05:13] And I fully expect them to make the stream even better

[05:17] And think about new ways in which they can make content like that

[05:21] Even more enjoyable

[05:23] Not just for the viewer but for them too

[05:26] And I've always said this to Ken I'm like man

[05:28] And plus like I watch the stream too

[05:30] And people are donating bids on Twitch

[05:32] And I feel like they're making more money

[05:34] And actually getting more recognition

[05:36] On the stream itself than they do doing the show

[05:40] All right and then you know you have

[05:42] Zach, Zach, Zach to me

[05:45] You know he's up to something

[05:46] We all know this

[05:46] The pinball network is something that I think he's been working on

[05:51] And he's going to come back

[05:53] I fully expected this move from Zach

[05:55] I mean doing the podcast for this week in pinball for Zach

[05:59] Probably was a little bit of a conflict of interest

[06:02] And I think he wants to stand on his own pedestal

[06:06] And create content his way

[06:07] And we know he will

[06:08] We definitely know he will

[06:10] And look, Zach's going to be Zach

[06:13] Martin will be Martin

[06:14] Ken and Bill will be Ken and Bill

[06:17] And that's why

[06:18] That's why these guys have their own followings

[06:21] I think they've always done it their way

[06:24] And I think for each of them

[06:25] I think they reached the point where

[06:27] You know they have their reasons why

[06:29] They want to take it in a different direction

[06:31] Now look, do I think

[06:33] And as some people are looting to that

[06:35] All of this is happening

[06:38] It's not by coincidence that they're all going to collude together

[06:41] And create the ultimate pinball podcast show

[06:44] And all work together

[06:46] No, I don't think it's going to be that at all

[06:49] I think each of them has different styles

[06:51] I think each of them has different creative approaches

[06:54] And I don't think they want to do that

[06:57] I think a lot of this is just like

[06:58] It's a new year

[07:00] It's January

[07:01] It's a time of year in which we all reflect

[07:04] And look back

[07:05] On how we've spent our time over the previous year

[07:09] It's also a time in which we make changes in our lives

[07:12] It's a time in which we come to sort of like a new

[07:15] Conclusion and how we want to spend our time

[07:18] And I just think these guys

[07:19] Individuality

[07:21] All came to the conclusion

[07:23] That they still love pinball

[07:25] And they want to do pinball content

[07:27] Maybe a different way

[07:29] Or maybe just let it go for a while

[07:30] And come back with a new approach

[07:32] That's how I see it

[07:34] I definitely don't look at it as like some

[07:37] Some humongous conspiracy going on

[07:40] In which they're trying to like work together

[07:43] To take over the pinball content world

[07:46] Now look

[07:46] Look, I think too

[07:48] I'm reading on Pinsa

[07:50] There was a threat about this

[07:51] And people say some incredibly nasty stuff about me

[07:55] And I want to just say for the record

[07:58] I don't think this show has contributed to

[08:03] Or been the cause of anyone else's burnout in pinball

[08:08] And you listen to this show on a weekly basis

[08:11] We're not attacking other shows

[08:13] We're not going after other people

[08:15] You know, for me

[08:16] The moments in which I just got tired of doing the show

[08:19] And I had to take breaks and I burnt out

[08:22] Is really when I ended up like in the middle

[08:24] Of like maybe an overly dramatic moment in pinball

[08:28] Where Andrew Highway might have been like threatening to sue me

[08:31] And people might have been sharing with me

[08:33] Inside information on that game

[08:36] And how highway pinball was going under

[08:39] And nobody believed me

[08:40] And then I got so in deep in that story

[08:45] That it just it became no fun

[08:48] Right? It wasn't fun anymore

[08:50] It's not fun when when Jersey Jack calls me a terrible person

[08:54] Or it's not fun when people say I need to shut up about play field issues

[08:58] And you know, and I'm not here

[09:00] I'm not here to not enjoy this

[09:04] I am here on a weekly basis because I enjoy doing the show

[09:08] Like the moment it no longer becomes enjoyable

[09:11] Is also the moment I hang it up

[09:13] Now I love doing this show because of the creative freedom

[09:17] I love doing this show because there usually is

[09:20] Enough to talk about in the pinball world on a weekly basis that keeps it interesting

[09:27] Now I will also say this

[09:29] The last few weeks

[09:31] The last few weeks I feel have been a somewhat

[09:35] Demoralizing moment in pinball

[09:39] And here's what I mean by that

[09:40] I mean it's really hard for people to keep their excitement levels

[09:45] High in this hobby

[09:47] If you spend too much time nitpicking every single thing going on in the hobby

[09:53] I think it's a combination of the stranger things launch

[09:58] I think was a little underwhelming for people

[10:00] I think the Rick and Morty launch was launched perfectly

[10:05] But now I think there's a complete drought

[10:08] In the Rick and Morty sort of enthusiasm

[10:11] And people need something more to go on

[10:13] Right? We're a real ravenous bunch

[10:16] Of enthusiasts

[10:18] We constantly need something like each week

[10:22] To propel us into the next week

[10:24] To stay relevant and to stay talking about the pinball hobby

[10:28] I mean go into the Rick and Morty thread right now

[10:31] It's starting to like unravel a little bit

[10:34] And just become this random thread of garbage again

[10:37] It's like we have no patience

[10:40] We constantly need something new

[10:43] To discuss and pull apart and nitpick

[10:47] And again like I think in January

[10:49] I think people just reach a point

[10:52] Where maybe they're just they're tired of it all

[10:55] And they just want to take a break

[10:57] I mean I fully understand why Morty wanted to take a break in January

[11:01] It's like you do an entire year's worth of shows

[11:04] You hardly get any money from it

[11:06] And you're just burnt out

[11:09] And you just want to take a break

[11:10] But then in the very moment in which you want to just relax

[11:14] You've got the twippy voting happens in the very month of January

[11:18] In which you're trying to just like take some time off

[11:21] And it's like it's unavoidable

[11:24] The other part of the discussion of

[11:26] You know does the twippy's create a sense of like winning and losing

[11:31] When it comes to content creation

[11:33] And does that popularity contest

[11:36] Adversely affect people

[11:37] And does it remove their motivation to do it

[11:40] If they feel like they're not recognized

[11:43] And I just want to say this

[11:44] Because when I was reading the Pimbal Supernova

[11:47] Lee over there his explanation

[11:49] As to why he's getting out of the hobby

[11:52] No one else

[11:52] Everyone else

[11:53] If you listen to everyone else saying

[11:55] You know we're going to do our final podcast

[11:57] Everyone else went out with grace

[12:00] Lee decided to go out with some real strident remarks

[12:04] And some real bitterness

[12:06] About why he's leaving Pimbal

[12:08] And look it's his prerogative

[12:10] It's his prerogative

[12:11] And I mean if that's how he feels

[12:14] That Pimbal is being dominated by self-absorbed personalities

[12:19] And you know no one cares about the content that he creates

[12:25] And his clicks and his viewership has gone significantly down

[12:30] And he's feeling underappreciated

[12:32] You know look that's that's that's on Lee

[12:36] Everyone who makes Pimbal content

[12:38] Part of what we do

[12:39] Part of our job as Pimbal content creators

[12:42] Is to create an audience

[12:44] Is to stay relevant

[12:46] Is to keep up with what the needs are

[12:50] Or the wants are of the community that absorbs Pimbal content

[12:54] I mean that's just it's just basic marketing one-on-one

[12:58] I can't help it if Lee feels like he feels underappreciated

[13:03] But then he also goes on to say that he's going to sell his entire collection

[13:06] And he's kind of like done with Pimbal

[13:09] And here's what I always always want to avoid

[13:13] In anything you do in life

[13:14] If you have something you enjoy and it brings you pleasure

[13:18] You have to be careful about not allowing it to take over your life so much

[13:24] So that you reach a burnout point like that

[13:28] Where you don't even want it in your life anymore

[13:31] Where you want to get rid of it

[13:32] Where you want to burn down everything you created

[13:34] And you want to just like abandon the entire hobby

[13:38] And the entire community

[13:39] Because of what other people are doing

[13:42] And what other people are saying

[13:44] And how other people are engaging in the hobby

[13:47] Who cares

[13:49] I mean I look at Lee's response

[13:50] Who cares

[13:52] That there's big personalities doing podcasts

[13:55] Who cares

[13:56] If there's a whole new bunch of new inbox buyers

[13:59] That think Elvira's couch is worth $15,000

[14:03] Who cares if playfields are dimpling

[14:05] And people are still buying

[14:06] I mean if you can't still find a way to enjoy the hobby

[14:12] And you let all the external forces get to you

[14:17] Then you're always going to be unfulfilled

[14:19] And you're endeavors to create Pimbal content for people

[14:23] I do this show

[14:25] I do this show as a creative outlet for me

[14:28] And I do this show for my fans

[14:30] And I don't want to walk away

[14:32] Because I don't want to walk away from the enjoyment I get

[14:36] From what I create

[14:37] And I don't want to walk away for you the listener

[14:39] I mean this becomes part of your weekly routine

[14:42] I know that

[14:43] I know that you guys look forward to new episodes

[14:46] And if I were to announce tomorrow

[14:47] That Canadian Pimbal podcast was going away

[14:51] I know that a lot of you

[14:52] Who enjoy this show on a weekly basis

[14:55] Some of what you enjoy in Pimbal

[14:57] Would be gone

[14:59] And I don't want that to happen

[15:01] It's like when you find out your favorite TV show got cancelled

[15:05] There will come a time though

[15:07] I'm just prepping all of you

[15:09] There will come a time when this show will come to an end

[15:13] It's not today

[15:14] It's not before I see what Deeproot does

[15:17] It's not before Guns and Roses and Toy Story

[15:19] I mean I'm looking forward to sharing my points of view

[15:23] On 2020 in Pimbal

[15:24] I mean it looks like it's going to be a very exciting year in Pimbal in 2020

[15:29] And I don't want to like jump ship now

[15:33] Now and again

[15:34] I don't think these guys are jumping ship

[15:36] I think they're just moving into

[15:39] Another way to share content with you

[15:42] Look it could be a new show

[15:43] It could be a new show

[15:45] It could be a new stream

[15:47] It's they're still going to be a part of this hobby

[15:50] So if you love those gentlemen

[15:52] And you love the content they create

[15:54] I really think you're not going to be disappointed for very long

[15:57] I think you're going to still have them be a part of the community

[16:01] Now Lee over at Supernova going Supernova

[16:03] I don't know I don't know it sounds like he's just done

[16:06] He's just fed up that all of this just got to him

[16:09] You know maybe it's because he didn't get enough twippy votes

[16:12] But it's don't ever do it for that stuff

[16:15] If you do your Pimbal content

[16:17] Expecting money

[16:18] Expecting an audience

[16:20] Expecting recognition

[16:22] Expecting pets on the back

[16:24] Expecting praise

[16:26] Then you're doing it for the wrong reasons

[16:28] And I don't think he was doing it for those reasons

[16:30] I really don't I think he just loved Pimbal

[16:32] And I think part of him probably just hates seeing

[16:35] Where some of the Pimbal content has evolved to

[16:38] And look I'm just going to be completely blunt

[16:41] He probably hates someone like me

[16:43] And he sees Canada as being some of what's wrong

[16:46] In the Pimbal hobby these days

[16:48] And you know who you are

[16:50] I hear people calling me a D-bag

[16:52] And saying all these nasty things about me

[16:54] My favorite insult about Canada is I'm a womanizer

[16:57] I'm a womanizer

[16:59] I'm happily married to Brenda

[17:01] What does that mean? I'm a womanizer

[17:02] Like I go around like insulting women

[17:04] I work with women all day long

[17:07] For you can go up to any woman I work with at my company

[17:10] And nobody would say that I'm a womanizer

[17:13] Wow

[17:14] I've also got an appolian complex apparently

[17:17] I'm not that short

[17:18] Come on guys

[17:20] I was born with a silver spoon

[17:22] Wasn't I?

[17:23] Really?

[17:24] When I was growing up my parents

[17:26] They didn't have money for most of my you know

[17:28] For half of my childhood

[17:30] My dad got somewhat successful

[17:32] Everything that I've got here going right now

[17:36] I'm earning it

[17:38] I don't begrudge anybody whose parents were successful

[17:41] I hate that mentality in this country

[17:44] When you insult people like that just because

[17:46] Don't you don't you want your kids to look at you

[17:49] And say hey like my parents were successful

[17:51] Do you want your kids to be insulted

[17:53] Because maybe you gave them more than

[17:55] Then you grew up with

[17:57] Isn't that part of the American dream?

[17:59] People get salty when they're driving

[18:00] Super result day long

[18:02] Anyway

[18:02] But look

[18:03] This is an unfortunate

[18:06] Ocarans

[18:07] In the pinball podcasting world

[18:09] I'm not happy that these guys are going away

[18:12] I mean you know on some level I love having more competition

[18:15] And when I say competition

[18:17] I don't mean like we're competing for anything

[18:20] I just mean like what we're competing for

[18:23] Is to become the most entertaining pinball podcast

[18:25] That's the that's the real competition for me

[18:27] It's not a trippy

[18:28] It's can I make the most entertaining pinball podcast

[18:32] And the only measurement of that

[18:34] The truest measurement of that

[18:36] Are how many people will listen

[18:38] If this show sucked

[18:40] If I was this terrible debag

[18:43] Who did not care about pinball

[18:45] Who is all those nasty things that

[18:48] People say about me

[18:50] Why would anyone listen to this show?

[18:53] I think you know the answer is

[18:55] I'm not that criminal to the hobby

[18:57] That some people want you to think I am

[19:00] And then I also have proven

[19:02] That you don't need to own a pinball machine

[19:05] In your home

[19:07] To give an opinion about pinball

[19:09] That elitist attitude is really

[19:12] What rubs people the wrong way

[19:14] I don't know a ton about pinball history

[19:18] But I'll tell you this

[19:20] I know 99% more than most people do

[19:25] In the world about pinball

[19:26] It's because I've been studying

[19:29] The modern pinball world

[19:31] Okay

[19:32] Now yes, I don't know every game from the past

[19:35] And who designed everything

[19:36] And all the rules sets

[19:38] And all the different things that went on

[19:39] And pinball

[19:40] You know decades ago

[19:42] But when it comes to modern pinball

[19:45] And giving an analysis of the modern pinball hobby

[19:48] This is what we do

[19:50] This show is not talking about

[19:52] Valley Williams games from the past

[19:53] We're not going over like how to score high

[19:55] And how to achieve great things

[19:57] And tournaments

[19:58] I'm talking to you

[20:00] About the moves

[20:02] That pinball companies are doing

[20:04] In real time

[20:05] In the present day

[20:07] And that's the focus of this show

[20:09] We're not here to shield a company

[20:11] We're not here to like give these in-depth review

[20:14] Of games even though we do that every once in a while

[20:16] We'll interview people when it makes sense on this show

[20:20] And that's what I enjoy doing

[20:22] Now I've always said too

[20:24] I think another reason people burn out

[20:26] Is there on a schedule

[20:28] Once you put a schedule

[20:30] Attached to your content

[20:33] You basically

[20:35] Become somewhat tied to that

[20:37] I bet Mr. Franchi

[20:39] Christopher Franchi

[20:41] Is kicking himself a little bit

[20:43] When he said that they're going to have a new episode up every two weeks

[20:48] Because if you listen to their show

[20:50] It's high production

[20:52] A lot of editing

[20:53] A lot of work is going into that

[20:55] And now you have to do it every two weeks

[20:58] But what if you don't feel like doing it every two weeks

[21:01] What if like there's not a lot of new stuff going on

[21:04] What if there's conflicts in your your co-host schedules

[21:08] It becomes work

[21:10] And it never should be work

[21:12] This is not work

[21:13] This is play

[21:14] When I pick up a microphone

[21:16] And I talk to you about pinball

[21:17] This is as playful

[21:19] As a getch for me

[21:21] When it comes to creating content

[21:24] When I'm at work

[21:25] And I'm coming up with ideas

[21:26] And I'm creating content at my job

[21:29] It's different

[21:30] I can't just say what I want

[21:33] I can't just speak my mind

[21:35] I can't just show up when I want to show up

[21:37] I can't just bring ideas when I want to bring ideas

[21:40] I'm on deadlines

[21:42] I have clients to consider

[21:44] You know, I'm being paid by a boss and an employer

[21:47] If I don't show up

[21:49] Let's say if I say I'm going to have ideas by Friday

[21:52] For a new business pitch

[21:53] And I don't show up with ideas

[21:55] I'm in trouble

[21:56] But if if I say I'm going to do a pinball podcast

[21:59] When I feel like it

[22:00] And I don't do one for a week

[22:02] I'm not in trouble

[22:04] It's just how I feel

[22:06] I didn't get one up yesterday

[22:08] Everyone just expects

[22:08] Canate it to have a show on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday

[22:11] Or just three times a week

[22:13] And for the most part

[22:14] I've obliged you

[22:15] With that kind of cadence

[22:17] But I would never

[22:19] Schedule this show

[22:21] And also the other thing

[22:22] I would never

[22:23] And this is what I don't do

[22:25] I never create

[22:27] Seignants of this show

[22:28] Because when you do segments

[22:30] Again, it's like I've always said

[22:31] You've got to work

[22:32] To fill those segments

[22:34] And I love listening

[22:36] To stuff like market trends

[22:38] Just like you do

[22:39] And I don't want to do a ton

[22:42] Of extra work

[22:44] To create pinball content

[22:47] On a weekly basis

[22:48] I don't

[22:49] Because I just

[22:50] It's too much time and effort

[22:52] To get to something that might not

[22:54] Ultimately be worth it

[22:55] Or I just might not enjoy it

[22:58] Like I am here

[22:59] To capture

[23:01] I think what's going on

[23:03] On on on pinside

[23:04] And what's going on

[23:04] At the companies

[23:05] And what are the rumors and speculation

[23:07] Okay

[23:08] And it works for me

[23:09] And I think these amazing gentlemen

[23:12] Have decided that they're ready to do something else

[23:16] And I'm sad to see them go

[23:18] I really am

[23:19] I'm sad to see them go

[23:21] And I really wish the best for all of them

[23:25] I sent a really nice note to Martin

[23:27] And I meant it

[23:29] Martin and Ryan

[23:30] Those guys man

[23:31] Those guys were always the ones that I

[23:34] Looked at

[23:35] And I felt like

[23:36] You know they were just crushing it

[23:39] With some of the best interviews ever in pinball

[23:41] They were

[23:42] They got everybody

[23:44] That you could ever want to interview about pinball

[23:47] And hats off to them

[23:49] For doing all of those amazing shows

[23:51] For all of us to enjoy

[23:53] Okay

[23:54] Now it's hard in pinball too

[23:55] Because this is a

[23:57] I'm just going to be honest

[23:58] It's a very transient

[24:00] And a very temporary

[24:02] Value that we add

[24:04] When you interview someone

[24:05] You're capturing a moment

[24:07] In pinball

[24:08] That's relevant in that moment

[24:11] A year later

[24:13] Not so relevant anymore

[24:14] Right

[24:15] And all my interviews like

[24:17] It captures a moment

[24:19] Are people going to go back

[24:20] And relisten to that stuff

[24:21] Who knows

[24:22] I don't think so

[24:23] I think what we're doing

[24:24] Is content for today

[24:26] It has its moment

[24:28] And that moment passes

[24:30] Sometimes I'm like man like one day

[24:32] If I have a kid

[24:33] Is he going to like wake up 20 years from now

[24:35] And start at Kinatus pinball podcast number one

[24:38] And listen through all like four or five hundred episodes

[24:42] I mean if you started from the very beginning

[24:44] You could follow the narrative

[24:46] You would learn about these companies

[24:47] But it's weird

[24:49] I don't think people do that with pinball podcasts

[24:52] It's not like true crime podcasts

[24:54] Where you can go back like years earlier

[24:56] And just listen to them talking about

[24:58] Like a crime that was committed

[25:00] Because that's a story in itself

[25:02] But I don't think anyone cares

[25:04] I think this show only works

[25:06] Because we try to be as timely

[25:08] And as relevant as we possibly can

[25:11] And head to head

[25:12] Without a doubt

[25:14] Without a doubt

[25:14] This show that gave the pinball

[25:16] Podcasting world the best interviews

[25:18] You know special when lit

[25:20] Ken and Bill

[25:22] I mean they've infused a level of positivity

[25:25] And a level of enthusiasm

[25:28] And they're just like

[25:29] Magnetic people

[25:31] That bring people together in a very positive way

[25:34] And we need more of that spirit in this hobby

[25:37] There's too much like attacking

[25:39] There's too much negativity at times

[25:42] And too much tearing down of people

[25:45] And Ken and Bill bring people together

[25:48] They bring enthusiasm

[25:49] And they bring the right kind of vibe

[25:51] That I think pinball needs going into 2020

[25:54] And I know they're going to keep doing it

[25:56] So I'm excited

[25:57] I love going onto their stream

[26:00] On Monday nights and hanging out with them

[26:02] I love it

[26:03] And I know you would too

[26:04] And maybe you should explore that

[26:06] Like turn off pin side and go

[26:08] Actually hang out with people in real time

[26:11] Much more enjoyable, right

[26:13] And Zach forget it

[26:15] I mean to say Zach many is going anywhere

[26:19] To say Zach many

[26:21] Is going to disappear for very long on the airwaves

[26:24] Is ridiculous

[26:26] Zach is planning something

[26:28] Zach is always experimenting with new types of pinball content

[26:32] Right?

[26:33] Remember the crib show where that go?

[26:34] Gone? Didn't really work?

[26:36] Probably too much effort for what it was worth

[26:38] Okay, he shelved it

[26:40] And he's going to do something else

[26:42] And he's behind this pinball network

[26:43] I can't wait to see what it is

[26:45] And it's going to be Mr. Manny

[26:48] Doing what he does best

[26:49] Some of you are going to like it

[26:51] Some of you are not

[26:52] I think if there's anyone that I relate to in the sense of like

[26:55] We got a lot of arrows in our back

[26:57] It's Mr. Manny too

[26:59] People want to just call Zach a shill

[27:01] And look

[27:02] Yes, we all can get a little bit annoyed at the amount of flipping out advertisements

[27:07] That have to sit in the front of podcasts

[27:09] And have to be always present on the streams

[27:11] I get it but it's his company

[27:14] He's trying to drive sales for his company

[27:18] And if he wants to give pinball reviews and sell you games

[27:23] You just know where it's coming from

[27:27] Do I think it's a conflict of interest a little bit

[27:29] But also when I listen to Zach's reviews

[27:32] I don't think he burries areas of games that can use improvement

[27:38] I don't, I mean to be fair

[27:41] He'll call stuff out that he doesn't like in a game

[27:45] And that's got to be hard

[27:47] If you're trying to be someone who's just only trying to sell

[27:51] That you're going to tell people that it's not the best art package

[27:54] Or the, you know, this could use more work

[27:56] Or the projector could use more code

[27:59] Right? You know, is he going to come out and say like

[28:01] This game's a piece of crap like canada wood?

[28:03] Probably not

[28:05] But it's understandable why he doesn't do that

[28:08] But he's working hard on getting people a lot of content

[28:10] Mr. Jack Danger out there

[28:12] Incredible, incredible, incredible stream

[28:16] So much fun going on to Dead Flip

[28:18] There are some incredible personalities

[28:21] That are working hard every week, every day

[28:25] Multiple hours a week, countless hours a year

[28:29] To give you guys the content you want

[28:31] And Robin and Pinside and all the moderators there

[28:34] I mean it's like this

[28:35] There's a little microcosm world

[28:38] Of people that just haven't interested in making pinball content

[28:42] And here's what else will happen

[28:43] Here's what else will happen

[28:45] More pinball podcasts shows will

[28:48] Will come out

[28:49] Brand new shows will develop in 2020

[28:54] Shows will rise from the ashes of the shows that go away

[28:58] People will be inspired to pick up the mic

[29:02] Just as I did

[29:04] Just as Marty did

[29:06] Just as Ryan did

[29:08] Just as Ken and Bill did

[29:10] Just as Zach did

[29:11] They will be inspired by those shows

[29:14] To give it a go themselves

[29:17] And that is awesome

[29:19] And I encourage you

[29:20] If you feel the inkling

[29:23] To make pinball podcasting

[29:25] A creative outlet for your love of pinball

[29:28] That I think you should do it

[29:30] You know who I would love

[29:32] I would just love for him to do a podcast

[29:33] Because he is very knowledgeable

[29:36] He's very outspoken

[29:38] And he's got the exact kind of personality

[29:41] That I think works well for a podcast

[29:44] Is crazy, crazy, levy

[29:46] Is it levy or levy, right?

[29:48] But he's always talking about pinball

[29:51] I think he'd be better off

[29:52] Instead of typing

[29:54] All those comments

[29:56] Is just do a podcast

[29:58] Maybe once a week

[29:59] Incapsulating everything going on on the hobby

[30:01] But even he said it

[30:02] Like it doesn't take that much work

[30:04] To go into pinside

[30:06] And troll the hell out of the site

[30:07] For like a few hours

[30:09] And then you're done

[30:10] When you do a podcast

[30:11] It's just more work required

[30:13] And so I think we're going to see more pinball podcasts

[30:16] Pop out

[30:18] And become

[30:18] You know someone

[30:20] Some new show will come

[30:22] That will have a breakout new approach

[30:25] And I've heard people say

[30:26] The reason why these shows end is

[30:28] They're all saying the same thing

[30:30] They're all covering the same topic

[30:33] And there's some truth to that

[30:36] There is a fatigue that sets in

[30:38] As like what else can I add

[30:41] Like what else can I say

[30:43] That's not going to be redundant

[30:45] And I'll tell you the thing that never gets redundant

[30:48] The thing that doesn't get covered by everybody else

[30:52] Is you

[30:53] I mean the host

[30:55] It's the personality of all these people

[30:58] They're all different

[31:00] Poor man's podcast

[31:01] Loser kid podcast

[31:03] Albert

[31:04] Pimball nerd's podcast

[31:06] Everyone's got a different personality

[31:08] Everyone has a different approach and a style

[31:10] If you enjoy it

[31:11] Just do it who cares

[31:13] And look if you want to do a show

[31:15] And you get 200 people who listen to everyone

[31:17] And you're cool with that

[31:19] Then what's the big deal

[31:20] You'll have 200 people that love listening to you

[31:24] Right now we're

[31:25] And I've looked at our listener base

[31:27] We've climbed even higher than last year

[31:30] And which is great

[31:32] It just shows that we're getting more and more people into

[31:35] Enjoying pinball podcasts

[31:37] And I think some people are stuck in the past

[31:40] I think some people still want to hate me

[31:42] For their own reasons

[31:44] And I think they still want to crucify canada

[31:47] And to those people

[31:49] I say that you're missing out

[31:50] I think you're missing out on one of the most entertaining pinball podcasts

[31:54] I hope we win a third twippy

[31:56] And prove you haters wrong

[31:58] I do

[31:59] Because I'm working hard

[32:01] Getting all these shows up

[32:03] You know you don't win a twippy

[32:05] Because you mailed it in

[32:06] You don't win a twippy

[32:07] Because you're not working hard

[32:09] We're where we're at

[32:11] For fans of the show

[32:12] I just want to be completely blunt

[32:13] We are where we're at

[32:15] Number one pinball podcast

[32:17] We get two to three thousand people listen to every episode

[32:20] Without co-hosts

[32:21] Without interviews

[32:23] And I think it's great

[32:23] It's because all of you tune in

[32:26] And we won two years in a row

[32:28] Not because the show sucks

[32:30] It's because I put in a lot of hard work

[32:32] At making this show

[32:34] As entertaining as possible

[32:35] And I sacrifice a lot of my time

[32:37] To give you this show

[32:39] And I give you some rumors

[32:40] And I give you some speculations

[32:41] And sometimes we're right

[32:42] Sometimes we're wrong

[32:43] But I hope by now

[32:45] I hope by now

[32:46] You understand

[32:48] That I do love this hobby

[32:49] And I think I do a lot of great for this hobby

[32:52] And keeping people motivated

[32:54] And excited to stick with it

[32:55] And enjoy pinball

[32:57] And I love doing it

[32:58] And I think we're going to take it again

[33:00] And I hope

[33:02] That that also inspires other people

[33:04] To pick up the mic and do a show

[33:06] And try to make it even more entertaining

[33:08] And put it in their voice

[33:10] And give us their opinions

[33:12] But do it their way

[33:14] And that's the greatest thing about

[33:17] This country and freedom of speech

[33:19] And the ability to just do this

[33:21] Just

[33:22] This is not cost prohibitive

[33:24] A $200 microphone

[33:27] A $200 microphone

[33:29] Some free audacity software

[33:32] Free website

[33:33] That I can access from anywhere

[33:36] And Facebook

[33:37] Communicating with all you guys

[33:38] On a daily basis

[33:40] On my

[33:41] Canada pinball podcast

[33:42] Facebook page

[33:43] It's all you need

[33:45] It's all you need

[33:46] No, you don't need to go buy

[33:48] $6-$15,000 machines

[33:51] You don't

[33:52] You don't need to do any of that

[33:53] To have an opinion

[33:55] About these games

[33:56] You really don't

[33:58] And yes

[34:00] If you're going to review a game

[34:01] You've got to play it

[34:02] That's just

[34:03] That's just the one thing you can't do

[34:06] You can't review a game

[34:08] Without having flipped it

[34:09] You can give your opinions about

[34:11] Aspects of the game

[34:13] But if you're going to review a game

[34:14] Yes, you do need to physically stand

[34:16] In front of Pym Hall machines

[34:18] And play the damn thing

[34:19] If you want to do that

[34:21] All right

[34:22] Look everybody

[34:23] I know that a lot of you

[34:25] Are bummed out

[34:26] I'm bummed out

[34:28] Some of my friends

[34:29] Shows are going away

[34:31] And I hope that

[34:33] New shows come up that you enjoy

[34:35] And if you're feeling a little bit of a void

[34:38] Just know that

[34:39] I'm going to be around

[34:40] To give you guys content

[34:42] And I look forward to seeing what

[34:44] Zack and Company

[34:45] All these guys have planned for the future

[34:48] And I would just ask all of us

[34:50] There's no one to blame

[34:52] Hey Lee

[34:53] There's no one to blame

[34:54] If you have lost your love of Pym Hall

[34:58] It's nobody's fault

[35:00] But your own

[35:02] It's just the way it is in life

[35:04] You let yourself get too close to the fire

[35:07] You might have expected too much

[35:10] And and Lee

[35:11] I think you're going to regret it

[35:13] I really do

[35:14] I think if you sell your collection

[35:17] And go out in this blaze of glory

[35:19] Because of Jackass is like me

[35:21] You're going to regret it

[35:23] I would take a break

[35:24] Take a pause

[35:26] And find a new way to enjoy this hobby

[35:29] That I know you love

[35:30] And you've created so much great content

[35:33] It would be a shame

[35:35] To let that person

[35:37] Or that person

[35:38] Run it for you

[35:40] And just some words of advice

[35:42] Everybody

[35:43] Have a great night

[35:45] This is this

[35:46] I hopefully don't

[35:47] I don't have to address any more podcast leaving

[35:50] This week

[35:51] We'll be back with more episodes

[35:53] I think the one thing

[35:54] You know again

[35:55] I think Rick and Morty man

[35:56] I just want to see some of this game by now

[35:59] It's

[36:00] You know people are

[36:02] They're just dying

[36:04] To have something on this title now

[36:07] I do I think Stranger Things has left everyone being like

[36:10] Eh

[36:11] It is what it is

[36:12] I do I think Stranger Things is going to go down

[36:14] And it's like

[36:15] A bit of a mediocre game

[36:18] I'm not even going to talk about Greg

[36:20] Boom

[36:20] Poor Greg Bones is trying to sell this game

[36:22] I know he hyped it and now he's selling it

[36:25] But that's what Greg always does

[36:26] I'm just shocked that people are like

[36:28] Well you can't do that Mr.

[36:30] But it's what Greg always does

[36:32] He plays a game he enjoys it and he moves on

[36:35] Whether he enjoys it or not

[36:36] He still moves on from the game

[36:38] So before people start attacking the dude

[36:41] Maybe research his normal behavior

[36:45] Because that is what he is showcasing right now

[36:48] But I think Stranger Things is bum people out

[36:50] I think people are wanting to see Rick and Morty

[36:52] To see if it actually like shoots and lives up to the hype

[36:56] And then I think it's like this waiting period

[36:58] To Texas Pimball Festival and Deep Root

[37:00] And Ninja Turtles and all that stuff

[37:02] And it's during these periods

[37:04] In which I know I think people start to lose patience

[37:07] And I'm just saying everyone

[37:09] Be patient

[37:10] A lot of good stuff is coming in Pimball

[37:12] A lot of good Pimball podcasts are coming

[37:14] From yours truly and others out there

[37:17] And let's all try to just like

[37:19] Do me one favor this year

[37:20] I keep saying it

[37:21] January

[37:22] Go to the gym

[37:24] Work out

[37:26] Eat healthy

[37:27] Take care of yourself

[37:29] I spent more time

[37:31] Exercising than playing Pimball

[37:33] And I'd rather my life be that way

[37:37] Okay

[37:38] You should too

[37:40] I'm serious

[37:41] You never gonna read a story where someone's like

[37:43] Man I wish I'd played more Pimball when I was younger

[37:46] No, it's I wish I'd took care of myself

[37:48] So do me a favor

[37:49] Go look at Jared

[37:50] The guys lost like a hundred pounds

[37:52] But nominal transformation

[37:54] He didn't get that way playing Pimball

[37:56] Anyway, you can do both

[37:58] You can love Pimball

[38:00] And take care of yourself

[38:02] Wow

[38:02] And then and then everything is more enjoyable

[38:05] I read everyone

[38:05] Have a great day

[38:06] We'll talk to you soon

[38:07] They were singing

[38:09] My, my misamerican pie

[38:14] Go to my Chevy to the levy

[38:16] But the levy was dry

[38:19] Remember all boys with brick and whiskey and rye

[38:23] Singing this will be the day that I die
