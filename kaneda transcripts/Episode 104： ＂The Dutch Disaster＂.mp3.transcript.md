[00:00] Ah!

[00:07] Where's the money, Lebowski?

[00:09] Boni says you're good for it.

[00:12] Where's the money, Lebowski?

[00:14] Where's the fucking money, shithead!

[00:23] Where is the money, Lebowski?

[00:26] This has become the question that is on everybody's mind.

[00:30] And unfortunately, it seems to be the major news story coming out of T-P-F.

[00:35] Is what is the future of Dutch Pimbal and will people who bought early-achiever additions of the Big Lebowski ever get their Pimbal machines?

[00:48] That is what we're going to discuss on this episode of Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[00:52] And after we discuss Dutch Pimbal, I'm going to go over my overall final thoughts on Texas Pimbal Festival.

[01:01] Pick my favorite game of the show and just give you my final observations.

[01:05] I've had a day to sort of think about it all.

[01:07] I actually got to play a lot more games Saturday night after I recorded my podcast.

[01:13] So I want to give you a little bit of what I felt when I finally got the hop on stuff in the lines were shorter.

[01:19] But let's talk about Dutch Pimbal.

[01:23] Let's talk about what I'm calling the Dutch disaster.

[01:27] This whole train has gone off the tracks.

[01:31] It's fallen off the tracks.

[01:33] It's gone over a cliff. It's ended up in the ocean.

[01:36] It's exploded and everyone is getting eaten by great white sharks.

[01:40] It could not be worse for people who are in on the Big Lebowski.

[01:46] And it's kind of sad and it's kind of tragic before we jump into what we heard at TPS and what the mood is on Pinside and what owners are saying.

[01:56] Because I want to talk about that.

[01:58] I want to read some of the suggestions that people are making.

[02:02] I think it's getting to the point where people are coming up with some of the most ludicrous suggestions on how to fix this problem.

[02:10] But I want to start off by saying one thing.

[02:13] This story feels very similar to many other stories we've encountered in the world of Pimbal.

[02:20] And there's one common denominator that leads people to end up in moments like this.

[02:28] That leads people to end up frustrated, anxious, pissed off, wanting to call lawyers.

[02:36] Every bad feeling you can associate with getting a toy for your home.

[02:41] Usually comes from one simple move.

[02:45] And that move is giving someone your money who's never built a Pimbal machine before.

[02:53] That simple action of handing your money in because you took someone at their word that they could deliver you a Pimbal machine has more times than none.

[03:04] Lead people, a stray, has screwed people over, has ended up in total disaster.

[03:12] And here we are all over again.

[03:15] Another company, another disaster, another arduous journey that the outcome is completely unclear.

[03:25] And all of it happened because two things happened at the same time.

[03:31] A company hoodwinked you with a Pimbal machine and consumers foolishly handed them money without any proof that they could get production going and that they could deliver what they promised.

[03:45] So there's a little bit of blame to be put on both sides.

[03:50] I'm not victim blaming, but this is the end.

[03:54] This has to be the end of consumers going in early and giving companies money, pre-ordering games, years in advance.

[04:04] Because it's a theme I love.

[04:06] Honey, I love La Bousque. I have to have this machine.

[04:09] And look, they brought a machine to Expo.

[04:11] It has to be real. Take my money.

[04:14] Look, Kevin brought a machine to different shows. It has to be real. Take my money.

[04:18] Look, John, no, there's nothing to look at. John didn't even show anything and people gave him money.

[04:25] So let's talk about where do we go now.

[04:29] Let's talk a little about what we know with this situation. Just to recap quickly, they came up to T-P-F and they didn't have a solution with ARA.

[04:38] ARA is manufacturing the games and they did not have a solution.

[04:43] What Yopp said was basically, we're pissed at them. They're pissed at us.

[04:48] It's an emotional thing right now. We don't see eye to eye with the executives of ARA.

[04:53] And our lawyer is telling us not to sue, to wait it out and maybe cooler heads will prevail.

[05:00] So to wait it out.

[05:02] Now, as an early achiever buyer, if you're in on Big Lebowski number 147, how long are you willing to wait it out?

[05:11] You've already waited two years and now your game, that guy's game's not even built.

[05:18] I'm not even talking about the 40 guys who have machines that they know one of those games as theirs.

[05:23] I'm talking about guys who paid in full whose game is not even made and now they're also on the sidelines waiting it out for these two Dutch parties to resolve their emotional issues with each other.

[05:39] So I would feel like shit.

[05:43] If I had money on Big Lebowski and I'm being told, you know what, just wait it out.

[05:47] What's $8,500 bucks? Just wait it out. That would not make me feel good. I don't think it makes any of you guys feel good.

[05:54] So there's that. Then we hear after that part of the story that they lie to consumers about the board issue.

[06:01] I'm not going to go into that again. But once you lie, getting credibility back with your consumers, extremely difficult.

[06:08] I don't think people will give them any credibility back. So there's that part of it.

[06:13] Okay. So after the lie is admitted, you're then asked to believe a few things about what they're trying to do, which is resolve the issue with ARA, let cooler heads prevail.

[06:25] But then if that shit sandwich isn't enough for you to digest, they ask you to eat another shit sandwich and announce a new game.

[06:35] I think we all agree that announcing a new game when game one is not shipping is a terrible idea.

[06:42] So they did a terrible thing and announced game two.

[06:45] So at that point, you really have to question the logic of the individuals involved.

[06:52] When I talk to Nate Chivers on a previous podcast, he says, you know, Yap and Barry, there's a lot of smart guys over at Dutch.

[06:59] I'm not seeing a lot of smart moves here. Are these moves coming from these smart gentlemen?

[07:06] Because these moves seem pretty idiotic to me. And I know they seem pretty idiotic to you.

[07:12] So I think the move to announce this Bob Anniversary edition for $12,500 in the same speech, the same seminar,

[07:24] as admitting that Europe shits Creek with Lebowski production and Lebowski owners have no timeline available to them about when they're going to get their games.

[07:35] It is a gross misuse of communication. It is a huge misstep that I think has backfired.

[07:46] And now we come to today. We come to the point where owners are now waking up to a realization that they weren't going to get a solution from Yap.

[07:57] That Dutch pinball has no clue about a way forward. And they simply are asking everybody to be patient.

[08:05] And patience is the last thing people are willing to give them after waiting two years and after being lied to.

[08:14] When you lie to someone and you make people wait and then you're asking to get them back on board, people need to see immediate change.

[08:25] Imagine in life you lie to your girlfriend, you lie to your spouse, you get caught, red handed, doing something you should enough, and you tell them I'm going to change.

[08:35] I'm going to change my behavior and I'm going to fix it. That fix needs to be immediate and it needs to be clear and present.

[08:41] And right now these guys have none of that. None of that in play. And the worst part is they want you to think about Bob 2.0 anniversary edition.

[08:52] That's like lying to your wife or your spouse or your mate and then all of a sudden taking someone else out for a fancy dinner that's not your wife.

[09:00] You want the money to go elsewhere and I can't believe they're doing that. I really can't.

[09:06] And I've been telling La Bousske owners over the last few days after that the sort of sour taste that put in my mouth and in your mouth, I think it's time to get out.

[09:18] But the problem is if you didn't buy from coin taker, you can't get out. You're stuck. And the lesson learned is clear, right?

[09:27] Always, always buy from a distributor, never buy directly from a manufacturer. The distributor will hold on to your money and protect your capital until it's time for your game to be made or until your game ships.

[09:41] The distributor will not pay the manufacturer. The same thing is going to happen if anything goes wrong with alien pinball.

[09:48] People who bought alien through coin taker, coin taker has their money. Andrew highway doesn't have the money. So if Andrew highway goes under, the coin taker buyers will be okay.

[10:00] Everyone else will be screwed. I don't understand why people skip that protective layer of the distributor model when it comes to buying their games.

[10:13] I think a lot of it is people just get anxious. They want to cut the lines. They want to get their games first. And in a perfect world, if nothing goes wrong, then sure, it'll never be an issue.

[10:24] But now we're seeing exactly what happens when it becomes an issue. So what's happening right now? The climate is this. Now the LaBalsky owners are waking up and their worst nightmare is occurring right before their eyes.

[10:39] They've put their faith in Yop and company and they didn't get what they wanted to hear. So now where do we go now? Right, where do we go?

[10:48] So now we're hearing the words that are the worst words we can ever hear in a pinball forum. It's lawsuits. Class action lawsuits. I'm calling my lawyer. I'm going to find out what my legal rights are.

[11:01] And the owners have been going back and forth, back and forth, discussing what their options are. And I want to read for you guys what some of the options people are floating out with big LaBalsky.

[11:14] Now I want to give you my opinions about how viable I think these options are. And then I also want to talk about what I think is actually going on between ARA and Dutch and what they're saying. Right, because I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

[11:28] So here, let's see, this is Pinside user, H.J. Bondar from Emerald Hills, California. He says he sees three options. Number one, that ARA and DP lawyers find the midpoint that is not perfect for either, but respects the investments of its customers.

[11:51] I hate to say this, but having done business in Holland flexibility is not a top three attribute. Option two, as a buyer, we offer to pay the extra $1,000 in an escrow count, payable upon delivery. At this point, I am more than willing to do this rather than lose my entire payment. I think this is the most practical option.

[12:15] Option three, universal is brought into the equation by us making this a PR issue for them in such a way that they are motivated to make help resolve this.

[12:27] I would hope that we have someone with PR and or social networking experience that could help to escalate this. Wait a minute, you need someone with PR skill?

[12:36] Canada just happens to be a senior vice president at one of the top five PR agencies in the world. Let me give you my PR expertise on this. Let me go down to list. Number one, he's like, ARA and Dutch could find a middle ground and he basically says the Dutch are stubborn guys and that's probably not going to happen.

[12:56] Now this next option seems to be one that keeps coming up over and over again and that is can the buyers somehow be allowed to pay whatever is owed and get their games?

[13:08] Now we keep hearing $1,000. I believe it was a thousand euros. So you're looking at more than a thousand US dollars here. Now I want to stop on this one a little bit because this is the part that I don't get either.

[13:21] We keep hearing from Dutch that it's not about the money. How is it not about the money?

[13:30] ARA has stopped working on the games because they said in their own communication to people we're owed money by Dutch pinball. So it is all about the money.

[13:43] Money is everything when it comes to deals when it comes to business. Not your emotions, not the fact that your pinball toy didn't arrive. It's all about the money. Nobody in business really is motivated by anything other than money.

[14:00] Now we're going to talk about the other motivator and we're going to talk about the other motivator is legal action.

[14:07] So do you believe that there's a certain finite amount that if Dutch pays ARA then ARA will start making games again. Do you believe there is an amount?

[14:16] Yes, there has to be a way that money can alleviate the problem. When you listen to Yop talk about it and I listen to other people talk about it with the distributors they keep saying no it's not money is not the issue.

[14:32] Bullshit money is the issue. Now the question then becomes how much money is ARA owed to get Lebowski back on track. How much is it 100,000? Is it 1000 per game?

[14:47] Is it only like 40,000,000? I doubt it's that little. Is it somewhere like in the vicinity of 200,000,000? Is it half a million? I can't guess. I can't guess but I would have to assume that it is a significant amount that Dutch wouldn't just pay it and fall on their sword a little bit and keep their company alive.

[15:12] This company is dying. It is dying on a daily basis and the dream could be over and they could be done. I can't imagine that if they could physically could solve it then they would.

[15:28] But it seems like here is what I think they should do. This is a dicey territory because your lawyer might just tell you you can't do stuff like this. I think Dutch should go to ARA and they probably have. How much do we owe you guys? You are making our game for us. How much do we owe you? Whether it's 10 grand, whether it's 100 grand, 500 grand.

[15:53] If we pay you this, can we get a contract? That's it. We are paying this much per game and for the next 250 games and we are good. What's that amount? Then Dutch needs to look at whatever money they have. They need to look at whatever money they collect it. They need to look at how many pre-orders are in for the Lebowski and they need to go to their customer base and say, look, this is the reality.

[16:18] If you want a big Lebowski machine and you don't want to wait for us to emotionally hold hands with ARA and sink in by 10 years from now because our emotions finally subsided, it's going to cost us much money. That means to each of you that's an additional X. Whatever it is, X amount of dollars, whether it's 1 grand, 2 grand, 3 grand, whatever it is. We apologize but this is the only way that we can get things moving quickly and do that.

[16:47] At least give your buyers a chance to cut you a check for a certain amount to get the line moving again. ARA, you can't tell me ARA is not going to accept the money that they feel they are owed to get going again with the games.

[17:01] Now I know some people are like, well, the other issue, if it's not money, could be the potential expiration of the license that this is it that Dutch needed these games to be built by a certain date. It took longer than expected and the license will run out.

[17:16] I'm calling bullshit, I'll tell you why. Because you can extend any license. Why would universal, is it Warner Brothers? Why would they not extend the license? It's universal.

[17:31] The look's done the license. You know what gets you an extension on a license? Money. Once again, money would solve all of these issues. And look, extending a license on a pinball machine, that's fine. You know, you got to do it sometimes. Again, tell your owners, tell your buyers, we ran into some delays and it's going to cost this much more. Let people either stay in or refund their money and sell their spots to new people.

[17:56] As long as games are coming off the line, you'll find buyers easily. This game is not for, there's no shortage of demand for people that want one. And people would happily swoop in and pay the extra cost if that meant that you could also get refunds to people who went in initially.

[18:14] So let me go to the last part of this suggestion. The universal is brought into the equation by us making this a PR issue for them in such a way that it motivates them to help the buyers. Can people just for a second realize that universal is a ginormous multi-billion dollar company that is handling some of the biggest movie properties in the world.

[18:36] They don't give two shits about 300 pinball people, 300 pinball people that might not get their toy. Can we stop with this notion that people getting burned by pinball will somehow even make it within a country mile of a rate on the radar of a universal studios.

[18:59] They don't care. They got paid. This isn't like, oh now you're not going to watch the big Lebowski or go see universal properties anymore because Dutch pinball fucked you over. It's not on them. There's nothing that they should have to do to help you out.

[19:19] They sold the license to Dutch pinball Roger Sharp ink the deal. If you know Roger Sharp is great at getting licenses for companies. Why should universal lift a finger or spend a dime to help you guys out. I hate saying stuff like that. And again, because this is my territory. You want to make it a PR disaster for universal what you want to like slander them.

[19:43] What kind of threat could you possibly make that would make me if I'm over at universal be like wait a minute guys let's not focus on these hundred million dollar movies were about to release. There's 300 1% buyers out there. The 1% problem that are not going to get their pinball machine guys let's we got to stop everything.

[20:07] We you know we have movies that that millions of people go go and watch every week but let's not focus on that guys there's 300 pinball babies out there that might not get their game and they're screaming on on a pinball form that nobody really reads. We have to we have to stop and help these guys at all costs. Yeah see see how stupid that sounds. That's how stupid an idea like that is so look no media outlet again no media outlets going to give a shit that you didn't get your big Lebowski.

[20:37] It's not a story it's not a story the story is this the only the only thing that would happen if that story when public is people would say wait a minute people buy pinball machines for their home. Wait a minute. I'm supposed to feel bad because these rich dudes didn't get their 9000 dollar toy in a world where most people don't have running water or electricity. You see what I'm saying as much as you guys are victims and it sucks. It sucks. The moment you zoom out and want to take a look at the

[21:07] tell a broader audience that you're in pain because you didn't get your pinball machine. Let me tell you that message comes across as people will be unsympathetic they won't care and they'll think you're just an idiot. I'm being honest I'm being honest whenever I hear from friend whenever I talk to friends and I tell them oh yeah I handed someone 10 thousand dollars for a pinball machine and I don't even know what it looks like people think we're idiots for doing that people think we're idiots for handing them out.

[21:37] I'm not saying money to a guy who is going to build predator in his mom's kitchen people think we're idiots for giving John Papa to a guy when the man didn't have a company behind him.

[21:47] So there's that part of it so I think that's a terrible idea. Let's see so there was a suggestion after I read this one this this comes from pinball in Townsend Maryland he said here is a far out idea.

[22:03] I'm in this mess and with you all but I was tired of being upset my sense is that DP and a Ra are emotionally pissed with with each other. It is personal and a burnt bridge has occurred.

[22:16] We all have heard the details and that path would likely just lead to legal efforts. My suggestion is to pursue a different pathway. We need to win win for all parties.

[22:27] My proposal is that we get a Ra to release the 40 plus games and parts through a joint effort on all three parties. He defines those three parties as a Ra, Dutch pinball and the achievers.

[22:42] I love that the achievers are like a legitimate party right. What if we turn this shit sandwich into something positive by contributing cost differences for the 40 plus machines to a charity.

[22:54] Example Dutch Cancer Society Children's Hospital or choice of the CEO in conflict with Dutch pinball. I would be willing to pay up money. Achievers have to pony up a bit more but get their games.

[23:08] Dutch pinball ponies of a bit more but gets parts for non-ARA manufacturing.

[23:13] ARA gets positive publicity from donation effort and goodwill as a business and tax write off. I don't know you may scoff at this thought but I was tired of being depressed.

[23:24] I want to think of another positive way. Take a conflict redirected and turned into helping the less fortunate.

[23:31] I read this and I was like, are you out of your mind? That is the worst idea ever. That we're going to do something that just makes people's hearts feel good.

[23:46] This is like the most bleeding heart ultra liberal way to handle a business dispute.

[23:52] Pinball. Welcome to the real world. That is the worst idea ever. Are you really saying that ARA should take a bath on money they're owed and redirect that money to charity for goodwill?

[24:09] How do you know they probably do give the charity and let me also tell you something. They don't give a shit. They're a manufacturing company.

[24:16] They'll just manufacture stuff for the next client that actually pays them for the work they're doing. This is not about goodwill. It's about money.

[24:26] It's about money and they don't care about you the early achiever. They care about money and getting the money they're owed.

[24:36] They're paying and suffering for not getting your pinball machine. At the end of the day, if you want to give money to a goodwill and feel good and get good PR and sleep at night knowing that you made the world a better place, then don't buy $10,000 fucking pinball machines. Go give $10,000 to charity.

[24:54] It's absolutely ridiculous trying to spin a pinball disaster and do something that will do good for the world. The moment you're using money, using money to bring in a non-essential toy that doesn't do any good for the world other than provide some probably wealthy guy with a little bit more entertainment in his world because he's bored with the 10 machines he already has.

[25:20] You want to try and spin that kind of scenario into something that could actually do something charitable and good.

[25:27] Dude, it's idiotic. See, this is the problem. This is the problem. This whole debacle is making people act like fools. They're acting like fools.

[25:38] There is. There is. Nothing that will solve this problem other than money. Other than money. Right? And now, right? It doesn't seem like in hindsight. Remember when Philgate blew up and Phil told everybody.

[25:54] They're not to be trusted. They are doing stuff that they shouldn't be doing. They are misleading people. They are lying. They are taking a game. They are taking a game and taking money on a game that they legally didn't have permission to do.

[26:13] You realize when they went out and they showed up at Expo and they brought the Lebowski girls and they spent all that money to get you guys on board and showed you a game that they didn't have legal permission to do that. They lied.

[26:31] This whole thing, we thought we did when universal was suggesting they make a change. They didn't realize that they had to. I don't know. I just think at every step of the way these guys haven't done smart moves.

[26:45] A lot of you guys who bought in, I know it's painful as this, is now you look dumb. People look dumb when they lose money on pimp on investments. All the places you could put your money in this world that would give you a return and you went in on a game that now might lose you $8,500, $10,000. You would have been better off buying WWE or Game of Thrones. At least you would have been playing a game for two years and get something back on your investment.

[27:13] So it sucks. It sucks. Let's see what else. These things keep coming in. You can just keep refreshing this thread. So another suggestion, Mike M. says, just an interpretation of what Yop said, they're going to build a small amount of SLE bot machines with a new contract manufacturer. If that successful larger run with a new manufacturer, if that successful build the Lebowski's with the new manufacturer.

[27:39] So from what I could take from what Yop was saying, and I think ARA has an exclusive deal to manufacture Lebowski's. He can't take Lebowski to somebody new. He's got to make it with ARA. And if that is the case, then yeah, that's the worst business deal you can make.

[27:59] So not only have you exclusively given ARA power over Lebowski as a license, if they hold you hostage or screw you over, you're at the mercy of them on two levels now.

[28:14] And your whole game is not yours anymore. It's theirs. Like like Lebowski is like ARA has more control over Lebowski than Dutch Pimball does. That seems like they signed a terrible deal and they're fucked. They're fucked.

[28:29] So look, I think that this whole thing is really bad. And I don't know if there's going to be an amicable solution to it anytime soon. I want everybody to take away the lesson again.

[28:45] Don't give money to these companies before they prove that they can mass produce games. The people did the same thing with Alien and Highway.

[28:55] Full throttle. Yeah, they made a lot of people. Oh, they made full throttle. So that means they can make what does that mean? So they made around 100 full throttle over a period of years. Does that mean that they can make a couple thousand Alien Pimball machines now? It doesn't.

[29:10] You're still waiting. It's almost April of 2017. Where's your Alien 35th anniversary, Ellie? The 35th anniversary of Alien was what two years ago over a year ago. It's no longer the 35th anniversary.

[29:27] So tell me again, Chris, that I'm wrong, that you're right. That really freezing your money with these guys was a smart move. It was idiotic.

[29:39] And anyone who's looking at the stock market, the stock market of the last two, three years is done great. So you guys have done nothing but put yourself in a compromised position.

[29:48] And you've trusted all the wrong people. And I don't know if it's going to end. I really don't know if it's going to end. Like I think it does end here. I do. I think it ends here. Nobody's going to buy this Bob anniversary edition. There's no demand for it. It didn't look that great.

[30:02] I think only fools will buy it. Only fools will buy it. So that was a half hour of me saying that this Dutch disaster is going to now be this toxic, this toxic story that sits on top of all the other more positive news going on in the hobby.

[30:21] So I wanted to just cover it again. I heard from a lot of you guys at TpF that I love your show, Chris, like you cover the news, you keep it timely. I don't have to go into Pinside.

[30:30] You don't have to go read now, all the different pages on Pinside. That is you caught up fully on where things are with Dutch Pimball. It's a total disaster. I wouldn't believe these guys. And if you have your money with a distributor, you might as well just keep it. You're not going to lose your money with CoinTaker.

[30:45] But if you have your money with Dutch, I'd call your lawyer up. And this is my final piece of advice. There's only one reason why Magic Girl is sitting next to me right now.

[30:55] It's not because John felt bad. It's not because John wanted customers to get their games. It's not because of anything other than one thing, legal pressure.

[31:05] Legal pressure is what had to get the Magic Girls out. That is why it's here. Don't think for a moment that these guys are immune to the law. The law exists to protect you guys.

[31:19] And for those of you saying, let's not sue, let's wait. Bullshit. Get on it. Get on it. Go get your games. If your games are built, sue. sue ARA.

[31:31] sue. Everybody over there. But just get some legal pressure. Start it. What sucks is this. That also cost money.

[31:40] Unless you have deep pockets, you might have to just say, I'd rather lose. Then spend more money and still not know the outcome.

[31:47] But I would get going. I would call a lawyer. And I would get their asses to feel some fire. Because they're not going to do it just because they feel bad.

[31:56] This is the real world big boys. Be big boys. Wake up to the reality. This isn't a charity case. Nobody feels bad that you lost your pinball money. Nobody.

[32:05] Harsh truth. Harsh truth here on Canadian pinball podcast. All right. So let's switch gears and be more positive.

[32:14] Let's just take a moment. Let's take a deep breath. Let's look at Bubba and let's talk a little bit about my sort of conclusion to what I played at T.P.F.

[32:26] And let me tell you my overall feelings of the show. Once again, great show. Best show in America for pinball.

[32:32] It gives you a little bit of everything. You got a tournament. You got all these games on free play. You got great seminars. You got great announcements. You got great reveals.

[32:40] You have a somewhat comfortable floor to stand on for hours. You got beautiful Texas weather. You got everything. You got great restaurant. Perry's stay-couse.

[32:48] Thank you, Robert. I'm going to give a shout out to Robert, my friend who's got a Batman SLE in Southern New Jersey. Robert, thank you for dinner Saturday night.

[32:57] I want to thank you on Canadian pinball podcast. You're the man. I love hanging with you. I'm going to make it over there. I'm going to take the hellcat down when the weather's better.

[33:05] I want to thank all the awesome people I ran into. You know, it's about the people. So the show's great. The show's great. Now let's get to the games because we know pinball people are awesome.

[33:13] You either love pinball or you don't in this world and the people who don't, I don't get. Let's talk about the games. So I got to jump on more stuff after my last podcast.

[33:21] I want to talk about some of the games I jumped on. So I played a lot more Houdini. And I've been reading a lot on pinside about Houdini.

[33:27] You know, you try to figure out a game from YouTube videos or from the forms. It's so silly, but I get it. Most of you guys, you have to go off of that.

[33:36] So my overall feelings, I played more of Houdini Saturday night. I got on it. And like I have to say, I think it's amazing what these guys have brought to market in such a short period of time. It's incredible.

[33:48] The game is more playable than Magic Girl ever was. And they did it in just a few months. So kudos to them. I kind of am like, man, why don't you guys actually make Magic Girl work? But they probably did what everybody did. They probably looked at it and said, why bother?

[34:01] So Houdini works. Houdini, I look, I'm still, I have a few things. I want them to go back and revisit the artwork. I think they have plenty of time to do that. That's some of my feedback I'm going to give to Dovel and Scott is guys.

[34:14] The people really like the theme. They're into the theme. They're happy that the game is working. There's like some really cool toys on it. Like that catapult that shoots the ball 20 inches.

[34:22] Fucking cool, man. That's awesome. The curtain that opens up on the stage and then the ball disappears. That's cool. I've always said, all John needed all you need in any pinball game is the ball to do a few cool things and people will be satisfied.

[34:36] And then you have a good rule set and you're good. It's pinball. We're having fun. I think they need to revisit the art. I think the art looks flat. I think it looks computerized. I think it could be better.

[34:46] I think they should have, they should hand draw it. I don't know. Whatever it is, redo the art. Make it sing a little bit more and touch it up. And I think they have time to do that. So that's one feedback.

[34:57] Second feedback I have is the shots are really, really, really, really tight. Like two tight. And I think they'd be better off maybe thinking about maybe losing one shot and opening up some of the pathway for the ball because when you look at the shots on Houdini, it is super tight. Like you're either brick in or you're you're barely making it in.

[35:20] And when I went back and looked at dialed in next to Houdini, you can see the opening on all the wall or shots much, much wider. I don't think it's fun to have a game that bricks a lot. I really don't. I think Ghostbusters suffer from that problem too.

[35:33] Just one too many shots. One too many shots can make a game frustrating more than fun. So my recommendation is to do that. I like the screen. I like the way they have it there. I think it's really well integrated. I like the low scoring. I think the theme is going to work. I think the theme is going to work.

[35:49] And they have time. This is just this is just like the first showcase of it. I was very impressed that they had two games out there and they were working for for the most part. And there was always a constant line. American pinball to me has put magic on the past.

[36:02] You will never hear about John and Zidware and any of that ever again. It is a little bit. You know, it's quickly right. It's it's it's quickly how I'm sorry it's quickly. It's it's easy to see how quickly they could change the conversation by just moving forward and doing it completely.

[36:18] I think American pinball has started a new chapter and that's exciting as I told Scott, you know, I'm not even sure why you would even have like a Wall Street Journal article that you connect John to American pinball.

[36:31] This company is it to me is a new company with with no remnants of J pop. They owe nothing to J pop customers. And I'm happy to see a team of people who know how to make pinball machines.

[36:42] Make showing a pinball machine that works. So kudos to American pinball. All right, but but I'll say this. Some people are saying this the best game in the show. I know it's early. This wasn't the best game in the show. Not not. I don't think so. It was fun to flip. But they didn't it wasn't like the talk of the show. Like, oh my god, you got to go play Houdini.

[37:00] I think they were like really curious and I think it's there's all positive vibes coming out of it. What else? Let's go down the list. So we've got I got to play batman 66 for the first time ever.

[37:13] And I got to play a bunch on on Brett Mr. Lapnips super Ellie. I got to play a bunch in the Marco section. And I have to say I every time I would jump on it.

[37:26] You know, look, here's the thing before I took giving my overall feeling of batman. At a show. Here's the problem with like reviewing games that shows the shows are freaking loud. You're tired. You can't hear games very well. There's so many games going all over the place. You don't really you really don't get much of like what the game is really going to be.

[37:45] You get a sense of flow. You maybe get a sense of like the sound a little bit. You can't follow though like the codes to call out. You don't get any of that. So you really get more of a visual tour of the game. Like what does it look like? And then how do the shots?

[38:04] You know, how are the shots? Like does it flow? Is it bricky? All that stuff you can you can take away. But everything else you don't get it in a big sort of festival environment. So I'll say this. I am trying to choose my words wisely.

[38:18] I think batman looks really fun. I think it looks really fun. I also think batman looks really barren. I think the play field on batman looks so much more barren than ghost buses. I really do. I just don't see the money there. I just think again like I just always feel like it just feels like a re-skin.

[38:37] And the shots like the shots just aren't that amazing to me. I just you know look that's just my opinion. That's my opinion. I get a lot of you love batman. But to me to me and I've shot a lot of sterns.

[38:52] I think a game like the Walking Dead is way more shots and way more interesting things to shoot at than batman does. I think even Trondas I think Ghostbusters does. I think Aerosmith does. I agree. I got to play Aerosmith and batman back and forth. And I have to say Aerosmith is super freaking cool. And the game is a lot of fun.

[39:17] And if I look down at both just in terms of artwork and the overall package and which game feels like wow. I'm definitely picking Aerosmith over batman. I just the energy level of the game, the shots, the artwork. I think it's all better on Aerosmith. And I also think that's because Aerosmith was designed from the ground up. I think batman's hands were tied a little bit.

[39:41] I also think when you jump on an SLE and you hear $15,000 and then you're like this game is $10,000 more than Aerosmith Pro. It's 10 grand more than an Aerosmith Pro. You cannot walk away feeling that that is worth it on any level. I just don't feel it.

[40:05] And I keep thinking the SLEs are going to be sort of like in a few years they're all going to just go down in value. People are going to realize it's not worth it. It's not worth it. And also when you look at Aerosmith and everything it brings, you realize you don't need to pump in so many more $1,000 just to arbitrarily jack up the price for collectors. You just want to have Pimbal Fun.

[40:29] And as a theme I'm going to be talking about more and more is this whole collector version of stuff. I think it's coming to an end with so many variations. And I don't think anything is going to be special or that collectible to be honest.

[40:39] So that's my thought on batman. I kind of started to give my thoughts on Aerosmith. I thought it was really fun. I thought Aerosmith looks amazing. I think the game is great. I played with Ed Robertson. We had a game of three Mead, Blake, and Ed were playing a premium Aerosmith.

[40:55] Yeah, the upper playfield doesn't add much. I keep thinking these upper playfields just there's no point in them. It didn't add anything on game of thrones. And I think Stern needs to figure out how to make the LE premium games, how to make them contain features that do make them feel a little bit different. But also premium. For example, I thought it was cooler that like the slimer moves differently on the LE premium. I thought that was really interesting. And then like the sculpts were different on the premium LE. And the Magnuslings, right?

[41:24] The Magnuslings on Ghostbusters are such a cool differentiator for the game. That kind of, that's to me, that's creatively making a game better and unique with a feature that's only available on the LE and the premium.

[41:40] The upper playfield that just slows the game play down, that doesn't do anything, that doesn't make the game better. It detracts from the game. But the randomness of the Magnuslings, that's cool. And it fits with the Ghostbusters theme. So really cool game Aerosmith. I would go for the pro. So my pick of the show is, I'm going to give it to you now, is Aerosmith Pro.

[42:02] And I'm not even like an Aerosmith fan, I'm not even like I would buy it. But the fact that Aerosmith Pro is like $5200 for what you get, blows my mind away. It blows my mind that you can go get that pinball machine with that LCD. It's not extra. That artwork, it's not extra. Everything comes with it that you would want for an amazing pinball experience. And it comes with the toy box.

[42:31] Like that mechanism, that toy box blows anything away in terms of a toy on Alien, blows it away. The way that ball kicks back into the box. Amazing. Amazing. This is so much cooler than the Alien Head. It's so much cooler than anything going on in Batman. Heck, it's even cooler than anything I saw in dialed in in terms of like a toy.

[42:55] Like wow, one magical toy that can be, that can like wow you every time you see it, it's just freaking cool. And watching a ball go from being in that sort of like it up kicks from the right all the way into the box. That's fucking cool. And that's what pinball needs to have. I say it over and over again. It needs something that you tell your friends when you look at this, look how fucking cool this is. And they're like wow. And then it keeps pumping balls in. And I love it too. Sometimes the box doesn't open and you hit.

[43:24] You hit the like the gestures head and then on the screen that's that's part of the code is like to whack the gesture with the ball. Super freaking cool. Super creative. 10 times cooler than jeans head and kiss. I think erasmith is fucking awesome. I really do for the money. Can't beat it. You can't beat it. And here's the thing five grand. You're going to have more fun doing that. Getting your game in a few weeks. Then suffering waiting for all these other games to come out. So my pick of the show is erasmith pro. I just think it's like cool. Like I'm going to do it.

[43:54] This is pinball awesome lights awesome art awesome sound awesome toy awesome music awesome call outs awesome animations.

[44:04] Uh duh for 50 200 bucks. Alright let's talk about spooky. So if erasmith is like 5200 bucks and then you look at Jetsons and it's $6000. It's like blow blow my head off. I can't even you can't even like compare the two games in the same way.

[44:22] There is it's just it's kind of getting embarrassing. Uh that these other games are costing more than a stern pro when they're not where near what a stern pro is.

[44:32] Uh and look Jetsons I get it it was it was contract manufactured the Jetsons is probably the most barren and basic game I've ever played. It's it's more barren than dominos. Uh but look it's designed for kids so again I you can't look at it to the lens of a pinball player.

[44:46] But here's what annoyed me I gotta be honest I went on the pinball company who commissioned spooky to make this game is on Facebook and they clearly are sponsoring the post because they've got like 1.2000 likes on it and or and all these comments.

[45:02] So they're showing the world and they're putting money behind the Facebook post and someone asked like does it have a lot of shots and they wrote it's got tons of shots.

[45:10] Tons they used to were tons of shots. This game is a lot of tons of shots and I don't know I part of me I just read that I'm like fuck guys like why are you lying about this to people.

[45:22] Uh but everyone who's gonna buy this machine is not your pin side guy they're not your pin side collector per se.

[45:30] The only people that will buy this are people who want games for kids so and and I think spooky you know let's talk about Alice Cooper and we don't know much we don't know much it seems like all of a sudden everybody on pin sides announced Cooper fan.

[45:44] I think all these sort of these themes are older genre the acts Alice Cooper hasn't been very relevant but I know he has a fan base and it fits well with spooky in the nightmare castle.

[45:57] It fits with what they're going for but here's the thing with spooky I want to say this I still love Charlie and team for getting what they you know getting all the games they do out the door they have all the good will in the hobby but now is the time game three is going to be everything for spooky.

[46:11] They need to make game three at least as good as a storm pro if not better right they said 500 premium games that are limited.

[46:20] Alright you got to own up to that now guys it's time now this is I think this is the most pivotal moment for spooky pinball because there are so many options now if a spooky pinball

[46:31] game is not anywhere near as good as attack from Mars remake which cost $6500 if you come out with Alice Cooper for $6300 and it's nowhere near as good as an attack from Mars remake or a storm pro you're I think they're going to have a hard time selling because remember this Alice Cooper is going to be a thousand dollars more than

[46:57] aerosmith pro a thousand dollars so are we going to see a toy that's as good as the toy box are we going to see artwork that's as good as aerosmith pro probably not right I mean from what I saw that's not at the level of dirty donny so I think spooky though they look I I can't say that we haven't seen anything so spooky has their work cut out for them in terms of making this game sort of showing people here's what we can do here's what we learn so far we've

[47:26] up dark game in in every way and here you go here you go I think it's I it's not make a break for them but it's a pivotal moment for them to stay viable they're going to have to get at stern pro level or better and I think everyone agrees I want to see a spooky game

[47:44] excite me as much as the people who run spooky excite me okay because it's not about like I like you so I'm going to buy from you anymore there's too much competition I want to like Charlie and team and I want to love their game as much as I love what they've done with their company and I think they know that and I think they're going to deliver that I hope so I hope so so we look forward to seeing more that comes from them I'm going to blow over the pitch and bat game with zombie yeti and Dennis Norman I I would have I played a few games

[48:14] on it the ball half the time it came out and was it was like it was like a curve ball couldn't even hit it it was impossible to hit home runs I don't like I don't think there's a market for it I don't think people are going to be that interested in it but it's interesting that's out there I think it's over price I think it needs to be like between two and $3,000 not not $40 800 I think they're out of their minds again go by an arosmith pro versus a pitch and bat that's not going to be that much fun what else happen at the show that I want to talk about alien let me talk about

[48:44] aliens so I played alien more actually I know the guy I know the guy who's getting his alien pinball machine in Houston he's a great guy I want to get him on the show to talk about his home use only experience I heard that

[48:58] Andrew was really cordial and went over the machine with him for two hours to make sure everything was was good before he took it home so kudos to Andrew for doing that you know when I played the game I still think it was it was kind of slow kind of

[49:12] floaty that wide body feel so we'll see like what it's like when it's set up in the home use only environment I didn't see the alien head grabbed the ball

[49:19] ones I didn't see it why is it so hard to get that alien head to be integrated with the game guys for F-sakes you spent all this

[49:30] time making his amazing toy let us see it when you play arosmith you're seeing the toy box in action in every game

[49:39] it always happens an alien I watch people playing one player games three player games for player games and I never saw the head grab the ball once what's going on with this thing

[49:50] it was like we're living in a world where the aliens are not even alive they're just they're making sounds but they don't they don't function make that thing needs to come alive right away

[50:00] I don't understand it I don't understand it even have a skillshot have a skillshot where you can plunge and the skill that you're trying to hit is to get the

[50:11] magnets with the alien grabs it right away get one shot to hit the alien they'll grab the ball super skill shot whatever but just make it function

[50:18] and that's it I mean look alien had a good showing alien had a good showing now it's April and we still haven't seen the the

[50:26] Ellie artwork though I still don't get it I don't get it I beat this horse a million times you guys feel the same way where is the

[50:33] Ellie artwork or it tell us Andrew tell us have you submitted it I just don't think there's going to be an L.E. I don't think you're

[50:41] going to see an L.E. I thought we would hear about it at the show we didn't there wasn't any all right what else what anything else

[50:49] my final thoughts of the show trying to think dialed in played amazingly well dialed in was a lot of fun I think everyone

[50:56] orders dialed in is going to have a good time with the game but I think dialed in needs to get out before star wars I really do I think

[51:03] Jack has got this window where if you can ship it in May if games start going out in May I think is in a good place but dialed in is like is like every

[51:12] Jersey Jack game you need to experience it in the home environment you can experience it at shows the in the right way but that being said Pat

[51:22] Loller's game is phenomenal and even at the show I think people had a lot of fun it had constant lines and I think it blows the

[51:29] hobbit and was away I really do I don't think you're ever going to see another wide body game from Jersey Jack Pimba

[51:34] all these I hope we don't I think standard body games are just so much more fun I think dialed in is going to be a great

[51:40] game I just don't know how well it's going to sell I really don't all right I don't want to get repetitive I've given you

[51:46] guys a recap already that's that's it man aero smith pro $5,200 in a world where everything is starting to creep up

[51:55] towards eight nine ten thousand dollars twelve thousand dollars super at least fifteen thousand dollars super at least

[52:01] you're adding your fucking minds if you think that Batman S. L. E. will give you ten thousand dollars more fun

[52:08] than an aero smith pro you know it's fun ten thousand dollars in cash in your pocket playing aero smith pro listening to like sweet emotion

[52:17] and listening to walk this way and having that awesome toy box it won't be over man it won't be over I'm like see

[52:23] all the elements of Pimba happening harmoniously and it's more fun when you know to pay a freaking small fortune to get those things

[52:32] and what's crazy is you can spend a small fortune and not even get those things so congratulations to Stern for once again reminding us all

[52:41] that great pinball can be had without taking one of your kids college to wishes away from them right so that's it I've been busy talking to you guys

[52:53] last few days I'm going to take a few days break but you've got more than enough episodes to catch up with I love all

[52:58] you guys who listen to the show I appreciate the support I appreciate all the positive sentiment you guys gave me when I

[53:05] ran into you at the show and I think I've been more approachable at the shows because I'm not such a dick anymore on the show

[53:11] so that's it good time to be in Pimba thanks to Kim and Ed again for an amazing show an amazing weekend treat your games with love beat on them

[53:20] and don't spend 15 grand unless everything is there and my condolences to all you a libousky early achievers I don't think you're getting your games
