[00:00] I am too sexy for your party, too sexy for your party, the way I'm disco dancing.

[00:07] I'm a model, you know what I mean, and I do my little turn on the cat boy.

[00:14] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up!

[00:30] I've never talked about it, it's crazy, I've done like 940 episodes about pinball, and I haven't covered how to not get scammed in the pinball industry.

[00:42] And there are people out there that have spent like 9 grand, 5 grand, 7 grand on games, and they never got anything.

[00:50] And I want to explain to each and every one of you how much that sucks, but also how easy it is to avoid getting scammed in the pinball world.

[00:59] Before we get there, let's talk about what's going on in the pinball industry.

[01:03] We're all still waiting for John Wick, where is this game, all the sources that said April are looking now like it's going to be May, but this game is due.

[01:13] If Stern does three cornerstone games a year, and freaking Jaws came out at the end of December, are they stalling?

[01:22] What are they waiting for? And look, every month Stern waits to release a new pinball machine that's going to be $13,000 for an LE,

[01:31] gets harder and harder for them to sell said machine because I was just looking up the James Bond thread.

[01:37] You can go get like a James Bond LE new and box for like $10,500 for a new and box James Bond.

[01:46] So everyone who's got an opened one is now worth like $9,000. That's $4,000 less.

[01:53] And nobody cares that the springs in your drop targets aren't the color blue.

[01:59] Nobody cares that you don't know how to light up the movie inserts in the game.

[02:04] Nobody cares that there's not the amount of Bond girls that you wanted in the game.

[02:08] All we're looking at right now is that everybody who bought one just lost three to $4,000.

[02:15] And this is going to be the theme, people. This is going to be the theme.

[02:19] Do you think Jaws pinballs are going to go up in value? No, they're not.

[02:23] Let's look at this Elton John Platinum Edition. So we finally got an Elton John on the second hand market.

[02:30] It's just funny being in the Elton John thread. All these owners are acting like, I'm never going to sell this game.

[02:36] I'm never going to get tired of 16 Elton John songs, half of which have no energy.

[02:42] This is the greatest machine of all time, even though it's exactly the same as Star Trek.

[02:47] It's exactly the same as every other Steve Ritchie game, but this is the one.

[02:51] This is the one that's never leaving. I'm never letting this game go, even though I don't even like the theme.

[02:57] This game is bolted to the ground. Uh-oh.

[03:00] But not so fast. Now that we're starting to see that you can go get a Platinum Edition for $11,200.

[03:09] And guess what? It's still not sold. Distributors sitting on Platinum Editions, unsold.

[03:16] And once they make a thousand CEs at $15,000 of pop, what do you think's going to happen, ladies and gentlemen?

[03:25] It ain't going up in price. It's just going to head down that yellow brick road, and we're going to start to see Elton John Collector's Editions.

[03:33] Even those are not going to be bolted to the floor, because here's the thing.

[03:37] If they even come close to making 1000 of those games, there's no way distributors have orders for 1000 games.

[03:46] And we're going to start to see those go down in value, and that's just modern pinball people.

[03:51] You know, I don't really let it bother me anymore. It's like driving a car off the lot.

[03:56] You're going to lose a lot of money in one year on every single game you get.

[04:01] So you've got to be somewhat careful, right? How much money are you going to pump in additionally into the game?

[04:08] Are you going to buy a $2,000 Foo Fighters Topper after you just lost $3,000 on the game?

[04:15] And sure, if you never sell the game, you never have a problem. I mean, that's always the case.

[04:20] If you never sell it, you'll never worry about it.

[04:22] But even if you don't want to sell it, wouldn't all of you have liked to have bought a Foo Fighters for $3,000 less?

[04:30] Wouldn't all of you have liked to have bought a freaking Godfather LE for $7,000 less?

[04:36] So that's the pain point, is even though you love the game, you can't help but feel like you could have just waited

[04:43] and listened to Kanata, and you would have had the same exact game, probably dialed in in better condition than a new in-box game,

[04:51] and you could have saved yourself thousands of dollars.

[04:53] And then you would have woke up and realized, well, hey, Kanata's Pinball Podcast is only $60 a year.

[04:59] And if I just listened to this guy, I could save thousands of dollars.

[05:03] We got the worst news this week, if you're a Blues Brothers fan, Home Pin Pinball is going to be open source making the Blues Brothers Pinball.

[05:12] I don't even know what that means. Did this company even ship a single Spinal Tap game?

[05:18] That is the worst thing you could ever hear about a theme you love, that it's going to be made by either Home Pin,

[05:25] Haggis Pinball, or American Pinball, right? That would just be like the worst news ever.

[05:30] Haggis Pinball is going to make Akira, or like Home Pin has got the license for Transformers G1 the movie.

[05:37] And so if you're a fan of the Blues Brothers, Home Pin is not going to do this game justice.

[05:42] I don't even understand how these guys are still in business. I don't even understand what Mike is doing.

[05:47] Spinal Tap looks like it came out 15 years ago, and none of these fringe companies can compete with what everyone else has going on in the Pinball.

[05:54] So it's time for some of these companies just to close their doors. Just do us a favor.

[06:00] Haggis, close your doors. Has Haggis even given a single update?

[06:04] Since they said they were recapitalizing, they haven't reached out to anybody, not to their owners, not to anybody, not to the media.

[06:11] And so hey, did Damien recapitalize? Who the heck is going to give them money?

[06:16] Think about it for a minute. Think about if you're on the other side of this whole scenario.

[06:19] Who's going to recapitalize and pump more money into Haggis Pinball? What could Damien even show them?

[06:25] The books have to be totally in the red. The company's not making money.

[06:29] And heck, nobody's going to buy this like $17,500 or oblivion edition of Centaur.

[06:36] Game over, guys. Game over at American Pinball. Where the heck is John Wick?

[06:41] Elton Johns are going to lose value. Monday morning,

[06:44] Monday morning, Canada's Pinball podcast. We're on top of it. What else is going on in the pinball world?

[06:49] I think we're all just waiting for John Wick. And that's the thing. It's like, where is this game?

[06:54] Every time there's a new stern game, it's always a fun moment because we're not going to have to wait 14 months to get the game,

[07:01] like Pulp Fiction LE. And by the way, people, I think I sold my Pulp Fiction LE for $1,000 over listing,

[07:10] so there is still some money to be made. Now, look, I could have got like $2,500 if I sold the game right away,

[07:18] but I'll take the $1,000 on the table. I think it's a good amount of money.

[07:23] I think when they make a thousand of these games, I'm not sure. And I'm not going to be able to set up Pulp Fiction in my house.

[07:30] So I'll let it go to somebody else. This money does not go far, people, in 2024.

[07:35] I'm going to tell you that right now. I've got a parking garage where two months is $550. I got to pay that.

[07:41] I had one lunch at the Grill restaurant in New York City that I'm not going to be able to expense for work because it got too expensive.

[07:50] That was $350. Every time we order Chinese food in New York City, it's like $70. Trust me, $1,000 goes nowhere in 2024.

[08:03] And my company just gave people reviews. And trust me, these companies, I mean, they're all behind the times.

[08:08] The amount of raises they're giving people is just not equal to inflation in the world.

[08:14] And something's got to give eventually. I also lost one of my childhood friends this week because the guy was holding onto my demon tires.

[08:22] Now, look, these OEM demon tires, my replacement tires with the demon logo on the tire, they're worth $5,000.

[08:31] And this guy was holding onto them for me. Good friend of mine, childhood friend.

[08:35] He moves his home, he moves into a new house and throws my tires out and doesn't even tell me.

[08:42] And here's the crazy part. He did that three years ago.

[08:45] And so after like communicating back and forth with this guy, he didn't offer to pay for them once.

[08:50] And then I send him a text message that was pretty damn stride and be like, hey, man, I want you to pay me at least $1,800 for the newer tires that don't have the demon logo on it.

[08:59] Or I don't want you to talk to me again. Like, this is ridiculous. How come you didn't just tell me to come pick up the tires?

[09:05] You know what he does? He sends me this nasty note, this nasty note about how it's all my fault.

[09:10] How like, I'm this horrible person and this and that. And if I was checking in on him, I would have known what turmoil he was going on in life three years ago.

[09:19] Get the F out of here. I'm losing some faith in humanity. The turmoil you were going through.

[09:26] If you're holding on to something for a friend, I don't care what you're going through and you're moving.

[09:32] All you got to do is don't be a selfish prick and say, hey, man, come pick up your tires and I would have got them the same day.

[09:40] And this is it as we all get older. You guys can all relate to this as you get older in life.

[09:45] You're going to bring some friends with you. You're going to cut some friends loose.

[09:50] And the moment money is involved, this is what happens all the time in life.

[09:55] Whenever there's money involved, you really find out what people's true colors are.

[10:00] And that's why I want to talk about not getting scammed in the world of pinball.

[10:04] I see this all too often. People spend money on a game.

[10:08] They hear a price on a game that just seems really too good to be true and they move on it.

[10:14] And then they do the dumbest thing imaginable.

[10:16] They give a stranger a cashier's check or cash for a game that they haven't even physically seen.

[10:25] They pay for a game that they haven't even inspected and they lose their money.

[10:29] And there was a recent story in early April where a guy gave $9,000.

[10:34] I think it was on like an Elvira premium, you know, just to save 500 bucks.

[10:39] He hears this great price from this guy. And I think it was called like in the new age.com.

[10:44] Right? Some weird name guy who's basically acting as a middleman.

[10:49] He's not an authorized dealer or distributor. Let's just start right there.

[10:54] If you do not want to get ripped off in pinball, the best thing you can do is only buy something from an authorized dealer or distributor.

[11:05] You should start there.

[11:07] Almost every single authorized dealer or distributor.

[11:11] They have so much inventory now, not just new and box.

[11:15] They also have old games.

[11:17] And here's the other thing.

[11:19] If you go to a reputable distributor or dealer, even if they don't have the game, they have other friends that are dealers and distributors.

[11:29] They will help you find one.

[11:31] It is not that hard.

[11:33] Any single pinball game that you want, you should go through people that have a reputation and whose livelihood is well documented in pinball.

[11:43] Just start right there.

[11:46] If you try to buy blindly, like off these Facebook for sale groups, you're going to get burned because here's what's happening.

[11:54] The scammers are the ones who are setting up those pages.

[11:59] They are the admins on those pages.

[12:02] And so whenever anyone tries to chime in that this looks fishy or sketchy, guess what they're going to do?

[12:08] They're going to block those people and try to prevent you from seeing the truth.

[12:13] The other thing is this, and this is a red flag.

[12:16] You've always got to look out for red flags when you're going to do a deal for this much money.

[12:21] The first red flag is this.

[12:23] When you ask a question on one of these group pages and they say PM me for details.

[12:29] No.

[12:30] There shouldn't have to be any PM me for details.

[12:33] They should let you know where the game is at and how much it costs and share photos of the games.

[12:39] But don't be fooled by photos because the number one thing a scammer is going to do is they are going to steal photos from a reputable dealer or distro.

[12:49] Not only that, some of these scammers will actually steal the entire identity of that distro and dealer and pretend to be them.

[12:58] So you got to be extra careful when it comes to this.

[13:01] But here's the ultimate thing.

[13:03] And there is one thing that you should all be doing and you will never get scammed.

[13:08] You will never get burned ever.

[13:10] And your greatest friend in the transaction of buying a pinball machine from someone you're not sure about is AmEx, MasterCard, Chase, Visa and PayPal.

[13:23] And when I say PayPal, not friends and family PayPal, make it a business transaction.

[13:29] He's not your friend.

[13:31] He's not your family member.

[13:33] Stop paying people, friends and family.

[13:36] You can never get your money back.

[13:38] And that is the biggest red flag because every single person out there can accept PayPal business.

[13:44] And you should say to them, I will pay the fee, but this is the only way I'm going to pay you because I need some protection.

[13:52] And if they're resisting that, that is the ultimate red flag that it is a scam.

[13:57] So you should never, ever in a million years, you should never directly wire people money from your checking account that you can't get back.

[14:05] You should never send a cashier's check that you can't get back unless it's a personal friend of yours and you know the individual.

[14:13] It's so weird to me that anyone ever gets burned in this hobby.

[14:17] The other thing is this, the old cliches in life are accurate.

[14:21] If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.

[14:25] If you're seeing a medieval madness royal addition for $12,000, it's not going to be real.

[14:32] If you're seeing a pirate to the Caribbean CE for $18,000, it's not going to be real.

[14:38] Right?

[14:39] You got to go off of like the market prices on these games.

[14:42] And if it's a new inbox game and you're just trying to save 500 bucks.

[14:47] And this guy just lost $9,000 trying to save himself 500 bucks.

[14:53] His money is gone.

[14:55] He's never going to get it back.

[14:57] Now he has to go deal with the local police.

[14:59] He's got to go get lawyers.

[15:01] All of that costs time.

[15:03] All of that costs money.

[15:05] And if he just bought the game from CoinTaker or Automated or Pinball Star, you could go down a list.

[15:12] I mean, in every single manufacturer out there,

[15:15] every single manufacturer out there, they list the dealers you should buy from.

[15:21] So it should be no mystery.

[15:23] The other part about Pinball that's been rough is the biggest scammers in the history of Pinball have been the companies themselves.

[15:31] Right? Isn't that crazy?

[15:32] More people have been ripped off by Kevin Kulik, by guys like John Papaduk.

[15:38] More people are getting ripped off right now by Damien over at Haggis, like Andrew Highway.

[15:42] Yeah, you all get lumped in.

[15:44] If you took people's money and you lied about when they were getting a game,

[15:49] I consider you to be ripping people off until you make good on your promises.

[15:54] So Damien, that's why you're in that set of people right now.

[15:57] People paid over a year ago.

[15:59] They still don't have their games.

[16:01] And they paid in full.

[16:02] I mean this. They paid in full.

[16:03] It's not like a little Pulp Fiction deposit where we trust CGC to get it done because they've made thousands of games.

[16:09] That's not the case with Haggis Pinball.

[16:11] But just be really careful.

[16:13] And I think all of us have learned this lesson over the years the hard way.

[16:17] So many have learned it the hard way.

[16:20] Just because someone has good intentions doesn't mean they're going to come through.

[16:25] My childhood friend had great intentions about holding onto my demon tires.

[16:30] He didn't deliver.

[16:32] And now our friendship is over.

[16:34] And that's it. It's over. I'm done.

[16:36] I don't have time for this.

[16:37] Like we're grown adults.

[16:39] We all work hard for our money.

[16:41] And I'm so tired of the victim blaming.

[16:43] It's incredible.

[16:44] And I don't want to blame any of you.

[16:46] But don't become a victim.

[16:48] This is the thing.

[16:49] Don't become a victim.

[16:50] Nobody should ever be a victim of a pinball scam.

[16:53] You should always offer to pay with your credit card and offer to pay PayPal business that will protect you.

[17:01] And you will never get ripped off.

[17:03] And if you ever want to do a deal in cash and meet somebody in person with a lot of cash on you.

[17:10] Don't be stupid.

[17:12] Tell them you want to meet outside the police station.

[17:15] Go somewhere very public where there's going to be some law enforcement.

[17:19] And don't be dumb.

[17:21] Don't trust people.

[17:23] I've learned this the hard way.

[17:24] Everybody has learned this the hard way.

[17:26] I'm going to give you another quick story.

[17:28] When I got my Dodge Demon, something about this damn demon.

[17:31] It follows me around.

[17:32] When I got my demon, right, my salesman ran into some hard times and he said, Chris, can I borrow $2,500?

[17:39] This was five years ago.

[17:41] And it was like August and he's like, I'm going to pay you back by the end of the year.

[17:45] I gave him $2,500.

[17:48] He still hasn't paid me back.

[17:50] And now he said he's going to pay me $50 a week until the end of the year, which will equal like $1,800.

[17:57] And guess what?

[17:58] He paid one week and then two weeks go by and no other payment.

[18:02] I'm just saying, don't have faith in people.

[18:06] Have faith in your partner.

[18:08] Have faith in your family and have faith in your friends that you really trust.

[18:12] And you might find out that some of those friends you thought you could trust, once money is involved, you can no longer trust them.

[18:21] But there's some really good people in this hobby.

[18:23] I want to give a shout out to somebody right now who is the epitome of a great friend.

[18:28] And even though we don't talk all the time, he is like one of the greatest guys in pinball.

[18:33] And his name is Robert Mooney.

[18:35] I'm probably listening to this right now being like, wait, what Chris, why are you talking about me right now?

[18:39] And I want to say this.

[18:40] I want to give you an example of what a great human being is like.

[18:43] So years ago, years ago when I got rid of my arcade games, I needed places to put them.

[18:48] And Robert had a beautiful arcade in New Jersey.

[18:52] And he said, Chris, like two options.

[18:54] If you want to store your fixed field, I would happily store it in my game room.

[18:58] I also could store it for you in a storage unit.

[19:01] I think he has access to some storage units.

[19:03] And he's like, I'll happily do that for you.

[19:05] And I said, Robert, put it in the arcade, let the kids enjoy it.

[19:08] And he did.

[19:09] And it was always in his arcade and it's still in his arcade.

[19:12] And guess what?

[19:13] Robert moved from New Jersey to Pennsylvania.

[19:16] Guess what?

[19:17] When he moved, he didn't hit me up three years later and said, hey, man, I forgot to move your game.

[19:23] Sorry, my bad.

[19:24] I was going through some turmoil.

[19:26] No, he still has the game.

[19:28] But here's the part that makes Robert Mooney an angel.

[19:31] One day, the monitor on this Fixed Felix Junior just craps out.

[19:37] It stops working.

[19:38] Okay.

[19:39] Now what happened?

[19:40] Did Robert just like not say anything and let me pick up the game years later and is like, oh yeah, by the way, bro, that broke like four years ago.

[19:49] Sorry, it's on you now.

[19:50] No, you know what he did?

[19:51] He fixed it.

[19:52] He found someone to come and fix the monitor.

[19:56] And that is amazing.

[19:58] And that's my point is there's going to be some people in this world who understand values and principles and friendship and what is the right thing to do.

[20:09] And then you're going to run into people that are going to do the complete opposite.

[20:13] They're going to mislead you.

[20:15] They're going to give you the run around.

[20:17] They're going to give you every excuse in the book and they're not going to be there for you.

[20:21] And the reason I love Canadian pinball podcast and the community here is I don't know what I would quite do without this community because you guys are some of the best.

[20:30] And the conversations we have on a weekly basis are amazing and it goes beyond pinball because I just feel like we need to have connections with people we trust.

[20:41] You know, but you got to be careful.

[20:42] That's the thing is you got to be careful.

[20:44] So Robert, thank you so much.

[20:45] And I think we might be putting the Fixed Felix into Killian's bedroom.

[20:50] So after all these years, I'm obviously going to do something nice for Robert for holding on to that game for so long and not charging me any money.

[20:59] And everybody look happy Monday.

[21:01] Don't get ripped off.

[21:02] John Wick is around the corner.

[21:04] Stern can't hide it forever.

[21:06] We all know it's not going to be worth $13,000 and everybody be good.

[21:11] We'll talk to you soon this week.

[21:12] Canada out.
