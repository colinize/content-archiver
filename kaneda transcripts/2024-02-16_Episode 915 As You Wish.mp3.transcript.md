[00:18] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast, where you've been in Canada while I've been really sick with a stomach bug.

[00:25] I'm still like at 50%, but I gotta get a show up for everybody.

[00:29] You can't get through the weekend without an episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, and there's been some pinball news.

[00:35] We've got a Jaws mob that finally eats the ball.

[00:39] We've got multi-morphic making, Princess Bride, something Canada told you like four months ago that was gonna happen.

[00:46] We've got pulp fictions out in the world.

[00:49] We've got loony tunes, and we've got Texas Chainsaw Massacre making its way out into the world.

[00:54] We've got American Pinball supposedly coming to Texas Pinball Festival with their next title.

[01:01] What else we got going on in the pinball world?

[01:03] We've got the Pinball Brothers and the European Gaming Company, whatever their damn call.

[01:08] They're getting ready to launch their Bally Williams remakes.

[01:12] We've got Stern Pinball Elvira Blood Kiss editions, which are now selling for like $1,000 less new in box.

[01:20] You can go get one now for like $11,000 or $10,500.

[01:25] Everybody's losing money. I love it. Everybody's losing money.

[01:28] And we've got Elton John Pinball out in the world.

[01:31] People are loving that game, but it's still not making sales go through the roof.

[01:35] Let's just start out right now with Jersey Jack.

[01:38] They've got Elton John collector's editions on the line.

[01:42] Now that means they didn't make many platinum editions of the game.

[01:47] So the strategy to put Christopher Francis artwork on the platinum edition to drive sales, was it successful?

[01:54] It's a beautiful game. There's just something about this game that's not clicking with your wallets.

[02:00] Like the gameplay is there. The music is there. The shots are there.

[02:05] The toys aren't necessarily there, but the game is so much fun.

[02:09] And yet people don't want it.

[02:11] I think this game is suffering from a revolt of everything we've seen in the pinball world over the last couple of years.

[02:18] And you sort of drew a line in the sand and you said, hey, the game we're really going to take it out on is Elton John.

[02:25] And it's really strange to me because Elton John is a much better game than Toy Story 4.

[02:30] It's a much better game than the Godfather.

[02:33] And I think those two titles are going to sell a lot more units than Elton John.

[02:38] And if they're moving on to the collector's editions already, what does that mean for the future of this title?

[02:44] Are distros sitting on platinum editions once they make all these collector's editions?

[02:49] And there's no way. There's no way. Ladies and gentlemen, we both know this.

[02:53] There's no way they sold a thousand collector's editions of Elton John.

[02:58] There's no way they sold a thousand of Toy Story or a thousand of like freaking Godfather.

[03:04] I bet they've only made 500 of each of these games in collector's edition format.

[03:10] It's a beautiful game. It's a Steve Ritchie in Jersey Jack clothing, and it's just not clicking with people.

[03:17] Now, speaking of clicking with people, let's get to the Princess Bride,

[03:22] the Jerry Stelenberg Multimorphic second licensed game on his platform.

[03:28] I don't know about you, but I like this movie when I was a kid, when I was about Fred Savage's age.

[03:33] I think all of us loved this movie back in, what is it, like sometime in the 80s?

[03:38] It was very romantic. It had Andre the Giant. It was funny. It was the kind of movie

[03:43] you could watch with your parents and not be embarrassed.

[03:47] And it had a lot of good comedy. It had a lot of memorable lines and memorable scenes.

[03:52] And so I really do love this movie. Now, that being said,

[03:56] Do I Think the Princess Bride is going to make for an amazing pinball experience?

[04:01] I sort of put this theme in a similar category as Labyrinth, right?

[04:05] It's like a cult classic. Certain people love it. Certain people don't.

[04:09] Did you carry your love for this theme into adulthood? That's the big thing.

[04:14] Are you still someone who wants to spend this much money? Remember,

[04:18] because a multimorphic is like 10 to $13,000,

[04:22] depending on whether or not you get the LE or the regular.

[04:25] I don't know. All these things are sort of super limited if you ask me because nobody really owns a multimorphic.

[04:31] Is this going to be the kind of theme that makes you want to plunk down this much money?

[04:35] Now, look, if you own an existing multimorphic cabinet, right? If you have the platform now,

[04:41] this is a great day for you. All 200 people out there who do have it,

[04:45] this is a really great day for you. But for everybody else,

[04:48] it's ironic that the main line in Princess Bride is,

[04:53] As you wish. You know what Wesley says to what?

[04:56] Buttercup when he's rolling down the hill,

[04:59] as you wish. And that is the one thing that Jerry Steltenberg will not give to the pinball community.

[05:05] He won't give them a pinball machine as they wish,

[05:09] because everybody wishes it to be in a normal cabinet.

[05:13] And it's almost at the point now where Jerry has gone past the point of no return,

[05:17] because he's all in on this platform. And so when this game gets revealed on Monday,

[05:23] you have to not just want this game, you're going to want to have to go all in on the platform.

[05:28] Now look, I've heard good things about Final Resistance.

[05:31] I don't know that much about Weird Owl, I haven't played it that much.

[05:35] But I do know that there's not a lot of love for this platform.

[05:39] And if you buy one, you better buy one wanting to own it forever.

[05:43] Because as we've seen on the used market,

[05:46] it's almost impossible to get rid of these things without not just losing your shirt,

[05:51] you're going to lose your pants and your underwear when you try to sell one of these P3 Multimorphic platforms.

[05:57] And I still just don't get it. I just don't get it.

[06:00] At what point is Jerry going to read the room?

[06:04] Is he going to hear the feedback? I mean, just go into the thread itself.

[06:07] Everybody is just destroying the fact and almost praying and wishing that anybody would make this game

[06:14] other than Multimorphic.

[06:15] How do you go on a 10-year pinball manufacturing, build my own company from the ground up,

[06:21] and I'm going to create something that people don't want?

[06:24] And they are very vocal that they don't want it.

[06:27] And it's like so weird that it's your platform that's turning everybody off more than anything.

[06:33] Sometimes when you just try to be different, it doesn't always work out.

[06:37] And this hasn't really worked out for Jerry.

[06:40] You know, look, I'm keeping an open mind to see the game,

[06:42] but there's no way I'm ever going to go in on this platform.

[06:45] When I go through the thread too, almost half of the people in the thread

[06:49] were wishing this would be a barrels of fun game.

[06:52] Now, obviously barrels of fun is not making this.

[06:54] They have to make all their labyrinth games, but that just goes to show you.

[06:59] If you have an ambitious idea and everyone's just telling you, stop with all the ambition,

[07:04] just make a damn good pinball machine in a normal pinball format

[07:08] and your company would be twice, maybe five times more successful.

[07:12] You know, and that's just it.

[07:13] That's where we're all at with this game.

[07:16] We're going to see it on Monday.

[07:18] The other weird part was this.

[07:19] The fact that they didn't just like black out the image so you couldn't see it

[07:23] if you change the contrast on your computer.

[07:27] I mean, it's so embarrassing.

[07:28] It's so embarrassing that we're looking at this game in the worst possible way.

[07:33] And now we can kind of see this like highly contrasted embossed like image

[07:38] of the cabinet and the back box.

[07:41] We can see the little multi-morphic M on the coin door.

[07:44] Really, really bad marketing.

[07:46] And it's just funny to me.

[07:47] There's a reason why they don't want to tell you multi-morphic is making it

[07:51] because it's a turn off.

[07:52] It actually turns people off.

[07:54] All right.

[07:54] I apologize to my multi-morphic fans out there.

[07:58] All three of you, please accept my forgiveness.

[08:01] All right.

[08:01] So we got that going on.

[08:02] We got pulp fictions making their way out there on location.

[08:06] They are making their way to customers.

[08:09] And with this game coming out, it's just like finally we get the pulp fictions, right?

[08:13] Now, I don't even think the Ellie or the bad mo fo versions of this game with the topper.

[08:18] I don't think those games are going to be made to like the summertime.

[08:22] I'm kind of happy about that.

[08:23] I don't have to write a check to sometime in June, July, maybe August.

[08:27] And so it's going to be a long road for all of us bad mo fo's.

[08:31] We'll see if this game, once it's out there, once we play it a lot more,

[08:36] once this game makes its way into a home environment.

[08:39] I'm really curious to see how people feel about pulp fiction after they've played it 500 times.

[08:45] It presents really nicely at a show.

[08:48] Now, there are issues with the audio at the show.

[08:50] And I've seen this come up a few times in the thread.

[08:53] People are concerned about the mono audio of the game and whether or not it's kind of scratchy

[08:59] and coming through the speakers distorted.

[09:02] Now, when I was playing this game at TPF, I did notice that when you really crank the volume,

[09:07] it was very tinny and distorted sounding.

[09:10] And so David Thiel jumped into the thread and said, Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

[09:14] I did the sound on this game and there's no way it should sound that way.

[09:18] And we have to make sure they hooked up the speakers properly to the amplifiers in the game.

[09:23] And you should not get a distorted sound.

[09:26] He's like, I did not design this game to sound like it comes from the 1970s.

[09:30] It is supposed to sound as good as a modern pinball machine.

[09:35] So who's right and who's wrong?

[09:37] Again, we just need to see more reviews of this game as it gets out into the wild.

[09:42] But always a good day when Chicago Gaming Company actually decides to make something.

[09:47] They're really good at building machines.

[09:49] They build some of the highest quality pinball machines in the world.

[09:53] So I'm glad to see this game come out.

[09:55] Do we even speculate what's next from Chicago Gaming Company?

[09:59] I feel like they're going to announce their next game, maybe March of 2025.

[10:04] And then we'll finally get it in March of 2026.

[10:08] So we're a good two years away from whatever else is around the corner at Chicago Gaming Company.

[10:14] It feels like an eternity, right?

[10:15] Two years from now.

[10:16] Are all of these companies going to make it?

[10:19] We'll see.

[10:19] We had a little bit of an update on Haggis Pinball and where the money is.

[10:23] I think that was my last show before I got sick.

[10:26] Who's got the Haggis deposit money?

[10:28] And now we know that that money went from the distributor to Haggis Pinball.

[10:33] So Haggis has your thousand dollars.

[10:36] I just want to say this.

[10:37] I got hit up by a gentleman in Europe.

[10:40] He ordered nine machines from Damien.

[10:44] He was told in May of 2023 that he needed to pay in full for all nine of his games.

[10:51] And those games would arrive in eight weeks.

[10:54] He just received two games from Damien from that order in May.

[10:59] He still owed seven more machines.

[11:02] And these are fathoms, people.

[11:04] They're not Santars.

[11:06] So I just want to say for the record, I still think Haggis Pinball is stringing everybody along.

[11:13] They have to be running on fumes.

[11:16] And their entire business model is robbing Peter to pay Paul.

[11:20] And if you go in on a Santar, you have nobody to blame but yourself.

[11:25] I think you should wait.

[11:26] I think you should pressure Damien to make the games first, send the games to the distributors,

[11:32] and then buy the game.

[11:33] Do not risk any of your hard-earned money on this company because they do not tell the truth.

[11:40] And they are not honest with their customers.

[11:43] And the reason why more people don't speak up is they just want to get their damn games

[11:48] because they've been waiting for two years.

[11:51] Let's move on from this company.

[11:53] All right, what else is going on this weekend?

[11:55] Pinball, Papa's coming back.

[11:57] That's awesome.

[11:58] I don't really talk about pinball tournaments.

[12:00] But if you wanted to see the return of Papa, you've got it, ladies and gentlemen.

[12:05] And then we've got Jaws Pinballs.

[12:07] And Ellie's are being unboxed as of today.

[12:10] I saw Ellie unboxings this week.

[12:13] It's always amazing to me how well-stern does this.

[12:16] It's like they just get it done.

[12:18] They reveal a game.

[12:20] They take your money.

[12:21] You have the game within a few weeks.

[12:24] There's no drama.

[12:25] There's no mystery.

[12:26] I think Jaws Ellie looks okay.

[12:28] It's not blowing me away.

[12:30] There's just something about it, right?

[12:32] It's nice.

[12:32] The white armor is nice.

[12:33] I won't lie.

[12:34] The side art on the cabinet is not blowing me away.

[12:37] The play field artwork is all blue.

[12:40] There's not much on it.

[12:41] It's a pretty empty art package in the game overall.

[12:44] But that's not the biggest conversation happening this week.

[12:46] It's not that people are getting their Jaws Ellie's

[12:49] because we all know those Jaws Ellie's are about to lose $2,000 in value in just two months.

[12:55] The big news of the week is there is a mod for this game.

[12:59] There is a mod for the Jaws Pro right now

[13:02] that actually has the ball going into the mouth of the shark

[13:06] and kicks it out underneath into the Vuck back to the right flipper.

[13:11] And not just that, it simulates the gameplay with the captive ball.

[13:15] There's optos and you have to hit them three times

[13:17] just like hitting the captive ball three times.

[13:20] And then the ball goes into the rubber shark mouth.

[13:22] And not just that, the shark wiggles like Jaws back and forth like he's attacking the ball.

[13:28] I give credit where credit is due.

[13:30] This is an engineering feat that is pretty impressive.

[13:33] I mean, it looks like it's stock.

[13:35] This thing looks like it came from Stern Pimball.

[13:37] The way this gentleman made this mod really, really well done.

[13:41] Does it look a little silly with those posts like on the sides of Jaws?

[13:45] A little bit.

[13:46] It's a little bit wonky.

[13:47] I'm not gonna lie.

[13:48] But at least he did something that should have been done at the factory.

[13:53] And I don't believe Keith Elwin when he says it wasn't fun.

[13:57] What are you talking about Keith?

[13:58] How is this not more fun than hitting a captive ball?

[14:02] And I think Elwin's excuse is just that.

[14:04] I think it's an excuse.

[14:06] Now this mod is $500.

[14:09] It's the price of a PlayStation 5.

[14:12] It's half the price of a plastic Godzilla topper.

[14:16] That's a lot of money, but then it doesn't feel like a lot of money

[14:19] when you think about how much toppers and other shenanigans are in Pimball these days.

[14:23] But here's the big thing about this mod.

[14:26] I don't like mods that change the game.

[14:28] Like this change is the gameplay.

[14:30] Once you install this mod, all of a sudden the ball is gonna go places it didn't go before.

[14:35] All of a sudden it's gonna feed the ball into your flippers in which it didn't before.

[14:39] And there's also the ability with this mod because it's using optos instead of hitting that captive ball three times.

[14:46] If the ball rolls from left to right or right to left, it can actually roll over those optos at once.

[14:53] And so that's like counting three shots in a row.

[14:56] You're now changing what Keith Elwyn wanted in his game.

[15:00] And you're changing how the game plays.

[15:03] I just don't like this stuff.

[15:05] And the reason I don't like it is first and foremost, we shouldn't even have to do this.

[15:11] Stern should have had a great white shark that eats the freaking ball.

[15:15] The fact that you have to now go spend $500 more money on this mod is ridiculous.

[15:21] And now they're also gonna make a mod like this for the Ellie's and the premiums of the game.

[15:26] And again, like it's too much hacking up of the game.

[15:30] So if you look at the Ellie and the premium, are you really gonna remove the boat that Stern put into the game?

[15:36] You're gonna replace the shark.

[15:37] You're gonna change the way the ball goes.

[15:39] I don't like it.

[15:40] On some level, it feels like we're cheating the game.

[15:43] We're cheating the design.

[15:45] And now we're gonna have a variety of different JAWS machines out there.

[15:48] Some with this mod, some that don't have this mod.

[15:51] How is this now gonna work with Stern inside or connected?

[15:54] As people are playing games and setting high scores, is it gonna be able to detect whether or not this mod is installed?

[16:01] And that's a really big question mark, right?

[16:03] At what point is Stern gonna put an end to this?

[16:06] They're absolutely gonna be able to detect if something else is happening in the game.

[16:11] So while I'm impressed by the engineering here, I'm more concerned about what's happening in Pimbal.

[16:17] That for this much money, we have to now go and hack up our machines and rely on the mod community to get what we should get from the factory.

[16:27] And the more we do this, the more we keep showing these companies that we're willing, right, to accept the cheap plastic crap they give us,

[16:36] because we're gonna spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars extra on the mod community, why should they even make the effort?

[16:43] And you best believe, I bet these Pimbal companies now are saying, don't even bother with that.

[16:48] The mod community will make a fix for that.

[16:51] So let's go really cheap on the Ghostbusters Firehouse and the mod community will fix it.

[16:56] Let's go really cheap on Jaws and someone else will fix it.

[16:59] So as long as we show them that we're willing to accept less for more money, why would they ever change?

[17:06] I think a mod should just enhance something that's already there and it should not change gameplay.

[17:13] I will die on that hill, everybody.

[17:15] Now, speaking of dying on the hill, I'm still really sick.

[17:18] My stomach is still killing me, but I really wanted to get everybody a show.

[17:23] Thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[17:25] I really do appreciate it and I do miss not getting you three shows this week.

[17:30] We're gonna be back on Monday.

[17:31] Lots to talk about.

[17:33] We're gonna get to see a new Pimbal machine, Princess Pride from Multimorphic.

[17:37] Yeah, can't wait.

[17:38] Can't wait, but it is always an exciting day.

[17:41] When we get to see a new Pimbal machine and hey, if Josh Coogler is coding this thing

[17:46] and it's got all the clips from the movie and it looks like a ton of fun.

[17:51] Who knows? Jerry might have something that's gonna make people change their minds.

[17:55] Everybody have a great Friday.

[17:57] I will do my best to do a Saturday morning spectacular tomorrow.

[18:01] The hardest part for me with this stomach bug is I can't sleep.

[18:05] It's just like pressure inside my stomach.

[18:07] Like somebody is inflating a balloon and trying to take Canada out from the Pimbal airwaves.

[18:13] You can't stop Canada.

[18:15] You can only subscribe.

[18:17] Everybody later.
