[00:00] I just want to do a short little podcast this morning talking about a couple topics the pin stadium thing

[00:05] Which just keeps circling around itself and and the big Lebowski now. I don't want to I don't even have intro music

[00:11] We'll just we'll just start it now and let you guys enjoy a little snackable addition of canators pinball podcast

[00:20] All right, so this was originally going to be a pin-side babies episode and I actually tried to record it a few times

[00:26] And I was like why am I there's not enough material here, right?

[00:30] Sometimes there's just not enough material to do an entire rant and it's also like

[00:35] There's also level of a nameless around this whole thing that I want to talk about and mainly it's this

[00:42] Obviously pin-side needs to work on its marketplace and the ability for people marketing their products to connect

[00:51] To pinball machines and a product like pin stadium is for the most part a universal product that almost every single

[00:59] Pinball machine could implement into the machine itself whether it's a new game an old game and yes

[01:06] I saw people complaining about this a homebrew game

[01:10] You could also install the pin stadium lights right because it only requires a power source

[01:16] But as someone so intelligently pointed out it would be like

[01:22] Advertising pin balls, you know, just just steel pin balls

[01:27] Come up every single time you search for a game because every game uses pin balls and it gets redundant

[01:33] It gets repetitive and they need to figure out a better system and they will and they will and and I'm actually here in robins defense

[01:40] That I think it's crazy that people are going on to the forum and and expecting to see immediate results

[01:48] Like people are like refreshing their page like I've come back two hours later and I'm still seeing

[01:53] Pin stadium ads I've come back 10 hours later

[01:56] People in who live on pinside and you know who you are you know who you are and you know who they are

[02:02] They lose sense of time and they lose sense of reality and they lose sense of the real world and life

[02:10] And life happens for people

[02:12] You know and I think it's completely unfair that if something is a little bit upsetting you on pinside about how the site is

[02:19] Operating to expect Robin like as if he's sitting at some pinside terminal and with a headset on and in like 18 screens open

[02:28] And and he's not going to stop until he immediately fixes every little bug the site has no people have like real lives

[02:35] Here's the other solution that I think a lot of these hyperpossors don't understand if you don't like something

[02:41] How about this or are you waiting for something to be improved?

[02:43] How about you just like turn off the site for like a week or turn off the site for like

[02:48] You know a few days and and come back when these things don't upset you so much and and and and I've seen it

[02:54] You know, I've seen people they get they get sucked into this vortex of the kind of behavior

[03:00] That is sort of encouraged and it's addictive behavior

[03:05] You know, we didn't even talk about this but Odin who's one of the most prolific

[03:09] posters on pinside he had a meltdown he goes away. He realizes his behavior

[03:15] Was in who he wanted to be and he went away for a while he deactivated his account

[03:20] But now he's back and it's interesting watch his behavior over the last few weeks

[03:25] He first comes back and he's very shy. He's very quiet

[03:28] He starts to get retrospective, you know

[03:31] I'm how reflective on how he's going to change and how it became too much

[03:35] But now now read him

[03:38] He's starting to slip back into his old ways and that's what happens with pinside

[03:42] Is you get addicted to the attention and the be and and sort of like the uh the reaction is addictive

[03:48] I mean it this is scientifically proven

[03:51] That the reaction you get on online forums when your telephone blows up with a text message the endorphins that are released when people respond to you

[04:00] Are the same endorphins that are released with alcohol and with uh tobacco and with drugs even you know

[04:07] So it's addictive behavior and the only way to prevent it and and prevent sliding back down

[04:14] Is to extremely limit the amount of time you spend in it, but that's the problem right the internet

[04:20] I mean and cell phone addiction and screen addiction. It's got all of us

[04:24] Under its web, but anyway anyway

[04:26] So look this this happens and these people are complaining about it robin doesn't fix it right away. He will fix it

[04:32] Okay

[04:33] Is it that big of a deal? I mean if you step back and say is that that big of a deal when I'm in a thread and I'm reading about a game

[04:38] Yeah, like I it is annoying seeing all those pinstadium ads with the robot and the fusion and I don't you know all these like

[04:46] Like psychedelically colored things that are selling me a lighting system like I get it

[04:51] I think we all understand by now what pinstadium is. I mean that's the other thing too is

[04:56] pinstadium for the most part

[04:59] If I were him. I mean, I think most if I think mostly everyone and their mother and their children and their dog and their pet frog

[05:06] By now who is on pinstead who is there frequently?

[05:10] I think we know what your product is Scott

[05:13] I don't think we need another

[05:15] 15,000 reminders every single day that being said

[05:20] It doesn't really annoy me that much because the marketplace for the most part it's a separate section

[05:25] I mean, I get that they have a link to some marketplace ads

[05:28] But if you're really looking for something on pinstead are you gonna have a hard time finding it?

[05:32] Absolutely not. I mean Robin has built a great site that has a marketplace. It has a search bar. It has everything you need

[05:40] I get that it might be visually upsetting to you

[05:44] But that's not a big deal to me. I mean, maybe it is a big deal to you now the question of

[05:49] of Scott linking his product to every single pinball machine

[05:54] Is what I think might be creating this and what about the topic of the home brew machine makers and them having

[06:02] pinstadium link their product to their home brew game and I saw someone on there was like complaining about this

[06:08] It's like this is wrong like he shouldn't be allowed to you know advertise against my creation

[06:14] And how do I think about that? I mean, this is an interesting point

[06:19] But I think once you use pinstead and this is the thing that people don't realize once you use pinstead to advertise your home brew game

[06:27] once you use pinstead to get your home brew product in front of the pinstead audience

[06:33] Pinsteads allowed to allow its advertisers access to you and your products

[06:38] I mean wake up your grown men. You're not little kids. This is the way it works

[06:43] Pinstead is making money

[06:45] With these advertisers and with these companies that are spending money to market on their site

[06:51] They're what is keeping pinstead around

[06:54] So if you enjoy pinstead and you love pinstead you're gonna have to put up with some you know pinstead advertising

[07:01] And all this advertising this is why I just find it funny that these grown men are like again

[07:06] They just get all Ben at a shape all the advertising at least on pinstead is pinball related

[07:11] Which is great. I mean all the and then you could say what you will about pinstadium spamming it

[07:16] But you're not getting served up ads for you know

[07:19] Ladies hygienic products and for like sports cars and for you know shampoo and conditioners

[07:26] Everything is at least relevant to the thing you're very much into

[07:30] But that's not enough people need to still like get all upset about this right

[07:34] But here's what I had a big problem with is I really like pinstadium products and look

[07:39] It's it's an opinion you can have your opinion about it and you can not like their products

[07:44] I have them on my Batman. I've seen people put them on Willy Wonka. They do make a huge difference. Okay now if you don't like them

[07:53] That's cool. I saw people debating whether or not

[07:57] Scott at pinstadium when he does the before and after photos if he's darkening the before photos to make the after photos

[08:05] Seem even more impressive and I don't know if he is I'll tell you this if I was a marketer

[08:10] Absolutely, I would do this a little bit, you know, it's it's a disingenuous

[08:15] It's only disingenuous really if the after photo is doctor to make it brighter than it really is and yeah

[08:22] Maybe it's a little disingenuous, but we all know one thing

[08:26] I don't think anyone would argue with this that the majority of pinball machines have horrible GI lighting

[08:32] They do there's just something off about so many games

[08:36] I've played most recent stern machines and they're very dark

[08:40] I've played most Jersey Jack machines and they're very dark don't even get me started on how dark alien pinball is

[08:47] It's one of the darkest games ever you can barely see the ball and it's it's ironic to me

[08:52] That the guy who's once again on another one of his crew seeds that we apparently can never stop you know who he is

[09:00] He his name is the same as a hotel chain

[09:02] Hilton is once again on her crusade to take down

[09:07] Pinstadium I mean you go in the threads and he's just spent he's spamming the threads with his

[09:14] Desire to destroy this company and it and it's pretty transparent

[09:18] And it's funny to me because alien pinball again that he's shield so badly is in desperate need of pin stadium lights

[09:26] Okay, so here's the thing too. It's like the other thing that I saw

[09:30] Was that hilton and this is what he's he's sort of like digging in on apparently at pinburg or at various tournaments during different games

[09:38] That we're using pin stadium lights every once in a blue moon. I mean every once in a blue moon

[09:44] Someone will install pin stadium lights incorrectly and there were a couple instances where pin stadium lighting system

[09:53] Fell off and because they're magnetized to the side there they fell off and they ended up on the play field making them having to stop the

[10:03] The tournament or stop you know stop game play you know during an official pinball tournament

[10:08] And any sort of like is on this mission to be like everyone who plays in tournaments hates these things and doesn't want them anywhere near pinball

[10:16] And everyone who plays pinball location hates these things and doesn't want them anywhere near pinball

[10:20] And it's just kind of crazy to me because you know to me hilton

[10:25] He's not a pinball collector. I mean he's an operator

[10:27] He's more for the guys and tournaments

[10:29] He's on the wrong site like he doesn't understand what collectors want and how collectors want their machines to be lit up nicely

[10:37] And he goes on these crusades

[10:39] To destroy people and to defame them and to destroy their products and I really think you know

[10:44] Pinside should again take a long hard look and if you just remove a few of these people who go on these constant crusades

[10:52] Who ironically are the ones that are spamming most threads and

[10:56] Rooting people's ability to just make up their own minds because we have to hear these individuals like 15 times a day on each thread

[11:04] It will be better off. We'd be better off now. He said his piece

[11:08] But again to scots defense if people are gonna install their product wrong

[11:12] And they're gonna like fall off during a tournament

[11:14] So be it look last time I checked there were pin stadium lights on Willie Wonka during the pinbird final

[11:21] And they were fine and I didn't hear anyone complain

[11:24] But then I saw this

[11:25] Someone uploaded a photo and said look at these disgusting Christmas lights on this game and it was a photo from pinberg

[11:32] Now yes, it looked like all around the uh the game there were like almost like a strip of Christmas lights

[11:40] But here's the thing those weren't the pin stadium lights on the glass that people were seeing those were reflections

[11:46] From all the overhead lighting inside the arena in which pinberg was taking place

[11:53] And so again, I think this defamation of the pin stadium product is is is really uncalled for and unnecessary and I think very juvenile and and I think very

[12:06] It's just just a bitter use of people's behavior on pinside because it's it's not really fair to be doing this to this company

[12:14] And the other thing is this look

[12:15] This is the other part and I'm trying to see both sides of this debate is that scot will bump up his pin stadium

[12:22] Thread that he created like it's his it's his thread about his product and he he bumps it up

[12:28] All the time maybe every day maybe a few times a week and people are saying that he's spamming his own

[12:35] Thread by constantly bumping it to the top of the pinside leaderboard

[12:40] Okay, ladies and gentlemen

[12:42] This is this man's business. He's marketing his company. He's trying to sell his product

[12:47] He's as excited about his product if you've met him at a show

[12:51] He is always very enthusiastic and excited about what he's selling

[12:55] I don't understand why if you have a problem with him doing that

[13:00] Why you can't just drain the thread you'll never see it again

[13:04] Instead of that

[13:06] Pinside babies love to run into a burning house with a a canister of gasoline and

[13:13] Throw it around the place and then start complaining that things are burning

[13:18] What why why does it upset you so much that he's trying to sell his product

[13:23] At least he's making a product in the pinball world that a lot of people love and enjoy and that's the other thing that happens with these threads is

[13:32] Is the people who love pinstadium that they they're like not really in these threads in which the angry mob is tearing it down

[13:40] And I know what it's like to be in in those threads

[13:42] I mean whenever someone starts a thread about canator right?

[13:45] Oh, what a jerk what a sociopath what it what it what it when a lunatic he is it's all negativity for the most part

[13:51] A few people are like why I actually really enjoy the show and then and then you look at my numbers

[13:56] And it's like a lot of people actually really enjoy the show

[13:58] But you know what I think people when they enjoy something even when it comes to a game or a pinball product

[14:05] They normally stand on the sidelines and just let the angry mob sort of like destroy itself and go crazy

[14:12] And that's what's happening I think in this thread long story short

[14:16] I think pinstadium is a great product. I think pinside will figure out how to make the marketplace

[14:22] Operate differently where things won't be spammed like this

[14:25] I think Scott will hopefully learn a little bit of a lesson from all this and not

[14:30] Continue to like link to every single game we get it, you know, we get what you make

[14:35] And I think no one will care in a few days and that's that okay

[14:41] Something else I wanted to talk about that I saw which uh is just

[14:46] Uh, man. This is just like stupid. Now if you if you got one of the 40 a.r.a. big Lebowski games

[14:53] The last thing you should be doing on planet earth is boasting and bragging and

[14:59] And like rubbing it in people's faces and there is an individual on pinside

[15:03] I'm not I mean, I think is I think it's like wolfman or something or something like that

[15:08] He is doing just that and and I think that is just despicable behavior. I mean this this is not

[15:17] A joyous situation

[15:19] And it shouldn't be looked at one these games are being basically taken

[15:24] From someone else who bought it and result and I know you could say hey christia hypocrite your buy one. I know I'm buying one

[15:31] Um, but I do not for a minute think that this is how

[15:36] A game should be bought. I don't think this is how a game should be available for sale

[15:40] I just knew this is how it would go down because of how dutch pinball fumbled everything so badly

[15:46] That it was going to end like this that they were gonna resell games and on that level

[15:52] It's like I'm okay. I'm okay

[15:55] Like grabbing one, but I would never in a million years

[16:00] Say to someone who got burned like I'm super excited to get I I am not you know, it's it's weird to me because

[16:07] I still I still have done nothing but anxiety around this deal. I nothing but

[16:14] I'm very lukewarm that this was the right thing to do. I'm very hesitant to like I'm not doing backflips

[16:20] I'm like I'm it's not like I'm counting down the days till I get it

[16:24] I'm still very nervous about the quality of these machines. I'm still very nervous about the spare parts that will be available

[16:31] I'm still very nervous about

[16:33] You know the code in the game, which nobody really wants to talk about code is very shallow in the game

[16:38] I don't think it's gonna be touched again. I just I think this game has a lot of people

[16:43] Overly excited and I think there's a lot of hype surrounding this game because of the rarity of the game

[16:48] I mean think about it. We all get really excited when we play a game that not a lot of people have played

[16:53] That's very rare. It has that sort of novelty factor

[16:57] But when you own one you can play it every day

[16:59] Is it going to be a game that you're gonna want to keep for a very long time if it is very shallow if it's very questionable quality

[17:07] You know for the for the 40 or so people that have had one a bunch of them went up for sale

[17:12] You know, it wasn't like these were this game was like bolted to people's floor and wasn't going anywhere

[17:17] And I've learned the lesson in that is like if you chase after these just like rare collectibles that you really don't want to play

[17:22] Because you don't want to break anything you don't want to like you know

[17:26] Have chip the play field and it if you comes more of like a museum piece

[17:30] You're not gonna have much fun owning it unless you have a big collection

[17:34] I don't I mean everything that goes into my house has to be like has to be played in a joyder. It makes no sense

[17:40] But I just think anyone who's bragging and sort of rubbing it in people's faces is pretty despicable and we should not

[17:46] Encourage that kind of behavior

[17:49] All right, what else is going on right? So the collectors editions of woolly walk

[17:52] I'm just like doing another show right now. I'm not gonna I'm gonna end this quickly

[17:55] Jack needs to show the collectors edition

[17:57] I got hit up by Joe at pinball star and he's like he's like Chris

[18:01] Um, I'm fully transparent with you guys by the way like I'm telling you the conversations I have you say Chris

[18:06] Are you out like I can take it from your last podcast that you must be out on willy walk up

[18:11] And so I've got that in my head and I'm like well

[18:14] I'm not out quite yet and I said this to Joey said look to be fair Joe to be fair

[18:20] I um, I haven't seen what the final collectors edition is and I keep hearing they're gonna make it really special

[18:26] so

[18:28] You know should I be out on the game because the code isn't exactly where I wanted to be maybe right

[18:33] But what what harm is it let me ask you what harm is it in me just staying in on a thousand dollar refundable deposit

[18:41] On willy-wanka and just waiting until I see it

[18:44] I think anyone who already paid for the collectors edition is pretty stupid because why wouldn't you just wait to see what they're gonna deliver

[18:51] And if it's not that impressive just save yourself so much money and go get an le of the game

[18:57] Uh, and you know that's what I would do. I mean

[19:00] No brainer no brainer. So that's what that's where I'm at

[19:04] um

[19:05] Pired to the Caribbean I need to make up my mind

[19:06] I think I need to make up my mind today on this pirate to the Caribbean collectors edition that I put a deposit non-refundable

[19:12] refundable deposit down with a really awesome dude

[19:16] Uh, it's a beautiful machine. It's a collectors edition. I'll say this right now on this show two day

[19:20] If you listen to this show if anyone wants to collect his edition pirate to the Caribbean

[19:24] Uh, for 13,500 dollars, right? I'm not making any money on this. That's what the price was

[19:29] It's fully modded. It's incredible. It's gorgeous. It's got all cliffies installed

[19:33] It's got all the starposts installed. It's got the the washers. It's got the monkey. It's got

[19:39] It's got like that nice gun shooter rod. It's got everything you'd want from the mod uh community

[19:45] If you are interested hit me up at canada pinballgmail.com. I will happily put you in touch with the seller

[19:52] And again, I'm still not 100 I need to tell them tonight whether I'm in or out

[19:55] But I will happily connect you and allow you to have that deal

[19:59] I think it is a great deal. I think the one on pinstri now is for sale for $15,000 with less mods in this game

[20:06] Um, you know, that was my goal my goal was to get a pirates into this house

[20:11] See what all the hoopla was about see if I would actually enjoy it in a home use environment

[20:15] And then wait to see like if willy-wanker code progressed in a different way

[20:20] Things are happening. I was not expecting here's the thing. I was not expecting the big Lebowski to be available

[20:26] I can't I just you know, I'm gonna be transparent here too. I'm planning a beautiful honeymoon in Japan with Brenda

[20:32] I do really well in my career. I do I think I do I never know

[20:36] I mean I do well enough

[20:38] But man a lot of these high ticket items have hit me all at once and I and I had to just stop and say I can't do it all

[20:44] I can't do it all I can't buy a Lebowski and a pirate to the Caribbean and go to Japan and fly business class and eat at michael and star restaurants

[20:52] And and and and it's you know all these ends add up and before you know it

[20:57] I mean just the two pinball machines alone like let's just break this down the two pinball machines alone

[21:03] Are basically 25,000 dollars you have to make a hundred thousand dollars before taxes just to pay for those two pinball machines

[21:11] It's amazing how quickly it just goes out the door and I don't want to be house broke or pinball broke or I

[21:20] I love having money in my checking. I love having money in my savings. I love having money in my investments

[21:25] I love I love being carefree now say this and then I'm gonna let you guys go

[21:31] The most carefree thing you can do and I do it every morning at 6 a.m

[21:35] And I see someone else doing this and he's getting into it and I want to congratulate him

[21:39] That's Jared over at Stern

[21:41] He's losing weight and he's going to planet fitness and he's exercising a lot and he's posting his results

[21:47] I'll tell you this all this pinball could go away all this stuff all these pin stadium debates

[21:52] I could care less if pinside went away tomorrow. I could care less

[21:55] I gotta be honest if this podcast went away tomorrow

[21:57] It doesn't really matter what matters always to me the most fulfilling thing to me is waking up in the morning

[22:02] And just feeling good now to some of you pinball makes you feel good and senior collection makes you feel good

[22:07] But for me personally just feeling good in my own skin

[22:12] Is the most important thing and I hit the gym every morning between six and seven and it is amazing to me

[22:18] Between that hour just six and seven a.m. In the morning the difference that is made in my life when I do that

[22:24] Consistently and I'll say this too

[22:27] So many of you and you know who you are you'll spend an hour surfing pinside every day in the morning in hour

[22:34] Why not cut your two to three or four hours of pinside surfing and dedicate one of those to just taking better

[22:42] Care of yourself and I think you'll be a lot happier. I think you'll be a lot healthier

[22:46] And I think you'll see everything including the silly hobby that we're all involved in in a more positive light

[22:52] All right, I think this show has been I can't like I can't really do a pinside babies anymore because I just don't want to just

[22:58] You know, incessently crap on these dumb topics that mean nothing. I think I'm all excited about Jurassic Park

[23:04] Can't wait to play it. I'm all excited about deep route. I talked a little bit to Robert this week about how they're gonna roll things out

[23:11] I'm all excited about you know seeing the collectors edition of Willy Wonka

[23:16] I'm all excited about guns and roses all these exciting things are happening

[23:20] So it's a good time it's a good time to be in pinball everyone

[23:22] I really just want you guys all to take care of yourselves

[23:25] I'm super happy for all of you who listen to canadus pinball podcasts and I hope I hope one day one day next year

[23:31] We can hold up the third twippy and say hey together. We all did it in my print

[23:36] Am I campaigning too early? Oh, don't forget to donate to canadus patreon page so I can take Brenda out

[23:42] And also it's Brenda's birthday august 15th

[23:44] So any donations that want to go specifically to Brenda's birthday dinner. Oh my god

[23:50] She would be over the moon enthusiastic about that everyone have a good day

[23:54] Hilton stop complaining so much about stupid stuff. You're not a bad guy. That's a thing

[23:58] You kill hilton with hugs. You're not a bad guy

[24:01] You don't need to keep pretending to be this bad guy on pin sight

[24:05] You're actually a really good guy in person and you do a lot of good stuff for the pinball community

[24:11] And we know that about you. I don't know why you need the attention

[24:15] In the negative way. I don't I don't you can get it in the right way
