[00:00] Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.

[00:30] Harry Potter, Pinball, you would think after all of this time we know it's Potter that they would at least let us know the exact date we can expect the reveal of the game.

[00:44] It is Monday, May 12th.

[00:47] Is it gonna be this Friday?

[00:49] Is it gonna be tomorrow?

[00:51] Is it gonna be Thursday?

[00:52] Nobody knows!

[00:53] I have in my phone a tentative invite from the folks over at Jersey Jack to go to Chicago and see the game.

[01:01] That was like a month ago.

[01:04] I haven't heard anything.

[01:06] What's going on people?

[01:08] I just want this game to come out.

[01:11] All the speculation it's all gonna end.

[01:14] Is the game gonna be empty?

[01:16] Is it gonna be loaded?

[01:18] Is it gonna have an upper playfield and a lower playfield?

[01:22] We know there's three levels of play.

[01:25] What does that mean?

[01:26] Is it gonna be speedy?

[01:28] Is it gonna be floaty?

[01:30] Is it gonna have toys and mechs that wow us?

[01:33] Is it gonna have a magnet that grabs the ball?

[01:35] How are they gonna fit?

[01:37] Eight movies, eight people, eight movies into one pinball machine.

[01:45] Are the clips gonna be muted?

[01:47] We are gonna know all of this when this game reveals and this time the expectations are high.

[01:57] There's not gonna be fooling anybody anymore.

[02:01] We now know when we walk up to a Jersey Jack machine if we're seeing magic or if we're seeing cost cutting.

[02:10] We know if they've got all the assets or if they don't.

[02:14] This is it.

[02:16] This is gonna be the moment.

[02:18] I'm so excited now.

[02:20] Historically, Jersey Jack never delivers when the expectations are this high.

[02:26] I mean it.

[02:27] They've never done it.

[02:29] And if the rumor what I'm hearing is true, this is gonna be more like the last four releases.

[02:34] I'm worried.

[02:36] I'm worried that they're not gonna put everything in the kitchen sink into this game.

[02:40] They paid so much money for the license that they might have cut back on the mechanical wow.

[02:46] And I just wanted to come out.

[02:49] I know you're sick of waiting.

[02:51] I know you're sick of hearing Canada being sick of waiting.

[02:55] I know we're all sick of like trying to guess what's gonna be in this game.

[03:00] I hope it's amazing.

[03:01] I really do because I love pinball and you love pinball.

[03:05] And if this game is amazing, it's gonna put everybody in a good mood.

[03:09] It really is.

[03:10] And if this game is amazing, it's gonna hopefully justify the high price.

[03:14] I'm nervous though.

[03:15] I'm nervous because if the $10,000 edition doesn't have anything removed from the $15,000 edition,

[03:24] that makes me so nervous.

[03:26] It makes me nervous that there's nothing to remove.

[03:29] Think about it.

[03:31] If there's nothing to remove in those different versions for $5,000 between the two,

[03:37] then yeah, it makes me nervous that the game isn't gonna be loaded.

[03:42] Heck, even King Kong removed stuff between the pro and the le and the premium.

[03:48] And this game's got a $5,000 difference and nothing removed.

[03:53] What's the artwork gonna be like?

[03:55] Christopher Franchi has raised the bar with Evil Dead artwork.

[03:59] The Dune Machine looks pretty damn good.

[04:01] Who's doing the Harry Potter artwork?

[04:03] Is Miracle gonna make the playfields?

[04:05] Or is Bader gonna make the playfields for the CEs like they did with Avatar?

[04:10] So many questions.

[04:12] So many questions.

[04:14] And hopefully all of them are answered.

[04:16] Now, what I'm hearing is that the dealer and distro call is this week.

[04:21] So I think it's like out there in the world.

[04:23] I think they've already shipped units to Europe.

[04:26] I think there's gonna be a global launch.

[04:29] And I think it's gonna be this week.

[04:31] Or it's not gonna be this week.

[04:33] And you're gonna hear me complaining next Monday about not knowing what day Harry Potter is gonna be released.

[04:39] Alright, so outside of Potter, what's going on in the world?

[04:42] King Kong le's not selling.

[04:44] We know it.

[04:45] You're sick of me making fun of King Kong le.

[04:47] Carrie Hardy's got a bunch of exclusive videos of King Kong le.

[04:52] He's not impressed.

[04:53] Most people are not impressed.

[04:55] King Kong le, like I predicted, will be $10,000 within six months.

[05:00] If not sooner than that.

[05:02] Okay, now we're all thinking about what's next from Stern.

[05:06] Is it gonna be John Borg, Star Wars Episode 1 through 3?

[05:11] What are my thoughts on that?

[05:13] Look, if they make Star Wars Episode 1 through 3, do I think it will be successful?

[05:19] Yes, it will.

[05:20] Star Wars, when you hear that theme song, even if the movies were not the iconic ones we all love, it doesn't matter.

[05:27] Pod racing.

[05:29] We got Darth Maul.

[05:31] We've got Jedis.

[05:32] We've got Obi-Wan.

[05:33] Kenobi, Obi-Wan, Kenobi.

[05:36] How are you saying his name, Kanata?

[05:38] It's gonna do well.

[05:40] That Duel of Fates song.

[05:42] If you have that in a modern pinball experience and you see Darth Maul's lightsaber.

[05:48] Now think about it, people.

[05:50] If Stern's gonna release Spike 3 with a bigger, wider screen that takes up more of the speaker area on the back box,

[05:59] what better theme to put the big screen into it than Star Wars and having Darth Maul's lightsaber sort of ignite across that new big screen?

[06:11] I think it would be perfect.

[06:13] They've eventually got to get Spike 3 out, right?

[06:15] They keep holding back because they know there's a price increase, but Man-O-Man-O-Man, Star Wars would be a good game.

[06:22] Now the other thing I'm hearing, if it's not Star Wars, it might be Suicide Squad.

[06:29] What?

[06:30] If they make Suicide Squad and not Star Wars, game over instantly on that game.

[06:39] You know the one everyone's missing?

[06:41] There's a new Superman movie coming out this summer.

[06:45] It's like the summer of Superman.

[06:48] And what a missed opportunity for nobody to have.

[06:52] Like the Christopher Reeve Superman pinball machine ready to go.

[06:57] Launch it to pay homage, homage, homage to the Superman property.

[07:03] And it would have been gangbusters for anybody that made the original Superman movie.

[07:09] There was a great Christopher Franci treatment about what that pin could look like.

[07:14] And yet, what do we get?

[07:16] A King Kong with no assets.

[07:19] King Kong got nothing on me, got nothing on Canada.

[07:23] Nobody wants King Kong LE.

[07:25] If you have one right now, congratulations.

[07:27] You just lost $3,000 and you joined the Chump Club.

[07:31] You told everybody that $13,000 is chump change or you're just a chump.

[07:37] It's one or the other people who wants to lose money.

[07:41] Not you.

[07:42] That's why you're only spending five bucks on Canada.

[07:44] Well, if you spend more, I really do appreciate it.

[07:47] Thank you for all your great donations, people.

[07:49] I really do appreciate it.

[07:51] I want to welcome back to this show because I heard he just joined again.

[07:54] I saw it.

[07:55] I want to welcome back to Canada's Pinball Podcast, one of my best friends in pinball,

[08:00] who sometimes just has enough of me and then he has to come back.

[08:04] He always comes back though.

[08:05] So welcome back to the party, Mr. Kim Mitchell.

[08:09] Thank you for being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast again.

[08:13] For those of you who don't remember, Kim Mitchell is the great gentleman

[08:17] who I bought my magic girl from years ago and we still laugh about that game today.

[08:23] He also just sold his Ninja Eclipse for $10,000, people.

[08:27] I've seen the pictures.

[08:29] The money was on the table.

[08:31] Great sale by Kim Mitchell.

[08:33] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[08:35] So suicide squad.

[08:36] All right, whatever, whatever.

[08:37] You know, John Borg is next and I think everyone's moved on from Kong already.

[08:42] I don't care what Keith Owen and Tim are planning over the next six months.

[08:46] Nobody cares, guys.

[08:48] You get one chance to make a first impression.

[08:51] I'm not going to get on these rides anymore and wait six to eight months

[08:54] until a game finally gets good.

[08:56] It's over with that kind of mentality.

[08:59] These companies need to give us more finished product.

[09:02] I'm talking to Retro Ralph.

[09:03] He's got King Kong, Ellie and Evil Dead.

[09:06] Which game did he want to talk about?

[09:09] Which game did he say kept bringing him back for more and more?

[09:12] Evil Dead.

[09:13] I'm here to tell you right now as it stands, Evil Dead is the game of the year.

[09:18] And I think it would be voted that by the pinball voting people.

[09:22] I think it would beat Keith Owen and that is amazing.

[09:25] Spooky pinball went from making the worst games in pinball years ago.

[09:30] Well, they weren't the worst, but they were pretty damn bad.

[09:32] To now making a game that has more positive energy around it than a Keith Owen machine.

[09:38] Damn, the Owen army man.

[09:39] They've tried to get at us.

[09:41] Have you noticed the amount of Owen army influencers and content creators trying to force us to celebrate this game?

[09:47] Assetless King Kong.

[09:49] I don't even think that's the Empire State Building.

[09:52] I don't even think Stern licensed the Empire State Building.

[09:56] It looks like a generic skyscraper.

[09:59] That's how cheap they are.

[10:01] They couldn't even get you a Jeep in Jurassic Park.

[10:04] Alright, but speaking of Stern, I've got some news for you guys.

[10:08] After the next John Boer game is gonna be Pokemon.

[10:12] And I heard this about Pokemon.

[10:15] I heard they have full assets to Pokemon.

[10:18] Good, cause it's a damn cartoon.

[10:21] You don't need any live actors.

[10:23] I know people are doing the voices, but yeah, wow, Stern, you locked up the animations of an animated show.

[10:28] Which is good.

[10:29] So I think we're gonna see clips from the Pokemon TV show.

[10:32] Now, raise of hands, all of you out there.

[10:34] How many of you have caught episodes of Pokemon?

[10:38] Zero.

[10:39] None of us.

[10:40] Who the heck in this hobby has watched Pokemon?

[10:43] Have any of you?

[10:44] Nope.

[10:45] So it's funny.

[10:46] They're gonna go get the assets for a property that you've never seen the assets.

[10:51] And then a property that you've seen all the assets, King Kong.

[10:55] They got zero assets.

[10:56] Stern Pimble.

[10:57] Stern Pimble.

[10:58] Great marketing, guys.

[10:59] Alright, so here's what they're gonna do.

[11:00] They're gonna do a thousand LEs of Pokemon.

[11:04] They're gonna do four different LEs.

[11:06] Each will be a run of 250 that will feature a different Pokemon character on the LE.

[11:15] That is really smart and that is fun.

[11:18] But here's what they should do.

[11:19] And I think they might do this.

[11:21] When you order in LE, you don't know what Pokemon character you're going to get.

[11:28] They need to do it like that.

[11:30] So it's like unwrapping or unboxing a pack of Pokemon cards and you don't know which one you're gonna get.

[11:38] That is awesome.

[11:39] And if Stern does it this way, this makes sense.

[11:43] Because then there's only gonna be 250 Pikachu's, 250 Jigglypups.

[11:49] You know, whatever it is, I think it's so much smarter to do it this way because it will create FOMO and also for the diehard.

[11:58] This is nuts to say this.

[11:59] But for the diehard Pokemon fan, they might want to collect all of the LEs.

[12:06] And like I said in my other show, if you buy four Stern LEs, $52,000.

[12:13] But heck, there's Pokemon cards out there where a single card is worth millions of dollars.

[12:19] There are many cards out there that are worth $100,000 for one card.

[12:23] But the reason those cards have value is because there are so many more people who want those cards than can get them.

[12:30] It's not the same with these pinball machines.

[12:32] So, you know, don't expect these Pokemon LEs to go skyrocketing in value.

[12:37] It's not gonna happen.

[12:38] I'm also hearing about Pokemon is they're working with the license holder to have each of these LEs have a special Pokemon card that is only available on the apron of the machine.

[12:52] Now, I think that's a smart marketing move because if you think about it, that's how you're gonna bring in the Pokemon fan base who collect the cards.

[13:01] Imagine if there are just 1000 of a new Pokemon card and the only way to get it is to buy the pinball machine.

[13:09] See, that's good.

[13:11] That's smart.

[13:12] And I think that's the way you cross over the pinball buying demo and the Pokemon card collectors.

[13:18] I'm also hearing that Pokemon, which again, I think is gonna be by Jack Danger is gonna come out in Q1 of 2026.

[13:27] So let's think about this for a minute now how the timeline is shaking out.

[13:32] We just got King Kong and it's May.

[13:34] Let's count four months from now.

[13:36] May, June, July, August, September.

[13:40] So we're looking August, September, most likely September will be the next game from John Borg.

[13:46] Will it be Star Wars Episode 1 through 3?

[13:49] Everybody wants it to be a Tron remastered because a new Tron movie is coming out.

[13:54] I don't think it's gonna be that.

[13:55] Here's what I think is gonna happen.

[13:57] I think they're gonna do Star Wars 1 through 3 and then September, then October, November, I think we're gonna get a remastered walking dead.

[14:07] This is my prediction.

[14:09] John Borg, new game, Star Wars 1 through 3.

[14:12] Then they're gonna bring back a remastered version of the walking dead because remember when they brought out X-Men?

[14:19] They brought out X-Men in August, September and then what did they do?

[14:23] They brought out Metallica remastered right after that to have that game at Chicago Expo.

[14:30] So I fully expect the same timeline and then Stern usually does their next cornerstone sometime in February, March.

[14:39] And I think that's when we're gonna see Pokemon.

[14:41] I saw people say like, well when Harry Potter comes out there's nothing new to look forward to.

[14:45] What are you talking about?

[14:46] There's all this stuff that Stern's gonna do.

[14:48] We got Predator coming out sometime in the summer.

[14:50] We're also gonna get Beetlejuice from freaking Spooky Pinball in December.

[14:56] Evil Dead is sold out.

[14:58] This Dune game is gonna start to get more assets.

[15:01] I think Dune is gonna need to have a second life when they put more into the game.

[15:05] So that's coming.

[15:06] As far as I can tell, like, Padready Gaming is still gonna bring back Toten.

[15:10] We're gonna see these Merlin editions of Medieval Madness hit people pretty soon.

[15:16] And then what's next from Chicago Gaming Company, right?

[15:19] Is it gonna be Halo?

[15:21] There's a lot of stuff happening in the pinball development world.

[15:25] I don't think we're ever gonna go like four months with nothing.

[15:28] I don't think we're gonna go three months with nothing.

[15:30] Heck, I don't think we're gonna go two months with nothing new in the pinball world.

[15:35] There's a lot happening.

[15:37] Now, I don't think there's a lot of sales to be had.

[15:40] I don't think people are gonna be paying these prices unless it's like dream theme done right.

[15:44] But Star Wars will always sell.

[15:47] It will.

[15:48] That theme song, it is like an intoxicating thing to hear as a 40 to 60 year old man.

[15:54] Here's what sucks about Star Wars.

[15:56] There's never been a great Star Wars pinball machine.

[15:59] Never.

[16:00] It's just never been one.

[16:02] And if they make this game great and John Borg nails it, I think everyone's gonna want one.

[16:08] Because there isn't a truly satisfying Star Wars game.

[16:12] Now, you know me.

[16:13] The smart move would be to make a pin for each of the original trilogies.

[16:17] They're not doing that.

[16:19] I don't think anyone wants Skeleton Crew.

[16:21] So hopefully that's not what Stern optioned.

[16:24] If they bring out Skeleton Crew, it's dead on arrival.

[16:28] Mandalorian, was that a great machine?

[16:31] The assets were there, but the gameplay was never that good.

[16:34] That upper play field is horrible.

[16:36] And there's no real using of the force powers.

[16:39] That whole game when I see Mando, it's just a miss.

[16:42] On every level, it's just a miss for me.

[16:44] You know, owners always defend Star Wars games.

[16:46] The amount of times I hear people with the Steve Richie gaming, like, it's a great game.

[16:50] It's a great, every time I stand over one, I just want to fall over backwards and play dead.

[16:55] It's that boring to me as a Star Wars fan.

[16:57] I love Star Wars and that game with that TIE Fighter on a spring.

[17:03] It's too hard to get the ball into the hyperdrive.

[17:06] Everything about it. The artwork is bad.

[17:08] The shots are uninspired.

[17:10] There's no magical mechs in the entire game.

[17:12] You think about the source material, it's just such a miss.

[17:15] And they have all the assets.

[17:17] Think about it. Stern has all the assets for Star Wars.

[17:20] All the syncing up of clips, all the actors, all the voices.

[17:23] And they have zero assets for King Kong.

[17:26] And how much was Star Wars, Ellie?

[17:28] Like $9,000? And now you're going to spend $4,000 more on an asset list, King Kong.

[17:34] Canada, stop! You're ruining the value of all these Kong LEs.

[17:37] Guys, if you have one, just put it up for sale now.

[17:39] Take your $1,000 loss and move on, because it's about to be a $3,000 loss in just a few weeks.

[17:45] Alright, so Monday, after Mother's Day, are we going to see Harry Potter this week?

[17:50] Is John Bore going to do Star Wars 1 through 3 or Suicide Squad?

[17:55] Pokemon, four different versions of the LE.

[17:58] Which one are you going to get? You're not going to know until you unbox the game.

[18:01] I think that's super smart.

[18:03] Look, and I just can't wait to see if Harry Potter is going to bring the magic.

[18:07] That's it, everybody. Have a great Monday.

[18:10] We will be back more this week with the world's self-proclaimed, most entertaining place

[18:15] to spend $5 to save $3,000 every month.

[18:19] It's amazing. You spend $5 and I save you $3,000 by telling you not to buy a Stern LE.

[18:26] That's a great partnership.

[18:28] Kim Mitchell, welcome back. We out.
