[00:00] I'm a one way, love the way I'm a love that drives away

[00:07] Followed you back home

[00:10] Let's ever set aside, set aside, set aside, set aside

[00:15] Alright, welcome to Episode 21 of the Canadian Club

[00:19] Now here's what's interesting, I have 290 club members on Patreon

[00:25] and I can see that each club episode is getting listened to

[00:30] 300 and 90 times.

[00:33] So, which one of you is sharing these club episodes

[00:36] with your friends?

[00:37] If you're sharing the links, please don't,

[00:38] and I'll tell you why, because there are many of you out

[00:41] there who are not doing that.

[00:43] And this is for people who are showing their support

[00:45] for Canadian Pimbal podcast,

[00:46] and those people listening for free, they don't deserve it.

[00:49] They really don't deserve it.

[00:50] So I hope you guys will not share these links.

[00:53] So on this episode, I wanna just come clean.

[00:56] I wanna be transparent.

[00:58] I wanna tell you why I sold my Godzilla Ellie.

[01:02] And the reason why I sold it is this.

[01:04] It's not that I bought this game to flip.

[01:06] If I wanted to buy the game to flip,

[01:08] I would have sold it right away.

[01:10] So why did I sell Godzilla Ellie?

[01:12] The game that is the number one ranked game of all time.

[01:17] Is it, is this the best Pimbal machine

[01:20] that has ever been made?

[01:21] I don't know, maybe.

[01:22] I think it might be too soon to tell.

[01:25] I definitely think the game is amazing.

[01:27] I think Stern Pimbal created a very, very fun game.

[01:31] I think Keith L. Win is a very, very good designer.

[01:33] And I think seeing these kinds of toys and mechs

[01:37] and games is everything that I've been looking for in Pimbal.

[01:41] But I wanna tell you why I took an offer

[01:44] on my Godzilla Ellie.

[01:45] Well, I did put it up for sale,

[01:47] and I wanna tell you the true story

[01:48] of how I sold my Godzilla Ellie.

[01:51] So I've got Godzilla Ellie number 500 new in box,

[01:55] sitting next to my guns and roses number 500.

[01:58] And I've been saying I wanna make a Neo Tokyo arcade

[02:01] in my house.

[02:02] I'm looking at the real estate market every day in my life.

[02:05] Bren and I are trying to figure out where we wanna live.

[02:08] Do we wanna go to the suburbs of New York?

[02:10] Do we wanna maybe go to Ireland

[02:12] and just rent a house there

[02:13] and see if we can get on there?

[02:15] Where do we wanna bring this family?

[02:17] And those are the things that keep me up at night.

[02:19] Not Pimbal, not wizard modes,

[02:21] not if Keith Johnson's gonna figure out

[02:23] how to get the final beta code into Pirates of the Caribbean.

[02:27] I don't really care about those things that much.

[02:29] I love Pimbal and I wanna have Pimbal in my house.

[02:33] But as I've seen this market go through the roof

[02:36] and I see these people spending ridiculous prices, right?

[02:39] People are selling things that I think

[02:41] don't really have that much value.

[02:43] I get that you can take an Indian of Jones

[02:45] and put some mods into it.

[02:47] And then all of a sudden you say

[02:48] it's Oracle Pimbal Company Game One of One.

[02:51] Like what's happening now?

[02:52] We're placing such an overemphasis on things

[02:56] that don't have anything to do with gameplay.

[02:59] Things that have nothing to do

[03:00] with the magic of the machine.

[03:02] And I see this entire hobby starting to overvalue

[03:06] the stuff that doesn't matter that much.

[03:08] What matters in Pimbal is this, how awesome is the game?

[03:11] Are you enjoying it?

[03:13] Is it fun?

[03:13] Are there toys?

[03:15] Is it a theme you love?

[03:16] Is it a dream theme of yours?

[03:18] And I'm starting more and more and more

[03:20] to see these incredibly high prices.

[03:22] And I'm saying to myself, it's a weird hobby lately.

[03:26] We're starting to just over price everything.

[03:29] I mean, legitimately people would pay you

[03:32] three to four thousand dollars today

[03:36] for a Leore mod in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[03:39] And mod that does nothing, it sits on top

[03:43] of that upper left Dauntless pirate ship.

[03:46] And just add some barrels and railing and lights.

[03:49] And people will pay three to four thousand dollars,

[03:53] which is the price of an entire Pimbal machine.

[03:56] I'm seeing people pay these prices.

[03:57] I'm seeing people offer games for high prices

[04:00] and getting it.

[04:01] And so I look at this market right now

[04:03] and I say to myself, Chris, what's more valuable

[04:06] to you in life?

[04:07] Do you value these things or do you value experiences more?

[04:12] And I'm not trying to be some like,

[04:13] woke, Gen Z guy that's like experiences mean more

[04:17] to me than things.

[04:19] But when you live in a one bedroom apartment

[04:22] and you're with your beautiful Irish wife

[04:24] and you're looking at your perfect little baby boy,

[04:27] you realize that all this stuff, all these possessions,

[04:31] they're just transient items, they're fun,

[04:35] but they're not the end of the world.

[04:37] And as I was looking at the market of Pimbal,

[04:39] I said to myself, well right now,

[04:41] I'm staring at my checking account.

[04:43] And I'm looking at the reality of, it's the holidays.

[04:46] And I want to give and I want to give people gifts.

[04:48] And I need to tip my dormant

[04:50] and I want to spoil my wife and child.

[04:52] And I want to go out and eat amazing meals

[04:55] over the next three weeks.

[04:57] And I'm staring at my checking account

[04:58] and I'm saying to myself, all right,

[05:00] that number's not terrible.

[05:01] And then I'm also thinking about the reality of,

[05:04] all right, I don't get a holiday bonus from my job

[05:06] and I'm super burnt out.

[05:08] And now I've got all this money tied up in Pimbal.

[05:11] And I'm looking at 10, 5, tied up in Godzilla.

[05:14] And I'm asking myself, what's the earliest?

[05:17] The earliest, I will be able to ship

[05:20] and set up Godzilla Ellie in my house.

[05:23] And I don't even have a house.

[05:24] I don't even know where I'm gonna be in six months.

[05:26] So I said, it's gonna be at least six months

[05:29] before I'm able to like unbox this Godzilla Ellie.

[05:32] And the market right now is crazy hot.

[05:35] And so what did I do?

[05:36] I said, okay, well maybe I just want to free up this capital

[05:39] for now.

[05:39] And so I saw on Pinside that all these Godzilla's

[05:43] were selling for 16.5 and I said, all right,

[05:46] they're not moving.

[05:47] Like they're sitting there for 16.5.

[05:49] So I list it mine for 15.99.

[05:52] And immediately got two offers, found a nice gentleman

[05:56] and sold it.

[05:57] Bank wire, money done, he gets the pin, I get the money

[06:01] and everybody's happy.

[06:02] He's super happy.

[06:04] He's not complaining.

[06:05] He knows what the prices of this game was new

[06:07] and he knows what he's paying.

[06:09] So he's super happy and I'm super happy.

[06:11] And I got to know this gentleman

[06:13] and he represents a lot of what is happening in Pimball.

[06:17] He's brand new to Pimball.

[06:19] He's been on Pinside for a few months.

[06:21] He went from having one Pimball machine, wait for it,

[06:25] one Pimball machine to having 12 in just a few months, right?

[06:30] And this is it, this is where we're at.

[06:32] These new rich guys that got the Pimball bug.

[06:35] He's never heard of Canada.

[06:37] It was amazing.

[06:38] I had to validate for him who I was

[06:41] and I wasn't a scammer.

[06:42] I'm like, you haven't heard of Canada?

[06:43] You haven't heard of this distributor?

[06:45] You haven't heard of me?

[06:46] I'm like, all right, if you're into Pimball

[06:48] and you haven't heard of Canada,

[06:49] then you are brand new to Pimball

[06:51] because I've been around for five to six years.

[06:53] And especially if you're a collector of Pimball

[06:56] and you're on Pinside.

[06:57] I mean, my name comes up pretty often.

[06:59] This is how easy it is.

[07:02] When you have a game people want in a hot market

[07:06] and I just walked away without doing much work

[07:08] with almost like a 50 to 60% return on my investment.

[07:12] And the other thing is this

[07:14] and I wanna be completely honest with you.

[07:16] I know Godzilla is an amazing Pimball machine

[07:19] and if I get one one day,

[07:21] I will most likely just get a Godzilla premium

[07:24] down the road when I'm ready to put it in my house

[07:27] and I'll tell you why

[07:28] because Godzilla is still and will never be

[07:31] a dream theme for me.

[07:33] And I don't believe anymore

[07:35] and I mean this, I don't believe anymore

[07:38] in buying an Ellie or a CE to keep

[07:42] unless it is a dream theme for me.

[07:45] Now I'm gonna say something controversial

[07:47] in a little bit that might upset some of you

[07:50] and this is me just being me and I wanna be honest.

[07:52] I'd rather you know what's really going on inside my head

[07:56] versus spinning and lying to you

[07:59] and trying to just cajol you into voting for me

[08:03] in the Twippies.

[08:04] And if what I'm about to say later on upsets you,

[08:06] I would happily, happily have you come on the show

[08:09] and let's talk about it, let's debate

[08:11] why you think what I'm doing is so wrong and egregious.

[08:15] So Godzilla's sold $16,000.

[08:19] He's happy, I'm happy.

[08:21] Is anyone else hurt?

[08:22] There's a thousand of these out there.

[08:24] That's the other thing too.

[08:26] I could never really shake the fact

[08:28] that a thousand Stern Ellie's will never feel

[08:31] that special to me.

[08:32] It just never will.

[08:34] There's just so many of them out there

[08:36] that we're gonna see Godzilla Ellie's up for sale forever.

[08:41] Do I think I could get more than 16K

[08:43] for Godzilla like three or four months from now

[08:46] when everyone realizes that they don't want rush

[08:49] and they don't want venom and there's a supply shortage?

[08:52] Absolutely.

[08:53] But as I said before, I don't care

[08:56] because what I value more is peace of mind and experiences

[09:01] and having that extra money in my pocket

[09:04] will create better experiences for me this holiday

[09:08] with Killian and with Brenda and her sisters

[09:11] who are traveling over.

[09:13] And there's just something about that, right?

[09:14] Like I made this money off of a deal I did.

[09:18] I was in the right place at the right time

[09:20] and I got a nice reward for that.

[09:23] That's life, right?

[09:25] That is why we buy stocks.

[09:27] It is why we go to work.

[09:28] It's why we try to get connected and network

[09:31] to make ourselves have better lives.

[09:34] Like that is the whole reason why we do anything

[09:37] when it comes to like work and investing time

[09:40] in something and learning a skill.

[09:42] And I won't say that knowing Pimbal is a skill set.

[09:46] But after all of the years I've been studying as hobby

[09:50] and my show talks about the Pimbal marketplace.

[09:53] Why would I?

[09:54] Why wouldn't I use those hours?

[09:57] I mean thousands of hours of studying this Pimbal marketplace

[10:02] and I can't use my knowledge to make money off of all

[10:06] of that time.

[10:07] And I think that annoys some people

[10:08] and they think it's slimy and scummy.

[10:11] And I really want to address that head on in a minute

[10:13] after I say what I'm about to do.

[10:15] There's a thousand of them.

[10:17] I also think the hype on Godzilla's gonna die down

[10:20] because of one thing.

[10:21] I think a lot of great games are coming down the line.

[10:24] And if you knew what I knew,

[10:26] what's coming down the line in Pimbal is super exciting

[10:30] and I don't think Godzilla's gonna end up being

[10:32] the greatest Pimbal machine ever.

[10:34] I don't and I don't think it's a dream theme for most people.

[10:37] I don't.

[10:38] I think it's a great Keith L and Pinn

[10:40] and Keith L and keeps making great pins.

[10:42] But Keith L and hasn't made a pin

[10:45] that's a dream theme for me and that's okay.

[10:46] It's what I value.

[10:48] A lot of people out there, they value other parts of Pimbal

[10:52] and they value gameplay and code and all this stuff.

[10:54] And that's great.

[10:55] I just happen to put dream theme as the number one reason

[11:00] I would want to own a Pimbal machine.

[11:02] I will happily play every other amazing pin on location.

[11:06] But if it's gonna go in my house

[11:08] and I'm gonna walk by it,

[11:10] I want my Pimbal machines to be based on something

[11:13] I absolutely love.

[11:15] Like love at the bottom of my soul

[11:17] and this is not one of those themes.

[11:20] All right, another thing happened to this week

[11:22] and gonna be completely candid.

[11:23] I bought a Gucci Xbox.

[11:25] I bought a Gucci Xbox for $10,000.

[11:30] And everyone's like, you're nuts.

[11:31] What are you doing?

[11:32] It's the stupidest thing ever.

[11:34] I'm not gonna keep it.

[11:35] I can't afford to buy $10,000 Gucci Xboxes

[11:38] with daycare and Killian and all the things happening

[11:41] in my world like saving for a house.

[11:43] A Gucci Xbox is not for me.

[11:46] A Gucci Xbox for $10,000 is for some crazy rich kid.

[11:52] It's for some rapper or some athlete or some guy

[11:55] that just loves to flex with the dumbest thing ever

[11:58] because I do think it's the dumbest thing ever.

[12:00] Like it's the same Xbox you can get for $500.

[12:04] But I knew that we're living in this weird world

[12:08] in which we're overvaluing everything.

[12:11] And right now is the perfect time to buy something

[12:15] that has this manufactured Fomal.

[12:17] And you think Pimball is bad.

[12:19] Get ready for this.

[12:21] I buy a Gucci Xbox for $10,000.

[12:25] I listed on StockX for like 25, 22.

[12:29] I listed for 21,5 and it sells.

[12:32] I sell Gucci Xbox on StockX 21,5.

[12:37] That's $11,500 more than I paid for it.

[12:41] Now you pay a few fees for StockX.

[12:43] StockX is great.

[12:44] Like you mail them the product, they validate it.

[12:47] And then you get the money once they validate it's real.

[12:50] I don't know who the buyer is.

[12:52] He doesn't know who I am.

[12:53] It's such a better format than eBay.

[12:55] So much better.

[12:57] And so in my account, from that sale

[12:59] will be something around the ballpark of $8,700.

[13:03] So two items that I don't really need.

[13:06] I could flip in this market for an additional close

[13:10] of $14,000 in my pocket.

[13:14] $14,000 in my pocket.

[13:16] That'd be like getting almost a $30,000 raise

[13:19] this holiday season, which I'm not getting.

[13:22] And so I start to look at this stuff

[13:24] and I'm sending them myself.

[13:25] Chris, you're spending all this time doing this podcast.

[13:27] You've had thousands of people listen to this show.

[13:30] In the history of this Pimball podcast,

[13:32] I think I'm almost around like two million total listens,

[13:36] two million total listens to Canadian Pimball podcast.

[13:39] And then when I ask people to donate and contribute,

[13:43] it's like polling teeth to get people

[13:45] to give you $5 a month, $5 a month.

[13:49] So in two innocuous deals, right?

[13:52] Two innocuous deals in which both people are happy.

[13:55] Nobody got hurt.

[13:56] Two innocuous deals, I can make more money

[14:00] than doing this entire podcast for a year.

[14:03] So why would I even do it then, right?

[14:05] Why would I spend all of my time doing it?

[14:08] You know those guys are like,

[14:09] oh, just do it because you love it.

[14:10] Yeah, guess what happens to all those guys

[14:12] who just do it because they love it?

[14:13] They burn out.

[14:15] They all burn out.

[14:16] And then they don't win the Twippy and they all get mad.

[14:18] But no, I do this show for a couple of reasons.

[14:21] And I'm gonna be completely candid.

[14:24] I do love doing the show, but I also stick with it now

[14:28] because of people like you,

[14:30] because of people who subscribe and show their support,

[14:34] because that money I make every month from Patreon,

[14:37] it's not a ton of money, but it does add some experiences

[14:41] to my life.

[14:42] It does help me, you know, do things

[14:45] that I otherwise couldn't do each month.

[14:47] And that's why I'm super thankful

[14:49] for each and every one of you.

[14:51] And when I flip a pinball machine,

[14:52] that extra money helps create experiences for me,

[14:56] my wife, my children, my friends,

[14:58] that all cherish forever.

[15:00] And I know that the thing I won't cherish forever,

[15:03] and I'm gonna be completely honest here.

[15:04] The thing I won't cherish forever is having a pinball machine

[15:08] and just playing it, because that doesn't mean more to me.

[15:12] Them the connections and the experiences I can create

[15:16] by making money off of pinball.

[15:19] Now, the best thing in life is creating balance.

[15:22] See, balance is the key.

[15:23] I still wanna own pinball machines.

[15:25] I still wanna have pinball machines,

[15:28] but I still only wanna buy machines

[15:31] that are dream themes and put a world under glass.

[15:34] I still can't help but laugh a little bit.

[15:37] That we're saying Godzilla is the number one game of all time,

[15:41] right?

[15:42] Godzilla, the greatest game of all time, right?

[15:44] Godzilla, this huge monster that steps on buildings

[15:49] and crushes tanks and breathes like a plasma ray

[15:53] from his mouth.

[15:54] This amazing creature that moves and destroys societies, right?

[15:59] This amazing creature that does all this stuff,

[16:01] we're saying the number one pinball machine of all time

[16:05] is based on Godzilla.

[16:06] And in the game itself, Godzilla doesn't even move.

[16:11] You've got a Godzilla figure in the game.

[16:14] He doesn't move.

[16:15] He doesn't light up.

[16:17] He doesn't step on anything.

[16:19] His mouth doesn't open up.

[16:20] He doesn't roar.

[16:22] And this is why, at the end of the day,

[16:25] I look at all of these modern stirons

[16:27] and I'm like, yeah, they're great for being stirons,

[16:31] but they're not taking anything to a level of creativity

[16:35] or imagination and you know it.

[16:38] You all know it deep down inside.

[16:40] They're colorful.

[16:41] The code is awesome and they're super fun.

[16:43] Look, don't get me wrong.

[16:45] These are super fun games, but when you really step back

[16:49] and you just look at me like, really?

[16:51] Like, Godzilla doesn't do anything.

[16:53] You step back from Mandalorian.

[16:55] Really, there's no force powers anywhere in this.

[16:58] Really?

[16:59] Like, game of thrones, you don't even like,

[17:01] bash a dragon, like really, like all these things.

[17:04] You look at these games and it's like amazing to me.

[17:07] How forgiving we are at the lack of creativity.

[17:11] And I'm not saying that Godzilla has a lack of creativity.

[17:14] I mean, I want to go back to this

[17:15] because people are going to like,

[17:16] like, grenade or just said, no,

[17:18] but it's just that you build a game around

[17:21] a central creature and you don't have the creature move.

[17:24] Like, everything else happening in Godzilla is really cool.

[17:26] All I would have liked to have seen

[17:28] and again, Stern could have done this

[17:29] if they just put more into it.

[17:31] You're telling me Stern could not have had.

[17:34] Godzilla's mouth open up and a blue beam shoot out of it

[17:38] and hit the bridge and that's what destroys the bridge.

[17:41] Right?

[17:42] That's easily possible.

[17:44] But that's the thing with Stern Pimball is they always,

[17:47] they always, they always stop, you know, at the 10 yard line.

[17:51] They never take a Pimball machine all the way into the end zone.

[17:55] It's because they value profit over creativity.

[17:59] They just do.

[18:00] It's how they run their business.

[18:01] And I'm not one to say I know how to run it better

[18:04] because you could be like Jersey Jack

[18:06] and put creativity over profit and then go bankrupt three times

[18:10] and then need to be bailed out and then lose your company.

[18:12] Like Jack lost his company.

[18:14] Here's the controversial part.

[18:15] Right?

[18:16] So over the years, you know, sometimes I've bought machines

[18:19] and flipped them.

[18:19] Every machine I flipped back in the day,

[18:21] if I had kept it new in box, I would have made way more,

[18:23] but that's besides the point, right?

[18:25] Here's the thing, moving forward.

[18:26] I want to tell you right now

[18:27] because I want to just be completely transparent.

[18:29] And if you don't want to vote for me

[18:31] or you think it's slimy, it's on you

[18:33] and you can unsubscribe to Kineha Dispimball Podcast.

[18:36] I am every once in a while.

[18:38] If I see a pin that I think is going to have

[18:41] a huge market for it, even though I might not want it,

[18:45] I'm going to buy it and I'm going to flip it

[18:48] and I'm going to take the knowledge I know

[18:51] and I'm going to use the relationships I have built

[18:54] over this five or six year period of time

[18:56] and I'm going to use it to put a little extra money

[18:58] in my pocket.

[18:59] And every time I've done this, I'll tell you,

[19:02] the buyer isn't unhappy.

[19:04] I'm not unhappy.

[19:06] The distributors are not unhappy.

[19:07] The only people that are unhappy

[19:10] are the people on the sidelines who are saying,

[19:12] I couldn't get one because Kineha got one.

[19:15] Oh really, you couldn't get the pinball machine,

[19:17] you couldn't get a premium that does everything the Ellie does,

[19:20] right?

[19:21] We don't live in a world in which that experience

[19:23] is not being robbed from you.

[19:25] Why should I have to sacrifice my ability?

[19:27] Because again, I've put myself in this position

[19:30] to have this advantage, right?

[19:32] And I do have a little bit of an advantage.

[19:33] I've done podcasts for six years.

[19:35] I've built relationships with all these people

[19:37] in the industry, all of what I've done

[19:39] for everyone in this community.

[19:41] Why shouldn't I be able to have some advantageous ability

[19:45] to make some money for myself?

[19:47] Because I'm not making that much on this podcast.

[19:49] If you saw what people make on Twitch

[19:51] and other content creators,

[19:53] it's a joke for all the amount of entertainment I've been providing.

[19:56] So I don't feel bad.

[19:58] Let's say for example, I buy a rush Ellie

[20:01] and rush Ellie sell out and I don't like rush,

[20:04] but I've got one.

[20:05] You know, I'm on the list to get every new Ellie

[20:07] and I get one and I sell it for 12.5.

[20:10] I make $2,000, some big rush fan you missed out,

[20:13] gets it and he's happy.

[20:15] Nobody's unhappy, but the people who feel they missed out.

[20:18] Should I go through life feeling like I keep stealing

[20:21] someone's pinball spot?

[20:23] Can you imagine?

[20:25] Can you imagine who would feel empathy for you?

[20:27] Like who could you find in this world

[20:29] in which there are starving children

[20:32] in which people don't even have electricity

[20:34] and which the average median income in the world

[20:37] is like $8,000.

[20:39] That we should feel bad because some wealthy guy

[20:44] missed out on getting his Ellie pinball machine

[20:47] because Canada bought one to sell to somebody else, right?

[20:51] One wealthy guy missed out and another wealthy guy got it

[20:55] and one wealthy guy is feeling bad.

[20:58] And I think the people that are the most upset, right?

[21:00] We need to stop with the excuse of like,

[21:03] we need to expand pinball and you're not expanding pinball,

[21:05] you're ruining pinball by doing it.

[21:07] It's not ruining pinball.

[21:09] So I'm just here to tell you right now

[21:11] that in the future, I'm still gonna do this stuff

[21:13] and I don't think it's wrong.

[21:15] And if I see you doing it, I don't think it's wrong.

[21:17] I really don't.

[21:18] Would I pay over for something?

[21:20] Maybe, you know, maybe.

[21:22] When I bought my Honda Civic Type R, right?

[21:24] My Honda Civic Type R, I had to pay $5,000

[21:28] over the sticker price to get it

[21:31] because that was the market value

[21:33] and no dealership would sell to me at sticker.

[21:36] When I bought my Dodge Demon, I got lucky

[21:39] and got it for sticker price.

[21:40] It was like $86,000.

[21:41] A lot of people paid over,

[21:42] but that's just the way the world works.

[21:45] And the people who know the dealerships,

[21:47] they might be able to get it at sticker.

[21:50] I know the dealerships.

[21:52] And I know there's a lot of new money in this hobby

[21:54] that's very cranky that they don't know the dealers yet.

[21:58] And their money will never, I mean this,

[22:01] their money will never be more valuable to those dealers

[22:06] than the friendships and relationships I've built with them.

[22:10] So I just wanna know from you guys,

[22:11] do you think that's wrong?

[22:13] After all these years and all the value

[22:15] I've put into this community

[22:16] that I can profit off of it somehow?

[22:19] I don't think it's wrong.

[22:20] I don't think it's wrong.

[22:21] And so I would love to hear from you,

[22:23] canate at pinballatgmail.com.

[22:25] And I can't wait to people say, he did it again.

[22:27] He did it again.

[22:28] When Pinside hears I sold my Godzilla,

[22:30] they're gonna act like this is a proof that I'm a bad guy.

[22:35] Like I'm an evil man because I rob some rich man

[22:38] of his unnecessary toy.

[22:40] I think that argument is lame.

[22:42] I think it doesn't hold water.

[22:44] Here's what the smart people do.

[22:46] A lot of the smart guys, they come to me and they say,

[22:48] hey look, I'm not on a list for an Ellie.

[22:51] I will pay over and will you hook me up

[22:54] when you get the next Ellie?

[22:55] I mean, that's what a smart person does.

[22:57] He finds his way in to getting access

[23:00] and I'll give people better prices, man.

[23:02] Like I'm not here to list the pirates of the Caribbean CE

[23:05] for like 36,000 like my boy Derek.

[23:07] I'm not here to like rip anybody off.

[23:09] Every time I've sold a game,

[23:11] I've sold it at the market value.

[23:13] I'm not trying to sell pirates of the Caribbean CE

[23:15] at 36,000 or Ghostbusters at 21,000.

[23:19] I'm not.

[23:20] I'm just here to put a few more bucks in my pocket

[23:22] and to put a lot more memories into my memory book.

[23:26] And I love Pinball and I can't wait to own dream themes,

[23:30] but I'm patiently waiting for themes that are dreams of mine.

[23:34] And there's stuff coming down the pipeline

[23:36] that I can't wait to own.

[23:38] And as great as Godzilla Ellie is

[23:40] and it is an amazing Pinball machine.

[23:43] It's just not a dream theme of mine.

[23:45] And I'll be able to play it in so many places,

[23:48] a thousand of them.

[23:49] It's not going to be hard to play.

[23:50] Plus, plus ultimately,

[23:53] maybe you just learn to love premiums

[23:55] and you don't care anymore about Ellie's

[23:57] and then you never have to pay over again for anything.
