[00:00] What about now? How about tonight? Baby, for once, let's don't think twice. Let's take that spin that never ends that we've been talking about.

[00:15] Oh, these pinball moments we've been talking about. Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast. Happy Monday. It is a muggy sunny day here in Connecticut. And it's a crazy weekend. I took Killian to see his first movie. We saw Lion King in the theater. Come out of the theater just to find out that there was an assassination attempt on ex-president Trump, absolute bonkers world we live in.

[00:44] Just make sure you hug your loved ones and you kiss your kids goodnight because it's just a crazy world. I had like a seamless grub hub guy comes to my house, goes to the neighbor's driveway instead, drives through the hedges, and I just try to tell the guy, hey man, can you watch like how you turn into the driveway? You're in the wrong driveway and you're plowing your car through the hedges, and the guy jumps out of his vehicle and tries to fight me in my neighbor's driveway.

[01:14] This is the world we live in. Everyone is so easily triggered. It's why I always go back to pinball. At least we can have a civil discourse about what's going on in the pinball world. What about now?

[01:29] I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast all the rumored titles that are in the mix and what we're waiting for. So we know that it's no longer a rumor that Stern is going to do the black and white edition of Godzilla.

[01:44] We're going to see this game in just a couple weeks and George Gomez told me they're going to be making this game for years, so there really is no FOMO to grab this game right now. But it basically is code complete and if you want one of the greatest pinball machines ever made, you can have it brand new.

[02:03] I think the main question around Godzilla 60th and all these like Stern machines right now is just the quality. The machines coming out of the new factory have not been the best quality machines. So we will see like Elvira, maybe that game has just always been plagued with like quality issues.

[02:23] So I think it's going to be a better build on Godzilla. So we've got that game. And then I'm hearing the next cornerstone game from Stern pinball is going to be Jack Danger on X-Men 97. When might we see that game? If you think about the way the cornerstones work, we are going to see Jack Danger's game sometime in like September.

[02:45] So that's going to happen. And then we're going to see, I think the spike three system rolled out at the end of the year with the Metallica game. And then after that, you know, I think we're going to see from Stern pinball. I think we're going to see Keith Elwin's King Kong.

[03:00] But the other game I hear that is happening over at Stern, and we really don't talk about it much because there's really not a lot of excitement for this theme. I am hearing that Brian Eddie is working with Dwight Sullivan on Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:17] Now that makes complete sense because Dwight codes every game like he's coding Dungeons and Dragons. And it's like this really overly complex multiplier kind of game. And if there ever was a theme in which you want to get a lot of multipliers and roll the dice through the journey of the game itself, it would be Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:40] Now that starts to paint a little bit of an interesting sort of picture over at Stern pinball X-Men 97. We've had a lot of X-Men games over at Stern pinball and Marvel games in general. And I don't know, it's a phenomenal show. It's absolutely incredible.

[04:00] And if they make it a pinball machine, I think we're going to have to see more of that magnetic, magneto magic go into the game like the old X-Men game Stern made. But it really needs to be full of toys and a real world under glass.

[04:14] And that's what I'm looking for with these Stern machines. I don't want games that are empty and let's face it people. Foo Fighters is pretty empty. I mean, it shoots well, but there's not much in it mechanically. Jaws has a lot more in it, but the way it's executed, it still feels kind of empty.

[04:31] I think we're all waiting for the next Stern machine that feels as loaded as Godzilla was, that feels as creative as Godzilla was. I mean, when you look at John Wick, every time I look at the game, I have absolutely zero interest in playing this John Wick pinball machine.

[04:48] It feels like the game almost never came out. And I think it's because when you look down at it, it really is very uninspired from a creative level. And for those Stern army fanboys that want to keep saying, but the game shoots fast and it's fun, nobody cares anymore about that sort of accolade in a game because it needs to do more than that.

[05:12] For this much money, we need to see magic, world under glass, real creativity with the engineering.

[05:18] Alright, so we've got X-Men 97. Keith Elwyn's King Kong will be an absolute juggernaut of a hit. And I think a lot of us out there are excited that Elwyn is the new king of the monsters over at Stern.

[05:31] I think Dungeons & Dragons, I don't care what they do, it's gonna flop. Like it's just not a theme that people want. I get it, but how many of you raise of hands have been thinking about Dungeons & Dragons into your 40s, into your 50s, into your 60s?

[05:50] It just doesn't carry through. And there's a lot of really good nostalgic themes that people can make and D&D is just not one of them. And what's really interesting as we think about Stern, they can't become a company that has like a hit and then a miss.

[06:07] With this big factory and all those people that need to be on the line, they need every game to be somewhat really, really good. You know, cause they can't just keep remaking the old stuff if they have a flop. I mean, they could do that. But if they do that, everybody knows the outcome of that.

[06:22] Will be Stern oversaturating the whole market and all of it's gonna collapse even faster than it already has really over the last couple of years. I mean, the market is very soft.

[06:32] So those are the rumors over at Stern. The one game I don't know about is John Borg's next original game. We keep talking about Metallica being remade as the first Spike 3 game, but John Borg made that game like a decade ago or more.

[06:50] So what is he working on? We know he was working on an Indiana Jones that got shelved. I have not heard what Borg's next title is. I have heard some rumors in the rumor mill that Jersey Jack pinball has been maybe soft selling John Borg on coming over there.

[07:11] It makes sense in a lot of ways, but then it also doesn't make sense because JJP doesn't need more designers. I think all of these companies right now, I gotta be honest, I think they all have way too many designers.

[07:21] The only company I would love to see announced they're hiring some of these like designers who know what they're really doing is Spooky Pinball. Is maybe barrels of fun. That's the thing. It's like Jersey Jack and Stern have a plethora of highly talented designers.

[07:37] The problem is they've got too many. You only really need face of people. You really only need from a design standpoint. You really only need two designers at most to keep your pinball company going at a large volume because the bigger teams you need are the software teams.

[07:55] Because look, let's face it, Keith Elwin, Jack Danger, Eric Minier, Steve Ritchie, these guys could design more than one game a year. You know, because they're just designing it. Then it's on to the engineers to make it a reality.

[08:09] It's on to the software team to make it work, but they could design in their sleep these guys. It doesn't take them an entire year to design one game. Absolutely not.

[08:19] And so I think it's interesting, right? When you've got like four designers over at a company like Jersey Jack Pinball and they only make like one game a year. Like what's everybody else doing? Like the rotation takes forever.

[08:32] I know over at Stern Pinball, they would probably want two Keith Elwin games a year because that's where the sales are. I mean, think about it. Like they kick a game to Elliot Iceman and it tanks. So they're never going to do that again.

[08:45] Like why would they even bother when they've got better designers in-house? So if we go over to Jersey Jack, the rumors on Mark Sidon's game. I mean, you know, we've been talking about Avatar. I think a lot of people, I put up a poll.

[08:57] Over 90% of people hope it's not Avatar. And if it is Avatar, I'm real, I feel bad for Jersey Jack because it's like clearly the people don't want this. If you put up a poll and say, do you want this theme?

[09:11] It should be the other way around. 90% of people should be saying yes. And it's not that hard to pick a theme that 90% of people age 40 to 60 really want to see in Pinball. And you're going to pick one that 90% say no on.

[09:27] That's bad market research. And so we're seeing maybe Avatar, maybe Muppets, but neither of those is like take my money now for most of you. And I haven't heard like a mystery theme that nobody's been talking about.

[09:42] Every theme I hear for Jersey Jack's next game, we've all heard before. And then after that is The Juggernaut. After that is Harry Potter by Eric Minier. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine.

[09:56] And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine. And then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's next Pinball machine.

[10:26] At these prices, and it doesn't take off immediately, like, they haven't had game, in three straight launches, that have launched, right, I mean, all three of their game, Toy Story four, the Godfather, and Elton, John, they were all, sort of, dead, on arrival, right, there, was, always, like, this, eh, you know, like, deals, could be had, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game, game,

[10:56] Not like Jersey Jack.

[10:57] And so I'm hoping that this next game from Jersey Jack

[11:00] gets people at least excited.

[11:03] Doesn't have us all just sort of shoulder shrugging our way

[11:06] through their next game.

[11:07] So the question now becomes when are we gonna see it?

[11:10] Like it is July.

[11:11] And Elton John has been out now for like eight, nine months.

[11:15] And so I think we're gonna see this next game

[11:17] from Jersey Jack pinball in September.

[11:19] I think it's gonna get interesting

[11:20] because I think in September we're gonna see

[11:22] a new game from Stern

[11:23] and we're gonna see a new game from Jersey Jack.

[11:26] And that is gonna be enough.

[11:27] I mean, think about it.

[11:28] If you're everybody else

[11:30] and you got to sell more games by the end of the year,

[11:32] when you have Stern and Jersey Jack

[11:34] on top of each other, releasing new titles,

[11:37] that's thousands of games

[11:40] that are going to be manufactured

[11:42] sometime between September and like December.

[11:45] So if you wanna release a game in that time period,

[11:49] if you're anybody else, if you're Dutch pinball ex,

[11:52] if you're spooky, if you're barrels of fun,

[11:55] it doesn't matter who you are.

[11:56] And then all these people are gonna get asked

[11:59] to pay for their Pulp Fiction LEs

[12:01] at exactly the same time.

[12:03] I don't know people, do all of you have like just $30,000

[12:07] lying around to pay for all these games?

[12:10] And heck, it's more than that.

[12:12] If you're gonna buy, this is crazy,

[12:13] if you're gonna buy the next CE from Jersey Jack,

[12:16] the next Stern LE just there alone,

[12:19] you're at $28,000.

[12:22] And then if you have to pay for your Pulp Fiction LE,

[12:24] you're basically at $38,000

[12:28] for just three pinball machines.

[12:31] I know people don't want us to do this math

[12:33] because don't you remember

[12:35] when just a few years ago,

[12:37] three of the top of the line games was like 25,000 at most,

[12:43] now we're at $38,000?

[12:46] Hello, inflation, hello, election year,

[12:49] hello, I think people are gonna vote with their wallets

[12:52] and not with their conscious,

[12:54] I think that's just the way it's gonna go.

[12:57] We gotta get stuff back to normal.

[12:59] And I'm also looking to see how everything happens

[13:02] in pinball because as the secondhand market

[13:04] continues to slide back down to a pre-COVID state,

[13:08] are any of these pinball companies

[13:10] gonna make a price adjustment?

[13:11] I mean, that's gonna be a thing, man.

[13:12] Someone's gonna have to do it.

[13:14] There's no way it's gonna survive like this.

[13:16] There's just no way.

[13:17] Someone's gonna have to be like,

[13:19] look, we're gonna roll prices back down a little bit,

[13:21] like a 20% reduction in cost.

[13:24] We got Jersey Jack, we got Stern,

[13:26] multi-morphics gonna start making

[13:28] their Princess Bride games this summer at some point.

[13:31] So I don't think anything new from multi-morphic this year,

[13:34] I think they gotta make those games.

[13:36] American Pinball has got nothing other than Cuphead.

[13:40] I just saw a picture of them posing

[13:42] in front of Jersey Jack games.

[13:45] I mean, if you really could give out an award

[13:48] for the worst marketing ever,

[13:50] it is to a company that every time

[13:52] they seem to be celebrating pinball,

[13:54] they're doing it in front of other company games.

[13:56] And I don't know, like Cuphead is gonna come out,

[13:59] it's gonna bomb, and I don't think there's really

[14:02] a future here until they make a leadership change.

[14:05] That's all I'm gonna say on American Pinball.

[14:08] What else is going on?

[14:08] Spooky Pinball is really one we're all gonna be

[14:11] watching this year because we know

[14:13] that they're getting ready for their next new game

[14:15] by the end of the year.

[14:17] We also know because they hit me up and told me so,

[14:21] it's not gonna be Beetlejuice.

[14:23] Now, I think that's a miss because if they have

[14:25] the Beetlejuice license and the movie is about to come out,

[14:29] why wouldn't you release Beetlejuice in the very year

[14:34] where the sequel to this iconic movie is coming out?

[14:37] You would have made it into all of those media stories

[14:41] about the return of Beetlejuice,

[14:43] speaking about the new movie,

[14:45] a brand new pinball machine has just dropped as well.

[14:49] What a missed opportunity if I had a dollar.

[14:52] For every time these pinball companies cannot sync up,

[14:55] the damn game with what's going on

[14:58] with the property in culture, I'd be a very wealthy man.

[15:02] They always get it wrong, they always get it wrong.

[15:05] So then what is it gonna be from Spooky Pinball?

[15:08] The rumors we know are evil dead.

[15:10] We've got Goonies, we've got Sonic the Hedgehog,

[15:14] we've got Beetlejuice, all I know is there's a lot

[15:18] of excitement over there at Spooky.

[15:21] Every time Luke pops into my Facebook Live,

[15:24] he's like, I think you're gonna be very excited,

[15:26] Kaneda, when you see our next game and I hope so.

[15:30] And I think out of all the companies out there,

[15:32] I mean this, out of all the companies out there,

[15:35] they've just kind of been getting it done.

[15:37] I mean, it's really hard to be upset and angry

[15:41] with anything Spooky does.

[15:43] They don't rip anybody off, they make their games

[15:47] in numerical order, they've arguably made every game

[15:51] better than the previous game, and they keep getting better.

[15:55] They've also gotten very expensive.

[15:58] I would argue that I'm not necessarily sure I see the value

[16:02] in a $12,000 Spooky game with a butter cabinet,

[16:06] and I still think they need a lot more toys in their games

[16:09] that are uniquely engineered.

[16:11] Stuff still feels a little bit off the shelf,

[16:14] and I also don't like this whole crowd sourcing

[16:17] way to code a game, where a game comes out

[16:20] and it's like nine months for them to polish the game,

[16:23] and I think next time's gonna be easier.

[16:25] I think what's happened over the last few releases

[16:27] from Spooky, because they've got these dual games,

[16:30] Halloween and Ultraman, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre

[16:34] and Looney Tunes, they've gotta split up their software

[16:37] people to make both games, and if they just focus

[16:40] on one game, I think you're gonna see code updates

[16:43] a lot more frequently, and I think you're gonna see

[16:46] a game ship on day one with a lot more code in it.

[16:50] So that's also gonna happen at the end of the year,

[16:52] and you know me, like Spooky, Stern, and Jersey Jack.

[16:56] What else do you need?

[16:57] Is anyone else gonna do anything that makes a pop?

[16:59] I'm looking at you right now, barrels of fun.

[17:02] I mean, orders on labyrinth are done.

[17:05] You're not gonna get more orders,

[17:07] and I think they need to just say,

[17:08] we're only gonna make 800, and I think they need

[17:11] to start getting ready for game number two.

[17:14] Now, I think game number two is gonna take place

[17:18] probably around March.

[17:19] I think they're gonna wanna have that game ready

[17:22] for Texas Pinball Festival.

[17:24] I don't think we're gonna see much before then.

[17:26] I don't know if they're gonna do another teaser campaign,

[17:29] but I doubt it, and I hope the next title,

[17:32] and I've heard from people over there,

[17:33] they're like, Chris, you're gonna like the next thing

[17:35] we come out with, so I think they're gonna make something

[17:39] that appeals to someone who's had sexual relations

[17:42] in the last 30 years, and that's a good thing.

[17:45] I really do think that's a good thing,

[17:47] and I look forward to the next title.

[17:49] As far as what it is, all the rumors are not gonna happen.

[17:53] I think there was a rumor about Goonies.

[17:55] I think there was a rumor about Fifth Element.

[17:58] I don't know, I really don't know,

[18:01] but what I can put my finger on is I do think

[18:04] it's gonna be a nostalgic theme from the 1980s.

[18:09] I think they're gonna continue fishing where the fish are,

[18:13] and I think if they make something nostalgic

[18:15] and they do it right and they put a few more toys

[18:17] into the game, because I'm not fooled by them.

[18:19] I see a lot of sculpts and little figures popping up

[18:23] like Pez dispensers, but that's not a toy,

[18:26] so I wanna see these guys actually engineer more.

[18:30] I don't wanna see a game filled with sculpts

[18:32] because that's also, yes, technically it looks

[18:35] like a world under glass, but it's more of a diorama

[18:39] than a pinball machine, so I hope we see more

[18:42] mechanical magic in their next game,

[18:44] and they're gonna have to bring it,

[18:46] because as I was just saying, look at all this stuff

[18:48] coming out, you either bring the heat, you bring the magic,

[18:52] or you're not gonna get more than like five, 600 units sold

[18:56] because everyone's out of space,

[18:58] and almost everybody's out of money

[19:00] unless you're Bill Brandis and Ed Robertson,

[19:03] we're all going broke, we're all going broke here

[19:05] buying all these games, losing all this money.

[19:07] All right, so that's what's next from Barrels of Fun.

[19:10] I think something nostalgic, I think we're gonna see it

[19:12] sometime around Texas Pinball Festival 2025.

[19:16] All right, let's go over to Dutch Pinball,

[19:18] back to the future, delayed, not happening this year.

[19:20] All right, I know it was supposed to come out this year,

[19:22] it's not, so now we've got DPX,

[19:25] I gotta talk to Melvin, they're gonna come out

[19:27] with this Alice in Wonderland, that's happening,

[19:29] and that's gonna happen right on top of the next from Stern,

[19:34] the next from Jersey Jack, the next from maybe

[19:37] American Pinball, the next from Spooky,

[19:40] it's all gonna happen at once.

[19:42] So basically Q3, Q4 is gonna be a period

[19:46] in which we're gonna get inundated

[19:48] with the next wave of games, and I'm curious,

[19:51] because this has never been done before,

[19:53] you take a game that's been designed by John Papadook,

[19:57] you take the artwork that's been designed by Zambietti,

[20:01] you then make the game where J-pop doesn't finish the design,

[20:05] and you make the game where Zambietti

[20:07] doesn't finish the artwork, but it's still that game,

[20:11] all inspired by that foam core edition from Zidware.

[20:14] I don't know how this is gonna do,

[20:16] this is uncharted territory, we've seen what's happened

[20:19] before, when a pinball company has tried to sort of

[20:23] go back to the J-pop well, and they haven't had much success,

[20:28] but there's a huge butt and caveat,

[20:30] that was deep root pinball, the biggest joke

[20:33] in the history of pinball companies,

[20:35] and nobody had any confidence in Robert Mueller's ability

[20:39] to make those games and bring them to market,

[20:42] but none of us are worried now about Dutch.

[20:45] Are you, do you really worry that Dutch pinball

[20:48] can make a game?

[20:49] They've been doing it, and they've been doing it

[20:51] with Lebowski, and that is why I think

[20:53] there's a lot more confidence.

[20:55] So, how will this Alice's adventure in Wonderland do?

[21:00] I don't know, I don't know how they could even test

[21:04] the market on this game, I think we're all gonna be

[21:07] spectators when they roll this game out,

[21:10] and we will see, it's gonna be an interesting test to see,

[21:14] are there enough people, 500 of them they need,

[21:18] because if this game comes out,

[21:19] and it doesn't sell out almost instantly,

[21:23] then you know how much the pinball market has changed,

[21:28] and I don't think they know, I mean,

[21:30] how do you sit in a boardroom if you're Melvin and Barry,

[21:34] and how do you say we're gonna make this many at this price?

[21:38] Like, what do you even point at as a comparable

[21:42] to the thing you're about to do?

[21:44] There's nothing, there's absolutely nothing,

[21:46] and in a space like that, in an uncharted territory

[21:50] like that, I think you always aim

[21:53] a little bit more conservative.

[21:55] I wouldn't have made 500, I would have made it more

[21:58] like 200 to 250, because the games I'd be looking at

[22:02] as like what, the only ones that are worth collecting now

[22:06] is a 200 edition of Pirate CE,

[22:09] an 80 version edition of Batman,

[22:12] and I get that there's like other versions of the game,

[22:15] but man, 500 Alice's at like 14K a pop,

[22:20] it sounds like a lot, so we're gonna see.

[22:23] So I would have done just 200 to 250,

[22:26] I would have kept it much more limited,

[22:29] and I would have gauged the market,

[22:30] and hey, I might be wrong here,

[22:31] they might sell out all 500 instantly,

[22:34] there might just be enough people in Europe

[22:36] to absorb these games, I think the one thing

[22:38] they're underestimating is how reluctant people are

[22:43] in this hobby to truly support anything

[22:46] that came from John Papadook Jr.

[22:49] And I think there is such a thing as karma,

[22:52] and I think there is such a thing as like

[22:53] all those people that got burned,

[22:55] they were not made whole.

[22:57] If you think all those people that J-pop burned

[23:00] were made whole, you're wrong,

[23:02] and the thing they'll never get back,

[23:04] it's not just the money, where he burned people

[23:07] was their time, and their effort,

[23:09] and time is something you can never get back.

[23:12] And you can see it in the way Zambietti responds

[23:15] to this thing coming back again.

[23:17] It's like, can't this just die?

[23:19] Like why can't this just go away?

[23:22] This guy's creations should never live to see another day.

[23:27] And the other thing too is like,

[23:28] they didn't just register this Alice game,

[23:31] they went and got like Magic Girl and Raza.

[23:34] So I'm curious when I talk to Melvin

[23:37] what this is all about.

[23:39] Other than these things, which is already enough,

[23:42] I haven't even mentioned like half

[23:43] of the other boutique companies,

[23:45] Pinball Brothers and ABBA, that's not gonna sell.

[23:48] Do they have something after that

[23:50] that's gonna come out this year?

[23:52] Then we've got this Funhouse remake from Padredy Gaming.

[23:55] I don't think that's gonna sell.

[23:57] I think Haggis is done, you know how I feel about that.

[24:00] And this Centaur, those are never gonna get made.

[24:03] We've got Turner Pinball, we've got Pinball Adventures.

[24:07] It's just stupid, like right, it's like,

[24:08] it's even hard for me after I just cover

[24:11] like all of these legitimate companies.

[24:13] And when they're all making games,

[24:15] it's way too many games already.

[24:18] And then we've got all these other companies.

[24:20] So everybody, trust me,

[24:22] wait, wait, wait and get in shape, shape, shape.

[24:25] What I haven't heard from any of you,

[24:27] I haven't heard anybody email me and said,

[24:29] Chris, I'm gonna take you up on the six month challenge.

[24:32] I am not going to buy a game.

[24:35] I'm gonna spend the next six months getting into shape.

[24:39] Can you email me if you're gonna do this?

[24:41] I wanna give you a shout out.

[24:43] And I wanna create a list of people

[24:46] amongst the Canadians that are gonna do this challenge.

[24:49] And I would love it six months from now

[24:52] to have before and after photos of all of you.

[24:56] And then we can all look better

[24:58] as we march into these Pinball shows in Q4

[25:01] and then buy whatever we want

[25:03] because everything's lost value.

[25:04] Here's a good thing.

[25:05] The games will lose value and you will lose weight.

[25:09] Those are the two greatest things

[25:11] that could have losses in 2024.

[25:14] What I don't wanna see is you gain weight

[25:18] and then you buy these new games and they lose value.

[25:21] Cause that's what I'm seeing happen in the space.

[25:24] Everybody happy Monday.

[25:25] We're gonna have a lot to talk about

[25:27] in the months coming up.

[25:28] A little bit of a low period right now,

[25:30] but I'm here and we're gonna make it entertaining

[25:32] every single week.

[25:33] Canada out.

[25:34] Let's take that spin that never ends

[25:37] that we've been talking about.

[25:41] What about now?

[25:43] Why should we wait?

[25:45] We can chase these dreams down the interstate

[25:49] and be long gone before the world moves on

[25:53] and makes another round.

[25:56] What about now?

[26:00] Yeah.

[26:04] What about now?
