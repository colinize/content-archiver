[00:00] Welcome to episode 216 ofCanada's

[00:03] Welcome to episode 216 of Canadian pinball podcast coming at you live from the NBC sweets hotel in Frisco, Texas.

[00:32] We are at Texas pinball festival and you know I'm recording from what is possibly probably the quietest place in the entire hotel, the gym.

[00:41] There is nobody in the gym.

[00:44] It is a rough first day at T.P.F. simply because I started drinking at probably five o'clock and I think we ended at possibly one a.m.

[00:58] But lots and lots of fun at T.P.F. to be had and look I love these shows and I've said it before like you come to these shows, you know probably 25% for the pinball and 75% for the people right I mean that's what these shows are all about and everyone is just amazing at these shows I mean but I have to say after day one we have unsuccessfully given Hilton his hoodie we had we were wearing it all last night I had it on all night and I didn't even spot him I think he's hiding somewhere.

[01:27] But we'll find him we'll find him and we will offer him his Hilton hoodie so what was it like for stay at T.P.F. So I came in I got here around four o'clock and I went over to the sports bar across the street have some drinks with Tiger Law you'll see some photos on Pinside if they didn't remove the thread of me with Robin and Martin and Tiger Law a lot of fun there.

[01:51] And then the show started it started at 5 p.m. and by that you know when when the show starts at T.P.F. what I love is it just opens up and you can jump on I think there's at least like 200 maybe 300 machines here there is so much here now you guys are not here to listen to me talk about all the old machines I actually had the opportunity to jump on some of the new stuff and so I want to give you my opinions this is going to be a little bit of a shorter podcast again because I'm just exhausted exhausted it.

[02:21] The show takes a lot out of you you can probably hear it in my voice. Let's start with Kingpin because I was able to jump on Kingpin and play that game for the first time and I had never even seen a Kingpin before in person.

[02:35] I have to say like it is a cool looking machine I can see why there's a lot of people who are very excited by that title look there's only eight in the world and just so to stand in front of a Kingpin and play it is really really fun.

[02:50] I mean it's it's a cool game. Is it a 40 to 50 thousand dollar game you know that's the part that everyone who plays the game talks about is you know I can't imagine ever plunking down that kind of money for one pinball machine but I can understand why the collector that want to has the that wants to have the rare thing would want a kingpin.

[03:12] Someone was saying that the sculptures on the casino you know the sort of like that slot machine area what wasn't the same as the original but I think this is still just like a little bit of a prototype of what they plan to do.

[03:28] I spoke to the gentleman I didn't catch his name he had the circus Maximus or pinball circus shirt on I'm really really nice guy talking about the machine and what their plans are they are not planning to make a limited number of Kingpins they are going to make as many as people want.

[03:45] There is no price yet on what Kingpin will cost and it's just an interesting debate is you're taking something that is super super special because it's super super rare it's sort of like this moby dick holy grail pinball machine and then you're just going to make as many as people want and then all of a sudden all of a sudden it just doesn't feel as special right.

[04:09] I am sad that this game is going to go from grail status to commodity status overnight if they really get making it off the ground now there's still a big question mark of you know these guys haven't really shown as they can mass produce anything and I think you know it's pinball circus I talked a lot about that with the gentleman and that game apparently is just a nightmare to make I mean Python Angelo's game is a design disaster.

[04:36] And they actually tried to sort of fix the issues with the flipper gap and that snake in the middle that you're supposed to like use your crotch to bump the machine to make it go up and that that didn't really work well anyone who ever played the original Python Angelo game it the ball just drained because the gap I mean it was like John Trudeau meets John Trudeau meets John Trudeau that's how big that flipper gap was and so they tried to make some design changes and it didn't work like the game just didn't shoot right.

[05:06] Something you know and and so I don't know I don't know pinball circus is ever going to be finished but I don't I don't really care I think that game is kind of garbage to be honest.

[05:15] All right so kingpin is cool though it's cool they didn't I didn't see the Ellie art package that I've been ragging on I think they're going to make Ellie versions of with that art package I would stay a country mile away from that art package I'll tell you why because the art package on kingpin right now is super cool now if I could give these guys some advice I would

[05:35] make the the remakes with Colossi decals and make it look really nice like the sort of the cabinet artwork on the kingpin that I saw at the show it's just very flat it's very flat it's not very glossy it's kind of boring it needs a little bit more sort of sizzle so I would update the original art with just better material decals if you look at the decals that are on and we'll go to the next Alice Cooper's nightmare castle

[06:04] they're incredible but also because they're not decals let's go to Alice Cooper now and spooky so I went over to spooky said hi to Chuck played some TNA with Ryan from head to head pinball and I have to say like TNA is a lot of fun it is a it is a it is a fast game but it's an easy game to understand it it sounds great there are TNAs that are sparkled all over T.P.F. which is cool it's almost like no matter where you are in the game

[06:33] no matter where you are in the show you can hear the sound of total nuclear annihilation which is really really cool Scott ran into Scott Denise love Scott we talked to him for a little bit he was telling me there's a co-op mode that he put into the game which is really cool

[06:49] I think if you hold the start button instead of playing one versus two versus three versus four all all people playing can cooperate and work together to destroy all nine reactors now that's really cool I think that's a first for pinball but you know me I don't really know much about pinball history but I think that's the first time there's co-op play

[07:10] so TNA very cool game you know I heard nothing but good things from people who have played it I only got to play one game on it I'm going to play some more at the show there's there's lots of them so I look forward to that today

[07:21] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle there's it's still got the cover over the glass I can't see the game but what I can see is it looks like there's a pretty big castle underneath there

[07:31] it looks like there's a lot going on I can I can definitely tell you from from not even being able to see through the play field cheap or the these got like this sort of like paper there's like foam paper I can tell you there's more going on in that game than his previous titles

[07:46] so I'm excited to see when that gets pulled off at four o'clock today now I was talking about the decals and the cabinet artwork for Alice Cooper's

[07:55] so Charlie has two Alice Cooper's on the floor the one to the left are decals and the one to the right is direct screen printed to the wood and it's so much nicer the colors are so much more vibrant

[08:10] and it looks amazing absolutely amazing I think it's more expensive to do I think he was saying it's a thousand dollar option but I'm going to tell you right now

[08:19] if you don't get that nicer print on your Alice Cooper I think you're silly I think it's worth the money and I think you know it's like kind of getting a car without the clear coat

[08:31] I mean that's what this looks like it looks that good and the artwork itself on Alice Cooper's nightmare castle on the cabinet and what not I have to say it wasn't the biggest fan of the translate but seeing the whole thing together

[08:45] it looks very very cool colors are very very vibrant and the game is going to pop it's going to pop in a game room I'm always a little bit on the fence of whether or not I'd like to see the title of the game on the side of the machine and should it be there

[08:59] like but then you know I have Batman 66 that doesn't say Batman 66 across the side and it looks incredible so I you know I go back and forth but I do think it looks amazing

[09:10] what else do we play at the show for the first time pirates of the Caribbean pirate of the Caribbean I was able to jump on pirates of the Caribbean at approximately 1250 am so over the loud speaker they kept saying pinball exposed I just call pinball I suppose that's how tired I am

[09:31] Texas pinball festival will be closing in 10 minutes and by close and they're serious I mean they're serious like it is walking around being like I got to go I got to go to bed shut your shit off

[09:42] so I jumped on pirate had a great four player game with some buddies Ryan was in there and as I was playing a little little birdie sort of flew in on my shoulder and it was Eric the designer of the game was there and we were we were you sort of telling me some tips on how to play the game

[10:00] I have to say I mean the game is gorgeous the game is gorgeous I really look forward to playing more of pirates and then you know the thing is this what I'm going to do today is I'm going to plug in my headphones so I can hear the game it is these shows are impossible to get any sense of immersion into the game you can hear anything but look the game is absolutely stunning stunning and I could hear the music and I have to say this I'm going to do this

[10:29] I have to say this you know for those of us who were concerned about whether or not having the original score would would not make this feel like a pirate to the Caribbean game I'm here to tell you those fears let them go because the music that David teal put into this game or feel I always say it wrong and then freaking you know whatever Greg Colton always reminds me I can't

[10:53] hear his name the music he put in sounds just like prior to the Caribbean it's got that very like symphonic like hurry up sort of pirate kind of music to it and the animations on the screen are really nice everything is cool in the game

[11:09] everything is cool in the game there's a lot going on there's a lot of inserts a lot of lights there's a lot to shoot at I really love the orbit shot it's sort of you don't think it's going to like loop around and it does

[11:21] it's not like an orbit fun like the far outside of the play field it sort of I think it's to the left like about like six inches to the left you're hitting a shot and you can't see where the balls going to go and all the sudden it loops around to the right it really really cool shot the rock and ship

[11:38] obviously very neat the the world pool everything about the game I mean I think the shots as people are saying it doesn't feel like a wide body it feels it feels fast and it feels fun so I again I need more time I this is I've

[11:52] spent one game on pirates and I didn't really know what I was doing so I just I was just excited to see something beautiful in front of me they had the collector's addition just the cabinet with the play field inside

[12:06] with a bottle on top next to it and I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the barnacles there it's it's definitely different it definitely stands out like you are not going to mistake the collector's addition for the

[12:19] Ellie and the other reason why you're not going to mistake it is the the topper on the collector's addition I think is worth the price of the game it is the coolest pinball topper I've seen it now you know I'm a fan of pinball toppers and the Batman topper is cool but this will

[12:35] take the cake for best pinball topper ever in fact I think we need to have a twippy award for best pinball topper of the year because I think I think more effort should go into toppers on pinball machines I do I think it completes the

[12:49] package so you know a lot of fun at Jersey Jack pinball I sat through the seminar a little bit of Jersey Jack and Eric talking about the making of the game I have to say there's something about the seminars and this show that just don't click and I think

[13:04] the part of the problem with the seminars at tpf is nobody is wrangling people to go to them and the seminar room is like at the far end of the hallway and I've been to a few seminars yesterday and you know they're they're like really

[13:20] really empty really empty unless a game is being unveiled it's like nobody really wants to hear you talk about the game that's already out and that's that's just the reality of like these shows and that's why unveils are so important for these shows

[13:36] because they get people in like people come to see the new stuff and so it is going to be jammers in the room at four o'clock today to see Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle jammers I was in Christopher franchise seminar yesterday with his daughter and you know not many people just simply because it's like what you know he talked about making the artwork for gardens the galaxy now what was cool and I do love seeing all the

[14:05] artwork that didn't get approved for gardens the galaxy and the different things that he wanted to do with the game I always think that stuff is really fun I'm not I don't think he can even share that stuff on the side because those images are not approved but it's something he could definitely share at a seminar at a show like this so it was lots of fun hanging out with with Chris and his daughter we we all went to dinner went to dinner this is our dinner create I'm going to forget some people we got Brad and Blake now Brad is the guy who bought alien

[14:34] we got Zach from straight down the middle podcast we had Jack danger we had Lyman sheets was sitting next to me the whole time which was incredible it's incredible now Lyman is like one of the most humble nice men on the planet and if you haven't met Lyman sheets the man it's incredible because like as a pinball person and as a pinball fan I think we're all sort of like in awe of the man and when you go up to him you want to just be like oh my god

[15:04] you realize like you make the best pinball machines on the planet and he's just like well yeah you know I mean I like to play you know there's not a lot of there's there's such a humbleness behind him which is incredible I tried to get out of him the Batman SLE coding and how the names we're going to work and how the call outs we're going to work and I kind of got the feeling like he didn't really know how he was going to make it work like how he's how he was going to get each individual person's code to talk to their individual machine

[15:34] I don't think they haven't figured out so even though Adam West did record our voices I don't think we're ever going to get it now speaking of Batman code there's new Batman code and there's like Catwoman in there

[15:47] there is no I'm not blind I the Catwoman scene or the Catwoman that was in Batman to me was was an African American Catwoman right I mean it's it's it's they they have that in there now they have

[16:02] there's new images all over the game like when you start Catwoman now it's a different visual there I saw it in image of like Batman I think it was Batman in the Joker like running through the ocean like there are so many new clips in the game I don't is it code 1.0 I haven't even been on

[16:18] pinside to see yet what the new code number is but there is a lot of new stuff in the game and and Lyman was telling me last night there's still there's still like lots more to come so I don't think the game is complete but it's it's incredible how much it has gone into Batman and and and how great the game continues to be I'm not I'm not going to keep showing and I know I get yelled at every time I do now there is no iron made in here so that there was like a rumor there was a rumor percolating through tpf that

[16:48] a stern to bring iron maiden and they're gonna like shock people and like surprise me to light them

[16:53] and then I just you know I just went up to Jared and I said hey Jared man it does is iron maiden happening is like nope absolutely not so there's that okay I saw George Gomez at the bar across the street when I first got here and I went up and said hi to him I think it kind of looked at me like you know who the hell I was but maybe he just looked at me like I don't want to know who you are can a but you know like stern is here is turn has a big presence

[17:18] what's fun about these shows and the other thing is this is like when you've got stern you've got American pinball which by the way I did not get to play

[17:25] Houdini yesterday but I am happy to say that they brought a lot of Houdini's here so there are a lot of them I must have seen like four to six of them so I'm going to play

[17:35] Houdini today to see if I if I enjoy Houdini more than the one at sunshine there's so you got American pinball you got stern you got Jersey Jack you know you've got

[17:44] you got you got you got Kingpin you've got like spooky games you got you know all these different manufacturers

[17:51] everything is here and when I love about going from one to the next to the next and then you know jumping on like old

[17:57] stern machines like Simpsons and classic Valley Williams games it's really amazing how each game has a

[18:04] signature feel and each manufacturer's games feel different and you really really get a sense for the that and when you jump

[18:15] from one machine to another and it's it's incredible like each game has its own personality it has its own feel and it's like I always say like

[18:22] that's why you have to jump on and play these things before you buy them because you need to know you know not just is it the right

[18:31] feel for you but it isn't the right experience but I have to say like it is impossible it's almost impossible at a show to jump on a game and

[18:41] know if you want to buy it just because of all the the noises and the inability to actually like here the game I don't think

[18:48] you're going to get the experience that way I'm trying to think about there's anything else that I want to talk about yet

[18:55] the show I haven't jumped on cosmic cart racing it looked really neat I walked by it I actually saw Jerry at 1 a.m. when I was walking towards the elevator so I'm

[19:03] going to jump on that today you know today's like pinball day for me because I think the first day you're just really excited to be around all these people that you

[19:12] only see online for so many months on that it's such a social outing and for me as a New Yorker it's been freezing cold in New

[19:22] York and I got here and it was like 83 degrees and sunny so I got a drink and I sat outside in the sun for like a good hour because I literally I've waited months just to have

[19:33] vitamin D hit my body and so that was what I did for an hour you know and the day went fast I have to say like by the I didn't realize it was

[19:41] one o'clock which was also 2 a.m. for me as a New Yorker and so like it's just it was such a social day it wasn't there wasn't that much pinball I played but I will

[19:52] definitely definitely be playing a lot more pinball today because I'm a lot more hungover and I need a chill day today so that's what's

[20:00] going to happen I ran into a lot of people who are fans of the show and I want to say to all those guys out there thank you for

[20:08] coming up to me and saying hi and and that you're a listener of the show I can't tell you how much I appreciate when people say that to me

[20:17] because you're the reason I do this show you're the reason I do it you're the reason I travel the Texas pinball festival if you want to find me today I have a white t-shirt on and on the front it says

[21:06] but that is what I'll be wearing to the show today I will also because it does get cold in here I will also have the hilton hoodie on me throughout the day as well we're going to find

[21:17] hilton at some point and make sure he gets his hoodie I also think we might just have people sign it like the apron of destiny and bring a sharpie with us and you know I'll wear it around to all the different shows and people can sign their names and it'll be awesome
