[00:00] Oh, I want for the most of you.

[00:06] You, baby.

[00:10] Ah, welcome to episode 625 of the only System 12 pinball podcast on your host, Canada.

[00:20] And you know what?

[00:21] It's Christmas season.

[00:22] Mariah declares it every November 1st.

[00:25] She smashed a bunch of pumpkins.

[00:27] Does that mean Halloween is over?

[00:29] Is Halloween pinball over or is this game going to turn around on this episode of Canada's

[00:34] pinball podcast?

[00:35] I want to talk about spooky pinball and only spooky pinball.

[00:40] They were the one company that was very absent from Expo this year.

[00:45] We got to play all of the new games except for Halloween and Ultra Man.

[00:50] There was a Halloween up inside one of the suites at the Expo Hotel.

[00:54] I know people were playing it.

[00:56] I spoke to a friend who that was his personal game and he ended up selling it after playing

[01:02] it a few times.

[01:03] And there were a lot of candid conversations about these games at Expo.

[01:07] And it's funny to me because people come up to me and they tell me how they really feel

[01:11] about this.

[01:13] And then you go on to Pinside and none of them are honest about their opinions about these

[01:18] games.

[01:19] And then you go on to the thread and it's either people cheerleading because they bought

[01:23] the game or it's people being way too stridently evil about the games themselves.

[01:28] Now, here's what I want to do.

[01:29] Before I talk about what I think is going on with spooky and these games, let's do a

[01:34] little history lesson on this company because I think the context is really important.

[01:40] Okay?

[01:41] So spooky game number one was America's most haunted.

[01:45] It was out in March of 2014.

[01:49] This game was pretty much Ben Hex design.

[01:51] It used the pin heck board that Ben designed.

[01:54] And remember, it was really hard for them to sell this game.

[01:57] It arguably was one of the ugliest pinball machines of all time.

[02:01] I still joke about that with Ben.

[02:03] And they made 150 of these games in 2014.

[02:08] Now remember that date because this company has been around making pinball machines now

[02:12] for seven almost eight years.

[02:15] And the price for this game was $5,995.

[02:21] The key game number two was Rob Zombie's Spook Show International.

[02:26] Came out in February of 2016.

[02:29] It was designed by Charlie Emory, Ben Hex, and Dennis Nordman did a little help with them.

[02:36] The art was by Alex Horley and Matt Reisterer.

[02:39] I hope I said that right.

[02:41] Matt is from, I believe he's back alley creations and the dots and animations, which we're

[02:45] going to talk a lot about when we think about these new games.

[02:48] The dots and animations were done by David Van S.

[02:53] And the software was done by David Fosset, whose Fosma, right?

[02:57] That's how we know him.

[02:58] And the system is the pin heck system.

[03:01] Now Rob Zombie's International, here were the prices.

[03:03] The standard was $5,995.

[03:07] The LE was $6,495.

[03:12] They made 300 total games.

[03:15] And if you remember, there were 50 LE's and 250 standard versions of this game.

[03:21] Spooky game number 2.5 was Domino's Spectacular Pinball Adventure.

[03:26] That was designed by Charlie Emory.

[03:28] The art was done by Scott Gullix, who you know him now as the man who is behind Legends

[03:33] of Vahala.

[03:35] And the cabinet art was done by Blake Dumasnil.

[03:38] The dots and animations in Domino's was done by David Van S.

[03:43] The music was by Chris Branden, David Fossma, and David Van S, sound by David Van S,

[03:49] software by Fossma.

[03:51] And then there were 135 of these games made.

[03:55] And the price was $5,299.

[03:59] Now if you remember, this was a commission game by the Domino's company.

[04:03] And that is why this is not really a spooky, original concept.

[04:07] They came to them and asked them to make these games.

[04:09] I'm not even going to talk about the Jetsons that Nick Parks commissioned for Spooky to

[04:13] make because that doesn't really matter from what I want to talk about.

[04:16] Spooky game number 3.

[04:18] Total Nuclear Annihilation.

[04:21] September of 2017.

[04:23] There's not a lot of variety on who was behind this game.

[04:27] Concept, Scott Dinesi.

[04:29] Design, Scott Dinesi.

[04:31] Dots Animation, again, dots and animation, David Van S, Matt Andrews.

[04:37] Mechanics by Scott Dinesi.

[04:39] Music by Scott Dinesi.

[04:41] Sound by Scott Dinesi.

[04:43] Software by Scott Dinesi, Michael Ocean, and Jimmy Lippum.

[04:47] Okay, and there were a total of 550 TNAs made and they were $5,995.

[04:55] Now you could order it with the Butter Cabinet which added $1,000 to it, but we're talking

[05:00] $6,000 or $7,000 for a TNA.

[05:04] Spooky game number 4.

[05:05] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[05:07] June 2018.

[05:10] Designed by Charlie Emory.

[05:12] Art by Jeff Zorno.

[05:14] Now it's interesting about Jeff Zorno.

[05:16] If you know this guy, he's the guy that they wanted to do the Godzilla art package.

[05:21] And I think everyone would argue that the Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle to this date

[05:25] was Spooky's nicest art package.

[05:28] Dots and animations once again, David Van S.

[05:33] Sweet by Alice Cooper and Matt Montgomery.

[05:36] Sound by Scott Dinesi.

[05:38] Software by David Fawcett.

[05:41] Scott Dinesi and Jimmy Lippum.

[05:43] And this game used the multi-morphic P3 Rock System.

[05:48] And the MSRP for Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle was $6,250 which I think they later changed

[05:55] to $6,450.

[05:58] And there were a total of 500 games made.

[06:02] And I believe with Alice Cooper, there was just one game.

[06:06] There wasn't like Ellie's blood suckers and all this stuff.

[06:10] And you were talking $6,450.

[06:12] And I also believe with Alice Cooper's, you could order the Butter Cabinet and get your

[06:16] game up to $7,450 if you wanted that.

[06:20] Game number 5.

[06:21] The one that sold out.

[06:22] Spooky's hottest selling game today.

[06:24] Rick and Morty.

[06:25] February 2020.

[06:27] Scott Dinesi designed it.

[06:29] Dots and animation.

[06:30] David Van S. Again.

[06:33] Mechanics by Scott Dinesi.

[06:34] Music by Scott Dinesi.

[06:36] Sound by Scott Dinesi.

[06:37] Software by Eric Prepki.

[06:40] Bowen Carons.

[06:41] Chris Knight's Sold.

[06:43] And Jimmy Lippum.

[06:44] And they're Revoice Overs by Justin Rorland from the show.

[06:47] And this MSRP for this game was $7,520.

[06:52] Now, they asked for a $1,500 deposit.

[06:55] But if you had all of the options and the Butter Cabinet, this is what my game total was.

[07:00] On Rick and Morty.

[07:02] $9,480 was the total amount of money I sent to Spooky Pimball for my Rick and Morty with

[07:10] Butter Cabinet.

[07:11] Of the 750 sold, 36 of the standard editions were sold and 714 were the Blood Sucker editions.

[07:20] And then we get to today.

[07:22] Spooky games number 6 and 7.

[07:25] Seven years after this company's been out, we have Halloween and Ultraman.

[07:29] And these games came out July of 2021.

[07:33] Now, let's talk about Halloween because Ultraman's the same game and I want to keep this

[07:37] focused on Halloween because that's where the majority of the conversation is.

[07:42] That's where the majority of the games sold.

[07:45] And this is the game I want to talk about right now.

[07:47] Game design.

[07:49] Bug and Luke designed this game.

[07:52] Brand new designers into the world of Pimball.

[07:54] There's no Charlie Emory, no Scott Dinesi, no Dennis Nordman, Bug and Luke.

[07:59] Game animations.

[08:01] Who's missing from this list?

[08:03] We don't see David Van S as a game animator anymore.

[08:06] It's Ryan Policki.

[08:08] Game code is still David Phasma.

[08:10] We've seen him on a bunch of games.

[08:12] Now this is interesting.

[08:14] Licensing for this game was David Bunny Yip Van S.

[08:18] So why is David Van S licensing this game for them but not doing the animations?

[08:24] Artwork was Jason Edmiston.

[08:27] Examples of this game are by Bug Emory and David Phasma.

[08:32] Engineering is by Spooky Luke and wiring nasty nuts and bolts AJ custom music, Matt County

[08:39] Montgomery and Scolps Matt Reister.

[08:42] I think it might have had Matt's name wrong.

[08:44] I copied it off of the internet database.

[08:46] So maybe I spelled it wrong.

[08:47] So it's Matt Reister, not Reister.

[08:49] Okay, so that's easier to say.

[08:51] Sorry, Matt.

[08:52] The reactor's edition of this Spooky Pimball machine is $8,999 with a non-refundable deposit

[09:01] of $2,000 and if you add a butter cabinet to this machine, you are at pretty much $10,000

[09:10] spooky machine.

[09:11] The Blood Sucker Edition is $7,999.

[09:16] There's a $1,500 non-refundable initial deposit and those games are built second.

[09:21] Now the standard edition of this game is still just $6,999.

[09:28] They are built last and this is a $1,000 initial payment.

[09:32] Now that's a big jump, right?

[09:34] That's a big jump.

[09:35] So Spooky saw what all the other companies were doing.

[09:37] They saw how the whole LE Premium and Pro model was working for everybody else and this

[09:42] is pretty much them following suit and you can't blame them and they were very smart

[09:47] and they announced that there were going to be a total of $1,250,000 and $500,000, which

[09:55] is a huge bump up if you think about it.

[09:58] That is double, double, the number of games they made for Rick and Morty.

[10:02] So they either are doubling their staff, their space, their production because they still

[10:07] want to make all of these games in 18 months.

[10:11] And so now here is where we get to the present day and what I believe is a really important

[10:19] moment in this company's history and an important crossroads for Spooky Pimball because I want

[10:26] to start out by saying this, Spooky Pimball has built this company the right way.

[10:32] If you look at the way they've grown, a $150 games, then $300 games, then $500 games,

[10:40] then $750 games, then $750 games, then all the way up to $1,750 games.

[10:47] It's even more than double the Rick and Morty, sorry, it's a thousand more games than

[10:50] Rick and Morty.

[10:51] So over this seven year period, this company has learned how to make Pimball Machines.

[10:57] They've learned how to improve a Pimball Machines.

[11:01] They've learned how to manufacture which is the hardest thing to do.

[11:04] They've built up their factory in Benton, Wisconsin.

[11:07] They've worked with different people from Piroc Multimorphic, Ben Heck.

[11:11] They've worked with different animators, different coders, different artists.

[11:15] So there have been a lot of people, Scott Dinesy on music, Dennis Nordman giving them advice.

[11:20] There have been a lot of people that have helped Spooky Pimball grow over the years.

[11:25] And now we are at a point where their games are priced pretty much at the same level of

[11:31] Stern Pimball.

[11:32] And now you can even option out their games where their games are pretty much close enough

[11:37] in price to a Stern Ely, a Jersey Jack Pimball Ely.

[11:42] Everything over at American Pimball is the same price.

[11:45] Everything over at Chicago Gaming Company is the same price.

[11:48] I mean, you can option out a Halloween with all the bells and whistles to be more expensive

[11:54] than Cactus Canyon remake Ely.

[11:57] And because of this now, because Spooky Pimball is priced at the same level as all the other

[12:04] major players in the Pimball hobby, we can no longer look at Spooky Pimball like this cute

[12:10] little boutique Pimball from Benton, Wisconsin because now they are priced in the big leagues.

[12:17] And so I think when you start to look at it this way, you have to start to ask yourself,

[12:22] are we getting a game?

[12:24] That is worth $9,000, $10,000.

[12:28] Is the theme being integrated into this game the way it should be?

[12:33] Does the game shoot on the same level as a Keith L. and Pim?

[12:36] I think it's fair.

[12:37] I only think it's natural because now they're in the big leagues is that we be able to look

[12:42] at Spooky Pimball and analyze Spooky Pimball in the same competitive set of a Stern, of

[12:49] a Jersey Jack, of a Chicago gaming company, of an American Pimball.

[12:54] Why not?

[12:55] My checking account doesn't know the difference between Spooky Pimball and Stern Pimball

[12:59] when a Godzilla Ely is basically the same exact price as my Ultraman CE.

[13:05] I mean it's almost kind of scary that I'm saying that, but that is the truth.

[13:09] But here's the thing I want to talk about today.

[13:11] Is that Spooky Pimball, while they've been around for seven years, that these titles that

[13:16] just came out?

[13:18] They are pretty much the first major titles that have been made by Luke and Bug.

[13:23] And so you have two young guys who are throwing their hat into the Pimball ring.

[13:27] And I'm fine with that.

[13:28] Like I have nothing against young talent jumping into the ring.

[13:32] But a lot of the talent that helped Spooky get to this point is very absent from these

[13:38] two games.

[13:40] And I think people are starting to see that and I think they're starting to notice that.

[13:45] Because the overall climate right now is this.

[13:48] Each and every one of you, and I mean this, each and every one of you who bought an Ultraman

[13:53] or a Halloween, there are 1,750 of you right now.

[13:58] Each and every one of you is now a guinea pig for Spooky Pimball's new team making these

[14:05] games.

[14:06] Your guinea pigs.

[14:08] And here's the thing that I keep noticing on Pinside and I want to address this because

[14:11] I think this is an important thing to talk about.

[14:14] I think there is this misconception that just because a company listens and responds that

[14:21] that equals a game is going to get better.

[14:25] And I want to talk about that because I think it's very important.

[14:27] I'm going to tell you right now, honestly, in my profession and in other great products

[14:33] that are out in the world, I don't want to buy a product and be a guinea pig.

[14:38] I don't want to buy a product and be a beta tester who's already paid in full.

[14:44] I think all of you are also beta testing this game with the company.

[14:48] I want a product to be beta tested before it's released to the public.

[14:53] I want them to put it through its paces.

[14:55] I want them to call out things that need fixing.

[14:58] I don't think consumers should spend 7 to $10,000 on a Spooky Pimball machine and have

[15:06] to give feedback to them on how to make their own product better.

[15:11] Let me ask all of you a question right now.

[15:14] Do any of you have to give Keith Ellen feedback on how to make Godzilla better?

[15:19] Have any of you ever had to give feedback to Lyman Sheets or Keith Johnson had to code

[15:25] their machines better?

[15:26] I think there is a reality taking shape that these games need work, that they need help.

[15:32] And I think the buyers of the game, especially the Halloween buyers, they are huge fans

[15:38] of the property and they need to fall in love with it.

[15:42] They need to tell you the game is great because there is no other Halloween coming out.

[15:47] And I think the fanboys of Halloween, they naturally want to say everything is good and

[15:52] it's going to get even better.

[15:54] And so they're giving feedback and they're like they're going to take care of it, they're

[15:57] going to make it so much better.

[15:59] And if we look at the history of Pimball games that made you wait a long time for stuff,

[16:04] okay?

[16:05] And it's not a lot anymore, right?

[16:06] There are not a lot of companies anymore that make you wait for games to be finished.

[16:11] Jersey Jack doesn't release games unfinished like this anymore.

[16:15] No, they don't.

[16:16] When Guns and Roses came out, like it was done.

[16:19] When Willy Wonka came out, it was pretty much done.

[16:22] Sure they polished it a little bit, but man they didn't make major changes to the games.

[16:27] Now we all know what happens with Lyman Sheets games and people wait a long time, but

[16:31] there's only one reason why you are willing to wait for Lyman Sheets to finish his games.

[16:36] It's because of Lyman Sheets.

[16:38] There's no Lyman Sheets over here.

[16:41] Who's the coder out here that's going to make you wait all these months?

[16:44] Recently Luke said something on Pinside.

[16:46] He says, well we've got a year to make the game better.

[16:49] And when you hear something like that, I don't understand that.

[16:52] I actually get nervous when a company puts a game into the marketplace and takes your

[16:57] money.

[16:58] And over at the company, they're feeling like they have an entire year to get it right.

[17:04] No that's not how it should be.

[17:06] That is not how it should be.

[17:08] Didn't they have enough time between Rick and Morty and this to make sure this game was

[17:12] further along?

[17:14] And so clearly this is a talent and a resource issue, but that attitude that we're going

[17:19] to put hundreds of games into people's homes without them being finished.

[17:25] And we're going to ask you for a non-refundable deposit before you know if the game's even

[17:30] good, before if we even know the game's even good.

[17:33] And simply because we're transparent and we're listening to you and we're telling you,

[17:39] we're going to get it right.

[17:41] We're going to hire more people.

[17:42] This is what they're saying.

[17:43] We're going to hire more people and we're going to get it right.

[17:46] We have a year to make this game right.

[17:48] That year should have started a year ago before you put the game out in the world.

[17:54] Because again, this isn't Lyman Sheetson code.

[17:56] It's not Keith Johnson.

[17:58] There's no veterans on this.

[18:00] This is the first time Bug is doing a rule set with Phasma.

[18:04] And the other big thing that happened yesterday that people found out for the first time we

[18:08] can't not talk about this is Bowen Karen's let people know that he's had nothing to do

[18:15] with this game.

[18:16] And when people were told that this game was coming out at the very beginning, spooky

[18:21] pinball said that Bowen Karen's would be working on or consulting on the rule set of

[18:26] this game.

[18:27] I want to read for you what Bowen Karen said.

[18:29] He said to clarify two things.

[18:31] First, the description of Rick and Morty is just about right on.

[18:34] Eric, besides writing 100% of the code worked very closely with me and wrote many of the

[18:40] rules.

[18:41] He is outstanding, detail oriented, fast, accurate, and he knows how to make pinball fun.

[18:47] Eric is a huge reason why Rick and Morty is a great pinball machine.

[18:52] Second, I no longer work with spooky pinball.

[18:55] The first time I saw the layout, the art, and the rules for Halloween and Old Tra man

[18:59] was the first time you saw it publicly.

[19:02] After it was revealed, I gave spooky some advice on what they could or should do with these

[19:07] games based on video.

[19:10] I have not played either game at all and I have not seen my suggestions implement it.

[19:16] What they do with my advice is entirely their decision.

[19:19] I am not involved in any way that is not what I would have preferred but that is what

[19:25] they chose.

[19:26] I mean, we could just hard stop right there.

[19:29] Is that what you want to read from Bowen Karen?

[19:32] This sounds like that was a bad breakup and a bad exit.

[19:37] He goes on to say that he'll root for spooky team and Charlie but man, I don't care about

[19:41] that final paragraph.

[19:43] The one before it is pretty damning.

[19:45] The one before it speaks volumes.

[19:48] So he's not involved with this game.

[19:50] David Van S is not involved with animations and he's been on so many animations with them.

[19:55] Scott Denise is nowhere near this game with music and he's such a great musical engineer

[20:00] where is his help on these games.

[20:02] And so 7 years in.

[20:04] 7 years in.

[20:05] Here's what I think is happening with these games.

[20:08] I think after 7 years and at this price point, what you really wanted to see was all of

[20:14] the talented people that have helped spooky get to this point, be on the field for these

[20:20] games.

[20:21] But they're missing.

[20:22] David Van S missing.

[20:24] Bowen Karen's missing.

[20:26] Scott Denise missing.

[20:28] And so what we have is we have Fosma but I think Fosma's underwater right now because now

[20:33] he's got to do two games.

[20:35] He's got to do two games with a team that's pretty new.

[20:39] Lots of people that are just learning this for the first time.

[20:42] And as they're learning how to do this for the first time, they're already shipping

[20:47] games.

[20:48] Games are in customer homes.

[20:49] They clearly, clearly have never had to do something like this before.

[20:54] Let me explain another big challenge for spooky.

[20:56] They've never had to take a movie and make it into a pinball machine ever before.

[21:01] This is their first time working with license assets from a movie like the first two Halloween

[21:07] films.

[21:08] Imagine how hard that is to understand how to now for the first time ever take movie

[21:14] clips, take animations, take rule sets, put them all together for the first time ever.

[21:21] They've never done this before.

[21:23] And all of this is a learning experience.

[21:26] And that's where all of you are at right now who are buying these games.

[21:30] You bought in as beta testers as they learn how to do this.

[21:35] And I don't think any of this is unfair.

[21:38] I think all of you knew all of this and spooky is a company that has amazing good will.

[21:44] A lot of the reasons why everyone loves to go in on a spooky game is we love their story.

[21:49] They went from nothing to something.

[21:52] They grew this company the American way.

[21:54] They grew it the right way.

[21:56] They've never ripped anyone off.

[21:58] They never went against their word.

[21:59] They never made more LEDs after they sold 750 Rick and Morty's.

[22:04] They've been a company of their word.

[22:06] But at this price point now, this is the crossroads of spooky pinball right now.

[22:12] They are priced in the big leagues.

[22:15] And my main question I have, I think they need to invest in more talent and they need to

[22:21] get more people into this company and they need to spend money to get those people.

[22:27] And when I look at who's on this list of who's making this game, I don't think they're

[22:32] doing that.

[22:33] I don't think they're going out and getting a better animator.

[22:37] Look at the animations in everyone else's games at this price point.

[22:41] Brand new game designers, right?

[22:43] I wish Buggin Luke the best.

[22:45] But for the same price of the game they design, you can buy a game designed by Pat Lawler,

[22:51] a game designed by Eric Minier, a game designed by Keith Owin, a game designed by George Gomez,

[22:57] a game designed by John Borg, a game designed by Dennis Nordman.

[23:01] I mean, when you stop looking at each pinball machine in a vacuum and you say to yourself,

[23:06] I have $9000 to $10,000 to spend on any pinball out in the world.

[23:12] Any pinball out in the world.

[23:13] When you start to look at it through that lens, you start to get more clarity and you

[23:18] come back down to reality.

[23:20] Is this game good enough for a $9000 to $10,000 pinball experience?

[23:26] Does it have enough?

[23:27] And that's up to each and every one of you to figure out.

[23:30] But when you start to ask questions like, if Stern pinball or Jersey Jack pinball made

[23:36] Halloween and this was how they made Halloween and this is how they theme integrated Halloween,

[23:43] would you be happy?

[23:44] And if the answer is no, then why are you happy that it comes from spooky this way?

[23:50] And that's the very root of where the apologist mindset comes from that I'm not going to look

[23:55] at this company the same way I look at that company.

[23:58] But I'm tired of looking at it like that.

[24:01] Money is money people.

[24:02] Money is money.

[24:03] Let me use a cargument.

[24:05] If you're shopping for a $100,000 car, do you say to yourself, well, if that car is

[24:11] $100,000 and it's way nicer than this other car that's $100,000 and am I willing to accept

[24:18] the car that's not as good because it comes from a mom and pop company?

[24:22] No, that's not how you would ever do it.

[24:25] So why do we do it now in pinball?

[24:27] So what I'm suggesting to spooky is this, you're now in the big leagues, you got to get

[24:33] the talent up, you got to get your games to market in a way that's much more polished

[24:38] than this.

[24:39] You can't make your customers be beta testers, you can't make them be guinea pigs.

[24:44] The most important word that spooky pinball needs to invest in now starts with the letter

[24:50] T and they've been doing one T word for a very long time and it's built them a ton

[24:56] of goodwill in the hobby, a ton of goodwill, but now they need to focus on a different

[25:00] T word.

[25:01] The T word they've used for so many years is transparency, but all the transparency in

[25:06] the world is not better than the next T word, which is the one they need to invest in and

[25:11] that is talent.

[25:13] They need to invest in talent.

[25:15] I don't want to.

[25:17] I don't want to have to tell a pinball company when I spend $9,000 had to make the game

[25:23] better.

[25:24] I don't want to have to tell a pinball company when I spend $9,000 that they need to put

[25:28] more of the movie into the game.

[25:30] I don't want to have to tell a pinball company when I spend $9,000 that it doesn't say

[25:35] hedge multi-baw.

[25:36] It needs to say hedge multi-baw when it lights up.

[25:39] I don't want to have to do this stuff.

[25:41] I want to buy a game.

[25:43] I want to buy a toy and I mean this for all manufacturers.

[25:46] I don't want to wait for them to finish the game when it's in my living room or in my

[25:50] arcade.

[25:51] These games should be launched finished.

[25:54] They should be launched when they're done.

[25:57] Any other way is just an excuse.

[25:59] It's just an excuse.

[26:00] I get it.

[26:01] If Stern has four to five games a year, I understand why Stern games have a little bit of a code

[26:08] way to go.

[26:09] I understand that and everyone understands.

[26:11] If Stern's doing this much, then we can give them a break.

[26:14] They're going to get that game to 1.0 within a year.

[26:16] But they've got four to five games in development.

[26:19] Jersey Jack Pimball is much like spooky.

[26:22] They focus on one game at a time and that is why Jersey Jack games, they come out finished.

[26:28] So there's no excuse.

[26:29] There is no excuse that you can't release a game in much better shape than this because

[26:34] what else have you been working on?

[26:37] It's not like you've got four to five games and maybe instead of making 1,750 games,

[26:43] maybe instead of increasing your manufacturing by 1,000 units, you should have staffed

[26:49] up more in the animation department, in the coding department and maybe went from 750

[26:55] games to just a thousand games because now you've put so much pressure on manufacturing

[27:02] but you didn't invest in the other areas and it's showing and it's showing and you're

[27:07] building the ship in the ocean now.

[27:09] And for the fans out there, I get it.

[27:11] I can hear them all crying already.

[27:13] But man, I understand you love Halloween.

[27:15] I understand it but this isn't how it should be and I would give this advice to any Pimball

[27:21] company that does it this way and I'm still friends with the family over at spooky.

[27:26] I'm still friends with this company.

[27:27] I actually want this company to be successful and I don't think they're hearing anything

[27:32] they don't know and maybe the biggest challenge and I've heard this, some of the biggest

[27:37] challenge for them will be getting talent if they want it in house to go to Benton, Wisconsin.

[27:44] That's the hardest part.

[27:46] That is always the hardest part when you are in a more obscure location to get talent to go

[27:52] there. But the good news is you don't have to live in Benton, Wisconsin to do code.

[27:58] You don't have to live in Benton, Wisconsin to do animations.

[28:02] So there is no excuse like the Jersey Jack animator is all the way over in Europe.

[28:07] So you can have those people be anywhere but design.

[28:11] Yes, the design people need to be at the location.

[28:14] We know that.

[28:15] So this is where spooky is at right now and I see a mixture of people cancelling orders

[28:21] of some people saying the game is great.

[28:23] It's only going to get better.

[28:25] I see spooky Luke saying they're hiring more people and they have a year to finish these games

[28:30] and there's just a lot of talk and I don't want there to be a lot of talk and speculation

[28:35] and head scratching on which direction Pimball machines go in.

[28:38] I want all these games to come out done.

[28:41] Shouldn't that be something that as a community we put the pressure on Pimball machines to

[28:47] only release a game when it's good enough to be released.

[28:51] And I don't think there is anyone out there, anyone out there who got this game Halloween

[28:57] on day one that can honestly unbox it and say this game was good enough to shift to customers

[29:03] this way.

[29:04] And you know it deep down inside and I get if you're a Halloween fan you're going to

[29:08] overlook a lot and I'm not a huge Halloween fan.

[29:11] I didn't even go down the road of like how Halloween might be a really hard theme and

[29:16] a really hard license to nail because the main character is this silent guy that just walks

[29:21] at you with a butcher knife like maybe that's not the easiest game to make into a Pimball

[29:26] machine and it's not right.

[29:28] So you take a new account you've got a hard subject matter you've got guys that haven't

[29:32] done this before and yet somehow the apologists think if you put all of that in a blender it's

[29:37] just going to be amazing in the end and I don't know maybe I'm not the eternal optimist in this hobby

[29:42] and maybe at these high prices I'm being a little bit more critical but man nine to ten thousand

[29:48] dollars I want everything that I want in these games and I don't want to be your beta tester

[29:53] and I don't want to be your guinea pig.

[29:55] I want to unbox my toys when they're finished I want to buy my cars when they drive right.

[30:00] I want to put a Rolex on my wrist when it tells time perfectly okay and maybe that's just
