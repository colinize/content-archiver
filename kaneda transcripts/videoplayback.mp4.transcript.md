[02:05] We, you know, hearts going out to you and the family, brother.

[02:08] Alan, what's up?

[02:10] Look at this.

[02:11] Sad boy's already in town.

[02:13] He's already rolling in with the 50 bucks.

[02:15] I love this guy.

[02:16] By the way, I think my entire show is just going to be dedicated to sad boy from now.

[02:23] Sad boy.

[02:23] I'm going to do like just shows just for you, brother.

[02:27] Shout out to my boys at Next Level Pinball shop in Hillsboro, Oregon for talking the

[02:37] number one spot in wait for taking the number one spot in Newsweek's poll for best arcade

[02:44] in the country.

[02:46] More than deserve.

[02:48] No one can touch the place.

[02:50] Wow.

[02:51] I got to go next level.

[02:53] Sounds next level.

[02:56] What's going on?

[02:57] Everybody.

[03:01] How's everybody doing?

[03:02] I'm coming at you live from Rewading, Connecticut.

[03:06] The most beautiful town I think in the world.

[03:10] I love my little house.

[03:12] I love my wife, my children, my fans.

[03:16] I love pinball.

[03:18] I love that.

[03:20] We're going to talk about it.

[03:21] Retro Ralph in Canada.

[03:23] Back, baby.

[03:25] Back.

[03:25] Back.

[03:26] I mean.

[03:27] Like, like.

[03:28] Legit.

[03:29] Like, life is way too short to hold any grudges whatsoever.

[03:35] Ralph is a good guy.

[03:36] We're going to talk about that later.

[03:38] We're going to just get into it because I actually woke up this morning beyond hungover

[03:44] past the point of hangover is the point of eternal happiness.

[03:50] I mean it.

[03:50] Where you just start to see everything clearly.

[03:55] Beautiful day.

[03:56] No humidity.

[03:57] 70 degrees and sunny.

[04:01] And I'm talking about something that I've been feeling lately.

[04:06] And I'm just going to say it right now for all of you.

[04:09] I think the next three years of pinball will produce the best pinball we've ever seen ever.

[04:19] I mean it.

[04:20] I think the next three years of pinball will produce games better than the last three years.

[04:26] 30 years of pinball.

[04:29] I think.

[04:30] I think this industry, even though the prices are high, which is another reason why it's

[04:36] going to happen, is people are going to deliver on the expectations, on the themes, on the

[04:43] execution, on the assets, on the layouts.

[04:47] We are going to get the best three years in pinball over the next three years.

[04:53] Back to the future.

[04:55] I know it's Steve Richie's next.

[04:56] You're going to buy it.

[04:57] I know it's Spooky's next.

[04:58] You're going to buy it.

[04:59] I know it's Stern has come and you're going to want to buy a lot of it.

[05:04] It's going to be great.

[05:06] It's absolutely going to be great.

[05:09] Ah, how's everybody doing?

[05:11] Welcome.

[05:15] I am going to go to the beach today, Charles.

[05:16] I'm going to go to the beach.

[05:18] Please give titles of the next three years.

[05:22] You're going to want them all.

[05:23] Sad boy.

[05:23] Thank you so much for the 50 bucks.

[05:25] Remember.

[05:26] If you love Canada's pinball podcast and you want to show your support, there's a little

[05:30] dollar sign down there.

[05:32] You can super chat me, right?

[05:33] You can super chat.

[05:34] You come into X.

[05:35] Of course, I'm going to Expo.

[05:38] I always go to Expo.

[05:40] You know, look, they wanted to kick me out last year.

[05:44] I didn't do anything.

[05:45] David Figgs tried to get me kicked out.

[05:48] You know who saved me?

[05:50] They, they, when David Figgs tried to kick me out, Melvin said, if you kick him out,

[05:55] I'm taking my game.

[05:56] And I'm going home with Alice.

[05:57] And the longest line was to play Alice.

[06:00] So that's why I got saved.

[06:01] Rob Burke was nice guy about it, but like damn fix, you know, it wasn't enough.

[06:06] Just trying to get me like, you know, in trouble at work.

[06:09] You got it now.

[06:10] Go like, I can't, I can't, I can't like everyone just like chill out, chill out.

[06:18] I'm allowed to say disparaging things about pinball products.

[06:25] That should not.

[06:26] Get me fired.

[06:27] I am a pinball reviewer, a commentator, a personality.

[06:33] It's crazy, right?

[06:35] Try to get me fired.

[06:37] Almost, almost was successful.

[06:41] Hmm.

[06:43] Ah, call it.

[06:44] Let's see.

[06:44] Let's see what Perry said.

[06:46] And, and again on Facebook for you guys loving Facebook, kick those stars.

[06:52] Oh man.

[06:53] I'm like, look, I'm just, I'm just having a good time.

[06:56] I'm just having a good time.

[06:56] I'm just having a good time.

[06:56] I'm just happy to be alive guys.

[06:58] Seriously.

[07:00] I've, I've lost too many friends way too early.

[07:03] When I think about, you know, when you zoom out a little bit, how many of you raise your

[07:08] hands have lost someone you loved well before their time, right?

[07:13] How many of you have lost loved ones, friends well before their time and, and to hold grudges

[07:20] and pinball and to try to get people fired because they don't like a pinball game.

[07:26] You know, that's why I was so happy to hear Ralph reach out and just be like, it's too short.

[07:30] Like, let's just, let's just like move on.

[07:33] And, and we both make great content.

[07:34] We both do it differently.

[07:36] And it was so great to hear from Ralph.

[07:39] You know, it's just, it's way too short, right?

[07:41] Life, you know?

[07:42] And, and it's crazy to me.

[07:44] I walk into a room and Donald Garrison, I like Don, like, come on, like, let's just

[07:50] bury that.

[07:50] I go to shake his hand and he goes, I don't want none of that.

[07:56] Like, wait, wait, wait, wait, we're, we're in person now.

[08:01] And even though we've said stupid stuff, here we are two grown men and you're a man of God

[08:08] and you reach out to shake someone's hand and just let's, let's move on.

[08:13] And he refused to, that's crazy to me.

[08:17] Like, I don't care how pissed I am at somebody.

[08:21] If they walked up to me and said, Chris, come on, I'm sorry.

[08:24] Like, let's just move on.

[08:25] I'm shaking your hand.

[08:28] Life is way too short.

[08:31] Look at this.

[08:33] Dave Sanders.

[08:33] None of his brothers lived past.

[08:35] Damn, man.

[08:35] I'm sorry.

[08:39] I love that you're still talking about this.

[08:42] Look at this.

[08:43] Who is this guy?

[08:44] Yeah.

[08:44] I'm still talking about it because it's life, brother.

[08:47] So, yeah, I'm, I'm happy to say that retro Ralph and Canada have broken bread and reconciled.

[08:54] Yeah.

[08:55] Okay.

[08:58] Reconciliation, baby.

[08:59] Let's talk about what's going on in pinball right now.

[09:02] All right.

[09:02] So here's the deal.

[09:03] Here's the deal.

[09:04] As I said, we got, we got the next four weeks.

[09:11] Okay.

[09:11] Like, like, pay attention here.

[09:14] It's about to get Star Wars crazy soon.

[09:18] And I think it's going to come out sooner than we think.

[09:22] King Kong sales are not great.

[09:24] And.

[09:25] John Borg and Stern have.

[09:28] They have something big.

[09:32] Something big.

[09:34] Right.

[09:35] And, and like, this is going to be, this is going to be the most important pin for Stern

[09:43] pinball in a long time.

[09:46] The company needs a hit and they're going back to the biggest theme imaginable.

[09:54] We're going to talk predator after this.

[09:57] I wouldn't want to shake your hand, Chris.

[10:00] Too afraid.

[10:01] My lumberjack hands would crush you.

[10:04] Yeah.

[10:04] Um, I, they probably would.

[10:07] I might, my soft little delicate.

[10:10] Crunch gym hands.

[10:12] All I do is make PowerPoint slides all day long.

[10:15] I know it's stupid.

[10:17] It's stupid.

[10:19] I wish there was more handshaking going on in the world.

[10:22] I wish there was more conversation.

[10:24] That was normal.

[10:25] I wish people could not get offended by Sydney Sweeney jeans ads, which I think are great.

[10:30] I think the world has become a strange place.

[10:33] I think a lot of people are acting like they are victims and they're not.

[10:38] I think a lot of people now just want to tear down anybody who has anything nice.

[10:43] I think people out there are jealous.

[10:46] I think they're envious and I think they're lazy.

[10:48] And I think anybody who has something, they want to take it from you.

[10:53] Right.

[10:54] Right.

[10:54] I mean the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing is the worst thing

[11:24] and it's never coming back.

[11:27] And Disney was a bunch of idiots.

[11:29] Other brands were a bunch of idiots.

[11:31] You want to talk to me like just to be a strong man,

[11:34] you're now toxic.

[11:36] Screw that.

[11:38] Canada's not toxic, baby.

[11:40] I'm all about love, but I can love a beautiful woman.

[11:44] I can love a beautiful pinball machine.

[11:46] How's everybody doing?

[11:48] How's everybody shout from the mountaintop,

[11:52] Canada Perry, you know I will, baby.

[11:54] You know I will.

[11:55] Chris, I'm not offended by your money

[11:57] just when you make fun of above ground pools, baby.

[12:02] Look, I know Don's got an above ground pool.

[12:06] It's fine.

[12:06] He's got a pool.

[12:07] I don't even have room for an above ground pool here.

[12:10] I've got like no backyard.

[12:12] Look, it's all just for giggles, people.

[12:15] This is the thing.

[12:17] It's like kale over at Electric Bat.

[12:20] I mean this when I say this.

[12:21] Kale is like my new best bud in pinball

[12:23] because.

[12:24] We literally just every day have so much fun with it.

[12:31] And like it's just like it's crazy, right?

[12:33] It's crazy that anybody wouldn't want to be in that click.

[12:39] So I had a great conversation with Bug and Luke

[12:42] because if you listen to my last show.

[12:46] Bug and Luke.

[12:48] Bug and Luke are and Canada are planning something

[12:52] for the next game launch.

[12:54] And if we work it out, let's just say you're going to want

[12:58] to be a member of the Canada Club.

[13:01] All right.

[13:02] Just going to say it, you know.

[13:05] You know, I know, you know, my friend Ralph got

[13:09] and he should have got he got a Harry Potter C for making

[13:14] the launch content.

[13:18] I think I think we've got something special planned

[13:22] for this new spooky game.

[13:24] By the way, gang, it's like already sold out.

[13:26] So like if you don't have your name on a list

[13:28] and you I don't know what you're doing.

[13:33] When will Kingpin?

[13:34] It's never getting it.

[13:36] Kingpin's never coming back.

[13:38] Kingpin's never coming back.

[13:40] Gang, it's never come back.

[13:41] Christopher Frenchy better than an above septic deck.

[13:45] Frenchy.

[13:47] We like, you know, I love that.

[13:51] Frenchy's doing this next spooky game.

[13:54] And it's just going to be like it's going to be Frenchy's

[13:57] drop the mic moment.

[13:58] Like we know it is like he knows it is like it's just going

[14:01] to be his drop the mic.

[14:04] Most beautiful game that everybody's going to want.

[14:08] That is going to be bolted to everybody's floor.

[14:11] As I said on my show, and I'll say it right now.

[14:15] Spooky's next game with all the accessories around 13 grand.

[14:19] It's going to be an $18,000 game instantly.

[14:22] It's just it's just the way it's going to go.

[14:24] Because we now live in a modern pinball world where.

[14:30] You're only going to want like the masterpieces.

[14:34] I'd rather have one game.

[14:36] I pay 18 for then three mediocre games that are 10.

[14:40] If Beetlejuice is somehow better than Evil Dead, it's going to be better.

[14:45] Sad boy.

[14:46] Thank you again for the 20 bucks.

[14:50] Beetlejuice.

[14:51] Now, look, if they don't have.

[14:54] A microphone in this game where the way to turn it on is say Beetlejuice,

[15:01] Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

[15:02] What are we even doing here?

[15:05] What are we even doing here?

[15:08] Stop putting so much pressure on Frenchie.

[15:11] No, no, no.

[15:12] He's going to kill it.

[15:14] Stop typing Canada.

[15:16] I have no room.

[15:19] Stop lying.

[15:20] Wait, wait.

[15:21] Okay.

[15:22] I I'm trying.

[15:23] Oh, stop.

[15:24] Stop hyping.

[15:25] I don't have my glasses, so I can't see everything perfectly.

[15:29] So work with me here.

[15:31] I'm just wearing my vintage World War Two World War Two aviators with my Japanese leather

[15:39] wrapped around it.

[15:40] This guy does amazing work.

[15:41] These glasses.

[15:41] I love them.

[15:45] Wouldn't a game require power to make a mic work?

[15:50] Yeah, it's true.

[15:52] It's true.

[15:53] All right.

[15:54] So.

[15:54] So you turn it on and then you have to say Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

[15:59] How did you put your name on a list?

[16:01] Okay.

[16:01] I'll tell you how I put my name on a list.

[16:03] I did eleven hundred and eighteen pinball podcasts that puts my name on every single

[16:10] list with every single distributor, with every single manufacturer for the rest of time.

[16:15] But in all in all honesty, get on Joe Newhart's list at pinball star.

[16:24] Get on Mike at automated list.

[16:29] And get on Melissa's list at coin taker.

[16:33] Those are three places to go.

[16:35] They're going to get a lot of games.

[16:37] And yes, as Francie says, coin taker is going to get a lot of these.

[16:42] But get on her list.

[16:44] Call up Melissa.

[16:45] Here's here's here's a recommendation.

[16:48] How about you call Melissa and Chris up and you just introduce yourself and say, hi, how's

[16:53] your day going?

[16:54] How about you build a personal relationship with a distro?

[16:59] That's how the world should work.

[17:02] They can give their allotments to anybody they want.

[17:06] Okay.

[17:06] So let's let's let's let's be honest here for a minute.

[17:09] Right.

[17:09] Because like grown adults now in modern world have forgotten how to act like adults.

[17:14] So if you want to get like on a list or you want to get some privileges, then go earn

[17:20] it.

[17:21] Go earn it.

[17:23] Because.

[17:24] Everyone's got money now.

[17:26] Like, I mean, it's like, look, look, gang.

[17:28] Like I drive around this area of Connecticut, $20 million homes like they just keep going.

[17:35] People have money's not the problem.

[17:37] It's who's got the relationships.

[17:39] Who's got the access.

[17:42] Okay.

[17:43] Build those bridges to your distros.

[17:47] She can give those games to anybody.

[17:49] And when people are like, well, why is Canada get?

[17:51] Well, yeah, because Canada is friends with these people.

[17:54] And when I.

[17:58] Publicize their companies, I'm helping them out.

[18:00] You know, many sales I've sent to these distro friends of mine.

[18:03] A lot.

[18:04] You know how many kickbacks I've gotten?

[18:07] Zero.

[18:08] You know how many special deals I got?

[18:11] Zero.

[18:11] How much I got off retail?

[18:13] Zero.

[18:14] You know, a lot of content creators out there.

[18:16] Hey, they ain't paying full price like Canada.

[18:18] You know, they're saying nice stuff about venom because they didn't buy that venom.

[18:23] Right.

[18:24] At MSRP.

[18:27] Not Canada.

[18:30] Well, I didn't buy venom because I'm smart.

[18:32] Like that.

[18:32] Not an idiot.

[18:33] Like, you know, who bought venom in John Wick?

[18:36] And like, you know, like people who bought D&D, Ali, like just light money on fire.

[18:44] Money is a problem for a lot of people.

[18:46] Lots of.

[18:47] Okay.

[18:48] So, like, the thing about money is this.

[18:51] If you don't have money.

[18:54] You should not be buying any new inbox pinball machines.

[18:59] And I mean that.

[19:00] Like, if you only have like 50K in the bank and put that in the S&P 500, you know, buy

[19:08] $5,000 of Ferrari stock.

[19:10] You know, don't don't don't buy a pinball machine.

[19:14] Nobody's buying $20 million homes by getting on pinball distro so they can get a game.

[19:22] John, I love you.

[19:24] I think about you daily.

[19:26] I can't wait to see you again.

[19:29] We got you got to bring bring the bring the kids.

[19:34] Bring.

[19:36] Are there two kids, John?

[19:38] Now or just still one?

[19:39] My memory is going foggy.

[19:42] You got to come up to Connecticut.

[19:46] I know, John.

[19:49] Let's see here.

[19:50] Hold on.

[19:52] Who doesn't love?

[19:54] To play with the stock certificate.

[19:57] Money is a problem for a lot of.

[19:59] OK.

[20:00] How's everybody doing?

[20:01] Where's Pete Rosen at?

[20:06] Retro Ralph and Canada.

[20:11] It's just too sweet, right?

[20:13] I know everybody wanted to see the reconciliation.

[20:16] I know it makes everybody happy.

[20:18] I told Ralph, you know, God, don't ever apologize.

[20:21] Don't ever defend your honor on pin side.

[20:24] These cargo short wearing mofos.

[20:27] Are you kidding me?

[20:29] Who cares what anybody says about you on pin side?

[20:34] Imagine walking into a bar and be like, yo, man, someone just thumbs down me on pin side.

[20:40] Like the like a chick would throw a beer in your face.

[20:44] They should be like, grow up, bro.

[20:45] What are you doing on pin side?

[20:48] Some of these dudes have 30,000 posts.

[20:51] Think about that for a minute.

[20:52] 30,000 posts.

[20:54] On pin side.

[20:56] Like what?

[20:58] What?

[20:59] You know, one day they're going to wake up and realize what a waste.

[21:03] What a waste.

[21:04] All that effort was.

[21:06] Do you have a hall pass?

[21:08] I love Sidney Sweeney, by the way, man.

[21:10] It's like, you know, like my whole company is offended by that ad.

[21:14] And I was like, yo, can I get everybody's addresses so I can send every woman who works at this company a pair of American Eagle jeans for Christmas?

[21:21] Like what's wrong with people?

[21:24] Like, you know, seriously, she's so hot.

[21:28] Like I tell Brenda, like, damn, damn.

[21:31] Remember the end in a Cole Smith?

[21:34] Those ads back in the day.

[21:38] You got to love it.

[21:39] You got to love how woke culture tries to like.

[21:43] Tries to act like like hot women can't be hot women anymore and like all women are hot.

[21:51] It's not true.

[21:52] It's like saying all guys are handsome.

[21:53] That's not true either.

[21:56] I love it.

[21:57] I love it, man.

[21:59] Even like talking about this stuff, right?

[22:00] You're like, oh, man, the Internet's going to come for you.

[22:07] Oh, man, I think I need a Jaws 50th.

[22:10] I, you know, look.

[22:11] Oh, is it guest jeans ads?

[22:13] It was Anna Nicole Smith.

[22:14] OK, no, but like they would they would try to cancel Cindy Crawford's Pepsi commercial from the Super Bowl.

[22:19] Remember that when she got out of the the Lamborghini?

[22:23] Was it?

[22:24] And just seductively drank a Pepsi.

[22:28] Think about that ad today.

[22:30] What this mob would try to do.

[22:32] And, you know, it's funny is the funny thing about the woke mob.

[22:37] And it's the far left.

[22:38] It's the fringe of the far left is the more they do it, the more they're never going to win an election ever again at the top level.

[22:46] So it's like and again, I'm not I'm not some crazy MAGA conservative guys.

[22:51] You know me.

[22:51] I'm very moderate.

[22:52] Socially.

[22:53] Liberally.

[22:53] Fiscally conservative.

[22:54] I just love watching the political scene and how triggered it makes people because I think it's ridiculous.

[23:01] I don't think politics should make anybody upset.

[23:04] And I actually just think what's healthy is discourse.

[23:08] And this is the part that kills me is there's no discourse.

[23:12] You can't talk about stuff.

[23:15] I try to talk.

[23:16] I mean, I work in marketing and I can't even talk about that ad at work.

[23:21] Because.

[23:23] Nobody would agree with me.

[23:26] And my only point is I don't I just don't find it offensive.

[23:29] I think make I think finding it offensive is making it offensive.

[23:34] It's like a weird world we live in now, gang.

[23:37] So I just shut up because I have the biggest bullseye on my back.

[23:42] I do.

[23:43] I know it.

[23:44] I know it.

[23:45] You're not allowed to be a bro in 2025.

[23:48] Like, even though the majority of the brands I work on are targeting me.

[23:53] My age.

[23:54] And I just mean, like, you're a man, 40 to 60.

[23:56] That's it.

[23:57] I don't care about the color of your skin.

[23:59] Like, we're trying to sell beer, cookies, cars.

[24:02] You know, it's like it's it's it's crazy.

[24:06] Once.

[24:07] OK, anyway, should we talk pinball?

[24:13] You know, it's nuts as my dad worked in that building where the where the shots happened,

[24:18] where the people were killed.

[24:19] 345 Park Avenue.

[24:21] That was the old headquarters.

[24:23] Of where my father worked at Bristol Myers Squibb.

[24:26] He worked in that building for 38 years.

[24:28] I went into that building so many times as a kid.

[24:31] My dad worked on the 45th floor.

[24:35] Absolutely.

[24:36] A crazy random act of violence sucks like horrible.

[24:41] Like someone I work with knew one of the victims.

[24:43] Again, it's why when we talk about life is short and we talk about pinball prices and

[24:48] the things we mope about, like in the end, you zoom out a little bit, you keep zooming

[24:52] out and you just.

[24:53] Happy to be alive.

[24:54] Happy to be alive in a time when Retro Ralph and Canada are buds again.

[24:58] Happy to be alive in a time when there's air conditioning.

[25:01] Happy to be alive in a time when there's a Dodge Demon.

[25:04] Happy to be alive when there's a 14 pinball companies.

[25:07] Happy to be alive.

[25:08] Just be happy to be alive.

[25:10] Just look at what you have.

[25:12] And you always do this.

[25:13] Do this exercise.

[25:14] If you write down on a piece of paper, I'm glad I'm not.

[25:19] You will walk away happy.

[25:22] Because there's so.

[25:22] Many things that can make life worse.

[25:26] Like $15,000 pinball machines.

[25:31] All right.

[25:31] So let's talk about Star Wars.

[25:34] Now, do you guys think it's episodes four through six?

[25:39] How many of you in comments right now?

[25:41] How many of you right now think it's episode four through six?

[25:47] John Borg's next game coming out end of August, early September.

[25:50] How many of you?

[25:52] I'm glad my pool isn't below ground.

[25:55] That's amazing.

[25:58] I think it's based on planet Hoth.

[26:05] Okay.

[26:07] How many of you think it's Star Wars episode four through six?

[26:13] So, okay.

[26:14] So Chan says it has to be.

[26:15] They need the money.

[26:16] I.

[26:19] Man, but I heard it was one through three at the beginning.

[26:22] Darth Maul.

[26:23] I mean, Maul has a new TV show, I think, coming.

[26:27] I just think any, any game where that Star Wars theme song hits.

[26:35] Is going to crush.

[26:37] John Borg.

[26:41] I, you know, they've got all the assets.

[26:44] What do you think will happen to prices on Richie's version?

[26:48] Yeah.

[26:48] Richie's version is terrible.

[26:50] I hate.

[26:52] I don't use the word hate a lot.

[26:54] I hate that game because I love Star Wars.

[26:57] I think Richie's Star Wars is.

[27:00] It is an abomination of the theme.

[27:04] I think the shots are too difficult.

[27:08] I think the lack of magic and the toys is pathetic.

[27:12] I think the tie fighter on a spring is beyond pathetic.

[27:16] And I think Dwight just destroyed that game.

[27:18] The stacking of the modes.

[27:20] Stacking movie scenes on top of each other is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

[27:26] You have the greatest storyline of all time.

[27:29] And they messed it up.

[27:31] I hate that game.

[27:32] I don't understand anyone who would own it.

[27:36] They sold like 8,000 of them.

[27:38] But it's, it's a terrible integration of Star Wars in the pinball format.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] 

[27:43] 

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:43] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:44] Yeah.

[27:45] Yeah.

[27:45] Yeah.

[27:45] Yeah.

[27:46] Yeah.

[27:46] Yeah.

[27:47] Yeah.

[27:47] Yeah.

[27:48] Yeah.

[27:49] Yeah.

[27:50] Yeah.

[27:50] 

[27:50] Yeah.

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] 

[27:50] Well, they're going to use the video assets again.

[27:53] Just don't stack them in a stupid way.

[27:56] It's just, it also like the height, the whole, like making the hyper, you know why?

[28:01] Because gang, that game is a reskin.

[28:04] He was supposed to make Jurassic Park and the hyperdrive mech was, was supposed to be

[28:11] the Raptors running around the park.

[28:14] Makes more sense, right?

[28:16] What, why would the hyperdrive be the main toy in Star Wars?

[28:24] Like that is the dumbest thing.

[28:26] I like, it's such a small little part of that trilogy.

[28:37] It's going to be seven through nine, like all the Disney park stuff.

[28:43] Oh, force awakens.

[28:46] No.

[28:46] No, man.

[28:47] I don't, you know, it was crazy, man.

[28:48] I, I almost like forget those new movies even came out.

[28:52] Hey, you're right.

[28:53] Like force awakens.

[28:55] Like there's something about those films.

[28:58] They, they did not leave an indelible impression at all, at all.

[29:06] Hyperdrive, hyperdrive.

[29:12] All right.

[29:13] So someone wants to talk about predator.

[29:15] Let's talk.

[29:16] Let's talk about it.

[29:17] Here's my thoughts on predator.

[29:22] Here's how many games I think they're going to sell.

[29:28] Here's my thoughts on how they released the game.

[29:34] Any other questions about predator?

[29:37] It's like $15,000 to your door.

[29:44] I mean, it's here.

[29:45] It's like.

[29:46] I mean, I don't, I don't understand.

[29:59] Like you can't make predator without Arnold.

[30:01] They should have made something else.

[30:04] It's that simple.

[30:09] I'm going to go get another cup of coffee.

[30:11] Hold on guys.

[30:11] Energy levels are fading.

[30:13] I love this show.

[30:14] Beautiful out though.

[30:15] I got to go to the beach.

[30:16] Take a break.

[30:16] Take the demon out.

[30:17] Oh, I don't know how much I drank last night.

[30:29] Oh.

[30:30] Oh.

[30:31] Oh.

[30:32] Oh.

[30:33] Oh.

[30:34] Oh.

[30:35] Oh.

[30:36] Oh.

[30:37] Oh.

[30:38] Oh.

[30:39] Oh.

[30:40] Oh.

[30:41] Oh.

[30:42] Oh.

[30:43] Oh.

[30:44] Oh.

[30:46] Oh.

[30:47] 

[30:47] Oh.

[30:47] 

[30:47] 

[30:47] Oh.

[30:48] 

[30:48] 

[30:48] Oh.

[30:48] Oh.

[30:48] Oh.

[30:48] 

[30:48] Oh.

[30:48] Oh.

[30:49] 

[30:49] 

[30:49] Oh.

[30:49] 

[30:49] Oh.

[30:49] Oh.

[30:49] 

[30:49] 

[30:49] Oh.

[30:49] 

[30:49] Oh.

[30:49] Oh.

[30:50] Oh.

[30:50] 

[30:50] Oh.

[30:50] Oh.

[30:50] 

[30:50] Oh.

[30:50] There's nothing better than being hung over and happy.

[30:57] 

[30:57] 

[30:57] 

[30:57] 

[30:57] there, baby.

[31:00] I could probably make more

[31:01] money on OnlyFans. That's what Brenda tells me.

[31:03] She's like, you can get on OnlyFans and make more

[31:05] money than pinball podcasting.

[31:10] How's everybody

[31:11] doing?

[31:14] Yeah, my

[31:15] dad's like, you maybe shouldn't drink so much.

[31:17] I was telling him this story how

[31:19] I was

[31:22] picking up

[31:25] for Brenda's...

[31:27] Was it her birthday? No, it was for Christmas.

[31:31] We've got bills. We've got daycare.

[31:36] I got

[31:37] her a couple bracelets from Tiffany's

[31:39] and I only wanted to spend a certain

[31:41] amount of money. I was like, all right. I didn't want to

[31:43] go extravagant because that's always what I'm known

[31:45] for. I just go extravagant with my wife

[31:47] because I love her to death.

[31:52] I want to say

[31:53] I don't know.

[31:54] I spent like four

[31:57] or five hundred bucks on two bracelets or something

[31:59] and we were going to go

[32:01] I think

[32:03] get them sized. Pick

[32:05] them up and get the right size

[32:06] from Tiffany's and we

[32:09] go to lunch beforehand

[32:10] in Westport, Connecticut

[32:12] and I had a few espresso

[32:14] martinis.

[32:16] It's what I do.

[32:18] It's how I roll during the holidays.

[32:24] It's not

[32:25] a good idea to have a few espresso

[32:26] martinis.

[32:27] It's not a good idea to have a few espresso martinis

[32:27] before you go into a jewelry store.

[32:30] I did.

[32:35] Because when you do that,

[32:39] then those diamond bracelets

[32:40] look real good.

[32:43] You know what? They look really good

[32:44] on a beautiful

[32:47] Irish rose's wrist.

[32:50] I'm like,

[32:50] oh man, that looks great on you, Brenda.

[32:52] How much?

[32:53] I don't want to tell you

[32:55] how much.

[32:57] More than any pinball machine costs.

[33:00] And then I'm like, alright,

[33:01] yeah, cool.

[33:03] Let's take it.

[33:05] That's how Kaneda rolls.

[33:09] And you wake up the next day and you're like, oh man,

[33:12] what happened?

[33:15] I'll tell you what happened. Your wife

[33:17] is happily married. I think so.

[33:19] She's with the kids right now. They're at some

[33:20] play date with another kid.

[33:23] Look, I

[33:24] I've spent

[33:27] more money on my wife than I will

[33:28] ever spend on pinball machines.

[33:32] Brenda is

[33:33] a super limited

[33:34] addition. She is a

[33:37] one of one. She

[33:38] is so beautiful, so

[33:41] lovely. I

[33:42] worship my wife.

[33:45] Now she wouldn't

[33:45] she would tell you all the things I don't

[33:49] do.

[33:51] But I worship her.

[33:53] You know, in these wealthy

[33:55] towns, I tell you, I meet a lot of people.

[33:56] Divorce

[33:57] on their third marriages.

[34:00] I'm like, man, I'm glad I waited

[34:02] and got everything else out of

[34:04] my system, because I'm like, I don't even

[34:06] understand, like, why did

[34:08] y'all get married? I mean, like, I understand

[34:10] like, people get married at different

[34:12] ages, every, like, everything happens

[34:14] for a reason, but I worship

[34:16] Brenda.

[34:19] I love

[34:20] worshiping her.

[34:23] I love, anyway,

[34:25] but this is not the Brenda podcast,

[34:26] stop trying to get lucky later yeah no it's not gonna work it never works

[34:31] um all right so predator dead on arrival let's talk about dune let's talk let's give a shout

[35:59] jamie yesterday he's signing back up look the thing is this look i'm not going to go into all

[36:06] the details about this but jamie was mad at me because i wasn't happy with how they launched

[36:13] dune that's why he canceled my show in talking to jamie yesterday he's like dude you were

[36:22] right like you were right like everything you said about barrels like you were right

[36:26] so that's why he's signing back up and i'm like look bro i i understand like why you got upset

[36:32] but just remember like i i am not worth the money if i was wrong all the time right people would not

[36:42] subscribe to my show or tune in here if what i say about pinball and the companies is inaccurate

[36:50] right

[36:52] sure i don't always get every rumor right but in the end i think i called it like i see it like i'm

[36:58] calling it harry potter's a hit it's going to be a hit game for jersey jack i don't love the way

[37:04] it's coded i hope they balance it better i hope they let more of the movie come through

[37:10] you know when i see these billion score games that people are putting up i i i worry that the

[37:17] game doesn't have enough moments of wow it's but it is fun to shoot and

[37:22] maybe see the thing about jersey jack games it's tricky because the wow is just in how it's

[37:28] presented and the way a jersey jack game presents itself to you as a player is a wow you know and

[37:37] like gnr has the wow factor but it doesn't shoot great harry potter's got the wow factor and it

[37:43] shoots great that like that that that's like two plus two equals four you know it's it's a banger

[37:49] it's a banger hit for them

[37:52] okay let's see i put an hour on dune loved it but needs more code yep i think you can buy one but

[38:03] you can't actually get one anytime soon yep that's true too what would be potter be worth if they only

[38:09] made a thousand okay good question um rick asks what would harry potter ce be worth if they only

[38:15] made a thousand ces um

[38:22] twenty thousand dollars

[38:29] i i think that's kind of what that would be the twenty grand would be the price

[38:37] it would go up five thousand dollars in value do you think walking dead remastered

[38:46] uh is happening um

[38:49] ah

[39:03] 

[39:03] 

[39:03] 

[39:03] 

[39:03] 

[39:03] the

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19]

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:19] 

[39:22] code drop? I think it dropped like yesterday, right? Or two days ago. There's a lot of call

[39:27] outs. There's a lot of, um, there's a lot of voice actor work in it. So, um, yesterday. Okay.

[39:34] That's what I thought. All right. So David does, does Mike get automated, have a dune yet?

[39:43] Because that's my closest. I mean, like the, the, the thing is, this is David should just

[39:50] send one to Canada. I'll send it back, bro. But David, I mean, it doesn't, it wouldn't hurt

[39:58] to have Canada with a dune on loan to play the game and be able to review it.

[40:07] And cause think about like, even if just, even if just like half of my audience

[40:14] buys one, you're sold out.

[40:20] Kale Hernandez, kale, baby. I want to thank kale for brokering the reconciliation with Ralph.

[40:29] It's because of kale that Ralph gave me a call and we buried the hatchet yesterday. Kale,

[40:35] can you, can you do a little victory lap? Can we all say what's up kale at electric bat? The only

[40:42] man, the only man to dethrone Canada for favorite pinball podcast. Even though I did get almost a

[40:50] hundred more first place.

[40:50] And the way that woke system beat me, we joke about it every day. Not sure how I lost Colin.

[40:57] Never, never released this second and third place vote stats. So like I lost, but kale one,

[41:05] and I couldn't have lost to a better guy. And he's amazing. He's in here too. He's celebrating.

[41:11] He's been poolside with the wife. He's he's living. We're living the life, baby. Sad boy.

[41:17] No offense, but dune is, Oh man.

[41:20] Horrendous. And the pain box is quite possibly one of the worst features in a pinball machine ever.

[41:27] No BS. Damn. Damn. David, are you going to take that from sad boy? You're going to donate more

[41:33] money. Sad boy. Like, like it's not horrendous. Isn't the pain box when you play with one hand,

[41:41] why? I love that. I actually liked that feature. I'm not going to heart this. I'll take your 10

[41:48] bucks, but I'm not going to heart this. But I,

[41:50] you know, I want this to be an, an open discourse. Um, Rachel, look, Rachel is

[41:59] kale's Brenda. He worships Rachel and Rachel is amazing. And it's the, it's the Rachel and kale.

[42:08] They have such a good back. Like I, I envy you guys. Cause you get to wake up and do what you

[42:12] love every day. I mean, Brennan and I still have to go work for other people, but you two,

[42:16] we're going to open up electric bat East coast.

[42:20] Brenda and Canada that, that are like running it. And we should do it with special guests. Ralph

[42:26] retro Ralph. Yeah. Kale's Brenda. Oh man.

[42:37] Let's see. We don't work a day in our lives. Nope. When you do, when you love what you do for a

[42:43] living, that's the way to do it. Oh, I, you know, the problem is kale. I, you know, living in this

[42:49] expensive part of the country, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.

[42:50] You sometimes have to like work a day, day or day or a thousand. Right. Um, but no, thank you for,

[42:59] for making, um, for making that reconciliation happen. It's been a, it's been a great 24 hours.

[43:05] I'm having Ralph back and, um, you know, look, miracles do happen. You know, I, I've,

[43:11] I would love it if, if Don and Canada would bury the hatchet. I've said it many times, you know,

[43:16] there's, there's nobody wants to be into any content creator drama. Like there really isn't,

[43:20] I feel like the only drama left is Canada and Don. And that's, that's not on my side of the

[43:27] fence. You know that I tried to shake the man's hand. I tried to bury the hatchet. He just won't,

[43:30] you know why he won't do it. And it's a sad reason why he feels that he will lose respect

[43:38] from his followers if he does. And that's sad because it's sad that the pressure is on him to

[43:46] stay angry and to stay.

[43:50] Bide it. That's sad to me. Don be the bigger man, man. Don't care about those people will still

[43:57] follow you. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Kale's going to do it. Kale already Kale solved it with Ralph.

[44:10] He can solve it with Don. I, we got the right guy on it. You know, you know, it's funny is yesterday.

[44:17] Uh, and, and I don't know if Jamie's here right now. I don't think so,

[44:20] but I don't know if he's here right now. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.

[44:20] But like, you know, Jamie's texting me. He's like, ah, he gets all, he gets, you know,

[44:24] Jamie gets like upset at times and I just call him up. Cause you know, cause I think he called

[44:30] me bipolar and I'm like, bro, I'm not bipolar, man. Like it's everything we're doing is orchestrated

[44:36] and meant for entertainment sake. And he's like, yeah, yeah, you're right. He's like, you're right.

[44:40] You're right. He's like, he's like, damn it. You know, Jamie's like, he like wants to hate me.

[44:45] And then we have a phone call. He's like, I get it. Like, you're right, man. You're right.

[44:49] It's like, Jamie just needs me to tell him to man up is the thing. And then when you do,

[44:56] he's like, he's like, you're right. You're right. You're right. Right.

[45:00] Um, I'm excited to play Dune someday. Uh, it's a short

[45:06] saving your ball. It's not a certain. Okay. Do you agree with Don's list of Stern's next six titles?

[45:14] Uh, I haven't Pete Rosen. What, what, what are, uh, what, what, where's Don's list

[45:19] of Stern's next six titles? Does he, he knows all next six. Okay. Put, put, put, put them up here,

[45:26] Pete. Let's see. Let's, let's talk about it. Um, I, let me, let me guess what I think Stern has.

[45:33] I think star Wars Pokemon. I do think fallouts coming. I think walking dead. Uh, I think

[45:42] super Mario brothers will be a stern game.

[45:49] All right. One is star Wars. Great. That's, that's nothing new. I want to see if there's

[45:54] anything on Don's list that we haven't already talked about. So we know, we know about star Wars.

[46:02] What else? What's number two walking dead. We knew that. Okay. Nothing new. Nothing new there.

[46:14] Okay. What else? Pete? I don't know why it's taking you so long. Pokemon. Okay. Nothing new there.

[46:19] Now the next three will be the interesting ones because we knew all those transformers.

[46:30] Okay. That's interesting.

[46:36] Fallout. We knew about, which is going to be terrible.

[46:39] Okay.

[46:39] ACDC again.

[46:48] Okay.

[46:49] Is it, I mean, the only one that's like interesting is obviously transformers, but you know, I, I, yeah, I mean, I think what makes me nervous now is like, who's doing transformers are probably Brian, Eddie.

[47:19] Yeah.

[47:19] I mean the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing the first thing

[47:49] I bought a kitchen table

[47:53] I bought

[47:54] Jonathan Adler

[47:56] furniture

[47:57] and I don't regret it

[48:01] yeah so

[48:02] George Gomez might be doing the Transformers huh

[48:04] I don't know

[48:07] doesn't it feel like Stern's out of ideas

[48:09] Fallout's gonna just bomb

[48:12] like they

[48:13] I don't even know who's buying that

[48:15] they might as well

[48:18] only offer it to Dingleberries

[48:19] that bought Venom and John Wick

[48:21] like talk about Dingleberries

[48:23] like who bought a John Wick

[48:26] or Venom LE

[48:26] like new in box

[48:28] you ever think about that

[48:30] I mean I don't mean to be mean but I'll be mean a little bit

[48:33] what moron

[48:34] how much of a moron did you have to be

[48:37] and I'm sorry if you bought it

[48:38] just take this with a grain of salt

[48:40] but how much of a moron

[48:43] did you have to be to buy John Wick

[48:44] or Venom LE

[48:46] at $13,000

[48:48] I mean seriously think about it

[48:50] yeah you know why

[48:53] you know why you're making money Kale

[48:54] because often times

[48:57] it's the games that nobody wants to own

[48:59] that they'll play a lot on location

[49:01] it's an interesting

[49:03] phenomenon

[49:04] like you get the curiosity

[49:07] quarters is what I call it

[49:08] you'll make more money with curiosity

[49:11] quarters than you will

[49:13] on a game that everyone owns at home

[49:15] because they're not going to go out and play it

[49:18] it's true

[49:19] I'm a smart guy

[49:21] I went to boarding school

[49:22] I went to private middle school

[49:24] you can't beat my intelligence

[49:27] the only thing I'm stupid with

[49:29] is how I spend my free time making pinball content

[49:33] it's not smart

[49:34] it's not smart

[49:35] I should have done something else

[49:37] I would be making a lot more money

[49:43] you hear my haircut right

[49:45] no Pete my mom

[49:46] I saw my mom this morning

[49:47] she once again said that I was stupid

[49:47] she once again said that I hated my haircut

[49:49] what are you doing

[49:50] you're absolutely embarrassing yourself

[49:52] it's my mother talking

[49:54] so the thing is

[50:00] the thing is this

[50:03] I'm annoyed that Guns N' Roses is not coded better

[50:09] the November Rain light show doesn't alter throughout the song

[50:14] it's still annoying me

[50:15] I didn't realize it

[50:16] for the first time I played through the whole song

[50:17] I thought it would have like a dramatic ending

[50:19] I thought when Slash's guitar solos would come in

[50:22] the game would alter

[50:23] no it's just it just loops for 10 minutes the same light show

[50:35] look we got David Van Ness

[50:37] we've got Christopher Franchi

[50:39] someone go tell Retro Ralph to join

[50:42] come on

[50:43] does anyone have Ralph's like

[50:44] I can't because I'm on Facebook right now but I'm gonna go to Facebook and see if I can find him

[50:45] I can't because I'm on Facebook right now but I'm gonna go to Facebook and see if I can find him

[50:46] I'm on Facebook right now

[50:47] I'm on Facebook right now

[50:48] but someone go tell Ralph the pop in and say hi

[50:49] 

[50:49] but someone go tell Ralph the pop in and say hi

[50:50] can someone do that

[50:51] who's got who's got Ralph's personal

[50:52] Ralph's personal. Let's get him in here. He used to hang out here. Anyone can someone who's going

[51:03] to do that? You're going to do it. Go text him. I don't know. I think Stern's in trouble, gang.

[51:12] I think Stern's in big trouble. I think they blew up their collector community and I think they're

[51:17] not going to get it back. And I think they don't know what to do. And I think they allowed too many

[51:22] of these other companies to gain too much momentum and too much enthusiasm. And I think the other

[51:28] companies have done a better job of creating more of a family vibe. I think Jack being head of

[51:33] community, Jack Danger, is a good move. I think it's an important move because I think they realize

[51:40] if we don't win over the people, we're not going to win over the profit. And we're not going to win

[51:46] this anymore.

[51:47] Can't just keep shoving these games at distros. Because Stern's biggest problem is they acted

[51:53] like the distros are their customers and that's all they cared about. And they burned the distros.

[51:59] They let too many distros in. They let too many dealers sign up. And that's what led to 1,000

[52:04] LEs. If anyone thinks it's anything other than that, they're wrong. The reason why there's 1,000

[52:08] LEs is not because there's demand for it. It's because Stern signed up way too many dealers and

[52:14] distros and now just wants to thin out the alley.

[52:17] And it didn't work. And they've left a lot of people stockpiled with inventory. They've got

[52:26] inventory stockpiled through the roof. And the dam's going to break. And Costco deals are not

[52:35] going to save them. They need to return to what made their formula work. And I don't think they

[52:43] are.

[52:47] i mean look i i i hearing that list of games acdc with a screen they're they're gonna do it

[52:58] stern is absolutely gonna remake all of the dmd classics with spike 3

[53:07] and they're gonna charge you thirteen thousand dollars for a game that was one six

[53:11] you gotta think about the the the inaneness of that and that's what they're gonna do

[53:17] i'm here late what's up robert there are zero facebook stars pete rosen are we are we doing this

[53:25] my main man i haven't said your name with a contribution yet that i usually hit at the end

[55:17] 

[55:17] 

[55:17] 

[55:17] 

[55:47] The more I ask, the less you give.

[55:48] It's amazing.

[55:50] A lot of pinball here this morning.

[55:53] Very cool.

[55:53] Yeah, no, it's great.

[55:54] Dude, it's always fun.

[55:56] Like we got spooky.

[55:57] Look, we got spooky Luke here.

[55:58] We got Christopher Franchi.

[55:59] We got David Van Ness.

[56:01] We've got Kale Electric Bat.

[56:03] You know, we got 90 people on YouTube.

[56:07] We've got 13 on Facebook.

[56:10] It's just a good, it's a good crew.

[56:11] Look, and in the summer times, it definitely thins out.

[56:15] But 50 bucks, just tell us Richie's next game.

[56:18] Oh my God, this guy's amazing.

[56:20] All right, let me give you, I'll just give you a hint.

[56:39] It's a game where speed.

[56:45] Is part of the story, if you will.

[56:57] I mean, I feel like every game Richie makes has speed attached to it.

[57:06] Thank you.

[57:07] All right, you blew your busking chances when you blabbed about going to the jewelry store.

[57:13] I know, I know, I know.

[57:15] Didn't I?

[57:16] It's like, give me money.

[57:17] And I'm like buying Brenda expensive jewelry.

[57:19] But look, look, I, you know, I appreciate every dollar that you guys donate to the show.

[57:26] I, you, you know, the hard work that goes into it.

[57:29] I don't even have to tell you the hard work that goes into it.

[57:31] And look, and you get, I love it when like, you know, Carrie Hardy has been like, oh,

[57:35] there's other, Carrie, Carrie.

[57:38] You know, I think a lot of, I think a lot of content creators are struggling right now

[57:43] to make entertaining shows.

[57:45] Cause they, they, they need pinball news.

[57:47] And as Kayle and I always say, pinball news is stupid.

[57:50] Like that's not what makes it fun.

[57:52] You tune into Canada's pinball podcast.

[57:53] Cause we talk and we make it entertaining every day.

[57:57] It doesn't matter.

[57:58] There's only like five real news days a year in pinball.

[58:01] Like, but it's the commentary.

[58:03] It's what's going on this week.

[58:05] You know, you got to read pin side.

[58:07] You got to stay in involved in the hobby.

[58:11] What John, what did John say?

[58:15] Hmm.

[58:16] Top gun.

[58:17] I don't know.

[58:20] Sandra Bullock speed.

[58:22] Why not?

[58:27] Todd Tucky's on Facebook right now.

[58:29] Todd, get the YouTube brother.

[58:30] Are you on YouTube, Todd?

[58:33] I think YouTube's where it's at.

[58:35] I mean, more people prefer YouTube.

[58:37] I'm just doing it on.

[58:37] The only reason I'm doing this on Facebook is because the rewatches on Facebook are huge,

[58:43] huge.

[58:44] Like for example, I'm doing this on Facebook.

[58:44] I'm doing this on Facebook.

[58:44] I'm doing this on Facebook.

[58:44] I'm doing this on Facebook.

[58:44] I'm doing this on Facebook.

[58:44] I'm doing this on Facebook.

[58:45] For some reason now, the algorithms, like 4,000 people are now watching these videos.

[58:49] I'm not sure if they want to be watching, but they are.

[58:53] It's 11 o'clock.

[58:54] Let's do this for like 10 more minutes because it's so nice outside and I want to go improve

[58:59] my tan.

[59:01] It's so freaking nice out.

[59:05] Ah, how's everybody doing?

[59:07] Yeah, look, there is a little bit of a lull going on in pinball, but it's going to pick

[59:12] up real fast.

[59:13] And I think it's good because I think a lot of people are going to be like, oh, I'm not

[59:14] going to be able to do this.

[59:14] I think a lot of us are traveling.

[59:16] We're spending money.

[59:17] It's the summertime.

[59:19] I don't know is the yes of someone under NDA.

[59:25] No, it's not.

[59:28] You learn life lessons on this channel.

[59:30] Well, I, you know, I mean, I don't know if we're learning.

[59:35] I think we're all learning as we go.

[59:38] Life is really crazy right now for, for a lot of reasons.

[59:41] You know, the world is a crazy place.

[59:43] It's, it's, it's crazy that you can, we live in a world where there's so much to be thankful

[59:51] for, yet there's so much anger and hate and atrocities still happening in the world.

[01:00:01] That is mind boggling.

[01:00:02] As the world gets smaller, I can't, you know, it's like, I mean, who knows what the answer

[01:00:07] is, right?

[01:00:07] It's like, look at Russia.

[01:00:10] Like what happened to Russia?

[01:00:13] We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,

[01:00:13] they, they, they turned the corner and then they went right back and the, and then the

[01:00:18] world just stood by and let it happen.

[01:00:21] What?

[01:00:22] What's happening in the Middle East?

[01:00:24] What's happening?

[01:00:25] You know, I, you know, I, I, I, I, I, half my friends are Jewish.

[01:00:32] I mean, I'm just going to say it like the, the, the amount of modern day antisemitism

[01:00:37] in here is ridiculous.

[01:00:38] Like what?

[01:00:40] Again, and then these are very complicated situations.

[01:00:43] I do not pretend to have a full understanding of foreign affairs in some of these situations that are thousands of years in the making.

[01:00:52] But, man, I just hope for all of our children's world that a few things happen, that like the hate and the anger dissipates, that social media does not ruin the next generation for life.

[01:01:07] I'm worried about Gen Z.

[01:01:09] I think Gen Alpha and Gen Beta are going to be fine.

[01:01:11] I think Gen Z, for some reason, they just got the worst period of it all.

[01:01:18] And they don't know how to climb out of it.

[01:01:21] They really don't.

[01:01:23] When a jeans ad is upsetting you, something's wrong.

[01:01:28] You don't know how to handle what life is going to throw at you.

[01:01:35] What did you mean?

[01:01:38] Enzo.

[01:01:40] Can I ask you guys?

[01:01:41] I have a question.

[01:01:41] Aren't there just like certain games that like it doesn't even feel like they even came out?

[01:01:48] Games like Avatar, right?

[01:01:51] Think about it.

[01:01:52] Like, have you ever heard anybody like talk about Avatar?

[01:01:57] Like, I, nope.

[01:02:00] Like, oh, there's this moment in Avatar pinball where, nope, no one ever said that ever.

[01:02:08] It doesn't feel like it came out, right?

[01:02:09] What are the games that are like that?

[01:02:11] What are the games like they came out, but did anyone really pay attention?

[01:02:18] Ninja Eclipse?

[01:02:22] Talk about bringing down the room.

[01:02:25] I know.

[01:02:31] Spinal tap.

[01:02:32] Yeah, man.

[01:02:34] Is it out?

[01:02:35] Is spinal tap out?

[01:02:38] Is it like it is that like?

[01:02:41] I feel like.

[01:02:41] Queen.

[01:02:41] Queen is like that, too, right?

[01:02:45] Oh, damn.

[01:02:46] Pinball Palace.

[01:02:48] Throwing Dune in that list.

[01:02:49] Damn it.

[01:02:50] Dune just came out.

[01:02:51] We can't.

[01:02:52] We can't.

[01:02:54] David, how many dunes have shipped?

[01:02:56] We've got David here.

[01:02:57] How many dunes have gone out the door so far?

[01:03:01] I don't know.

[01:03:11] I don't know the entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire

[01:03:41] want to talk about right now maybe there's a few more minutes then i'm gonna go enjoy the sun and

[01:03:45] the beach i think kong is going to be ellen's worst selling cornerstone um

[01:03:52] do you think kong is going to sell worse than avengers

[01:03:57] you might be right i think i actually think avengers is a better game than king kong i think

[01:04:03] it's a better shooter kong is not bad it's just the problem with kong is like it's not bad but

[01:04:12] it's not great and that's the problem with kong you know what it is too about king kong is you

[01:04:21] just you just really don't want to own it you know i i like i i i think it's a good shooting game

[01:04:29] but there's nothing about king kong that makes me want to own it and again

[01:04:33] the fact that they made the le look exactly like the premium and the pro it's like f off stern

[01:04:38] just f off and you know i don't often tell stern to f off but come on what what lazy ass shit is

[01:04:45] that i don't mean to curse but i just cursed you're gonna try to sell me a thirteen thousand

[01:04:49] dollar product that looks exactly like the six thousand dollar product how come on jeremy packer

[01:04:55] you're the head of art now you need to make better decisions

[01:05:00] they they you can't make

[01:05:03] the base level look as good as the top of the line like it's just stupid like that is that is

[01:05:10] terrible marketing and that is a marketing decision they should have just had the kong

[01:05:15] logo on the pro just put the logo sandbag it

[01:05:18] so you just you don't you don't want to own it you can't even get 11 for a kong le now

[01:05:32] in a box

[01:05:33] not even open

[01:05:38] the problem with kong is i'm not emotionally invested in the theme because story i'm not

[01:05:42] yeah like

[01:05:44] the kong has a lot of problems in that department

[01:05:48] and what's what's kind of sucks is kong is a very emotional story

[01:05:53] kong is a very heartfelt story and they they didn't nail it

[01:05:58] they they turned it into this rainbow bright

[01:06:03] weird mashup of like the big ape doesn't feel like it doesn't feel like kong should have been

[01:06:14] this beautiful game it should have been a throwback to not new york city when that when

[01:06:23] the original takes place right was it like 1930s whatever 40s new york city the whole game should

[01:06:32] have looked beautiful

[01:06:33] traditional New York, old school classic New York, like that original

[01:06:38] Kong movie poster. And it should have been a beautiful game

[01:06:42] where you're trying to save

[01:06:46] King Kong and he falls

[01:06:50] from the Empire State Building and dies.

[01:06:54] This game just feels

[01:06:58] like it just misses the

[01:07:02] emotional connection of what people love about King Kong.

[01:07:09] But again,

[01:07:10] if they wanted to go more towards modern day King Kong, like the

[01:07:14] action movies with Godzilla, then they should have done that. They should have

[01:07:18] licensed those movies and they should have made that game. They didn't.

[01:07:24] They just didn't license any of the

[01:07:26] Kong stuff.

[01:07:31] And so I 100%

[01:07:32] agree with Enzo. It shoots great and it's fun. It's addictive to shoot, but you're just

[01:07:36] not connected to it. That is why it's a great location game.

[01:07:40] And then you walk away and you save yourself $13,000 and you sign up

[01:07:44] for Kaneda's Pinball Podcast. And then Kaneda saves you tens of thousands

[01:07:48] of dollars because you take his advice over the last four years.

[01:07:53] I've saved my fan base tens of

[01:07:56] thousands of dollars because they listen to me.

[01:08:00] Don't buy James Bond's 60th anniversary.

[01:08:02] Edition. Those who did lost $12,000.

[01:08:11] Mr.

[01:08:11] Masculine retro Django in the house.

[01:08:14] Did anyone go reach out to Ralph? Is he joining?

[01:08:18] We got Django's in the house. We've got David Van Ness.

[01:08:22] We've got spooky Luke. We've got, you know, this is a good group.

[01:08:26] It's a good group. Gang, I want to just say

[01:08:30] this.

[01:08:32] This is amazing Saturday. Give your kids a call if they're not near you.

[01:08:37] Give them a hug and a kiss if they are.

[01:08:40] Give everybody you love a ring today.

[01:08:43] You know, today I woke up and I just drove down to see my parents.

[01:08:47] They're 30 minutes away.

[01:08:51] I don't do that enough.

[01:08:53] I call my dad every day and my mom every once in a while.

[01:08:58] My mom is amazing.

[01:08:59] She the reason why I talk to my dad more is my dad.

[01:09:02] is more even keel and my mom just will never stop being my mom, which is why I love her. But,

[01:09:09] but the, but is, you know, she'll find some reason to give me some hard motherly love.

[01:09:17] And I, I, you know, there's just, there's only so much a son can take. Um, but she framed these

[01:09:24] amazing, she has an art gallery. She framed these amazing, uh, pop culture car pieces of artwork

[01:09:29] for me that I'm going to figure out where to put them. Um, but here's the thing, here's the thing.

[01:09:38] And I've been feeling this a lot lately, not just that life is short, but the time,

[01:09:44] the time we have together is where all the value is in this hobby. It's the people. I mean,

[01:09:52] kale and I have been saying this, those who emphasize too much, the games are missing

[01:09:58] the,

[01:09:59] what makes us love this hobby. We, if not another game came out new in box,

[01:10:05] we would still love this hobby because of the people. And that's where the memories are.

[01:10:11] That's where the moments that matter are. And that's where the magic lies. It's all the different

[01:10:15] personalities. We all come from different walks of life. We all come from different mamas. We all

[01:10:19] come from different places. We all have different, you know, socioeconomic backgrounds. And yet this

[01:10:25] analog toy, which can't be digitized has brought us all together. And I think that's, I think that's

[01:10:29] a great thing to do. And I think that's a great thing to do. And I think that's a great thing to do.

[01:10:29] I was banned from Pinside. If I wasn't banned from Pinside, I would not have started the podcast.

[01:10:37] If I didn't start the podcast, I don't meet most of you. It's great. It's beautiful. It's just

[01:10:44] kind of like real. It's like a real beautiful story. Um, what this hobby has created in a

[01:10:50] community. And I love it. Cause it's like, it's small, like it's neat. We're like a nano community.

[01:10:56] Ah, man. And like,

[01:10:59] it's just been a lot of fun making this content all these years, watching the show grow, watching,

[01:11:06] you know, the subscribers join every month. It's great to get a little bit back in the piggy bank.

[01:11:14] Uh, but you get a lot more and I love it. And I think it's a great sort of cycle we have going.

[01:11:22] And, you know, not everybody loves me. Not everybody can tolerate me. And I've made my

[01:11:28] mistakes.

[01:11:29] I've thrown my drinks. I've had my moments with some people on here,

[01:11:35] but cooler heads usually prevail. Right? So I want to say thank you for sticking with Canada.

[01:11:44] I want to say thank you for being a subscriber. If you're not a subscriber, you should be a

[01:11:49] subscriber. I want to thank you guys for all the donations you've given over the years. Sad boy,

[01:11:54] you're crazy. I love you. Pete Rosen, whether or not Pete donates,

[01:11:59] today doesn't matter. He's been such a great patron to Canada. Um, and you know, the friendships,

[01:12:05] man, I love it when I get Ed Robertson, man, I could, I could text Ed. He might get back to me.

[01:12:09] I'm not sure you will, but I love Ed Robertson, Jack danger. Um, you know, I have a lot of

[01:12:16] relationships with these manufacturers. You know, there's, there's this like misconception that you

[01:12:20] have to be nice about every game to have a relationship with the manufacturers.

[01:12:24] And it's not true at all. Like, look at, look, look at everything I say.

[01:12:29] No one calls me a shill and I could call George Gomez and have dinner with him. I,

[01:12:37] with the Abbott's family, Ken Cromwell's in the house. Ken, welcome buddy. Um, Ken,

[01:12:42] it's good to see you, man. We, we definitely can. I think we're going to get those beers,

[01:12:46] probably expo. I would say, um, I, I don't know how to get retro Ralph. We're all asking for

[01:12:54] Ralph to come on the show. Ken Cromwell's on Facebook right now. Ken, what's up brother?

[01:12:59] Um, you know, like my point was in the end saying, saying stuff about like, you know,

[01:13:08] be hard on the, the, the, the thing is like, be hard on the games, not on the people. The hard

[01:13:13] part is like, sometimes you got to be hard on some of the people. Sad boy, usually illusion

[01:13:18] one or two is where it's at for me. One is where it's at. Oh man. Hmm. Um,

[01:13:29] um,

[01:13:29] that's, that's a, that's a tough one, man. Cause I'm going to have to say,

[01:13:34] use your illusion too, is like, is much better. I'll tell you why.

[01:13:46] Pete Rosen, 5,000 stars on right now. Pete Rosen just hit with 5,000 stars on Facebook. Pete,

[01:13:52] I love you. You're the man. You're the man. Um, I mean, two outsold,

[01:13:59] one by a long shot because of you could be mine, but you gotta just, uh, to me, like the one with

[01:14:06] more throwaway songs is one because of the civil war, like, doesn't it go like civil war? I'm trying

[01:14:15] without even looking at it. I'm going to try to say that the songs in the order that they're on

[01:14:21] the album, I think it's like civil war, 14 years. Um,

[01:14:29] then it's like yesterday's knocking on heaven's door, get in the ring, right? Then it's,

[01:14:39] um, after get in the ring, I want to say it's,

[01:14:46] I mean, I, it's not breakdown just yet, but breakdowns there, um,
