[00:00] Mama Mia, here I go again, Mama, how can I resist you?

[00:06] Mama Mia, does she show again? Mama, just a much I missed.

[00:13] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit!

[00:18] Welcome everybody to episode 630 of Canada's Pimball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:23] Let's talk about Stern Pimball's new release, Venom Pimball, with Brian Eddie.

[00:29] Will Brian Eddie finally finally make a game that makes everyone see the great results he had back in the

[00:36] Valley Williams day? We have Zombie Eddie on another Stern game. Is it too much Yeti? That's what a lot of

[00:43] people are saying. Can we please get some new artist over at Stern Pimball? Why are they not bringing

[00:49] Christopher Franchie back into the mix, right? Because I do agree with people who say you don't

[00:54] want to have every single Stern game look the same and there are so many artists out there.

[01:00] But if there is any genre that really brings Yeti's talents to life, it is the comic book genre.

[01:08] So I think the game is going to look stunning. So what do I think about Venom? What do I think about

[01:13] Stern Pimball making Venom after Rush? Here's what I think. I think Stern is going to the same

[01:21] well too many times. So many superhero games, so many dad rock games, where's the originality?

[01:30] Where is the diversity in the lineup of machines? And the reason why I say diversity, if you have a

[01:36] lineup of Stern games, chances are you've got many, many superhero Marvel games in your portfolio.

[01:44] They've done Avengers twice. We have two Avengers games. They've done X-Men. They've done Spider-Man.

[01:53] How about we do something besides comic books? But the reason why they're doing it is smart.

[01:59] From a marketing standpoint, I mean if I'm them, here's why they're doing Venom because Venom is a

[02:04] cheaper property over at Marvel. This is not one of the more expensive Marvel properties. And so they

[02:10] get it for cheaper. They're not having to deal with the movie studios. So there's not going to be like

[02:15] Tom Hardy doing any call out. So there's not going to be anything that they have to buy that's

[02:19] expensive. They're just going to pay for the license and then they're going to create probably some

[02:24] original Venom adventure, if you will. Kind of like Jurassic Park, kind of like Avengers, right? So

[02:31] this is Stern's new formula. But here's my issue lately with all of this. This is fine. I don't

[02:36] have a problem with this, but I do have a problem with it at these prices at this price point. And I

[02:43] mean it when I say this at this price point, I'm so like over just running after every single Pimball

[02:49] machine. And as these games are going up and up in price, you really want these to be dream themes.

[02:54] Now the problem with saying it has to be a dream theme to justify the price is that everyone

[03:00] has different dream themes. Like there are people out there that love Venom. There are more than

[03:06] a thousand people on planet earth who consider Venom to be a dream theme. The problem is are there

[03:12] more than a thousand Pimball collectors. But with where the prices are at these days, it doesn't

[03:16] even matter. It doesn't matter. They're going to sell every single one and then some Stern Pimball is

[03:23] going to sell out of Rush Pimball on day one. Everyone is going to buy a Stern LE because what we're

[03:29] seeing in the market now. Remember the good old days when we used to discuss if a Pimball machine

[03:34] would be successful. Those days are over. Every single Pimball machine that is released now, release

[03:40] now. We'll find a home. This market is upside down right now. We live in a market in which

[03:46] Legends of Vahala would have never sold anything five years ago. Now they sold and not just sold.

[03:53] They sold Legends of Vahala over to American Pimball for $8,400. It's over. The Ghostbusters LE

[04:02] number 500. It's sold for $21,000. There's another Ghostbusters LE for sale right now on eBay for

[04:13] $29,000. My friend is about to sell his Pires of the Caribbean for $36,000. Remember when it was

[04:23] like you could get a Stern LE for seven grand, five grand, and then it was used for like 50, 500

[04:30] years. Remember those good old days? Remember when a Stern LE came out and you could actually get one,

[04:35] and now that they've doubled the amount, you still can't get one now. It gets crazy. I think

[04:41] Stern chose Venom because it's a cheaper property. I think they chose it because it's going to be

[04:45] super colorful. I think this game is going to crush on location, and I think this game is going

[04:50] to sell out day one. Do I think the game is going to be amazing? I don't know. It'd be weird for me

[04:55] to say the game's not going to be any good. I haven't seen anything on it. Brian Eddy's track record

[05:00] is not the best. I don't expect magic from Brian Eddy. I hope he makes a magical Pimbal machine.

[05:05] I'm always rooting for every new game to be great, but I have to be completely candid with all of you.

[05:10] All of these games coming out with such cadence, right? Such cadence in terms of new releases from

[05:15] Stern Pimbal. Most of them are not really this magical world under glass. Godzilla was. Godzilla

[05:20] was a really refreshing new game from Stern Pimbal. It showed us they can put more under the glass

[05:26] of their Pimbal machines. Does it justify the price? I would argue no Stern is worth anywhere near.

[05:32] Anywhere near $9,000. Let alone 10,000. Let alone $20,000. No Stern is worth anywhere near that.

[05:40] And it's almost like everyone's forgetting Stern's approach. Their whole thing is just keep the line

[05:46] moving whenever you lift the hood. Whenever you lift the hood on any Stern machine, modern Stern

[05:51] machine, just lift the hood up on the game and see how little is underneath the play field. These

[05:57] games are not loaded like people think. They're deceptively loaded, especially games like Godzilla.

[06:03] They're deceptively loaded, but there's not a ton of money going into these games. The bomb on

[06:09] Godzilla is not much higher than the bomb was on Tron or Simpsons Pimbal Party. You get my drift.

[06:15] We're all witnessing Stern slowly put more into these games and now they're charging like twice

[06:20] as much money. And on the second hand market it gets even scarier. Now these games are going for

[06:25] three times, two times what they were worth when they were brand new. So when I look at this market

[06:30] now, I'm just a little bit like deflated a little bit. It's not as much fun. It isn't. It is not

[06:35] as much fun seeing the Pimbal market today. It's not because here's my thing. With the amount of

[06:40] title Stern keeps cranking out. I almost wish they would only make two games a year and put

[06:46] everything and the kitchen sink into those games. I really wish that was the case. Why wouldn't they

[06:51] just do that? And the line would constantly be moving, making those two epic games, but they

[06:57] don't do that. It's like they spread their resources out really thin. And I have a hard time

[07:02] believing. Here's the thing. I have a hard time believing that Brian Eddie is like a venom nut.

[07:07] Like he loves venom so much that he couldn't wait to get his hands on venom. The same way I have

[07:13] a hard time believing he couldn't wait to get his hands on Mandalorian. Because when I look at his

[07:18] games, I don't feel like he loves these properties so damn much that he can't wait to bring them to

[07:25] life. I didn't see that on his Stranger Things interpretation. I sure as heck didn't see it on his

[07:30] Mandalorian interpretation. So I don't expect him to do something absolutely out of this world

[07:35] bringing the venom world to life. I think what Stern's going to do is they're going to rely on

[07:39] zombie Eddie to sell this game. And he will sell this game because it'll be stunning to look at.

[07:44] I mean, that's what zombie Eddie does. But for a lot of you out there rush and then venom

[07:49] is an easy pass. It just is. I mean, these games are going to sell. You know why? Because of the

[07:53] market, you might as well. I tell this to people. You might as well. If you have an opportunity

[07:58] to buy a Stern Ellie, you might as well just buy it because you're going to make money on it.

[08:03] And you're not going to lose money owning it. So you could buy it. You could open it up. You could

[08:07] play it. And then you could sell it unless the game is a total dog like Led Zeppelin, you're going to

[08:12] get your money back. So you might as well get it. The real problem happening. And I see it all over

[08:17] social media. A lot of angry guys out there that are not on a distributor list. Like they're on the

[08:23] outside looking in. And they're super pissed off that distributors are selling to their long time

[08:29] customers. I mean, people are pissed off that I get games from distributors. It's so funny

[08:33] me when people get pissed off that canada has access to games. Okay, you go make 630 podcasts about

[08:39] pinball. You go give five years of entertainment to the pinball world. You go help the businesses of

[08:44] these distributors who you've been promoting for five years. And then maybe they'll give you something

[08:48] nice. I don't understand why people think I don't deserve the ability to buy a game. Oh, because he

[08:53] might buy a game and sell it for more money. Oh, you want to take away my right to do that. Why?

[08:59] So you can go buy the game. And then if you don't like it, you go sell it for more money. I mean,

[09:03] that's what's happening right now. Everyone pretends like they're not going to do that. But come on.

[09:06] Then you're not going to go reap the profits that you're going to get. Oh, but I got to enjoy the

[09:10] machine. You know, when I sit back and I think about venom right now, I'm not super excited about

[09:15] venom. All you got to do is go to the next stern pin thread on pinside. And the game everybody wants

[09:22] is back to the future, right? I mean, look, I've confirmed for you that it is venom. And there's

[09:26] only like three pages of conversation. And I know it's hard for pinside to give me credit every once

[09:32] in a while for coming up with these rumors. But this is not a rumor. This game is coming out. This

[09:37] game is coming out. This is the game from Brian Eddie and Zambietti. But I don't see that much like,

[09:42] oh my god, take my money now. Kind of response. But it doesn't matter. See, this is a sad part,

[09:48] right? This is why I'm a little bit like not as like excited about pinball lately is because

[09:53] it's actually not a good thing that games will sell regardless of how excited people are. That's not

[09:59] a good thing. You don't want to be in a creative industry like pinball like it's a creative industry.

[10:04] You're creating worlds under glass. You don't want to be in a creative industry where your creativity

[10:09] doesn't really matter. You're still going to sell your artwork, right? That's what's happening.

[10:14] These aren't even like pinball machines anymore. They're being traded like works of art. They're

[10:19] being traded like rare baseball cards. They're being traded now like sneakers. The prices are

[10:24] through the roof. I just heard now that a Jurassic Park le sold for $20,000. $20,000 for a Johnny

[10:34] crap Jurassic Park. Now I know it's a great game from Keith L. Win, but what happened here? It's like

[10:41] everyone is forgotten that Stern puts three to four thousand dollars into these machines.

[10:46] Three to four thousand dollars is what it costs them to make these machines and then you're going

[10:51] to go spend 20 grand on one, 15 grand on all these L. Lee's now. I don't know. Part of me is like

[10:58] I would love there to be 15 thousand dollar pinball machines, but I would love it if 15 thousand

[11:03] dollars went into the game or at least 10 thousand dollar bombs. Can you imagine Stern machines if the

[11:09] bomb was like eight grand? Can you imagine if the bomb was eight grand, we would happily pay them 12

[11:17] the 15 thousand for the machines, but the saddest part now is this and everyone needs to wake up to

[11:22] this fact. You are now spending all this money on games with super low bombs. Like don't fool yourself.

[11:30] I did the whole rundown where I showed you. Godzilla doesn't have nearly as much in it as you think.

[11:35] Stern is done the most amazing thing ever. They're using artwork to disguise that there's not much

[11:41] in these games and they've done it over and over and over again. How can you play a game like

[11:47] Mandalorian in which there's all this Star Wars artwork going on, but there's nothing going on

[11:52] in the game. Where is any of the Star Wars magic in that game? It's nowhere to be found and when

[11:58] people are like it's fun to shoot, of course it's fun to shoot because it's just a fan layout. I

[12:03] mean it's always fun to jump on a pinball machine and shoot a fan layout game that has like open

[12:08] orbits and open shots. Like it's not a brick fest. The shots are pretty easy to hit and it's got

[12:13] flow. So it's fun to shoot, but does it have Mandalorian magic in it? Absolutely not. And so I just

[12:19] wish, I just wish that we can move to a period next year where there will be more into the games.

[12:26] It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. And that is why I really do believe that

[12:29] Jersey Jack launches just are more exciting just for us as pinball enthusiasts because we know that

[12:35] Jersey Jack only makes one game at a time and the entire company is working on that one machine.

[12:41] Like all the resources are going in one direction and that is why Jersey Jack just stuffs more

[12:47] into their games. And also if you lift the play field, there usually is a lot more happening in a

[12:52] JJP game than a Stern, but I will say lift up guns and roses not as much, not as much. So it's

[12:58] going to be interesting if Toy Story comes to us like packed or if Pat Lawler yanked more out of

[13:04] it. So we'll see. Now what else is going on in pinball? Venom Ho-Hom. No one really cares that much.

[13:10] So cactus Canyon. Will we see cactus canyons on the line this year? I don't know. People are

[13:14] saying Essie's might go on the line. I also didn't realize that they're making the SE plus and it's

[13:20] selling for the same price as the LE and they also said they might make only 1,250 SE pluses.

[13:28] So now there's basically two LEs being sold to you by CGC, but I also heard that they might

[13:34] make more SE pluses down the road. Are you confused? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. I don't think CGC

[13:42] really knows what they're doing with this. I think the cactus canyon launch. I do. I think the

[13:46] cactus canyon launch was one of the sloppiest launches in the history of pinball and I have no idea

[13:52] which model is the nicest anymore. I really don't. The LE or the SE plus. Honestly if I were you guys,

[13:59] I would get the SE plus and just do the armor nicer because the armor on the LE is not nice at all.

[14:05] It's not. It's kind of boring. I was I stood over it and I was like this armor is boring. The armor

[14:11] on Godzilla also bores me just so you know when I see Godzilla at least I'm like just doesn't

[14:16] that armor just does not pop. It's gray like gray is a boring color. Gray is not what pinball armor

[14:23] should be. I'm sorry. I don't care if it's best scar. I don't care if it's mecha Godzilla gray.

[14:28] Pinball machines especially LE's they should pop. They should have some more color and some depth

[14:35] to that armor and I just wish Godzilla had something a little bit brighter when it's in those

[14:40] lineups especially because of how bright all the artwork is. It's just I don't know maybe it's

[14:44] just me but I just wish it was brighter. I would just get an SE plus and maybe like just you know

[14:48] brass plate the armor and it's gonna look much nicer than an LE because we know the mod

[14:52] community is gonna make a new apron for that game. You're gonna see everything in cactus canyon

[14:56] that's on the LE get made by the mod community and there's nothing they can do to protect IP because

[15:02] none of that is IP protected. It's just like a generic western game so you're gonna see people make

[15:08] all sorts of mods and then everyone's just gonna want the mods and then a year from now the

[15:12] mods are gonna be worth $3,000. That's the way everything goes in pinball these days okay. Also I've

[15:17] been seeing people asking Stern to make more Ecto 1 Toppers. I'm here to tell you right now the reason

[15:23] why they're never making more is they do not want to renew the license for Ghostbusters. It was super

[15:28] expensive. If you think about probably the greatest missed opportunity for Stern pinball was to not

[15:34] re-release Ghostbusters in the year of the new Ghostbusters movie I think Stern pinball could have

[15:40] made a killing re-releasing Ghostbusters. Now if they did re-release it people would want them to

[15:46] change some of the problems on the existing game. They would want them to close the flipper gap,

[15:51] work on those outlane areas and you know maybe make the game shoot a little bit better and I think

[15:57] then you'd have one of the greatest Stern pinball machines of all time and I know you Ghostbusters

[16:01] owners out there you swear by the game I've played that game so many times and I can't get over

[16:08] the cheap drains in the game and Bill Brandness I'm talking to you right now because my boy Bill

[16:14] over there in Vancouver he added a center post to the game so Bill enjoy the training wheels

[16:20] you put on your game that wasn't how it was designed that wasn't how the game is supposed to be

[16:26] and it's cheating you are cheating if you add a center post to a pinball machine it is cheating

[16:33] there is no way around it okay don't beat me up you know it's true all right let's just close

[16:38] this quick episode of Canada's pinball podcast by saying it is Twippy season and if you go on to

[16:43] the Twippy website I do appreciate any votes for favorite pinball podcaster and also favorite

[16:50] pinball streamer if you are not hanging out with Canada on Facebook live I think you should we

[16:55] have a really great time every Saturday morning at 10 a.m. Eastern time it's called the Saturday

[17:00] Morning Spectacular I go on Facebook live for about 90 minutes and we talk about pinball and I

[17:06] talk about pinball with the community it's actually my favorite time of the week in the pinball world

[17:12] we go over everything happening that week and we just go back and forth on topics and it's really

[17:16] fun I go live for my apartment baby killing and makes an appearance I also want to thank everyone

[17:22] out there there's like three or four gentlemen yesterday who provided some very generous donations

[17:28] to get Brenda drinks for our three year wedding anniversary so thank you so much you know who you are

[17:35] I really do appreciate it and Brenda had a great time last night and we're going to carry over the

[17:40] party tonight as well because unfortunately on our wedding anniversary which was Wednesday kill

[17:47] Ian had an allergic reaction to some sesame that he tried for the first time he ended up in the

[17:54] ER he had to get an epic pen shot he's doing a thousand percent better but that derailed our

[18:01] dinner plans and I'm saying to Brenda this is going to be the first of many times that this baby

[18:06] of ours and this amazing son of ours is going to derail our plans but I'm super happy for each and

[18:13] every one of you in the community I always appreciate everyone who votes and listens to this show

[18:18] it's hard to do this for five years and keep it entertaining maybe I'm starting to bore some of you

[18:24] I'm sorry if that's the case I'm actually in a much better mind space because of burying the

[18:28] hatchet with a lot of the other content creators out in the pinball world it just feels better when

[18:33] everyone's getting along and I really do implore as we go into 2022 to just bury all the hatchets with

[18:38] any of the drama amongst all these content creators because everyone's making good content and

[18:43] everyone's having a good time and honestly I think we all just need to stick together as a community

[18:48] as these companies completely fleece us I really do mean that as these companies fleece as as these

[18:54] prices go through the roof I mean there's a new rumor that turns about the price increase four

[18:58] hundred dollars on every machine again they're gonna keep raising prices I don't think they're

[19:03] gonna put more and more into the games I think they're gonna keep raising prices and as they see

[19:07] Ghostbusters sell for twenty thousand dollars and stranger things sell for fifteen thousand dollars

[19:13] it's not good for us Stern's gonna see that and want that money they don't want to see us trade

[19:20] these games for twenty grand they want that money they're in business for money um so you know

[19:26] it's an interesting time so that's why I'm almost like I don't really want to buy anything anymore

[19:31] next year unless it's toy story or unless it's like Akira or unless it's a dream theme unless it's

[19:37] a dream theme I'm not buying it because I just want to enjoy this hobby free of charge and free

[19:42] of charge is hanging out with canada on Facebook free of charge is listening to this show and for

[19:47] those of you out there who get upset about my club episodes don't be upset join the club enjoy
