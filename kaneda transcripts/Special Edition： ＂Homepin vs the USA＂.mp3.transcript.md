[00:00] Hey, I heard Gary Stern, you know, America's largest pinball manufacturer selling the most

[00:05] pinball machines in the world to the number one market America paid a visit to Mike from

[00:10] Homepin.

[00:11] On the very day, Mike from Homepin was being sworn in with a big festival to cheer him and

[00:17] applaud him for being the new leader of the newest pinball company in the world.

[00:22] And here's what happened when Gary visited Mike from Homepin.

[00:30] Get along with the ceremony.

[00:37] My fellow Decepticards as your new leader I...

[00:46] Oh, this rubs my corrination!

[00:55] Coronation Starscream.

[00:58] This is bad comedy.

[01:00] Hey, that's Ron!

[01:01] He's got you!

[01:02] Here's a hint.

[01:14] Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes?

[01:18] What he says makes worse!

[01:21] Galvatron.

[01:23] Galvatron!

[01:25] Galvatron!

[01:26] Yeah, I can't wait to Mike from Homepin realizes the backlash he's going to get when the

[01:33] world hears about his comments, when the world hears about his views on America and how

[01:38] he doesn't really care about this market.

[01:39] And we know, Mike, you're not planning to compete with JJP or Stern.

[01:43] You make pinball machines, bro.

[01:45] I love how you act like you're not competing with the two other major people who make

[01:49] pinball machines.

[01:51] How are you not competing with Stern and JJP?

[01:55] Look, it's convenient for you to be this close mind and it's convenient for you to be

[01:59] the sort of like the troll on the forums that just antagonizes everybody.

[02:03] But let's re-what Mike responded to when I wrote the following.

[02:07] I wrote absolutely BS comments by Mike.

[02:11] Even Lamer attempts by people trying to claim it's part of Aussie culture.

[02:15] Please Mike, explain to me how using the N-word in Vancouver wasn't racist.

[02:19] We love to hear the context of the usage and how it just was taken to piss out of the

[02:24] moment.

[02:25] You do realize that you now run a company that is trying to sell products to customers.

[02:30] Your words will do nothing but lose you customers.

[02:32] I'm utterly shocked that people are trying to defend his comments.

[02:35] And he wrote back, you don't know Australia or Australians.

[02:39] I do.

[02:40] You are nothing but American wanker through and through.

[02:45] You don't even realize that 95% of people on here wish you would just go away.

[02:51] If you are shocked and offended, that's tough shit.

[02:56] Please don't buy my products.

[02:57] Do you really think I care?

[02:59] I could care less.

[03:01] Actually, no, I couldn't care less.

[03:04] Just go back to the Dutch site, Pinsite.

[03:06] Oh, that's right.

[03:08] You can't.

[03:09] They banned you.

[03:10] Why did I just attend Vancouver Flipout?

[03:12] That I've chosen not to go to many shows in America despite being invited many times

[03:17] to various people.

[03:18] Why do you think my products are sold in almost every other country but not offered in America?

[03:24] I responded to your email and I was just going to post the message here, but I couldn't

[03:27] be bothered.

[03:29] Just fuck off will you.

[03:31] That's Mike from Home Pin.

[03:33] That is a man who runs a company that is trying to sell products to customers, trying to

[03:38] sell products to pinball people.

[03:39] And he could give two shits about you in America, about you as a pinball person in America.

[03:45] He doesn't need your sales here.

[03:46] He doesn't give a fuck.

[03:47] He doesn't give a fuck if you think his comments were racist or insulting or derogatory.

[03:52] He doesn't give a shit.

[03:53] You know, part of me has got to respect this man's bravado that he's just doubling down

[03:59] on his ignorant, closed mind, views of the world.

[04:01] And look, Mike, you can do what you want, but I can do what I want.

[04:05] I have a podcast.

[04:06] I have a thousand plus people that listen to this podcast that are pinball collectors.

[04:13] And you honestly don't get business, my man.

[04:17] Why would anybody running a business?

[04:20] Talk the way you do.

[04:21] I want to read what he wrote to me in his email because it was equally as entertaining,

[04:27] closed mind, ignorant and stupid.

[04:30] He writes, okay, so I'm going to paraphrase this.

[04:33] I don't want to read the whole thing.

[04:35] He wrote, Australians are not as politically correct as many Americans.

[04:40] Actually, the rest of the world is not as politically correct as America.

[04:44] Maybe you should get out more outside of America, I mean.

[04:48] Most Australians roll with the flow and I live in China.

[04:52] Although I guess the, I don't want to say this word, who sent you screen grabs is simply

[04:56] looking to discredit me and try to cause me grief.

[04:59] Well, F-HAM, there are many more people apart from one idiot who like what I'm doing over

[05:05] a jealous few who don't.

[05:06] Okay, so let me stop there.

[05:07] We're not jealous of you, Mike.

[05:09] Nobody's jealous of you.

[05:11] All right, and rolling with the flow is not using these derogatory terms.

[05:16] Okay, it's just, it's not about America versus the rest of the world.

[05:20] And yes, America just happens to have a history with a lot of these words being very hateful

[05:26] and we deal with them differently.

[05:29] Okay, so if anyone's in a more closed-minded, ignorant sort of cocoon, it's you.

[05:35] And your mates over in Australia who aren't exposed to more cultures, okay?

[05:41] And by living in China that does not excuse you for this behavior, bro, he then writes,

[05:46] I caught plenty here in China as a white foreigner.

[05:49] So I dished back as good as they give it.

[05:52] They call me a gwelo.

[05:55] It's a derogatory term meaning white goes, so I give it back and call them a slope.

[05:59] It's also no picnic living here, believe me.

[06:02] More would be interested in that story rather than saying a few words that some, again,

[06:07] he said, fuck knuckles, that's actually a good insult.

[06:10] I'll give you credit when you have a good insult.

[06:11] Fuck knuckles find offensive.

[06:13] Poor didoms, they are the sad dick liquors, not me.

[06:16] Wow, I mean, if you're listening with your kids, sorry, turn this one off.

[06:20] Don't read too much into things.

[06:21] A lot of Americans sadly are far too sensitive about lots of things.

[06:25] Why do you think I just attended Vancouver flip out, but have chosen to not attend several

[06:30] events in America?

[06:31] Probably obvious really.

[06:33] My take and please quote me is, harden up and get over it.

[06:38] Okay?

[06:39] Let's just stop there for a minute.

[06:40] Harden up and get over it.

[06:42] Buck up, kids.

[06:43] I'm about to use the word like the N word.

[06:46] Buck up, you two men kissing.

[06:47] I'm about to call you the F word.

[06:50] Buck up, get over it.

[06:52] I used it.

[06:53] It's no big deal.

[06:54] Look, it's up to you to decide.

[06:56] I mean, look, this has been, I'm traveling.

[06:59] I'm tired.

[07:00] I'm going to see out right now.

[07:02] It's 6.22 and it's 9.22 in New York.

[07:05] And here I am.

[07:06] Here I am sort of exposing to you the mic from home pin, like in his own words.

[07:10] I'm not even like putting words in this guy's mouth.

[07:14] And then, you know, I wrote, wow, you really don't get it.

[07:17] You're going to need some luck, man.

[07:18] He's like, nope, you don't get it.

[07:19] My customer base is not America and I have never wanted it to be get over it.

[07:23] Okay.

[07:24] So that's cool.

[07:25] Make a pinball company where the number one marketplace for pinball is America.

[07:29] And, you know, just sell your pinball machines to Europe and Australia and the rest of the

[07:32] world.

[07:33] But I think anyone in America who supports this guy is kind of crazy.

[07:38] We love pinball, bro.

[07:39] Why did you have to make it so divisive?

[07:41] That's the thing that sucks.

[07:42] Like, you're a fool simply because you had to bring all these things into it.

[07:48] And when you're running a company and you're now the leader of a product and it's like,

[07:54] it's insane for you to say, I don't give a shit about selling pinball to Americans.

[07:59] But it's more than that.

[08:00] You're not just saying that.

[08:01] Like, I could care less if you're like, you know what?

[08:03] America's not a market for us.

[08:04] It's cool.

[08:05] There's plenty of car companies that don't sell cars in other parts of the world and they're

[08:08] very successful.

[08:10] Like, it's not about that.

[08:12] It's that you're using this platform of being a racist, ignorant asshole and you're using

[08:18] the fact that you're Australian as an excuse to behave that way.

[08:23] And that's the part that people have a problem with.

[08:25] You ignorance.

[08:26] You don't get it, Mike.

[08:28] You don't get it.

[08:29] So go make your pinball.

[08:30] I don't care.

[08:31] No one's jealous of you.

[08:32] In fact, I kind of feel sorry for you that you are like living this dream profession of

[08:36] making, you know, these devices and pinball machines.

[08:39] And you really, really, really like still have so much like ignorant stuff inside you.

[08:45] And then you can't even see why it's offensive to talk that way.

[08:48] And it's not about being American.

[08:50] You fool.

[08:51] It's not.

[08:52] There's just certain words that shouldn't be used socially.

[08:55] And then defend it when you're called out for using them.

[08:59] But this is it.

[09:00] This is the last I'm going to talk about this thing.

[09:02] You guys can make up your mind on Mike from Home Pin.

[09:05] You know, he is who he is.

[09:06] You can buy his machine if you want to if you don't, you don't have to.

[09:09] But Mike, you're full.

[09:10] This is going to carry over you regardless of where you are and who your target is.

[09:15] You don't get it.

[09:16] You really don't get it.

[09:17] There's going to be a day where you're going to want to sell machines in America.

[09:21] You're going to want to do that.

[09:22] You're going to want to go to US shows to build your clientele because why would you

[09:26] not?

[09:27] There's so many more pinball buyers there than anywhere else in the world.

[09:32] So good jobs telling us how you feel about America.

[09:35] Great guy.

[09:36] Class act.

[09:37] Real professional guy you are.

[09:38] Can't wait.

[09:39] Can't wait.

[09:40] To this guy needs something from the American pinball marketplace.

[09:41] It's going to happen.

[09:42] It's going to happen.

[09:43] Anyway, I'm done with this guy.

[09:45] You can buy his game or not.

[09:46] Have a good day, guys.
