[00:00] Plenty people don't understand, no, they think loving is money in the hands.

[01:00] Watching Streams of Dungeons and Dragons by Joel at Flippin' Out, that was really good,

[01:04] we're gonna talk about that.

[01:06] Pulp Fiction LE's 500 have been made after like 2 years of waiting, more than 2 years

[01:12] of waiting, so that's, I don't know, do you take credit for taking 2 years to get 500

[01:18] games made?

[01:20] Stern Pinball makes 800 games a week!

[01:23] We've got Evil Deads are gonna start rolling out to customers, Spooky Pinball seems to

[01:28] have a lot of mojo, a lot of momentum, a lot of people in their corner.

[01:34] Barrels of Fun, this is some news, I hit up David Van S and I said, hey David, just let

[01:40] us know.

[01:41] If it's not Dune, cause I'm hearing it's not Dune, so I hit him up, I'm like, can you

[01:46] just like confirm if it's not that one theme, and he refuses to confirm or deny that they

[01:53] have Dune Pinball.

[01:55] He's like, what would be the fun in that?

[01:57] And so Barrels of Fun continues to just want us to guess.

[02:01] I don't think it's Dune, I think Jason Ruffer started that rumor, he's convinced it's Dune,

[02:08] but I don't think it is.

[02:10] From what I've heard from my other friends over at Barrels of Fun, it's not gonna be

[02:16] Dune.

[02:17] The other thing that's interesting is this, this company, their home show is Texas Pinball

[02:23] Festival and I heard they are rallying to get their next game revealed at TPF.

[02:31] But I also heard all of the stars have to align if they're gonna achieve that and it's

[02:38] not looking likely.

[02:40] So I don't think anything is gonna be revealed or announced.

[02:46] Brand new at Texas Pinball Festival and it does beg the question.

[02:51] Has TPF lost its luster?

[02:54] It used to be the show.

[02:56] When Kim and Ed were running TPF, it was like the show.

[03:01] It was the show that most people went to, it was the biggest show and it did seem like

[03:06] the Pinball manufacturers did want to reveal their games around TPF so that when TPF happened,

[03:14] all of the new games were there.

[03:16] There were many, many years where that March time period was always a time period where

[03:22] you were gonna get something new.

[03:24] We started to see companies like Stern and Jersey Jack and American Pinball, all of their

[03:29] new games like P3 Multimorphic, all new games were released around that window.

[03:35] It's no longer the case.

[03:37] I know when I say I'm not going to TPF, I miss the Twippies being live at TPF, that

[03:42] was one of the main reasons I would go.

[03:45] I just think with Expo and Pinball at the beach, I don't know, I think the show has

[03:50] just lost some of its luster and I just want to say this, if you live down there and it's

[03:56] your show, I'm happy for you.

[03:59] People get very mad and territorial over their shows and I see people like on my Facebook

[04:04] page when I confirmed that Harry Potter was not going to be at TPF and then when people

[04:10] respond saying, well now they're not going to go, people are chiming in being like, it's

[04:15] your loss, you're gonna miss a great show and it's like, come on gang, we're allowed to

[04:20] save some money, not go to every single pinball show and only go to pinball shows when maybe

[04:27] there's a more compelling reason to go.

[04:30] You're gonna spend a thousand or two thousand dollars going all the way to a pinball show.

[04:35] I would rather go somewhere where it's on the beach.

[04:38] I would rather go to Chicago where I can go visit the manufacturers and see all of the

[04:43] people behind the games.

[04:45] Now, look, I still think a lot of manufacturers are gonna be at TPF.

[04:49] So if you go to TPF, you're gonna meet all the people from Spooky and Jersey Jack and

[04:54] Stern Pinball and there's still gonna be hundreds of pinheads there.

[04:59] I just won't be going this year.

[05:01] Would I go to the Twippies down in Houston and my friends over at Worm Hall?

[05:06] Maybe, you know, maybe.

[05:07] Like, come on.

[05:08] I know people fly Kerry Hardy places, they fly other personalities places.

[05:15] Canade is Pinball Podcasts.

[05:18] Six years in a row, the favorite pinball podcast and I still don't get any of the VIP treatment.

[05:23] They still don't give me plaques and they don't give me like all-star cards and they don't

[05:29] give me any special privileges and guess what everybody, sometimes I'm happy to be the black

[05:33] sheep of this entire pinball content space.

[05:37] You know, you hear these other guys, they have to say nice stuff about everything.

[05:41] I mean, I hear people say like, oh, I played Road Trip and it's actually like, come on,

[05:45] gang, like look at that game.

[05:47] I mean, nothing personal, man, but like that game is not gonna sell.

[05:50] They're not gonna sell 500 Road Trips.

[05:53] Where has everybody been?

[05:55] This hobby is now oversaturated with games and titles and you want to make an original

[06:01] game.

[06:02] It's fine.

[06:03] You can make it.

[06:04] You can make it to shows, but when I watch the Road Trip video and like nobody can hit

[06:08] the ramps and you've got like this spinner to the left by the slingshot that you can't

[06:13] even hit and I get you've got some interesting ideas going on, but how many of you out there

[06:19] want a Road Trip theme?

[06:21] I don't get it.

[06:22] I just don't get it and I'm allowed not to like something.

[06:26] I'm allowed to say I'm not gonna buy something.

[06:28] I'm allowed to say that not every pinball venture is something I have to support.

[06:34] And that's a weird thing about the modern world, right?

[06:36] You just have to support everything pinball.

[06:38] We don't support everything pinball.

[06:40] We're not gonna get new people into the hobby.

[06:43] You're not being a good ambassador for pinball.

[06:45] So no Harry Potter at TPF.

[06:48] Maybe Barrel's next game, which maybe is Dune or not Dune.

[06:52] It's funny, my friend Gabe.

[06:53] Gabe listens to the show.

[06:55] Gabe thinks that Harry Potter is gonna be unveiled at Pintastic.

[06:59] Gabe, let me tell you right now.

[07:01] Harry Potter, one of the biggest themes in the history of pinball, is not gonna be unveiled

[07:06] at Pintastic.

[07:07] It's just not gonna happen, Gabe.

[07:09] Not in a million years will Jersey Jack pinball with the most expensive IP they've ever had,

[07:15] one of the most expensive IPs in all of pinball, is not gonna reveal the game and bring it to

[07:21] the world for the first time ever at Pintastic.

[07:24] If they were smart, they would reveal this game in Orlando, at Universal, at Wizarding

[07:31] World.

[07:32] This game should be revealed in a magical way.

[07:36] And nothing against Pintastic.

[07:37] It's the 10-year anniversary.

[07:39] I have a hard time believing that the most magical way you could reveal Harry Potter is gonna

[07:45] be at Pintastic.

[07:46] Look, you don't need a pinball show to reveal Harry Potter.

[07:51] All you gotta do is put up that video.

[07:53] And look, if this company spent $100,000 on an Avatar launch video, they better spend

[08:01] that much or more on the Harry Potter video.

[08:05] And it's gonna be crazy, gang.

[08:06] Now look, I heard something that is not good news from someone who's seen and played Harry

[08:12] Potter, and Harry Potter is next, people.

[08:15] There is no other theme that's coming out from Eric Minier other than Harry Potter next.

[08:21] I see people in the chat when I said Harry Potter is not gonna be at T.P.F.

[08:26] Some dudes like, yeah, because Harry Potter is not the next game.

[08:29] It's the next game.

[08:30] I will turn this show off for a week if Harry Potter is not the next game.

[08:36] But here's what I heard.

[08:37] I heard, Kaneda, you should curb your expectations on Harry Potter pinball.

[08:46] What does that mean?

[08:47] I think it means that this game is not gonna be loaded.

[08:53] I think it's gonna be a little barren.

[08:55] And we didn't see any toys in Avatar.

[08:58] We didn't see any toys in Godfather.

[09:01] There's not many toys in Elton John.

[09:04] There weren't many toys in Toy Story.

[09:07] And Harry Potter is a game that you want to be loaded with stuff.

[09:12] Everybody wants Harry Potter to be Pirates of the Caribbean 2.0.

[09:16] We know it's not gonna be a wide body.

[09:19] We know Jersey Jack is cutting costs while they're charging more for their product.

[09:25] There weren't any toys in Guns N' Roses.

[09:27] It's been a long time, right?

[09:28] It's been like four or five titles now.

[09:31] Jersey Jack games, when you lift the hood on them, are empty.

[09:36] And they're 12 to $15,000.

[09:39] So why do we think Harry Potter is all of a sudden gonna go back to the old ways of Jersey

[09:45] Jack and giving you a loaded pinball?

[09:48] We all want it to be that way.

[09:49] But look, gang, Eric Miniers made three games.

[09:53] Only one is loaded with stuff.

[09:55] The other two are empty when it comes to toys, mechs, and magical things the ball does.

[10:02] They're empty.

[10:03] So I don't know.

[10:05] I really don't know what to expect.

[10:07] I think all of us are probably expecting Jersey Jack to fumble this game.

[10:14] You know why we feel this way?

[10:16] They did it to themselves.

[10:19] Because Jersey Jack, think about it, when was the last time Jersey Jack pinball exceeded

[10:24] your expectations on a theme?

[10:27] When was the last time you saw one of their games and you say, wow, that's amazing how

[10:32] they engineered that?

[10:34] Look at what the ball does there.

[10:36] What an incredible new innovation in pinball.

[10:39] That is so cool.

[10:41] It's been so long since we've said that.

[10:44] I think the last game you might have said that on, maybe Guns N' Roses because that's

[10:49] the first time we saw the light show.

[10:51] And look, G&R had really cool stuff in it.

[10:54] You know, G&R with the guitar neck and the bass and the drumsticks, it made everybody

[10:59] feel really good when you saw it for the first time.

[11:02] And we haven't felt that way really since G&R.

[11:05] You didn't feel that way when you saw Toley's story or The Godfather or Elton John or Avatar.

[11:11] And that's four or five years now since we've had anything of wow.

[11:14] And Harry Potter commands the wow.

[11:17] And so we shall see, it's going to be longer than we want it to be.

[11:21] We're in this lull period.

[11:22] There's nothing new.

[11:23] We're seeing Dungeons and Dragons.

[11:25] Let's talk a little bit about D&D.

[11:27] So Joel did a really great stream of this game and I watched about 30 minutes of it.

[11:33] And I will say this, Joel, the way he talks about the rules and he understands the game,

[11:39] it's a really, really great way.

[11:42] If you want to learn about a new machine, I highly recommend you watch his videos.

[11:48] They are very informative.

[11:50] They are very entertaining.

[11:53] And they are some of the best pinball tutorials, if you will, out there in the world.

[11:57] So Joel and team over there, thank you for those videos.

[12:01] And I will say after watching D&D for 30 minutes, I'm just not sure if I love the game or if

[12:09] it would become too confusing, but I will say what they have done with this game might

[12:15] be one of the best interpretations of a theme in the history of pinball.

[12:21] Because this game is D&D in pinball format.

[12:25] And I love how they did it.

[12:27] I love everything about the translation of Dungeons and Dragons as a pinball machine.

[12:33] So if you buy this game, you are going to go on a D&D adventure.

[12:38] You are going to start where you left off.

[12:41] You're going to look down at the map and see what villages you've visited, what modes

[12:46] you've completed and what modes and battles you failed at.

[12:50] I love that.

[12:51] There is also this amazing thing in the code.

[12:54] I love it.

[12:55] Long range weapon.

[12:56] It's like when you have your long range weapon, you can actually hit a shot without even flipping.

[13:03] If you know you have to hit the red arrow, you can hit your long range weapon and this

[13:07] blue light sweeps across the different arrows and inserts.

[13:12] If you line up the blue with the red shot you need to hit, you hit the button on the

[13:17] lockdown bar and it hits the shot for you.

[13:19] I freaking love that.

[13:21] I freaking love it.

[13:22] And this is the thing.

[13:23] When I watch a stern game, and this is me playing Guns N' Roses all day long in Jersey,

[13:27] Jack, where there's too many lights, everything's lit up.

[13:31] You usually have no idea what you're shooting at.

[13:33] I just love that a stern machine.

[13:35] You kind of understand what you need to do.

[13:38] And even though their lighting is a little archaic, it still really works well for pinball.

[13:44] And I also think this game shoots really well.

[13:47] It might be Brian Eddy's best layout is what people are saying.

[13:51] I do think for the theme itself, I'm just going to say this, for the theme itself, and

[13:55] I know there's the big dragon there and there's the gelatinous cube, I just think there should

[14:00] be a little bit more.

[14:02] There's something about watching the game being played.

[14:05] There's really not that many toys in the game.

[14:09] There are big toys in the game, like the dragon, but the dragon's not really in play that often

[14:15] when you watch the stream of the game.

[14:17] So I wish there was a little bit more, but man, this thing is all about the code.

[14:22] It's all about feeling like you're playing a game of D&D in a pinball machine.

[14:27] And look, I think for the people who love D&D, this is going to be maybe the best pinball

[14:32] machine you ever own.

[14:34] And I'm just not sure if you don't love D&D, you're going to get the hours of excitement

[14:40] from the game.

[14:41] And I could see people feeling like there's too much going on.

[14:45] It's too confusing.

[14:46] I don't want to do this.

[14:47] Like for a lot of people out there, this isn't why you play pinball.

[14:51] You don't want to play pinball to go on an RPG role-playing adventure.

[14:56] You want pinball to be more fast, more immediate, easier to understand and progress through

[15:02] a game.

[15:02] But I think what's great about pinball in 2025 is just the variety we have, right?

[15:08] It's like, you don't have to buy this game, but if you want a game like this, I'm really

[15:12] happy a game like this exists.

[15:15] And if you look at Stern's portfolio of games, it's insane.

[15:20] It really is insane.

[15:21] Stern Pinball, every three to four months, puts out a new game and they have everything

[15:26] from music to comics to movies to D&D.

[15:30] Like they've got something for everybody.

[15:33] And you can't say that about every single pinball company.

[15:36] When you look at Spooky Pinball, it's like they're still kind of in that spooky horror

[15:40] theme.

[15:41] And I don't think they make something for everybody.

[15:43] And I think Spooky Pinball is going to deliver more variety in the future because they know

[15:48] better than anybody now.

[15:50] That theme is everything.

[15:52] And you don't want to get pigeonholed into just one type of theme over and over and over

[15:56] again.

[15:57] We really are in this amazing period in this hobby where there is something for everybody.

[16:04] The fact that we have a Pulp Fiction Pinball machine available finally is a great thing.

[16:10] Now look, I just want to say this too, because I get into arguments with people about Pulp

[16:13] Fiction.

[16:14] I will never tell you on my podcast that I think Pulp Fiction is a bad game.

[16:18] I know the one at Ethereum was set up floaty and I know that that's not how the game plays.

[16:25] My thing with Pulp Fiction is simply this.

[16:28] I don't like Chicago Gaming Company.

[16:32] I don't like that they reveal the game, took everybody's deposits, and then said nothing

[16:38] to all of us for two years.

[16:41] And then when they finally released the game, they were smug about it.

[16:46] I don't like that.

[16:48] I don't agree with you people that say, I'm just happy they took their time and got it

[16:52] right.

[16:53] I'm just happy about that.

[16:55] There was no reason why they should have revealed the game when they did.

[17:01] Explain to me why it would take two years after you have the game fully made, fully

[17:07] engineered, all the parts you need.

[17:10] Why would it take two years?

[17:12] It makes absolutely no sense.

[17:14] And so I'm allowed to, as a grown adult, just not like a brand and not like a company.

[17:21] Like I don't want to wear certain brands clothing.

[17:24] I don't want to buy CGC games because of how they've operated as a company.

[17:30] And so I don't care what they make.

[17:31] I was really excited about Pulp Fiction two years ago and now I'm no longer excited about

[17:37] it because of CGC.

[17:39] It's the same reason why I'm really excited about Spooky Pimble because of the people

[17:44] at Spooky Pimble.

[17:45] I'm always excited about what's next from Stern Pimble because of the people at Stern

[17:50] Pimble.

[17:51] And nobody I respect more in Pimble than George Gomez.

[17:54] There's no better designer in Pimble than Keith Elwin.

[17:57] There's no better software team than the people over at Stern Pimble unless they're working

[18:02] on X-Men.

[18:03] Then you get the worst software team in Pimble.

[18:05] But I respect those people a lot and I look forward to what they're going to do next.

[18:10] I can't say the same thing about Jersey Jack.

[18:12] I really can't.

[18:14] I wish I could.

[18:15] Jersey Jack to me needs their George Gomez and they don't have it.

[18:19] They don't have their George Gomez.

[18:21] It's not Steve Ritchie.

[18:23] It's not Brett Abbas.

[18:25] It's not Jack.

[18:26] It's not anybody.

[18:27] It's not Eric Minier.

[18:29] They just don't get it.

[18:30] They just don't get it for lack of a better terminology.

[18:34] Jersey Jack Pimble just doesn't get it.

[18:37] When you spend two years making Avatar and you have no toys in it, you don't even have

[18:43] a mode that makes it feel like nighttime in Pandora.

[18:48] The eclipse is not nighttime.

[18:50] It's just an eclipse happening.

[18:51] But when you watch the movies, it's not always about an eclipse.

[18:55] All the bioluminescence stuff happens in Pandora at night and they don't have a single mode

[19:01] in there that's nighttime.

[19:03] So they don't get it.

[19:05] Nothing clicks in their heads that makes any sense to me.

[19:08] Then after Mark Siden has ideas, nobody stood over that game and was like these lower playfields

[19:15] aren't fun.

[19:16] Hey Mark, there's no toys in it.

[19:18] Where are the toys, Mark?

[19:19] You know what I'm saying?

[19:21] It's like Eric's over there, Steve Richie's over there, Jack's over there, everyone's

[19:25] over there, Tom Capara's over there.

[19:28] And these are people that know what makes a Pimble masterpiece.

[19:31] I saw a Facebook post the other day.

[19:34] Jersey Jack is calling its godfather Pimble machine a masterpiece.

[19:39] Are you freaking kidding me?

[19:40] A masterpiece?

[19:42] This game has lost $7,000 in value if you bought a CE.

[19:47] $7,000.

[19:49] And you're going to call it a masterpiece.

[19:52] It's like Walter Payton said, when you're great, other people will say it.

[19:57] You don't call yourself great.

[19:59] And so that's where we're at.

[20:00] I want Jersey Jack to do a 180.

[20:03] I want Jersey Jack to blow us away with Harry Potter.

[20:06] I want it to finally click for these guys.

[20:10] They need a game.

[20:11] They need a game that shows us.

[20:13] They just get it.

[20:15] They get how to theme integrate.

[20:17] They get how to put magic in a game.

[20:19] They get how to give us real pinball fun and real substance, not just lights and art, not

[20:26] just a big screen.

[20:28] They need to make a game that just hits the right way.

[20:32] Elton John was the closest they got to just giving us a great shooting game, but most

[20:37] of us don't want Elton John as a theme.

[20:40] And then there's all these other companies.

[20:42] Isn't it nuts?

[20:43] It's like we spent a lot of time talking about JJP, Stern Pinball, CGC, Spooky Pinball.

[20:49] But what about like Padready?

[20:50] Is anyone talking about what's next from Padready Gaming?

[20:53] I think it's Toten or the Pinball Brothers.

[20:56] What's next from those guys?

[20:58] They're not going away.

[20:59] We've got Jerry with his Portal game maybe coming out.

[21:02] Is that going to sell?

[21:03] I don't know, Mad.

[21:05] Jerry's just funny to me.

[21:06] Multimorphic is just this thing that's going on always.

[21:10] It's kind of like a Renaissance fair, right?

[21:12] It's like they go on around the country, but are you really going to go to one?

[21:17] No.

[21:18] And like, yeah, people there look like they're having fun.

[21:20] And I guess P3 Multimorphic owners are having somewhat of a good time, but it's just after

[21:25] 10 or 12 years of this experiment of these swappable modular pinball machines, and he

[21:33] hasn't sold more than one spooky title.

[21:37] I mean, think about that, gang.

[21:38] He hasn't sold more Multimorphics, and he won't tell us how many he's sold.

[21:43] This is my challenge to Jerry and everybody over at Multimorphic.

[21:48] If you're proud of what you've made, and I know you are, then just tell us how many

[21:54] you've sold.

[21:56] Why is that a mystery?

[21:57] We know it's not a lot, but it's probably more than we think maybe.

[22:03] I would say I don't think after 12 years of this platform, they've sold 700 units.

[22:12] And if I'm wrong, then Jerry and team, tell me I'm wrong and tell us the number.

[22:18] Everybody look, it's Valentine's Day.

[22:20] I love that you subscribe to this show.

[22:23] We are in a little bit of a period where we're just waiting.

[22:27] A lot of us are waiting to play Evil Dead.

[22:29] I'm going to go to Automated and play D&D soon, but we're still waiting.

[22:34] We're waiting for that next pin to really blow us away.

[22:39] We're waiting for that masterpiece, for that wow machine.

[22:43] Spooky Pinball created a wow machine.

[22:45] The only downside is it's Evil Dead, right?

[22:49] If that was Beetlejuice, it would be a whole different conversation.

[22:53] And man, it's going to be fun in the next couple of months, really seeing Jersey

[22:58] Jack versus Barrels of Fun versus King Kong.

[23:02] It's going to happen.

[23:03] And then is there going to be a surprise?

[23:06] Are the Pinball brothers going to come out with Predator?

[23:09] Is there going to be something we didn't see coming happen in 2025?

[23:14] I'm excited to watch it all happen.

[23:16] I will keep you entertained every single week.

[23:20] You know me.

[23:21] Even if there's not news, you're going

[23:23] to tune in two to three times a week and we're going to have fun talking about the hobby

[23:27] we love.

[23:28] Everybody have a great Valentine's Day.

[23:31] Canada out.

[23:32] Oh baby, my sweet baby, you're the one.
