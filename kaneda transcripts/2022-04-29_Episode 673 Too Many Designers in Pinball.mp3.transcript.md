[00:00] Happy Friday, everybody!

[00:30] Ah, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast, let's get right to it.

[00:59] You know, I keep thinking about one thing in pinball right now, and that is, how is

[01:03] it that so many designers are out there in the pinball world, right?

[01:07] We've got all of these designers being gobbled up by these companies, but people, where are

[01:15] the games, right?

[01:16] So let's talk about the news this week that Ryan McQuade, who made Sonic Spinball, has

[01:21] been acquired, if you will, or hired by American Pinball.

[01:25] Now first and foremost, this is great news because Ryan McQuade and his Sonic Spinball

[01:31] game is really, really cool, and if they are able to make Sonic Spinball, it will be the

[01:38] best selling American Pinball game of all time.

[01:42] Now the bar is not very high over at AP, but this is a great move.

[01:47] But here's the question I want to ask, when would we even see this game?

[01:52] Because remember, American Pinball has Dennis Nordman working on two titles.

[01:58] They've already said they're going to make another Riot Pinball game.

[02:02] They also said, officially, they are going to make Barry Oh's last game.

[02:08] So if you look at a company like American Pinball, they're another company that's not

[02:12] even close to getting out two games a year.

[02:15] You know when David Fick said that AP would make two games a year?

[02:19] That was almost three years ago.

[02:22] And they've only got Legends of Ahala out the door in that time period.

[02:27] So here's my question is, why is it that all of these companies keep staffing up in the

[02:33] design department, but it's clearly the manufacturing department that they need to staff up?

[02:40] And I understand there's COVID, I get there's delays, but even before COVID, these companies

[02:47] were not cranking out multiple games a year.

[02:51] And the only company that can really have multiple designers because it makes sense

[02:57] is Stern Pinball, right?

[02:59] John Borg, Keith Elwin, Brian Eddy.

[03:02] So those three guys, if they have three cornerstone games a year, each one of them will have a

[03:09] new game out each year.

[03:12] And Stern has consistently hit on that note, right?

[03:16] You know you're going to get a new Elwin every year.

[03:19] You're going to get a Brian Eddy game and you're going to get a John Borg game and then

[03:23] they might throw into the mix a George Gomez special edition game.

[03:28] But when you look at a company like American Pinball and I'm super excited for Ryan and

[03:32] I see the victory lap, I can't help but wonder when we would see his game.

[03:37] Like what would be the earliest date we would see this game?

[03:40] I don't know, right?

[03:41] Would it be 2023, 2024?

[03:44] I don't know about you guys, but I really am afraid of one thing.

[03:47] I'm afraid the world economies are going to go into a recession and all of these pinball

[03:54] companies have not been able to sort of capitalize on this super hot pinball market.

[04:01] They don't have anything to sell you.

[04:03] It's absolutely crazy.

[04:05] It's the greatest time in pinball history to have used games for sale, right?

[04:11] Like ZacManny is selling a Batman LE for $21,000, right?

[04:16] I sold my super LE like four years ago for $16,000.

[04:21] It would now sell for $40,000, but the reason why Zac is selling it for that, there's no

[04:27] inventory.

[04:28] Like if you do not want a Legends of the Hala, AP has basically nothing to sell you.

[04:35] But I want to go back to Ryan McQuade and Sonic Spinball because here's the other thing

[04:39] I want to ask each and every one of you.

[04:42] If they're not going to make Sonic Spinball, right?

[04:45] If they're not actually going to make his game and get the license from Sega, then this

[04:51] acquisition makes no sense to me and I want to explain why.

[04:56] First and foremost, Ryan McQuade has been building this thing for years because he absolutely,

[05:04] positively, loves Sonic the Hedgehog more than anything else.

[05:09] And if you meet the guy and you talk to the guy and you see all his photos and you see

[05:13] his personal life and he lets you into his home, the man is obsessed with Sonic the Hedgehog.

[05:19] And that's amazing.

[05:20] Like you want that kind of passion making a game the same way Barry and Yop were obsessed

[05:26] with the big Lebowski.

[05:28] And that's why that game had so much magic in it because they loved the theme so much.

[05:35] And Ryan loves Sonic so much that he's making a game with a loop-de-loop and all this cool

[05:41] stuff.

[05:42] Even more excited because now if he's over there with Dennis Nordman and Sophia, he's

[05:47] going to have more access to someone to help him tighten up the shots and maybe even add

[05:53] in a few more toys into the game that are absolutely amazing because they have great

[05:58] engineering backgrounds to help them make Sonic even better.

[06:02] But if they don't get the Sonic license and they make him reskin this game into something

[06:08] else, I think it makes no sense to partner up with Ryan McQuaid.

[06:12] And so I have all of my fingers crossed that they will be able to get the license.

[06:17] Now look, Sonic is not an impossible license to get.

[06:21] Sega absolutely licenses out Sonic the Hedgehog all the time.

[06:25] I am drinking from a water bottle right now that has Sonic the Hedgehog on it.

[06:30] The question becomes, will he be able to get all of the access to like the Sonic cartoon

[06:36] and the different video game footage?

[06:38] But I believe Sega owns it all.

[06:40] And Ryan's been talking to Sega as he's been making this game, so hopefully there's

[06:45] a good relationship there.

[06:47] The one part that people always forget is you could have IP laws and you could have this

[06:51] and you could have that, but if you have a relationship, you can get around a lot of

[06:57] the costs associated with things.

[07:00] We all remember when Slash just picked up the phone and got Live and Let Die into the

[07:05] pinball machine.

[07:06] They didn't have to pay Paul McCartney for it.

[07:08] He just said Slash, it's cool, you can use it.

[07:11] They didn't have to pay a dime.

[07:13] That's what relationships can get you.

[07:15] So I really hope we see Sonic's pinball, but the bigger question is this.

[07:19] So now you've got like four designers over at AP.

[07:22] You've got four designers over at Jersey Jack Pinball, a company which can only get out

[07:27] one game every 18 months or more.

[07:30] And then you have to pay these people salaries, right?

[07:33] That's the other part.

[07:34] Someone comes in to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[07:36] Like let's just say you're Steve Ritchie and you walk into Jersey Jack Pinball.

[07:40] When is your game even coming out?

[07:43] Like is there even a schedule of when his game is going to hit and then what are you

[07:47] doing every day?

[07:48] Like Steve is very prolific and let's say that he designs his game in like six months.

[07:53] He's got the whole game designed.

[07:55] Okay.

[07:56] And then he has to wait three years to get it on the line.

[07:59] Does he then move on to his next game?

[08:01] See these companies, you know, it just makes no sense to me unless your manufacturing can

[08:06] crank out at least two games a year.

[08:09] You should not have four designers on staff.

[08:12] I think you're wasting money.

[08:14] I think it makes no sense because if your build schedule is what Jersey Jack's has been

[08:19] all these years, you might as well just have two designers and they rotate, right?

[08:25] Because in the time it takes to get the next game out, the other designers game will be

[08:29] done.

[08:30] So Eric Minier did Guns N' Roses, then we're going to see Toy Story and then we're going

[08:35] to see Eric Minier's next game, The Godfather is what we're hearing.

[08:39] And the reason why, do you know why?

[08:41] Because Eric Minier's Guns N' Roses was completed like a year and a half before it even came

[08:46] out.

[08:47] And that's how it is over at Jersey Jack.

[08:50] Design is so far behind manufacturing date that they have so much time to move on to

[08:55] future titles.

[08:56] And then look over at Haggis Pinball, right?

[08:59] They're barely getting their first Fathom in a box and you've got Marty Robbins, Pinball

[09:03] designer.

[09:04] Like, when is Marty Robbins' game going to come out?

[09:07] Now if you go listen to old Haggis interviews like a year ago, they said Fathoms would have

[09:13] been completed in 2021 and they were going to bring Marty's game to like Expo or T.P.F.

[09:19] None of that happened.

[09:21] So you've got Marty Robbins designing an original game.

[09:24] You've got Ben Heck designing a game with C.G.C.

[09:27] Where's that game?

[09:29] You've got Mark Ritchie designing Pulp Fiction.

[09:32] Where's that game?

[09:33] It just goes on and on and on.

[09:35] Like Dennis Norman is doing two games for American Pinball.

[09:39] How many games are in design that are not even close to being built?

[09:45] And I think all of this, I mean this, I think all of this speaks volumes about the problems

[09:51] in the pinball world.

[09:52] I think manufacturing needs to dictate design.

[09:57] And I think the main issue with pinball is that it's fun to design games, right?

[10:02] We saw over at Deeproot, it's fun going in every day and pretending to be a pinball wizard

[10:09] and design a bunch of fun stuff and work with artists and work with coders and make the

[10:14] game and design the game.

[10:17] But the real part of pinball that matters is not design.

[10:22] It is manufacturing.

[10:23] It is why Gary Stern always says we are not a pinball company.

[10:28] We are a manufacturing company.

[10:32] And those words mean more than anything I've ever heard in pinball because everybody else

[10:37] has been struggling to figure out how to manufacture the ideas, how to execute on their designs.

[10:48] And I don't understand the part where people go on podcasts and say like let's take David

[10:52] Fix for example.

[10:54] How do you go on a podcast and say we're going to get out two games a year and then like

[10:59] two, three years go by and you haven't done that?

[11:01] How many times did Jack Guinari said we're going to come out with two games a year?

[11:05] Jack's been saying that for like six years now.

[11:08] I mean I just don't understand how left brain, right brain, like how does the design part

[11:13] of a pinball company?

[11:15] How are they so optimistic and then the manufacturing side is really where the rubber meets the

[11:20] road.

[11:21] Like that's where the ultimate truth lies in pinball is in manufacturing.

[11:25] And I still can't get over the fathom video guys.

[11:28] I've been watching it more and more this week and I know some of you don't want me to talk

[11:31] about it but I've never seen a more staged video in my life of a company trying to convince

[11:38] us that they have manufacturing figured out.

[11:41] When we saw them that video was staged they clearly don't have manufacturing figured out

[11:45] and how easy would it have been for Marty and Damian to do a follow up video this week

[11:51] in which they walk around the factory and show us how manufacturing is going on over

[11:56] at Haggis Pinball.

[11:57] They're not going to show it because you all know deep down inside, not even deep down

[12:02] inside, you guys all know on the surface that what they showed us is fake.

[12:07] It is not a real manufacturing facility right now and until they figure that out you're

[12:13] going to be waiting so long to get your fathoms.

[12:17] For those guys who were told you're going to get your game in 8 weeks if you pay in

[12:20] fall that was 6 weeks ago.

[12:23] In 2 weeks all of those people who paid in fall for their series tickets they're not

[12:27] getting their games.

[12:29] There weren't 8 games ready to go out the door.

[12:31] There weren't even 3 games ready to go out the door.

[12:33] There was one prototype game that they boxed up.

[12:37] If the line is going, if manufacturing is actually taking place then they can do a little

[12:43] video tour to show us that.

[12:45] There's a reason why they didn't and hashtag no words.

[12:49] Well canada is going to hashtag just words because words can be powerful.

[12:54] Because asking questions can be powerful.

[12:57] And now the funny part begins right?

[12:59] Are you seeing what's happening on pin side?

[13:01] They've started a club thread for Haggis and now all the owners are moving over there.

[13:06] They don't want to hear anything skeptical.

[13:08] They don't want to ask any tough questions.

[13:11] They don't want to see manufacturing.

[13:13] They don't want to ask hey are we going to get our games in 8 weeks?

[13:15] No.

[13:16] They're going to go huddle in their safe little space like a bunch of babies and they're not

[13:21] going to want to admit the simple fact which is they're not getting their games in like

[13:26] 8 weeks from paying in fall.

[13:28] They're not.

[13:29] What's happening next?

[13:30] A lot more people are going to be asked to pay in fall because they're going to need

[13:34] that money to hire the staff and figure this whole thing out.

[13:37] But from what I can see in that video there aren't many people in any of the shots.

[13:42] You've got the big factory and I bet it's a skeleton crew of four to five dudes like

[13:47] screwing together like one game at a time.

[13:50] Like that was one game at a time.

[13:52] They had one prototype and one new game built.

[13:56] You will see Dr. John unbox it and say everything is A-OK.

[14:01] Everyone's going to get their game soon and look the quality is there.

[14:05] The game is beautiful.

[14:06] But my gosh you are not going to see these fathoms like flying out the door anytime soon.

[14:12] As I said before they're going to grind them out but there is no way I can see them making

[14:18] any money with the slow pace it's going to take to get these games out the door.

[14:22] Alright so what else is going on in pinball?

[14:24] I gave you the rumor I heard.

[14:26] Now keep in mind everybody this is a rumor that CGC's next two games are going to be

[14:31] Mark Richie's single level pulp fiction which we've heard about forever.

[14:35] That game is happening.

[14:37] And also the big surprise I'm hearing is that Twilight Zone is going to be the next remake

[14:44] from Chicago Gaming Company a wide body game with so much in it.

[14:49] Will they do this?

[14:50] Will this be the next game they remake?

[14:52] Now I know there are some of you out there that are like there are so many Twilight Zones

[14:56] out in the world.

[14:57] It doesn't matter.

[14:58] Like if you make a brand new Twilight Zone with some new code and the wide screen and

[15:04] modern lights and everything and a topper you're going to sell a ton of them.

[15:08] You are absolutely going to sell a ton of them.

[15:11] But here's the thing I think the one thing I was wrong with in my rumor is the dates.

[15:15] Because we both know that Chicago Gaming Company takes forever to get games out.

[15:20] And the other part that's like well then when is Ben Hex game in the mix of all of this?

[15:25] If you're a Chicago Gaming Company fan you have the greatest patience on planet Earth.

[15:30] Now I still think if they come out even if it's single level pulp fiction will do really

[15:37] well especially if they're making this game with Tarantino.

[15:40] Now the questions remain how much of the movie can they show in the pin considering you've

[15:45] got all of those actors and do they need to get the rights for all of those actors.

[15:50] So you cannot make a pulp fiction pinball machine unless you license all of the music

[15:56] from the movie because the soundtrack along with the film scenes is what makes that movie

[16:01] so special.

[16:02] I want to say this.

[16:03] I still think a single level pulp fiction game that's supposed to be like a throwback

[16:09] looking pinball machine is a total miss.

[16:12] It's a total missed opportunity.

[16:15] That movie deserves a multi-leveled game with ramps and toys with all of the modern goodies

[16:21] we want to see in a pinball machine.

[16:24] Like if Jersey Jack pinball made pulp fiction we would be doing backflips.

[16:29] You know a single level game by Mark Ritchie I just don't think it's what people want.

[16:34] And again who knows when we'll see it but I'm hearing that pulp fiction is done and

[16:39] we will see it sometime in the near future.

[16:42] Twilight Zone would be probably I would have to say Twilight Zone would be like two years

[16:47] from now like 2024 if we see Twilight Zone but I haven't heard anyone else say Twilight

[16:53] Zone so you heard it here first on Canada.

[16:56] The other rumor I heard is that Jersey Jack pinball has closed down their factory tours.

[17:01] Well that's not a rumor but here's what I heard this week.

[17:04] They have both lines going working on Toy Story right now so it's not just going to be one

[17:09] line making Toy Story it's going to be two lines making Toy Story.

[17:13] And so that gets interesting right.

[17:15] So are they going to be doing the ellies of Toy Story on one line and the collector's

[17:20] editions on the other line that seems to make sense if they do it that way.

[17:25] What I know is this they're going to get so many orders for Toy Story it is going to inundate

[17:31] them even more than Guns and Roses like even more.

[17:34] And so I hope Jersey Jack does themselves a favor and announces we're only making this

[17:40] many this year.

[17:42] I think they need to put a cap on how many orders they take.

[17:46] They probably won't because if you're them you're looking out into the pinball world

[17:51] and you're seeing stuff like people waited a year for Fathom.

[17:55] People are waiting like nine months for Godzilla.

[17:57] So we might as well take that $1,000 non-refundable deposit and like lock in 5,000 orders right.

[18:07] 5,000 times a thousand dollars is what like five million dollars in non-refundable pre-order

[18:15] money.

[18:16] So I think they are absolutely going to take non-refundable deposits and sell as many Toy

[18:21] Stories on day one as they can.

[18:24] And if you're Jersey Jack the greatest time to take those orders is when you show that

[18:29] sizzle reel video.

[18:30] Remember how good that Guns and Roses video was?

[18:33] Well I expect the same if not better from Toy Story.

[18:37] The Toy Story one can't be as good though.

[18:39] I mean they have that super attractive woman rocking out to a pinball machine.

[18:44] It was the greatest single pinball piece of content I've ever seen.

[18:48] I've never seen anything better than that.

[18:50] Like nothing sold a pinball machine better than that video.

[18:53] Right, remember the lame dialed in one where like the guy pulls the cellphone out of his

[18:57] pocket and starts flipping and was like, oh now I really don't want it right.

[19:00] Alright so that's happening.

[19:02] We also heard like American Pinball has a really weird like new strategy with their

[19:07] deluxe machines.

[19:08] Did you hear what they're doing?

[19:09] They're trying to create FOMO around Oktoberfest and Houdini and Hot Wheels.

[19:14] Three titles people don't really want that many more of.

[19:17] But in this climate in which there's no inventory I think David Fix is somewhat confused.

[19:21] I think he thinks there's more demand than there really is but he's actually looking

[19:26] at this industry in a vacuum that's about to burst.

[19:29] But here's the thing they are now saying this is the last run of those games built the way

[19:33] you know them and then in the future deluxe models of those three are going to have just

[19:40] like generic black armor.

[19:42] They're going to like make the toys simpler in the games.

[19:45] You know what he's basically saying?

[19:47] Why the next run of these games because they're never going to look like this again.

[19:52] But what's weird about it is he's still saying that the future runs of those games will still

[19:58] be deluxe editions but nothing about that David sounds deluxe.

[20:03] If you're going to make the armor just generic black like a stern pro then how is that a deluxe?

[20:09] You know look all this is just FOMO spin.

[20:11] He did the same thing with Legends of Vahala.

[20:13] I still think the marketing over at AP is all wonky.

[20:17] I really do.

[20:18] I think they don't really have a plan.

[20:19] I think they don't really have a vision.

[20:21] I think for them they need to make the games look better.

[20:24] Those back boxes are pretty hideous and I think they need to focus on that like focus on making

[20:29] your games moving forward.

[20:31] Focus on making them look amazing and stop with all this like we're going to remove this

[20:35] remove that make that black and it's still going to be deluxe.

[20:39] They also need to stop talking about Houdini, Oktoberfest and Hot Wheels.

[20:43] We are past those titles.

[20:45] We don't want more of those titles new and box David.

[20:48] You know why?

[20:49] Because I can go get any three of those titles for $1500 less than new and box.

[20:55] So why do I want to buy a new and box version of the game?

[20:58] American Pimbalm just always so perplexed by the moves they make.

[21:01] And what do we think the Dennis Nordman game is?

[21:03] Do we think it's going to be Sherlock Holmes with Christopher Franche on artwork?

[21:07] That's kind of where I'm leaning lately.

[21:09] I don't think it's going to be Yukon Yeti.

[21:11] There's no way it's that because Dennis was probably still nervous that Deeproot owns

[21:16] that license.

[21:17] I do think it's going to be Sherlock Holmes.

[21:20] I do think it's going to have Franche on artwork and I think it's going to be loaded

[21:24] with toys and some fun stuff and will it sell well?

[21:28] Well look if you're going to make an original IP game Sherlock Holmes is actually not a bad

[21:33] selection because we all know Sherlock Holmes right?

[21:36] It's not like dialed in original.

[21:38] It's something we're all familiar with.

[21:40] But we'll just have to wait and see and I hear that game is coming out ill timed sometime

[21:45] in August which is when Stern is coming back out with their next title.

[21:50] Now here's what I'm hearing lately that the Stern game in August is going to be James

[21:55] Bond and it makes kind of sense if that's the case because James Bond is going to be

[22:00] a capoe game.

[22:02] It's going to be designed by George Gomez and I think that might make total sense for

[22:07] Stern.

[22:08] It's not with James Bond in August.

[22:11] You charge an arm and a leg for it.

[22:13] Remember this game is going to be a capoe title in which there's only going to be a

[22:16] super le and an le and then maybe a premium.

[22:21] There will be no pro version of this game.

[22:24] I expect there to be versions of James Bond that Stern will sell through its distributors

[22:29] at around Elvira 40th prices.

[22:32] So they are going to give the games to distributors for $15,000 and then distributors can price

[22:38] them as they see fit.

[22:40] Get ready to see distributors test the waters at $30,000.

[22:45] You're hearing it here first.

[22:46] You're going to see this because just think about it.

[22:49] This is Stern's genius plan.

[22:51] They're going to keep doing this.

[22:52] Back to the future.

[22:54] If they re-ran Ghostbusters, if they just re-ran Ghostbusters with a special limited edition

[23:00] and put the topper back on it, they could get $25,000 all day long in this market.

[23:07] I think everyone's just realizing that older millennials and boomers are rich and this is

[23:12] not the most expensive hobby by any means.

[23:16] So all these companies are realizing that their target audience is in the prime earning

[23:21] of their lives.

[23:22] A lot of these guys are multi-millionaires and then some, some are billionaires and they

[23:28] know that this is nothing to them, especially when you zoom out and it's a global market

[23:34] of pinball buyers.

[23:36] If you're going to make a hundred and ninety-nine of something that like a thousand people want,

[23:42] you could charge whatever for it.

[23:45] All you need is a hundred and ninety-nine dudes who have millions of dollars and don't

[23:50] care.

[23:51] That's it.

[23:52] They don't care.

[23:53] They don't care what Keneada says.

[23:54] They don't care if everyone hates on them.

[23:55] They don't care because you know why they don't care?

[23:57] Because they're living in their $15 million house and they're driving $5 million in cars

[24:02] and they don't care what you think.

[24:04] You know what?

[24:05] I would be the same exact way.

[24:07] You think if you're rich, you care what someone on an internet form or a podcast says about

[24:13] your lifestyle choices.

[24:14] You absolutely do not care because as I tell people, the greatest liberator in life, the

[24:21] thing that gives you the most freedom in the world is money.

[24:26] Everybody knows that.

[24:27] It's like this weird thing.

[24:28] You know, I think sometimes, you know, I'm working with a lot of like younger kids these

[24:31] days, right?

[24:32] They're all about their principles and they're all about giving freedom and liberating people

[24:36] and their rights and equality.

[24:37] And I'm like, guys, yes, absolutely.

[24:40] Absolutely we should respect everybody.

[24:42] Absolutely we should give equal opportunity to everybody.

[24:45] But the part that young kids don't get yet is they want to give their money away.

[24:49] They want to give it away when they don't have any.

[24:52] And then they're going to get the rude awakening one day where the only thing that sets you

[24:56] free is the money.

[24:58] Money tells you where you can live, what pinball machine you can buy, what clothes you can

[25:02] wear, where you can go on vacation.

[25:04] It is the ultimate liberator.

[25:06] And look, you should be compensated when you work hard.

[25:09] You should be compensated when you invent something, when you have great ideas, when

[25:14] you add something of value to this world.

[25:17] You should be compensated for.

[25:19] And I'm one of the people I like to look at successful people.

[25:22] I like to say, hey, what did you do to get that way instead of tearing them down and

[25:26] being angry at them all the time?

[25:28] You're going to learn so much more when you ask someone who's been successful in life.

[25:32] How did you get there?

[25:33] What did you do?

[25:34] How can I follow in those footsteps?

[25:36] I mean, my phone's ringing off the hook.

[25:38] Canada, how did you make the first pinball podcast in the world that actually makes money?

[25:42] You know, many times I'm on the phone with the poor man's pinball podcast.

[25:45] How many times Drew calls me up and is like, Canada, how'd you do it?

[25:49] How did you get to this level of success?

[25:52] He's like, Canada, I know you must be eating caviar and lobster, Thermador every night

[25:57] because of your monthly subscription.

[25:59] And I'm like, you're right.

[26:00] True.

[26:01] Congratulations on your guns and roses, Ellie.

[26:03] You are no longer the poor man's pinball podcast.

[26:05] I got a great kick out of Drew's intro to the poor man's show this week.

[26:09] He took all the sound clips from my Facebook live of just questioning how they can still

[26:13] be poor when they're ordering like $30,000 in pinball machines.

[26:16] I'm like, everybody, I hope you have a great weekend.

[26:19] Thank you so much for joining the show.

[26:21] I'm going to keep doing these shows and look, we're going to get new soon.

[26:24] Like something's going to happen.

[26:25] Maybe it's at MGC.

[26:27] Something's going to happen in June.

[26:28] If you just stick with me through May, because I think May is going to be pretty brutal.

[26:33] I think May is just going to be about whether or not people get their fathoms and whether

[26:37] or not like Cactus Canyon, Ellie ships.

[26:40] But if you just stick with me, trust me, together we are going to get to Toy Story's

[26:45] launch together.

[26:47] And then you're going to be able to hear my elation or me screaming in pain at how they

[26:52] messed up Toy Story.

[26:54] So I really can't wait for all of us to go on the journey together.

[26:58] Everybody have a great weekend.

[27:00] We are going to be on the Saturday morning spectacular.

[27:02] Yes, Chris and Canada by Polar Chris is going to be there doing our 90 minute show.

[27:07] If you haven't joined, I highly recommend you join Canada's Pinball podcast on Facebook

[27:12] and you hang out.

[27:13] It's every Saturday morning at 10 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

[27:17] Everybody great weekend.

[27:19] We'll talk to you soon.
