[00:00] Ah, thank God it's Friday, August 8th.

[00:29] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcaster that has multiple pinball

[00:36] machines on order and no place to put them.

[00:40] I've got the next spooky game.

[00:43] If Star Wars is coming out from Stern Pinball, I'm buying an LE of that game.

[00:50] I'm definitely getting Steve Richie's next game.

[00:53] I'm definitely getting back to the future.

[00:56] I'm definitely gonna get, I don't know.

[00:59] Winners if they make that, where am I gonna put all of these games?

[01:04] Do I need to put an extension on the house?

[01:06] I'll probably just keep them in storage for now over at Automated, but man, it is gonna

[01:12] be quite the next 12 months in pinball.

[01:15] If you think about it, if you think about what's about to happen over the next 12 months,

[01:20] we're gonna get Spike 3, we're gonna get the next game from Steve Richie, we're gonna

[01:25] get like 4 to 5 more games from Stern Pinball.

[01:29] We're eventually gonna get back to the future.

[01:32] We're gonna see if Cuphead's ever gonna come out.

[01:34] It's never coming out by the way.

[01:35] Someone asked me yesterday like, hey, where's Cuphead?

[01:37] And I'm like, bend over and I'll show you where Cuphead is.

[01:41] It's never coming out.

[01:43] Mukesh needed to sell all of the inventory that is over at AP before he would make Cuphead.

[01:53] Problem is, everybody knows Galactic Tank Force is terrible.

[01:59] But here's the thing about Galactic Tank Force.

[02:01] When you go into the thread and you listen to people that have it, it's almost become

[02:08] like a cult pinball classic.

[02:10] I mean this.

[02:12] Why do we like some really bad movies?

[02:15] Why do we like them?

[02:17] Because they're so bad, they're good.

[02:20] And I think that is what Galactic Tank Force will end up being.

[02:27] It will always be a game that is so bad that it's good.

[02:33] That it's gonna make you have fun playing it.

[02:35] And that's why we love really bad movies because we know that the directors tried to make a

[02:41] good movie, but they made it really bad and really campy.

[02:45] It's like American Pinball is like the Ed Wood of Pinball.

[02:50] They set out to make really good games.

[02:53] They just never did.

[02:56] When you think about what else was in market, it wasn't like they had a price advantage.

[03:00] It wasn't like they had any real advantage.

[03:02] They needed to make great games and everybody around them just made better games.

[03:08] But more so on Galactic Tank Force because that game has so much cheesiness and it tried

[03:14] so hard to be cheesy with the whole back box folding down into the tank head.

[03:21] I'm driving the damn game around at Pinball shows like it was a tank.

[03:26] It's like the whole thing was a joke.

[03:28] The launch video was the biggest joke.

[03:30] And here's a crazy thing.

[03:32] I think people that own Galactic Tank Force are actually having more fun than people that

[03:38] own John Wick than people that own James Bond 60th.

[03:43] I mean it.

[03:44] I think they're having more fun.

[03:46] When I used to go to Nathan's on Central Avenue in Yonkers and everyone would come

[03:50] with their BMW M3's and their parents' cars and trying to flex, there was always a dude

[03:56] in the parking lot with the biggest beat up, crappiest car doing donuts.

[04:01] And my friend who had a lot of money turned to me and he's like, see that guy there?

[04:05] He's having more fun than all of us.

[04:08] We're all OCD about our cars.

[04:10] We worry about them all the time.

[04:12] That guy's just beating on it and having fun.

[04:15] And I think when you own a Galactic Tank Force, you just beat on it and have fun.

[04:21] So I don't know where your money's tied up.

[04:23] And I'm in these threads and I'm watching these people talk about this and that.

[04:27] I think a lot of you are probably waiting for Harry Potter.

[04:30] You know what I'm curious with Potter?

[04:32] I'm curious where it's going to end up.

[04:35] And I don't even want to almost play it anymore until it's code complete because I know they're

[04:40] making changes.

[04:41] I know they're going to keep adjusting it.

[04:43] And that's cool.

[04:44] I'm not one of these people that actually likes to see how the sausage is made.

[04:50] I don't want to buy a game, play it, not have it fully complete, wait for them to adjust

[04:55] this, that, wait for them to put in these modes.

[04:58] I don't like that.

[04:59] I don't like getting to points in a game that are incomplete.

[05:03] It's unsatisfying to me, if you will.

[05:05] And I want to experience a Pimball machine like a movie.

[05:08] I want to go to it when it's done.

[05:11] Some people love watching the editing process.

[05:14] They love watching it transform into something new.

[05:18] And there's people in Pimball who absolutely love that.

[05:20] I'm just not one of them.

[05:22] So I want to play Harry Potter when it's done.

[05:26] I want to play King Kong when it's done.

[05:28] I want to play Dune when it's done.

[05:31] Those three games to me are going to be really interesting and even better when they're done.

[05:37] The thing is, they're not going to be done for maybe a year.

[05:41] And I think that's the latest trend in Pimball.

[05:43] We've become a little bit more, maybe we've always been this way in Pimball.

[05:46] It's kind of like the video game industry.

[05:48] They release a game and it's in perpetual beta for many, many months, some games, many,

[05:54] many years.

[05:56] And for those of you out there who bought Batman 66 when it first came out, you know

[05:59] what I'm talking about.

[06:00] It took you two and a half years before your game became amazing.

[06:04] Two and a half years.

[06:08] But Lyman always came through.

[06:11] And we always used to say in Lyman, we trust.

[06:14] Now that's not the case with every game.

[06:17] Not every game keeps getting better and better.

[06:20] Some games never really get past their initial launch magic.

[06:25] If you will, I don't know.

[06:26] Maybe that's the wrong word, but you don't have to say they just never improve.

[06:29] They might put more stuff in it.

[06:31] Doesn't always mean it's getting better and better and better.

[06:34] The latest John Wick code update was like that for a lot of people.

[06:37] It's like they changed some stuff.

[06:39] They made it easier.

[06:41] Some people like that.

[06:42] Some people don't.

[06:43] They added more multi-balls.

[06:45] You can see more of the game.

[06:47] I think for some people, you don't love it because it makes it easier to beat the game.

[06:51] And then when you beat the game, you kind of get a little bit bored.

[06:55] Games like Willy Wonka, they had a really good code adjustment.

[06:59] It wasn't like they added more.

[07:01] They just made it easier to see the magic.

[07:05] And Wonka needed that because people owned Wonka for about a year and a half and they

[07:10] could only get two golden tickets.

[07:13] And if you've got five magical things that you can't wait for people to experience, but

[07:19] nobody gets to experience it, it's kind of pointless.

[07:23] Game like Guns N' Roses, you're not going to get to sympathy or no sympathy for the

[07:27] devil maybe ever.

[07:30] Maybe ever.

[07:31] When I play this game, the only way I can get to it, and I look, I'm not the best person

[07:35] pinball player, but it's really hard to get to it.

[07:38] You got to open up the coin door.

[07:39] Now when I owned Batman, talk about a perfectly coded game.

[07:44] It was a game where you could see everything.

[07:47] You could get to all the final wizard modes.

[07:50] You could see everything on an epic three ball game.

[07:54] And it wasn't impossible.

[07:57] And also what I love about Lyman games is there was so much in it with all the minor

[08:02] villains and you could pick your own adventure and you could go the way you wanted to go

[08:06] or you could go right for those final wizard modes.

[08:11] You know what I'm saying?

[08:12] Like the journey to the end didn't require you to do everything.

[08:16] And some of these more modern games, it's become a lot more challenging ever to see

[08:22] the end of the journey because they make it too far out into the game.

[08:26] And there's too much you have to do.

[08:28] I mean, imagine in Jaws, you had to do everything before you battle Jaws.

[08:32] Then no one's going to battle Jaws.

[08:34] And it was interesting because Stern started this strategy with Jurassic Park, I think was

[08:38] maybe the first game they did it on.

[08:40] Maybe it was Godzilla even two, where they wanted you to buy the topper as a way to get

[08:46] a shortcut to the final wizard mode.

[08:50] And so if you bought a topper for a thousand or $2,000, that unlocks the final wizard mode.

[08:56] You know, there's a lot of worry over at Stern Pinball that they would do DLC downloadable

[09:01] content and they were going to get us all on inside or connected.

[09:06] They were going to connect all their games.

[09:08] They were going to know everything about us as players because our machines are now connected.

[09:12] And then they were going to sell us additional modes, additional software.

[09:18] They have yet to do it.

[09:20] It is the final frontier, I believe, in Stern's overall marketing strategy.

[09:26] Let's get hundreds of thousands of games online, get them all connected, all on the same hardware,

[09:34] all running the same system, and then we do it.

[09:39] Because if you think about the untapped potential, just from a revenue standpoint, if Stern Pinball

[09:45] could actually do that, think about a video game console.

[09:50] What do you pay for when you buy a video game console?

[09:52] You buy the unit, okay, and then you buy the game.

[09:55] But what else do you buy?

[09:57] Because you could just buy an Xbox and never go online and just play games offline.

[10:02] They make most of their money on the annual subscription to Xbox Live.

[10:09] When you think about Pinball, imagine if Stern actually made online and competitive and versus

[10:17] play a real thing, of course every single one of us would sign up to have that ability.

[10:25] I don't know if it's coming.

[10:26] I don't think it's coming.

[10:27] I feel like it's 2025.

[10:29] It's about to be 2026 and six months.

[10:32] And we still don't really have any single pinball company with great online connectivity.

[10:37] I think the one who does it the best is probably Multimorphic.

[10:41] They actually have games that are versus games.

[10:44] And those games, if you've ever played them at a pinball show, are a lot of fun.

[10:49] I mean, they're a lot of fun.

[10:51] I mean, they're not fun enough for me to write a check for $10,000, but they're a lot of fun.

[10:55] Where are the portals?

[10:57] Did anyone get a portal yet?

[10:59] When that game came out, yeah, but where is it?

[11:01] Where is it?

[11:02] You got to shift the games.

[11:03] Where are these medieval madness, Merlin editions?

[11:06] Nobody knows where those games are at.

[11:08] I see people in the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland thread.

[11:11] There's like a troll in there who won't shut up.

[11:14] And I don't know why they don't just moderate and get rid of these guys.

[11:17] And look, for those people complaining, say they want to refund, you knew what you were getting into.

[11:23] You can get a refund on January 1st.

[11:26] Other than that, shut up.

[11:28] It's August 8th.

[11:30] You still got to give Dutch the next six months or so to make your game shut up.

[11:37] You are grown men who entered into a contract and you'll get your money back then if you don't get your game.

[11:46] The thing about Alice is this.

[11:47] I know people say that me and Carrie shield the game.

[11:50] When I read about people who have it, they really enjoy it.

[11:55] Isn't that why we're here?

[11:58] Pinball machines that make us have a good time.

[12:03] Pinball content creators that are entertaining.

[12:07] A hobby that 99% of humanity doesn't care about.

[12:13] But you and I found friends and family inside this incredible hobby.

[12:18] Right?

[12:18] We're here to have a good time.

[12:21] Somebody tell this to the content creators who won't shake hands with Gnade.

[12:27] He's difficult on my mental health.

[12:29] Grown men having mental health problems because of pinball content creators.

[12:34] Gnade, you did it again.

[12:36] You're supposed to be sorry and you're making fun of the grown men who can't just stop taking this so seriously.

[12:43] They really do.

[12:45] You see these guys?

[12:46] Like everywhere they go, I got to go play pinball.

[12:48] I got to go.

[12:49] If I'm in Paris, I'm playing pinball.

[12:50] If I'm in Tokyo, I'm looking for pinball.

[12:53] Do me a favor.

[12:54] When you travel, don't play pinball.

[12:56] Go enjoy the culture.

[12:58] Go enjoy the food.

[13:00] Go enjoy the people.

[13:01] Go enjoy the scenery because pinball is available everywhere.

[13:06] And why would you waste a minute of your time when you're in a new place, in a new culture, around new people,

[13:13] staring down at something that's in your home?

[13:16] It is absolutely a name behavior.

[13:18] And also go to the gym.

[13:20] Go to the gym.

[13:20] As I say, do as many push-ups and pull-ups as you do plunges.

[13:25] And this hobby would be ripped left and right.

[13:28] All right, what else is going on in the world of pinball?

[13:30] Should we look at what's for sale on pinside for a lot of money?

[13:33] Let's do it.

[13:34] Let's see if there's any new games that have popped up for sale.

[13:37] You know, by the way, I mean it when I say it.

[13:39] The game that I would go grab, because I do think they might actually make less of these than the LE,

[13:49] I think Jaws 50th is going to be the game that not now, it doesn't feel like it now because they're still making it.

[13:57] But I think a year from now, I think it's what, like 9600 now, I think if you buy it,

[14:04] it's going to go up in value because I think they're going to make less than 1000.

[14:07] Because you got to remember, like anyone who really wanted a Jaws has one.

[14:12] And so now they come out with this game.

[14:15] I don't think there's a thousand new pinball people that want a Jaws.

[14:20] There's not.

[14:21] You know who got burned really, really bad.

[14:24] We don't even talk about this.

[14:25] Who got burned really bad?

[14:27] Anyone who owns a Jaws premium.

[14:30] You guys got the shaft.

[14:33] If you bought a pro, you don't care.

[14:35] You always got it for a low price.

[14:36] But if you bought a Jaws premium for 9600 because you wanted all the mechs and you didn't care about the LE for 13,

[14:45] man, nobody's going to want your version of Jaws.

[14:48] I'm just saying.

[14:49] All right.

[14:49] For sale in the world of pinball.

[14:51] Right now, there is an Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[14:55] It looks like it has a topper on it for $13,783, which is the exact amount of money it costs to bring this game to his front door.

[15:07] Pinsider Bement, who's in Colorado.

[15:09] Bement's been on Pinside for a while.

[15:11] He has a lot of games.

[15:12] He said he's selling because of expenses.

[15:16] Unfortunately, because of life and expenses, he's selling this game.

[15:20] It is always crazy to me that you would ever have to sell a pinball machine to raise money.

[15:26] You know how I feel.

[15:27] Like you shouldn't be buying this stuff if you don't have like enough money to afford life.

[15:33] Like it's just crazy to me.

[15:35] But he's selling it for $13,783 or best offer.

[15:41] Wow.

[15:41] I mean, he's acting like he thinks it's going to be worth less.

[15:43] Now, the thing is there is a few Alice spots for sale right now, but none of them are in a box like this one.

[15:49] This one's brand new.

[15:49] I think you just took the box off it.

[15:51] If you want an Alice right now, and this is what everyone else is going to pay.

[15:57] This is an interesting test to see how long this game stays available for sale.

[16:01] He's not even making a profit.

[16:03] So if you want to cut the line on Alice, now is your chance.

[16:07] All right.

[16:07] Let's look at what's going on.

[16:08] I like to go for the high price stuff.

[16:10] We've still got that kiss.

[16:11] L.E. for 15,000 or best offer.

[16:15] Nobody's buying that.

[16:16] We've got an arrow Smith L.E. with the topper for $13,450.

[16:22] Nobody's going to buy that.

[16:24] We've got an Elvira house of horrors 40th anniversary edition that is sale pending for 14,500.

[16:33] Is that a good buy?

[16:34] It's not a bad buy considering that Elvira is a great game.

[16:40] The 40th is beautiful and brand new stern elites that have way more units are selling for $13,000.

[16:50] Thing is with Elvira, they just made so many variations that I think all of them don't feel special.

[16:57] Now that's kind of how I feel.

[16:59] I feel like they ruin that game with too many different versions of it.

[17:04] There's an evil dead with extras.

[17:06] Spooky pinball man.

[17:07] Did you ever think in a million years we'd see a spooky pinball game for sale for $15,000?

[17:16] That was the original asking price of Batman's super limited edition.

[17:21] We've got another Elvira house of horrors, the blood red kiss edition with the topper for $12,900.

[17:27] I don't think that's going to sell.

[17:29] A pirate to the Caribbean LE for $21,000.

[17:32] A pirate to the Caribbean CE.

[17:34] In case that LE wasn't enough for $27,500.

[17:41] And below that, a Batman super LE which is in Philadelphia PA.

[17:47] But you have to go look at this machine.

[17:49] The guy kind of ruined it.

[17:50] He put all this stuff on it.

[17:51] He changed the front decals.

[17:53] Like who does that?

[17:54] He wants 35,000 or best offer.

[17:59] 35,000.

[18:01] I bought my Batman SLE just a couple years ago.

[18:04] Unmolested for 25,000.

[18:07] So I don't think he's going to get anywhere near 35.

[18:12] Metallica remastered LE.

[18:14] $15,000 opened up.

[18:17] Another evil dead for 15,000.

[18:20] A Jurassic Park 30th for 14,000.

[18:23] We have a Metallica remastered in a box for 17,000.

[18:28] A Big Bang bar for 24,500.

[18:33] So here's another Metallica remastered.

[18:36] $13,999 firm.

[18:39] Okay.

[18:40] So this guy's got the game.

[18:42] It's in mint condition and he only wants $1,000 over the 13K.

[18:49] This is my friend Frank DiAngelo selling his LE.

[18:53] Here's the thing.

[18:54] If there's one for sale for basically 14,000 firm, how do you list one in a box

[19:01] for 17,000?

[19:02] How do you actually think you're going to get $3,000 more because yours is still

[19:10] in a box?

[19:12] And then the other one is for sale for 15.

[19:14] So you know, you got to really look at the market.

[19:17] We've got a James Bond 60th for 13,000 sale pending.

[19:22] All right.

[19:22] Someone wants it.

[19:23] I've always found James Bond 60th to be very underwhelming.

[19:27] It looks cheap.

[19:28] It plays whatever.

[19:29] You know, it's not an exciting game to shoot.

[19:31] It plays like more of a classic solid state game.

[19:35] The scoring real thing just seems silly.

[19:38] It's like a solution in search of a problem.

[19:40] I never understood that game really.

[19:42] I never did.

[19:43] Stranger Things premium for 13,500.

[19:45] What is this?

[19:46] What kind of person?

[19:48] Oh, it's Canadian dollars, but still still no one's paying that for a Stranger

[19:52] Things premium wizard of Oz.

[19:55] Remember when you could go get a waz for 6,500 brand new?

[19:58] Remember when you could go get a waz even after it was all said and done?

[20:02] The Wizard of Oz Emerald City additions were somewhere around like 7,500 bucks

[20:08] for like four or five years.

[20:10] Now this person wants $13,000 firm.

[20:15] Now what's interesting is this, when you put a waz next to a Harry Potter,

[20:20] like let's be honest, you put a waz next to a Harry Potter, which one looks more

[20:25] expensive, which one has more in it?

[20:28] Of course the Wizard of Oz.

[20:29] Now which one shoots better is definitely Harry Potter, which one has more

[20:33] assets, Harry Potter, which one's a better theme, Harry Potter.

[20:36] But still, Harry Potter collectors edition for 15 kind of does make a Wizard of Oz

[20:44] feel like a $13,000 game.

[20:46] Jaws LE.

[20:48] Here we go, people.

[20:50] Here we go.

[20:51] Jaws LE.

[20:52] How much you think?

[20:54] $12,995.

[20:58] So Jaws is not going up in price.

[21:01] Definitely the 50th anniversary has hurt the resale a little bit of a Jaws LE.

[21:07] But here's the important part about this for sale.

[21:11] Machine has been on location at a pizza parlor.

[21:16] So that is a humongous detail.

[21:20] Nobody wants to route a game.

[21:22] Nobody.

[21:22] Nobody wants to route it new game.

[21:24] You might want to route it old game and restore it.

[21:27] But if a Jaws LE routed is 13, that's good news for everyone who has a Jaws LE.

[21:33] It's very good news.

[21:34] That means a non routed home use only is definitely worth thousands more than that.

[21:39] The Avatar the Battle for Pandora CE 13 firm.

[21:44] Come on, guys.

[21:45] You can't sell an avatar with the word firm in the price.

[21:51] You take whatever somebody will give you.

[21:55] It has no demand.

[21:58] Here's a dumb one.

[21:59] Pirates of the Caribbean CE, right?

[22:02] Wasn't there just one up top for $27,000?

[22:05] This guy wants $39,000 or best offer.

[22:08] $39,000 or best offer.

[22:12] What?

[22:14] I just, I just got to stop there.

[22:16] There's another pirate CE for $29,000 right below it.

[22:18] $29,000 right below it.

[22:21] It is just bonkers.

[22:23] I'll end on this one.

[22:23] This is never selling.

[22:24] You ready?

[22:25] John Wick, Ellie and a box for $13,000.

[22:27] Get at a dodge.

[22:29] Everybody look, these prices are still stupid.

[22:32] I thought by now there would be more common sense and there's not.

[22:37] I think this hobby has kind of doomed itself to just thinking

[22:42] everything is worth this much.

[22:44] It's not.

[22:45] Stuff is not moving at these prices.

[22:47] And I think everybody needs to get back to reality.

[22:50] It was so much more fun when we were not this greedy.

[22:55] When you had a Ghostbusters LE for $8,500 and then you went to

[22:58] list it for like 10.

[23:00] Now you see a Ghostbusters LE, $15,000, $18,500 firm.

[23:05] You know, there'll be a dude selling it for $15,000 and you list

[23:08] yours for $18,500 firm.

[23:10] We're not making that much more money.

[23:12] Everything we really need in life is a lot more expensive.

[23:15] Everyone needs to chill with these prices and come back down to reality.

[23:19] What's happening is because the new unboxed games are so expensive,

[23:23] that's lifting everything else up.

[23:27] It's like if Porsche decides to make the base 9-11, $150,000, then

[23:34] your Porsche GTS that was $150,000 is now worth $180,000.

[23:38] That's what's happening in Pinball.

[23:40] It's not sustainable.

[23:42] It's crippling Porsche and it's going to cripple Pinball.

[23:45] Everybody have an awesome Friday.

[23:47] We'll talk to you soon.
