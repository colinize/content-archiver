[00:00] So we are again in the middle of the night

[00:04] With dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator

[00:09] Like down the stairs I was there

[00:12] I remember it all too well

[00:24] Ah, welcome to episode, I don't know, 600 and something of Canadian Spinball podcast

[00:29] I'm your host, Canada, happy Saturday morning everybody

[00:32] I want to say it's November

[00:34] And this is the time of year when we really start to get into the holiday mindset

[00:39] We start to get much more thankful

[00:41] And I don't know about you and what's going on in your world

[00:44] But I've had some really close friends

[00:47] They've had some health issues, I've had some family members with some health issues

[00:51] And it makes me super, super appreciative

[00:55] That we get to spend this time away from all the real trauma

[00:59] Away from all the real hardships

[01:01] And we get to just geek out about pinball

[01:03] And I'm super thankful for each and every one of you who listens to Canada Spinball podcast

[01:08] And I do want to give a shout out to the fact that we now have 243 people on Patreon

[01:15] And we have 3,000 listeners

[01:17] And my goal, my goal is by TPS to get to 300 people on the Canadian Club on Patreon

[01:23] And I want to give a shout out to Simon, to Jason, to Johnny Cage, to Thomas B, to Andres R, to Donk, Max M, Hadley, Vince C, Joseph M,

[01:36] Shane's Random Universe, Scotty, Marcus S, James H, Nicholas P

[01:42] You guys are the new Canadian Club members, thank you so much

[01:45] And I really do appreciate it because it does take a lot of time

[01:48] Especially with killing in my world

[01:50] Finding time to do this show has been harder than ever, but I love doing it

[01:55] And that is why I'm here right now

[01:56] And thank you so much to everyone who contributes

[01:58] And if you're listening, deep down inside

[02:00] If you've heard like 600 episodes of Canadian Spinball podcast

[02:04] And $5 a month is too much for you

[02:08] Something's wrong, something's wrong

[02:09] You shouldn't be in the pinball hobby if that's the case

[02:12] Okay, so here's what we're gonna do on this fun episode

[02:14] I'm gonna go down and talk about each manufacturer

[02:17] I'm gonna talk about what's going on over there

[02:19] I'm also gonna deliver if I know some news and rumors on those manufacturers

[02:24] I'm gonna let you know what I've been hearing

[02:27] And there's been a lot

[02:28] And there have been some news rumors and speculations you haven't heard yet

[02:32] And I wanna read a really interesting email I got from someone who listens to the show

[02:37] About the Godzilla vs. Led Zeppelin Bomb

[02:42] Because I've been saying that the bomb on both games is very close

[02:46] Very, very close

[02:48] And how could Keith L. Winn make a game with so much in it?

[02:51] And Steve Richie gave us a Baron Led Zeppelin

[02:54] I think you're gonna see when I read this email

[02:57] That the parts used in each

[02:59] You start to see how well maybe that's the case

[03:01] And maybe Keith L. Winn is super smart on how he allocates the budget into his game

[03:07] Alright, so let's just go down a list and talk about what's happening at each manufacturer

[03:11] And I'm pulling up Pinside and I'm gonna go down the list by game manufacturers

[03:15] And the first one is Stern Pimball

[03:19] Always at the top, always at the top of the Pimball world

[03:21] So what's happening over at Stern Pimball?

[03:23] So Godzilla's are going out the door

[03:26] I think almost all Godzilla LEDs have gone out the door to date

[03:31] And I don't know about you

[03:33] But it is absolutely amazing to see how quickly Stern Pimball can make Pimball machines

[03:39] I think they're at a point now where they are cranking out 500 machines a week

[03:45] A week that is absolutely insanity

[03:49] It means they could make all of Spooky's games in three weeks

[03:53] Which takes Spooky Pimball pretty much 18 months

[03:58] 18 months Stern Pimball can do it in three weeks

[04:01] It almost makes you wonder why are there so many Pimball companies that are slowly building games?

[04:07] Why don't they just contract Stern to make their games?

[04:09] No, they don't do that, but you know it's crazy how fast an efficient Stern Pimball is

[04:13] It's also exciting because what Stern Pimball realizes is that there is a window of excitement and hype

[04:20] When you buy a product, you don't want to have to wait a really long time for it

[04:25] Especially a Pimball machine

[04:27] You want to sort of unbox it, experience it, and play it when the game is the hot new game

[04:33] A year from now, we all know this

[04:35] A year from now, Godzilla will not be the talk of the Pimball world

[04:39] A year from now, you won't want to get your Godzilla

[04:42] But here's the unfortunate thing

[04:44] We are about to head into a year

[04:46] In which there's going to be even more supply shortages

[04:50] And so if you place an order for Godzilla Premium 2 day

[04:54] Distributors are telling customers you might not get your game until November of 2022

[05:01] So are you willing to wait that long to get your next game?

[05:05] We're going to talk about this because I think waiting for games and the supply shortage

[05:10] And the delays in getting your game is going to be the reason why

[05:14] The main reason why we are going to see more inflation in the Pimball hobby next year

[05:20] People are going to want to spend more money to get the game today

[05:23] If you have a Pimball machine, new in box

[05:25] Like if you have a Godzilla Premium, new in box right now

[05:29] You're going to be able to sell it to somebody else for more than you paid

[05:33] Same is true with all the LEDs and even the pros

[05:36] A game new in box in 2022 is going to be worth about 20 to 30% more than you paid for it

[05:43] Because there's going to be such a backlog on manufacturing

[05:47] Across the board people, not just Stern, across the board

[05:51] So Godzilla LEDs are shipping, premiums are shipping, pros are shipping

[05:56] And I will say unanimously

[05:59] I go into the Godzilla threads and I am seeing nothing

[06:02] I mean nothing but high praise for this game

[06:06] It's also the reason why Godzilla is now rated the number one Pimball machine of all time

[06:12] It has beat out medieval madness

[06:14] Now nobody really takes the pin-side rankings very seriously

[06:18] Because it's all new owners, it's all new owners, right?

[06:22] And that honeymoon phase where they're giving the game 9s and 10s across the board

[06:27] But it is too soon to say that this is the best Pimball machine of all time

[06:31] Is it really better than Lord the Rings?

[06:34] Is it really better than Tron?

[06:36] Is it really better than Medieval madness?

[06:39] Is it really better than Indiana Jones?

[06:41] Is it or is it too soon to say?

[06:43] Now look, all these modern games, all these modern games

[06:47] They have better artwork, they have better animations, they have better music

[06:50] They have better callouts for the most part

[06:52] I mean, Stern really is firing on all cylinders in this game

[06:57] Is this game on a mechanical level more impressive than Bali Williams games from back in the day?

[07:04] The answer is still no, but I would argue that this game probably shoots better

[07:09] And has more interesting shots and more interesting geometry

[07:13] So you add that up with better artwork

[07:16] You add it up with amazing modern LCDs and sound systems and all this stuff

[07:21] And I highly recommend anyone out there to put a pin woofer system into this game

[07:26] When you put the pin woofer system into any modern game, whether it's Guns and Roses or Godzilla

[07:32] The sound in your game will wake up in a way in which you can't imagine

[07:38] There is so much in these games sound wise that usually doesn't come at the player

[07:44] with the stock setup of the speakers

[07:46] And so when you add the pin woofer system, these games really pop

[07:50] And I've heard from everyone who's installed it, it's amazing

[07:53] And so I'm not even getting paid by them

[07:55] Look, Kinne does doing promotions for companies that are not even giving him a dime

[07:59] So Godzilla's are shipping

[08:01] What's next from Stern?

[08:03] 1000% it is John Borg's Rush

[08:07] Now here's the thing with Rush

[08:09] Rush is a game that is very polarizing

[08:11] I think half of you don't want it

[08:13] Another third of you don't even care

[08:15] And there's one third of you that is excited about Rush

[08:20] Now for Rush to be successful, they only probably have to sell

[08:23] I'm going to say Rush L.E.'s are going to be 500

[08:26] There is no way they're going to make a 1000 Rush L.E.'s

[08:30] I would be shocked

[08:32] I would be so shocked if they make a 1000 Rush L.E.'s

[08:36] There is crossover between Pimball fans and Rush fans

[08:40] A thousand of them at 10-5, I don't think so

[08:43] It's going to be interesting, right?

[08:45] Will Rush be priced at $10,500?

[08:48] I do think it will be

[08:50] Because Stern in the past, once they raised their prices, that's it

[08:55] That's the new basement pricing for all their games

[08:58] They've never, ever, raised their prices on GameA

[09:02] And then the next game came out

[09:03] And even if the theme wasn't as good, they will not lower the price

[09:08] You paid the same amount of money

[09:10] For a Black Knight L.E. as you did for a Mandalorian L.E.

[09:14] And Black Knight wasn't an expensive license

[09:17] So I fully expect Rush to be a $10,500 L.E.

[09:22] I don't think they're going to make a 1000

[09:25] I think they're going to go back to making 500

[09:27] It does create an interesting debate if you will

[09:31] Is how does Stern manage the amount of L.E.s moving forward?

[09:36] Does it make sense to keep changing the number

[09:38] And sliding that L.E. scale

[09:40] Depending on the popularity of the theme

[09:43] Now I want to say that I said on a Facebook live that I thought that Keith L.E.s next game

[09:48] This is a rumor was going to be back to the future

[09:51] And since I said that, I've been getting more sort of information from people saying that it's not back to the future

[09:58] That back to the future is not being made by Stern Pimbal

[10:02] And this title back to the future

[10:04] Would we all love Keith L.E. to make back to the future?

[10:07] Absolutely

[10:08] Back to the future is like the modern day version of like Tron Vault Edition

[10:13] You just hear about it every single month and then nothing happens

[10:17] And I do think that back to the future would be an incredible title

[10:21] I think it's something that everyone would want

[10:24] I think it's the perfect theme for Pimbal

[10:26] But I also think that it might not happen

[10:29] And so if it does happen, the good news is it's a year from now

[10:33] And if it's going to happen, you know we're going to get more solid and legitimate rumors about it

[10:39] And people are going to start to see it over at Stern

[10:42] And that's how leaks happen

[10:44] People will see the game at Stern

[10:46] There has to be vendors working on parts outside of Stern

[10:50] And this hobby loves to talk

[10:52] And so I don't know

[10:54] I really don't know definitively

[10:56] I'm going to say it on my main show

[10:58] I do not know if back to the future is actually coming out

[11:02] I'm also going to tell you Stern's next game after Rush

[11:05] And people are starting to get really close on guessing it

[11:08] Now the next game after Rush, I'm going to tell you exactly what the theme is

[11:13] on January 1st, it is going to be Brian Eddie's next game

[11:16] I will just say this because people are already starting to guess this

[11:19] And I just want to confirm it on Canadian Spinball Podcast

[11:22] The next game after Rush is going to be another Marvel game

[11:29] And I've been alluding to this

[11:30] Like what's the one thing you really don't want more of?

[11:32] It's another Marvel game

[11:35] It's not a Disney game, it's a Marvel game

[11:38] And it's going to be a Marvel comic book style game

[11:43] Now there's a lot of characters in the Marvel Universe

[11:46] And so good luck guessing which one it is

[11:49] But I will tell you exactly which Marvel comic book game it is on January 1st

[11:55] Unless Jody Dankberg comes at me first with a bribe

[11:58] Okay, you're going to hear it on Canadian Spinball Podcast

[12:01] And I'll say that it's probably going to be Brian Eddie

[12:03] And I think it's going to be Randy Martinez on artwork

[12:07] I think that's how it's going to go

[12:09] But I do think because it's comic book style artwork

[12:11] I think Zambi Yeti would be the best one to use for this game

[12:14] But we'll see what happens

[12:15] Now after that, Stern Pimball is going to come out with James Bond

[12:20] And James Bond is going to be a Kamikau game

[12:23] And so James Bond is going to be super cool

[12:26] I'm hoping Christopher Franci does the artwork on James Bond

[12:30] But that is going to be what Stern does

[12:32] So the order is going to be Rush

[12:34] Then a Brian Eddie Marvel comic book game

[12:37] Then we're going to see James Bond

[12:39] Then we're going to see Keith Owens next

[12:41] And when you think about Stern's lineup

[12:43] It starts to get into this interesting pattern

[12:46] That Owens is the king

[12:48] And so if you think about where you're going to spend your money

[12:50] And what you're going to buy

[12:52] It's almost like everyone now is just waiting for Owens next game

[12:57] His games have more prominence

[12:59] His games are the ones that are the most exciting to see come out

[13:04] And if you're John Borg or Brian Eddie or George Gomez

[13:08] You're chasing after what Elwyn has right now

[13:11] And Stern Pimball is not stupid

[13:12] They're a family and they're a team

[13:14] They don't compete like we might think they do

[13:17] They don't

[13:18] Like everyone wins when these games do well

[13:20] Everyone wins at Stern when these games are on the line consistently

[13:24] And they have such a backlog of games

[13:26] That there is absolutely nothing Stern can do to fail

[13:29] They have so many orders they need to make

[13:32] There is no way they can fail

[13:34] Rush can't be a failure

[13:36] There is no way it can be a failure

[13:38] Even if they just make 2000 rush games

[13:40] That's still successful because the line is always moving

[13:44] Stern Pimball only looks at the line

[13:46] If Rush is not a huge success

[13:48] Guess what?

[13:49] They'll just make more Godzilla's

[13:51] They'll just make more Mandalorians

[13:53] They'll make more Elvirus

[13:54] Speaking of Elvira

[13:55] Where is the 40th Elvirus?

[13:57] Are they unboxing?

[13:58] I don't know

[13:59] You know

[14:00] If you fell into the Elvira 40th hype

[14:03] You see how fast it's already gone

[14:04] It's like they showed it before Expo

[14:07] There was all this hoopla about it

[14:10] Now nobody really cares

[14:12] This is Pimball

[14:13] Nobody really cares

[14:14] Elvirus is still a great game

[14:16] But there's nothing about this that makes the game any better

[14:19] And there is gonna come a point

[14:21] And I mean this

[14:22] In which the FOMO

[14:24] And all the running to these rare versions of the game

[14:27] I do think we're all starting to feel like some fatigue

[14:30] And some expiration date on this kind of Pimball

[14:33] And that most people are saying

[14:34] Yeah I want to buy a game with all the cool stuff in it

[14:37] I don't want to keep chasing after the latest limited version

[14:40] Because if we keep doing that

[14:42] And we all know this

[14:43] If we keep buying the 40th of this

[14:45] And the yellow brick road of that

[14:47] And then if they do another Guns and Roses edition

[14:49] And then if they do a Green with NB Godzilla edition

[14:52] If they keep doing this

[14:54] All that's gonna do is make nothing really special

[14:57] And we're seeing it

[14:58] We're absolutely seeing it

[15:00] Okay so that's what's going on over at Storm Pimball

[15:02] Let's go to Jersey Jack Pimball

[15:04] So what is the news over at JJP?

[15:07] So JJP is a company that is still

[15:10] Still making Guns and Roses

[15:12] They will be making Guns and Roses until the day we die

[15:15] I mean this is their most popular game

[15:18] This is their coolest game

[15:20] This is one of the coolest Pimball machines of all time

[15:23] There is no arguing that

[15:24] I still think G&R is JJP's best pin

[15:28] I absolutely do

[15:29] Without it out

[15:30] Playfield issues aside

[15:32] It's one of the best pins they've ever made

[15:34] It is the best music pin of all time

[15:36] Without it out

[15:37] I don't care what anyone says

[15:39] I know that Iron Maiden Metallica and ACDCR great games

[15:42] But I would argue that this is the greatest music pin ever

[15:46] Because this machine creatively

[15:48] puts a concert in a box like no other game

[15:51] And when you play this game it's super cool

[15:53] When you watch someone play this game

[15:54] It's as cool

[15:56] Which is amazing

[15:57] I don't think you've ever seen a game that's as exciting to play as it is to watch

[16:00] And that's just a testament to Eric putting that concert in a box

[16:03] Okay, so what's next from them?

[16:05] So Toy Story is next

[16:07] The question is when

[16:09] When will we see Toy Story?

[16:10] Now I'm hearing is that we won't see Toy Story

[16:13] To late spring early summer

[16:16] So you're looking around May June to see this game

[16:20] I don't think they're going to show it by T-P-F

[16:22] I really don't

[16:23] And I think the big issue is going to be supply shortages

[16:26] And part shortages

[16:28] I think the game is most likely done

[16:30] But I don't think we're going to see it until later in the spring

[16:34] And then when is Eric's next game?

[16:36] Now I'm hearing Eric's next game is pretty much complete

[16:39] I know what it is

[16:41] I'm going to get confirmation on it

[16:42] But I have a very good source that comes from within the halls of Jersey Jack Pimbal

[16:47] I'll tell you this

[16:48] It's not the Matrix

[16:50] It's not Harry Potter

[16:51] It is based on a movie

[16:53] It is based on a movie that has more than one installment

[16:58] That's as much as I'm going to tell you right now

[17:00] And the reason why

[17:02] We are so far away from this game

[17:04] Like it is not coming out anytime soon

[17:07] Now I could throw it out there and we could know what it is

[17:09] Like we knew what Guns of Roses was for years

[17:12] We knew what Toy Story was for years

[17:14] We knew these games

[17:15] You know because Jersey Jack Pimbal only works on one game at a time

[17:20] A lot of people are working on it

[17:22] And so it's a lot easier to find out what it is

[17:25] Now the question is

[17:27] Steve Richie and their new designer over there

[17:29] There's just a lot right

[17:30] There's a lot of designers at JJP

[17:33] And not a lot of manufacturing efficiency

[17:35] But I'm hearing that the second line is up over at Jersey Jack Pimbal

[17:40] And that's a good thing

[17:42] They need two lines going with two separate games at all times

[17:47] They just need it now

[17:48] You know Jersey Jack has a portfolio of games

[17:50] That people still want

[17:52] People will still buy new and box versions of all of their previous games

[17:56] And here's the sad part from a financial standpoint

[18:00] They can't take any of that money

[18:02] They are so under realizing their revenue

[18:05] By not being able to make the hobbit

[18:08] Or Wizard of Oz or dialed in

[18:11] Or Willy Wonka's and most importantly Pirates of the Caribbean

[18:15] Like what are they doing right

[18:16] There are millions of dollars waiting

[18:19] To flow through the door at JJP

[18:22] All they need to do is make the games

[18:25] And these rich guys

[18:26] And you know who you are

[18:27] You want a new inbox game

[18:30] You don't want someone's used game

[18:32] And you definitely don't want to pay $25,000 for a used Pirates

[18:37] Now if you heard on my episode 500 which you didn't

[18:40] The reason why Jersey Jack Pimbal went from wide bodies

[18:43] To standard bodies was Pat Lawler

[18:46] I'm hearing Pat Lawler is retiring after toy story

[18:50] So I think once Pat Lawler retires

[18:53] And this factory becomes run by Steve Richie and probably Eric Minier

[18:57] I think we're gonna see and I hope we see

[19:00] Wide body games return to Jersey Jack Pimbal

[19:03] Because I also hope we see Jersey Jack make new wide body games

[19:07] Because it's fun to see a guy like Eric Minier

[19:11] Load up a wide body game

[19:13] It really is

[19:14] Like for the people who love Pirates they will tell you

[19:17] It doesn't play like a wide body

[19:19] But imagine that game as a standard body

[19:21] It really wouldn't work as well

[19:23] And so when they go back to making wide body games

[19:26] They would be absolutely foolish

[19:29] Not to do a new run of Pirates or the Caribbean

[19:33] And one of the reasons why I want them to rerun Pirates

[19:35] I really want them to rerun Pirates

[19:37] So that all of these fools who think the games are with $25,000

[19:41] Or $30,000 or $40,000

[19:43] I want the game to come back to reality

[19:46] So people can enjoy it

[19:48] I also think it would start to blow up

[19:50] Some of the ridiculous inflated prices

[19:53] Because if you make more Pirates

[19:54] Like that's the game at the top of the inflated

[19:58] Pimbal used marketplace it is

[20:00] It's at the top of that pyramid

[20:02] Like once Pirates of the Caribbean

[20:04] C.E. started selling for $38,000

[20:07] It raised everything up

[20:09] So if you make more of those

[20:11] Then all of a sudden the collectors start to realize

[20:14] Well maybe it's not worth like spending this much money on these games

[20:18] Because they might always rerun stuff

[20:20] And you know and I know

[20:22] They will always rerun stuff

[20:25] Even long after Jersey Jack Pimbal is gone

[20:27] Someone will come out and remake Pirates of the Caribbean

[20:30] That's just the way it's gonna go

[20:31] Because if there's money to be made

[20:33] Somebody will make it

[20:34] Alright let's go on to Spooky Pimbal

[20:36] Next on my list

[20:37] So Spooky Pimbal

[20:39] They're working hard on getting Halloween

[20:41] And Ultraman's out the door

[20:43] I have absolutely no rumors about what's next from Spooky Pimbal

[20:47] They're making around 20 to 22 games a week

[20:51] Now Luke has been on Pinside and said

[20:53] They had some supply shortages

[20:55] And they had a few softer weeks

[20:57] Where they didn't get to that number

[20:59] But they are still on target

[21:00] To make all of these games in 18 months

[21:03] The only issue is this

[21:04] The only issue is this

[21:06] They needed to make 22 games a week to hit that 18 month target

[21:11] So they are hiring more people

[21:12] And finally Spooky has admitted

[21:15] They are hiring more people

[21:17] In the programming department

[21:19] That is good news

[21:21] That is good news

[21:22] Should they have done it a year ago

[21:24] Absolutely

[21:25] They knew they wanted to make 1750 games

[21:28] They knew they needed more staff

[21:30] And so Spooky is a company that needs to grow

[21:32] But for them to grow

[21:33] They have to ensure

[21:35] That they are making all of their customers happy

[21:37] Like these games have to be good

[21:39] And they have to really nail it

[21:41] With the final polish of the code on both of these games

[21:44] They know that

[21:45] Because if it's an underwhelming experience

[21:48] When you look at the quality of games from Jersey Jack

[21:51] And Stern Pimbal

[21:53] And CGC

[21:54] And you look at the competition

[21:56] And all of these games are starting to be around the same price

[22:00] Like 8 to 10 thousand dollars

[22:02] You can get anything in the Pimbal world

[22:05] For Spooky Pimbal to remain competitive

[22:07] They have to deliver on the final product

[22:10] And it's too early to say like

[22:11] Where these games are going to net out

[22:13] And people keep asking me

[22:14] Are you keeping your Ultraman

[22:16] Are you going to stay in on Ultraman number 500

[22:18] And the answer for me is

[22:19] Yes, I'm still in on Ultraman 500

[22:22] Because why would I get out now

[22:24] I have a $2,000 deposit down

[22:26] Okay

[22:27] By the time I owe

[22:28] The remainder of my deposit

[22:30] It'll be a year from now

[22:32] And so I'll get to see how far along the game comes in a year

[22:36] By the time I have to pay

[22:38] The game will be complete

[22:39] There won't be like new code updates coming

[22:42] It will be done

[22:43] And so I'll be able to look at Ultraman

[22:45] In the final version and say

[22:47] Do I want this

[22:48] And if I don't want it

[22:50] Do I think I'm gonna lose money

[22:51] People have been saying

[22:52] Canada, you gotta get out now

[22:53] You're gonna lose money

[22:55] I think like worst case scenario

[22:56] What? I lose 500 bucks

[22:58] Fine

[22:59] I mean so so be it

[23:00] That's not the end of the world

[23:02] It's better than spending $10,000

[23:04] And I realize I don't want it

[23:05] So I'm willing to take that gamble

[23:07] Now it is a gamble

[23:08] It is a gamble

[23:09] Because I will say right now

[23:10] And I just mean this

[23:12] I will say right now

[23:13] The feedback on the games themselves

[23:14] Has been somewhat middle of the road

[23:16] I think some people love them

[23:18] Those are the people that bottom

[23:19] And need to convince themselves

[23:20] They love them

[23:21] Some people can't stand them

[23:23] Some people are in a Wade and C period

[23:25] I'm in the middle

[23:25] I'm in a Wade and C period

[23:27] I don't think these games are blowing anyone away

[23:29] I don't think these games are worth $10,000

[23:31] By any means

[23:32] But don't forget this

[23:34] And I keep reminding people of this

[23:36] If you strip off all of the Ellie

[23:38] And the FOMO

[23:40] And the Vanity stuff from these games

[23:42] Remember this

[23:43] These games are $64,995

[23:46] They are $6,500 games

[23:49] The only reason people are spending $7,899

[23:52] $10,000 on these games

[23:55] Is because you're loading them up

[23:57] With all of the Vanity stuff

[23:59] But none of that money is going into actual gameplay stuff

[24:02] It's you and me that have said

[24:04] Spooky we want limited stuff

[24:06] We want blood sucker additions

[24:08] We want collector's additions

[24:09] They simply follow the model that Stern did

[24:12] And that is where they're making their high-profit margins

[24:15] But that profit is not going into the games

[24:18] You're paying all that extra money

[24:19] For nothing that's going into the game

[24:21] Other than Vanity's stuff tacked on to the game

[24:23] So don't forget that

[24:24] It's not Spooky's fault

[24:26] They're not

[24:26] They don't think their games are worth $10,000

[24:29] You do

[24:29] They don't think their games are worth $9,000

[24:31] You do

[24:32] Because you just bought them with all that stuff on it

[24:35] So I think we need to stop blaming Spooky

[24:37] For not making a $9,000 worthy game

[24:39] It's not their fault

[24:41] They believe the game is $6,500

[24:43] Or is it $69,000?

[24:44] Is it $7,000?

[24:44] But whatever

[24:46] You know, it's still not $10

[24:47] All the other stuff is just stuff we're adding on

[24:50] All right, I'm going to give you a real quick rumor

[24:51] So people have been wondering why David Van S

[24:53] Is no longer working with Spooky Pimble

[24:55] And he's not working on Spooky Pimble's new games

[24:58] Now David Van S

[24:59] Did the animations for Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[25:01] David Van S as an animator is much better

[25:04] Than the animations happening in Halloween

[25:06] Everybody knows it

[25:07] All you Halloween apologists stop thinking that

[25:10] Those animations are great

[25:11] But why isn't David Van S there?

[25:13] So I found out why

[25:14] Because here's what's happened with Spooky is

[25:17] If you want to make a game

[25:18] If you've worked with Spooky throughout the years

[25:20] And you want to make a game

[25:21] The problem is they don't make games quickly

[25:24] They don't get three to four games out of year

[25:26] They usually get one game out every 18 months

[25:30] So if you're a designer and you bring them a game

[25:32] And you say, hey, I want to make this game

[25:34] There's no place in the roster or the schedule for you

[25:37] And especially if now

[25:38] Bug and Luke are going to start making these games

[25:40] And be the designers

[25:42] And Charlie's handing the company over to his son

[25:45] He's going to probably design most of the games

[25:47] Because he's already designed these two games

[25:49] And now he's onto the next design

[25:52] So they're not going to hire outside designers

[25:54] Because nor do they have space to make Ben Hex game

[25:57] Or make David Van S's game

[25:58] Now the game that David Van S brought them

[26:01] And wanted to make

[26:03] And they said no

[26:04] Is no other than the 80s movie

[26:06] Labrenth

[26:07] With Jennifer Conley and David Bowie

[26:10] And so would this have been a good pinball machine

[26:13] A Jim Henson movie

[26:14] Labrenth

[26:15] In which Jennifer Connelly is trying to go rescue the baby

[26:18] And get through the labrenth

[26:20] And you see David Bowie's crotch shot

[26:22] Like every 5 minutes in the film

[26:24] So I don't blame them

[26:26] I don't blame spooky pinball for telling David Van S

[26:29] That this is not going to be what we make

[26:32] And Labrenth is not a good theme for pinball

[26:35] It's not

[26:36] It's not what 40 to 60 year old men want to buy

[26:39] I don't think it would have been a good decision to green light

[26:42] Labrenth

[26:43] Now it was probably easy to get the license to it

[26:46] It was probably easy to get Jennifer Conley to do some stuff with the game

[26:50] It was probably easy to sort of get the soundtrack for it

[26:53] Because again it's not the biggest movie

[26:55] And no one's really knocking on the door

[26:57] Of the license holder of Labrenth very often being like

[27:00] Yo

[27:01] Like let's make some merchandise based on a movie

[27:03] That is still very niche

[27:05] There are way better themes in pinball than Labrenth

[27:08] That are still out there that nobody has made games based on

[27:11] So that is why David Van S is no longer there

[27:14] So let's go over to multi-morphic

[27:15] So there's no news from multi-morphic P3

[27:17] Other than there is new cabinet artwork that you can put on your P3 machine

[27:22] Jerry shared it at pinside

[27:24] It just sort of looks like this machine

[27:26] Like this powerful vortex laser cannon internal workings

[27:30] Which is known in the pinball world as the P3

[27:33] Jerry wears the license theme we're all waiting for

[27:37] I think Scott Denise is working on it

[27:39] Scott Denise's license theme P3

[27:42] That's gonna be the moment

[27:44] That's gonna be the moment

[27:45] I don't think putting different cabinet artwork does anything

[27:48] It's strange right now the artwork is not even based on a game you're playing

[27:52] It's based on what?

[27:54] Just like hyping the power of the platform

[27:57] So it is what it is

[27:59] I think it's a little bit like

[28:01] All right means nothing

[28:02] We need a new game

[28:03] We need a license game from P3 to really get people excited

[28:07] All right let's go on to Chicago gaming company

[28:09] So all that drama around the top

[28:12] And the LE versus the SE plus

[28:15] I think everyone realizes now how stupid all of that was

[28:19] Do I think they burned people?

[28:21] No, do I think they should have been better

[28:23] Communicating this from the beginning

[28:25] Yes, to me the only question left now is

[28:28] When are we gonna get these games

[28:30] You know when are we gonna get these games

[28:31] Because these games are not on the line yet

[28:33] And so I think you might be waiting three to six months to get your cactus canyons

[28:38] And that's a long wait like half a year from now

[28:41] All this drama all this waiting

[28:43] It will be worth it

[28:45] It will be built well

[28:47] But honestly I gotta be honest

[28:48] I'm really only excited to see the Lyman Sheets version of this game

[28:53] And so until that happens

[28:55] You're gonna get this game

[28:56] You'll enjoy it but it's not as good as Medieval madness

[29:00] It's not as good as Attack from Mars

[29:02] It's not as good as Monster Bash

[29:04] And the only thing that can make cactus can

[29:06] And I think worthy of all this hyping attention

[29:10] Is what Lyman Sheets and Josh Sharp do to this game

[29:13] Because it needs more

[29:14] This game was always like an easy shooter

[29:16] It kind of left you wanting more

[29:18] And Lyman Sheets is the guy right

[29:20] To give a game more depth and more longevity

[29:22] So we'll see what he does with the game

[29:24] But when is that gonna be

[29:25] And how much is that gonna cost

[29:27] Don't forget that

[29:28] So how much is it gonna cost

[29:30] Like it could be a thousand

[29:31] It could be two thousand bucks

[29:32] We'll see

[29:33] All right let's go on to Dutch Pimball

[29:35] No news in the world of big Lebowski

[29:37] So if you're waiting on a game

[29:39] I hope you get it soon but nothing new there

[29:42] American Pimball

[29:43] American Pimball

[29:45] Let's start out with a rumor right now

[29:47] I heard American Pimball might have the license

[29:49] This is a rumor

[29:50] To He-Man Masters of the Universe

[29:53] Now I'm excited

[29:55] Forget Labyrinth

[29:56] I want He-Man

[29:57] I want Castle Grace Call

[29:59] I have the power

[30:01] I think if American Pimball has He-Man

[30:03] Masters of the Universe

[30:05] They should make it Dennis Nordman

[30:07] This is what we want

[30:09] We don't want original themes

[30:11] We don't

[30:12] The real test is gonna be this

[30:14] About original themes

[30:15] Two months from now

[30:16] Are we gonna see distributors

[30:18] Still with Legends of Vahala's for sale

[30:21] Or are they all spoken for

[30:22] We shall see it's too early to tell

[30:24] Now someone did point out with Legends of Vahala

[30:26] A change they need to make

[30:28] If you look at the game

[30:29] And you look at the apron of the game

[30:30] You cannot read that gold font

[30:33] On that black apron

[30:35] It's like you can't read it

[30:37] So are they gonna make that change

[30:38] For the final production

[30:39] I don't think so

[30:40] Because the game's in production

[30:41] I just saw that what

[30:42] Helicon Brewery just got their Legends of Vahala

[30:45] But is this game going to customers yet

[30:48] Have we seen any customers get this game

[30:51] And I think it's on the line

[30:53] I'm not sure how many they're making a week

[30:55] But if you're AP

[30:57] They know this

[30:58] You want to get those 500 Deluxe editions

[31:00] Out the door as fast as you can

[31:02] Because the other part is this

[31:04] These games were not non-refundable

[31:07] So if you ordered a Legends of Vahala

[31:10] And you've had a change of heart

[31:11] Or you can get something else

[31:13] You can get a refund

[31:14] And go get something else

[31:15] So I think they're gonna want to get these games

[31:17] Out the door as soon as possible

[31:19] I also think 500 is too many

[31:21] I mean this

[31:21] I think distributors were just hungry to get anything

[31:24] I think distributors want it new in box games

[31:26] I don't think there's true demand for 500

[31:29] At what?

[31:29] $8400 bucks for the game

[31:31] I don't

[31:32] I don't

[31:32] But the market will tell me

[31:34] If I'm right or wrong

[31:35] Because I'm not sure

[31:36] Right?

[31:37] It's so hard to tell

[31:38] The difference between a cell through

[31:40] And a cell out

[31:42] They have not sold out

[31:44] They've sold through

[31:45] There is a huge difference there

[31:48] Every single sternalee sells through

[31:50] Doesn't mean it sells out on day one

[31:53] All right, let's go next real quick

[31:54] Because I know Killian's gotta get to his nap soon

[31:57] So after American Pimball

[31:58] Who am I missing?

[31:59] I don't think anyone

[32:00] Let me read this email I was talking about

[32:02] About the bomb

[32:03] On Godzilla versus Led Zeppelin

[32:05] I want to thank James Garasi for this email

[32:08] This is interesting, right?

[32:09] He said Chris

[32:10] When you mentioned that the bomb on these two games was the same

[32:14] I couldn't believe it

[32:15] I thought that the cost of the license

[32:17] Must be included in the bomb

[32:19] Then I went and took a look at the games

[32:22] Side by side for about a half hour

[32:24] Amazingly

[32:26] I concluded that your statement of the bomb being the same

[32:29] Is probably correct

[32:31] I didn't analysis of what is in the game

[32:34] Not including art

[32:35] And here it is below

[32:37] Scopes

[32:38] To each

[32:39] The Godzilla is a cheap vacuum form

[32:42] And the mecha Godzilla is nice

[32:44] But it's only half of the Kaiju

[32:46] Zeppelin has a Zeppelin and Icarus on a stick

[32:50] Cost equal

[32:51] Pop bumpers

[32:52] Zeppelin has three pop bumpers

[32:54] And Godzilla has one

[32:57] Zeppelin obviously costs a lot more

[33:00] Main mech

[33:01] The building mech on Godzilla is deceptively cheaper than it looks

[33:05] It has a lot of metal plates and screws and stuff

[33:09] But it is not sculpted in any way

[33:12] This is probably a lot cheaper than it looks to build

[33:15] Of course it has some circuit boards as well

[33:18] The magic spinner on Zeppelin probably costs almost as much to make

[33:23] Slight cost edge to Godzilla

[33:25] Main features

[33:27] This is where things are a bit deceptive

[33:30] Godzilla has the collapsing bridge and spinning targets

[33:34] Zeppelin has two banks of drop targets

[33:37] George Gomez stated that Fathom would be very expensive to remake

[33:41] Due to all the drop targets and these are expensive mechs

[33:45] The reality is that even though it doesn't appear so

[33:48] The cost of these two Godzilla mechs and the cost of the two drop target banks

[33:53] Are probably close to the same

[33:56] Of course I'm just speculating but I could be wrong

[33:59] The cost here is equal

[34:00] Additional main features

[34:02] Zeppelin has the expression lighting system

[34:04] And Godzilla has the newden ball mech with magnet

[34:08] I'm not sure which is more expensive

[34:10] Stand up targets

[34:11] Godzilla has four full and three mini targets

[34:15] Zeppelin has six full and one mini target for Icarus on a stick

[34:20] Seven each but Zeppelin has more full size ones

[34:23] Cost slightly more for Zeppelin

[34:26] Flippers each game has three flippers cost is equal

[34:29] Lights Zeppelin has 68 RGB lights and Godzilla has only 13

[34:36] Zeppelin more expensive by quite a bit

[34:39] Spinners Zeppelin has two and Godzilla has three

[34:42] Godzilla cost is higher

[34:44] General features each game has six pinballs

[34:47] Stereo with three channel amplifier

[34:50] And ten band graphic equalizer cost equal

[34:54] Godzilla has two though extensive and Zeppelin has four

[34:58] Cost is probably about the same since the wire forms are roughly the same total length

[35:04] Cost equal

[35:05] Kickout scoops

[35:06] Zeppelin has two and Godzilla has one

[35:10] Cost is greater on Zeppelin

[35:12] Playfield inserts Zeppelin has more playfield inserts by about ten or so

[35:17] On average the inserts are larger than the ones on Godzilla

[35:21] Zeppelin slightly higher cost

[35:24] Other stuff Zeppelin also has an extra electric gate

[35:28] Zeppelin has song selection though i don't think this contributes to bomb

[35:32] Godzilla has four plastic signs with three lights each

[35:36] There are three other vacuum form buildings

[35:38] Extra cost stuff is higher on Godzilla

[35:41] The ultimate conclusion that he makes

[35:43] I conclude from the above that the bomb probably is about the same

[35:48] There are some unknowns i don't really know how much the mech cost is in comparison to each other

[35:53] So i can only take an educated guess on them

[35:56] Just goes to show you that steve richi probably mailed it in and just wanted out

[36:02] Richie was spoiled by bali Williams days with high bombs whereas elwin had to learn from the get go

[36:09] How to do things cheaply it would be interesting to see what elwin could do with a wizard of us budget

[36:16] If you have any more insights on costs please let me know james well james

[36:21] Thank you so much and i've heard from people at stern that the bomb was right next to each other

[36:27] And so as we all know steve richi is now at jjp so what will he do in a land with more budget

[36:35] Will he blow us away the pressure is on steve to retain his throne

[36:40] The king and pinball is now key fellen everyone this has been episode 620 something

[36:47] Thank you so much for all who contribute to the show

[36:51] Thank you for just listening to canada's pinball podcast and let's all be thankful

[36:55] It's November nothing new is really happening in pinball before December and rush

[37:00] So you might not get as many weekly shows but trust me

[37:04] I will be back with more cadence when there is more news and i'm still going to do my Saturday morning spectacular

[37:10] And i just feel better about being in pinball now so i'm just more content

[37:14] Not really hunting for drama i just want to report stuff as it happens

[37:18] But i'm not going to try to create news out of nowhere

[37:21] So everybody have a great Saturday morning and i will be back with more episodes of canada's pinball podcast have a good day

[37:45] Oh

[37:49] They say all's well late ends well but i'm in a new hell every time

[37:57] Double cross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe
