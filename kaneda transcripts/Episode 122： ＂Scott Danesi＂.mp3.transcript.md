[00:00] Welcome to episode 122 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:26] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:29] It was a beautiful Mother's Day here in New York City.

[00:32] I spent a good portion of today with my mother and my father celebrating my mother.

[00:40] I'd love this woman more than anything.

[00:44] More than I could even describe in words, providence of Florence or the stevo coloris, my

[00:51] mother, my Sicilian mother.

[00:54] She is amazing.

[00:56] She is the reason why.

[00:58] I have been able to dedicate my career and my life to the things I'm passionate about.

[01:05] She is a true artist.

[01:06] She has an art gallery.

[01:08] She is the ultimate linchpin and the backbone of my life.

[01:15] She has always encouraged me to do things I love, to never compromise, and to always, always

[01:25] lead a life that is filled with passion.

[01:30] That is the Italian way.

[01:32] My Sicilian mother, passionate people make this world go round.

[01:38] Speaking of passionate people, I had the great opportunity to talk with Scott Denise tonight

[01:45] about total nuclear annihilation.

[01:49] When we think about passionate people in the pinball world, it's really just on one hand.

[02:00] You can count the people that actually are so passionate about pinball that they're making

[02:06] their very own pinball machines.

[02:10] That's amazing to me.

[02:12] There are so many critics and cynics and people on the pin side that are always chiming

[02:18] in.

[02:20] Some of these guys spend so much time doing nothing but criticizing pinball that they could

[02:27] be spending that time doing something much more productive, like making a pinball machine.

[02:33] Scott, who works at pinball life, has been working on this game that was originally called

[02:40] Total Annihilation.

[02:41] Now it's called Total Nuclear Annihilation because of a licensing and IP issue they had

[02:48] with an arcade game.

[02:51] But I love Scott.

[02:52] I love Scott because he's passionate about this hobby and he's doing it differently.

[02:58] He's not just making the same old cookie cutter kind of game.

[03:02] He's really focusing on making a game that I think brings the most important elements

[03:08] of pinball to life.

[03:09] That is the sound effects.

[03:13] That is the music.

[03:14] That is the light show.

[03:16] That is the artwork.

[03:18] The sensation that you get when you play his machine is just as rewarding as games that

[03:26] have a lot more complexities going on.

[03:30] We talk about this when we talk about pinball machines.

[03:33] There's a lot more going on in dialed in than there is in Total Nuclear Annihilation.

[03:40] But you might be having just as much, if not more fun, playing Scott's game.

[03:47] Why is that?

[03:48] You don't always need all of the bells and whistles to make a pinball machine fun.

[03:55] Sometimes you can just make it easier to understand and just a real visceral experience, which

[04:02] I think Scott is bringing to the table.

[04:05] And I also give Scott a lot of credit because Scott's game is going to be out.

[04:10] He's connected with spooky and this game is coming out probably at the end of the year.

[04:14] And what I love about it is it's real.

[04:17] Like it's going to happen.

[04:18] This isn't going to be some situation where you have your money tied up with a manufacturer

[04:23] for two plus years and you're waiting for your game and all this bullshit that is just

[04:29] dragging the hobby down.

[04:33] This game will be real and it's going to be in people's homes and there's not going

[04:38] to be a lot of speculation on whether or not spooky can make it.

[04:43] They're going to make it.

[04:44] They're going to make it.

[04:45] It's going to happen.

[04:47] And that's exciting.

[04:49] So I'm really glad that Scott took the time tonight to talk to me.

[04:53] I've been wanting to talk to him for a while now.

[04:58] But I know that spooky got him to do their podcast first.

[05:03] But I think you're going to hear some new stuff on this podcast that you haven't heard

[05:06] before.

[05:08] And I'll say this.

[05:09] I'll say this.

[05:10] I still think that spooky and a lot of these companies out there, they just don't quite

[05:18] know how to properly market pinball yet.

[05:22] And we'll talk about this when I talk with Scott.

[05:26] This whole notion of like we're going to make 50 total annihilations and then make another

[05:31] 50.

[05:32] I don't even know if they even understand what they're doing marketing wise.

[05:36] I really don't.

[05:37] And even showing the artwork early and having people critique it and in some cases like

[05:44] insult it, what is it get you that eight months, nine months prior to launch, you're allowing

[05:51] this sort of circus of cynics enter into your narrative.

[05:58] Like it doesn't make any sense to me.

[05:59] I just wouldn't do it.

[06:01] But you know what?

[06:03] It doesn't matter because at the end of the day, if the game is good and the game is available,

[06:07] the game will sell.

[06:09] And that that's what I've learned.

[06:12] Studying this hobby over the last couple of years is that you've got a bunch of BS companies

[06:18] who can't get their shit together, who have a hard time getting games and boxes.

[06:23] And then you got companies who actually can put games and boxes.

[06:26] We know that total nuclear annihilation will be in a box with a spooky ghost on it that

[06:32] you can buy sometime by the end of the year.

[06:36] And that's exciting.

[06:37] So without further ado, I give you Scott Denise the creator of total nuclear annihilation.

[06:45] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce to this episode of Canadian Spinball

[06:50] podcast, Scott Denise, the man who is making total nuclear annihilation to Canadian Spinball

[06:58] podcast.

[06:59] Scott, welcome to the show.

[07:00] Thank you.

[07:01] Thank you.

[07:02] Awesome to be here, man.

[07:03] And Scott, I've been wanting to have you for a while.

[07:06] You know this.

[07:07] You like kind of you kind of shoved me to the curb and said, I got to do spooky Spinball

[07:13] podcast first before I do Canadians.

[07:16] But you know what?

[07:17] I'm willing to forgive.

[07:18] All right, Chris, you know, I'm glad you're willing to forgive.

[07:22] I appreciate it.

[07:24] And your game, your game has been making the rounds that shows.

[07:29] And I'll never forget.

[07:31] I asked George Gomez, what is the one game you would buy if you did not buy a stern

[07:37] pinball machine?

[07:38] And he said total annihilation.

[07:41] Did you hear that?

[07:43] Yeah, I should, I listened to your podcast all the time actually and I did, I did hear

[07:48] George say that.

[07:49] That was really humbling to tell you the truth, man.

[07:52] I did not expect him to say that.

[07:54] I thought he was going to talk about something else, but I have no clue actually.

[07:57] But yeah, it was really neat to hear that.

[08:00] I mean, that's a huge compliment for sure.

[08:04] Yeah, I mean, he literally threw you the biggest bone.

[08:07] So let's talk total nuclear annihilation on this podcast.

[08:12] So where we are right now, right?

[08:16] So let's just take a step back and say the game has been making the rounds the shows,

[08:24] people love it.

[08:26] And spooky.

[08:27] So how does Charlie reach out to you?

[08:29] Like, talk to us about, tell us the story of Charlie coming to you to bring this game

[08:36] out to market.

[08:38] Well, you know, Charlie and I have been friends for a very long time.

[08:41] You know, and I mean, I see him a lot.

[08:44] We chat, he knows I've been working on this game.

[08:49] And you know, he's, we were just talking and we're like, hey, you know, this, this may

[08:53] be a cool thing to see if spooky can build.

[08:56] He's like, yeah, absolutely.

[08:57] This is a great idea.

[08:59] So we started looking and, you know, we looked through it a little bit.

[09:02] I think the first time we were talking about it was like at Expo last year, we kind of

[09:06] just joking around just as buddies, you know, he goes, yeah, man, we should totally build

[09:10] this thing.

[09:11] And I'm like, all right, cool.

[09:12] And I lifted the play field up.

[09:13] And he's like, yeah, we're not building that.

[09:15] Right.

[09:16] I don't know if you guys have seen the bottom side of the play field, but it's, it looks a

[09:20] little bit intimidating.

[09:22] Just because of all the wires, because the, the P rock system driving, you know, 103 or

[09:29] 105 LEDs, I forgot.

[09:30] They're all, you know, RGB things.

[09:33] But, yeah, so we were joking about that.

[09:35] And then, you know, later on, he's like, well, we could actually build that.

[09:39] It wouldn't be a big deal.

[09:41] You know, we could make it work.

[09:42] And so we just kept talking about it.

[09:45] And one thing led to another and this kind of here, here's where we're at.

[09:49] So what, what made him change his mind, though, Scott?

[09:52] Like, when he first saw it, and it was like this, this universe of cables and wires and

[09:58] LEDs, like, what made Charlie say, like, we could do this.

[10:03] Like was there, was, was there like a moment where like they realized like, this is manageable?

[10:10] Because like, could you have told me like this game's pretty complex underneath the play

[10:13] field, right?

[10:14] It's not as simple as people think.

[10:16] Yeah, yeah.

[10:17] And you know what?

[10:18] Honestly, Charlie was probably just kidding around at Expo.

[10:20] I think we're just joking around with each other.

[10:22] Um, but at that point, it wasn't serious talking.

[10:25] So he wasn't seriously like, oh, yeah, we're not building that screw that to my wires.

[10:29] You know, he wasn't saying that.

[10:30] But, uh, yeah, I'm just kind of teasing me.

[10:33] So it is complicated.

[10:36] How complex is total nuclear annihilation as, because I know like on the surface, there's

[10:42] no ramps.

[10:43] There's not a lot of sort of modern complexity happening above the plate, though, but underneath

[10:50] is it, is it pretty complex with all the lights and what's going on?

[10:55] Absolutely.

[10:56] And you know, the lights aren't necessarily the most complex part.

[11:00] This game itself has all of the magic happens under, I'm sorry for using that word, I apologize.

[11:07] No, I love magic.

[11:08] I'll take that back.

[11:09] I need magic.

[11:11] I need magic in my life because I got no magic in my magic role.

[11:14] I need it.

[11:15] Just use it.

[11:16] It's such a such.

[11:17] I'm sorry.

[11:18] But everything happens underneath the play field.

[11:21] So there are, in this game, there are 21 coils underneath the play field.

[11:27] So a normal game, you know, a typical game probably has somewhere around 16 coils.

[11:35] I know there's exceptions to that, obviously.

[11:38] And you know, that needs to be fact checked probably.

[11:41] But there are a lot of coils under there doing a lot of different things.

[11:45] So we've got things like there are five slingshots in this game, right?

[11:50] There's three slingshots that are up in the reactor core and then there's just the two

[11:53] down below.

[11:55] There are three flippers.

[11:57] So one up in the nuclear reactor core and then two down below.

[12:01] There's a pop bumper.

[12:03] There are two control gate assemblies.

[12:06] There are two eject scoops.

[12:09] There are two separate control gate assemblies up top.

[12:15] And I think that's close to it.

[12:18] Yeah.

[12:19] I think so.

[12:20] But there's a lot of stuff going on.

[12:21] It's got like auto launchers and like trough coils and all the other stuff that you

[12:25] absolutely need.

[12:26] But there are a ton of things going on underneath there.

[12:29] Okay.

[12:30] So there's a lot more.

[12:32] When you hear people say Scott, like this is like a modern day EM, are you like get out

[12:38] of town?

[12:39] Like this game is much more than that.

[12:42] Now, you know, I don't get offended by that kind of stuff.

[12:46] It was meant to look simple on the top.

[12:49] But then when you play it, it was meant to catch you off guard and surprise you.

[12:54] So when I originally thought of this game, I'm like, you know, I really liked those single

[12:59] level games from back in the day.

[13:00] You know, they were really cool.

[13:02] But you know, you could do some more cool stuff.

[13:04] Like, you know, we're not done with those single level play fields yet.

[13:08] And I just wanted to prove that, you know.

[13:10] Right.

[13:11] I was like, hey, you know, the drop target lacking mechanism is cool.

[13:15] You know, putting controlled gate assemblies on there, putting, you know, extra slingshots

[13:20] and all this other stuff.

[13:22] And you know what?

[13:23] No, nobody's put a pop umber on the right side of the plea field in a while.

[13:27] So that needs to happen.

[13:29] Right.

[13:30] So talk us through the design and total, we'll call it total nuclear annihilation.

[13:37] I know you changed your name.

[13:38] We'll talk about that in a little bit.

[13:39] So when you design this, right, how did you figure out you wanted to make it pretty simple

[13:47] though in terms of, you know, not a lot of rams, not multiple play fields, but there's

[13:52] no ramp in the game, right?

[13:54] Not at all.

[13:55] Yeah, no ramp whatsoever.

[13:56] So, um, yeah.

[13:57] So basically what I did was I set out to build a pinball machine.

[14:02] I was just doing this obviously for myself, well, maybe not obviously, but I was doing this

[14:07] for just me to have in my basement and to, you know, share with people.

[14:11] But what I did was I tried to build it with off the shelf parts with as many off the

[14:18] shelf parts as I could.

[14:20] And I wanted to make it just because I didn't want to have the project kind of stall out

[14:26] because I'm trying to figure out how to make some kind of customized mechanism work, you

[14:30] know what I mean?

[14:32] So everything on this game is like, you know, it's really kind of off the shelf, like

[14:37] stuff from pinball life, you know, I mean, I work at pinball life as the engineer over

[14:42] there.

[14:43] So I know like, you know, all the mechanisms and assemblies that we have.

[14:46] So I just started like looking at what we had and then starting to put together a play

[14:51] field based on that stuff.

[14:53] So, you know, it is, uh, it just, it doesn't kind of makes it look simple though.

[15:00] There's just that effect that there is no ramps.

[15:02] There's no custom stuff on the top side that you can see anyway.

[15:07] Right.

[15:08] Um, so I want to ask you, Scott, because I feel like right now as we think about what

[15:15] makes a pinball machine fun.

[15:18] And that's a topic that comes up time and time again.

[15:22] And your machine has sort of simplified what people expect from a pinball machine, yet

[15:30] people are having a ton of fun on your machine without multiple play fields without a ramp.

[15:36] Um, and a lot, and like, it's a whitewood, right?

[15:39] So it's like just lights and a theme and, and like ball action.

[15:47] What are your thoughts on like, when it comes to making a fun pinball machine, what are

[15:51] the key elements that you need to create for the player to have fun?

[15:56] Well, so it's actually, you know, since I built this for myself, I just kind of, I

[16:01] knew what I thought was fun.

[16:03] And what I think is fun is not necessarily ramps, right?

[16:08] So for, for instance, like hitting ramp is, you know, it's cool.

[16:12] It brings the ball back.

[16:13] It's exactly where it's, you know, exactly where it's expected.

[16:17] Um, but not necessarily fun.

[16:19] What really makes a pinball machine fun for me is when the, excuse me, uh,

[16:26] machine itself is trying to actually battle you.

[16:29] So it's trying to kill you like all the time.

[16:33] So things like F 14, right?

[16:36] It has that kicker that just like kicks it right back at you at 100 miles an hour.

[16:39] And it's like, you know, it's just purposely, it's there completely just to try to kill you.

[16:45] Right.

[16:46] So, uh, and again, this, this machine's just battling you the whole time.

[16:51] It's making it the pop bumper is throwing chaos into the, uh, play field there.

[16:56] It's doing crazy light shows to try to distract you and, you know, kind of blind you.

[17:01] And you know, it's just, it's trying everything it can to end your ball and make you collect

[17:06] your bonus.

[17:07] Right.

[17:08] So for, for you, a machine is fun when the machine itself is trying to make you,

[17:13] but make you drain in some way.

[17:16] Yeah, absolutely.

[17:17] Like, you know, I, I don't find games and I, it's, I say I had to say, but I, I don't find

[17:21] games like, um, lower the rings and those type of games fun, really.

[17:26] Uh, I don't want to play pinball for 45 minutes.

[17:30] Uh, not that I'm good enough to actually do that, but I don't want to have super long games

[17:35] on pinball.

[17:36] Uh, I do like the brief games, you know, when you're playing with your friends,

[17:40] you want to get up there, you want to play real hard, you want to try to, you know,

[17:45] you're just trying to beat them and you want it to be done quick.

[17:47] So you can get back to drinking your beer and, you know, talking shit to your friends

[17:51] and then let them go ahead.

[17:53] You know what I mean?

[17:54] Well, I agree.

[17:55] I, I, I think lower the rings and I think games where like you can actually have like a half

[18:00] hour ball on a pinball machine, something's wrong.

[18:04] Like, like the game is not designed right.

[18:07] I mean, there's nothing social about that.

[18:10] So you wanted to make a game that's somewhat difficult, someone challenging,

[18:15] and what I think what's interesting about total nuclear annihilation is is even though

[18:21] it doesn't have the complexity of rams and multiple play fields,

[18:26] is the game is still really hard for people, correct?

[18:28] Like what's like an average ball time on this game?

[18:32] Um, I have to, I have the stats for that, but it's, uh, I got the average ball

[18:37] times up to I think about lately.

[18:40] It's probably about 50 seconds.

[18:42] This is nothing.

[18:44] Yeah.

[18:44] It's, it's a bowl.

[18:46] So again, I could be, I mean, there, there could be some statistics that are off in my machine.

[18:51] It might be counting multi balls and stuff.

[18:52] Right.

[18:53] So, uh, you know, well, it might be thinking the ball is draining when it's not, uh,

[18:57] Scott, let's talk about the theme.

[18:59] So how did you come up with the theme of destroying what nine nuclear reactors?

[19:05] Like tell us like the story of new total nuclear annihilation.

[19:09] All right.

[19:09] So, uh, I've always kind of been like fascinated with nuclear reactors because like,

[19:15] you know, I, I'm probably just like scared of them or something, but I've been fascinated with them.

[19:19] So it's, uh, you know, stuff like Chernobyl and things like that.

[19:23] Those stories are, uh, just kind of neat.

[19:27] And I was like, man, you know, I, uh, I started, uh, when I started looking at designing this

[19:32] play field, uh, the theme and the play field kind of happened at the same time.

[19:37] I had no idea it was going to be like a nuclear reactor destroying, you know,

[19:41] the future kind of theme when I started it.

[19:44] But I wanted to have a section of the play field where the pop bumpers would normally be,

[19:51] but instead of using pop bumpers, I wanted to use, uh, slingshots and I wanted to aim the slingshots at each other.

[19:58] Right.

[19:58] Cause I really, you know, I really hadn't seen that too much before.

[20:02] I mean, some machines have that kind of thing up at the top, but they're not really aimed at each other.

[20:06] And I just wanted to see what would happen.

[20:09] Like, would it be fun?

[20:10] Would it, you know, the ball with a ball just get crazy in there.

[20:13] And I'm, you know, I'm looking at this and I'm like, you know, that's kind of like a, you know,

[20:17] a reactor core, you know, and so I kind of started figuring that out.

[20:22] And it just like, it just kind of morphed into this whole theme.

[20:26] And I was, you know, I, then I had to sit down and like, well, I guess I got to create a little story for,

[20:30] you know, what's going on here?

[20:31] You know, you don't just, you don't just destroy reactors, you know,

[20:36] for no reason.

[20:38] So yeah, that's right.

[20:40] Now someone, someone emailed me a game and I wanted to ask you if you were familiar with it,

[20:48] but Gottlieb's critical mass game was a game about destroying nuclear reactors.

[20:56] Have you, had you ever heard of that game before setting out to make total nuclear annihilation or total annihilation?

[21:03] I had heard of that game actually.

[21:06] And I was very fascinated by that game.

[21:08] I've never played it.

[21:09] Obviously, I think there's like one of them and it's in Whitewood State somewhere and I think it'll exist in pictures now,

[21:14] but I would love to see that game someday.

[21:19] But I did, I was aware of that game completely.

[21:23] And, you know, I kind of forgot about it for a long time.

[21:28] And then, you know, it didn't really sway me much on this,

[21:32] but I think, I don't know, probably something subconscious in my head, you know,

[21:37] maybe go back to that.

[21:39] But yeah, that game looks really neat.

[21:41] I mean, I don't know where that exists, but I got to find it.

[21:44] Right.

[21:45] Yeah, they, it's a weird game.

[21:48] Like, for those of you out there, if you Google Gottlieb's critical mass,

[21:52] it was like a game that was a prototype and then it just ended up like in someone's like,

[21:58] born for years.

[22:01] And I think of like 19, I want to say like 19 like,

[22:05] or like late 80s and then these guys made a Whitewood of it and they clear coded it.

[22:12] But let's, but it never, it never made it out.

[22:16] So, total annihilation.

[22:19] So, this, when did you first bring this game to shows, Scott?

[22:23] Like, when, when did you first like say, okay, this game is like far enough along

[22:27] where I can let people start to play it?

[22:30] Okay. So, the timeline actually and this thing was, I started this game in November of 2015.

[22:38] That's when I sat down at my kitchen table with a piece of paper and a pencil and I started

[22:43] drawing out a play field and how I would think how I would want a play field to look, you know.

[22:50] Right.

[22:52] And at first, you know, I did a bunch of different like drawings of this thing and,

[22:57] you know, I was trying to get, I mean, just, it wasn't like working out really well on the paper.

[23:02] You know, because I'm like, I don't know, I just, I don't know if that geometry is going to work or whatever.

[23:07] So, what I did actually was, I started, I have, I built a home, like, home model CNC machine.

[23:18] It's like a hobbyist model CNC machine called an X-Carve.

[23:21] I built one of those things and had that in my garage and I ended up just deciding to cut

[23:26] a play field with a standard Italian bottom on it.

[23:30] And then just, I just cut that out of like cheap home depot wood.

[23:34] And then I started like drawing actually on that.

[23:37] And that helped a lot.

[23:39] And I was able to then from there, continue designing this game and I started doing it in

[23:44] the computer using solid works. So, okay.

[23:48] That's kind of how I did, that's kind of how I started it.

[23:50] And then from there, I said, hey, my goal is to have a working game by X-Bo 2016.

[23:57] And that was like, I just wanted the game to flip.

[24:01] Like, I just wanted stuff on the play field and the flippers to function.

[24:05] And that was it.

[24:07] So, I set that goal for myself.

[24:10] I just worked really hard on it.

[24:12] And I was able to actually, for X-Bo 2016, I was able to get the game there.

[24:19] And it even had some rules.

[24:21] It had some scoring.

[24:22] The score displays work.

[24:23] There was some junk on the LCD that didn't make any sense.

[24:26] But it was there.

[24:28] It was functioning.

[24:29] The music was something that I just quickly wrote.

[24:33] That it ended up being pretty good.

[24:35] And that's the main theme music that's still in there today.

[24:39] All right.

[24:40] So, so you, right now, if anyone plays this game, you wrote the entire

[24:48] musical score to this game.

[24:49] I did.

[24:50] Yeah.

[24:50] All of it was completely from scratch.

[24:54] So, what, so walk me through that.

[24:56] So, where did you get sort of the musical inspiration?

[25:00] And the theme in this game keeps, you know, it's like this 80s sort of throwback.

[25:06] Talk to me about like the time period, which this game is trying to recreate.

[25:12] Is it 80s?

[25:13] Is it 90s?

[25:14] I know there's a lot of like speculation on, on, on, on,

[25:17] on the pin side of what decade this game is paying homage to.

[25:21] Yeah.

[25:22] I think that's where the most confusion comes in.

[25:24] So, there is this, there's this whole subculture.

[25:28] You know, the, you know, the whole steampunk culture, right?

[25:30] And you kind of familiar with that.

[25:32] I think most people are.

[25:33] I can kind of relate this to that a little bit.

[25:36] There's this other culture similar to steampunk, which is like,

[25:40] it's something from the 80s, right?

[25:44] As someone from the 80s would have seen how the future was going to look like in like 100 years.

[25:51] So, they have this, it's called like retro futuristic or outrun.

[25:55] It's called sometimes.

[25:57] A lot of the music is called like retro new wave and like all this other crazy stuff.

[26:03] Like there's a, there's a whole subculture of this stuff just happening now.

[26:07] It's getting, it's catching a lot of traction actually.

[26:11] So, there's a group of people that actually envision what the future would look like

[26:18] as if it were 1980s, vision of the future?

[26:21] Yes.

[26:22] Kind of like back to the future, like two where it's like everything in that movie is like 80s version of the future.

[26:29] Exactly.

[26:30] And that's kind of, you know what I mean?

[26:31] Like everything, like there's, there's details that are missed and there's things that are

[26:35] completely wrong about the future.

[26:37] You know what I'm talking about?

[26:38] Like, you know, like when Marty McFly's in his house and he like, he's like the big screen TV

[26:44] on his wall, you know, like, hey, that actually happened.

[26:46] And then like all of a sudden there's like a facts machine that comes out and says like,

[26:49] you're fired or whatever.

[26:51] And like, oh, well, that, man, we don't do that.

[26:53] But, you know, it's sort of like that.

[26:57] But, you know, you, that's what makes it a little bit challenging is that you are trying to

[27:02] do things with this theme that you just have to think of someone from the 80s,

[27:08] like how they would have thought the future was going to be.

[27:11] So they were like, hey, everything's neon lights, you know?

[27:15] Like a good example of it and something that flows through on that is when we are working on

[27:21] the back glass, right?

[27:24] We originally were going to put some things in the sky.

[27:27] Like Matt was like, oh, I'll put some drones, you know, up in the sky.

[27:31] And I'm like, you know what?

[27:32] Wait on that for a second.

[27:33] I'm like, someone from the 80s is not going to know or be able to predict that we'll have

[27:38] little flying drones, you know?

[27:41] It needs to be like a futuristic looking helicopter with like neon around the helicopter blades,

[27:48] you know?

[27:49] Like that's like neon along the bottom.

[27:51] Like, is everything head neon out of for some reason?

[27:55] So, so the, so, and I definitely want to talk about the artwork.

[28:00] But before that, before that, let's talk about the theme.

[28:04] So the theme is, you're someone in the 1980s that is trying to blow up nine nuclear reactors

[28:12] of the future or absolutely.

[28:14] So, okay.

[28:15] So basically that the theme or the story, like high level story is, and I don't have a comic book,

[28:20] I'm sorry, but the theme is you're from the 80s and you need to travel to the future

[28:27] because forward time travel works with, you know, cryogenics or whatever, however they do it,

[28:32] right?

[28:33] Right.

[28:34] Forward time travel works and that's good.

[28:35] But so you go to the, going to the future because that civilization is actually right on the

[28:43] brink of discovering reverse time travel and they are going to come back in time and completely

[28:50] destroy the timeline that this whole thing exists on.

[28:56] So what you're going to do is to preserve your friends and family and your culture there

[29:01] in the past.

[29:02] You need to go to the future and you need to destroy the civilization.

[29:07] So it is not a heroic thing.

[29:12] I don't think it's more of like an anti-hero type theme.

[29:16] Like you are not necessarily a good person.

[29:19] You know, it's kind of up in the air.

[29:21] It's like you're kind of good and kind of bad.

[29:24] Right.

[29:25] So you're going to kill people in the future.

[29:28] Oh yeah.

[29:28] So to preserve the people of the 80s.

[29:32] Correct.

[29:33] Okay.

[29:33] And so how far into the future is this person going?

[29:37] Well, that's actually what's interesting about it is because I left that completely vague.

[29:42] Okay.

[29:42] So it's up to the people who look at the machine or dissect the story to kind of figure out.

[29:49] Will Hilton still be alive in this future in Madison, Wisconsin?

[29:53] That's all I need to know.

[29:56] No clue man.

[29:58] Or now is he human?

[30:00] Yeah.

[30:00] I don't know.

[30:01] Well, the jury's still out on that one.

[30:03] Okay.

[30:03] So that's it's a very interesting premise.

[30:08] And so a lot of conversation.

[30:12] Scott has been happening around.

[30:14] The sort of the depth of the game.

[30:18] Right.

[30:18] And the notion that you destroy nine nuclear reactors.

[30:24] But that when you're playing the game,

[30:27] destroying them doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing nine times over.

[30:32] Right.

[30:32] There's like a lot of randomness in the game that makes it feel different every time you're

[30:37] destroying a new reactor.

[30:39] Correct.

[30:40] Sort of.

[30:41] Yeah.

[30:41] So what I originally did the the software outline for it.

[30:46] I wanted a linear progression through the game.

[30:49] I know like some people don't like linear progression through games.

[30:52] But I wanted to be able to ramp up the difficulty and the randomness of the reactors as you go.

[30:58] So it's not just like chopping wood, you know.

[31:01] Can I just say for the record every single amazing video game of all time is a linear progression?

[31:07] I can't stand it when pinball people have an

[31:10] version to linear progression.

[31:13] It's called how books unfold like chapter after chapter.

[31:20] I just for the record like I think linear progression has a bad

[31:25] wrapping pinball.

[31:26] But it's how every single great book and video game progresses.

[31:31] But go on.

[31:32] All right.

[31:33] Yeah.

[31:34] So so I wanted to be linear right like because you know, I I am I play a lot of video games.

[31:39] I was a kid right?

[31:39] A lot of Nintendo and I did a lot of arcade stuff back.

[31:43] You know, and I'll a few like many actually many years ago now.

[31:47] So I wanted to be linear.

[31:49] But at the same time you don't want it to be boring.

[31:51] Right.

[31:52] So and you don't want to be predictable.

[31:55] So what I did was when you're going through and destroying these reactors,

[31:59] obviously they get harder and harder as you go.

[32:02] But each game when you are bringing a reactor up to its critical point,

[32:09] and it is about to overheat and you're about to destroy it.

[32:12] The actual shot needed to destroy the reactor is randomized.

[32:18] So it will it will be something on the lower play field from a select group of targets.

[32:22] But it will be random.

[32:24] And as you go further along, it's more and more of those shots are needed.

[32:28] Okay.

[32:29] Yeah.

[32:29] And there's other little things in two there.

[32:31] And they're making it a little bit harder each time you get through a reactor.

[32:34] And can you can you stack reactors so you're destroying more than one at a time?

[32:41] Or how does how does that work?

[32:43] No, the reactors cannot be stacked at all.

[32:46] Oh, so you have to you have to destroy one to move on to the next one.

[32:50] Okay.

[32:50] Yeah, that's that's part of the whole linear set of it.

[32:54] And have you seen anyone destroy all nine reactors at a show?

[32:59] I have not.

[33:00] Have you ever done it?

[33:02] Have you?

[33:03] No, but you know, last Friday we did, I think you're I don't know if you were aware of this,

[33:08] but last Friday we did another dead flip stream of the latest version of the software.

[33:12] And there is a clip of me destroying four reactors and working through my fifth one and being,

[33:20] you know, being stupid and dropping the ball.

[33:23] And yeah, it was I could have done way better.

[33:25] But I'll tell you what, four is pretty solid.

[33:28] So yeah, it's on this thing or wide open.

[33:30] So it's it's easily adjustable.

[33:33] Right.

[33:34] What I love about the game.

[33:36] And I think what's what's pretty amazing, Scott, is

[33:40] without any artwork, without any of the normal sort of visual like wow factor,

[33:49] just the white wood with the lights and the sound.

[33:54] This game is really captivated people.

[33:56] And and I've said this on this podcast a million times.

[33:59] I think pinball, I think what I think pinball, the magic of pinball, a lot of it is like the light show,

[34:07] the sounds like you're the music in total annihilation at a show is phenomenal.

[34:14] Talk to us about the sound because you you made the music and you what kind of speakers are in this

[34:20] game and how does this game like really pop on an audio level on like any other game I've seen

[34:27] in the show?

[34:28] Well, that's that's interesting.

[34:30] The actual physical hardware itself is nothing too crazy.

[34:34] I mean, the the speakers that are up in the back box are just five inch speakers.

[34:39] And I'm just driving it with one of those cheap like $25 amps I got off Amazon.

[34:44] But I do have something inside the cabinet where it is it's something I've wanted to see in a

[34:49] pinball machine for many, many years.

[34:52] I used to be into car starrows when I was younger, right?

[34:57] I think a lot of us were.

[34:59] But there's something called a band pass box which is where a speaker is completely sealed up

[35:04] into a box and it's ported out the back of the of the box itself.

[35:09] And I've always wanted to see one of those put in a pinball machine but there's never really any

[35:14] room for it.

[35:15] And this case I was able to have enough room inside this cabinet that I created a custom

[35:23] band pass box for an eight inch woofer.

[35:25] It's only it's it's not even that big of a subwoofer.

[35:28] It's only eight inch but I bought a nice sub.

[35:32] I bought a nice amp for it.

[35:34] It's it's all kicker brand stuff for that.

[35:37] But I think it just sounds really good because it's firing all of the audio,

[35:43] all the bass out of the cabinet instead of shaking the glass and shaking everything like the

[35:47] whole cabinet doesn't shake because of the actual subwoofer.

[35:52] It's pushing the audio out so you can actually hear more of it.

[35:57] And it sounds amazing and let's talk about the light show.

[36:01] So how are like I mean I have a magic girl and I think everyone knows that and I'm in love with

[36:07] the light show of magic girl but the light show on on your game is incredible.

[36:13] Now how are the lights wired in your game?

[36:17] The lights are wired into node boards on the p-rock system called PD LEDs.

[36:24] Basically these boards control up to 28 RGB LEDs each and I have five of those node boards in the

[36:33] game. I'm not I'm not using every single one of those outputs but pretty close to it.

[36:41] But you know when you when you put 100% RGB LEDs in the game and you use it sparingly I think it

[36:50] makes a real big difference. I think a good example of this is when you look at Wizard of Oz and

[36:56] I'm not talking down to Wizard of Oz at all because that's just absolutely amazing what they did.

[37:00] But Wizard of Oz used RGB all the time. They were always like doing RGB little things here and

[37:07] there and like you know the rainbow lights on the play field where I'll always changing and doing

[37:12] stuff. But what I did was for the majority of the gameplay you know the the GI is white.

[37:20] The the insert lights are pretty much a single color but when you hit the pop bumper for instance

[37:29] it fires all of the LEDs in a linear fashion out away from the pop bumper in bright white fading

[37:37] it to like yellow like an explosion with fire you know. Right and that like it completely catches

[37:45] people off guard because you're you're thinking this is just a normal pinball machine. Oh great you

[37:49] know it just has some you know there's a purple LED over here there's a green one over here you

[37:53] know it's no big deal but all of a sudden when everything goes and like wipes across the play

[37:58] field it's it's just it's just such a good contrast. Right so if you don't have that contrast then

[38:04] it's you know you don't notice it as much. Scott when you look at a lot of the the new machines that

[38:10] are coming out and you look at their lighting do you say to yourself like these guys are just like

[38:18] scratching the surface of what's possible in terms of like creativity and using lighting differently

[38:24] and using sound differently. Well yeah for the most part I mean something really cool I think

[38:32] Star Trek, Star Trek Ellie and Star Trek Premium did a really good job of kind of grasping that

[38:39] new technology and saying like you know Stern was like hey we can do this check it out you know.

[38:45] And I think they did a really good job on that you know I I think a lot of these other companies

[38:50] just aren't there yet with the hardware. Obviously Stern is there they can do that I mean but

[38:56] like for instance Spooky's not there yet with all RGB it's things like you know Dutch Pimbo

[39:04] wasn't there with all RGB yet but like people are starting to get there and once the hardware

[39:08] becomes more available they're going to start digging deeper into it and doing wake cool or things

[39:13] and even I'm doing right now so it's I can't wait. What's like in terms of the machines that are

[39:19] out there right now your machine aside like what machine out there do you think has like the coolest

[39:25] lighting effects you've seen. Oh man I don't even know I mean they did some really cool stuff with

[39:32] I liked what they did in Game of Thrones Ellie there was some really cool RGB stuff going on

[39:38] there but you know at the same time we're still so early with this RGB stuff you know like people

[39:45] aren't really people aren't really experimenting and digging too deep yet so I hear you man because

[39:51] like when my magic girl RGB surface mount boards went out and I was looking for a technician like

[39:59] nobody works on RGB surface mount boards nobody I found like one dude who's coming over next week

[40:08] he works on J.J.P. and Walsh but but where there's a lot of surface mount I guess surface mount just

[40:17] boards is in the computer council world and this guy works a lot on computer councils but

[40:25] I'm nervous because my magic girl the only thing that it's worth like makes it worth

[40:31] wild is the blinking lights and the lights are out so I'm terrified but the the saving grace is

[40:39] that Dovel over at American Pimball they made the boards for magic girl it wasn't John it wasn't

[40:44] some mysterious board manufacturer so he'll help out but but like I've said it a million times like

[40:51] the light show on Pimball the light show and the sound are what make Pimball sing and I think

[41:00] your game so your game without artwork Scott really captivated people now let's talk about the

[41:06] art because I know the art has been a topic of conversation over the last few days now you're

[41:13] working with Matt Andrews who did the artwork on the magic girl cabinet on the rosa cabinet

[41:19] on the Houdini game that was scrapped by American Pimball how did you get contacted with Matt Andrews

[41:27] well you know Charlie and I were talking about it and I wanted to I wanted to really have

[41:34] some hand drawn stuff on this play field and on this back glass well just on the whole project

[41:40] actually so you know I was like he's like you know Matt Andrews is he's like a really good dude

[41:48] in like he I don't know where Charlie knew him from somewhere but yeah most likely he did the

[41:55] Ben Heck the Ben Heck's like zombie game like he yeah Ben Heck zombie adventure land

[42:03] absolutely that's right so I just shot him an email explaining the project and everything he said

[42:08] he's like absolutely I'm on board let's do this so I had a few meetings with him and just got

[42:13] kicked up so that was that easy looking at that looking at the total annihilation back like the

[42:21] back box right now you've got like the four sections for the scoring and then the LCD is that

[42:29] are those four sections of scoring remaining because like the the back glass art

[42:35] seems like it would have to overtake that area like how's it going to work yeah so what we are

[42:42] what we planned on doing is we're going to do two translates right or not translate but two back

[42:48] glasses those we're going to be they're going to be one without score displays in it and there's

[42:54] going to be one with score displays in it and we decided to do the one without the score displays

[43:01] first just in case we had to cost out the actual numeric displays on it because right now my proof

[43:09] of concept machine here is running Balli pin score displays which run on that old Balli protocol

[43:17] and it's like you know lots of extra wiring and everything and those displays are not cheap

[43:21] even at wholesale pricing so just in case we had to get rid of that we started with that back glass

[43:29] and then we're going to make another one but the real good news is that we have

[43:36] I don't actually go into here right now working on custom display modules for us

[43:43] which will be affordable and should be able to make that into the production version

[43:48] and so it got me thinking okay well I'm thinking I'm talking with Matt and I'm like well where are

[43:52] we going to put these displays we can put them anywhere right and I looked over I was at work

[43:58] one day and we have a you know we've got some machines over there there's a strange science

[44:03] sitting over there and I'm like do those displays are all along the bottom edge of the of the

[44:07] back glass I'm like that's that's perfect you know so my goal is to put those along the bottom

[44:15] edge of that back glass and not take away from anything that has been already done with that

[44:22] with that first illustration it just it looks so good that I just I did not want to mess with

[44:26] that at all it would wreck it to have displays right in the middle of it okay I'm looking

[44:31] to string time so they go like like along the bottom below the LCD no it's above the LCD

[44:38] above it's okay yeah so it's above the LCD but actually it will be on the bottom of the back glass

[44:45] so the back box for the game is going to be very similar to the Jetsons back box if you want to see

[44:54] how that LCD fits in there and the and the back glass fits in there the LCD will be obviously the

[45:00] full-size LCD and not the the Jetsons one isn't using 100% of the LCD's height but the this game

[45:09] will actually use the whole thing right okay and and so let me ask your question because I in

[45:17] Scott we've been talking and I've been telling you straight up I'm like as a marketer I'm like

[45:24] I see everybody announced early and share stuff early and then now you have to deal with like eight

[45:33] nine months of like pin-side people critiquing what you're doing and you're showing people how

[45:39] the sausages made and I'm like why like why why give this army of cynics like this opportunity

[45:48] you guys announced really early right because we're not going to see this game until what like

[45:54] the end of the year yeah it's going to hit the production line at the end of the year okay so

[46:00] do you feel like announcing as early as you guys did do you feel like that was a benefit or sort of

[46:08] like you just wanted to get it out but but now what right I mean now you got people critiquing the

[46:14] back glass and there's a long ways to go before we actually get the final package absolutely and I

[46:22] mean what I mean you already want me to start with the art or the playing field or the you know what I

[46:26] mean like like well so people see the back glass right and they're like critiquing it and you're like

[46:30] you haven't even seen the whole thing and it's like I I understand why people get hypercritical but

[46:37] but artwork without the entire package designed is just one piece of the puzzle

[46:47] um do you think it works for you or against you as you show this stuff so early you know that

[46:54] that's up in the air I think it still is a positive thing to show it early I mean we we decided

[47:00] to show it just because we you know it it was done and we were so proud of it and we're like you

[47:06] know what people are really gonna I think most people would really like it we knew people were

[47:10] going to not like it right it's certain people wouldn't you know that's normal um but you know

[47:17] so we decided to show it anyway um I think in this case though I I'm really not too worried about it

[47:24] yeah people are gonna have suggestions people are gonna say hey I don't like the character I don't

[47:28] like the color scheme or whatever um but I mean the it's done like it so you know it's not um

[47:37] this one's not changing the back glass is not gonna change it's exactly the way that I envisioned it

[47:43] when when it's put into the game with the play field and the cabinet will all make sense right

[47:49] you've got sort of this this female main character talk to me about that so how did that come about

[47:55] and so at first um Matt was like you know we should put the characters on the display you know like

[48:04] he's like I'll put a I'll put a male and a female on there so then the player can do something like

[48:10] hey I can I can you know I'm that guy or a girl's playing and she's like I'm that girl and I'm the

[48:15] one saving the day or whatever and I was like you know what I'm like I I don't want to have two

[48:21] people on there that's just kind of I don't know it's kind of strange so I was like let's just

[48:26] put the girl on there let's make her you know cute which is kind of that's a lot to ask of an

[48:32] artist who draws you know it draws stuff like this um because it's it's pretty tough to make

[48:39] somebody cute I think in art right I don't really know much about art but um I know according to

[48:47] Hilton all you got to do is put nipples on them and they're cute have you seen that well you know

[48:53] and the Hilton can do whatever he wants to after a fact you know yeah or whatever you know it doesn't

[48:59] uh yeah but you know I so I was like let's just put a cuker on there and she is going to be

[49:07] the character right you are like you are playing for her right so um I just thought it was kind of

[49:14] neat you know I and that's really it like I just thought it was a good idea it was neat and uh

[49:22] you know I think it's uh I think it was a good decision honestly when you when you see these guys

[49:27] though like wanting the girl to be more edgy and more sexy and more provocative are you kind of like

[49:35] really do we need to only have like slutty women on backlasses be the only thing that represent

[49:42] pinball like do you ever kind of feel like there's this push to make things raunchy for

[49:50] for no other reason than to have these guys like have something sexual because I I don't like

[49:57] it when it's overtly sexual for no other reason than to just appease like some

[50:03] older male demographic yeah no I mean and the reason we went with this is like I'm looking at her

[50:10] and we're we're just trying to make it you know make her cute obviously and me personally like

[50:15] I think a cute girl is way more attractive than a sexy girl you know what I'm talking about like

[50:21] a slutty girl you know that just it's a it's kind of just it's off-putting you know right but it

[50:28] and you look at her and on this back glass and I'm like wow like she's cute she's great like I'll

[50:33] you know I'm gonna fight for her you know like that's it's kind of cool um but yeah making it more edgy

[50:39] for just the sake of being edgy is just not something I'm gonna do like that just doesn't it's

[50:45] just not necessary so does does she make her way on to the cabinet art and and a playfield art

[50:52] Scott as of right now we're not far enough along yet to know what we're exactly doing there yet

[51:00] okay but she will we're gonna integrate her in the display so we've already started talking about it

[51:08] does she have a name is she like an actual character

[51:12] uh she does my wife can't put the name for but uh forget what it was

[51:18] don't tell her I hope she's not listening to this oh my god it's magic girl

[51:21] Chris you're gonna give me a trouble right so like like I like the artwork got shown and I think

[51:29] for the most part like people are are still like really excited like I haven't really seen people

[51:36] so excited about a whitewood game that is now going into production let's talk about production

[51:43] because this is the other area where I'm I'm I'm I'm curious about how spooky is gonna do this so

[51:51] we're talking 50 units at a time right there's there's no there's no total number we're gonna make

[52:00] and it's gonna go into production hopefully by the end of the year and we're talking like

[52:07] 50 units and then they're gonna assess how things are going they make 50 more so is that how it's

[52:12] gonna roll out uh so the rollout plan itself um it's kind of interesting actually because spooky's

[52:20] never really done this before um what it's gonna do or what they're gonna do is they're going to

[52:25] um get a list of 50 people who are interested in this thing uh do as soon as that list is full

[52:32] they're gonna do a run of 50 right once that run of 50 is done they'll take 50 more people

[52:38] and then run another 50 and they're just gonna keep doing that as an unlimited run until there's

[52:43] no more interest all right that it's it's definitely interesting I mean look as as a marketer

[52:51] in sky I tell you this like off the record all the time I'm like I'm like I don't know if that's

[52:56] the best way to do it but we'll see if that works because here's the thing it's like we keep seeing

[53:01] like stern whenever they announce like a limited number of games there there's just there's just

[53:07] the desire to own like a finite number of a limited version of something that drives people to buy

[53:15] um I'm curious to see how this works because I definitely know that people want this game

[53:21] like I I'm I'm not doubting that people want it um I think that we're gonna keep making it until

[53:28] people don't want it anymore is a little bit I I wouldn't necessarily do it that way but like I

[53:36] think if Charlie says look we're gonna make 300 you get you would sell out 300 in one day I think

[53:41] that's just the way of like the collector community um but this is exciting because your game is

[53:48] gone from being a show game that you made Scott to again that's actually gonna make it into production

[53:54] and I think the most exciting part about it is that spooky actually delivers on what they're

[54:02] gonna make right yeah let's talk about the climate of pinball right now because there's a lot of

[54:08] boutique manufacturers out there and a lot of them are struggling Scott they're struggling to get

[54:13] games out they're struggling to um you know actually manufacture games when when when when Charlie

[54:21] came to you is is there any concern that like spooky can make the game the way you want it to be

[54:28] exactly the way you want it to be now there's absolutely no concern whatsoever that is Charlie's

[54:34] number one fear is that they will make a game that does not meet my specifications right so it's

[54:39] gonna be it's gonna be exactly what we've seen it shows if not a little bit better no it's not

[54:44] gonna be exactly what you see it shows but what I'm going what I'm doing is I am well and there are

[54:50] parts of it they're actually going to be going to be better for sure um but I am within reasonable

[54:56] limits changing a few things like the cabinet right it's not gonna be a valley cabinet where you

[55:00] have to remove the head every time you want to move it you know right because doesn't fit through

[55:04] a doorway or whatever um it will have like a hinged back box it's gonna have you know a familiar

[55:10] style WPC cabinet with like the angle cut way down on it like an old school is it a spooky cabinet

[55:17] or is it gonna be a unique cabinet it's actually a spooky cabinet but it's modified okay so the

[55:24] the lower part of the cabinet is modified but the the head itself will be the same thing are the

[55:30] are the spooky ghosts gonna be on the speakers or no I'm probably not gonna put them there I

[55:36] I am probably going to put the ghosts on the hinges though all right I like that better

[55:41] yeah I'm gonna just black out the speakers so you don't really see them okay um and all the lights

[55:49] and everything like no compromises in terms of like what we've seen so far with like the lights and

[55:54] the RGBs and all that no because uh it's if you take that away you take away the you take life out

[56:00] of the game and there's just you can't do that right totally great so let's talk about pricing and

[56:08] I you don't have to give the price on this show here but the the build the materials and your machine

[56:15] and making sure like the integrity of what people have fallen in love with with Matt Andrews

[56:23] artwork um and then you the new cabinet what what ballpark are we coming in at do you think price-wise

[56:32] with this thing you know Chris I don't even have an idea yet we're still working we're still working

[56:37] on the BOM but we're trying to keep it as affordable as possible it's not could be we're not doing

[56:43] a money grab thing here why any means so let me give you guys some advice okay this is canada just

[56:49] going off I would think I know Charlie's like so obsessed with like everything around like $6,000

[56:58] but I think people will pay more for this game and I and I think the game itself um you know it has

[57:06] so much going on with it that $8,000 doesn't seem at it doesn't seem unreasonable to me considering

[57:17] what's out there again I keep I keep Batman 66 premium as like the benchmark like what people will

[57:23] spend $8,000 on and that's pretty pretty low in what they get for that much money um okay so this

[57:31] is coming out sometime q4 so so Scott should we see the you think by expo we're gonna see sort of

[57:40] like the final version of this game that's the plan hopefully okay and it talked me about like

[57:47] working with Matt Andrews like how how's that going are you sort of creative directing him on what

[57:53] you want to see on the back box on the on the play field on the cabinet like how's how's it working

[57:59] with Matt oh it's it's awesome working with Matt so um basically what I do is we just we have

[58:06] Skype meetings and we just talk through stuff and he will draw stuff live on the screen with his

[58:11] you know sharing a desktop and we'll uh you know we'll go back and forth and talk about things that

[58:15] you know that I want on the play field or things that I want on the back glass and you'll just kind

[58:19] of like mock things up for me it's really uh he's really easy to work with really cool guy he's uh

[58:26] you know I I haven't been in real life yet we're actually going to uh southern fried game room

[58:31] expo coming up here in june right yeah that's out in down o'lana and Matt's going to be there and

[58:38] he's gonna actually get a chance to play the game for the first time because we're bringing

[58:42] there the proof of concept game down there right do you so for for the play field do you just send

[58:48] him a CAD design of the play field or does he get like a white wood or how does that work

[58:54] I sent him the CAD files and he can he dumps those into his uh illustrating program and he uh

[59:00] can go right off of those which is really cool very cool very cool well

[59:07] so you gotta be excited man like you you sort of crossed over like you broke through you you

[59:13] broke through the like the the wrath of Olympus like hurdle like of this create like home brewed

[59:20] creative game that is actually gonna make its way into mass production like how does that feel

[59:26] that's it's unreal man I don't even know I don't even know how to feel man it's like the truth it's

[59:32] I'm very very excited about it um it seems too good to be true but at the same time uh you know

[59:39] it from the from watching people play this game I think uh there's just no question people are

[59:45] gonna enjoy it when it's done right now are you now are you gonna are you gonna send a game the

[59:49] George Gomez on the house or were you making pay for it I wish I had the money to do that that

[59:55] would be so awesome you could maybe trade them for Batman super early uh it's awesome

[01:00:04] Scott let's talk about like what what else is going on the hobby right because you're you're like

[01:00:10] you're in this like you work at pinball life like so pinball is like pretty much at the center

[01:00:16] of your day to day life right that that is my nine to five job yes okay so on this show we talk a

[01:00:25] lot about the the current pinball environment like what's coming out what's about to come out

[01:00:30] what are you most excited about in terms of what's about to come out in the pinball world

[01:00:36] besides your game which you're up to about yeah let me think about that you know um

[01:00:42] Houdini has some really cool stuff going on and you know I know the guy that's programming that game

[01:00:49] and he is yeah he is one of the best programmers that I know uh you know and I say one of them

[01:00:56] because he's one of the many that have done this kind of stuff uh and I have huge confidence he's

[01:01:03] gonna pull out some crazy stuff with the software um and I stole them in awe about that game and

[01:01:09] how they got it out so quickly and how it went from nothing to something and so little bit of time

[01:01:15] like it just wasn't saying so that's probably what I'm most excited about right now um I mean

[01:01:23] yeah I want to do any who did he might be coming out exactly at the same time your game might

[01:01:27] be coming out yeah yeah it's gonna be a battle to the death I guess I'm just god who's got this

[01:01:35] on the skin yeah they're so different they're so different in what they're delivering

[01:01:40] oh totally and and yeah I just you guys will see I think there's gonna be some really cool stuff going

[01:01:45] out with that right so okay so Houdini have you played dialed in at all what do you think

[01:01:52] have dialed in I have and it's it's interesting but you know what again like what makes a game fun

[01:01:59] for me is not putting a bunch of stuff on the play field it's um it's simple things like you know

[01:02:08] locking balls behind drop targets and crazy light shows or chucking a ball across the play field

[01:02:14] you know like a crazy distance you know like like little simple things like that uh get me excited

[01:02:20] about pinball but you know dialed in I mean Pat Lawler did a great job making that game I mean he

[01:02:26] took elements of wizard blocks where you know that he wasn't unable to finish because Williams

[01:02:32] closes doors uh he took elements of that and like worked him in which I thought was really cool and

[01:02:37] like a really neat you know throwback to it but honestly I mean there's just like a ton of

[01:02:41] stuff on that play field and I've played it a few times on location over at uh I think it's level

[01:02:46] 2567 has uh has one around here and uh you know it's it's it's fun but I don't really I don't think

[01:02:52] I get it yet I don't think I played it enough or been in a place where I can hear it well enough to

[01:02:59] you know kind of figure it out so I'm I'm at a disadvantage because of that right you know I

[01:03:03] think it's a fair sort of assessment of the game and I've played it a bunch and I have it to

[01:03:09] pause it down on one it's one of these things where like it's Pat Lawler like I'm supposed to just

[01:03:14] absolutely want it um but I I think to your point Scott the part that's still missing for me

[01:03:22] is just like the narrative like what's the purpose of this game like I get what's going on and I see

[01:03:29] all the fun stuff and the magnets and all these things to shoot um but I'm not quite sure like what

[01:03:34] my objective is in the game and and and and and and and how I sort of play as the the main character

[01:03:41] throughout that narrative and and we'll see I think a lot of these games too at shows you don't really get

[01:03:46] um the right environment to experience like what they're going for have you played I'm trying to

[01:03:54] think like what else are you a you a Star Wars fanboy because that's like the big one this summer's

[01:03:58] Star Wars oh I'm the I'm a different kind of nerd and I mean there yeah people are going to hate

[01:04:04] me for but I just I'm really I'm not really into Star Wars or Star Trek or anything like that um

[01:04:09] I am excited to see what Stern does with Star Wars though because I mean Stern hasn't even come out

[01:04:16] and said that they were making that yet do I know how do you even know how do they even know they're

[01:04:20] going to make that game I mean it's so much like it's like it's it's sort of like the like the worst

[01:04:27] kept secret it's like Ghostbusters like everyone knew before they announced it and and we're in

[01:04:32] the same boat now or like they haven't officially announced it but like everybody like I've talked

[01:04:37] to people of play they've played Stern Star Wars at Stern like they've told me what it's like

[01:04:44] to play it and yet they won't announce it yet so the the rumor is though now and said I'm hoping

[01:04:51] May 25th which is which is the actual 40th anniversary of Star Wars I heard May 4th yeah but that's

[01:04:59] God I I I was spreading that rumor for the longest time because they want to sell more

[01:05:07] aerospace myth is what I heard like they're just trying to stall well it's okay I mean and you know

[01:05:13] you you've got to be careful with that too I mean you could be your own worst enemy man you

[01:05:17] could be your own competition from you know Scott what what what's exciting though about what

[01:05:24] you're doing and I think Pimball Magic is something that is is is is lost and in a lot of these

[01:05:33] new machines and I think what your game is brought back to people sort of it's just consciousness is

[01:05:41] Pimball can be what you want Pimball to be right it doesn't need to be ramps it doesn't need to be

[01:05:49] multiple playfields a Pimball can be anything that has the pin bouncing around a playfield and you

[01:05:57] can use music you can use lights you can use theme you you can you can take this entire sort of

[01:06:06] industry in a different direction and in your case I think you're bringing it a little bit back

[01:06:11] to a simple place in terms of playfield layout but forward in terms of lights and sound and

[01:06:19] experience right I mean that's what excites me about what you're doing is is you're approaching a

[01:06:25] completely outside the box where everyone's going right now with Pimball yeah so it's kind of

[01:06:32] interesting actually because I think games right now are trending to be they're just they're

[01:06:38] more and more complicated each time they come out right someone's like hey I've created another

[01:06:43] game that's more complicated than the one before it you know and this just keeps going on and we're

[01:06:48] at a point now where these games are so complicated like dialed in there's just I'm not knocking at

[01:06:53] whatsoever but if there's just so much on that playfield you know you don't you don't need that so

[01:06:59] what I did is I hit all the complicated stuff you know and I just kind of brought it back a little

[01:07:04] bit but but there is you know it's a good point you brought you know saying like I kind of brought

[01:07:09] it back a little bit but then you know pushed it forward with the with the technology and you know

[01:07:14] I think that's kind of what people need to do you need to I'm hoping designers sit back and say hey

[01:07:20] what what makes a game fun for me and make a list and and kind of go off of that you know I agree

[01:07:27] and and I've been sort of defending my magic girl purchase since I bought it but the the game itself

[01:07:33] it plays more like a modern EM with amazing lights amazing sound and an amazing display and I tell

[01:07:43] people all the time like none of this stuff that John wanted to work like works like none of the

[01:07:50] complex stuff even functions in the game but it's so much fun without that stuff that he didn't even

[01:07:57] need it he didn't need it he spent years trying to get balls to levitate balls to shoot all over the

[01:08:05] place but at the end of the day if you have great sound great art great light show people are

[01:08:13] gonna have fun they're gonna have fun I totally agree I'm right there with you I'm in yeah and

[01:08:18] and I think you can still do cool little tricks I mean I like what I do with this one I've got

[01:08:24] slingshots aimed at each other people are like wow I just want to hit it up into the reactor core

[01:08:29] and just beat the crap out of the reactor because that's crazy well and and Scott like your ball

[01:08:34] lock right with the drop target to lock the ball yeah simple stuff you see you see the ball lock

[01:08:42] you're satisfied I mean there's there's I really do applaud your efforts because I think pinball's

[01:08:49] gotten a little bit lost and it's and it's like all these new games coming out they're all trying to

[01:08:55] like you know do more more and more but someone along the way like they've lost the simplicity that

[01:09:03] made pinball really fun and I think that's why your game as it's done the tours of these shows has

[01:09:11] won people over because even like just the music Scott like I gotta be honest like it sounds

[01:09:16] amazing it's like you when when you when you when you're walking by your game you're drawn into it

[01:09:23] when you see the lights you're drawn into it um and and that speaks volumes to what makes pinball so

[01:09:32] unique and I think you're bringing that package to life and I think um you know I think a lot of

[01:09:37] people are excited to see what the the total package is going to be for this game absolutely yeah

[01:09:43] I think I also think there's a kind of an untapped genre of music that you know really hasn't been

[01:09:50] done too much in pinball and it's like a really driving hard electronic music you know I mean

[01:09:56] there has been games with electronic music getting them before but you know I really put some

[01:10:01] stuff in there that was this it's pretty hard techno music you know right so I'll I'll go one

[01:10:09] step further and say that I think most music in pinball is pretty bad like it's uninspired it's

[01:10:16] like either just stuff from the theme of like these IPs but but but nobody really looks at it like

[01:10:24] how do I just make the music like incredible how do I make the light show incredible

[01:10:29] um and look Scott you got a white wood like your white wood like one people over there's no

[01:10:36] art on it and you know like canada like I I consider art to be the most important part of a game

[01:10:43] without even art you've already managed to win over a lot of people so you must be really excited

[01:10:49] knowing that I I get to put the icing on the cake and the cake people love already

[01:10:58] like that's got to be a good feeling yeah it definitely is for sure um something one of my

[01:11:04] buddies said to me actually he's like uh when you play the game you forget that it's a white wood

[01:11:10] completely right so he's like he's like it doesn't even register in your head that you're playing a

[01:11:15] game without art on the play field you know I've got some hands scribbled things on the inserts just

[01:11:21] so I can program it you know but uh and you know just some basic things but he's like it's

[01:11:28] you you tell a story without actually having stuff written on the play field and I think he's

[01:11:35] like that was it was really good and he's like I think it's just gonna carry through and it's when

[01:11:39] it's done it'll have artwork on it but I mean when you're gonna be playing this play field

[01:11:43] with or playing this Pimmo machine uh with the play field art on it he's like you're probably

[01:11:48] gonna forget about it while you're playing but then you know when you're done you're like holy crap

[01:11:52] it's you know it's gonna look amazing you know so I think it should be really good when it's done

[01:11:57] I mean like I gotta be honest got like right now in whitewood form your machine is the best spooky

[01:12:04] machine ever and it's not knocking the first two games but I'm just saying like this isn't I

[01:12:11] think your game is as important to you as it is to spooky as a manufacturer and I give Charlie

[01:12:19] credit because Charlie recognized that people were really gravitating towards your machine and

[01:12:25] and you know if you look at a pinball manufacturer as a record label right as let's say the death row

[01:12:32] records they just signed two pock with your game I mean that's like it's a it's a big move for Charlie

[01:12:37] and I think it's really it's it's a really important move with total nuclear annihilation and

[01:12:43] Alice Cooper coming out in the in you know the third and fourth quarter I think it's it's it really

[01:12:50] puts spooky on the map in a really interesting way moving forward yeah and and I gotta say to Charlie

[01:12:57] is really proud of the game as well you know he is uh he's a big supporter of it I mean it's not just

[01:13:04] he's not just looking at it as like hey this would be good for spooky even though you know you know

[01:13:08] you know I probably is it's that's not how he's looking at it he's looking at it like hey we can

[01:13:14] put this game out we're gonna get this into people's houses it just needs to exist right um sideball

[01:13:21] question uh do you think highway pinball is gonna make it oh god I hope so I really I don't

[01:13:27] have your hopes so but do you think what do you what's your gut tell you my gut tells me they'll

[01:13:32] probably be okay um I don't know any like I don't know anything more than you do about it I mean I just

[01:13:39] I can listen to my podcast right I mean we're I lay out the I lay out the reality of all the promises

[01:13:47] and all the misdeadlines I mean so you think they're gonna make you think they're gonna pull through

[01:13:51] this difficult period and just make it to mass production I'm saying I'm I'm hoping I'm hoping so

[01:13:58] hard I'm thinking they will well because I mean pinball companies failing and taking people's money

[01:14:03] and and failing is really not good for our hobby like terrible I mean that's it's it's awful I mean

[01:14:10] I don't want to see any of these companies fail at all right I don't I don't want to see anyone

[01:14:15] failing either I'm the same boat as you um but but I also have to look at companies with a little

[01:14:21] bit more of an an objective lens and say like well man like skyd if you were to tell me total

[01:14:29] annihilation when is coming out in fourth quarter of 2017 right and you you're not shipping by even

[01:14:37] 2019 I'm like what the fuck is gone wrong yeah yeah and so that's kind of where I'm at with

[01:14:45] highways like two years later we're still on a mass production yeah I don't know what the holdup

[01:14:53] would be I'm not sure what's going on with those guys but uh I hope what about what about Dutch

[01:14:58] pinball they gonna pull through I hope so as well I think it would be a lot of hope I can say is

[01:15:03] I hope so because I don't really know and I don't want to I don't want to say like yeah I think

[01:15:09] Dutch pinball is going to be great and you know 100% like you'll get your game tomorrow you know I

[01:15:14] and I don't want to say I don't want to say no I don't think you know I think something bad is

[01:15:18] gonna have I don't but you know here's here's the important part anybody anybody out there who

[01:15:24] wants a total nuclear annihilation will get one and that that's something to be proud of and it's

[01:15:32] something that Charlie and company should be proud of is that spooky pinball is the only company

[01:15:39] next to Stern that is delivered games to customers when they promised the only one that that's an

[01:15:48] amazing accolade in my book yeah I agree with you completely um yeah spooky's track record they

[01:15:57] he did it right I mean he started out slow in you know and just you know we're going going real

[01:16:04] easy kind of eased into it a little bit and he's progressing the games are getting higher and higher

[01:16:10] quality as you go I mean there's significant changes happening on each game right to just bring

[01:16:17] it up a level you know no it's exciting and and Scott we look forward to your game coming out we

[01:16:25] look forward to Alice Cooper we look forward to Ben Hex next game I want to I want to thank you for

[01:16:31] taking the time to come on the show and talk about this you know me I've been I've been bugging you

[01:16:36] to come on for for a few weeks now you you you gave me a little bit of the you know you had to go

[01:16:44] on Charlie's show first I get it as I said like Charlie's making your game if Canadian was making

[01:16:49] games and then I could dictate more of a timeline for for the designers to come on the shows but

[01:16:55] we we wish you nothing but the best of luck you're you're an amazing guy I'm just gonna go off

[01:17:01] on a little bit of a of a rant about how amazing you are Scott but you you work in the industry on

[01:17:09] your in your spare time you developed a game that people have loved tremendously that George Gomez

[01:17:17] one of the best designers of all time said the only game I would buy if I wasn't buying a stern

[01:17:24] would be Scott Denise's total I'm gonna say nuclear annihilation other than the name this change

[01:17:31] but I just have to say like I think what you're doing is amazing I think that um the fact that

[01:17:37] people will be able to get this game probably by the end of the year um there's no shenanigans with

[01:17:44] limited edition and all this jazz like it's just gonna be something people can get for their

[01:17:49] game rooms and I think it's a completely different type of pinball machine that focuses on fun

[01:17:56] which is the key like of all of this these are toys like they're supposed to be fun yeah I'm super

[01:18:02] excited Scott and and I I've loved seeing you at shows I'm a big fan and I really appreciate

[01:18:08] you taking the time to come on and and talk to me and talk to my guest about what you're working on

[01:18:14] no problem Chris thank you so much I appreciate it too man all right now all you have to do now is

[01:18:19] go fix the Jetsons game and make it good all right that's good it's good it's good okay we we joke we

[01:18:27] joke at this podcast I mean this all right well Scott um any any final words on people

[01:18:35] who are thinking about your game or just the industry like should they wait should they hold

[01:18:41] their money for fourth quarter I think people should play this game before they actually buy one I

[01:18:47] mean they should it's it people are like on the fence about it like when they first uh like some

[01:18:53] people came to me at mgc and they're like oh you know I I might buy one of these things and

[01:18:57] like they play it they're like well you know it kind of sells itself which is kind of interesting

[01:19:01] because you know you you look at it and it looks very simple and people are like kind of put like

[01:19:06] the kind of awkward by that like it's just not right they're like I don't know man but

[01:19:10] when you play it I think you'll have a different perspective on it so you'll at least

[01:19:14] better where can people play it moving forward are you are you gonna keep bringing it to shows

[01:19:19] throughout the year like what's the next stop for this thing yeah so well the next stop is the

[01:19:24] southern fried game or mexpo in june and then after that I'm not really sure I mean I have to

[01:19:31] remember you guys I've I've got a day job that you know and x amount of vacation days so it's

[01:19:37] really you know kind of tough for me to take a bunch of time off but I will be talking to spooky

[01:19:44] seeing what the schedule looks like but you know we haven't brought the game down to Atlanta yet so

[01:19:51] we'll be doing that in june one final selfish question Scott so you you're also like a programmer right

[01:20:01] yeah sort of okay so you know that the the guy who programmed and coded magic girl has

[01:20:08] has quit the project in a blaze of glory say city on on our Facebook group he's like have a good

[01:20:15] life everybody you'll never hear from me again oh man I know I know yeah I'm friends with Jim I mean

[01:20:23] he's a he's a really nice guy he means well he's been you know he's been through the ringer man

[01:20:29] I mean this is I feel I feel for a man seriously is there is there any hope for us magical owners

[01:20:36] that we could actually get like decent code with what's existing in the game if I sent you my

[01:20:42] magic girl could you like work something on it or no yeah it all my spare time Chris yeah

[01:20:50] I'll say this though like the the magic girl owners they got money like I you know I think

[01:20:56] where Jim played played the cards wrong was like he should have just like realize he's got 25

[01:21:03] guys with a bunch of cash and just got us to pay up immediately but anyway we'll talk at a later

[01:21:10] date about the fix for magic girl which is going to be a dark cloud over this hobby for many years

[01:21:18] to come but anyway Scott I appreciate you coming on we wish you nothing but the best of luck with

[01:21:25] total nuclear annihilation we can't to see we can't wait to see morbid revealed but here's my

[01:21:30] marketing advice don't reveal it piece by piece anymore just show the final thing at one point

[01:21:37] yeah we're not we're gonna just we're gonna hold off now and it's gonna be the next time you see

[01:21:43] the artwork or any kind of reveal of the new artwork it's going to be on a machine with a

[01:21:49] populated place you'll wish that that's the way to do it I told you earlier today like

[01:21:56] in the thread I've got oric who we've we've we've we've burned the hatchet but I love I love the

[01:22:03] irony of oric telling people to be nice about artwork he's like the one guy who's never

[01:22:10] nice to everyone else but like at the end of the day I think the art's gonna be great mad

[01:22:16] Andrews is phenomenal the art looks great as it is and the game is gonna be it's gonna be incredible

[01:22:23] I really do because I think it's it's it's focusing on fun it's it's it's bringing a different

[01:22:28] element of people's like pinball collections and I think that's the key point is it's not just

[01:22:33] another stern it's not just another game it's a different game in a lineup that stands out

[01:22:39] tremendously for the right reasons and I think you're gonna have a hit on your hands so

[01:22:44] right we got a fast four o'clock for another eight months while try to figure out what to do with my money

[01:22:51] awesome thank you so much for it so I appreciate it too all right Scott have a great have a great

[01:22:55] end of your Sunday night and we'll talk to you soon all right sounds good man see you thanks all right bye
