[00:00] That was one thing when I first showed up without smarter

[00:06] Mine and changes over the

[00:12] Mine and changes over the

[00:20] Ah, good morning everybody! Welcome to Canatus Pimbal Podcast

[00:24] The only Pimbal Podcast that's been telling everybody

[00:27] Wait and see and why by now and now it is a self-fulfilling

[00:31] Prophecy I woke up this morning and I saw a

[00:34] Foo Fighters Ellie, new in box, Foo Fighters Ellie

[00:37] The game of the year, it is going to be the game of the year

[00:40] It is a phenomenal Pimbal machine, Jack Danger's

[00:43] inaugural effort, it is such a good machine

[00:46] You can now go get it, new in box for $9,995

[00:53] Now this is symbolic of where this entire market is right now

[00:57] It's symbolic that the Pimbal marketplace has flat-lined people

[01:01] Nobody is buying Elton John and now games that people bought less than a year ago

[01:07] is losing this much money in value and what is the phrase people always say

[01:12] The market will correct itself, the market will dictate where price is net out

[01:18] And so this morning this game has now lost $3,000 over the price it was brand new

[01:25] And the game is still brand new in a box

[01:28] So now $999 people who own the other Foo Fighters Ellie machines

[01:34] All of those machines are now worth either this much money or less

[01:39] And most of those machines are opened up so they're not even new in box

[01:45] And do you think the Pimbal market can absorb these kinds of losses on a single year ownership of a game?

[01:52] And the real death of the Pimbal market will be when people cannot sell their used games to free up money and space to buy the new in box games

[02:03] Here's what makes no sense to me

[02:06] How long can this marketplace survive when Ellie's are sliding down right to the price of premiums

[02:13] in less than a year?

[02:15] So then everybody who bought an Ellie machine is going to lose 30% value in the game

[02:21] And they're going to be okay with that?

[02:23] It's not going to happen

[02:25] And basically what we're seeing is this

[02:27] Stern Pimbal never should have raised the prices of Ellie machines over the $10,500 mark that they had for Godzilla Ellie

[02:37] It was the perfect price for the Ellie

[02:39] Especially if they're going to make a thousand units but the moment they make a thousand units at $13,000 a pop

[02:47] Look what happens the market is oversaturated because there's too many of them and there's too much money

[02:53] And that's a recipe for disaster in any marketplace

[02:57] So what do you think those 999 people are feeling like today?

[03:01] And all of a sudden this hobby where one of the greatest selling points of this hobby for people

[03:06] Was you weren't really going to lose much money?

[03:08] I've been in this hobby for 10 years

[03:10] I'm not some newbie running out there buying every single new game

[03:14] I'm not some distributor screaming at you buy buy buy

[03:16] And now look at where that message is

[03:18] You don't hear I'm saying that much anymore because it's an ignorant statement

[03:22] But in all of these years of watching this hobby

[03:24] You know buy buy buy

[03:26] You used to mean something because you could buy everything and you wouldn't lose much money

[03:32] But now it is absolutely collapsing and now the question becomes

[03:36] Who's going to be the company that actually acknowledges this?

[03:40] If one of these big companies does not wake up to the new market reality

[03:44] This entire industry is headed for very very dark times

[03:48] I think the only companies that are going to be immune to it are going to be the smaller boutique companies

[03:52] That actually offer you a game at what is a much better value

[03:56] But think about it like this

[03:58] If everybody is watching these stern machines lose so much money in such a short period of time

[04:06] And every week stern pimbal is making hundreds of games every month

[04:10] They are putting thousands of games inside boxes

[04:14] And those games need to find a home who's buying all of those games

[04:20] You know I've been hearing from distributors

[04:22] Sales are absolutely flat

[04:24] Nothing is moving and if you think those clearance sale prices have helped them at all

[04:30] It doesn't even matter if you take off $2,000 from the price of those games

[04:34] Because here's why when you remove $2,000 from the price of those games

[04:38] That's what those games used to cost

[04:40] And these are themes that nobody really wants

[04:44] I mean who even wants one of those home versions of a stern machine

[04:48] I don't care how much you put the word sale up and big discounts, big bargains

[04:52] People are not buying

[04:54] They're just not buying this stuff and why would they?

[04:56] Why would they?

[04:58] And I get it that everyone's just waiting for jaws to come out

[05:02] As if that one game is going to be able to save this entire industry

[05:06] It's not, we need a market correction on prices from the factory

[05:12] It is over, this is not going to work

[05:14] These inflated prices, it is not sustainable

[05:18] And it is a domino effect that we are now witnessing and it is happening

[05:22] I've been reaching out to my distributor friends

[05:24] And they don't really know what to do

[05:26] Sales are very, very weak and they're only going to get worse

[05:30] Because the thing about Pimbal is this

[05:32] For people to get the money they need to buy the jaws at least

[05:36] And buy the L-vira freaking black and white editions

[05:38] And buy a stranger things

[05:40] For most people out there

[05:42] You need to sell something to get the new stuff

[05:44] It's not just a monetary thing

[05:46] Some people need to make room for that new game

[05:48] Even if they have a lot of money they need to free up space

[05:50] So for those people they need to sell a used game

[05:54] For some people out there to get new games

[05:56] They're all not multi-millionaires

[05:58] They need to sell some of their old games to free up some money to get one of the newer games

[06:02] But now we've got this terrible scenario

[06:04] It's a war on two fronts that everybody is losing

[06:08] Because consumers can't sell their used games quickly anymore

[06:12] Nobody is biting and why would anybody bite

[06:14] The other thing too is like for a lot of these used pin sellers

[06:18] They're still delusional

[06:20] They're still pricing their games as if it's still COVID-Frenzy

[06:24] And they want premium top dollar for their machines

[06:26] You're not going to get it

[06:28] You're only going to get it on a handful of super rare machines

[06:32] And we all know which games those are

[06:34] But for everybody else out there

[06:36] Good luck trying to recoup your investment in Pimbal

[06:38] Unless you have one of those super desirable machines

[06:40] And people are reluctant to see how far down the price needs to go to move the item

[06:46] And that's where we're at right now

[06:48] And that's why the title of this show is so damn shocking

[06:52] That $999 people just had $3,000 in value

[06:56] Arraiced from their food fighters Ellie

[07:00] Now what does that mean for James Bond Ellie's

[07:02] What does it mean for other Stern machines

[07:04] I think everyone is saying loud and clear

[07:06] We think the price of a new inbox Stern Ellie

[07:10] Should be $10,000

[07:12] We think the price of a new inbox

[07:14] Jersey Jack Collector's Edition

[07:16] Should be no more than $12,500

[07:18] I mean even Guns n' Roses CE is now a $13,000 new inbox game

[07:24] That game used to sell for $20,000

[07:28] At the height of its launch

[07:30] $20,000 for a new inbox GNR CE

[07:34] Same exact game

[07:36] 2023, November

[07:38] $13,000

[07:40] The market has slid way back down

[07:44] So who's gonna do it? Do you think anyone's gonna do it?

[07:46] I think Stern has to be nervous

[07:48] I mean you know Stern is calling up its distributors

[07:50] And telling them like,

[07:50] JAWS is coming, don't worry, it's gonna solve everything

[07:54] And I'm telling you right now, I don't even care about JAWS Ellie anymore

[07:56] I don't wanna buy any Stern Ellie's at $13,000

[08:00] Because we all know the other thing they're gonna do is this

[08:02] They're gonna make more versions of that game

[08:04] They're gonna make an anniversary edition of JAWS in 2025

[08:08] So if you go buy this JAWS for $13,000

[08:12] Guess what? They're gonna make a nicer version of the game

[08:14] Like a year from now

[08:16] And you know why we know this?

[08:18] Because look at what Stern's been doing

[08:20] This is exactly what they're doing

[08:22] They did it with Jurassic Park

[08:24] They did it with El Vira

[08:26] We know they're gonna do it with Godzilla

[08:28] And we know they're gonna do it with JAWS

[08:30] Business model, they absolutely are just gonna screw over everybody

[08:34] That is plunking down so much money

[08:36] They want every single penny of the second hand value of these machines

[08:42] They wanna capture that instantly on new inbox sales

[08:46] And guess what's gonna happen?

[08:48] They're gonna collapse their own market

[08:50] They already have people

[08:52] If you think this market is not collapsing

[08:54] It is collapsing

[08:56] I think there's some delusional people that are holding on

[08:58] I have never seen this before

[09:00] Has anyone lived through a period in Pimball

[09:04] In which prices went through the roof

[09:06] On every single game

[09:08] And then they jacked up the number of Ellie machines across the board

[09:12] And the train is not gonna stop people

[09:14] They've moved into a much larger factory

[09:16] Think about this for a minute

[09:18] Stern has to make a lot more games to justify that factory

[09:22] And I heard from a very reliable source

[09:24] Games are piling up at Stern Pimball in boxes

[09:28] It's gonna look like that scene from Indiana Jones

[09:30] And Raiders of the Lost Ark

[09:32] You know the military archives with all of the boxes

[09:34] That's what Stern Pimball is gonna look like

[09:36] If every single person out there starts saying

[09:38] Hey, I'm not gonna buy right now

[09:40] I'm gonna wait and see

[09:42] Even distributors are not gonna be able to take large allotments

[09:46] Who's gonna be writing checks for hundreds of thousands

[09:48] If not millions of dollars in inventory

[09:50] That is not gonna move

[09:52] And the problem now is they've all painted themselves into a corner

[09:56] Stern and Jersey jack

[09:58] They've painted themselves into a corner

[10:00] Because think about it now

[10:02] If they reduce the prices of these Ellie machines

[10:04] Which they need to

[10:06] Then they're gonna have thousands of people

[10:08] Who spent money at 13,000 dollars

[10:10] Who are gonna feel ripped off

[10:12] And burned by them

[10:14] And are not gonna wanna buy from them again

[10:16] It's really bad people

[10:18] I know it sound a little bit like the sky is falling

[10:20] But I never wanted to see Pimball come to this

[10:22] Years ago I used to say that they could charge more for like a super premium edition machine

[10:28] I've always believed this

[10:30] There are super wealthy collectors out there

[10:32] And you can make that man SLE's for people like that

[10:36] But you gotta be very careful about how you serve the high end market

[10:40] And they did it all wrong

[10:42] Basically now

[10:44] They're charging us those high end prices

[10:46] People remember a sternly with a topper is basically like 15,000 dollars

[10:52] So they've basically done this

[10:54] They've basically charged us what used to be the price on a very very rare and limited and unique item

[11:00] And now they're pricing every single horse as if they're selling you a unicorn

[11:04] And they're not

[11:06] A Batman SLE is kind of a unicorn

[11:08] But a food fighter is Ellie is just a regular horse

[11:12] There's a thousand of them out there in the world

[11:14] And so that's what they've done

[11:16] That's what they've done

[11:18] And now it's got more and more people just saying wait a minute on all of these games

[11:22] It's not just stern, it's not just Jersey Jack

[11:24] If you think Labyrinth is gonna hold value at $10,600

[11:28] You know it's not

[11:30] And it has nothing to do with the game

[11:32] It has nothing to do with the game

[11:34] It has to do with the simple fact

[11:36] If everybody's slowing down their purchasing

[11:38] And everybody is waiting it out

[11:40] Then now we have the power to control the prices on these games

[11:44] And they're only gonna go south

[11:46] And if you don't run at stuff right away

[11:48] And you don't listen to the shells

[11:50] And you don't believe the hype

[11:52] And the FOMO which is now dead ladies and gentlemen

[11:54] Everything's gonna go south instantly

[11:56] It's happening in the auto industry

[11:58] Go look at used car sales right now

[12:00] They were crazy during COVID

[12:02] I sold my Honda Civic Type R

[12:04] I bought it for $35,000

[12:06] I sold it three years later

[12:08] In the height of COVID for $37,000

[12:12] Back to the dealership

[12:14] I recently got a Carvana appraisal of the car today

[12:18] It's now worth $27,000

[12:20] Okay?

[12:22] But yet somehow in the world of Pimbal

[12:24] It's so niche and it means so much to us emotionally

[12:28] Nobody is willing to accept the harsh reality

[12:32] This industry needs to go through a correction

[12:34] And we're doing it

[12:36] We're doing it, you and me are responsible for these prices

[12:40] Sliding back down to earth

[12:42] And look, as a consumer

[12:44] It's a good thing

[12:46] We don't want to see any of these Pimbal companies go away by the way

[12:48] I mean we love seeing all the variety

[12:50] All the passion, all the personalities

[12:52] Putting their heart and soul into these games

[12:54] But the truth is

[12:56] They're gonna go away unless they figure this thing out

[12:58] And there's no more company vulnerable than Stern Pimbal

[13:02] They have the most at stake

[13:04] Employees, they need to make hundreds of games a week

[13:08] And if they continue doing it like this, it's all gonna fail

[13:10] And I'm not asking it to go back to like eight years ago, nine years ago

[13:14] I'm just asking it to go back to where Godzilla was

[13:16] Because remember, Godzilla was right at the beginning of COVID

[13:20] $10,500 for NLE

[13:22] Your distributors are making about $1,500 to $2,000 on every one they sell

[13:28] Everybody won

[13:30] And if a game was good, it went up a little bit in value

[13:32] Of a light of game like $4,000 on your Godzilla value

[13:36] But if a game wasn't great, right?

[13:38] It was just a mediocre Ellie machine like a Venom

[13:40] That game is not gonna lose $3,000 to $4,000

[13:42] It might only lose like a 1,500

[13:46] You know, there was still some baked-in value into everything

[13:50] And how many of you out there have told your wife

[13:52] Oh, the reason I'm in the Pimbal is I'm not gonna lose much money

[13:54] And I know a lot of guys that have been in this hobby for well over ten years

[13:58] And you used to get your machines for a few hundred bucks

[14:00] So a lot of those guys are looking at their collections and being like well I'm still up overall

[14:04] But here's the problem, even those old guys that are used to never losing money

[14:08] They're addicted to Pimbal

[14:10] They buy new machines every year

[14:12] They buy about 2-3 new machines every year

[14:14] And they are not used to losing 3-4,000 on every machine

[14:20] If you went in on James Bond's 60th for MSRP

[14:24] And on Food Fighters

[14:26] And on VenomLE

[14:28] If you just bought those 3 games from Stern Pimbal

[14:32] You lost more than like $12,000 in value in one year

[14:38] Simply buying 3 machines new in box

[14:40] And you tell me this market is not stalling

[14:44] You tell me it's not gonna flatline the new in box sales

[14:46] You tell me distributors aren't nervous

[14:48] You tell me these companies aren't being delusional

[14:50] It's all happening right now

[14:52] And then the real question is gonna be like

[14:54] How is everybody gonna dig themselves out?

[14:56] I think it's gonna be the battleground of the next like 6 months to a year

[15:00] I think smaller boutiques like Spooky and barrels of fun

[15:04] And Dutch Pimbal I think they're gonna be fine

[15:06] Because their operations aren't so big

[15:08] We know Jersey Jack Pimbal

[15:10] I don't even know how to discuss Jersey Jack Pimbal

[15:12] Because they be out of business it wasn't for the Ab his family

[15:14] Nobody's buying Elton John

[15:16] The game's flatlined in sales

[15:18] It doesn't matter what they do

[15:20] And the more they show gameplay of this game

[15:22] It's making it worse

[15:24] Because every time you see the gameplay

[15:26] There's no toys in the damn game

[15:28] And then the damn LCD screen looks like a cheap screen saver

[15:30] Like it's not gonna work

[15:32] There's nothing they're gonna be able to do with gameplay footage

[15:34] To get people excited about this game

[15:36] And everyone's in the same boat with Elton John

[15:38] Can't wait to play one

[15:40] I bet it's fun

[15:42] I bet it's Jersey Jack's best shooting game to date

[15:44] But nobody wants the theme

[15:46] And no one's gonna plunk down 12 to 15 thousand dollars

[15:48] When you know you're gonna lose 3 thousand dollars

[15:50] When you know you're gonna lose 3 thousand dollars

[15:52] On the cardboard box

[15:54] And that's my final point ladies and gentlemen

[15:56] This hobby is now making it so the cardboard box

[16:00] Is a 3 thousand dollar item

[16:02] I would like to know how much that cardboard box actually costs a company

[16:06] What like 50 bucks at most

[16:08] Not even probably 10 dollars for the cardboard box

[16:12] We are now losing 3 thousand dollars

[16:14] Every time we open up some of these machines

[16:16] It's not the way I want it to start out on a Monday

[16:18] But I saw this and I just feel bad

[16:20] My condolences to each and every one of you

[16:22] Who owns a food fighter Ellie

[16:24] If you just listen to canada

[16:26] I would have saved you money

[16:28] And it's crazy right? That's a new unbox game

[16:30] That means like an open up used food fighters Ellie

[16:34] Is now worth less than that

[16:36] What? 9,500? 9,000?

[16:38] A 4,000 dollar hit

[16:40] I hope you guys play your machines

[16:42] The only silver lining in all of this

[16:44] Is you better play your games

[16:46] 4,000 times or else you're losing money

[16:48] So for these collectors out there

[16:50] I got a food fighter Ellie

[16:52] It's only got 120 plays

[16:54] You know if you only put 100 plays on your food fighter Ellie

[16:56] Then that's 30 dollars per play

[16:58] I hope you're enjoying the machine everybody

[17:00] Everybody welcome to canada's pinball podcast

[17:02] We're going to be back more of this week with more shows

[17:04] Just wanted to stay focused on this topic for today

[17:06] Have a great Monday

[17:08] We'll be back

[17:10] And I want to give an extra special shout out

[17:12] To spooky pinball for the care package

[17:14] They sent me if you haven't seen my Saturday morning spectacular

[17:18] Go check it out

[17:20] It's going to be customer service like that

[17:22] And companies that actually care about the community

[17:24] Again if you have to decide where to spend your money

[17:26] I'm going to spend my money on companies that care

[17:30] And I'm starting to feel like Stern and Jersey Jack

[17:32] I don't feel the love anymore

[17:34] Like I used to from some of those companies

[17:36] Everybody have a great day

[17:38] We'll talk to you soon

[18:10] Thank you
