[00:00] What the Knator then released a post on his Facebook page stating that

[00:04] L1's actually making the fourth game.

[00:06] That seems super unlikely to me.

[00:09] That seems super unlikely to me.

[00:12] We had Knator's Pinball podcast literally holding court for the last week in live Facebook

[00:18] form, virtually taking over the release from Stern as he revealed in the

[00:22] more and more information daily about art packages pricing, features, gameplay.

[00:27] Sometimes, multiple times a day, while Stern forced into their lane by their delayed

[00:32] release decision, rightly or wrongly sat back and did nothing as just about every single

[00:38] piece of their bond pinball puzzle was unfurled as leak after leak became public, culminating

[00:44] in the final Knator bombshell.

[00:46] But in fact, there would be another 60th anniversary edition of the game which would be

[00:51] unveiled at the British Film Institute tribute to James Bond.

[00:55] But wait, it gets better.

[00:58] Rumor has it that this 60th anniversary machine would be different from the other pro-premium

[01:03] and LE models in every way, showcasing all of the James Bond actors with possibly even

[01:09] the inclusion of Daniel Craig and sold through dealers with no ceiling on the price, much

[01:15] like what they did with the 40th anniversary edition of Noviro.

[01:19] Say what?

[01:20] The game would be a single level only EM inspired game, much like what Stern did with the

[01:26] Beatles.

[01:27] But the most interesting part of this rumor is that this new 60th edition version would

[01:31] be completely redesigned by none other than the top pinball designer in the world, wait

[01:37] for it, Keith Owens.

[01:40] Say what?

[01:41] Welcome everybody to Knators Bimball Podcast.

[02:02] What did I tell you?

[02:03] What did I tell you?

[02:04] Was this not the greatest scoop in the history of pinball scoops?

[02:08] Nobody else was saying it.

[02:10] Nobody was reporting on it.

[02:11] A week and a half ago, what did I tell you?

[02:14] There was going to be a fourth edition of James Bond.

[02:18] Check.

[02:19] It was going to be designed by Keith Owens.

[02:20] Check.

[02:21] It was going to be a single level game.

[02:23] Check.

[02:24] The dealers are going to set the price.

[02:25] Check.

[02:26] I was just off on one, one thing.

[02:28] I was off on it.

[02:29] It wouldn't be limited.

[02:30] It is limited to 500 games, everybody.

[02:33] But you heard it here first on Knators Bimball Podcast.

[02:37] And everybody on Pinside said I was crazy.

[02:40] Everyone on Pinside said I was nuts.

[02:43] John Ellorick has joined the Canadian Club.

[02:46] John over at Jack Bar.

[02:47] He said if he lost this bet, he would join any join today.

[02:51] Everybody, look, this is a victory lap for all Canadian fans.

[02:54] And that's why everyone's going to get to hear this show today because I know that

[02:58] my fans want to hear everyone else out there in the Pimball community that listens to Pimball

[03:04] Podcasts.

[03:05] So they want each and every one of you to hear why this show is so entertaining, why it

[03:10] is so much fun to speculate, and why it is so much fun to try to scoop these companies

[03:15] on their big plans.

[03:17] Right?

[03:18] Nobody else was saying this.

[03:19] This didn't appear on NAPS Arcade.

[03:21] It didn't appear on this weekend Pimball.

[03:23] Well, actually it did.

[03:24] Jeff did put up on this weekend Pimball that I was speculating this.

[03:28] The loser kid Pimball Podcast covered it, Craig Bobby covered it, and Kerry Hardy covered

[03:32] it.

[03:33] I'm not saying this, missing an action, but I just want to say to all my haters on

[03:37] Pinside, how do you like me now?

[03:39] How do you like the six-twippy?

[03:40] Just put the six-twippy right now in the book bag because the world's most humble and

[03:47] the world's worst haircut Pimball Podcaster is just here to say, damn, I feel relieved.

[03:54] I mean it.

[03:55] I feel such relief.

[03:56] Like I was telling Brenda last night, I really can't sleep because I went all in on this

[04:01] rumor.

[04:02] And I went out on a line and then I thought like Keith L. Wins said on a Jack Danger

[04:06] stream that he wasn't doing a James Bond pin, Keith L. Wins himself chimed in and said,

[04:11] show me where I said that.

[04:13] So he didn't even say that.

[04:15] And someone on Pinside basically made that up.

[04:17] So I want to exonerate anyone who's saying that Keith L. Wins lied.

[04:20] Look, it was hard to like go watch three hours of Jack Danger streaming the game.

[04:24] So that's why I think there was some confusion.

[04:27] But let's just say for the record, I think Canadian hit it out of the park with one of

[04:32] the craziest and strangest rumors of all time.

[04:36] And I'm just happy that we finally got the reveal today.

[04:40] I'm happy we finally got to see James Bond in Ellie format.

[04:43] And I'm just happy like the game is now all available.

[04:46] Like all the information is available to us on what James Bond Pimball is going to be.

[04:51] I'm also happy for all of my other Pimball content creators out there.

[04:55] And I'm just pulling their legs.

[04:56] I'm just happy that we all have content to talk about.

[05:00] That's it.

[05:01] But I also do feel somewhat vindicated because I take a lot of arrows in the back.

[05:05] And people make fun of me all the time.

[05:07] And I'm going to say this right now.

[05:08] The reason why my show is entertaining, the reason why it's enjoyable is because we actually

[05:13] want to talk about these rumors.

[05:16] So many people out there will not talk about stuff.

[05:19] Even if they caught wind of this, they would have buried it because they don't want to burn

[05:23] their relationships with Stern.

[05:25] And how do you think Stern felt looking at Canada's Facebook page, right?

[05:28] All throughout the week.

[05:29] And they got to see me put up there.

[05:32] What was going to happen?

[05:33] They're big mystery.

[05:34] They're big surprise was absolutely spoiled by Canada.

[05:38] Do I feel bad?

[05:39] No.

[05:40] The reason I don't feel bad is that loose lips, man.

[05:43] I didn't make this up.

[05:45] They told people this.

[05:46] And those people told me the other reason I do not feel bad at all is Stern Pimball is

[05:52] now charging $13,000 for an LE.

[05:56] This launch has been such a weird week and a half.

[05:59] And I want to say this, I do think the LE looks really good.

[06:02] I'm going to talk about that a little bit.

[06:04] But man, I want to start with the sticker shock.

[06:08] If you ordered this game through Stern Pimball with shipping and with tax, it is like $14,500

[06:18] now for a Stern LE in which they are making 1,000 games.

[06:23] Just think about that for a moment.

[06:26] Just a few years ago, a Stern LE was $7,500.

[06:30] We are seeing right now about an 80% increase in the price of a Stern LE and they are also

[06:38] making twice as many LEs.

[06:40] At some point, and I mean it when I say this, I think we're reaching a ceiling and I think

[06:45] it's just somewhat deflating a little bit that now this is the new par for the course.

[06:50] Jersey Jack wants 12 to 15.

[06:53] Stern is going to now want 13,000 people for every single LE moving forward and we know

[06:58] the number is going to keep going up.

[07:00] It's not going to go down.

[07:02] And then it begs the question, how much is this Keith L. in machine going to be, right?

[07:06] This single level game that has all the James bonds in it and has an LCD screen in the

[07:12] game and has 10 drop targets, there's a lot going on in the game and this is going to

[07:16] be a game that James bond fanatics are going to want and there's only 500.

[07:20] So what's the price going to be there, right?

[07:22] I think they're going to give them to the dealers for 15 and then they're going to set the

[07:25] price and guess what the dealers are going to do.

[07:27] Are they going to set it at 20?

[07:29] No, they're going to set it at like 25 to 30,000 dollars.

[07:33] It's absolutely bonkers for the price of a car now.

[07:37] You can get a single level Stern machine.

[07:39] And I think a lot of people are just feeling like when does it end?

[07:43] When does the insanity end?

[07:45] And I think some people actually blame me.

[07:47] They're like, canada, you've been telling them all these years that they have multi-millionaires

[07:53] who buy these games for these gentlemen.

[07:55] It means nothing to spend 5,000 more, 8,000 more.

[08:00] And I think we're seeing it because here's what's going to happen.

[08:03] Even though I think this price is crazy, I still think we're going to see people flipping

[08:07] these James Bond LEDs for more than $13,000.

[08:12] And you have to look no further than Godzilla's now.

[08:15] All of them.

[08:16] If you want a Godzilla LED opened up, you're now spending $16,000.

[08:21] So this is it.

[08:22] This is the new normal, right?

[08:23] This is absolutely the new normal.

[08:25] And I think for a lot of people, it's not just the LED.

[08:27] Now it's 9,700 for the premium.

[08:30] It's 7,000 for a Stern Pro.

[08:33] And look, I don't think people feel good about this.

[08:35] And the market's going to decide.

[08:37] Whether or not I mone about this or praise this move because now Stern's just going to

[08:41] get richer, it doesn't matter.

[08:43] Ultimately, the market will decide.

[08:45] And we're going to know real soon.

[08:47] We're going to see the first four sale of a James Bond LED.

[08:51] How much is someone going to ask for it?

[08:52] I think you're going to see people asking $16,000 to $18,000 for it.

[08:56] And I think some people will fall victim to the FOMO and jump right in.

[09:00] I would just caution each and every one of you.

[09:03] Just wait a little bit.

[09:05] The worst day to buy an LED is going to be this weekend.

[09:07] Just wait, see where the market's settled.

[09:09] So what do I think about the LED?

[09:11] It looks beautiful.

[09:12] I really do love the Thunderbolt art package.

[09:15] I've always loved the Thunderbolt art package.

[09:17] I like the armor on the machine.

[09:19] I just think the game looks really good.

[09:22] And then I watched the gameplay video and I'm not so sure.

[09:25] I really need to see this game being played by Jack Danger.

[09:29] I want to see how it all comes together.

[09:32] And I think that's going to be a really important part of this game.

[09:36] Like does that rocket?

[09:37] Is it going to get annoying?

[09:38] I know people are saying it looks like a sex toy vibrating.

[09:41] I want to see this stuff.

[09:42] Like what does the underwater battle look like?

[09:44] Is it cool or is it a cheap gimmick?

[09:47] What does it feel like when you get on the jetpack and it's just James Bond on a wand moving

[09:52] over to the tank?

[09:53] I will say when I saw that happen in the gameplay video, it was so underwhelming.

[09:58] For some reason I just thought it would be such a cool thing for that to happen.

[10:02] But then the way he just kind of like poops out the ball and it slowly just hits the tank,

[10:07] it just didn't feel like dramatic.

[10:09] But again, we're watching this happen without music, without call outs, without stuff on

[10:14] the LCD screen.

[10:15] So I really need to see how this whole game ties together.

[10:19] But man, that sticker shock.

[10:20] It still hurts.

[10:21] Like every five minutes I forget that Stern Elis are now 13,000.

[10:25] The other thing about the Ellie that everybody saw today were the inner art blades.

[10:29] And I know these inner art blades were done by a James Bond illustrator.

[10:33] They look a little strange.

[10:34] I'm not going to lie.

[10:35] The whole black and white, like illustration sketches of James Bond in the game like that.

[10:40] It's just a little jarring.

[10:42] It almost looks like a coloring book that just needs to be colored in.

[10:45] And I'm not sure I like them.

[10:47] I need to see it in person, but I just don't like them because now it's not cohesive.

[10:51] Like it's distracting.

[10:53] And I just don't think they look good.

[10:54] I think what would look much better as inner art blades are either decals based on Thunderbird

[11:00] or you have all the movie posters on the inner art decals.

[11:03] I think the second hand market with inner art decals is going to fix the problem.

[11:07] The other thing I don't like, and I'm nitpicking here.

[11:09] The other thing I don't like about this game is the apron for 13,000 dollars Stern.

[11:14] Come on, work on the apron a little bit.

[11:17] You've got all of this source material.

[11:19] You've got all of this James Bond artwork to play with.

[11:22] And you can't make the apron look better than that.

[11:25] I just think it looks really, really bad and lazy.

[11:28] And that's just the only other thing I'm going to gripe on.

[11:31] I love the left side of the cabinet.

[11:32] I love the translate on the Thunderball edition.

[11:35] I'm not crazy about the right side with the movie posters, but it is what it is.

[11:40] But overall, I'm just going to say this overall.

[11:43] This is a very, very, very nice game from Stern.

[11:46] It is one of their nicest Ellie's ever.

[11:49] It is also their second most expensive Ellie ever.

[11:52] And so there's a lot of these out there.

[11:54] Isn't it crazy?

[11:55] Like we mowned and groaned when Batman S.L.E. was 15,000 dollars.

[12:00] And there was only 80 of them.

[12:03] Now we have a 13,000 dollar game that they're making 8,000 of.

[12:07] The whole hobby has jumped the shark James Bond style.

[12:11] Okay.

[12:12] All right, let me take a breath.

[12:13] The other thing I was right about is they are going to show the games at the British

[12:17] Film Institute on September 30th.

[12:19] Now, I thought they were going to wheel out the Keith Ellwyn game there.

[12:24] The thing is, it might not be done yet.

[12:26] So I think we're going to see the Keith Ellwyn game in November, December.

[12:30] That's kind of a smart move by Stern because I think Stern wants to get every Ellie sold

[12:35] and also get every Ellie made before they show the Keith Ellwyn edition.

[12:41] I have already spoken to James Bond fanatics who are getting both.

[12:46] Like it is great.

[12:47] They are getting both.

[12:48] So let's say like the Keith Ellwyn game is like 20 grand, 25, and then the Ellie is 13.

[12:53] These are gentlemen that are just going to get two pinball machines in 2022 and they

[12:58] are going to drop somewhere between 33,000 and like 38,000 dollars for two Sterns, people.

[13:08] Two Sterns.

[13:09] I feel like people forgot when Nick Parks came on this show and said it cost Stern about

[13:14] three to five thousand dollars to make a game.

[13:17] I mean, we've all forgotten this.

[13:19] We've all forgotten.

[13:20] We've all been delusional about what we're doing with our money.

[13:23] But look everybody, this hobby is meant to entertain.

[13:26] It's meant to be fun.

[13:27] If you love James Bond and you realize you only live once and you really want this pin,

[13:31] then go get it.

[13:32] I'm not here to tell you not to buy this game.

[13:34] I do think these prices are kind of crazy.

[13:37] I really do.

[13:38] But this is pinball now.

[13:39] The whole market has changed.

[13:41] And if we go into a recession, this pinball hobby is going to get hit pretty damn hard.

[13:45] The other problem happening in pinball now is this.

[13:48] It's like now that these games are coming out at such a high price, anyone who has an

[13:52] old Stern Ellie, automatically now thinks their games are worth a lot more money.

[13:57] And maybe they are.

[13:58] What's a Ghostbusters Ellieworth if there's only 500?

[14:01] What's a Tron Ellieworth if there's only 400?

[14:04] Right?

[14:05] It's just crazy.

[14:06] Now everyone's going to want 15 to 20,000 dollars for machines that were just a few thousand

[14:10] over Sticker just a few years ago.

[14:12] But I do think these high prices are starting to sort of eat away at the enthusiasm for a

[14:18] lot of people in this hobby.

[14:20] It just is.

[14:21] There's no way around it.

[14:22] But I also do want to applaud Stern for putting more into these games.

[14:26] At these price points, you're going to need to load up games like this.

[14:30] You're not going to be able to sell games like Toy Story.

[14:32] Our expectations are going to be through the roof and they should be because the prices

[14:37] have gone through the roof.

[14:39] But overall, probably one of the most satisfying days of my pinball podcasting career.

[14:44] I am so happy that the rumor that I put out there hit the nail on the head, hit the ball

[14:50] out of the park.

[14:51] And I just have a favor for all my pinball podcasting friends out there.

[14:55] When you talk about this, just remember how to say my name.

[14:59] It's KNADA.

[15:01] All right.

[15:02] KNADA said it.

[15:03] It came true.

[15:04] I love all you guys.

[15:06] I love all my club members.

[15:07] I love all the other pinball content creators.

[15:09] And I'm just feeling great.

[15:10] It's my birthday this weekend.

[15:12] This was the greatest early birthday gift I ever could have got.

[15:16] So you have my biggest scoop become true.

[15:19] And now, hopefully, I'm just going to say this.

[15:21] Jason Napp, I love your site.

[15:22] Jason Napp, you have given every other single pinball content creator credit for when they've

[15:28] called something before it happened.

[15:30] Jason, I'm just asking you politely, please credit KNADA's pinball podcast for saying,

[15:36] this is where it originated and then say everything there is about the game.

[15:40] That's all I'm looking for people because you know me.

[15:42] I'm the sociopathic narcissistic pinball podcaster that just needs everybody's attention.

[15:48] But this is how you get the attention, people.

[15:50] You got to take the shots to score.

[15:52] And I put myself on the line a lot.

[15:54] And I've had a lot more right than wrong.

[15:56] And all my fans know it.

[15:57] And all my haters, I just got to say welcome to KNADA's pinball podcast.

[16:01] And I'm putting this up for everybody to hear because I'm super excited.

[16:05] It's an awesome time to be in the hobby and such a terrible time for all of our wallets.

[16:10] Was that a pinball party or what?

[16:11] Later everybody.
