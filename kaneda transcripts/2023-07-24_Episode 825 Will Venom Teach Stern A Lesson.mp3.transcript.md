[00:00] You come on, come on, love it for the money.

[00:03] Come on, come on, listen to the money talk.

[00:08] Come on, come on, love it for the money.

[00:11] Come on, come on, listen to the money talk.

[00:15] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:19] Oh, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] Canada is on the mend, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:25] I have this thing called like, hand foot mouth disease that Killian gave me.

[00:29] Let me tell you right now, this is the worst thing ever.

[00:31] I would never wish this on my worst enemy.

[00:34] Basically what it does is it gives open sores inside your mouth.

[00:38] Think of canker sores all throughout the side and the back of your mouth.

[00:42] And then your hands get a rash and your feet get a rash.

[00:45] It's horrible.

[00:46] And there's no remedy for it.

[00:47] You just have to wait it out seven to 10 days and it's super contagious.

[00:52] So I've been quarantining in this bedroom thinking about this pinball podcast,

[00:57] but I'm better enough to talk to you right now.

[01:00] All right, so we've got a lot to talk about.

[01:02] I haven't given you my real feelings on Venom.

[01:05] We've seen the stream.

[01:06] We've seen the dead flip stream of the pro and the premium.

[01:09] I've been reading everybody's feedback.

[01:11] We just heard about Harry Potter.

[01:14] We've got rumors about who's making He-Man.

[01:16] We've got rumors about Spooky Pinball's next theme or possible theme.

[01:20] We're going to talk about all of that in less than 40 minutes on this episode of

[01:25] Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:27] So where do we want to start?

[01:28] Let's start with Venom.

[01:29] There's a lot of conversation happening around Venom.

[01:32] And I've been reading everybody's commentary.

[01:35] I've been hearing what people have been saying.

[01:38] And there's a lot of people making some very bold predictions about this game.

[01:42] I think the one that's just wrong, I want to start with this one,

[01:45] that FOMO is dead in pinball.

[01:48] We need to stop thinking that is true because people aren't running to buy Venom at $13,000.

[01:55] Does not mean that FOMO is dead across the entire pinball hobby, everybody.

[02:00] Look what happened to Pulp Fiction.

[02:03] That game sold out in one day and you can't find an LE for less than what they're charging for one.

[02:09] FOMO is not dead.

[02:10] What is dead in pinball is this.

[02:13] People are not going to spend these kinds of prices on a game unless it's a dream theme.

[02:20] Okay?

[02:21] You can go get 2-day, new in box.

[02:23] Think about how much energy and excitement was around Foo Fighters.

[02:27] You can go get new in box from distributors, a Foo Fighters LE 2-day for $13,000.

[02:35] FOMO is not dead if a game like Back to the Future comes out.

[02:39] It's not dead if Top Gun comes out.

[02:41] It's not dead if a Super A theme comes out in pinball.

[02:45] But here's the sad part about the industry over the last few years.

[02:48] Think about it.

[02:49] There hasn't been a Super A theme in a really, really, really long time.

[02:54] You know, the last time we got a AAA theme was what?

[02:57] Like Stranger Things and we saw what happened with Stranger Things at launch.

[03:01] And so I think everyone's waiting for these juggernauts.

[03:04] Look, some bad news for Harry Potter fans.

[03:06] Problem with pinball at these prices is if you don't give people that AAA theme,

[03:12] it really makes people hesitate a lot nowadays that two premiums are $20,000

[03:19] and two LEs are $26,000.

[03:22] People are going to start hitting pause because it's not just pinball that's gone up in price so much.

[03:27] It's everything else out in the world.

[03:30] And I know that each and every one of you has not doubled your income over the last five years,

[03:36] but the cost of a Stern LE is double what it used to be.

[03:40] But I always thought Venom was going to be a sort of B theme.

[03:44] It was never going to be a theme that everybody just threw money at.

[03:47] So I'm not surprised about the reception to the Venom LE prices.

[03:51] I also think people are getting kind of tired of the constant and endless spam from all these distributors.

[03:58] Have you been on Facebook when a new game comes out?

[04:00] It's like you get hit up 18, 19 different ways from all these distributors,

[04:06] letting you know that your life will be complete if you take off their hands,

[04:10] their allotment of Venom, premium pros and LEs.

[04:13] And I think for most of us out there, if you just wait it out,

[04:17] you're going to be able to get those pros, premiums and LEs.

[04:20] Like why would you buy this game now?

[04:23] Why would you buy it before you get a chance to play it?

[04:26] And even though we've seen a stream on the game,

[04:28] I don't think that's enough to make people say,

[04:31] Yup, I'm going to write a check now.

[04:33] And people are saying this, they are being asked to pay in full now

[04:37] for a Venom LE that they're not going to get for two months.

[04:40] Why would you do that?

[04:42] I think people are getting smarter.

[04:43] Because if you hold on to your $13,000 and you just wait two months,

[04:48] in two months, we might see the next game from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:51] In two months, we might see a Twilight Zone or Big Bang Bar released.

[04:56] In two months, something else might happen in the pinball world.

[04:59] And why wouldn't you just keep your options open?

[05:02] And I think that's what we're seeing more and more from people in this hobby.

[05:06] I'm just going to keep my options open.

[05:09] None of these B theme games are ever going to be hard to get.

[05:12] And they're never going to go up in price.

[05:14] I see people saying like they're happy that Stern raised the prices

[05:18] because they took the scalpers out of the market.

[05:20] And let me ask all of you a question right now.

[05:22] Are you happier they remove the scalpers from the market

[05:26] and Stern turned themselves into the scalpers people?

[05:30] You see what they did?

[05:31] Now they're saying that every single LE that comes out is worth $13,000 on day one.

[05:37] That is total hogwash.

[05:39] They've taken all the money that they used to pass on to the customer.

[05:44] So I mean this when I say it for all of you out there who cried about scalping and flipping.

[05:48] Congratulations.

[05:50] You screwed yourselves because everybody else was able to get the game at the right price.

[05:55] And then you went and you cried about you said, hey, look, Stern,

[05:58] see what you can get for these games.

[05:59] And now look what they did.

[06:01] They became the scalpers.

[06:02] They're the ones who are making so much more per game sold.

[06:06] They're laughing all the way to the bank that they're charging us $10,000 for a freaking unlimited premium,

[06:11] 10 grand for an unlimited premium.

[06:15] And there's no going back.

[06:16] This is it.

[06:17] And that's why they don't care that these sales aren't flying off the shelves on day one.

[06:21] They don't care.

[06:22] You know, much more money Stern is making on a $7,000 pro.

[06:26] Did everyone forget that Tron LE was like 5,700 bucks?

[06:31] Stern LE's used to be 6,500.

[06:33] Then they went up to 7,500.

[06:35] Now you're spending 7,000 on a pro and everybody's just like, all right, this is just what it is.

[06:42] It's the way of the world.

[06:43] No, it's not the way of the world.

[06:45] Pimbal has gone up more exponentially than most other things.

[06:48] And it's one of the most unnecessary items.

[06:50] That's the problem.

[06:52] It's not food.

[06:53] It's not booze.

[06:54] It's not stuff you really need to make it through this crazy world.

[06:58] It's a Pimbal machine.

[06:59] And each and every one of you owns a ton of Pimbal machines that are amazing.

[07:03] And you know, you don't need more.

[07:05] And I think that's what's happening with Venom sales.

[07:08] A lot of you are like, the game looks fun and the game does look fun.

[07:11] I saw the streams, the games really fast.

[07:14] Those ball ejects on the sides are kind of interesting.

[07:16] They eject the ball before the ball even makes it there.

[07:19] So the game's actually faster than it could technically be in real life.

[07:23] It does make for a very fast game.

[07:25] I think Stern is trying some really interesting stuff with the code on this game.

[07:29] More like a role-playing game where you could start off where you left off.

[07:33] They haven't done this before.

[07:34] I like that they're trying new things in Pimbal.

[07:37] I do worry a little bit that they're turning Pimbal into video games.

[07:41] And for those of you saying, oh, they're going to hit us with downloadable content.

[07:45] Where have you been, people?

[07:46] They've already hit us with downloadable content.

[07:49] And no, it's not going to be 10 or $5.

[07:51] It's going to be $500.

[07:53] You know what their downloadable content is, people?

[07:56] It's a $1,000 Godzilla topper where they know the topper costs just 500 bucks.

[08:02] And then they're charging you $500 additionally to get the downloadable code.

[08:07] Stern is Trojan horsing so much stuff into this hobby.

[08:11] It makes nobody feel good.

[08:13] And the distributors have to pretend like this is great, like bye-bye-bye.

[08:17] Like this is the best thing to happen.

[08:19] Like put this $1,000 downloadable content topper on top of your game.

[08:23] And your life will be better if you play King of the Monsters mode with Unlimited Continues.

[08:27] You can cheat to see the end of the game.

[08:29] And that makes you feel good because they know you're a rich collector

[08:32] who doesn't play your machines who will never see any of this code.

[08:35] It's just getting a little out of hand.

[08:37] And I want to ask the question right now.

[08:39] Are we learning anything from this launch?

[08:41] Do we think Stern is going to learn anything from this launch?

[08:44] Well, look, I'm very proud of many of you out there.

[08:47] I am. I'm very proud of a lot of you.

[08:49] I've heard more and more people say I'm not buying.

[08:52] I've heard more and more people saying I'm not going in on an LE.

[08:55] I've even heard people like Pin Monk say I've canceled my LE order

[08:59] because I'm not locking up my money with Stern for two months.

[09:02] I'm not going to do it. I'm just going to wait.

[09:04] I think that's the way to go because here's the thing.

[09:07] The only opportunity we're ever going to get to get prices to go back down a little bit,

[09:12] not a lot, but even a little bit.

[09:14] The only power we have is to say no.

[09:18] And if you say no, here's what's going to happen.

[09:20] Distributors are not going to be able to say no.

[09:23] They have to keep buying from Stern to ensure they get their allotments of like LEs and premiums.

[09:29] But the problem now is distributors are starting to stockpile these games

[09:34] and they're not used to this.

[09:36] They're not used to games piling up and they need to sell the current title

[09:40] and sell a lot of them to put in that order for the next game.

[09:45] But what happens when this game doesn't fly off the shelf?

[09:48] What happens when they have six figures of money tied up in the current inventory

[09:53] on toy stories, on Godfathers, on Venoms?

[09:56] Then what happens when a hot title comes out?

[09:58] They've got to move those old titles.

[10:00] And I think we're going to start to see more and more of these pinball distributors

[10:04] put these games on sale.

[10:05] And I think it's really interesting that Stern will not let a distributor

[10:09] advertise list a price below map pricing.

[10:12] But I think that's going to have to change too coming up.

[10:15] My point is this, we all know the hobby got out of hand.

[10:18] We all know that Stern became the ultimate scalper in pinball.

[10:22] We all know that these machines do not really provide $13,000 in enjoyment.

[10:28] If you look in an LA of Venom, you do not see $3,000 extra in value over the premium.

[10:35] So it's like a lose, lose, lose for everybody.

[10:37] I mean it when I say it.

[10:39] I feel like everybody's losing out right now.

[10:42] And I'm really worried to see where all of this goes

[10:44] because my ultimate thing I was thinking about as I think about Stern pinball

[10:48] and what they're doing and the fact that there's all these other pinball companies,

[10:52] I'm worried that what's going to happen to pinball is what happened to Disney.

[10:56] And I know Seth comes from Disney, I believe.

[10:58] I'm worried that this is what's going to happen.

[11:01] They're going to overcharge their customers.

[11:03] That's what Disney did.

[11:05] They charge people way too much money to get into the parks

[11:08] and it turned people off and people started to think twice.

[11:11] The one thing you don't want with an impulse buy like a pinball machine

[11:15] is you don't want these men to think twice about what they're doing.

[11:19] But I think more and more of us are thinking twice.

[11:22] So they're overcharging their customer.

[11:24] Then you make too much content.

[11:27] That's the other big problem Disney did.

[11:29] You make too much content.

[11:31] You bring out too many games at these high prices

[11:35] and then nothing feels really special.

[11:38] People were just getting into Foo Fighters.

[11:41] They were just getting into James Bond

[11:44] and then you hit them with another game.

[11:46] But you're really hitting their wallet and saying,

[11:49] hey, we need another $7,000 to $13,000 from you three months from now.

[11:54] It's not going to work.

[11:55] You see, it used to work when an LE was 7,500 bucks.

[12:00] This three cornerstones a year, it worked

[12:03] because you could buy all three of those LEs every year

[12:07] and make money on them or pass them on without any loss

[12:11] for the same price now of two Stern LEs.

[12:15] So this is going to be the problem that happens in the entire industry.

[12:18] There's just going to be too many games that get released a year.

[12:22] I mean, think about it.

[12:23] James Bond, Foo Fighters, Godfather, Galactic Tank Force, Pulp Fiction, Venom.

[12:28] You've got all of these games.

[12:30] I didn't even talk about people might want a Lebowski.

[12:32] There's all these things going on.

[12:34] They might want a Centaur.

[12:35] They might want this.

[12:36] They might want that.

[12:37] There is too much content happening in the pinball space

[12:40] and there's not enough money to go around

[12:43] and there's not enough space in people's homes to absorb all of these games.

[12:47] So then what happens?

[12:48] These games are still going to be slated for production,

[12:51] but a lot of them are just going to sit

[12:53] and a lot of people are going to want something new

[12:56] when they've already committed their money to something old

[12:59] and then they're going to want to get out of that old commitment.

[13:02] I didn't even talk about the 1969 Scooby-Doo's they have to make.

[13:06] So you've got an industry that's overpriced.

[13:10] You've got an industry that's going to oversaturate itself.

[13:13] That's a recipe for disaster.

[13:15] The prices are too high and the volume is too much.

[13:18] That means demand just evaporates.

[13:21] And the only thing that can survive this, you know this,

[13:23] the only thing that's going to survive this is Keith Elwin Games

[13:27] and AAA themes that are done right.

[13:29] That's it.

[13:30] That's it.

[13:31] You need a AAA theme that's done right or you need Keith Elwin.

[13:35] Everything else.

[13:35] Come on, Eric Minier.

[13:36] You know, when people say Eric's like the savior of Jersey Jack,

[13:39] he's had three games at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[13:42] Two of them have flopped.

[13:43] He's one for three ladies and gentlemen.

[13:46] I mean, look, I love Eric's guns and roses,

[13:48] but there's no denying the fact that when they banked on him,

[13:51] his games have not flown off the shelf.

[13:54] So yeah, he's got to get a AAA theme going.

[13:57] Is Elton John going to be the answer?

[13:58] I don't think so.

[13:59] There is no way based on the vibe that Elton John is going to have

[14:03] the same response that Foo Fighters did.

[14:05] So that's where we are right now.

[14:07] And I think this hobby is in need and dire need of a course

[14:11] correction.

[14:12] And I really do applaud each and every one of you that has

[14:15] listened to Canada and you are waiting and seeing and you're

[14:18] not running at every one of these B themes.

[14:21] All right, speaking of not a B theme, we heard today that

[14:24] Harry Potter is not going to happen or at least it's not

[14:27] going to happen the way you want it to happen.

[14:29] We heard from Napsarcade that Joe Kamnacow was ready to spend

[14:32] four million dollars on the Harry Potter license.

[14:35] Now the previous record for most for a license was Beatles

[14:38] at like a million.

[14:39] The rumor is that Willy Wonka cost Jersey Jack 1.2 million.

[14:43] So he had four million dollars on the table and they said no.

[14:48] And then we're hearing now this is crazy that to get all of

[14:51] the assets that you'd want for Harry Potter would be 10 million

[14:55] dollars.

[14:55] So it's not happening.

[14:57] If it does happen, it's going to be some Hogwarts fantasy

[15:00] adventure game that's based on the properties from Harry

[15:03] Potter, but nothing from the movie or the characters that you

[15:06] love.

[15:07] That's not going to work.

[15:09] And gosh, if Jersey Jack pinball makes that pinball

[15:12] machine, just stick a fork in them.

[15:14] All right, so all that energy we spent on Harry Potter not

[15:17] happening.

[15:18] Let's talk about what's happening.

[15:19] He-Man is happening.

[15:20] I know for a fact that He-Man is coming out in the pinball

[15:24] world.

[15:24] The question is who is making it?

[15:26] Now look, I have a nice friendly bet with Jason Knapp.

[15:29] We bet $500 on who's going to make He-Man.

[15:33] He says it's going to be American pinball.

[15:35] I said it's going to be John Borg and Stern pinball.

[15:38] The bet favors him right now.

[15:39] I'll tell you why.

[15:40] And the bet is for $500 and whoever loses will donate $500

[15:45] to Project Pinball.

[15:46] Now here's why I think Jason Knapp might have the advantage

[15:50] on this bet is that Joe Balser was working on He-Man after

[15:55] he did Hot Wheels.

[15:56] I know this for a fact that American pinball had the He-Man

[16:00] license back then.

[16:01] I heard that they lost the license and that is why I think

[16:05] they might have lost the He-Man license to Stern pinball.

[16:08] And my sources tell me John Borg is actually making He-Man

[16:12] pinball for Stern pinball.

[16:14] Now look, if I were to ask each and every one of you right

[16:16] now, who would you rather make He-Man?

[16:19] American pinball or John Borg and Stern?

[16:23] Obviously, we're all hoping it is Stern pinball, but that is

[16:27] the bet.

[16:27] And I think this is going to happen sometime next year.

[16:30] We will see a He-Man pinball machine.

[16:33] If it is American pinball, is it going to be Ryan McQuade's

[16:36] game?

[16:37] I keep hearing that Ryan McQuade's game is based on an old

[16:40] video game or arcade game that was also a comic or something

[16:44] like that or had an animated series.

[16:47] And so that might be He-Man, but I want to take a wild guess

[16:51] and Canada is one to take wild guess in the world of pinball

[16:55] podcasting.

[16:55] Here's my guess because there was an old Sega game that was

[16:59] actually based on He-Man, but wasn't actually He-Man.

[17:04] It was like their version of He-Man.

[17:06] And if you know Ryan McQuade, he loves Sega.

[17:10] He loves Sonic the Hedgehog.

[17:12] So, Canada's pinball podcast is going to go out on a limb and

[17:17] predict that Ryan McQuade's game at American pinball is no

[17:22] other than the arcade and Sega Genesis classic Altered Beast

[17:28] because Altered Beast is based on He-Man.

[17:31] So that is my guess that Ryan McQuade is making Altered Beast

[17:35] pinball.

[17:36] Does anybody want it?

[17:38] I don't know.

[17:38] I don't think so.

[17:39] What is going on over there at American pinball?

[17:42] But before we get to Galactic Tank Force, let's talk about

[17:44] spooky pinball.

[17:45] So I broke the rumor via visual imagery that spooky pinball

[17:50] has the license to make the Looney Tunes pinball machine.

[17:54] And I've heard this from one of my best sources.

[17:56] So I think this is going to happen.

[17:58] Now people are saying,

[17:59] Canada, wait, you said it was going to be Princess Bride.

[18:02] And now you're saying Looney Tunes.

[18:04] Well, I'm here to tell you what if they're doing both?

[18:07] I absolutely believe that spooky pinball has more than one

[18:11] license secured.

[18:12] So I think when they move into their next bigger factory,

[18:16] you're going to see two spooky games a year.

[18:19] And I really do think it could be Looney Tunes and it could

[18:22] be the Princess Bride.

[18:23] And out of those two, I'd rather have the Princess Bride.

[18:26] I think as grown adults, it's really hard for us.

[18:30] I know we grew up with all of these cartoons and comics.

[18:34] It doesn't mean we want them all in modern form in pinball.

[18:38] Would Looney Tunes make for a good pinball experience?

[18:41] I could see it.

[18:42] I could definitely see it, but it doesn't mean I want it.

[18:46] And I would hate to make Looney Tunes because then I think

[18:49] if it fails, everyone's going to point at your company and say

[18:53] that's all folks.

[18:55] So I would be really nervous about Bugs Bunny and Tasmanian

[18:58] Devil and Wild E. Coyote and Daffy Duck.

[19:01] And I don't know if you'd get all of those properties because

[19:04] I think some of those properties have been licensed by other

[19:06] people, but I don't know, man.

[19:08] I think spooky pinball.

[19:10] I think you have to look at the target audience of pinball

[19:13] and 40 to 60 year old man and really ask yourselves Looney

[19:17] Tunes like really?

[19:18] Are we doing this?

[19:20] Shouldn't we try to go after something more adult, even

[19:23] stuff from the 80s and 90s stuff that has a more mature theme?

[19:27] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[19:29] So we covered off on Stern.

[19:31] We know Jersey Jack Godfather.

[19:33] The CEs are finally making their way to customers and

[19:36] they're beautiful machines.

[19:38] I'm not going to take anything away from those machines.

[19:40] They look absolutely gorgeous for $15,000.

[19:44] They should now it's going to get really interesting to see

[19:48] what happens as all of these men cough over 15 K and they

[19:52] start to play the Godfather.

[19:54] We're going to see how long this game lasts in people's

[19:57] collections.

[19:58] We're going to see how long until people start to sell them.

[20:02] And then we're going to see if the game starts to become a

[20:04] falling knife like Godfather.

[20:06] Ellie is I still deep down do not think Jersey Jack is going

[20:10] to make 1000 Godfather CEs.

[20:13] I don't think they allotted all of them.

[20:15] I don't think they made 1000 Toy Story CEs.

[20:18] I don't think so.

[20:19] You just don't see them in collections enough to say a

[20:22] thousand of them went out there.

[20:24] But the truth is this that ship is sale.

[20:26] There's nothing they're going to do to get people excited

[20:29] again in the Godfather.

[20:31] It doesn't matter.

[20:32] I think a lot of you out there who are curious about the

[20:35] game you'll pick up an le for 10 you'll pick up a C for 12

[20:40] if you want it in just a few months.

[20:42] We know this game is headed south.

[20:44] Nothing is going to make it turn around again.

[20:47] It's not going to turn into the next pirate to the Caribbean.

[20:50] It's just not and Jersey Jack really is at the lowest it's

[20:53] ever been.

[20:54] They need something next that's going to blow people away

[20:57] and we all know the story.

[20:59] I'm not going to beat the dead horse but for a company that

[21:01] makes one game every 18 months we expect more and I think Jack

[21:06] when Ari has led this company astray with two terrible theme

[21:10] selections in a row and they need to climb out of the gutter

[21:13] and if it's Elton John I'm really worried.

[21:16] I am really worried and I think we're going to see Elton John

[21:18] this year and man it's almost August like the year is going

[21:22] to go pretty quickly into fall winter and I'm just going to

[21:25] wait to see what this company does.

[21:26] I hope they blow us away but I've been nothing but disappointed

[21:30] for the last three years from Jersey Jack pinball and in

[21:34] those three years Jersey Jack pinball the one game people

[21:37] actually bought you've refused to finish the code on guns and

[21:41] roses.

[21:41] I think it's embarrassing.

[21:43] I think you should be ashamed of yourselves and get the code

[21:46] done at least give the people that bought the game like GNR

[21:49] a final version of the game after three years.

[21:52] There's no excuses.

[21:54] All right.

[21:54] Canada remains public enemy number one to the executives

[21:57] over at Jersey Jack pinball.

[21:59] Let's talk galactic tank force.

[22:01] So these things are just trickling out.

[22:03] People are saying good stuff.

[22:05] I mean the vibe on GTF has always been the same.

[22:07] It's fun to shoot but man it doesn't really make you want

[22:10] to buy one and this whole like tank target solution.

[22:14] I'm still seeing people in the thread make their own solutions

[22:18] to the problem.

[22:19] So clearly the American pinball solution isn't going to be a

[22:23] long term fix.

[22:25] So that is really hampered this game galactic tank force is

[22:29] going to go down as what happens when you launch a game

[22:32] all wrong.

[22:33] This game will never recover from its poor launch.

[22:37] They turned everybody off during the launch of the game

[22:40] and it just goes to show you if you don't think marketing is

[22:43] valuable.

[22:44] Look what happened when straight down the middle did a 20

[22:47] minute video on Pulp Fiction.

[22:49] Look at the response to that game.

[22:51] Look at what happened when David Fix didn't give straight

[22:54] down the middle of the game to do a vignette on and they

[22:57] instead gave it to one of their fanboys who made their own

[23:00] video and look at how it tanked the sales of the game especially

[23:05] with a unique quirky game like this.

[23:08] They really needed to launch it the right way and even now

[23:11] right even now where is Dennis Nordman.

[23:14] I mean this is the weirdest thing about this game.

[23:16] It seems like the game's designer wants nothing to do with

[23:20] marketing the game.

[23:22] He wants nothing to do with getting you excited about the

[23:25] game.

[23:25] And when I see that when I see a game's creator is staying as

[23:29] far away from the project as possible.

[23:32] That is the ultimate red flag that I don't want one if he

[23:36] doesn't want to promote the game and he doesn't want to get

[23:38] people excited about the game then why should I get excited

[23:41] about the game.

[23:42] If I designed a game I would be in front of it every single

[23:46] week getting you excited about buying the thing I created.

[23:50] Look how Jack danger is in front of food fighters all the

[23:52] time.

[23:53] Look how Jack danger is helping Brian Eddie who streamed

[23:56] venom for everybody.

[23:56] It was Brian Eddie the game's designer and thank the pinball

[24:00] gods they kept Dwight away from that stream because Dwight

[24:03] would have turned everybody off with his explanation of the

[24:06] code.

[24:07] But man it's like that's just it and where's David fix spin

[24:10] you know it opens up the door for an interesting question

[24:12] is like for some of these pinball companies the fact that

[24:15] they don't do any like social media they don't make any

[24:18] content they're not talking to anybody where's David fix

[24:21] where's Jersey Jack pinball on social where's Ken Cromwell

[24:25] where's Damon and Marty for Haggis pinball it's like you

[24:28] have a company and every week you could just connect with

[24:32] the community every week that you connect with new people

[24:35] you are opening the door for potential new buyers and they

[24:38] don't do anything.

[24:39] You know I didn't talk about Haggis but it is what it is

[24:42] like they're not going to sell out of the centaur edition

[24:44] of the game for anyone who ordered this game good luck.

[24:48] I hope you get yours but I'm really not going to waste much

[24:50] airtime on Haggis anymore.

[24:52] You know somebody sent me like this statement from someone

[24:55] who used to work with Damien and it was all this stuff about

[24:58] how he wasn't paid and everybody was promised games and this

[25:02] and that and this and that I'm just here to tell you if you've

[25:05] worked for Haggis pinball and you have a story to tell don't

[25:08] hide behind your NDA tell it yourself don't come to Canada

[25:13] and make me have to tell your story.

[25:15] Let me tell you something people if you work for a pinball

[25:17] company and you're not paid your NDA is invalid it will never

[25:22] hold up in court and your non-disclosure agreement has to

[25:26] do with the trade secrets of the company but if they don't pay

[25:30] you that's not a trade secret you're allowed to go out to

[25:34] people and say hey I worked here for eight months and I wasn't

[25:37] paid no NDA would protect that but I'm tired I'm not doing it

[25:41] again I did it with highway pinball and everybody yelled at

[25:44] me we're just going to have to see the way this movie ends

[25:47] I'm not doing it again.

[25:48] Oh man there we are.

[25:50] Canade is pinball podcast back with a sore throat everybody

[25:54] thank you for being a member of the canada club a lot is going

[25:57] to happen in this pinball space over the next few months I

[26:00] just want to say that I'm very proud to see a lot of you

[26:03] following my advice I think a lot of you are waiting you're

[26:07] not rushing in only fools are rushing in to buy these games

[26:10] right away everyone's realizing I got a great collection

[26:15] remember your job is to bring yourself pinball joy it's not

[26:19] to bail these distributors out of their allotments I can see

[26:23] the desperation man these distributors right now are funny

[26:26] they're like sold out then like an hour later we got a few

[26:29] more come on you're not sold out let's just be honest you're

[26:33] not going to sell out of a thousand venom alleys at $13,000

[26:39] it's not happening all right and it's not going to make anyone

[26:43] feel better to get one now the games are not even going on

[26:46] the line for two freaking months it's a whole new world now

[26:50] people and we haven't had prices this high and when people

[26:53] say like well there wasn't this anger about food fighters at

[26:56] 13 but the real anger is going to be this people have never in

[27:00] the history of pinball bought two stern alleys and had to spend

[27:04] $26,000 you can't keep it at this this gravy train is going

[27:09] to end they killed the Golden Goose and we're just at the

[27:12] middle of witnessing that Golden Goose in the sky plummeting

[27:15] to the ground and it's not there yet but it's going to happen

[27:18] yes sure there's going to be a Keith Elwin game every year or

[27:21] so but that's not enough to sustain these prices every single

[27:26] launch people canade out thank you for being a member of the

[27:29] club
