[00:00] On this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, we're going to talk about

[00:03] pinball saturation and the sheer number of games that are available

[00:09] in the pinball marketplace, but I want to start out this podcast a little differently

[00:14] because I want to beg.

[00:16] Begg all of you manufacturers out there will somebody please

[00:21] make this movie into a pinball game?

[00:26] First prime, then ultra madness, and now you, it's pity you on a boss die so easily

[00:37] where I might have a sense of satisfaction now.

[00:41] You got the touch!

[00:45] You got the noise, not a mispron.

[00:52] Optimus.

[00:53] I mean, it would not get any sweeter for a pinball machine based on the G1 Transformers

[01:12] movie and I just saw it last Thursday.

[01:16] Fatma Vents re-screened it in theaters digitally remastered and I have to say, I have to say,

[01:22] if we look at the themes that most of us want, it is some of the throwback themes from

[01:28] the 80s, maybe early 90s, probably 80s though is the sweet spot, right?

[01:33] Look how good Ghostbusters sold, look how good the Star Wars trilogy sold.

[01:37] I know Star Wars was mid 70s on, but if you go watch Transformers G1 and you go watch

[01:43] that movie, not only do you have the best soundtrack ever, and not a super expensive soundtrack

[01:50] to license.

[01:51] It is much cheaper than Iron Maiden music and Erosmith music that is found in the Transformer

[01:57] movie.

[01:58] But you have the most iconic characters.

[02:01] You have one of the greatest storylines ever.

[02:04] We need to become allies now to defeat Unicron.

[02:09] It would just be so amazing.

[02:13] As I look at all the pinball machines that are out in the world and I look at all the

[02:17] themes and I look at all the things that are coming out and I look at all the titles

[02:22] and I look at how much money all of you are spending on pinball machines.

[02:26] You know, I look at Frolic with his thumbs up as he gets his Deadpool LE.

[02:31] He's probably never even read a single Deadpool comic book, right?

[02:35] I look at the way the hobby is going and it's simply like people will buy whatever is

[02:42] available because there's not always a lot new in box that is available to buy today.

[02:49] But actually that's not true.

[02:52] When I want to talk about on episode 265 a couple things, I want to go down the pinball

[02:58] marketplace and just ask a very simple question.

[03:01] Do you think the pinball hobby is oversaturated now with titles?

[03:06] And are they the titles that you would like to buy?

[03:10] Okay, then we'll go through some pinball news and then I might just go off on a few

[03:15] tangents here and there and then I'm not going to interview Roger Sharp again because you

[03:20] can go listen to that on head to head pinball.

[03:22] I told Ryan I was like, eventually you guys will interview everyone that I've interviewed

[03:27] on this show and you'll realize that there's just not a lot of new news to get out of

[03:31] people.

[03:32] But I do give them credit for doing an interview a week.

[03:36] If probably notice that we haven't had many interviews on this show in a long time and

[03:41] it's not really because people won't come on the show.

[03:45] I just haven't really had the time to line up schedules with other people and also I have

[03:52] to be honest when I'm not interviewing people in the industry and I'm interviewing just like

[03:56] collectors or people out there, I don't know what I'm going to get right because I haven't

[04:00] talked to them yet.

[04:01] But I want to get some of you collectors and you fans out there on this show that's going

[04:05] to happen.

[04:06] Clearly I'm going to reach a point where I can't even conjure up stuff to talk about.

[04:12] But let's get back to the first question.

[04:14] Do you know how many games are available to buy today?

[04:20] If you wanted to go buy a game that is new in box that is being produced right now October

[04:28] 1st, 2018.

[04:32] How many games do you think are available?

[04:34] Do you think it's five?

[04:35] Do you think it's ten?

[04:37] How many?

[04:38] You know, I actually had to go down and count because the answer is quite shocking.

[04:43] So today if you want to go get a game that is currently being manufactured in box brand

[04:50] new, there are twenty one pinball machines for you to choose from.

[04:56] I'm going to go down the list really quickly.

[04:59] There it is.

[05:00] The Caribbean, Wizard of Oz, Dildin, The Hobbit, Iron Maiden, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy,

[05:08] Star Wars, Aerosmith, Batman 66, Ghostbusters, ACDC, Star Trek, Metallica, Thunderbirds, Houdini,

[05:18] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, Total Nuclear Nihilation, Attack from Mars Remake, P3

[05:24] Multi-Morphic, and The Mafia.

[05:27] Twenty one games that you could probably go buy, new in box right now.

[05:34] Incredible, right?

[05:36] Incredible.

[05:37] Are we saturated yet?

[05:38] Now there are more games coming soon.

[05:42] The Monsters, Beatles, October Fest, Monster Bash Remake, Queen.

[05:48] I counted three titles coming from Deep Root, Kingpin, Willy Wonka, Elvira 3.

[05:55] So that's thirty two pinball machines right there.

[06:00] And it's incredible.

[06:02] It is incredible when you just think about the sheer number of games that are going to

[06:06] be available for consumers to choose from.

[06:10] And hey, as a buyer, as a pinball buyer, this is a great time to be in because you have

[06:17] nothing but options.

[06:19] But as I said, as I said at the beginning of this show, do any of these games, do any

[06:24] of these games stir your soul the way you want a game to stir your soul, a game that

[06:32] is going to be somewhere between seven and nine thousand dollars, a game that you have

[06:37] to have.

[06:38] Because when I read the threads, when I read how excited people are for these themes,

[06:44] they're really in those first twenty one, right?

[06:47] The games are out now.

[06:49] I would say the themes that really sort of people had to have were Star Wars, which ended

[06:56] up being a flop of a game.

[06:58] All right.

[06:59] No one's really talking about how great Star Wars is as a machine.

[07:02] I would say Ghostbusters was the other one.

[07:06] Huge enthusiasm for that game.

[07:08] We all know what ended up with Ghostbusters, probably one of the worst designs ever.

[07:13] And then from there, right?

[07:15] From that point on, you know, there's nothing really from Jersey Jack in terms of theme

[07:21] that really, really got people going.

[07:24] And then when it comes to Stern, you know, we just, they had the two themes that I think

[07:28] broke through, but you know, also credit where credits do Metallica and ACDC have done great

[07:33] for them.

[07:35] But you know, what's missing?

[07:37] And that's why I play Transformers G1.

[07:39] All these titles.

[07:41] All these themes.

[07:43] They continue, when you look at the themes, they continue, I think, to miss the mark,

[07:49] which means I think we have a lot more quantity of pinball games coming out and that are

[07:55] currently out.

[07:56] Then we do the kinds of themes people would just love to have.

[08:01] And we talk about theme a lot.

[08:03] But this is more about saturation.

[08:05] And I do think that the pinball market, as much as I want to say, it's oversaturated.

[08:11] And you can't really look at all these titles and say, you know, it's definitely at the

[08:16] point where there's no more buyers.

[08:18] People are out of money or out of room.

[08:20] And I don't think that's the case.

[08:22] I keep seeing people open up Deadpool Elise every day.

[08:27] I keep seeing people saying they're in on Pire to the Caribbean.

[08:30] I keep hearing people say they've ordered Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[08:35] So the buyer base of pinball is definitely growing.

[08:39] I think it's growing both from an operator standpoint and a home collector standpoint.

[08:46] And that's good.

[08:48] There has to be a large number of demand for these many titles to be produced and manufactured.

[08:58] Now, again, the question becomes out of all these themes.

[09:02] Are these really the themes that you are dying to get?

[09:05] I'm really curious to see what happens with the monsters because I think the monsters

[09:10] is a very, very, very niche theme.

[09:14] It's a very niche theme.

[09:16] It is something that I think a lot of us, I'm 42 years old as of last week.

[09:21] I think I grew up watching the monsters reruns because the show isn't black and white.

[09:27] I think the show is from the 70s, correct?

[09:30] I don't exactly know.

[09:31] I just remember watching it.

[09:33] I thought it was funny, it was campy.

[09:36] But I don't know if the monsters really has a lot of following in 2018.

[09:43] And I also say that because do they even show the monsters anywhere?

[09:48] Like are the seasons available on Netflix or Hulu or Amazon or people watching it on TV

[09:55] or any of the old classic TV stations airing a monster's episodes?

[09:59] It's just not a theme that people have been clamoring for for a pinball game.

[10:06] Part of me feels like this is another one of the titles that Stern Pinball took away from

[10:13] Spooky.

[10:14] I do think Spooky wanted to make this game and I think this was another one of the cockblocking

[10:21] efforts that Stern did to keep Chuck from making the Spooky theme games that he wanted to

[10:27] make.

[10:28] I think they got monsters from them unless someone wants to come on and say otherwise.

[10:34] So look, we have, you know, it's just there's just a lot of games coming out.

[10:41] We know Beatles is coming out.

[10:43] I'm also curious to see how the Beatles is going to do.

[10:46] The Beatles is going to be a re-skin of an older Stern machine.

[10:51] And I think people are going to, this game is going to be designed for the collector.

[10:56] So they're going to make, I believe, a super-eally of the Beatles.

[11:01] The way the Beatles will be is here's how it's going to roll out.

[11:04] There's going to be three different variations of the Beatles.

[11:08] So I think you're going to see a Beatles premium, a Beatles limited edition, and a Beatles

[11:14] super limited edition.

[11:17] And it's going to be very much like Batman.

[11:19] Three different art packages will be the differentiator in the game.

[11:25] The game itself will all be the same on all three models.

[11:28] So once again, Stern is going to ask you to invest heavily in artwork.

[11:34] You are going to pay a premium and get no different of a gameplay experience in Beatles.

[11:40] But I also think, you know, you have to be a diehard Beatles fan.

[11:44] See, I, again, I'm 42.

[11:46] I did not grow up in love with the Beatles.

[11:49] I think for someone like me to be in love with the Beatles, I think it requires one

[11:55] thing.

[11:56] I think it requires that your parents were huge Beatles fans when they raised you and they

[12:01] raised you to love that music.

[12:03] It's like today.

[12:05] The reason why I'm, you know, millennial kids are still into like guns and roses and

[12:09] Nirvana, you know, and Pearl Jam.

[12:12] Like young kids, you see them walking around with those t-shirts on is because their parents

[12:16] listened to that music and when they were young and when they raised their kids, they

[12:22] raised them to be into the bands they were into.

[12:25] So Beatles is going to be interesting.

[12:27] I'm not sure it's going to have the frenzy that I think some people think.

[12:33] Monster Bash remake.

[12:34] We'll talk a little bit later about that delay.

[12:37] Queen from, you know, the Pimball people that left highway, I don't know where that game

[12:43] is.

[12:44] Kingpin, Willy Wonka, Elvira 3.

[12:46] All right.

[12:47] So look.

[12:48] And then the last game on my list, number 33 in the mix of games.

[12:52] Is the mystery game that I've been alluding to a few months ago.

[12:57] And I've, and this game, I'll tell you, out of all these games, out of all these games

[13:00] that are coming out, this game is the only game that is being made from the ground up for

[13:08] the collector, for the guy who wants to own something that not everybody has.

[13:15] And you know, I continue to remain optimistic and enthusiastic around this title.

[13:24] And I keep getting hit up by our friend over at this weekend, Pimball.

[13:29] And Jeff keeps wanting to know more about this game.

[13:32] He knows absolutely nothing about this game.

[13:35] And it's kind of killing him.

[13:37] And he keeps telling me to like, forget about it, move on.

[13:40] No, Jeff, the whole thing is this.

[13:43] And for those of you who listen.

[13:45] They're going to make a small number of these games.

[13:48] And there, this game is not going to be revealed at expo.

[13:52] It's not going to be revealed at T.P.F.

[13:54] It's not going to do the normal stuff that all these games have to do to drum up interest

[13:59] and excitement because he doesn't need to make that many.

[14:02] And he doesn't need to make that many to sell them.

[14:06] And I'll tell you this right now, these games, if they come to fruition, okay, because

[14:10] I've seen stuff on it.

[14:12] We're going to sell out to listeners of this show before anyone even sees a thing.

[14:19] Okay, and that's what's going to happen.

[14:21] And then people are going to be like, well, maybe I should have listened to Canada's

[14:23] Pimball podcast because the details of how to get one are going to take place on this

[14:30] show.

[14:31] And they're going to take place exclusively on this show.

[14:35] And when orders open up for the game, the listeners who listen to the podcast first

[14:43] are going to be the ones who get in on it.

[14:46] Okay, and that's just going to be the way it works.

[14:49] Okay.

[14:50] And I'm excited.

[14:52] And I don't know when that date is.

[14:54] And here's the thing, it doesn't matter when that date is.

[14:57] And I've been talking to the creator.

[14:59] And the whole reason it doesn't matter is when you make something that's this special

[15:05] and this limited, it doesn't matter.

[15:08] Like we don't, you know, we don't need the time it to some movie.

[15:12] We don't need the time it to Halloween.

[15:14] It just doesn't matter.

[15:16] And if your interest is peaked in this game, it should be.

[15:20] I mean, I would be really curious about something that I didn't know anything about.

[15:23] That's Pimball that's really trying to give something special to collectors.

[15:28] But again, with all Pimball machines, I don't know when.

[15:31] I don't know if.

[15:34] And from what I've seen, I'm really excited.

[15:37] I haven't seen it all.

[15:38] I haven't seen like the whole thing like flipping and doing all of its crazy stuff.

[15:44] But I, you know, I like being excited by Pimball machines that aren't the expected, right?

[15:50] That aren't what you, you know, are you really, do you really think you're going to get

[15:54] something unexpected and magical from Stern on the Monsters?

[15:57] Do you really think that?

[15:58] You think this is going to be the one where like they completely like blow you away?

[16:04] I still think you're going to get a good game for sure.

[16:07] But the problem with all these games that I've said it before, who the hell wants to

[16:11] spend all this money and get something as a collectible that everybody has?

[16:17] And again, I think nobody is catering to the collector market.

[16:21] And this whole concept of the only thing you can give a collector is trim and art is

[16:29] bullshit.

[16:30] Like let me ask you guys a question.

[16:32] Where are the exclusive call outs for the Batman 66 super Ellie owners?

[16:41] People have shown in the thread in the code itself.

[16:45] There are names.

[16:47] I don't think it was 80 because some of the owners had the same names.

[16:51] I think it was like 60 something names that Adam West called out personally so that if

[16:58] you bought a $15,000 Batman super Ellie, your game would be unique to you because Adam

[17:06] West would call your name out and tell you to answer the bad phone.

[17:11] That was promised to the super Ellie buyers two years ago and they still have not put

[17:18] it in the game.

[17:20] And it's really a shame that that was going to be the cherry on top of the cake.

[17:27] And now when I talk to Lyman, he was like, well, I don't know who's got what game.

[17:33] But of course you do.

[17:35] You know who you sold each game to.

[17:38] It doesn't matter where those games went to after the original buyer.

[17:44] Each game is serial numbered.

[17:46] You could, you will have to probably release to those 80 people.

[17:52] A code just for them.

[17:54] But let me tell Stern something and I know they listen to this show.

[17:58] Those people spent $15,000 on your game.

[18:05] You can't mail out 80 USB drives with each person's individual code on it and allow

[18:14] them to install it into the game.

[18:17] Now I think they might have to wait to the final code update to do that, right?

[18:23] Because if they give it to the person early and then there's new code changes, won't

[18:29] that erase that person's personalized call out?

[18:35] And they probably don't want to have to send out 80 different USB sticks every time there's

[18:41] a code update.

[18:42] So that's my hunch.

[18:43] But you know what I don't like about Stern when it comes to this whole thing?

[18:48] Why don't they just communicate to the people who spent all that money, what their plans

[18:54] are for that?

[18:56] I mean people have already waited two years, two years to get the game complete and it's

[19:02] still not.

[19:03] And yet Stern still won't officially tell people when they can expect their personalized

[19:08] call out, which was one of the reasons people bought the games.

[19:11] And I don't like that, that bait and switch.

[19:15] I'm going to tell you something that's in a game.

[19:17] I'm going to take your money and then I'm not going to deliver it.

[19:20] Now they may, I think they will deliver it.

[19:22] I just don't understand why they can't communicate it.

[19:25] Okay, so my point is this.

[19:28] My final point on all of this is there's just a ton of games out.

[19:32] There's a ton of themes out there.

[19:34] It's a great time to be a buyer.

[19:37] But personally, deep down inside, I just don't think that most of these themes are the

[19:43] themes that I would like to see in pinball machines, the kinds of themes like Transformers

[19:49] Generation One, like he-man, like big trouble in little China.

[19:56] You know, let me go to this week in pinball because I know that Jeff did a little survey

[20:00] and I want to read the results of this survey where he asked people what themes they would

[20:06] like to see and he based it on different age groups.

[20:08] And it's pretty interesting.

[20:09] Let me go to that right now.

[20:11] All right, so it's the this week in pinball is top 10.

[20:14] And so he asked people, what are your top 10 favorite pinball machines based on

[20:19] age?

[20:20] And he says as voted on by the pinball community.

[20:23] So for 35 or younger, these are the top 10 themes they consider.

[20:28] Theater of Magic, the Hobbit, and this is going from 10 to 1.

[20:31] Circus Voltaire, Monster Bash, Pirate to the Caribbean.

[20:36] Really, really.

[20:37] I mean, this is where I love the way like these guys, like they should- I mean, look,

[20:41] it's a survey.

[20:42] Number five, Metallica.

[20:43] Number four, Indiana Jones.

[20:45] Number three, Medieval madness.

[20:47] Number two, Attack from Mars.

[20:48] Number one, in terms of 35 or younger, favorite pinball theme, the Lord of the Rings.

[20:55] All right, 36 to 45, all right, which was 41% of voters.

[21:01] The top 10 are Twilight Zone, Metallica, Lord of the Rings, Iron Maiden, Ghostbusters,

[21:07] ACDC, Adams Family, Dialed in.

[21:11] Attack from Mars and Medieval madness.

[21:13] So you're telling me that dialed in is one of the top 10 favorite pinball themes.

[21:19] Or I guess it's pinball games.

[21:22] It's not even theme.

[21:23] Okay, I get that.

[21:24] Dialed in is a great shooter, all right.

[21:26] So then we go to 46 are older.

[21:30] These are pinball games.

[21:31] They're top 10.

[21:32] Star Trek, Dialed in, Circus Voltaire, the Adams Family, ACDC, Batman 66, Indiana Jones,

[21:38] Attack from Mars, Twilight Zone, and Monster Bash.

[21:42] All right.

[21:43] So those were like your favorite pinball games.

[21:45] And I think there's nothing shocking on that list.

[21:48] I think that we see a lot of repetition in games like Monster Bash, Theater of Magic,

[21:54] Circus Voltaire, Attack from Mars, Lord of the Rings, ACDC, Metallica.

[22:00] There's like this group, there's like this elite group of games.

[22:03] I am surprised to see Ghostbusters in there.

[22:07] But I think because the power of that theme is so strong.

[22:10] You know what you're not seeing in here anywhere?

[22:12] It's Star Wars, which is a shame.

[22:15] You're not seeing the Hobbit other than once on terms of number nine, but it didn't get

[22:21] repeated.

[22:23] Did we see Wizard of Oz?

[22:25] I don't even think so.

[22:26] All right.

[22:27] So let's go on to the top 10 dream pinball themes based on age.

[22:34] All right.

[22:35] So these are themes that people would love to see.

[22:37] So if you are 35 or younger, these are your top 10 themes.

[22:42] Number 10, Pokemon.

[22:44] I mean, that must have been Hilton voting on that one.

[22:47] Number nine, Masters of the Universe.

[22:49] Yes, he man would be amazing.

[22:51] Number eight, Stranger Things.

[22:53] Will Spooky Pinball makes Stranger Things.

[22:56] Number seven, Sonic the Hedgehog.

[22:59] I do think iconic video game stuff like Sonic and Super Mario Brothers would be amazing

[23:05] pinball.

[23:06] Number six, Rick and Morty.

[23:08] Number five, The Beatles.

[23:12] See, I don't, how is that possible?

[23:15] How did people 35 or younger vote for The Beatles?

[23:18] I would expect that to be older.

[23:21] Number four, The Goonies.

[23:25] Number three, and we hear this one a lot, back to the future.

[23:28] Number two, Big Trouble in Little China, which is great.

[23:33] Happy you guys.

[23:34] I'm surprised that that was 35 or younger because I still think that movie skews a little

[23:38] bit older.

[23:39] Number one, Harry Potter.

[23:41] I don't think we're ever going to see a Harry Potter pinball machine because of how JK

[23:45] rolling feels about bars and games and bars like pinball.

[23:51] All right.

[23:52] Now, 36 to 45.

[23:55] This is my age group.

[23:56] Okay, and this was 41% of voters.

[23:59] These are your 10 most popular themes you want.

[24:03] Number 10, NHL hockey game.

[24:05] Okay, so there hasn't been an NHL pinball.

[24:07] Now, that actually would be fun when you think about it.

[24:09] I mean, you could have it be a lot like a Papa Deuk's World Cup soccer, where you're

[24:14] trying to score a goal.

[24:15] Kind of makes sense, right?

[24:17] That little goal with a hockey, goalie going back and forth seems sort of perfect.

[24:22] It also seems perfect to have like, you know, the ball frees in the middle and have like

[24:26] a face off.

[24:28] And you could have like, imagine being able to control with the flippers.

[24:31] Oh, man, like instead of flippers, you've got like two hockey sticks down there.

[24:36] That would be fucking awesome.

[24:37] All right.

[24:38] Number nine.

[24:39] The Princess Bride, as you wish.

[24:43] I think that is a super campy fun movie that a lot of people remember would be great.

[24:49] Number eight.

[24:50] The Beatles, here we are again, the Beatles.

[24:52] Well, you're not going to have to wish for the Beatles.

[24:54] It's happening.

[24:55] Number seven, Iron Maiden.

[24:58] Well, what's weird to me is, why are people, top 10 dream pinball themes, why are people

[25:04] putting Iron Maiden as a dream theme when it's already out?

[25:08] To me, a dream is something that's not yet out.

[25:12] What do you dream of happening?

[25:13] I don't know if the dream of Iron Maiden coming out because it's fucking out.

[25:17] Number six, Monty Python.

[25:19] You know, I have to go on the record for saying to like, I think I'm too young for Monty

[25:25] Python.

[25:26] I mean, I remember the movies coming out, but I'm not the biggest Monty Python fan.

[25:30] Like, I watch those movies.

[25:32] I enjoy them, but I'm not enamored by them.

[25:35] Okay.

[25:36] Number five, Rick and Morty.

[25:38] I have to be honest.

[25:40] Rick and Morty, man, I haven't even seen a Rick and Morty show.

[25:44] And maybe that's just me, but it seems like it's really popular based upon a lot of these

[25:50] surveys.

[25:51] So I definitely will check it out.

[25:52] Number four, Beetlejuice.

[25:54] Yes.

[25:55] The first Beetlejuice movie is Freakin' Incredible.

[26:00] Tim Burton.

[26:01] People of the sea almost all of Tim Burton's classic movies made into Pimball Machines.

[26:07] If you made an Edward Scissorhands Pimball Machine with that soundtrack and the ice sculpting

[26:13] and Edward and all the scenes from the movie, here's another Tim Burton movie that I'm

[26:17] surprised is not on this list, but should be.

[26:21] Imagine making a Pimball Machine for Peewee's Big Adventure.

[26:25] I mean, all of his films, all of his old original films would be incredible.

[26:31] Willie Wonka, number three.

[26:32] Well, look, that's happening.

[26:34] So I think people are going to be really excited.

[26:36] Again, I've been reading that thread and getting very excited as people talk about how

[26:41] well the Willie Wonka movie will translate into a Pimball Machine.

[26:45] And I wholeheartedly agree.

[26:47] I wholeheartedly agree.

[26:49] And we know it's coming from Jack.

[26:51] And I would just wait.

[26:52] Literally, it's like another reason why I wouldn't buy pirates because I would much

[26:56] rather have Willie Wonka as a theme.

[26:58] And I guess what, it's being designed by the same dude.

[27:01] So if you can be patient, I would wait.

[27:05] Number two, back to the future.

[27:07] So what is the future of back to the future Pimball?

[27:11] Who is going to remake it?

[27:13] And when will that happen?

[27:14] I think the rumors for the longest time was that Dutch would do it, but that's not going

[27:18] to happen.

[27:20] Number one again, Harry Potter.

[27:22] Harry Potter Pimball.

[27:24] Who can get Harry Potter?

[27:26] People mentions Archer, Wutan clan, Mad Max, Labyrinth and Led Zeppelin.

[27:31] All right.

[27:32] 46 years are older.

[27:34] Number 10, Futurama.

[27:36] Number nine, Blues Brothers.

[27:38] Number eight, Willie Wonka.

[27:40] Number seven, Blade Runner.

[27:42] Number six, Money Python.

[27:43] Number five, Predator.

[27:45] Man, I really wish someone would make a Predator game and not fuck it up.

[27:49] Number four, Beatles.

[27:51] Number three, Disney's haunted mansion.

[27:55] Really?

[27:57] Number two, Rush.

[27:58] Ugh.

[27:59] And number one, again, Harry Potter.

[28:03] Notice anything, guys?

[28:05] Guys really want Harry Potter.

[28:07] All right.

[28:08] And there's a lot more surveys that he's done, but I'll say this.

[28:13] I'll say this.

[28:14] Those are some awesome themes.

[28:15] All right.

[28:16] So, you know, I'm looking at this and Harry Potter, Willie Wonka.

[28:22] You know, these things keep coming to the top.

[28:24] No one said Transformers.

[28:25] I'm shocked.

[28:27] I'm shocked.

[28:28] Nobody really said like toy story.

[28:32] Nobody really said the Matrix.

[28:33] Some of these are coming up in other surveys he's done.

[28:37] But Harry Potter, man, it is like the one that everyone wants.

[28:43] And my point is this.

[28:45] My point is this.

[28:46] And you know you listen to this show.

[28:47] And I talk a lot about theme and only making pinball machines that are worth making.

[28:53] No one on that list did you see October Fest?

[28:55] No one on that list did you.

[28:58] No one on that list did you see really dialed in as a theme?

[29:01] You can't have a dream theme, be like an original theme.

[29:04] I did see in the thread that someone said they should make a dialed in movie and release

[29:09] it on Netflix.

[29:10] And that would get more people into this incredible theme and get more hype around the game.

[29:16] And I'm sorry.

[29:17] But dialed in is like the most incredible pinball machine that is just wrapped.

[29:21] And probably one of the most mundane packages.

[29:24] And it's not me who just feels this way.

[29:26] It's all the you guys too.

[29:29] All right.

[29:30] All right.

[29:31] So look, what's fun about this hobby is we can dream about what's next.

[29:36] And even though I mentioned all of those titles coming out, there's still so many titles

[29:41] coming out that we have no idea.

[29:44] Like what is Deeproot planning to make?

[29:46] Well we're going to find out some news on Deeproot because as we saw on this week in

[29:51] pinball, there was a tour of the Deeproot facilities by Jeff.

[29:56] And we'll see how much he's able to disclose.

[29:59] And when he saw on that tour, but that's going to be revealed on the site Thursday.

[30:04] So we look forward to seeing what he saw at Deeproot.

[30:08] I invited him on to the show.

[30:09] I was like, dude, come on.

[30:11] Like join the big league podcast.

[30:12] Like come on this show.

[30:14] We all know that this show much better, much, no, I'm just joking, but maybe I'm not.

[30:20] All right.

[30:21] So let's go down to list some news and then we will conclude this episode of Canadian Spinball

[30:25] Podcast.

[30:27] So I want to talk first about Highway Pimball.

[30:30] And I know what you're thinking and it's not what you're thinking.

[30:33] I want to actually congratulate the people in the Highway Pimball Owners Club for all

[30:39] of the passion and dedication you guys are putting into this game.

[30:44] I mean, if you go into the thread, people are remaking plastics.

[30:48] They're remaking the LED light boards for the game and they're offering these things up

[30:53] to all of the owners so they can make their games as reliable and bulletproof as possible.

[31:01] And I think it's great.

[31:02] And I think it's an amazing testament to the kind of people that are in this hobby.

[31:08] It is a hobby filled with people that will always be aimed at creating solutions and helping

[31:16] out their fellow Pinsiders and their fellow Pimball players and their fellow Pimball collectors.

[31:23] When you stop with all the drama and now that a lot of these companies have gone under,

[31:28] you know, like Highway and Dutch and Skit B and Zidware, you know, when the drama ends

[31:34] and you stop listening to idiots like Wise Snow and, you know, Hilton and how we can't afford

[31:40] a cell phone and how that makes them buy more Pins.

[31:42] When you tune out the idiots, like if you put the 15 idiots on Pinside on ignore and you just read

[31:50] what's going on, it's usually really positive and it's people helping each other out.

[31:55] It's people talking about new code, about new upgrades, new mods and new solutions to problems

[32:00] with Pins and that's a great thing.

[32:02] I mean, that is the reason why 99% of you are in this hobby.

[32:05] It's because of that level of support.

[32:07] So I just want to congratulate those guys for doing all the work and getting those games

[32:12] to a more reliable state.

[32:13] The one item it seems like is really hard to fix is that Xenohead,

[32:19] which just seems like it was engineered so poorly.

[32:22] And it does suck that people have to turn that thing off when it's the main toy in the game.

[32:27] So hopefully someone can figure out how to make that thing work reliably.

[32:31] All right, let's talk about Jersey Jack Pimball.

[32:34] So Jeff over at this week in Pimball, he emailed Jack and asked him about the Wizard of Oz,

[32:42] Yellow brick road edition, which is coming out.

[32:45] Now the reason why we know this game is coming out, the reason why we know

[32:49] from what is it?

[32:51] Had to head Pimball talked about it first.

[32:53] It's because Wayne over there in Australia, he knows everything that is going on.

[32:59] He was right when I talked about how Jersey Jack was getting rid of their CEO.

[33:06] Wayne told me that and then I mistakenly,

[33:10] Jack's people were like, that's false, that's not true.

[33:13] And then they were yelling at me.

[33:14] So then I retracted my statement and said,

[33:17] kind of told Wayne what he's doing, that's hurtful information,

[33:21] ended up being true.

[33:23] So it was the Jersey Jack people who were making shit up.

[33:25] They knew their CEO was gone.

[33:28] Anyway, so he asked Jack

[33:32] about the Yellow brick road because I'm sure Wayne told people that it's happening.

[33:36] And here's what, I want to read Jersey Jack's email back

[33:41] to Jeff at this week in Pimball.

[33:43] Now Jeff published this, so this is not like a private correspondence.

[33:46] And I want to give my commentary on some of what Jack says.

[33:50] So he says, this is Jack, in the past, we announced games that we were not yet in production.

[33:57] Every time we did that, the excitement was off the chart.

[34:01] And we booked thousands of game orders for loyal Jersey Jack customers who patiently waited

[34:08] and today still wait for their games.

[34:11] Okay, thousands, okay.

[34:14] I'd like to go forward and show games that we can deliver in a short time frame.

[34:20] With that, I don't have any game to announce at this moment.

[34:25] We are working on five different model games now,

[34:29] which while there is excitement and speculation, rumor and hope,

[34:32] I'm not going to confirm or deny anything at this time.

[34:35] So I want to stop there for a minute.

[34:38] Because Jack always says this.

[34:42] He always says that we're not going to announce games early,

[34:47] that it always creates a lot of excitement.

[34:51] And you know, then people wait a year.

[34:53] They wait two years.

[34:55] And so when he says, you know, because he doesn't really,

[34:58] here's what's weird to me about this response.

[35:00] And I'll keep reading, there's more to go.

[35:04] Is that Jeff is not asking him to confirm a new title.

[35:07] He's simply asking him, are you going to make WAS again,

[35:12] which has already been out for years?

[35:14] And are you just going to make a new trim level of WAS?

[35:18] And I think Jack's sort of dancing around that question by saying,

[35:23] well, we don't want to announce a title too early and get people excited

[35:26] and they have to wait.

[35:27] So here's what I think it's kind of silly when you apply that to Wizard of Oz is

[35:33] everyone, anyone can go get a Wizard of Oz.

[35:35] Like they're not hard to get.

[35:37] So there's not going to be that level of like,

[35:39] well, if I hear about the Yellowbric Road Edition and I have to wait,

[35:43] like, that's going to really upset me.

[35:46] No, nobody, nobody is clamoring to get more WASs right now.

[35:51] All right, so then Jack says, Jeff, I'll say that we are probably the only pinball company

[35:57] that is still actively manufacturing all of the game titles that we have introduced.

[36:03] We have some stock of Black Arrow Hobbit, which is an amazing game, especially with the new code.

[36:10] Okay, I want to stop there for a second.

[36:12] For Jack to take credit for actively manufacturing all of the game titles that they have introduced,

[36:20] it's kind of comical when you think about it.

[36:22] Because Jack, great, you're actively making how many games after so many years you're making

[36:30] Wizard of Oz, the Hobbit, Dial then, and Pirates of the Caribbean.

[36:36] So you only have ever introduced four games.

[36:41] So wow, like, you're actively manufacturing four titles.

[36:47] Meanwhile, over at Stern Pinball, they're actively manufacturing one, two, three, four, five,

[36:56] six, seven, eight, nine titles.

[37:00] Nine.

[37:01] So they're actively manufacturing more than twice the number of games that you are right now.

[37:08] And that's not the only thing is over the last five years Stern has also stopped

[37:14] manufacturing certain titles.

[37:17] They've probably released 20 games in five years where Jack's made four.

[37:24] So it's just a weird thing to sort of take credit for.

[37:27] It's like, is that really something that's special or should you have been on game like six,

[37:35] seven, and eight by now if things were going smoothly?

[37:39] He then goes on to say we have Dial then, Ellie games, and literally a couple of collector

[37:44] edition games and again, a spectacular game that will also get another code update soon.

[37:51] So there we go, Dial then, Collectors editions, 150 then didn't sell out.

[37:58] And once again, once again, it just goes to show that Jack as much as I love him and I love

[38:06] what they're doing, the way he handled the collector's edition was so bogus and he lied.

[38:13] He lied to people when he said we're only going to make the number of collector edition orders we

[38:22] get in by January 1st and that's it. And then he's like, we're making 150. Oh really? You got

[38:30] exactly that tight number of orders. No, they announced a number that was more than the actual

[38:38] orders were and then they made them and they didn't sell out. Do you really think he only has two?

[38:44] You think he only has a couple? BS. I bet he's got parts for way more than that.

[38:50] But the problem is he's screwed over those collectors edition people because think about it.

[38:56] If there were legitimately only let's say 57 collector edition orders that were placed,

[39:04] then those 57 people should have gotten a very rare limited game. They should not have had three

[39:13] times as many made as there was demand because again, those small group of fanatics, they should have

[39:22] been allowed to set where the demand was at. Not Jack's arbitrary number. And the same thing is

[39:29] happening with pirates. It's just an arbitrary number that he's going to try and make. Now I think

[39:35] after all the hype that is left pirates, we're not going to see those 200 collector's editions fly

[39:41] out the door. And I actually, I don't think people want to look at like an ugly squid face. Anyway,

[39:46] he then goes, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is in full production. We just shipped a full

[39:50] container to Australia yesterday and two containers are being loaded for Europe this week. All right,

[39:56] that's good news. And we saw Joe from pinball star went over there and it does look like pirates

[40:00] as the production has begun. And it's just rows and rows and rows of pirates. So that's good news

[40:05] for you guys who have been waiting a long time. He then goes on to say we are planning to go back

[40:10] into production of Wizard of Oz sometime in the next several weeks. That's no secret. We have

[40:16] told our distributors that so they can make some plans. It's an amazing game and my personal favorite.

[40:22] And we get people asking to buy them every day. Okay, so will that be the yellow brick road

[40:26] edition? He does not go on to say he then finishes with pinball has been in the news constantly.

[40:32] And it makes me smile to read every morsel of coverage on us and everyone else trying to build

[40:37] pinball machines. That was not the case several years ago. The tremendous growth that pinball shows

[40:44] and tournaments around the world. The enterprising and passionate people who have sprung up to make

[40:49] amazing pinball mods toys lights kits graphics. And more just makes me giddy. Many of those ideas were

[40:57] in my head years ago, but were rejected and laughed at. We support and encourage all of those efforts.

[41:03] Now it's time for us to laugh along with our loyal customers who love pinball dearly and to

[41:08] introduce this amazing game to millions of new players who discover pinball for the first time.

[41:13] All right, Jack. Let me let me break it down for you. Millions of new players is never happening.

[41:20] Millions of new people playing pinball. You're not making the next call of duty. You're not making

[41:26] the next fortnight. Millions of new people are playing Spider-Man on PlayStation 4. Yeah, there'll be

[41:32] a few thousand new people playing pinball, but not millions. Let's get real here. All right.

[41:40] And look, Jack, this response is Jack. Jack is in a good mood. And when I talked to him last,

[41:47] I mean, he's living his dream. He's making pinball machines. I really want Jack to be as successful

[41:52] as possible. And I just think he needs to get wonka out and have it be a hit. I do think pirate

[41:58] type is not going to be where he wanted it to be. I think he realizes he made a colossal mistake.

[42:04] It'll be a year to the date from its reveal. 12 months, people had a wait from seeing it, seeing

[42:10] endless streams about it before people actually got their games. And I think that wait was too long.

[42:15] And I do think I think hype is kind of gone. All right. And then we got guys like, you know,

[42:20] Jeff's pinball pal is trying to hype pirates of the Caribbean. He writes this. Jersey Jack

[42:24] pinball, pirates of the Caribbean has more movies, chapters, multiples, multiple,

[42:28] multiplier types, characters with rules and depth than any other pin. There are lots of game features.

[42:34] Five flippers, two ramps, one spinning disc, one upper playfield that rocks plus a large LCD.

[42:40] Masquerading as the back box code has a multiple on a wizard mode for each film and players collect

[42:45] gold and treasures, play liars dice and plunder as they progress. There is a compass to show you

[42:50] where to get the biggest points. L.E.D. Starfield maps showing shot hints. And an LCD did as off the chain

[42:56] good displaying an interactive map of progress. The game looks fabulous. Code is deep in the

[43:01] gameplay smooth. Most importantly, it looks fun to shoot and to be the type of game you'd want to

[43:07] keep for a generation if you bought one. With or without the hype, I'm getting one. Well, thanks,

[43:15] Jeff's pinball palace. Are you getting one? Here's the thing, man. All of that is true, Jeff.

[43:21] All of it. And the game is just a convoluted, overly complex mess. You can have all that stuff.

[43:30] It doesn't make for what pinball should be. It's too complex. I'm sorry. There's too much going on,

[43:37] too much crammed into it, too much, too much, too much, too much, too much. Walk up to that

[43:42] machine and try to figure out what to do. I mean, I see the rule sets. It's stupid. Need like a

[43:47] Bible to understand how everything connects. It's not intuitive. Pinball needs to be intuitive.

[43:55] It shouldn't be all of that. You don't need all of that. And that's the problem at Jersey Jack.

[44:00] Is they put all of it in because they think they need to put every goddamn idea into every goddamn

[44:05] game and it ends up being just over the top. All right, you might disagree. You might want all of

[44:12] that, all of that depth, all of that this, all the bullshit, bullshit. I look at Batman 66

[44:19] and I can figure out what to do. There's like 200 less inserts probably on Batman 66. And that's

[44:27] okay with me because I understand what to do. There's not like a million things happening on

[44:31] the screen. It's it's it's overboard. Absolutely overboard. There is so much depth in Batman 66.

[44:41] But the reason why Lyman, I think, blows Keith away is he knows how to make his depth accessible.

[44:49] If you're just a casual player, you're going to enjoy his machines. And if you want to go a little

[44:54] bit deeper, you can. And if you want to go a little bit deeper than that, you can. There is new Batman 66

[44:59] code recently updated. It's amazing how deep the game is, but how easy it is to understand

[45:05] how to get to those things. Pirates of the Caribbean, forget it. I don't know how many tutorials I need

[45:11] to watch before it clicks because it's just not clicking. All right, I got to end this soon because

[45:16] my battery's about to die. So for Stern, it looks like Deadpool sales are continuing to roll in.

[45:22] Lots of people buying LEDs. I saw a frog like, you know, when he buys the LED, it just that's

[45:27] like the woodish head moment. You know, your Ellie hype has worked because he's there standing next

[45:32] of the box with his thumbs up. Isn't it amazing how easy it is to sell games when you actually make

[45:39] them on time? Isn't it amazing, right? How pinball, how marketing works when you actually show people

[45:44] something? And then you can take their money and get them a product in a few weeks. That's how

[45:48] all products should work. So congrats to Stern. Home pin, it seems like they're shipping their

[45:54] Thunderbirds and the coin doors don't work in the US for some reasons. So operators are having a

[45:59] nightmare. Some guy wrote very disappointing. I was told this is a piece of arcade equipment.

[46:04] I can't even operate it until I remove or rewire the coin door. It does not even have coin switches

[46:10] or an LED for this second coin slot. It's really more of a toy. I can't even figure out how to get

[46:16] it to take dollars. All right, well that sucks. But again, it wasn't made for the US market. So I'm

[46:22] not even sure what these people expected. I'm happy to report that Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle,

[46:28] number 66, the spot that was being sold forever has sold for 800 bucks. So there is hope for Alice

[46:35] Cooper's Nightmare Castle. No, I mean, cool. Cool. Now you have to wait. TNA, if someone asks,

[46:42] if total nuclear annihilation stopped production at 550 units, if it would skyrocket in price.

[46:52] I wish someone would stand in front of me and ask me, hey, Chris, do you think total

[46:59] nuclear annihilation will skyrocket in price if they only make 550? I would then take my right hand,

[47:07] I would raise it up and I would slap that person as hard as I could right in their face. If you think

[47:14] TNA is going to go up in price, bullshit. No, absolutely not. It's not going to be seen as

[47:20] like this limited run game. And also Charlie's already said like it's not even limited, they could

[47:24] always make more. The only way you maintain future price and future demand on a collectible is if

[47:33] people feel no more will be made, right? If people feel no more, the big Lebowskis will ever be made.

[47:39] Those games will start to become worth 20,000, 25,000 dollars easily. But, but if someone

[47:47] remakes the big Lebowskis, those games will lose all that value. And that's why it's hard to go in

[47:53] on some of these like these rare games that have too much uncertainty surrounding them. And the reason

[48:00] why the mystery game I know about is going to make people go nuts to own one is because there's only

[48:07] going to be a certain amount and that's it. And that's not going to be remade, it's not going to be

[48:10] vault addition, it's not going to like, you know, go under and be a lawsuit to get your money. And none

[48:15] of that shit, you're going to buy a game knowing that only a small number of people on the planet

[48:22] earth out of the millions of people that according to Jersey Jack that are introduced to Pimball every year.

[48:28] The millions of new people playing Pimball, only a small number will be able to experience this game.

[48:35] Okay, that is what I'm excited for. Small, unique, boutique Pimball. And of course I'm excited for

[48:44] the rest of the stuff coming out, but it doesn't feel special to me because they'll make all that stuff

[48:48] for years. Anyone can get it. And that's cool. But I am speaking from the lens of a collector.

[48:56] Collector's don't want stuff everyone has. Frolux collection as impressive as his game room looks.

[49:03] Not impressive. He has nothing there that is like even rare. It's just funny. He's like spent all

[49:08] this money. And I bet most days that guys are K doesn't even get turned on. I know it's like you

[49:14] have to like have these game nights and beg people to come over just to justify the $100,000 in games

[49:19] that you have in your house. Kind of silly if you ask me. Anyway, anyway, everyone happy Monday will be

[49:26] back with some guests eventually. Until then, until then, please beg all of your manufacturers to make

[49:34] Transformers the movie the original into a Pimball game. I'm out.

[49:40] Now light our darkest hour.

[49:59] Fight Daniel! Springard, what's going on?

[50:03] Don't time to answer that now. Let's get out of here!

[50:17] Autobots, Transform and Robot.

[50:26] I knew you had to tension that.

[50:33] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

[50:55] W勝 me! You can't ... destroy.

[51:00] I...

[51:02] just...

[51:15] Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian Wars as we march forward to a new age of peace and happiness.

[51:24] Till all are one!

[51:25] Till all are one!

[51:28] Till all are one!

[51:30] Till all are one!

[51:31] Till all are one!

[51:34] You got the power!

[51:36] Oh!

[51:41] Yeah!

[51:56] Transformer!
