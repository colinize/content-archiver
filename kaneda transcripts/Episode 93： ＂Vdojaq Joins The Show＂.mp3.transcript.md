[00:00] Alright, here we are, episode 93 of Canadian's Pinball Podcast and I have to say I'm a little

[00:27] bit hung over today. I went to see bone thugs and harmony and they went on stage about two and a

[00:34] half hours later than they were supposed to, which was annoying. They're not guns and roses. They

[00:40] don't deserve to have such a prima donna start time. But I want to say thank you to Nelson for buying

[00:47] me a couple drinks and for hanging out and then going to play Magic Girl at Canada's apartment.

[00:53] Nelson, thank you so much. I am sorry that we were drinking my super strong manhadans and then I

[00:59] started calling you Dennis midway through the night. But that just goes to show how strong my man

[01:05] had in drinks are. I swear to God every time I go in to those drinks, I'm like I'm not going to

[01:10] get drunk, things are going to be fine and all bets are off. I mean it's crazy. This is going

[01:17] to be a great podcast. I got to interview Jack Shields. You know him as video Jack on

[01:24] Pinside and I give Jack a lot of credit. Jack hit me up and he's one of the very few people

[01:30] who ever has sort of come on the show under the sort of pretense that he just wants to ask me some

[01:37] tough questions and have a conversation about pinball and I give Jack a lot of credit for doing that

[01:42] and we had a really good talk and I wish more of you out there who wanted to sort of ask me questions

[01:48] or even you know combat me in a little bit or challenge my views of pinball. Come on the show.

[01:55] Come on the show. I think you'll find that my passion is real and that my knowledge of pinball

[02:00] is good enough is good enough. I'm really not the best at knowing everything going on in a game.

[02:06] But I know enough to talk about pinball in an educational way. So without further ado,

[02:14] I want to air the interview. I want to say there's going to be a new magic girl video that gets

[02:20] uploaded today where I show you guys what's behind the back box and I look forward also so you

[02:25] guys know just little news item. Alien pinball has landed in Wisconsin, Hilton is unboxed his. I

[02:31] look forward to seeing the gameplay videos on that as well and lastly I just want to say like all

[02:37] the drama back and forth about magic girl. I think everyone just needs to like relax.

[02:43] Here's the thing. No one's going to make 30 more magic girls. I keep reading this like well we'll

[02:47] just make more and auction them off. There's no money to make them. All right so just common sense

[02:53] guys. Where do you think John got the money to make the 25 he did? It wasn't from your Razimoney,

[02:59] he wasn't from your Alice in Wonderland money. It was from American pinball. There are so much

[03:05] new money that got pumped in to make these games and now they're done with John. They're done.

[03:11] There are not going to be more magic girls made and who knows what they're going to go for an

[03:16] eBay? Who knows I hear everything from 26 to 50 grand. I don't know what people are going to spend.

[03:22] I know that this. There's a lot of really rich dudes in this hobby and if two really rich guys

[03:28] want one magic girl, the sky is the limit but mine's not going anywhere. Mine's not going anywhere

[03:33] and I think Nelson can back me up on this. He had a great time playing it. I mean the game is fun

[03:40] to flip. I think everyone has the same feeling when they jump on it. They're like oh my god I'm

[03:45] actually playing a magic girl and that is where the value is. There is an experience in it that's

[03:50] hard to describe. It'll never be appreciated by the tournament players that are looking for

[03:55] wizard modes. It'll never be appreciated by guys that don't understand collectible items.

[04:02] Why collectible items are worth what they're worth? Okay that's my spiel. I got to get back to

[04:07] watching the Bachelor with Brenda. Here's video jack. Unedited our conversation. I think you

[04:14] guys are going to love this one. We'll be back this week with some more news items. Let's roll the

[04:18] tape. All right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to Canators Pinball Podcast. Someone that

[04:23] I'm really excited to have on because I'm always saying if you want to join the show and you want

[04:29] to talk to Canator just email me and I know one on Pinside ever takes me up but Jack shields

[04:36] out in Chicago. He's on Pinside Jack. What is your what's your screen name on on Pinside?

[04:42] It's video J.A.Q. Which is video Jack. Video Jack. All right. It's just a stupid story. Years ago

[04:52] when I was on record games video arcade collecting and I was trying to be clever and because I was

[04:59] really into video games was trying to come up with a video Jack email address at AOL. Okay and

[05:05] everything was taken so I went the license plate version. Well Jack I really appreciate you coming

[05:10] on the show because you're the first. You're the first person who's actually like taking me up on

[05:15] the offer to come on. I know you ask people for questions so welcome to Canators Pinball Podcast.

[05:21] I'm really excited to have this conversation with you. Okay well I appreciate it. It's your show

[05:26] so we'll respect that. Yeah I did get there were some people that that did PME some messages

[05:35] and quite honestly they're a bunch of smart asses. It's it's nothing I'm going to repeat because

[05:41] it's really not worth it. Right right. I've got I've got to say anything I'm going to say anyway

[05:46] so it really doesn't need to be asked. Right I'm sure a bunch of people are questioning my sexuality

[05:51] in life but like Jack let's let's talk pinball so I know you have some thoughts on on the hobby

[05:56] on pinside let's just dive into it so like what what where's your head at right now when it comes to

[06:02] pinball. Oh I'm thoroughly disgusted with pinball itself I love I mean there's nothing that's ever

[06:08] going to detract me from that. It's it's pinside I'm just completely disillusioned with right now

[06:15] because it's just somebody's people and they're and I'm sure you're going to appreciate this

[06:23] but you've kind of made your own bet and we'll get into that. Right but some of these idiots that are

[06:30] on and you know I'm going to be frank about it. Some of these guys that are on these witch hunts

[06:35] out there because they think they're going to save the world are just totally assinine and you know

[06:42] I know you follow pinside it's no secret and you can see what's going on and I and I won't name

[06:48] anybody by name because it's just not fair but you know what your pinside identity that's fair

[06:54] game and I'm going to call out to right now uh mr. Wolf Marsh and Pez Punk I give me a break

[07:03] you two guys I mean be it now this is the whole reason I came on your show is because I started

[07:10] calling you special K and because I called you that uh which by the looks of your last video uh

[07:20] which by the way was great your magical video thank you you sitting there at the coffee table

[07:27] with the box of special K it's obviously that you have graphed that as a term of a deerment

[07:34] but every other one of these retards oh excuse me I used a bad word uh

[07:40] are out with the pitchforks because I said special K um you're insulting people you are

[07:49] demeaning special needs children you don't know the damage you are causing are you kidding me

[07:57] right a serious were you ever offended because I called you special K

[08:03] it was actually one of the most flattering things I've been called on the inside so no I was not

[08:07] offended actually and I'll be it honestly by me that's probably the most flattering thing I've

[08:12] called you on pencil but I mean the where where do these people coming out of the woodwork do they

[08:18] not have lives do it is it just pinball all day and pinside all night I mean but I think you I think

[08:25] I think that's like let's stop on that point because I do think that some people live on

[08:30] pinside like they live on it like like like I won't name names but I'll name names like Hilton and

[08:35] Levy they're on all day long all day long no matter what hour of day they're hyperactive and it

[08:41] is the center of their universe and I think when you make it the center of your universe it really

[08:47] turns people upside down and they act out of character and it's not a healthy thing to make it

[08:53] you're you know the center of your world okay so then why is it so important for you to be on there

[08:59] I'm not on there all right well I mean I mean my my last my last duplicate account that I had

[09:06] recently big bang bar was the name was was banned when I put up a little bit of a you know I said

[09:11] like I've got magic girl and if you delete this thread I won't share any information um yes yes

[09:16] or no question that you just admitted it for yes or no question you've had several different

[09:20] pinside names oh sure I've had since I've been banned when I was see when I remember when I was

[09:26] like banned originally for having a duplicate account but the thing side isn't so important to you

[09:30] why do you need all these aliases why do you keep coming back no it's a good question so I look

[09:35] for the most part the reason why I do dupe account is to PM people just in case there's something I

[09:41] want to buy and just in case I want to get people on the show because that's for me that's the

[09:45] struggle now is I can invite people as guests and communicate with them without an account and it's

[09:52] I call bullshit on that answer all right I call bullshit oh so but here's the thing I I can't

[09:59] dupe account and share any information that indicates it's me right so it's like it's it's almost like

[10:07] if I'm when I get back on I know that like my time is limited right so like it's people will find

[10:14] me out immediately so it's I've never really the only account I had that was consistently I'm

[10:21] surprised they let it go for so long was the it was like the how does the female one is the the

[10:27] lady some lady something lady slingshot right they let that stay on for like three months and I was

[10:33] shocked then I knew they knew it was me but then eventually they just they they they they kicked it

[10:39] but since then I mean I haven't really had any dupe accounts in a while and I know Robin is like

[10:44] all these really had I again you don't have to answer this

[10:49] there's no way in hell you're gonna tell me with a straight face that you don't still have some

[10:57] IP address uh your name is Fernando Venezuela you live in the Bronx right you're not lurking on

[11:05] pinside still so here's here's I'm not gonna get that through here yet I'm not gonna buy it

[11:11] Jack I I'm honest right now I have no dupes but I'll tell you this here's how I do dupe because this

[11:17] is like this is why it's just like all of robins measures that he puts in place with like verified

[11:22] accounts and donations it doesn't matter all I got to do is go to any hotel any FedEx

[11:28] kinkos anywhere where there's like another IP address and sign up and I can be on there in a minute

[11:35] and so it's just I told Robin I'm like Robin it's just easier to have me on there than it is to

[11:40] have me off but you know like we we've sort of both made our beds and he wants to control the

[11:45] content of my podcast that that was the agreement he's like I'll let you back on in like two years

[11:50] if you never say anything about a pinside member again and I'm like no like I'm not gonna make

[11:54] that agreement so it we we are where we are with with it right but again I'm gonna go back to the

[12:00] comment that you made your own bed you absolutely were the king of sending some pretty nasty

[12:07] pms and Robin was on the receiving end of that yeah definitely definitely I don't either I don't

[12:15] that's the thing is like I tell people I I know why I'm banned and I behaved like a jackass

[12:23] like when after I was banned and I regret it like it's like when we see like ice men right get

[12:28] drunk fly off the handle wake up the next day and be sorry for our behavior like I'm the same way

[12:32] like if I drink and do a stupid podcast or drink an email robin it's like I'm not happy about that

[12:38] stuff and and so like I get it you know it's it's and and that's why I took breaks because it just

[12:44] became too much of my world and when I stepped away I think since I've been back I've been much

[12:51] better but that's it you you do keep coming back the drug yeah you cannot deny the draw you

[12:58] and look and I'm not putting you down for this but I'm gonna I'll repeat exactly what I sent you

[13:03] in my email yesterday you are an intention horror right you are you're opening of your video now

[13:11] again I see your video on magic girl was wonderful thank you but you're opening you're doing an

[13:17] opening monologue like it's the Jimmy Kimmel show right I mean you looking for attention you love it

[13:22] of course and and your actions of keep coming back and I and I'm banned and I have to come back

[13:32] is and there's people who have called you this and I've called you this it's narcissistic

[13:37] and your behavior has been a it's the pure definition of it right well here's I don't think you deny it

[13:48] well I will I think that's part of the reason why you know that you fucked up right well I would

[13:55] agree look yes am I do I seek attention yes the word horror yes I mean look at the end of the day

[14:03] I have a podcast right I think everyone who posts on pin side on the hyper users and I was one of them

[14:09] the reason you do it is for attention I mean that is the addictive behavior of forums

[14:14] and if look I'll say this though if I was just an attention horror if I was just a narcissist nobody

[14:20] would listen to my podcast nobody so they're you know coupled with that desire to to create something

[14:27] that people are drawn to has to be some value and I think what this podcast does you know outside

[14:32] of pin side is provide a commentary in entertaining one that people are drawn to and I think you know

[14:39] I so I think I get I get labeled as like the negative sides it up but there's also a positive side

[14:44] like you know rock rock and roll singers are attention horrors and and narcissists and egomaniacs

[14:49] and primadanas but we love them you know so there's some but they also get paid millions to do what

[14:54] they do right well well well somebody somebody wanted to pay me that kind of money I throw a wig on

[14:58] and become the biggest asshole on stage let's go well my profession though in marketing like I get paid

[15:04] a decent salary to get brands attention like my I'm I'm engineered to be like to go into any

[15:10] environment and do something that gets attention and so like pin sides a great example you know

[15:15] canada has been off it for a year more than a year right it's still like this legendary like demigod

[15:24] and they give they give me the account name yeah only the account in the name has been off

[15:28] inside you've the name can't canada has been don't any any thread that's got any sort of uh you know

[15:36] any sort of fighting going on trust me your name in there so yeah you you're off inside but you've

[15:42] never really been off pin side yeah no I'm in the heads and in the minds of of the people on there

[15:47] so Jack let's go back to something you're talking about like the witch hunt that takes place on

[15:51] pin sides so besides like you know there's like this witch hunt of like people's character right

[15:56] and and what are your thoughts on it's a pinball form right and it becomes this like and it's just

[16:02] perfect it is it's a pinball form and I'm glad you asked it because I'm going to take everybody back

[16:07] about six to eight months and we're going to go right into the J pop thread um and I'm in this

[16:15] this one was a real touchy one but again let's go back to win vid what is it vid 1900 yep

[16:22] this guy is one of the most respected people his threads on repairs play field restorations all

[16:32] this bulletproofing belly boards ever this guy is a go to guy for information on pin side agree

[16:40] totally agree I totally agree all right so vid used some real poor judgment and some real bad

[16:49] real bad taste now mind you I thought it was funny but that's unthick skin but he put the picture

[16:56] of the lynching and superimposed J pop on one of the figures that were being lynched and again

[17:04] out comes the pin side witch hunters one of the most respected people on pin side he's a racist

[17:12] he's a bigot he should be banned for life well 90% of these people who throw around terms like racist

[17:20] and bigot have no clue what the actual meaning of that is they know it by what some asshole on tv

[17:27] has been preaching and they think that they know it too vids not a racist vids not a bigot he is

[17:34] just used poor taste but of course the fit pitch forks were out and she some of the same names were

[17:42] out there with their pitch forks right okay so you throw you throw them off pin side then what do

[17:48] you have you got nothing you you've done nothing but get rid of a guy that's done nothing but good

[17:54] for pin side but he makes one mistake and I say it was a mistake it was not racist do us no

[18:01] racist intention all of us are piling on J pop and rightfully so J pop is a douchebag even though

[18:09] he delivered your machine um half a machine well you know it's more than half a machine uh but I

[18:17] mean this is the type of shit it's a pinball board guys right right it's about an inch and 16th

[18:25] silver ball that rolls around the playfield with a paddle sometimes three paddles sometimes four

[18:31] paddles a level or two that goes round and round and we all hit and we love it great we drop

[18:37] in quarters in these machines and we love it I I yeah I agree because I think that whenever the

[18:42] site becomes this sort of character assassination of people and there's also just a lack I think

[18:48] common sense like when you call me special okay like there's something about context of a delivery

[18:53] of something that is important if you just take stuff out of context and hyper focus on it so I

[18:58] would say and I tell my friends this all the time pinball is predominantly a white older male

[19:05] hobby filled with board guys with some of them have a lot of money some don't uh it's not a

[19:11] pinside is not a place for women or families or like you know a lot of there's not a lot of

[19:17] diversity in the hobby there's not like I challenge someone to find me a bunch of uh pinball

[19:23] expos or shows or tournaments where there's a diverse crowd right so when people

[19:29] pretend like it's this politically correct environment and then come out and so it's it's annoying

[19:35] it's like jeez just let like relax it's just a place guys are having fun all you have to do is take

[19:41] one walk around pinball expel the Chicago events you take a look around at who the attendees are

[19:47] yeah come on well that's what's annoying when robins like we want to make it a family friendly

[19:51] site like robin like my girlfriend's amazing people's wives are amazing they don't want to be on

[19:55] pinside dude like relax how many special needs children around pinside did I offend with special

[20:02] k exactly I can tell you I can count it on one finger and that finger doesn't exist well and and

[20:07] for someone you know and I said this and I actually took down the pockets because my brother got

[20:12] kind of pissed at me but you know with people who know special needs it's like it's it's it's it's

[20:18] it's you can't take it personally and I think the reason why Jack that things have gotten so shity

[20:24] on pinside recently is I think the moderation team has just like taken a vacation for the last

[20:28] like six months they used to moderate they don't anymore yeah well here that just rolls into this whole

[20:35] this whole the great purge that's coming there's no great purge coming they're not going to wipe

[20:40] out half a pinside look pinside was born was born years ago because what we had wreck games pinball

[20:49] on news net and you know what that turned into a complete shit show so robin in turn says hey I

[20:54] can do it better and he did we've got a wonderful pinside is a great place for this hobby pinside

[21:03] is a great place however if it becomes overmoderated or if we start purging people because of personal

[21:13] opinion and not fact somebody else in turn is going to say well I can do it better and we're going

[21:21] to be the pinside will become a thing of the past it'll become a ghost town just like wreck games is

[21:25] uh...

[21:27] so it is a fine line but yes uh... i don't fault the moderation team uh... you know because they have

[21:35] lives to but yes uh... you know it's but yeah i think for me for me the so i think it started you

[21:47] know they used to really moderate and they used to not not i don't even think they've monitored too

[21:51] much but it was like if you made your point and made it again and you were a broken record they

[21:55] would give you like a one day threat eject and if you went into a thread like like wise snow on

[22:01] magical like he's not even in on the game right he's he's leading a witch hunt to possess the

[22:07] game repossessed the games as assets because only because i bought one i mean it's pretty clear like

[22:11] the guy was nowhere in that thread until he heard i was getting one and then he was on a mission right

[22:16] and there comes a point where you know and i did this and this is why like i did deserve to be

[22:21] banned like i go into the habit thread and i'd be like you guys are already it's it's flow to you

[22:25] wasting your money like that's a dick move like that's trollish behavior and that ruins the excitement

[22:32] of a machine for people who are about to get it right so there's i could give my opinion about

[22:36] hobbit but if i beat the drum a thousand times about it then then i'm like breaking the laws of

[22:43] pincy right but i think they you hang on a stop you then yep uh because i i'm not quite sure if i

[22:48] can count if i've got enough uh room on a calculator to how many times you pump your chest that you

[22:54] bought a hellcat so you know you know pop me kettle so yeah but nobody like look when we were talking

[23:01] cars right and cars became a separate thread it was positive like and it looks the off topic stuff

[23:07] is kind of weird though people be like what do you think of the super bowl like why are we talking

[23:10] about that on pinside you know it's like um your reply would be wow the super bowl suck but i've

[23:16] got a hellcat yeah hell yeah look um cars and pinball are my two passions and i have oh i only have

[23:25] one car and one pinball machine right now so i i do beat a little bit look but but pinside is a

[23:31] little bit of that like everyone sort of showing what they got on on some level but but but so

[23:38] i think when the kpg thread came about right and that to me that was the turning point where like

[23:43] the moderators just sort of they let these people go on these individual crusades and these witch hunts

[23:49] that just they just took over the site for such a long time and like kpg would go into every single

[23:54] stern thread no matter what the stern thread was about and and just keep hammering home his

[24:01] personal hatred of stern and to me that ruins and spoils you're on it when you're on pinside

[24:08] as a canada it trust me you had your own agendas with somebody's manufacturers and you know it

[24:13] i do i do i i'm not still exactly you know the shitstorm that you were caught now again i think some

[24:20] people were a little bit thin skinned about you know what you were doing um but yeah you absolutely

[24:26] had a personal agenda with some of this stuff you can't say otherwise so jack do you and you were

[24:31] doing the same things you're not complaining about i i agree and then the do do you think that

[24:39] i should have been banned for doing similar stuff to do i mean it's like not like i'm i was

[24:43] different i wasn't personally attacking people the way like i would get attacked in every thread

[24:48] and in the moderation wouldn't do anything and then i'd say one thing and it's like he's banned

[24:52] he's horrible you know what i personally do i think you should have been banned for what you did

[24:57] as canada um probably not but what deserved your permanent ban was coming back under the aliases

[25:06] which is you know it's a big no no look there's guys all over the place doing it but they're quiet

[25:12] about it you don't know it's them when you would come back with your aliases all you had to do was

[25:17] type about two sentences and people knew it was you by the twine of your voice the words you were

[25:22] you it was no big secret who it was and then when you and again you know i don't have to be you know

[25:28] i'm not going to be to dead horse your pms were to to robin and the other moderators um dead sealed

[25:37] the deal for you so of course yes well you asked your question directly as canada should you have

[25:42] been banned for life probably not maybe thrown off for 30 days think about it come back

[25:47] and and play nice you know play nice under your terms not their terms right uh because i'm

[25:53] i'm one of those big things i hate playing by the rules i never have right i know and that's like

[25:58] i think it's i think in the end though it's been a it's been a win-win i mean they got me off for

[26:03] the most part i mean i haven't really been on there consistently and i'm not disrupting the site

[26:07] i mean if you were to say like over the last year is pinside a friendlier place without canada

[26:12] i think most people would be like no it hasn't really changed much and in fact it's probably more

[26:17] negative now i was a ton of drama when you were on there it went away but there's other individuals

[26:23] that have figured out a way to make the drama uh the other way so i mean so you don't think the

[26:28] purchase gonna happen you think this is just like i think no i think there will be a few certain

[26:33] individuals that will you know maybe a weak band um there might be a couple people that they

[26:40] may say audios too but i mean you really you know you really got to be pretty bad for them to

[26:45] throw you off pinside especially the way the lacks and the moderation i don't think there's a great

[26:50] purge coming i think what they're saying is hey we're gonna type in the ship up moderators have

[26:54] been told get involved quicker or sooner as soon as you can and uh you know and i think they're

[27:01] gonna police a little more right again in that whole purge thread i said something you know again

[27:08] i'm gonna go back to the example we were talking we were talking about j pop i'm calling you special

[27:12] k wolf marsh oh well you're offending people and this well when you do that in public on the message

[27:22] board that's taken as a personal attack doesn't mean it is but that's how the recipient takes it

[27:28] so the natural instinct is i have to reply to this now if wolf marsh had just pm means that hey dude

[27:37] you know uh you you might be offending people by calling him special k he would have gotten the same

[27:43] response in pm that i would have said that i said publicly i would have said just the same thing

[27:49] oh please don't start this shit and i would have said it in pm and it's just like you know leave i

[27:54] and pess punk all called me out well leave i uh you know you uh wouldn't act that way if you had

[28:00] somebody in your family that was uh special needs uh sorry leave i bullshit my dad's sister

[28:07] is in her 60s and has the equivalence of an eight year old she's been in my life my whole life

[28:13] she is medically retarded that is the medical term but you know what i think of all people i can

[28:19] determine whether it's you know offensive or not uh so i think if people have these wanted you know

[28:26] that's exactly example that is exactly what derailed that threat right then in there it could have

[28:32] just taken it to pm and i disagree and the same thing well i bet you wouldn't act that way if

[28:38] you were in a group of people and somebody came up to you and said hey you're being offensive uh

[28:43] bullshit if i was in a group of people and somebody came up to me and person and told me i was

[28:48] being offensive because i called somebody special k special k i'd probably time to go piss off a tree

[28:54] so no i'm put me behind a keyboard put me on your podcast put me face to face i'm the same person

[29:03] unfortunately that cannot be said for about 90% of the people on pinside well and i've said it

[29:10] they don't like to back what went jack and and i'd like that you're on the podcast and i think

[29:15] this is like indication that i'm the i'm the recipient of that arrow and i i didn't take

[29:22] offense to it and and i know the context of it i know where it's being said and i do agree the

[29:27] people that are are taking offense need to just lighten up and those people would not be fun at a

[29:32] party they wouldn't be fun to play pinball with you know you might leave i said to be uh oh you

[29:38] must be a a hell of a fun at a party uh dude you've never been to a party with me add alcohol

[29:45] instant idiot so right well i've had i've had it it's i think it's levy i think it's crazy levy

[29:50] and i've had it out with him over the last few days too because there's all this pressure for him

[29:53] to come play my magic girl because he's the authority on all things pinball um

[29:58] look at the re-sing on are you guys are you two on decent terms see you know what i'll i'll say like

[30:04] yeah like we're on decent terms we're not like like enemies or anything but but i'll say this like

[30:10] he he he like on one level he's always like slamming me and then he wants to come like into my

[30:16] home and it's like i'm i take some stuff personally and like i get it like i might have called the

[30:22] one-way gate a switch and i didn't realize that there can't be a switch attached to a one-way gate so

[30:27] that's cool but but if you insult me on a on a certain level you're not going to come into my

[30:32] home and also with some of these guys i've invited a lot of the new york scene to come over when i

[30:37] had Lord of the Rings i've invited a lot of them to come over when i had toadon and no one ever

[30:42] came over and now that i've magic girl everyone's like we need to come over and film it and document

[30:46] and it's like well kind of fair weather friends in a way you know so i don't really have an urge

[30:52] to let these guys step into the spotlight and and be the authority on magic or whether it works

[30:58] in that i think my videos are pretty honest assessment of the game and you're not going to hear

[31:02] anything different from any of the other owners who unbox them this week so the game is what it is

[31:07] and it doesn't matter if levy plays it or me okay good so that ends that speculation leave

[31:12] eyes not coming over okay done over with we don't need to discuss that anymore nor does it need to

[31:17] be discussed on the pizzi i mean look i i i said it to it's like i know deep down that he'd probably

[31:23] come over and say it plays like shit and i wasted my money you know i'm not an idiot right i know

[31:27] how people are gonna but like i honestly i don't think that he would do that i honestly believe

[31:34] he would come over and he would want he isn't gonna tell you you wasted your money uh you know

[31:39] again i've been one of your biggest supporters that you paid 20 grand for this um i think you took

[31:45] an excellent gamble and you know you get all the credit in the world for that because you put

[31:50] all the emotion aside you put all the j pop bullshit aside um you know it maybe there was a little

[31:58] bit well hey look at the you know the attention i'm gonna get if you bought this i don't know i don't

[32:03] know if i buy that after seeing all your videos i don't know if i buy that anymore it did bring you

[32:08] a lot of attention but you know what uh you didn't wait five or six years pounding your head

[32:14] against the wall did i pay 16 grand and i'm ever gonna get this thing it was pretty obvious six

[32:20] eight weeks ago when j pop uh changed his warranty wording to basically it's you a warranty you could

[32:27] wipe your ass with right that this thing was coming out so for you to jump in you took a chance

[32:36] i don't think you made a bad investment uh so you know kudos to you on that yeah it's been i went

[32:42] in in september and i went in when american pinball first showed the photos and it was a hundred

[32:48] percent gamble i bought the game with a non-refundable agreement with with the seller so it's basically

[32:54] like here's here's my money if the game doesn't come out i lose my money i basically bought the risk i

[33:00] bought i bought the person out and i'll say this when i went to expo and i heard them talk though like

[33:07] in brenda we'll tell you this i've had many it it it was very close to this never happening like

[33:12] john and when you see the game like i invite anyone who's in New York to come see it you know he didn't

[33:17] i don't know what the fuck he did like the last year like with american pinball he just sat there

[33:22] and played around the magnet for like a year because he didn't finish it he didn't have anyone

[33:28] i i i do believe that when a american pinball got involved with him and american pinball with the

[33:37] ones that came out and said hey magic girls are gonna be produced while they did not put these

[33:44] together they did not build these this was all j pop uh i do believe american pinball had a

[33:52] huge hand enforcing the situation here right and that's also the reason why you guys got delivered

[33:59] games that have code that belongs to who knows what you have mechanisms that don't work that don't

[34:06] seem to make any sort of sense because he put together the minimal machine with what he had

[34:14] and what he could without costing him an armoured leg more he took with what already had been

[34:20] created what had been coded okay this doesn't work so let's just take it out well this doesn't

[34:25] work but it looks good let's leave it in right net was the end result that's what you got right it

[34:32] was February 10th was his court date and if you it's if you look at his letter that the game is done

[34:37] it's it's it's titled February 6th so it was that February 10th court date that they were

[34:45] they were up against and as long as he could say that he sent a game out he could avoid

[34:50] uh the wrath of the judge on that on that when those depositions went up that he was completely

[34:55] bankrupt and then solve and then had him produce a single machine um but i'm i'm confident

[35:01] Jack when you look at the game i'm confident that the community will fix it i mean the issues with it

[35:06] aren't insurmountable uh they there's just a few things that need to happen and i think the game

[35:11] will be playing fine and and the game is it does it's fun i mean it's it's a it's it's the sound

[35:17] the the art the yeah the experience is incredible and it is a shame that j pop just isn't a creative

[35:23] director like at a stern or at jersey jack he should just be a creative director he shouldn't

[35:29] he should be designer slash creative director but he should not be in charge of ever making the

[35:33] physical thing real well the problem is from what now i'm in the Chicago area i you know this is

[35:39] the pinball capital the world i know people run here uh there's a mere fact i had customers uh when i

[35:46] when i was at a different bottom of uh shop that i was running i had customers a mind that worked with

[35:51] j pop um he's he's unmanageable uh nobody wants to work with the guy he's a loner uh so in a uh

[36:01] in an industrial or a corporate type world or or office type mommy wants to work with the guy you

[36:07] you know so he is a bit of a loner and then again i'll go one step further with j pop i don't

[36:13] know the guy personally i've met him uh you know when he had his kiss mock up at uh up at mgc i

[36:21] mean i was all over that thing because you know i'm a huge kiss fan i've done the custom kiss

[36:25] machines and all that stuff and i met him and i walked away going what a flake

[36:33] but there were people when when he started this whole process back in was a 2011-2012 take

[36:38] in the money for the machine i'm not gonna name any names but there's some big people in this

[36:43] business he had a hit up hey are you gonna buy one of my machines and they looked at him and told

[36:50] them john i wouldn't buy you know a pop one for assembly from you because you will never get it done

[36:58] they need them and this and i'm gonna go into

[37:03] there is some responsibility on the end of the buyers

[37:10] that's a great point you feel like they're taking it completely unknown

[37:15] so they threw money at j pop on games two and three when game one clearly had issues and

[37:21] i mean look you could say it's part greed it's chasing rarity whatever it was

[37:28] but i had a when i first had my phone conversation with john he spoke to me for two hours and i

[37:33] was like wait a minute why is this guy taking so much time if he's like busy building his machines

[37:37] and i came away from my first phone call with john same same feeling like this guy is just he

[37:43] talks in circles he talks in circles he is not efficient and i wouldn't give him ten bucks now i

[37:49] ended up having i always remain really friendly with john because just in case there was a chance

[37:54] that magic girl did come out and i'm a collector i wanted him to maybe let me have a chance to

[38:00] get anyone and even to the very end like i'm still friendly with john and but i only remain

[38:05] close to him in a way so he would let me just pick up the machine and we were the first ones to

[38:09] pick it up he called me the day was ready and and chris mcointick or wedding grabbed it but we

[38:13] got him out of there as fast as we could but what you know what is this how can you deliver it let

[38:18] people pick up machines and deliver and they have questions of their item and he won't talk to

[38:24] anybody now he won't even answer any of our phone calls now he would he it sucks pure douche bag move

[38:32] he it sucks and we went we went there with cash too and said hey we want to buy some spare parts

[38:38] and he won't sell us anything so you know it's like this this is it that's why i'm like really

[38:42] hasn't tend to flip the machine because of anything breaks if anything goes down you know god

[38:48] help the buyers getting any service on this day and he parts bullshit somebody somebody offers

[38:53] you enough money you're out of it what fun plots bullshit walks somebody offers you enough money

[38:58] you're out of it well i mean it look it would take a lot i mean i would it would take north

[39:01] of thirty thousand there you go you just admit but no one's but no one right dollar amount came

[39:05] along you get rid of it i mean i it would take at least ten grand more than i spent yes everything's

[39:11] for sale i tell people all the time like every you you get that thing working and that things

[39:17] plays like it should and what is it apple juice uh uh uh yeah apple juice he gets this thing

[39:22] coated so everything works right you get your guys in there that you know especially the the magnum

[39:27] play working right get the magnets you get this thing working right uh i think you'd be nuts

[39:33] to sell pretend grand over what you paid it'll be worth like fifty grand if there's only twenty five

[39:38] of them in the world it'll be worth you all the boo hoors well how can you say that when j pop

[39:44] oz zombie getty any of those apple juice it doesn't matter what he owes reality does not you know

[39:52] interfere with what the past actions were it's here now today what is somebody willing to plunk

[39:59] down for this game you've already set the early benchmark you already set it at twenty grand

[40:05] everybody called your nuts they called you you know narcissistic wow i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll

[40:11] it's i pay twenty three grand okay so now the okay again that world the world exclusive with jack

[40:18] today twenty three grand i basically if if if Kim wants to come on pin side and say i mean if

[40:25] that's what you're saying and if Kim wants to come on pin side and just say yes that's the dollar

[40:31] okay then the benchmark has now been set at twenty three thousand done yeah i mean it like i don't

[40:38] think he'll you know i mean it is what it is i mean i think he's happy i think i'm happy i think

[40:43] you know twenty three for where the game is at now to your point if it gets fixed it'll be worth

[40:49] even more i just don't see them going down and value because just as a work of art a piece of

[40:54] pimple history in the rarity yeah i've said it before there's there's thousands of batman's and

[40:58] ghostbusters and acd's and trams and you know the experience of playing a magic girl you physically

[41:04] have to be in one of twenty five spots on planet earth and they won't make more and raza's not

[41:10] coming out i knew that you know he's like these ra the raaza dreamers i feel bad for him but

[41:14] it's just not happening like it's that that also the one or land and raaza the this is now that he's

[41:19] delivered these games this is all going to court at this point yeah if raaza and also wonderland are

[41:25] ever made they will not be made by zid where they will not be made by j pop it'll be by somebody else

[41:32] who maybe comes in and buys the assets who have tried you know because if this all goes into bankruptcy

[41:38] there could be a liquidation sale of what's left right yeah they'll never recess the games like

[41:43] as wise snow is trying to do yeah we'll read this as maybe it's talking about how they're going to

[41:47] repossess the games they have no clue what they're talking about people who got their games got what

[41:54] they paid for these none of these were under the tape here i could go just like kevin sale of predator

[41:59] to his body that was under the table sale that was completely to undermine what was going on right

[42:07] these were sales that were advertised that were paid for trust me if you got your magic girl it's

[42:13] yours there's no court in the world going to make a single person give those back just ain't going

[42:19] to happen and furthermore and i'm going to go on this you know everybody about apple juice bub zambi

[42:24] yeti we all know what a quack j pop is from the people we know the people we talk to the people who

[42:32] work with them held the people who sent them money the receipts they got nothing was professional

[42:39] and if you did work for j pop after you knew hey you want to do this as an apprentice you want to

[42:46] do this for the good of pinball you knew right then in there he didn't want to pay anybody

[42:53] so if you're going to go in and make a deal well i'm going to come in and do programming and i'm

[42:57] going to trade for a machine okay you get a magic girl so i'm be ready i'm going to come in and do

[43:03] your art i get it you get a machine okay great if it's not in writing the only thing you can do

[43:10] is basically wipe your ass without me toilet paper because that's what you got what i don't get

[43:15] and i'm friends with Jeremy and he's a great guy and i want to go right back on that real quick

[43:22] but if j pop did promise these guys a machine for what they did zambi yeti apple apple juice sauce

[43:31] whatever apple juice their old machines and it's a complete bullshit move on j pops that he's

[43:38] got enough to build 25 machines you know what build those two or three more send them off to those

[43:44] guys right take good take care of your court battles but here's here so here's the thing

[43:52] and i agree they deserve machines and anyone who entered a contract with john without stuff

[43:56] in writing was was kind of foolish everyone had stars in their eyes a little bit you know apple juice

[44:02] says that he's owed 11k and a machine and he has been writing the but the question i have for

[44:06] like apple juice because i had it's writing then he's that you know what i you know what if he does

[44:12] then why didn't he like here's here's my issue with both of their cases nobody went to american

[44:17] pinball back in september when they showed the photos and asked for anything they and scott goberg

[44:25] who i am friends with who i've built a relationship with what they would have worked with them and

[44:31] these guys totally see there was a lot of people that were a lot of people but nobody but nobody went

[44:37] to the contact of american pinball there were you know that were owed a machine though or just

[44:44] get worth of course i know for fact that those two didn't you know like i i don't know where the

[44:52] extra machines went here's the thing too and this is the part that people don't want to like focus on

[44:57] is that american pinball sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars into this project to get it done it

[45:01] doesn't make any sense it will never make sense it's a logical move when you look at the way it

[45:04] ended so they probably took some of those extra machines you know there's 19 owners and there

[45:10] so there seems to be like six extra machines there was a couple prototypes that went out

[45:15] if you if anybody believes for a minute that john doesn't have

[45:19] there are 25 playfields made we know that we know that for a fact he's he built these things

[45:26] if anybody doesn't think he doesn't have enough to build three or four more machines they're nuts

[45:30] because whenever you build something you always order more of everything it's just it's just like big

[45:36] bang bar they the hundred and the extra machines that they built off of spare parts right

[45:41] it's gene new to get all these extra parts and guess what so i think there's enough for three or four

[45:47] more magic girls now maybe john secretly going to build these and secretly let you know

[45:54] offer them at highest price if he did that's another douchebag mood and that would get his ass

[46:00] in the sling and in the court absolutely well what he did was i think he reached out to both

[46:07] Jim who's the coder and zombie Yeti when he joined up with american pinball and both of them

[46:13] you know probably rightfully so we're like dude like screw this like it's been so long i'm not

[46:17] gonna get involved anymore and i think john just like personally is just sliding them he's just

[46:23] saying like fuck you for not helping me out at the eleventh hour and i think they made the right

[46:27] decision uh... but you know look if you have it in writing if apple juice has a contract where he's

[46:32] owed a machine then work with the court systems and it's it's a bitch to sue from overseas when

[46:38] you're trying to get john you know Steve marshes john's lawyer has them in such a protective bubble

[46:43] it's not even funny it's but that's that's what a lawyer does yeah because the truth is none of us

[46:51] none of us know exactly what jpops financial position is none of us know exactly what he did with

[46:58] the money it's all pure speculation all it is now again he's a the guy is a complete asshole

[47:07] i'm sorry but there's no other way to put it he tried he fucked up and then he goes and he puts off

[47:15] you know raza allyson wonderland starts selling those machines knowing damn well he couldn't build

[47:22] magic girl and then when he's in trouble and zidware's in solvent he's still taking deposits

[47:31] right he do exactly what he was doing exactly so now that now that the magic girl is over with

[47:39] i don't know if anybody's gonna really have much recourse on him uh he did deliver a product

[47:46] uh it does work um you know the problem is is he never showed anybody a finished product all

[47:54] he did was prototypes built it put it together and sent it out so there i don't know how much legal

[48:01] ground anybody is gonna have to say well this isn't what you promised me because all we saw were

[48:07] prototypes it's not like he put out a finished product said okay world common spec this we saw

[48:13] this machine and then he sent out something different so you know it's a lot of great area here

[48:20] his what's interesting is the feature list on the game versus the reality of the game and it's

[48:26] like none of it is in there i mean you could go to court and say i paid sixteen grand and

[48:32] and here's the feature list that is on the website and here the feature the feature list on the

[48:37] website okay yeah he put it up and it's you know it's not nothing's there like none of the stuff is

[48:43] in the game and so you are still you are still exploring this game there are three levels there's

[48:49] what there's novice there's arcade and right what's wizard and wizard is the third and wizard i

[48:55] talked to john wizard mode is currently locked so but i heard here's what wizard mode is and i got

[49:00] some information on it wizard mode is a is one ball game you get one ball and it's just that's

[49:07] like you know for an expert who who only wants to pin ho it's it's a higher difficulty level that's

[49:13] all really it's like a one ball it's like a one ball tournament mode right you get one life you

[49:17] get one life in this in this game don't know does it does that wizard mode unlock any more features

[49:22] because it's a one ball i'll say this the the the coil that shoots the ball up

[49:29] uh... through the middle playfield will reach the top mechanism so i didn't you know yeah it works

[49:36] you know here's the you know like even if that magnets on though that balls traveling at a really

[49:40] strong uh... velocity i i i don't know if like the magnet would be able to like stop it like just

[49:47] i feel like john just played around these fucking things like these mechs for years and clearly

[49:54] he couldn't even like put in like two magnet locks on the ramps like

[49:59] well the other point is he may have just run out of time

[50:02] yeah but it's like it's no defense but it looks like according to because of the court documents

[50:08] the he ran out of time but it's a crazy that's a crazy part is like so the question becomes is

[50:16] does did he get it working but ran out of time to put it in or did he just never even get it

[50:20] working you know and we'll never know we'll never know like from this point on someone will make

[50:25] it work you know when i read uh... apple juices he put together like everything he coded i feel bad

[50:31] for the dude because he could it like an illusion that's what i've been telling people like he

[50:34] coded against the spec sheet that wasn't real like he he was like he's telling me the ball goes up

[50:40] the the the left ramp and gets diverted into the magnet flibary when you spell power there is no

[50:47] there's no way for the ball to go up the ramp and divert into the magnet flibary it's just

[50:51] it there's no there's no passageway so john's physical game isn't aligned with what this guy even

[50:57] coded and you know it's just like i don't even know what he coded for two years i do know that he was

[51:02] he was pretty he's owed eleven grand but what i keep hearing from people's he was handsomely paid

[51:07] though to like he he got i heard like seventy eighty thousand dollars to do what he did so it's like

[51:15] you know i don't know he hasn't disclosed and i again like this could be i can be off

[51:20] don't know it's all speculated right there are people here in the Chicago area that do

[51:26] that do mods and do parts and stuff that did get paid by j pop yeah they did and they are owed

[51:34] nothing it just like your guest on a couple of podcasts ago who did did the artwork for the cabinet

[51:41] he got paid he got paid and and also like i believe that like pentasia paid out to a bunch of

[51:48] people that were also owed money as well and that's why when bill got his machines you know it's

[51:54] it's clear that he bill bill's the only one you protected his money by getting the ip it bills

[51:59] a smart guy i i love bill like when i talk to him you know he's like he would never enter a business

[52:04] agreement with someone with just a handshake and and a verbal agreement i mean he he got the

[52:09] ip he basically bought like a million and a half dollars with the ip for whatever he paid which

[52:13] wasn't nearly that but the bottom line is he ended up walking away well he basically you know

[52:19] i think what it came down to was you know you you you look at the situation you're you basically

[52:24] say all right well we could force them in the bankruptcy then divvy up the assets if the games

[52:31] aren't finished it would have just been a mess i mean i i think he did the right thing like let

[52:35] me just take what i can get let me get out of this and let me move on i mean it the the next step

[52:42] with the zid where now is going to be years of of legal bullshit for people to get off that it's

[52:47] all going to be tied up in courts and i feel i feel very bad for people who put money on raza and

[52:53] males in wonderland because the lawyers the courts is probably going to eat up what's left and

[53:01] they're all going to be standing out in the cold and he just like all these people with predator you

[53:06] know with predator you know i'm not going to keep the lawyers going to the only one who makes

[53:12] any money on it i mean i i'm glad kevin is going to get dragged over the calls but oh yeah he's

[53:18] got nothing now the guys like great they're going to sell his moms RV and they're going to

[53:23] liquidate whatever little assets he has and every moms RV he bought that with predator money i

[53:28] know i know it's quite i and just to go on on that look that should have been a red flag this you

[53:35] know i played predator and x ball kevin he goes what do you think in a game i just look and said

[53:43] i don't like it now i said i'm not a customer but at the here you have jpop who is doing

[53:51] boutique pinballs and wants to sell you a machine for sixteen thousand dollars this is back in

[53:56] the in twenty eleven twenty twelve here comes kevin with a fully featured pinball machine that wants

[54:03] to sell for forty five hundred dollars come on red flags all over the point and a theme and a theme

[54:11] with Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness on it that the whole thing from day one was did you know i

[54:18] will say this i i am going to say this jpop never pop a duke never set out to start this

[54:27] and screw people over his intention was always to design this was his grand illusion he was going

[54:34] to design these machines he was going to produce these machines and in his mind he was going to be

[54:41] the greatest pinball producer designer that everybody's going to talk about right this was all

[54:49] prestige and glory for him in his mind remind you of anybody anyway number two kevin always

[55:00] always intention was going to build a pinball machine and deliver he kevin was never going to

[55:08] screw the people over what he did though was there was never a license that is obvious and he

[55:17] figured he was going to build these machines and under the radar deliver two hundred and fifty

[55:23] machines you don't order all these parts you don't have back alley making your parts for your

[55:29] machine if you're not planning on delivering them you don't have all the you don't have all these

[55:34] pinball accoutrements did not build a machine right he was intending on it now or anybody who points

[55:43] the finger at these people that went to fox to dig and find out the truth if anybody points the

[55:51] finger at them for being the reason that the prior machines didn't get delivered you're an idiot

[55:58] these people went and just wanted to see what the hell was going on with their money and found out

[56:05] that there was no license never was a license kevin got caught right handed he basically said

[56:13] fuck it and the money went everywhere else that guy screwed everybody over right same thing the

[56:20] argument that you got pinball and everybody else these people never intended to screw anybody over

[56:26] they always intended for everybody get their machines they just got their underwater because they're

[56:33] over their heads so jack you bring up a good point because i've said it many times on this

[56:38] podcast is that the boutique pinball promise has really sucked the life out of the hobby for many

[56:43] people and i and it continues to you have spooky well there's spooky and stern are really the

[56:51] i always says the only two that do it right where they design a game fully they know how much it

[56:56] costs to make the game first then they price and announce it and then they make it there

[57:02] the everyone else does it backwards they like they announced their machine they show it they don't

[57:07] know the bomb yet they and before they know it they've priced themselves out of business on day one

[57:13] look if if dutch pinball were to go back to all the buyers and say look you know our

[57:18] manufacturers telling us that it's more expensive to make this complex game than they originally

[57:23] thought and each game has to go up by a thousand dollars people would be fine with that instead

[57:30] they're now they're like it's like pride mixed with ego mixed with being ashamed that they

[57:36] can't afford to pay the manufacturer what it costs to make and now it's just frozen like 50 games

[57:43] or built that ship out that is a complete he sends she sent shit show right now it's a shitshow and

[57:49] it could last for it could last for a year you know that's why I feel bad about rare heroes machine

[57:53] just being stuck over there it's like this could go on for a really long time and why would it

[57:59] you know what also I don't like about the pinball hobby though is everyone expects like well stern

[58:04] or spooky could just build dutch's games for like bullshit these are competitors like like

[58:11] fords not going to go build hell cats if dodge goes bankrupt you know it's like these people

[58:16] what are what aren't they going to build hell cats but you know I'm saying like people

[58:23] like people in the background laughing at that one right people people act like that all pinball

[58:30] is sacred and it needs to come out bullshit stern is in business to put other people out of

[58:34] business like they are not here to hold arms with Andrew highway and like just give the world

[58:40] more pinball um you know stern royally fucked over highway by by keeping sargoni weaver off of

[58:45] alien like that was totally stern's move she was in on the zen zen pinball's game she was on

[58:52] ghost busters why isn't she in on the on stern's competitor machine right so look these I think a

[58:59] year from now you're only going to see three manufacturers jjp spooky and stern everyone else

[59:06] I think it's going to be gone that's if jjp doesn't run out of money again right and they have

[59:10] the huge investment now I know I know I know I look people don't realize the reason why hobbit

[59:16] took two years no one it's like people won't admit it he was broke he's millions and he's there

[59:21] millions in the whole like every because because of this he underpriced his game with remember wizard

[59:28] of odds he also has a habit of screwing over there and I'm going to say it if anybody doesn't like

[59:34] it too bad jjp has a habit of screwing over their vendors making promises they can't keep

[59:41] not paying timely invoices yeah you got problems when you run a business like that look I've been

[59:48] I've been criticized of being like harsh on highway pinball and this so I've said it like what

[59:53] happened to highway pinball is that a lot of andrews ex employees came knocking on my door

[59:59] and can't and came and they shared all this information like like sharing specific documents

[01:00:05] of the troubles of highway pinball and pardon me was like well I don't really want to report it I

[01:00:09] asked Andrew to come on the show he would but you get no points forever whistle blowing when

[01:00:14] a company's in trouble on this hobby and and that's why I'm just like my new stances it's your own

[01:00:19] risk like everyone who goes into a boutique company your money is a game it's you're gambling with

[01:00:25] your money and unless it's stirner spooky uh and maybe jjp right I think your money could be tied

[01:00:33] up for years and you might never get a machine and that's on you the buyer needs to start taking

[01:00:37] responsibility when you see andrew highways videos of his factory the games are not on the assembly

[01:00:42] line there's no one in the factory he's got this huge factory he's on his third factory because

[01:00:48] you know what they told me he's not paying rent for the other two like why would his employees make

[01:00:52] that up and tell me this stuff but if I share it on the bad guy you know if I share it on

[01:00:57] Pinside it you you have to be you know you do have to be careful with that because yeah uh if you

[01:01:02] have a scorned and then pull a scorned employee listen I own my own business I opened my own

[01:01:09] business in April of last year and I started with her one crew and 90 days later I had complete

[01:01:17] turnover and you know what a scorned employee doesn't matter if it's fat or bullshit will go

[01:01:22] around and spread some of the most incomplete incomprehensible bullshit and people will believe it

[01:01:31] right see you do have to be careful when you're talking with an ex-employee who's put and I'm

[01:01:37] care what businesses pinball all those cars help and you're making pencil sharpeners and the guy

[01:01:43] is pissed off while they're selling inferior razor blades on the pencil sharpeners you've got to

[01:01:48] take it with a grain of salt when when it's a you know it's an ex-employee that's why you know

[01:01:55] not all whistleblowers are taken to court because they're doing more blowing than they are

[01:01:59] whistling but there's there there is public info and and and there they're you know there's there's

[01:02:04] court transcripts of people suing because they weren't paid wages at highway and all this stuff and

[01:02:09] you know it's it's like I do I think aliens gonna ship I do I but I do think highway

[01:02:15] financially will never climb out of the hole because you can't go years in the red and

[01:02:22] and how do you make it up like Ben Hick and I just talked about this I put a I put his podcast up

[01:02:26] yesterday if you take a big hit it takes a while to come out at hole um but you know spooky

[01:02:34] was smart they they they they they built their business one step at a time they didn't build big

[01:02:40] factories they didn't buy heavy machinery they didn't they didn't invest in everything and then

[01:02:44] their first title like bomb they build it slowly right and they 150 for the first game 300 for

[01:02:51] the second now they're up to 500 now they're contract manufacturing other games for people

[01:02:56] um I just don't know how you make up the losses on the alien development

[01:03:01] well there's yourself 5000 games there is only one thing you can do and that is a manufacturer

[01:03:07] or a business person you have to raise the price you have to read the street price has to go up

[01:03:14] but then you're at a point of okay how much of a price increase is the paying public or the

[01:03:23] collector or the you know your route guy going to pay for that product and now I'm going to

[01:03:30] write over to Stern Stern the prices keep going up the quality is going down the features the

[01:03:40] pinball accruterments in the machines are going down and you're paying five six thousand dollars

[01:03:47] for a pro that is a stripped down machine and I mean seriously you pay fifteen thousand dollars

[01:03:57] for these these Batman L.E.'s is that not a risk paying fifteen grand for one of those I mean

[01:04:05] I mean the value is not there see what Stern has done successfully and as a marketer I kind of

[01:04:11] laughed when I saw the the super L.E. announcement I laughed when I saw how quickly they sold out

[01:04:16] because what they've shown is that the ceiling for where these collectors will go is they didn't

[01:04:23] even reach it with fifteen thousand and they put and they put five dollar toys in the machine

[01:04:28] and all of a sudden they're getting fifteen thousand for it I mean they they sold more they made more

[01:04:34] money in one day than J. Potman in five years and they did nothing they re-skinned an old game

[01:04:43] they put an old mech in it that rotating mech is not new wasn't designed just for Batman and they've

[01:04:48] had that before um it's a re-themed I mean and and they're laughing all the way to the bank as these

[01:04:54] other companies I don't think they're laughing all the way to the bank they are a business

[01:04:59] well but they've got to realize it was going to be twelve K the S.S.S. and they're just like let's

[01:05:03] just charge fifteen they could have charged seventeen Jack and they were just sold out you know

[01:05:06] I'm saying like but this is coming from a company whose president of the company Gary Stern which is

[01:05:13] you know a face of the company in in more terms now stood at a podium three four years ago

[01:05:20] fifth pounding on that podium the home market collector is not our focus well if the home market

[01:05:28] collector isn't your focus now because that's where you're making your biggest profits

[01:05:33] Mr. Stern your full of shit yeah he lies about that he lies about half the games going overseas

[01:05:39] because that creates more scarcity and people you know creates hype to get them like there's no

[01:05:43] way 250 Ghostbusters went overseas um he does it he's he's he's see Gary understands how to drive

[01:05:51] the hype and they can create that hype because they actually make machines and they also know that

[01:05:57] they can release a product when it's not nearly done like Batman code is there there's the problem

[01:06:03] right there how far is this going to go everybody on Pinside well you know vote with your wallet well

[01:06:10] of course but that's only the guy buying the pro model to put out on the street could give two

[01:06:18] licks if it's got finished code or not all he cares about is is a dollar being put into that slot

[01:06:26] and how many more dollars each customer is going to put into that slot and how quickly

[01:06:31] is that machine going to make a return on that investment and how quickly can we turn the red

[01:06:37] into black that's all your street vendor care that's all your operators care about

[01:06:43] but the opposite side of the coin is is now that you have premiums now that you have L.E.s now

[01:06:49] that you have super L.E.s now we're going to have super duper L.E.s that they add a couple more

[01:06:55] five dollar toys on to but the support from Stern has gone down the quality has definitely gone down

[01:07:08] and this bullshit of look you want to forget about pros the hell with it that's fine put it

[01:07:15] on the street that's your game but to these people who are buying the high end stuff and if you're

[01:07:21] going to cater to the people with the high end stuff coding is important to them because when

[01:07:30] you sell somebody a machine and I'm going to use my you know my kiss L.E. as an example when it has

[01:07:37] I pay eight thousand dollars for a machine and it has features that are inoperable well hey sounds

[01:07:45] a lot like J.P. and you take six months 12 months 18 months two years we're almost on two years

[01:07:55] with these kiss machines now and they're still not finished hey they are a great playing game go

[01:08:02] out the street play one pump your dollars into it it's a great playing game but to the guy who

[01:08:07] spent the big money on these machines those are important and now that Stern has turned the

[01:08:15] corner and it's obvious they can you know Gary can say whatever he wants but they are now catering

[01:08:21] to the home market to the collector because those are the machines that are making their bottom line

[01:08:28] those are the machines that allow them to go as you say laugh all the way to the bank

[01:08:32] it's only going to go so far so far until you start picking up the pace on the back end again you can't

[01:08:42] an automobile manufacturer cannot sell you a car with heated side view mirrors and you have to

[01:08:50] wait two years for those side view mirrors to work because they haven't updated the car yet right

[01:08:56] I think Stern's issue they make I always feel like they make too many games and they don't

[01:09:01] and they're on to the next they're on to the next they're on to the next just to keep the line moving

[01:09:06] but they really have no competition and it's this weird environment where that is exactly it they

[01:09:11] have no competition right and until they really have to worry you know I mean they can just keep

[01:09:17] doing what they're doing and they keep doing and and as much as people say like they're going to

[01:09:21] vote with their wallet people want new stuff and they're the only option so I think it's going

[01:09:26] to be interesting this I think Batman was a little bit of anomaly they rushed it out because of

[01:09:31] the anniversary they wanted to hit that date the code is like still spartan on that machine but

[01:09:36] Ghostbusters released with pretty final code and I'm I'm expecting the same from Aerosmith and I

[01:09:41] expect Star Wars to be finished when released as well so let's see what Stern does with the next

[01:09:48] few titles because I do think that and and kiss is just I I don't get it like why they just don't

[01:09:54] finish the machine they they know they know that everyone has been waiting and waiting and waiting

[01:10:00] and they and they like they like teased it like in a jerky way too remember when they were like

[01:10:03] putting up Facebook post about it and it's like well it's not funny you know I take lights on

[01:10:08] the back burner because the pro models that are on the streets are earning the operators who

[01:10:17] bought these machines are perfectly happy the kiss is one of the biggest earners out on the street

[01:10:23] but in the collector circle they're the premiums and the LE's you know me being the big kiss fan

[01:10:30] I predicted that kiss would outsell the ACDC machine that was me I admit it boy was I wrong

[01:10:37] but in the collector circle the the LE in the premium are a flop and I'll tell you what for what

[01:10:44] I paid for the premium and what I got compare or from sorry what I paid for the LE and what I got

[01:10:52] compared to the premium I'll never buy another premium or LE again you know I'm this machine

[01:11:00] supposed to have a real backlash I took this backlash out it's a piece of glass with sticker on it

[01:11:10] that is not a real back yeah it's not a screen printed backlash so what in the hell did I pay for

[01:11:19] because really on the play field there really isn't anything different on the LE versus the premium

[01:11:26] oh boy I got us I got a plaque on it that says I've got number five whatever number I've got

[01:11:31] oh mr stern himself signed it for me um boy I guess it was really worth that extra oh well

[01:11:38] I got some red side armor too I guess but I guess that was really worth the extra 15 I mean I was

[01:11:44] shocked that Batman that Batman super Ellie didn't have like a mech or something that was just

[01:11:51] or you know a code or a mode that was unique to the game itself and it

[01:11:56] you know the super the super Ellie when that thing was not for the super Ellie for the buyers

[01:12:02] of the super Ellie that thing that game when it's in a track mode should be showing full episodes

[01:12:08] of the old Batman show I mean seriously you're gonna pay that kind of money there's gotta be

[01:12:14] something super it doesn't it doesn't even have the Adam West call out yet but all the owners

[01:12:19] told they were gonna get that they turn the machine on and Adam West would greet you personally

[01:12:24] um so so Jack let me ask you um we're sort of up on the hour let's we'll wrap it up in a little

[01:12:31] bit but wait what what what do you have in your collection now and are you looking forward to

[01:12:35] anything coming out down the road that has your eye no there's actually nothing that I look forward

[01:12:40] to I'm looking forward to right now um yeah there's nothing catching my my my collection right now

[01:12:49] I have a kiss Ellie recently sold off my Tron Pro just I Tron was one of my favorite movies of all time

[01:12:58] but the pinball machine didn't do it for me uh let's see what do I got in my basement I've got the

[01:13:04] kiss Ellie I've got a a Apollo 13 that's my wife's machine she loves it and she got me to love it

[01:13:13] I got a got leap stargate yes Levi I'm a got leap man uh let's see what else I got got my black

[01:13:21] hole downstairs uh I've got a few projects in the garage I've always got a couple of 79 kiss

[01:13:28] machines laying around in some sort of state which I'm actually doing another custom machine on

[01:13:34] at my shop right now my automotive shop in the free play I've got a NASCAR I've got a Mario

[01:13:41] and Dready yes another got leap machine and I love that Mario and Dready because it's dialed in

[01:13:45] right and I've got a uh a Viper night driving uh which I just picked up and I tell you what uh

[01:13:54] the Viper as much as everybody hates that game I think that's a cool game and you know what for

[01:14:01] us yeah for a machine to be on free play in an automotive shop perfect game yeah perfect right

[01:14:07] uh but yeah I don't see there's nothing really out there that I'm really looking forward

[01:14:14] although I take that back um if the money if I can make it happen I actually love dialed in

[01:14:21] it's an amazing game the new the recent videos I saw this week the game I really want to dial

[01:14:27] in I've already like if there's one machine I would put in place of magic girl just uh dialed

[01:14:34] in its phenomenal people are gonna we walked in and I expo when everybody did the uh the

[01:14:40] mass exodus on Friday night to take the buses to that lay mass stern party it was a ghost town

[01:14:47] my wife and I walked in and went to three empty dialed in machines so we played the hell out of

[01:14:53] them and I really really walked away uh impressed with it because the the reveal was a complete

[01:15:01] dud um they need to hire me they need to hire a marketer they need to learn how to public speak and

[01:15:08] also how to do power pointed I'm sorry when when you hand somebody a microphone and yes this is

[01:15:16] our machine well right no inflection on the voice no tone no no thank you when you're when

[01:15:23] you're not happy about your own creation it it it people can't get excited oh no no but you go play

[01:15:28] the machine you know all everything aside the reveal the name you don't like the name you don't play

[01:15:34] the name you play the machine the that machine speaks for itself I think it's a great machine

[01:15:41] and then we went we went to level 257 that's actually got this machine on you know on the floor

[01:15:48] taken money and I'll tell you what it's holding up the machine is holding up well but we've

[01:15:54] been back twice now to play this in my opinion every time I play it just goes higher and higher

[01:16:02] uh whereas the habit I think is a horrible game right it's aesthetically beautiful but it's uh to

[01:16:09] me it's like it's playing it's like playing a wide body with nothing it's slow uh it's a wide

[01:16:15] body EM with a with a fishtail ramp that's all hobbit it's really good yeah if the hobbit

[01:16:20] doesn't do it for me Wizard of War love it or now Wizard of War Wizard of Oz you know and I take

[01:16:27] that back there is there is a stern machine that will probably be the next one in my basement

[01:16:33] and that's that is actually a ghost busters premium um once they get everything you know

[01:16:41] cleared up with the play field issues and all that stuff but but again we all have to remember

[01:16:46] these play field issues you know that was just a that was just a shit job by the manufacturer who

[01:16:53] put those play fields together for them right there there's just no reason in the world I can

[01:16:59] you know the ghosting with the inserts that's fine there's so many there's ghosting in every almost

[01:17:06] every game commercial machine you're not gonna have perfection but the fact that the clear coat

[01:17:11] in the shooter lanes and in some areas is just plain old coming up chipping off that's a defect

[01:17:18] and if anybody has an issue with these let me tell you uh I think the ultimate slap in the face

[01:17:27] I've ever seen was uh who is the one that got sent the sandpaper yeah the the nail polish and some

[01:17:35] instructions if that isn't a slap in the face by stern and if that isn't the biggest fuck you

[01:17:44] you paid for the machine here live with this or else I know what was and to me that was just

[01:17:51] here you're in marketing uh would you advise any of your clients to ever do you have to a customer

[01:17:58] no and and I think what would what really upset me about the play field situation with stern is

[01:18:05] I get that they're the person manufacturing the play field wasn't stern and stern is building

[01:18:10] their own play field manufacturing capability but when they knew they had a defect they still sent

[01:18:16] the product to customers they knew they they it was like and now I had a big issue with that and

[01:18:22] and and and and they're still like delaying people getting their replacement play fields and

[01:18:27] and I was just there's like that guy on Pimside who's like tearing down his ghost blusters to redo

[01:18:32] it himself it's just like I hate seeing stuff like that um it's not right but wait a sec

[01:18:39] as you stated we have a company stern that's laughing all the way to the bench

[01:18:44] but where is that bank to fix these ghost blusters machine I you know

[01:18:50] right you know this industry it's funny uh you know this is you know in my opinion the heyday of pinball

[01:18:58] was that was the transfer from EM over to solid state machines you know when you had

[01:19:05] many of you know bali was putting out 20,000 kiss machines 20,000 uh playboy machines

[01:19:12] to me that was the heyday that was I think the greatest uh the greatest era of pinball was when

[01:19:20] that solid state was introduced and then your second era was that you know when twilight's

[01:19:28] zone started hitting and Adams family that was back when you know got lead again sorry Levi

[01:19:36] but got lead was putting their system threes are pretty bulletproof machines and if you give some

[01:19:42] of those machines a chance uh stargate uh water world big hurt if you throw away the horrible

[01:19:51] callouts on some of these games those are actually some pretty damn fun games and they can be

[01:19:57] had a lot of those can be had at a bargain still so you know I don't just out system three

[01:20:05] got lead games I think they're I think they are absolutely part of that renaissance that that

[01:20:10] second renaissance and pinball that happened and I think they're a big part of it they're gone you

[01:20:15] know whatever uh so but those those those got balis that were being put out in the or 70s and

[01:20:24] 80s damn those things were workhorses they were quality machines they took a lick you know they

[01:20:31] were like a tonics take a lick and keep on taking and guy you know you can throw these things in

[01:20:37] a warehouse for 10 to 15 years and as long as if there was no battery or acid damage on those boards

[01:20:44] those things would fire right up and still play yeah the switches were probably sticking and stuff

[01:20:50] these modern machines you you can't now you know maybe with the sand system you can't but

[01:20:58] certainly not with the white star and certainly you know so I mean yeah well look look with the

[01:21:05] prices going where they're at I think people will demand a higher quality product eventually

[01:21:10] and look Stern Stern is Stern cuts corners Stern is getting cheaper and cheaper with decals with

[01:21:16] translates everything is like and I think they're going to you know that that looks gonna run out

[01:21:22] a little bit if they keep doing this um but until they have competition yeah you know

[01:21:27] they can go on for years until Jersey Jack or whoever is now gonna throw their hat in the ring

[01:21:34] until there is somebody else that can produce two to three games a year that's going to be a direct

[01:21:39] competition with Stern they are going to continue to thumb their nose as long as people are

[01:21:45] opening up their wards as long as people are plonking down the American express cards

[01:21:50] as long as their vendors they put out 300 LEs or 600 LEs and they're sold out in minutes

[01:21:58] they are going to continue on the path that they are on right now until that stops and it only

[01:22:05] really needs to be I believe one new game a year is enough to make Stern uh feel the heat and

[01:22:13] because everyone else it's like it's like Jersey Jack like one game every three to four years it's not

[01:22:17] going to cut it like they need to get dialed in and I think they're going to show what pirate

[01:22:23] to the Caribbean and Expo but and then toy story after that but you know I'm it's like just make

[01:22:28] them already like we Jack needs to have at least you know a couple games new a year because

[01:22:34] I get nervous when I see them all in on dialed and even it's a great game but like is it going

[01:22:39] to sell at that price with that theme uh enough of them to wait me sometimes it's the same thing

[01:22:46] you do have to go all in with a product if you don't have the wherewithal to build that next product

[01:22:53] right but it just seems crazy to me that toy story would be just the gangbusters title I guess

[01:22:59] they're probably gonna they're gonna make it based on the I think there's a fourth film coming out

[01:23:03] so I think that's what they're timing it with um but when that happens I mean that's gonna be

[01:23:09] Jack's Star Wars I mean that theme is as big um and is it transcends generations and families

[01:23:16] and and it has something for everybody um well Jack I really appreciate you taking the time

[01:23:21] is there are there any questions you did when asked from some of the people with PM or

[01:23:24] should we just no should we because the the people who sent me questions were a bunch of smart

[01:23:30] asses all right you know I think you look here ask can you know why he's such a dick well you know
