[00:00] We call it a trap.

[00:09] I can't walk out.

[00:14] We call it a love it too much, baby.

[00:25] Welcome to Episode 235 of Candidus Pimbal Podcast.

[00:30] It's Friday morning, New York City, and you might have noticed that Episode 234, this

[00:36] podcast has disappeared.

[00:38] And I want to explain why.

[00:40] And I want to just talk about on this episode just a level set that I think we all have to

[00:46] do.

[00:47] I think if you've been reading Pinside lately and you've been following this podcast lately,

[00:53] there's a lot of dramatic stuff going on in the Pimbal world.

[00:55] A lot of stuff is coming to an end.

[00:59] A lot of emotions are running high.

[01:01] And the drama meter is through the roof right now.

[01:04] And I think all of us need to sort of just take a chill pill, relax, step back, and realize

[01:09] that everything we're getting so bent at a shape about is Pimbal related.

[01:14] Now that doesn't mean I'm not excusing some of the really serious issues that I've gone

[01:19] on with people losing money and getting robbed by certain individuals.

[01:22] And I want to talk about that on this episode of Pimbal Podcast.

[01:26] I also want to talk about just sort of like the overarching mentality that is going on

[01:33] on the forums right now.

[01:34] I want to read some of your emails.

[01:37] And then I want to implore all of you to just go have fun this week and sink with

[01:41] a my own.

[01:42] And then this May 4th, this Star Wars day, and just enjoy the time you have on this planet

[01:47] and don't get to Pimbal crazy.

[01:49] So here's why the episode is down.

[01:52] I had a lot of stuff going on in my personal life yesterday.

[01:56] And there is nothing worse than having an important personal day happening.

[02:01] While at the same time a bunch of Pimbal drama is exploding and it's colliding into my

[02:08] world.

[02:09] And I really, I really sort of don't often get irritated and annoyed to the point where

[02:15] I'm just like, you know what?

[02:16] I almost want to tell the people I know in this hobby to just like to f off.

[02:22] But yesterday was just one of those days because I report Pimbal news.

[02:26] I report what's happening in the Pimbal hobby.

[02:28] I try to give a fair and balanced observation of what's going on in the Pimbal world.

[02:32] I also try to share my opinions about what I think about companies and the games they're

[02:37] making.

[02:38] It is just my opinion.

[02:39] All right.

[02:40] Most of you, all of you should form your own opinions about games.

[02:46] And you should play them and you should form your own opinions about companies.

[02:50] But I hope this podcast helps to shape some of your opinions.

[02:53] Okay.

[02:54] So the reason why the podcast is down is apparently the John Papadu case that went on.

[03:02] You know, we heard that the judge gave a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.

[03:07] But apparently information that came from that hearing probably should not have been

[03:12] shared as transparently as it was.

[03:15] And that could lead to some issues with the case.

[03:18] And I just don't want to see anybody.

[03:21] I don't want to see anybody who is suing John Papadu or going against him.

[03:27] I don't want to see them fail because of some information that was mishandled or incorrectly

[03:34] shared with this podcast.

[03:35] So I took it down because I literally I don't want to help John's case in any way, shape,

[03:41] form.

[03:42] And I don't want anything to be in contempt of court.

[03:45] And I don't want any lawyers to lose their minds over something that was said on this podcast.

[03:50] So with that in mind, I've removed the episode.

[03:54] And so if you heard it, cool, if you didn't, you're not missing too much.

[03:57] You all know the story of what's going on.

[04:00] And I think it's time that justice is served.

[04:04] And as people have said, we incorrectly said that John's not a criminal.

[04:08] This was a civil case.

[04:10] He was found guilty in a civil suit.

[04:13] Does that mean that people will get their money?

[04:15] Absolutely not.

[04:16] It's still going to be a battle to get your money from John Papadu, Jr.

[04:22] It does raise questions about the future of Zidware games with deep root.

[04:27] I know there's a lot of anger, man.

[04:29] You read these threads.

[04:30] There's a lot of people that are chiming in with a lot of hatred and anger.

[04:34] And I understand why.

[04:36] But man, it waves you down after a while, like all of this.

[04:40] And I've said this for years on this podcast.

[04:44] These individuals, they suck the life out of the hobby.

[04:48] Like we should be talking about how effing awesome Iron Maiden is and not focused on John

[04:54] Papadu or Andrew Highway or Barry and Yop.

[04:58] But it's unavoidable.

[05:00] It really is because so many people have their money tied up with these individuals.

[05:05] And the black mark, the stain, right?

[05:09] The cloud still hangs over this hobby created by these individuals and it sucks.

[05:15] And it sucks.

[05:16] But at least we got some good news with how the judge awarded the plaintiffs hopefully

[05:23] money in the future.

[05:25] All right.

[05:26] We also talked about on the last episode, Martin at Pimbal News, his desire to interview

[05:32] Andrew Highway.

[05:33] I read out to you what I thought of that and how silly I think that decision was.

[05:39] And we have an update on that for you guys.

[05:41] So apparently Andrew Highway is now trying to wheeze a lot out of the interview because

[05:45] he does not want to say anything libelous or slanderous when he is interviewed.

[05:52] And the, again, the continued irony and the continued joke that this has become is unbelievable.

[06:00] I am happy that we are doing this podcast from America because what I hear over in the

[06:05] UK is that libel laws and slander laws.

[06:09] Apparently, you're guilty until proven innocent if someone says you slandered them.

[06:16] Good luck, Andrew Highway, trying to sue me or this podcast or anyone on Pinside who

[06:21] is calling you out and saying that we're slandering you or what we're doing is libelous

[06:26] because it is not what you did was wrong and you have no evidence.

[06:32] You have no evidence.

[06:33] I'm really glad that Dave Sanders is finally coming out and sharing his story as transparently

[06:41] as possible.

[06:42] And I want to ask all of you guys to do something because there is a GoFundMe page set up for

[06:49] Dave Sanders.

[06:51] And for those of you who don't know, Dave Sanders is a really, really nice guy.

[06:57] He has worked for five years on Andrew Highway's games, both full throttle and alien pinball.

[07:04] And Dave Sanders was paid nothing.

[07:06] Let me repeat that.

[07:08] He was paid nothing.

[07:10] And so somebody set up a GoFundMe page for Dave Sanders, which I think is incredible.

[07:17] And I implore all of you to donate something to Dave Sanders.

[07:21] I donated some money, a decent amount to Dave's GoFundMe.

[07:27] If you go on Pinside, you'll find the GoFundMe page for Dave Sanders.

[07:32] Even if each of you just gave him like 10 pounds, that would be a significant amount

[07:37] to helping Dave Sanders out.

[07:39] And I think if anyone deserves some help, it's Dave Sanders because Andrew really took

[07:45] advantage of someone that was weaker than him, that needed help.

[07:50] And I really, I have no, I have nothing but anger for someone who takes advantage of people

[07:57] who need assistance, who entered into an agreement with a man because they really just needed

[08:02] a career and they were promised one by Andrew.

[08:06] And I think he was abused.

[08:07] I really do.

[08:09] So if you have some extra money lying around and you want to do something good, I would

[08:14] find the GoFundMe page for Dave Sanders and kick him some coin.

[08:19] And I really would appreciate that if you guys could do that.

[08:22] I really would.

[08:23] It would meet a lot to me.

[08:24] I know it would mean the world to Dave.

[08:26] And I think the pinball community should come together to help him out.

[08:30] All right.

[08:31] All right.

[08:32] So is there an end in sight for this whole thing?

[08:34] I know that the pinball brothers company is going to try to get off the ground.

[08:39] I don't think it is.

[08:40] All right.

[08:41] I think we're getting to a point where there is just going to, there's just going to be

[08:48] some of these stories that are going to remain evergreen.

[08:51] They're going to remain pretty negative and there will never be a positive outcome.

[08:56] And that's sometimes life, right?

[08:59] That certain companies never rebound.

[09:01] That certain money is never recaptured.

[09:04] I think people have lost a lot.

[09:07] And I really think we have a lot of lessons to learn.

[09:12] And I'm really starting to get nervous that for some of the people out there, it doesn't

[09:18] feel like the lessons will ever be learned.

[09:21] When I see people going into the deep root thread and saying, I really want deep root to

[09:26] succeed and John to get the games because that's the only way people will get their stuff

[09:30] from him.

[09:31] And that's the only chance plaintiffs will have of getting paid back if he's able to make

[09:34] money with deep root.

[09:36] And I just have to have to really question people's flip flopping on these companies.

[09:44] And I have to really question which companies deserve to be cheerleaded.

[09:49] And I sometimes I'll talk to people and they literally will say, I just want there to be

[09:54] more pinball.

[09:55] I celebrate every new pinball venture.

[09:57] And you know how I feel about that.

[09:59] I don't feel that's the right way to go.

[10:01] And I think deep root partnering up with John Papadu.

[10:05] Here comes a point where how can you not judge a company and judge a man by his actions

[10:15] and his principles and his morals.

[10:18] And if you want to build a pinball company on top of John Papadu.

[10:24] I really don't understand how you cheerlead that.

[10:29] See I'm watching deep root.

[10:31] I'm just watching them with curiosity.

[10:34] I am not celebrating deep root.

[10:37] I am not excited by what deep root has in the works.

[10:42] I really am just curious if they can unravel the mystery of magic girl and Raza and what

[10:49] they're actually going to do.

[10:51] Because not only did they say they're going to do this stuff, they also said they're

[10:56] going to do it for really cheap.

[10:57] And I and again, I'm just curious if a pinball company that has never made a single game

[11:03] can live up to the hype of what they've been saying they're going to do.

[11:07] And curiosity and cheerleading are two very different things.

[11:11] But I do think people like Iceman and Iceman from the very beginning, he was one of the

[11:17] first people to tell people not to sue John to not get involved with Zane and the lawyer.

[11:24] And now he's saying like root for deep root and ice, you're a friend of the show.

[11:30] I just implore you not to back the wrong horses time and time again.

[11:38] And when we talk about, you know, shilling for these companies, it never ceases to amaze

[11:44] me how people, they have revisionist history.

[11:48] And they quickly go down the same road they've gone down before, supporting these companies

[11:54] that probably shouldn't get your support until they can prove they deserve it.

[12:00] Alright, man, it's like hard for me to go into the negative sides of the hobby recently

[12:07] because I just keep seeing these things.

[12:10] You know, the other thing that I was just thinking about, and this is just over the past 48

[12:14] hours, you know, I'm getting people emailing me, texting me, like there's all this, oh,

[12:19] there's all this angst in pinball right now.

[12:22] The other thing that I just kept thinking about was, alright, so we've got these companies

[12:26] like Dutch pinball, highway pinball, and J-pop, right, and Skip-B.

[12:31] I think you can put them all in the same corner of being like, yeah, these guys hurt the hobby.

[12:36] And then you've got the other companies that are actually making pinball machines that

[12:39] people can actually buy that actually are delivering on their promises.

[12:44] And those companies are American pinball, spooky pinball, Stern pinball, Jersey Jack pinball,

[12:51] multi-morphic, P3, you've got your Kago gaming company, right, am I missing anybody?

[12:57] Home pin is probably going to start shipping games soon.

[13:00] So you know, those companies are on the other side of the fence.

[13:04] And so here's the thing, as much as I will go after I think all those companies that are

[13:10] hurting the hobby, I also feel an obligation to give my honest opinions about the games

[13:16] that actually do come out.

[13:18] I don't think you listen to this podcast because you want to hear me just chill every single

[13:22] game, right, that I'm just going to say that Houdini shoots great or Al's Cooper is amazing.

[13:26] Like, you know, at the end of the day, I will play these machines, I will listen to people's

[13:31] feedback, and I will give my assessment of what I think the pin is like.

[13:35] And I don't think every pinball game is great.

[13:38] I don't think every pinball game is special.

[13:40] I don't think every pinball game should be collected.

[13:44] I don't think every pinball machine will go down as being a great machine.

[13:49] I think it's hit or miss.

[13:50] I think we've seen it.

[13:51] I think it's like 50, 50 with all these companies on whether or not their new titles are good

[13:55] or not.

[13:56] But also, I think we all know that all pinball machine experiences are 100% subjective.

[14:01] So either you like the machine or you don't, and you should go play it.

[14:05] You should go play it.

[14:06] You know, a lot of what I've been sort of going after lately in the hobby is sort of,

[14:12] you know, asking people to, like, you know, just really share how you feel and don't

[14:16] hold back.

[14:17] And I'm sorry sometimes if my show tends to err on the side of being a little bit more

[14:23] negative or a little bit more dramatic, right?

[14:25] So am I supposed to just say I like Houdini?

[14:29] If someone like Ben Heck is calling out the design on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[14:33] is not being great, should I be highlighting that?

[14:37] Or should I look at it like, well, Ben is just pissed off because they're not making

[14:41] his game and that's why he's saying that stuff.

[14:44] Now here's the thing.

[14:45] You all should play out of this Cooper's Nightmare Castle and make up your own minds

[14:49] on it and then share your opinions.

[14:52] I would say like it's best if we could share constructive criticism of games, but we

[14:56] know pinball and people are not like that.

[14:58] Like they will hop on and just say, I don't like the way it shoot it or I think the game

[15:02] was nice.

[15:03] I had fun, whatever.

[15:04] Right?

[15:05] It's really hard to be like constructively criticizing these games.

[15:09] I think we all get wound up pretty emotional in pinball and in these titles and I think

[15:14] we sometimes have an inability to present an even keel observation of the games.

[15:23] Okay, like we always, you know, we're always like looking for something to love in pinball

[15:26] machines, but sometimes we just come up short.

[15:29] Now, here's the thing.

[15:30] Here's the thing.

[15:32] Here's what upset me the last 48 hours because I sometimes feel like this hobby is just

[15:37] never satisfied.

[15:39] That no matter what pinball companies do, people just complain.

[15:43] And the example I want to use for that is Jersey Jack Pinball listened to your feedback

[15:50] on the apron on Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:53] So they took this really dark, dark blue apron that had beside in with his staff and they

[16:00] changed it to a more bright sort of fire orange and red apron that I think pops much

[16:07] nice or with ships.

[16:09] And what happens?

[16:11] Everyone is on there complaining and bitching about that now.

[16:15] And that's the problem.

[16:17] That is the problem.

[16:18] It's like, what the hell?

[16:19] How many of you guys actually look at the apron when you're playing a pinball machine?

[16:24] I can't remember the last time the apron artwork was that big of a deal, but all of a sudden

[16:30] now Jersey Jack is listening to you and then everyone's complaining.

[16:35] I saw the same thing over at the Iron Maiden thread.

[16:38] Iron Maiden is a great game.

[16:40] It is one of Stern's best games ever.

[16:43] It is an incredible game.

[16:45] As I said, it doesn't have toys, but it's not a game that's meant to have a lot of toys.

[16:49] It's a different kind of pinball game.

[16:51] And so what?

[16:52] They showed the Ellie, right?

[16:54] And people are seeing the Ellie experience and they're seeing like this hard coffee gizz,

[16:58] the ramp lift, they're seeing the different features of the Ellie.

[17:01] And then people are saying, you know what?

[17:03] I don't think the Ellie is worth this much more.

[17:06] I don't think there's this much more in the premium, like $1,500 more to warrant the

[17:12] price increase over the pro.

[17:15] And I keep, you know, it, here's why that annoys me because first of all, nobody has played

[17:22] the game.

[17:23] Nobody has played the game yet to really understand if it is an actual better experience.

[17:28] You can't get that from a video.

[17:30] And I thought the stuff going on was pretty cool.

[17:33] I thought the movement of like the, the verder by the upper left ramp was really cool.

[17:38] I thought the scoop that was underneath the ramp when it lifts up that fires the ball

[17:43] that was really cool.

[17:45] I know it lost some things like for the life of me, I don't understand why Stern can't

[17:50] put in a left outlaying kickback.

[17:53] It's like it was like 10 to 20 bucks.

[17:55] They took the subway out of the game from Archer.

[17:57] But so what?

[17:58] You know, Stern has made a great game.

[18:01] Stern makes games to stay in business.

[18:03] And you know, so some of the stuff comes out.

[18:05] Would you have liked the game to have some of those features?

[18:08] Would that make the game better for you?

[18:10] I don't know.

[18:11] I think people are loving it.

[18:12] I think it's also, Iron Maiden's creating sort of a dilemma for people because if the

[18:16] pro is so damn good, right?

[18:20] It's hard for people to justify that the stuff in the early premium is making the game

[18:25] much better.

[18:26] I mean, we normally see a significant item added to the premium early that does justify

[18:33] the difference, right?

[18:35] So Star Wars is a good example of that, right?

[18:37] The Star Wars has the hyper drive.

[18:40] You know, and I think that hyper drive was a significant increase in gameplay than anything

[18:49] that was on the pro.

[18:51] Okay, but we don't always see that significant like increase in sort of items.

[18:57] Take Batman 66, for example.

[18:59] Batman 66 has absolutely zero differences between the early, the premium, and the SLE.

[19:08] Okay, so think about that for a minute.

[19:10] There is a $7,000 difference between an SLE and a premium of Batman.

[19:16] And there's absolutely zero, zero changed in the gameplay of Batman.

[19:22] And the reason why people went in on Batman was simply because of cosmetic changes and

[19:28] rarity.

[19:29] That's it.

[19:30] People wanted the nicer cabinet, the nicer armor, the nicer topper, and that was it.

[19:34] And people spoke with their wallets and that was good enough for them.

[19:37] So I think to me, Iron Maiden, L.E. exists for a reason.

[19:42] They're getting basically an Iron Maiden super limited edition machine for $9,000.

[19:47] Stern is putting the most they've ever put into this game for $9,000.

[19:51] And mark my words.

[19:52] When people actually get their Iron Maiden L.E.s, they are going to be blown away.

[19:58] By the art, they're going to be blown away by the metallic foil from the shaker, the

[20:02] anti-reflective glass.

[20:04] Everything Stern is putting into the game.

[20:07] They are going to be very happy that they went in on this L.E.

[20:11] I think people who are waiting for, you know, there to be much more in the L.E.

[20:16] premium, like sculpted back area and, you know, and more toys and more interaction with

[20:22] the ball in terms of mechanisms.

[20:24] I don't know, man, Stern, this game is great.

[20:27] I think you need to look at Iron Maiden a little bit like Batman, where like, if the

[20:31] game is great and people are really enjoying it, you don't need to add too much.

[20:37] You can start to just make the premiums and the L.E.s, you know, cosmetically enhanced.

[20:42] I, again, like, I, I think you need to look at it like that.

[20:46] This isn't a game.

[20:47] Like, look, look, look, look at Ghostbusters.

[20:49] Like, okay, so Slimer moving back and forth, was that a huge improvement over Slimer just

[20:54] going up and down?

[20:56] Did the magnetic slings really add that much to the Ghostbusters game?

[20:59] And I know it had like the subway area that locked the ball in Ghostbusters, the physical

[21:04] ball lock.

[21:06] So I think you've got some things that are different enough, but I think, I think when

[21:12] I hear people complaining about Iron Maiden, I don't know, again, like it just makes me

[21:17] like bummed out that there's any negativity around Iron Maiden, L.E.

[21:22] I do agree that the marketing around this thing has just been another one of these head

[21:27] scratchers.

[21:28] And, you know, look, I was joking, all right.

[21:30] I was joking.

[21:31] I was a little sort of on a high from winning an award with my team.

[21:36] I was joking when I said I have more marketing ability in my little finger than all of Stern.

[21:41] All right.

[21:42] So if you're listening over there, Zach and George and guys, I was being facetious.

[21:47] I, you know, I look, I know I boast a little bit about my marketing abilities.

[21:52] And again, like I'm always being a little facetious when I do that sort of, you know, that the

[21:58] bragging about my marketing career.

[22:00] I know I'm good.

[22:01] I know I have good ideas, but here's the thing.

[22:03] And they know this.

[22:04] Okay.

[22:05] I'm going to be completely honest here.

[22:07] Pimball machines market themselves.

[22:09] It doesn't need much marketing, right?

[22:11] And we see it.

[22:12] Like Stern can sell out of a product without even showing you it just by announcing the theme.

[22:17] It doesn't need much marketing.

[22:19] They should not invest much in marketing.

[22:22] And when Stern Pimball has to, you know, release a game like Iron Maiden where they're contractually

[22:28] obligated not to do stuff because the band is controlling how this game is being launched.

[22:35] So don't blame Stern.

[22:37] It is completely Iron Maiden who is stalling and keeping you from seeing the premium artwork.

[22:44] I mean, Stern has a production timeline and they had to get the L.E.s on the line.

[22:50] And so that is why the L.E. was launched without the premium artwork.

[22:54] But it is 100% Maiden who's holding things up.

[22:59] And I'm shocked that Iron Maiden still has not revealed this Pimball machine on their

[23:05] website, right?

[23:06] If you go to Iron Maiden.com, it's all about legacy of the beast and they have all these

[23:10] products and tours and merchandise available and nothing about the Stern Pimball machine.

[23:16] I don't know why they're waiting, especially since people have the game in their homes

[23:22] and the games are in bars already.

[23:24] And the L.E.s I hear are sort of shipping and people are thinking you're going to have

[23:27] them in a few days.

[23:29] So completely sort of thrown for a curve that the band is still stalling on this thing.

[23:37] Now look, I do think it was unfortunate that you guys out there who committed to L.E.s have

[23:43] no idea what the premium is.

[23:45] But it's just the way it is.

[23:47] It's just the way it is.

[23:48] But also, I know for a fact, I shouldn't say that because it's not a fact, but I've heard

[23:53] from people that if you go in on an L.E., you are going to be very happy.

[23:57] I don't think anyone who goes in on an L.E.s going to regret it.

[24:00] I still think Maiden's going to go down as a very special game and I think the L.E.s

[24:04] are going to be gobbled up and they're going to be hard to get.

[24:08] I saw that someone posted on Stern the buy button for Iron Maiden L.E. is still available

[24:14] on their website.

[24:15] I actually sent them an email and asked and inquired about it.

[24:18] So I'm curious to see what comes back.

[24:21] But here's the thing.

[24:23] Again, I think Pirates of the Caribbean and Iron Maiden are both going to do great for

[24:28] their respective companies.

[24:30] I do.

[24:31] I still can't really warm up tremendously to the Pirates of the Caribbean theme, but the

[24:36] game does look really fun.

[24:38] I want to jump on it.

[24:39] I want to play it.

[24:40] I want you guys to get it because I think with all the Jersey Jack games, I think

[24:44] when this game gets into a home environment, we are really going to get the best reviews

[24:49] possible.

[24:50] When it gets on to location, we're going to get more good feedback about the game.

[24:56] And I think that's an exciting thing.

[24:58] I wish Pirates was out now.

[25:00] I really do.

[25:01] I hope it's not going to be too much longer.

[25:04] I know Eric is going to Jersey Jack.

[25:06] I believe I think this month to start tooling up the production line.

[25:11] So it's going to be an exciting summer for Pimball.

[25:16] We know Stern has another title coming out in a few months, but there's going to be a

[25:20] little bit of a low.

[25:21] I think the low is going to happen after Chicago Gaming announces their next title, which I believe

[25:26] is going to be this month.

[25:28] Then what's next, right?

[25:30] Who Dini's are still on the line?

[25:32] Alice Cooper Nightmare Castles, when will they start shipping?

[25:35] I thought they would have been ready by now.

[25:36] So it looks like production is going to start sometime soon because people are actually

[25:41] getting their numbers.

[25:43] So as Charlie mentioned, the way Alice Cooper numbers are working is when you, you're not

[25:49] just, it's not sequential because some of them are offered to consumers.

[25:54] Distributors are given titles or sorry, given numbers in sort of different stages.

[26:01] So let's take for example, like Pimball Star.

[26:04] Joe might get like, you're going to get games number 30 to 50.

[26:08] You're going to get games number like 90 to 110.

[26:11] You're going to get games number like 220.

[26:13] You know, like that's how it works.

[26:15] And they distribute those sort of like fairly and equally to the spooky distributors.

[26:21] And so, you know, so they have some stock.

[26:23] And then you can also order directly from spooky Pimball.

[26:27] So that's how it's going to work.

[26:28] Look, I know I've said some like negative stuff about Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castles.

[26:33] And I probably should not have said as much as I have.

[26:36] I think I, again, I think I'm going off of like the drama and some of the stuff that Ben

[26:42] was saying and I let it get to me.

[26:44] And, you know, I implore you to play the game.

[26:46] I did feel the shots were tight.

[26:48] I did feel like having all those posts there, you know, they're not targets.

[26:53] The ball does sort of just keep hitting them and bouncing back.

[26:56] And that's just my thing in Pimball.

[26:58] I just don't like really tight shots.

[27:00] I think if you're trying to do too much in a game, I think the game can suffer from too

[27:06] many bricks.

[27:07] And that was, so that was my initial assessment was like you can have a lot of bricks in the

[27:13] game.

[27:14] And also because that huge castle takes up so much of the game and there's so much

[27:18] plastics that happen like mid way up the play field, I do think the ball just disappears

[27:23] a lot underneath it.

[27:24] And you can't see like what's going on with the ball.

[27:28] And so I do think that seeing, seeing where the ball is at all times can be important

[27:33] in Pimball.

[27:34] You do want to see the ball movement and the ball doing fun stuff and not just disappear

[27:39] behind plastics.

[27:42] But look, it's really early on in Alice Cooper.

[27:45] I think they're going to sell everyone.

[27:47] So again, I do think they're going to sell everyone.

[27:50] I do think people though should play it before they commit.

[27:53] And the games are still for sale.

[27:54] So all 500 have not been sold out.

[27:56] All right.

[27:57] But at least you know you're going to get your game.

[27:59] I mean, spooky is going to deliver.

[28:00] We're not going to end up here like six months from now trying to figure out where the

[28:04] money went.

[28:05] That's just not going to happen.

[28:06] And so you know, that's a good thing.

[28:09] So we got a Dutch update.

[28:12] Someone reached out to Barry and Yop and basically just got the real short reply that production's

[28:17] taking longer than we expected.

[28:19] You know, here we go again.

[28:21] More, more unforeseen delays.

[28:24] Remember they said that May June was when the games were going to go into production.

[28:27] Remember when I said there's no way that's going to happen.

[28:29] There's no way that's going to happen.

[28:31] We once again have these guys endlessly stalling.

[28:34] I think I incorrectly reported on this podcast that they had received new funding and an investor.

[28:41] And I think people are saying that's not the case.

[28:43] So I don't know, you know, the only people who can clear this up on whether or not Barry

[28:49] and Yop have an investor on whether or not they got new money to help production ramp up.

[28:54] The only people that should be speaking about this is Barry and Yop.

[28:58] And why Barry and Yop don't come out and speak more to people is all you need to know

[29:03] about whether or not you should invest your money in this company.

[29:06] I just would never give money to people that go dark, go silent, have kept people's money

[29:12] for years, refused to give refunds.

[29:15] And they can't, the least they could do was email people on a weekly basis, at least

[29:20] give them some of the truth about how the company is going to move forward.

[29:26] And is there a new investor or not?

[29:29] I would love for them just to answer that one specific, specific question, all right?

[29:36] All right.

[29:37] Is there anything else going on in the pinball world that I am missing before I read your

[29:40] emails?

[29:41] Let's see.

[29:42] I'm just going to go real quick on to Pinside and do a quick scan because I think I've

[29:47] pretty much hit everything Iron Maiden.

[29:49] We covered that.

[29:50] We covered what's going on in Alien.

[29:53] Everyone donated Dave Sanders, please.

[29:56] There's new Guardians of the Galaxy Code that people are really liking.

[29:58] So if you have that game, that's great.

[30:00] It's Allentown Pintfest starting today and tomorrow.

[30:03] I'm not sure I can be able to go.

[30:05] I just had, there's so many plans with the Kentucky Derby in Cinco de Mayo and the weather

[30:09] has been warm.

[30:10] And the last thing I want to do is sit inside and play pinball now that we finally have

[30:14] some warm weather.

[30:16] We covered the questions for Andrew Highway.

[30:18] There's the home pin official Thunderbirds thread seems to have some activity.

[30:24] So let's dive into home pin and see what exactly is going on there.

[30:30] Let it go into the bottom.

[30:32] Doesn't seem like much.

[30:33] Let's see, pictures of a whitewood.

[30:35] All right.

[30:36] Well, this pictures of a whitewood productions be gone on Thunderbirds.

[30:39] There you go.

[30:40] All right.

[30:41] Let's go to the emails that you guys have been sending me.

[30:43] So I'm going to try and go back and go and make sure I don't duplicate things I've

[30:49] read.

[30:50] So I got an email from John Gardiner about, and the subject that it was Dave Sanders,

[30:56] and he says, thanks for stepping over this side of the pond and supporting Dave.

[31:01] Thanks for your podcast to always listen to it. John Gardiner, thank you so much for listening to the show.

[31:07] Thank you for saying thank you to me for supporting Dave.

[31:11] As I said earlier in this show, I really want everyone to support Dave.

[31:15] I actually got an email from Dave Sanders.

[31:19] I want to read that to you guys because it's not personal, it's not sensitive.

[31:24] And he wrote, let's see, do do do do.

[31:28] He said, Chris, you'll be pleased to know that I'm not anonymous anymore.

[31:34] And the pinball community is really rallying around me.

[31:38] You had a definite role to play as a catalyst in allowing that to happen.

[31:42] And I am grateful.

[31:45] Well, Dave, thank you so much.

[31:47] I look, I've said this to Dave and I say this to everybody.

[31:51] I think certain stories need to be told.

[31:54] And when the truth is out there, I think it helps people support certain people.

[32:00] I think it also helps people stay away from certain people that once you see the true colors of people like Dave Sanders,

[32:07] you can't help but want to support him and rally around him.

[32:11] And once you see the true colors of Andrew highway, you can't help.

[32:15] But want to run as far away from an individual like that.

[32:19] All right.

[32:20] I think a lot of people are starting to read now that thread on RGP, Rex Games pinball.

[32:26] That was the conversation that Andrew was having with one of his employees.

[32:30] I think that really shows the kind of guy that was managing these people.

[32:34] All right.

[32:36] All right.

[32:36] I got an email from Kevin Stracer.

[32:39] Kevin, thank you for listening.

[32:40] Kevin says that subject was your day has come, Canada.

[32:44] He says, Chris, I keep hearing you wonder why you have no podcast sponsors.

[32:49] I am interested in discussing it.

[32:51] I'm starting a new pinball venture and should have the first product out next month.

[32:56] All right.

[32:57] He then goes on to say kind of what it is.

[32:58] It's not a machine.

[32:59] Don't worry people.

[33:01] Kevin, I will reach out to you and he said, I will take you up on your free marketing too.

[33:06] So Kevin, first of all, thank you for listening to the show.

[33:08] I'm excited to hear about what your pinball venture is.

[33:11] And let's see, like maybe we can help get some attention for what you,

[33:16] you're bringing to the pinball world.

[33:18] I think people when they see what it is are going to be excited.

[33:21] I got an email from JetBoy.

[33:24] JetBoy, I don't know who you are, but I thank you.

[33:25] He said, Hey, I just finished listening to your latest podcast.

[33:29] I have a couple of questions.

[33:31] If you are as good as you say, working for a top firm and charging 400 bucks in hour,

[33:36] why do you want to be associated with these losers?

[33:40] The same company that fails time and time again to have a good,

[33:42] satisfying reveal or the same company that thinks their presence on the biggest pinball form in the world is worth their time.

[33:50] Do you think they will call and seriously ask for your help?

[33:54] Even if they do, do you think it's legit?

[33:57] They will probably call you to sweet talk you into hyping their next title on your podcast.

[34:02] This way you can become an unsuspecting shill.

[34:05] Remember why people listen to you.

[34:07] I know you've already said it on air.

[34:10] It might be a little late to walk this back,

[34:12] but just think about how it would look to your listeners.

[34:16] Well, JetBoy, I appreciate you saying that because I was thinking a lot about that too is

[34:20] I don't ever want this podcast to be in the back pocket of any manufacturer.

[34:25] And you know, it wouldn't make sense, right?

[34:27] It wouldn't make sense for me to know too much about a manufacturer to the point where I couldn't.

[34:34] I couldn't give you my honest opinion about their games and their their practices, right?

[34:39] Look, the easiest way for Stern to silence me or to bring me into the fold is so simple.

[34:44] All Stern would have to do is say, Hey, look, Chris, we'd love to share with you what we have going on over at Stern.

[34:51] We would like you to sign an NDA and in doing so, we will give you

[34:56] inside information into what is happening here, but you are of course, you know, under NDA and cannot share.

[35:03] And that would be the easiest way for them to shut me up.

[35:06] It also would be the easiest way for them to get me to be ultra positive all the time about everything they do.

[35:13] Because that's what they kind of did with Nate and they brought Nate into the fold more.

[35:20] And I think we saw that with Nate, right?

[35:22] And I think it actually hurt Nate's ability to be objective and fair and remember,

[35:28] remember when they did the whole SLE,

[35:30] boondoggle and Nate came out and said how stupid he thought it was.

[35:34] And then immediately the next show, he was super apologetic to everyone at Stern.

[35:39] Because clearly he had felt that his opinions probably damaged the relationships he had with his Stern context.

[35:48] And so I don't ever want to be in that position.

[35:51] I don't think you guys want to listen to this show if I'm always just praising everything Stern does.

[35:57] So I won't sign any NDA over at Stern.

[36:00] I won't, you know, here's the thing though is this.

[36:04] If George Gomez or Zach wants to like bring me in on some stuff and you know,

[36:09] I'm never going to like burn bridges with individuals.

[36:12] I'm never going to burn my relationships with people.

[36:16] The part is this.

[36:17] This is the part that, you know, I need to start thinking long and hard about how I do something.

[36:23] Because I do know a lot of information about future Stern titles.

[36:30] And I've just, I've been hearing more rumors about what next year's titles will be.

[36:34] And how I cover that stuff is always weighing on me.

[36:40] Because there are certain things I just won't say.

[36:43] I won't say anything that was told to me in confidence by some of the people over at Stern that I know.

[36:49] And those people know who they are.

[36:51] And it's not just like who you think it is.

[36:53] And I think that's the thing too is I think a lot of times they think it's like, you know,

[36:58] it's like Jared and this.

[37:00] And now I'm like, no, like there are people at Stern that give me some info.

[37:04] And they share stuff.

[37:06] And you know, I know what Ken and Ken not be shared on air.

[37:11] Because I don't want to spoil.

[37:13] I don't.

[37:14] I don't want to spoil Stern's ability to launch these games and to get you excited about them.

[37:21] Now that being said, when I hear rumor titles or rumor things going on, that's different.

[37:27] Right.

[37:27] See, I have actual verifiable information that I just won't share.

[37:31] Because I, again, like I don't want to hurt anybody.

[37:34] All right.

[37:35] But rumors are different.

[37:37] Like I've been hearing what some rumor new titles are.

[37:39] I'll share those on a future podcast.

[37:42] But those to me are complete speculation.

[37:45] There is nothing to back them up.

[37:47] I haven't seen anything on any of them.

[37:49] But I'll say this.

[37:50] I'll say this on this podcast.

[37:52] If the rumors are true about what future themes are coming from Stern Pimball, just God help

[37:59] everyone else in this hobby.

[38:01] God help everybody else.

[38:02] Because we all know, theme is everything for the most part.

[38:06] Stern knows how to make a fun Pimball machine.

[38:08] We know that.

[38:09] And I think they have some titles coming.

[38:12] Again, that are just going to like, people are just not going to like be able to survive,

[38:17] competing with Stern with the cadence of killer titles.

[38:21] And I'll say this too.

[38:22] I think Stern has really learned where the sweet spot is.

[38:26] It's nostalgia.

[38:28] They are coming out with titles that are going to hit the market.

[38:32] They're going to hit the Bullseye Dead Center with some of these themes coming out.

[38:37] And I'm super excited.

[38:38] And you're going to be as well.

[38:40] So that's what excites me.

[38:43] What doesn't excite me is knowing toy stories coming out.

[38:46] And I have to now wait like two years and just like, hang on to Jack and figure out production.

[38:51] To me, that doesn't excite me.

[38:54] I think the way Stern does it is right.

[38:56] You don't know what a Stern game is.

[38:58] You don't get to see it until it's complete.

[39:01] And when you see it, you will get the game within a few weeks.

[39:05] That is how you launch Pimball machines.

[39:07] They understand that that is the way to market machines.

[39:11] All right.

[39:12] All right.

[39:13] I got an email from Michael Shaulis.

[39:15] This is Dear Canada.

[39:16] Sorry, I could not get through to you on that 1-800 number.

[39:20] So I'm writing this quick email.

[39:23] Since your podcast, a pirates problem, you have been on fire, providing your listeners

[39:28] with some of the best commentary and insights on a variety of topics that are stirring up

[39:33] the Pimball world.

[39:35] Sometimes it has been overly manic, overly critical, and overly vindictive, but always entertaining

[39:42] and in my opinion, usually spot on.

[39:45] Well done, Twippy Award winner.

[39:47] Keep them coming.

[39:48] PS, time to park the beast and get Bubba some time in the park.

[39:53] Well, Mike, thank you for the email.

[39:55] I'm glad you're entertained by this.

[39:59] I'm on the fence because even though it's entertaining, it's been eating at me lately.

[40:04] The amount of negativity, the amount of just...

[40:10] That's the best word for it.

[40:11] I just feel like we've gone a little too far down the road of being overly cynical,

[40:16] overly negative because we've been focusing on topics that are negative that have a lot

[40:22] of people angry.

[40:23] I know a lot of it feels like we have been vindicated and validated.

[40:31] Our credibility as a podcast could never be higher than it is now.

[40:35] This is not me bragging.

[40:36] We were right.

[40:38] We were telling people.

[40:39] Anyone who listened to this show, if I was like a stockbroker giving you tips, I think

[40:45] I've been pretty spot on giving you the right tips on where you should put your money

[40:50] in the pinball world and which companies you should avoid and which companies you should

[40:53] support.

[40:54] So thank you, Mike.

[40:55] Bubba, it's getting too hot for Bubba.

[40:58] Bulldogs can't be out in warm temperature.

[41:00] It was like 90 degrees yesterday.

[41:03] All right.

[41:04] I got an email from Jeff S. The title was Ha Ha Ha.

[41:08] Real Andrew Highway episode was your best one yet.

[41:15] Great intro, great scoops and highly entertaining.

[41:18] Pull the curtains and exposed Andrew the charlatan.

[41:21] The episode probably needs a warning.

[41:24] What are you about to hear is the disturbing and remember to plug your children's ears.

[41:30] Part two.

[41:31] What you should have spent more time talking about is J-pop versus Bill Brandis versus Deeproot.

[41:37] Going to Bill, contract terms were breached because working games were never delivered.

[41:43] As such, Deeproot does not own licenses for the titles being developed by their five

[41:48] designers.

[41:50] Not just Magic Girl, but all titles.

[41:52] If that is correct, Deeproot might as well put a match to their factory following five

[41:57] days of Deeproot because they don't have the rights to their own games.

[42:02] That is messed up.

[42:04] Why did Deeproot make such a devastating decision to doom their company?

[42:09] Deeproot didn't just shoot themselves in the foot, they unloaded the revolver into their

[42:14] head.

[42:15] Part three, Jeff writes, you won't be allowed back on Pinside, so give up the campaigning.

[42:22] Pete Rose will get into the Hall of Fame before your application is reconsidered.

[42:27] No you have not earned a way back in.

[42:30] You said yourself that you wouldn't last long anyways because your post would be heavily

[42:35] moderated.

[42:36] You aren't allowed to speak about other Pinsiders and couldn't speak the truth.

[42:41] Three strikes and you would be banned again within a week.

[42:44] Now the issue is resolved.

[42:45] It's time to go outside and play.

[42:47] Jeff, first of all, thank you.

[42:48] Let's go from bottom up.

[42:50] Yep, they'll never let me back on Pinside.

[42:53] Let's jump to Deeproot.

[42:55] I think more information has been revealed than I ever thought would actually be revealed

[42:59] publicly about the contract between Bill Brandis and John Papaduke and Zidware and

[43:07] American Pimball and the rights to the games and because the funny thing is this, when American

[43:13] Pimball was making Magic Girl, they didn't have the rights to do that.

[43:19] Bill secured the rights when Pintasia invested money in John.

[43:24] The contract by which the rights which switched hands, they were very simple.

[43:29] They were very simple that John would only get back the rights to Zidware and Zidware

[43:36] IPs if he delivered a working Magic Girl.

[43:41] Bill was a genius to write that clause into the contract because I think anyone could

[43:49] set up a Magic Girl inside a courtroom and I would love John Papaduke to stand over

[43:56] that machine and explain to us all how Magic Girl is a working Pimball machine.

[44:01] It would be the most hilarious sort of Pimball demo ever to have John Papaduke in 2018.

[44:12] Flip a Magic Girl.

[44:14] What kills me about the whole Magic Girl thing is remember when American Pimball released

[44:19] the letter that the Magic Girls were finished and they were going to go to their customers

[44:22] and they were built to Zidware specifications and I can't even imagine what was going

[44:27] on in John's head when he played those machines and he actually put them in boxes and sent

[44:33] them to customers.

[44:35] How did he sleep at night knowing that people were going to unbox them and tell the world

[44:40] what a broken mess the games were and nobody told the world more than this guy right here.

[44:48] Jeff thank you for saying you enjoyed the Andrew Highway Podcast.

[44:51] I think it's quite clear Andrew's true colors are out there and I'm glad that this

[44:58] podcast has helped tell that story.

[45:01] Again it was an important one to say.

[45:03] I got an email from Moses over street he says podcast taken down.

[45:08] Hey there Pimball brother I listened to it yesterday but notice today that you took

[45:12] it down and God we trust just curious as to why didn't seem too crazy or controversial.

[45:19] Moses thank you for listening to the show as I explain there's just been some drama

[45:24] with like the court case and I just don't want to get anyone in trouble.

[45:27] I don't want to help John's defense at all so I just removed it.

[45:31] I pretty much summarized everything in this podcast as well so nothing really lost with

[45:36] that podcast being removed all right.

[45:39] I got a press release.

[45:40] I do find press releases funny when when crazy levy is out there right he clearly like

[45:46] wrote this press release here's the here's the headline.

[45:49] G fuel energy drink joins NYC PC team as executive producer.

[45:56] All right so here's the funny part about this you I love non PR people trying to do PR first

[46:03] of all you would never in a million years put into the headline of a press release the

[46:09] abbreviations for something nobody's familiar with so I'm assuming NYC PC is New York City

[46:20] Pimball championships okay but they abbreviated it first so okay the next line is sugar free

[46:27] energy drink to fuel New York City championships.

[46:32] I love levies quote I got to read this G fuel joining the NYC PC team is is a major major

[46:39] boom equivalent to a double super jackpot with four times play field scoring said NPP's

[46:49] levy Newman their product is awesome and their experience in esports tournaments and streaming

[46:55] brings tournament Pimball to a higher level than anybody thought was possible I know he's

[47:01] being he's got to be being facetious here that hyperbole is just crazy and then Tim Sexton

[47:06] as a quote together G fuel never beef productions first of all guys you never abbreviate you're

[47:13] not supposed to abbreviate things like this it's just it's just it's just read weird never

[47:18] beef productions and the NYC PC are bringing the game and launching the next error of pinball

[47:25] as a high level competitive esport presenting the world under glass in spectacular fashion

[47:32] I wonder if they put that in there for me this partnership will help dynamically expand the

[47:37] New York City Pimball championships now and in the future said Tim Sexton we are excited to

[47:42] support the New York City Pimball championship and bring our experience to help them expand

[47:47] in the coming years this continues G fuels commitment to everywhere that gaming is said clip

[47:54] Morgan founder and chief executive officer of G fuel as part of the sponsorship G fuel provide

[48:01] every registered New York City Pimball championship competitor with a free G fuel shaker cup

[48:05] and plenty of G fuel stick packs to power them through the tournament all right what's funny

[48:11] about this press releases they didn't even all the paragraphs are on this like no one hit enter

[48:15] like there there's no spaces between the paragraphs so that was funny but look I mean like I'm

[48:21] glad there's the New York City Pimball championships I think it's sold out for people to compete in it

[48:27] and getting G fuel as a sponsor that's great I'm happy to see Pimball get out there more do I

[48:32] think Pimball championships are boring as fuck absolutely absolutely there's nothing more boring

[48:38] than watching guys play Pimball for like 30 minute ball times because the guys are so good I think

[48:42] tournaments need to have more of like each player gets five minutes whoever sets the top score

[48:47] that's the winner that would be more exciting for me just because then you have like the clock

[48:50] ticking down you know you you could end it early if one guy set the high score uh and and that

[48:57] was it and then the you know let's say you set like a billion points in five minutes and then the

[49:02] next guy goes and he drains ball three and then you're done like I don't know or or like no the other

[49:07] way around is let's say like you have five competitors and like four guys go and then they um

[49:13] you know the highest score is like 800 million and then the fifth guy gets a billion quickly in

[49:18] three minutes just turn it off you won you won you got it it's just like it's like scoring more

[49:22] points in basketball you know when the clock's up game over I would do it that way all right let's see

[49:27] I think I might have a couple more emails then I got to get to work I'm always late oh I got

[49:31] I got to figure this out all right I got an email from Matt the the headline was sacking the f up
