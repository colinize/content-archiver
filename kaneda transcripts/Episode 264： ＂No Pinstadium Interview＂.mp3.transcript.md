[00:00] Gonna take a lot of time and lay away from you

[00:05] There's nothing that I'm fun with, man or more

[00:08] Whatever I do, I just arrange down in Africa

[00:22] Welcome to episode 264 of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:27] I'm your host, Canada, and I heard the feedback

[00:29] I heard from people out there saying, you're a last few podcasts

[00:33] Have been really pessimistic

[00:35] We're gonna turn it around

[00:37] We're gonna do what we do best on this episode of Canada's Spinball Podcast

[00:40] We're gonna go down the list of manufacturers and talk about what's going on in the pinball world

[00:45] I am going to get more people on the show

[00:48] I know Blake, Dumasnil, was supposed to come on

[00:51] It's early in the morning, I just wanted to get you guys a show

[00:54] But Blake, if you're listening, you're gonna come on soon

[00:56] I promise you, and I just need to find time

[00:59] I've been really busy at work

[01:01] Now speaking about really busy

[01:04] This show, and I've been doing it now for almost three years

[01:08] And I love doing this show

[01:10] And I hope you love listening to Canada's Spinball Podcast

[01:14] It is, I think the most frequent pinball podcast that is out there

[01:19] I think we have, I think I want to say we almost have the most pinball podcast episodes

[01:23] of any pinball podcast ever

[01:26] It's debatable whether or not that's a quality over quality approach

[01:31] But what I've done, and I was talking to Ryan over head to head

[01:35] And we were both sort of thinking about doing this, and I saw they did it recently

[01:39] I set up a Patreon account

[01:42] So people who listen to this show, who love this show

[01:46] If you want to donate and show some support to this show

[01:51] I would love, love, love

[01:54] For you guys who are frequent listeners who love this show

[01:57] To show any support you can to Canada's Spinball Podcast

[02:01] If you go to Patreon, which is PATR-ON.com

[02:06] And you search for Canada's Spinball Podcast

[02:09] You will find it, I also think you'll get a kick out of the different tiers of support that you can give to this show

[02:17] I don't want to spoil it, but you should go and check it out

[02:20] It's a little bit more exciting and entertaining than the tiers that you'll get over at head to head pinball

[02:26] But I will say this, I will match their offer to wish you a happy birthday

[02:31] Okay, we're going to do that for you guys because we want to make sure everyone's birthday is recognized

[02:36] Now speaking of birthdays, it was my birthday yesterday

[02:39] And had a great time in New York City with Brenda and celebrating what is now 42 years of insanity on this planet

[02:48] Now let's jump in to the pinball news happening in the world

[02:52] And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to read some of your emails

[02:57] Okay, how's that sound?

[02:59] Alright, let's do this

[03:00] Alright, I want to start today's show with Spooky Pinball

[03:04] And what is going on in the world of Spooky Pinball?

[03:09] Alright, so I've been reading a bout Rob Zombie

[03:13] Okay, and you're saying, Canada, what are you doing?

[03:15] You don't even like Rob Zombie, I get it

[03:17] But here is the thing, I think people who own Rob Zombie, what I've been reading, is that they're waiting patiently for the game to be done

[03:26] And there are some bugs in the game that they need to fix

[03:31] And here's the thing, they know this, okay, Charlie has come into the thread and said we know that there are certain elements and certain things that were promised in this game that we need to get to

[03:44] Now the thing is they're busy as can be, alright, they're switching over the line

[03:49] They only really have, I think one coder working on all this stuff and he's swamped

[03:56] And they have to move over now and get Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle on the line

[04:01] And so if you have a Rob Zombie, you're going to have to wait probably to the end of the year at the earliest to see the bugs fixed in the game

[04:11] Now what else would you like Charlie to do?

[04:14] I think that Quagmire, they're in a little bit and Charlie says this, it's really hard for them to hire full-time employees at a company like Spooky

[04:25] You know, partially because where they're located, right, it's not like they're in the middle of a major city

[04:32] They also don't always have something for people to do every day

[04:37] I sometimes think people don't realize that every day games are not on the line

[04:42] A pinball company with its overhead of salary, of rent, of electricity, of all the things that it takes to make a pinball company operate

[04:53] That all eats away at your profit, right?

[04:57] Every day that Stern doesn't have the army of people working on games, they lose a fortune

[05:02] Because they've got something like 200 people working in that ginormous factory of theirs

[05:07] So that is why the line is always going

[05:10] So look, give Charlie a chance to get Rob Zombie finished

[05:15] It's also like with these games that have been sold already

[05:19] And Charlie is going to make no more money in getting a few of these bugs ironed out

[05:27] He needs to focus on the new game that people are paying for because people won't want to go in on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[05:34] If the code is really spartan, so that is where the effort will be, all right?

[05:40] So Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, it still doesn't feel like it's shipping

[05:45] And it's kind of crazy that we're still not seeing certain games out in the wild like we thought we would

[05:55] It's the end of September and Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, I'm not seeing unboxings happening

[06:01] I'm not saying the same thing, we're going to talk a little bit about Pirates of the Caribbean

[06:05] The same thing, it's like where are these games, right? Where are they?

[06:10] And also, you know, another, again, we've been talking about this, nobody wants to buy spot number 66

[06:19] It's now being lower to the price of $799

[06:24] I think he lowered it by $1

[06:26] But look, we're now at the point where this guy is giving someone a $200 discount

[06:34] To get the game early and nobody wants it

[06:38] And I think that has a lot to do with the simple fact that the games aren't shipping

[06:43] I think once the games start shipping, someone will probably jump in and take that spot

[06:49] All right, so we're just waiting, we're waiting to see what happens with Alice Cooper

[06:54] And when it will finally get to consumers, all right?

[06:58] This is going to be a crazy October, November, just crazy

[07:03] There are too many games arriving at the same time

[07:07] I literally, think about it like this, the pinball market is really small

[07:12] It is idiotic with the amount of companies out there, right?

[07:17] All trying to carve a window by which their game is the game that is in demand and the new game in the marketplace

[07:25] That all these companies would sort of release products on top of each other

[07:32] It's stupid, it absolutely makes no sense, but it's also like, that's just the reality

[07:37] Charlie showed this game all the way back at Texas Pinball Festival was the reveal of it

[07:43] And people thought it would ship sooner, same thing with pirates, all right

[07:46] Scott Dinesi game number two

[07:49] Game number two, we know probably absolutely nothing about it

[07:53] Other than it's going to have some ramps, there was like a little teaser image

[07:58] What I like about what I'm hearing when Scott is interviewed

[08:02] Is he talks a lot about getting the whitewood right?

[08:08] He says here's a few whitewoods, there will be many more because he will not stop until the game has great flow

[08:17] And shoots buttery smooth because his favorite designer of all time is Steve Richie

[08:24] And look, I applaud that because I've said it, the one thing that kills me on spooky games

[08:30] Is they don't shoot very well and so Scott has the best selling spooky game of all time

[08:38] And I've said it before, I've said it, I'll say it again

[08:42] He should be designing and helping with the whitewood designs of all spooky games moving forward

[08:49] All right, so we look forward to seeing that game, but we all know that the game's a long ways away

[08:54] Okay, 550 total nuclear annihilations will be made and then the line, there's two lines at spooky

[09:02] They both will be focused on Alice Cooper's nightmare castle, which I believe the time frame to build all 500 is 18 months

[09:13] So it's, I know, when you say it like that, like wow a year and a half of the same game

[09:19] Imagine Stern Pimbal just having one game for 18 months, I get it totally different companies

[09:25] But man, there's going to be fatigue and lack of excitement as we get like a year from now on Alice Cooper's nightmare castle

[09:32] All right, Stern Pimbal, the stern of the union address coming out in October, they're starting to like, I love the fact that Stern is starting to tease their own state of the unions

[09:45] But in it, they have the following thing, Star Wars with its newest asteroid video mode and intense lightsaber duel

[09:56] Batman 66 will get new major villain cliffhangers, I'm excited to see what that is

[10:03] Ghostbusters, as soon as Star Wars is complete, we will be focusing on a final update for Ghostbusters

[10:12] In that beautiful, a final update for a game that came out forever ago

[10:18] AeroSmith will also be getting a little more polish and kiss

[10:22] We'll be revisiting kiss code very soon to create a final update

[10:28] Look, there's no such thing as a final update of a Pimbal code

[10:33] A game can always have stuff added to it can always get polished

[10:37] I think Stern buyers, they know this is the journey

[10:43] There's no denying the fact that when you buy a new Stern game, you're going to be waiting years before the game is complete

[10:53] And by that, as I said, nothing's ever complete

[10:57] But it's going to be two years in October since Batman 66 was revealed to the world

[11:06] It's still not done, it's amazing what they're putting into the game

[11:10] It's also amazing two years have gone by and we're still not finished

[11:15] I mean, I don't think Batman's going to be done until maybe next October

[11:19] But we'll see, we'll see, we know Lyman has to move on to other things

[11:23] I just, how could it take so long?

[11:26] How could it take two years to code one game?

[11:31] Think about that, you go into work and let's say Lyman's doing a 10 hour day

[11:37] How can you do 10 hours every day for 365 days and not finish a game?

[11:47] I mean, there's a lot in that man but doesn't feel like there's two years worth of time

[11:55] I mean, God, I hope this man is paid hourly and has a special contract with Stern

[12:00] I've been in the Deadpool club, lots of club threads on Pinside popping up

[12:05] Because there's not a lot of new stuff shipping

[12:07] It seems that the consensus on Deadpool is that the LE package is beautiful

[12:13] It is visually stunning

[12:16] I think Stern understands how to make a game visually popped

[12:20] I don't think the value is it there

[12:23] We all know this, the only value in an LE over a premium is the visual, is the artsy, artsy stuff

[12:34] Maybe there's a shaker mode or maybe there's some glass, but for the most part

[12:38] You are paying for the limited run, you're paying for the different art package

[12:44] And you're paying for the sparkling armor

[12:47] You're not getting anything different in gameplay over the premium

[12:51] But it seems that people do love Deadpool LE

[12:55] Now Deadpool LE's are not sold out

[12:58] By that I mean you can still find them new in box all over the place

[13:03] Go find a new in box Iron Maiden, LE, you can't

[13:06] Go find a new in box Batman, LE, you can't

[13:10] Go find a new in box Ghostbusters, LE, you can't

[13:13] Those games Batman, Ghostbusters, Iron Maiden, they sold out

[13:17] Now what I think has happened is that Deadpool LE has sold out through the distributors

[13:26] Which means Stern has sold off 500 distributors have them sitting in boxes

[13:32] Will it sell out? I'm not sure, I'm not sure on this one

[13:38] I think people are waiting to see where the code goes with the game

[13:42] I think people are enjoying the game for sure

[13:44] I mean I'm hearing positive stuff on this game, I'm not hearing a lot of negative stuff

[13:49] But then it's always hard too because anyone who buys a game

[13:54] How many times do people actually buy a game, open it up and tell you they don't like it

[14:00] It's the sort of interesting phenomenon is the only reviews we get are from the people who own them

[14:09] And those people naturally want to justify their $9,000 purchase

[14:13] You know this is how this hobby should be and this is where I think I've got a little carried away on some of my previous shows

[14:20] If you buy a game and you like the game and you're having fun with the game and you love the way the game looks in your house

[14:26] And you're enjoying it, nothing else matters, it doesn't, it really doesn't

[14:31] It's like I went into the Iron Maiden threat as well and it's just like the consensus, men, people are loving the game

[14:38] People are just having fun, it's interesting when the threats start to be mostly the club threads

[14:44] And it's just about the ownership experience

[14:47] You know there's a lot less drama, there's a lot less news for sure

[14:52] Like you, there is not a lot going on that deserves frequent podcasts lately

[14:59] And I'll admit that, you'll see my shows haven't been as frequent

[15:03] Because there's just not enough new news, you know

[15:07] And look, this is not a podcast where we're like review games and you know maybe we should start doing some game reviews

[15:14] And I should start going out there in New York City and playing them more and giving you guys my reviews of these games

[15:20] And I should probably start doing that, I have a pinball podcast

[15:23] Speaking of reviews and Stern, really great review of the Lord the Rings pinball by straight down the middle

[15:31] They put it up this week

[15:33] I have to take a little bit of grain of salt because Zach who I love, I mean the guy has got like Houdini and Pirate of the Caribbean in his top 10

[15:42] I mean that to me almost like, come on, really Houdini is like Houdini he's got as like the third best game he's reviewed

[15:49] I can't, I can't, I'll just stop there, we all know he loves the magic of Houdini

[15:56] Alright, let's go to Jersey Jack Pinball

[15:59] So, Jersey Jack Pinball, there's a thread that is Willy Wonka speculation

[16:05] And there's no one knows anything about Wonka at all other than people think it's gonna be a great theme for Pinball

[16:13] I'm not sold that Willy Wonka is next, we talked about it

[16:17] If Eric is the designer of Wonka and he started on this pin like in April

[16:23] I can't imagine this is in front of Toy Story

[16:28] Now look, I think we've said it before

[16:31] There is more enthusiasm for Willy Wonka and Toy Story than there is for Pirates of the Caribbean

[16:38] And you know why? Because here we are, it is September 26th

[16:45] And nobody is getting their Pirates of the Caribbean games in their homes

[16:52] If you go to the Jersey Jack Pinball, Pirates of the Caribbean club, you know the owner's thread

[16:59] It's only four pages long

[17:02] It is being beaten by the P3 Multimorphic club which has six pages long

[17:09] When you're losing out in terms of unboxings to P3 Multimorphic, something is wrong Jack

[17:17] Where are the games?

[17:19] You know the rumor that oh there's a bunch going overseas, they're headed here, they're headed there

[17:25] It is almost October

[17:28] Which makes it almost one year to the date we first saw it and people are still not getting the games

[17:37] Now I don't know what the hold up is

[17:40] I really don't

[17:41] We would have thought that after all this time, Jersey Jack could figure production out

[17:48] It just feels like they can't get production going at the level that makes people happy

[17:56] And I think the problem people have with this is when you see this delay and you see all the time it took

[18:03] And they've been added now for six years plus

[18:06] You're kind of just like when are they ever going to figure it out?

[18:11] Like you know what I'm saying? Like why would we think the next title will be different?

[18:16] Why would we think toy story or wanka will come out in a faster time frame?

[18:23] Like they've never shown they can do it and it's just kind of getting comical

[18:28] Like this is actually a step backward

[18:31] Dialed in, shipped to consumers much faster after reveal than pirates of the Caribbean

[18:39] And so you know I want to read something that someone wrote on Pinside

[18:43] And they wrote this, okay? And this sort of just encapsulates where a lot of owners heads are at

[18:49] And he wrote, I'm a day one pre-order and I was told late October or November now

[18:56] But that was just a guess

[18:58] I was told they're currently doing a big overseas run

[19:02] And they are going to start on US runs in October and beyond

[19:07] My distributor informed me that JJP still haven't fulfilled day one orders from October 2017

[19:16] As they have barely started shipping as yet except for distributors show games and some locations for the most part

[19:24] Alright, so there's where we're at

[19:28] I mean pirates of the Caribbean, it's funny it was in a bar in New York City, I can go play it

[19:32] A few distributors have it, it's been at some shows, there's going to be another stream of it

[19:38] I'm so sick of seeing this game streamed

[19:41] I feel like I've been watching, it feels like you've been watching this movie for like a year now

[19:46] But now the movie is officially released

[19:49] But I've been seeing it on the internet for a year

[19:52] I literally, I don't know, I saw the Kraken mode, whatever, I'm just, I'm kind of over

[19:59] I'm over the delay and I think those who are in on this game want their game

[20:04] Alright, that's it, we also heard that there is going to be another edition of the Wizard of Oz

[20:11] Which is actually a good thing that this game has sold so well for Jersey Jack

[20:17] That there's going to be a third, is it a third version?

[20:21] So you got the Emerald City, you've got the Standard Edition, you've got the Ruby Red Edition

[20:27] And now we're going to get the Yellow Brick Road Edition

[20:33] Now I have an exclusive on this one that you didn't hear from Head to Head Pinball

[20:38] You didn't hear from any of the other podcasts

[20:41] If you order the $12,500 collector's edition of the Yellow Brick Road Wizard of Oz game

[20:50] Do you know what you get with that?

[20:52] Jack will take a Yellow Brick and slam it into your crotch for $12,500

[20:59] So you know, I think that's a good deal, I think that's a good deal

[21:04] But look, in all seriousness, I am curious to see what this is other than just Yellow Trim

[21:12] Will there be new art, will there be a new topper?

[21:15] Will it be limited to like a thousand Yellow Brick Road editions?

[21:20] I think if Jack were smart in marketing, which I literally you can hear the pause and the hesitation

[21:28] I kind of think the marketing over there is always a jumbled mess

[21:33] He would probably be smart to, I don't know, do you limit it?

[21:37] Do you make only 500 Yellow Brick Road editions?

[21:40] But then do you piss off everyone else?

[21:42] Because you've made sort of like the Super Ellie

[21:46] Because the Ruby Red and Emerald City had a thousand made

[21:50] Or do you just say we're gonna make a thousand of these?

[21:53] Or do you just say we're gonna make an unlimited amount?

[21:56] I would have to assume that Wizard of Oz demand is that the lowest it's ever been since there's so many out there

[22:05] And you can still get ones pretty easily

[22:08] And you can get them for less than MSRP

[22:11] You can go get an Emerald City Wizard of Oz for pretty cheap

[22:15] I mean all things considered like you can get it for much less than $9,000

[22:19] So I think if Jack, I think that probably the smart thing to do is just say we're gonna make a thousand of these

[22:26] They're not limited other than, you know, because a thousand is not limited

[22:29] I mean I just can't get over anyone saying a thousand is limited of anything in Pimbal

[22:34] Alright, what else is going on? So dialed in collector's edition

[22:37] It sounds like they're actually going to do the Pat Lawler meal that was promised

[22:44] To people who bought the $12,000 and $5,000 collector's edition

[22:48] I think it's like an Italian dinner they're gonna have or lunch

[22:52] I know this because our... I'm Richie Wrench who seems to be obsessed with buying every single collector's edition Jack makes

[23:02] Has been hammering and hauling to get the damn meal

[23:06] Now for $12,500, you should get a meal at Perseille

[23:12] Or a Michelin Star restaurant with Pat Lawler

[23:16] I mean the collector's edition of dialed in was probably one of the most ill-conceived collector's editions ever

[23:22] I think people didn't even get their damn comic books that they were promised

[23:27] You know, you got a bunch of worthless shit

[23:29] You got like an ugly dialed in jacket that if you wore you would probably be the laughing stock of the bar

[23:36] But anyway, I think Jack's learned how to make the collector's editions a nicer sell

[23:41] Alright, moving on, let's talk about Chicago Gaming Company and Monster Bash Remake

[23:47] So, this game is still not out

[23:50] People thought it would be out by now

[23:53] People are saying now they're going to wait until Expo to reveal the game

[23:58] What is taking so long?

[24:01] To say the hype has left the building on this game

[24:05] Is a little bit of an understatement

[24:07] I think people are tired of waiting, but it's also like, what are you waiting for?

[24:11] It's the game's been out for like 20 years

[24:14] There's nothing really new you're gonna see

[24:17] Now what I think was happening

[24:19] And I want to read something that Yilo Bird wrote

[24:22] And Yilo Bird is the guy who does all these amazing mods

[24:25] He's created some of the coolest mods ever for Pinball

[24:28] I love his stuff on Batman 66

[24:30] Yilo Bird played

[24:33] He played Monster Bash Remake

[24:36] He was one of the people who signed the non-disclosure agreement

[24:40] Went over to Chicago Gaming and played the game

[24:44] And saw the LE, the collector's edition, or the classic edition, and the standard edition

[24:48] He saw everything they're doing

[24:51] And he signed a non-disclosure agreement

[24:53] Which for some reason he has decided to break

[24:56] It's amazing how people don't understand the point of signing an NDA

[25:02] It means you will not disclose what you saw

[25:06] And yet he goes on to disclose exactly what he saw

[25:11] Now I want to read what he wrote

[25:13] Because what I think he's doing, and I don't have a problem with it to be honest

[25:16] I think signing an NDA to play a Pinball machine is pretty stupid

[25:20] Especially a game that we already know

[25:22] Right, there's nothing secret here

[25:24] It's not like he went to go play the monsters or beetles

[25:27] Or October Fest and gave away

[25:30] You know, some mechanism that we haven't seen before

[25:32] It's an old game

[25:34] But he wrote this, and I want to read it

[25:36] He wrote

[25:37] In this example, having played them, I actually feel the base or middle

[25:43] Classic edition model will be the seller

[25:47] Without detail of what was offered

[25:49] I in no way see a value added in going to the LE over the others

[25:55] Unless the price bump is really low

[25:58] Which is doubtful

[26:00] Games are great, but I still see many way over hyping what they assume will be there

[26:06] Or what was done

[26:08] It's really nice just think original with a modern touch

[26:13] Only negative that we created on this forum

[26:17] The topper while nice was nowhere near the hype laid down on this forum

[26:23] Trust me on that

[26:25] Not even close to the wow we got with attack from Mars LE

[26:30] Again, just keeping expectations managed for a great product yes

[26:36] But don't expect a completely over the top design

[26:40] Or improvement other than the standard display we have all seen with attack from Mars

[26:46] A whole lot more should be dialed down

[26:49] Because other people are saying you're going to want the LE trust me like save your money

[26:55] So I heard the topper isn't that special

[26:57] I heard there's no movement in it like there is an attack from Mars remake

[27:01] I heard that it is just like static images of the monsters up there with lighting

[27:07] And that's it so it just feels like a basic topper

[27:10] I also hear there's like you know I don't think there's like a lot added in terms of toys to the play field itself

[27:17] You know there are some sculpts that modders have done in the past

[27:20] But I don't think it's going to come with that stuff

[27:23] And so you know it's also a thousand L.E.s

[27:27] And that just you know begs the question do I think a thousand monster bash remake L.E.s will sell

[27:33] You know I'm not sure I'm not sure anymore and I've been thinking about these delays

[27:38] And the pause in getting this game out

[27:41] And launching this game at the same time as monsters is stupid

[27:46] There's no way around that

[27:48] People will always want the new stuff

[27:51] I really don't care if you are a remake

[27:54] You are not going to deliver the same new experience that a monster will deliver

[28:01] And so you know look and you've heard me on this podcast say like the old games are the best

[28:06] And then here's an old game and you're saying don't get it

[28:09] It's just it's not new

[28:12] I want a new game that has like the Valley Williams world under glass with new coding

[28:17] You know there's people have said it

[28:19] You know the everyone knows that monster bash is a fun game

[28:24] But it's like also a very shallow game

[28:27] It's easy to beat and it's not going to deliver the depth that I think home collectors want in pinball machines

[28:36] You know tell them to the Arabian Knights

[28:38] I you know whenever I have some regrets in selling that game because it was just so gorgeous

[28:43] And I still think it's one of the most amazing pinball worlds under glass

[28:47] And it shoots so well and I love the mechs in it

[28:50] But it was just too shallow

[28:52] It was too shallow to own that game in a small collection

[28:57] In a big collection absolutely

[28:59] But in a small collection I got so bored of it so quickly

[29:04] So I just think these guys they messed up the delay is going to hurt them

[29:09] And I can't see them selling 1000 monster bash remakes alright

[29:14] So let's go on you have to go way down

[29:18] Way down on pinside to find the home pin thread

[29:22] I mean way down so all I know when I go into the home pin thread

[29:28] If it's still just a group of early buyers complaining they're not getting their games

[29:34] People looking for refunds

[29:37] I would say like the excitement around getting a thunderbirds is probably equal to the excitement of really finding a WWE LE on the used market

[29:50] I mean that is comparable

[29:53] I would probably rather have a WWE LE than a thunderbirds at this point

[29:58] I don't understand the concept of this game or why it's taken so long to come out

[30:05] And then all the arguing and the miscommunication and the seemingly endless debate about who's lying about where the early buyer games are

[30:15] And why they're not in Australia and who's saying what about shipping and legislation and that keeps games from being held up in customs

[30:27] It's the boringest thread you could possibly read which is why we'll move on to American pinball

[30:36] And that is we are a few weeks away from probably seeing October fest

[30:40] I will say this I sat down at dinner last night and I heard these dudes talking about October fest

[30:47] And I stood up I was at the Manetta tavern best burger in the city

[30:50] I said hey guys so you guys talking about the October fest pinball machine by American pinball

[30:55] And they picked their burger and they threw it right in my face

[30:58] Now I mean it is like October fest right the last week in September is when people start to celebrate October fest in America

[31:05] So great you know they kind of missed the timing to ship the game during the festival

[31:12] I look forward to seeing what they're doing

[31:15] As I've said deep root and American pinball to me have me very curious about what's next

[31:22] And I look that's not to say all right that I'm not super duper excited to see Munster's pinball

[31:31] Of course I'm always excited to see a new pinball machine of course I'm always excited to see what Stern comes up with next

[31:38] You know but it's like it's a little formula like but look I'd rather have a formula that actually works

[31:45] That actually ships games and actually keeps making pinball and keeps delivering new pinball into the world

[31:54] And there's no doubt about it I mean Stern just dominates pinball

[31:58] And I wish there was other competition that could actually do something that was you know on the same level

[32:07] I don't even mean like you know four or five games a year but why can't another pinball company just get their shit together and make a good game every year

[32:15] Once a year make a good game is that too much to ask I mean we wait so long and I just feel like so much comes up so short

[32:24] All right let me read your emails that I got and then we will call it a day how does that sound because I got a lot of feedback from you guys

[32:31] All right this first one is from Marty over at head to head pinball he says hey canada I love your show

[32:38] It continues to remain the most entertaining pinball podcast out there

[32:43] If you get a chance go over and listen to head to head pinball because I did an entire one hour interview talking about pin stadium lights

[32:52] Keep up the good work and I look forward to every episode I'm hitting refresh right now

[33:10] If I want to stand oh I'll get another stone

[33:13] All right so let's go to some real emails here so Brian L now Brian was the one who inspired me to do the whole pinball is devolving

[33:23] Podcast now he responded and he said hey man just listen to the podcast and you nailed my points dead on I love pinball and I think stern games are fun they are average

[33:34] To good but good is not worth the price that they charge and I totally agree about using modern day programming to enhance the games

[33:43] People cheer today's pinball coding but more so for scoring complexities that they encompass give me code that includes multiple rule sets for one machine

[33:54] Heck release a sequel to a game that utilizes the same play field but a different code and set with new objectives like a video game

[34:03] Thanks for the shout out Brian all right Brian we'll look like I agree that I think that there's too much emphasis on

[34:13] Making sure that the code you know the scoring is balanced that is too for the most part I think it piece the tournament players

[34:21] And I do agree that you can completely refresh a pinball game with new code and it can it could breathe a new life into an old design

[34:32] People have had for a long time and I also I said this before I think they should charge if they go through all that hard work

[34:40] To re code a game right not finish a game that you already paid for but let's say they take a game like I don't know like tron

[34:50] And they code in they re they vault edition it and code in elements from the first tron movie into the game

[34:59] Now you know and but you can buy it like you could buy original tron game to install first sort of an amount of money

[35:08] No one's ever done that and I do think there is an option for pinball to move in that direction where people would actually pay for

[35:15] Updated codes and I think that's what Chicago gaming should have done with monster bash

[35:20] The sort of similar to what they did with medieval madness remake when they you know they actually charge people for the updated display

[35:27] Because they had to do all that work to do that like work that work should not be for free

[35:33] Alright I got an email from Dave Sanders Dave thank you for emailing me he said an interesting episode

[35:40] This is about pinball devolving couldn't really tell if any of it might have come from possibly entering into one of your occasional

[35:48] Jaded phases but there were a lot of points to process I think one of the key words is imagination

[35:55] And that along with good gameplay is what people want to pay for stern are realizing this and are finding different ways to

[36:05] Economize to bring this about certainly with examples like LCD displays that takes a lot more resources time and expense to make that look effective

[36:19] Compared to a DMD that you're not really giving credit for alright I'd rather like to come on the show again and have a conversation about some of these points

[36:30] Look Dave I will happily have you back on the show here's the thing like I do agree that it takes a lot more work to code these LCD screens

[36:39] But they're charging a lot more for these games for the most part and what we're seeing on these LCDs

[36:46] Okay this isn't like mind blowing programming going on I mean literally you can't tell me that you can't go to all these schools that have programmers

[36:57] And kids making video games and all the freaking thousands of coders out there who know how to do this stuff

[37:05] And find some of them to apply what they know to a pinball game I just failed to buy this notion that pinball coding is this like mystery art

[37:18] That only a handful of people on planet earth can figure out I don't buy it I really don't buy it at all

[37:24] And we know that stern has invested a lot more in hiring coders

[37:30] Now where the magic lies because anyone can get something to light up and get numbers on a screen and put clips on a screen

[37:39] The magic lies in understanding the symmetry and how to get all those things to talk to each other simultaneously in a way that makes the experience magical

[37:53] And to that point there are only a handful of people who really truly know how to do that with a pinball machine

[38:02] Number one being Lyman sheets I don't think there'd be any argument there

[38:08] Alright let's go on to some more of these I got an email from RCD

[38:15] I don't know who this is

[38:17] It says Bally William Games reality check and he writes you make a lot of assumptions about past Bally Williams games like they never had quality issues built like tanks etc

[38:29] You even held up the big Lebowski like it was an example of a great game

[38:34] But as we know the owners experienced many issues out of the box some never fixed Bally Williams built a lot of turds by today's standards

[38:44] Horrible artwork, terrible themes, horrendous music and callouts, shallow rule sets, boring gameplay

[38:51] But it didn't matter because they were designed and survived eight months to a year on location and then thrown in the trash

[38:58] By default any Bally Williams game that you play today are the titles that have survived the test of time and has had all the issues fixed

[39:08] So yeah of course they are classic and bulletproof

[39:12] As you said before Stern, Data East, Sega have always been the lower cost, lower quality, less feature alternative to Bally Williams games and that is still true

[39:22] Today the closest thing you can get to a Bally Williams like game is made by Jersey Jack or American Pinball

[39:28] Get ready for a cargument

[39:29] Pinball machines are like hand-built Italian cars

[39:32] They are beautiful works of art but each one has its own individual set of problems and unreliable because they are built by humans in low volume

[39:42] I think where we are in the golden age of Pinball and building a machine that checks all the boxes is like creating lightning in a bottle

[39:51] I for one I am happy to be alive and able to enjoy every game for what it has to offer

[39:57] Alright well RC thank you for that and look on some level we all enjoy just the art of playing Pinball

[40:05] I would say that look if you released Bally Williams games into homes and never into our caves

[40:15] Of course I think they would last because they were designed to take immense beating and pounding and repetitive play

[40:22] You ever see like a Stern game at a barca that is very crowded?

[40:27] They are beat to shit but ever going to a homeowners house and see his collection of Stern games they look brand new

[40:35] It is just the nature of Pinball right?

[40:37] Still why I don't get I never understand why people don't play full protector is on games anyway

[40:42] The point is this you are right these are handmade games by humans but I don't think it should be like lightning in a bottle to get all the boxes checked

[40:54] When you are a company like Jersey Jack you are taking an in an ordinary amount of time to make sure all the boxes are checked

[41:06] That will make a great classic game I don't see any point in Jersey Jack having hits and misses with what they know

[41:16] And what all these companies know I think we know enough now about what makes a great Pinball game great

[41:26] We do we have all the games from yesterday years to look at we have all the modern games to look at is it hard to figure out all the crucial boxes to check to make a great pinball game I don't think so

[41:42] I don't think anyone should go into making Pinball games in 2018 unless they know how to check all those boxes

[41:50] And yes some of the stuff is subjective but I think Jersey Jack where it just kills me is they always sort of kind of almost get there but they never quite do

[42:02] And they are the ones that I hold up with the highest expectations because the whole company is focused on making one game great

[42:14] One at a time not for not five like Stern one game great and I just think they always come up short and that to me is why I'm always frustrated more with them than I am with Stern

[42:30] And why Stern games you know get to where they get to because Stern makes their games good enough to sell because when they go to market there's nothing else really new for sale

[42:41] They have no competition if Jersey Jack was cranking games out if Pirates of the Caribbean was cranking out since March if toy story was revealed if Wonka was there if these games were real if they had guns and roses if they had real games coming out with real cadence

[42:59] I guarantee you it would make Stern have to up the Annie it would but they don't need to because they can just sit back and watch Jersey Jack once again flop when it comes to bringing a game to market completely fuck up how you bring a game to market

[43:16] All right all right let me keep going I got an email from Eddie said Bud Light had lots of Bud Light last night and extra one for you riding high and Cleveland right now I'm happy you guys finally won a game it was fun to see Browns fans celebrating like they won the Super Bowl but it was the first win in a few years all right let's see all right

[43:40] Archage and Nanaghan's see people you guys write long emails it's hard for me to read all these he said hey man enjoying the podcast as always I've been thinking along the same lines for a bit and put it bluntly where I landed for me anyway was

[43:56] Subjectively if current pinball isn't as good as Bali Williams Golden Age titles then why even fuck around with the new stuff as home game room enthusiast my current lineup is Williams and Anna Jones start track the next generation medieval madness attack from Mars scared stiff tells the Caribbean Knights all right

[44:16] All right he writes being a new inbox pinball buyer funnels you into pinside and the pinball community noise machine at large for me at least it's more harmonious existence in the hobby not saying I won't buy another stern but I will say I'm ready to let the community beta test that shit for me

[44:35] also I'm going to go ahead and call monsters a failure on timing alone Halloween is a big deal for people I know we typically host 80 plus pinheads for Halloween block party yada yada yada if they ship these monsters machines in time for the season they align with they're gonna get more games sold okay so look I think this is from build the bill here's a deal I don't think

[45:04] that monsters not coming out before Halloween matters at all because I don't I don't think that stern gives a shit about how like nobody out there nobody it's like you have your see you're thinking too small about this nobody ever goes to someone's Halloween party and says oh man I really wish you had a Halloween themed pinball machine right now nobody

[45:33] and if it's Halloween I don't think people are playing scared stiff more than iron maiden or Deadpool right now or pirate to the Caribbean okay I don't I think that's I just don't think these expensive pinball machines need to align with like seasonality stuff like that now where I do think companies fuck up is if you have a pinball machine based on a movie like the

[46:03] Hobbit you should release your pinball machine in conjunction with when the marketing hype and the enthusiasm is is alive and well for that title you know the same way when stern miss getting star wars out for the star wars celebration you know like it maybe

[46:22] it hurts a little bit you know they didn't get to go to all the star wars conventions and comic cons with it but ultimately I still think what we've learned time and time again is that these pinball people will buy this stuff regardless of any of that they're just addicted to buying every new inbox game all right I got an email from Steve Paradis he said can a don't give a F you C case I can a what's going on man I'm a regular listener to your show there are a few reasons I

[46:52] listen to your show one can a dozen give a fuck you say what you want to say I live the same way and yes it often gets me in hot water number two sometimes you really make me laugh or say damn I often hear you say it's pinball people

[47:07] meaning get a grip it's supposed to be fun I agree this leads me to my email more of your podcasts have been straight up negative from start to finish the last one

[47:16] ended I unconsciously gave out a sigh I felt like I just got beat down mostly I agree we want more for our money and prices are out of control one thing though pinballs were always expensive two to three thousand back in the day for instance I rented a house in 1995 when I was 18 years old three beds two bass I paid 600 a month the house sold for 80 thousand dollars to rent that house now is

[47:46] two thousand dollars a month and cost three hundred and twenty five thousand dollars everything is two to three times more I've never been a fan of stern I was so pissed off when Williams went under and that company was all that was left I stopped loving pinball for a long time the

[48:04] early game now is stupid I do believe that there has been some great innovation yes I really want more to come for instance when Jersey Jack came out the wizard of Oz you can say whatever you want about gameplay and coding when I first saw it and played it I was just blown away massive smile on my face I really it really was a world under glass with a ton of innovation

[48:29] led light show like never before huge led screen crystal ball hologram amazing three model plastics most recently the t-name machine no one ever incorporated sound into a machine like that before it's awesome I love it more importantly my wife loves it it's the first new box pinball I ever purchased I guess what I'm saying is keep doing what you do but damn don't make me feel like I got my ass kicked after listening to your show you have you often have

[48:59] some positive things to say I love the episode with a deep root guy maybe we can pull off what we are looking for or maybe they can pull off sorry or maybe they eat shit I don't expect the pinball bubble the pop at some point Steve from Philly PA well Steve thank you for the email and I agree to man I feel like there wasn't a lot of news I feel like I was getting a little overly reflective about the hobby

[49:27] and I do apologize if the shows did get a little melodramatic and I heard from people like lots of people I got like all these text messages from Ed Robertson just just being like what are you talking about bro like you don't get it like the stern games are fucking fun like that ballet William stuff just gets boring throw it in the trash look the answer my friend

[49:56] is blowing in the way no the answer is in the middle somewhere and again again the if stern and jersey jack would just unite they could just create the greatest pinball machines ever instead what will probably happen is turn on just end up putting jersey jack out of business because they can't seem to get it right all right let me get one more email that I'm letting you guys go because I gotta get to work holy cow it's 845

[50:24] all right let's see

[50:25] um to do to do to do okay I'm gonna just do Tim went said airplane have you checked out the airplane home brew machine great theme there's some things that need to be fixed but it looks good

[50:41] the loop toy in the call out to our hilarious so I did see a little bit of that airplane home brew game there's a lot of cool home brew projects going on there's a ghost in the show on that school there's this guy making his head to head game

[50:55] and no it's not Marty and one side and Ryan on the other it's like a game where you like you think it's connected and players are on each side of the game really cool like the old joust machine

[51:05] um I think airplane school I haven't seen too much of that video I do love the home brew market I think what's interesting to me about the home brew market is if you make an amazing home brew game

[51:16] I think now you will have the attention of companies like deeproot and spooky I think in other companies out there like american pinball who could potentially buy your design and manufacture the game

[51:32] I mean total nuclear annihilation a home brew game is spooky pinballs best selling pinball machine ever

[51:41] you can take that to the bank I think we're gonna see more of that everyone have a great day we'll talk to you soon

[52:02] yeah
