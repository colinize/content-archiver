[00:00] Alright, it's Toy Story 4, Canada's got some thoughts, let's just hit the intro music.

[00:05] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA

[00:09] Ah, where do I start?

[00:13] Where do I start with my first impressions of Toy Story 4 from Jersey Jack Pinball?

[00:19] How do I even begin to give you my impressions of this game?

[00:23] The decision to make it on the fourth movie?

[00:26] The fact that it doesn't look like there's a ton in it, I mean I'm looking at it, and I'm seeing not even drop targets, just stand up targets in a Jersey Jack game.

[00:39] We know, we know there could be more mechanically in this game, but look, I haven't played the game.

[00:45] It looks like it's fun to flip, and that's always the default people, it's colorful, it's got some fun shots in it, definitely it's got some fun shots in it.

[00:54] It's gonna light up like a Christmas tree, we can tell you that.

[00:58] But where is the magic mechanically? I think that's gonna be one of the main things people think when they look at this game for the first time.

[01:06] But let me go over what happened, so just like a few minutes ago, I'm in Ireland right now, and it's 9 o'clock in the morning, which means it's 4am in Eastern Standard Time.

[01:17] And this is 8 hours away from when the big order bank and reveal was supposed to happen.

[01:23] Now apparently someone is like, hack the JJP website, it wasn't me, I can safely say it wasn't me, so don't send your lawyers my way.

[01:32] But they were able to grab the 22 or so images from Jersey Jack's website and also the video.

[01:39] Now I'm watching the video right now, and I wanted to say this, you need to know your target audience.

[01:45] You need to know your target audience, and so if we look at the demographic of Pinball, there's no denying the fact that Pinball is comprised primarily of men 40 to 60 years of age.

[01:57] And I was a little taken aback that when I watched the Toy Story video, what is it? It's a man and his daughter, I hope it's his daughter, this guy's going to jail.

[02:06] So she runs up to the machine and she points at it all enthusiastically, like oh look at that world under glass, and the dad is just smiling, he's perfectly groomed, he looks really happy.

[02:19] And she is beyond excited, I mean I've never seen a pinball machine make a, she looks like a teenage girl this excited before, then we get this overhead shot and it's the world of Toy Story.

[02:29] Now it does definitely feel like a Pat Lawler game, so then I'm looking down at this game and I'm seeing a pretty much wide open play field.

[02:38] I mean the center of this game is pretty wide open and then the first thing I noticed and I'm like you know what, people are going to ding them for this.

[02:46] I see this like spinning wheel on the left side of the game that looks like it's the same exact wheel that's saying guns and roses.

[02:54] It looks like they took the record from GNR and just put a different decal on it and I was like oh, that doesn't look like an original new mech, that doesn't look that interesting because it's just a spinning wheel.

[03:07] It also is probably the same size wheel and I mean this, this probably is the same part that is the center wheel in Pirates of the Caribbean which was taken from Pat Lawler's world win.

[03:18] And that's okay and all, but I think the pinball people out there at this price point are looking for something a lot more creative than just a spinning wheel.

[03:28] And then we've got Bo Peep who's just glued on, looks like a static figure glued on to an entryway and then there's a target bank to the left, but there's not much really happening on that left side of the game.

[03:41] And then there's like something above Bo Peep, it looks like lumber, snacks or something like that.

[03:47] It looks eerily similar to what's in Willy Wonka right there.

[03:51] Like there's that part in Willy Wonka that I think it's the Wonka factory.

[03:55] It's actually in the exact same position as the Wonka factory.

[04:00] And I'm just starting to wonder now, are we starting to see Jersey Jack Pinball be a little bit more like Stern recycling parts, making it easier for them to use things multiple times.

[04:12] And then you pan across and there is a scoop in the middle of the game in the upper center of the game.

[04:18] Then there seems to be like this big screen that's in the upper left of this game that just looks like an iPad that is just dropped on top of the game.

[04:27] And I know that screen turns into like a miniature pinball machine, but it's an LCD screen.

[04:33] And to me, and I'm just going to say it, when you start dropping screens into pinball machines as play field areas, because that's what it turns into, we are starting to lose what makes pinball pinball.

[04:46] I mean, think about it, we went from having like miniature pinball in Family Guy that was like a physical pinball experience.

[04:53] We got a miniature bowling alley in the Big Lebowski, a miniature play field in the Munsters, and now we're just sticking a screen on top of a pinball machine.

[05:04] And it is blocking the entire upper left section of the game.

[05:08] Now look, it's going to look cool. It's going to draw people in for sure.

[05:13] And it's going to light up really nicely, but it's also nothing mechanical.

[05:18] The girl plunges the ball and we can see now that there is obviously going to be like modes on that screen in the upper left.

[05:24] And then to the right seems to be like where all the interesting stuff in this game is happening.

[05:29] Then you pan over and it looks like there's a scoop, which is the antique shop. The screen is behind it.

[05:34] Then it looks like there's the Ferris wheel and then there's Ducky and Bunny.

[05:38] Now, here's my big question about this game because I hope and I'm not sure I hope that Ducky and Bunny actually move and are animated somehow.

[05:47] If they're just stuck there statically, I think it's a big miss.

[05:52] And again, people, remember this is Toy Story from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[05:56] Shouldn't our expectations be really high?

[05:59] We had Smaug talking to us and talking right at the player and moving his mouth how many years ago.

[06:06] And I'm just looking at this game and I'm like, where is Woody in physical form?

[06:11] Where is Buzz Lightyear in physical form? Buzz is in the back right of the game.

[06:16] Alright, so we got the scoop, which is the antique shop.

[06:18] Then to the right of that, we've got Gabby Gabby, you know, the doll in the film.

[06:23] She pops up from under the play field, just like one of those cave trolls in the Hobbit.

[06:28] So she's there and then there's a flap to the right of her, which is a Duke Kaboom ramp that pops up that you shoot and launch the ball into the air.

[06:35] So that looks like a fun shot.

[06:37] So it's interesting next to the Duke Kaboom ramp, there are two posts that pop up from the play field to keep you not going off that ramp at an awkward angle.

[06:45] So that's interesting because they don't want you to probably fly and break the screen in the upper left.

[06:50] So it keeps the ball going in the right direction.

[06:52] But again, like where's the big mechanical wow?

[06:55] A pop-up head, a ramp that lifts up, a big LCD screen, four pop bumpers.

[07:01] There's no Ferris wheel that moves.

[07:03] There's no big Benson in this game.

[07:06] We kept thinking like he put Rudy in Funhouse.

[07:09] Are we going to see something similar in Toy Story 4?

[07:12] It's not there.

[07:13] Like I just don't see it there.

[07:15] And then the upper right flipper is that tiny little miniature flipper that Pat Lawler likes to use, which is not as fun as a full-size upper flipper.

[07:24] And I think Ducky and Bunny are static.

[07:27] I'm looking up the video right now.

[07:28] I don't think they do anything.

[07:30] I think they're just put there.

[07:31] We've got the topper on the CE, which is the circus tent.

[07:34] You see the Ferris wheel and you see fireworks apparently.

[07:38] And then there's Duke Kaboom sort of rotates around.

[07:40] So that's what the topper is on the CE.

[07:43] So I just watched the video again and I'm looking at the photos of this machine and I'm saying to myself, Chris,

[07:48] and I'm looking at the stuff happening in the game.

[07:51] And I think it looks fun to shoot, but I want to say right now, my first impressions of seeing Toy Story 4,

[07:59] what I thought would be Pat Lawler's swan song that would have everything in it, that would have something wow in this game.

[08:06] If I put this game next to dialed in, this game looks much, much more empty.

[08:12] And it's becoming pretty clear what's happening.

[08:14] There's no subway in this game.

[08:16] There's nothing mechanically that feels like we're seeing something that hasn't been done before.

[08:21] Right?

[08:22] Isn't that the whole point of pinball?

[08:24] Isn't that the whole point of why we love pinball is you want to see stuff in these games each time

[08:29] that brings true creativity to the mix.

[08:33] And as I look at this game and as I see what's going on in Toy Story 4,

[08:37] I'm not seeing anything that screams, oh my gosh, how did they do that?

[08:43] Oh my gosh, you got to see this.

[08:45] I think there's going to be a lot of lights.

[08:47] I think there's going to be a lot of color, but I don't think there's going to be anything.

[08:51] I mean it, anything in this game that makes you go, wow, did you see that?

[08:57] Now again, I haven't played it.

[08:59] I haven't experienced it.

[09:00] It's going to shoot like Pat Lawler smooth.

[09:03] It's going to be a buttery smooth Pat Lawler shooter, but on first glance of Toy Story 4,

[09:09] Canada is somewhat disappointed.

[09:12] In fact, I'm a lot disappointed and I'll tell you why, because not only am I disappointed that this is based on only Toy Story 4,

[09:21] like I have to be honest, all of us out there, our nostalgia, our love affair with Toy Story is based on Toy Story 1.

[09:31] That is the movie we grew up falling in love with.

[09:34] That is the movie that have the best storyline.

[09:37] That is the movie 99.9% of pinball fanatics relate to a young boy and his love of toys.

[09:46] Toy Story 4 is not about a young boy and his love of toys.

[09:49] It's about the little girl and how she creates 4K.

[09:52] And it was more of a tear-jerker Toy Story 4.

[09:55] It didn't leave an indelible impression with all of us.

[09:58] It wasn't the movie we would go to when we want to watch our favorite Toy Story.

[10:03] In fact, everyone out there, if you're honest, this probably would be the last Toy Story you would watch.

[10:09] And so this is the thing, right?

[10:11] This is the marketing question I have, is if you're going to go to Disney and you want to make Toy Story pinball and you want to celebrate the franchise,

[10:19] why would you ink a deal for just the fourth movie?

[10:22] And not only that, then timing matters.

[10:25] So you ink the deal for the fourth movie.

[10:27] It came out in 2019.

[10:30] You're now releasing the pinball machine in 2022.

[10:35] How many of you have watched Toy Story 4 multiple times?

[10:40] How many of you know the lines in that movie like you do the first movie?

[10:44] How many of you remember those scenes?

[10:46] I gotta be honest, I saw Toy Story 4 like once.

[10:49] And I went back last night and I watched all the highlight clips from the movie.

[10:54] And I was almost like, I don't even remember any of this.

[10:56] Because barely any of it leaves an indelible impression.

[11:00] And I think that this being based on only Toy Story 4 is going to be a bummer for a lot of people.

[11:08] I also think because the price of this game is going to be around $15,000.

[11:14] I don't think there's going to be this, oh my gosh, take my money now, no questions asked.

[11:20] I think the only way they're really going to sell out instantly now, and I mean this,

[11:24] I don't think this can be a thousand unit CE at $15,000.

[11:30] I just don't see the value there.

[11:32] I really don't.

[11:33] And I know there's going to be a lot of cool stuff on the screen.

[11:37] I know there's going to be a lot of great lights and all this and that,

[11:41] but there's not the mechanical pinball machine here in front of our faces

[11:46] that says this is a game with a high bomb.

[11:49] And if you lift the hood on a dialed in and then lift the hood on this,

[11:53] they're going to seem worlds apart.

[11:56] Dialed in is a game that had everything Pat wanted in it, and it was a game that was just packed.

[12:03] And it was also a game when it came out, you could get dialed in easily for like $9,500.

[12:10] And now you're saying a game with less in it is going to cost $12,000 for the LE

[12:16] and $15,000 possibly for the collector's edition.

[12:21] That's the other thing when you look at this game, there's really not that like,

[12:25] I see a $3,000 difference between the LE and the CE.

[12:30] In fact, I think many of you out there are going to prefer the LE

[12:34] because there's a lot more Buzz Lightyear on the artwork and he's on the back box

[12:39] and it's the blue Buzz Lightyear color.

[12:41] So I just feel a little underwhelmed.

[12:45] Now the question for me is this, am I still going to get one?

[12:50] Am I going to buy a collector's edition of Toy Story?

[12:54] And the answer is yes, I'm going to get one.

[12:56] I'm going to get one, I'm not going to pass on it.

[12:58] I do want to put this next to Guns N' Roses, but I'm going to be completely honest.

[13:03] I'm backing up into this purchase.

[13:05] I'm not running towards it.

[13:06] I'm backing up into it.

[13:08] I'm sort of reluctantly handing over $15,000.

[13:11] I'm not enthusiastically throwing $15,000 at this.

[13:16] I don't think this is a game that every single pinhead out there is going to be clawing over each other to get.

[13:21] I do think the Disney fan base and for all the families out there who buy pinball machines,

[13:27] this is a great theme for pinball.

[13:29] It's going to sell really well.

[13:31] You know, as much as I'm like a little bummed out because I'm not seeing mechanical magic

[13:35] and I have to let go of Toy Story 1 and Pizza Planet,

[13:39] I mean what bums me out the most is I have to let go of my love of Toy Story 1

[13:43] and all of the iconic scenes from that movie.

[13:46] That's what we love.

[13:47] You know, we love like Pizza Planet.

[13:49] We love the aliens, the claw machine.

[13:52] Where is Buzz Lightyear spreading his wings saying to Infinity and beyond?

[13:57] None of that.

[13:58] None of that is the fourth movie.

[14:00] The fourth movie is just kind of sad.

[14:03] It's like this sad story of trying to get Forky back to his human owner.

[14:08] Like it's just not fun.

[14:09] It's not this fun ride.

[14:11] It is a much more slow and emotional ride.

[14:15] You don't have the evil Emperor like Zorg.

[14:17] You don't have like the Army men.

[14:19] You don't have any of that stuff.

[14:20] You don't have Sid blowing up toys.

[14:22] You don't have like Buzz Lightyear and Mrs. Nez Bed.

[14:25] I think I'm, I hope I'm getting these names right.

[14:27] But everything in that first movie, like every scene,

[14:30] lends itself so perfectly to pinball and yet here we are with Forky.

[14:36] So here's the mistake I think Jersey Jack made.

[14:39] I think if Jersey Jack knew they were making Toy Story 4,

[14:42] which they knew they should have let people know a long time ago.

[14:46] Just rip the band-aid off.

[14:48] Let us get over it.

[14:50] Let us watch the fourth movie again and find new ways to love it and enjoy it.

[14:56] And I think they should have done it.

[14:58] I think they should have realized, hey look,

[15:00] if we're making this based on Toy Story 4 and everyone knows we're making a Toy Story game,

[15:04] maybe it would be smart for us to manage expectations

[15:08] because we know people like the first three movies so much.

[15:12] And this one is the newer one, like it came out in 2019.

[15:16] Why don't we do this?

[15:17] Why don't we say, coming soon, Toy Story 4 from Jersey Jack Pinball,

[15:22] we encourage all of you to watch the movie

[15:24] and you're going to see everything you love in that movie in this pinball machine.

[15:27] I mean, I think that would have been a way to sort of at least rip the band-aid off

[15:32] and let people like warm up to it.

[15:34] But now on the very day you're asking for all this money,

[15:38] I do think this is somewhat of a marketing bombshell that's going to land on people.

[15:42] This isn't the Toy Story people want.

[15:44] For me, the bigger concern is this.

[15:46] I think Jersey Jack Pinball is moving towards Stern.

[15:49] And I think they're taking stuff out of games.

[15:52] I don't think they're ever going to make games as packed, as Wizard of Oz,

[15:56] as dialed in, as pired to the Caribbean.

[15:58] I think this is the new Jersey Jack Pinball.

[16:01] They want to be able to make two games a year.

[16:04] The only way they're going to get there is if they make their games simpler.

[16:09] But here's the big problem for Jersey Jack.

[16:11] You can't simplify this brand now.

[16:14] You can't go backwards and then charge more money.

[16:17] And I think there's going to be a real awakening today

[16:20] because for a lot of you out there,

[16:22] when you're looking at what's happening in the stock market,

[16:24] when you look at how your money's evaporated,

[16:26] do you really want to run and throw $15,000 or $12,000 at machines

[16:32] that aren't really pushing Pinball forward?

[16:35] And in a lot of ways, like Jersey Jack told us,

[16:37] when he made Wizard of Oz, he said,

[16:39] this will be my worst machine.

[16:41] Remember what Jack said, that every machine after Wizard of Oz

[16:45] is going to have more in it.

[16:46] And you have to be completely blind to put Wizard of Oz

[16:51] next to Toy Story and tell me that Toy Story has more in it.

[16:56] And all I'm asking is you lift the play field on the Jersey Jack games.

[17:00] And you're going to see those first four games are just packed.

[17:04] And you lift the play field on Wonka, Guns N' Roses and Toy Story.

[17:09] And this is a much more simplified company.

[17:13] They're putting a lot less in the games

[17:15] and they're using lights and other tricks to make them visually pop.

[17:20] But when it comes to the physical Pinball magic everybody really wants,

[17:24] when it comes to the world under glass, everybody's craving,

[17:27] when it comes to the magic, oh my gosh, did you see it do that?

[17:31] I'm not sure it's delivering that.

[17:33] In fact, I know there's a lot less in these games.

[17:36] And so I do not think that this game is going to meet or exceed our expectations.

[17:42] I think they are going to make videos explaining to us

[17:46] why it's the most innovative game, but our eyes are not going to deceive us.

[17:50] We are not seeing anything in this game

[17:53] that seems physically more impressive than what's in the big Lebowski.

[17:57] And let me remind everybody, the big Lebowski came out nine years ago.

[18:02] Nine years ago.

[18:04] Are you seeing anything in Toy Story other than screens and lights

[18:08] that physically and mechanically is more impressive than a physical bowling alley,

[18:13] than a rug that rolls out that you bash?

[18:16] You know, we're still seeing the same stuff.

[18:18] Gabby Gabby is a head that pops up that you bash.

[18:20] Saw that in medieval madness.

[18:22] Saw that in Hobbit.

[18:24] Nothing new there.

[18:25] I don't know what the issue is.

[18:26] I just keep feeling like these Baldy Williams engineers made these designers who they are.

[18:32] I think without them, this doesn't have stuff as cool as the Adams family or Twilight Zone.

[18:37] And I think that's my final conclusion on all of these guys.

[18:41] I think the old pedigree, the old luminaries of pinball, the pioneers of pinball design

[18:47] who gave us the greatest games ever.

[18:49] I think they all stood on the shoulders of Baldy Williams engineers

[18:54] and that's why we love them.

[18:56] And Brian Eddy did it.

[18:57] Pat Lawler did it.

[18:59] John Papadook did it.

[19:00] And when you look at what they make when they're not with Baldy Williams,

[19:03] it just doesn't feel the same.

[19:05] So this is Kaneda signing off for now.

[19:07] We'll see more about this game, but my first impressions, I'm underwhelmed.

[19:12] I'm not blown away.

[19:14] I'm not seeing something that says take my money now.

[19:17] Probably still gonna buy it.

[19:19] I'm gonna back up into it.

[19:21] And I don't think this is a game that's gonna be flipped for 20 or $25,000.

[19:26] I think the scalpers are gonna wake up and realize this is not the game

[19:30] that's gonna jump 10 grand in value.

[19:32] It's just not.

[19:33] And as I said before, I think Guns N' Roses is just the cooler pin now.

[19:38] I think it's gonna be the one in the long term.

[19:41] If I were gonna go buy a CE, I would buy the one where there's only 500.

[19:46] I think if they announced there's a thousand CEs of this game,

[19:49] I don't think it's gonna sell out in one day.

[19:52] Not at 15,000.

[19:54] Not if this is what's in the game.

[19:56] No drop targets.

[19:58] Really?

[19:59] No drop targets in a $15,000 pinball machine.

[20:03] Everybody, Kaneda's out.

[20:05] I'll talk to you a lot more today.

[20:07] I've been up, man.

[20:08] I've been up.

[20:09] Killian's been crying all night.

[20:10] I haven't had any sleep.

[20:11] And you're sleeping right now in America dreaming that Tolley's story is gonna be the most amazing pin ever

[20:16] because Kaneda told you so.

[20:17] But man, it was up to them.

[20:19] I set the bar high.

[20:20] I had high expectations because it's Tolley's story.

[20:23] But Tolley's story 4, with a lot of screens and a lot of lights,

[20:26] but not a lot of mechanical stuff going on, it doesn't seem.

[20:29] So everybody, we'll see what the reaction is,

[20:31] but I think it's gonna be pretty mixed and somewhat brutal later.
