[00:00] Everybody was comfortable fighting.

[00:04] Those cats were fast as lightning.

[00:09] And faculty a little bit by name.

[00:14] About to talk with expert timing.

[00:17] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:21] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] Happy Friday, everybody.

[00:26] We are getting closer and closer to Pinball Expo.

[00:29] I want to thank each and every one of you for being a Canada Club member.

[00:32] We are at 618 club members.

[00:35] All those efforts to cancel Canada has once again worked in Canada's favor.

[00:40] I also want to say thank you to everyone who has been increasing your subscription amount.

[00:45] Had a lot of people go from $5 to $10.

[00:48] I'm going to give everybody a shout out.

[00:49] I just need to figure out how to do this because there's so many of you.

[00:52] I think I'm going to do a special show on Facebook Live.

[00:55] I'm also going to do this starting to thank everybody who's a member and who has up their increase for Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:02] Someone said to me, they're like, Chris, it's just 50 cents a day to give you $15 a month.

[01:08] And I like it when you break it down like that.

[01:10] So let's talk about Pinball Expo coming up.

[01:12] Everybody's going to be kung fu fighting.

[01:15] Everybody's going to be fighting for the attention of the pinball buying community.

[01:19] We saw this at Texas Pinball Festival.

[01:22] Stern won that battle before the show even began.

[01:25] With the Foo Fighter game.

[01:27] We got Jersey Jack's Godfather, which flopped.

[01:30] We got American Pinball's Galactic Tank Force that flopped.

[01:33] What else did we get at that show?

[01:35] We got Pulp Fiction, which seemingly won over the pinball community.

[01:39] But here we are, people.

[01:40] Chicago Gaming Company, once again, is radio silent.

[01:44] It is crickets.

[01:46] You know, Pulp Fiction is supposed to be on the line this month.

[01:48] Reach out to Chicago Gaming Company.

[01:50] See if they respond to you.

[01:52] Where is Ryan White with any sort of communication?

[01:55] Where is Chicago Gaming Company as an organization on social media reaching out to the thousands

[02:01] of people who ordered these games, giving them an update on when they can expect their games?

[02:06] Once again, Chicago Gaming Company is seemingly operating in the dark.

[02:11] And it is very frustrating for everybody.

[02:13] It's frustrating for me.

[02:14] I have a Pulp Fiction alley on order.

[02:16] When am I getting it?

[02:17] I don't know.

[02:18] Should I be saving money now because I might have to pay for it in a month or two?

[02:22] Or is it going to be six months or eight months?

[02:24] Or a year from now?

[02:25] I am really disappointed in this company.

[02:27] I don't even want to give them much more airtime.

[02:30] They're doing it to us again.

[02:32] They did it with the Cactus Canyon builds.

[02:34] Ryan White and the team over at Chicago Gaming Company, I think Doug is the guy running the show over there.

[02:40] They should be ashamed of themselves.

[02:42] And now it seems to make total sense why Rick over at Planetary has moved his remakes to other places.

[02:48] And that is why I think we're going to see pinball brothers at Chicago Expo make a remake game

[02:53] that would have gone to Chicago Gaming Company.

[02:56] But Chicago Gaming Company needs to wake up.

[02:58] These shenanigans, they become old.

[03:00] They've really taken their customers down a road they don't deserve.

[03:04] And I think they should be ashamed of themselves.

[03:06] It's bad business practice.

[03:08] They're in the service industry.

[03:10] They are making a game to service a community of people.

[03:13] And we are spending a lot of money on their products.

[03:16] The quality is there, but the experience is terrible.

[03:19] And I'm going to say this and they need to learn this lesson.

[03:22] Ryan White and everybody over there.

[03:24] People won't remember what you say.

[03:26] They won't remember what you do, but they will remember how you make them feel.

[03:30] And Chicago Gaming Company has made people feel terrible about ordering games from them over the last few years.

[03:38] Grow up, become more professional and stop this.

[03:41] Stop releasing games, revealing games, taking people's money and then having absolutely zero communication with your customers.

[03:49] As if the internet does not exist.

[03:51] As if Facebook does not exist.

[03:53] As if you can't get in touch with people.

[03:54] There's no excuse for it.

[03:56] All right.

[03:56] All right.

[03:57] Shame on them.

[03:57] All right.

[03:58] Let's talk about Pinball Expo.

[03:59] It is coming up in like two weeks.

[04:02] Now look, I know a lot of people are like,

[04:03] Canada, go to the media mixer.

[04:05] We'll see what happens.

[04:06] We'll see what happens if Canada makes a presence at Chicago Pinball Expo.

[04:10] But you're not going there to see me.

[04:11] You're going there to see the games, right?

[04:13] You're not going there for the personalities.

[04:15] It is going to be another free for all.

[04:18] With all of these pinball companies trying to figure out how to dominate in the month of October.

[04:24] Let's do a roll call of everyone who's trying to win this month.

[04:27] Well, Stern Pinball, they've got two games, both by Brian Eddy.

[04:31] They've got Venom, which is a sales dud.

[04:33] I'm glad to see people unboxing the LEs of Venom.

[04:37] I don't look at that game with any envy.

[04:39] There's nothing about those LEs.

[04:40] They're like, oh man, I wish I got one of these.

[04:43] You are going to be able to get a Venom LE whenever you want

[04:47] for whatever you want almost.

[04:48] I know you're going to be able to get it for like $11,000 in just a month or two.

[04:52] Everybody knows that.

[04:54] And I'm talking new in box for $11,000.

[04:56] And once you unbox this thing, it is just going to sink by 30% instantly.

[05:01] And we haven't seen that in pinball very often, but we saw it a lot over the last year or so.

[05:05] So Venom, if you're a fan, congratulations.

[05:08] I think everyone else has moved on past this game.

[05:11] Then we got Stranger Things Remake or Rerun of Stranger Things,

[05:14] some Quasi-Vault edition of the game.

[05:17] Stern's going to sell a decent amount of those.

[05:19] They've fixed some of the issues with the game.

[05:21] People have let me know that the fixes for this game, you know, the telekinesis lock

[05:26] and you've got like the Demogorgon ramp and all that stuff or the position of the Demogorgon.

[05:30] All that stuff has been fixed already in service bulletins for people.

[05:34] I think they're just making those fixes now at the factory.

[05:37] So it's not a new thing.

[05:39] I think people thinking like, oh my gosh, the old games are going to be worthless.

[05:42] Those people are not going to be accurate.

[05:45] The games are going to play pretty much exactly the same.

[05:48] We're still waiting to see what the new projector is in the game.

[05:51] I'm assuming it's going to be similar.

[05:53] It's not like we're going from like standard definition to 4K with this new projector.

[05:58] I think it's just going to mount differently.

[06:00] And I don't think the experience is going to be radically different.

[06:03] The good news for Stranger Things is if you want it won, you no longer have to pay a crazy price.

[06:08] It has been a lot of fun seeing a lot of people miss the window in which they should have sold their Stranger Things machines.

[06:15] And the reason why I'm making fun of some of these people and I'll tell you why.

[06:18] Because there's a guy that bought a Stranger Things Pro like two weeks ago

[06:22] and he's all bummed out because he spent like 8,900 on a freaking pro

[06:27] which you can now get for like 6,500 bucks.

[06:29] And I was sort of jabbing him a little bit.

[06:31] And the reason why is this is I've been saying this game is going to come back for weeks.

[06:35] Everybody else has been saying it.

[06:37] And why wouldn't you just wait?

[06:39] Everybody was saying this.

[06:40] If you just wait by the end of the year, you are most likely going to see Stranger Things being rerun

[06:46] and fill that empty slot in November that Stern had on the production calendar.

[06:52] And look, anyone who's going to go buy a Stranger Things Pro for like 8,500 bucks or 9,000 dollars.

[06:59] These are people in the community.

[07:01] They're reading Pinside.

[07:03] They're listening to podcasts and they rolled the dice and they lost.

[07:07] And now it's going to be funny seeing all of these people with their used Stranger Things premiums.

[07:13] It's going to be funny to see what they do with the pricing.

[07:15] You know, they're going to have to bring those prices well down.

[07:18] I mean, think about it like this.

[07:19] If you price a Stranger Things premium at $14,000,

[07:24] this week you just lost like $6,000 in value on what you thought you were going to get for your game

[07:30] because a used premium now is basically worth like 8,500, 9,000

[07:35] because you can go get a brand new one for like 9,500.

[07:38] So that's going to be Stern's big play at Expo.

[07:41] They're going to be pushing these two titles.

[07:43] Let's go on to the Mystery Pinball Company.

[07:46] Now look, I'm really happy these guys took my advice.

[07:49] And even though they didn't directly take my advice, I've been saying this all along.

[07:53] If you have a theme that you know is going to be somewhat disruptive,

[07:57] it is smart to let people know what it's going to be before you show up at the show.

[08:02] Before you reveal the game, every single clue about this machine is labyrinth.

[08:07] If it is not going to be labyrinth,

[08:09] then they have taken us all on the most deceptive marketing teaser campaign of all time.

[08:15] And I like what they're doing because basically now when they reveal this game,

[08:19] no one's going to be mad about the fact that it's labyrinth

[08:23] because we already know that people who are mad about this theme.

[08:27] They've now had a few weeks to be angry about the theme.

[08:31] And guess what happens with anger?

[08:33] It starts to dissipate over time unless you're angry at Canadian Pinball podcast

[08:37] because my haters just hold on to their anger forever.

[08:41] As my subscription numbers keep going up and up and up and theirs stay flat.

[08:45] All right.

[08:46] So everyone who's holding on to anger, they've had time to voice it.

[08:49] And so when the game is over,

[08:51] they've had time to voice it.

[08:52] And so when the game finally gets revealed,

[08:55] it's not going to be a mystery what the theme is.

[08:57] The real mystery is this.

[08:59] Who designed it?

[09:00] Who's coding it?

[09:01] What's the artwork like?

[09:03] What are the mechs going to be?

[09:04] What are the shots going to be?

[09:05] I still have a lot of excitement for this game.

[09:08] And I think this is the game with the most curiosity at Pinball Expo.

[09:13] We know they're going to be there.

[09:14] We know they're going to have games new in box.

[09:16] And then the other questions we really want answered,

[09:18] how many can you make a week a month?

[09:21] How much is this game?

[09:23] How many models of this game will there be?

[09:26] You know, this company is run by a lot of smart people.

[09:28] I also heard some crazy rumors.

[09:30] It's going to be John Papadook.

[09:32] I can't imagine in a million years this company would partner up with John Papadook

[09:36] if they wanted to be successful.

[09:38] I don't think J-pop is going to be anywhere near this game.

[09:41] I think you're going to hear David Van Esses name attribute it with this company

[09:46] and with this game.

[09:47] I think you're going to see Fast Pinball, which we know it's Fast Pinball boards.

[09:51] I think we might see a few more people in the mix associated with this company

[09:55] that are familiar names.

[09:57] Now look, this is very interesting.

[09:58] And there's a lot of skepticism around any new to Pinball boutique company.

[10:03] History has shown us that even if you can march in with the game,

[10:07] even if you can have some games made,

[10:10] are you going to be able to absorb a lot of orders?

[10:14] It's one thing to make 10 games and put them in a box.

[10:18] It's another thing to get 500 orders and then communicate to your buyers

[10:22] when they can expect their games and then make those games in a timely fashion.

[10:27] So lots of questions around this company, all of which will be answered at Pinball Expo.

[10:33] And I look forward to seeing their product.

[10:35] I look forward to covering this company.

[10:37] And it is fun to finally have a new Pinball company that is made up of smart men in the industry.

[10:43] So I fully expect big things from this company.

[10:46] The one big thing that I'm still like,

[10:48] Labyrinth really?

[10:50] You know, I'm telling you as a marketer,

[10:52] Labyrinth isn't where I would start with a theme to launch my Pinball company.

[10:57] So we shall see if they can turn my skepticism around.

[11:01] All right.

[11:02] So that's the mystery Pinball company.

[11:03] Now we're hearing from Naps Arcade and from other sources that Jersey Jack Pinball,

[11:09] you know, the company that's released two flops in a row is 10 years into the company's history

[11:15] and is seemingly making the most barren games they've ever made.

[11:19] Jersey Jack Pinball is going to march into Pinball Expo with Elton John.

[11:24] Now look, JJP, this is the crossroads.

[11:26] This is the moment.

[11:27] This is the moment where they either deliver,

[11:29] where Steve Ritchie brings this company back to its house in days of old,

[11:34] loaded games with so much in it that you cannot miss the value from a Jersey Jack machine.

[11:40] We did not see the value in Toy Story.

[11:42] Terrible theme.

[11:44] We did not see the value in the Godfather.

[11:46] Terrible theme for Pinball.

[11:48] Will we see the value in Elton John?

[11:50] And that's the thing.

[11:51] It's like whenever I say Elton John,

[11:53] I just die a little bit inside because this is not the theme people want.

[11:58] And unlike the mystery Pinball company,

[12:00] I am still shocked that Jersey Jack,

[12:03] when we know it's going to be Elton John,

[12:05] I'm still shocked that they are not doing anything to sort of rip the Band-Aid off early

[12:12] and allow us to be angry about the theme because they've started to confirm what the theme is.

[12:19] We knew it was Toy Story.

[12:21] We just didn't know it was Toy Story 4.

[12:23] And look how mad we got.

[12:25] We knew it was the Godfather.

[12:26] And when the Godfather came out,

[12:28] it wasn't like we were angry.

[12:29] We were just like,

[12:30] it is what we thought it was going to be.

[12:32] And most people stayed away from it.

[12:34] And now, will all the rumors about Elton John be correct?

[12:39] Now, I would love it.

[12:40] I mean it.

[12:40] I would love it if I'm so wrong on this.

[12:43] I want to be wrong on this.

[12:45] I don't want it to be Elton John.

[12:48] I know most of you don't want it to be Elton John.

[12:51] Can you imagine if Steve Ritchie rocked in there with freaking The Matrix

[12:55] or rocked in there with Harry Potter?

[12:57] And I think the moment we hear like crocodile rock,

[13:00] I don't know.

[13:01] I just have this weird feeling that the reception to this game is not going to be

[13:07] what they think it is.

[13:08] But it is exciting if the rumor is true that Jersey Jack Pimbal

[13:13] is going to have another game in a single calendar year.

[13:16] Jersey Jack has never done this.

[13:18] They've never revealed and released two games in one year.

[13:23] Two brand new games.

[13:25] It speaks to the failure of Godfather, but it's also somewhat of a light at the end of their tunnel

[13:31] that they're going to be able to release two games in a calendar year.

[13:35] My real worry about Jersey Jack, it's not just the themes they select,

[13:40] but they're another company that never really completes the code.

[13:43] And if they release two games in one year, are we now going to get two in complete games?

[13:49] And are they going to get better at constant code updates?

[13:52] So Jersey Jack wants your money with maybe Elton John.

[13:56] The Pimbal brothers are coming to Chicago Expo.

[13:59] They have already said they're bringing a new game.

[14:01] We know it's going to be a remake of something.

[14:04] It is going to be a Bally Williams title.

[14:07] My guess is still with Dracula.

[14:09] I think it's going to be Dracula, Bally Williams.

[14:12] I think it's going to be Brian Allen on the art package.

[14:15] That is my guess.

[14:17] The other guesses are Twilight Zone and Big Bang Barb.

[14:21] But if Brian Allen is on artwork, I can't see him redoing the art packages on either of those games.

[14:27] But I could see him doing a Dracula new edition with new artwork.

[14:32] And Dracula is a game where if you modernized it a little bit,

[14:36] it still has one of the coolest moments in all of Pimbal

[14:40] when Dracula grabs the ball and the magnets carry it across the play field.

[14:44] So we will see.

[14:45] I'm not sure.

[14:46] I don't have any line of sight into what the theme actually is,

[14:49] but I do know it's a remake and I do know they are in a partnership with Planetary Pimbal.

[14:55] So that's another title showing up to Pimbal Expo.

[14:58] Now, what else is going to happen at Pimbal Expo?

[15:00] We're going to get people like Turner Pimbal.

[15:02] Nobody cares about Turner Pimbal.

[15:04] There might be a home pin, spinal tap.

[15:07] Nobody cares about that.

[15:09] It's still too early for Spooky's next game.

[15:11] So we're not going to see that.

[15:13] Spooky's always in a good position.

[15:14] See what's happening right here.

[15:16] Everybody's battling it out.

[15:18] And they're all going to cancel each other out and Spooky Pimbal doesn't have to worry.

[15:22] They're making money each week, making their Scooby-Doo's,

[15:25] while everybody else shows their hand way too early.

[15:29] And Spooky Pimbal's, once again, they're going to slide right into that window

[15:34] when there's nothing new, nothing's happening.

[15:37] They always find the right timing to announce their games.

[15:40] They get in front of it at the right time and they're going to be successful again because of that.

[15:46] All these other companies, they're doing it wrong.

[15:49] They're always trying to fight the battle around the shows.

[15:53] They're always getting scooped by Stern.

[15:55] And Stern's going to clobber them with manufacturing and efficiencies.

[15:59] And everybody else just has their hands in their pockets.

[16:02] So Spooky Pimbal, nothing really going to happen at Expo.

[16:05] Who else is out there in the Pimbal world?

[16:07] Dutch Pimbal, back to the future.

[16:09] People, are you ready?

[16:10] Did you see the Dutch Pimbal Pizza Party?

[16:13] Canada paid Barry for that entire pizza party.

[16:16] Canada has paid in euros.

[16:18] I was so happy to see everybody eating the pizza.

[16:21] Barry sent me a photo of the entire Dutch Pimbal crew enjoying the pizza party.

[16:28] And I'm just going to say this right now.

[16:29] There's a decent looking crew over there at Dutch Pimbal.

[16:33] You know, we never see photos like this coming from Haggis Pimbal.

[16:36] And Haggis Buddies, you're up!

[16:38] It's time for Damien to go on Facebook Live and walk around Haggis Factory.

[16:43] And the pizza party is yours in Australia.

[16:45] Heck, I should even send some pizza pies over to the media mixer.

[16:49] That's going to be my new thing.

[16:50] The most negative man in Pimbal is making the most positive things happen.

[16:54] So look, Dutch Pimbal back to the future.

[16:56] Everybody is super excited by that rumor.

[16:59] Now look, Barry did not reach out to me and say,

[17:01] Nope, it's not happening.

[17:03] You know, I don't know.

[17:04] He's never going to confirm or deny it.

[17:06] But man, not fully out denying it, leaves the door open.

[17:10] And I think everybody.

[17:12] Everybody feels this way.

[17:13] If Dutch Pimbal can do back to the future and do it justice with Roger Sharp,

[17:19] helping them get the assets, there is no other company I would rather have make this game than Dutch Pimbal.

[17:26] I know some people are like, well, Stern Pimbal should make back to the future.

[17:29] Why?

[17:30] If Stern Pimbal made back to the future, there would be like no mechs in the game.

[17:34] Now look, Stern would do it justice on the code front and they would do it justice on the artwork front.

[17:40] But Stern Pimbal still has not shown me consistently that they will put mechanical engineering magic into these Pimbal machines.

[17:48] Why would you want Stern to make the game?

[17:50] Now look, four years ago, I would have said Jersey Jack Pimbal is the company to make back to the future.

[17:55] And now look at Jersey Jack.

[17:57] Nobody really knows what they're going to get from Jersey Jack.

[17:59] So I'm happy that Dutch Pimbal might have this license.

[18:02] The big issue is this.

[18:04] If Dutch Pimbal is making back to the future, they're going to get 5,000 orders.

[18:07] Like how are they going to make this game if they're only making like 5 to 10 games a week?

[18:12] Like that's not going to work.

[18:14] There's only one way that works.

[18:16] And I've been telling Barry this.

[18:17] What's the one way that if Dutch Pimbal has the back to the future license and they can only make a limited number of games a week and a year?

[18:26] What's the one thing they could do to solve that problem?

[18:30] And it's super simple.

[18:31] Just charge a boatload for the game and say you're only going to make a certain amount.

[18:37] Imagine this.

[18:38] If they said we are only making a thousand back to the future machines, they could charge $30,000 for each one.

[18:47] Let me repeat that 30 grand for each one.

[18:51] If there were only a thousand, that's $30 million.

[18:56] $30 million in revenue.

[18:58] Right.

[18:59] If they said we're only making a thousand, think about it for a minute, people.

[19:04] There's only a thousand pirates of the Caribbean, Jersey Jack games in the world.

[19:08] Only a thousand.

[19:09] The CES sell for like 30K and the LE sell for like $20,000, $4,000.

[19:15] Okay.

[19:15] And that is a theme nobody really wanted.

[19:18] Imagine back to the future with 10 times more demand than pirates of the Caribbean.

[19:23] Imagine back to the future with theme song from the movie with some of the assets from the movie with the most

[19:29] iconic scenes from the 80s.

[19:31] You could almost ask whatever you want because right now in the pinball world, I mean it when I say this,

[19:36] the collectors and the high end collectors and there is a good thousand of them out in the world.

[19:41] It's a global marketplace.

[19:42] These guys are starving for something.

[19:44] Stern has ruined it for a lot of them.

[19:47] What Stern does with its LEs, knowing there's going to be unlimited premiums and pros,

[19:51] it's no longer special.

[19:53] Like none of the Stern LEs do anything for me anymore.

[19:56] I'm waiting for Stern to do another SLE.

[19:58] I think we're going to see it on Jaws.

[20:00] But for right now, like when these Venoms get unveiled or Foo Fighter LEs or James Bond LEs,

[20:05] I mean James Bond LE looks just like James Bond premium.

[20:09] They're just not special anymore.

[20:11] If I were a collector, I wouldn't even be looking at these things.

[20:14] I mean that Godzilla LE does not look that special.

[20:17] The only thing I would be looking at from a collector standpoint is a Ghostbusters LE,

[20:22] a Tron LE, a Batman LE or SLE.

[20:26] Those are the games where there's not that many of them out there.

[20:29] Everything else, they're everywhere and they look exactly like every other game.

[20:33] I mean, look how lazy Stern has got.

[20:35] They don't even change the Translight artwork between the premium and the LE now.

[20:40] That is lazy.

[20:42] All right, so we shall see what happens with Dutch Pinball and Back to the Future.

[20:47] Expo is going to be bonkers.

[20:49] And my advice to each and every one of you stays the same.

[20:53] Just wait and see because no matter what happens at Expo, trust me when I say this,

[20:58] Keith Elwin's Jaws is going to create a seismic shift in Pinball.

[21:03] When that game comes out, so many other games are going to go up for sale.

[21:08] This is the big issue in Pinball.

[21:09] There's too much volume.

[21:11] There's too many new games that need homes.

[21:14] We're not going to see anything from American Pinball at Pinball Expo.

[21:18] Do you actually think American Pinball is going to go to Expo?

[21:20] Which is kind of sad when you think about it because it's David Fix's show.

[21:24] Like this is his show.

[21:26] He's the show organizer.

[21:27] They're going to do everything they can to try to sell more Galactic Tank Forces and it's not going to work.

[21:33] He's bringing the cast members from the game to the show.

[21:37] That's not going to net you many more sales.

[21:39] This game is another sales flop.

[21:41] Where is their follow-up game to Galactic Tank Force?

[21:44] And that's my thing.

[21:45] There's so many companies.

[21:47] There's so many games.

[21:48] And yet, when the dust settles, Stern Pinball is the only company really consistently selling stuff.

[21:54] Everybody else, you know, neither here nor there.

[21:58] And now, whenever a new game comes out, a lot of you out there have to make room for it.

[22:03] You have to free up money.

[22:04] And it's harder and harder and harder to sell a used game now because there's so many new games

[22:10] sitting at distributors and inventory.

[22:12] And there's just so many people out there trying to get rid of so many games

[22:16] because they're all trying to get some money together to buy Jaws, to buy back to the future in a year.

[22:21] You know, to buy these exciting new games that are coming out.

[22:24] I really like this mystery pinball company.

[22:26] I want to go back to them for a second.

[22:27] I really like the fact that we might get a boutique company that can design a game at a higher level than Spooky.

[22:34] I mean it.

[22:35] I really think this company has me excited.

[22:37] I just want somebody new to do something new, but actually bring some good design and engineering into the pinball space.

[22:45] That's Spooky's next job to be done.

[22:47] They got to get better at the design and they got to get better at the mechanical magic.

[22:52] And when I look at this mystery game with two magnets and all of this stuff going on,

[22:57] it's going to be a game that I think is pretty packed.

[22:59] And I only have to wait two weeks for it.

[23:01] You know what else is coming out in like two weeks that has me so excited?

[23:04] Well, maybe it's three weeks.

[23:06] There's going to be a new Guns N' Roses single in the world.

[23:08] It's going to be called The General.

[23:10] And for those of you that follow GNR, The General was a song that everybody was like,

[23:15] oh, it's going to be one of the big guns on Chinese democracy.

[23:18] He's releasing it as a B side track to the single for perhaps.

[23:23] So I'm super excited.

[23:24] New Guns N' Roses song, all of these freaking pinball machines coming out.
