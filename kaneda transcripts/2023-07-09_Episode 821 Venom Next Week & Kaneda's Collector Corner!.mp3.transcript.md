[00:00] Children be in, that's what they say when we're together, and watch how you play.

[00:10] They don't understand and so we're running just as fast as we can.

[00:16] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:20] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian's Fimbaugh Podcast.

[00:23] We're gonna do this show on Sunday, cause I got a crazy week at work.

[00:27] Now look, thinking about next week, I think we're gonna see Stern Pinball tease the next

[00:31] game and I think all of the pinball news and excitement and conversation is gonna shift

[00:37] to the new Stern game, cause if you think about it, Comic Con is July 20th.

[00:42] That's not this Thursday, it's next Thursday or the following Thursday.

[00:46] I don't think Stern is going to unveil the game at the show.

[00:50] The reason why I'm thinking this is they never do that.

[00:53] So I think what they're gonna do is this.

[00:55] I think they're gonna give us a Venom teaser on Friday the 14th and then I think they're

[01:00] gonna have like the dealer call on the 17th or 18th and then I think they're gonna have

[01:05] like everything happen at Comic Con that's gonna happen at Comic Con.

[01:09] So that means we might just be like five days away from seeing a teaser of the next Stern

[01:16] machine and so I don't know about you, but I am very excited to move on from Haggis Pinball

[01:22] and all of that.

[01:23] I'm very excited to talk about what's gonna happen in the pinball world, especially with

[01:28] this new game from Stern.

[01:30] Now I put up a poll about Venom and most of you out there are not super excited about

[01:35] Venom.

[01:36] I just got back from the movie theater today and I saw the new Spider-Verse film.

[01:41] It was incredible and I think almost everybody out there would rather have the Spider-Verse

[01:49] put into pinball format than Venom, but you know we've been hearing about Venom now for

[01:55] almost two and a half years.

[01:57] It's gonna be Venom, it's gonna be Brian Eddy, it's gonna be back to back games from

[02:02] Zombie Eddy.

[02:03] My gosh, does Zombie Eddy just never stop working over at Stern Pinball?

[02:08] I think this is our package is gonna blow people away.

[02:11] His style is perfect for this kind of artwork and so then it begs the question like let's

[02:16] just hypothetically say it's gonna be Venom.

[02:19] We know who the designer is.

[02:20] I think it's gonna be a Dwight Sullivan game.

[02:23] Some people like Dwight, some people don't.

[02:26] He's probably the most polarizing coder over at Stern Pinball.

[02:30] Some people just won't buy the game if Dwight's coding it.

[02:34] He's got some people that just stay away from his stuff.

[02:37] So there's that.

[02:38] I know a lot of people are wondering is Venom a theme that men 40 to 60 years old want in

[02:44] the pinball world?

[02:46] Look, it comes from the Marvel Spider-Man universe.

[02:49] I don't think this game is gonna be overlooked as much as people are saying it's going to

[02:53] be overlooked.

[02:54] Remember, we all thought Foo Fighters was gonna come and go and nobody was gonna care

[02:58] and look what happened with Foo Fighters.

[03:00] I think it's now like in the top five games of all time you guys have rated Foo Fighters.

[03:05] So when it comes to Brian Eddy, I think people have been waiting for Brian Eddy to really

[03:10] knock it out of the park over at Stern Pinball.

[03:13] I think the jury is still out on Stranger Things.

[03:16] Some people love it, some people don't.

[03:18] I think in the end Stranger Things turned out to be a much better game than people

[03:22] realized but also the people who wrote Stranger Things off the first year the game was out,

[03:29] it wasn't their fault.

[03:30] The game wasn't very good the first year it was out.

[03:33] Remember like the UV kids took like six or eight months to come out and then they didn't

[03:37] really polish the code on Stranger Things.

[03:40] I love sometimes that people have like revisionist history like, Canada was wrong on Stranger

[03:44] Things.

[03:45] It's like, no, nobody was wrong on Stranger Things in year one.

[03:49] And this is the thing about Stern Pinball is they usually eventually get it done and

[03:54] that's what James Bond owners are hoping for with this current James Bond game as every

[03:59] code update drops.

[04:00] The game is getting better and better and better.

[04:02] I still think James Bond suffers from a design layout which no code can change.

[04:08] So Brian Eddy though, Venom, what's going to be the major mech in the game?

[04:13] I mean it has to be the Venom head right with the long tongue.

[04:17] Now people have said Todd McFarland doesn't like the big tongue on Venom and also Todd

[04:23] McFarland is supposedly attached to this project.

[04:27] Now how will he play a role in this project?

[04:30] Will he do something with the artwork with Zambietti?

[04:33] Will there be McFarland toys in the games?

[04:36] I really hope there are toys in the game and not like exclusive McFarland scopes.

[04:42] I'm just tired of toys not being toys in Pinball.

[04:46] I want something that interacts with the ball.

[04:49] So are we going to see like a Gene Simmons Venom head where the tongue comes out and

[04:53] you shoot the ball into Venom's mouth?

[04:55] Are we going to see something else?

[04:58] What will the toys be in this game?

[05:00] Brian Eddy still has one of the greatest toys ever in Pinball history with the castle

[05:05] in medieval madness.

[05:07] But he didn't really put anything special into his last effort.

[05:10] I think Mandalorian is a game.

[05:12] When you think about the Mandalorian show it just begs for amazing toys and I still

[05:18] can't believe that he designed a Mandalorian game.

[05:21] When you have Grogu and Force Powers and did not find an interesting way to use magnets

[05:27] to control the force in the game.

[05:30] I mean it was just like begging for those kinds of toys.

[05:33] I think the upper play field in Mandalorian was underwhelming.

[05:36] I think the game overall is somewhat underwhelming and that's why we're not seeing Mandalorian

[05:41] sort of sell for more than it came out for and we're not seeing a lot of hype around

[05:45] the game.

[05:46] I think distros are probably sitting on Mandalorian premiums at $10,000.

[05:51] So this is Brian Eddy's third attempt over at Stern Pinball.

[05:56] What will he do?

[05:57] Is he a Venom fanatic?

[05:59] Is this a dream theme for Brian Eddy?

[06:02] We're going to see real soon in less than two weeks.

[06:04] My prediction is this.

[06:05] I think this game is going to come out and I think people are going to be blown away

[06:09] by it visually.

[06:10] I think there is going to be a major mech in the game that excites people and I think

[06:16] it's going to be comic book style Venom.

[06:18] I think the animations are going to be great and I think Stern is going to have a sleeper

[06:23] hit on their hands with this game.

[06:26] That's my prediction.

[06:27] I think they're going to sell out of the L.E.'s.

[06:29] If you look at the pinball marketplace now, there's so many people in this hobby and the

[06:33] other reason why Stern is going to crush it with this game is everybody else doesn't

[06:38] have anything enticing that they're putting into boxes right now.

[06:42] I mean Stern has almost no competition.

[06:46] Nobody wants Godfather L.E.

[06:47] They've already sold their C.E. allotments for Godfather.

[06:51] Even though Haggis just revealed Centaur, that's not going to ship until maybe 2024.

[06:56] We're not going to see Pulp Fiction until the end of the year.

[06:59] Scooby-Doo orders are trickling out.

[07:01] Spooky Pinball is somewhere around 600 of them or 700 of them.

[07:05] They've still got a lot more Scooby-Doo's to make.

[07:08] But if you want a Scooby-Doo, you can go get one pretty easily.

[07:12] A lot of Scooby-Doo's were ordered with the Butter Cabinet and I think we're going to

[07:16] see a lot of those Butter Cabinet Scooby-Doo's come up on the marketplace.

[07:20] And who else, right?

[07:21] Galactic Tank Force at American Pinball.

[07:23] I mean are people really ordering that game?

[07:26] We still see L.E.'s available for sale.

[07:28] We're going to start making that $17,500 signature edition of the game.

[07:34] But right now in the Pinball marketplace, there really isn't a ton of like new and box

[07:40] stuff that's come out since that March Madness Blitz that people really want.

[07:47] And dare I say, not that Stern was vulnerable because I don't think anyone expected Foo

[07:51] Fighters to become the runaway hit that it did.

[07:54] But Stern definitely was vulnerable and nobody showed up with anything that was really that

[08:01] impressive other than Pulp Fiction.

[08:04] And I think Pulp Fiction was the other surprise hit that came out of March Madness because

[08:09] everybody thought a single level Pulp Fiction with no screen, there's no way people are

[08:14] going to want that game.

[08:15] And look at what happened with Pulp Fiction.

[08:17] So I wouldn't write off Venom.

[08:19] We're going to get to see it in a couple weeks and I think Stern knows what they're doing.

[08:22] I think they execute better than everybody else in Pinball.

[08:26] But I will say at these prices, I am looking for more and more from this team over at Stern.

[08:33] I'm especially looking for more in the Mechanical Engineering Department.

[08:37] We know they have great art, they have great coders, they have great animators.

[08:42] I haven't been blown away consistently by the mechanical engineering and creativity

[08:48] on a mechanical level that is going into these Stern games.

[08:53] Foo Fighters shoots amazingly well.

[08:55] Everything that's in the game works very well for the game itself.

[08:58] Mechanically though, I wouldn't say there's anything groundbreaking in Foo Fighters.

[09:03] I think we're all looking for more stuff like Godzilla.

[09:07] Now here's an interesting thing.

[09:09] If Godzilla had all of that stuff in the game and they sold Godzilla for profit for $10,500,

[09:17] now these games are $2,500 more a pop for the LEs.

[09:23] You're telling me that we shouldn't see at least $500 more in material value, in engineering

[09:31] and creativity in these games moving forward.

[09:34] Unfortunately Stern has learned because we showed them they don't have to put more into

[09:40] the games and they can charge 30% more.

[09:43] I think Foo Fighters was one of their fastest selling games ever.

[09:47] Ever.

[09:48] I think they sold out of Foo Fighters LE in almost record time.

[09:53] This is happening with a title like Foo Fighters that's not packed with stuff.

[09:58] Can you imagine what's going to happen if they have Back to the Future or Jaws comes

[10:03] out?

[10:04] Here's a rumor I heard about Jaws.

[10:06] I heard that with Jaws we are going to see the return of a Stern Super Limited Edition

[10:13] game, an SLE game.

[10:16] Is Joe Kamnikow associated with Jaws?

[10:19] Maybe it's a Kapow title.

[10:20] You might hear Killian crying in the background.

[10:23] This is what happens when Kaneda does his podcast on a Sunday and the little monsters

[10:27] next door.

[10:28] But I heard they're going to have an SLE of Jaws.

[10:31] Oh my gosh, had to take a little break there.

[10:34] Killian and Brenda are in the kitchen cooking and he's screaming because she took away his

[10:38] utensils.

[10:39] Okay, so we were talking about Jaws Super Limited Edition.

[10:43] How much do we think Stern would charge for this game and how many would they make?

[10:48] I think it's something like the 40th anniversary of Jaws or 45th anniversary of Jaws.

[10:54] I think Jaws came out in like 1977, some year like that.

[10:58] So how many would they make and then how much would they charge?

[11:02] Now let's look at it right now where we're at.

[11:03] Isn't it crazy that Stern's SLE of Batman was $15,000 and we screamed and cried about

[11:11] that like six years ago?

[11:14] Now every single Stern LE is $13,000.

[11:17] If you put a topper on top of it, it's going to be $14,000 or $15,000.

[11:21] You see what they did to us?

[11:23] They went from making a Super Limited Batman where there were only 80 of them and head

[11:29] to toe they made that game beautiful.

[11:31] And now they're making a thousand of basically the same price game and they're not putting

[11:36] a lot more in these new games people.

[11:38] You don't even get a topper for $13,000.

[11:41] But I think Jaws Super Limited Edition, here's what I think Stern will do.

[11:46] I think they're once again going to wimp out and not really price it.

[11:51] But if they sell any directly, they're going to have to put a price on it.

[11:55] Like someone needs to tell Stern Pinball they can't keep selling these games directly

[11:59] and then trying to hide behind their distributors with the call for price BS.

[12:03] But I think if it's a Jaws Super Limited Edition and they maybe only make like 50 of them,

[12:09] right, Elvira style or $199,000, I think you're going to see Stern price these games even

[12:15] higher than $19,995.

[12:19] I could see something like $22,000 or $25,000 for a Jaws Super Limited Edition game.

[12:28] Do we want this stuff at Pinball is the real question.

[12:32] Does this make anybody feel good?

[12:35] I know that a lot of you have a lot of money, but does anyone really want to spend $20,000

[12:42] plus on a single Pinball experience?

[12:46] When I went to Jack Bar yesterday, that was the one thing.

[12:48] I played Pinball for like two hours and I walked out of there and I said, you know what?

[12:53] I love Pinball a lot.

[12:55] But Pinball is just not a $20,000 experience.

[13:00] It's not even a $10,000 experience.

[13:04] We have now turned these things into baseball cards and that's why the people running Stern

[13:09] Pinball come from the baseball card industry.

[13:12] They come from Disney.

[13:14] They're going to keep milking us for as much as they can.

[13:18] And trust me, I don't think they're going to put a lot more into these games as the prices

[13:23] go up and up and up.

[13:26] But Jaws has everybody excited.

[13:28] I think people think Beetlejuice is around the corner.

[13:31] I think people think Top Gun and Matrix and all these exciting things are around the corner.

[13:37] And this is the thing about Pinball right now.

[13:40] Look at where the prices have gone on themes that aren't even triple A themes.

[13:46] And then it starts to get really scary what will happen when an actual triple A theme

[13:52] comes out that checks all of the boxes.

[13:56] That's why everyone's looking at what's next from Jersey Jack, if it's Elton John.

[14:00] That's not really...

[14:02] It's hard to argue what makes a triple A theme in Pinball.

[14:06] I'm going to do a separate podcast about that.

[14:09] There's a lot of criteria that I think you have to put on the table when you say what's

[14:13] a triple A theme for Pinball.

[14:16] It's not just a triple A theme in general.

[14:19] It needs to cross over and make sense for Pinball.

[14:23] Also appeal to the demographic that buys Pinball machines.

[14:26] And I think Elton John for a lot of people is a miss.

[14:29] I think a lot of people would rather have Beastie Boys or Red Hot Chili Peppers.

[14:34] There's a lot of other musical acts like Nirvana.

[14:37] I think there's other stuff we'd rather have than Elton John.

[14:40] If you were to go into the Pinball buying communities Spotify playlist, how many of us

[14:46] have Elton John on repeat?

[14:50] Probably not too many.

[14:51] Alright, so what else is going on in Pinball?

[14:53] Nothing really new over at American Pinball.

[14:56] Nothing really new from Dutch Pinball.

[14:58] Nothing really new from the Pinball Brothers.

[15:00] I'm seeing more of these Queen Pinball machines being unboxed and played.

[15:06] You know, look Queen, it's one of those games where it's not really setting the Pinball

[15:10] world on fire.

[15:11] I think owners are enjoying the game.

[15:14] I just don't see anything in it that's that impressive.

[15:17] I think following Guns N' Roses and the spectacle in that game, I think Queen still looks a

[15:23] little bit dated and looks a little bit old.

[15:27] And it's going to be one of these games and you know this, if you want a Queen Pinball

[15:30] machine and you simply wait a few months or a year, you're going to be able to pick

[15:35] one up easily for a lot less money than they are new.

[15:40] It's going to be interesting to see what happens with Padready Gaming and the people who are

[15:43] making those machines because they know how to manufacture the games and they're doing

[15:47] a good job with the manufacturing.

[15:49] And I think we're going to see some of these remakes like Big Bang Bar and Twilight Zone.

[15:54] I think we're going to see that come from Padready Gaming.

[15:57] And that's crazy too, right?

[15:58] Like who's this mystery pinball company that keeps leaving business cards all over these

[16:03] pinball shows?

[16:04] They've got something coming out as well.

[16:07] It's kind of funny, right?

[16:08] We speculate about all these companies and what's around the corner and the only company

[16:13] that really executes well is Stern Pinball.

[16:17] I would say Spooky Pinball knows how to execute very well for where they are in the pinball

[16:21] marketplace.

[16:23] I think Jersey Jack Pinball has whiffed two times in a row.

[16:26] I think American Pinball has whiffed with Galactic Tank Force.

[16:30] I think Haggis Pinball, you know my thoughts on Haggis Pinball.

[16:33] I don't even want to talk about them anymore.

[16:35] If you ordered one, I hope you get your game when they said they're going to start making

[16:38] the games.

[16:39] Damian said they're on track to ship Centaurs in January.

[16:43] We all know that's not happening.

[16:46] Who else is out there?

[16:47] Like the promise of all of these companies.

[16:50] I was talking to someone who knows Dutch Pinball's next game and they said it is going to be

[16:56] wow and it's really going to impress a lot of people and people are going to want it.

[17:00] When we think about when is Dutch Pinball going to get to that next title?

[17:04] Everybody said they might be done with the big Lebowski sometime in September of 2024.

[17:11] So that's a long time away.

[17:14] I mean there's a lot that's going to happen between now and Q4 of 2024.

[17:19] I hope for all of these companies' sakes and I hope for the distributors and I hope for

[17:22] all of you who are buying in at these high prices.

[17:26] I really hope the economy stays strong because I just think people are going to wake up a

[17:31] little bit from this hangover.

[17:33] I do.

[17:34] I think people are going to realize holy cow I spent $45,000 on three stern elites after

[17:40] accessorizing them and that's a lot of money.

[17:43] And there's a lot of games for trade right now on the used market.

[17:47] Speaking of let's do Canada's Collector's Corner.

[17:50] We haven't done this in a while.

[17:51] So I'm going to put in games that cost $14,000 or more and we're going to ask ourselves whether

[17:58] or not we think this is a good price and if this is a game that is a collectible.

[18:02] Alright number one James Bond 60th.

[18:05] Number 60.

[18:06] Wow 60th of 60.

[18:08] $15,300.

[18:11] Now look I still think if you wait on this game it's going to go down even more.

[18:16] I don't think $15,000 is the bottom at all for James Bond 60th and I think when Jaws

[18:22] comes out this game is going to go down even further.

[18:25] There's a Godfather CE the Unobtainium game.

[18:28] 45 hours ago someone is listing it for $15,500.

[18:33] I am selling my Godfather CE that is on order directly from Jersey Jack.

[18:38] I am being told should be ready to ship within the next 30 days.

[18:41] Alright see I think we're going to see a lot of this people.

[18:44] I would not go anywhere near a Godfather CE for $15,000 trust me.

[18:51] In six months the market is going to be flooded with these games.

[18:55] People bought this game without playing it.

[18:57] It's not a bad game.

[18:59] It's just a bad game at $15,000.

[19:02] You're going to be able to get a Godfather CE for around $13,000 or $12,500 in just a

[19:08] few months.

[19:09] Trust me on this.

[19:10] I am so certain that Godfather is going to head south.

[19:14] Don't go anywhere near this and do me a favor don't bail out these guys that went in on

[19:19] Godfather CE and now they realize there's not a lot of excitement for the game.

[19:25] They're watching what's happening with the LE prices and they realize it's another pinball

[19:29] theme that nobody really wants and they're going to try to get out immediately on their

[19:34] game.

[19:35] Just don't bail them out.

[19:36] Just wait on the sidelines.

[19:38] Don't be like my friend Derek and lose like $2,000 because you didn't wait and listen

[19:42] to Canada.

[19:43] In Attack from Mars Remake LE for $14,500 wasn't this game like $8,500?

[19:50] I would not spend that much money on an Attack from Mars LE.

[19:55] There's a lot of them out there.

[19:56] You don't see them come up for sale very often.

[19:59] It is an amazing game.

[20:00] It's an amazing package from CGC.

[20:03] I just think $14,500 is way too much money.

[20:05] There's a medieval madness sale pending for $21,000.

[20:10] Wow.

[20:11] I had one and I let it go.

[20:13] I bought one for $10,000.

[20:16] This game has doubled in price.

[20:19] I still fully expect CGC to rerun another edition of medieval madness.

[20:24] But hey, if you've got the money, $21,000 for medieval madness.

[20:29] That is insanity.

[20:30] James Bond 60th one for $17,500.

[20:33] Who's going to buy that?

[20:34] I know it's new in box, but you can get it for much less money.

[20:37] A Munster's LE with a topper new in box for $17,500.

[20:44] That is a crack pipe price.

[20:47] I don't go anywhere near a Munster's LE.

[20:49] I get it's new in box, but again, once you unbox it, you're going to lose $4,000.

[20:55] Ghostbusters LE for $16,000.

[20:58] You got to love Ghostbusters.

[20:59] You got to love the gameplay of Ghostbusters.

[21:02] I'm not a fan of the gameplay.

[21:03] It's a beautiful art package.

[21:05] Do I think Ghostbusters is worth $16,000?

[21:08] That's not an unfair asking price.

[21:10] Again, remember, there's only 500 of them and there's a thousand Foo Fighters that are

[21:16] basically $13,000.

[21:18] When you start to look at these older LE's, I get Ghostbusters is a DMD, but there's not

[21:23] many of them.

[21:25] If I were a collector, I would want to collect the stuff that are truly rare.

[21:30] Now look, there are rumors they might be vaulting Ghostbusters and I think that has some of

[21:35] these LE owners scared.

[21:37] Okay, here's a crazy game.

[21:39] A Batman 66 with the original LE topper.

[21:43] There's only one problem.

[21:44] It's not an original Batman LE.

[21:47] It's a premium with the topper put on top of it for $17,000.

[21:54] Another crack pipe price because you have to remember, a Batman 66 premium is probably

[22:01] worth around $8,000 or $9,000.

[22:03] So that means the topper is worth $7,000 or more.

[22:08] That is ludicrous.

[22:09] It is insane.

[22:10] It's also lame.

[22:11] I'm just going to say this, people.

[22:13] It is really lame to put an LE topper on a game that's not an LE.

[22:17] It's like putting, I'll use a cargument.

[22:19] It's like putting AMG badge on the back of your Mercedes when it's not an AMG.

[22:25] I don't know why people do this.

[22:26] No matter what you do to a premium, it's always going to be a premium.

[22:31] All right, here's a Godzilla LE for $15,800.

[22:34] Do I think that's a good buy?

[22:36] No, I think Godzilla's are going to keep going down.

[22:38] I would just wait.

[22:39] There's so many Godzilla LEs out there.

[22:42] And when Jaws hits, trust me, people, people are going to want to move from Godzilla to

[22:47] Jaws because Godzilla wasn't really a theme that everybody loved, loved.

[22:52] And I think people are going to warm up more to Jaws than Godzilla.

[22:55] Oh, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory CE for $14,500.

[22:59] Is that a good buy?

[23:00] Well, I'd rather buy that than Godfather for $15,000.

[23:04] So there's that.

[23:05] You know, it's not an unfair price.

[23:07] But remember, Willy Wonka's CEs were originally $12,500.

[23:10] This person wants to make a profit.

[23:12] You know, not a terrible price for that game.

[23:15] Let's see what else we got here.

[23:16] Pirates LE for $22,300.

[23:19] Minimal Madness Royal for $23,000.

[23:21] Look, Pirates of the Caribbean, I don't think they're ever going to make it again.

[23:26] And I think they should just come out and say it is $22,000, a crazy price for the LE.

[23:31] It's not.

[23:32] I mean, they've been going for around this price.

[23:34] You tend to see LEs being sold for the low 20s and then the CE guys want like low 30s

[23:40] for their games.

[23:41] Like, I always want to like pirates more than I do.

[23:44] I've played the game a lot.

[23:46] I don't think it's one of these games that checks all the boxes.

[23:49] It's just expensive because it's rare.

[23:52] You know, for those new to the hobby, when this game was available, nobody really wanted

[23:56] it.

[23:57] This one's my favorite.

[23:58] Foo Fighters LE for $21,000 firm.

[24:00] I mean, what?

[24:01] Oh, wait, it's Canada.

[24:02] All right.

[24:03] That makes more sense.

[24:04] Foo Fighters are going to be able to get for lower than 13 coming up real soon.

[24:08] I'm seeing a lot of Godzilla's around 15, 15, 5.

[24:13] I wouldn't go in on one again.

[24:14] I think they're going to go down more.

[24:16] And look, the Kill Bill.

[24:17] The Kill Bill, the Kill Bill game that was made by our friends over in the Netherlands.

[24:22] It's reduced its price.

[24:24] And now it's at $78,000 for Kill Bill.

[24:28] Absolutely not.

[24:30] You have to be absolutely out of your mind to buy a homebrew game for $78,000.

[24:38] You're telling me if you go to the dudes in the Netherlands who made this and say, hey,

[24:42] guys, I'll give you 50 grand if you make me one.

[24:45] I bet they would do it.

[24:47] Another Godfather CE people.

[24:48] I'm telling you they're going to start popping up for 16.

[24:52] Another Pirates for $21,500.

[24:54] This is crazy.

[24:55] Stranger Things Premium people.

[24:56] They are going to remake this game.

[24:58] A Stranger Things Premium for $17,500.

[25:03] If you buy a premium for $17,500, you have something seriously wrong with you.

[25:11] They can remake that game anytime they want.

[25:14] All right.

[25:15] And then there's a bunch of Toy Story CE's that are on the market that are not going

[25:18] to move.

[25:19] I don't even know what you sell a Toy Story for.

[25:22] I think it's a great $8,000 game or $7,500 game.

[25:26] Anything more, I'm not moving on it.

[25:28] And I don't think the CE is that much nicer than the Ellie.

[25:32] Such a shame.

[25:33] I just watched Toy Story the other day with Killian.

[25:36] He loves it so much.

[25:37] And Brandon and I were watching the movie and we were like, how the heck did Jersey Jack

[25:41] not make this movie into the game?

[25:43] It's one of the greatest movies of all time.

[25:46] It has so many great one-liners that we still remember.

[25:49] I don't think that man's ever been to medical school.

[25:52] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[25:54] A lot of exciting stuff coming in Pinball.

[25:56] And Canada's Pinball Podcast is going to be here covering all of it with the most objective

[26:02] and honest takes on this hobby.

[26:05] Where are my content creators with everything that went on this week?

[26:08] Wasn't it funny how nobody else said anything?

[26:12] This is why Canada's Pinball Podcast is here, but I want to be more positive.

[26:16] I don't want to get too negative on a company.

[26:18] Nobody really cares about that much.

[26:20] I want to focus on the big companies and what they're doing and what the vibe is in the

[26:25] Pinball community later.
