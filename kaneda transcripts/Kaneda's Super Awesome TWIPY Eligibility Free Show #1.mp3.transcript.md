[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast, I am back from Las Vegas, I had the most

[00:23] amazing time of my life.

[00:25] My wife Brenda is the greatest woman on the planet.

[00:28] I needed this more than anything, I needed time off, I needed some days away, I needed

[00:34] a day by the pool, I needed three or four days of no pinball, no pin sight and in those

[00:39] three to four days I want to say I reflected a lot on this hobby.

[00:43] And I do encourage every one of you to travel as much as you can, to really fill your life

[00:49] with experiences and not just toys and not just possessions.

[00:54] It is such an old cliche but it is so true.

[00:57] We really want to look back on life and remember things we did with people we loved.

[01:02] We're not going to look back on life and feel we were more fulfilled because we bought

[01:06] a $25,000 single level James Bond game that you don't even need, you know you don't need

[01:12] it people.

[01:13] But here's what I was reflecting on because I was thinking a lot about pinball over the

[01:17] last few months and I've been thinking about the vibe of 2022 and I was trying to just

[01:22] put my finger on what has been the vibe of pinball over the last year and I will say

[01:27] it's been a bit of an underwhelming year and I think the overall consensus and the thing

[01:32] I've been feeling more and more lately and I haven't really figured out a way to articulate

[01:36] it, I haven't really figured out a way to define it but I'm going to do it on this episode.

[01:40] And I'm going to do something that I don't normally do instead of just giving you like

[01:43] my opinion.

[01:44] I actually did some research and I started to gather some numbers to sort of support

[01:50] how I've been feeling about pinball lately.

[01:52] The overall consensus I'm coming to is this, I just think these games are getting too

[01:56] expensive and I think when you look at the numbers and you look at the data and you look

[02:00] at what these games used to cost and you look at what they cost now, is there a gap?

[02:06] And we know that pinball used to be much cheaper but it's not just about what a game cost

[02:10] today, it's not about what a game cost 10 years ago.

[02:14] I wanted to just look at the numbers historically and say how is this hobby changed for many of

[02:18] us because if you look at it and you've been following this hobby, some of you have been

[02:22] following for just a few years, some of you might have been in pinball for 10 years, 20

[02:26] years and if you really look at the numbers, the numbers don't lie.

[02:30] And so what I want to do on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast, I sort of want

[02:33] to analyze the numbers in pinball and what we're all feeling right now because my feeling

[02:39] is this, I think these games are overpriced and I really have a hard time waking up and

[02:44] getting excited about a $13,000 stern elite.

[02:48] It's impossible for me to get excited about Toy Story Collector's Edition at $15,000

[02:53] and even the early version of the game at $12,000 and it's not just about what's in these

[02:58] games.

[02:59] It's not just about the gameplay experience, it is 100%, what is deflating me is the price

[03:06] of these machines now.

[03:08] It makes it really hard to justify buying them.

[03:12] It makes it really hard to chase every new inbox game now because I just don't think pinball

[03:17] machines and to get the nicest version of a pinball machine should be such inexpensive

[03:22] endeavor.

[03:23] But what I don't want is this just to be a show about my opinions on it because there

[03:28] are hard facts that we're going to go into.

[03:30] And I think some of this stuff is going to be surprising.

[03:33] Some of it might not be surprising because years go by pretty quickly in this hobby.

[03:37] I've been doing a pinball podcast now for almost seven years, okay?

[03:41] That was probably not the best use of time over the last seven years, but it is fun doing

[03:46] this show and I'm going to keep doing it.

[03:48] And for you new club members, welcome to the Canadian club.

[03:50] What took you so long?

[03:52] We've survived another attempt to get people to leave the Canadian club, but we're holding

[03:56] strong and the numbers look good, but that's not the numbers I want to talk about.

[03:59] Okay, here's how I'm going to do this.

[04:01] And this is going to be really interesting.

[04:02] I think this is going to be one of the best segments I've ever done on this show because

[04:06] I think the numbers are not going to lie.

[04:08] What I'm going to do is I'm going to bring up some of Stern's best titles.

[04:12] All right?

[04:13] Some of their best titles, what year they came out, how much they cost brand new.

[04:18] Then I'm going to compare that to James Bond, Ellie and talk about the percentage increase

[04:23] that James Bond is.

[04:25] But to also make it fair, I am going to adjust what that Stern machine would cost today

[04:32] if we factored in inflation and then see how much more James Bond would cost based on

[04:38] that.

[04:39] So we're going to compare it to the other game that came out this year, Toy Story 4,

[04:43] Collector's Edition.

[04:44] And I think this is going to be one of the most eye-opening moments in the history of

[04:49] Gnados' pinball podcast.

[04:50] And what I love about it, it's not about my emotions.

[04:53] This is just the data.

[04:55] Are you ready for it?

[04:56] All right.

[04:57] So here we go.

[04:58] Back in 2012, Stern pinball launched one of its most fully featured packed games of all

[05:02] time.

[05:03] And the story behind this game is that Mr. Gary Stern, he saw with Jack Winari was doing

[05:08] with Wizard of Oz and he turned to Steve Richie and he said, put everything and the

[05:13] kitchen sink into this game.

[05:15] And that game was ACDC.

[05:17] And ACDC Ellie in 2012 cost $8,499.

[05:23] Now, that means James Bond, Ellie at $13,000, is a 53% increase in price over that ACDC.

[05:31] Now, if we adjust ACDC for inflation, ACDC should cost today $10,963 for the Ellie.

[05:42] And that is with a 29% inflation.

[05:44] Now, what does that mean for James Bond and for Toy Story?

[05:47] Well, James Bond, Ellie is still 18.6% more money than ACDC would have cost if it came

[05:54] out today.

[05:55] Toy Story Collector's Edition is a whopping 36.8% more money today than ACDC would have

[06:03] cost.

[06:04] Let's look at Metallica Ellie in 2013, one of the greatest Stern machines of all time.

[06:09] This game came out for $7,595.

[06:14] That means James Bond, Ellie is a 71% increase over the price of that game.

[06:19] That's adjusted for inflation.

[06:21] Metallica Ellie today would cost $9,655.

[06:27] That means James Bond, Ellie is 34.6% more money than Metallica Ellie would be.

[06:34] And Toy Story Collector's Edition is 55.4% more than Metallica would be.

[06:42] And look how much more is in Metallica than Toy Story.

[06:46] You see what I'm getting at people?

[06:48] 55% more for a game that has less in it.

[06:53] And that's with inflation.

[06:54] Let's look at Ghostbusters Ellie.

[06:56] In 2016, Ghostbusters Ellie was $8,795.

[07:02] That means James Bond, Ellie is a 48% increase in price over that.

[07:07] If we adjust Ghostbusters for inflation, it would be $10,853 today.

[07:14] This Bond, Ellie is now 19.8% more than Ghostbusters Ellie would cost.

[07:20] Toy Story Collector's Edition is 38.2% more money than Ghostbusters Ellie.

[07:27] Let's take another game, a recent game from Stern Pimble, Iron Maiden, Ellie.

[07:31] I think this was voted like the best Stern Pimble machine of all time when they went head

[07:34] to head.

[07:35] $8,999 for an Iron Maiden, Ellie.

[07:40] I believe it was 2018.

[07:42] James Bond, Ellie, is 44.5% increase in price over Iron Maiden.

[07:48] And look, that was 2018.

[07:51] So four years later, a Stern Ellie is 44.5% more money.

[07:56] Think about that for a minute.

[07:58] 44.5% more in four years.

[08:02] Are you making 44.5% more money?

[08:05] Let's adjust it for inflation because inflation happens.

[08:08] Iron Maiden would be today $10,613.

[08:10] James Bond, Ellie, is 22.5% more than that.

[08:17] And Toy Story Collector's Edition is a whopping 41.3% more money than an Iron Maiden cost.

[08:26] And this is the problem.

[08:27] This is what I'm feeling.

[08:28] And I know all of you are feeling this.

[08:30] How many of you out there are making 41.3% more money today than you did just four years

[08:36] ago, or even 22.5% more money?

[08:39] This next one is the one that just blows me away because this next one to me is the

[08:44] real painful one.

[08:45] Because I still don't think they're putting so much more into these modern games than

[08:50] they did into this game.

[08:52] And this game is no other than I still think Stern's greatest pinball machine of all time.

[08:57] Lord of the Rings, Ellie.

[08:59] Now Lord of the Rings originally came out, I believe in 2003, and then the Ellie came

[09:04] out in 2009 and they only made 500 of them.

[09:07] And that game has so much in it from a Toy standpoint.

[09:10] And back in 2009, Lord of the Rings, Ellie was $5,800.

[09:16] That means James Bond, Ellie, price to price is a hundred and twenty four percent increase

[09:22] in price.

[09:23] Now let's do the inflation.

[09:25] If Lord of the Rings, Ellie came out today, it would be $7,978.

[09:32] And that's at a 37.6% inflation.

[09:35] Are you sitting down right now?

[09:37] You know how much more James Bond, Ellie is than Lord of the Rings if it came out today?

[09:42] 63% more for James Bond, Ellie.

[09:46] Are you sitting down if you're a J.J.P fan?

[09:49] Toy Story Collector's Edition.

[09:50] A game that has barely any toys in it is 88% more money than Lord of the Rings, Ellie

[09:57] would have been if it came out today.

[10:00] Do you see what I'm talking about people?

[10:02] What has happened?

[10:04] These aren't gradual price increases.

[10:07] The prices we are getting today are not aligned with what they used to be.

[10:11] They are significantly more money.

[10:14] Twenty to fifty to eighty percent more money when we look at what these games used to cost.

[10:20] It's not just Canada going crazy.

[10:22] And we're not even seeing slight increases in price.

[10:25] Look at Stern Pimble.

[10:26] Avengers and Mandalorian Ellie's were $9,200.

[10:30] Then Godzilla came out, Ellie, and it was $10,5.

[10:33] Then Rush was $11,1.

[10:36] And then James Bond is 13.

[10:38] Like you just legit, you jumped in just two years.

[10:41] These prices have skyrocketed.

[10:43] And it's not just like Stern Pimble, right?

[10:45] Wizard of Oz when it originally came out in 2013.

[10:48] Jack Gwinnari sold the game for $7,000.

[10:51] I think early pre-order people even got in for cheaper at $6,500.

[10:55] But what would Wizard of Oz?

[10:57] This fully featured wide body game.

[10:59] And today's rate, that $7,000 Wizard of Oz today would be $8,899.

[11:06] And if you just go original price to price, Toy Story Collector's Edition is 114 percent

[11:12] more money than Wizard of Oz was originally sold for.

[11:16] It's crazy.

[11:17] And I could just do this with every single game.

[11:19] All of these games are inflated.

[11:21] They're over-inflated by the manufacturers.

[11:23] And here's where it just gets nuts.

[11:25] And I mean this.

[11:26] And everyone always says this.

[11:27] If you go look at the Bali Williams games and you look at what Bali Williams put into

[11:31] their Pimble machines and then you put it next to these modern machines, I get the modern

[11:36] machines have more coding and more depth.

[11:38] But mechanical engineering.

[11:40] That is what makes Pimble special.

[11:42] Do you want me to read these prices right now?

[11:45] A Twilight Zone in 1993 was $3,1995.

[11:53] You could put it in your home.

[11:54] If we adjust that for inflation today, guess how much a wide-body Twilight Zone would

[12:00] be two day people?

[12:01] Are you sitting down?

[12:03] $6,548 is what that machine should cost today.

[12:10] Basically the price of a Stern Pro today.

[12:12] Do you know how much more money James Bond Ellie is over Twilight Zone after we adjust

[12:18] for inflation?

[12:19] James Bond Ellie is 98.5% more expensive than Twilight Zone would be if it came out today.

[12:28] And it doesn't get any better for Toy Story Collectors edition, which is 129% more expensive

[12:35] than Twilight Zone would be if it came out today.

[12:38] 129%.

[12:39] Circus Voltaire people, this is crazy.

[12:42] In 1998, you could get a Circus Voltaire for $2,300.

[12:47] That means today it would be $4,179.

[12:52] James Bond Ellie, 211% more.

[12:56] Toy Story Collectors edition, 259% more than Circus Voltaire.

[13:01] Now obviously people, Pimble has grown in popularity.

[13:05] Obviously there are more home collectors than ever before.

[13:08] And obviously that is what is driving up the price of these games.

[13:12] What is not driving up the price of these games is that a lot more is going into these

[13:17] games.

[13:18] There is no modern Pimble machine that has more mechanically in it than Twilight Zone.

[13:25] And that is why Twilight Zone and Lord the Rings are really important to look at.

[13:29] Because how come they could make these games for those prices?

[13:33] How come we could get that much into a Pimble machine back then?

[13:36] And now we are getting almost nothing in a game like Toy Story.

[13:40] How come James Bond is so expensive?

[13:43] Why is it so expensive?

[13:44] Why is there such a price increase from James Bond to Godzilla?

[13:48] And is this the new norm?

[13:49] Stern has not told us that this is just an inflated game because of all the licensing issues.

[13:54] They have not said anything.

[13:56] Have we ever seen Stern Pimble really lower the price over the last five, six years?

[14:00] No we haven't.

[14:01] So I think a lot of us out there are starting to realize if this is the new normal and these

[14:06] Pimble machines are this much money, then I just can't get excited about spending this

[14:11] much money on Pimble.

[14:14] There's too much everybody and when you run the numbers like this and you see how much

[14:18] it is and then you see what they're going to pull with this like 60th anniversary game

[14:22] with Keith L. and with James Bond where they're going to give it to distributors to set

[14:26] the price.

[14:27] I don't like it.

[14:28] Who the hell wants to wake up and spend 20 to 25 thousand dollars on a single level

[14:34] Pimble machine and then have to justify it.

[14:37] It makes absolutely no sense to me.

[14:39] You have to make 50 thousand dollars before taxes to buy a single level game in 2022

[14:46] and Stern doesn't want to seem greedy.

[14:48] They don't want to be the bad cop.

[14:50] They don't want to tell you the price and I don't like the fact that they're not going

[14:53] to set in MSRP.

[14:55] Like why wouldn't they set in MSRP?

[14:57] We have no foundation to judge what this game is worth and doing it this way stinks for

[15:02] everybody.

[15:03] It stinks for everybody except for the distributors who are going to bait these people

[15:07] on day one and then they're going to lose money.

[15:09] Go look at what happened with El Vira 40th everybody.

[15:12] Here's what happened.

[15:13] They gave that game to distributors for $15,000 but it was supposed to be a secret and

[15:18] the distributors got together and they all asked $25,000 for the game and they hooked some

[15:23] early people and some of you listening to this right now you bought one for $25,000 and

[15:29] then what happened right?

[15:30] They made $199 of them but there weren't $199 people willing to spend $25,000 and then

[15:36] what happened?

[15:37] They kept lowering the price trying to find new buyers and eventually distributors were

[15:41] calling around to people offering the game for $17,000 because they were still making

[15:47] $2,000 off the top of the game and so that is what a distributor should make on a game

[15:52] like $1,500 to $2,000 but for those guys who bought a $25K they lost $8,000 in value on

[16:00] the game and good luck trying to sell one now for $25,000 or anywhere close to that.

[16:04] If it sounds like I'm really energetic or heated about this it's because I am because

[16:09] I know these prices are overpriced we're not getting the value.

[16:13] Go into the toy story thread it's kind of sad reading what people are saying yeah it's

[16:17] a fun game but it's nowhere near worth the money.

[16:21] When did Pimball turn into this where you had to sell a kidney to get a machine and the

[16:25] prices are just going to keep going up and up and up as long as we all keep buying at

[16:30] these prices the only way to get them to slow down is to slow down the purchasing and

[16:36] that's something that no one else wants to tell you but that's what I'm doing.

[16:40] I can't tell you how to spend your money.

[16:41] I can't tell you how to live your life with Pimball but at this price point I just don't

[16:46] feel good about any of it and I mean it I don't feel good about any of it.

[16:50] It would have to be the ultimate dream theme packed with everything and even then even

[16:55] then why would I want to spend like 13 14 15 thousand dollars when just a few years ago

[17:01] these things were like 8000 or 7500 and even now as we run the numbers we're looking at

[17:06] the fact that these games are like 20 to 50% over what they should be right even if

[17:12] we put in the inflation these games are 20 to 50% more money than they really should be

[17:18] and what's happened is this and we all know what's happened these manufacturers have baked

[17:23] into the price the scalping and flipping prices of the game they saw what we were doing

[17:29] and I was one of them and they saw people buying low and selling high and they decided they

[17:33] want it more of that pie for themselves they wanted the cheddar to come through the door

[17:38] but how can anyone in this community feel good about this now because nobody's winning

[17:42] who is winning right now except for the manufacturers and we're customers who are not invested

[17:48] in these companies why would you want to see these companies inflate the price of these

[17:53] games to test us to see how much we're willing to spend how broke we're willing to go just

[17:58] to enjoy pinball why would anybody root for that why would anybody cheerly that I know

[18:03] some of my distributor friends are going to be pissed at me for saying this but I don't

[18:06] think it benefits anybody I don't even think the distributors want the prices to be higher

[18:11] because as they get higher they're going to get less and less people through the door

[18:15] and that's just where it's at that is my summary of twenty twenty two and pinball pricing

[18:21] is it's all overpriced and we all know it and we all have been feeling it and the vibes

[18:25] are not there like the good vibes a new game comes out and we're like oh like can erase

[18:30] the fact of how much they cost and you know it's crazy is this is not even including

[18:34] like tax and it's not including shipping and now all of a sudden think about it how much

[18:39] is it if you buy a toy story collectors edition tax and shipping you're at like sixteen

[18:45] thousand five hundred dollars out the door for that game a game with no toys for sixteen

[18:51] five James Bond is fourteen five for a stern machine that they are going to make a thousand

[18:58] of them they're not even close to being rare I can see ice man right now down in Texas

[19:03] standing up and giving canada a standing ovation because everybody feels this everybody feels

[19:08] this these games are not worth it and the market is going to get soft real fast if this

[19:14] thing keeps going in this direction there's only one way out of it they've either got

[19:18] a lower prices or competitors have to come in with better value or they need to pack

[19:22] these machines where you're never going to want to sell it because if you try to move

[19:26] these games on you you're just going to be losing thousands and thousands of dollars

[19:29] everybody everybody it's good to be back in front of the microphone I hope I didn't scare

[19:34] you but I'm just encouraging each and every one of you hit the brakes a little bit start

[19:38] to look at the numbers start to analyze what these companies are doing to us and they

[19:43] are not giving us the value they're not and the numbers don't lie they are absolutely

[19:47] baking in the flipping price into the price of the game and there is no value there for

[19:53] us because then when we go to sell the machine we can't get as much out of it yes and every

[19:58] once in a while there's going to be an anomaly game like Godzilla that's worth it but that's

[20:02] going to be few and far between everything else what's going to happen they're going to

[20:05] go south really fast everybody thank you for being a member of the Canadian club I'm

[20:10] not always this energetic I think I just had too many coffees this morning but I'm glad

[20:14] to have all you here we're going to be back with more shows this week look even when there's

[20:17] no news can it can make something interesting happen on his podcast we'll talk to you soon

[20:21] Katie Perry take us out
