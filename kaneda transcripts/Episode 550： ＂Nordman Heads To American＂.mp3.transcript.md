[00:00] Oh, welcome to episode 550 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:15] Happy Sunday night, everybody.

[00:17] If you haven't gone to the Twippies yet and voted for all your favorite Pimball personalities

[00:22] and games and designers and callouts, please head over to this weekend Pimball and make

[00:27] sure you vote for Canada for favorite Pimball Podcasts.

[00:30] We're going to go 4x4.

[00:31] I hope 4x4 can be in Jack Danger, both do it.

[00:34] So here's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[00:37] The man who gets around more than anybody, Mr. Dennis Nordman is now over at American

[00:42] Pimball.

[00:43] There was a great interview on the super awesome Pimball show with David Fix and Dennis

[00:47] Nordman.

[00:48] You should go check it out.

[00:49] I just listened to it.

[00:50] And I'm going to break down some of the key points of that interview and will this new

[00:54] American Pimball?

[00:55] Will this be a reset of a company that everyone is wanting to see turn a corner?

[01:01] And I really do think the stuff they're saying is very positive and I think a lot of people

[01:05] out there are going to want to see American Pimball turn a corner and start to make games

[01:10] that people actually want to buy.

[01:13] Because this company builds games so well, they know how to manufacture.

[01:18] Now let's just put stuff on the line that people want to buy.

[01:20] So we're going to talk about what Dennis Nordman going over there means.

[01:24] And the new strategy over at American Pimball.

[01:27] Before we do that, a couple news items you might have seen that Dwight Sullivan dropped

[01:32] in a pin-side thread that Stern is going to make Godzilla and that people are fighting

[01:37] over getting that Godzilla theme.

[01:39] Now we've known for a few years now that Stern Pimball stole the Godzilla license, the

[01:45] Toho Godzilla license.

[01:47] They stole it from Charlie Emory.

[01:49] It was Charlie and Bugs dream theme and Stern's been sitting on it for a few years now.

[01:55] Now we are hearing that this game is in the mix over at Stern.

[01:59] Will this be a Keith L. Win game?

[02:01] I have to say right now.

[02:02] I have to say right now.

[02:03] I don't think Godzilla is a cornerstone theme.

[02:07] I don't.

[02:08] I really don't.

[02:09] I know that it's a very popular franchise.

[02:11] I know it's been around for a very long time.

[02:14] But again, I keep getting back to this thing of what grown men do you know between the

[02:18] ages of 40 and 60.

[02:20] If you were to list their dream Pimball themes, how many of them are saying Godzilla?

[02:26] We already have had Godzilla movies.

[02:27] Why do we need another one?

[02:29] And if you go deep into the Japanese Toho version of Godzilla, the fan base gets even smaller

[02:35] and smaller I would assume.

[02:37] So I don't know.

[02:38] I don't think this is going to be like a home run theme.

[02:40] Take my money now.

[02:41] Kind of game.

[02:42] But we will see.

[02:43] Alright.

[02:44] What else is going on in Pimball?

[02:45] Can I ask everybody out there to do one thing right now?

[02:48] Can I ask everybody in the Pimball world to do one thing right now?

[02:52] Can everybody just give deep root a chance to get it done?

[02:55] And I mean this.

[02:57] When I go into the thread and I'm as skeptical as everybody else out there, I did not give pre-order

[03:02] money to deep root.

[03:04] I did not split a game with Mr. Dave Peck.

[03:06] The more I thought about it, it goes against everything I've said on Canadian Pimball podcast.

[03:12] I can't take this mic.

[03:14] I can't tell you year after year after year.

[03:17] Don't be fooled by a company's pre-order schemes.

[03:20] I can't get up here and say that.

[03:22] It would be so hypocritical of me to interrogate companies like highway Pimball when they were

[03:26] doing this pre-order model and people weren't getting their games.

[03:30] When Kevin Coolick did pre-order and people didn't get their games.

[03:33] When John Papadu did pre-orders and people didn't get their games, the list goes on and

[03:37] on of the amount of times people have been burned when pre-order model was the way people

[03:43] were promised their games.

[03:44] I'll even add Dutch Pimball into that mix because I know people are getting games now,

[03:49] but this is like five years later from when Barry took pre-order dollars.

[03:53] So I could not with good faith go against all of my advice to all of my listeners and pre-order

[03:59] a game, especially without seeing the most important thing, which is a manufacturing

[04:04] line.

[04:05] But here is why I think everyone needs to give deep root a break and I'll explain why.

[04:08] It's over.

[04:09] The order banks are closed.

[04:12] So if you go into the deep root threads and rag on everybody who put a deposit down,

[04:18] why are you doing that?

[04:20] Like why are you obsessed, you deep root hater right now for dragging these guys over the

[04:25] coal?

[04:26] Like they gave their money and now they're hoping they get a game.

[04:29] So I look at it like look, I think they were kind of silly for doing it.

[04:34] Don't get me wrong.

[04:35] I would not have done it until I saw a manufacturing line and I definitely would not have done

[04:39] it because it was a non-refundable deposit, but something these gentlemen saw compelled

[04:45] them enough to do it.

[04:47] And order banks are closed.

[04:49] So the other reason why we shouldn't keep attacking this company right now, it's not

[04:53] set up to go down a Ponzi scheme road like the other companies that have done this before.

[04:59] Like when John couldn't finish Magic Girl, he started selling Uraza.

[05:03] Right now we know deep root will not reveal their second title and take deposits on food

[05:08] truck until all of the Roses are built and shipped.

[05:12] So there's not going to be this like, oh pay for game two, you know, because they easily

[05:16] could have done what Andrew Highway would have done is they would have said, okay, Goonies

[05:19] is next, who wants the preorder Goonies, give us your money now and they need that Goonies

[05:23] money to build the Roses, but that's not happening.

[05:26] So I think everyone out there needs to take a chill pill.

[05:29] You know who you are, you know who you are going into that thread and just be raiding everybody.

[05:35] For everyone who's in on this game, all I can say to you is good luck.

[05:40] I wish you luck.

[05:41] I hope you get your game, but I also do think you are somewhat crazy for pre-ordering

[05:48] a game without seeing any manufacturing.

[05:52] So either Robert has all this ready to go and he's going to sandbag all of us and there's

[05:57] like a hundred games waiting in a secret room somewhere ready to go out in a few weeks

[06:01] because right now the people who pre-ordered this game, they're expecting these games to

[06:05] ship within just a few weeks and we know and I know and you know that it takes way longer

[06:14] than just a few weeks if all of the parts have not been ordered yet for these games and

[06:19] you heard on my last show with Ben Heck, you can't start making a game until every single

[06:24] part is in the factory.

[06:26] And so if people talk to Robert last week and they're still ordering stuff, there is

[06:30] no way they can hit go on that line until everything is under one roof.

[06:34] But I don't know, maybe they've got some octo pat in it way to make these games that nobody

[06:38] knows about.

[06:39] Okay, but give them a break.

[06:40] I really mean that.

[06:41] Don't berate these people throughout the entire month of January.

[06:44] Alright, let's move on to American Pimball.

[06:47] Arguably the company that I have raked over the coals more than any other company in

[06:52] the history of Pimball companies and rightfully so because I want American Pimball to be successful.

[06:59] American Pimball I think finally wants to be successful.

[07:03] And I think they are finally realizing that the formula for success, it isn't that hard.

[07:08] And I think they finally have enough players on the court who know what they're doing.

[07:13] When I first heard that Dennis Norman was joining American Pimball, I thought that maybe

[07:18] it was just him and I did roll my eyes a little bit because Dennis has been everywhere.

[07:22] Dennis has been at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:24] Dennis has been at highway Pimball.

[07:26] Dennis has been at Valley Williams.

[07:28] Dennis has been contracted with Stern to make Elvira.

[07:32] Dennis was over at Multimorphic for a while.

[07:34] Dennis was over at Chicago Gaming Company for a while.

[07:37] Dennis was over at Deeproot for a few years and now he's over at American Pimball.

[07:41] Now, if you add up all of those companies, Dennis Norman has been at what isn't one to

[07:47] one.

[07:48] There hasn't been a game for each one of his stops at these companies.

[07:52] And if you listen to him though, the main reason why he normally leaves is one thing

[07:56] once he realizes that this thing isn't going well and they don't know how to manufacture

[08:01] this stuff or get this stuff to market, he's out.

[08:03] So I can't quite blame him because it's not like he's left companies that have really

[08:08] just blown it out of the park.

[08:10] It's not like he left Deeproot and Deeproot has six games in the market right now.

[08:13] It's not like he left highway Pimball and highway Pimball has been so successful since

[08:17] Dennis Norman left.

[08:18] What I do know about Dennis Norman is that he's an incredible Pimball designer, people love

[08:23] his games and this is nothing but great news.

[08:27] Now I want to go over the key points that they talked about and give you my feedback on

[08:31] the stuff they said.

[08:32] Now most of the talking was done by David Fix, who's the new marketing and sales manager

[08:36] over at American Pimball.

[08:38] And I think David is more than that.

[08:39] I think David is their George Gomez and I've said this for a very long time.

[08:44] What American Pimball does not have is their George Gomez and I think David is a great

[08:49] acquisition because I think he understands enough of the elements that it takes to bring

[08:54] a Pimball machine to market and I think it's no longer just going to be like Kugler and

[08:59] Balser and Dovel trying to figure this out.

[09:02] And I think he is a great pick up for American Pimball.

[09:05] Now what is the goal of the new American Pimball?

[09:08] They say this that their goal is to go from making just one game every 18 months to making

[09:14] two to three games a year.

[09:16] And they want to ship two American Pimball games in 2021.

[09:22] So that is a lofty goal.

[09:24] I mean, Jersey Jack Pimball with its big team has never been able to ship two games in

[09:29] a year.

[09:30] But I do think when you hear David talk, he says we can't stay competitive if we just

[09:35] release one game and that's the only game we're selling for a very long period of time.

[09:40] And you absolutely cannot be successful if you launch games like Houdini and October

[09:45] Fest in which people don't want them and that's all you've got.

[09:49] There's no way for them to make up the mistakes if one of their games is not a hit.

[09:54] Right now the way AP has to do it, every game has to knock it out of the park and none

[09:58] of their titles have yet.

[10:00] Here's the most exciting news to me.

[10:01] Dennis Norman is going to be the senior designer over there.

[10:05] They've also brought on three junior game designers.

[10:08] When I heard that, when I heard that, I dropped my headphones, I started doing a dance

[10:14] in my room because this is exactly the most exciting element of all of this.

[10:20] We are going to get young talent into this Pimball company.

[10:24] I've always said the future of Pimball is the youth.

[10:28] We need young people who have ambition, who have ideas, who want to make a name for themselves.

[10:34] That is who will make the next greatest Pimball machines.

[10:37] That is where Keith L. Wyn came from, Scott Dinesi, Eric Minier, and they're bringing

[10:42] on three junior game designers.

[10:44] Here's the best part.

[10:45] They are also going to learn from the sensei Dennis Norman, who knows so much about how

[10:51] to make a great shooting Pimball machine.

[10:53] The other thing Dennis loves to do, and he says that in the interview, he loves to pack

[10:57] his games.

[10:58] You are not going to see a barren, empty, hot wheels game ever again from American Pimball.

[11:04] Now that Dennis Norman is over there.

[11:06] This combination of three junior game designers with Dennis Norman, this is great.

[11:12] They also said that there's going to be a new game in the next six months from one of

[11:16] the junior designers.

[11:18] They also said that they had game four ready to go, but they scrapped it.

[11:22] They moved on to game number five.

[11:24] I am hearing that Valkyrie was supposed to be game four, so I don't know if that's true

[11:30] or not, but I'm happy to know that whatever that game was, they scrapped it.

[11:34] Now you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that that must have been Joe

[11:38] Bosser's next game, because he was working on games four and five with them or at least

[11:43] game four.

[11:44] What's happening to Joe Bosser?

[11:46] So he is no longer coming into American Pimball every day.

[11:49] They are still going to work with him on a contractual basis.

[11:53] They referred to him as a contractor, and what they mean by that is that Joe can design

[11:58] his game at his house, and he can bring it to us.

[12:02] And if we're interested in it, we will then think about making it.

[12:06] So but he is no longer coming into AP every day.

[12:09] He's not going to be guiding these three junior designers.

[12:12] He's not going to be working with Dennis Norman on these projects right now.

[12:16] And look, I'm just going to say it.

[12:18] That's good news.

[12:19] They needed to shake stuff up.

[12:20] They needed to get a new designer in there, and this is a really good move.

[12:24] Now they did not say who these junior designers are, but they did say when you see these people,

[12:30] you will know their names.

[12:31] Wow, so let me guess who I think they are.

[12:34] I think you're going to see Jack Danger maybe join them because he's got a game.

[12:38] And I'm not sure Stern's going to let Jack into the mix.

[12:41] You've also got Ryan McQuade who did Sonic Pimball.

[12:44] Maybe he's going to become a new junior designer.

[12:46] You've got Scott from Riot Pimball.

[12:48] Maybe he's going to join.

[12:49] I mean, you've got that game already designed the Legends of Bahala game.

[12:53] And also they're bringing on board Kevin Kool-Aid, a predator fame.

[12:56] No, I'm joking.

[12:57] They're not bringing on board Kevin Kool-Aid.

[12:58] But we will know their names.

[13:00] Okay, that's exciting.

[13:01] So Dennis lives 45 minutes from American Pimball.

[13:05] And he's taking a full-time job there.

[13:07] So he is not going to just like consult on the side.

[13:11] He is taking a salary.

[13:13] He is an employee with benefits.

[13:15] So he is looking to plant roots at American Pimball.

[13:19] Now they did ask him why haven't you planted roots at all of the places you've stopped at?

[13:24] And Dennis didn't really talk that much in the interview.

[13:28] And Dennis is very candid.

[13:29] And I think one of the reasons why is it's probably hard for Dennis not to tell you how

[13:34] he really feels about a lot of the places he's been at.

[13:38] But he did drop some bombshells.

[13:40] He said he was paid by Deeproot for two years.

[13:43] And he made three awesome games for them.

[13:46] But he never had an engineer to help the games progress.

[13:50] Let me repeat that.

[13:51] He has three amazing games designed for Robert and the Deeproot team.

[13:54] But no engineers to help make the game a reality.

[13:58] Now if that's not another red flag for all you pre-odor guys, I don't know man.

[14:03] I don't know how far along are all these games.

[14:06] He said he worked at Multimorphic, but Jerry ran out of money.

[14:10] And so wow, there's there's that.

[14:11] He also went over to Chicago Gaming Company.

[14:14] Now we know Chicago Gaming Company takes a year and a day to get anything done over there.

[14:19] And so it makes sense that if Dennis Norman went over to CGC and they already had a few

[14:24] remakes in the works, they have Mark Richie doing a game.

[14:26] They have Ben Heck doing a game.

[14:28] I think Dennis just saw the schedule at CGC and said, you know, I'm going to be sitting

[14:32] on my hands for a couple years if I joined CGC right now.

[14:36] So maybe I should go to the one place that really needs a new designer.

[14:41] And that's American Pimball.

[14:43] And I think it's a great move because American Pimball much like Stern, much like any successful

[14:48] Pimball Company.

[14:49] American Pimball has the foundation of a great Pimball company.

[14:53] They know how to manufacture stuff.

[14:55] They know how to manufacture stuff very well.

[14:58] And I think this is awesome because when you talk to Dennis and you talk about the timelines,

[15:03] they want to get two games out a year.

[15:05] Do you want to know how fast Dennis Norman said he can get a white wood done for a game?

[15:09] Do you want to know how fast now if you're a John Papaduke fan, close your ears right

[15:14] now.

[15:15] If you've been waiting four to five years for John's games to come out or deep roots

[15:18] games, he said he could get a white wood ready to go in two months time.

[15:24] Two months from a start of a concept to a model.

[15:27] Now he does make his models out of foam core first and he sees his games in three dimension

[15:32] and he likes to design that way.

[15:34] And who am I, a podcaster to tell him there's a better way to do it?

[15:38] Dennis did also say that he is working with Christopher Franchi on a game for Chicago

[15:43] gaming company.

[15:44] Now look, if this man is this efficient and can get a design done in just a few months,

[15:50] then obviously Dennis could give CGC a game.

[15:53] He could give deep root a few games.

[15:55] He could give Stern Elvira.

[15:56] I mean, the man is very prolific and can get stuff done.

[16:00] So I'm happy though that he's now going to be in charge over to American pinball.

[16:04] And so I'm also here to tell you that Christopher Franchi will be doing the artwork on Ben

[16:08] Hex game, which is also exciting.

[16:10] And I want to say this, I know there's been like some back and forth beef with Franchi

[16:16] and myself.

[16:17] I have always said, I love this man's artwork.

[16:20] I want to see this man's artwork on pinball machines.

[16:24] The last time we saw his artwork on a game, he won best art package of the year.

[16:28] So we can't wait to see some more Christopher Franchi.

[16:31] And we're going to see it on CGC games.

[16:33] They even offered him some work over at American pinball.

[16:36] Now Franchi is a contractor so he can actually apply his skills to multiple people.

[16:41] But, but I will say this, he has a very unique style.

[16:45] And pinball is too small to have your work appear on competitor games.

[16:49] Like that's the other thing too.

[16:51] You need to have some loyalty in pinball.

[16:53] You can't just give your skills to million things because artwork is different than music.

[16:57] I mean this because artwork really is one of the first things that people see.

[17:02] And it really differentiates a game even more than music.

[17:05] I know David Field does music, but I don't think people would feel like field doing music

[17:10] for different companies would really would really hurt their competitive advantage.

[17:14] I think everybody would want David Field to do music in almost every game because he's

[17:18] so good, but art's different.

[17:20] I think you have to have exclusive artists.

[17:23] Stern would never let zombie Eddie go do another art package for someone else.

[17:26] I'm not even sure if Stern kicked Erdi Donny to the curb because he did other projects

[17:30] without consulting with Stern.

[17:31] Who knows?

[17:32] I don't know.

[17:33] Don't take me for that.

[17:34] Right now Dennis said that he has three games done and another one that is coming shortly.

[17:40] And here's the one thing though.

[17:41] And this is my advice for American Pimball because when you ask Dennis, do you like license

[17:46] themes or unlicensed themes?

[17:48] He says I like doing both, but I want to say right now, American Pimball, for you to succeed,

[17:55] you need to create a license theme game that people want.

[17:59] You can't keep doing these unlicensed theme games.

[18:03] And they said that they want their two to three games a year to be a mixture of both

[18:08] license games and unlicensed games.

[18:11] We'll see how that pans out.

[18:13] We've just seen in the history of Pimball the only game that really successfully came

[18:18] out as an unlicensed game recently was TNA.

[18:22] Black Knight was a sales catastrophe for Stern.

[18:25] But what we haven't seen, and I mean this, what we have not seen in the unlicensed theme

[18:31] category, we have not seen a fully featured jam pack game that had so much in it.

[18:37] If you are going to make an unlicensed theme work, it needs to be jam packed and that

[18:43] world under glass needs to be incredible.

[18:46] It needs to feel like you put so much more in it because you didn't have to spend any

[18:49] money on the license.

[18:51] Nobody feels that way when they look at TNA.

[18:53] Nobody feels that way when they look at Black Knight.

[18:56] And Raza is the one that's trying, trying to do this.

[19:00] Now look, I'm not going to go down a Raza road here, but did they sell two to 300 Raza's

[19:05] if they did, then that would be impressive because it isn't unlicensed theme.

[19:10] They also say they have an ace up their sleeve and it's the fact that they have Roger

[19:15] Sharp working with American Pimball.

[19:18] Everybody knows Roger.

[19:19] He's the licensing guru.

[19:20] He's the guy that actually helped Dutch Pimball get all of the assets they needed for big

[19:24] Lebowski when they screwed that whole thing up.

[19:27] He also helped them with Hot Wheels.

[19:29] Now Roger's going to be doing the licensing deals.

[19:32] Now what I did like is they said that they don't ever want to license a game unless

[19:37] they get all of the assets they need.

[19:40] They want all the music, all the characters, all the call outs, all the clips from that

[19:45] movie.

[19:46] They said they don't want to make a game that leaves the stuff out you love.

[19:50] And Dennis Nordman said it.

[19:51] He basically said alien is stupid because Sigourney Weaver, who's the main character in

[19:57] alien, is not in the game.

[19:59] And he's like, I don't like that.

[20:02] He's been saying that for years on Canadian Spinball Podcasts, I agree.

[20:05] How do you make Batman and Robin without Batman?

[20:08] How do you make these games without the lead character?

[20:11] You know, same thing with Jersey Jack Pimball, I'm pired to the Caribbean without Johnny

[20:14] Dept.

[20:15] It doesn't work.

[20:16] He makes that franchise.

[20:18] They also said they are going to go to a standard cabinet.

[20:21] So we're not going to see the Houdini Backbox, be the Hot Wheels Backbox.

[20:25] They are going to create a standard cabinet.

[20:27] They're also going to consider doing a pro, premium and Ellie versions of these games.

[20:33] David, you know that's how you need to do it.

[20:35] It's how you make money.

[20:37] American Pimball needs to make some games that feel like they're for the collectors and

[20:42] they have yet to do that.

[20:43] But here's the silliest thing I heard.

[20:45] They said they are still going to manufacture Houdini and October Fest.

[20:50] Why?

[20:51] Why do you want to still make these games that are $2000 or more cheaper than they are

[20:56] new in box?

[20:57] Who in their right mind would buy a new in box October Fest or Houdini?

[21:02] David, new error, a new chapter in American Pimball.

[21:06] That is part of AP's pass.

[21:08] Don't ever go back to those two games.

[21:11] Don't.

[21:12] It's over.

[21:13] Nobody wants those games.

[21:14] Why would you make them new in box again?

[21:16] That is the stuff where I'm like, you know why?

[21:18] We all know why because they're probably sitting on a ton of parts because if you listen

[21:23] to them, they were supposed to make a thousand of each.

[21:26] So they probably are sitting on a few hundred parts for each of those games that are in boxes.

[21:32] So might as well make them, but you're going to have to put a discount price on those

[21:35] because the prices on both those games have plummeted.

[21:38] Josh Kugler will still be the lead coder for American Pimball.

[21:43] They did not mention if they're bringing new animators on board.

[21:46] All right.

[21:47] So a lot of changes over at American Pimball.

[21:50] Let me give my final analysis of this whole thing.

[21:53] American Pimball needs license themes.

[21:55] If the next game that comes out is an unlicensed theme with everything that's in the marketplace

[22:01] right now, I just think they're going to have a really hard time.

[22:05] I bet everybody out there can't wait to see the game that Dennis Nordman works on, but

[22:09] it's not the next one.

[22:10] This is a junior designer.

[22:12] They might announce that the next game is Legends of Valhalla or Wrath of Olympus.

[22:17] If they bring Scott on from Riot, he's got two games fully designed.

[22:21] There's a fully designed Sonic the Hedgehog game.

[22:24] There's a fully designed nightmare before Christmas game.

[22:27] So there are a lot of exciting games in the homebrew market that if they picked up one

[22:32] of these designers, we might see one of these games pretty quickly.

[22:37] Ultimately, we are at the point right now where your intentions don't matter.

[22:41] What you say you're going to do does not matter.

[22:44] The proof is in the pudding.

[22:46] People want to see worlds under glass.

[22:49] People want games that they want.

[22:51] They want themes that make them want to take their money out of their wallet and give

[22:55] it to pinball companies.

[22:56] David said that this market is so right right now.

[22:59] People are gobbling up games left and right.

[23:02] An American pinball has struggled to get anyone to really feel excited about their offerings.

[23:08] So this is the new American pinball.

[23:10] A lot will ride on this new game.

[23:13] And I really wish them the best of luck because I want there to be a competitor to Stern.

[23:20] And I mean that I want there to be a company that can ship two to three games a year because

[23:24] Jersey Jack games are amazing.

[23:26] But man, the weight is forever.

[23:28] It takes so long to wait for a new Jersey Jack game.

[23:32] And would it be great if we just had more alternatives to Stern pinball?

[23:36] If we had quality games that a company could stand behind that had a world under glass that

[23:41] was built well, that was based on a theme we want.

[23:44] That's all we want from pinball.

[23:46] And so David seems to be putting the right people on the court, but now they have to get

[23:51] it done.

[23:52] It's still premature.

[23:53] It is there is no victory lapse because of what I heard on that interview.

[23:56] I think David Fix is the George Gomez that American pinball has needed all these years

[24:01] because I don't think that Dovel has the creative vision for this company.

[24:04] And I think David and Dennis can put a creative vision on the table that this company can run

[24:11] with and with three young designers.

[24:13] That's the most exciting part about all of this.

[24:15] Those three young designers, I really expect big things from new talent in pinball.

[24:22] It's a good day to hear this is happening.

[24:24] Now let's see it happen.

[24:26] That's it.

[24:27] The rubber has to meet the road and let's see these guys execute.

[24:29] We know they can make in ship games.

[24:31] Isn't that just like a huge relief?

[24:34] Just knowing American pinball knows how to make in ship games.

[24:37] Everyone else out there that's like new to the market or these new boutiques, they haven't

[24:41] proven they can do that.

[24:42] So I feel good about this because these guys know the hard part.

[24:46] Now they get to figure out the fun stuff.

[24:49] The fun stuff is making the artwork amazing on these games and they've always messed up

[24:53] the fun stuff AP.

[24:56] This is the moment.

[24:57] David, it's all yours.

[24:58] Dennis, it's all yours.

[25:00] Congratulations, gentlemen.

[25:01] I look forward to seeing what American pinball can do.

[25:04] Canada episode 500 and like 50 out.

[25:07] Thank you everyone for your support, for your Twippy votes.

[25:10] I really appreciate it.

[25:11] We'll be back with more episodes of Canada's pinball podcast sometime this week.
