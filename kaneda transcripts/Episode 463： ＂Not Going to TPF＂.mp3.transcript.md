[00:00] Now we do have some breaking news moments ago.

[00:07] Actor Tom Hanks, his wife Rita Wilson, they have tested positive for coronavirus.

[00:12] Monster News, the NBA has suspended the season after Rudy Go Bear has tested positive

[00:19] for coronavirus.

[00:20] And we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing and reducing large gatherings.

[00:27] No one does it better than the Texas pinball festival.

[00:32] If you see a packed train car, let it go by, wait for the next train, same with the, if you're

[00:41] taking a bus, it's the density, the proximity that we are trying to reduce.

[00:48] As of today, I believe that it's abundantly clear that we need to postpone Geron's epic

[00:53] battle five.

[00:58] Welcome to episode 463 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[01:05] And as you heard, leading into the show The World, as we know it, for the short term is

[01:12] about to change for everyone.

[01:16] And I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcasts, the impact that

[01:21] this will have on our lives, on the pinball world, the pinball community and everything

[01:27] you've been planning.

[01:28] Now, I'm not going to talk too macro about this because you know the story, you know the

[01:33] issue with the coronavirus, you know how it's starting to impact all of our daily lives,

[01:38] you know how it's spreading through the media.

[01:41] How our media today and our social media today is perfectly engineered for this type

[01:48] of paranoia and this type of extreme, extreme overreaction to something like this.

[01:56] But I will say I don't think people are overreacting.

[02:02] There is a reason why there's a reason why the experts, the medical leaders, the private

[02:08] sector, the politicians, everyone agrees that we need to take all necessary measures to

[02:15] get this thing under control.

[02:17] So what does that mean for the pinball world?

[02:20] This is a pinball podcast.

[02:21] This isn't a political podcast.

[02:23] This isn't a lifestyle podcast.

[02:25] It's a pinball podcast.

[02:26] I think very simply the topics I want to talk about, what does this mean for the pinball

[02:32] shows coming up?

[02:34] What does this mean for the pinball manufacturers and how they're going to be able to conduct

[02:40] business?

[02:41] What does this mean for the pinball operators out there in the world?

[02:46] I think those three pillars to me are going to be severely impacted by this in the short

[02:52] term.

[02:53] And we don't know when the end will come and life as we knew it will return to normal.

[03:01] Now this hit personal for me last night because I was supposed to fly to Ireland for a wedding.

[03:06] I couldn't go because of my ribs.

[03:08] They still hurt too much.

[03:09] But my lovely wife Brenda was at the airport on a plane to Ireland that was supposed to

[03:15] take off at 8.20 p.m.

[03:18] So this is right as President Trump is talking about the travel ban from Europe.

[03:24] And so I called her up and luckily her plane was delayed and they weren't even announcing

[03:29] it on the plane that if you go to Europe you might not be able to get back for 30 days.

[03:36] Now it was unclear all the nations that would be impacted.

[03:40] Ireland was one in which you actually could go and come back.

[03:43] And it wasn't worth it.

[03:44] So I said babe get up, tell them what just happened and get off the plane.

[03:49] And so luckily for her she did she's back home with me and Baba and the poor bride had

[03:55] to just cancel her wedding on Sunday because now in Ireland they're saying that gatherings

[04:01] of more than 100 people should be eliminated right now.

[04:06] That means if you have a pinball show coming up and the sad reality is most likely setting

[04:13] in to all of the hard working people that worked really hard to get Texas pinball festival

[04:19] ready in a couple of weeks.

[04:21] And I know that Ed and Kim they spend all year working so hard on making this show the

[04:28] best pinball show in the world.

[04:30] And I think everyone agrees it is the best pinball show you can go to.

[04:34] And unfortunately I they haven't made an official announcement.

[04:38] I expect one to come any day now any hour now but I just don't see how you can continue

[04:47] to go on with the show.

[04:48] It's just at this point you have to look at the facts, you have to look at the realities

[04:53] of it.

[04:54] It's just not safe.

[04:56] There is a reason why every single major person who has studied how to get this thing under

[05:03] control.

[05:05] Just to washing your hands avoiding large crowds is something that everyone is advised

[05:10] to do.

[05:11] And Texas pinball festival gets 8 to 10,000 people who attend.

[05:17] And not just the number of people in the crowds that's the problem is a pinball machine is

[05:24] the worst device when it comes to spreading germs.

[05:29] You have strange people hopping on a machine using their hands and then more strangers

[05:35] coming on and there's quick turnover of using of that machine that other people could possibly

[05:43] contaminate.

[05:44] And it would be so sad to go into a pinball show and see people reluctant to playing the

[05:50] games because of this.

[05:52] And so because of that I fully expect them to cancel the show or postpone it to a later

[05:59] date.

[06:01] And I don't know if they have insurance or not.

[06:03] I hope they do.

[06:04] I also think that a lot of the fees associated with canceling some of these things will be

[06:10] waived.

[06:11] But there is obviously no way you're going to recoup all the time money and energy that

[06:17] went into planning such a large scale event.

[06:20] And I really feel terrible for all of the people and it's a lot of people that were planning

[06:26] to make Texas pinball festival a spectacular and bigger and better show than ever before.

[06:34] I feel bad for Jeff and all the people planning the trippy awards.

[06:38] I feel bad for all the pinball community from around the world and around the United States

[06:43] where this is the show where so many people plan their annual trips and they look forward

[06:50] to seeing all of their pinball friends that they usually only get to see once a year because

[06:55] this is the show in which most of us usually if you ask people what's the one show you're

[07:00] going to go to what's the one show that's worth it.

[07:04] It's always the Texas pinball festival and I know for so many of you out there this is

[07:09] just devastating news.

[07:11] It's a devastating thing to have to cancel your travel plans, cancel your flights, cancel

[07:16] your hotels and it just hurts emotionally knowing that you're not going to be able to

[07:21] meet your favorite friends and family and pinheads from around the world.

[07:26] And for all the manufacturers coming from other places from just it's a domino effect.

[07:33] You know it's just listening to the final round pinball podcast in which Marty was talking

[07:37] about coming over from Australia.

[07:39] I mean there's no way there is no way travel between Australia and the US.

[07:44] You know have to reports of Tom Hanks and there's reports that it's spreading through Australia.

[07:49] There's just no way it's the responsible thing to do and for so many of you out there who

[07:54] have families who have kids who have parents and grandparents, you just can't risk it.

[08:01] You can't risk it.

[08:02] You can't put your love of pinball in front of your health and in front of your safety

[08:08] and in front of the safety of your family.

[08:09] So you're going to have to avoid going and you know for me, you know someone wrote this

[08:15] on pinside and there's going to be like we're all going to we're all going to have to make

[08:19] drastic changes in our lifestyle in the near future and we're also going to need to find

[08:25] moments to laugh and make fun of the realities of what this is doing to everybody.

[08:31] I had someone wrote on pinside that it took the coronavirus to keep Canada from getting

[08:37] his third Twippy award and I did get a good chuckle with that but I'm here to tell

[08:42] you right now that I have suspended any plans to go to Texas pinball festival like I won't

[08:47] be going.

[08:49] What does this mean?

[08:50] You know and I just think that's going to happen and I think many of you out there are

[08:53] coming to this conclusion and yes there will be people that will say stuff like you're

[08:58] overreacting.

[08:59] The show should go on.

[09:01] Come on, buck up, man up.

[09:02] I don't think this is a moment to man up.

[09:06] I don't think this is a moment to just be brave and bravado.

[09:12] It's to me it's common sense.

[09:14] It's just if common sense says look you're it's in your I think it's it's our responsibility

[09:20] as citizens to just try and help get this thing under control and especially since Frisco

[09:26] Texas is one of the areas that has people reporting coronavirus.

[09:32] These are just our civic duty to not get into large crowds to not aid in a bet the spreading

[09:40] of this thing especially when pinball machines are so easily contaminated.

[09:45] So I expect T.P.F. to postpone.

[09:48] I expect the New York City pinball championships that are about to take place to also have

[09:53] to struggle with this.

[09:55] Pinfest, pinburg, any gathering, large gathering of people over a hundred is considered to

[10:02] be somewhat irresponsible.

[10:04] All these shows are going to have to think about it.

[10:06] But look here's the thing it's not just pinball.

[10:09] It's the NBA, it's March man.

[10:11] It's everything.

[10:12] It's people's weddings.

[10:13] It's people's honeymoon.

[10:14] It's this is impacting everybody.

[10:17] So everyone is going to mark 2020 as the year in which everything was disrupted by this.

[10:25] Everyone's jobs will be disrupted in some way.

[10:28] Everyone's livelihoods.

[10:30] You have kids at school.

[10:31] They're going to stay home.

[10:32] You now have to stay home.

[10:33] It's even hard to understand the sheer volume of stuff that will be impacted.

[10:39] Now let's get back to pinball.

[10:41] So I think the shows are all going to be postponed or canceled moving forward in the near future.

[10:48] So what does that mean now for what was the next thing is for manufacturers of pinball

[10:53] machines?

[10:54] Well, it's not a good time for pinball manufacturers.

[10:57] A few reasons.

[10:58] The economy is going to keep dipping and tanking.

[11:03] And so pinball sales are going to slow down.

[11:07] If you think they're not in a moment like this where people are trying to buy essentials,

[11:12] the thing that they will easily pass up buying right now is a non-essential pinball machine.

[11:18] Now we all knew that the economy was going to go through a period in which it slowed down

[11:22] and here it is.

[11:25] Here it is.

[11:26] The pinball machine sales are going to definitely, definitely slow down.

[11:31] I think you're also going to see people sell more machines, but the second hand market

[11:36] is going to dry up.

[11:37] I mean, I don't think people are going to rush to buy.

[11:40] If you're a manufacturer, so your sales are going to sink.

[11:43] If you're also a manufacturer, getting parts from China is going to be a big issue.

[11:49] The supply chain of what you need is going to be disrupted.

[11:53] So there's going to be delays, which I bet is music to the ears of Jersey Jack Pinball

[11:58] because I hear guns and roses is not ready for the line until May.

[12:04] So some people, these delays will maybe help them sort of avoid some of the spotlight of

[12:09] missing deadlines.

[12:11] There's no way that Hot Wheels is shipping the first week in April.

[12:14] No way.

[12:15] There's no way that's happening.

[12:17] For many reasons, one of which will be this, but another reason I heard they don't have

[12:20] any cabinets built and what they told you was misleading.

[12:24] But again, Canadian is just a bad guy that everyone says has a bone to pick with AP.

[12:28] I don't, but I just know that some manufacturers out there are misleading you, and I'm going

[12:33] to tell you when they are.

[12:34] But anyway, getting back to this, so there's going to be delay in parts.

[12:38] If you're travel banning movement of stuff, you really think Pinball Machine is a high

[12:43] priority item to make sure it gets from A to B.

[12:46] It's not.

[12:47] So you're going to see a lot of that and coupled that together, I think you're going to see

[12:52] people not opening up their wallets, especially stuff with stuff like this.

[12:58] Because again, as the markets crash, even the very wealthy people who are in this hobby,

[13:02] people are losing a lot of money.

[13:04] I would say it's a bad time probably for a company like Jersey Jack to move over there

[13:09] and have to restart things.

[13:10] I mean, are the buyers going to return as quickly as they as they did before?

[13:14] I think people who have large home collections are probably happy because they can play in

[13:19] their home and they don't have to go out.

[13:21] Let's talk about the impact to operators, to barcades.

[13:25] I think they're going to be in for a rough, rough few months.

[13:30] If your livelihood depends on people coming to your location to play games, how many people

[13:37] are going to feel comfortable going in there and playing your games?

[13:41] You can wipe down the machine after each person plays it.

[13:45] It seems like a logistical nightmare to have to do that.

[13:48] You can require people to use hand sanitizers.

[13:51] You have to wipe down the lockdown bar, the glass.

[13:54] People touch a lot of things on a pinball machine.

[13:56] Someone sneezes onto the machine.

[13:59] How are you going to do this?

[14:01] See what I'm saying?

[14:03] It's just safer to avoid it than to try to go through all the different variables of

[14:09] wiping something clean.

[14:11] And so I think operators are going to struggle.

[14:15] Some of them are going to fold.

[14:17] This will also be a real difficult time for some of these smaller boutique companies as

[14:22] well to sort of stay viable.

[14:25] This is definitely a worst case scenario for an industry like this, a non-essential product

[14:33] that is a thing we buy in moments of surplus, of financial surplus, of time surplus, right?

[14:41] Who needs a new pinball machine right now if you don't have time surplus on your, but

[14:46] look, again, as I said, a lot of us are going to be working from home.

[14:49] So my Rick and Morty is being built and moments like, oh man, I want to get it now.

[14:53] So I actually can just have it in my home and play the game because right now I don't

[14:57] have any and I might not want to go out and play pinball on location.

[15:01] So the impact of that is also going to be significant.

[15:05] And I think for all of us, it just changes life as usual.

[15:10] Our normal programming, the normal things we want to talk about start to seem even more

[15:16] trivial.

[15:17] I could keep talking about Hot Wheels and this and that and I could talk about how they're

[15:22] telling people at the show that it was a re-skin of another game they were making.

[15:26] So there we have it.

[15:27] Hot Wheels is a re-skin of poker run probably that every time that car spins around, someone

[15:32] punches, dovel in the balls.

[15:34] And that's why that mech is there now.

[15:36] But you know what I'm saying is we could talk about this stuff and we will.

[15:38] Look, this podcast is an inescapism from a lot of the stuff you don't want to see out

[15:45] in the real world and I understand that and I will continue to give you entertaining pinball

[15:49] content.

[15:50] But it's definitely going to hang over everything we talk about.

[15:56] What's Deeproot going to do?

[15:58] Deeproot was already to have people fly down there.

[16:01] They were already to reveal the product to the world.

[16:05] And now that five days of Deeproot or eight hours of Deep Roots plans and come to our

[16:11] auditorium and see Raza and talk, that's got to be canceled.

[16:16] I don't understand how you could keep that going.

[16:19] But here's the good news and here's what I think is going to come out of all of this.

[16:22] And here's where I think people are going to realize that going to all these shows, that

[16:27] flying around the country with your game and flying around the world with your product

[16:31] to show people a reveal has always been somewhat pointless and unnecessary.

[16:37] How did spooky pinball launch Rick and Morty?

[16:39] How did they sell all those games in four hours?

[16:42] They never took it to a show.

[16:43] They didn't put it on location.

[16:45] They didn't do a big panel Q&A.

[16:47] They simply just showed you the game using the internet, using videos on YouTube, using

[16:54] Twitch to stream it.

[16:55] I think more than ever now, as people stay home more and more, the availability to reach

[17:02] everybody is still there in abundance with the internet.

[17:05] And I think you're going to see companies simply do more online reveals and discussions

[17:12] and streams of their products.

[17:14] And you don't need to go to the show.

[17:16] So I expect Deeproot, if they have this big reveal moment, why don't they do this?

[17:21] Why don't they just announce a day and a time in which everyone in the world is going

[17:26] to be revealed the Deeproot plans all at the same time?

[17:29] Make it like a whole moment in event.

[17:32] Everybody would tune in.

[17:34] Why do something behind closed doors?

[17:36] Why do something that only a few people are invited to invite everybody in?

[17:41] Make yourself part of the community.

[17:43] They have a more humbled approach, pull back some of the secrecy.

[17:46] And look, if you want to go on Facebook Live and you want to go on Twitch and you want

[17:49] to stream, walk it around the Deeproot factory in the auditorium, absolutely do it.

[17:54] Start filming some high definition videos and images and just bombard us with everything

[18:00] that you were waiting to show people on that Wednesday, on next Wednesday, or two Wednesdays

[18:05] from now, right?

[18:06] March 24th.

[18:08] Simply go live with something.

[18:09] Make March 24th the day of Deeproot and just unleash the beast that you say you have

[18:16] and share it that way.

[18:18] And here's the other thing too.

[18:20] This almost terrifies me.

[18:22] The majority of people in this hobby, the majority of people who love pinball, they are

[18:26] going to be home and they are going to be on pinside.

[18:30] Pinside is going to turn into such a SHIT show.

[18:33] It's going to be nuts.

[18:34] Everyone's going to be just on their all day long because they're not going into work

[18:38] as much.

[18:39] And I hope you guys just treat each other with respect, treat each other with kindness.

[18:43] And of course, there's going to be a lack of that.

[18:46] Of course, that's never going to happen.

[18:48] And it's going to be a time in which all of us are huddled together online more than

[18:53] ever.

[18:54] And I will do my best to get you as much pinball content as I can on this show.

[18:59] It won't always be about the coronavirus and its impact on pinball.

[19:03] I want to get back to talking about Hot Wheels.

[19:06] And look, anyone who had plans to launch anything in March, they're still going to go forward

[19:10] with it because I don't think you can wait.

[19:12] It's like you can wait to the next show.

[19:14] I don't think MGC is going to happen.

[19:17] Arcade Expo got canceled.

[19:19] It's just not in the cards.

[19:20] You're just not going to be able to launch a product as usual.

[19:25] And so that's OK.

[19:26] Use the internet in a more effective way.

[19:28] Stirring pinball, using the internet in a more effective way, and they will.

[19:32] I fully expect them to do that.

[19:34] And I don't think there's going to be a shortage of stuff for us to talk about.

[19:38] But I do think the way all of us approach this hobby will also change.

[19:44] I think more and more people are thinking about their health, their safety, their family,

[19:49] the well-being of others around them.

[19:52] And I've said this.

[19:53] I've said this always on my show.

[19:54] If you've listened to Canadian pinball podcasts, pinball is not the center of the universe.

[19:58] It should not be the center of your universe.

[20:01] You should not make everything revolve around pinball.

[20:03] Look, there are some of you out there and you know who you are, the canceling of these

[20:07] trips.

[20:08] This is the thing you look forward to the most all year.

[20:12] And I'm not making fun of you if that's the case.

[20:15] But it shouldn't be the most important thing in your world.

[20:18] It shouldn't be the most important thing in your life.

[20:20] It shouldn't be the most devastating thing to happen.

[20:23] For some people, the devastation level is higher than others.

[20:26] Of course.

[20:27] I'm sure Eddie and Kim are just gutted.

[20:29] Absolutely gutted over this.

[20:31] And I'm sure all the people that worked hard on this are absolutely gutted and I'm friends

[20:34] with these people.

[20:35] Blake, Doom, and Snow are working on stuff.

[20:38] Christopher, Fran, she, you know, everyone had plans.

[20:40] We all had plans.

[20:42] We all had plans.

[20:43] Brenda had planned to be a bridesmaid on Sunday, not happening.

[20:47] I had all these marketing programs ready to go out, not happening.

[20:51] A lot of our lives will be disrupted by this.

[20:54] And so I think that's going to be the story of the near future.

[20:58] It's going to be the story of pinball as well as everything much more meaningful than pinball.

[21:04] And as Canadian pinball podcasts, I really just do appreciate that you guys tune in.

[21:08] I thank you all for your support on a weekly basis.

[21:12] And I really hope the Twippies go on because I've, if I think there's one thing that would

[21:17] be super exciting, it's that the Twippies pivot and take the live show online.

[21:24] And I told this to Carrie and I told this to Jeff, I think the Twippies should go on as

[21:29] planned as an online show that we all tune into and all support.

[21:33] You can get way more people to watch the Twippies online than you can in a room.

[21:38] A more, I would say only 200 to 300 people fit in the room at Texas pinball festival.

[21:44] I think we can get thousands of people to watch the Twippies live.

[21:48] And I think we can come together to do that.

[21:51] I also think we can fundraise during the online Twippies, fundraise for Ed and Kim, for

[21:57] Texas pinball festival.

[21:59] Everyone would happily donate to the cause.

[22:01] I mean, we raised $50,000 for Project Pinball.

[22:06] And I say, we, because it was the community, Ken did over at the flipping out stream that

[22:11] they did for 24 hours.

[22:13] And I think the same can happen again.

[22:15] And I think we should do the Twippies online.

[22:17] I think the host should have fun with it.

[22:19] I told Carrie the host should dress in hazmat costumes and really sort of lean into the

[22:26] reality of this is the year in which the coronavirus impacted all of us and make a little bit

[22:31] of a light of the situation because it's a pinball award show.

[22:35] You could probably even figure out a way to have all the people in the top three of each

[22:40] category be available on, there must be a way to do this either on Twitch or like a Google

[22:47] Hangout in which people could record their acceptance speech.

[22:52] This would be fun.

[22:53] If you record it, you're accepting speech and sent it to them and then you know, they

[22:57] could play it and they could air it.

[22:59] I don't know how you do that.

[23:00] I don't know if Twitch can do that like back in the world.

[23:01] Anyway, you know what I'm saying?

[23:02] But just cool.

[23:03] It's fine.

[23:05] You could just do it live and that would be fun.

[23:08] You could do it.

[23:09] Get everyone to give you an audio clip, maybe.

[23:11] I would love that too because you know, it's like when they make t-shirts for the World

[23:16] Series teams and they make World Series champions shirts that for both teams during a game seven

[23:21] and like some of those shirts go to the winning team.

[23:24] And then the losers still have championship shirts that they usually mail to Africa for

[23:28] people to wear.

[23:29] Can you imagine like if those audio clips got out?

[23:31] I would just love to hear what everyone's acceptance speeches would be.

[23:34] It would just be funny to play it.

[23:36] So I think they should do that.

[23:37] I think they should do that.

[23:38] I think some of the stuff can go on in just a different way.

[23:41] And I think we all should get behind it and we all should support stuff like that happening.

[23:46] So man, I mean, keep your spirits up.

[23:48] Keep you and your family healthy and do your best to stock up on the things you need.

[23:52] But don't panic.

[23:53] Don't go overboard.

[23:54] Don't buy 80,000 rolls of toilet paper.

[23:57] Not necessary.

[23:58] The analogy I was using is with a friend was and this is really where I think social media

[24:03] and the media landscape and it is detrimental to a lot of our lifestyles and people's fear

[24:11] and phobia.

[24:12] Because if you think about it, human beings are orchestrated for survival.

[24:15] Like it's in our instinct to panic, to get afraid, to act like this.

[24:20] Right?

[24:21] We want to live.

[24:22] So if something out there that is killing people is spreading, we are naturally quickly

[24:28] in a state of fear and phobia and anxiety.

[24:32] Social media and the modern news cycle, they harp on this.

[24:38] They love this.

[24:39] It makes them money.

[24:40] It makes them revenue.

[24:42] It gives them an audience which they sell to advertisers.

[24:45] Don't be fooled.

[24:46] It's making them money.

[24:47] The thing is, it's real.

[24:48] The threat is real.

[24:49] But imagine this, right?

[24:51] Someone dies every 17 seconds in America from an auto accident.

[24:56] Now imagine if the media and social media reported every single auto accident.

[25:02] That happened in the United States.

[25:04] Got spread on social media and national news for everyone to see simultaneously and

[25:11] instantaneously.

[25:13] Imagine that happened every 17 seconds.

[25:16] Now spread that to the world.

[25:17] If every auto accident happening around the world got into our feed somehow or there was

[25:21] like breaking news, like someone died, you would not go near a car ever.

[25:26] You would never even get in a car.

[25:28] You'd be like, oh my god, is this the car that's going to end my life?

[25:32] And if you look at the numbers with coronavirus and deaths, right?

[25:35] It starts, sometimes it feels silly like that.

[25:37] Like one person died in a country in the whole country shutting down.

[25:41] This is something that we know how to prevent it.

[25:44] This is something that is spreading.

[25:45] This is something that the world does need to get under control.

[25:48] But it's, there's just no way around it.

[25:50] This is the modern world.

[25:51] You know, this feels like the start of like the walking dead.

[25:53] Doesn't it?

[25:54] On some level?

[25:55] Like this is how it begins.

[25:56] Like you look at shows like the walking dead.

[25:57] There's a virus.

[25:58] It's spreading.

[25:59] And you have to avoid contact with people.

[26:01] They could kill you.

[26:02] I mean, it's very similar to the zombie apocalypse that some of my friends have been prepping

[26:08] for with their bunkers and their big guards on the front of their trucks and pretty soon.

[26:13] I don't know.

[26:14] Like look at people fighting over toilet paper at Walmart.

[26:17] It's kind of crazy.

[26:19] But we're not going to over blow this thing on Canadian pinball podcast.

[26:23] You know how I feel?

[26:24] I will not be traveling to shows.

[26:26] My Rick and Morty number 50 is on the line with the butter cabinet.

[26:31] If you join, join the Canadian party on Facebook.

[26:34] If you haven't yet.

[26:35] Canadian pinball podcast has a Facebook page.

[26:38] We are about like 930 people on there.

[26:41] It's a fun place to be if you haven't joined yet because not only do I share news exclusively

[26:47] on there, well not exclusively, but I can share it there first.

[26:51] I also love the back and forth and the banter we have in that community.

[26:55] I also put up a lot of funny photos that some people don't find funny.

[26:59] Like one of the ones I put up today was, am I the only one who can't think about the

[27:04] coronavirus after the hot wheels reveal?

[27:06] Am I the only one who's like so into that game?

[27:11] Poor American pinball.

[27:12] Like look, here's the thing.

[27:13] I'll just say this.

[27:14] They will sell more hot wheels than October fest.

[27:17] I'll just say that.

[27:19] Will they sell more than Houdini?

[27:21] I don't know.

[27:22] Will there be broader appeal for the game?

[27:24] Absolutely.

[27:25] I think that's the game that has the most appeal, but watching that video and watching

[27:29] the what's on the screen and the animations and what is there really to do in this game?

[27:35] And the animations are taken from hot wheels season one on YouTube.

[27:40] I posted a link on my Facebook page to where everything's just lifted.

[27:45] So they really didn't do much work in the animation department of this game.

[27:49] I don't know.

[27:50] People sometimes I see people on the pinside and I said, like this is the steps people take

[27:54] on pinside.

[27:55] Everyone sees the new game like hot wheels and you're like, looks fun.

[27:59] Looking at a pinball machine and saying it looks fun is like looking at a car and saying

[28:05] looks like it drives or looking at a movie, but looks like plays a movie like a projector

[28:10] looks like plays a movie.

[28:12] It looks fun.

[28:13] It's just like, yeah, duh.

[28:15] Like it's a toy.

[28:16] It's a pinball machine.

[28:17] It's supposed to be fun.

[28:18] And then the second thing people say are I can't wait to flip it.

[28:21] Looks fun.

[28:22] Can't wait to flip it.

[28:23] And then the third thing people say, congratulations, AP.

[28:27] You did a great job.

[28:28] And the fourth thing people are saying to themselves is, but not in a million years

[28:32] would I buy this thing.

[28:34] You're all like such a bunch of hypocrites.

[28:37] It's like, you just want to congratulate and pat a company on the back because they make

[28:42] something.

[28:43] And then in your head, you know you're not going to buy it.

[28:45] You won't share that with people that you won't buy it.

[28:48] Good job.

[28:49] You made it.

[28:50] You get an award.

[28:51] You get a medal.

[28:52] But not in a million years would I buy this thing.

[28:53] And the next thing you say is that canate is a jerk.

[28:56] He's a real a-hole.

[28:57] I can't believe he's not supporting every pinball company and what they make and bringing

[29:02] more pinball into the world and broadening pinball to the masses.

[29:05] How can canate a do that?

[29:06] He's such an a-hole.

[29:08] I don't like that guy.

[29:09] And then the next thing they do is they listen to every single episode of Canate is pinball

[29:13] podcast.

[29:14] Because who else are you going to, you know, like, where else are you going to go?

[29:17] To get weekly news about the hobby.

[29:21] My rumors have been right.

[29:22] I told you three months ago people it was going to be hot wheels.

[29:25] It was hot wheels.

[29:27] Do I get a medal for being right?

[29:28] I told you it was a reskin of poker runner.

[29:31] They were making poker around at the same time.

[29:32] And that's what it was.

[29:34] And they're admitting that.

[29:35] So like, and I know for a fact that these games are not ready to go out April first.

[29:41] And look, their new head of marketing, Michael Grant said games would ship April first,

[29:46] the first week of April.

[29:48] I will tell you right now, there is no way in a million years.

[29:52] Games are shipping the first week of April.

[29:54] I will also tell you that when he said that, he knew they weren't shipping the first week

[29:59] in April.

[30:00] And I'll tell you the other thing.

[30:01] The reason why he said that is because he was told to say that because the powers that

[30:06] be over to American pinball are misleading people.

[30:10] And they want to get people to order the game.

[30:13] And also, how can you give a company a pass in which distributors, think about this,

[30:18] distributors.

[30:19] I got an email from pinball star.

[30:20] I've been seeing Zach many post about the game.

[30:24] Distributors have to reach out to their customers to order this game without any official

[30:31] images, without any official price.

[30:35] How the hell does American pinball hope to sell games when they've screwed over all of

[30:41] their distributors right now?

[30:43] All of their distributors are pissed off.

[30:45] They're all pissed off because they don't know what to tell customers.

[30:49] And you know that you have a small window in which to line up sales for games.

[30:54] So why is it that on their third title, American pinball is still clueless on how to reveal

[31:00] a game and get their distributors enough information to help them sell these games.

[31:05] The sales come in through their distributor base.

[31:09] And it's so stupid that they're burning the very people that are there to help them.

[31:16] So if you want to say, Canadian's got a bone to pick with American pinball, I do.

[31:21] I don't have an agenda against American pinball.

[31:24] I think this company is piss poorly run.

[31:28] I think they're clueless.

[31:30] I think they're asleep at the wheel.

[31:32] I think it's the blind leading the blind.

[31:35] Are you telling me you think Joe Balser is happy right now?

[31:38] Do you think a guy that had the ability to make Wizard of Oz and put everything he

[31:44] could into Wizard of Oz?

[31:46] All the toys he put into the Hobbit, all the toys he put into Houdini, all the toys he

[31:51] put into October Fest.

[31:53] You think Joe Balser is a happy man right now having to stand over Hot Wheels?

[31:59] What?

[32:00] There's nothing in the game.

[32:02] And a Hot Wheels game that doesn't have a loop de loop.

[32:06] It doesn't have a jump.

[32:08] It doesn't have a car wash.

[32:10] It doesn't have a corkscrew ramp.

[32:12] It has nothing that makes Hot Wheels Hot Wheels.

[32:16] So I don't understand how all of you pin-side people saying great job.

[32:21] Looks fun to flip.

[32:22] What game are you looking at?

[32:25] Why should I, a man who critiques games, a man who's been hard on games like Willy

[32:30] Wonka and Pirates of the Caribbean for lack of assets?

[32:33] How are you, how do you expect me to react to this game?

[32:37] Is that the Hot Wheels world under glass?

[32:39] There's nothing in it.

[32:42] Yes, it's going to be simple.

[32:45] It's going to be easy.

[32:46] Yes, it's going to be for casual players who just see Hot Wheels and want to flip something.

[32:50] And I'm sure it's fun to shoot because it's a fan layout.

[32:53] And I'm sure it's fast and easy to understand.

[32:55] That's fine.

[32:56] But nobody, nobody who expects more from Pimball, which is me, which is you, which is the Pimball

[33:04] die-hard.

[33:05] What about this game?

[33:07] Appeals to you.

[33:08] And so then, the ultimate conclusion is this.

[33:10] This game wasn't made for us.

[33:12] Who wasn't made for Pimball fanatics?

[33:14] This game was made for more casual players who will gravitate towards the theme.

[33:20] And that's totally fine.

[33:21] This is like the flying Dutchman of Pimball.

[33:24] This is just something that is simple, won't break, can go on location.

[33:28] I mean, you've got a spinning car that goes around and around and around and around and around

[33:32] and around.

[33:33] And it just keeps spinning.

[33:36] The ball doesn't interact with it.

[33:38] And when the ball goes up and over and that vertical upkick, it's not even exciting.

[33:42] Whatever.

[33:43] All you guys out there who are just like defending and apologizing and saying,

[33:47] can you just negative, is there any game like people say this?

[33:50] They said, is there any game you like?

[33:52] I hear this all the time in Facebook.

[33:53] You don't like anything.

[33:54] And that's total hogwash.

[33:56] I love plenty of Pimball machines.

[33:58] My favorite Pimball machine of all time is still and I regret selling it.

[34:03] And if I could get another one, the way mine was, I'd buy it tomorrow is Lord of the Rings.

[34:09] I love Lord of the Rings, Pimball.

[34:11] And that was my first game.

[34:12] You have to understand something.

[34:13] I got into this hobby and my first game was Lord of the Rings, Pimball by Stern Pimball

[34:18] in Ellie with all these exciting mods.

[34:21] Now imagine if that's your first game.

[34:23] It's the same way when people's first games are pired to the Caribbean from Jersey Jack.

[34:27] You can't go back.

[34:29] You can't unfeel the way you felt with that game.

[34:33] That game to me, Lord of the Rings.

[34:35] The finest of you clunky shots is as close to perfect as it will ever get with music,

[34:41] with mechanisms, with shots, with the feeling of being pulled into the middle earth world,

[34:47] with light, everything about it has the best callouts in Pimball ever.

[34:51] Has some of the best modes ever.

[34:53] Does the best thing I've seen a machine ever do when you beat, when you throw the ring

[34:57] into the fires of mortar when the whole machine goes haywire?

[35:01] When's the last time?

[35:02] This game people is 16 freaking years old.

[35:06] When was the last time you've seen a game do something as cool as that when you complete

[35:11] the final mode after the three wizard modes?

[35:14] When's the last time you've seen a game go all haywire like that?

[35:17] That is my point.

[35:18] I grew up in this hobby with magic.

[35:22] I loved toad in.

[35:24] I loved tales of the Ruby Knights.

[35:26] Two shallow of code.

[35:27] I learned that.

[35:28] It's still one of the most beautiful machines.

[35:30] It's still one of the most fun mechanisms ever.

[35:33] But it's too shallow.

[35:34] You can't own a tales of the Ruby Knights for very long.

[35:37] You can't.

[35:38] It just gets boring.

[35:39] Okay.

[35:40] My magic girl didn't work.

[35:41] I love Batman 66.

[35:43] I have nothing bad to say about Batman 66 other than this.

[35:47] It's not my die hard theme.

[35:49] It's a little like a game or a show I watch when I was a kid.

[35:53] But the shots are sort of boring in Batman.

[35:55] The most exciting thing in Batman is the code by far.

[35:58] The code is phenomenal.

[35:59] It is again one of the best theme integrations ever in Pimball.

[36:02] But once you see everything, once you go through all the wizard modes, once you do the

[36:08] Batuzi, once you do everything and then you get to villain escape, I've seen the whole

[36:13] game.

[36:14] I played the whole game many times.

[36:15] I've seen everything multiple times.

[36:18] There's just certain things that once you see it enough times, you get bored a little

[36:21] bit.

[36:22] There's no impressive light show.

[36:24] The crane is still the crane.

[36:26] The shots are clunky.

[36:27] They are in Batman.

[36:28] There's no way around it.

[36:29] The ball never does anything magical.

[36:31] But I love the code.

[36:33] But the most exciting thing about Batman is the code.

[36:35] And once you see the code enough, the physical shooting of the game is not that rewarding.

[36:41] It's just not.

[36:42] But I still love the game.

[36:44] And if I were to summarize why Canadian is usually cranky on the hobby, it's very simply

[36:48] this.

[36:49] I want every game that is a theme I love to be as good as Lord of the Rings.

[36:55] I want every game that's a theme I love to be as great as the big Lebowski is.

[37:01] It has all the assets, all the video, all the mechanisms that bring that world to life.

[37:06] Those are my standards of pinball.

[37:08] Because why would I spend, and you know me, I'm an Ellie and plus kind of guy, why would

[37:12] I spend $9,000 plus on anything that falls short of that?

[37:18] That's a lot of money.

[37:19] Shouldn't it all be in there?

[37:21] I can buy a $60 video game that has everything I want from a theme.

[37:25] I'm going to spend $9,000 on a pinball machine that doesn't have voice and video synced

[37:32] up.

[37:33] No.

[37:34] I'm going to spend $24,000 someone's trying to sell a pirate to the Caribbean collectors

[37:38] edition inbox.

[37:39] I'm going to spend $24,000 on a pirate to the Caribbean game that doesn't have the

[37:43] pirate to the Caribbean theme song.

[37:45] No.

[37:46] I just want what should be in the game.

[37:49] What used to be in these games?

[37:51] The Rings has everything you want in the game.

[37:54] It used to cost $3,500 bucks, $4,000.

[37:58] Now you're spending two, three times that and getting two, three times less assets and

[38:04] integration into these games.

[38:06] You're wondering why I'm like, I don't know.

[38:08] I don't live in a vacuum.

[38:09] I know these things.

[38:12] I want a new game.

[38:13] I don't want to look back.

[38:15] Sure, I love playing Attack from Mars and Medieval Madness and Monster Bash.

[38:19] I love playing those games.

[38:21] I just want to own something that's a theme I love.

[38:24] I'm a theme driven world under glass kind of guy.

[38:27] Again, if you're up to me, if you're up to me the game and all the themes I love, all

[38:31] the themes that I gravitate towards, they've had the worst luck.

[38:35] Ghostbusters.

[38:36] We all should own a ghostbusters.

[38:38] We all should have it.

[38:39] It is Stern's best world under glass ever and they f'd it up and they even know they

[38:44] won't even admit it when they were doing the final CAD design.

[38:48] They mistakenly moved the flipper gap bigger than it should have been.

[38:52] It never should have been that big.

[38:54] I would love it if Stern would fix that problem and do another run of ghostbusters and actually

[38:59] make the game enjoyable.

[39:01] That game sucks.

[39:03] It's like holding on for dear life when you play that game and everyone knows it.

[39:07] Everybody knows it.

[39:08] Star Wars.

[39:09] I'm the biggest Star Wars fan.

[39:10] Why don't I own a Star Wars?

[39:12] Look at that game.

[39:14] Look at that game.

[39:15] It's a mess.

[39:16] It's a total mess.

[39:18] A tie fighter on a spring, a lazy screen and a death star shot that's almost next to

[39:24] impossible to hit that's clunky and a stupid hyperloop that's the main, like where is Star

[39:29] Wars?

[39:31] Where are the Ewoks?

[39:32] Where's the lightsaber battle?

[39:33] Where's the AT-AT Walker?

[39:35] Where's the land speeder?

[39:37] Where's the Millennium Falcon moving?

[39:38] Where's any, there's nothing.

[39:40] There's nothing about Star Wars that I love in that game.

[39:42] I love Game of Thrones.

[39:44] Look at that game.

[39:45] Nothing.

[39:46] Nothing.

[39:47] One of the lamest upper plate fields ever.

[39:48] So I'm just a complaining kind of guy.

[39:51] And look, I'll say it like this.

[39:53] Everything's code.

[39:54] Everything's code.

[39:55] Everything's code.

[39:56] Code will save the day.

[39:57] Code will save the day on stranger things.

[39:59] Code will say, no, I'm tired of pinball machines today.

[40:02] I'm tired of the approach of pinball machines always being the same approach.

[40:07] Let's just make the code where the theme comes to life on the screen.

[40:11] Let's not put the physical world under the glass.

[40:15] Let's sit today people.

[40:16] Look at stranger things.

[40:18] Where's the world of stranger things?

[40:20] Where's the arcade?

[40:21] Where's everything that we love about that game?

[40:23] Where's the BMX bikes?

[40:24] Where's the walkie talkies?

[40:27] Where's the physical 80s world that we love?

[40:29] Is it anywhere in that game?

[40:31] Where's the basement scenes?

[40:34] There's nothing.

[40:35] There's nothing.

[40:36] Back in the day, if they wanted to make a stranger things game, they would have really

[40:40] thought about it so much better.

[40:42] There would have been a little arcade you can go into.

[40:44] And then have a video mode in what you're playing like Pac-Man.

[40:47] They would have had a van in what you pops up and you shoot over it or something.

[40:51] They would have had stuff.

[40:52] They would have had her user telekinesis powers and actually move the ball like Dracula does.

[40:58] But nothing.

[40:59] How do you not have 11 freezing the balls and then using them and swirling around?

[41:03] Like, I mean, Stern did it with like Magneto multi-ball?

[41:06] We know they know how to make those kind of magical moments happen.

[41:09] Grab the ball and mid-air like Lord of the Rings ring shot.

[41:13] That's the magical shot in Stranger Things.

[41:15] You shoot up this big ramp and hit a plastic already choke and that's it.

[41:19] It doesn't make you feel anything.

[41:21] You don't feel this incredible satisfaction when it goes inside that hole.

[41:25] So that's what I'm saying.

[41:27] That's why all of you out there who feel like me, I'm always just waiting for the next

[41:33] Lord of the Rings.

[41:34] I'm waiting for the next world under glass like Big Lebowski.

[41:37] I'm waiting for a game that brings it all together.

[41:40] The closest company to get there is Jersey Jack by far.

[41:43] But then they go and screw up the Wonka assets.

[41:46] If Wonka had the right assets and was coated the right way, believe me, I'd own one in

[41:51] a heartbeat and I know a lot of you feel the same way as me and some of you don't and

[41:54] that's cool you might enjoy it the way it is.

[41:57] It just doesn't bring the movie that I love to life.

[41:59] It's a musical where the music, where the songs, not in there.

[42:02] How do you not have a good or bad egg detector?

[42:05] How do you not have, how do you not make that a mech?

[42:07] How do you, anyway, you know what I'm saying?

[42:09] I'm just waiting.

[42:10] I hope for Toy Story.

[42:12] I can't wait to see Guns and Roses and I just, I can't wait to see what Deeproot brings

[42:17] to the table.

[42:18] But really there's just, there hasn't been that game.

[42:21] There hasn't been that game that's grabbed me and I know you know that Rick and Morty

[42:25] is coming and I'm going to give Rick and Morty a shot.

[42:29] I'm going to play it.

[42:30] I'm going to see how I feel.

[42:31] I know the theme integration is there but I'll say this.

[42:34] I'm nervous.

[42:36] I'm reading people's reviews of Rick and Morty.

[42:38] I loved, I loved, loved, loved.

[42:41] I think this guy gave the best analysis the game ever and he's, someone who's not a

[42:44] fan of mine and I don't know why.

[42:46] I don't know why.

[42:47] He probably listens to every show.

[42:49] His name is Flinny Bus on Pinside.

[42:52] Go read his review and his feedback on Rick and Morty.

[42:56] I think it is the most balanced and fair and in depth review of Rick and Morty and I

[43:03] did walk away from his review feeling skeptical, feeling nervous because it feels like a game

[43:11] and I haven't played it yet and I'm going to try and maybe go play it this weekend with

[43:14] a bunch of hand sanitizer.

[43:16] It feels like a game that really, really wins in some areas and really, really fails

[43:21] in others and the area that it really, really wins in is theme integration, light show,

[43:27] music and the art is supposed to be nice.

[43:30] And the overall like bringing the Rick and Morty world to life there, the area that has

[43:34] everyone the most concerned and again there's a lot of polarizing debate around this is

[43:40] the shots and that upper right flipper and the way it shoots has people divided.

[43:47] Like he says it's frustrating and he thinks casual players like me, people are not amazing

[43:52] at pinball are going to quickly get frustrated and not want to have this machine.

[43:57] Now there's other people that say it makes you play better and once you play better

[44:01] and learn the shots, it's really rewarding like John over at Jack bars had the game for

[44:06] a while and he said to me, look it's not that the shots can't be made.

[44:11] It's that you have to learn how to shoot this game differently than a lot of other games

[44:15] that have upper play fields that are a lot smoother and easier to hit right you get

[44:19] you get on a pat lauler machine and the shots are buttery smooth they're easy to hit

[44:23] every time.

[44:24] I just wish they wouldn't have had so many cheap drains in wonka but it's still it's

[44:29] a beautifully smooth experience.

[44:31] It doesn't sound like Rick and Morty is as easy as easy to sort of get your reflexes

[44:37] in tune with how the game needs to be flipped to make it smoother.

[44:40] Doesn't mean it's going to be bad or not fun but again fun is just such I just get annoyed

[44:46] I remember when Zack Sharp over at Stern, he sent me that email and said if the game is

[44:50] fun then the price of the game is irrelevant.

[44:53] I'll never forget him saying that if the game is fun then the price is irrelevant stupid.

[45:00] Every pinball machine is fun.

[45:01] We all would have fun on almost any machine.

[45:03] On almost any machine unless it was called for throttle.

[45:07] You know so that's just the way it is.

[45:09] That's just the way it is.

[45:11] So maybe you listen to me because you want to see me.

[45:14] I think most of you out there when you saw how excited I was with Willy Wonka I think

[45:19] many of you are on the same journey with me.

[45:21] You just want to see Canada find excitement and be fulfilled at the end of that journey

[45:28] to find the most magical pinball machine out there.

[45:31] Now the other thing I'll just tease right now is I haven't flipped it but that mystery

[45:36] game that I've been talking about that I haven't mentioned in a really long time.

[45:41] That's really the game that has me the most excited about everything I'm seeing in

[45:45] pinball and the guy creating it is purposely keeping a lot of it from me but from what

[45:51] I've seen it makes me more excited than all of these games combined and it's just and

[45:56] that's just the way and it sucks because I know there's this thing and I don't know if

[46:00] it's going to happen for sure and I don't know when but what I see is like blowing me

[46:06] away to the point where I'm like it's there like the passion and the ability to make the

[46:12] magic that we all love in pinball is so there and I just think people are accepting

[46:18] a lot of mediocrity and there's also just a lot of crap and there's some good games

[46:24] in between a few great games but nothing nothing is quite there on the level for me of like

[46:31] a Lord of the Rings as a big Lebowski magic under the glass theme integration that doesn't

[46:39] leave us wanting more shots that are super rewarding code that keeps us coming back for

[46:46] more for years you know it's coming next this is just weird to me there is going to be

[46:50] a humongous a humongous pirate to the Caribbean code dump coming soon in which they're going

[46:57] to put so many more clips into it and they're going to like do this and that and again

[47:01] that's already deep a right again that's already phenomenal for owners and so why is Jersey

[47:06] Jack pinball gonna make in a humongous improvement to a game that they can't even sell you a game

[47:13] that only a thousand people have why aren't they doing everything they can to get more

[47:19] of the assets for Willy Wonka why would you make waste time money and resources on a game

[47:25] that's done unless you're going to rerun pirates of the Caribbean what are they doing why

[47:30] isn't Jack in company why aren't they looking at Willy Wonka and said okay we've got this

[47:35] amazing pat law their design we've got this incredible layout we've got this game that everyone

[47:40] loves to shoot what is the one thing holding back maybe another thousand or two thousand people

[47:46] from buying it well well the feedback we've heard is people would like there to be synchronized

[47:52] clips they would also like us to think about maybe making a little bit more mode base so why not

[47:58] revisit it it's just software a few software changes to Willy Wonka I think could drastically

[48:06] drastically get a whole new bunch of buyers instead they're focusing on pirates a game that doesn't

[48:12] need anymore that will obviously get more and great you made a great game even greater but what's

[48:18] the point no one can go get it and right now the prices are astronomical and unless you're going

[48:24] to do another run why bother so wow this this turned into like a corona podcast coronavirus and

[48:30] then a regular version of Canadian pinball podcast look ladies and gentlemen let's just get let's

[48:36] just close this show out and saying we feel really bad for all the people to disrupt it who worked

[49:32] maybe I don't know I don't know we'll see all right let's close out this show with something that I

[49:39] was thinking about doing so in in in in preparation for new guns and roses pinball machine what what is

[49:44] the one thing that made that data east machine so special there was an unreleased guns and roses

[49:49] song in it so let me do this I I asked people on Facebook should I release unreleased guns and

[49:56] roses tracks to the world that you guys can download and and thank canada for them and they're

[50:02] interesting these are songs that Axe Rose worked on between nineteen ninety nine and two thousand one

[50:07] let me I've used them in some of my interest let me play a little bit of a longer outro to

[50:12] canadus pinball podcasts with a clip from an unreleased guns and roses song that most of you have

[50:19] probably never heard this one let's see let's see my head this one is called hard school get ready enjoy
