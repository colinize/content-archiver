[00:00] Who are you?

[00:01] Oh, sorry.

[00:02] Barney Mushnik is the name, owner of the Big Bang Fireworks Company.

[00:07] I could use a firecracker like you and my line of work.

[00:10] Work?

[00:11] Huh, for some reason that word fills me with disgust.

[00:15] Well, we managed to do it again.

[00:21] I think it's like, Kaneda 4 and Zach Sharp 0 on Spoiling Stern Pimball's new product

[00:29] launches.

[00:30] Now, it wasn't even me.

[00:31] I mean, someone started to leak images and once that happened, the floodgates opened

[00:37] and people started sending me stuff.

[00:39] And that's how it went down.

[00:42] And they also obviously did their distributor presentation and people screen grabbed that.

[00:48] I don't understand why for the life of me, Stern can't understand a very simple marketing

[00:55] principle.

[00:56] All they have to do is go live with all of their intended media and all of their assets

[01:03] and HD images and videos.

[01:05] They just need to send that out to the world.

[01:08] At the exact same time, they do the distributor seminars.

[01:13] It makes no sense that you do this distributor conference called the day before your media

[01:18] is set to go live.

[01:19] Stern, it makes no sense.

[01:22] You could easily, easily, easily have your distributors ready to take orders simultaneously

[01:29] as your IGN story goes live and as your other stuff hits.

[01:33] But they always do it to themselves.

[01:36] They just spoil the party a little bit, but it's a pizza party and it's going to happen.

[01:40] So on this episode, let's just give you my first impressions of this game based on what

[01:47] we know so far.

[01:48] Okay.

[01:49] Now, everything I said was going to be in this game and my previous podcast is in this

[01:55] game.

[01:56] It has the target banks.

[01:57] It has the pizza magnet that spins the ball around like Magneto.

[02:02] It has the Raphael Glider.

[02:04] It has the ninja van that locks four balls apparently.

[02:09] What else did I say?

[02:10] It has the crank toy that pops up and down near the pop bumper area.

[02:14] It has, do-do-do.

[02:16] It has the artwork I talked about on the LE.

[02:19] So what do I think about this game?

[02:21] Seeing it in non HD glory.

[02:23] Well, I feel like that was the first thing that jumped out at me.

[02:27] I mean, the first images we got were some of the worst colored images for a zombie-eddy

[02:34] art package.

[02:35] So it was unfortunate that the first things people were digesting were horrible, horrible,

[02:41] horrible images to judge this game on.

[02:44] I mean, it looked so like washed out and white it out.

[02:48] It just did not pop.

[02:50] Now luckily, we got some images later in the day that had a lot more vibrancy and popped.

[02:56] I mean, this game, when we see it today in full HD glory, is going to pop and be very

[03:05] colorful and jump out at us.

[03:07] There is no doubt about that.

[03:09] But what we can look at right now is the detail and the way in which zombie-eddy drew

[03:15] this game.

[03:16] Let's just start there.

[03:17] I think for a lot of people out there, nobody, nobody.

[03:21] And I mean nobody doesn't appreciate and respect the talents of zombie-eddy.

[03:27] I will say this.

[03:30] This art package is paying homage to the 1980s style of Ninja Turtles.

[03:36] And when I saw the play field art, it doesn't pop the way some of the other areas of the

[03:45] game pop and the translate areas and on the cabinet.

[03:49] And I think he kind of mixed different styles.

[03:53] I think he wanted to do some things that were reflective of the 80s cartoon that people

[03:58] remember.

[03:59] And then some of the other areas he went full zombie-eddy.

[04:03] And obviously his skill set and his ability to add detail is far greater than the simplicity

[04:10] of the 1980s comic.

[04:13] And I think that's a little jarring for people.

[04:17] When you mix art styles in a single package, it doesn't always feel cohesive and it doesn't

[04:24] always click.

[04:26] And I think a lot of people are noticing that because if you were to ask me in the world

[04:31] of zombie-eddy artwork, the ghost busters and Deadpool packages are still in our minds

[04:39] as being the greatest play field art packages Stern has ever done.

[04:45] Along with Mr. Franchise Munsters.

[04:48] And so I feel like this didn't wow us like we thought.

[04:54] And I think there was a lot of overhyped that this was going to be zombie-eddy's greatest

[05:00] art package to date.

[05:01] And he loved Ninja Turtles so much that he went overboard.

[05:05] I think he loves it.

[05:07] But I think he respected the style of the show and didn't go overboard the way he can

[05:14] throughout the entire game.

[05:16] I think we see it in areas of the translate and I think we see it in areas of the cabinet

[05:21] art.

[05:22] But the play field itself feels a little kitty because it is kitty.

[05:27] It is an 80s cartoon style.

[05:30] So I think some people are noticing that and we're going to see today in its full HD

[05:36] glory.

[05:37] And that's why I say this stuff with the grain of salt because we haven't seen it the way

[05:41] the artist intended it to be seen just yet.

[05:45] Now I will say that something that's been going on with a lot of games lately that I just

[05:50] don't think is the right way to do it.

[05:52] And I know there's three artistic packages from Stern.

[05:56] I just don't like when you leave the logo off of the side of the cabinet on a trim of

[06:02] a game.

[06:03] I just it just feels empty in some way.

[06:07] And I always think a pinball machine should have the logo on the side of the game.

[06:13] I don't like it in Rick and Morty.

[06:15] I don't like it in Rob Zombie.

[06:17] I don't like it in Ninja Turtles.

[06:20] I don't like it.

[06:22] Even in Ghostbusters they manage to put the Ghostbusters logo.

[06:25] I just think even though the visual obviously connotes what the theme is, I just think it looks

[06:33] more cohesive and just looks more like a pinball game when you have the logo on the side.

[06:40] So that's just something that is something that I would like to see.

[06:44] It's obviously 100% subjective.

[06:46] But I wish these companies would stop with letting the artist have 100% of the real estate.

[06:52] I think you need that logo of the game from the side.

[06:56] It just is something about a logo with pinball machines that makes sense.

[07:00] Okay.

[07:01] We're going to pick a little bit because this is what we do.

[07:04] What else we want to talk about with the game?

[07:05] So obviously the game from a...

[07:08] So let me talk about things I was just drawn to when I saw the game for the first time.

[07:13] And I'm going to be completely transparent with my thoughts.

[07:17] And there's just...

[07:17] I say this and I'll say it again.

[07:19] There's just something about when I see a stern pinball machine for the first time.

[07:25] It always sort of moves me in the same way.

[07:28] And I kind of look at it and there's like stuff that's neat.

[07:32] There's stuff that's colorful.

[07:34] But then when you really look in on the details of their games and the mechs and the toys

[07:39] in a stern machine in 2020, I can't help but feel.

[07:44] It does feel a little cheap.

[07:47] The Raphael Glider, the Ninja Turtle van for example.

[07:52] I mean, I was just expecting there to be a little bit of a bigger van more detailed.

[07:57] I thought the way the door would open up would be a little bit more dramatic.

[08:02] There's just some...

[08:03] It just feels like that van is squished like it was put in a vice.

[08:07] I don't know.

[08:08] It's the Ninja Turtle van that squashed.

[08:09] It looks like that thing ran into a wall and it just feels like a really, really cheap

[08:15] Ninja Turtle toy.

[08:17] Same with the Raphael Glider.

[08:18] There's no detail on it.

[08:20] None whatsoever.

[08:21] It feels like if I saw that toy in a store, it would be five bucks.

[08:27] And there's no real artistic sculpting going on with any of this stuff.

[08:32] And I have to say, I just expect more in this department.

[08:37] It just feels cheap.

[08:40] It feels like a child's Fisher Price toy when I looked down at a $9,000 stern alley.

[08:47] And I'm starting to get this sense that this is just the best we're ever going to get

[08:52] from stern.

[08:54] That they just have hit a limit on what they will be able to give us for a $3,000 bomb

[09:01] game.

[09:03] And I say that because I've seen some other stuff coming out from some other manufacturers

[09:08] that have clearly a higher bomb than stern.

[09:12] I just don't feel like stern has anything left to give designers and sculptors and artists

[09:20] in ability to make the world under glass in a stern machine pop more than this.

[09:26] I feel like we've hit this limit.

[09:29] The Jurassic Park T-Rex was a moment of like, oh my god, imagine what they could do.

[09:36] And then we're back here.

[09:37] And I just feel like this to me feels very like unimaginative in a way.

[09:42] And I know what you're going to say.

[09:44] It's Ninja Turtles Chris.

[09:45] Like what did you expect?

[09:46] I don't know, maybe do something with like some, it couldn't you have made like Nunchucks

[09:52] as part of the ramps or put the four iconic Ninja Turtle weapons into this game somehow.

[09:58] Like, couldn't you have made the shooter lane, the staff and couldn't you have made the

[10:03] katanas, like the ball rails instead of just like normal rails.

[10:09] Couldn't you have made Nunchucks into the ramps going up?

[10:12] Couldn't you have made the blade?

[10:15] You know, the katana into something.

[10:17] So I, you know, look, look, I know I'm nitpicking here, but they're, you know what I'm saying?

[10:22] There's just nothing that really pops out.

[10:25] Like the pizza's been done before, the pizza was in the old Ninja Turtle game.

[10:29] And the other thing I just, I was like, well, why, where's the color in the rails?

[10:36] Right?

[10:37] So you have the ramps, I get the ramps are plastic, but then you've got the rails that

[10:42] are just silver.

[10:44] Like really stern couldn't, they couldn't make these rails bright green to pop.

[10:50] I mean, even the original Ninja Turtle game back in the day, the old game had a bright,

[10:57] bright green rail and a bright, bright yellow rail.

[11:01] And it just popped.

[11:02] And I just, I don't know, there's something about these things when I see them.

[11:06] And I'm like, Stern doesn't want to spend the extra, what is it?

[11:09] 15 bucks per game making this thing pop.

[11:13] And at least put it on the Ellie for $9,000.

[11:16] It's just at the point where you're not really getting anything more other than art and

[11:23] some armor, which is like not really expensive.

[11:27] Okay.

[11:28] So I do think it's colorful.

[11:29] I mean, I can't wait to shoot it.

[11:31] Everyone says that I can't wait to shoot it.

[11:33] I hate that.

[11:34] I got to be honest.

[11:35] I do hate that because of course you can't wait to shoot it.

[11:37] It's like, of course I can't wait to drive this car.

[11:40] Of course, I can't wait to taste this bottle of wine.

[11:43] Of course we know you can't wait to shoot it.

[11:46] I think if you're not a fan of Ninja Turtles, like nothing you see here is really going

[11:51] to change your mind.

[11:52] Like you're not seeing something you've never seen before in Pimble.

[11:56] And this is going to make you want to go in on it.

[11:58] I think this game is a little bit, and I'm just going to say this, it was hyped.

[12:05] We did hear a lot.

[12:07] We did site.

[12:08] We did it even hype it on this show.

[12:10] I was expecting there to be more movement of the ball underneath the playfield and above

[12:18] the playfield.

[12:19] I thought there was going to be more of like underground sewer systems.

[12:23] I thought there was going to be going down into the Ninja Turtle layer.

[12:28] There's none of that.

[12:29] And I get it.

[12:30] They're going to do it all on the screen.

[12:31] But I just thought they were going to do something a little bit more dramatic with the

[12:38] way the ball travels through this game.

[12:41] Now we haven't seen it shoot yet.

[12:43] We're going to see that today.

[12:44] But I have to say, even like Ghostbusters, when it had that really steep ramp and then

[12:49] you had the ball going underneath the playfield into this, and coming down like a rollercoaster

[12:54] and kicking up like the subway, there's just when I look at Ghostbusters next to Ninja

[12:59] Turtles, I still feel like Ghostbusters was trying new things and really had more of

[13:07] a wow and some wow features in the game.

[13:11] And when I look at this, I don't think the Raphael Glider is like a wow thing.

[13:16] I don't think the crank toy is a wow thing.

[13:19] And the van is like, looks so cheap to me the way the, it just looks cheap.

[13:24] I can't, I'm sorry, like it just does.

[13:27] So you know, it just doesn't, I don't know, there just, it just seems like if you put

[13:31] the monsters next to this, it seems very similar.

[13:36] We do have, we do have the upper left flipper, which is cool, which does shoot into a ramp,

[13:43] which you can see there's, there's like two ramps.

[13:45] I think there's like three ramps in this game.

[13:47] So there's, yeah, there's like a left ramp, there's the right ramp that the upper left

[13:52] flipper feeds and then there's the other upper right ramp.

[13:56] So yeah, I mean, it looks like a fun shooter.

[13:59] It looks like there's a lot of different ways for the ball to go.

[14:03] It's colorful, it's vibrant, it's Ninja Turtles.

[14:05] Now we are going to see today what is on the screen and how the code is of the game.

[14:11] Now, personally, I thought this game would like, the weakest link I thought would be Dwight.

[14:18] And I thought this thing would knock people's socks off so much and people would be nervous

[14:22] about the code.

[14:23] I will say coming out of yesterday, I do think people are not nearly as blown away as

[14:29] some people expected this game to deliver.

[14:32] Again, we have to wait to see the final thing today.

[14:36] These are obviously little nitpick things, but here's what we do know is not going to be

[14:40] in this game.

[14:41] They are not going to have, I hear, the original voice actors for this game.

[14:45] And the reason why I played that clip at the beginning of this show is if you're going

[14:48] to make a game that's a throwback to the 1980s cartoon and you don't use the original

[14:53] voice actors, then the people who love the original 80s cartoon are going to have a

[14:57] series issue with that.

[14:59] Now if you don't know who those actors are, you don't care.

[15:02] Fine, that's cool.

[15:03] You can go buy a game and have fake voices and have stern employees do the voices.

[15:07] But that's what I heard stern employees are going to fill in some of the voices.

[15:10] Can't wait to hear Tim Sexton as shredder.

[15:12] No, I don't know who's doing what.

[15:13] Okay, but the thing is probably going to be Steve Richie and we know that he does a

[15:17] lot of voices.

[15:18] He did voice work with Black Knight.

[15:19] But here is the thing.

[15:21] If you love Transformers, Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is just, those things have to go

[15:27] together.

[15:28] You can't have Optimus Prime and not be voiced by Optimus Prime.

[15:32] Now I would argue, and I would argue even though my friend Mr. Rare here at Greg Colton

[15:37] is like obsessed with the original voices, that most people, most grown adults haven't

[15:43] grown up with a fondness, nor did they even remember really what those voices sound like

[15:48] I have to be honest when I played this clip from the original cartoon, I didn't realize

[15:52] shredder sounded that way.

[15:54] So if you were to replace that with a new voice actor, shredder, I don't think the majority

[15:59] of people would know nor would they care that much.

[16:02] But that is, it's something for the diehards to consider because this is a theme that

[16:07] mostly speaks to diehards.

[16:09] Okay, now, and something else that I noticed that's just a little weird and I hope it doesn't

[16:13] come out like this.

[16:15] The armor, the bright green on the LE, the armor and the piping on the back box, the

[16:23] back box piping does not match the green that's on the armor.

[16:28] So I really hope that's not the case because it's little details like that that always

[16:32] bug me about Stern.

[16:34] It's like, are you really going to make a green game in which the greens don't match up?

[16:39] So I will have to wait and see the final thing, but from what I'm seeing right now, the

[16:44] piping on the back box is a lighter shade of green than the armor.

[16:51] And I really hope, I really hope that's just a prototype thing and that's not how the

[16:55] game finally looks.

[16:56] Okay, now, we're going to find out today the most important parts of this game.

[17:00] How does it shoot?

[17:01] What is the code?

[17:03] Is it fun?

[17:04] It's going to be fun.

[17:05] It's no doubt about it.

[17:06] It's going to be fun.

[17:07] And I think for those of you out there who think this is a theme disaster, I think you're

[17:11] wrong.

[17:12] I think there's a lot of appeal for Ninja Turtles.

[17:15] I think it's a polarizing game in some ways because you easily get to people's age groups

[17:19] that don't care at all.

[17:21] And so that's fine because think about it like this.

[17:25] Stern gave you monsters and Batman 66 for you old farts out there.

[17:30] Stern's giving Ninja Turtles for people that are maybe like 35 to 45, okay?

[17:34] Stern's going to give you Led Zeppelin, which doesn't appeal to a lot of age groups.

[17:39] Stern's going to give you Godzilla, which it has more universal appeal.

[17:43] Stern gave you Stranger Things, which has a younger fan base.

[17:47] Stern gave you Guardians of the Galaxy, Game of Thrones, Star Wars.

[17:50] You see what I'm saying is like within the Stern portfolio, Ninja Turtles makes total

[17:56] sense.

[17:57] For me, Ninja Turtles coming out now and coming out in pro format and being ready to

[18:02] ship two days.

[18:03] There's one game that I think this game just nukes because if you're a buyer, this is

[18:07] a kid friendly theme.

[18:09] It's an iconic kid's property.

[18:11] I would hate to be American Pimball right now.

[18:14] You've delayed Hot Wheels and now you've got to go up against Ninja Turtles because

[18:18] I think to me that is the other game that's trying to be the family friendly, younger

[18:24] theme game that goes out in the world.

[18:27] Now if you're a parent and you're buying a game, you now have Ninja Turtles available

[18:33] and also Ninja Turtles is going to ship before Hot Wheels.

[18:37] What is happening to American Pimball?

[18:39] What are they waiting for right now?

[18:41] These companies that were already to go before COVID, I said it, the company that comes out

[18:46] first is really going to reap the rewards of all this pent up cash and all this boredom

[18:52] and Stern's going to be the company that sees the money come through the door.

[18:56] Now is Ninja Turtles going to sell out today and do I think from what we've seen, this

[19:01] is going to be a take my money now.

[19:03] All 500 LEDs go quickly on Ninja Turtles and the answer is no.

[19:09] I don't think this game is going to fly off the shelves.

[19:12] I don't think they're going to sell out of the LEDs in one day.

[19:16] This just doesn't have that.

[19:18] I mean Ghostbusters sold out before they even revealed it.

[19:22] Batman sold out before they even really revealed it.

[19:25] It just doesn't have that kind of pull.

[19:29] I fully expect Ninja Turtles to be a lot like Deadpool, a lot like Guardians.

[19:34] I think you're going to see LEDs available for a while.

[19:38] I think people are going to wait.

[19:39] The problem for a lot of people out there is there's no shows coming up.

[19:44] The whole notion that I'm going to wait to play it at Allentown or wait to play it at

[19:49] Pimberg or wait to play it at this show or that show, a lot more difficult to take that

[19:55] approach.

[19:56] This is the first game release during a pandemic by Stern Pimble.

[20:01] I definitely think it's negatively going to impact the sales of the game.

[20:06] No doubt about it.

[20:07] Now I'm just going to tell you something that's a little mysterious, a little vague.

[20:13] I will go into more detail about this.

[20:15] I will go into more detail about what I know.

[20:18] If you're not the biggest diehard Ninja Turtles fan and you really don't need to own this

[20:24] game but you just want something new, I'm here to tell you right now.

[20:28] You should hold on to your money.

[20:30] There is something coming that's just so much better than what you see in this package.

[20:36] It's more for adults and it's just on an engineering level.

[20:41] It's comical to me.

[20:42] It's getting to the point where some of the stuff I'm seeing just feels like it should

[20:46] be $20,000.

[20:47] It feels like it should be worth two to three times what we're getting in these Stern games.

[20:53] Again, I give Stern credit because what they do is what nobody else does.

[20:57] They get it done.

[20:58] They get these games done and they get them out the door so they can charge whatever they

[21:02] want.

[21:03] Again, they're the only drug dealer in town.

[21:06] When you're the only drug dealer on the corner all the time, you can control the price

[21:10] of the market.

[21:11] That's what Stern can do.

[21:13] Jersey Jack, these other companies, Chicago gaming, they showed really Jersey Jack's

[21:17] Shodestern what people were willing to pay and then Jersey Jack has always delayed getting

[21:22] games out.

[21:23] Stern is just reaping the rewards of what Jack's Shodestern is that these people will spend

[21:30] more money.

[21:31] Regardless.

[21:32] This is the crazy part.

[21:33] Regardless, if you give them a lot, if you just give them anything and make it based on

[21:39] something they like, it doesn't matter.

[21:41] They will buy it and that is what Stern does and they do it so successfully.

[21:46] Now I did hear some debate on whether or not it was ethical to leak images and to a journalistic

[21:51] integrity.

[21:52] I want to tell you this right now.

[21:54] Get out of town with this whole notion that holding an image of a pinball game back 24

[22:00] hours before it goes on IGN and Stern does the typical expect it release.

[22:05] Get out of town that that's damaging to Stern pinball.

[22:09] Journalistic integrity, I have not signed an NDA.

[22:12] I am under no, I'm under no pressure not to share with you stuff when I get it from

[22:18] Stern pinball.

[22:19] I will say this.

[22:20] There are times when I have stuff and I don't share it out of respect for the people

[22:25] that I'm dealing with and I've learned my lesson about not sharing stuff.

[22:30] I just to friends because sometimes that might leak it out and that happened with my

[22:34] boy Mr. Franchion.

[22:35] We got over that and I'm sorry for that again.

[22:38] But moving forward, Stern wants to play this game.

[22:42] They blacklist me on everything.

[22:43] That's fine.

[22:44] It's cool.

[22:45] It doesn't really matter to me.

[22:46] We're going to see the game today.

[22:47] We're going to see the video today.

[22:49] It might be up right now by the time you listen to this.

[22:51] We will have more content on Ninja Turtles as we see more of the gameplay.

[22:58] My goal is to get Greg Colton, Mr. Rare hero because he's the biggest Ninja Turtle fanboy.

[23:03] I want to get him on the show.

[23:04] I want him to give you his point of view after we both watch the game being streamed.

[23:10] That will most likely be the next show about Ninja Turtles.

[23:14] Again, initial impressions to summarize it in a nutshell.

[23:18] In a turtle shell, my summary is this.

[23:21] It is a colorful new Stern machine based on a property that I don't think everybody

[23:27] is really into, but it fits within a great niche for Stern Pinball, considering their

[23:33] portfolio of games.

[23:35] But I still think a Stern is a Stern is a Stern.

[23:38] Every time we see a new one, it is sort of more of the same.

[23:42] We're not seeing them push the envelope in any areas.

[23:45] I think these designers are held back tremendously by the low bomb of this company.

[23:51] And I really just don't feel compelled to buy any of these games, considering how cheap

[23:56] they look compared to what other companies are giving us for similar money.

[24:03] But where they win is Stern understands how to make these games really fun, how to make

[24:07] them approachable, how to make them understandable, they get the fundamentals of Pinball down better.

[24:13] Then some of these other companies that are overly complex put too much in it, make games

[24:18] too hard to maintain.

[24:20] The games are breaking down all the time.

[24:21] Yada yada yada.

[24:22] But I'm here to tell you.

[24:24] I think one of those companies that I've criticized for that has learned a lesson and is going

[24:29] to come out with something that really finally after like so many years, I think finally nails

[24:35] it with a game and you're more to come on that.

[24:39] But it is a new Stern.

[24:42] The last point I'll make is there is no internet connectivity on this game.

[24:47] Here's what I know about the internet connectivity piece of this whole thing.

[24:50] Internet connectivity is coming to Stern Pinball.

[24:53] It was supposed to launch with Ninja Turtles.

[24:56] It got delayed because of the pandemic.

[24:58] Ironically, considering the whole world has been using online.

[25:01] So why would the pandemic slow down going online for Stern Pinball?

[25:05] Now when Stern Pinball goes online, here is what I know.

[25:09] It is not just Ninja Turtles.

[25:11] They are planning to roll out connectivity connectivity connectivity connectivity across the board.

[25:18] So a lot of their previous titles, not I don't know how many, but they're going to be

[25:21] backwards compatible with their internet.

[25:24] So you're going to have internet connectivity with Jurassic Park.

[25:27] You're going to have it with Stranger Things probably.

[25:29] You're going to have it with Ninja Turtles.

[25:31] So they are going to connect these games.

[25:33] And most likely from the sound of it, it'll start with like scoring and leaderboard and

[25:38] downloading code.

[25:39] What I'm really curious, if Stern allows us to do player versus player, because that's

[25:45] where I think it gets really fun.

[25:47] You could have four guys, each one's a different turtle.

[25:50] And you're playing through the entire story mode of the game.

[25:53] Why can't we rethink the way Pinball has played a little bit?

[25:56] I really, really hope they start to think that way.

[26:00] Do I think we'll do that?

[26:02] No, because that requires more work.

[26:04] And once Stern has your money in the bank, again, they're just going to innovate to a level

[26:08] that's enough.

[26:09] And that's where we're at.

[26:11] And that's my final summary of this game.

[26:12] I don't think anything today is going to change my opinion that this is like, I think we've

[26:17] hit the ceiling of what you can expect in modern Stern machines.

[26:22] And it's like my excitement level with each new release continues to get lower and lower

[26:27] and lower.

[26:28] Because you get used to it.

[26:29] You get used to zombie Eddie artwork.

[26:31] You get used to these designers.

[26:32] You get used to the way they do their layouts.

[26:34] You get used to these cheap Fisher price toys.

[26:37] And it's like, show me something more like a T-Rex.

[26:40] Show me something more like Ghostbusters.

[26:44] Like really wow us, okay?

[26:46] Alright everyone, more to come.

[26:47] Obviously we're going to see a lot of details today.

[26:51] Enjoy the Ninja Turtle Day that Stern has for you.

[26:53] Sorry that I spoiled the Zack Sharp.

[26:55] You can't beat Canada.

[26:56] There's a reason we got three Twippies.

[26:58] We get the news out first later.

[27:00] He's his old self again.

[27:01] Nice going Vernon.

[27:03] You just gave Shredder his memory back.
