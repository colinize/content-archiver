[00:00] And now for the show!

[00:09] Oh, welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast!

[00:18] I'm your host, Canada!

[00:19] What is going on here?

[00:21] The Canada Club continues to get more and more members!

[00:24] We are at 448!

[00:27] Now I want to say thank you to each and every one of you because when I went behind the paywall,

[00:32] I think I was around like 200 or something club members.

[00:35] And so now we've almost doubled that number.

[00:38] I want to say thank you to the new members, Dan, Steve, Kurt, Gary, Cameron, Derek, Peter,

[00:45] Victor, Austin, Daniel, Chad.

[00:47] And the last one I'm going to say thank you to right now is Brenda.

[00:51] My wife has finally joined the Canadian club.

[00:53] I was like, baby, if you had a club, I would join it.

[00:57] So let's get right to it because that's what we do on Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:59] I think each and every one of you who listened to the last show really enjoyed hearing from

[01:05] Jennifer and her time at Deep Root Pinball.

[01:08] And I mean it when I say it.

[01:09] Like she was one of the most articulate and well-spoken guests I've ever had on the show.

[01:14] I didn't have to edit out likes and ums and all these pauses and thought.

[01:20] She was very, very well-spoken.

[01:22] And I think it gave us a really great insight into what it was like working over at Deep

[01:28] Root.

[01:29] The summary is always the same.

[01:30] Bobby Mueller, I call him Bobby Mueller because he's a joke.

[01:33] Bobby Mueller was the biggest fool ever to think he could create a pinball manufacturing

[01:39] company.

[01:40] And I want to say that off the record, Jennifer had a lot to say about some of the other people

[01:45] at Deep Root who knew all too well that no games were going to be made.

[01:51] And you know who their names are.

[01:53] She was not that happy when she saw people like Steve Bowden and Quinn go on to other

[01:58] podcasts and convince people that these games were coming.

[02:02] I mean it when I say it.

[02:03] I forgive these people, but I wish some of them would still to this day come out and

[02:08] at least say they were sorry for the campaign they went on to convince everybody in the

[02:13] community that all of these great games were coming.

[02:16] Now the other funny part that happened with this auction is someone bid on an item.

[02:21] It was like a fire and brimstone play field and the play field has gone missing.

[02:27] The irony of this thing that this thing was built with stolen money and now someone stole

[02:32] this game.

[02:33] Here's what I think we should do with all these Deep Root white woods.

[02:35] Okay, I think we should get them all together.

[02:37] I think we should stack them all on top of each other.

[02:41] And I think we should have a pay per view bonfire in which we light all of them on fire

[02:46] and donate the money we would raise to all the real victims of Deep Root Pinball, which

[02:51] are all the investors who did not know their money was going to be stolen and put into

[02:58] this ridiculous pinball venture that Bobby Mueller had no idea what he was doing.

[03:04] Now I also want to say that I'm going to interview more people from Deep Root Pinball.

[03:08] So Jennifer is not the last person we are going to hear from because I want to hear

[03:12] from designers.

[03:14] I want to hear from software people.

[03:15] I also want to hear from Steve Boud and I hope someone else interviews him because he's

[03:19] not going to come on Canadian Spinball podcast, but it would be great to hear from him and

[03:24] actually get the truth of what it was like walking through that door because that company

[03:30] was an S-H-I-T-S-H-O-W.

[03:34] It was and he somehow still hasn't come clean about any of this anyway.

[03:39] So I think we should light those games on fire and I also think everyone needs to stop thinking

[03:43] that these games are somehow like worthwhile to keep pursuing.

[03:48] There is no future for any of these games.

[03:51] The world does not need food truck.

[03:53] It doesn't need fire and brimstone.

[03:56] It doesn't need any of this and you can see by all of these games.

[03:59] They were all about like 60 or 70% complete, but as Stern Pinball and everyone else who's

[04:05] ever tried to make pinball machines has shown us, it's not about being 80% of the way there

[04:11] to actually make a pinball machine.

[04:14] You need 100% of the game finished or else it's not enjoyable.

[04:19] One broken mech in a pinball machine makes it unplayable.

[04:24] And then we look at these incomplete whitewoods.

[04:26] Like I was listening to John Norris talk like, oh my game was fully flippable, but I need

[04:30] it mechanical help to fix some stuff.

[04:32] No, it wasn't.

[04:33] No, it wasn't done, John.

[04:35] There wasn't.

[04:36] There's no Merlin's arcade that was finished that was right around the corner.

[04:40] These games are done.

[04:41] The company is a joke.

[04:43] It's over.

[04:44] It is all over.

[04:45] So instead of talking about deep root, let's go around the horn and talk about what's happening

[04:49] at the other pinball companies right now.

[04:51] It's what I love to do.

[04:52] Go around the horn, go around the pinball world.

[04:54] So let's start with Stern Pinball.

[04:56] Is there any news over at Stern?

[04:58] There's not.

[04:59] I think we're all feeling this right now.

[05:01] Stern not having a game out in April has created a void in the pinball world.

[05:06] It's kind of boring.

[05:07] Like, usually right now we would be so excited because we'd be one week away from the next

[05:13] Stern game.

[05:14] Now, we know it's not going to be Venom Comic Book Edition in April.

[05:17] Will that come out in August?

[05:19] You know how I feel.

[05:20] I think it's going to be Jaws.

[05:22] I think it's going to be Keith Owens.

[05:24] And I think it's going to be in August.

[05:25] And I think Randy Martinez is going to be the artist.

[05:29] So without Stern having a new game, that doesn't mean there's nothing new going on over at

[05:35] Stern.

[05:36] As a rush owner, I want to highlight that there is a company called Ninja Camp Mods.

[05:41] Now, if you haven't heard of Ninja Camp Mods, they make basically what is a Cliffy Protector,

[05:47] but it's 3D printed.

[05:48] And this company is gaining momentum in the pinball world because for a few reasons, they're

[05:53] available right now and Cliffies don't always become available right away.

[05:57] The other thing I like about Ninja Camp Mods is this.

[06:00] You can change the color of those scoop protectors, which actually makes it nice because then

[06:06] you can match the color of your scoop protector with the Playfield artwork.

[06:11] So this company is starting to get a lot of traction and a lot of excitement in the pinball

[06:15] world.

[06:16] And so keep an eye out for them Ninja Camp Mods.

[06:18] And no, I am not shilling for them.

[06:20] I make no money by highlighting them.

[06:22] I just think if you have a rush, you're going to need to have some of these protectors in

[06:26] your game.

[06:27] Now, what else is going on over at Stern Pinball?

[06:29] Now, there's a lot of debate about what is on the line currently at Stern Pinball and

[06:35] then it becomes a head scratcher.

[06:37] Because you know what game Stern is making more of right now?

[06:40] The one game nobody wants more of right now and that is Mandalorian.

[06:45] And for some reason, Stern is cranking out more mandos, but here's the problem.

[06:51] Distributors have Mandalorian in their inventory.

[06:54] So they don't need more Mandalorians.

[06:57] They need more Godzilla.

[06:59] They need more Elvira.

[07:00] They need more Deadpool.

[07:02] They need more stranger things.

[07:04] The games that people want are not currently being cranked out at Stern.

[07:09] Now why is this happening?

[07:11] Why is Stern making more mandos and not more of the other stuff?

[07:15] I'll tell you why.

[07:16] And I'm just going to say this.

[07:17] And Joe Abadi, if you're listening, this is the truth.

[07:22] Mandalorian did not live up to Stern's expectations.

[07:26] Stern thought Mandalorian would do better.

[07:28] They didn't do as well as a Star Wars pin should do.

[07:32] It's another example of how Stern just can't hit a home run with a Star Wars property,

[07:39] which is so painful.

[07:40] And I bet they have a ton of Mandalorian parts that they ordered because they thought

[07:46] the game would be more popular.

[07:49] And so that is why they're running more mandos.

[07:51] They just want to get the stuff built.

[07:54] The other part is this.

[07:55] And this is why Stern is so smart.

[07:57] Stern contractually obligates its distributors to buy a certain amount of pro and premiums

[08:05] to get the LE allotment.

[08:08] So if you want an LE, you might have to guarantee you're going to buy like eight premiums and

[08:13] two pros, something along those lines.

[08:15] So that means there are probably distributors that need to acquire or purchase these additional

[08:22] pros and premiums even if they don't need them.

[08:26] And that is the role of the dice with distributors and dealers, right?

[08:30] If you want your LEs, you got to commit to these other versions of the game.

[08:35] And the big problem is if the game doesn't become a home run, you might be stuck with

[08:40] inventory.

[08:41] So I think a lot of distributors are going to be stuck with Mando inventory.

[08:45] And even if Joe Abadi's Grogu Mech is out there, it's not going to change the fact that

[08:51] I think Mandalorian and many of you do too.

[08:55] It's a game that just does not capture the magic of the show.

[08:59] And it is definitely, definitely not a world under glass.

[09:02] I mean, come on, you've heard me complain about this game so many times.

[09:06] Where is the magic?

[09:07] It's Star Wars.

[09:08] Okay, let's go on.

[09:10] So speaking of Mando, where's the Mandalorian topper?

[09:13] I was just thinking about this the other day in the shower.

[09:15] You know, it's like, you know what, like Mandalorians been out like what, like two years now, over

[09:20] a year now?

[09:21] Okay, so Mandalorian's been out a year and this topper, which is the droid that's supposed

[09:26] to go back and forth is supposed to be one of Stern's most elaborate and amazing toppers

[09:31] ever.

[09:32] The question is, where is it?

[09:34] And not just the Mando topper, where are the other toppers?

[09:38] Because I told you Stern is about to rerun a lot of the old toppers that people have

[09:43] been wanting.

[09:44] Now I'm not sure if you're going to get a Black Knight topper, but I think you're going

[09:48] to get more Ghostbusters toppers, you're going to get more Elvira toppers, which we're currently

[09:52] seeing.

[09:53] I hope they do another run of Munsters toppers, but those were very problematic, so probably

[09:58] not.

[09:59] But why is Stern's topper game so slow?

[10:02] It makes no sense to me.

[10:03] It's like, shouldn't they just have a topper division and there's so much money to be

[10:07] made with toppers because they're beautiful.

[10:09] I love a good topper.

[10:11] And so the Mando topper is not here.

[10:13] And what about a Godzilla topper?

[10:15] But usually, Zambietti has designed the topper and it's not too intricate or complicated

[10:21] to get out, but where is the Godzilla topper?

[10:24] And I know like everyone is suffering from delays and clearly this is also impacting

[10:29] the accessories with these companies, but that is where we are at.

[10:33] I still expect from Stern Pimbal, and I mean this, I'm going to stand behind this.

[10:37] I still expect Stern Pimbal to come out with another run of Ghostbusters.

[10:43] I expect them to do another run of Jurassic Park.

[10:46] I think they're going to do what they did with Elvira with all of their hot games.

[10:52] They're going to make special editions of each of these games and they're going to be 20K

[10:57] plus machines.

[10:58] It's going to happen, people.

[10:59] And I think Ghostbusters might be the first thing they do it with.

[11:02] I think there could be a new version of Ghostbusters with new armor, new artwork, and people are

[11:07] going to go crazy for it.

[11:09] And the big question is this, will they fix some of the shot geometry on Ghostbusters?

[11:15] And I have to imagine the answer is no.

[11:18] There's no way they would do it.

[11:20] If they fix the flipper gap on Ghostbusters, they would have like 5,000 people super pissed

[11:26] off that they have the version that nobody wants now.

[11:29] So I think they keep it the same.

[11:31] They don't need to fix the flipper problem because people will buy it anyway and they

[11:36] will make a gazillion dollars on a remake of Ghostbusters.

[11:40] All right.

[11:41] Well, what's going on in the spooky world?

[11:42] Well, we know not too much.

[11:44] We know spooky is also feeling the impacts of the supply shortage.

[11:48] They're waiting on parts.

[11:49] They're not cranking out these machines at the same pace they did with their previous

[11:54] title.

[11:55] I heard that Ultraman right now, which they need to make 500 of, is still around 150 have

[12:01] been made.

[12:03] So they are waiting for delays.

[12:05] Now I think there is a silver lining in all of these delays.

[12:08] If you think about it, these delays have meant that not many people have got their Halloween's

[12:13] or Ultraman that has given spooky more time to polish these games.

[12:18] And you know, these games need a lot of polish.

[12:21] So I guess it's like a race, right?

[12:23] Can spooky get these games to a better place when the majority of people have them?

[12:28] Remember, it's not just Ultraman that hasn't cranked out the door.

[12:32] The majority of Halloween owners also have not received their games.

[12:37] So they've got a long way to go.

[12:39] And I did go on the pin side marketplace and I typed in Ultraman collectors edition and

[12:45] it's not good.

[12:46] Like it's not good.

[12:47] Like everyone who's locked in to their Ultraman is going to lose money.

[12:52] There is a collectors edition of Ultraman available, right?

[12:56] This was a $2,000 deposit.

[12:59] There is a spot available for 500 bucks and nobody's bought it.

[13:04] There are a lot of machines available for purchase around $1,500 to $2,000 less than

[13:10] people committed to spooky.

[13:12] So I think, you know, spooky is never going to really be able to turn this around.

[13:17] They're not.

[13:18] I think the games will get better, but I don't ever think we're going to see these games

[13:22] increase in value.

[13:23] And I think the lesson will be learned by everybody.

[13:27] There is no way the next spooky title will sell out sight unseen.

[13:32] There is no way this community is going to hand them non-refundable deposits sight unseen.

[13:38] It's just not going to happen.

[13:39] Like this burned a lot of people.

[13:42] And I think a lot of people went in on these games not to flip them, but nobody goes in

[13:47] on a new pinball machine and wants to lose $2,000 on it before they buy it.

[13:52] See that's the pain point.

[13:53] Because think about it like this.

[13:54] Imagine if you didn't pre-order this game.

[13:57] You didn't lock in your money and then you walk up to this company today.

[14:02] You could save yourself $2,000 and get a brand new inbox machine.

[14:08] So that is the lesson I hope everyone has learned with this spooky game is it does not

[14:13] pay to rush towards spooky's FOMO efforts.

[14:17] They got away with it with Rick and Morty because Rick and Morty was Rick and Morty,

[14:22] but it failed horribly here for us as customers.

[14:26] It was good for them because they locked in 1,750 non-refundable pre-order deposits.

[14:32] I don't think we make that mistake again.

[14:34] Alright Jersey Jack Pinball.

[14:36] Here's the deal with Jersey Jack Pinball.

[14:37] Toy Story is coming in June people.

[14:39] Mark my words.

[14:40] Toy Story will be revealed and on the line in June.

[14:45] People will be flipping Toy Story in June.

[14:48] That is what I hear is happening.

[14:50] I heard production is beginning right now or shortly and I fully expect Toy Story to

[14:56] be revealed just like Guns N' Roses.

[14:59] There will be an amazing launch video.

[15:01] There will be a hundred games that are available new in box on launch day.

[15:06] And the main questions around Toy Story are still the following.

[15:10] What playfield manufacturer will they use?

[15:13] Will it be Mirko?

[15:14] Will there be issues?

[15:16] How many collectors editions are they going to make and how much will they be?

[15:21] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[15:22] I think they're going to announce there are a thousand collectors editions.

[15:26] I think like I said before, 500 Woody's and 500 Buzz editions.

[15:31] I think they're going to be $15,999, $16,000 for a collector's edition.

[15:37] I also think they're going to learn a lesson.

[15:39] I think Jersey Jack Pinball is going to put a limit on how many Toy Stories they will

[15:44] make in 2022 because they need to get to the next game by the end of the year.

[15:50] And I don't think they're going to take like 5,000 orders or say we're making 5,000

[15:55] LEDs of this game the way they did with Guns N' Roses.

[15:59] They can't do it.

[16:00] They don't have the manufacturing efficiency to take 5,000 orders if they want to get two

[16:07] new games out in a year.

[16:09] Even just two new games out in 18 months or better yet, even just two games out in two

[16:16] years.

[16:17] They haven't even hit that milestone.

[16:19] Two games in two years.

[16:21] And so I hope they're learning a lesson that the way for them to solve this problem is

[16:26] just don't take that many orders, raise the price on each game because you know you can

[16:33] and then get to the next game.

[16:34] I think everyone is waiting and sitting on their hands just waiting for Jersey Jack Pinball

[16:41] to show us their next game.

[16:43] Guns N' Roses is a great game.

[16:45] I would argue it is a musical masterpiece Pinball experienced but everybody, me included, we're

[16:51] kind of over it.

[16:53] We're sick of talking about Guns N' Roses and the play field issues.

[16:57] We want to see what's next from Jersey Jack.

[17:00] We're excited to see what's next from Jersey Jack.

[17:03] So Jersey Jack, do us a favor, give us your next game please, we've got a few months to

[17:08] go.

[17:09] Alright, what else is going on?

[17:10] Multimorphic.

[17:11] Jerry's Multimorphic platform.

[17:14] So I want to get Jerry on the show.

[17:16] Jerry wants to control the conditions by which I interview him.

[17:20] He said, look, I'll do the interview but then you have to release it for free for everybody

[17:24] else to listen to you within 24 hours.

[17:27] And you know what?

[17:28] Nobody tells Canada how to do his show.

[17:30] So I'm in negotiations with Jerry.

[17:33] I'm going to find a middle ground but he doesn't get to dictate that.

[17:37] I know why he's doing it.

[17:39] He doesn't want people to have to sign up for the Canada club to hear the interview.

[17:43] And I look at it like, well then I don't need you.

[17:45] Because the Canada club is doing amazingly well without any P3 Multimorphic interviews.

[17:51] So Jerry will talk.

[17:53] Anyway, they had a great showing at TPF.

[17:55] They did.

[17:56] They had a constant line to play this game.

[17:58] And now the question becomes this.

[18:00] When will the games go out?

[18:02] And I've said this before.

[18:03] I think he's got an extreme part delay and I think people are going to be waiting months

[18:08] to get their games.

[18:09] And I am curious how patient people will be.

[18:11] Now Jerry just put out an update and I want to read what he wrote.

[18:15] And I give Jerry credit at least he's showing us pictures of the parts.

[18:20] This is something that Haggis can't seem to do.

[18:22] But he wrote, as you can infer from the attached picture of our warehouse floor, most, not

[18:28] quite all, but most of the parts for our next large batch of machines have arrived.

[18:35] We will be ramping up production in the coming months and working through still growing queue

[18:40] of orders.

[18:41] Machines and playfields will be built in parallel queues.

[18:45] So existing P3 owners won't be waiting behind machine orders to receive their new kits.

[18:51] That said, orders coming in far exceeded the number of parts we already had on order.

[18:58] So our estimated production times include estimated delivery schedules for additional parts.

[19:04] There you have it.

[19:05] Let me just summarize what he's saying right there.

[19:08] We're delayed.

[19:09] We're going to be delayed.

[19:11] We didn't order enough parts.

[19:13] The demand was higher than we thought.

[19:15] You're going to be waiting.

[19:16] Okay.

[19:17] So that's where it's at.

[19:18] But I do give Jerry credit.

[19:20] He's being transparent.

[19:21] Now look, when you say stuff like in the coming months, let me let me just break that down.

[19:27] That could mean anything.

[19:28] What is in the coming months mean to you?

[19:31] Does it mean three months?

[19:33] Five months?

[19:34] Six months?

[19:35] 12 months?

[19:36] 48 months?

[19:37] 65 months?

[19:39] Anything in the future is technically in the coming months.

[19:42] So all of these updates are always purposely vague on some level.

[19:47] He knows and everyone else knows how long it takes to get these parts in.

[19:51] And from what we've heard, traditionally in the pinball world, when you have to wait for

[19:55] parts, it usually takes months.

[19:58] And some parts take four months, five months to get in.

[20:02] So we will see what happens.

[20:03] That's going to be the thing with Jerry and Weird Out.

[20:06] It's like people want this game.

[20:08] He's finally got a game with demand, but now he's got to get people their games.

[20:12] All right, let's go on to Home Pin.

[20:14] Now these guys, I mean, they're taking the cake for the worst pinball launch of all

[20:18] time and it continues to get better and better each week.

[20:21] Mike is finding new ways to do stupid things to get this game to market.

[20:25] So first and foremost, Mike has come out and said, we are not going to be marketing this

[20:29] game.

[20:30] We are going to hand over the marketing and the sales of this game to the distributors

[20:35] of it.

[20:36] So how does that sound to all of you?

[20:38] Is that not the biggest red flag ever?

[20:41] It's basically saying we're so not proud of the product we made that we don't even want

[20:46] to stand behind it and we don't even want to celebrate and promote it when it comes out.

[20:50] I mean, what a weird way to launch a pinball machine.

[20:53] And the other thing he's doing, he's got this like Facebook page, the Home Pin factory,

[20:57] where they show you pictures of how they're making the game and all the different parts,

[21:02] but they won't show you the game and this weird correspondence between them.

[21:06] It's like, if you came here looking to see the pinball machine, we're not going to show

[21:10] it to you.

[21:11] We're going to show you everything else but the machine.

[21:13] So it's basically a Facebook page to show you how the sausage is made and the ingredients

[21:18] of the sausage, but you never really get to see the sausage.

[21:22] What a weird approach.

[21:23] And the other thing they did is this, they put out a flyer of just the cabinet of Spinal

[21:28] Tap that has the British flag on the side, looks a lot like Austin Powers.

[21:32] Now maybe you didn't notice this, but take a good look at that British flag that Mike

[21:37] put on that cabinet.

[21:39] It is missing red stripes from the flag.

[21:42] The thin red stripes that are on the diagonal, they're removed from the flag.

[21:46] And I'm looking at this, I'm like, this can't be right.

[21:49] Like hopefully they fix this when it goes to final production.

[21:52] You're not allowed to change a nation's flag.

[21:55] You're not allowed to like remove stripes from the British flag.

[21:59] And I bet you they're not there.

[22:00] I mean, everything he does, it's like finding new ways to have the worst launch ever.

[22:05] And the first person to give the world an official look at what the playfield art is.

[22:11] And I've heard from someone who's seen a lot more photos than the one I shared with everybody.

[22:15] And let me tell you, it's bad.

[22:17] It's really bad.

[22:19] And he said, like I wish Mike would have just hired someone who knew what they were doing.

[22:22] But this is home pin people.

[22:24] They've arguably made one of the worst pinball machines of all time in Thunderbirds.

[22:29] It's the same team working on this game.

[22:32] Why would we think that after releasing one of the worst games ever, that the sophomore

[22:37] effort would be any better?

[22:39] No, it's going to be a disaster.

[22:41] It's going to be as bad, if not worse than you think.

[22:44] I can't wait because this is always great content for Canada.

[22:48] All right.

[22:48] Who am I missing in the pinball world?

[22:50] We got Dutch pinball trickling out Big Lebowski's.

[22:53] I've heard that they're going to make another game after the Big Lebowski.

[22:57] Here's what I want to know from Dutch pinball.

[22:58] I just want to know where they are with making the EA's whole.

[23:03] I think they should tell us where they're at in that journey.

[23:07] And do you know how many EA's have been made whole?

[23:09] Because I don't.

[23:10] Same thing with Highway Pinball or the Pinball Brothers.

[23:13] These two companies, the thing I can't get over is there are still people who paid in

[23:18] full for both an alien and a Big Lebowski that don't have them.

[23:23] And years have gone by.

[23:25] Like six, seven years have gone by.

[23:27] And those people who paid in full with their hard earned money are watching new

[23:32] buyers unbox games they paid in full for years ago.

[23:37] And as a community, we are standing by and just accepting this.

[23:42] Like I saw the Pinball Brothers guys there at TPF.

[23:45] I didn't want to talk to them.

[23:47] I don't really want to talk to either of these companies because the bottom line is this.

[23:52] I don't want to celebrate robbing Peter to pay Paul as your business model.

[23:57] And the whole thing is like, well, this is the only way to get people their games.

[24:01] Is it? Is this the only way to get people their games?

[24:05] Maybe. But if that is the case, then I want you to update us as a community where you are.

[24:11] Because my fear is this, they're not doing it the way they said they were going to do it.

[24:16] They're robbing Peter way more than they're paying Paul and they're taking in all these

[24:20] new orders, but they're really not giving the original people their games.

[24:25] And so the whole thing is still just a downer.

[24:27] It's like we're still looking at the same game six years later.

[24:31] And this is why Stern Pinball is so important.

[24:33] And I mean it when I said it on my Facebook Live.

[24:36] This is what happens when Stern Pinball goes away, right?

[24:39] We're still waiting for Cactus Canyon.

[24:41] Ellie's, when are you getting your Cactus Canyon?

[24:43] Ellie, you don't know.

[24:45] You really don't know.

[24:46] You ordered a game in October, October, November, December, January, February,

[24:53] March, April.

[24:54] We are seven months since CGC took your money on Cactus Canyon and you don't have your game.

[25:00] You don't know when you're getting your game.

[25:02] This is the problem.

[25:03] Everyone else.

[25:04] And I mean this.

[25:05] Everyone else other than Stern Pinball.

[25:07] It's just amateur hour.

[25:10] I would say spooky is transparent.

[25:11] They tell you how many they can make a week.

[25:14] They tell you like when you can expect your game and spooky is delivered on that.

[25:18] So really, everyone else, when Stern and spooky are not setting your expectations,

[25:23] you will be sorely disappointed.

[25:26] Your deadlines will be missed.

[25:28] I mean, I haven't even talked about Haggis.

[25:30] Like, so Damon is telling people that their games are going into testing in April.

[25:34] OK, it is April.

[25:36] And if people's games are going into testing in April, does Damian mean that your physical

[25:42] game is going into testing?

[25:44] When I think about that, I think it's like my machine and you're testing the switches

[25:48] and the buttons and the screens and the monitors and the gameplay.

[25:52] You're testing everything so that when it tests OK, that's my game going into a box

[25:57] and I'm getting it.

[25:58] Now, here's the thing.

[25:59] It's April.

[26:00] And if games are going into testing this month, then surely he can share photos

[26:05] of those games in testing.

[26:07] What I hope he doesn't mean is that your game is in testing because we're testing

[26:12] the prototype to make sure everything is right before we build your game.

[26:17] And this is the thing.

[26:17] I am challenging Damian to show us a picture of people's games in April in testing.

[26:24] And I put out an offer.

[26:25] I'll extend it to the end of April.

[26:27] If someone gets their fathom by the end of April, I will send that person

[26:32] 250 bucks for proving Canada wrong.

[26:35] But I just want these companies to be more transparent.

[26:38] I mean, is there anything wrong with that?

[26:40] Like holding these companies accountable?

[26:42] It's Damian who's telling people your game is going into testing.

[26:46] And he's also saying this when he's asking people to pay in full.

[26:50] I get nervous with all of this.

[26:52] If you're asking people to pay in full, then put up the photos.

[26:55] It's like put up or shut up at this point.

[26:57] Like show us your progress.

[26:59] The fact that he's still not showing the progress would have me somewhat nervous.

[27:03] Everybody, thank you so much for joining the Canada Club.

[27:06] I'm talking to Todd Tucky this week.

[27:08] I'll be talking to Deeproot again.

[27:11] And I love the fact that this club keeps growing and we can give you like a half

[27:15] hour show that just goes around the pinball horn.

[27:17] I don't think I missed anybody.

[27:18] I love doing the show.

[27:20] I love doing it for all of you.

[27:21] And I can't wait to give you so many great episodes of Canada's pinball

[27:25] podcast and me, Brenda and Killian, we thank you so much because I know you're

[27:30] contributing money every month and I want to make sure I give you the best show possible.

[27:34] Have a great day.
