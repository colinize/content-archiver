[00:00] Dancing through the fire, cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me reward.

[00:09] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:13] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:16] Stern Pinball releases Dungeons & Dragons, the much anticipated new game from Stern Pinball,

[00:24] ushering in 2025 with a new pinball experience.

[00:30] I wanna give you my thoughts on this game after thinking about it all night.

[00:35] We all went to bed, we all read the commentary, we all saw the video, we all heard Dwight explain

[00:42] the game, Brian Eddy, George Gomez, we've looked at the pictures of this game, and you

[00:47] know, I've got a lot of feelings on this game.

[00:51] And most of them are very, very positive.

[00:55] And I think two things are happening with this title.

[00:59] I think there is an interesting dichotomy happening across all of Pinball.

[01:06] We now have two games, Dungeons & Dragons, and Evil Dead, that are loading up the pinball

[01:14] machine with incredible worlds under glass.

[01:19] With some of the best theme integration we've seen in all of Pinball.

[01:24] And they are also two titles that the theme alone is the reason why most people don't

[01:32] really want them.

[01:33] Now here's the thing, I think all of us as grown Pinball enthusiasts can do two things

[01:41] at once.

[01:42] We can be very, very impressed with a pinball machine and still not want to buy it.

[01:50] And that doesn't mean we're indicting the machine.

[01:55] And I think that's what's been going on because I think Pinball now is becoming very, very

[02:00] personal.

[02:02] The reasons why you would buy a game have to speak to you on a personal level.

[02:08] But let's talk about the game itself.

[02:10] I look at this game and I've been thinking about this game and I'm looking at it right

[02:14] now.

[02:15] And I think this is one of the greatest stern efforts in terms of putting a world under

[02:22] glass into a pinball machine.

[02:26] What do you want in pinball people, right?

[02:28] You want a major toy.

[02:29] My gosh, this has a major dynamic interactive toy.

[02:35] It does so much cool stuff.

[02:37] It is voiced by an amazing voice actor.

[02:41] You know, Raph the Relentless voiced by Michael Dorn.

[02:45] I mean, this dragon is awesome.

[02:48] You know, it reminded me of Smaug a little bit from Jersey Jack Pinball, but it does

[02:53] much more than Smaug does.

[02:55] I like the way Smaug talks to you, but do you bash Smaug?

[02:59] No.

[03:00] Does he fire pinballs at you?

[03:01] No.

[03:02] The stern pinball has put into this game what I think is one of its most impressive

[03:08] and incredible mechanisms they've ever put in a pinball machine and hard stop right there.

[03:16] The moment a company puts a mechanical interactive toy that is humongous and amazing and anybody

[03:24] who walks up to this machine, regardless if they know anything about D&D, regardless

[03:30] if they know anything about pinball, they're going to have a ton of fun shooting at that

[03:36] big dragon.

[03:38] And that's what all of pinball needs.

[03:40] This thing is cooler than anything in Godzilla.

[03:43] It's cooler than anything in Jurassic Park.

[03:46] It is absolutely awesome.

[03:48] I love the way it has like the cave sculpted around it.

[03:52] It's not flat plastic.

[03:53] So I think just right away, looking at what Stern has put into this game, how excited

[04:00] are you now to see what they're going to do with King Kong?

[04:04] A huge interactive ape has to be coming, right?

[04:08] And you look at this dragon next to the shark and jaws and tell me you don't wish that that's

[04:15] what jaws was like.

[04:17] So Keith Elwynn, Brian Eddy just dropped, I think, one of the greatest Stern mechanisms

[04:23] into a pinball machine.

[04:25] So well done on this dragon.

[04:28] The only thing I wish it did, I wished when it was talking, the mouth would move up and

[04:34] down with the words of what it's saying, the way the smog dragon does in Jersey Jack's

[04:40] Hobbit.

[04:41] But it's OK.

[04:42] I'd rather it be a bash toy and be interactive because smog is just a hand puppet in that

[04:50] Hobbit game.

[04:51] So we've got that going on in this game and that is awesome.

[04:55] OK?

[04:56] So what we've got the next major mech in the game is this gelatinous cube.

[05:01] Is that what it is called?

[05:02] I don't know this stuff, by the way.

[05:04] I love it when the stream was happening and these D&D nerds are like, that's not the guy

[05:09] from Monsters Inc.

[05:11] That's the beholder.

[05:13] And I'm going to tell you right now, everybody, 99.9% of grown men who have had sexual relations

[05:21] in life have no idea what the beholder is.

[05:25] OK?

[05:26] So don't come at us with your D&D geekness because that's going to land you what happened

[05:32] when you were a kid.

[05:33] It's going to land you in a headlock from your other male friends who don't want to hear

[05:39] it about the beholder.

[05:40] So we've got this gelatinous cube that freezes the ball with the magnet.

[05:45] It's really huge.

[05:47] I love the balance going on in this game of fire and ice.

[05:52] You notice that the blue and the red, it has a really, really nice sort of balance between

[05:57] those two.

[05:58] And then it freezes the ball there and you have to knock the ball out to put it back

[06:03] into play.

[06:04] And that's not all, right?

[06:06] Another interactive toy in the game.

[06:08] Then we also have the dungeon entrance that pops up below the play field and you can shoot

[06:14] the ball into there.

[06:15] So those three things, for the most part, are the major interactive toys in the game.

[06:21] And like George Gomez always says, you need three major toys to shoot at and I'm happy

[06:27] to see three major toys in this game.

[06:29] I'm also happy to report it's not a fan layout.

[06:33] It has an upper right flipper.

[06:36] It's got a lot of different pathways to shoot at.

[06:39] And I also love the fourth thing I want to call out that I love because I think one of

[06:44] the things that is fun about pinball and one of the most fun things you can put into a pinball

[06:49] machine is a unique way to keep the ball in play.

[06:54] I'm always shocked that more pinball machines don't have really awesome ways to keep the

[07:00] ball alive, right?

[07:02] Like the shooting stars and toad in.

[07:05] And I love the shield in the middle of the flipper gap that pops up and saves your ball.

[07:13] And depending on which character you select, you're going to get more time with that shield.

[07:20] OMG.

[07:21] Yes, more of this please, Stern and everybody else.

[07:26] Like if Harry Potter doesn't have like some magical way to save the ball, what are we

[07:31] even doing here?

[07:32] So that is really cool.

[07:34] You know, when I'm looking at the game right now, I just want to say this, if you're a

[07:38] fan of Dungeons and Dragons and I don't know anybody who is, but if you are, you just got

[07:45] one of the coolest pinball machines ever based on a theme you love.

[07:50] And I love also the details here.

[07:54] Like the flipper bats have artwork on them.

[07:58] It really feels like Stern threw a lot into this game.

[08:01] When you look at the artwork, it is a little busy.

[08:04] You got the map down low that has all these different ways to go.

[08:08] You've got the fire on the left with the dragon.

[08:11] You've got the pathway to the gelatinous cube.

[08:13] There's a lot going on, but it feels very D&D.

[08:17] You know, it almost feels like a D&D book when you open it up and you sort of put the

[08:21] map on the table.

[08:23] That's what this feels like.

[08:24] This feels like it was designed as Dungeons and Dragons from the ground up.

[08:29] And that's another thing that really excites me.

[08:31] This does not feel like Mandalorian.

[08:34] When Mandalorian came out, it felt like Brian Eddy was designing something else and they

[08:39] reskinned it as Mandalorian.

[08:41] It made no sense.

[08:43] Why is there an upper play field?

[08:44] That's his helmet.

[08:45] That doesn't make any sense.

[08:47] And so when I look at this game, what excites me, it's clearly designed as Dungeons and

[08:52] Dragons from the ground up.

[08:55] You could not make this any other game.

[08:57] Maybe you could turn it into a Game of Thrones, but there's nothing else you could turn this

[09:01] into.

[09:02] And I think we need more of that from the ground up.

[09:05] They designed it as Evil Dead.

[09:08] They didn't reskin it as Looney Tunes as well.

[09:11] And I love this.

[09:12] I think it's a good start to the year in pinball.

[09:14] If we're going to get creativity like this.

[09:17] Now, the other part about the game that I don't think we know enough about yet that's going

[09:21] to make this game really either interesting or confusing is the code.

[09:27] And so when you watch that six minute video, there was that moment when Joy-Tron, the game

[09:31] comes in and starts talking.

[09:33] How many of you, like me, it's like in your head, you just kind of fall back in your seat

[09:37] when you hear Dwight explain a ruleset in pinball.

[09:41] And it just makes me nervous.

[09:43] I feel like Dwight, Dwight would make how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

[09:48] confusing, confusing.

[09:49] You know what I'm saying?

[09:50] Like he just has this way when he's talking.

[09:52] It's like, oh, you get really nervous.

[09:55] But I really do feel like he is the right guy for D&D.

[09:59] I mean, he is a guy that makes overly complex role playing game rulesets for pinball.

[10:06] And hello, ding, ding, ding, Dungeons and Dragons is exactly that.

[10:11] So they got the right guy on the job.

[10:13] And so it's really interesting about this game.

[10:16] You select from four characters and you can level them up.

[10:19] You can't create your own custom characters, which would have been nice.

[10:23] I think it would have been nice to create Canada the Brave and make them horrible at

[10:27] pinball.

[10:29] And then when you sign in, you're signing in with your character.

[10:32] I think that was a missed opportunity to give people a chance to like customize their

[10:37] characters.

[10:38] Like why can't you name the character after you?

[10:41] You know, using the game itself the same way you put in your name at the end of a game,

[10:46] that would have been really cool.

[10:47] So you pick the four different characters and then you go on this journey.

[10:52] And they talk about it like that.

[10:53] It's a journey where you're going to be able to sort of select the way you go through the

[10:57] world and you're going to be able to select the way you go through the dungeon.

[11:02] But here's where it gets really interesting is every Sunday they're going to reset and

[11:08] randomize the world within Dungeons and Dragons.

[11:12] So the pathways are going to change.

[11:15] And what's waiting at the end of each passageway is going to change every single Sunday.

[11:21] And when I heard that, I was like, well, really, like how many Sundays are you going to keep

[11:25] this going?

[11:26] I think what they mean by that is they're not going to continually code like new stuff

[11:32] behind each passageway.

[11:35] I think they're just going to be able to randomize it.

[11:37] So if they have like 30 different things you can run into, they'll just randomize that

[11:42] and that will create hundreds, if not thousands of different possibilities of how you can

[11:49] play the game.

[11:50] I wonder if this is going to work well on location or more like Dungeons and Dragons.

[11:57] Is this going to be a better game to play in your basement where you can get more intimate

[12:03] with all of that?

[12:04] Because you know how many people out there are really going to study, study and remember

[12:10] how the dungeon is laid out each Sunday.

[12:13] And are you going to run to your game every Sunday to try to find out what moved around

[12:18] in that world?

[12:19] I don't know.

[12:20] I don't know.

[12:21] I don't think so.

[12:22] Doesn't feel very pinball like, but maybe, but hey, for you D&D nerds out there, maybe

[12:27] that's what you love about D&D and that will excite you.

[12:31] Something I didn't see on the play field that was a little surprising was the 20 sided die.

[12:36] I thought that would be something you would bash and spin, but we're definitely seeing

[12:40] that die all over the animations.

[12:43] As far as the animations go, they look really good.

[12:46] They look really good.

[12:48] So you combine those great animations with all the voice actors in this game.

[12:53] They've got Kevin Smith.

[12:54] I'm surprised they didn't show his face.

[12:56] They showed the other two guys and then they're like, and Kevin Smith, who we're not going

[13:01] to show you by the way.

[13:02] Come on, man.

[13:03] Take some video, Jody and Mr. Sharp.

[13:06] Come on.

[13:07] It's like weird.

[13:08] Like, hey, we got these three dudes.

[13:09] The most famous of all three we're not going to show.

[13:11] So again, again, a great world under glass, well done, stern pinball.

[13:18] Now here's the part I don't like.

[13:20] I don't like the Ellie at all.

[13:24] Like I think the Ellie is the worst of the three.

[13:27] I'm looking at them right now and they've got that big beholder on the right side and

[13:33] that's the side they're using to sell the game.

[13:35] Again, big mistake.

[13:36] It's called Dungeons and Dragons.

[13:38] I want to see a big dragon on the right side of the cabinet.

[13:43] You don't really see it.

[13:45] I like the premium much better than the Ellie and also the Translight on the pro is the nicest.

[13:53] Why can't Stern just get this right?

[13:55] And there's something about that red armor I just don't like at all.

[14:00] And it's the way it's clashing with the green and the blue of the artwork.

[14:04] And I wrote this on my Facebook page, but the way the flames of the armor are interrupting

[14:10] the artwork itself, it's distracting, it doesn't look good.

[14:16] And I'm sorry, Stern, you need to get better at this.

[14:20] When the artist is designing artwork for a cabinet, the dimensions by which they should

[14:26] fill should also take into account how the armor will interrupt the art package that

[14:33] they're creating for the game.

[14:35] Because it's clear what he did.

[14:36] He made it to fit the space of the entire cabinet, but he didn't realize that they're

[14:42] going to be covering up some of that dynamic artwork with the armor.

[14:46] And I think it looks bad.

[14:48] I just don't think it looks good.

[14:50] And here's the other part I don't get.

[14:52] So why do you have red armor on an Ellie and then the T-Molding on the back box is black

[14:59] and then you have black armor on the premium and the T-Molding is red.

[15:05] If you take the back box from the premium with the red T-Molding and put it on the red

[15:11] Ellie armor, it's going to look better and vice versa.

[15:15] So here's the big thing.

[15:16] The thing is this, you know, I like the fact that they talk about this as being on a journey.

[15:22] Because I think each and every one of us is also on a pinball journey.

[15:27] And so as excited as I am about this game, here's the big journey we're all on.

[15:33] When do you start your journey if you want to own a Dungeons and Dragons game?

[15:40] We all know that this Ellie is not going to sell out and you can't absorb a new and box

[15:46] pinball reveal without thinking about two things.

[15:51] How do I feel about the game and is now the right time to go in on one?

[15:57] And if you don't think that way, something's broken in your head because over the last

[16:02] three years now, we have significant data that shows us if you really want this game,

[16:10] you're really going to be able to get a great deal on it.

[16:13] If you wait, the only time you need to go in right away is when there's a feeding frenzy

[16:19] to get one and the Ellie's sell out right away like Jaws, like Metallica Ellie, and that's

[16:27] really it.

[16:29] Something else was always super easy to get and every few months in Ellie loses like $1000

[16:36] on its way to being worth around $9,000 to $10,000.

[16:41] And so when I look at D&D and this Ellie, like it's not going to sell out, it doesn't

[16:46] look any better than the premium.

[16:49] In fact, I think the premium artwork is nicer and I think Stern has a problem because remember

[16:54] Stern's entire business model is built around the Ellie frenzy.

[17:00] If the Ellie frenzy isn't there, their entire model of how they sell games, it starts to

[17:07] collapse like a house of cards because remember, their customers are the distributors and they

[17:13] need distributors to buy every single Ellie and they have an agreement.

[17:18] If you get this many Ellie's, we're only going to give you the Ellie.

[17:22] If you agreed to buy this many premiums and this many pros, okay, but what happens when

[17:28] those Ellie's at $13,000 aren't moving out the door?

[17:33] Then you've got these distros that are loading up on every Ellie on all these premiums and

[17:39] pros because they had to buy it in a bundle and all of a sudden they're going to get nervous

[17:44] because what happens if this game doesn't fly off the shelves at MSRP?

[17:50] And I'm here to tell you right now, this game is not going to fly off the shelves at MSRP

[17:56] because it's Dungeons and Dragons, because it's not a theme that has that take my money

[18:03] now for most of you and also because most of you have seen themes that are even more popular

[18:09] than this have lost so much value over the last two to three years that the wise man,

[18:17] if you're a wise wizard in the world of D&D, you're simply going to wait.

[18:22] And here's the crazy part.

[18:23] If you want an Ellie and you wait six months or less, right, the code's not going to be

[18:28] done in six months, right?

[18:30] So you might as well wait.

[18:32] If you wait and you really want this, you're going to be able to get an Ellie for the price

[18:38] of a premium and you're going to be able to get a premium for like $2,000 less than it

[18:44] is today.

[18:46] And that's the current state of all of Stern's games unless it's a hit game that is an instant

[18:54] sell out.

[18:55] And it's so easy now to sort of gauge that this game is not going to be that.

[19:01] And I think what sucks is is this game is kind of amazing looking, right?

[19:06] It absolutely is an amazing effort.

[19:10] It's just not a theme most of you want.

[19:12] Most of you don't want to go deep into like the D&D world.

[19:16] A dungeon resetting itself every Sunday doesn't really excite you.

[19:22] It will for the D&D fanatics.

[19:25] And so it's interesting, right?

[19:27] I think Stern has made one of its greatest worlds under glass of all time, wrapped it

[19:32] up in a theme that doesn't have that much demand by the pinball buying demographic.

[19:38] And I think we're seeing the same thing with Evil Dead.

[19:40] I saw a newsletter from Spooky.

[19:42] We've almost sold 700.

[19:43] Really?

[19:44] It's been like a month.

[19:45] I feel like it's been almost a month now and we've almost sold 700.

[19:50] They sold 750 Ricken Morties in one day.

[19:54] In one freaking day.

[19:56] When they sell Goonies, they're going to sell all 1000 of them in one day.

[20:00] The reason why they haven't sold 700 Evil Dead's is because it's Evil Dead and it's not mainstream

[20:09] enough.

[20:10] They don't have enough crossover appeal with the pinball buying demographic.

[20:14] And heck, look at everything that's in Evil Dead and it's $3,000 less than Dungeons and

[20:19] Dragons.

[20:20] Now look, let's not pretend that there's anything mechanically in Evil Dead as good as that dragon.

[20:27] There's not.

[20:28] They didn't get Michael Dorn.

[20:30] They don't have like celebrity voices in there.

[20:32] I know Bruce Campbell's in there.

[20:33] You know, his callouts are not as animated as the stuff in the Stern game.

[20:38] But here's the thing.

[20:39] I think they're both epic machines built on mediocre themes for the pinball buying demographic,

[20:47] but they're both great machines.

[20:50] And that's what excites me about pinball is I want to see efforts like this.

[20:55] We should applaud efforts like this and we're allowed to applaud and praise these games and

[21:02] still not buy them.

[21:05] Because by not buying them, we are sending these companies a message.

[21:09] I like what you did here, but I still want a better theme.

[21:15] And to me, that's where I'm at.

[21:17] I think a lot of you are at that place.

[21:19] I think it's going to be a great 2025 because we know the better themes are coming.

[21:25] And it's like I said, there's never been a greater time to wait and see.

[21:30] You know, when people rush in and order an LE like they did yesterday, I look at people

[21:35] like that.

[21:36] I'm like, why?

[21:37] And I get it.

[21:38] I get it.

[21:39] A lot of them are rich.

[21:40] A lot of them don't care.

[21:41] But I always say to them, I get that you have money, but why would you want to buy something

[21:46] for 13 that you know you can get for 10 in just a few months?

[21:52] Brand new condition.

[21:53] Why?

[21:54] I don't get it.

[21:55] And again, they just make so much money.

[21:58] And that's it.

[21:59] That's it.

[22:00] And if you do that, if you're very rich and you make so much money a week, it doesn't matter.

[22:05] I get it.

[22:06] I get it.

[22:07] For a lot of people, $3,000 is nothing.

[22:10] For most of us, it isn't nothing.

[22:12] And the smart person will wait and see.

[22:15] So again, in summary, I love this game from Stern.

[22:19] I love all the passion that went into it.

[22:21] I think it's the most creative thing Brian Eddy's done since he's been at Stern.

[22:26] I think Dwight is going to kill it on the rule set of this game.

[22:31] I think the callouts are going to be fun.

[22:33] I think the animations are great.

[22:35] But I also think if you don't love D&D, all of that might not click with you.

[22:41] It just might not.

[22:42] But I'm really excited.

[22:43] We should just be so excited that Stern Pinball has made a mechanism like that dragon.

[22:51] Look at Avatar people.

[22:52] A $15,000 Avatar.

[22:56] Doesn't have a single interactive toy.

[22:59] I can't underscore this enough.

[23:02] Stern Pinball showed me in this game that they can create a mechanical thing that is

[23:08] embarrassing anything we've seen mechanically from Jersey Jack.

[23:12] Jersey Jack, the ball's in your corner now, guys.

[23:15] You better show up with Harry Potter and it better be more magical than this game.

[23:20] And in the end, you know who's going to win?

[23:22] It's not Jersey Jack.

[23:23] It's not Stern.

[23:24] It's not spooky.

[23:26] In the end, it's going to be us.

[23:29] The consumers are going to win.

[23:30] These companies are going to have to throw magic at us if they want us to spend this

[23:35] much money.

[23:37] It's our world now.

[23:38] It's not theirs.

[23:39] They're going to have to do a lot.

[23:40] And I think what's going to happen here is Stern's going to be like, wow, we did all

[23:44] this work and how come this game isn't selling like hotcakes?

[23:48] Because again, it's not a theme.

[23:50] Most people want it.

[23:52] And you've also passed on so many, so many losses to your buyers, guys.

[23:57] I mean, it's almost like buying an LE now means nothing.

[24:02] It's not a moment like that LE.

[24:03] The translate is hideous on it.

[24:06] What are you guys doing?

[24:08] You got to make the LE so much nicer.

[24:11] It looks horrible.

[24:13] And you shouldn't need a blowhard in Connecticut now.

[24:17] Like telling you this, like you could have done a focus group and just called me in and

[24:20] be like, guys, this LE, no, like you got to change it up.

[24:24] It's not working.

[24:25] It's not nice enough, especially following how beautiful Metallica LE was, especially

[24:33] following how beautiful X-Men LE was.

[24:36] This isn't good enough.

[24:37] It's a step backwards.

[24:39] And it's the easiest thing to get right.

[24:42] Again, if the LE doesn't sell out, Stern's entire frenzy and hype and FOMO falls apart.

[24:51] And before I end this episode, everybody, the Chwippy voting is open.

[24:55] Make sure you go vote for Canada and your favorite in pinball.

[24:59] It's out there.

[25:00] I'll share links.

[25:02] So make sure you do that.

[25:03] I just want to remind everybody, and I'm getting ready now for my Saturday morning spectacular.

[25:08] Peace out.

[25:20] I'm getting ready.

[25:21] I'm getting ready.

[25:22] I'm getting ready.

[25:23] I'm getting ready.

[25:24] I'm getting ready.

[25:25] I'm getting ready.

[25:26] I'm getting ready.

[25:43] I'm getting ready.

[25:44] I'm getting ready.

[25:45] I'm getting ready.

[25:46] I'm getting ready.

[25:47] I'm getting ready.
