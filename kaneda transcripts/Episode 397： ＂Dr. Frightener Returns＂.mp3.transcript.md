[00:00] Welcome to episode 397 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:26] You're like, what are you doing back, Canada? I told you I would upload the interview I did with Larry, you know him as Dr.

[00:34] Frightner. He was previously on Pinside. I think he's deactivated his account. But we have a very spirited

[00:41] conversation about Willy Wonka and Jersey Jack Pinball because ironically we did this before I was

[00:48] called terrible by JJP. But he has some very strong opinions about why Willy Wonka is the greatest

[00:55] game ever and I have some counter points. I think you'll enjoy the interview. We have seen some

[01:00] progress. If you've seen the news over the past few days, Jersey Jack himself has been calling

[01:05] people up and offering refunds to anyone who bought a play field, which I think is the right move.

[01:12] And I think it's really good to see that the manufacturers are now starting to admit that there's a

[01:19] problem and be offering people some restitution. Now is a new play field, a good enough solution for

[01:27] everybody we will see. From what I'm reading, it seems to be a gesture that people are accepting

[01:35] and will people do a play field swap? I don't think many people can. That would cost around another

[01:40] thousand or more dollars to accomplish. But at least it's something and it means they're listening

[01:45] and it means this show and other shows out there and people who have spoken with their wallets

[01:50] have achieved the desire we have been trying to get for a few weeks now and that's them to admit

[01:56] there's a problem because they wouldn't do this if they weren't admitting that there was an issue

[02:01] with those games. And I'm also hearing that they've found the problem and they've fixed it or

[02:07] they're fixing it. So that is another thing that Jack and company are telling people. Now the

[02:13] question then becomes what becomes of all those games that were made during the period in which

[02:18] there was an issue and why didn't they fix this problem when they knew it was happening during

[02:23] Pire to the Caribbean? So that's always going to linger over those first production games of Willy

[02:28] Wonka. And so for me, all eyes are going to be on a few things. On the replacement play fields

[02:35] people get to make sure the quality is there that they actually did fix the problem and then those

[02:40] collectors additions of Willy Wonka. I think people are going to be looking at them very closely

[02:45] to see what the issues are if there are any. We still though have not heard from Stern on this.

[02:51] What is Stern doing? Stern's been very quiet. I mean this this hit Jack harder. I think Jack

[02:56] had a response and I think he's doing the right thing by calling his customers. Are people getting

[03:00] phone calls from Zach Sharp or from anyone at Stern Pimball from all the Jurassic Parks that have

[03:05] been affected? We haven't seen anything yet. So the ball is now in Stern's court to do something

[03:10] on this issue. But I just want to thank all of you out there who have remained vocal and have been

[03:15] in support of us continuing to talk about this issue on Canadian Pimball podcast. I also want to

[03:21] say before I air the interview that I just want to thank all of you who have reached out and with

[03:26] supportive words and saying, hey Chris, like take a break, you know, take the time you need, like

[03:30] we'll still be here like we love your show. And I want to say I really appreciate it. I

[03:35] appreciate everyone who listens to this show. And I have been doing a lot of thinking over the last

[03:39] few days and a lot of you guys have said this. You can't have it both ways. If you're going to speak

[03:45] the way we speak on this show, the manufacturers are not going to be happy with you. And you're not

[03:51] they're not going to be your friends. They're not going to invite you over for tours. They're not

[03:55] going to give you access to their stuff. They're going to think you are a terrible person and that

[04:01] you're terrible for Pimball because when we speak candidly and when we talk the way we do on this show,

[04:08] sometimes we're bad for business. Sometimes we're bad for the hype they're trying to create around

[04:13] the games. And the last thing they want to do is is hear that some guy with just a $200 microphone

[04:21] is telling 2500 people not to buy any games right now. And that $200 microphone that is broadcasting

[04:31] out a message like that could potentially be costing some of these companies over a million

[04:37] dollars in sales. And to them that is egregious to them use of Pimball media and an egregious

[04:47] terrible person to have in the hobby. But I'm here to tell everyone right now and all manufacturers

[04:52] who listen to the show and all the fans of the show, we're not going to stop taking that approach.

[04:58] This kind of analysis of this hobby I think is important. I think speaking our minds candidly and

[05:04] not holding back, I'd rather do that. I'd rather live a life in which my legacy within this hobby is

[05:11] that versus someone who just cheerleads everything from every manufacturer because they really hope to

[05:16] get one of the designers on the show to talk about the game. You know, I'd rather my legacy be

[05:21] something much more meaningful than that. Okay. And you can hear those interviews with all those

[05:26] internal people over at JJP and Stern with every other podcast who talks to those people

[05:32] ad nausea. All right. Okay, everyone. I'm also putting up this podcast for a friend of the show

[05:37] who has a drive today. And he said, I need more Canadian Spinball podcast. Will you please get it up?

[05:43] Might be a little late. I said I was going to do it last night. But this is for Mr. Christopher

[05:47] Franchi. We can't wait to see your artwork on a future game. I think I say on this podcast that I

[05:53] wish he had done Willy Wonka. He would have crushed it. All right. Everyone, this is episode 397. Enjoy

[05:58] the interview. I don't know when the next show will be, but but but rest at night knowing the show

[06:03] is not going away. And you're not going to have to suffer the slings and arrows of the other 37 shows.

[06:09] Okay, we will be back. Everyone have a great day. All right. I want to welcome back to the show.

[06:14] Larry, aka Dr. Frightner on Pinside. Everyone's favorite new version of Canada. Larry, welcome

[06:21] back to the show. I'm happy to be here. We want you wanted to come back on and tell me why I am

[06:30] wrong on Willy Wonka. So we're going to talk about that. And we're going to talk about you heard

[06:34] from Jack on the clear code as well. And then we want to talk a little bit about Pimbal Innovation.

[06:39] How's that sound? Sounds like a great time. All right. So why am I wrong on Willy Wonka when I say

[06:45] that they took the movie, everyone loved and put it into a blender with the code of the game?

[06:51] Well, probably you would start with the fact that a pinball probably won't fit the blender,

[06:55] but let's look at a big blender. No, the game is a lot of fun. And by the way, if you look at my

[07:01] Facebook, I shared some videos. You know, I'll tell you the thing I've learned about Jersey Jack

[07:07] Pimball games is their code is so deep. And it goes so far as like, you know, the Hobbit. My God,

[07:14] you have to play the game for 40 minutes to win it. And you know, I actually had a good friend of mine

[07:20] come over last night and he just waxed Willy Wonka and he scored 24 million. I got to see pure

[07:27] imagination. I got to see the gobs stopper mode. I got to see all these cool things that are so,

[07:33] you know, unfortunately for a player like myself who's not that good, buried so far, so deep into the

[07:39] game. And it just really shows like how much work was put into it. And I don't think you see that

[07:46] from most other Pimball companies. They don't go to those links, so depths to create these amazing

[07:54] sequences. And then the things you see on the screen. I mean, let's be honest, there's nobody,

[08:00] not even in the same solar system as Jersey Jack when it comes to creating that world especially

[08:06] on the screen. And I really do think that the game is magical. I love how like all these different

[08:13] areas of the Pimball machine, like you hit it, it creates different sound effects. And, you know,

[08:20] I mean, every Pimball game Larry usually has sound effects when you hit a switch. But let me

[08:24] know I'm talking about like unique sound effects like you hit different things you get different

[08:29] sounds. Right. Anyway, go ahead. Well, let me ask you a question because I asked you to ask Jack

[08:33] one very specific thing that they've never fully answered. And that is do they have the rights to use

[08:40] the video clips from the movie with the actor's voices synced up? Did you ask him that?

[08:44] You know, I just I just simply asked them, you know, when they do more code down the road with

[08:54] they been adding more clips. And he said it was possible. And, you know, but like I was telling you

[09:00] a second ago, I watched somebody go all the way through the game and it has a ton of clips. And

[09:07] if you go to my Facebook page, you'll see that very clearly. You know, this brings up the clips.

[09:11] The clips don't have voices. So first of all, I have to admit Larry, you didn't ask the question.

[09:18] When he's in the walk that's it. That's it. That's it. There's only one clip. Yeah, there's only one though.

[09:25] Yeah, well, you know, that brings up an interesting topic that this is kind of diverting from

[09:30] the question you asked, but I have a question for you. When the Wizard of Oz was made, okay.

[09:38] First movie ever, our first pinball game ever to include a full color screen clips from movies,

[09:44] first time ever, okay. And then Jersey Jack did it again with the Hobbit. And I think it's safe to say

[09:49] the Hobbit has almost the whole entire movie, right? In the pinball game. Okay. Then Jersey Jack is

[09:57] a ton of criticism for Pirates of the Caribbean. And by the way, I was upset too because after you see

[10:02] two games that essentially have a whole movie and then you see this one, which has very little,

[10:07] he took a lot of heat for that. Okay. And then he comes back with Willy Wonka. No, it doesn't have

[10:13] as many movie clips in it because I've seen the whole game all the way through as Wizard of Oz

[10:19] or the Hobbits. But why is it that Jersey Jack is hammered? Okay. Over the head. When Deadpool came

[10:27] out, I thought it was going to be based on the movie. Okay. Because nobody would have ever made a

[10:31] deadpool pinball game. So it wasn't for the movie. Nobody even knew who Deadpool was. And then it

[10:36] is not. It's like some cartoon. And then Jurassic Park comes out. There's not a movie clip anywhere.

[10:42] Why is it that the company that is actually trying to innovate pinball and has tried everything

[10:50] to make unique games and push the envelope? Okay. It gets criticized ten times more because Jurassic

[10:57] Park doesn't have so much as a freaking scratch and image. Nothing. It has nothing associated.

[11:04] And I even post it and I said, why did Stern even do Jurassic Park? Why didn't you just do your own

[11:09] original dinosaur thing game? Because it has nothing to do with the movie. Nothing. And they don't get

[11:14] run over the Coles. I mean, you're running Jersey Jack pinball over the Coles for actually having

[11:19] movie clips just not having enough. With Jurassic Park has none. Deadpool has none. Yeah, but

[11:24] your posters has none. But here's the thing, right? It's Stern comes out of the gate and just tells you

[11:30] straight up, this is Deadpool based on the comics. This is a Jurassic Park not based on the movie.

[11:35] They just tell us. So the expectation of what you're going to get in the game is set. What's

[11:39] frustrating about Jack? And it's still frustrating. And you still didn't get an answer for me.

[11:45] Is do you or do you not have the rights to use the clips? And it's frustrating because you see one

[11:49] clip in the game and then we don't see it anywhere else synced up. And that's it's almost more

[11:53] frustrating to go halfway. I'd rather it be one or the other. And that's I think a lot of people

[11:58] agree, Larry. If you love the movie, Willy Wonka, this game does not feel like you're going through

[12:05] the chocolate factory. It doesn't. Right. So let me let me address that for you. Okay. And from

[12:11] I don't want people to understand something about me. Okay. I might have a friend, his name is

[12:17] Dominic. He's one of the best pinball players in the world. And I watch him play pinball. And I'm

[12:23] just like, how the hell does he do that? You know, it's like you can't really fully appreciate

[12:28] Willy Wonka unless you watch somebody like him play the game. Then you start going,

[12:32] ah, okay, I get it. Maybe one day I'll get that good. Is that it? Let me just stop there because

[12:37] then if you make a game where so much of it is buried and only the greatest of players will get to

[12:44] it, do you think that's working against them? Well, I've actually told Jersey Jack pinball. And

[12:51] actually I talked to Eric. That's a whole other conversation, but I was going to tell you about

[12:55] myself. So people understood me better. But I talked to Eric, the guy who did Pirates of the

[13:00] Caribbean. And I told him flat out, I was like, you know, your game is awesome. I think everybody can

[13:07] agree. It's the greatest pinball game ever made. I mean, there just isn't one better when you think

[13:11] of everything that's been put into it. And, but I was like, you know, why don't you have like

[13:17] scenes like with the Pirates walking under the ship from the first movie. So you couldn't use

[13:21] Johnny Depp because I heard that he wanted something like a quarter million dollars for each film

[13:26] or something. And that's not realistic. So they didn't have all the movie clips, but you could use

[13:30] the CGI Pirates like, you know, several times they were attacking people, they were under the ship.

[13:35] Why didn't you use all that? He says, well, no, we did use it. It's buried, you know, it's not

[13:39] even say buried, but he said, you know, it's further along in the game. And I go, well, you do

[13:43] realize 99% of the people play pinball, you know, can't get that far. Okay. They want to, if we

[13:49] don't want to see two minutes into the game, a hand going in a box turning, you know, a lock. I

[13:55] mean, we don't want to see that. We want to see the pirate. We want to see the zombie shards.

[13:59] And Larry, it's something that, so I understand that. Well, this is why I think Lyman Sheets is the

[14:04] greatest coder on the planet because he knows how to code a game in which even if you're just a

[14:09] casual player, you'll get to stuff and you'll see a lot of what he has in the game. And a game,

[14:15] I don't think a game should be impossible to get to the ending. It should be hard to maybe score

[14:20] higher or get, you know, stack things, be harder to get to maybe final wizard modes. But the majority

[14:26] of the of the game should be able to be experienced by a mediocre player. And I think sometimes these

[14:30] games are too hard. Now, Larry, tell us about what about yourself. Do you want the listener to know?

[14:35] Well, you know, it's like, I keep getting so for full disclosure, you know, I go to the same

[14:43] trade shows that Jack does. I build a amusement attractions all over the world. And I built a

[14:48] amusement attractions based on Spider-Man, Incredible Hawk, Garfield Bacat, James Bond. I mean,

[14:55] you wouldn't even believe all this stuff I've done. I've done an amazing attraction in Tombstone,

[14:58] Arizona, and the same place where Wyatt Erbs, I think is Wyatt Erbs, is a brother was shot and

[15:06] killed on a pool table. I mean, I've been all over the world. And so I build amusement attractions.

[15:11] I actually went to Jack and I said, hey, you know, I'm not interested in selling, you know,

[15:15] pinball games to, you know, people on the pin side. But you know, I wouldn't mind like if I build

[15:22] a family fun center, you know, because family, as a thing, you don't people don't understand.

[15:26] Family fun centers do not have pinball games. They just don't. And that's a market that needs to

[15:31] be really explored and pushed hard. And I said, you know, I wouldn't mind, you know, trying to

[15:37] convince somebody that buys a mini golf for me to take some pinball games. And fortunately, I've

[15:44] already been lucky enough to sell a couple of lollipopers to some new bowling centers that are

[15:49] opening that we're building laser tags for and stuff. And so my background and my interest in

[15:55] Jersey Jack is I just, I am a person that has built rides for Marvel comics. I love detail. I

[16:04] love Disney. Okay, I love Universal Studios. I love amazing things that those are kinds of things

[16:11] that like excite me. And Jersey Jack pinball games excite me. Okay, because the attention to detail

[16:18] is second to to no one. I mean, no one has that kind of detail. When I first got into buying

[16:24] pinballs, it was back when you could buy a pinball game for $900. Let me ask you a question. Let me

[16:28] stop you there. What is the most magical thing in Willy Wonka? The most magical thing about Willy Wonka

[16:36] in my opinion is Willy Wonka itself. Because when I've seen the movie dozens of times, it makes you

[16:43] smile. Okay, and this game makes you smile from a from a mechanical pinball. Make you feel young again,

[16:49] actually, from a mechanical standpoint, though, you talk about innovation. What is innovative on that

[16:54] play field? Well, in terms of like, you know, what's innovative about the game? I mean, there's

[17:03] some cool things that we've never seen before. You know, obviously like the Wonka Vader,

[17:08] you know, having a multi ball sitting above the play field is kind of different.

[17:13] Just innovative to you. Well, a vertical kick and a lock. No, I don't think that the Willy Wonka game

[17:21] is like innovative in the way that like Pirates of the Caribbean is. Okay. The theme itself makes

[17:28] you feel like a kid again. But ultimately, I think what is innovative about Willy Wonka is that

[17:34] when you look at like rock games like ACDC or Metallica or even Black Knight,

[17:41] Thumping, Rock music, this is a departure. And to me, the theme itself is what's innovative because

[17:48] it's a game that makes you feel like a kid. And you know what else I think? This is a game,

[17:53] in my opinion, that could break into the Family Fund Center business because one of the most popular

[17:59] selling games in the world right now is a Willy Wonka redemption. Okay. This game looks like it

[18:04] fits right in with that. Okay. And I think that is in itself the beautiful play field. And by the

[18:12] way, it has amazing shots. Okay. It's a real pinball players game. I think it's the best Jersey

[18:18] Jack pinball game that's ever been made in terms of a pinball game. Again, that you could literally

[18:24] say this can go in tournaments right next to, you know, Stern's Metallica. You know, that's the kind

[18:33] of game it is. And it has a real deep rule set and it's an magical game. And you know, I will tell

[18:38] you also when it comes to the clips, I want to get back to the clips, as a collector, a pinball

[18:46] collector, I don't want to see, you know, almost anybody could probably take a movie and just flood

[18:51] the screen with movie clips. Okay. And I think in a large part, that's exactly what was done with

[18:58] the Hobbit. Okay. But I like the fact that they probably took six months. And by the way, for people

[19:04] who don't know, I make a lot of CGI effects with made 500, 600 of them. I could actually do

[19:10] the CG fact screens for American pinball all day. Okay. Or spooky or whoever. But Jersey Jack,

[19:18] the guy that they have doing that, I'm telling you from somebody who knows CGI effects, that dude

[19:22] is on another level. He's like on a Hollywood movie level. And I have to tell you, I would rather see

[19:29] their standard screen with Oampalumph is running around in swirls of candy. Or when you put your name

[19:35] in and the chocolate thing, sprays the chocolate down. This guy who's doing this stuff for Jersey

[19:40] Jack, it's amazing. And it breaks up movie clips. I don't want to say the movie. People who love, by

[19:46] people who love the movie, want to see the movie come through in the game. Like they want to see the

[19:52] iconic scenes from the film. And they want to feel like they're in those scenes. You don't get

[19:57] that sense when you play the game. Let me tell you this. Let me tell you this. Okay. The screen that

[20:02] they have on the back glass, that is the factory. That is their futuristic Willy Wonka factory.

[20:09] Reimagined. Okay. So right there, reimagined. Why are they reimagining a classic?

[20:14] Well, I'll tell you why. For example, one of the clips that shown over and over and over again in

[20:19] the game is like when the Wank, the, the govstopper pops out and you can see the cloth like over spring.

[20:27] And you know, it's just like, it's dated. It's 1970 something. Okay. If they remade the movie, it

[20:33] wouldn't look like that. It's not your saying that the clips would look dated. Well, some of the clips,

[20:38] when you go back and watch that movie, if you were remake that movie, and I'm not talking about

[20:43] the way that Johnny Depp movie was, which I like that movie, but it's more advanced, right?

[20:49] Because CGI has come a long way since 1970. But was the boss as a movie? Those clips look great.

[20:56] That's correct. Yeah. That is correct. That man 66 is older. Those are great.

[21:01] Well, when you watch Batman 66, by the way, I'm a huge fan of Batman 66, but when you watch that,

[21:07] when you watch those movie sets, or the, the film sets and whatnot, I mean, come on. You can tell

[21:12] they're very dated, but I'm just trying to, I'm trying to follow the logic here because my logic is

[21:17] this. If, if I love the Willy Wonka movie, and I hop on the pinball machine and I want to play

[21:23] through the iconic scenes I love in the film, I'm just not going to get it. And which is okay.

[21:28] But I just wish they would just say to us, it's just weird because it's like, why have all these clips?

[21:34] And, and yet it's like them, it's not mode based. Like, don't you think that was a mistake? Not

[21:39] to make a mode based pinball machine where the movie itself lent itself perfectly to a mode based

[21:44] experience? Well, you know, I can, I think I can address that too because like, when you look at a

[21:49] game like the Hobbit, okay, they had three films there, parts of Caribbean, there was five films.

[21:55] Batman 66 had three seasons. You know, we're talking about Willy Wonka one-off movie. Okay, we're

[22:01] not talking about Jurassic Park had whether on movie number six or something. We're talking about a

[22:06] one-off movie that was made in the 70s. Okay. So you're saying there's not enough content to do

[22:11] mode based? Well, I'm saying, is that what you're saying? You know, it's an hour and 30-minute movie.

[22:17] Right. That's what it is. Okay. But it's also a movie that is magical to many people. And I think

[22:25] that what Jersey Jack tries to do is they're not trying to be the company that just pumps out three

[22:31] pinball games a year. They're trying to be the company that's trying to bring magic. Okay,

[22:37] to the playing experience. And when you play Willy Wonka and the ball hits us and this sound

[22:41] effect goes off and that one and this one and this one. And then you hear Oompa Loompos. I think

[22:46] that they have to create some of that magic themselves and they did. And I believe that they did

[22:53] 100%. It's what it is. It's Willy Wonka. It's an hour and 30-minute movie that was made over 30 years

[22:59] ago. Right. But how easy? Actually, I'm about 40 years old. When I get on a Willy Wonka machine,

[23:04] the first thing I want to do is the first part of the game I want to be finding the five gold

[23:11] and tickets for the five kids. Like, how easy is that? And then then you move on to the next stage,

[23:19] which is then you're at the chocolate factory. And then you go through each room and each kids

[23:23] got their own mode in which you're progressing through those. It's so, you know, it makes me so

[23:28] mad, Larry. It's so simply in front of them. How do you not design the game to work like that?

[23:35] Unless, unless this is the thing, Larry, they didn't have the rights to use any of those clips

[23:40] and they went in a different direction, which I would be okay with if they would just say it to us.

[23:45] But they spin it. Even when you ask Jack, he goes, oh, maybe down the road. We might, no, Jack,

[23:50] it's a yes or no question. And Larry, you didn't ask him the question. Do they have the rights or not?

[23:56] Well, you know, with anything, when you go to somebody and you say, hey, do you have the rights to do

[24:02] this? You have the rights to do that. You know, these companies have, you know, legal binding agreements.

[24:08] Oh, come on. That's a crock. That's your, that's not a crack. I've actually done, I've actually done

[24:12] a lot with people where they make you sign, you know, non-disclosure.

[24:15] Larry, come on.

[24:17] Larry, come on.

[24:17] Brothers is not going to sue them for just saying, hey, we don't have, they said they didn't have him

[24:21] for pirates. They didn't get what, what, what, what did they break the NDA? I don't buy it. I don't buy it.

[24:25] No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not making that excuse. I'm not saying he said that to me. What I'm saying

[24:30] is, you know, when I ask him a question, you know, you, you can't like expect somebody to like,

[24:35] be honest. No, it's not about being honest. It's like, you don't know what, you know, what they

[24:40] agree to, what they know. And sometimes like you keep things in the, in the back, you know, like

[24:45] because you're going to add new code and you're going to put more clips on. Yeah, but you know what,

[24:50] I think the ship is sailed as on this like this promise that it might happen one day, especially

[24:54] when Joe Katz told everybody what you see is what you get. Well, look at the habit. They just,

[25:00] you put a huge update out on the habit, like not even a year ago and added tons more clips.

[25:05] They just put a wizard of ours update out just like a couple days. So then tell us clips are coming

[25:11] with what? Yeah. Why not just say it? Yeah, you know, and I would say, hey, when's the clips coming

[25:16] on for Jurassic Park? Where do they come for? You know, it's like, hey, you know what? I don't want to see

[25:21] a, by the way, I don't want to see, well, I want to tell you something. I don't want to see a

[25:25] Tron vault. Okay. And make that same game again. You know what I'd like to see Stern do? Because by the

[25:30] way, I'm not against Stern. I like Stern. But you know, I like see Stern do. I'd like say, hey,

[25:34] we're going to do a Tron vault or a Spider-Man vault. And we're going to put a big screen in it.

[25:38] And we're going to put movie clips in it. You know, actually, it's really cool for people on the

[25:43] pinball world to sit around and dream of these things. But when you try to license jaws, okay,

[25:49] the reason why there ain't no clips on Jurassic Park's. Because Steven Spielberg isn't ever going to

[25:53] let any pinball company use clips of his movies. That's why you'll never see jaws with clips. If

[26:00] there's a jaws movie, you're going to see animation like Jurassic Park. There's no, it's not that easy.

[26:05] Look Larry, there's no clips in Lord of the Rings pinball. It is one of the greatest pinball

[26:09] games ever. It puts me in the scenes of that movie perfectly, right? Half of it is physical stuff

[26:15] on the play field. The other half are the modes. They bring you back to those scenes and they have

[26:20] the callouts from the actors. Look, you don't need a big screen. This notion, I get that they have

[26:24] the screen there, Jersey Jack. But my whole point is this. If you're going to put a 27 inch screen

[26:28] there and then then give me movie clips. Like, yeah, I, and let me tell you like on Pirates of the

[26:36] Caribbean, you know, I was obviously disappointed because I'm a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[26:40] Let me tell you, I think it's one of the greatest movie franchises ever. Okay. And, you know,

[26:46] obviously they tried to get movie clips with Johnny Depp. But dude, when you got Jerry Buckheimer,

[26:52] okay, he's one of the biggest producers in the history of movies. Dude, you got to go through

[26:57] Jerry Buckheimer. You don't go to Disney. You got to go through a lot of time. Whatever his name is,

[27:03] you got to go through a minefield to get those clips. But then why make the game? Well, that's

[27:08] funny because I actually said the same thing. Why make the game if your whole company has like

[27:15] rested on, you know, like the Hobbit and Wizard of Oz. Why do this game if you can't use a clips?

[27:20] It's a mystery to me too. But guess what? The stuff that that guy made on the screen makes up for

[27:26] it 10 fold. When you look at Pirates of the Caribbean, they're, tell me one game in the history of pinball.

[27:32] And I'm talking about the history of pinball. Okay. Other than Jersey Jack that has a screen full

[27:38] of wonderful things happening as good as Pirates of the Caribbean. I'm waiting. There is a one. Batman 66.

[27:44] Batman 66 is not the same level as Pirates of the Caribbean. Not even as good. It's better. No, it's not.

[27:50] I'll tell you why it's better. It's and I'm a fan of Batman. It's simpler. And it gives me what I want

[27:56] as a fan of that franchise. It gives me exactly what I want. When I, you know, if I'm a fan of

[28:02] Pirates of the Caribbean, right? I'm not getting what I want on that screen. I'm getting what they're

[28:07] giving me all that they could. And I get it. It's, it's, I get that they did that. They made the most

[28:11] of what they had to work with. But if I'm a fan, I want to see Johnny Depp and all his jokes and all

[28:16] the, all the sense of humor of that franchise is not in the game at all. There's no personality

[28:21] that comes from that movie that comes alive in the game. I get that it's a great pinball.

[28:25] It's a good point for you. Okay. I agree with you. Okay. However, you know, I, uh,

[28:32] saw Gary Stern at the IOP show a couple years ago. And you know me, dude, I'm not afraid to ask

[28:39] anybody anything. I just walked right through. You're afraid to ask Jack if he had the, the, the,

[28:42] the right to use the assets, but go on. Okay. So I walked right up to Gary Stern and I said, Gary,

[28:49] can I answer your question? It's just like, I'm just curious. Okay. Why is, why isn't the greatest

[28:55] Errol Smith song in their entire history? Their most iconic song. And if you go to ranker.com,

[29:01] it's the number one rated song. Why isn't it in the game? Why would you do an Errol Smith pinball

[29:06] and not put in their best song ever? And you know what's the sponsor? What's the song? What's the song?

[29:13] Dream on. Right. Okay. And, and I said, I asked him this question because if you ask me, Errol Smith

[29:20] is not a good pinball game because it doesn't have the best eight Errol Smith songs. Like, what the

[29:26] hell is a, whatever in a box, our closet or whatever. Like, I never even heard this song. Okay.

[29:32] But anyway, I asked him this question. He says, well, that would have added another hundred,

[29:36] they wanted another hundred and fifty dollars or two hundred dollars per machine for that one song.

[29:41] So we skipped it. I'm like, you skipped the best Errol song. Errol Smith song because it would

[29:46] have cost you a little bit more money. And Jersey Jack's case, I asked him point blank, where's

[29:51] Johnny Depp? They said Johnny Depp's people wanted, I think he told me two hundred and fifty

[29:56] or five hundred thousand dollars per movie to use his face. Okay. In the clips. So that's why you

[30:02] didn't get Dream on for a hundred and fifty bucks. But you didn't get Johnny Depp in pirates for

[30:09] a half a million dollars. Okay. Big difference. Half a million, a hundred and fifty dollars. Right.

[30:13] But let's say, let's play the math out. So if you sell a thousand pinball machines and let's say he's

[30:19] two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the first movie clips, you know, it's only two

[30:23] hundred and fifty bucks a game added on. So there might be a point in which you'll sell

[30:29] thousands more if you have those clips and if you bring the movie to life more. I mean, how much

[30:34] do you know what theme song? They didn't even buy the theme song. Well, you know, it's funny about

[30:38] parts of the Caribbean is I think that it took so much beating on pinside and you know, and whatever.

[30:45] I mean, it did it took up beating. And then people slowly started realizing, wait a minute, wait a

[30:49] minute. This game might be the best game that's ever been produced. And then all of a sudden,

[30:54] Jersey Jack pulled the plug on it and they pulled the plug on it. I think for a lot of different

[30:58] reasons, but they pulled the plug on it. And then all of a sudden people went panic mode and everybody

[31:03] wanted one. Okay. Now it's the most sought after game. I mean, it literally has to be one of the

[31:09] top five games everybody's chasing down now. Okay. Well, it's starting. Obviously people didn't care

[31:14] that much about not seeing Johnny Depp because everybody wants a game and I see people trying to

[31:18] sell the game from $14,000. So the demand is softening a little bit because of the soft clear code.

[31:25] Let's talk about that now because that was the other thing you were going to talk to Jack about.

[31:28] I think we I think we agreed to disagree on Willie Wonka and I think the buyers will make up their

[31:33] own mind on that game. So let's talk about the clear code issue because this is really a dark

[31:38] cloud over JJP right now. What did he say when you asked him about that? Well, first off, let's

[31:45] clarify. People are criticizing Stern and Jersey Jack. It's just Jersey Jack. It's 90% of criticism

[31:51] on Pinside. Let's start there. So the bottom line is that, you know, I asked him about that

[31:59] question. Okay. And he referred me to a podcast that he did, which I posted on Pinside and people

[32:08] transcribed. And let me just unwrap that. I just you know that I just air that podcast. It is

[32:14] 13 minutes of Gobley Gook. And he's spinning. He's not he's it's like it's just like a holding

[32:22] statement. Absolutely. They have not told us there is a problem and they haven't told us what the

[32:27] solution is. He still hasn't said that. Okay. Well, you know what my you know what I would say is

[32:33] and and I'm not trying to be like a defender of any one particular pinball company. And as you

[32:40] already know, like we could talk about black night and we could talk about why is that? Stay on top.

[32:46] No, I am. I am over the topic. But I already want to start talking about black night. Why? No,

[32:51] no, no, I don't want to talk about black night. I'm making a point. Okay. What you're going to get

[32:55] to my point is that we could talk about all kinds of things. And like what I was saying was like

[33:00] how is black night worth $9,000 or Beatles were $25,000 or why is a Jersey Jack pinball game worth $15,000

[33:10] or big Lebowski this or whatever you could talk about issues all day long. And everybody's going

[33:15] to have a different opinion. Okay. But my my my point is like great. He just want to hear the

[33:20] soft little idea. Okay. It's very simple. It's very simple. In this pinside world, you have people

[33:26] who have different opinions about everything. But there's only one thing that is a fact that if you

[33:32] have a problem with your brand new car, your brand new toaster, your brand new TV, your brand new

[33:37] pinball, you're not going to solve it on a message board. You're going to solve it by going to the

[33:42] manufacturer and talking to them. And what Jack said very clearly in his podcast was if you have a

[33:48] problem and you have pictures and you can document this and you can come to any set even said you

[33:53] could call me directly. He did say that. And he goes and we will figure out a solution for you.

[33:59] Okay. You can't just sit out there as a business. Okay. And go, oh yeah. 90% of the pictures that I've

[34:08] seen whether it was prior to the Caribbean or walk or anything is pictures of people saying this

[34:13] is what's going to happen. Not something that did happen. It's what they think is going to happen.

[34:19] So how is it? I just agree. I've seen a bunch of. I've seen a bunch of photos with chip to clear code.

[34:25] Yeah. And you know what? In every single case, these people take the post off and who knows if they

[34:29] drove a screwdriver over it? I don't know. Okay. All I do know is if you really do have a problem.

[34:35] And by the way, every pinball company has made pinball games that were lemons, including Jersey

[34:41] Jack. Okay. Let's go back to the very first wizard of us. He had all kinds of problems.

[34:45] Right. Well, here's a problem. Here's the thing. Do you think that someone who buys a brand new game

[34:52] opens it up and the play field chips within a month? What? What is what is a what is a solve for that

[34:58] person? Right now the solve that we've heard of is they're giving you an opportunity to buy a

[35:04] replacement play field? How's that a solution to a person's game? They need to do a play field swap.

[35:11] Which a person can't do, especially in a complex game like a Jersey Jack game. So that people are

[35:16] asking for fully populated play fields with better clear code. Now here's the thing Larry.

[35:23] They haven't you may answer that question. Well, they answer that. But yeah. And then also like I

[35:27] don't even think they've solved the clear code issue, which no one wants to talk about directly.

[35:33] Okay. Well, I just so you know, okay. What I think is very clear. I think that

[35:41] some people might have they might be looking at these posts. They might be seeing some pooling

[35:46] or whatever. Okay. First stuff the ball can't hit the pooling. Okay. That's that is you know,

[35:53] mathematically impossible. But the bottom line is what we see a lot of people doing is taking

[35:59] these games apart. Okay. And showing you where they think a problem might happen. And yes,

[36:04] some people have had a problem. And if I had a problem, I'll tell you how I would handle it.

[36:09] I would get on the phone. I would call that manufacturer. And I would tell them exactly what I

[36:15] wanted done about it. Okay. Now I do know what it would take to do a play field swap on pirate

[36:21] to the Caribbean. I bought cliffies just because of all the people, you know, talking about pirates

[36:26] of Caribbean, I bought cliffies. And then when I actually tried to look at how to put them on,

[36:30] I was like, there's no way in hell I'm doing that. I don't know how to take all this stuff apart.

[36:33] There was no way to get the cliffies on without taking the boat off this off. And there's no way

[36:38] I'm doing that. So I totally sympathize. I don't want to have a pinball manufacturer tell me,

[36:44] oh yeah, here's you a new play field. Take your whole game apart and put it. I mean, how

[36:48] could most people do that? You can't. At the end of the day, if somebody has a legitimate problem,

[36:53] they should call Jersey Jack Pinball. They should raise some hell. Okay. And they should expect to get

[37:00] a positive resolution. That is what would you want as a resolution if it happened to your game?

[37:07] Well, I can tell you this that in some people's case, they might just want a new play field.

[37:13] And what would you want? Well, I mean, at the very least, I would want a new play field.

[37:19] Okay. For free. Yeah. I want it for free. Okay. And that's what I would expect. I wouldn't expect

[37:26] somebody to tell me, hey, we'll give it to you for 50% off. Okay. No, I would expect a free one.

[37:31] But that's only if you have to understand, okay, that I could document exactly what happened

[37:39] and illustrate to them clearly how this happened, why it happened. Okay. There's a difference like,

[37:45] look, people put mods on games. Okay. And I've done this. You drop a screwdriver right on the

[37:50] damn play field. You drop this. You drop that. Okay. People actually, you know this better than

[37:56] anybody all over the world. There's people in the United States that want to blame other people

[38:01] for their problems. I'm not saying that's the case here, but I'm saying some cases, you do damage to

[38:07] your own equipment, machine, car, whatever. And then of course you want some people want the

[38:13] manufactured of pay for it and say, well, I didn't do that. Okay. But people do put mods on games.

[38:19] Okay. People do work on their machines. They replace the rubbers. You know, look at Jersey Jack

[38:25] Games. Cool. Yeah. But no one can like mistakenly create pooling and puddling.

[38:31] You're right. They can. You're I agree. And my walka, I'm not going to lie. We look at it real close

[38:36] and we see a little bit of pooling around one of the posts. Okay. All right. Guess what? It's not

[38:42] cracking. It's not busing off. And by the way, why do I need to remove the post to see if it will?

[38:48] My friend, I have a friend that has 6,000 plays on his parts to care being. His game doesn't have a

[38:54] chip or anything. Okay. Now if we take a magnifying glass, we might find some pooling just because you

[39:00] have some pooling doesn't mean it's going to crack. Okay. Well, my point is 90% of the complaints and

[39:05] you can't deny this are people saying they see pooling and they think it's going to chip. It didn't

[39:12] chip. Play the game. Have fun with it. If it does chip, call Jersey Jack and demand a new playfield.

[39:19] And by the way, I think if you were selling your parts to the carabee into somebody and you had a

[39:23] chip in it on the play field, but Jersey Jack supplied you a new playfield, I don't think I think

[39:28] people would feel good about that because they're like, yeah, I could beat the shit out of this game

[39:32] and I'll always have a brand new playfield. I think a lot of people would like that. Yeah, I mean,

[39:36] I mean, I feel like people, people, people never, ever do playfield swaps and it's just like

[39:41] peace of mind to have the playfield for people. But he, but look, the issue though, the real issue

[39:49] is not Jersey Jack's problem. It's whoever is supplying his playfield, which we know is Mirko

[39:56] is really putting his entire company in jeopardy of, of lost sales. People are not, people are hesitant

[40:04] to buy the games now. Both Stern and Jersey Jack, it's just going to affect Jack more because they,

[40:10] they failed to identify and correct the problem after they saw it on pirates. And I think that's

[40:15] why people are so mad right now. Not mad, but just like, just holding out because they said,

[40:20] hey, look, you knew you had this problem because it is a problem. We heard from people, Larry,

[40:25] who work in the industry of clear coding that it's too soft and something happened in the mix. And

[40:31] it's not, it's not the right formula for a pinball clear code. And they haven't fixed it yet. And

[40:37] that's my problem, Larry, is like, they're still mailing games out now with a letter. Did you see

[40:42] that? It's the same exact wording that Stern put out for dimpling and it's all bogus spin.

[40:48] It doesn't make me feel good as a buyer knowing that they don't really, they don't really want to

[40:53] put in writing that they're going to do anything for you. Well, you know, I, this is, this is what I

[40:59] think. Okay. And I think you would agree with me. When we think about Big Lebowski and aliens and

[41:05] predator and all and then magic girl and the list goes on and on and on and on. Where people screwed

[41:11] people, I think they all had good intentions and they just didn't understand how hard it was

[41:16] going to be. And when you think about Jack, he started his own company. He made Wizard of Oz. He

[41:23] had a dream. Very similar to the themes he likes to do, you know, dreaming, you know, big dreams,

[41:29] right? Willy Wonka, Wizard of Oz. And he had a dream to create a pinball company. And his

[41:34] pinball games, in my view, have pushed the envelope more than any other manufacturer since his first

[41:40] game. And he had a lot of problems with Wizard of Oz. And by the way, he lost, I would report it

[41:46] 80% of his company. He had to bring in a lot of big investors. And he stuck by those customers.

[41:52] And no, they weren't happy. And yes, he had to make a lot of, you know, like a lot of sacrifices

[41:58] to himself and to, you know, into his company. But he weathered through it. Think of all the companies

[42:04] that haven't been able to weather through the slightest problem. And he did. And he has tried to make

[42:10] the best pinball games possible. The man deserves a lot of credit. Okay.

[42:16] It feels like there's things like a political ad like this, this message was approved by the jack.

[42:20] It's not a political ad. It's a fact. Look, I agree with you, Jack. Everyone loves Jack. Let me,

[42:26] let me just state that like I love Jack. You love Jack. Everyone loves Jersey Jack pinball. They do

[42:32] the reason why they also make mistakes. Exactly. Here's the thing though. And you, you, you, you'll

[42:37] agree with this. Imagine if Jack hired both of us to help him make decisions. Wouldn't it be a much,

[42:43] wouldn't it be smoother sailing? Right? They need, right? I become a layer. You know, that's

[42:48] funny that you say that because I have said to him a few times. And you know, that I'd be willing to,

[42:56] you know, it's like I'll be honest with you. When I saw Eric at Chicago or Noah, Wisconsin,

[43:03] you know, the Midwest gaming classic, I said they're in talk to him for 30 minutes and told him

[43:07] everything I would have done different on parts of the Caribbean. He actually listened to me. He's

[43:11] like, well, you know, in some of it, he had made it like I didn't think of that. Oh yeah, that would

[43:14] have. Yeah. You know, I don't, and I told American pinball the same thing when they sat in my booth at

[43:19] IAPA last November, you really need somebody. Okay. To come in there and just make you cry. And when

[43:27] we, when we leave, you go, man, we hate those guys. And then three days later, you realize, you

[43:32] know what they were right. We need to change this. We need to change that. In every business, Larry,

[43:36] they bring in what are called consultants like the movie industry, like every industry has it.

[43:42] We should be the pinball consultants who come in and we, we basically do an analysis of what your

[43:49] plans are. And we give you either a green light or a red light and we help direct you towards

[43:54] profitability. You know, we, we, even like company, we hire, we hire lightwooders like Ernest and

[44:01] Young or whatever. There's all these like multi million dollar like consultants who come in and

[44:06] they help you solve your business challenges. Now look, he's never going to take us up on it.

[44:11] I've been trying to get Jack to listen to me and, you know, bring me a little bit behind the scenes.

[44:15] Not even sure I wanted to be honest because then I can't do my podcast objectively. But so, look,

[44:20] I do, Chris, let me just tell you this. Okay. Because you take a lot of heat probably more than anybody,

[44:25] right? You're a smart guy. Okay. People don't like, I found on Pinside. They don't like people who

[44:31] tell it straight. Okay. And sometimes you've been wrong and, and most of the time you're right.

[44:37] But, you know, people don't like people telling them what the reality is. Sometimes people like to,

[44:43] you know, like hope and dream that, you know, you're not right. Okay. Well, look, I think,

[44:48] and then I want to move on to another topic. But I think everyone does want to see Jersey Jack

[44:53] succeed. And I think this is going to be a hard one to get out of because people are going to,

[44:58] I think, demand stuff that they can't financially do in terms of like fully populated playfield and stuff

[45:04] like that. We'll see how they handle it. I think he's got more work to do. It was a little bit,

[45:09] I'm just going to say this. I think it was lame that Jack went to Pimball News and Pimball Magazine's

[45:14] podcast. Like, he went to a place that's just going to, you know, kiss his butt and do a softball

[45:22] introduction to his statement. That's not where Jack needs to go. He needs to be on this podcast,

[45:26] telling all my listeners who are his buyers, what he's going to do for them. And I, and he has

[45:32] an open invitation anytime to come on the show. He knows that. And I think you're going to share

[45:36] this podcast with him. And we do, we do love Jersey Jack Pimball. And, you know, I'd rather debate

[45:41] Willy Wonka on, you know, the code issues. That's fine. He knows that. We're allowed to,

[45:46] we're allowed to critique and criticize a final product. But, you know, this customer service

[45:52] issue is one that they're going to have to learn how to deal with it better. And hopefully they do.

[45:56] So speaking of, I can I say one, come into what you said. I actually would tell any manufacturer,

[46:07] whether it's Gary Stern or Jack or anybody. I don't really care who it is. They should come on

[46:14] your podcast. You know, it's really funny. If you, you're not talking about it, you know, but

[46:19] build the boss, you know, went on Hannity, right? It's not that bad. Okay. You're just going to,

[46:24] you might be having a difference of opinion. That's okay. But going on your show, I think is,

[46:30] would be fine. There's nothing wrong with it. Especially when you believe in your product. And

[46:34] I think Jersey Jack believes that. Jack's been on the show. You know, we were on when, when I was

[46:39] shown Wonka originally. And so yeah, I mean, I think it would be great. And so speaking of

[46:45] rare games though, I want to ask you a question because you also own a big Lebowski. Correct?

[46:50] Yep. Okay. Yes. How did you get yours? Like, were you on the list or did you hit Melissa up

[46:55] when you heard it was going to come back out? Well, for, you know, some people who don't know me,

[47:00] but people who do know me know, like, hey, you might be able to call Larry at five in the morning.

[47:05] And he might answer the phone. Okay. I'm a one man band. I'm doing multiple, multiple things.

[47:10] And by the way, we also have escape rooms. We run a house. We get Larry. You said, no, I know.

[47:15] I know. What are you saying? You're, you're sometimes a modern day Renaissance man. We know it. Okay.

[47:19] So what I'm saying is sometimes, sometimes I'm up 24 hours is what I'm saying because I got too

[47:24] many irons in the fire, right? Right. And so I just happened to be up. It was like five or six

[47:30] in the morning. Okay. And this thing just all of a sudden popped up. Okay. So I immediately called

[47:37] and they said, yeah, you'd be the last one to get it. And so I was literally the last one to get it.

[47:43] I just happened to be called them at five in the morning. Well, yeah, they're in Pennsylvania.

[47:48] Okay. I'm in the Midwest. So they were an hour ahead of me. So I called them. It would have been

[47:54] around seven and they didn't answer. And I saw I stayed up and I waited until I thought they'd

[47:59] answer the phone. I think they answered the phone seven thirty third time. So you got the last

[48:04] phone. What are you doing with it? I got the last one. Probably just keep it. You know, it's like,

[48:11] I bought it. And I said to some friends of mine, would you sell it for 25,000? Would somebody pay

[48:17] you 25,000 for it? And they said, absolutely, absolutely. And so I decided, you know, I'll throw it

[48:23] on the pin side. I'll leave it on in the box for three days. And if nobody overwhelms me with an

[48:28] offer, I'm just open in it. And I'm going to like enjoy it because I've wanted the game for

[48:34] over two years. Okay. So when I had an opportunity to get one, of course, I'm going to buy it. Okay.

[48:39] But if somebody's willing to pay me 25,000 for it, then yeah, you can have it.

[48:44] Is it listed for sale? Yeah, I put it up for sale. But I put it up there. I said, hey, it's for three

[48:50] days because I'm getting the temptation to just tear the box open. Right. When did you list it?

[48:55] A day ago. Okay. Now, when just sold, I actually talked to the person earlier today. We're going to

[49:03] air that interview probably before this one. So you'll have heard it by now listener. And he got,

[49:09] it sounds like he got north of 20. He didn't tell me the number. So I don't know. But he had,

[49:15] he had his listed for 25,000. And then there's that Bozo that's asking 45,000 for it.

[49:21] Or the guy that was asking 100 plus 1995. Yeah, he's that sure. Forget that one.

[49:26] Another me. The queue part was 1995. Yeah.

[49:31] It's funny when I put stuff on eBay and people, you know, you know, it is like people. People should just

[49:35] laugh. I don't know. They should think that's funny. That's funny. Look at you. And here we are arguing

[49:41] a couple of like wackos about pinball. And you know, we don't take this stuff personally. I think

[49:47] bulls-pulls. No, it's not. This stuff in proper context. Do you feel like you're an unethical

[49:52] vulture for buying one of these Lebowski's? Absolutely not. What, this is what should have happened

[49:59] with big Lebowski. And it didn't. Okay. People have known about this lawsuit going on for,

[50:04] you know, months and months and months. Unfortunately, what somebody needed to do was take the bull by the horns,

[50:10] get everybody that was owed money higher in attorney, get involved in that bankruptcy.

[50:17] Thing to be listed as a creditor. Nobody did that. Okay. So the person that did have the,

[50:22] you know, the lawsuit ended up with all the assets. They're not going to give them to those people.

[50:27] It sucks. I admit it. It sucks. But you're not going to do that. That is the way this world works.

[50:33] And we've all been to auctions and we've all tried to take advantage of trying to get things

[50:38] cheaper. Okay. Things that we need for our business. If you're a business owner, you've been to

[50:42] auctions. And in every case, it's unfortunately somebody didn't make it more or less. Right.

[50:49] And so this is a legal situation. All of those people that had money in on this should have,

[50:56] you know, created kind of like, hey, let's take all 40 of us and put in $1,500 to get in on the

[51:03] legal proceedings. And they would have been an owner of those assets along with those other

[51:09] creditors. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. And, and I feel bad for them. The upside is, I did

[51:16] talk to Melissa several times. She really believes they're going to make 40 more. And she said that when

[51:21] they make the 40, they're going to try to get them to the people who had the money down. Okay. I don't

[51:26] know what that means because it's none of my business. Okay. Just like you, you know, you got to focus

[51:31] on what you got to do. Nobody on Pinsides going to pay your own. Yeah. I don't know how they're going

[51:35] to do that. I mean, unless they give people a chance to buy the game again, which is like, well, I

[51:41] want them. I want them to do the right thing. Of course, everybody does. And I hope that they do

[51:46] go back to the 40 people or whatever they had the money and try to work something out with those

[51:50] people. That would be the right thing to do. But these particular assets, they became the property

[51:57] of a creditor. Okay. And they liquidated those assets. Okay. And I was fortunate enough to get one.

[52:06] And I bought it. Is it a creditor or was it a Ra? I don't, you know, of course, I haven't studied

[52:10] the lawsuit, but I know a lot about, you know, lawsuits in general. When you run a business for,

[52:16] you know, 30 years, you learn about all kinds of stuff. Workers comp, you won't talk about.

[52:22] Larry, what, what, what, what don't you know about?

[52:27] What don't I know about what? No, just in life. Well, I can tell you this, the dumbest,

[52:34] the dumbest question you could ever ask is the one you don't ask. And I was just talking to a

[52:40] division, because I coached a division one baseball team. And, you know, we, I'm not with not a

[52:44] division one baseball team, but I coached a team where about nine my players ended up in division

[52:49] one baseball. And I didn't know a whole lot about that, but I learned from asking division one coaches,

[52:55] hey, can you answer this question that question? And I had one tell me the other day, man,

[52:58] you asked a lot of questions. I'm like, well, how do you learn if you don't ask questions?

[53:02] Yeah, the first question someone should have asked was, will anyone buy an October fest pinball?

[53:08] No. You know, I actually talked to him at IAPA, and I told him that, you know, and this is thinking

[53:15] more along the lines of Canada here. I said, you know, if you, I mean, you already dead set on

[53:22] building this thing, I said, man, I'd go all out with it. I put a, a real keg topper on it with a

[53:28] poor and a beer stein and they should, they should, they should, you're making the ultimate man cave

[53:34] pinball. And then I would hire a PR firm. And I would try to get free press that, hey, the ultimate

[53:39] man cave pinball games been made, you know, not try to market to pinball. What they should have done.

[53:45] And what do I know about marketing, but they should have contacted like ABN Bev or Miller Cores

[53:50] and said, hey, look, we've got this thing. It's at the finish line. Let's, let's put your brand into

[53:56] this and then incorporate the products somehow. Like you can hook up, you know, you can pour beer into

[54:02] it and it actually dispenses in the game. Like they would have got, and they would have sold, they

[54:07] would have sold a thousand probably internally to those companies alone for the size of those

[54:13] companies. And those companies would have put them everywhere and they have the distribution to

[54:17] make it happen. But let's just let's not do that. Let's not do that. Here's the thing though. They

[54:22] still could. Okay. And they made a game that I think should be like a viral thing. And they should

[54:29] add a big real keg on it and the whole nine yards and say it's the ultimate man cave pinball game.

[54:36] And you know, they still could. Okay. But now they're on to theme number three. Hopefully it's a

[54:43] license game and it's not Sherlock Holmes because I don't know anybody that wants to Sherlock Holmes

[54:47] pinball game. And I'm worried about whatever the theme is. I just think it's going to be that or

[54:53] Robin Hood. Robin Hood, every Robin Hood movie is a total disaster. No, not the Kevin Gossner.

[55:00] Kevin Gossner what? Everything I do. I do. It only made a, it wasn't a hit compared to

[55:05] like his other hints. No, only the song was a hit. The song was a hit. You're right.

[55:11] Well, Larry, look, I want to thank you for coming on. Yeah, you gave some good answers. We didn't

[55:16] get directly the answers from Jack, but that's okay. I understand that he has to sort of have a

[55:22] little bit of a distance from the fan base that's going crazy right now. So, you know, I just think

[55:29] this thing is going to get worked out. Hopefully to to Jack's advantage and he gets to retain all

[55:37] of the customers who do love his products. I mean, I think sometimes we do get a little negative

[55:41] on the show, but that's only because we we have high hopes for Jack. I don't think people have

[55:47] as high hopes for stern machines. And that's why they, you know what I'm saying? It's like stern

[55:51] comes in with the homework assignment and gets a C every time when you're, you know, and then they

[55:55] give us another C on the test. We're not like beating them over the head because we know they're not

[55:59] aiming for the stars with their games. They're not. And I think Jack gets a lot more of the arrows

[56:04] because we just expect more because they're trying harder. And they always, I don't always say this.

[56:11] They always find new ways to make it a little bit frustrating like why couldn't they just make it

[56:15] mode based and make give me the movie I love you know, there's always those little things they do

[56:18] that make me scratch my head. And that's why Jack should hire you and me Larry.

[56:22] Well, I appreciate you saying that the truth that they're trying harder. Okay. And you know, I was just

[56:28] talking to a friend of mine the other day and we had to, we pulled a like a a stern or Jersey Jack

[56:37] game. We pulled it up. You know, you could disconnect that game, set it on the ground. You can't do

[56:41] that with a stern. You can't do it. And you know, and everything you can't lift up a playfield on

[56:45] a stern. All the balls will fly out on a Jersey Jack. You can because it's got a little flap that

[56:49] comes down. And I just wonder to myself, okay, why does the company that is literally trying? Okay,

[56:55] they have a phono connector on the outside. You can plug in your, they don't, they have cameras.

[57:00] They have all these things. You could literally, like I said, take the playfield out and set it

[57:05] on the ground. If you take a Jersey or if you take a stern playfield out, you're like, oh,

[57:09] no, what do I do with it? Is my, okay, my batman playfield fell into the cabinet and it's, yeah,

[57:14] it was like, it was terrifying. And there's nothing keeping it on that rail. It's exactly

[57:20] crappiest. It's like gravity. I have a question for you. I have a question for you. Maybe you can

[57:24] answer it. Okay. When Jersey Jack is trying their hardest to make the best on screen, the best

[57:31] under the class, the, the best little, little knickbacks, like the little thing you lift up your

[57:36] playfield and the balls don't fall out. And Stern doesn't do any of these things. In fact,

[57:40] when Wizard of Oz was made, what Stern made another, like what, eight, nine games where they still

[57:45] didn't convert over to a color screen, why is it? And by the way, I love Stern. But why is it that

[57:51] Jersey Jack gets 99% of all the bashing? Okay. Why is that? The company that's trying to push

[57:58] the envelope and they get bashed 99% of time and you bring up deep root all the time. I wonder,

[58:05] like, if they try to change or innovate pinball, if they become the New Jersey Jack, when they finally

[58:12] do reveal a game, it's going to be interesting to see. But why do you think Jersey Jack deserves 99%

[58:19] of all the criticisms? I think it's like I just said, I think people have higher expectations.

[58:25] And I think people are dying to get back to Valley Williams, Magic, and Pinball. And they know

[58:32] they're not going to get it from Stern, right? It's like you just kind of know when you walk in

[58:35] to McDonald's, you're not going to get a Michelin star meal, right? It's, to me, Jersey Jack is

[58:40] walking into that Michelin star restaurant and and some, if you're disappointed in something,

[58:45] it's much more glaring and you're much more likely to speak about it because you paid more

[58:51] and you expect it more. And I think that's why I think you see a lot more of the vitriol going

[58:57] Jack's way. It's, it's, and also this, this is the other part too. He only makes like one game

[59:03] every few years. So there's a lot more sort of pent up expectation and there's a lot more focus

[59:09] on what he's doing and it all hits at once, right? We're Stern. They've got so many games going

[59:15] that ultimately it's hard to critique them and be upset because they keep giving us stuff. So it's

[59:20] like yeah, yeah, you know, it might not be the best. It might not be perfect. It might not be aiming

[59:23] for the stars, but at least they give us four to five options a year. And because of that,

[59:27] I'll, I'll take it easy on them. But Jack is, you know, because Jack's, imagine if Stern only made

[59:33] one game every 18 months. That's, you know, imagine how probably amazing it would be if they put

[59:38] all of their resources into one thing. And I think that's the other reason why Larry that, although,

[59:42] although Guns and Roses is going to be coming out this year. No, so well, it'll be revealed this

[59:49] year. Yeah, maybe, maybe. And that's two in one year. I think that's getting somewhere. Yeah.

[59:55] And I think you're also going to see, and I basically, you know, this is a whole new subject.

[59:59] And we can talk about another podcast, but I am praying to God that Jersey Jack don't go all

[01:00:05] standard body and abandon a wide body because I think that's, I think that's their market. And I

[01:00:12] think people who have, like collecting things love Jersey Jack. And I don't think that Jersey Jack

[01:00:18] should be concerned that much with what Pinside people say about his games. I mean, he's, he's a high

[01:00:23] end machine. And I don't want to, but I do think what you're going to see from Jersey Jack is

[01:00:28] are going to try to start streamlining things. So they have less problems. And I think that,

[01:00:35] you know, when Guns and Roses comes out, it's going to be a standard body. I think when Toy Story

[01:00:39] comes out, it's going to be a standard body. And I think that would be heartbreaking to me. But

[01:00:46] I think that's what you're going to see. But dialed in is proof that you can put a lot into a

[01:00:50] standard body game. And so is, you know, look at like medieval madness. I know most every great

[01:00:56] value aims games. Most of them are standard body with a lot in it. So, and then look at Labowski.

[01:01:02] You know, you can do a lot. I think though that what I'm trying to say is that Jersey Jack, to me,

[01:01:09] is, that is by far, you know, the company that's trying to push him below, trying to innovate and

[01:01:16] trying to be different. And one of the things that was different about him aside from having the

[01:01:20] most beautiful graphics on the screen is the fact that there were wide bodies. And I don't think

[01:01:24] pinball players are people who buy their games care. They care about how beautiful they are.

[01:01:30] Right. And I'd hate to see them lose, you know, you know, they need to get better artists though.

[01:01:37] That's the one area now that's turn is just I think Willie Wanker is good though. Willie Wanker.

[01:01:40] Oh no. Jurassic Park. You're telling me that artwork is good. No, but like, Munsters blows

[01:01:47] Willie Wanker away. Munsters is good. Munsters is good. Jurassic Park is not good.

[01:01:51] Franchise Willie Wanker would have been amazing. If he didn't want to artwork is I think the best

[01:01:58] artwork they've done on a pinball game. So there's not even art. It's cut and paste.

[01:02:03] It comes from me. So is Batman 66? No, it's not. It's not in case. Franchise, but he drew the art.

[01:02:10] Anyway, Larry, I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to join the show. We'll have

[01:02:15] you back on more often. It's always it's always good to get you on the show. Yeah, well, I love to,

[01:02:19] you know what I'd love to do since people, you know, here's the thing. It's kind of funny. It's like,

[01:02:24] you know, the 2016 election people didn't say they were going to vote for Trump and they did. You

[01:02:28] saw the results. I think a lot of people in, you know, to their friends or on Pinside might say,

[01:02:35] oh, I'll never listen to Canada, but then they run right off and listen to it, right? So it's clear

[01:02:39] that you have the biggest following and people don't want to admit it, but it's true. And I think

[01:02:45] at the end of the day, pinball companies are listening to your podcast and we need to have a

[01:02:51] conversation. Not about tarmac playfields and everything else. We need to have a conversation of

[01:02:55] what we want as, you know, you said we should Jersey Jackson hire us and we should sit in a room

[01:03:01] with them. I agree. But you know what? We can do that on your podcast and we can have a whole

[01:03:05] podcast talking about what we want to see them do going forward. Yep. Yep. Now let's do it. And I

[01:03:12] I said it on a previous show last week. Consumers can tell companies what they want and the best way

[01:03:19] to get more into these games is don't buy the games when manufacturers give you like stripped down

[01:03:26] crappy games and then want to charge a lot of money for them. Like it, you can do more than Black

[01:03:32] Knights, Stern. We know you can. There's no just a, a flail and a shield that goes up and down.

[01:03:37] It's not good enough. It's not good enough for these prices. There needs your battling monsters.

[01:03:42] Well, put some monsters in the game. Physical things like that. I have great ideas for Black Knight.

[01:03:49] I was like, you know, they should have what they should have done. There's no license. They should have

[01:03:52] said, let's make medieval madness too. It's a, it's still, you know, it's a gothic castle thing.

[01:03:58] Let's make what people wished, you know, that's the middle. They remember. They never had a sequel.

[01:04:03] They could never, they would never, they would never in a million years now put a mech like that

[01:04:09] castle into a game. I don't think you're ever going to see another original title from Stern ever

[01:04:13] because Black Knight is sold so poorly. Okay. They probably won't want to take that risk again.

[01:04:19] Well, why should they look? Stern's making money. Stern is like laughing all the way to the bank

[01:04:23] and Jack has got to be like, how, what? They probably still sold more Black Knights than

[01:04:29] Pige the Caribbean. I mean, it's probably been more profitable for Stern. Anyway, Larry, we're going

[01:04:35] to keep going and we got to stop. I'm going to stop you now. We're at an hour. This has been great

[01:04:39] and we will talk soon. Thank you, my friend. Hey, take it easy.
