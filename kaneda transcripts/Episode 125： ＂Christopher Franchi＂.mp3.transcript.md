[00:00] I apologize.

[00:05] Do anyone who can true to say that he has found a better way?

[00:18] Welcome to episode 125 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast. Happy Monday, everybody.

[00:25] This is a really special podcast. I had an opportunity to talk with Christopher Franchi.

[00:30] His friends call him Franchi. I think I call him Chris because it's the best first name in the world.

[00:35] I really respect this man. He reached out to me after I had said some not so nice things about Batman.

[00:42] And he wanted to clear the air on what it was like making Batman 66 with Stern.

[00:47] And I really respect him because his story is very candid. It's very direct.

[00:52] And I think you'll walk away appreciating everything this man did to make this game as good as he could make it given the time period he had.

[01:01] And let's just say this, if he had not come on board, the Batman 66 package would have been nothing that like we see today.

[01:09] It wouldn't have been as good. And I think this man saved the day. I really do. And got the game to the best possible place it could be.

[01:18] And I also, I love his story and I love hearing from him. And I've said this before, Stern would do a much better job if they would allow these individuals more of an opportunity to tell the story behind the making of these games for better or for worse.

[01:34] I think a lot of the Pimbal critics would be silenced if they just heard from the people who are passionate behind these projects and heard from them on why things are a certain way.

[01:47] Because it would eliminate so much of the speculation, so much of the drama and the criticism that gets lobbed onto these new machines because people just don't know what these manufacturers are going through.

[01:59] I think the jury will always be out on this machine because Stern decided to charge so much. Right. Whenever you start to charge $15,000 for a machine, people's expectations are through the roof.

[02:11] Now, I still don't think the values there for $15,000 because I still think it's the same game as it is for 8 grand. And look, I'll say this though.

[02:22] Everyone I know who owns a Batman Ellie or a Super Ellie, they're happy with their game. You don't see many Batman Ellie's going up for sale.

[02:30] You don't see many Super Ellie's going up for sale. In fact, I don't think you've seen any in a really, really long time. People are holding on to them. And that's a good sign.

[02:39] And anyone else who wants one can go get one. And that's another great sign. Before I air the interview, I just want to do a couple other news items that's been going on over the weekend.

[02:49] First and foremost, I saw Alien Covenant the movie. I don't know if you guys saw it. And it was like, it was like, all right. It was just average. It's not scary. It's like so predictable.

[03:02] And I don't think Ridley Scott knows where to go with the story. It's just, you know, these permit theist beings made humans, human made cybernetic organisms. And everyone's looking for their creator. And the aliens are just there to kill any non-metallic life form.

[03:17] And I don't know. It's just all happening on screen, but you don't really care much about any of it. So pretty much I would give it like a B-minus. Not a great film, not a bad film.

[03:27] Lots of drama in the Alien thread. And I'm not going to go in you at all. But when I say this, because I've been reading on Pinside and people are starting to say like, that I'm the reason why there's drama.

[03:39] Okay. I do a pinball podcast. And I call it like it is. All right. I call companies out when I see them misdeed lines, when I see them refusing to give people refunds.

[03:50] I'm not the bad guy. All right. Canada hasn't prevented any alien pinball machines from shipping. I'm not the reason why they've run into so many issues and failed to meet so many deadlines.

[04:03] I will say this though. I think we're in a very dangerous space again, where people who have questions are being silenced by this small little army of shills that are constantly cheerily distributed.

[04:19] And they're constantly cheerleading this project regardless of what the facts say. Right. So for example, there's information out there, public information that showcases the financial, the financials of highway pinball.

[04:34] And people have posted it. It's in the thread. Here's what their liabilities are. Here's how much in debt they are on paper. And people are disputing those numbers saying, I don't believe these. I don't believe these numbers. These aren't right.

[04:48] So, Andrew Highway filed those papers. He legally had to report the actualities of the company. And yet still you have these fanboys who don't even believe the stuff that Andrew Highway himself has put down on paper as the financial situation of the company.

[05:08] And look, I hope people get their games. I just still think as we go towards June and this game is not being shipped in volume, it's going to be problematic for the company.

[05:21] And I just don't know why certain people have decided to stop thinking objectively. Right. Because if you're an objective person and you want to see how a company is doing.

[05:35] If you remove your emotion from the theme itself, right. Because this is not about us debating alien pinball whether it's good or not. It's just asking, is this company, are they going to deliver what they promised? And will I get what I paid for?

[05:50] And that's all people want to know. And I keep hearing from more and more people who have been asking for refunds and they have yet to get them.

[05:58] And I just don't know for the life of me how a refusal to give someone a refund is a good sign. It's not. It's not. And I think that more and more people are coming public.

[06:13] And I've heard from many people out there that they don't want to share the fact that they've asked for a refund because they don't want to get accused of potentially bringing a company down.

[06:23] And I think that's like just really sad and pathetic that that we're attacking that some people on there are attacking the people who just want their money back. Right. They just want their money back.

[06:35] So look, I think June is going to be a maker break month for a lot of companies. We're heading into June. And here's what's going to happen in June. Star Wars is going to be revealed. Attack from Mars remake is going to ship dialed in is going to ship.

[06:49] Okay. Alien pinball is either going to are they're either going to ship large quantities of LEDs or they're not. But June is really going to be the month. I think we're the shit hits the fan on on Dutch pinball on highway on all these other manufacturers out there.

[07:07] You either have your shit together in June or you don't and it's that simple. This pinball hobby that we all love would be much better off if all of these companies that are floundering would just go away.

[07:20] And I don't mean that I don't want competition, but don't enter into the pinball manufacturing world unless you have your shit together. Right. Home pin is getting ready to ship.

[07:31] P3 is getting ready to ship. We have way too many people trying to figure it out and only a few really have figured it out. And so look, that's it. It's not canada who's keeping companies from making their games. It's not me.

[07:44] I know you guys don't like it when I talk in a third person, but I'm going to do it sometimes. And this podcast exists solely solely to ask those questions and to keep these companies honest.

[07:55] Do you want this podcast to go away and just talk about some local tournament talk and all the other BS that just fills the airwaves with most other pinball podcasts? Who cares about that stuff? Who really cares?

[08:08] What I care about is that people get their games. I want people to review games that they get. I think pinball should be about actually getting the toys. This isn't happening any other hobby.

[08:19] And I'm starting to realize that like it's the pinball buyer that's enabled all these companies to exist. It's the buyers that have created the drama. Nobody in the car industry goes and throws money at new car companies.

[08:34] Nobody in like the transformer toy collecting hobby goes and throws money at a toy that has not even been made yet. Only in pinball do people throw their hard earned money at a toy that hasn't even been developed or manufactured yet.

[08:48] It's idiotic and it needs to stop. If you're going to go in on a small run game, that's one thing. But if you're bankrolling a company that's trying to take on Stern with your good luck with that. Good luck with that.

[09:00] Alright, the final point I'll make is I've asked so many people who are in on Lebowski, people who are making Lebowski, people who are in on alien, people who are making alien to come on this podcast and talk about the process of getting the game out.

[09:16] And everyone has declined to comment. What does that say? I'll tell you who hasn't declined to comment. Mr. Christopher Franchi is talking about Batman.

[09:27] Stern, again, only big real game in town and Chris is a great guy. And what's exciting is Chris is also working on new projects for Stern. Stern's got great artists locked in, they've got great themes locked in, and everything that they intend to build they will.

[09:47] And if you call me a Stern fanboy, I don't know how you can love Pimball and how you can get excited about new Pimball and not really root for Stern because they're going to do it over and over again. They're going to give you Pimball at a frequency that no one else can do. And they're going to give you themes that no one else can secure. And it's going to be great.

[10:09] It's going to be great because you know what you're going to have an option to buy or not buy. And that's the way it should be. And so I hope you enjoy this interview with Chris. I think he is a really great guy. And I look forward to seeing his future projects. And I look forward to meeting him at a show and shaking his hand because I think this man has has pulled off a minor miracle. And you'll see why when you listen to this interview. Enjoy.

[10:33] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian Pimball podcast, a very special guest. Mr. Chris Franchie, the artist extraordinaire on Stern's Batman 66 and Chris, I welcome you to the show.

[10:48] Thank you very much. That was an amazing blowjob.

[10:52] You know, I give you credit. That was the first time so it's hit me with a good zinger right away. I give you credit because Chris, you reached out to me and you were like, Canada, like, I like your show a lot.

[11:07] But what the hell ragged on Batman in episode 109. And I super appreciate that because I love when people give me feedback and want to stand up. And in your case, defend the machine itself.

[11:23] So let's we can probably jump right into that because I think Batman is probably how the Pimball world knows you the most correct.

[11:30] That would be the only way the pinball world knows you that was my first job in pinball.

[11:36] So let's talk about it because I have to admit, like I even for I've been very critical of Batman in a variety of ways, not critical of the artwork per se, but I think the price of the machine.

[11:49] And what people are getting is the thing that I've been the most critical of for because it is the most expensive stern pinball machine of all time.

[11:58] The code is still not done. It was kind of rushed out and everyone sort of knew that, you know, they were trying to meet the the anniversary date with it.

[12:06] So what do you like what do you just thoughts on the machine and when it was like working on it? I've got a bunch of questions, but I want to know like what your take is on the experience of making Batman Western.

[12:17] Well, I'll tell you first of all, first and foremost, it was a dream come true because I have loved pinball since I was a kid playing hockey and, you know, I grew up in Michigan and every hockey ring had at least one or two pinball machines in it.

[12:31] So I grew up on pinball.

[12:35] And always would have loved the idea to design one, but I never really I never really went after it for some reason.

[12:45] There was a thing that I did with kiss back in like 96 where I had contacted Stern and tried to convince him to do a new kiss pinball machine because I said, no, it's such a collectible thing and they're coming back out with their makeup now in the original members and, you know, it'd be great if you did a new one.

[13:02] I knew the people that did the licensing for kiss, so I kind of hooked them up.

[13:07] They kind of agreed at the time like, yeah, that might be a neat idea. And then I guess everything kind of fell through in negotiations and trying to work out a deal.

[13:16] And that was really my only foray and a pinball. I never really thought about it. Usually the things that I go after, you know, I can get work, but I never really thought about it, but just got a call out of the blue from Greg Thrares.

[13:31] And he wouldn't tell me at first what it was. He just said he found me on the internet. He found me on the interwebs.

[13:39] And there's something that he wanted to work on me with, but he couldn't tell me until they send me a non disclosure agreement.

[13:46] And so I went through all that and I had a hunch. I never would have thought a million years they would do a 66 Batman. That was my dream machine, my dream theme as they say.

[13:58] But I never would have thought a million years they would have done one. You know, it's it's old.

[14:04] You know, it's kids these days, people that are playing pinball, the younger generation anyway.

[14:12] You know, this wouldn't care about it, but you know, I'm learning more and more that there's a lot of old 50 something, farts like me out there that are buying pinball machines that do care about that stuff.

[14:23] And so I think that's a way long story longer.

[14:28] You know, my first impression was that on this whole project was it was just a dream job and I couldn't be more grateful that they called me to do it because I'm a 66 Batman collector.

[14:41] I've been a Batman fan all my life.

[14:44] And that's how they reached out to me as I saw my Batman artwork online.

[14:49] And I think the reason why I I reached out to you is, you know, I've been trying to get into the pinball culture and you know, see what it's all about.

[14:58] So I've been listening to the podcast and and came across yours and boy, you got a zillion of them up there. So I've been going to all that.

[15:06] And you know, when I I'm not the kind of guy that like just like giving me my paycheck, thanks see you later.

[15:12] I wanted to know what people thought of my work not only because no matter what I'm doing, I want to know what people think, but this was my first pinball machine.

[15:22] And it seemed like every time I went and let's do a podcast, they were just making fun of it.

[15:27] That you know, it was like it's the red headed stepchild of pinball because of the pricing structure and and all of that, you know, everyone's like what a rip off, you know, $16,000 and there's just a couple of hot wheels in there.

[15:40] I kind of got bummed out because I'm like, you know, I don't think I'm the best artist in the world, but you know, I never got any feedback on what people thought of the art because they didn't bother to talk about it because they're too busy ripping on it.

[15:54] So whenever it comes up, there's always this negative talk about it like, oh, what a bunch of crap. You know, they do mention the artwork. They skim over it so they can get to the punchline, which is, you know, oh, what a rip off or this or that.

[16:07] And you know, the reason I reached out to you is because like, you know, there's a lot of things that people don't consider in this whole scenario, you know, as to why things are what is it?

[16:17] I've got if I've heard it once I heard it a thousand times the word cash grab for Stern and there's a couple of things people really need to take into consideration.

[16:28] And I've listened to some of what you've said about it, and I think you've got a pretty good handle on it. But, you know, one one thing you have to remember is that this was like a joint production between Stern and Kapow.

[16:41] And what that means is that money is going to get divided right there, which is an unusual case because usually it doesn't get usually gets divided between the manufacturing licensee.

[16:51] But, you know, here we have a situation where you've got a third party involved.

[16:57] Chris, what was Kapow's relationship in design this machine? Because I think for pinball guys out there too, when they got the flyer about the machine and they saw this was like that joint venture.

[17:09] Kapow's rolling it. Did they own the license? I know they did work on the slot machine, right, for back in 1966. So they had some of the artwork already done for it. Like, what was the, how did that work?

[17:21] I don't know what to do with the artwork. I don't know what the license was piggybacked off Joe through Kapow.

[17:26] Joe came to Stern and said, hey, you know, my Batman 66 slot machines are doing well. You guys should think about doing a pinball machine. And so they started discussing it and decided to do it.

[17:37] And it all went through Joe. Joe's got a very good relationship with Warner Brothers.

[17:44] He got things through on that machine. Some people just don't realize some of the stuff that that machine has that is such a blessing.

[17:54] I mean, for example, way in the back, there are two play field plastics mounted on the back. One is of Alfred and one is of Commissioner Gordon with Chief O'Hara.

[18:07] And any licenseer, no matter what you're making, cannot use Alfred or Commissioner Gordon. They're not part of a licensing deal.

[18:16] But because of Joe's relationship, we were able to do that. And that goes for, you know, what eventually is going to be in the video screen and all of that stuff.

[18:26] And just because of his relationship with Warner Brothers, we were able to, I mean, as far as the artwork went, you know, I did Stern let me do whatever I want.

[18:38] They gave me very little direction. And I think that was intentional. I think they felt they had a good grasp on the property and they said, just run with it. And I did.

[18:48] I think that what they wanted to do and sent it in for approval. And I didn't get any changes back. Not a single change. Or your Batman's thighs to fat or, you know, whatever.

[19:01] And that's all due to Joe's relationship with Warner Brothers.

[19:06] So that's how that's basically how the ball got rolling was between Joe and Stern was Joe's slot machine.

[19:13] Okay, which is great to have someone who has such a great in with with the IP and the license holder.

[19:21] I want to just stop too because I want to say like I follow this game from the very beginning.

[19:27] And when Stern first showed those three image, the three machines lined up together. It was right before expo.

[19:36] The response was really positive. I don't think anyone was crapping over the artwork. I think the machine looked colorful. It looked bright.

[19:49] It was it was it really got a lot of positive feedback. And I think you know some of the you know, I don't want to say like negativity start to creep in a little bit.

[20:00] I think people got impatient with not being able to play the game because like pinball people and you probably notice this. Like they're very sensitive bunch.

[20:09] One stage one Stern dozey ours in dozey has them starts to wane or move in the wrong direction.

[20:15] They can easily turn against a machine or company right and Stern Stern is because Stern is the only real player in town.

[20:22] You'll notice this no matter what the machine is. Stern will get criticized the machine will get criticized.

[20:28] Everything does everything that like the inside is troll city. And I made the big mistake.

[20:38] As soon as they were releasing the photos of Batman. It was Greg or George somebody at Stern told me they said stay away from pinside.

[20:48] Do not go to pinside. Just trust me. Don't do it. And I'm like, I what the hell's pinside? You know, at the time, I didn't even know what it was.

[20:56] And once I found out, I'm kind of like, well, now that it's been released, you know, the day that it was released and the photos were released.

[21:02] I'm like, I'm going to go to pinside and see what people are saying because I'm curious, you know, what they think.

[21:06] I've heard a lot of bitching, but the bitching is all due to the price. But now that they've got something to look at, you know, are they going to kind of lose focus on that and have something to say about the way the machine looks.

[21:18] And I went in there and I'm was cried because there was a lot of people saying it looked good, but there's a lot of people, you know,

[21:26] you know, little emojis of people barfing up rainbows and stuff like people don't get that property. I've heard a lot of people saying, you know, oh, it's so colorful. The TV show wasn't colorful. I'm like, you have a black and white TV. Are you kidding?

[21:38] I know. That was the most vibrant TV show I think ever. Yeah. And the history of television.

[21:44] It was very much in terms of like another comparison in terms of color and the brightness. It was very much like the Dick Tracy movie. I mean, Batman 66 was always very colorful.

[21:54] It was always primary colors, bright in your face. And so in terms of talk me through, well, first before I asked this question, what I want to say, when you told me that story about the Alfred Plastics,

[22:07] and how that is such a, it's such a rare thing that that is on the machine, and it's something that Kipao brought to the table. I think where Stern sometimes fails to realize is telling a story like that adds to the value and the, the,

[22:25] the makes the game more interesting, right? And a lot of times people don't know these things. And I think Stern would be better off sharing with its customers, some of them amazing back stories that go into these games so that when the games do come out, you have some of that anecdotal information that is a good story.

[22:45] And I think that kind of hurts Stern at times because they do have sort of radio silence with their community. And it's sort of like here it is, take it or leave it. And everyone always takes it because there's no other, there's nothing else available for most buyers.

[22:59] But let's walk through when you got contacted by Stern. So because this game came out in fourth quarter of 2016, how long did you have to work on it? Was it, was it rushed because of trying to hit that anniversary date?

[23:14] It was, my partner was horribly rushed. They got ahold of me at the beginning of September. Now a few.

[23:22] That's insane. That's insane because the game was shown in like five weeks later.

[23:27] Right. Three, three different art packages in a month and a half. And not even a month and a half because a month and a half takes you right up to Expo. And of course they had to have this stuff put together prior to that.

[23:38] I did not get a whole lot of sleep. I did not get a whole lot of sleep between September and November because what a lot of people don't know is, well, let's go through a timeline and that'll kind of explain this things.

[23:53] The first thing they asked me to do and really the only thing they asked me to do was they said, look, we need 120 drawings of Batman gadgets because each machine is going to be named after a gadget.

[24:08] And we were making these little plots. So we need a drawing of, you know, each bat gadget.

[24:14] And so I started doing that, which was difficult because they only showed on TV maybe 70 of those back gadgets and a lot of them were just mentioned.

[24:25] Like, well, good thing I had my back, you know, my bat Tuesday extractor, you know, or we would have been in big trouble.

[24:32] So Greg thought, well, you know, you're such a fan of the show. If anybody can design something that would match the sensibility of the show and look like it was something that was on the show, even though it wasn't you, you know, you're the guy.

[24:47] So that's why he came to me. And as I started putting this stuff out, Greg kept mentioning and kept saying, you know, geez, you know, I really wish that, you know, we could have had to do something else.

[25:01] But we just don't have time. And I said, Greg, I've got a ton of Batman artwork already done, you know, I love Batman and whenever I have any free time, that's what I'm drawing.

[25:13] And so I said, send me the template for your back glass. And in the morning, you'll have something in your mailbox.

[25:21] And what he had in his mailbox was basically the pro back glass that you see on the machine now, or whatever they call it, super limited limited and then premium premium back glass.

[25:34] That's what I sent him that next morning.

[25:37] So what did they have Chris before you said that did they have another they had something?

[25:44] Did you see it? Yeah, I saw when I went in for our first meeting, which I think was in, no, no, it was in it was right before an expo.

[25:57] They had something that was a big logo and then it had photo images that were kind of like Photoshopped a little bit like they put some lighting effects on it.

[26:08] But primarily it was basically photos from the TV show. Very small characters. A lot of dead area. I don't know what it was.

[26:19] I don't know. I was assuming I was looking at some final concept for a back glass. It was just something they had laying around.

[26:28] And I didn't even ask Greg about it. Really I saw laying there and I didn't know what it was. I saw the back glass template.

[26:39] But I didn't know if that was like somebody had submitted that as here you go and they went, oh no, we don't want to do this. I really don't know how that happened.

[26:48] And I don't know the whole history of the machine and the design work leading up to me getting involved is even a mystery to me because we've hit the ground running as soon as you know after expo I had to continue drawing those gadgets and it took me into November.

[27:07] Right because they were considering you. You had to make up a lot of them too, right?

[27:14] I had to research them like I literally had to watch every episode and like I'm taking pictures of the TV with my cell phone, you know what?

[27:21] Look at all this cookie crap trying to get reference. And yeah, so that took me into November to get those done.

[27:29] And because they were talking about using them for the with the code, you know, on the video screen, which I don't think has been introduced yet.

[27:37] So yeah, it was it was a hellish three months where I didn't get a whole lot of sleep.

[27:44] And I forget where we started.

[27:47] Now did they were you were you contract as an hourly employee or just for the job?

[27:54] No, no, it's just it was flat rate. That's how they usually do things as they tell you this is what we need. This is what we'll pay.

[28:01] So basically Chris would happen to this is just to sort of summarize.

[28:05] Stirner been working on this you get called in pretty much at the 11th hour here. You see what they're working on.

[28:12] You're doing these gadgets. But because it's also like a theme you love and you see sort of like where they're going with the art.

[28:19] And you've done a lot of amazing Batman 66 artwork before this call even happens and this assignment happens.

[28:28] So you're able to use a lot of the incredible art you've created because it's and I think everyone agrees.

[28:34] The error of just Photoshop drag and drop just stock photography imagery is dead with pinball right. And I think zombie Yeti proved that with with ghost busters and donnies proved that with Metallica now arrow Smith and.

[28:51] And so you sort of did the best with what you could do given the time. I mean it right.

[28:58] Yeah, pretty much. Okay, pretty much like my I used to do a lot of artwork in the similar style of those guys.

[29:05] And I don't much anymore. Maybe Photoshop's made me lazy, you know, because now I'll just do sort of an ink drawing scan it.

[29:15] Color it, you know, in with some of the Batman stuff, those were like paintings like gouache and colored pencils and stuff.

[29:24] And you know, it's scanned that in and kind of clean it up and Photoshop and mask it out.

[29:29] You know, they're all separate illustrations. So I can kind of play color forms with them and slide them around how I want.

[29:36] But yeah, it was, you know, and hats off to some of the people I've worked for in the past because I basically had to call on a few favors.

[29:44] Because Greg said, you know, is there any way you can do three art packages once I did the back class, he goes, well, can you do a cabinet? Yeah.

[29:51] So I did a cabinet and sent it to him. And he's like, great. You know, can you do a back box? So once I did a one full art package, he said, well, you might as well do all three.

[30:02] So I called Chad at Twitter head, Twitter head makes 1966 Batman Macat's statues.

[30:12] And I had done an illustration of his back girl statue for something that actually eventually went unused other than to promote sales before the product was done.

[30:22] And I said, do you have any problem with me using this on pinball machine? And he said, no, we're, you know, we're all in this together. You know, go for it.

[30:30] And you know, he didn't own the artwork. He paid for me to do it. And it's a loss and to use it. But at the same time, I can't just take the art and go slap it on whatever I want. So he was gracious enough to say, you know, give us a green light.

[30:43] And then I called Frank at Mobius models who I had done the villains, catwoman and the riddler and penguin.

[30:53] And I said the same thing. Do you have any problem with me using this for pinball machine? Did you give me the same answer?

[30:59] They were both very, very happy to allow me to do that. And excited to see how it was going to look.

[31:06] Because I think, you know, of course, they've got a little connection to that now and they're both big fans of the TV series. So if it wasn't for them, I don't know if I would have had time to do what I did, you know.

[31:16] And I've heard a few people in podcast mentioned like, oh, this is old artwork.

[31:21] But the fact of the matter is, if I wasn't allowed to use that artwork, I wouldn't have been able to do it. And it would have been Photoshopped images. It would have been just, you know, drag and drop, as you say.

[31:35] You know, images from the TV show. And what would you rather have artwork that was, you know, on a model kit box once or photos that you've seen a million times since the TV show has been out 50 years ago.

[31:48] It was there was a no choice situation.

[31:52] And these are the things that people don't understand when they when they want to rip on all this stuff is like to just, you know, the miracle of getting this thing done and getting it done the way it was.

[32:02] When when you were doing the elements, what took the longest was the play field challenging?

[32:09] I didn't do the play field.

[32:12] Kevin O'Connor did the play field and they showed me the play field and they said, well, since you've done all these characters on the cabinet, you might as well do the characters on the play field.

[32:25] So they gave me his play field that had photos and it like that little bat shape with all the villains, you know, he had photos of the villains in there.

[32:34] And then he had a photo of Batman and Robin at the top and a cat woman, he had done some art. He took some clip art from Warner Brothers and then kind of airbrushed it a bit and kind of enhanced it.

[32:46] And so Greg said, you might as well redo these so that all the art matches. So the only thing on the play field I did was all the characters.

[32:53] Okay.

[32:54] There's a Batman and Robin slide on the side and that stuff.

[32:59] But Kevin O'Connor did the rest of that. I don't think he's gotten any credit for it either.

[33:04] Yeah, and it's one credit for it.

[33:05] Well, and I guess to the, I mean, it would have been too hard to start over and try to animate the background images of like the Gotham City it looks like and we've got the story night we've got.

[33:21] But it's okay. So you replace the characters and it makes it more seamless because we've got the same art style with the characters on the play field as on the back glass and on the cabinet.

[33:31] Let me ask you a question, Chris, because I know like as an artist, it's got to be somewhat frustrating to be pulled in and right.

[33:36] If you look at a pinball machine as a canvas where there's these different sections of real estate where you can populate it with art.

[33:45] What would you have done differently had you been given the amount of time to start in a respectable way, which would be months in advance versus on weeks.

[33:57] I'm, I would have loved to have done new new illustrations of the villains.

[34:06] Because I just see like that Joker, the Joker that I'd done, I'd, you know, I've been tinker out the stuff for five years.

[34:15] You know, I used to make my own hot wheels and my own action figure packaging and all this goofy stuff. And so I'd seen that artwork to death.

[34:23] And I would have liked to have redone that and I would have liked to have made the cabinet artwork a little more cohesive.

[34:32] And maybe a little more, I don't know, maybe formatted to its use properly because it was really just a matter of can I get this artwork that I've already done arranged in a way to make it fit on the side.

[34:44] Rather than look at the side of the cabinet and go, okay, what would be really cool to do here?

[34:51] And I wasn't given that opportunity. So, so if I could go back, that's what I would have liked to have done is, you know, on the cabinets really went in and thought up something that works for a cabinet rather than just use what I had and try to make it work.

[35:08] Sure. The top dog, the super Ellie, the Batmobile image that's on the side of that, was that an existing Batmobile image that you had done?

[35:19] Yeah, that was a Batmobile drawing that I had done and been kicking around for a while. It ended up in a video release for Warner Brothers.

[35:29] They did an animated movie based on the TV show with Adam Weston, Bert Ward, voicing their characters. It came out in November.

[35:39] And that artwork was on the inside of that. And then I just, it didn't have the characters in it and it didn't have anything else. It didn't have the background. It was just the Batmobile floating.

[35:52] So I went in and I added Batman and Robin and then I did the Batcave and, you know, the little forest and the road and all of that stuff that was all added later on specifically for the pinball machine.

[36:05] Gotcha. Gotcha. Well, I'm looking at that image again, that first image we saw in the stern factory of all three of them lined up. And, you know, I think given the time frame, given the, you know, the, the sheer just a couple of few weeks you had to put all this together.

[36:23] I think you pulled off a minor miracle, you know, given artists usually have months to do this stuff.

[36:31] Now, here's the thing because I do think the response to the cabinets when they were first shown was was really positive. And I think what, what, what happened was, and I was one of these people is like, I went to expo and you can't play the game.

[36:44] Yeah, what do you mean I can't play the game like if this game's coming out in November, shouldn't it be like almost done.

[36:50] And you've got probably the greatest coder in Stern's arsenal working on this game in lineman sheets and lineman makes games go from being a B to an A plus.

[37:05] And so everyone's sort of like waiting for this game to wake up. And I think what's happened with Batman. And I've been critical of this is because the game is not there yet in terms of the gameplay.

[37:15] Everyone is hyper critical of the other things that are happening.

[37:20] Oh, yeah, yeah, it's, you know, that's putting a bad taste in their mouth and while they're sitting around waiting, they're just like, well, what else can we pick on?

[37:28] Well, because like super elite Chris, like there, one of the big selling points that Stern had was we're going to get Adam West to personalize each game.

[37:37] And we're going to make 80 of these and Adam West is going to do a call out that introduces you to your game.

[37:44] And it hasn't happened yet, right? And so I think a lot of these owners are sort of, and when I say it's like a cash grab, you know, I don't look.

[37:52] We know that it's not a cash grab in the sense that Stern forced anyone to buy this game.

[37:59] You know, people willingly wanted this. They got like, they said they got 400 applications for the 80 Super Ali's that were going to be available.

[38:09] Everyone I know who has one, no one ever says like, I don't like the way it looks.

[38:13] Yeah, there are, there are questionable choices when Stern goes and gets like off the shelf match box cars.

[38:21] I wouldn't necessarily have done that if I were them. I think the community is to aware of where some of these items are sourced from.

[38:30] And then it becomes a little bit embarrassing.

[38:32] Especially, you know this, there's so many nice die cast and collectible Batman types of animals.

[38:40] Yeah, and if you're going to charge, that's a thing to it. Like it's this community and pinball people.

[38:47] It's price equals expectations on everything.

[38:53] And so when you're talking about that, I don't mean to interrupt.

[38:57] Yeah, go on.

[38:58] But you were talking about that, the personalizing with the Adam West.

[39:01] Everybody that got the Super Ali got a voicemail, a personalized voicemail from Adam West to use on your cell phone.

[39:11] Now, I don't know if they switched it to that instead of the callouts in the machine or that's still yet to come because it's a coding thing.

[39:18] But I do know that everybody got a, so they, they, they, so the owners got that already.

[39:26] Okay.

[39:27] I got to check with my friends and make sure.

[39:31] Yeah, somebody's, somebody named Chris happened to have bought and a super Ali.

[39:36] So sorry, whoever that is, but whoever it is, they sent me your voice.

[39:41] So I could use it too.

[39:42] Oh my god.

[39:43] Because it's like that.

[39:44] It's the first name.

[39:45] Yeah, that's like, well, if we want to, so did Stern.

[39:49] I always asked any artist who works with Stern. Did they give you a machine or did they let you buy one at a wholesale price?

[39:58] Yeah, they, they, they gave me a friends and family price. That was negotiated up front because obviously being a collector.

[40:05] I mean, I, there might be two or three things out there that are Batman TV show related that I don't have.

[40:10] I have everything else.

[40:11] Do you have a car?

[40:12] You have a car?

[40:13] No, I don't have.

[40:14] I don't have a Batmobile.

[40:15] That's, but that's not an officially licensed product.

[40:20] Okay.

[40:21] So that's a prop from the show.

[40:23] Which, um, which model did you grab from them in Ellie?

[40:26] A super.

[40:27] Well, that's, that, that's the interesting story. I have my own model.

[40:32] Um, I was lucky enough to be allowed to take the three models that I had created and pick the Frankenstein version that I wanted.

[40:42] Like the backlash from this one, the cab, you know, the side cat from this one, back box from this.

[40:48] You know, same thing with the goodies on the play field.

[40:51] So I, the one that I have is the only one that exists the way it is.

[40:56] And it even has like the way everybody has a plastic plaque on the, uh, back glass on the lower left side.

[41:04] I have one that says extra super limited edition one of one.

[41:09] And it has my signature on it and my name.

[41:12] Wow.

[41:13] So it's never one.

[41:14] Pardon?

[41:15] That's never leaving.

[41:17] That's not going anywhere.

[41:19] That's the only one of one ever.

[41:22] Right.

[41:23] What, uh, how did you arrange your, your Frankenstein version?

[41:27] What, what art do you have on it?

[41:30] Oh, you know, I, I don't remember what went to what packages, but I can tell you that I got the villains on the, the bottom big cabinet.

[41:38] Okay.

[41:39] On the back and, or on the side and on the front.

[41:42] Uh, I have Batman and Robin on each side of the back box.

[41:45] And I have what I think is the limited edition.

[41:50] Um, back glass or translate.

[41:54] And then I also have the super le toper with the bat signal projector at it.

[42:00] And do you have the, the pinstriped armor with the, no, okay.

[42:05] Do not, do not.

[42:06] I basically want to say that I'm not going to be able to do that.

[42:09] Do not, do not.

[42:11] I basically what it was was, you know, George said,

[42:14] I'd spec out what you want and I'll do what I can.

[42:17] And, you know, I think I had included the fancy speakers and the, uh, the side armor.

[42:23] And, uh, did not get that.

[42:25] I got the speckled legs, the, the metal flake legs and stuff.

[42:30] He did a great job.

[42:31] I'm not complaining whatsoever.

[42:34] You know, I paid a fraction of what those people who bought the super at least got.

[42:39] And, and as far as I'm concerned, I got something just as good.

[42:42] So, well, that's not something.

[42:44] Well, nothing about Batman.

[42:46] And we've said it on the show many times is what's interesting.

[42:49] And again, this is nothing to do with the art.

[42:51] Um, is the game itself, the gameplay is the same on every single version.

[42:56] And I think again, that, that gap in price.

[42:59] It makes it hard to know that I'm having the same experience.

[43:03] I'm having the same exact experience as some guy who paid like $7,000 or less.

[43:08] But see, that's a good feeling for the guys who paid $7,000.

[43:12] Yeah.

[43:13] Well, it makes sense to, yeah, because those guys.

[43:16] You're making more people happy.

[43:17] Yeah, there's going to be way more than 80 of those dudes versus the SLE guys.

[43:21] Right.

[43:22] And the SLE guys.

[43:23] And, and I think Stern has sort of established how they're going to move forward with the whole Ellie.

[43:29] And he really is just going to be a trim package because the premium will have the same features as every Ellie they have.

[43:36] So it's really the guy who just wants a little bit extra playing now.

[43:40] Chris, let's talk about your, like, before we talk about, well, let's start with your future at Stern.

[43:45] Because then I want to ask her questions a little bit about, I mean, if there's anything else in the Pimble art world that is interesting to you.

[43:52] But are you, are you working on any additional Stern Pimble machines?

[43:57] Yes, I am.

[43:58] I am, I'm balls deep in one right now.

[44:00] Balls of.

[44:01] All right.

[44:02] I'm not sure when it's going to be debuted.

[44:06] I'm not sure what I can say about that.

[44:09] So I'm all, all I know is I'm, I'm about three art packages done.

[44:19] And then moving on to the play field stuff.

[44:24] Okay.

[44:25] So there's still play field to be done.

[44:26] So this is a game that's most likely looking at 2018.

[44:32] I don't know.

[44:33] I don't know to tell you the truth.

[44:36] But you still have to do the play field, right?

[44:39] Yeah, yeah.

[44:40] I mean, all of this stuff is like, you know, unfolding as we speak.

[44:43] Okay.

[44:44] I know because that's, I think for my listeners, we're like, well, it's not Star Wars then.

[44:47] You know, it's like Star Wars.

[44:49] No, I will confirm it's not Star Wars because I don't even know if they're, I don't even know if Stern's, you know, I don't know.

[44:54] I don't work there.

[44:55] I don't work in their office.

[44:57] When I, when I do go there, you know, we'll go out to launch and we'll talk about stuff and we'll address what I'm there to do.

[45:04] But, you know, I don't really walk around and start picking through everything.

[45:07] You're like, hey, what are you guys working on?

[45:08] So what's behind this door?

[45:09] I really don't know.

[45:11] I know, I know of one pinball machine that is being made that nobody, nobody knows about.

[45:21] And when I say nobody knows about that means there's been no speculation right?

[45:25] Because I've heard all the speculation from Star Wars to, to shit.

[45:30] I don't remember what the other ones were now.

[45:31] The Star Wars, there's, there's, there's, Iron Maiden.

[45:34] There's Iron Maiden, there's Deadpool, there's Guardians of the Galaxy.

[45:40] Yeah, are these all, is this your dream list or is this what everybody is?

[45:43] This is like, this speculation.

[45:46] Like, and I think with Stern and knowing that Stern is a juggernaut in locking down all the best licenses,

[45:54] like it's, you pretty much could look out at culture right now and be like, okay, what coming, what going on in culture would appeal to the 50,

[46:04] like 40 to 60 year old male.

[46:07] There's a good chance that Stern has its eye on that and it's a, it's a potential for a pin.

[46:14] So that's sort of like, you know, and like the way these rumors start and not just on shows like mine,

[46:20] but it's, it's so easy to start a rumor like, just one, it could just take one dingle berry on pin side to be like,

[46:27] I have a friend that Stern that said he saw, you know, a box that had the following word on it and it could be like,

[46:35] Groot and be like, they're definitely making Guardians of the Galaxy and then everyone just takes that and runs with it.

[46:41] Oh, I've seen their co-names for stuff and they would never be that blatant. I can tell you that right now.

[46:47] Right.

[46:48] Because I walk around going, what does this mean? You know, what are these? I don't remember what they have.

[46:52] Yeah, but it would be like, yeah, it would be like awesome pinball volume one. They're like, oh, it's Guardians of the Galaxy.

[46:58] But that's even still too obvious for the, for the, what was the codename for Batman? Was there one?

[47:05] Yeah, there was and I'm trying to remember what it was, but it was, it was really obscure. Like, you know, of course, when you know what it is,

[47:11] you can kind of like, oh, but you know, if you just saw, you'd never connected. It wasn't something as easy as like, you know,

[47:19] Martha Wayne or something like that. You know, it was, it was something crazy.

[47:23] Well, it's so easy to first turn to, if I were them, I would, you could just leak out misinformation and these guys on pin side would,

[47:33] would spend a year trying to find more about it. I kind of want to, like, let's just start this rumor right now. They're making a dev open bomb.

[47:43] There it is. Super early. You heard it here first. They would sell out of super early.

[47:49] Do you, so it's kept how also coming back for another game?

[47:55] They are because I have been busting ass on some, what do you want to call it? Sort of preliminary.

[48:03] I don't want to call it preliminary armor. I did basically a backlash design that's that's complete finished and good.

[48:09] Like it doesn't need to, I don't need to return to it and touch anything up. It's golden and and Joe had a meeting today with those people in, now I'm going to say this very intentionally in hopes that he could get this.

[48:24] Push through and it would become a reality and it has and what I mean by that is this is not a license that you just say, hey, I want a license and you get it.

[48:39] That's juicy. Something good. Something good then.

[48:45] It's very good. I think it's going to surprise a lot of people. A lot of people are going to, you know, what do they call it, forehead palm themselves that go, I never thought of it. Brilliant.

[48:55] Yeah, the frog or rock license. I heard it's tough. Yeah, just got the news today that that's a good one.

[49:02] I mean, like I follow the whole industry and the more I hear about the next couple of years for Stern, the more I would hate to be a Stern competitor.

[49:13] And I keep hearing from Mike and I know I'm hearing from a lot of people that like work at Stern, so it's like take that with a grain of salt.

[49:19] But I mean, these guys are literally like, you haven't seen anything yet. Like just game over coming.

[49:27] You know, but competition is the best thing for any market. That's what's going to keep all these other guys on their toes creating innovative new things for maybe a less, you know, exciting property.

[49:39] But it's all about gameplay granted people all have their dream themes, but like what do people talk about most of these podcasts is, you know, how well it plays or how fun it is or the code and all of that sort of stuff.

[49:50] So I stern sort of being the top dog in this. It just puts everybody else on their toes all the more and we all benefit from that because then we get great products so that people can stay competitive.

[50:02] Yeah, and that but the thing is is that it's everyone else who puts Stern on on Stern's toes because Stern was getting really lazy in the sense that like if you go and you you've probably seen Chris like the, you know, the games before the hand drawn artwork.

[50:22] It means it was like Photoshop drag and drop like nothing very creative. You know, even in the toys and the gameplay and the mechanism department.

[50:32] When you don't have competition, you become, you know, the madden football of video games were every year same game same game.

[50:40] And so, Jersey, I've been in licensing for probably 30 years now.

[50:47] And there's something that, you know, if you're not on the inside, you don't understand. And that said, a lot of these properties won't let you do artwork.

[50:57] Something I could very easily see that HBO would say, no, you're not going to draw a game of thrones. You know, we paid this photographer a fortune and our package, you know, everything for our merchandising programs is all planned out.

[51:11] And you can't veer from that. You got to use what we got. You know, we want people to see it and recognize it as our brand is our official product.

[51:21] I'm going to assume that's probably what happened with that is that, you know, their hands were tied and they didn't have a choice of those decisions aren't always made necessarily by Stern.

[51:31] But I've heard them taking a lot of flex, especially from that one, you know, blah, blah, blah, photo shot, not a lot. They don't always have the choice that I think they had been very fortunate to have been working with recently a lot of people that have given them some flexibility.

[51:47] And I think that I think thanks to people like Mando who do the alternate movie posters, I think those movie theater, those movie studios are starting to kind of come around and, you know, the days of the movie poster with the five heads, you know, in the names above it, you know, are kind of going by the wayside and people are getting a little more creative now.

[52:09] And I think with the influx of that, you know, and fan driven stuff, I think that's creating greater flexibility with these companies.

[52:21] And I think you're going to see a lot more unique stuff moving forward. It's not so much just a case of Stern heard the fans and, you know, cow touted them and did what they wanted. It's more like Stern's has been given the freedom to do what they wanted to do in the first place.

[52:37] Yeah, I mean, I might, I agree, but I do think that there was a period where like Stern just didn't have like hand drawn artists on board on the like on the staff, you know, and there's a lot of that.

[52:53] No, it's not cheap, but you know what else is not cheap these pinball machines. So here's, so here's what I think is interesting. So I think you hit on a really good point. And I do think a lot of these studios are understanding that it pays to be, it's, it's to their benefit to be more flexible on, on these IPs and letting amazing artists sort of bring these things to life in different ways.

[53:18] But I also think if you're if you're a pinball manufacturer like Stern and I approach an IP or a license and and they won't let me get really creative with it, I'd walk away because I really do think we are at the point now where I'd rather see no Game of Thrones pinball machine.

[53:38] Then a Game of Thrones pinball machine that is so compromised in terms of the art because because what happens is ultimately people won't buy it or be interested in it if it's not beautiful, especially at these price points.

[53:53] And the other thing I think too is and I think Gary and again, like I work in marketing, but I don't handle these kinds of agreements. If you were to walk into a meeting with some of these more rigid and conservative,

[54:06] with cramudions who might not want you to do hand drawn, if you were to show them examples of your machines that were hand drawn versus the ones that were Photoshop drag and drop and be like, look, we're going to provide you some of the greatest artistic talent in the world to bring your license to life.

[54:22] I tend to believe only an idiot would be like, now we're going to stick with the Photoshop crap that we've got in our asset folder.

[54:30] Yeah, people, I think they would require an education on the history of pinball and what collectors and fans of pinball these days look for because I know that's, you know, I'm so thankful that I'm in this industry now because I love listening to reviews of pinball machines and the first thing they always say is the art package.

[54:54] And I'm like, you know, God, you know, after years and years and years of doing stuff that you'd not allowed to put your name on and nobody gives a crap that you did it in the first place to finally be somewhere where, you know, someone's going to look for a product that you've done because they like your work.

[55:09] And it's the first thing they talk about so many people have said, you know, when they say, you know, break it down like what's your most, what do you feel is the most important thing of, you know, top five things that are important about a pinball machine.

[55:21] And number one is always the art package.

[55:24] That's fantastic. And I think if these people are educated on what the pinball culture is all about in the history of pinball art, you know, I think they'll come around.

[55:38] I think these people also have the same time nowadays get bombarded with, you know, with the internet, you've got, you know, Joe Schmo sitting at home wishing that he could draw, you know, packages for Batman action figure.

[55:51] So he's sending Warner Brothers all this crap art and, you know, they're like, no, no, no, you know, I think that probably puts a bad taste to their mouth too.

[55:59] They don't really sure what they're going to get.

[56:01] Right.

[56:02] But the bottom line is they have to approve it.

[56:05] But at the same time, I've seen a Warner Brothers is guilty putting a lot of crap.

[56:09] Yeah, I've seen a Batman collector.

[56:12] Like, I bought some things very begrudgingly.

[56:15] Like this looks awful. Who approved this?

[56:18] Right. Why is the, why is the bat signal the wrong color? And it's just like all kinds of stuff.

[56:22] So yeah, I get it. And I wish they did too.

[56:26] You know, is it a point that, you know, does the problem lie within the fact that somebody does not educate these people or do they not want to because they don't want to make waves?

[56:38] You know, who knows what the root of that problem is, but it is definitely a problem.

[56:44] But like I said, I don't think it's as much of a problem.

[56:47] I think it's come a long way in the past couple of years.

[56:50] Definitely, definitely. And you know, it's exciting to see the response to Aerosmith because I interviewed Donnie about a couple of weeks ago.

[57:00] And you know, when people just heard that Aerosmith was going to be the next Stern Pimball machine, just a lot of cynical responses to the theme.

[57:09] Right. Because we argue back and forth.

[57:12] If you, into your point, Chris, the top five things that people look for in a Pimball machine, it's like you got theme, you got gameplay, you got art, you might throw in there like sound, you know, and so like when the theme of Aerosmith was announced, everyone's just like, this is a freaking zero.

[57:31] Like who wants Aerosmith? Even though Aerosmith has sold more homes than almost any other band in America, people don't even know their history.

[57:38] But when people saw it showed the power of art that the power of art can override the power of, you know, even theme. And same way the power like good code can even override bad art or bad.

[57:53] Right. You know, some bad geometry on the game. But for the most part, the reason I think art is so important is these things are works of art.

[58:01] And I, I justify having Pimball in my apartment. I have a magic girl. You probably know this. It's the most beautiful pin I think I've ever seen. It doesn't really work. But as an item of art. And that's how I tell people like if you look at it and you understand the hours are going to making the art. And, and to me, my friend always says this. He's like, Pimball is a movie poster you can play.

[58:22] If you, if you look at it like that, it becomes a combination of the kinds of movie posters people love and also combining it with an interactive experience. It's, it's, it's incredible.

[58:36] Yeah. Well, it takes you into a, you know, I mean, when I was a kid, you know, playing it, I felt just felt like I was kind of transported into this fantasy world.

[58:45] You know, because you're so engulfed in artwork, artwork, you know, for Pimball machines has always been so over the top, you know, I'd confess that, you know, to my personal taste, I thought, you know, maybe the Batman artwork was a little too busy.

[58:59] But I did it as busy as I did because I considered, you know, where this was going and who was going to be buying it and what they would expect. And, and they just, you know, people love to be overwhelmed.

[59:11] Especially if you look at the stuff that Donnie's doing and the stuff that Jeremy's doing, you know, there's so much, you know, this cram these little Easter eggs in here and there and do all this stuff.

[59:22] And that, you know, it just pulls you into it. It's what I call a plastic landscape. I swear I'm going to do a Pimball book one of these days and call it plastic landscapes.

[59:31] Because that, you know, that's really what it's like. It's really when I was a kid, I used to say Pimball machines were like the coolest fish tank ever.

[59:41] Right. There's a kind of a glass box with all this cool crap inside.

[59:45] It's really, there's nothing like it. There's nothing like it. And, and so let's, let's talk about. So Donnie's Erasmith has all these awesome Easter eggs and the details.

[59:55] So now that you're, you get a chance, Chris, to do your next machine from the ground up. Are you really excited to not have to like retrofit stuff onto existing stuff and you're not in repair mode. You're in create mode.

[01:00:11] Right. Are you excited to like look at that blank play field and be like, all right. Like how do you, how would you tackle it? Like, well, you know what? I really don't know. I am excited for the prospects, but, but this is going to be my first play field.

[01:00:24] So I've been doing a lot of research on how they're done. I don't know what I'm going to be given. Like are they going to say, look, here's where all these little lights go. And, you know, this is going to be this feature and that feature.

[01:00:38] I don't know how much is going to be spelled out. So I'm kind of nervous at the same time. You know, I'm excited for the for the challenge, but kind of nervous because I'm not sure what to expect. But, you know, definitely.

[01:00:51] Definitely, definitely looking forward to it. And, you know, seeing what I can pull off.

[01:00:59] You know, within that framework. I, you know, my style is a lot different than those guys. I'll probably never go back to that. I don't see a need for it because we already have a dirty down and we already have a Jeremy Packer.

[01:01:16] We don't need another one. Can you explain in layman's terms when you say your style is different? Because I know it's always sometimes hard to articulate the differences of artistic style without showing it visually. But what do you, how would you consider your style now to be different than what those two are bringing?

[01:01:32] Well, what those guys are very, you know, they're a modern version of classic pinball art. You know, it's all the super detailed line work almost kind of comic book like, you know, everything's got a holding line.

[01:01:48] And then it's filled in from there. Some of the stuff I've seen that the shading is almost screen printed style, which is solid colors.

[01:01:58] And, and I don't really do that anymore. I, you know, I love inking. I just haven't gotten to that. Maybe because I do, I do so much work that, you know, it's like, how can I do, you know, I don't want to compromise anything, but how can I do this faster?

[01:02:16] And, and rather than spend all this time with, you know, all this line work and crazy stuff, I can do it quicker in an illustration and, you know, scan it in, touch it up and then take it from there.

[01:02:29] And even, you know, you can do stuff to it from there. Like sometimes I'll put outlines on things just because I really like outlines on things.

[01:02:37] You know, I love the look of a, you know, it's kind of stolen from, from juice, Drew's and who's like the classic movie poster artist of all time.

[01:02:47] Where he, and it would just kind of benefit his style. He would put a hard black outline around everything because the multiple, the multiple media is that he was using.

[01:02:58] He said that if you just put this black outline around everything, it kind of covered up all of his sloppy frisket cutting.

[01:03:04] And then he would go in and put like, you know, a lot of times he puts a sort of a signature colored outline around that, but very sketchy.

[01:03:12] And I do it a little bit differently, but the look I really like, and it depends on what it is.

[01:03:20] And obviously with something like a white Batman, with a comic book theme, it definitely fits very well. But, yeah, my basically what you're looking at.

[01:03:31] And I will see what happens with the play field, but what you're looking at on the cabinet in specific the the back glass for the Batman ones. That's really my style.

[01:03:40] Right.

[01:03:41] That's what it is. It's that it's that very rendered look.

[01:03:47] Slightly stylized.

[01:03:50] And it really depends. Sometimes I stylize more and sometimes I stylize less.

[01:03:57] But that's that's basically it. You know, I don't do a lot of heavy black line work anymore. And like I said, I don't feel the need to.

[01:04:09] I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you can't beat Jeremy for that. You know, if you can't do something, you know, as good or better than someone, then why do it?

[01:04:19] So there's already, you know, a zombie Yeti out there, you know, that's what you want. You call Jeremy. And hopefully he's got time.

[01:04:26] I certainly don't want to mimic anybody.

[01:04:29] Not, you know, just to not to disrespect them, not because I don't feel they're mimic worthy.

[01:04:36] Jeremy is probably my my favorite modern day pinball artist.

[01:04:42] Just artist in general, I think he's fantastic. He does great rock posters.

[01:04:48] He's got a great style super clean line work.

[01:04:52] And I just don't see the need to do that. I know people like it. They respond well to it.

[01:04:59] You know, I'm hoping to give them a reason to respond in a different way to, you know, equal quality artwork that just has a different look to it.

[01:05:09] Right. And I'm looking at, um, is it metaluna 5 media on Facebook?

[01:05:15] Yeah, that's my art studio stupid stupid stupid artists out there. Don't come up with some clever stupid name for your artwork and then open up a Facebook page because I have too many people liking that.

[01:05:28] To ditch it and I'm stuck with it and I'm going to have metaluna 5. I can tell you where it came from.

[01:05:34] But it doesn't mean anything, you know, right?

[01:05:38] So unfortunately, well, metaluna is the name of the planet that they go to in the movie, the silent earth.

[01:05:45] Which is those real real mainstream title there, Chris.

[01:05:49] This island earth. That's a classic universal sci-fi movie. You know, you'll know the creatures. They got the big blue brainy heads with the black eyes that look like fly eyes with red veins around them.

[01:06:02] They made it bigger as a marketer. I can't I can't confirm that that's a good choice though for your gallery on Facebook.

[01:06:10] But I'm looking through the images now and they're they're they're pretty incredible and I and for people listening to the show, I recommend scrolling through Chris's work because I think you'll you'll see that there's a lot of talent here and it is you know, I think it's Don he's got his style Jeremy's got a style your stuff goes you know it's got a lot of stuff with great colors a lot of photo realistic stuff it a lot of variety too over the years to that.

[01:06:38] I think you could take any license and make it sing so I know that people are excited because I think Stern's got this all star artistic roster they're building now that do you feel sort of honored and to be a part of that now Chris moving forward because they see me.

[01:06:56] I can't even put it into words I mean when you get a call from Greg Ferrer's and it's just like you know the his body of work.

[01:07:05] That he's done in George Gomez and these guys like you know I'm getting like emails on phone calls from these guys I got a you know pinch myself I'm like you know geez no you know it's it's it's very humbling.

[01:07:19] At the same time it's not something you can settle into.

[01:07:25] And the reason is the great thing about the great thing about the inside workings of pinball is that at least from an artist standpoint the people that I met are very humble.

[01:07:43] They're very kind you know like you know I've talked to Jeremy a few times he's very complimentary my work as I am of his you have a competition sort of like you know you you know when I'm working on something I think like you know well you know I want you know I don't want people to say oh well you know Jeremy sucks because this is amazing you know I want people I want people to mention in the same breath.

[01:08:12] Right you know working with those people just keep you on your toes it's like you know you I can't sit back and like taking it is for granted because these people are all just so amazing at what they do that you know if I did anything less than my best I feel like I was cheating.

[01:08:27] Yeah no I agree and it's interesting to you because I as I watch Donnie do Erasmith and Saul I mean I didn't watch him do it but as I look at his play field I feel like Jeremy really raised the bar with Ghostbusters and I think Donnie even raised it further with with Erasmith and and it's a healthy competition and I think you know each time you guys are are taking a swing at these play fields and these cabinets it's got to be exciting being like well how can I do something a little bit different here.

[01:08:56] How can I do something a little bit you know original here and more creative here and I mean I even love like the way Donnie did the the save ball when lit on Erasmith at the bottom normally that's just a little insert with not much creativity around it and he's got it written in this awesome sort of fun and it fits perfectly with the theme and I know he's got a bunch of Easter eggs he's going to reveal soon on the play field.

[01:09:22] So this is exciting time and so Chris when you look at the rest of what's going on in Pimwell because I know being part of Stern is all comes with a real benefit that Stern machines do come out Stern machines are normally drama free you know as much as people might be moaning and groaning about Batman code right now let me tell you they have their Batman game.

[01:09:45] So it's it's a lot easier to wait for an updated piece of software than to wait years and not even get your game you've been to shows and you walk the floors what any other art out there that you think is interesting anything else where you're like oh man they could have you know I would have loved to like jumped on that theme and.

[01:10:06] Oh Jesus you name it every theme as far as the artwork that has stood out to me.

[01:10:15] You know Jeremy's Jeremy's work again in particular Jeremy's work on the oh god what's the promotion you have worked on today magic girl yeah magic yeah the the element of fun that he brings to pinball it's almost kind of retro with like the little lightning bolt icons and you know sort of retro sci fi.

[01:10:42] You know I love that stuff I'm a big fan of that crap that that stuff reminds me of when I was a kid and what better to be what you know what better time to be reminded of them when you didn't have to worry about car insurance you know I get for work you know so I think Jeremy's got a very unique style and I really like his work and unfortunately I don't know who did it actually tried to find out but like it's a mystery right now I'm sure you know.

[01:11:12] I really like the cabinet I will all of you are really for the who do you mean.

[01:11:19] Then so the new who do you need the steam punk version well I like both of them I don't know if the old one was that like art ripped off from an old you know poster or was it done in that style I sort of attribute.

[01:11:32] So the original who didn't the one we saw it expo 2016 was that was Matt Andrews who's the artist who did all the cabinet work on magic girl and and john's other games first did where and then I don't know who the new artist is who did the current I should know this because I do know his his name was put out there when they revealed it.

[01:11:59] I have to say I do like the Matt Andrews more a little bit more cartoony sort of stylized sort of it's almost like if you were looking at a comic book of Houdini versus the actual Harry Houdini.

[01:12:13] Yeah well it looked like one of those old to me it looked like one of those old magic posters you know the classic you know come and see Houdini at this theater whatever the awesome things that used to do.

[01:12:25] Yeah so the the new one is a little bit more sort of photo realistic of them and more of a steam punk sort of darker look they both look they both look good in their own way I mean personally I think pinball is better when it's brighter and more colorful and more playful because of the nature of what pinball is.

[01:12:44] But you know who do you know who do you definitely interesting I am trying to think to you know the bouski art is it's good it's it's it's I like that I wish the game was coming out there's so much drama with that game that I can't you know I can't get excited about artwork when.

[01:13:00] They can't get them out and then alien I obviously wish that they had used hand drawn artwork I'm confused by the alien the fact that they said they couldn't do hand drawn artwork now the back class is hand drawn by Brian Allen which he did a really good job on that and it's like one of those things where.

[01:13:19] You know I man if he had done the whole game I think it would have been a different story but it's like another company we just hope they get their games out I think you know a lot of what this industry's turned into Chris's.

[01:13:31] You know a lot of a lot of people are realizing there's so many elements that go into making a pinball machine that it's not just about putting the icing on the cake it's it manufacturing is the hardest part of it.

[01:13:43] Yeah manufacturing dealing with approvals all of that stuff you just have to remember that you know the some of the decisions that people make their hands are tied and you can't just automatically see them oh why did.

[01:13:57] Stern use this or do that why didn't they do this and you know those it's not always their call.

[01:14:03] But you know what I want to say because I really appreciate you coming on and we normally do this around like an hour what what I love about this chat and in you explaining the story behind Batman and what you're working on in the future is it puts people at ease because they feel connected they feel connected to you they feel connected to Stern and in that connection I think is what's missing from Stern.

[01:14:32] And it's the advice I'm giving like Jared and and George it's like you guys when you talk to your customers a little bit more right when you let them in to the experience of these games and and and and being what's going on as much as they can talk about it like here's what happened with like the license because I know Disney is like tying their hands a lot on stuff with Star Wars and I know that Batman how you know we had a chain stuff with only a few weeks.

[01:15:00] That's the story whether you like it or not that's the story and the story will put people at ease because people do appreciate when they just know the truth about how this came about for better for worse.

[01:15:13] Right yeah I think I would have gotten a lot less flack at people knowing what I had gone through just to just to get done what I could and I completely understand your point.

[01:15:24] I on the other hand I don't I don't know Stern's position and why they do the things they do I know it's a it's a competitive business and I you know like I remember like why you know I don't understand why you guys wouldn't just like shout to the world.

[01:15:41] We're working on Batman 66 like what's the secret you know and they're like well you know you know they've you know they got their reasons for why they do their business the way they do and not everybody subscribe to that but they do how far that extends into how they deal with the public I think from the outside looking in I'm certainly not speaking for anybody and this doesn't go back to any conversation I've had with anybody there but I would think the way things like

[01:16:10] things like pin side run with stuff they're just afraid they're just afraid to open up too much and then like where's it where's it gonna be taken from here as soon as I say this it's gonna get twisted into this and it's gonna go out as this and then once it hits pin side you know it goes everywhere and and maybe they're thinking you know maybe the less they know the better you know the less controversy there's gonna be because I've just never seen so much catiness and one culturally it's such a fun culture and it's like a fun culture.

[01:16:39] And like why people are just so right like all the trolls all the internet shows in the world just went out pinball yes that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to the pinball site.

[01:16:50] Well I think Stern is smart for not engaging that much they you know they don't need to engage too much what I think they would do what I would recommend is when a game does ship though like tell the story then because yeah and the reason why they don't jump in early and you know scream for the game

[01:17:08] scream from the rooftops that Star Wars is next because what happens is the year point like the trolls come out and everyone just starts like criticizing or wanting too much information or wanting it too early then then maybe a part delayed and they can't hit the date they said and then all beside and everyone's like

[01:17:27] Stern lied Stern is destroying my childhood so they but they they've gone so far in the other direction now where someone wants to come on to their Facebook page and say you know what I think Game of Thrones art looks like shit you know and then they ban you from their Facebook page like Stern you can't be like that like

[01:17:49] the world of social media the world of how people want to talk and converse is not up to you to dictate when you're in those channels you have to behave according to those channels so Facebook is a channel where people should be able to share more of their real opinions like if you go to for example if you go to the New York Jets Facebook page I used to be one of the community managers for that page.

[01:18:11] All we dealt with all day long or being like the jets freaking suck like every Monday would just be more fans being like this team blows we didn't ban those people from being fans of the jets we hope the jets would win but I think Stern will be better off would be better off just finding new inroads to connect with when I talk to Gomez on this podcast immediately

[01:18:41] afterwards people like this great if you would just if they would just do it every once in a while just sort of give us a little bit more information you know Chris you're a great personality of great path like no one has more passion for Batman 66 than you and you don't get that in a flyer you don't get that in a static image of the game you don't get that in it in a in a game out of show with no code running so the more they can let that out the better well I'll certainly pass that on and I would say this so I'll just be right.

[01:19:11] Also as a suggestion in the opposite direction.

[01:19:16] If people engage Stern in a matter of almost like a newspaper reporter like hey the pinball culture has really been turned on to this old school hand drawn mentality and you know that's like all the rage now and then you came out with Game of Thrones and have all this Photoshop elements and assets from from HBO and all that.

[01:19:40] You know why that route because it was much less attractive to pinball fans than the other if they approach it that way as opposed to like you said that looks like shit you know then you wouldn't get banned and people might take the time to give you a respectful response to your respectful question but when people are trying to like you know elbow their buddies at the same time while they're leaving a message it looks like crap I told them it looks like crap you know you just ignore that stuff and it makes your you know they're running a professional.

[01:20:09] It's a business page and thousands and thousands of thousands of dollars are at stake you know in this business and you got somebody going there and they're like shit and they wonder why they get food at all.

[01:20:22] You know what's true it's true.

[01:20:24] Well and Gary and George and the team over there know this that pinside is like maybe 10% of their audience.

[01:20:33] And he just try to get back on so bad right wall you know for well here's a thing is like I would like to just be on there because I think it's reached the point now we're clearly I've changed for the better and clearly this podcast has become a real influential part of the pinball community.

[01:20:54] And it has added a lot of value and just the fact that people can't even link they can't link to this podcast in like to me it's like what is this Russia like it's not like you can't even say my name without them like scrubbing the thread and it's just kind of it's gone to the point now where I've spoken to Robin personally many times like Robin look I get it like a year ago I would do ridiculous podcast like pinside babies and call people out.

[01:21:23] I'm like I'm not doing that anymore like you should listen to the show you know listen to what we've been doing the last like six months to a year and I think you'll start to realize that this dialogue even like this weekly dialogue that I do in this podcast I think it helps people because we know this that the people who are hyper passionate about pinball they just can't really get enough of it.

[01:21:44] And I think this is even more productive just listen to this show then because you get addicted to form behavior and form behavior brings out the worst in everybody because when I meet these guys that shows they're all really nice no one would go up to to George and be like game of throwing looks like shit man like to his face like it's.

[01:22:02] You're doing it yeah well then the worst part about this is what more than even like criticizing Stern what pinside has too much of is someone new to the hobby comes on the pinside and says hey guys I just bought game of thrones I love the theme and people are like you're a fucking idiot for buying the ugly this game ever and it's like the insults are coming from every angle yeah and it's like on some level you know maybe the guy just likes game.

[01:22:32] Oh you know maybe he's right book and he has to take what he can get with with with the pin so it's it's all ridiculous drama you can't be you know I can't be a backlash with denarius on it she should have been on would assault a million if you put her on all three back glasses I know I know well Chris let's end on this note if you're ever feeling down and you're ever feeling down and out about batman just remember this you can tell people I made I made the artwork for pinball machine.

[01:23:02] Where what have you done well you could just you could stop there right or you could say and the game sold out in a day at 15000 is the most expensive pinball machine to ever sell out.

[01:23:15] And then that's what they did that day I don't know you know what I would say I would say I did Batman 66 pinball machine and it looks fucking fantastic because I think it does because I'm when it comes to that I'm my best critic not because it's my artwork because like you know I collect Batman.

[01:23:32] And stuff you know that I created the dream machine as far as I'm concerned.

[01:23:37] Right.

[01:23:38] Well that's gonna happen on that note you know as far as you talk about like people coming out and and and discussing this stuff.

[01:23:45] You know it doesn't when you when you bust your ass I mean I literally might have gotten 12 hours of sleep a week between September and November.

[01:23:59] I mean I really did some damage to my body trying to get that work done.

[01:24:03] And when you bust your ass like that it only takes one comment from someone that you know doesn't use a very you know intelligent choice of works and just says Batman looks like shit.

[01:24:18] That's all it takes for you to just be like man you know you just can't please anybody you know I tried so hard I worked so hard I didn't get any sleep.

[01:24:26] I'm super super proud of what I what I did.

[01:24:31] And here's this guy fucking shit and all over it. It only takes one person.

[01:24:35] No I know you got it's like I mean thick skin is just like a requirement in any in any industry where creativity or you're producing something that is has subjective eyes looking at it.

[01:24:53] You're going to get it I mean I I mean I think I think like the art when I made my bedroom arcade I thought it looked amazing and I most people did and then I went on like the arcade for everyone's like look at this homo look at this stupid like it's like what like I have a bright colored floor it's like look at his Ninja Turtle sheet he's a biggest loser ever I'm like like you know but meanwhile like 99% of people though we're like this is awesome and it's just a matter of like tuning out those.

[01:25:21] Right yeah it's the good mix up for the bad but you know like I said in the beginning of our conversation unfortunately the Batman machine has turned into the red headed stepchild so when I hear it like I'll go through people's podcasts list and I'll look and I'll look for Batman 66 and I'm like oh so I click on it.

[01:25:40] I listen to it and as soon as it gets mentioned it's mentioned someone makes a joke about something costs so much and then they move on to the next topic and I'm like really is that all there is to say is let's slam on what you cost you know yeah I mean like they didn't do you any favors with the code being like so spartan at the beginning but here's a deal like lineman is not going to stop like the man is in it he's only on it if we believe what George said that I'm I don't know what I'm going to do.

[01:26:10] And the thing about lineman that people don't get he's what he does is just as much as an art form is like you know Chris what you're doing like he will he writes code for the game and he plays it he plays it for a while and if he doesn't like it he starts over like he's not just coding to a deadline and that's why his games are so damn good and like here's what I think is going to ultimately end up happening I think the game is going to really wake up when by the time he's done with it people are going to really love it.

[01:26:39] When that happens the game the value of the game is even going to go up even more people are going to want them even more and there's going to be you know people are going to hold on to them because it's just that kind of like theme that people love and lineman's going to make it I think saying that like do I think the super

[01:26:57] release are worth 15 grand no but I don't think any pinballs really worth 15 grand in terms of like the materials or anything like that it's worth 15 grand because you know what to some of my multi millionaire friends I know out there who love the show Batman 66 is priceless to them and have it in the living room or the game room when they wake up in the morning makes them happy and you're going to tell someone like that like you can't even put a price tag on it for people like that so they have exactly over the money.

[01:27:25] Yeah and that's one group of people that everybody in the pinball community seem to forget was that there's not only pinball collectors there's Batman collectors out there and it's one thing that that I can you know go to sleep at night feeling good about is the fact that I know for a fact that I had made every single 66 Batman fan happy with that machine and that's all that matters yeah I may not have pleased all the pinball fans but I know every single Batman fan.

[01:27:55] It was just like a wet dream come true right and that's all that matters you know I whenever people come over my apartment and they see a pinball machine their eyes light up people jump on magic or they're even people 99% of the world doesn't even know what pinball code is.

[01:28:10] They're they're just like trying to keep the ball from draining and sometimes you know ignorance is bliss because to those people they enjoy the art they enjoy the lights they enjoy the enjoy like almost everything and they're not nit picking.

[01:28:22] The one or two things that drive O city Pinsiders crazy well Chris look I really appreciate you reaching out I'm sorry for the few times we miss doing this interview and I'm actually glad I miss the last scheduled time because I got drunk.

[01:28:38] And bad and like I told you like I just fell asleep after like two bottles of socky and I wake up in the next day and Chris Chris gives me this email that's like what the fuck do you like I get.

[01:28:48] I'm not going to be the best is email like we had this time I and I felt so bad because it was like the third time we scheduled it and I passed out so this has been great because I'm 100% sober we made it happen this is going to be we're going to put this up Friday I'll be the nice weekend podcast that always gets a ton of lessons and I'll probably do a little intro because I know that AC DC tomorrow is coming the announcement right another AC DC thought that we need more of them but that's not the best thing.

[01:29:17] But that's what keeping the manufacturing line going.

[01:29:22] You know me.

[01:29:23] How did I know about that from your podcast that I listened to two hours ago.

[01:29:27] Right.

[01:29:28] But the time people here to be like well today's got old news I'm always I'm always trying to figure out when is this going to air and then what will I know by the time this airs

[01:29:37] and then what will happen but but these are great people love these interviews and I and I really appreciate the stories you've told Chris I think everyone who listens to this who has a Batman 66 is going to feel even better about it and even more excited for what's to come with that game and and I look forward to seeing that game fully wake up so that it's all it's all there in the future for you.

[01:29:59] Yeah. Yeah. It's I think it's going to be fantastic.

[01:30:02] I'm in has got more passion than anybody I know what he does.

[01:30:07] He's he's not going to let that go. He's not going to put it to sleep until it's the way he wants it.

[01:30:13] And yeah and I'm looking for the forward to the future to the the I've got I mean the midst of two two big projects and my hand is in the fire for about three other ones.

[01:30:27] Wow and and I can say that some of these are are going to be very very exciting.

[01:30:34] Oh this is you know part of collecting and loving pinballs the anticipation of what's to come it's when you just you can just say that and people are like

[01:30:43] ah I know I don't get this stuff coming up.

[01:30:49] Oh nobody gives me much info I get like I get snid bits from like distributors and whatnot that are like in like other parts of the world.

[01:30:58] And I'm like I can't verify this stuff and like and like because the thing is most of it never really comes true.

[01:31:04] So I'm like I don't believe any of it anymore. But but Chris what I do believe is you've done a good thing with Batman.

[01:31:10] The game's going to wake up when Lyman finishes it and we look forward to your next stuff.

[01:31:15] I think you've satiated Batman 66 fans. I think you've wet the appetite with some of the little things you dropped on this podcast about what's to come.

[01:31:24] So it's an exciting time to be in Pimble and I think you're joining Pimble at the best possible time because the resurgence is happening and the emphasis on hand drawn artwork and great artwork is on the top of people's list.

[01:31:38] So you couldn't be joining this this game at a better time.

[01:31:42] Yeah absolutely and remember for all the naysayers out there my work is hand drawn it starts off hand drawn.

[01:31:50] I say you know I may add stuff and I may do backgrounds in Photoshop because it's a lot easier.

[01:31:55] You know to do some you know radial lines and Photoshop and it is to hand dry don't see the point doing that but.

[01:32:02] Yeah it's all it's all hand crafted it's not a lot of people thought even those faces on the play field were.

[01:32:10] We're just photos and because once you shrink something down that small you lose all the details.

[01:32:16] Yeah put a lot of care into what I do I do not care what the property is.

[01:32:22] I don't want to say that you know Batman was a labor of love and you know now that I'm in I'm just going to do a hack job on everything else.

[01:32:30] I think pinball is far too fantastic to blow an opportunity to hack anything and I think people are really going to enjoy what.

[01:32:40] Well what's coming from from stern and myself I don't want to say myself because I know some of the other stuff.

[01:32:47] Damn it I you know the worst person to keep secrets to.

[01:32:51] It's killing me it's killing me well well what is we get today was fantastic and I think that's going to really surprise a lot of people.

[01:33:00] And this is news of like a new stern game down the road.

[01:33:04] It's a yeah Kapow stern.

[01:33:08] God damn it.

[01:33:10] Everyone's going to go everyone's going to just go start researching like what slot machines Kapow has and then make their guesses.

[01:33:17] I'm almost positive not to burst your bubble but I'm almost positive that they do not make a slot machine of this.

[01:33:25] I've never seen it and I just I just gambled my ass off in Vegas like I'm almost like I did.

[01:33:31] You just saved me a bunch of time then.

[01:33:34] Alright well Chris I really appreciate you coming on.

[01:33:37] You got the best you have the best first name on the planet and we'll do this again soon.

[01:33:42] I look forward to it because you're you're going to keep going and we'll keep doing this podcast and anytime you want to be a guest of the show just hit me up and we'll make it happen.

[01:33:50] Well I'll see if I got something interesting to talk about I want to waste your time but yeah if I do most definitely.

[01:33:56] Alright Chris.

[01:33:58] Anybody in the Michigan area that hears this on Friday I will be at the Motor City Comic Con in Novay.

[01:34:05] I'm a special art guest well I'm an artist there not special but I will be there and I will and I actually have some pretty cool canvases that I made with the Batman Pinball art.

[01:34:16] Cool.

[01:34:17] I will go through a couple of those special limited edition things so anyway thanks very much for having me.

[01:34:22] Yeah.

[01:34:23] I enjoy.

[01:34:24] Enjoy your podcasts.

[01:34:26] If it makes you feel any better you're part of what I do because as I'm sitting here even now working on one of my pinball designs I listen to your podcast so you're you're in there somewhere.

[01:34:38] Alright I appreciate it. Hopefully it's entertaining.

[01:34:41] I think it's I think it is.

[01:34:43] What's entertaining part of your podcast is when you use a third person thing.

[01:34:48] We're nice.

[01:34:49] Canada.

[01:34:50] That's another person.

[01:34:52] Well thank you I appreciate I thank you for listening and I thank you for for reaching out so Chris have a great night and we'll talk to you soon.

[01:35:00] Thanks Chris you too buddy take it easy.

[01:35:02] Bye bye.

[01:35:03] Bye bye.

[01:35:04] Alright well we want to thank Chris for joining the show and I think he shed a lot of tremendous light on what it was like making Batman 66.

[01:35:12] I think he added to the story of the machine and I think that's what everybody wants.

[01:35:17] They want to know as much about the machine they have as they can and I think those stories of what it was like creating it even if he had to rush it in a few months and get as much together as he could under an unbelievable timeline.

[01:35:31] It adds to the story and I think it sets people's minds a little bit more at ease and I think Stern has learned a lesson.

[01:35:39] I think they really have I think they know now.

[01:35:42] Hand draw on artwork get it in early as possible give these artists time to make these games look as good as possible because these things are going to live in people's homes for decades.

[01:35:52] You get one chance to make a game look incredible.

[01:35:56] Okay we want to thank Chris we want to thank him for joining the show and we want you guys to have a good week in Pimble.

[01:36:03] I think this is going to be an interesting week I really do.

[01:36:05] I kind of think we're going to see something on Star Wars on Thursday and I'll probably be wrong again.

[01:36:11] Have a great Monday and we'll talk to you soon.
