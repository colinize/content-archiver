[00:00] You want answers? I think I'm entitled. You want answers. I want the truth. You can't handle the truth.

[00:06] Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon.

[00:10] Ah, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:12] Canada's Candidate Take on the pinball industry.

[00:16] Five days, five shows.

[00:18] I'm gonna talk about every single one of the top five companies in pinball.

[00:22] We're gonna talk about what they're doing right, what they should continue, what they should start doing,

[00:28] and what they should stop doing.

[00:30] And I'm also gonna give each company a letter grade.

[00:34] And I can trust you, this ain't gonna be no distributor giving everything a B to be minus.

[00:39] We're gonna actually give accurate number grades to these companies.

[00:44] And we're gonna look at these companies as honestly as I think I've ever looked at them.

[00:49] And we're gonna start with Sturm Pinball. We gotta start with number one.

[00:52] And I was thinking about this. How do you critique Sturm Pinball?

[00:55] How do you critique a company that is seemingly doing everything almost perfectly?

[01:01] They make the most pinball machines.

[01:03] They've made more pinball machines than the history of pinball probably combined.

[01:08] They get the best themes in all of pinball.

[01:11] They crank out two to three games a year.

[01:14] When they hit their capacity, they're gonna be at a thousand games a week.

[01:18] By the time they reveal a game, it's already on the line.

[01:21] And they have such variety, whether you want music pins or comic books or movies or TV shows.

[01:29] They give you everything you want.

[01:31] So if you don't like one Sturm Pinball machine, you don't have to wait two years to get another option.

[01:37] In just three to four months, they're gonna bring out something else you might like.

[01:41] And they arguably have the greatest talent in all of pinball.

[01:45] So let me start out by saying this. The reason why I think Sturm Pinball dominates the pinball world.

[01:51] And why this company is so successful is one simple thing.

[01:56] They have above and beyond and by far the greatest talent in the industry.

[02:03] They have the greatest designers.

[02:05] They've got many of them, not just one designer.

[02:08] They've got the greatest coding team.

[02:11] They've got the greatest artwork in the history of pinball.

[02:14] And the greatest artist in the history of pinball in Zambietti.

[02:19] And they also have by far the greatest manufacturing team imaginable.

[02:25] The men and women who are on the line over at Sturm Pinball are the most talented people in the history of pinball.

[02:32] Of putting games together.

[02:34] It's not to take anything away from the Balli Williams error, but this company is just cranking out machines.

[02:40] And this is where they win.

[02:41] The front lines of pinball is all about manufacturing.

[02:45] Gary Stern would always say this.

[02:47] I do not run a pinball company.

[02:49] I run a manufacturing company.

[02:51] And everyone else is crawling to the finish line as Stern Pinball sprints around that pinball lap time and time again.

[03:00] All right.

[03:00] So Stern Pinball has so much going for it.

[03:03] They also have the smartest man in all of pinball.

[03:07] And that is Mr. George Gomez.

[03:10] He runs Stern Pinball.

[03:12] And I've always said this.

[03:13] If you ask this of every other company,

[03:15] what answer do you come up with?

[03:17] Who is the George Gomez over at Jersey Jack Pinball?

[03:21] Who is the George Gomez over at American Pinball?

[03:23] Who is the George Gomez over at Spooky Pinball?

[03:26] You don't really have an answer.

[03:28] But when you ask who's the George Gomez at Stern Pinball, the good news is it's George Gomez.

[03:33] And nobody is smarter than this man.

[03:36] Nobody understands the business of pinball more than George Gomez.

[03:40] And as long as George Gomez is at the helm of Stern Pinball,

[03:44] this company will continue to clobber everybody else.

[03:49] Nobody will even come close.

[03:51] And look at the players that George Gomez put on the field.

[03:55] Zombie Eddie, Keith Elwin, Brian Eddy, John Borg, Jack Freakin' Danger.

[04:03] Right?

[04:03] This design team over at Stern Pinball can do almost no wrong.

[04:08] And they just keep getting better and better and better with each game.

[04:11] And they also got a guy called George Gomez designing games as well.

[04:15] Now look, I don't love every one of Stern's designs.

[04:18] I have my favorites.

[04:19] I have games I don't like.

[04:21] Let's start out with what Stern is doing right.

[04:23] Besides putting the best talent on the field, what Stern does better than everybody else

[04:29] is they get themes people want.

[04:32] They win the pinball war at the theme level.

[04:35] And they've got such a great variety of themes.

[04:39] Let me just go down a list of the top like 30 games and let's call out the ones that

[04:45] are Stern machines.

[04:46] Godzilla, Foo Fighters, Jurassic Park, Deadpool, Iron Maiden, Star Trek, Elvira, Lord of the Rings,

[04:55] we've got Metallica, we've got Rush, Stranger Things, Avengers, AC DC, Batman 66, and Spider-Man.

[05:05] Just look at those themes together.

[05:08] Those are some unbelievable themes.

[05:11] And so what Stern pinball does so well is they just give you such a great variety of

[05:16] pinball machines and they have something for everybody.

[05:19] And that is why Stern pinball is so damn successful is they just have something for everybody.

[05:25] And the other thing they do right is if they don't get the assets, they don't give you this

[05:30] half ass version of the theme.

[05:32] Look at what they did with Jurassic Park.

[05:35] They didn't have the movie assets, but they made a great pinball machine.

[05:39] They made a great Jurassic Park adventure.

[05:41] They didn't give you just a little bit of what you wanted.

[05:44] They gave you a whole entire experience that was just different.

[05:48] Now look, would I like to have the movie clips in the game?

[05:52] Absolutely.

[05:53] Do I think Stern pinball is saving money by not even trying to get that stuff?

[05:58] Absolutely.

[05:59] Do I believe George Gomez that they could not get the real Jeep into the game?

[06:04] No, I don't.

[06:05] Why would Jeep not want their product in the game?

[06:08] Come on.

[06:08] They just don't want to spend the money.

[06:10] And so it's Stern pinball has also done so well.

[06:14] And this is Stern pinball's greatest achievement of all time.

[06:19] They got all of us to be suckers and spend $10,000 now on premium machines that they can make an

[06:28] unlimited amount of.

[06:30] And this is Stern pinball's greatest feat ever in the history of pinball.

[06:34] They basically gaslighted the entire pinball collecting world.

[06:39] They gaslighted the entire pinball community into thinking that a premium machine is worth $10,000.

[06:47] And the moment they did that, they continued to turn on the gas lights by charging us $13,000 for an

[06:55] LE machine.

[06:56] And the greatest move they ever made, not just in raising the prices of these games,

[07:01] they also doubled the volume of limited edition games, ostensibly not even making them that limited.

[07:08] And now people are spending $13,000 on a Stern LE in which they will make $1,000 of and nobody's

[07:16] complaining.

[07:17] I think they sold Foo Fighters out in record time.

[07:21] And what's going to happen when they have a title like Back to the Future or Jaws or a Triple A

[07:26] game?

[07:27] The games are going to sell out in less than 30 seconds.

[07:30] And do we think Stern is done raising the prices on games?

[07:33] I mean, they might take this thing all the way up to $15,000, but here's the other thing.

[07:39] They don't even have to take it up to $15,000 and mirror Jersey Jack pinball because Stern pinball

[07:44] also has wisely not included a topper on their game.

[07:50] So if you want a Stern LE and a topper, you're going to be spending $14,000 to $15,000 and that's

[07:57] not even including all of the accessories they will sell you.

[08:02] Let's just ask ourselves this right now.

[08:03] Do you actually think the Stern bomb on a game has doubled, but they have now doubled the price of

[08:10] a game?

[08:11] And we know that the Stern bomb like six years ago used to be like $3,500 a machine.

[08:17] So let's just say it's even like $5,000 a bomb on a game right now.

[08:21] And now they're charging $13,000.

[08:24] And this is the thing, right?

[08:25] As I analyze Stern pinball, they have been so smart in what they've been doing.

[08:31] They have been so smart in realizing if we just get great themes, make the artwork beautiful,

[08:39] make the code look amazing.

[08:40] And their code is the best looking code in all of pinball right now.

[08:44] We can charge whatever and we don't even have to engineer much magic anymore underneath the

[08:51] glass.

[08:52] Now look, certain games have the magic like Godzilla's got a lot in it.

[08:56] Foo Fighters doesn't really have much in it.

[08:59] Here's the crazy part.

[09:00] Foo Fighters LE is 30% more money than Godzilla LE was.

[09:06] Is there 30% more in the game?

[09:09] It actually looks like there's 30% less in the game and we're spending 30% more.

[09:15] Now look, Stern is going to continue to do this.

[09:18] They don't have to stop anything.

[09:20] What we need to do as consumers is we probably at some point need to stop buying all these things

[09:28] site unseen and stop throwing money at these games or else the prices are going to just keep

[09:35] going up and up and up.

[09:37] And do you really want to spend $15,000 on a single machine?

[09:43] Do you really want to spend $45,000 on three Stern LEs?

[09:50] Just think about that number.

[09:52] They don't want you to think about it like that.

[09:55] Distributors don't want you to think about it like that.

[09:57] And as much as I love pinball and as much as I love this industry and this hobby,

[10:03] there is no way to justify these machines giving that much value.

[10:08] The experience is just not there.

[10:11] I would rather go get a Honda Civic Type R than have three Stern LEs.

[10:18] Yes, I used a car argument.

[10:20] All right, so look, Stern has been genius in their marketing plans and getting money out of us.

[10:25] But here's the thing that I'm worried about.

[10:27] And again, I said this is going to be Canada's candidate take on these companies.

[10:30] My biggest fear of Stern pinball is simply this.

[10:33] I think they're going to flood the market with too much product.

[10:36] I think they're going to flood the market with too many premiums.

[10:40] And I think they're going to make too much of everything because think about it.

[10:43] If they move into this new factory and they can make a thousand games a week,

[10:48] let's say the factory is on 50 weeks out of the year,

[10:52] that's 50,000 pinball machines they're going to put into the marketplace every single year.

[10:58] And how many people are still clamoring for premiums of Jurassic Park,

[11:03] of this game, of that game, of Star Wars, it's going to get to the point now where

[11:07] everyone who buys a Stern machine because they're going to make so many of them,

[11:11] you're not just going to lose $500 anymore.

[11:14] You're going to be losing two to $3,000 because of the amount of inventory that's going to be in the

[11:20] marketplace. And I don't think people are ready for that.

[11:23] You're not ready to lose $9,000 on three pinball purchases.

[11:28] There's no way. And what's going to happen is we're going to get back to where it used to be.

[11:32] A lot of people are just going to wait. A lot of people are going to buy games second hand

[11:36] and you're not going to rush and buy everything new in box because what's going to happen with

[11:41] these premiums now that they're $10,000 a pop, you're going to easily be able to get one for

[11:47] like 8,000 after six months or a year. So do you really want to spend $2,000 on a cardboard box?

[11:55] And this is just Stern. I mean, think about this industry for a minute.

[11:58] If just Stern puts 50,000 games into the pinball marketplace a year, that's not even taking into

[12:05] account the 12 other companies trying to sell you pinball machines. Absolutely. This industry

[12:12] is oversaturated. If you put it all on a piece of paper, you're like, there's no way there is enough

[12:18] demand for all of these companies to be in existence. And look, I think only four to five

[12:24] companies are actually going to survive over the next four years. And I think Stern will absolutely

[12:29] survive, but they also have the most at stake. They have the most employees. They have the most

[12:35] overhead. And I think Stern needs to be very careful. And here's my advice. I think Stern does

[12:40] need to stop raising the prices. I think they need to stop being greedy. I think they need to stop it.

[12:47] I think when people see stuff like Godzilla toppers, I get they're going to sell them,

[12:51] but I think they're going to turn off more and more people. And as more and more people start to

[12:56] get turned off to pinball, I think more and more people are going to be priced out of this hobby

[13:02] versus new people coming into the hobby thinking the price is no object. And that's my thing.

[13:08] I think Stern has got it really good right now. I think they could stay at these prices. This is

[13:14] it. I think this should be the ceiling. I don't think we should be spending any more for these games.

[13:19] And I don't care what the theme is, even if it's back to the future, don't charge us 15 or 17,

[13:24] 5, don't do it. They need to start passing the value on to their customers again. Imagine if

[13:30] they sold Batman SLE today, right? Remember when it was $15,000 and everybody went nuts?

[13:37] Imagine if they sold just 80 of those games today, they would probably charge us 25, 30,000 for them.

[13:45] And the sad part is they would probably sell because some of you crazy whales out there just

[13:51] want to show Stern Pinball how much money you got and they will happily take your money. So I think

[13:56] Stern needs to stop raising the prices. I also think Stern needs to start putting more mechanical

[14:03] stuff into the games. As much as I love Foo Fighters, I played it again yesterday. I still look down

[14:10] on it and still want to see a little bit more mechanical stuff engineered in these games.

[14:17] And look, it's Foo Fighters, it's a music pin. It's not really a theme where like a mechanical

[14:23] thing is missing. So I think when we see Jaws from Keith Elwyn, we're going to see an incredible

[14:30] mechanism with that shark. I think when we get back to the future, we're going to see some incredible

[14:36] mechs in the game. And I think if we get Indiana Jones, we might also see more incredible stuff.

[14:41] And I think Venom is going to be another one that has a really, really radical Venom head that like

[14:46] the tongue comes out and everything. You know, I expect Stern to keep bringing the creativity,

[14:51] but I really would like to see more for this much money. And that's my indictment across the board

[14:56] of all of these companies is for this much money, you got to bring it or my money is staying in my

[15:02] wallet. The other area that we don't talk about a lot on this podcast, but it really is the other

[15:07] area where Stern is dominating everybody else. And that's with Stern Insider Connected. The Stern

[15:13] Insider Connected is a really, really great thing that they rolled out into the pinball world.

[15:18] Nobody else has come even close to creating a community around gameplay, right? And achievements.

[15:24] And I love what Stern has done with Insider Connected. And I think it's brought a lot of people

[15:29] together in pinball. And I think they should continue to improve upon it. But I think it's

[15:35] such an awesome move. What I would like to see Stern start to do is start to make more modes

[15:41] that are versus modes with these games. So I can play with my friends and we can play the game

[15:47] together at the same time. I'm still surprised nobody has even thought about how to do that.

[15:53] Like you could make really fun versus modes in pinball. And I would love to see Stern connect

[15:59] their games like that and have unique modes. Enough of these unique modes with toppers. I

[16:03] want them to stop that. Stop this DLC if you buy the topper. I hate that move. I think it's lazy.

[16:11] And we see what they're doing, right? They're like, they'll let you play the final wizard mode

[16:15] if you spend a thousand or $2,000 on a topper. That's not creative. And they're just doing that

[16:21] because they know the rich collectors, most of them suck at pinball. So they want to get you

[16:26] in bed with the supermodel without having to do the work or have any game at the bar. But no,

[16:32] these things should be reached based on your achievement. You should have to earn the right

[16:37] to see the final wizard mode in a pinball machine. And I think cutting the line because you have money

[16:43] is pathetic. And I think they need to stop that. And you heard it here. If you're using these things

[16:48] to see the final wizard mode in your games, you, sir, need to get better at pinball. It's like

[16:54] sleeping with a prostitute. Nobody brags about sleeping with a prostitute because you paid for

[16:59] it. And that's what the DLC content is on these stern toppers. What else is stern doing? Right.

[17:05] I mean, they're just knocking it out of the park in the artwork department.

[17:09] Zombie Eddie is crazy good. And I think he's now going to become an official member of the stern

[17:15] team. I think before now he was somewhat of still a hired gun for them. I think Jeremy Packard is

[17:20] going to start to get more equity in this company and in the games he makes. And I think he deserves

[17:26] it. So I'm really happy if that's happening over there at stern pinball. But I can't wait to see

[17:31] his work on Venom. I think Jaws pinball is going to be Randy Martinez who did the Mandalorian.

[17:38] And then who knows, right? Who knows? Are we going to see back to the future as a capao title?

[17:42] And it's scary when you think about how many games stern has sold recently. And they're arguably

[17:48] B themes. These aren't A themes. Like Rush is not an A theme. Foo Fighters is not an A theme. James

[17:54] Bond, I don't know. Not really. Kind of like the old James Bond. Who knows? Maybe possibly. The other

[18:00] thing stern needs to stop doing is not pricing their games. This call for price BS. I hope they

[18:08] never do it again. Stern, just put a price on something so we can either say great price,

[18:14] it's worth it, or we can point at you and laugh and say, do you think we are idiots?

[18:19] Like it was so pathetic that they put a price on James Bond 60th on their website of $19,995.

[18:28] And then they quickly removed the price and then said call for price. Like that's so pathetic.

[18:33] Just stand behind your pricing stern. Don't get greedy. The only thing that can kill the golden

[18:39] goose with stern pinball is their own greed. They are their own worst enemy and they need to stop

[18:46] being greedy because I mean it. That is this company's Achilles heel. If they get too greedy

[18:53] consistently, people are going to walk away. And the thing they have to worry about go on the pinball

[18:59] marketplace. There are thousands of games for sale. Like I don't need to buy a new and box stern game

[19:05] ever again. I don't ever have to give stern pinball more money because there are so many

[19:10] games out there available to buy that I don't need to chase the greed. Problem in the second hand

[19:16] market if you go on the marketplace is now everybody's a greedy bastard. I mean every single game is

[19:21] now like over $10,000. Every single LE is like 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 thousand dollars. I don't know what

[19:29] happened, but I think this community needs to get together and stop ripping each other off.

[19:35] Like it's so weird. We all got greedy. COVID turned us all into greedy jerks. And I used to love this

[19:43] hobby when we would buy a game and if we flipped it, we flipped it for a thousand or two dollars more.

[19:48] Like we were happy making a thousand or two thousand dollar profit on a Ghostbusters LE.

[19:54] Now if you get a game that's a hot game, I don't want a thousand or two. I'm going to ask 10,000

[19:59] more than I paid. What happened to all of us? And I don't know if there's any going back,

[20:04] but that's the other thing that's happening is people are just getting burnt out by these prices.

[20:10] So in summary, stern pinball will continue to clobber everybody. They have the most talent.

[20:18] They manufacture efficiently. They have the best talent in the design department, in the art

[20:24] department, in the code department, in the manufacturing department. And they're the only pinball

[20:30] company whose George Gomez is actually George Gomez. So if I were to give Stern a rating on a grade

[20:38] scale, I would give Stern pinball an A rating. They are an A. They are like a 94% out of 100.

[20:46] They are pretty much doing everything right. I didn't even mention their games are probably the

[20:52] best quality. With the amount of games they send out, they barely have any issues. Their spike

[20:59] two system is great. The nodeboards are easy to pop in and out if you have issues. Everything they've

[21:06] done, they thought about the marathon. They didn't try to win the sprint. And then they gaslighted us.

[21:12] I mean, they freaking gaslighted us. The fact that a premium is $10,000 should he

[21:18] enrage this community? Instead, we've got all of these content creators like celebrating this fact.

[21:24] I mean, Stern Trojan horse all of us. They gaslit all of us. And I have to give them an A grade

[21:31] because I would have done the same thing if I were them. Because they looked at each and every

[21:37] one of us and said, Hey, we've got a bunch of suckers that'll spend $10,000 on something that

[21:44] used to cost $6,000. And we're not even going to put much more into the machines. I mean, that was

[21:51] genius. Well done, Stern. You get an A from Canada. You're going to continue to clobber everybody.

[21:57] And you have no competition. I mean, this company has a monopoly on pinball. And if I were to go

[22:04] work for any pinball company, I would go work for Stern. I mean, these guys are where it's at.

[22:10] And there are not many weaknesses with Stern pinball. And the only thing they need to be careful of

[22:15] is themselves. So Stern, keep the prices where they're at, keep giving us amazing themes,

[22:22] and let your incredible designers do their thing. And we're going to be very, very happy in pinball.

[22:28] Everybody have a great day. We're going to be back tomorrow with my take on Jersey Jack pinball.

[22:34] You're not going to want to miss that one. I could tell you right now they're not going to get an A. Later.
