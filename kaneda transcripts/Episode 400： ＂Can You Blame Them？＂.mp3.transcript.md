[00:00] Did you ever think we'd make it this far?

[00:04] To 400 episodes of Canadian Pimball Podcasts.

[00:09] From being banned from Pintside years ago, being called an internet troll that nobody

[00:15] would listen to, we would just fade away.

[00:19] And all of a sudden we've got the number one Pimball Podcasts two years in a row.

[00:23] And I think we started a commentary on this hobby that was very important and I know

[00:28] that you love it.

[00:29] I know that it resonates with so many of you out there.

[00:33] I know the manufacturers respect this show even if they won't come on the show.

[00:38] And I just want to thank all of you as we get kicking off to this episode 400 with a little

[00:44] guns and effing roses.

[00:45] I want to thank all of you who listen to this show on a weekly basis.

[00:50] You know who you are.

[00:51] All 2500 to 3000 of you who actually tune in.

[00:55] I actually want to thank to you all of you guys out there who don't admit to listening

[01:00] to this show but you listen to every single show.

[01:03] You know who you are as well.

[01:04] Thank you so much for the support.

[01:06] I want to thank all of you guys who donate to the Patreon page of Canadian Pimball Podcasts.

[01:11] Brenda and I have had some amazing meals thanks to you guys.

[01:14] So keep up the donations.

[01:16] I want to thank all the Pimball companies out there.

[01:19] I mean without them this show wouldn't exist and none of us would have anything to fall

[01:24] in love with and stuff to bitch about on a weekly basis.

[01:27] So thank you to all the manufacturers and all the hard working men and women at those

[01:33] companies that wake up every day and make Pimball machines for us in 2019.

[01:39] We truly appreciate it.

[01:41] I want to thank all the Pimball media guys out there and Twitch streamers and everyone

[01:46] who wakes up and gives a lot of their time on a daily basis to make Pimball content for

[01:53] you for free.

[01:55] Most of us make absolutely no money doing this.

[01:58] I want to thank all of them because it is a very very selfless profession to go into.

[02:04] So thank you guys and I especially want to thank all the Pimball Podcasts out there that

[02:08] take the first five to ten minutes to talk about their weekends and what they had for

[02:13] breakfast because without those guys I might not win a third trippy, right?

[02:18] I want to thank all the guests of Canadian Pimball Podcasts.

[02:21] We've had a lot of guests over the years that were really amazing.

[02:24] I want to thank guys like Jerry at P3 that come on and answer all the tough questions.

[02:29] I want to thank Jersey Jack for coming on.

[02:32] George Gomez, the black knight who's given us so much good Pimball history on this show.

[02:38] I want to thank Ted.

[02:39] Can't forget Ted or Blake Duneus-Mill, great artist down there in Texas.

[02:44] Blake, we love you.

[02:45] Who else we've had Larry, Dr. Frightner, kind of crazy new guy.

[02:49] We all love and hate at the same time.

[02:52] We've had a lot of great guests.

[02:53] Craig Bohn, I can't even mention them all.

[02:55] You know, but I just want to say thanks to Nick Parks, right?

[02:58] All the great information he gave us over the years.

[03:01] We've tried to give you guys a mixture of my insanity and some great insights from people

[03:07] out in the Pimball world.

[03:08] So thank you to all the guests of the show.

[03:11] I need to thank all of my distributor friends out there in the Pimball world.

[03:15] Without you guys, I wouldn't get inside information that you're not supposed to give the show.

[03:20] I mean, I love distributors.

[03:22] Everyone from Zach Manny to Chris and Melissa at Pointtaker to JJ at Game Exchange.

[03:28] You know, Nick Parks, you know, Pimball distributors without them, right?

[03:33] Who would have our backs in this Pimball world when things go wrong with machines?

[03:36] And so thank you to all of you out there who set up our Pimball machines for us.

[03:40] I need to thank my twin brother who made all the music mixes that you guys love.

[03:45] I want to thank Mr. Bill Brandis out there from Canada for keeping me grounded all the time on Facebook.

[03:52] You know, Bill's a great friend.

[03:53] He came in my wedding, but he's also the kind of guy where I can hit up at three in the morning

[03:58] and just chat Pimball on Facebook.

[04:00] And he keeps me from making terrible financial decisions.

[04:04] I want to thank Ed Robertson for always being a fan of the show

[04:08] and always giving me great commentary via text.

[04:11] And for inviting me to go backstage at his concert, that was awesome.

[04:15] And finally, I just want to thank the most important to people in my life.

[04:19] Besides my mom and dad, that's Bubba and Brenda.

[04:22] They're love and especially Brenda.

[04:25] She understands this hobby and how much I love it.

[04:27] And she is so understanding when I wake up in the morning

[04:32] and I put on this headset and microphone and I kick her out of the bedroom

[04:35] while she's trying to get ready.

[04:37] And even though she rolls her eyes at times when she sees me spend

[04:41] exorbitance amounts of money on these games, she's so supportive.

[04:45] And I thank her so much.

[04:46] And those of you who know, when you have the right partner in life,

[04:49] they actually enjoy watching you get enjoyment out of silly, silly things like Pimball.

[04:56] So Brenda, I love you.

[04:58] Thank you so much.

[04:59] Let's get episode 400 started.

[05:02] The theme of this episode is can you blame them?

[05:05] This is going to be a fun little romp.

[05:07] So strapping kids episode 400 of Canada's Pimball is about to begin.

[05:26] All right, episode 400 of Canada's Pimball podcast entitled Can You Blame Them?

[05:32] And what we're going to do with no notes, with no scripting,

[05:36] with nothing else other than what pops into my head.

[05:39] I'm going to go down a list of things in this hobby in which I think we asked the question,

[05:44] can you blame them for doing that?

[05:46] Right? So let's start right away.

[05:48] Can you blame Stern Pimball for charging $15,000 for Elvira signature limited edition machine?

[05:57] Of course, we can't blame them.

[05:59] What a smart, genius move by George Gomez and company to price this machine that high.

[06:05] And can you blame them?

[06:06] And here's why because they know that there are more than 50 multi-millionaires,

[06:12] probably not even all millionaires, people out there who love Elvira so much that are willing,

[06:18] willing to pay $15,000 for upgrades that probably cost them.

[06:25] Are you ready for it?

[06:26] Probably cost them no more than $500, $2,000 because here's what's amazing about the Pimball

[06:34] hobby is everybody has memory loss.

[06:37] Do people forget that what Nick Park said, that Stern's bomb, let's say Stern's bomb on

[06:42] Elvira is $3,000 to $4,000.

[06:46] Okay, let's see, let's just give them the benefit of the doubt.

[06:49] Let's say it costs Stern Pimball $5,000 to make Elvira Pimball machine.

[06:55] Can you blame them that they know that there are enough suckers out there that would spend

[07:02] $10,000 more than it costs to make that specific machine all because they're going to put a little

[07:11] plaque on it that says one out of 50.

[07:15] That's it.

[07:16] Can you blame them that they would leave that kind of money on the table knowing that collectors

[07:21] are also somewhat suckers because they need to have something limited.

[07:28] But also here's the other part.

[07:30] Can you blame the collectors that can't sleep at night until they get one of these 50 machines

[07:37] because here's what goes on on the other side of the fence within the mind of the collector.

[07:41] The collector guy, all he wants to do is say one thing to all of his friends and this is

[07:47] why I think all 50 of those games are going to sell out immediately when they're when we

[07:51] see all the details and the stuff in living high-res color.

[07:55] Here's what's going on in their head.

[07:57] Can you blame these guys when all they want to say to their pinball buddies when they come

[08:01] over is one simple thing.

[08:04] This is the best version of the game available.

[08:06] That's all they want to say.

[08:08] They want to say there's no better version and then they want to say there's only 50 of

[08:13] them.

[08:14] Can you blame Stern for using what I think is the smartest marketing tactic in the world?

[08:20] When they tell people half of these are going overseas.

[08:24] There's really only 25 of them in America and then they can even go deeper.

[08:29] That means there's not even enough for one of these Elvira's per state.

[08:33] Oh my god.

[08:35] They layer on the fear of missing out sales tactics so hard and guess what?

[08:42] Everybody falls for it.

[08:43] I just talked to a distributor that has already sold two out of his three Elvira SLEs.

[08:51] Two people have already committed to spending $15,000 on a machine they never have even

[08:58] seen yet like the full thing and what are the features of the SLEs?

[09:02] I love it.

[09:03] I love this hobby.

[09:04] It's stupid.

[09:05] It's so stupid and it's actually probably really a name to try to make sense of it all

[09:10] but can you blame them?

[09:12] Also can you blame people who have a lot of money who just want something that makes them

[09:16] happy?

[09:17] On some level, if you think about all of this.

[09:21] Does it bother you that someone out there is brought pleasure by buying the best version

[09:30] of Elvira SLE?

[09:32] Look, that's all that matters.

[09:34] It's the best version even if it just has a hundred dollars more in foiled cabinet decals.

[09:40] To that person, just the ability to know they have the top of the line version that might

[09:46] just bring them happiness.

[09:48] Can you blame them if they've got millions of dollars and money doesn't matter and what

[09:55] they want is just something that puts a smile on their face.

[09:59] They wake up every day.

[10:00] They see that they have one of the 50 in the world and that makes them happy.

[10:05] Can you blame them for buying it?

[10:07] Can you blame them?

[10:08] What else can we look at in the Pimble World?

[10:10] Can you blame them?

[10:11] Can you blame Jerry at P3 for continuing to go down his multi-morphic dream path?

[10:18] Can't blame him?

[10:19] Guy had a dream.

[10:20] Guy wanted to do something different in Pimble.

[10:22] He didn't want to make things the way everybody else did.

[10:25] We went off and he created an entirely new Pimble platform.

[10:29] The other side of Jerry that we sometimes don't talk about is all the P-Rock work he did.

[10:34] Can you blame a guy that makes a system that has actually been the engine that has driven

[10:40] so much new Pimble creation?

[10:43] Can you blame a guy for actually making money on that side of the fence and then jumping

[10:48] over to the other side and just trying something completely radically new?

[10:52] Can't blame him.

[10:54] All of us can relate to falling in love with a dream and having a vision.

[10:59] Even if it doesn't come to fruition, even if it doesn't come commercially successful,

[11:04] can you blame people out there in the world that just want to zig where others zag?

[11:10] That just want to try something new that won't give up on a dream.

[11:15] There's something admirable in life about having a vision for something and not giving

[11:20] up on it.

[11:21] Look, if you can put food on the table and you can take care of his family, can you blame

[11:26] a guy that won't listen to all the marketing feedback that Kineeta keeps giving him about

[11:31] how to become commercially successful?

[11:33] I don't think we can.

[11:36] Can you blame Barry at Dutch Pimble for once again fooling everybody into thinking everything

[11:43] is going to be all right?

[11:44] Can you blame the guy?

[11:46] I mean, how many years does that guy get a second chance?

[11:50] How many newsletters can a guy put out and still convince people that it's going to work

[11:56] out in their favor?

[11:58] I would love to be in that position.

[12:00] Imagine if I went into work for years and didn't deliver on the things that my bosses

[12:06] paid me for and instead of delivering anything, I put out a Chris newsletter every four months

[12:12] in which I said, hey guys, hey boss, Arino dudes, hey, I just checked in and I ran the

[12:19] numbers on Chris's productivity coming up in the future and the numbers look good.

[12:23] I think you're going to get actually some work from Chris.

[12:26] Can you blame him?

[12:27] Can you blame him that he's allowed to do that?

[12:29] To just write a bunch of gobbly gook newsletters and install hope all over again.

[12:36] Can you blame Big Lebowski EA's for going along with it?

[12:41] How can you blame these guys?

[12:43] All they have is what Barry says they're money's gone.

[12:47] They've invested in them.

[12:48] What other choice does an EA have other than to stay on the train?

[12:53] There's nothing they can do other than sue.

[12:56] Can you blame them for not suing people?

[12:59] Everyone says like just sue, just sue, it's easy.

[13:02] It's going to cost money and it's really hard when you've been burned by someone like

[13:07] Barry and you lost your 8500 bucks.

[13:11] It's really hard then to add more money to those losses in the form of a lawsuit.

[13:17] Well maybe that's what class actions for.

[13:19] Can you blame them that they now have stock home syndrome and have to root for the guy

[13:24] that has caused them nothing but pain for three years?

[13:27] Can you blame the Big Lebowski flippers people?

[13:30] Let's talk about it.

[13:31] How can you blame people who just took advantage of a situation?

[13:35] All right.

[13:36] I know what you're saying.

[13:37] They're selling someone else's game but they're also opportunistic.

[13:41] So what?

[13:42] Who cares?

[13:43] What else was going to happen to these games?

[13:45] These games were going to go for sale either way.

[13:48] Even if you don't want that to be the case, that was always going to be the case.

[13:52] So can you blame guys like the one who came on my show and sold his Big Lebowski for $20,000

[13:57] and walked away?

[13:59] How can you blame them?

[14:00] The buyer's happy, the seller's happy, the only one who's not happy is the EA.

[14:06] But the EA was never going to get the game anyway.

[14:08] So can you blame them?

[14:10] Can you blame Rare Hero Greg Colton for unfriending Canadian on Facebook?

[14:15] He didn't just unfriend me.

[14:16] He blocked me from Facebook.

[14:19] This is a man I used to talk to every day for years and just buying a Big Lebowski sent

[14:25] him into a tailspinny which he won't even talk to me.

[14:28] So can you blame Greg?

[14:29] Maybe not.

[14:30] Maybe Greg is looking at me like I'm the ultimate hypocrite.

[14:33] But I need to tell Greg, if he still listens to the show, Greg we're all hypocrites on some

[14:37] level.

[14:38] I know Greg is democratic, he's very liberal and Greg someone could easily zoom out and

[14:44] look at your life and say, wait a minute, look at this guy, he's got enough money to buy

[14:49] an $8,500 pinball machine.

[14:51] How can you say you're a man of the people and helping others out that are in need?

[14:56] Why don't you donate that $8,500 Greg to like children in need and to cancer patients

[15:01] and to all the other things that you know, to plastic waste removal.

[15:05] See that's the thing about all of this.

[15:07] You can zoom out far enough and we're all hypocrites because we're all buying stuff that

[15:12] is for no greater good other than self pleasure.

[15:16] And here's the thing, I'm okay with that.

[15:18] You know, can you blame people for just wanting to have some fun in their lives in a world

[15:23] in which there's so much terrible news on a daily basis in a world in which so many

[15:28] of you personally are going through struggles and hard times.

[15:32] And I don't mean that just like financially because not all of you are going through

[15:36] financial hard times, but life is hard.

[15:39] Like Buddha was right.

[15:41] Life is filled with suffering.

[15:43] That is at the core of our existence, the moment we all realize and are self aware that

[15:48] we're going to die.

[15:50] That time is very short on this planet.

[15:53] We start to understand that life is a balance of how do I take care of myself and make

[15:58] myself happy and how do I give to others and how do I give to the world in a way in which

[16:04] what makes me feel fulfilled.

[16:07] And we're all part of that journey together in different ways, but also together.

[16:11] It's just the human existence.

[16:13] So can you blame people that just want to spoil themselves a little bit by buying a pinball

[16:18] toy that is non essential?

[16:21] And I think sometimes we're very critical of each other and we attack each other, but

[16:25] we're all on the same boat.

[16:26] We're all on the same reality show people that everyone else if you zoom out is looking

[16:31] at us like we're a bunch of losers.

[16:33] So maybe sometimes we should be a little bit nicer and understanding and look flipping

[16:37] stuff and trading things and profiteering on pinball games.

[16:42] That's all part of this hobby.

[16:44] Let me just say for a minute, it's part of every single collectible hobby.

[16:48] And you can cry about it or you can just accept that that's just the way a collectible

[16:53] hobby works.

[16:55] People will take advantage of situations in which they can make money and can you blame

[16:59] them?

[17:00] I don't think you really can.

[17:03] Can you blame Jersey Jack pinball for thinking that Canadian is a terrible person?

[17:09] Not really.

[17:10] Right?

[17:11] I mean, think about it if you're a jack.

[17:13] Put yourself in jack shoes.

[17:14] You're a jack.

[17:15] You are trying really hard to innovate pinball and push pinball further, right?

[17:20] You're trying to give people the best possible pinball experience that you can create in modern

[17:26] times.

[17:27] And for all intents and purposes, Jersey Jack pinball has pushed the envelope more than anybody.

[17:33] If it weren't for Jersey Jack games, Stern Games wouldn't be where they are today.

[17:37] And if it weren't for Jersey Jack games, we wouldn't have things like LCDs.

[17:40] We wouldn't have like great mechanisms in games.

[17:43] Paul was dying and pinball was getting really lazy and Jack showed us with the Wizard of

[17:48] Oz.

[17:49] You know what pinball could be?

[17:51] And he restored a lot of that Bally Williams magic.

[17:54] So can you blame him?

[17:55] That he invites a guy like canada into his pinball factory shows him a new game.

[17:59] That guy goes on and says how great the game is how we can't wait to buy one, how he wrote

[18:03] a check on the spot.

[18:05] And then a few weeks later he's slamming the product, right?

[18:08] Can you blame me?

[18:10] A pinball podcaster that is in nobody's back pocket for changing my mind, right?

[18:16] Don't lie to canada.

[18:17] Don't tell canada you have all the assets to the game when you don't.

[18:20] And if you don't, that's okay.

[18:22] I'm okay with that.

[18:23] See one simple thing, I just want the truth.

[18:27] Tell me the truth about what is happening with this game.

[18:31] Tell me the truth about the licensing hurdles.

[18:33] Tell me the truth about all of it.

[18:36] And I will be fair and respectful because what I'm not is a bad guy.

[18:41] What I'm not is a jerk.

[18:43] What I'm not is a terrible person because what I am is just someone who wants to know

[18:48] what's really going on and what's underneath the surface.

[18:52] And if you tell me the truth, I'll be fair.

[18:54] I'd be an idiot.

[18:55] I would be a jerk.

[18:56] I would be an a-hole.

[18:57] If I complained about lack of assets, if you did not even have access to those assets,

[19:03] okay?

[19:04] You blame me for changing my mind on that game, okay?

[19:09] Can you blame?

[19:10] Here's the one that's really sort of like, oh my god, like fire bells are going off in

[19:14] my head around this one.

[19:15] Can you blame the fact that people have already stopped talking about the clear code issues?

[19:23] I've never seen a community so quickly hoodwinked by the promise of a new game to stop asking

[19:31] the simple questions from the manufacturers and all of a sudden everyone's got stars

[19:35] in their eyes around El Vira and around what's new and around Jurassic Park Ellie.

[19:40] But nobody, and I mean all of you out there, and I mean all of you pinball podcasters and

[19:46] media and fans and hobbyists and pin-siders, nobody is asking for a conclusion on this

[19:53] whole story.

[19:54] None of the manufacturers have actually released an official statement about what the problem

[19:59] was and what the solve is.

[20:02] Everyone is just like, oh it's fixed overnight, it's fixed.

[20:05] Oh there's no artwork under the post.

[20:07] Oh there's no more any issues.

[20:08] Take my money now.

[20:10] Can you blame these manufacturers for never testing these products accurately before taking

[20:18] your money?

[20:19] They're doing the same thing all over again.

[20:21] So how has this been tested that just removing artwork from under the post solves everything?

[20:26] Is that going to solve the fact that what we heard from the experts was that the clear

[20:31] coat, if it's water-based is not as strong and it will pull and it will crack and it

[20:36] will dimple and all this stuff.

[20:38] So they fixed all that in like a couple of weeks just because artwork is removed.

[20:43] So what are you going to do?

[20:44] Can you blame the people who got refunded it, their Jersey Jack playfields that still have

[20:50] artwork under the post?

[20:51] So what about those people?

[20:53] They sent those people playfields and they still have artwork under the post.

[20:57] So clearly those playfields don't have the solution.

[21:01] And can you blame those people for still wanting an answer on whether or not they got a

[21:06] good playfield or if it's still a bad one?

[21:09] How can you blame these people?

[21:10] Right?

[21:11] It's crazy.

[21:12] It's crazy how quickly in today's society we give up.

[21:17] We give up in our search of the truth.

[21:19] We give up in terms of like demanding manufacturers actually fix a problem.

[21:24] We're so quickly appeased and that is sad.

[21:27] It really is sad that all you want is to be excited about Pimball but if there's an

[21:34] issue that should limit your excitement that should pause your buying frenzy, you don't

[21:40] want to be there.

[21:41] You want to be back into the hype train and that's where everybody tries to get to but

[21:46] I implore all of you out there.

[21:48] You have not heard from one manufacturer what the problem was and what the actual solution

[21:54] is and until you get some official communication how can you not still be hesitant to spend

[22:01] money.

[22:02] God forbid someone should spend $15,000 on an Elvira and then all of a sudden they

[22:08] have playfield issues.

[22:10] Can you blame them?

[22:12] I would blame the buyer in that scenario.

[22:14] You did not wait for an official solution from a manufacturer.

[22:18] What else is going on in the Pimball world?

[22:20] Can you blame the fact that nobody really wants to sponsor or advertise on the world's

[22:26] number one Pimball podcast?

[22:29] I've asked so many people out there.

[22:31] Come on, come on the show, Zach Mennie.

[22:33] Let's do a show.

[22:34] Let's talk about it.

[22:35] Can you blame them that they don't want to do anything?

[22:37] Can you blame all the manufacturers who are now avoiding being interviewed on Canadian

[22:42] Pimball podcast?

[22:43] Jersey Jack don't want to talk to me.

[22:45] Zach Sharp over at Stern Pimball always tells me it's not a good time.

[22:49] It's not a good time.

[22:51] That is like Steve Jobs telling the New York Times tech reporter, it's not a good time

[22:56] for us to talk about the new iPhone.

[22:58] It was a New York Times Wall Street Journal.

[23:01] This is the number one Pimball podcast, Zach Sharp.

[23:04] It's the number one Pimball podcast, Jersey Jack.

[23:08] Can you blame them though?

[23:09] How can they come on this show and talk about their companies when they know they're

[23:14] not going to get softball questions, but I'm very respectful.

[23:18] But can you blame them?

[23:20] It's gotten to the point now where here I am like, well, why do all these other Pimball

[23:24] podcasts off all these other great advertisements and sponsors and the number one show doesn't

[23:29] have any?

[23:30] It's gotten to the point now where I now have to start running other people's ads just

[23:35] to feel like I'm a legitimate Pimball podcast.

[23:39] Something like this.

[23:40] Flip and out Pimball is the exclusive distributor for the slap safe and ball pod best.

[23:45] Flip and out offers the newest and hottest machines as well as the Escalair powered stair

[23:49] climber.

[23:50] Contact Zach at 847-778-4876.

[23:54] Once you go Zach, you never go back.

[23:59] I mean, I would never buy a Pimball machine unless my distributor had the Escalair stair

[24:04] climber.

[24:05] Hey guys, we're going to buy a machine today.

[24:07] You know, wait, do they have the Escalair stair climber?

[24:10] If not, we have to go to those guys over and flipping out.

[24:12] No, it's, look, I don't really care.

[24:14] This show will never be in someone's back pocket.

[24:17] I don't care if nobody ever comes back on this show.

[24:20] You know we don't need guests, but we will get great guests from time to time.

[24:24] And how awesome is it when guests like Josh Kugler and Jerry come on the show because they

[24:30] have the guts to do it?

[24:32] And you know who else is going to come on the show, Robert Mueller, over at Deeproot.

[24:36] Now speaking of can you blame them, can you blame Deeproot for not showing anything yet?

[24:42] Absolutely not.

[24:43] They're doing it right.

[24:44] Can you blame them for not taking any money so they don't owe anybody anything?

[24:50] And they're taking their time to get it right.

[24:51] Now look, we all know this.

[24:54] They might have waited too long.

[24:55] There is a lot, a lot of titles out there right now.

[24:59] So can you blame the Pimball Buying community for feeling extreme fatigue right now and

[25:06] they're overwhelmed right?

[25:07] We are oversaturated with games right now.

[25:10] I think the last thing by the end of 2019 people are going to say is we need more Pimball

[25:16] in the world.

[25:17] No, what everyone is saying right now is I need more money and I need more space.

[25:23] And those are the two things that I'm in short supply of.

[25:26] We are no longer in short supply of Pimball options and Pimball companies out there.

[25:32] But can you blame Robert Mueller and can you blame his desire to disrupt the Pimball

[25:38] marketplace?

[25:39] And I can't.

[25:40] And I think Pimball needs more people that want to be disruptive, that want to change the

[25:45] game, that want to raise the bar and want to put as much magic as they can into a game.

[25:51] But can you blame our skepticism right?

[25:56] Can you blame consumers looking at ventures like Deeproot and saying well that's all well

[26:01] but where are the games?

[26:02] Why did you come out a year ago and say you were going to ship more games in 2019 and then

[26:07] you shipped none of them right?

[26:09] Maybe they're also learning the ultimate lesson in all of this, which is basically manufacturing

[26:15] is the hardest part and Stern Pimball is a manufacturing juggernaut and that is why they

[26:21] can keep going the way they're going.

[26:24] Now can you blame Stern Pimball for just clobbering the competition?

[26:27] They don't have to do this.

[26:28] They don't have to release so many titles one on top of another but can you blame them?

[26:33] Stern must be running the numbers that show that this hobby does not have another 10 years

[26:39] in it and they're going to cash out as much as they can because with every release if

[26:46] they're making money that money's going into the bank it's getting reinvested.

[26:51] Some of it's getting reinvested in new games.

[26:54] Other money is getting reinvested in other financial ventures and they're going to keep

[26:59] making money and those investors and Gary Stern and George Gomez they're going to retire

[27:04] so wealthy thanks to all of us and thanks to the fact that they actually delivered games

[27:10] that had great themes, great art and great fun and can you blame them?

[27:16] Can you blame them for charging what they charge for their games?

[27:18] You just can't because they actually make the games fun and available.

[27:23] We're all suckers.

[27:25] I always say this.

[27:26] Stern Pimball is like the biggest drug dealer in the world and we're addicted to Pimball.

[27:31] Can you blame them for simply making drugs on a daily basis that we will buy no matter

[27:36] what they price it at?

[27:38] Stern could start the pros at 7,000 and they would still sell because what else would you

[27:44] buy?

[27:45] Can you blame people for spending so many hours and so much of their life on Pinsale

[27:54] can you blame them?

[27:56] Pinsale is an outlet for people.

[27:59] I look at Pinsale like this.

[28:01] It's like a virtual bar.

[28:03] It's like a bar.

[28:05] Imagine if that bar was in the real world in which everyone went into that bar, loved Pimball

[28:11] and the conversations you could have with people in that bar were all around one thing

[28:15] and that's Pimball and so it's a great gathering place.

[28:19] It's a zokelo of Pimball enthusiasts and it's addictive.

[28:23] It's really addictive.

[28:25] You know, like when scientists study how we get addicted to our cell phones buzzing and

[28:30] ringing and text messages that come in, that's what Pinsale is like on a, basically on

[28:35] a minute by minute basis when you put up a thread and someone responds to it or thumbs

[28:39] it up or thumbs it down.

[28:41] You get all excited to know that somebody out there, here's the thing.

[28:44] Somebody out there actually cares about what you said about Pimball and that is a laughable

[28:51] thing because we all know that if we went into 99.9% of the other bars in the world and

[28:58] ran in there and said, hey guys, hey, you know, people should try this today.

[29:02] Walk into any bar and say, hey, everybody, stop.

[29:06] Wait a minute.

[29:07] Do you guys think that the vertical up kick on El Vira kicks the ball across the playfield

[29:13] and into the trunk?

[29:15] What do you guys think?

[29:17] And watch the people in the bar just fall over backwards and play dead.

[29:25] Nobody cares.

[29:27] Nobody cares about any of this stuff but us.

[29:30] Nobody.

[29:31] It's very small.

[29:33] It's a tiny little community.

[29:35] But it's, you know what?

[29:36] I would rather, especially spending so much time in New York City bars, I would be the

[29:40] one guy be like, wait, you're telling me?

[29:43] The ball is going to fly across the playfield into a trunk on a Pimball machine.

[29:49] Tell me more, my friend.

[29:51] So that's Pinside.

[29:52] Can you blame people for spending so much time?

[29:53] I'll say this though.

[29:55] The opposite side of it is I do think it's addictive.

[29:58] I think Pinside breeds a lot of negativity.

[30:02] I think it is stupid when you zoom out a little bit to see all the people arguing with each

[30:07] other when ultimately you guys all like the same thing, right?

[30:12] The endless debate about Pimball is so stupid.

[30:15] It's the most subjective thing.

[30:17] You know, it's not like sports forms where you could argue about your teams but ultimately

[30:21] those two teams will play each other and they can settle it.

[30:25] You know, like medieval madness can't play Batman 66.

[30:30] You know what I'm saying?

[30:31] Like it's stupid.

[30:32] It's stupid that we get mad that people like something that we don't, right?

[30:37] I told this to someone.

[30:38] You know, when people cry about what Stern's doing with Elvira, it is the equivalent

[30:43] of picketing outside of a movie theater.

[30:47] Like that's like the Pinside cry babies and the Pinside babies.

[30:50] They're like picketing outside a movie theater being like, oh my god, I can't believe

[30:54] what's in that movie.

[30:55] It's like, and they don't even a, they don't even see the movie yet and be like they're

[31:00] not even going to go see the movie.

[31:02] They're just crying about the fact that it even exists.

[31:05] That Stern's charging this much for the game and I think it's absolutely asses of nine,

[31:09] right?

[31:10] You blame them too because for some of these people, and this is a really hard truth,

[31:15] for some of these people, it's all they've got.

[31:18] And what I mean by that, they've made pinball so much of their lives.

[31:22] Like they spend hours and hours a day on Pinside.

[31:27] They spend countless hours listening to pinball podcasts and watching Twitch streams.

[31:32] And it's like, it's like the center of their world.

[31:34] If you were to ask them, like, what's the thing you're the most into?

[31:37] It's pinball.

[31:38] You know, and look, that is both awesome and sad at the same time and everybody out there

[31:43] is different.

[31:44] Like everybody out there, you know, we should not judge how people decide to live their

[31:49] lives.

[31:50] Everybody's free to live it the way they want.

[31:52] You know, there might be some single guy out there who's 45, who has no wife and has

[31:57] no kids and has a house full of pinball machines and it makes him happy.

[32:01] Who cares?

[32:02] He's living the life he wants to live.

[32:04] Now, there might be a guy out there that has a wife and three kids and he's in love with

[32:08] them and they love pinball and they have a nice game room and they're having a good time.

[32:11] Who cares?

[32:12] Now, there might be a guy and then this might be some of you out there.

[32:15] You know, you kind of, you kind of sick of your wife.

[32:18] You know, your kids kind of annoy you.

[32:21] You've worked hard your whole life to earn the money you have and you're, God damn, you're

[32:24] going to buy yourself, yourself things that make you happy.

[32:27] Even if your wife doesn't know about it and even if your kids don't appreciate it, you

[32:30] don't really care.

[32:32] And you look forward to those pinball shows, right?

[32:35] You look forward to traveling to those shows so you can finally hang out with people that

[32:39] appreciate and love the things you love and you can't wait to get away from your wife

[32:45] and kids for just three days to drink some whiskey and beer and play pinball for three

[32:50] days straight.

[32:51] And you know what?

[32:52] God bless those people.

[32:53] That's part of life too.

[32:54] We all end up in different situations and ultimately, pinball does one thing.

[33:00] It brings people together.

[33:01] So can you blame us in a world?

[33:04] In a world in which so much of what's happening out there in the world divides us, you know,

[33:09] this politically correct world that I think sucks now.

[33:12] Like everyone is so offended by everything.

[33:15] Can you blame us that we've decided, you know, to hitch our boats to something like pinball

[33:21] because it's a game, it's fun, it's colorful.

[33:24] It reminds us of our youth.

[33:26] You know, there's a big part of this whole thing that is nostalgic, that is a feeling

[33:31] we had when we were kids and we went into our kids and we saw these games and they lit

[33:35] up and we could just turn the outside world off.

[33:39] Right?

[33:40] When that game gets turned on and you're focused on playing pinball, everything else sort

[33:44] of dissipates and fades away and you have a little bit of a moment to yourself with the

[33:48] game and I think that's what's so special about it.

[33:51] And then when you're not playing, you're connected with people that also love your passion

[33:55] and are great to hang out with.

[33:57] And let's be honest.

[33:58] Let's all be honest.

[33:59] Some of these people we've met in the pinball hobby have become some of our best and closest

[34:04] friends in our lives.

[34:07] And for some of us out there, some of those friendships are so strong even if we're not

[34:13] physically close to each other.

[34:15] That's an amazing thing.

[34:16] Like you can bond with someone over something and have a relationship even long distance

[34:22] because you're connected over something you love and you get to know these people sometimes

[34:27] more than their coworkers know them and heck, you know, sometimes more probably than

[34:32] their wives and kids even know them because you know, you can be yourself.

[34:35] And I think for me, you know, can you blame me that I've turned my bedroom into an arcade

[34:39] and I've always sort of surrounded myself with things that I enjoyed because can you blame

[34:43] anyone that just wants to enjoy life on some level?

[34:47] I don't think it's a crime to just try and enjoy your life and surround yourself with

[34:52] things that bring you happiness.

[34:54] Okay?

[34:55] Oh man.

[34:56] I went on at this so 400.

[34:58] Can you blame?

[35:00] Can you blame the people out there that booed Canada and that have hated me from day one?

[35:05] Like can you blame guys like Hilton who have unsuccessfully tried to stop this kind of commentary?

[35:11] Can you blame people that call me a charlatan, a hypocrite, a sociopath, a psychopath, all

[35:17] these terrible things?

[35:18] You know, I saw today someone still brought up a deal I did on cloth like nine years ago

[35:23] for a fixed field like saying, canada is a troll and a thief.

[35:27] Can you blame these people that insult me nonstop?

[35:30] I don't blame them.

[35:32] If I was looking at my life from the outside, I would also be a little bit envious and jealous

[35:37] of this dude.

[35:39] This dude is like, he looks like he's got his shit figured out.

[35:42] Sorry to curse.

[35:43] I don't have it all figured out.

[35:45] I'm not the happiest guy on the planet, but I have a decent amount of balance in my life.

[35:49] I got a job I love.

[35:51] I got a wife I love.

[35:52] I've got a bulldog I love.

[35:53] I've got a car that's pretty decently fast.

[35:56] I've got another car that Brenda has that carves up the twisties.

[35:59] I've got a pinball machine that I think is one that's turns best and I don't really want

[36:04] much more.

[36:05] I have ambitions to do other things.

[36:07] I want to start a family one day.

[36:09] I want to move somewhere more peaceful.

[36:11] But from the outside looking in, I think a lot of people just want to hate me.

[36:15] They want to like say, oh, he's a terrible guy.

[36:17] He doesn't really care about this hobby.

[36:19] Can you blame them?

[36:21] But can you blame me for thinking those people are absolutely wrong?

[36:25] You think I wake up every morning and do 400 episodes about pinball because I don't

[36:30] care about the hobby?

[36:33] And when we want to talk about furthering this hobby, there's this notion that these

[36:38] tournament players are the guys who are doing it.

[36:41] No, they're not.

[36:42] Most of those dudes don't buy new machines.

[36:44] They just bitch about the new machines.

[36:47] Most of those guys are not having fun at shows.

[36:49] Do you ever see like a tournament at a show?

[36:52] Do you ever see the long faces of tournament players as they work all day long to win like

[36:57] 40 bucks?

[36:58] Do you ever do league night in your city in which these guys are there all night long, like

[37:03] three nights a week?

[37:04] Like there's so many long faces in that world because here's what I think those guys

[37:09] didn't.

[37:10] Here's what I think, you know, those guys don't get.

[37:12] Is that pinball was designed for fun.

[37:14] And when you watch tournaments and you watch these people competitively, you know, playing

[37:19] pinball, the last thing it looks like they're having to me is fun.

[37:23] Maybe it's fun when you're when you win, but it was never meant to be that.

[37:27] And it's just not for me.

[37:28] And that's why you don't hear about it on this podcast.

[37:31] Now can you blame these guys for saying that we're what's wrong with the hobby?

[37:34] It's these new inbox collectors.

[37:36] I saw that.

[37:37] I saw great cultivates.

[37:38] It's just new inbox collectors.

[37:39] They're destroying pinball.

[37:41] And how ironic is it that you've got these group of people that are complaining about

[37:47] new inbox pinball buyers being the problem in pinball?

[37:51] Well, newsflash, Gents, if there aren't new inbox pinball buyers, there is no future for

[37:57] pinball.

[37:58] We are the future.

[38:00] We are the people who buy these games, who keep these companies in business, who put food

[38:05] on the table for the employees who work at these companies.

[38:09] They need us.

[38:10] They want us in this hobby.

[38:12] We are the hobby.

[38:13] Not you guys who are searching for used games from the 90s.

[38:16] It's us.

[38:18] Can you blame the guys who say that Valley Williams games are shallow?

[38:23] Can you blame them for thinking that like, you know, those games aren't good enough

[38:26] anymore for home environments?

[38:28] I don't think so.

[38:29] I don't think those games are shallow at all.

[38:31] You know, I think what's happened in pinball recently is that people are starting to,

[38:37] you know, they're starting to fall in love with some of the deeper coding aspects of

[38:41] these games, but let's not for a minute.

[38:45] Let's not for a minute think that any movie made today is better than the movies made

[38:50] in the 80s, okay?

[38:52] Not for one minute.

[38:53] There is not one action movie.

[38:55] There is not one comedy today that compares with a Schwarzenegger action film from back

[39:00] in the day or from like all the, you know, Ferris Bueller's Day off.

[39:04] When's the last time you went into a movie theater and saw something as great as that?

[39:08] I just watched the last starfighter last night and I'm like, they would just never make

[39:13] a movie like this anymore.

[39:15] You know, we've got elements or we've got fragments of that like, stranger things, but pinball

[39:19] is the same way.

[39:20] It's like, it's really easy to like look at El Vira or look at Batman or look at Willie

[39:26] Wank and look at all these games.

[39:27] You're like, oh yeah, like this is the best pinball is, but no, no, you, if you just go

[39:33] back and you appreciate what those games of the 90s pulled off, that is still the pinnacle.

[39:39] Those are still the best games.

[39:42] Now I get it for you really good players out there and I can hear Ed Robertson banging

[39:46] his head against the wall.

[39:48] I understand that these new games with their deeper rule sets are more enjoyable to own.

[39:55] Absolutely none of those games were meant to own back in the day.

[39:58] They were just meant for fun for quick fun.

[40:01] That is what pinball was always supposed to be.

[40:04] A pinball machine was never supposed to be a role playing game that you had a 45 minute

[40:08] game on Pirate of the Caribbean and you don't understand Chris how good Pirate of the Caribbean

[40:13] is because you haven't had a deep game.

[40:15] I get it.

[40:16] I get it.

[40:17] I don't want to choose from 22 characters when I start a pinball game.

[40:20] I don't want to have to have the, you know, a 50 page book to tell me how to play the

[40:24] game.

[40:25] I just want to know intuitively what to shoot at and that's where Stern wins.

[40:30] But can you blame Stern?

[40:32] Can you blame him for just having a big freaking out of a house in the back of the game?

[40:35] Yeah.

[40:36] I know to shoot the castle or the house.

[40:38] I know the ramps going to go up or down.

[40:40] I know what to hit without even knowing the rules of the game.

[40:44] That's how you make pinball everybody.

[40:46] Look, can you blame, can you blame people out there that vote for Canadian pinball podcast

[40:52] for best pinball podcast of the year?

[40:56] Can you blame me for being honest and transparent with you always, even to the point where sometimes

[41:02] I might change my mind, even to the point where I might seem a little arrogant and overly

[41:07] confident, even to the point where it might actually seem like I'm hurting the hobby,

[41:13] right?

[41:14] I got a, I had a little correspondence yesterday with Joe over at pin graphics and he was

[41:20] talking to me about how, you know, Chris, like what you say is hurting Jersey Jack pinball

[41:25] sales.

[41:26] And I said to him, I'm like, look, man, I got to be honest.

[41:29] I was really happy Jack inviting me over and I was happy that I got to see Wonka early.

[41:33] But when I asked him a very simple question, do you, do you or do you not have the assets,

[41:39] I just don't appreciate not hearing the truth about that simple question.

[41:44] And when you spin it or lie or mislead whatever, whatever like hyperbole you want to say,

[41:50] I just don't appreciate that.

[41:52] And because he did that, it made the conversation around the game much more negative for me.

[41:58] And so you know what Joe's like, but Chris, like Jersey Jack pinball, you have an obligation

[42:02] not to hurt these companies because they have mouths to feed because there's people who

[42:07] go in there every day and are working hard and we want to make sure that they stay in business.

[42:11] And you know what?

[42:12] No, that is where I draw the line on this podcast.

[42:16] That is where I draw the line with, you know, how I deal with people in life.

[42:20] The bottom line is this, the person who has the responsibility to make sure that those

[42:25] people's mouths are fed, that their kids are getting money for education, that they have

[42:30] jobs is Jack.

[42:32] It's his company.

[42:34] And Jack's responsibility is to, you know, handle and manage his interviews the right way

[42:40] and tell people the truth.

[42:42] And if anything happens to any pinball company out there, it's not my fault.

[42:46] It's not my, I did not.

[42:48] You remember the whole, I think one of the reasons why we became so popular was the highway

[42:52] pinball debacle.

[42:54] Think about it.

[42:55] Everything that was going on was telling you to support Andrew highway.

[43:00] Everybody was telling you things were going to be okay.

[43:02] Everyone, you know, guys like Hilton, people forget they, they have memory loss.

[43:06] People like Hilton were telling you that Andrew's going to deliver to still keep your money

[43:11] in and look what happened when I tried, when I tried to tell you what was happening behind

[43:17] the scenes, what happened?

[43:19] Everyone started to say that Canada was bad for the hobby.

[43:22] Canada's making stuff up.

[43:23] I tried to share information on pinside that I knew was accurate.

[43:27] What happened?

[43:28] Robin took it down.

[43:29] I tried to create a shell account to share what was accurately happening and they banned

[43:34] that account.

[43:35] I've been trying just to tell you guys stuff happens behind the scenes that we should

[43:39] talk about that you need to know as consumers and no one else wants to talk about it.

[43:44] I mean the clear code issue was never going to be handled so quickly if we didn't keep

[43:48] banging the drum about it.

[43:50] And I love it now.

[43:51] People are making fun of me.

[43:52] You know, I hear it.

[43:53] I hear the other pinball podcast.

[43:54] Oh, we're not going to talk about clear code.

[43:56] Why is that a joke?

[43:58] Why is it a joke to these other pinball podcasts and these Twitch streamers?

[44:02] Why are people making light of the fact that manufacturers were shipping you defective

[44:06] products?

[44:07] Why is that funny?

[44:09] Is it funny to the guy who's looking down at his expensive game that now is all chipped?

[44:13] I don't get it.

[44:14] I don't get why these people are so afraid to just have a backbone stand up for something

[44:21] and speak your mind when you see something wrong going on.

[44:25] I mean, maybe I would have been a better lawyer than a pinball podcaster, but come on.

[44:30] Let's all rally together around finding the truth about what's going on in this hobby.

[44:34] Right?

[44:35] And we exposed Andrew Hyway for who he was.

[44:36] You know what I need to do?

[44:37] I need to do this.

[44:38] I was going to do this on episode 400, but I need to do this soon.

[44:42] I've never done this show.

[44:43] And it's going to be, I think I'll be one of the ones I do, you know, coming up soon.

[44:47] Here's what I need to do.

[44:48] I have a transcript that someone sent me from highway pinball.

[44:53] It was someone who worked at highway pinball.

[44:55] And it is a correspondence between Andrew Hyway and them.

[44:59] And the back and forth between the two about, you know, Andrew Hyway was like panicking,

[45:05] trying to get games out because he saw the storm was coming and he knew that people would

[45:09] like bail if they didn't get their full throttles.

[45:12] And it's the employee basically telling him like, dude, like you're out of your mind.

[45:16] Like I'm not coming in.

[45:17] Like there's nothing to do.

[45:18] Like we're frozen right now.

[45:20] It's amazing.

[45:21] I'm going to, what I'm going to do is I'm going to have someone come on with me.

[45:25] And one of us will be Andrew Hyway.

[45:27] One of the other person will be the employee and we're just going to read it.

[45:30] It's going to be one of the greatest pinball podcasts ever.

[45:32] Okay.

[45:33] Can you blame them?

[45:34] What else is left on this episode of Kedatus pinball podcast?

[45:37] Well, you know, can you blame?

[45:40] I don't know, man.

[45:41] What else can we blame this pinball podcast, girl?

[45:44] Oh, man.

[45:45] I just want to say like, let's close out this episode.

[45:48] I got to get to work.

[45:49] I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, you guys have been following this show.

[45:54] Some of you, I know some of you turn me on.

[45:56] You just, you turn me on just to laugh at me.

[45:58] That's fine.

[45:59] Some of you turn me on and you enjoy every episode.

[46:02] Some of you listen to every episode on your ride to work.

[46:05] Some of you listen to this around the world in different countries.

[46:10] Some of you mode along while you're listening to Kedatus pinball podcasts.

[46:14] Some of you actually listen with your wives.

[46:16] They enjoy it.

[46:17] You know, I enjoy doing it.

[46:19] I enjoy doing it.

[46:20] I listen to all the other podcasts.

[46:22] I read Pinside.

[46:23] I try to stay on top of what's going on in this hobby.

[46:26] And all I've ever wanted to do on this show from day one, a couple things.

[46:31] I wanted to give you guys as much information about what's going on in the pinball hobby

[46:35] so that if you only listened to this show, you would have a good grasp of what is going

[46:40] on and what is ultimately relevant right now in the hobby.

[46:43] Okay.

[46:44] I'm not looking at like talking about the history of pinball.

[46:47] Like there's so many podcasts about that.

[46:48] Okay.

[46:49] I don't care about competitive pinball play at all.

[46:51] I don't care.

[46:52] And I don't think most of you care either whatsoever.

[46:54] I think most of you are too busy in life to apply the amount of time it takes to be a

[46:58] pinball tournament player.

[47:00] Okay.

[47:01] The other thing I try to do, other than keep you informed and the most important thing,

[47:05] is just keep you entertained.

[47:07] The only reason to do a pinball podcast is to be entertaining.

[47:11] And we can do it, I believe, in a way that nobody else can.

[47:16] Solomente, just me, just what's in my head.

[47:19] No notes, no editing, no interviews.

[47:22] I can still keep you entertained.

[47:24] And it's because, I don't know, maybe it's just like I have a little bit of an ADD mind,

[47:28] but I think, you know, what we talk about on this show.

[47:31] And I say we, because in a way, maybe Chris is always talking to Keney to his head.

[47:36] And that's how I make it through this world.

[47:39] Do I have like a bipolar disorder?

[47:41] But I just want this show to be entertaining.

[47:43] You know, I listen to other shows and I have to say this.

[47:47] I think the mistake everybody makes.

[47:49] And I said this to Ben Heck from the very beginning.

[47:52] He makes a box and they put themselves in that box.

[47:56] And that box might be, well, we're going to have a show every Monday, regardless if

[47:59] there's anything to talk about, regardless if I feel like it, regardless if we have a

[48:04] good guess, and it burns them out.

[48:06] It burns them out, right?

[48:08] My good friend used to be good friend Ryan C. Great, great episodes of Head to Head Pinball

[48:13] for so long.

[48:14] And now what?

[48:15] Burnt out.

[48:16] You can tell it.

[48:17] Marty's just like, they're running on fumes now.

[48:19] They're running on fumes without Ryan C, but they have to do it.

[48:22] It's just like, have to do it.

[48:24] You know, and so like, I think what we've always done is we said, look, we're just going to

[48:27] do it when we feel like it.

[48:28] You heard me a couple of weeks ago.

[48:29] I'm like, I don't feel like doing this show.

[48:31] So I might take a week off.

[48:32] There's no, there's no schedule because there is no, is there a schedule for when you think

[48:38] about pinball?

[48:39] Is there a schedule for when you feel like listening to a pinball podcast?

[48:42] I don't think so.

[48:43] And it's just organic.

[48:44] We just go with the flow.

[48:46] And one day you know this.

[48:48] I know this.

[48:49] One day this show is not going to exist.

[48:51] The years from now someone's going to stumble upon this show and be like, what the f is

[48:55] this?

[48:56] But this show exists to entertain you.

[48:59] Okay.

[49:00] Jack Danger, good friend of mine.

[49:02] Entertain you with this hobby.

[49:04] Why would we do anything other than try to entertain you?

[49:08] We're not here to bore you.

[49:10] We're not here to be too preachy.

[49:12] We just want to entertain you with our pinball commentary.

[49:15] And I think there's a lot of great pinball podcasters out there.

[49:17] They know who they are.

[49:18] They know everyone who knows who I listen to when I'm a fan of.

[49:21] It's great.

[49:22] You know, I really would love though.

[49:24] I would love to go three for three with the twippy.

[49:27] And I'll tell you why.

[49:29] Nobody.

[49:30] Nobody takes more arrows, more criticism.

[49:34] And nobody has been sort of, you know, slandered in a way more than I have.

[49:39] And people call me all sorts of nants.

[49:41] And I'm going to be honest.

[49:42] Like it does get to me at times.

[49:44] But you know what?

[49:46] The reason why I continue to do this.

[49:48] And I hope you help you feel the enthusiasm is because I love the fact that I know you enjoy

[49:53] it.

[49:54] That's it.

[49:55] If nobody listened, right?

[49:56] If I saw my listener base go down and down and down, I would hang it up.

[50:00] I would hang it up.

[50:01] You know what?

[50:02] It's run its course.

[50:03] But I don't know if you feel it.

[50:05] I kind of feel it.

[50:06] I feel like an episode 400.

[50:08] A period in which I don't think anyone else could get this far with this much energy and

[50:13] enthusiasm.

[50:14] That's how you right now.

[50:15] I don't feel tired anymore.

[50:17] I don't feel fatigued.

[50:18] I feel motivated and energized to do another 400 episodes of Canadus, Pinball Podcast.

[50:25] I think that's music to a lot of your ears.

[50:27] We're not going anywhere.

[50:28] Oh, we're going to cover 2020 is going to be a crazy year in this hobby.

[50:32] So everybody, thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for tuning in.

[50:37] This has been episode 400 of Canadus, Pinball Podcast.

[50:42] Hard to believe we got this far.

[50:43] But the only reason I got here was because of all of you out there and all the haters

[50:48] out there, all the haters out there, I dedicate all 400 episodes to you.

[50:54] Thank you so much because I know you guys.

[50:56] You guys listen to every show twice.

[50:58] Have a great day everybody.
