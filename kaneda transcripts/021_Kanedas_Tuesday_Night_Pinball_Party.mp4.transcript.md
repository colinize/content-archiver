[00:00] All right, we are live.

[00:04] How's it?

[00:05] We're gonna have to do this.

[00:06] We're gonna have to share a screen and go right here.

[00:17] Because this is it.

[00:19] This is it.

[00:20] This is it.

[00:24] This is the most badass.

[00:30] Ball or move I've seen in pinball marketing in a long time.

[00:36] And it just goes to show you like when you've got,

[00:40] when you've got a wizard in your corner

[00:43] and you got magic ready to go, you don't need to do much.

[00:47] Right?

[00:48] You know what I'm saying?

[00:48] Like one image here speaks more volumes than all the stuff

[00:53] we've been seeing over the last few weeks.

[00:55] And I sent Ken Cromwell note today being like,

[00:57] you guys just like did it.

[00:59] You just like, you were lurking in the shadows

[01:03] and you've just dropped what I think is

[01:07] the biggest ball or move I've seen in pinball marketing ever.

[01:10] Cause no one does ball or moves, right?

[01:12] Nobody does ball or moves.

[01:13] They simply, they either do the same playbook, right?

[01:17] They show underneath the brand is handing me my glasses

[01:20] so I can actually read your comments.

[01:22] They've, they usually show underneath the play field.

[01:27] They talk about a new feature.

[01:31] We're going to talk about it, right?

[01:33] It's like I'm watching everybody's marketing moves

[01:36] and it's like, hey, we got new glass.

[01:41] Right?

[01:42] I mean, people literally taking credit for anti reflective glass

[01:46] as if that matters in 2025.

[01:50] We're going to start taking credit for leg bolts next

[01:53] and shooter rods, which is this is the shooter now right here.

[01:59] But this is going to be a crazy few weeks.

[02:06] And we're going to talk about it.

[02:09] And I love it and I love, I love like,

[02:11] I love punching back a little bit.

[02:14] I love the confidence in this move.

[02:17] I love what it's going up against.

[02:20] And I love that there's going to be a royal rumble

[02:25] over the next four weeks of four titles.

[02:30] And y'all know you're not buying four games.

[02:33] Y'all, y'all, y'all know you don't have the room

[02:35] for four more games.

[02:37] But this is a damn ball or move.

[02:40] We're going to talk about it.

[02:41] All right, we're definitely going to talk about

[02:44] more of what happened today.

[02:46] Let me try and pull up right now.

[02:49] Hold on, I'm going to see if the screen might go black

[02:52] and hold on a second.

[02:53] I want to see.

[03:01] All right, here we go.

[03:09] Hold on.

[03:12] This is the other thing happened today.

[03:15] Um, here we go.

[03:20] Show screen.

[03:45] I'm going to show you.

[03:56] You know, they've got this like sort of, um,

[03:59] this thing you're doing barrels right now.

[04:01] It's like this marketing strategy of like,

[04:03] we're going to remind people of where value lies.

[04:07] And we're the best bang for the buck and pinball.

[04:09] You look, that's cool.

[04:11] You know, nothing wrong with that.

[04:12] Like David Van S did get back to me today.

[04:16] And that seemed to be their strategy of putting more

[04:21] in the games and giving people more for their money.

[04:24] And you know what?

[04:25] I can't fault them for that.

[04:27] I think it's, uh, it's what people want right now.

[04:30] We're living in very expensive times and for $10,000.

[04:35] But yeah, like juicy time, right?

[04:37] I mean, it's like, it sounded like tron music.

[04:40] Canada, are you ready for two pimples,

[04:42] Kong and Harry Potter pimple?

[04:44] Yeah, this more than two, it's four.

[04:47] It's going to be King Kong Harry Potter,

[04:49] Dune, most likely and predator.

[04:54] Okay.

[04:55] So I'm going to, I'm going to get to all your comments.

[04:57] I just want to say I think at,

[05:00] out of all the marketing I've seen, you know, it's like,

[05:03] like Stern's got L win.

[05:05] They've got L wins like having the closer, man.

[05:08] He's the closer.

[05:09] He's he's, he's Glenn Gary Glen Ross.

[05:11] He's the Alec Baldwin character.

[05:13] He he, he drinks the coffee, he gets the deal done.

[05:16] He gets the customers to line up for him.

[05:18] He's the best, most bankable thing in all of pimple right now

[05:23] is Keith L win, right?

[05:25] So Stern's got him making King Kong.

[05:29] And and it's like, it's ready, right?

[05:32] It's coming in just like a week.

[05:34] All right.

[05:35] So that's like juggernaut, right?

[05:37] How do you beat King Kong?

[05:39] Well, Harry Potter gives you a damn good fighting chance.

[05:44] And Harry Potter is the biggest theme in pimple since Star Wars.

[05:47] It is the second biggest theme in the history of pimple.

[05:51] And so that's really, you know, interesting, right?

[05:56] Is like, we are going to get,

[05:58] we are going to get the second biggest theme of all time

[06:02] made into a pimple machine by a company

[06:04] that knows it needs to make a statement, right?

[06:08] But man, okay, so the reason I love the move today,

[06:11] the reason I love to move today of like, you can,

[06:15] you can basically, you know, they know they're,

[06:19] they're not raising the price.

[06:21] They basically are going to have everybody curious

[06:26] to wait and see Harry Potter before, I don't know,

[06:31] like are you going to buy?

[06:32] I think, look, the hardest game now to break through

[06:36] is going to be the barrels game.

[06:38] It's like the timing couldn't be worse.

[06:41] Like you're getting it from, you're trying to fight

[06:44] a two front war against the best designer in pimple right now.

[06:48] And the second biggest theme in the history of pimple,

[06:51] that might even be the biggest theme ever in pimple

[06:54] because there's never been a Harry Potter pimple machine.

[06:58] And there's been a plethora of Star Wars pimple machines

[07:01] over time.

[07:02] And you know what, none of them are good.

[07:05] None of them are good.

[07:06] So if they knock Harry Potter out of the park,

[07:11] it'll be the best, the most popular theme

[07:14] integrated properly in the history of pimple.

[07:18] So I'm excited gang, I'm really, I'm excited.

[07:21] But I also, you know, I want to say,

[07:22] I think Jersey Jack's marketing around Potter

[07:25] has kind of been funny to me.

[07:27] It's like, they're just kind of sitting back

[07:29] being like, that's cute.

[07:31] That's cute.

[07:32] Maybe if I were you, I wouldn't spend my money

[07:34] on anyone else's product.

[07:37] If I were you, you know, as everyone's getting these media days

[07:40] and flying people out to go see their product,

[07:42] you know, okay, cool.

[07:44] You can order your Harry Potter next week too.

[07:47] It's fun, right?

[07:49] It's really fun to see all this.

[07:52] So like gang, was there something today about like,

[07:56] dunepimbal.com?

[07:57] Did like, did someone say like, Zach, I don't know,

[08:00] I'm confused.

[08:01] I don't know, I've been working all these.

[08:02] I have no idea.

[08:03] Did Zach like trademark that URL along with like Harry Potter

[08:10] pimple, is that what happened?

[08:12] Okay, it was a troll site, right?

[08:13] Okay, that's what I thought.

[08:14] Because people were making other troll sites.

[08:20] I think it's gonna get, I don't know, right?

[08:25] When I see that, I just, I feel like Barrel's a fun

[08:28] is sandbagging us with dune.

[08:32] I really do.

[08:34] I really do.

[08:34] I think it, I still, I still to this day

[08:37] think it's gonna be, you know, something else.

[08:40] Like maybe it's goonies, maybe the thing that eats the ball

[08:43] is, you know, what's his name?

[08:45] Like, Chuck it, Chuck, uh, who's the heavy kid,

[08:50] Chuck, why is the name, I can't,

[08:55] the name is escaping me right now.

[08:57] Sloth, chunk, chunk, yeah, sorry, he was chunk.

[08:59] I wanted to say, Chuck, it is like, chunk.

[09:03] You know, he's always eating and he's eating the candy.

[09:05] Like maybe he eats the balls and that's how you lock a ball.

[09:08] I don't know.

[09:10] I don't know, like a week from now, we're gonna see it.

[09:12] I will say this, the teasing of the parts,

[09:18] it's not, it's not working.

[09:22] That, that lighting system does nothing.

[09:26] You know, it's funny because,

[09:29] is that lighting system, is it stealing?

[09:33] Is it stealing what the lighting system is in Alice's adventures

[09:39] in Wonderland?

[09:40] Like very similar to what Melvin has in his game,

[09:43] but you know, like lighting shouldn't be like hard to do, right?

[09:51] These are LED lights, they're not expensive.

[09:55] Branding these LED lights as like unique,

[09:59] like patent pending innovations is comical to me.

[10:04] You know, none of them are really like, wow, like,

[10:07] in fact, I think a lot of them,

[10:09] even when I saw that barrels one,

[10:10] I was like, well, I hope it's not doomed

[10:12] because if it is, this rainbow lighting system

[10:16] makes no sense for a movie like Dune.

[10:19] And I think what a lot of these games are forgetting

[10:21] is the lighting should reflect the theme

[10:25] and the lighting should be indicative

[10:29] of the light sources from the theme.

[10:32] So let me give you an example.

[10:34] If you've ever played Lord of the Rings,

[10:37] it really only works with the white, warm light

[10:42] because it connects to that more like middle earth vibe.

[10:47] When you do the RGB, full color inserts people do,

[10:53] and you throw rainbow puke into the Lord of the Rings game,

[10:58] it absolutely ruins the game.

[11:00] And so whether it's Dune,

[11:03] I even think Harry Potter to me is not a rainbow puke light scheme.

[11:08] So I think these companies wanting to light up every game

[11:14] like a Skittles Christmas tree isn't really the way to go.

[11:20] And I'm all for like modern lighting,

[11:22] but I think the lighting should reflect the game.

[11:27] You know, I noticed that when I played Evil Dead,

[11:29] I liked the way the lighting worked

[11:30] and it wasn't crazy rainbow puke

[11:33] and inserts were lit so you knew what to shoot at.

[11:37] That's the other thing in some of these modern games

[11:39] that you have no ideas, but more JJP than everybody else.

[11:43] You have like no idea where to shoot.

[11:45] It's just like everything is lit.

[11:48] Now, guess I'll just go here, you know.

[11:51] Well, Elton John being rainbow puke

[11:54] kind of makes sense because it's like 70s disco,

[11:57] which is very rainbow like an Elton John's whole thing

[12:00] is this sort of rainbow world.

[12:04] So I think it works with Elton John.

[12:07] Spooky been having a fantastic lighting since 2017.

[12:12] Stern's lighting is the worst.

[12:15] Like it's the worst.

[12:18] Like have you ever seen a stern game in a track mode,

[12:21] even look as good as like big Lebowski's a track mode

[12:24] from 12 years ago?

[12:28] Total nuclear annihilation.

[12:30] That light show embarrasses anything that's in a stern.

[12:34] I like stern to me.

[12:37] It is like, it's like they, it's strange.

[12:41] Like, you know, they still dominate

[12:43] and they still dominate by volume,

[12:46] but they really have struggled to consistently

[12:52] you know, put what should be in these games by now.

[12:56] And a lot of that is like they win on gameplay, right?

[12:59] They win on gameplay, they win on themes.

[13:02] And this is the big difference now, right?

[13:04] Stern's not used to this.

[13:07] They're not used to having a competition

[13:11] that's securing some pretty damn good themes

[13:14] and also delivering some incredible bang for the buck,

[13:18] right?

[13:19] They're not used to this.

[13:21] Like Stern Pimbal doesn't get Pulp Fiction.

[13:23] Somebody else does.

[13:25] Stern Pimbal doesn't get Rick and Morty.

[13:26] Somebody else does.

[13:28] Stern Pimbal doesn't have Harry Potter.

[13:30] Somebody else does.

[13:31] Stern Pimbal doesn't have back to the future.

[13:33] Somebody else does.

[13:34] So they're not used to this.

[13:37] They were like the only player in town

[13:39] and they were laughing at all.

[13:41] The other companies that weren't really securing anything

[13:45] amazing, like even Jersey Jack's themes to be honest,

[13:49] Wizard of Oz, yeah, Hobbit, yeah.

[13:53] What after that?

[13:54] What was it?

[13:55] Diled in,

[13:57] Pirates of the Caribbean without any assets.

[14:00] And you know what I'm saying?

[14:01] Like hasn't really been Toy Story 4 Avatar.

[14:07] Stern or he made it, you know, Elton John,

[14:10] you know, it's like, where, hey, come on.

[14:12] Come on, you know, and now we're gonna get Harry Potter,

[14:16] right?

[14:17] And we know they wanted Harry Potter.

[14:18] That's why Joe Camnicow was so bitter.

[14:22] If you've been on talk about this,

[14:23] that was one of the most bitter, petty things

[14:26] I'd ever seen, you know, because, you know,

[14:28] Joe's a super successful guy.

[14:30] And if there's anything multi-millionaires

[14:33] with a million dollar car collections

[14:35] who have, you know, Joe gets his way,

[14:37] he didn't get his way here.

[14:40] And for him to rage announce that J.J.P had the license

[14:45] like that, it's crazy, right?

[14:47] That was like the first time we'd ever seen.

[14:50] I've been covering his hobby for 12 years.

[14:53] I've never seen anybody, anybody ever do that.

[14:57] Like, it's like, not really professional.

[15:00] But I used to talk to Joe, he blocked me.

[15:04] I don't know, I don't know what happened there.

[15:06] This, just who knows?

[15:08] He blocked, you know, it is what it is.

[15:10] Like I haven't, I haven't really thought about it

[15:12] a bunch because I'm not even sure what I did.

[15:16] Plenty of Stern games have, no, they don't.

[15:19] What's a Stern game with great lighting?

[15:22] Name me a Stern game with lighting that is anywhere as good

[15:26] as modern spooky games, modern J.J.P games,

[15:31] and you know, I'll wait.

[15:33] Jaws lighting is great.

[15:38] Bro, go play Evil Dead and then tell me Jaws lighting is great.

[15:43] Metallica, remat, no, I was just on a Metallica.

[15:47] Those, what are they?

[15:52] They're like tick-tax on the side of the cabinet.

[15:56] The expression lighting system is so bad.

[15:59] Like I don't understand like why it's like tick-tax.

[16:07] Like why couldn't they run the length of the cabinet?

[16:13] I don't, and you can't really create that much

[16:16] of an atmosphere with those.

[16:17] I mean, like they're fine, but they're, again,

[16:19] they're like out of all the expression lighting systems

[16:21] in Pimball now, it's the worst.

[16:25] And this is the company that should have the best R&D

[16:28] and the best innovation.

[16:35] You know, Jaws lighting is beautifully coated.

[16:40] All right, well, I'll take your word for it.

[16:44] Like Jaws is a great game.

[16:46] It's held its value.

[16:47] You know, out of all the modern sturns,

[16:48] it's the only one that, you know, at 13,000,

[16:52] it's held its value all time block list.

[16:56] Yeah, man, it's funny to me that people still,

[17:00] after all these years, I mean, I've been blocked on Pinside now.

[17:05] Oh, shoot, it's been 12 years now.

[17:08] I've been blocked on Pinside 12 years.

[17:12] And the world's second favorite Pimball podcast is still not allowed back.

[17:22] So, well, it's fun.

[17:24] RetroJang was hanging out again on the Facebook page.

[17:27] It's nice to see him there.

[17:28] He's something though, like I can't message him.

[17:31] I don't know what he did.

[17:32] I can't PM him anything.

[17:33] So I guess, you know, it'll, it'll, it'll,

[17:36] I can reply to his comments on my page.

[17:39] Yeah, it's cool, man.

[17:40] I don't want to be back on Pinside.

[17:42] I, I, the days of arguing with those alcoholics, I, I, I, I find no enjoyment in it.

[17:50] And anything of value on Pinside, which is usually the owner's club is,

[17:54] is easy for me to pop into an, an engage or just read up on what,

[17:59] what's happening with these games.

[18:01] I mean, that's what I use Pinside for gang.

[18:02] I love seeing people's game rooms.

[18:05] I love seeing people's, you know, the owner's club and, and talking about owning the game.

[18:12] We're going to go back real quick.

[18:17] This is it.

[18:20] This is it.

[18:23] I mean, think about this move today.

[18:24] Like, let's just talk about this from a marketing standpoint.

[18:27] You're one week out from Stern Pimball and Barrel's a fun is about

[18:34] to reveal their new game.

[18:38] So you know you have the dominant theme.

[18:44] You know, that's not a JJP page.

[18:50] All right, fine.

[18:54] Whether Zach did this or not, it doesn't matter.

[18:57] They basically, they basically have told all their distros you can now reserve your game.

[19:14] What does it say down?

[19:15] I got this from NAPS Arcade.

[19:17] Let me see here.

[19:18] What does it say here?

[19:22] I mean, it seems, let's see.

[19:25] What is this?

[19:26] What is this again on the ball?

[19:27] I open.

[19:31] What is it at the?

[19:34] I think is that like the quidditch ball that like nothing like fly around?

[19:42] Just go to the URL.

[19:47] Where are in the.

[19:51] Wait.

[19:56] Well, you know, just the fact getting that.

[20:05] That they are, you know, they've told their distros.

[20:10] Let me stop sharing the fact that they've announced their distros like it's coming.

[20:17] You can hear the details.

[20:22] It's great.

[20:23] And it's great.

[20:25] I'll tell you this.

[20:28] The fact that normally JJP will ask you to take this stuff down.

[20:35] But they're not right.

[20:36] They know what they got.

[20:39] Gang all the not all the all the deposits on JJPs have always been non-refundable.

[20:46] So I don't I don't know why anyone's confused by that.

[20:49] They've been non-refundable since Toy Story 4, since Godfather, since Avatar.

[20:54] And you know, since Guns and Roses, since.

[20:59] So Jersey Jack has had non-refundable $2,500 for a CE for about five years now.

[21:08] So I don't know why anyone's confused by that.

[21:12] So I think what's going to be interesting is seeing what they do with the amount of Harry Potter C.E.s.

[21:18] Because you know, the rumor is that they're going to have a window by which they'll take as many orders for C.E.s as they get.

[21:26] And they're going to make that many.

[21:28] So that's definitely going to like, you know, just kind of squeeze the collectibility for sure.

[21:35] Like you're not going to have the FOMO and you're not going to have to like, you know, fight to be on a distro list to get one.

[21:41] Because I think they'll they'll make you one if you want one.

[21:44] If you order it within a certain timeframe, look, it's a smart business move for Jersey Jack.

[21:48] They're going to the demand for a Harry Potter CE because again, like nobody really wants $12,000.

[21:53] Ellie's they know that what's wise about this move for them is they're basically going to flip the order volume.

[22:02] So they're going to get like thousands of people to order C.E.s.

[22:07] And they're not really going to care that the Ellie's are not going to get nearly as many orders.

[22:12] In fact, I guarantee you that if J.J.P. opens up the window for C.E.s to be ordered more than a thousand, they will easily get more orders for C.E.s than Ellie's.

[22:28] And it will end up being like the Ellie will actually be more limited than the collector's edition.

[22:33] I think they're I think Jack's going to say he got 5,000 orders.

[22:37] Like Jack for those newbies here, Jack did this before.

[22:41] He did it. If you remember when he did it, he did it on dialed in.

[22:44] He said, Hey, we're only going to make as many as we get orders for.

[22:49] I believe it was midnight on New Year's Eve.

[22:52] Game was launched and like, you know, I think they launched the game at I think it was like expo.

[22:58] There was some time frame.

[23:01] And then he's like, we got 150 orders.

[23:03] It was like it was like such an exact number.

[23:07] Crazy, right? How far we've come?

[23:09] Like there was no demand for dialed in.

[23:12] No demand.

[23:14] Chris, do you think Potter will have a better toy than the Scram?

[23:22] What's what's the Scram?

[23:24] Is the Scram?

[23:31] What's the Scram?

[23:32] Is that a Harry Potter thing I should know?

[23:38] Oh, the Scram?

[23:39] Oh, the Shrimp?

[23:41] Is that the crab avatar toy?

[23:44] Okay.

[23:46] Yeah.

[23:49] Yeah.

[23:49] The scoop that becomes a ramp on Avatar.

[23:52] Yeah, yes, yes.

[23:53] I think this from what I've heard of people that have seen Harry Potter.

[23:58] It is loaded.

[23:59] It is packed.

[24:01] It is going to have a lot of stuff in it.

[24:05] That's what I heard.

[24:06] As Jack said, it's got three levels of play.

[24:09] I expect this thing to be, you know, Erick's like his opus.

[24:19] I haven't heard Erick talk about a game like this in a long time.

[24:23] You said Toy Story was great.

[24:24] No, I didn't.

[24:26] And no, no, no.

[24:29] I said I heard rumors, but the moment I saw Toy Story,

[24:34] I never said it was great.

[24:35] Here's the thing is like, I'm gang.

[24:38] Unless I've seen something like I'm just reporting back to you

[24:41] what people are telling me.

[24:45] What I heard on Toy Story early on was that it's a lot of fun to shoot,

[24:48] but it's not packed.

[24:51] You and Brenda said,

[24:53] Wanka was amazing.

[24:54] You know, look, I, gang, I got to be honest.

[24:58] I got to be honest.

[24:59] Willie Wonka still to this day.

[25:03] It is probably Jersey Jax.

[25:08] You know, best game.

[25:12] Probably.

[25:13] I mean, that's probably to this day their best game.

[25:18] For, you know, in terms of like the total package of what it delivers,

[25:23] the reason why I'm disappointed in Wanka is I thought

[25:30] when I went to see it at Jersey Jax.

[25:32] Jax said it was going to have all the assets in there.

[25:35] And I asked about like the songs and the musical.

[25:38] He said, everything you want is going to be in there.

[25:41] And then I also like when he was describing how Wanka vision was going to work,

[25:46] I was so enamored by what he described.

[25:49] And none of that made its way really into the game at all.

[25:54] Wizard of Oz is not the best.

[25:56] Wizard of Oz is a terrible shooting game.

[26:01] It's a terrible shooting game, guys.

[26:03] Like how does anybody enjoy the way Waw shoots?

[26:07] Like all the shots are right up the middle.

[26:10] The left out lane drain, the state fair is just punishing and not enjoyable.

[26:17] Waw's is just a terribly like, like it's a terrible design layout.

[26:25] It really is.

[26:25] It should have been more casual and fun and inviting.

[26:31] Instead Joe Balls are like made it brutal.

[26:35] I just I don't find Waw's to be fun to shoot.

[26:38] It's beautiful to look at.

[26:40] It's a stunning game.

[26:43] But it's a it's a clunky mess.

[26:52] I've never really been a fan of and you know, look.

[26:57] Look, Waw's didn't just sell based on theme gang.

[27:01] Waw's sold because look at the damn thing.

[27:05] When they made Wizard of Oz,

[27:07] Stern's games were Photoshop, drag and drop crap, like empty crap.

[27:16] And it was only $6,500 gang.

[27:19] And a Stern was like 5,500 and it looked like,

[27:23] like garbage.

[27:24] Remember Waw's came out when what Stern had like transformers and

[27:30] you know, stuff like that.

[27:31] Like it was only after Wizard of Oz that they did ACDC.

[27:39] But look, I think Jersey Jack's got a lot to prove with this game.

[27:43] You know, Jersey Jack's been a company with deep pockets and you know, short.

[27:48] Short.

[27:53] Like their pockets are deep, but the masterpieces they've made is a short list.

[27:59] And I think there are a company that's never quite put it all together.

[28:01] And I've been saying this about Jersey Jack all these years is I think the reason why we've

[28:06] been so sort of, you know, disappointed if you will is that our expectations for what they

[28:13] can bring the market I think have been have never been met.

[28:19] I mean that like when Jack says every game was going to get better than

[28:23] Wizard of Oz, like the games are beautiful.

[28:25] I mean, she got to think about it again.

[28:26] It took this company about eight years, eight years, maybe nine years.

[28:33] Actually, I think it was 10 years.

[28:36] It took this company 10 years to finally address having mushy flippers.

[28:44] Like seriously, like a lot of people's issues with the feel of a Jersey Jack

[28:50] was the flipper feel and they finally figured out with the I.O. board how to like get more

[28:59] snap and that's only really after kind of Steve Richie came on board.

[29:05] I think Harry Potter playfields are going to be a mixture of of beta and Mirko.

[29:13] I don't think one supplier can do all the Harry Potter playfields. It just seems like the orders

[29:18] are going to be so big.

[29:27] Look, Pirates of the Caribbean.

[29:34] It's a game that like it's a beautiful atmospheric game.

[29:43] It's got the maybe the best upper playfield in the history of pinball.

[29:50] It's got so much in it.

[29:54] And I haven't spent enough time on Pirates of the Caribbean.

[29:57] I have to be honest because the people that love it, I mean, they love it.

[30:03] Like they swear by it.

[30:06] And it's left an indelible impression upon the owners like no other Jersey Jack game.

[30:13] The rarity of it has arbitration like, you know, artificially elevate the price to the realm of it

[30:21] just being silly.

[30:25] I'm not supposed to say anything.

[30:31] Because it's not it might be a few years out, but

[30:36] yeah, you might not have to buy one used.

[30:39] Ah,

[30:41] Kananah, what are you doing?

[30:43] Kananah, you're not supposed to give like anything away for free.

[30:47] You're supposed to charge people five bucks, but let's just say,

[30:51] let's just say,

[30:54] and maybe some things that we're supposed to spin are going to spin again.

[30:58] Oh, doing did it again.

[31:00] Kananah did it again.

[31:02] I just got to stop.

[31:03] I'm going to stop.

[31:05] Maybe they're going to shoot.

[31:07] No, we got to sell these Harry Potter's.

[31:14] Yeah, I'm excited.

[31:15] You know, I think, um,

[31:18] I don't know.

[31:18] I'm like, I'm really like,

[31:21] I'm really nervous for barrels.

[31:25] I'm not, I don't even think,

[31:27] pinball brothers have a chance here.

[31:30] I have to be honest.

[31:31] Like I just, as much as I love Predator, I just,

[31:35] I can't see the pinball brothers

[31:38] punching at the same weight

[31:41] as Harry Potter and Eric Minnier and

[31:45] Ellen and the team on Kong

[31:48] and even barrels.

[31:50] Like I just, I just pinball brothers as a company has

[31:54] and shown us that they know how to make a great game.

[31:58] And so,

[32:01] seems like it's going to be the same players on the field.

[32:04] So why would I now expect them to do something epic?

[32:19] So, um, does the new barrels of fun game have 20 coils in it?

[32:25] Is that, is that, is that, has that been confirmed?

[32:27] Yeah.

[32:30] Now, I mean, look,

[32:34] I hate last year in transparency in no vaults.

[32:44] 23 coils.

[32:47] Yeah, no, carries, carries seemingly, um,

[32:51] you know, carries done a good job

[32:52] getting, you know, getting some good info out for sure.

[32:57] Um, I just think, I think everybody is feeling what I'm feeling right now.

[33:03] I don't care right now about rumors or

[33:06] it's got lighting or glass or coils.

[33:10] Like, it's like, you got to show it now.

[33:15] Like at this stage is like, we're a week out, we can have out.

[33:18] Like, it's put up a shut up time.

[33:22] It's put up a shut up time.

[33:24] I know Harry Potter is going to present tremendously well.

[33:28] I do.

[33:30] I just, I, I know Jersey Jack is not going to have a problem getting people into Harry Potter.

[33:35] Like, the big question marks to me are still like theme integration.

[33:38] Are they going to have muted clips or not?

[33:40] And like, how are they going to handle eight movies?

[33:43] Like, I hope they don't overcomplicated.

[33:46] It makes me nervous.

[33:47] It's a company that has a history of overcomplicating,

[33:50] IP, but it's show cats, which makes me a lot happier.

[33:55] Because I think Joe cats.

[33:57] Unlike Keith L. Winnows had to make a game much more approachable and much more fun.

[34:02] I do. I think, you know, when Keith came into the room with the Avatar,

[34:08] diner menu of how you play the game, I literally was like, I gotta go.

[34:14] I got, I'm not doing this.

[34:15] Keith, I'm not doing.

[34:16] I'm not collecting 22 song notes.

[34:19] I'm not doing it.

[34:20] I don't want to do this.

[34:21] I don't even know the names of any of these places.

[34:24] I don't even know the names of these characters.

[34:26] Let alone.

[34:27] I don't even remember music being a part of the damn movies.

[34:31] Like, I'm not doing this.

[34:31] I'm not going down this road with you.

[34:34] I don't want to collect 35 Guns and Roses patches.

[34:37] I don't, I don't want to do it.

[34:39] I don't want to do it.

[34:40] I, I, I, I, eight Guns and Roses patches would have been enough.

[34:43] Like, it would have felt like, I don't know.

[34:46] Like, you could actually get your head around it.

[34:48] Like, I don't want to collect 35 patches.

[34:51] I don't want to have it.

[34:52] So like, these four patches create a bundle.

[34:55] When you go deep

[34:58] into like, how Guns and Roses is coded

[35:03] and then you like, realize like how brutal the gameplay is

[35:06] with the balls draining left and right.

[35:10] All right, you made the game really hard and really deep.

[35:16] You know, I don't

[35:18] I don't think that's a recipe for fun.

[35:22] It's just the way I feel, man.

[35:31] The, um, the avatars lower playfields are terrible.

[35:35] They're just boring.

[35:36] They're, I mean, they're just boring.

[35:37] I mean, like they're terrible.

[35:38] They're just boring.

[35:41] I don't, I don't, I don't know how they got past the white wood stage on those.

[35:46] My computer wheel of death is going gang.

[35:48] So hopefully, um, it doesn't quit.

[35:53] So if it quits, if it quits, it'll be a night.

[35:57] We got a nice, we got a nice number here.

[36:00] 110, I mean, there's more people here than I am getting on my Saturday morning.

[36:05] So, um, yeah, this is an easy hour for everybody, right?

[36:09] Like nobody's really working now.

[36:11] Um, it looks like most people just want the ball to get out once

[36:15] in the lower play.

[36:17] Yeah.

[36:18] Is Harry Potter for sure movie base?

[36:21] And yes, it's movie base.

[36:22] Jack's already said they have all the assets to all the movies.

[36:25] Like, like he literally said that.

[36:27] Like word for word.

[36:30] Do you guys think it's dune?

[36:33] Like do you, do you think it's going to be dune?

[36:37] Or are we going to get sandbag and it's goonies?

[36:40] And they know it's goonies and they're just playing all of us.

[36:42] It would be the greatest.

[36:44] Switcheroo in the history of pinball marketing.

[36:50] I don't think it's dune either.

[36:51] I just.

[36:59] 23 coyotes sounds like a big sandworm.

[37:10] He said, but I know.

[37:14] Mad Max.

[37:15] I don't think it's mad Max.

[37:18] I don't know, right?

[37:19] I mean, I like at least the at least we're still wondering.

[37:31] Right.

[37:32] We all knew is Harry Potter.

[37:33] We all knew it was King Kong.

[37:35] We all, you know.

[37:41] I mean, chunk it eat the ball.

[37:44] You know, or sloth.

[37:47] You know, those two could eat the ball.

[37:51] Yeah, so I started speculating on whether or not it was little shop of horrors.

[37:57] Because in little shop of horrors, I think somebody has the license for that theme.

[38:04] And it fits within the barrels of fun kind of title.

[38:09] And Audrey five would be a really cool mac that could eat the ball and talk to you.

[38:16] So I don't know.

[38:25] Does anybody here know?

[38:29] Does anyone here know what the barrels theme is, but won't say?

[38:34] Watch every bit one be like, yeah, me, me, me.

[38:39] Uh, if anyone has super Mario brothers, Mario, it's a me and I'm Mario.

[38:45] It's a stern.

[38:48] Stern is going to have a Mario brothers.

[38:54] Well, look, if anyone's going to get GI Joe, it's going to be barrels because Brian Savage basically

[39:00] ran the GI Joe fan club for like 20 years.

[39:05] So minecraft would not sell at all.

[39:09] Like nobody, it's just, just minecrafts like like Gen Z.

[39:22] Ramps has little shop of horrors.

[39:26] Great.

[39:27] Well, the reason why like minecraft doesn't work, it's the same way like,

[39:34] I don't know if like Lego really works, right?

[39:37] I mean, you can make a pinball machine look like a Lego world and that might work, might not.

[39:44] But I just, I just don't know like if having just a minecraft world under glass is what people

[39:51] really want, especially in the pinball buying demo.

[39:55] Duke Nukem, what didn't even sell as a video game.

[40:03] Look, I think big trouble in the little China space balls would be fun.

[40:07] I think what I get excited about in pinball is the real potential for

[40:13] these boutique companies to just make small batch runs like 500 to 1000 is like,

[40:20] you know, a lot easier to do that opens the door for a lot more properties that

[40:25] aren't super expensive.

[40:27] But man, Harry Potter, we got Harry Potter.

[40:40] Bugs, bug is here.

[40:42] Well, future Rama, I think we might get from spooky one day if Ben Heck has anything to say about it.

[40:51] I do hope spooky pinball, you know, think about it.

[40:54] They made 500 ultra man's and I know ultra man is like the game they don't want to talk about.

[41:00] You know, ultra man is spooky pinball's version of Atari's ET video game, you know,

[41:06] for Atari, you know, I think if they could, spooky pinball would go buy up all the ultra man

[41:13] machines and bury them in the desert somewhere and just never have the game like be connected to

[41:19] their company ever again. But like if if they had the guts to make ultra man, then why not

[41:30] meet loaf and I mean this like if Ben Heck and spooky decided to like make a 500 run or

[41:40] should be a 666, you know, hell, the devil's number, a bad out of hell.

[41:45] If they made bad out of hell like one and two, like bad out of hell pinball,

[41:51] I mean seriously, you can't get better pinball rock and roll opera music than meet loaf.

[41:57] Like I'm serious when I say this like I'm serious.

[42:04] Ultra man is better than Jetsons. I mean, come on, that's like saying,

[42:11] I don't know that that's just that's not like that neither is Jetsons is a proof of concept.

[42:20] That's all that is.

[42:21] Oh my god, you know, ultra man, I walked away from my deposit and like I didn't even care.

[42:32] They were like I was like I'll pay you more money to just like give me a you know, a total recall

[42:38] on my purchase of that game because I just I don't know man. I don't know. Like it's it's got

[42:46] it's got to be fun if you're bugging the the team over at spooky right now. And by the way guys,

[42:51] I got I got to admit man, like me me praising you guys and like giving you guys shout outs has

[43:03] has created a little bit of a you know, I'm getting like vibes from my barrels of fun friends that

[43:10] maybe it's not it's not so fun to be inside the barrel is all I'll say because I think they literally

[43:22] I think they see you guys and they should I think there's like a competitive spirit between the

[43:28] two companies. There's obviously some history between the two companies and I don't even think it's

[43:33] negative. But I think I think you guys took it up a notch and I don't think they were expecting that

[43:42] and I think getting franchi on board was like the final like it's like it's like it was such a smart

[43:50] move and I don't know what they have like the ability to punch back like visually and aesthetically

[43:59] like with where you guys are at right now. It's it's that evil dead's like it's just like so damn sexy

[44:08] imitation is the sincerest form of flattery it is

[44:16] barrels should come here then instead of being but heard about it. Well look

[44:21] I've said this to my friends over there you know and I feel like I don't know it's just it's just

[44:33] not in their DNA like they want to build a company based on secrecy fine but it's weird like in

[44:40] their like statement yesterday like we on you know we want to be as transparent as we can we just

[44:48] don't want to stand in front of the camera. I should get it should get a free evil dead for

[44:55] helping sales yeah give me give me game number 8889 but just call it beetle juice okay can I get

[45:02] can I get evil dead number 8889 but just you know or beetle juice number one whichever way you guys

[45:09] want to do it fine with me. So like I think I think what would help barrels a fun you know because

[45:23] when I saw like the lighting tease today and I know they've got 20 something coils it's like

[45:29] I what what what's missing what's missing is we're a week out and I want to see David Van S being like

[45:39] gang I can't wait for you to see my game in a week. You know I don't care do it at three in the

[45:45] morning I've been working all day these 23 coils man can't wait to see what these things are firing

[45:52] right something like I don't know don't don't brand a new LED lighting system as in like

[46:01] horizon lighting we made $20 latch do this and we're gonna give you great value at $10,000 you

[46:15] know you know you're saying like oh yeah for $10,000 you can now have glass that's anti-reflective

[46:21] for $10,000 the glass should be anti-reflective you know I feel like Chris Rock like

[46:26] these pinball companies are now taking credit for stuff they shouldn't be taking credit for you know

[46:31] Chris Rock was like you know dads are like I'm not in jail you're not supposed to be in jail

[46:37] you're not supposed to be in jail you're not supposed to you can't take credit for not being in jail

[46:42] and it's like hey we got we got like $20 lights in our game you're supposed to have $20 lights in

[46:48] you know like I don't understand this like pinball class that reflects his terrible to look at

[46:54] like don't don't start taking credit for all this stuff

[47:02] you know it's just it's just like I don't know you know it's like I miss the good old days

[47:12] when people were like innovating like the dumbest stuff like remember the Robert Mueller the box

[47:17] that the game went into the pin pod you know like it was like yeah the man I won't even fit

[47:22] through a door and he literally got these pinball media to go there and assemble it in front of

[47:28] them like it's one of the greatest pieces of pinball content ever I've saved it all down it's on my

[47:34] so I think it's on my YouTube channel because I just I just didn't want to live in a world where we

[47:38] forgot that like six or eight pinball media went over there and actually didn't laugh in the guy's face

[47:47] that's ridiculous I be seriously I wanted to buy one of those pin pods and podcast from it and

[47:55] make it like a soundproof booth or something I mean legit like gang we're in a hobby we're Robert

[48:04] Mueller went up on stage and said he was gonna make more games in one year than all pinball companies

[48:10] combined right and they clapped they clapped nobody coughed and was like boom yeah no they clapped

[48:21] Steve Bowden was up there just wait Steve Bowden did the podcast tour just wait you see what we got

[48:31] I literally literally I mean I think the only Steve Bowden game the world will will bang on is

[48:39] barbecued challenge like you can't say this stuff you know it's too call he's controversial

[48:48] he's a controversial figure in pinball he's he's not celebrating you know like

[48:55] people who say they want to make pinball machines that have absolutely no experience in

[49:00] manufacturing like why is he doing this like what's this is not good like we got to make sure

[49:05] everybody feels welcome is is is is TPN done Josh I didn't I didn't listen to the latest show

[49:19] um I have to imagine you know Zach is probably just over a lot of it

[49:28] I

[49:32] is he not doing the pinball show anymore I think they'll still do like the flipping out videos though right

[49:40] I mean like I get it gang I get it I'm not gonna lie I'm gonna be completely honest with each and

[49:47] everyone of you it's I love doing my show they are still doing the show oh there's TPN is over

[49:56] but the pinball show survives oh yeah I mean I mean I mean getting like TPN was like never I it

[50:07] was never really like a thing was it like it was just a logo on everyone else's content so like

[50:14] TPN going away but the pinball show surviving is makes you'll never feel and you know what I'm

[50:21] saying it's not like it was the NWO like you'll never feel avoid the the the biggest show on it

[50:30] was the pinball show so like I you know like it was when it was created it was interesting right it

[50:37] was like this network of the world's best pinball content creators without me and Christopher

[50:42] Franci invited you know you know Jack Danger wasn't invited there was all that drama at the beginning

[50:50] but in the end like it ended up just being like all right it was just like a way to to sort of

[50:57] aggregate if you will a whole bunch of content you know Zach Smart like a whole bunch of content

[51:03] leading people you know to his his company

[51:10] never never had a problem with anybody trying to like increase their awareness you know I think

[51:19] would always surprise me is the the reverse is the amount of people that make content

[51:25] for seemingly like no gain whatsoever other than like just the I guess the love of making the

[51:32] content right which is fine but you see it now it's like the amount the inordinate amount of

[51:38] efforts certain people put into making pinball content and in the end like you know a lot of them

[51:43] are newer they haven't been doing it for as long as I have or Zach has or Franci has

[51:50] you know they just burn out can we get back to pinball just got an email from pinball start

[51:59] taking pot or pre-orders like I probably got that email too let me find it hold on

[52:04] oh we're about to get spam let's see I think I didn't get it

[52:10] I got an email about a missing cat

[52:19] um let me refresh maybe I got it to my I think my pinball star might be my other adress

[52:28] to weird that like

[52:37] uh nope I didn't get it can you can you uh what were the details of the pinball start okay

[52:44] what we knew we knew all that so nothing's changed I mean like there's nothing new

[52:50] well Marty is uh he he entered into the final round the moment he got into business with Damien

[52:59] you know so well I gang I don't need I don't need to hook up because I just think they're gonna

[53:08] they're gonna make as many potter CEs as they get orders for so uh you know you know me like if

[53:14] they only made a thousand Harry Potter CEs this was my this was my thing I was like I guarantee you

[53:23] they will sell for 20 grand on the second hand market right they only make a thousand

[53:28] I won't be able to test out that hypothesis because I think they're gonna take as many orders as

[53:34] people give them so I you know so now you know I'm I'm a buyer if I'm a buyer because I want to

[53:41] just buy it and and keep it and enjoy it I'm not a buyer to scout uh because again I think jack

[53:48] is getting announced they got five thousand orders because he because it because it it does jack

[53:53] no justice to be honest about the order number because think about it if he gets twenty five hundred

[54:01] orders for a fifteen thousand dollar game he's just gonna say you know so and think about it so

[54:08] those people order and they have to give a thing okay think about this gang because you know

[54:13] can it is a little bit smart I did go to boarding school uh that was very expensive and then

[54:17] private school you so I can I can do the logic here okay so think about it

[54:24] if Jersey Jack says we're gonna make okay let's say we're we're gonna open up a window for a week

[54:32] for Harry Potter CE orders let's say twenty five hundred people roughly legitimately place an order

[54:40] now placing an order means giving a two thousand five hundred dollar non-refundable deposit okay

[54:48] so he locks in two hundred and you know twenty five hundred times twenty five hundred okay

[54:59] I can't do that math sorry something some millions of dollars right um so then six point two five

[55:07] million thank you okay so but what happens you don't know you don't know only he knows how many

[55:16] actual orders he got so what happens when he says all right he knows he's got twenty five hundred

[55:24] money today in the bank or this week but he also knows the demand for this game is gonna be strong

[55:29] for five years gang we've got four thousand six hundred and eighty nine CE orders you know what I'm

[55:37] saying so we just he can announce that he's doubling the amount of actual orders he got because he's

[55:44] got half of those are non-refundable so he doesn't care and he doesn't have to prove that those other

[55:51] twenty five hundred orders are even real there's no transparency here and it it it's only to his

[56:00] benefit to just announce a large number and he'll only do that after all that deposit money has been

[56:09] secured so it's how I think if I'm if I'm them I I care more about getting people this game

[56:22] eliminating scalping and just opening you know you know making sure we get the highest margin

[56:29] back on the most amount of games and this will be the most profitable Jersey Jack game of all time

[56:36] and instead of watching the second hand jackass is like canada sell these things for 20 grand

[56:42] I'm gonna sell five thousand for 15 grand and we'll sell every one because it's Harry Potter

[56:51] I think that's what's gonna happen yeah Chris don't undercut yourself your way smart

[57:01] but I just think that's what's gonna happen I think that's what's gonna happen like and also like

[57:07] there's something to be said gang in like all right like Jersey Jack just destroyed

[57:15] he destroyed um scalping

[57:20] well just you know if you want the best version by the best version I'm not gonna like I'm not

[57:24] gonna let scalpers you know take money off the table that could be ours and I'm not gonna like

[57:33] force people who wanted to pay an inflated price no no market adjusted price here everyone who wants

[57:40] when gets one you know so I think it's gonna be yeah well built like on the second hand market now

[57:48] this game will also go the same the same direction as guns and roses well they will make so many

[57:57] Harry potters to the point where like nobody will ever have a problem getting one where nobody will

[58:06] really even care that much about the difference between a CE and an LE and yes of course

[58:13] they will uh become so ubiquitous but the good news for Jersey Jack is you know they need to buy

[58:24] themselves some time on this game because Steve Richie's game is not moving along as fast as they

[58:28] would like and you know they've got richy next and they've got three to four more games come in

[58:37] you know in development but also getting the thing about it is this it's like I think we're all

[58:46] now accepting the new reality of pinball that everything you buy is most likely gonna be a hugely

[58:53] depreciating thing and so then you know you can I think wisely wait it out a little bit and swoop in

[59:02] and get a home use only game and and I don't even think home use only I think you're gonna be able

[59:07] to be knocking on dealer and distro doors and get really good deals on everything

[59:17] um so you know I think it's gonna be you know I think it's gonna be like a really um it's

[59:25] gonna be a buyer's market on everything I think a lot of you guys here's what I also think is

[59:33] gonna happen I think we're gonna get over the next two to three years some of the best pinball

[59:37] we've ever seen we've ever seen and I think what's gonna happen over the next two to three years

[59:44] is we're gonna get games that make a lot of the older stuff feel dated and I think a lot of you

[59:52] are gonna want the new stuff and to get the new stuff you need to get rid of the old stuff and to get

[59:56] rid of the old stuff you're not gonna get anywhere near the price you think you were gonna get

[01:00:00] for your old stuff and it's just and I think what's gonna happen is this it's like

[01:00:06] it's like the auto industry like only the current hot version is really gonna hold

[01:00:14] and everything and then you're gonna see some I think you're just gonna see some

[01:00:19] significant losses like you've never seen before and I mean it

[01:00:24] we will get to the point where games like Venom and John Wick pros will be $3,000 like within two

[01:00:31] to three years and it's fine like it's only natural that you've oversaturated or you've

[01:00:38] made so many products and again there's like 13 companies pumping more into the market every year

[01:00:45] you know it's only natural that the only ones that will become collectible almost will be like

[01:00:51] it was back in the day it's like think about it like Adam's family wasn't like what the

[01:00:57] collectors sought out it wasn't Twilight Zone it was like King Kong because there was only like

[01:01:03] a handful of them it was Kingpin right I mean it was pinball circus like it's gonna become

[01:01:10] the same like there's only gonna be like a minute number of games that are truly collectible

[01:01:15] that are hard to get and and some of those might even be games that you know never fully got

[01:01:22] manufactured at the volume it was supposed to and again here's what's crazy I always stop thinking

[01:01:28] about this this is just they're here in the now and like back to the futures coming out this year as well

[01:01:39] portal for the win you know like I I think portal is probably the best game by multi-morphic to date

[01:01:49] I just don't think anyone's having a putting portal in the same playfield as no pun intended right it's

[01:01:59] not the same playfield as these other games right now and the problem with multi-morphic and you

[01:02:08] know the problem is like you just it just requires such a large commitment to go in on that platform

[01:02:14] you're not just buying one game like portal you're kind of psychologically agreeing in your own

[01:02:20] head to buy multiple games because that's the whole point if you're not swapping in and out the

[01:02:25] playfields the whole business model and the whole platform then makes no sense that's the tough part

[01:02:34] now if Jerry lines up five or six amazing games but it's also tough now too because portal just

[01:02:41] the modular part is like five six thousand so like I don't know like he's not this it doesn't work

[01:02:48] all of a sudden like you're paying almost the price of a storm storm pro to put in just one third of

[01:02:54] the playfield that's that's like that's that to me like defeats the whole purpose now

[01:03:00] no point in talking Alice as most america shut out

[01:03:09] does anyone want to talk Alice I I just want to see out this gameplay I mean every morning I'm

[01:03:16] like melvin can I get some clips of it being played like the game is pretty much done

[01:03:23] um so yeah gang I got uh this was fun this was this was a fun hour to do uh bill brand is

[01:03:30] I noticed you're not a member of canadus pinball podcast the amount of time you've listened to me

[01:03:36] live you could be listening in your Ferrari car stereo to the world's one time favorite pinball

[01:03:44] podcast or everybody I really do appreciate you guys hanging out uh it's been a lot of uh

[01:03:49] worry I'm going to scotland Thursday work has been really uh really rough lately a lot I'm on a lot

[01:03:57] of of new stuff there's just a lot of assignments there's new people I'm working with so I'm

[01:04:04] I'm struggling to find my footing right now in in my career I won't I won't lie like I just feel like

[01:04:10] I'm I'm either on like a lot of stuff or there's just like a lot of I don't know there's like growing

[01:04:15] pains but I'm like I feel like too old to to like to prove myself over and over and over again

[01:04:22] every every year it's just like I'm good at what I do let me do what I do and you know let's crush

[01:04:29] it like I don't like I don't like micro management I don't like committees I just you know every time

[01:04:34] I try to just do anything creative I run into a wall of other people's opinions and approvals and

[01:04:40] it's just it's just like just let let me go like let me build teams that get it and let's go that's

[01:04:47] how I like to do work I don't like committees I mean I just I just I'll give you an example of

[01:04:51] just like something I just try to go on a little bit of like let's just name our conference rooms

[01:04:57] you know something more fun problem is it's like oh how do you decide right who wants like I don't

[01:05:04] know like I just thought it'd be fun to name it after pop culture destinations you know that are

[01:05:12] iconic right they're not going to go in and out of season so it could be like Jurassic Park hog warts

[01:05:17] death star you know I don't know you Hawkins you know you could think about like

[01:05:23] River Riverdale like you couldn't just

[01:05:29] and then yeah everyone's got an opinion then you know we don't want to name them after

[01:05:34] conference I literally get this feedback we don't want to name them after conference rooms that

[01:05:38] could offend people offend people I don't even understand what that means like I'm not

[01:05:45] what what would be like I'm not naming the conference room like Tiananmen square you know I don't

[01:05:49] understand like it's not you know I'm not naming them the twin towers like I what what could

[01:05:58] and this is why this is why I love doing the pinball podcast because it's just like I don't know

[01:06:05] I just want to give you guys some thoughts and opinions about what's happening in pinball I don't

[01:06:10] have an editor I don't have a deadline to hit I don't have a boss I don't have a manager I don't

[01:06:15] have like you know kids' mentor I don't have like company goals to hit I don't have a growth target

[01:06:23] you know like I the more I tried to put a growth target on my own show the I went in the wrong

[01:06:28] direction when I stopped caring about it I went in a better direction so I just I just think like

[01:06:38] I appreciate what my point being is I appreciate you guys hanging out and I appreciate the connection

[01:06:43] we have here as a hobby and as a community and I mean this when I say this like I feel grounded

[01:06:52] in in our conversations and with all of you and I think what I think what we all love about pinball

[01:06:58] and this hobby is we can come through the door of this hobby and we can be who we are

[01:07:06] and I think in a lot of other places in life and a lot of our jobs like we kind of have to leave

[01:07:11] ourselves at the door and be who they want us to be sucks it sucks I don't know you know and it's

[01:07:18] like I could go down a whole tangent of like sucks like being anxious like that living in fear like

[01:07:23] that and and trying to always just be someone you're not like it's all the cliches in life are

[01:07:28] true people you know you only feel free when you're when you're living life to the beat of your

[01:07:34] own drum and when you're when you're not you're not free you're not free they could spin it any

[01:07:39] other way you know how they usually spin it like like we've got culture yeah it's like this

[01:07:47] thing about like company cultures is like you know you know it's culture like Italians have culture

[01:07:53] the Irish have culture the Chinese have culture you know America is God it's but like when a company

[01:08:00] says our culture I don't know you guys got food recipes you guys got did you write songs I'm sorry

[01:08:08] but like you don't have a culture until you've made music until you've like created a dish

[01:08:16] that the world loves until you've like penned a book that like captured a moment in time you know

[01:08:24] I'm saying it's like it's just it's funny to me it's funny to me and the best companies that do

[01:08:33] have the culture they they have you know they don't have to talk about it you know I'm saying it's

[01:08:41] like it's like it's like when you have to talk about your culture and I'm not saying like I

[01:08:46] actually didn't think my company has a very strong culture don't get me wrong but I've noticed

[01:08:51] this trend out there the more companies talk about their culture or their efforts over here and

[01:08:57] over here it's usually because they're like trying to mask like the lack of the very thing they're

[01:09:02] taking credit for you know it's like if a band said we make really good music you know that band

[01:09:08] does not make really good music right it's just the way it goes anybody everybody what are you doing

[01:09:15] streaming on a Tuesday oh you're late to the party all right everybody have a good night if you're
