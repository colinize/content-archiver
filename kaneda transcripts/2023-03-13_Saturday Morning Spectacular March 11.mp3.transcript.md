[00:00] Alright, we're a little bit late, but we're not missing a minute now.

[00:04] We're gonna get everybody in the house.

[00:07] We're gonna have a good time.

[00:08] Canada's pumped.

[00:10] Canada's got a lot to talk about in pinball.

[00:14] I just got off the phone with someone who just played Godfather.

[00:18] But let's welcome everybody into the Saturday morning spectacular, which is now gonna become

[00:23] a podcast as well.

[00:25] You'll upload this audio for everybody who is a club member.

[00:30] We're gonna talk about that.

[00:31] We have 572 club members.

[00:33] So I'm feeling good.

[00:36] Some might say I'm looking good these days.

[00:38] Oh, my James Bond Omega goes perfect with this outfit.

[00:43] I gotta go back to the gym more though.

[00:45] I'm getting there a couple times a week.

[00:47] I wanna go four days a week.

[00:49] Jesper's in the house.

[00:51] Bobby's in the house.

[00:52] Armin, we got Robert.

[00:54] He's in the house.

[00:56] We're gonna talk about him.

[00:57] We've got Hanyu.

[00:59] We've got American pinball just dropping.

[01:02] Hans, welcome to the party.

[01:03] Just dropping.

[01:04] Jeremy with his Twippy's just dropping.

[01:07] The Galactic Tank Force.

[01:09] Freakin' trailer showing us the crazy cabinet.

[01:13] And look, there are people out there that think that that's not real.

[01:17] It's just a promotional item.

[01:18] We're gonna talk about that because if that's the case, I don't know.

[01:23] We'll see.

[01:24] You gotta sell people that now.

[01:25] You can't get people's hopes up for that and then just not deliver.

[01:29] We got Flip Stevens in the house.

[01:31] Frank D'Angelo.

[01:32] I just spoke to Frank.

[01:33] He just played Godfather.

[01:34] We're gonna talk about his review of the game.

[01:36] We're gonna talk about everybody playing Godfather this week.

[01:40] It's been a good week to just get hands on the game, which is how it should be.

[01:44] I see in the photos, Ha-Man says Alessandro Jason's in the house.

[01:50] Who knows, not gonna be joining probably today because he said to me, I don't hang out with

[01:56] somebody of your ilk.

[01:59] ILC!

[02:00] He said my feedback on Godfather could have been classier.

[02:09] Mr. Christopher Franchi's mad at Canada.

[02:10] But you know, he'll get over it.

[02:11] He'll get over it.

[02:12] I'm gonna tell you, we're gonna talk a little bit about that.

[02:14] We're gonna talk about why Canada will never stop being Canada.

[02:19] I'm not gonna hold back.

[02:21] If I see something for the first time and it looks gaudy to me, I'm just gonna say it.

[02:26] Nothing.

[02:27] I didn't say the artwork was bad.

[02:28] So come on, Franchi.

[02:30] Get over it.

[02:32] I never said the artwork was bad.

[02:34] I said the entire package that they showed us.

[02:37] But we're gonna talk about that because as I see the Ellie of Godfather now, it's not

[02:42] nearly as over the top red and gold as it looked like in their photos.

[02:48] They over saturated the press assets.

[02:52] So why would they do that?

[02:53] Like have you guys seen the Godfather Ellie?

[02:56] It is not a bright red game.

[03:00] It is more like a wine color, like a red wine color that is on the cabinet.

[03:05] So we're gonna talk about that.

[03:07] Remind me to talk about art back and forth a little bit because you know, Canada always

[03:12] loves being called names and a bad person.

[03:15] I love it.

[03:16] I love it.

[03:17] It's, you know, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,

[03:25] pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,

[03:32] pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,

[03:37] pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,

[03:42] pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,

[03:45] 

[03:45] 

[03:45] 

[03:45] We got pulp freaking fiction to talk about

[03:48] Pulp fiction which I think my photo is real

[03:52] Because I know they asked to take it down on pin side, which is a sign that it is real

[03:57] We're gonna talk about what I think pulp fiction is gonna be the design direction they went in

[04:03] But let's start out by saying first and foremost

[04:07] What a great time

[04:09] To be in this hobby and have all of these freaking option it is

[04:15] Unbelievable the amount of options we have as consumers right now in the pinball space is greater than it's ever been in the last like

[04:22] Decade in one month. We have put out more games than normally comes out in a year

[04:29] Okay, so what a time to be alive in pinball. What a time to be competing for consumer dollars games are more expensive than they've ever been our

[04:38] Expectations are higher than they've ever been. There is gonna be winners and losers

[04:43] I actually think the biggest losers are people that run and buy right away because waiting and seeing I mean if you're not waiting to

[04:51] See how all this pans out. I think I think it's silly. Why not? Why not wait?

[04:57] There is no disadvantage to waiting. It is not hard to get any game

[05:02] Okay, you will be able to get a foo fighters le

[05:06] You will be able to get a godfather C. You will be able to get any scooby-doo trim you want

[05:12] So we're gonna talk about all this stuff and we are going to have in

[05:17] Like 50 minutes or so

[05:20] We are going to have the live voting to determine

[05:24] Which shorts canade-a-wares to the trippies?

[05:29] Down in Texas. We are going to have you guys vote

[05:35] There are the two front runners made it to the finals the Brazilian shorts and

[05:40] the classic

[05:42] Cargos

[05:44] Okay, look, okay, hold on a second. I want to who's this guy Adam Hicks

[05:49] Adam let me tell you something Adam. You're calling a big part of your this is what Adam writes

[05:54] You're calling a big part of your audience losers interesting marketing technique

[06:00] Yeah, anybody who buys a game before playing it right now

[06:05] I think is gonna lose out and is a loser

[06:08] Okay, and look if you can't take a joke Adam. I'm sorry

[06:13] Canade is playing the world's smallest violin for you because let me do me a favor Adam

[06:18] Start your own podcast do your own Facebook lives. You'll see you'll see you'll see you'll see how it easy is to make this hobby

[06:26] entertaining for eight freaking years

[06:28] You'll see how easy it is when there's a drought and you're able to get

[06:33] 572 subscribers

[06:35] Okay, you know, it's funny. Let's talk about this real quick. You know, it's funny is this man

[06:39] So every week I like to see you know where people are at with their subscriber bases because you know for years

[06:46] Everybody made fun of me. Canade is a loser. He's not in it for the right reasons. He's asking for money

[06:52] No one's gonna join his show. He shows stupid. He's so negative and then what happens?

[06:58] All these guys do shows for years

[07:00] They realize how time-consuming it is how hard work it is and they realize how

[07:06] Thankless it can be and then what happens this past year

[07:09] They see canade a crush in it and now they all open up patreon accounts and now they're all on board and they have like five minute

[07:15] Patreon commercials, but here's the funny part

[07:18] What patreon does?

[07:20] You know in the world in which numbers don't lie what patreon will do is it will show you

[07:27] How popular you really are how good you really are because people will support you if you're good

[07:34] And they won't if you're not right and even if look some shows don't care

[07:38] I get it but what I found funny was this

[07:42] Everybody who's a pinball personality has kept their patreon subscriber numbers to be transparent. Okay

[07:50] Now come on Jason. I'm talking to you right now pinball party

[07:53] He had seven

[07:56] Subscribers eight and then he removed the ability to see how many he had look bro. I'm glad your show is on the air

[08:03] Stay transparent man. I know you're just getting started with this patreon thing

[08:08] But don't run for the hills just because you only have seven or eight subscribers

[08:13] You know and canade just got 572

[08:15] Just just stay with it stay with it and people want to see because now

[08:20] No one's gonna want to join because people want to see your number climb and that's part of the strategy brother

[08:26] People like to see there that you're gaining

[08:29] Some fan base and notoriety within the community. All right. All right

[08:35] All right everybody all right all right

[08:39] Absolutely, okay, so where should we start? Let's start right now

[08:44] Let's start first in order of things that have happened. How about that? We're gonna go

[08:50] Galactic tank force pulp fiction and Godfather in that order because that is the order in which things have come at us in the recent days

[08:59] I think it's a good approach to take killing is crying

[09:03] Excuse my son

[09:06] So here's the deal let's start with galactic tank force

[09:08] We just saw the trailer from a Nordman universe and we got to see finally that they they they wheeled out

[09:15] They they did it the sons of bees did it man. They made this damn tank

[09:20] They rolled out with a tank bro in the most crowded pinball space ever in the history of pinball Dennis

[09:26] Norman clearly the handcuffs came off and the bro built a freaking tank that folds up to be a pinball game

[09:34] It's incredible incredible. I'm gonna say this right now and I was ragging on the tank legs

[09:41] Nobody made fun of them more than me. Nobody said they were a horrible mistake

[09:46] You might still think they are but I'm gonna tell you right now. I'm digging it. I'm digging what I'm seeing

[09:52] I actually like this thing. I think this is

[09:58] Freakin cool

[09:59] It made me like you know what it is like I was talking to Frank D'Angelo on the phone

[10:03] I just like Frank watch the video

[10:05] I want to get your real reaction and I was laughing and I felt giddy

[10:09] I felt like this is either the greatest idea ever or the worst idea ever and I wasn't quite sure

[10:16] But what I knew was this it just made me feel like a kid again

[10:20] It made me feel like excited that someone's at least trying to do something radically different and he's going all in

[10:26] They're leaning all in on this vibe. I have tons of questions about the practicality of this thing

[10:32] I have tons of questions about how much is this freaking thing gonna cost?

[10:36] I have tons of question about how do you assemble this thing? What kind of box is it gonna go in all of my questions?

[10:44] Don't have answers yet, and I've seen the playfield people and it's freaking packed and this game has got something

[10:53] Campy something different something unique and canada is here to tell you right now

[10:58] I'm a fan. I'm a fan of what I'm seeing American pinball and I'm here to tell you right now

[11:04] If I keep seeing what I like

[11:07] I might get one. I will get to play it before I buy though

[11:11] I'm still gonna wait and see but I'm just picturing like my future game room

[11:15] And I'm like I want different stuff where stuff that really means a lot to me, right?

[11:21] I want I want something that really is a work of art is limited has like some story to it

[11:27] You know and that just speaks to me and I love ice cream. I mean who doesn't freaking love ice cream

[11:34] I mean this is the goal of the game is to save the ice cream

[11:38] So look, but here's the thing and he just said it so much has said it

[11:43] Philip just said it's a marketing gimmick. That's not what you will get now look. I'm here to tell you right now

[11:49] If they don't sell me that freaking tank. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out

[11:55] I only want galactic tank force in tank freaking form. I won't buy it standard cab. I

[12:04] Need that red tank nozzle. I need it looking at me. Are you looking at me fix? I need it pointed at me

[12:10] I need that thing, baby. I need it. I need the tank treads. I need it all

[12:14] I either go full tank or no tank at all

[12:18] That's gonna be canada's new tagline you give us the freaking tank fix or don't give us the tank at all

[12:24] All right, I'm gonna convert one of them and ride that mofo into expo next year get ready buddy get ready

[12:31] No, I like it now and here's the other part

[12:34] Here's the other part mo foes listen to me

[12:38] Stop acting like we are not allowed to change our minds on

[12:44] Things like pinball machines. You're the oh, canada. You were ragging on the tank. Yeah, I was ragging on the tank legs

[12:51] I thought they look stupid. I had a stupid photo

[12:55] Now I'm seeing the real stuff and it looks good

[12:58] It's why I didn't leak the whole play field photo because it looks crappy in its form

[13:05] So you stop

[13:07] Telling me I can't change my freaking mind. I just did I might take this shirt off and wear another shirt today

[13:15] Is that is that gonna be offensive to some of you guys? He's he's changing his mind

[13:20] He's not allowed to do that. I haven't even had coffee yet. It's my first cup

[13:28] They can't change it no, they can't not

[13:31] Deliver the tank look from the campiness

[13:35] Dennis Nordman is an amazing designer

[13:38] Christopher franchise art package is gonna be killer on this thing and I look I like it cuz it's different like I'm so tired

[13:46] Thank you for the stars and bros

[13:48] Bros and and and women

[14:17] Okay, it's probably gonna be Pete Rosen. Maybe Hans. Maybe Billy B

[14:22] Okay, so look

[14:24] Galactic tank force we're gonna see it this week. It's coming. It's gonna be at Jack bar next Saturday

[14:30] If you're in New York City

[14:34] Jack bar will have a galactic tank force set up the Saturday before Texas pinball festival

[14:41] I'm not sure if that's gonna happen or true, but that's what John knows. It's what David Fix knows

[14:47] And I don't know if the whole freaking tank is gonna come

[14:51] Thank you for the hundred-dollar stars brother. I don't know if the whole tank is gonna arrive at Jack bar

[14:56] I don't know how this thing is gonna stick in a lineup

[15:01] So we'll see we'll see wait fix is driving here as we speak is it today

[15:08] John John is he bringing the game today?

[15:12] John John talk to us brother because if it's today then I'll be there today

[15:20] Come on Johnny Johnny Ehrlich don't lose us John just said David Fix is driving today to Jack bar

[15:28] Jack John Johnny Johnny don't go silent now brother. They just walk over there now. I got in the market

[15:36] I'll go. I'll do it. Don't make me do it

[15:40] It they don't open until like one. Okay, so now

[15:44] Okay, what what did Bill Brandes say Billy Brandes is we're gonna make fun of Bill throughout this show. I'm Bill. I'm just warning you

[15:51] Bill Bill I'm gonna make fun of you the whole show because Bill has turned into a

[15:57] Ball path baby about Godfather

[16:00] Bill is so far off Godfather's you know what it's it's getting to the point now where I don't even know the man anymore

[16:07] I don't even know if he recognizes his six pack in the mirror anymore

[16:11] I don't know if Billy B is if we can get him back people like he's so far up the Godfather's

[16:17] You know what it's there's no return like he's acting like this is the greatest game ever

[16:23] All right, look oh

[16:26] You meant David fix John just David fix is driving the tank over there as we speak. It was a joke

[16:33] Okay, not funny not funny John because we thought we were getting game. Okay

[16:38] Dude Bill Brandes said you're the last person that can make fun of people Billy. You know, that's not true Billy

[16:44] I'm not the last person. I might be near the end of that list, but I'm not the last person that can make fun of people

[16:49] But we do get to make fun of you because you have more money than all of us and we love you for that

[16:55] That's the thing. That's why this is a safe place

[16:58] rich men can come in here and

[17:01] We can appreciate their wealth and we can appreciate the silly decisions they make around pinball. It's great

[17:08] It's a safe place Billy. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm not gonna go woke on you and cancel you. Don't worry

[17:13] I'm not gonna no one's gonna walk across the stage and you know, we'll Smith you it's okay. We love you. We still love you

[17:20] All right, so let's talk about the next game on the list. Let's talk about pulp freakin fiction, right?

[17:25] I mean who saw this coming

[17:27] Who saw this coming? This is like, I mean, I did I mean, I told you it was coming

[17:33] I'd be like answer your own question Chris like I told you it was gonna be pulp fiction

[17:38] It was gonna be Roth thrills his first game. I told you CGC was gonna make it

[17:42] Everything was right. The only thing I was wrong on it's not franchise on artwork

[17:46] It looks like there's some like whoever did the art package with Mark Ritchie back in the 90s expect that

[17:52] So here's what pulp fiction looks like. I mean it looks like Quentin Tarantino went to them and said hey

[17:58] Let's make a game that looks like it came out in the same time period of pulp fiction

[18:04] Which is like what is it like the 94 is when pulp fiction came out?

[18:10] this looks like a

[18:13] 1994 pinball machine by Mark Ritchie, right like lethal weapon 3 everyone's been saying

[18:19] It looks very close to that

[18:21] And so I fully expect this game to look like a mid 90s pinball machine

[18:28] And and it looks like it's got all the cues of pulp fiction. It's got the Royale with cheese. It's got the diner

[18:35] It's got the you know the gun

[18:38] It's got Samuel Jackson and John Travolta on the slings and the most exciting part of the trailer

[18:45] We heard the song if this game has like

[18:50] Like ten of the iconic songs from the movie and again remember people they're working with Tarantino

[18:56] And if anyone can license this stuff, it's raw thrills, right?

[19:01] So I think I think we're gonna see that and I think here's the big

[19:07] Question mark right and this is the thing

[19:10] Ken a game that looks like it came from the mid 90s

[19:15] Will it impress people because pinball has come a really really long way in the last 20 years and

[19:22] We're used to just a much higher level of everything of artwork of of like

[19:28] LCD screens of like clips from the movie of everything

[19:33] All of where pinball is gone might not be in this game. I agree with Cliff. I

[19:39] Think it's gonna work. I think people are tired of these old

[19:44] overly complex rule sets with a million things happening on the screen that Billy B is never gonna figure out

[19:51] He's only gonna play the game 200 times a year

[19:53] I think people are tired of like, you know trying to figure out a pinball machine like like they're in math class

[19:59] I think people are over. I think they're overly fatigued by this

[20:04] Like the only way a game could be fun and stay in your home is if you make it like overly deep and complex

[20:11] And I think if pulp fiction is like a game you can walk up to and just start

[20:18] Vibing out with all the pulp fiction music and the toys are fun. I think it's gonna be

[20:24] You know an interesting response to that game. The good news is this

[20:30] We get to see it on Monday people the full reveal is Monday and

[20:36] For those of you saying where's my cactus Canyon?

[20:39] I don't think Roth thrills cares where your cactus freaking Canyon is that and why did any of you pre-order cactus Canyon?

[20:47] Why did you do it? They weren't on the line

[20:50] Ryan White has gone to Mexico and has lost something like I mean I always feel like that guy is just like blowing lines or something

[20:56] I don't know what he's doing

[20:58] Like where is he doesn't communicate with his customers. You know many times people hit me up every week

[21:03] Like where's my cactus Canyon le and I don't even have any sympathy for them

[21:07] Like why did you buy a game when you knew it wasn't even on the line?

[21:12] And so like you really should not you really should not have gone in on it unless you knew you were gonna get it sometime soon

[21:20] And it's look it's been a year and a half. It's been a year and a half now

[21:27] Cliff you're a good guy, buddy. Um, alright, so look pulp fiction Monday, we will know more

[21:34] Huge theme, though, like way more popular than Godfather with this audience

[21:39] Juggernaut, juggernaut, the first Quentin Tarantino movie ever to have a freakin pinball machine

[21:46] And if he was involved in this thing

[21:50] game

[21:51] game, when that

[21:53] you know, the music hits

[21:55] It markets itself

[21:57] It, they, don't need, they, don't need, a cheesy, video

[22:00] They don't need to build a freaking tank it freaking markets itself

[22:05] Don's pinball podcast is here Don welcome to the party brother. I'm enjoying the content you guys are not listening to Don

[22:12] I highly recommend it. He's under see understands the principle that a pinball podcast

[22:18] Only needs like no more than 30 minutes to tell you everything going on in pinball like these 90 minutes three hour

[22:25] streams of a game

[22:27] Three hour streams of a game

[22:32] No, thank you no, thank you ever ever

[22:38] Okay

[22:42] Well, I expect straight down the middle to have videos for everything it's what they do Carrie

[22:46] It's what you do. It's like that's it makes sense. You know, they're selling pinball machines

[22:51] You know people ask me like I know that we don't always get along

[22:54] You know I unblocked by the way Zach and Greg so you can go tell them they can join the show again

[23:00] Okay, I went back and forth on it. I'm like, you know what? It's time. We take them out of the penalty box

[23:05] I'm fine with them coming back here. Look look there's no there's no

[23:10] Hard there's no long-lasting like bad blood. I don't I don't believe the energy it requires to stay angry with people is freaking worth it

[23:19] You know, I've gone through a lot of personal traumatic stuff recently in my life

[23:23] Some of them know Ken Cromwell knows what I've been through Christopher French. He knows what I've been through

[23:26] I don't I don't I don't hold I look and I don't use that as a crutch or an excuse for any of my behaviors

[23:32] I stand behind everything I say in pinball

[23:34] But life is too short to hold on to these feuds. I never did what they said I did

[23:39] I never sent any personal threats to anybody so like they're they're unblocked

[23:43] So if they want to come join this fine, you know, they I took all the lashes in the world people

[23:48] I took all the lashes in the world. I was told I have no friends

[23:52] I was told every name in the book I've been called and look I don't care

[23:55] I know I know I have no his beautiful wife the most beautiful child. Okay, and

[24:02] They might get blocked again. Look look again. I want to go to Texas and have fun

[24:06] I don't think there needs to be any hostility or animosity amongst anybody now look

[24:11] Do I feel scared walking the floor at TPM?

[24:15] After some of my recent, you know, analysis is a

[24:19] Analyst and an analysis of all these games. No, I'm never that afraid

[24:25] But you know, there's definitely some people that don't want to see me like Jack danger probably wants to see me

[24:31] Zombie Eddie would love to see me

[24:33] You know who doesn't want to see me probably, you know, I would assume the the godfather team

[24:39] They they don't like me too much

[24:40] I've been saying some stuff about their game that doesn't fall in line with the bye-bye-bye

[24:45] Content that they want to create around the machine and that's fine. You know, we're allowed to have differences of opinions

[24:51] You know, let's talk about godfather

[24:54] Okay, let's talk about it

[24:57] and Billy

[25:00] Correct me if I'm wrong

[25:01] great design by Eric Minier

[25:04] Like I really like what Eric did with the design. I think it's gonna be Jersey Jack's best shooting game

[25:09] Okay, so great design by Eric

[25:12] Eric did everything he needed to do in terms of the layout of the game

[25:18] I think there's really not any real toys in this game though

[25:22] And and like and again, I just talked to Frank D'Angelo. He just played it

[25:27] I don't see many toys in the game

[25:29] And and that's that and I heard the you know the gangster with the tommy gun up the middle is not even that exciting to shoot

[25:36] Okay

[25:37] So that's what i'm hearing from people who played it

[25:42] I heard I heard I think Zach said this I think some I correct me if i'm wrong, but that that shots are the new toys in pinball

[25:49] I mean

[25:50] If if we if we believe that that shots are the new toys in pinball

[25:56] We're in big trouble

[25:58] We're we're in big trouble. They're not like a shot is not a toy

[26:03] a

[26:04] Sidewalk is not

[26:06] A roller coaster a toy is a toy is a toy

[26:10] And so I just think we need to be like a little bit careful people like we need to be careful that we're not gonna start

[26:16] like

[26:17] Making excuses or apologies and look I get it like there are people that are just trying to sell you the game

[26:24] And their best friends made the game and so they're gonna make content and statements

[26:29] To get you to feel excited and they're hyping it and that's fine like

[26:34] I don't really care that people make hype content

[26:38] Um, but a shot is not a toy

[26:41] So I think the toys in the game are pretty non-existent. All right, as is that

[26:47] Franchi's artwork I like a lot he always does his thing

[26:51] I don't see anything not to like and so if you want to go tell mr. Franchi

[26:55] That he doesn't need to tell canada. He's a bad person

[26:58] So here's it here's the analogy he gave me and I want to I want to talk about this and this is not me like

[27:02] Sharing a hugely confidential private conversation

[27:06] And and it's not a bad analogy. It just doesn't work with pinball. He said it would be like going into a friend's house

[27:13] Who is making you a sushi dinner?

[27:16] and you eat it and

[27:19] It's terrible, but instead instead of saying it's terrible to your host

[27:25] You politely, you know

[27:28] Say something that doesn't like blow them apart, right? Okay

[27:32] And I think you know and he was referring to me saying that like godfather looks gaudy

[27:36] Like it comes from an italian bathroom or trump towers

[27:40] And that the godiness was like, you know, just like upsetting me if you will. Okay

[27:46] The problem with that analogy

[27:48] Is when you go

[27:50] Over a friend's house to have food that they prepared for you that food is free

[27:58] and free

[27:59] and friendship

[28:01] Is an important word

[28:03] When i'm analyzing a

[28:07] $15,000 pinball machine

[28:10] i'm not going to

[28:13] politely react to it. I'm not going to

[28:18] Hold back my feelings. I'm a consumer

[28:22] Who is responding

[28:24] To again, do you need to come here a bit?

[28:27] Okay, um, so like it's not the same analogy man, of course, I'm not going to tell my friends. They're cooking sucks

[28:34] but you know

[28:37] Billy brand is talking about tank beds. Okay

[28:40] So like I think the artwork is fine. I think it looks good. I think there was a lot of confusion about who did the playfield artwork

[28:47] Which was weird. So I was watching the carl stream

[28:52] People kept saying this looks like franches best playfield to date which it's not

[28:59] It's not for two reasons. It's not because he didn't do the playfield and it doesn't look anywhere near as good as the monsters

[29:05] I would even argue. I like batman even better. I just I just you know, I just think he's done more regarding the galaxy

[29:12] So not only did he not do the playfield

[29:14] But like nobody knew who did it like it was it was like jesper or jasper

[29:19] I think it was jesper and mr. DeWynn, you know

[29:23] over there in france

[29:25] so like

[29:27] But in the in the chat nobody was like correcting me like franches and he was in the chat

[29:33] He was in the chat. I don't remember seeing him being like I didn't do it. Like I just you know, it was weird

[29:40] So you look look the game the game looks fine the game shoots fine

[29:46] the game is

[29:48] It's it's it's good on all these levels. I don't think it's great on any levels

[29:53] Like I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest like there's nothing I'm seeing that just blows me away the way when I saw god zilla

[29:59] The way when I saw you know games. I'm just going through a list of games like, you know, like lord of the rings

[30:03] I don't know my favorite games. I can go down a list of medieval madness attack from mars

[30:08] There's just the game just doesn't it just doesn't feel like it pulls you in in this immersive way

[30:13] And I'm just not feeling it and it's fine and I'm allowed to feel that way about it

[30:17] And the reason why the game isn't pulling me in is simply this it's the worst

[30:22] It's one of the it might not be the worst it is one of it because spinal tap will take the cake

[30:27] It is one it's probably even mohm actually not because there's more theme integration and spinal tap than this

[30:32] It is one of the worst theme integrated pinball machines. I've ever seen

[30:37] And I will argue this fact against anybody

[30:41] It's not the godfather gang if this isn't the godfather it is basically king pin

[30:47] meets like

[30:48] Cactus Canyon not even that it's just king pin. It's king pin two

[30:53] And and there's no real godfather in it

[30:56] And I get I get their reasoning for doing it this way. It just doesn't work

[31:02] For me it might work for you

[31:05] But if you love the iconic movie and you walk up to this game

[31:08] And you just got off of the big labowski and you just got off of like

[31:13] Jurassic park or you just got off of you know, I don't know you go down every like Godzilla

[31:17] You go off of all the major games that are guns and roses any game

[31:21] Wizard of Oz like freaking almost every single game

[31:25] And then you walk up to this thing and the way the godfather movie is just mashed up

[31:31] Like you don't see the full scenes. You don't really you know get pulled into the moment you remember

[31:39] It's so stupid it's so stupid to be like, I'm glad they didn't bill

[31:43] I don't mean like you're not stupid bill, but it's stupid approach. Come on bill

[31:46] I'm glad they didn't follow the movie

[31:49] Then why make the freaking movie bill?

[31:53] What the hell so then it's just like bill it makes no sense for the I'm glad they didn't follow the movie

[31:58] Then it's not a good theme for pinball

[32:02] I I I just like when I hear people say this I'm like

[32:06] It's so stupid. It's so stupid

[32:10] To like make a game based on a movie and then be happy. They didn't follow the movie

[32:16] It's like let's make Shawshank redemption

[32:18] And just have it be about selecting some of the prisoners in the movie and you get to play as Brooks

[32:25] And you get to play as other people you're not Andy Dufresne trying to get to say what to nail

[32:29] Let's no let's throw that away and let's just make it a movie about prison with some Shawshank clips cut up

[32:37] Ridiculous

[32:39] Bill bill like no one agrees with you man. Nobody does anyone agree with bill

[32:44] I mean who agrees who's right canada or bill? Let's take a live poll here

[32:49] That that it's that it was a good move to make the godfather not really put the movie into the game

[32:54] Let's see. I'm just curious. Maybe bill. Maybe you're right

[32:58] Maybe you're right. Maybe maybe maybe people agree with you

[33:01] John is John. Of course. John is saying bill

[33:08] John, you know, I love you

[33:11] Look, it's a divided camp. It's a divided camp

[33:15] And the movie is not in the game guys. It is not in the game

[33:21] Those it's like they bought five minutes of clips and that's it. Where is the movie of Derek forget it

[33:26] Derek Derek is the other one

[33:28] Derek like sleeps under a jersey jack pinball duvet cover people like Derek. I love you bro

[33:34] but man, it's like

[33:36] I could tell like you don't you don't you don't

[33:39] You you can't live in a world unless you get this like

[33:43] This complex jersey jack rule said that you need to learn. I'm not learning this shit. I'm not doing it

[33:49] I just curious. Sorry about that

[33:51] But I'm not doing it

[33:54] All right, all right, all right, so look

[33:57] Worst theme integrated pin I've seen in a long time

[34:00] I'm happy you guys have the option to buy it

[34:03] The game is is gonna

[34:06] Is gonna be an interesting thing because here's the thing is like and I just I talked to people who played it

[34:11] I've talked to some people who own it or I don't think anyone has in their home yet

[34:14] But they have it in their location or their barcade

[34:16] I think this game

[34:20] Here's the thing I here's the thing

[34:24] I think this game

[34:25] I think the flame on this game is gonna go out pretty quickly and and not just because there's so many games coming out

[34:30] And again, not because I'm rooting against it

[34:33] I just don't see godfather

[34:35] Being a strong consistent seller for jersey jack pinball like a guns and roses was like wizard of oz was

[34:41] Okay, like willy wonka like eventually became but I just don't see it not at these prices

[34:47] But I just don't see this theme

[34:50] lasting very long in people's collections either because of like

[34:54] You know, I think you're gonna get tired of the mobster telling you everything to shoot

[35:00] And I think that's gonna be the issue is like if you heard something to call that shoot the orbit shoot the orbit

[35:05] Let's peel the face off this guy. Well, we got a podcast a wise guy here boys

[35:10] Look at this guy eat my tommy gun canada

[35:16] I mean, where did they find these voice actors? They could why didn't they just get real italians?

[35:21] That's the thing is like, I don't know why they didn't do the callouts

[35:25] more like

[35:26] The mobsters in the movie like they're done in this like

[35:30] Looney Tunes way and I'm just like

[35:33] What do we got here guys

[35:35] Yeah, no it makes no sense to look look

[35:41] I'm just gonna say godfather

[35:44] To me

[35:45] Is how you take a questionable theme and I think you kind of just give up on it and just make a different pinball machine

[35:53] Now look you I would argue like foo fighters

[35:56] Did the same thing but executed it a million times better

[36:00] I mean foo fighters took a band

[36:03] And made a completely different game about like saving the earth from aliens

[36:07] But it's just executed a thousand times better than godfather. It is executed from a theme integration standpoint

[36:14] Killian, what are you banging on buddy?

[36:17] He's playing the drums bang on those drums

[36:22] So like we'll see we'll see I mean look it's gonna be fun. I'm gonna have to sit down a little bit. I'm getting tired. Hold on

[36:29] Hold on and for you guys

[36:32] Who listened to this in podcast form? I do apologize when we air the audio only that there's gonna be periods in which

[36:39] There's more silence or i'm reading comments and it's just the way it is

[36:43] And i'm not gonna do too much editing because I always said i'm not gonna you get you get enough

[36:47] This is just like a bonus thing you're gonna get is the audio from this you you already get enough great content from canada

[36:54] on the club

[36:56] Federal mirrors still on the ground because of killian's birthday

[37:00] I'm sorry

[37:02] Made in does the same thing. Yeah made in the made in metallica foo fighters all executed perfectly

[37:08] And I just because here's the thing

[37:10] Iron made in and foo fighters and metallica

[37:14] They're so in those games like you feel

[37:17] Part of that universe when you play the godfather you don't feel part of the godfather movie at all gang

[37:25] How are they doing on those bongos

[37:28] Um

[37:31] No, I look I want to thank everybody who's a club member

[37:35] We can get to 10,000. Hey, here's this billy if you if you give

[37:40] If you give a

[37:41] If you give a thousand stars billy, I won't say anything negative about godfather all week. It's gonna be hard. It's gonna be hard

[37:49] It's worth it. You know you want to do it

[37:51] Look I'm gonna play it. I'm gonna enjoy it the same way I played toy story and enjoyed toy story

[37:58] And I'm just never gonna buy it like I just I don't want I I I know exactly what they're doing with the game

[38:05] I don't want it. I didn't want it to begin with and I still don't want it afterwards

[38:09] I find it funny how everyone's just like flip-flopping on it like no one wanted godfather

[38:14] Now it's like, oh, yeah, it's the greatest of all time. Like you people are so

[38:18] Comical like theme matters and theme integration matters

[38:23] And if you don't think so then watch as these and I'm just gonna say this

[38:29] I'll make a bet

[38:30] I'll make a bet with billy b

[38:33] I will bet billy b

[38:35] That godfather collectors editions

[38:39] Within six months

[38:41] We'll be selling for 12,000 dollars or less

[38:45] Okay, within six months

[38:48] Godfather collector editions

[38:50] We'll be selling for 12,000 dollars or less

[38:55] Will you take that bet billy b? Let's bet

[38:59] Let's just bet

[39:02] Let's bet 120 dollars. Okay bill 120 bucks, which is nothing. It's like it's like your your croissant costs more than that

[39:12] How about we do it?

[39:14] 12,000 or less within six months

[39:17] Now remember they're not even gonna ship these

[39:22] They're they're not even gonna ship these until May and I think the other thing that's gonna happen

[39:28] The other thing that's gonna happen

[39:30] Is enough time will be put on the le's

[39:34] Where if people start, you know, when the honeymoon period wears off and people start maybe get start to get sick of the music or the callouts

[39:42] or the, you know

[39:43] Advanced calculus rule sets. Jersey jack requires you to learn

[39:48] What's gonna happen, right? All of a sudden the hype is dead by the before a single ce leaves the factory

[39:55] All of these games are now gonna suffer from this

[39:59] Okay

[40:02] What is gonna be in six months? What will anything mean bill bill?

[40:08] Will you take the bet bill?

[40:10] Will you take the bet? I'm not hearing a yes or no. You just say no if you don't want to take the bet

[40:14] Don't talk to me about the economy and say don't don't divert

[40:18] I know there's a lot of diverters in the game billy. I know you love your ball pathways

[40:23] Don't don't do it. Don't think a shot is a toy

[40:27] Will you take the bet?

[40:30] Yes or no just yes or no

[40:34] Yes or no

[40:37] Your bet is stupid. I'll take that as a no. Okay bill. Can I can I can I

[40:42] Translate your comment that your bet is stupid as a no

[40:46] Okay, okay billy b

[40:49] billy b

[40:51] He knows i'm right. He knows i'm right. He's he's gonna list his godfather

[40:55] For 12,001 dollar watch this in six months

[41:00] Bill brandis will sell his godfather ce for 12,001 dollar firm

[41:05] He will refuse to go

[41:07] 12,000 or below because he doesn't want me to be right and that is going to happen

[41:12] I can't wait till the day he sells his machine. He's knees get I can't wait till the day he sells his godfather ce

[41:18] It's gonna be a glorious day. It's gonna be a glorious day. Um, all right, so

[41:23] Look, we got we covered off on godfather. We've got about 10 minutes to the cargo short

[41:28] Voting which is going to be fun and so wait. He agreed to the bet

[41:33] Did he take the bet is billy back billy b back

[41:36] Old billy buchet. He's he back

[41:39] um, look

[41:41] You know, it's crazy

[41:42] Is the options right now. Let's count them out. Let's count them out

[41:46] Foo fighters. Did you see stern put out a press release that foo fighters sold out in record time? I think

[41:52] So all the le's are spoken for the only thing is is like I think it's I think look I I still

[42:01] I still think foo fighters looks great. I I I still

[42:05] Am excited to play foo fighters. I think foo fighters is is is is a is a perfect pin

[42:12] In all and you know, but I think it's also overpriced

[42:15] And I I don't see like the wow toy in it, but I still love what I see

[42:21] I I wouldn't pay 13,000 for foo fighters. I think it looks to me like an $8,500 stern le

[42:29] I'm allowed to say this stuff jack danger knows it's like jack danger didn't price the game

[42:33] He has no control over this. He's caught up if anybody wants to make a machine for stern now

[42:37] This is what they're going to price your game at but I don't see 13k in it

[42:41] Like I don't and there's no topper which is scary right because imagine if they release a

[42:47] $2,000 topper for this game. You're now 15 grand on a stern le

[42:53] And it's just too much like I love the package. I think it's great

[42:57] Um, I I just I have a hard time with these prices

[43:01] You know, and I'm I'm a I'm a pin hypocrite because I just uh, I have a couple payments more and

[43:08] $25,000 batman sle will be mine again

[43:12] Um, I love the game

[43:15] I played it for two years. I think it's the best coded game. Maybe in the history of pinball

[43:21] It's not the best shooting game billy. I get what you're gonna say, but batman

[43:27] From a

[43:28] experiential standpoint might be one of the best theme integrated games of all time

[43:33] And I mean that even though like the crane makes no sense

[43:35] But the reason why it's like you just feel like you're playing the batman and robin tv show

[43:41] It's like it's everything that that godfather is not it's everything godfather is not

[43:48] batman 66 is lineman sheets's greatest

[43:52] Coded game ever

[43:55] And nobody knew how to pull people in and connect with the software better than lineman sheets

[44:01] Okay, and it's that's the truth

[44:04] It's also stern's most beautiful pinball machine of all time still to this day

[44:10] Okay, we can we can disagree cliff albert

[44:14] Look guys guys

[44:16] Let's be hard on the games not on each other. Okay

[44:20] Only I'm allowed to call people stupid. Okay, that's that's that's the rules of the canada the canada club, right?

[44:27] Um, so look we've got let's count the games food fighters

[44:32] Okay, we've got scooby-doo

[44:34] We've got james bond

[44:36] james bond 60th

[44:38] we've got

[44:40] um godfather

[44:42] we've got

[44:44] Galactic tank force we've got pulp fiction

[44:48] We've got queen. We've got final. Well, I always forget the name final destination. No final

[44:56] final

[44:58] resistance

[45:00] And we've got spinal tap coming

[45:04] That's 10 games

[45:07] In the last three months

[45:09] 10

[45:12] Nobody does anybody care about final resistance. What a

[45:16] What a total

[45:18] failure of a launch. I mean, I it's like they're not doing anything

[45:23] I mean, it's like I I think they really just messed up like jerry

[45:29] He hasn't built most of the weird owls

[45:32] Nobody trusts that they're gonna get the game anytime soon. It's 11,700

[45:39] I think I don't know like

[45:42] Scott Denisi like

[45:44] He doesn't you know

[45:46] He's he's it's it's like this. It's like multi morphic

[45:50] Is probably one of the least purchased platforms

[45:54] Going right. I mean

[45:56] I don't know did home pin maybe home pin has sold more thunderbirds than jerry sold of multi morphics jerry won't release the number

[46:04] So he doesn't release the number

[46:06] I don't know how many he's sold. I would guess

[46:10] no more than

[46:12] 300 multi morphics have been built in a decade

[46:16] and so like

[46:18] It's just like for scott denisi to make a game on that platform

[46:24] You know, it's not really gonna work like i'm sorry like it's not like weird owl brought in the weird owl fans

[46:32] but you know this sort of

[46:35] kind of cool

[46:36] Vibey

[46:37] TNA 2.0

[46:39] It's just not gonna it's just not you're just people are just not gonna plunk down

[46:43] The reason why we plunked down money on tna. Can anyone answer that question?

[46:48] It was $6,000 game guys

[46:51] We were willing to support scott denisi when tna was a $6,000 game

[46:57] Let's see how many people want to

[46:59] 11,700 scott denisi game and then you're stuck with a multi morphic

[47:04] Which means you're gonna have to want to buy the other platforms, which means you're not only spending 117

[47:09] You're then

[47:10] 14,000 in if you want another game like it's it's not happening

[47:16] It's not happening. It just doesn't work this modular plug-and-play model. It just will never

[47:22] Dude pinball is selling tens of thousands of games a year

[47:27] Why would you not just make a normal pinball machine?

[47:31] And just become a millionaire jerry. It's like right there

[47:37] Just do a normal game. It's not your dream. I know

[47:43] Jerry's like the Tucker of pinball is like he's got this dream and it's different

[47:49] but it's not commercially working and

[47:54] And also like he doesn't have the manufacturing down

[47:57] He look weird out gave jerry a chance

[48:00] But because of lackluster manufacturing

[48:04] Nobody's who's gonna stay in on it. Who's gonna order one? I don't want to wait a year. You tell people you're gonna wait a year

[48:11] Like you're not making some bespoke

[48:14] limited edition

[48:15] Rolex that's like meticulously made like jerry you're making a pinball machine

[48:20] I can walk in a coin taker and throw a freaking stern and jersey jack machine

[48:25] Into my freaking truck and be home that day enjoying my new toy

[48:29] Like it's like he knows all this. I'm not you know, I'm not like I'm not like

[48:34] There's not groundbreaking insights here

[48:37] I'm just saying that came that game sort of got released and went like real quickly you can see why like

[48:42] Nobody's really no one's really gonna be buying me a drink. Okay

[48:45] We're almost at the

[48:47] Voting period. I also want to let everybody know

[48:51] Show of hands

[48:53] Who will be going to the texas pinball festival?

[48:59] Who will be attending

[49:02] Texas pinball festival? I have some news. You're all gonna want to hear

[49:09] Who will be going to tpf talk to me people mr. Jay Sellers will be there

[49:16] Robert says he wish he could mark will be there

[49:21] Frank

[49:24] Okay, no, Jeremy it's over

[49:27] We can do better with stars people come on. Where's Pete Rosen at?

[49:33] All right, so here's the deal here's the deal miles to see you there Brad

[49:39] I

[49:40] Am always public enemy number one. So, you know, I try to hide out in the bathroom during most of the show

[49:45] So you can find me in the bathroom normally

[49:48] Or

[49:50] I have secured

[49:53] A great happy hour

[49:57] Which is gonna be

[49:58] Earlier than it was last time

[50:00] I'll tell you why I don't want anyone to miss any of the seminars

[50:04] So this the friday of tpf. I believe it's march 24th

[50:10] I will be hosting a canada club

[50:14] Hangout at perry steakhouse, which is right across the street from the show. It's like it's less than a two minute walk

[50:22] um

[50:23] Mark down these hours

[50:25] Canada will be hosting his happy hour

[50:28] From two o'clock. I will put up. I will do reminders. I will let the club members know

[50:33] From two o'clock to four thirty

[50:36] So we will have two and a half hours

[50:39] To mingle

[50:40] Get some snacks get some drinks have some fun

[50:45] Hang out with each other. Um, will you be streaming it? Yeah, I could probably set up facebook live for a little bit

[50:51] Um, we can go around and say hi to everybody. We'll do that

[50:54] um

[50:55] But you know, I want to I want to engage

[50:58] The people there. I I don't want to do this for everybody, but we'll do a little live from there. You know, canada. I always do that

[51:03] um

[51:04] So here's the deal. So that is going to happen. It's super fun. We're in the bar area. It's more casual

[51:10] um, the reason why it ends at 4 30

[51:14] is is is we're there's going to be

[51:18] A american pinball seminar at five. I think jersey jack is at half. So you won't miss anything

[51:26] It is on you I will be ordering to go

[51:31] Billy Billy Billy Billy Billy Billy Billy Billy Billy

[51:35] Bill brand is people he's funny. He's funny

[51:38] Look, I I love bill brand is he's um, he's one of my really good pinball friends and

[51:44] Sabrina's great bill was at my wedding people. So like

[51:48] bill has met my parents. So if you ever want to

[51:52] Understand what made me, you know, I'm making killin right now

[51:56] bill has met my parents and bill loves them like bill bill bill bill gets them more than me

[52:04] But they are very very very amazing people

[52:07] Um, they're very strong individuals. They've had such a great life

[52:12] They've had such an amazing son in me

[52:17] Who's so humble? Um, no, but but it's just

[52:22] You know, sometimes I think about how much of an advantage I've had in life just being educated and

[52:31] And the opportunities I've been given that I've probably not taken full advantage of like maybe I shouldn't be spending most of my time

[52:38] Doing pinball stuff and maybe some other stuff that probably would make me a lot more money

[52:43] But it's not about the money to me. It's about the community. It's about the fun. We have together

[52:48] It's about the time we spend together

[52:50] Now all that being said

[52:52] The time has come ladies and gentlemen

[52:55] For canada to keep this bad joke going

[52:58] This joke that pinball people wear cargo shorts

[53:02] All throughout the year

[53:04] That the pinball buyer or the pinball

[53:08] Your show attendee is obsessed with cargo shorts and white rebox sneakers

[53:13] Regardless of the temperature. They wear the damn shorts. You know, who else wears shorts all year round teenagers

[53:21] That's pretty much the mental

[53:25] you know

[53:26] The the mental level we're all still at buying these expensive games. We haven't really moved past the age of 16

[53:33] So here's the deal

[53:35] The two shorts up for your votes, which we're gonna do in a second. Don't vote yet. We're gonna vote live

[53:40] There's 104 people watching

[53:44] Your votes will be

[53:47] What picks the winner and I have to order these things today. So let's get this going right now

[53:52] all right

[53:53] We have the traditional

[53:55] cargo shorts

[53:57] Why mess with the formula chris go with what works the traditional cargo short

[54:03] It is hideous to wear as a grown man

[54:07] There are many memes on the internet

[54:09] It will not go with my gucci jacket. I'm going to wear it will be terrible

[54:14] We have the khaki cargo shorts. That's option number two. So if you want the traditional

[54:20] Vote number two

[54:22] Okay

[54:23] number one

[54:25] the controversial short

[54:27] Because it is not in cargo form

[54:30] Because they don't make it in cargo form. I searched for hours to find brazilian cargo shorts

[54:38] Number one is the brazilian

[54:41] The shorts that have the brazilian flag on it as a way to poke fun

[54:47] at the controversy

[54:49] That canada paid for votes in brazil

[54:53] A controversy that was brought to light by no other than

[54:56] canada's biggest fan and friend christopher franci who put up a post about it and then quickly took the post down

[55:04] after

[55:06] This week in pinball proved him wrong that brazil actually has a very large pinball population

[55:12] stern pinball

[55:14] Manufactures games in brazil. Do you guys know this?

[55:18] That stern pinball has a manufacturing facility in brazil

[55:23] And the brazilian fans of canada's pinball podcast were offended the gucci did not make the cut germy

[55:31] So that is what we are going to vote on right now everybody. Okay, so please in the comment section

[55:38] Write which shorts you would like canada to wear with his gucci blazer

[55:43] To hopefully get up on stage and accept the twippy for number six. I will still wear it to the award show

[55:49] All right, just vote. I'm not gonna. I don't want to I don't want to sway you either way. Just just everybody

[55:54] Take let's take a few minutes and vote

[55:57] All right dan says brazilian adam likes the the cargos the regular cargos classic says ian

[56:03] Traditional says david. All right, let's go. I want to say a hundred votes. Frank loves the brazilian

[56:09] brazilian from mitch

[56:12] Jeremy said three jeremy come on get with it jeremy

[56:16] danis says the traditional

[56:19] Garth the traditional a lot of traditionals

[56:21] All right brazilian again another vote for the brazilian

[56:25] classic for sure

[56:28] Apollo's in the house everyone's voting

[56:31] Come on stop voting number three

[56:37] Everybody vote we're gonna keep telling it tolly all them. There's a lot of votes for car classic. There's votes for brazilian

[56:43] See it's funny how voting works. It's like people now are trying brazilian

[56:47] Come on. We need some more brazilian votes. We're getting a lot of traditional

[56:52] All right, I look I want to let you guys decide though. I think traditional might take it

[56:58] We might have a late brazilian. Maybe maybe I need to go buy more brazilian votes

[57:06] Billy even voted i'm shocked

[57:09] okay

[57:11] Barry we have Barry ladies and gentlemen from dutch pinball in the house who just voted brazilian

[57:17] Barry thank you for being here. Hey, Barry now that we've got you

[57:21] Are you going to announce a new game at texas pinball festival? There is a rumor

[57:27] I think I know what you're announcing, but I won't say here out of respect for you

[57:32] um

[57:33] But will you be announcing a new game?

[57:37] Does anyone really think I mean just does anybody really think?

[57:41] That I I've had a cheat to win

[57:44] In the twippies. Does anybody really think that?

[57:49] You know what's weird about facebook polls? I can't do it

[57:52] On here. We got more votes for brazil coming

[57:58] I think it's smart to wait barry. I don't think revealing anything now is a good time

[58:03] I'm actually shocked. Look brazil's getting a lot of votes. I'm going to tally all these up

[58:07] So if you still want to vote keep voting

[58:10] I'm going to rewatch and and and this is going to be transparent. This is not I'm not going to stuff the ballot

[58:19] You know look I I work really hard. I I actually realized I was I messed up my counting. I'm now at

[58:27] 781 podcast

[58:29] So

[58:30] Anyone who thinks that I'm not working hard or you know that I don't I didn't earn these

[58:35] you know these stars and

[58:39] 2700 people like this page and every time I do a saturday morning spectacular

[58:43] It gets a decent amount of views. You know it gets like 1500 which is good for pinball content

[58:48] It's not good for any in any in any real content space. It's embarrassing

[58:53] You know and that's just it. I mean, I think everyone is like

[58:56] I would like to see us turn a corner in 2023. I would like for some of the drama to go away, but you know look

[59:02] The only way for drama to go away

[59:06] You know it's funny because I know people are like well if canada just goes away then it would go away

[59:11] I think if canada left pinball

[59:14] Let's imagine that world if I if I bailed out on doing this and doing my show and doing that

[59:19] I think pinball would be a lot less exciting to follow for a lot of people

[59:24] And I do mean that I do mean that I think and it's not just me. I do I think that pinball content creators

[59:31] Have made this hobby so much fun

[59:34] And we're the ones who are bridging the gap between these game releases

[59:38] But I really do think we need canada's pinball podcast around because I do think we need someone who's not trying to sell you the product

[59:47] Being the you know

[59:49] Being the leading voice if you will in what's happening in the hobby because and you know, look I I've been struggling with this

[59:57] It's not this is not a dig at like zack and greg or

[01:00:01] You know, it's it's like there's a lot of people

[01:00:05] That are making games and I absolutely understand like if I was a distributor

[01:00:09] I'd absolutely be making content to get you to buy my product

[01:00:12] So I completely understand why they're doing what they do. I would do the same thing

[01:00:16] I think what the issue I have lately

[01:00:19] Is it's not even with them. It's not I don't have an issue with them

[01:00:24] I have more of an issue with the the constant spamming

[01:00:29] Of for sale ads by all of the distributors on social media. So let me explain this

[01:00:35] This is what's weird to me. It's like a new pinball machine comes out, right?

[01:00:41] Everyone gets the same machine. There's not like a no dealership has a different model that they get exclusively

[01:00:47] And it's kind of annoying now because I'm not confused like I just saw Joe Newhart already like

[01:00:55] Like taking orders on galactic tank force. It's like it's just it's just like when does it end the constant like

[01:01:03] Like we get it like it's like everyone's talking to the same people

[01:01:09] and

[01:01:10] It's like I use this analogy imagine if a new corvette comes out

[01:01:14] And every single Chevy dealership is spamming social media trying to get you to buy the corvette from them

[01:01:21] And I don't really know how to talk about this topic without upsetting my distributor friends. I know what they do

[01:01:28] I know the role they play

[01:01:31] But man. Oh, man. Oh, man

[01:01:35] Think about why

[01:01:37] A car dealership exists. I'm gonna I'm gonna have this debate right now

[01:01:41] A car dealership exists to service your car, right? A distributor is like a car dealership

[01:01:47] They're a showroom and they help you when you have a problem with your pinball machine. Okay, so that's like a dealership

[01:01:54] Right. They have a showroom most of them

[01:01:57] And they'll help you with problems. Okay, but the reason why

[01:02:02] there needs to be

[01:02:04] car dealerships is because car companies sell millions of cars

[01:02:10] And they can't have millions of customers

[01:02:15] calling

[01:02:17] headquarters

[01:02:19] Pinball only sells

[01:02:22] A few thousand at most

[01:02:25] And most of them don't have problems

[01:02:29] Most people don't need replacement parts help setting up their games like

[01:02:35] so

[01:02:38] If given the option to just

[01:02:42] The problem is this is like buying direct though

[01:02:46] actually gives you

[01:02:48] For for many years if you were to buy to direct you're getting the worst price

[01:02:52] A distributor will deal with you, you know, you like there's there's room

[01:02:56] Right, there's room to finago, you know, I'm hearing stories of people buying toy story now from distributors for 11,500

[01:03:04] But you can't buy a toy story and that's a collector's edition people not an le

[01:03:08] You can't buy a toy story collector's edition for

[01:03:12] 11,500

[01:03:14] So I look I absolutely understand the role of distributors. I I just think like

[01:03:20] the whole model

[01:03:22] if I look at it

[01:03:23] Probably was needed

[01:03:25] When our Cades were everywhere because then distributors

[01:03:29] You know, we're selling to all the local operators their products and setting them up and that makes sense. I start to see that

[01:03:36] But if the majority of buyers are home buyers

[01:03:39] And a lot of distributors are just drop shipping the game from the manufacturer to the home buyer

[01:03:44] And then they you know majority of those games never have issues

[01:03:49] That's easy money. I mean it's easy money

[01:03:52] Now there is backbreaking work hard work in you know, I mean setting up these games there. They weigh 400 pounds

[01:03:59] You know waiting for parts angry customers wondering where their freaking fathom is or their cactus canyon like

[01:04:05] Those distributors have to deal with a lot of that too, which I wouldn't want to deal with

[01:04:10] Um and unfortunately for them a lot of the distributors are in the dark just as much as the customers

[01:04:17] Of what do you think Gabriel? We of course we talked about the the galactic tank force cabinet. I'm digging it people

[01:04:25] I'm digging it if they make this thing in full tank form

[01:04:29] I'm I'm

[01:04:31] I might support this game and I mean when I mean I might support this game. I have to play it first

[01:04:37] If they really keep it limited David fix listen to me

[01:04:40] Don't don't say you're gonna make freaking 800 of them or a thousand

[01:04:45] If they make like 300

[01:04:47] Tanks for 13,000

[01:04:51] I might want one

[01:04:53] I might want one

[01:04:55] And look canada buying a game and endorsing your product bill branis will tell you it means nothing

[01:05:00] Nobody takes me seriously. They don't take my reviews seriously

[01:05:04] Jengas doesn't take me seriously. Um by the way, I think you might see an unboxing video

[01:05:11] Happening overseas today get ready for it

[01:05:16] Yeah, well no, you know the reason why it would be my first american pinball title. It's denis norman. I have faith in

[01:05:22] Dennis norman is a great designer people

[01:05:25] um, it's unfortunate that I'll tell you that their next game is going to be a whitewater too

[01:05:32] He's going to make the game he was working on at deep root

[01:05:35] So you're going to see that after this one

[01:05:38] Did I just spoil that launched? Is this why they hate me?

[01:05:41] Also, I have very very good confirmation

[01:05:45] That's deep riches game is going to be elton john

[01:05:49] I was hoping rocket man was a

[01:05:51] metaphor for top gun

[01:05:54] Um, that was my rumor that I said

[01:05:57] But I'm hearing it is really elton john and the other thing I'm hearing about it

[01:06:02] Well, I'm going to wait until my club members. I have some really

[01:06:05] juicy rumors

[01:06:08] For my club members coming on monday

[01:06:11] Very juicy rumors about the return of a certain game

[01:06:16] That's going to be bonkers if it happens

[01:06:18] So if you're not a canada club member

[01:06:21] And you're like bill bill's a member bill's a member

[01:06:24] Um, if you're not a canada club member

[01:06:27] Can someone post the link to joining the canada club for me, please? It is on patreon

[01:06:33] Lots of good stuff

[01:06:36] Uh-oh

[01:06:37] What happened was there was someone arguing with cliff behind the scenes. He just said he's taking a break from pinball

[01:06:43] I'll give him a call after

[01:06:45] Guys be nice to each other

[01:06:48] Yeah, we don't have to attack each other. We don't have to get nasty like

[01:06:53] You know

[01:06:55] Franchi and canada will kiss and make up

[01:06:57] We will

[01:06:59] Franchi is a very emotional man. So am I he's italian

[01:07:03] Is it what he does

[01:07:05] You know, I love his artwork

[01:07:08] I love his art work

[01:07:10] I love his art work

[01:07:12] Um

[01:07:17] So here's the deal the thing about franchi

[01:07:23] He can sometimes his only thing is this just he just gets so passionate

[01:07:28] He just sometimes makes moves. He look i'll give you an example. He should not be sharing

[01:07:34] The artwork that won't be in the godfather game because the license holder

[01:07:39] Asked them not to use it

[01:07:41] You're not supposed to share that

[01:07:44] You know, it's like I have a lot of great ideas

[01:07:47] I bring my great ideas to the coca-cola company to james and whiskey

[01:07:52] You know some ideas to absolute vacca ideas, you know

[01:07:56] When when a client doesn't want to do something and tells me no

[01:08:01] I don't share that

[01:08:03] you you got to respect that and

[01:08:06] If I shared it, it's like me saying, oh, you know, like look at what I wanted to put out in the world for james in and

[01:08:12] Look how good of a creative I am and I get it. You're but you got it. We got to respect

[01:08:17] that relationship because

[01:08:20] that's

[01:08:21] That's the license holder's decision. They don't want you to share that they don't want you to put it in the game

[01:08:29] And again, it's not a big deal, but it just speaks to like

[01:08:33] You've got to you got to have the firewall and and it's important because that is like

[01:08:40] That's the deal with like the relationship between a license holder and and a service industry

[01:08:45] Like you're servicing the license holder with your product

[01:08:49] And they get to make up their mind on stuff not you

[01:08:53] It is what it is

[01:08:55] You know the devil's advocate is that this is a tiny little niche community and nobody really cares and you know

[01:09:00] It's not hurting anybody, but it just is what it is

[01:09:05] So what could they price a new twilight zone at is someone asked

[01:09:10] I mean in this market

[01:09:12] $20,000

[01:09:14] I mean, there is no there are no toys. There's like one toy in godfather

[01:09:18] So when you say what do you price a twilight zone out if godfather c is 20 is $15,000

[01:09:25] I heard the bomb on galactic tank force

[01:09:29] Is $8,000 for that machine that nordman just showed us

[01:09:35] $8,000 bomb

[01:09:37] It looks like it. I can see it

[01:09:41] I can see it. I don't see

[01:09:44] much in godfather

[01:09:46] How expensive are diverters?

[01:09:48] Like I get that godfather has 4,000 parts. They keep talking about all this those 4,000 parts, you know

[01:09:53] I get it

[01:09:55] But you could have 4,000 pieces of rice

[01:10:00] It doesn't make rice expensive

[01:10:04] You know what i'm saying

[01:10:06] so like

[01:10:07] I just think jersey jack's trying to find all these angles to like

[01:10:11] Prove to us that this thing is worth $15,000 when you know it's not

[01:10:17] It's cool

[01:10:19] The theme is not integrated, right?

[01:10:21] The game's too expensive. I just spilled some coffee

[01:10:24] And I would I would just wait to get if I really wanted a godfather. I would just wait to get a uce

[01:10:30] That's my advice

[01:10:34] I would just wait to get a uce

[01:10:37] I think that's the

[01:10:39] Why wouldn't you why would why would you want to spend 16?

[01:10:42] Five with tax and shipping when you can have the very same game when they will maybe adjust the code a little bit

[01:10:48] Maybe to not be as multi ball heavy. They might tone down the light shows a little bit

[01:10:52] You know, they might why wouldn't you just wait six months?

[01:10:56] Get the same game in perfect condition when it's code complete

[01:11:00] And save yourself three to four thousand dollars. Why wouldn't you just do that?

[01:11:07] I

[01:11:09] Like can't wait we we all we do is wait in pinball like you know what I'm saying

[01:11:13] Like waiting is is the is the number one thing we do most of the time

[01:11:18] Now look the manufacturers don't want there is no other like you know, it's I was listening to orbiter albert

[01:11:23] Albert are you on right now? I'm gonna talk smack about you. So I'm gonna give you a chance to defend yourself. If not

[01:11:28] We'll talk about it offline. So albert said the game has got revolutionary stuff in it. Okay, that's a big word

[01:11:34] I don't see anything revolutionary. I get you might have like Newton balls and

[01:11:38] Captain balls moving around and locking but revolutionary is a term that should be used for something like the first ever lcd and a pinball machine

[01:11:47] Like you know what I'm saying like revolutionary

[01:11:51] Shouldn't be used lightly

[01:11:53] um, he also said that the le is the better buy because he thinks it's gonna hold value and albert come on brother

[01:12:00] There's only one thing that holds value. It's supply and demand

[01:12:04] The le is gonna drop like a lead balloon brother. There's there make once they announced they will make five thousand le's

[01:12:13] they immediately

[01:12:15] Took away two thousand dollars in value from that game immediately

[01:12:21] I think that was big mistake

[01:12:24] They they they see is the only way to go

[01:12:28] It is the only way to go. It looks so much better. It's got the awesome topper

[01:12:33] It's got it's got everything. Why would you not want to see like you know, I'm saying like everything about it is better

[01:12:38] The radcals the invisiglass everything about I see the added value

[01:12:43] You know, he was like, I don't see the added value. How do you not see the extra value albert? Like they put a freaking

[01:12:49] Topper with two knockers going off. Like I think it's like it knocks 10 times in one second

[01:12:54] That's gonna be cool man. Like that tommy gun action again. It's the greatest mobster game ever made for pinball

[01:13:02] It's just not godfather

[01:13:04] So I'm I will love this game as a great mobster game

[01:13:08] I will enjoy it as that and I will laugh every time people say it's the godfather pinball. It's not

[01:13:17] It's not it's like it's like godfather's like the opening act of the concert

[01:13:21] You know, it's like to get you into the game and then like it's another band playing like it's not the godfather

[01:13:27] Is not the main act. It's not the entree of this game and they know that

[01:13:32] And it's painful to watch all this content try to like sell you that it's like

[01:13:37] You you got to look past that to enjoy it

[01:13:40] What you do like you actually do have to look past that that it isn't the godfather to enjoy it

[01:13:49] All I know is this and I look I pitch creative ideas

[01:13:52] To brands that have way more money than all pinball companies combined. Okay

[01:13:56] If I went in with an idea like that, here's how we're gonna do godfather

[01:13:59] We're gonna make it a mobster movie or mobster game and when you you play five different families

[01:14:04] And there's like a cartoon mob character with atomic people like that idea would not get picked

[01:14:13] I think here's here's my guess

[01:14:16] I think they had real licensing restrictions. Here's my guess on what happened

[01:14:21] They're spinning it for us, right? They're spinning it. I I don't believe what eric and keiths are are selling us

[01:14:29] Here's what I mean by that

[01:14:31] I think they were their hands were tied by the licensor and there was restrictions

[01:14:36] On because we're not seeing all of the characters from the movie. I don't think they have the rights

[01:14:42] to use it all

[01:14:45] I think what they had I think they knew they were only gonna get

[01:14:49] A handful of stuff and I think they bought a duration package of the movie

[01:14:54] Which means I think they only paid for maybe five minutes of clips or 10

[01:14:58] This you can do licensing deals like this. You can you can say we want we can use these actors

[01:15:04] And we get this much footage. How much is that going to cost us, right?

[01:15:09] And I think that's what they did and that is why you're not seeing

[01:15:13] like the

[01:15:14] iconic scenes

[01:15:16] Really play out more than just a fraction of a second and that's it. It's like over

[01:15:21] And

[01:15:24] We'll never know the truth, right? Like jack will look you in the face and say we got everything for willy wonka

[01:15:30] That's that's what he said to me everything you want is going to be in the game

[01:15:33] And then none of the clips were in the game

[01:15:36] Like nothing was synced up

[01:15:40] Bill I'm so happy they met your low expectations of godfather. I I am I'm like absolutely

[01:15:46] You are the new

[01:15:48] But bill like you're not if I was a marketing department at pinball company

[01:15:52] I'm bill bill. You're at the top like this guy's gonna buy like we don't have to win him over

[01:15:59] I'm still a little bit surprised

[01:16:03] That eric and his multi-ball

[01:16:06] like approach

[01:16:07] I'm still surprised. He's he's still going down this multi-ball heavy road and

[01:16:14] I you know, I always think everyone I think most people feel this way

[01:16:18] Like you should not be starting multi-balls randomly. Like there shouldn't be

[01:16:25] A randomness to starting a multi-ball like it should be something you have to work for and achieve and then when you get there

[01:16:32] You know, I always love it when multi-ball is part of like a mini wizard mode, right?

[01:16:35] Like you get a multi-ball in the rings when you're playing

[01:16:39] Um, you know when you're at the final scene for each movie, right and it's awesome. It's fun

[01:16:45] You're not always in multi-ball

[01:16:48] Derek Derek Derek

[01:16:51] Derek

[01:16:53] Derek this is where you're wrong

[01:16:56] I know the rules, but if you make a multi-ball happen if this switch just gets hit twice

[01:17:01] Then yeah, that's the rule like there could be stage light multi-ball in guns

[01:17:06] But it's not a good multi-ball because in the rules, brother

[01:17:11] You're handing it to the player too easily and that's what people don't like Derek

[01:17:17] Why don't you understand that it's not about knowing the rules?

[01:17:20] It's about they made rules that allow multi-ball to occur way too easily

[01:17:27] So what don't you get?

[01:17:30] People are you can plunge the ball

[01:17:34] And get multi-ball right away. What what?

[01:17:37] Why would you make it that easy?

[01:17:41] I just I don't get why Derek you have to know the rule like I get the rules brother

[01:17:46] And by the way Derek's my best friend

[01:17:48] Easily hands down my best friend

[01:17:51] You're my best friend buddy

[01:17:53] Um, yeah, we talk every day when he when he can talk. He's probably sick of me, bro

[01:17:59] Derek's gonna pick me up at tpf

[01:18:02] In style. I'll just say that

[01:18:06] What's up, Dave

[01:18:09] There's no uh

[01:18:11] Look, I I just think like

[01:18:14] When I see those rainbow lights and the other thing Albert said

[01:18:19] Albert said like he loves the lights because it attracts people over like what what's going on people

[01:18:25] What's going on here? Like like I the the entire game is not, you know rainbow

[01:18:30] It's not but but there are moments when you can screen grab the godfather

[01:18:36] And it should come with a a seizure warning

[01:18:39] Like label

[01:18:41] What is going on here? Like I don't know juries jersey jack. This is where I'm getting a little bit worried about jjp

[01:18:47] Is they're just like they're just stuck in their own way now like and they're not

[01:18:53] They're not looking at each theme like the hot rails are a good example

[01:18:58] Now they're just gonna be on every game

[01:19:01] And now you're just gonna keep sticking them in different places

[01:19:04] And I'm I'm sorry, but like it made sense for guns and roses

[01:19:07] It didn't really make sense for toy story and it definitely doesn't you know, I get how they're using them in godfather

[01:19:13] But it it's just too much. It just feels like a house on christmas lighting up. I don't know like

[01:19:20] Why I just wish that they would

[01:19:23] Think about each game a little bit more uniquely

[01:19:26] And you know and use stuff when it makes sense and look

[01:19:30] To some of you it makes sense just to me personally

[01:19:33] I think they're overdoing it. I think there's too much going on and when you light up everything at once

[01:19:39] Nothing feels special. It's just like it's just it's just like it's just too much. I look i'm gonna give

[01:19:48] I'm gonna get 50 bucks

[01:19:50] I'm gonna get 50 bucks and then we're gonna end the show soon

[01:19:53] I'm gonna get 50 bucks to the first person that has enough guts

[01:19:57] Who's got the cajones as they would say in the mafia? Who's got enough guts?

[01:20:03] I will I will give you 50 bucks off the price of them

[01:20:06] Who's got the guts to put?

[01:20:09] pin stadiums new like neon adam or neo adam

[01:20:13] Kit into the godfather

[01:20:15] I I will I honestly think it could be the most overloaded looking thing on planet earth

[01:20:21] If you install pin stadium into the godfather

[01:20:24] Canada will give you 50 dollars

[01:20:26] I I don't think I've ever seen a game that doesn't need any more lights, but man, let's screw that

[01:20:31] Let's go all in. Let's get like 900 fully controlled rgb leds into this game

[01:20:39] Like why stop here? Why stop here?

[01:20:43] We are just scratching the surface of how crazy lit up we can get the godfather

[01:20:49] I mean jersey jack went overboard to begin with let's keep going. How many lights can we get into this damn thing?

[01:20:56] I

[01:21:00] Rainbow neo stadium and thing. I mean, let's do it. Let's just do it

[01:21:04] All right gang if you've enjoyed this show, I really do

[01:21:07] I would appreciate any support in the form of stars facebook makes it really easy as you know

[01:21:13] I use these stars as franchies says it makes fun of me to buy brenda sushi

[01:21:18] Um, she's been through a lot this woman. Thank you for the stars. I'm gonna give you shout outs to everybody who's giving stars here

[01:21:24] Dave Howard. Thank you for the stars. This incredible woman

[01:21:27] Has been through so much

[01:21:29] And every day she wakes up

[01:21:33] I mean put waking up next to me is enough killians like mommy like get up

[01:21:37] It's amazing watching a powerful woman

[01:21:41] Just just do her thing. She got she got let go from meta

[01:21:47] You want to know it's crazy. She got let go from meta. Let me show you something

[01:21:54] I think this is I think I'm gonna be right when I say this

[01:21:58] She got let go from meta

[01:22:00] You know and where most people would be let go

[01:22:04] and you know, they might

[01:22:07] They might be like, you know devastated and she was like she was

[01:22:11] But brenda is like an irish

[01:22:15] Like wave like you just can't stop her like she was too big for gallway. She left

[01:22:20] I don't mean too big physically because she's got a very great slender physique. Um, but she

[01:22:26] She left ireland because she wanted more out of life. Unfortunately. She met me on tinder

[01:22:31] I'll tell you that story one time, but we didn't meet through tinder

[01:22:34] I saw her and in her photos

[01:22:37] Where someone I work with is a crazy romantic way to me like I was looking at her photo and I was like, I know this dude

[01:22:43] He sits across from me

[01:22:45] And he dates men so I know he's not like dating brenda and they're like childhood friends

[01:22:51] And he was like, yeah, I know brenda. She's sassy like you guys should

[01:22:55] Go get a drink and we went and had 12 whiskies and the rest was history

[01:22:59] Like once we started dating that was it

[01:23:03] And I was dating two other irish girls who were american at the time

[01:23:07] And she takes me to this bar in the east village

[01:23:10] It's like our fourth or fifth date

[01:23:12] Sassy girl though. I mean you get a few whiskies and brenda forget it like I always tell her

[01:23:18] That she was like undatable and she's gorgeous and she's smart and she's beautiful and she's sexy everything

[01:23:24] She's everything that if I were to put down on paper, you know, I would want and a woman

[01:23:29] Um, and you know and and she's like so kind in her heart all these things. Thank you for the stars brother

[01:23:35] And so she knows that I'm like look, I'm newly single. I had the arcade story

[01:23:39] You know man loses fiance and she and she like that story just broke and she's like going on a date with me

[01:23:45] and

[01:23:46] I was like, yeah, I'm just seeing two other irish girls

[01:23:49] And she looks at me

[01:23:51] And she says because she knew they were american irish and she goes

[01:23:55] With her sexy accent, you know, why would you date an imposter when you can have the real thing?

[01:24:03] I was like, who is this girl?

[01:24:06] Like I I'm sure she was a few whiskies in

[01:24:09] Um, and it was just like it was just awesome. Like I I I look back and you know now that we've been together for eight nine years

[01:24:17] um

[01:24:19] It was nine years ago. Yeah nine years ago

[01:24:23] I just I'm so lucky, you know, I'm so lucky. She's so supportive

[01:24:28] You know, so like I use this money for sushi and it's always fun

[01:24:32] We're going at her father gets in town tonight

[01:24:35] And we're gonna go to omokase monday night

[01:24:39] So if you want to contribute to the omokase, you can billy b is not doing anything. Pete rosen is not here

[01:24:44] My big dogs are not here

[01:24:48] Um

[01:24:49] You know, look all of us we'll go five minutes over just because we started five minutes late

[01:24:54] all of us have

[01:24:55] Partners and family and friends and you know, it's like to be in the pinball this much and to do this much pinball content

[01:25:04] You need you need support you need help like she's with Killian like if I didn't have her

[01:25:10] I couldn't do this right now like and so

[01:25:13] you know, I definitely share

[01:25:15] you know, whatever we get with Brenda because

[01:25:18] Without her there's no canada's pinball podcast. There's none of it. There's none of it. There's absolutely none of it

[01:25:23] I work for a company that supports what I do

[01:25:26] Um, it's been great. No one's tried to get me fired this year, which has been you know knock on wood. Thank you

[01:25:31] I'm best friends with the lawyer

[01:25:34] although, you know taking the show behind the paywall was the best thing ever because

[01:25:38] You know now it's just canada fans hanging out having a good time

[01:25:41] And if you don't if you're not a member of the canada club like it is not toxic

[01:25:44] It is not negative have I been overly harsh on godfather

[01:25:48] Maybe a little bit and the only reason I maybe skewed a little bit more like

[01:25:53] disappointed in the game

[01:25:55] Is because I think the other side

[01:25:58] All the content being made

[01:26:00] By people selling you the game is is what drives me to be a little bit more pessimistic because I think there's too much overly

[01:26:10] There's there's too much over

[01:26:12] excitement

[01:26:14] That is putting money and it's just it's just they're that look game

[01:26:18] trust me

[01:26:19] If I made like $2,000 for every godfather I sold somebody

[01:26:24] It it's the best game ever. Why would you ever they nailed it? They got everything right?

[01:26:30] Like I could do a straight down the middle impressions video. I think they nailed. Oh my god when you see this game

[01:26:34] Oh my you know shots are the new toys. Like it's it's incredible like the

[01:26:39] Creative geniuses that came together took this difficult drama and turned it into such a fun exciting colorful pen

[01:26:45] Like nobody thought you guys were going to do this like you really now like it's it'd be really easy for me to just be like this positive

[01:26:53] Celebrating what they did. It's a toy, right? It's like this great everyone's going to enjoy it like

[01:27:00] But that's why you need canada because I don't make any money

[01:27:03] And I will praise a game

[01:27:05] When I think it deserves praise I will praise a game when they integrate the theme in a great way

[01:27:11] And I will make fun of a game when I think it just pushes the theme to the side and just makes kingpin 2.0

[01:27:17] And tries to sell me it as godfather

[01:27:20] And they know that like they know they did that like you know what I'm saying? It's like no one's like you're you're wrong

[01:27:26] You're wrong chris. Like you're playing through the movie. Like they know

[01:27:30] I'm right

[01:27:31] Like I am right on that like billy b like that. You're not playing the movie we love

[01:27:38] It doesn't mean the game's not fun and this is the ultimate thing about this hobby that we love

[01:27:44] Everything is fun. Like the podcasting is fun. The content is fun. It's a fun topic

[01:27:51] But it's like the I didn't even talk about this and we'll do this for a couple minutes the bond 60th games are arriving

[01:27:58] They're great. It's a great game

[01:28:01] For $8,000, which is what it should be

[01:28:05] It's a stupid game at $20,000

[01:28:08] And you can see it in the owners because they know they're like they really wish

[01:28:13] That they could share that they have one

[01:28:15] And people would be like envious

[01:28:18] That they got one

[01:28:20] And stern should have figured out a way to sell them all for like 10k at most

[01:28:24] And do a lottery system for 500 bond fans and and not made it what it is

[01:28:30] Let the second hand market drive the value up

[01:28:33] But what they did and how they did it

[01:28:37] Is why anyone who buys that game looks like a total jackass and I don't mean like

[01:28:43] You know, they just look like they got more money than brains and I like and again like I get it the guys who buy it

[01:28:48] You I get you have money like I get it. I get it. I I'm absolutely

[01:28:53] Glad you are financially in a place where you can spend 20 grand on a $5,000 machine like great

[01:28:58] You did it and I'm glad you're happy and don't let me calling you a jackass for buying the most overpriced game

[01:29:04] The history of pinball. Don't let that take away from your enjoyment

[01:29:09] But I do I think it was a jackass move because now you showed stern

[01:29:13] They can get away with this crap and why what good does that do for anybody?

[01:29:17] You don't have a game that's going to hold value

[01:29:20] You don't have a game that anybody wants to hear about because all you're doing is telegraphing

[01:29:25] That you bought a thing that's that's going to take this hobby in the wrong direction

[01:29:31] That's it

[01:29:33] You you've now empowered stern pinball to make more moves like this that are going to hurt everybody

[01:29:39] just because

[01:29:40] what

[01:29:42] They could

[01:29:43] Game looks terrible next to the regular James Bond. It's terrible

[01:29:48] Like it's like no effort went into that game

[01:29:51] All right, and I don't mean like keep design just like the fact that like there's nothing no in our blades that

[01:29:56] Armour is terrible the topper is terrible everything about it. It's just pedestrian

[01:30:00] And then you sell it for 20 grand. All right. It's time for killing snap everybody

[01:30:05] everybody life is short

[01:30:07] Go call your mamas if she's still around

[01:30:10] Call your mama. I'm gonna go call my mama right now and tell her I love her

[01:30:14] And thank you for having me because if she didn't

[01:30:18] You wouldn't be here right now. Thank you for the 4200 stars. We didn't hit our limit

[01:30:23] Got halfway there. It's like godfather. It's halfway there

[01:30:28] All right, everybody be good

[01:30:32] I didn't buy 20k from stern div. It's totally different that the used market set that price

[01:30:38] It's it let I want to stay in this for one minute before I go Dave

[01:30:42] if you think

[01:30:44] buying batman for 20k plus

[01:30:46] Look at everything that's in batman 66 brother. It's a fully coded game. It's got the best topper stern's ever made

[01:30:54] It's gorgeous. They only made 80 sle's. It's lineman sheets as masterpiece. You want to compare that?

[01:31:02] To what's in james bond 60th brother? Okay

[01:31:06] There's a reason why james bond 60th will be worth 10,000 one day and my batman sle will be worth 50

[01:31:14] I mean it. It will be worth 50 thousand dollars one day. You'll see when all the dust settles

[01:31:19] It's the most beautiful of machines stern pinball has ever made

[01:31:24] Now would I pay 50 no but somebody will some rich guy wants one nobody gives him up later
